Introduction
P
rojects have been around since ancient times. Noah building the ark, 
Leonardo da Vinci painting the Mona Lisa, Edward Gibbon writing 
The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Jonas Salk developing the polio 
vaccine — all projects. And, as you know, these were all masterful successes. 
(Well, the products were a spectacular success, even if schedules 
and resource budgets were drastically overrun!)
Why, then, is the topic of project management of such great interest today? 
The answer is simple: The audience has changed and the stakes are higher.
Historically, projects were large, complex undertakings. The first project to 
use modern project-management techniques — the Polaris weapons system 
in the early 1950s — was a technical and administrative nightmare. Teams 
of specialists planned and tracked the myriad of research, development, and 
production activities. They produced mountains of paper to document the 
intricate work. As a result, people started to view project management as a 
highly technical discipline with confusing charts and graphs; they saw it as 
inordinately time-consuming, specialist-driven, and definitely off-limits for the 
common man or woman!
Because of the ever-growing array of huge, complex, and technically chal-
lenging projects in today’s world, people who want to devote their careers to 
planning and managing them are still vital to their successes. Over the past 
25 to 30 years, however, the number of projects in the regular workplace has 
skyrocketed. Projects of all types and sizes are now the way that organiza-
tions accomplish their work.
At the same time, a new breed of project manager has emerged. This new 
breed may not have set career goals to become project managers — many 
among them don’t even consider themselves to be project managers. But 
they do know they must successfully manage projects to move ahead in their 
careers. Clearly, project management has become a critical skill, not a career 
choice.
Even though these people realize they need special tools, techniques, and 
knowledge to handle their new types of assignments, they may not be able or 
willing to devote large amounts of time to acquiring them, which is where this 
book comes in. I devote this book to that silent majority of project managers.

Project Management For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
About This Book
This book helps you recognize that the basic tenets of successful project 
management are simple. The most complex analytical technique takes less 
than ten minutes to master! In this book, I introduce information that’s nec-
essary to plan and manage projects, and I provide important guidelines for 
developing and using this information. Here, you discover that the real chal-
lenge to a successful project is dealing with the multitude of people whom 
a project may affect or need for support. I present plenty of tips, hints, and 
guidelines for identifying key players and then involving them.
But knowledge alone won’t make you a successful project manager — you 
need to apply it. This book’s theme is that project-management skills and tech-
niques aren’t burdensome tasks you perform because some process requires 
it. Rather, they’re a way of thinking, communicating, and behaving. They’re an 
integral part of how we approach all aspects of our work every day.
So I’ve written the book to be direct and (relatively) easy to understand. But 
don’t be misled — the simple text still navigates all the critical tools and 
techniques you’ll need to support your project planning, scheduling, budget-
ing, organizing, and controlling. So buckle up!
I present this information in a logical and modular progression. Examples and 
illustrations are plentiful — so are the tips and hints. And I inject humor from 
time to time to keep it all doable. My goal is that you finish this book feeling 
that good project management is a necessity and that you’re determined to 
practice it!
Conventions Used in This Book
To help you navigate through this book, I use the following conventions to 
help you find your way:
 
✓ I use italics to point out new words and to alert you to their definitions, 
which are always close by. On occasion, I also use italics for added 
emphasis.
 
✓ I use bold text to indicate keywords in bulleted lists or to highlight 
action parts in numbered lists.
 
✓ I put all Web sites in monofont.
When this book was printed, some Web addresses may have needed to break 
across two lines of text. If that happened, rest assured that I haven’t put in 
any extra characters (such as hyphens) to indicate the break. So, when using 
one of these Web addresses, just type in exactly what you see in this book, 
pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist.

 Introduction
What You’re Not to Read
Of course, I want you to read every single word, but I understand your life is 
busy and you may have time to read only what’s relevant to your experience. 
In that case, feel free to skip the sidebars. Although the sidebars offer inter-
esting and real-life stories of my own experiences, they’re not vital to grasp-
ing the concepts.
Foolish Assumptions
When writing this book, I assumed that a widely diverse group of people will 
read it, including the following:
 
✓ Senior managers and junior assistants (tomorrow’s senior managers)
 
✓ Experienced project managers and people who’ve never been on a proj-
ect team
 
✓ People who’ve had significant project-management training and people 
who’ve had none
 
✓ People who’ve had years of real-world business and government experi-
ence and people who’ve just entered the workforce
I assume that you have a desire to take control of your environment. After 
reading this book, I hope you wonder (and rightfully so) why all projects 
aren’t well managed — because you’ll think these techniques are so logical, 
straightforward, and easy to use. But I also assume you recognize there’s a 
big difference between knowing what to do and doing it. And I assume you 
realize you’ll have to work hard to overcome the forces that conspire to pre-
vent you from using these tools and techniques.
Finally, I assume you’ll realize that you can read this book repeatedly and 
learn something new and different each time. Think of this book as a comfort-
able resource that has more to share as you experience new situations.
How This Book Is Organized
Each chapter is self-contained, so you can read the chapters that interest you 
the most first — without feeling lost because you haven’t read the book from 
front to back. The book is divided into the following six parts.

4
Project Management For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The 
Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
In this part, I discuss the unique characteristics of projects and the key 
issues you may encounter in a project-oriented organization. I also show you 
how to clearly define your project’s proposed results, how to identify the 
people who will play a role, and how to determine your project’s work.
Part II: Planning Time: Determining 
When and How Much
In this part, I cover how to develop the project schedule and estimate the 
resources (both personnel and nonpersonnel) you need. I also show you how 
to identify and manage project risks.
Part III: Group Work: Putting 
Your Team Together
In this part, I show you how to identify, organize, and deal with people who 
play a part in your project’s success. I explain how to define team members’ 
roles and get your project off to a positive start.
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing 
Your Project to Success
In this part, I explain how to monitor, track, analyze, and report on your 
project’s activities. I also show you how to establish and maintain effective 
communications between you and all your project audiences and how to 
demonstrate leadership that energizes your project team. Then I discuss how 
to bring your project to a successful closure.
Part V: Taking Your Project Management 
to the Next Level
Here, I discuss how to use available technology to help you plan, organize, 
and control your project. I also discuss a technique for evaluating activity 
performance and resource expenditures on larger projects.

5
 Introduction
Part VI: The Part of Tens
Every For Dummies book has this fun part that gives you tidbits of informa-
tion in an easy-to-chew format. In this part, I share tips on how to plan a 
project and how to be a better project manager. I also include one additional 
nugget of information: The appendix illustrates systematic processes for 
planning your project and for using the essential controls that I discuss 
throughout this book.
Icons Used in This Book
I include small icons in the left margins of the book to alert you to special 
information in the text. Here’s what they mean:
 
This icon leads into hypothetical situations illustrating techniques and issues.
 
I use this icon to point out terms or issues that are a bit more technical.
 
I use this icon to point out important information you want to keep in mind as 
you apply the techniques and approaches.
 
This icon highlights techniques or approaches you can use to improve your 
project-management practices.
 
This icon highlights potential pitfalls and danger spots.
Where to Go from Here
You can read this book in many ways, depending on your own project-man-
agement knowledge and experience and your current needs. However, I sug-
gest you first take a minute to scan the table of contents and thumb through 
the sections of the book to get a feeling for the topics I address.
If you’re new to project management and are just beginning to form a plan for 
a project, first read Parts I and II, which explain how to plan outcomes, activities,

Project Management For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
schedules, and resources. If you want to find out how to identify and organize 
your project’s team and other key people, start with Chapter 4 and Part III. If 
you’re ready to begin work or you’re already in the midst of your project, you 
may want to start with Part IV. Or, feel free to jump back and forth, hitting the 
chapters with topics that interest you the most.
 
The most widely recognized reference of project-management best practices 
is A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK), published 
by the Project Management Institute (PMI). The fourth and most recent edi-
tion of PMBOK (PMBOK 4) was published in 2008. The Project Management 
Professional (PMP) certification — the most recognized project-management 
credential throughout the world — includes an examination (administered by 
PMI) with questions based on PMBOK 4.
Because I base my book on best practices for project-management activities, 
the tools and techniques I offer are in accordance with PMBOK 4. However, if 
you’re preparing to take the PMP examination, use my book as a companion 
to PMBOK 4, not as a substitute for it.
As you read this book, keep the following points in mind:
 
✓ PMBOK 4 identifies what best practices are but doesn’t address in detail 
how to perform them or deal with difficulties you may encounter as you 
try to perform them. In contrast, my book focuses heavily on how to per-
form the project-management techniques and processes.
 
✓ I’ve revised and updated my book so that all the tools and techniques 
discussed and all the terminology used to describe those tools and tech-
niques are in agreement with those used in PMBOK 4.
 
✓ Where appropriate, I include a section at the end of each chapter that 
specifies where the topics in the chapter are addressed in PMBOK 4.
 
✓ PMBOK 4 often contains highly technical language and detailed processes, 
which people mistakenly dismiss as being relevant only for larger proj-
ects. My book, however, deliberately frames terms and discussions to 
be user-friendly. As a result, people who work on projects of all sizes can 
understand how to apply the tools and techniques presented.
No matter how you make your way through this book, plan on reading all the 
chapters more than once — the more you read a chapter, the more sense its 
approaches and techniques will make. And who knows? A change in your job 
responsibilities may create a need for certain techniques you’ve never used 
before. Have fun and good luck!

Part I
Understanding 
Expectations 
(The Who, What, and 
Why of Your Project)

In this part . . .
T
he most difficult part of a new project is often decid-
ing where to begin. Expectations are high, while time 
and resources are frequently low.
In this part, I identify how a project differs from other 
activities you perform in your organization, and I present 
a snapshot of the steps you need to take to plan, organize, 
and control your project. I offer you specific techniques 
and approaches to define clearly what you want your proj-
ect to accomplish and who needs to be involved. Finally, I 
show you how to determine the work you have to do to 
meet the expectations for your project.

Chapter 1
Project Management: The Key 
to Achieving Results
In This Chapter
▶ Characterizing projects
▶ Breaking down project management
▶ Coming to grips with the project manager’s role
▶ Determining whether you have what you need to be a successful project manager
S
uccessful organizations create projects that produce desired results in 
established time frames with assigned resources. As a result, businesses 
are increasingly driven to find individuals who can excel in this project-
oriented environment.
Because you’re reading this book, chances are good that you’ve been asked 
to manage a project. So, hang on tight — you’re going to need a new set of 
skills and techniques to steer that project to successful completion. But not 
to worry! This chapter gets you off to a smooth start by showing you what 
projects and project management really are and by helping you separate 
projects from nonproject assignments. This chapter also offers the rationale 
for why projects succeed or fail and gets you into the project-management 
mindset.
Determining What Makes 
a Project a Project
No matter what your job is, you handle a myriad of assignments every day: 
prepare a memo, hold a meeting, design a sales campaign, or move to new 
offices. Or maybe your day sounds more like this: make the information 

10
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
systems more user-friendly, develop a research compound in the laboratory, 
or improve the organization’s public image. Not all these assignments are 
projects. How can you tell which ones are and which ones aren’t? This sec-
tion is here to help.
Understanding the three main components 
that define a project
 
A project is a temporary undertaking performed to produce a unique product, 
service, or result. Large or small, a project always has the following three 
components:
 
✓ Specific scope: Desired results or products (Check out Chapter 2 for 
more on describing desired results.)
 
✓ Schedule: Established dates when project work starts and ends 
(See Chapter 5 for how to develop responsive and feasible project 
schedules.)
 
✓ Required resources: Necessary amounts of people, funds, and other 
resources (See Chapter 6 for how to establish whom you need for your 
project and Chapter 7 for how to set up your budget and determine any 
other resources needs.)
 
As illustrated in Figure 1-1, each component affects the other two. For exam-
ple: Expanding the type and characteristics of desired outcomes may require 
more time (a later end date) or more resources. Moving up the end date may 
necessitate paring down the results or increasing project expenditures (for 
instance, by paying overtime to project staff). Within this three-part project 
definition, you perform work to achieve your desired results.

 Chapter 1: Project Management: The Key to Achieving Results
Although many other considerations may affect a project’s performance (see 
the discussions in the “Defining Project Management” section later in this 
chapter for more), these three components are the basis of a project’s defini-
tion for the following three reasons:
 
✓ The only reason a project exists is to produce the results specified in its 
scope.
 
✓ The project’s end date is an essential part of defining what constitutes 
successful performance — the desired result must be provided by a 
certain time to meet its intended need.
 
✓ The availability of resources shapes the nature of the products the 
project can produce.
 
A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, 4th Edition (PMBOK 4), 
elaborates on these components by
 
✓ Emphasizing that product includes the basic nature of what is to be pro-
duced (for example, a new training program or a new prescription drug), 
as well as its required characteristics (for example, the topics that the 
training program must address), which are defined as its quality
 
✓ Noting that resources refers to funds, as well as to other, nonmonetary 
resources, such as people, equipment, raw materials, and facilities
PMBOK 4 also emphasizes that risk (the likelihood that not everything will 
go exactly according to plan) is an important consideration when defining a 
project and that guiding a project to success involves continually managing 
tradeoffs among all these factors.
Recognizing the diversity of projects
Projects come in a wide assortment of shapes and sizes. For example, 
projects can
 
✓ Be large or small
 
• Installing a new subway system, which may cost more than $1 bil-
lion and take 10 to 15 years to complete, is a project.
 
• Preparing an ad hoc report of monthly sales figures, which may 
take you one day to complete, is also a project.
 
✓ Involve many people or just you
 
• Training all 10,000 of your organization’s staff in a new affirmative-
action policy is a project.
 
• Rearranging the furniture and equipment in your office is also a 
project.

12
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
✓ Be defined by a legal contract or by an informal agreement
 
• A signed contract between you and a customer that requires you 
to build a house defines a project.
 
• An informal promise you make to install a new software package 
on your colleague’s computer also defines a project.
 
✓ Be business-related or personal
 
• Conducting your organization’s annual blood drive is a project.
 
• Having a dinner party for 15 people is also a project.
 
No matter what the individual characteristics of your project are, you define it 
by the same three components I describe in the previous section: results (or 
scope), start and end dates, and resources. The information you need to plan 
and manage your project is the same for any project you manage, although 
the ease and the time to develop it may differ. The more thoroughly you plan 
and manage your projects, the more likely you are to succeed.
Describing the four stages of a project
Every project, whether large or small, passes through the following four stages:
 
✓ Starting the project: This stage involves generating, evaluating, and framing 
the business need for the project and the general approach to performing 
it and agreeing to prepare a detailed project plan. Outputs from this stage 
may include approval to proceed to the next stage, documentation of the 
need for the project and rough estimates of time and resources to perform 
it (often included in a project charter), and an initial list of people who may 
be interested in, involved with, or affected by the project.
 
✓ Organizing and preparing: This stage involves developing a plan that 
specifies the desired results; the work to do; the time, the cost, and 
other resources required; and a plan for how to address key project 
risks. Outputs from this stage may include a project plan documenting 
the intended project results and the time, resources, and supporting 
processes to help create them.
 
✓ Carrying out the work: This stage involves establishing the project 
team and the project support systems, performing the planned work, 
and monitoring and controlling performance to ensure adherence to the 
current plan. Outputs from this stage may include project results, proj-
ect progress reports, and other communications.
 
✓ Closing the project: This stage involves assessing the project results, 
obtaining customer approvals, transitioning project team members to 
new assignments, closing financial accounts, and conducting a post-
project evaluation. Outputs from this stage may include final, accepted 
and approved project results and recommendations and suggestions for 
applying lessons learned from this project to similar efforts in the future.

13
 Chapter 1: Project Management: The Key to Achieving Results
For small projects, this entire life cycle can take a few days. For larger projects, 
it can take many years! In fact, to allow for greater focus on key aspects and to 
make it easier to monitor and control the work, project managers often subdi-
vide larger projects into separate phases, each of which is treated as a mini-
project and passes through these four life cycle stages. No matter how simple 
or complex the project is, however, these four stages are the same.
 
In a perfect world, you complete one stage of your project before you move on to 
the next one; and after you complete a stage, you never return to it again. But the 
world isn’t perfect, and project success often requires a flexible approach that 
responds to real situations that you may face, such as the following:
 
✓ You may have to work on two (or more) project stages at the same 
time to meet tight deadlines. Working on the next stage before you 
complete the current one increases the risk that you may have to 
redo tasks, which may cause you to miss deadlines and spend more 
resources than you originally planned. If you choose this strategy, be 
sure people understand the potential risks and costs associated with it 
(see Chapter 8 for how to assess and manage risks).
 
✓ Sometimes you learn by doing. Despite doing your best to assess fea-
sibility and develop detailed plans, you may realize you can’t achieve 
what you thought you could. When this situation happens, you need to 
return to the earlier project stages and rethink them in light of the new 
information you’ve acquired.
A project by any other name — just isn’t a project
People often confuse the following two terms 
with project:
 ✓ Process: A process is a series of routine 
steps to perform a particular function, such 
as a procurement process or a budget pro-
cess. A process isn’t a one-time activity 
that achieves a specific result; instead, it 
defines how a particular function is to be 
done every time. Processes like the activi-
ties that go into buying materials are often 
parts of projects.
 ✓ Program: This term can describe two differ-
ent situations. First, a program can be a set 
of goals that gives rise to specific projects, 
but, unlike a project, a program can never 
be completely accomplished. For example, 
a health-awareness program can never 
completely achieve its goal (the public will 
never be totally aware of all health issues 
as a result of a health-awareness program), 
but one or more projects may accomplish 
specific results related to the program’s 
goal (such as a workshop on minimizing the 
risk of heart disease). Second, a program 
sometimes refers to a group of specified 
projects that achieve a common goal.

14
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
✓ Sometimes things change unexpectedly. Your initial feasibility and 
benefits assessments are sound and your plan is detailed and realistic. 
However, certain key project team members leave the organization 
without warning during the project. Or a new technology emerges, and 
it’s more appropriate to use than the one in your original plans. Because 
ignoring these occurrences may seriously jeopardize your project’s suc-
cess, you need to return to the earlier project stages and rethink them in 
light of these new realities.
Defining Project Management
Project management is the process of guiding a project from its beginning 
through its performance to its closure. Project management includes five sets 
of processes, which I describe in more detail in the following sections:
 
✓ Initiating processes: Clarifying the business need, defining high-level 
expectations and resource budgets, and beginning to identify audiences 
that may play a role in your project
 
✓ Planning processes: Detailing the project scope, time frames, resources, 
and risks, as well as intended approaches to project communications, 
quality, and management of external purchases of goods and services
 
✓ Executing processes: Establishing and managing the project team, com-
municating with and managing project audiences, and implementing the 
project plans
 
✓ Monitoring and controlling processes: Tracking performance and taking 
actions necessary to help ensure project plans are successfully imple-
mented and the desired results are achieved
 
✓ Closing processes: Ending all project activity
As illustrated in Figure 1-2, these five process groups help support the proj-
ect through the four stages of its life cycle. Initiating processes support the 
work to be done when starting the project, and planning processes support 
the organizing and preparing stage. Executing processes guide the project 
tasks performed when carrying out the work, and closing processes are used 
to perform the tasks that bring the project to an end. The figure highlights 
how you may cycle back from executing processes to planning processes 
when you have to return to the organizing and preparing stage to modify 
existing plans to address problems you encounter or new information you 
acquire while carrying out the project work. Finally, monitoring and control-
ling processes are used in each of the four stages to help ensure that work is 
being performed according to plans.

Successfully performing these processes requires the following:
 
✓ Information: Accurate, timely, and complete data for the planning, per-
formance monitoring, and final assessment of the project
 
✓ Communication: Clear, open, and timely sharing of information with 
appropriate individuals and groups throughout the project’s duration
 
✓ Commitment: Team members’ personal promises to produce the 
agreed-upon results on time and within budget
Examining the initiating processes
All projects begin with an idea. Perhaps your organization’s client identifies 
a need; or maybe your boss thinks of a new market to explore; or maybe you 
think of a way to refine your organization’s procurement process.
 
Sometimes the initiating process is informal. For a small project, it may con-
sist of just a discussion and a verbal agreement. In other instances, especially 
for larger projects, a project requires a formal review and decision by your 
boss and/or other members of your organization’s senior management team.
Decision makers consider the following two questions when deciding 
whether to move ahead with a project:
 
✓ Should we do it? Are the benefits we expect to achieve worth the costs 
we’ll have to pay? Are there better ways to approach the issue?
 
✓ Can we do it? Is the project technically feasible? Are the required 
resources available?

16
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
If the answer to both questions is “Yes,” the project can proceed to the orga-
nizing and preparing stage (see the following section), during which a project 
plan is developed. If the answer to either question is a definite, iron-clad 
“No,” under no circumstances should the project go any further. If nothing 
can be done to make it desirable and feasible, the decision makers should 
cancel the project immediately. Doing anything else guarantees wasted 
resources, lost opportunities, and a frustrated staff. (Check out the later side-
bar “Performing a benefit-cost analysis” if you need extra help determining 
the answer to the first question.)
 
Suppose you’re in charge of the publications department in your organization. 
You’ve just received a request to have a 20,000-page document printed in ten 
minutes, which requires equipment that can reproduce at the rate of 2,000 
pages per minute.
You check with your staff and confirm that your document-reproducing 
equipment has a top speed of 500 pages per minute. You check with your 
suppliers and find out that the fastest document-reproducing equipment 
available today has a top speed of 1,000 pages per minute. Do you agree to 
plan and perform this project when you know you can’t possibly meet the 
request? Of course not.
Rather than promising something you know you can’t achieve, consider 
asking your customer whether she can change the request. For example, can 
she accept the document in 20 minutes? Can you reproduce certain parts of 
the document in the first ten minutes and the rest later?
 
During some projects, you may be convinced that you can’t meet a particular 
request or that the benefits of the project aren’t worth the costs involved. Be 
sure to check with the people who developed or approved the project. They 
may have information you don’t, or you may have additional information that

Performing a benefit-cost analysis
A benefit-cost analysis is a comparative assess-
ment of all the benefits you anticipate from your 
project and all the costs to introduce the project, 
perform it, and support the changes resulting 
from it. Benefit-cost analyses help you to
 ✓ Decide whether to undertake a project or 
decide which of several projects to undertake.
 ✓ Frame appropriate project objectives.
 ✓ Develop appropriate before and after mea-
sures of project success.
 ✓ Prepare estimates of the resources 
required to perform the project work.
You can express some anticipated benefits in 
monetary equivalents (such as reduced operat-
ing costs or increased revenue). For other bene-
fits, numerical measures can approximate some, 

17
 Chapter 1: Project Management: The Key to Achieving Results
but not all, aspects. If your project is to improve 
staff morale, for example, you may consider 
associated benefits to include reduced turnover, 
increased productivity, fewer absences, and 
fewer formal grievances. Whenever possible, 
express benefits and costs in monetary terms to 
facilitate the assessment of a project’s net value.
Consider costs for all phases of the project. 
Such costs may be nonrecurring (such as labor, 
capital investment, and certain operations and 
services) or recurring (such as changes in per-
sonnel, supplies, and materials or maintenance 
and repair). In addition, consider the following:
 ✓ Potential costs of not doing the project
 ✓ Potential costs if the project fails
 ✓ Opportunity costs (in other words, the 
potential benefits if you had spent your 
funds successfully performing a different 
project)
The farther into the future you look when per-
forming your analysis, the more important it is 
to convert your estimates of benefits over costs 
into today’s dollars. Unfortunately, the farther 
you look, the less confident you can be of your 
estimates. For example, you may expect to reap 
benefits for years from a new computer system, 
but changing technology may make your new 
system obsolete after only one year.
Thus, the following two key factors influence 
the results of a benefit-cost analysis:
 ✓ How far into the future you look to identify 
benefits
 ✓ On which assumptions you base your anal-
ysis
Although you may not want to go out and design 
a benefit-cost analysis by yourself, you defi-
nitely want to see whether your project already 
has one and, if it does, what the specific results 
of that analysis were.
The excess of a project’s expected benefits 
over its estimated costs in today’s dollars is its 
net present value (NPV). The net present value 
is based on the following two premises:
 ✓ Inflation: The purchasing power of a dollar 
will be less one year from now than it is 
today. If the rate of inflation is 3 percent for 
the next 12 months, $1 today will be worth 
$0.97 12 months from today. In other words, 
12 months from now, you’ll pay $1 to buy 
what you paid $0.97 for today.
 ✓ Lost return on investment: If you spend 
money to perform the project being con-
sidered, you’ll forego the future income you 
could earn by investing it conservatively 
today. For example, if you put $1 in a bank 
and receive simple interest at the rate of 3 
percent compounded annually, 12 months 
from today you’ll have $1.03 (assuming 
zero-percent inflation).
To address these considerations when deter-
mining the NPV, you specify the following num-
bers:
 ✓ Discount rate: The factor that reflects the 
future value of $1 in today’s dollars, consid-
ering the effects of both inflation and lost 
return on investment
 ✓ Allowable payback period: The length of 
time for anticipated benefits and estimated 
costs
In addition to determining the NPV for different 
discount rates and payback periods, figure the 
project’s internal rate of return (the value of dis-
count rate that would yield an NPV of zero) for 
each payback period.

18
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
Beware of assumptions that you or other people make when assessing your 
project’s potential value, cost, and feasibility. For example, just because your 
requests for overtime have been turned down in the past doesn’t guarantee 
they’ll be turned down again this time.
Considering the planning processes
When you know what you hope to accomplish and you believe it’s possible, 
you need a detailed plan that describes how you and your team will make it 
happen. Include the following in your project-management plan:
 
✓ An overview of the reasons for your project (Chapter 2 tells you what to 
include.)
 
✓ A detailed description of intended results (Chapter 2 explains how to 
describe desired results.)
 
✓ A list of all constraints the project must address (Chapter 2 explores the 
different types of constraints a project may face.)
 
✓ A list of all assumptions related to the project (Chapter 2 discusses how 
to frame assumptions.)
 
✓ A list of all required work (Chapter 4 discusses how to identify all 
required project work.)
 
✓ A breakdown of the roles you and your team members will play (Chapter 
10 explains how to describe roles and responsibilities.)
 
✓ A detailed project schedule (Chapter 5 explains how to develop your 
schedule.)
 
✓ Needs for personnel, funds, and nonpersonnel resources (such as equip-
ment, facilities, and information) (Chapter 6 illustrates how to estimate 
resource personnel needs, and Chapter 7 takes a close look at estimat-
ing nonpersonnel needs and developing your project’s budget.)
 
✓ A description of how you plan to manage any significant risks and uncer-
tainties (Chapter 8 explains how to identify and plan for risks.)
 
✓ Plans for project communications (Chapter 13 discusses how to keep 
everyone who’s involved in your project up-to-date.)
 
✓ Plans for ensuring project quality (Chapter 12 covers how to track prog-
ress and maintain control of your project throughout its life cycle so as 
to achieve success.)
 
Always put your project plans in writing; doing so helps you clarify details and 
reduces the chances that you’ll forget something. Plans for large projects can 
take hundreds of pages, but a plan for a small project can take only a few lines 
on a piece of paper (or a tablecloth!).

19
 Chapter 1: Project Management: The Key to Achieving Results
The success of your project depends on the clarity and accuracy of your plan 
and on whether people believe they can achieve it. Considering past experi-
ence in your project plan makes your plan more realistic; involving people in 
the plan’s development encourages their commitment to achieving it.
 
Often the pressure to get fast results encourages people to skip the planning 
and get right to the tasks. Although this strategy can create a lot of immediate 
activity, it also creates significant chances for waste and mistakes.
 
Be sure your project’s drivers and supporters review and approve the plan in 
writing before you begin your project (see Chapter 3). For a small project, you 
may need only a brief e-mail or someone’s initials on the plans. For a larger 
project, though, you may need a formal review and signoff by one or more 
levels of your organization’s management.
Examining the executing processes
After you’ve developed your project-management plan and set your appropri-
ate project baselines, it’s time to get to work and start executing your plan. 
This is often the phase when management gets more engaged and excited to 
see things being produced.
Preparing
Preparing to begin the project work involves the following tasks (see Chapter 
11 for details):
 
✓ Assigning people to all project roles: Confirm the individuals who’ll 
perform the project work, and negotiate agreements with them and their 
managers to assure they’ll be available to work on the project team.
 
✓ Introducing team members to each other and to the project: Help 
people begin developing interpersonal relationships with each other. 
Help them appreciate the overall purpose of the project and how the dif-
ferent parts will interact and support each other.
 
✓ Giving and explaining tasks to all team members: Describe to all team 
members what work they’re responsible for producing and how the 
team members will coordinate their efforts.
 
✓ Defining how the team will perform its essential functions: Decide how 
the team will handle routine communications, make different project 
decisions, and resolve conflicts. Develop any procedures that may be 
required to guide performance of these functions.
 
✓ Setting up necessary tracking systems: Decide which system(s) and 
accounts you’ll use to track schedules, work effort, and expenditures, 
and set them up.

20
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
✓ Announcing the project to the organization: Let the project audiences 
know that your project exists, what it will produce, and when it will 
begin and end.
 
Suppose you don’t join your project team until the actual work is getting 
underway. Your first task is to understand how people decided initially that the 
project was possible and desirable. If the people who participated in the start 
of the project and the organizing and preparing stages overlooked important 
issues, you need to raise them now. When searching for the project’s history, 
check minutes from meetings, memos, letters, e-mails, and technical reports. 
Then consult with all the people involved in the initial project decisions.
Performing
Finally, you get to perform the project work! The performing subgroup of the 
executing processes includes the following tasks (see Chapters 13 and 14 for 
more details):
 
✓ Doing the tasks: Perform the work that’s in your plan.
 
✓ Assuring quality: Continually confirm that work and results conform to 
requirements and applicable standards and guidelines.
 
✓ Managing the team: Assign tasks, review results, and resolve problems.
 
✓ Developing the team: Provide needed training and mentoring to 
improve team members’ skills.
 
✓ Sharing information: Distribute information to appropriate project 
audiences.
Examining the monitoring and 
controlling processes
As the project progresses, you need to ensure that plans are being followed 
and desired results are being achieved. The monitoring and controlling pro-
cesses include the following tasks (see Chapter 12 for specific activities):
 
✓ Comparing performance with plans: Collect information on outcomes, 
schedule achievements, and resource expenditures; identify deviations 
from your plan; and develop corrective actions.
 
✓ Fixing problems that arise: Change tasks, schedules, or resources to 
bring project performance back on track with the existing plan, or nego-
tiate agreed-upon changes to the plan itself.
 
✓ Keeping everyone informed: Tell project audiences about the team’s 
achievements, project problems, and necessary revisions to the estab-
lished plan.

21
 Chapter 1: Project Management: The Key to Achieving Results
Acknowledging the closing processes
Finishing your assigned tasks is only part of bringing your project to a close. 
In addition, you must do the following (see Chapter 15 for a discussion of 
each of these points):
 
✓ Get your clients’ approvals of the final results.
 
✓ Close all project accounts (if you’ve been charging time and money to 
special project accounts).
 
✓ Help team members move on to their next assignments.
 
✓ Hold a post-project evaluation with the project team to recognize proj-
ect achievements and to discuss lessons you can apply to the next proj-
ect. (At the very least, make informal notes about these lessons and how 
you’ll use them in the future.)
Knowing the Project Manager’s Role
The project manager’s job is challenging. For instance, she often coordinates 
technically specialized professionals — who may have limited experience 
working together — to achieve a common goal. Although the project man-
ager’s own work experience is often technical in nature, her success requires 
a keen ability to identify and resolve sensitive organizational and interper-
sonal issues. In this section, I describe the main tasks that a project manager 
handles and note potential challenges she may encounter.
Looking at the project manager’s tasks
Historically, the performance rules in traditional organizations were simple: 
Your boss made assignments; you carried them out. Questioning your assign-
ments was a sign of insubordination or incompetence.
But these rules have changed. Today your boss may generate ideas, but you 
assess how to implement them. You confirm that a project meets your boss’s 
(and your organization’s) real need and then determine the work, schedules, 
and resources you require to implement it.
Handling a project any other way simply doesn’t make sense. The project 
manager must be involved in developing the plans because she needs the 
opportunity to clarify expectations and proposed approaches and then to 
raise any questions she may have before the project work begins.
 
The key to project success is being proactive. Instead of waiting for others to 
tell you what to do,

22
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
✓ Seek out information because you know you need it.
 
✓ Follow the plan because you believe it’s the best way.
 
✓ Involve people whom you know are important for the project.
 
✓ Raise issues and risks, analyze them, and elicit support to address them.
 
✓ Share information with the people you know need to have it.
 
✓ Put all important information in writing.
 
✓ Ask questions and encourage other people to do the same.
 
✓ Commit to your project’s success.
Staving off potential excuses for not 
following a structured project-
management approach
Be prepared for other people to fight your attempts to use proven project-
management approaches. And trust me: You need to be prepared for 
everything! The following list provides a few examples of excuses you may 
encounter as a project manager and the appropriate responses you can give.
 
✓ Excuse: Our projects are all crises; we have no time to plan.
 
 Response: Unfortunately for the excuse giver, this logic is illogical! In a 
crisis, you have limited time and resources to address the critical issues, 
and you definitely can’t afford to make mistakes. Because acting under 
pressure and emotion (the two characteristics of crises) practically 
guarantees that mistakes will occur, you can’t afford not to plan.
 
✓ Excuse: Structured project management is only for large projects.
 
 Response: No matter what size the project is, the information you need to 
perform it is the same. What do you need to produce? What work has to be 
done? Who’s going to do it? When will it end? Have you met expectations?
 
 Large projects may require many weeks or months to develop satisfactory 
answers to these questions. Small projects that last a few days or less may 
take only 15 minutes, but, either way, you still have to answer the questions.
 
✓ Excuse: These projects require creativity and new development. They 
can’t be predicted with any certainty.
 
 Response: Some projects are more predictable than others. However, 
people awaiting the outcomes of any project still have expectations for 
what they’ll get and when. Therefore, a project with many uncertainties 
needs a manager to develop and share initial plans and then to assess 
and communicate the effects of unexpected occurrences.

23
 Chapter 1: Project Management: The Key to Achieving Results
Even if you don’t encounter these specific excuses, you can adapt these 
response examples to address your own situations.
Avoiding “shortcuts”
The short-term pressures of your job as a project manager may encourage 
you to act today in ways that cause you, your team, or your organization to 
pay a price tomorrow. Especially with smaller, less formal projects, you may 
feel no need for organized planning and control.
 
Don’t be seduced into the following, seemingly easier shortcuts:
 
✓ Jumping directly from starting the project to carrying out the work: You 
have an idea and your project’s on a short schedule. Why not just start 
doing the work? Sounds good, but you haven’t defined the work to be done!
 
 Other variations on this shortcut include the following:
 
• “This project’s been done many times before, so why do I have to 
plan it out again?” Even though projects can be similar to past ones, 
some elements are always different. Perhaps you’re working with 
some new people, using a new piece of equipment, and so on. Take a 
moment now to be sure your plan addresses the current situation.
 
• “Our project’s different than it was before, so what good is trying 
to plan?” Taking this attitude is like saying you’re traveling in an 
unknown area, so why try to lay out your route on a road map? 
Planning for a new project is important because no one’s taken this 
particular path before. Although your initial plan may have to be 
revised during the project, you and your team need to have a clear 
statement of your intended plan from the outset.
 
✓ Failing to prepare in your carrying out the work stage: Time pressure is 
often the apparent justification for this shortcut. However, the real reason 
is that people don’t appreciate the need to define procedures and rela-
tionships before jumping into the actual project work. See Chapter 11 for 
a discussion of why this preparation step is so important — and get tips 
on how to complete it.
 
✓ Jumping right into the work when you join the project in the carrying 
out the work stage: The plan has already been developed, so why go 
back and revisit the starting the project and the organizing and prepar-
ing stages? Actually, you need to do so for two reasons:
 
• To identify any issues that the developers may have overlooked
 
• To understand the reasoning behind the plan and decide whether 
you feel the plan is achievable
 
✓ Only partially completing the closing stage: At the end of one proj-
ect, you often move right on to the next. Scarce resources and short 

24
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
deadlines encourage this rapid movement, and starting a new project is 
always more challenging than wrapping up an old one.
 
 However, you never really know how successful your project is if 
you don’t take the time to ensure that all tasks are complete and that 
you’ve satisfied your clients. If you don’t take positive steps to apply 
the lessons this project has taught you, you’re likely to make the same 
mistakes you made in this project again or fail to repeat this project’s 
successful approaches.
Staying aware of other 
potential challenges
 
Projects are temporary; they’re created to achieve particular results. Ideally, 
when the results are achieved, the project ends. Unfortunately, this transitory 
nature of projects may create some project-management challenges, including 
the following:
 
✓ Additional assignments: People may be asked to accept an assignment 
to a new project in addition to — not in lieu of — existing assignments. 
And they may not be asked how the new work may affect their existing 
projects. (Higher management may just assume the project manager 
can handle everything.) When conflicts arise over a person’s time, the 
organization may not have adequate guidelines or procedures to resolve 
those conflicts (or they may not have any guidelines at all).
 
✓ New people on new teams: People who haven’t worked together before 
and who may not even know each other may be assigned to the same 
project team. This lack of familiarity with each other may slow the proj-
ect down because team members may
 
• Have different operating and communicating styles
 
• Use different procedures for performing the same type of activity
 
• Not have the time to develop mutual respect and trust
 
 Flip to Part III for guidance on how to put together a successful team and 
get off on the right foot.
 
✓ No direct authority: For most projects, the project manager and 
team members have no direct authority over each other. Therefore, 
the rewards that usually encourage top performance (such as salary 
increases, superior performance appraisals, and job promotions) aren’t 
available. In addition, conflicts over time commitments or technical 
direction may require input from a number of sources. As a result, they 
can’t be settled with one, unilateral decision. (See Chapter 10 for sugges-
tions on how to work effectively with people when you have no direct 
authority over them.)

Do You Have What It Takes to Be 
an Effective Project Manager?
You’re reading this book because you want to be a better project manager, 
right? Well, before you really jump in, I suggest you do a quick self-evaluation 
to see what your strengths and weaknesses are. By answering the following 
ten questions, you can get an idea of what subjects you need to spend more 
time on so you can be as effective as possible. Good luck!
Questions
 
1. Are you more concerned about being everyone’s friend or getting a job 
done right?
 
2. Do you prefer to do technical work or manage other people doing tech-
nical work?
 
3. Do you think the best way to get a tough task done is to do it yourself?
 
4. Do you prefer your work to be predictable or constantly changing?
 
5. Do you prefer to spend your time developing ideas instead of explaining 
those ideas to other people?
 
6. Do you handle crises well?
 
7. Do you prefer to work by yourself or with others?
 
8. Do you think you shouldn’t have to monitor people after they’ve prom-
ised to do a task for you?
 
9. Do you believe people should be self-motivated to perform their jobs?
 
10. Are you comfortable dealing with people at all organizational levels?
Answers
 
1. Although maintaining good working relations is important, the project 
manager often must make decisions for the good of the project that 
some people don’t agree with.
 
2. Most project managers achieve their positions because of their strong 
performance on technical tasks. However, after you become a project 
manager, your job is to encourage other people to produce high-quality 
technical work rather than to do it all yourself.

26
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
3. Believing in yourself is important. However, the project manager’s task 
is to help other people develop to the point where they can perform 
tasks with the highest quality.
 
4. The project manager tries to minimize unexpected problems and situa-
tions through responsive planning and timely control. However, when 
problems do occur, the project manager must deal with them promptly 
to minimize their impact on the project.
 
5. Though coming up with ideas can help your project, the project manag-
er’s main responsibility is to ensure that every team member correctly 
understands all ideas that are developed.
 
6. The project manager’s job is to provide a cool head to size up the situ-
ation, choose the best action, and encourage all members to do their 
parts in implementing the solution.
 
7. Self-reliance and self-motivation are important characteristics for a proj-
ect manager. However, the key to any project manager’s success is to 
facilitate interaction among a diverse group of technical specialists.
 
8. Although you may feel that honoring one’s commitments is a fundamen-
tal element of professional behavior, the project manager needs both to 
ensure that people maintain their focus and to model how to work with 
others cooperatively.
 
9. People should be self-motivated, but the project manager has to encour-
age them to remain motivated by their job assignments and related 
opportunities.
 
10. The project manager deals with people at all levels — from upper man-
agement to support staff — who perform project-related activities.
 
Check out the table of contents to find out where I discuss these different 
aspects of the project manager’s job in more depth.

Chapter 2
Clarifying What You’re Trying to 
Accomplish — and Why
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding your project’s Scope Statement
▶ Figuring out how your project fits into the big picture
▶ Identifying project constraints — and working with them
▶ Handling the unknowns of project planning
A
ll projects are created for a reason — someone identifies a need and 
devises a project to address that need. How well the project ultimately 
addresses that need defines the project’s success or failure.
This chapter helps you develop a mutual agreement between the project’s 
requesters and the project team about your project’s goals and expectations. 
It also helps you establish the conditions necessary to perform the project 
work.
Defining Your Project with 
a Scope Statement
 
A Scope Statement is a written confirmation of the results your project will 
produce and the terms and conditions under which you’ll perform your work. 
Both the people who requested the project and the project team should agree 
to all terms in the Scope Statement before actual project work begins.
Your Scope Statement should include the following information:
 
✓ Justification: How and why your project came to be, the business 
need(s) it addresses, the scope of work to be performed, and how it will 
affect and be affected by other related activities

30
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
✓ Objectives: The products, services, and/or results your project will 
produce (also referred to as deliverables)
 
✓ Product scope description: The features and functions of the products, 
services, and/or results your project will produce
 
✓ Product acceptance criteria: The process and criteria for accepting 
completed products, services, or results
 
✓ Constraints: Restrictions that limit what you can achieve, how and when 
you can achieve it, and how much achieving it can cost
 
✓ Assumptions: Statements about how you will address uncertain informa-
tion as you conceive, plan, and perform your project
 
Think of your Scope Statement, when viewed together with the other compo-
nents of your project plan, as a binding agreement in which
 
✓ You and your team commit to producing certain results.
 
 Your project’s requesters commit that they’ll consider your project 100 
percent successful if you produce these results.
 
✓ You and your team identify all restrictions regarding your approach to 
the work and what you need to support your work.
 
 Your project’s requesters agree that there are no restrictions other than 
the ones you’ve identified and that they’ll provide you the support you 
declare you need.
 
✓ You and your team identify all assumptions you made when agreeing to 
the terms of your Scope Statement.
 
 Your project’s requesters agree that, if any of these assumptions prove 
to be invalid, you may have to modify some or all of your project plans.
 
Of course, predicting the future is impossible. In fact, the farther into the 
future you try to look, the less certain your predictions can be. However, your 
Scope Statement represents your project commitments based on what you 
know today and expect to be true in the future. If and when situations change, 
you have to assess the effect of the changes on all aspects of your project 
and propose the necessary changes to your Scope Statement. Your project’s 
requesters always have the option of either accepting your proposed changes 
(allowing the project to continue) or canceling your project.

31
 Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why
Looking at the Big Picture: 
How Your Project Fits In
Understanding the situation and thought processes that led to your project’s 
creation helps ensure that you and your project successfully meet people’s 
expectations. This section helps you clarify the first two elements of your 
Scope Statement: your project’s justification and objectives.
Documents closely related to a Scope Statement
Your organization may use a number of other 
documents that address issues similar to those 
included in the Scope Statement. When you use 
these other documents as sources of informa-
tion to prepare or describe your project plan, be 
careful to note how they differ from the Scope 
Statement. Here’s a list of some of the more 
common documents that contain information 
similar to that in a Scope Statement:
 ✓ Market requirements document: A formal 
request to develop or modify a product. This 
document (typically prepared by a member 
of your organization’s sales and marketing 
group) may lead to the creation of a project. 
However, in its original form, this document 
reflects only the desires of the person who 
wrote it. It doesn’t reflect an assessment 
of whether meeting the request is possible 
or in the company’s best interest, nor is it a 
commitment to meet the request.
 ✓ Business requirements document: A 
description of the business needs that a 
requested product, service, or system must 
address.
 ✓ Technical requirements or specifications 
document: A description of the character-
istics that the products and services pro-
duced must have.
 ✓ Project request: A written request for a 
project by a group within the organization. 
The project request indicates a desire for a 
project rather than a mutual agreement and 
commitment to perform it.
 ✓ Statement of work: A narrative description 
of products, services, or results to be sup-
plied by a project.
 ✓ Project profile: A document that highlights 
the key information about a project (some-
times also called a project summary or a 
project abstract).
 ✓ Project charter: A document issued by 
upper management that formally estab-
lishes a project and authorizes the project 
manager to use organizational resources to 
perform project activities.
 ✓ Work order: A written description of work 
that people or groups within your organiza-
tion will perform in support of your project. 
The signed work order focuses on work 
performance rather than overall project 
outcomes.
 ✓ Contract: A legal agreement for providing 
specified goods or services.

Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
Figuring out why you’re doing the project
When you take on a project, why you’re doing it may seem obvious — 
because your boss told you to. The real question, though, isn’t why you 
choose to accept the assignment but why the project must be done (by you 
or anyone else) in the first place.
The following sections help you identify people who may benefit from your 
project so you can then determine how their expectations and needs helped 
to justify the project.
Identifying the initiator
Your first task in discovering your project’s underlying justification is to 
determine who had the original idea that led to your project (this person is 
called the project’s initiator). Project success requires that, at a minimum, you 
meet this person’s needs and expectations.
 
Identifying your project’s initiator is easy when he’s the person who directly 
assigns it to you. More likely, however, the person who gives you the project 
is passing along an assignment he received from someone else. If your project 
has passed through several people before it reaches you, you may have dif-
ficulty determining who really had the initial idea. Further, the original intent 
may have become blurred if people in the chain purposely or inadvertently 
changed the assignment a little as they passed it on.
To determine who came up with the original idea for your project, take the 
following steps:
 
1. Ask the person who assigns you the project whether he originated the 
idea.
 
2. If that person didn’t initiate the idea, ask the following questions:
 
• Who gave him the assignment?
 
• Who else, if anyone, was involved in passing the assignment to him?
 
• Who had the original idea for the project?
 
3. Check with all the people you identified in Step 2 and ask them the 
same questions.
 
4. Check the following written records that may confirm who originally 
had the idea:
 
• Minutes from division-, department-, and organization-wide plan-
ning and budget sessions
 
• Correspondence and e-mail referring to the project
 
• Reports of planning or feasibility studies

33
 Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why
 
 A feasibility study is a formal investigation to determine the likely 
success of performing certain work or achieving certain results.
 
 In addition to helping you identify the people who initiated your project, 
these written sources may shed light on what these people hope to get 
from it.
 
5. Consult with people who may be affected by or are needed to support 
your project; they may know who originated the idea.
 
Be as specific as possible when specifying your project initiator. In other 
words, don’t write “The sales department requested promotional literature for 
product Alpha.” Instead, write “Mary Smith, the sales representative for the 
northeast region, requested promotional literature for product Alpha.”
 
Be sure to distinguish between drivers and supporters as you seek to find 
your project’s initiator (see Chapter 3 for more information about drivers and 
supporters):
 
✓ Drivers have some say when defining the results of the project. They tell 
you what you should do.
 
✓ Supporters help you perform your project. They tell you what you can do.
For example, the vice president of finance who requests a project to upgrade 
the organization’s financial information systems is a project driver. The 
manager of the computer center who must provide staff and resources to 
upgrade the organization’s information systems is a project supporter.
Sometimes supporters claim to be drivers. For example, when the manager of 
the computer center is asked, he may say he initiated the project. In reality, 
however, the manager authorized the people and funds to perform the proj-
ect, but the vice president of finance initiated the project.
Recognizing other people who may benefit from your project
Although they may not have initiated the idea, other people may benefit from 
your completed project. They may be people who work with, support, or are 
clients of your project’s drivers, or they may have performed similar projects 
in the past. They may have expressed interests or needs in areas addressed 
by your project in meetings, correspondence, or informal conversations.
Identify these other people as soon as possible to determine what their par-
ticular needs and interests are and how you can appropriately address them. 
These additional audiences may include people who
 
✓ Know the project exists and have expressed an interest in it
 
✓ Know it exists but don’t realize it can benefit them
 
✓ Are unaware of your project

34
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
Identify these additional audiences by doing the following:
 
✓ Review all written materials related to your project.
 
✓ Consult with your project’s drivers and supporters
 
✓ Encourage everyone you speak to about the project to identify others 
who may benefit from it.
 
As you identify people who can benefit from your project, also identify people 
who strongly oppose it. Figure out why they oppose your project and whether 
you can address their concerns. Take the time to determine whether they may 
be able to derive any benefits from your project, and, if they can, explain these 
benefits to them. If they continue to oppose your project, make a note in your 
risk-management plan about their opposition and how you plan to deal with it 
(see Chapter 8 for how to analyze and plan for project risks and uncertainties).
Distinguishing the project champion
 
A project champion is a person in a high position in the organization who 
strongly supports your project; advocates for your project in disputes, plan-
ning meetings, and review sessions; and takes necessary actions to help 
ensure that your project is successful.
Sometimes the best champion is one whose support you never have to use. Just 
knowing that this person supports your project helps other people appreciate its 
importance and encourages them to work diligently to ensure its success.
 
Check with your project’s drivers and supporters to find out whether your 
project already has a champion. If it doesn’t, work hard to recruit one by 
looking for people who can reap benefits from your project and who have 
sufficient power and influence to encourage serious, ongoing organizational 
commitment to your project. Explain to these people why the success of your 
project is in their best interest and how you may need their specific help as 
your project progresses. Assess how interested they are in your project and 
how much help they’re willing to provide.
Considering people who’ll implement the results of your project
Most projects create a product or service to achieve a desired result. Often, 
however, the person who asks you to create the product or service isn’t the 
one who’ll actually use it.
Suppose your organization’s director of sales and marketing wants to 
increase annual sales by 10 percent in the next fiscal year. She decides that 
developing and introducing a new product, XYZ, will allow her to achieve this 
goal. However, she won’t actually go to all your organization’s customers and 
sell them XYZ; her sales staff will. Even though they didn’t come up with the 
idea to develop XYZ, the sales staff may have strong opinions about the char-
acteristics XYZ should have — and so will the customers who ultimately buy 
(or don’t buy!) the product.

35
 Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why
To identify the real users of project products and services, try to do the 
following early in your project planning:
 
✓ Clarify the products and services that you anticipate producing.
 
✓ Identify exactly who will use these products and services and how 
they’ll use them.
After you identify these people, consult with them to determine any addi-
tional interests or needs they may have that your project should also 
address.
Determining your project drivers’ real expectations and needs
The needs that your project addresses may not always be obvious. Suppose, 
for example, that your organization decides to sponsor a blood drive. Is the 
real reason for your project to address the shortage of blood in the local hos-
pital or to improve your organization’s image in the local community?
 
The needs your project must satisfy to successfully achieve its purpose are 
termed your project’s requirements.
When you clearly understand your project’s requirements, you can
 
✓ Choose project activities that enable you to accomplish the true desired 
results (see Chapter 4 for information on identifying project activities).
 
✓ Monitor performance during and at the end of the project to ensure that 
you’re meeting the real needs (see Chapter 12 for more information on 
how to track a project during performance).
 
✓ Realize when the project isn’t meeting the real needs so that you can 
suggest modifying or canceling it.
When you’re initially assigned a project, you hope you’re told the products 
you’re supposed to produce and the needs you’re supposed to address. 
However, often you’re told what to produce (the outcomes), but you have to 
figure out the needs yourself.
 
Consider the following questions as you work to define your project’s 
requirements:
 
✓ What needs do people want your project to address? Don’t worry at this 
point whether your project actually can address these needs or whether 
it’s the best way to address the needs. You’re just trying to identify the 
hopes and expectations that led to this project in the first place.
 
✓ How do you know that the needs you identify are the real hopes and 
expectations that people have for your project? Determining people’s 
real thoughts and feelings can be difficult. Sometimes they don’t want to 
share them; sometimes they don’t know how to express them clearly.

36
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
When speaking with people to determine the needs your project should 
address, try the following techniques:
 
✓ Encourage them to speak at length about their needs and expectations.
 
✓ Listen carefully for any contradictions.
 
✓ Encourage them to clarify vague ideas.
 
✓ Try to confirm your information from two or more independent sources.
 
✓ Ask them to indicate the relative importance of addressing each of their 
needs.
 
The following scheme is useful for prioritizing a person’s needs:
 
✓ Must: The project must address these needs, at the very least.
 
✓ Should: The project should address these needs, if at all possible.
 
✓ Nice to: It would be nice for the project to address these needs, if doing 
so doesn’t affect anything else.
 
See whether your organization performed a formal benefit-cost analysis for 
your project. A benefit-cost analysis is a formal identification and assessment of 
the following (see Chapter 1 for further details):
 
✓ The benefits anticipated from your project
 
✓ The costs of
 
• Performing your project
 
• Using and supporting the products or services produced by 
your project
The benefit-cost analysis documents the results that people were counting 
on when they decided to proceed with your project. Therefore, the analysis 
is an important source for the real needs that your project should address.
Confirming that your project can address people’s needs
Although needs may be thoroughly documented (see the preceding section), 
you may have difficulty determining whether your project can successfully 
address those needs. On occasion, companies fund formal feasibility studies 
to determine whether a project can successfully address a particular need.
Other times, however, your project may be the result of a brainstorming ses-
sion or someone’s creative vision. In this case, you may have less confidence 
that your project can accomplish its expected results. Don’t automatically 
reject a project at this point, but do aggressively determine the chances for 
success and the actions you can take to increase these chances. If you can’t 
find sufficient information to support your analysis, consider asking for a 
formal feasibility study.

37
 Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why
 
If you feel the risk of project failure is too great, share your concerns with the 
key decision makers and explain why you recommend not proceeding with 
your project. See the discussion of risk management in Chapter 8 for more 
information.
Uncovering other activities that relate to your project
Your project doesn’t exist in a vacuum. It may require results from other 
projects, it may generate products that other projects will use, and it may 
address needs that other projects also address. For these reasons, you need 
to identify projects related to yours as soon as possible so you can coordi-
nate the use of shared personnel and resources and minimize unintended 
overlap in project activities and results.
Check the following sources to identify projects that may be related to yours:
 
✓ Your project’s audiences
 
✓ Centrally maintained lists of projects planned or being performed by 
your organization
 
✓ Organization-wide information-sharing vehicles, such as newsletters or 
your organization’s intranet
 
✓ Your organization’s project management office (PMO)
 
✓ Upper-management committees responsible for approving and oversee-
ing your organization’s projects
 
✓ Your organization’s finance department, which may have established 
labor or cost accounts for such projects
 
✓ Your organization’s procurement department, which may have pur-
chased goods or services for such projects
 
✓ Your organization’s information technology department, which may be 
storing, analyzing, or preparing progress reports for such projects
 
✓ Functional managers whose people may be working on such projects
Emphasizing your project’s importance to your organization
How much importance your organization places on your project directly 
influences the chances for your project’s success. When conflicting demands 
for scarce resources arise, resources usually go to those projects that can 
produce the greatest benefits for the organization.
Your project’s perceived value depends on its intended benefits and people’s 
awareness of those benefits. Take the following steps to help people under-
stand how your project will support the organization’s priorities:

38
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
✓ Look for existing statements or documents that confirm your project’s 
support of your organization’s priorities. Consult the following sources 
to find out more about your organization’s priorities:
 
• Long-range plan: A formal report that identifies your organiza-
tion’s overall direction, specific performance targets, and individ-
ual initiatives for the next one to five years
 
• Annual budget: The detailed list of categories and individual initia-
tives that your organization will financially support during the year
 
• Capital appropriations plan: The itemized list of all planned 
expenditures (over an established minimum amount) for facilities 
and equipment purchases, renovations, and repairs during the 
year
 
• Your organization’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): 
Performance measures that describe your organization’s progress 
toward its goals
 
 When you review these documents, note whether your project or its 
intended outcome is specifically mentioned.
 
 In addition, determine whether your organization has made specific 
commitments to external customers or upper management related to 
your project’s completion.
 
✓ Describe in the justification portion of your Scope Statement how your 
project relates to the organization’s priorities. Include existing discus-
sions of your project from the information sources mentioned in the pre-
ceding step. If your project isn’t specifically referenced in these sources, 
prepare a written explanation of how your project and its results will 
impact the organization’s priorities.
 
Occasionally, you may find it difficult to identify specific results that people 
expect your project to generate. Perhaps the person who initiated the project 
has assumed different responsibilities and no longer has any interest in it, or 
maybe the original need the project was designed to address has changed. If 
people have trouble telling you how your project will help your organization, ask 
them what would happen if you didn’t perform your project. If they conclude 
that it wouldn’t make a difference, ask them how you can modify your project to 
benefit the organization. If they don’t think your project can be changed to pro-
duce useful results, consider suggesting that the project be canceled.
 
Organizations are consistently overworked and understaffed. Spending pre-
cious time and resources on a project that everyone agrees will make no dif-
ference is the last thing your organization needs or wants. More likely, people 
do realize that your project can have a positive impact on the organization. Your 
job, then, is to help these people consistently focus on these valuable results.

39
 Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why
Being exhaustive in your search for information
 
In your quest to find out what your project is supposed to accomplish and 
how it fits into your organization’s overall plans, you have to seek informa-
tion that’s sensitive, sometimes contradictory, and often unwritten. Getting 
this information isn’t always easy, but following these tips can help make your 
search more productive:
 
✓ Try to find several sources for the same piece of information. The 
greater the number of independent sources that contain the same infor-
mation, the more likely the information is correct.
 
✓ Whenever possible, get information from primary sources. A primary 
source contains the original information. A secondary source is someone 
else’s report of the information from the primary source.
 
 Suppose you need information from a recently completed study. You 
can get the information from the primary source (which is the actual 
report of the study written by the scientists who performed it), or you 
can get it from secondary sources (such as articles in magazines or sci-
entific journals by authors who paraphrased and summarized the origi-
nal report).
 
 The farther your source is from the primary source, the more likely the 
secondary information differs from the real information.
 
✓ Look for written sources because they’re the best. Check relevant 
minutes from meetings, correspondence, e-mail, reports from other 
projects, long-range plans, budgets, capital improvement plans, market 
requirement documents, and benefit-cost analyses.
 
✓ Speak with two or more people from the same area to confirm infor-
mation. Different people have different styles of communication as well 
as different perceptions of the same situation. Speak with more than one 
person, and compare their messages to determine any contradictions.
 
 If you get different stories, speak with the people again to verify their 
initial information. Determine whether the people you consulted are pri-
mary or secondary sources (primary sources tend to be more accurate 
than secondary ones). Ask the people you consulted to explain or recon-
cile any remaining differences.
 
✓ When speaking with people about important information, arrange to 
have at least one other person present. Doing so allows two different 
people to interpret what they hear from the same individual.
 
✓ Write down all information you obtain from personal meetings. Share 
your written notes and summaries with other people who were present 
at the meeting to ensure that your interpretation is correct and to serve 
as a reminder of agreements made during the meeting.
 
✓ Plan to meet at least two times with your project’s key audiences. 
Your first meeting starts them thinking about issues. Allow some time 
for them to think over your initial discussions and to think of new ideas 

40
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
related to those issues. A second meeting gives you a chance to clarify 
any ambiguities or inconsistencies from the first session. (See Chapter 3 
for more information on project audiences.)
 
✓ Practice active listening skills in all your meetings and conversations. 
See Chapter 13 for information on how to practice active listening.
 
✓ Wherever possible, confirm what you heard in personal meetings 
with written sources. When you talk with people, they share their per-
ceptions and opinions. Compare those perceptions and opinions with 
written, factual data (from primary sources, if possible). Discuss any dis-
crepancies with those same people.
Drawing the line: Where your 
project starts and stops
Sometimes your project stands alone, but more often it’s one part of related 
efforts to achieve a common result. You want to avoid duplicating the work 
of these other related projects, and, where appropriate, you want to coordi-
nate your efforts with theirs.
Your description of your project’s scope of work should specify clearly 
where your project starts and where it ends. Suppose your project is to 
develop a new product for your organization. You may frame your project’s 
scope description as follows:
This project entails designing, developing, and testing a new product.
If you feel your statement is in any way ambiguous, you may clarify your 
scope further by stating what you will not do:
This project won’t include finalizing the market requirements or launch-
ing the new product.
 
To make sure your project’s scope of work description is clear, do the 
following:
 
✓ Check for hidden inferences. Suppose your boss has asked you to 
design and develop a new product. Check to be sure she doesn’t assume 
you’ll also perform the market research to determine the new product’s 
characteristics.
 
✓ Use words that clearly describe intended activities. Suppose your proj-
ect entails the implementation of a new information system. Are you sure 
that everyone defines implementation in the same way? For instance, do 

41
 Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why
people expect it to include installing the new software, training people 
to use it, evaluating its performance, fixing problems with it, or some-
thing else?
 
✓ Confirm your understanding of your project’s scope with your proj-
ect’s drivers and supporters.
 
 A colleague of mine had an assignment to prepare for the competitive 
acquisition of certain equipment. She developed a plan to include the 
selection of the vendor, award of the contract, and production and deliv-
ery of the equipment. Her boss was stunned with my colleague’s project 
estimate of six months and $500,000. He thought it would take less than 
two months and cost less than $25,000.
 
 After a brief discussion with her boss, my colleague realized her only job 
was to select the potential vendor, not actually place the order and have 
the equipment manufactured and delivered. Although she clarified her 
misunderstanding, she still wondered aloud, “But why would we select a 
vendor if we didn’t want to actually buy the equipment?”
 
 Of course, she missed the point. The question wasn’t whether the com-
pany planned to buy the equipment. (Certainly the intention to buy 
the equipment was the reason for her project.) The real question was 
whether her project or a different project in the future would purchase 
the equipment.
Stating your project’s objectives
 
As I mention earlier in this chapter, objectives are outcomes your project will 
produce (they’re also referred to as deliverables). Your project’s outcomes 
may be products or services you develop or the results of using these prod-
ucts and services. The more clearly you define your project’s objectives, the 
more likely you are to achieve them. Include the following elements in your 
objectives:
 
✓ Statement: A brief narrative description of what you want to achieve
 
✓ Measures: Indicators you’ll use to assess your achievement
 
✓ Performance specifications: The value(s) of each measure that define 
success
 
Suppose you take on a project to reformat a report that summarizes monthly 
sales activity. You may frame your project’s objective as shown in Table 2-1.

42
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
Table 2-1

Budget

$40,000.
Approvals

the vice president of sales, regional sales 
manager, district sales manager, and sales 
representatives.
 
Sometimes people try to avoid setting a specific target by establishing a range 
of values that defines successful performance. But setting a range is the same 
as avoiding the issue. Suppose you’re a sales representative and your boss 
says you’ll be successful if you achieve $20 million to $25 million in sales for 
the year. As far as you’re concerned, you’ll be 100 percent successful as soon 
as you reach $20 million. Most likely, however, your boss will consider you 
100 percent successful only when you reach $25 million. Although you and 
your boss appeared to reach an agreement, you didn’t.
In the following sections, I explain how to create clear and specific objec-
tives, identify all types of objectives, and respond to resistance to objectives.
Making your objectives clear and specific
 
You need to be crystal clear when stating your project’s objectives. The more 
specific your project objectives are, the greater your chances are of achieving 
them. Here are some tips for developing clear objectives:
 
✓ Be brief when describing each objective. If you take an entire page to 
describe a single objective, most people won’t read it. Even if they do 
read it, your objective probably won’t be clear and may have multiple 
interpretations.
 
✓ Don’t use technical jargon or acronyms. Each industry (such as phar-
maceuticals, telecommunications, finance, and insurance) has its own 
vocabulary, and so does each company within that industry. Within 
companies, different departments (such as accounting, legal, and infor-
mation services) also have their own jargons. Because of this prolifera-
tion of specialized languages, the same three-letter acronym (TLA) can 
have two or more meanings in the same organization! To reduce the 
chances for misunderstandings, express your objectives in language that 
people of all backgrounds and experiences are familiar with.

43
 Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why
 
✓ Make your objectives SMART, as follows:
 
• Specific: Define your objectives clearly, in detail, with no room for 
misinterpretation.
 
• Measurable: State the measures and performance specifications 
you’ll use to determine whether you’ve met your objectives.
 
• Aggressive: Set challenging objectives that encourage people to 
stretch beyond their comfort zones.
 
• Realistic: Set objectives the project team believes it can achieve.
 
• Time sensitive: Include the date by which you’ll achieve the 
objectives.
 
✓ Make your objectives controllable. Make sure that you and your team 
believe you can influence the success of each objective. If you don’t 
believe you can, you may not commit 100 percent to achieving it (and 
most likely you won’t even try). In that case, it becomes a wish, not an 
objective.
 
✓ Identify all objectives. Time and resources are always scarce, so if you 
don’t specify an objective, you won’t (and shouldn’t) work to achieve it.
 
✓ Be sure drivers and supporters agree on your project’s objectives. 
When drivers buy into your objectives, you feel confident that achieving 
the objectives constitutes true project success. When supporters buy 
into your objectives, you have the greatest chance that people will work 
their hardest to achieve them.
 
 If drivers don’t agree with your objectives, revise them until they do 
agree. After all, your drivers’ needs are the whole reason for your proj-
ect! If supporters don’t buy into your objectives, work with them to iden-
tify their concerns and develop approaches they think can work.
Probing for all types of objectives
When you start a project, the person who makes the initial project request 
often tells you the major results she wants to achieve. However, she may 
want the project to address other items that she forgot to mention to you. 
And other (as yet unidentified) people may also want your project to accom-
plish certain results.
 
You need to identify all project objectives as early as possible so you can plan 
for and devote the necessary time and resources to accomplishing each one. 
When you probe to identify all possible objectives, consider that projects may 
have objectives in the following three categories:
 
✓ Physical products or services
 
✓ The effects of these products or services
 
✓ General organizational benefits that weren’t the original reason for the 
project

44
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
Suppose that your information technology (IT) department is about to pur-
chase and install a new software package for searching and analyzing informa-
tion in the company’s parts-inventory database. The following are examples of 
objectives this project may have in each category:
 
✓ Physical product or service: The completed installation and integration 
of the new software package with the parts-inventory database
 
✓ The effect of a product or service: Reduced inventory-storage costs due 
to timelier ordering facilitated by the new software
 
✓ A general organizational benefit: Use of the new software with other 
company databases
 
An objective is different from a serendipity (a chance occurrence or coinci-
dence). In the previous example of the new software package, consider that 
one project driver won’t be completely satisfied unless the software for the 
parts-inventory database is also installed and integrated with the company’s 
product-inventory database. In this case, installing the system on the compa-
ny’s product-inventory database must be an objective of your project so you 
must devote specific time and resources to accomplish it. On the other hand, 
if your audience will be happy whether you do or don’t install the software 
on the second database, being able to use the software on that database is a 
serendipity — so you shouldn’t devote any time or resources specifically to 
accomplishing it.
Determining all project objectives requires you to identify all drivers who 
may have specific expectations for your project. See Chapter 3 for a discus-
sion of the different types of audiences and tips on how to identify them all.
Anticipating resistance to clearly defined objectives
Some people are uncomfortable committing to specific objectives because 
they’re concerned they may not achieve them. Unfortunately, no matter what 
the reason, not having specific objectives makes it more difficult to know 
whether you’re addressing your drivers’ true expectations and whether 
you’re meeting those expectations. In other words, when your objectives 
aren’t specific, you increase the chances that your project won’t succeed.
 
Here are some excuses people give for not defining their objectives too specifi-
cally, along with suggestions for addressing those excuses:
 
✓ Excuse 1: Too much specificity stifles creativity.
 
 Response: Creativity should be encouraged — the question is where 
and when. You want your project’s drivers to be clear and precise 
when stating their objectives; you want your project’s supporters to be 
creative when figuring out ways to meet these objectives. You want to 
understand what people do expect from your project, not what they may 
expect. The more clearly you can describe their actual objectives, the 
easier it is to determine whether (and how) you can meet them.

45
 Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why
 
✓ Excuse 2: Your project entails research and new development, and 
you can’t tell today what you’ll be able to accomplish.
 
 Response: Objectives are targets, not guarantees. Certain projects have 
more risks than others. When you haven’t done a task before, you don’t 
know whether it’s possible. And, if it is possible, you don’t know how long 
it’ll take and how much it’ll cost. But you must state at the outset exactly 
what you want to achieve and what you think is possible, even though 
you may have to change your objectives as the project progresses.
 
✓ Excuse 3: What if interests or needs change?
 
 Response: Objectives are targets based on what you know and expect 
today. If conditions change in the future, you may have to revisit one or 
more of your objectives to see whether they’re still relevant and feasible 
or whether they, too, must change.
 
✓ Excuse 4: The project’s requestor doesn’t know what she specifically 
wants her project to achieve.
 
 Response: Ask her to come back when she does. If you begin working on 
this project now, you have a greater chance of wasting time and resources 
to produce results that the requestor later decides she doesn’t want.
 
✓ Excuse 5: Even though specific objectives help determine when you’ve 
succeeded, they also make it easier to determine when you haven’t.
 
 Response: Yep. That’s true. However, because your project was framed 
to accomplish certain results, you need to know if those results were 
achieved. If they weren’t, you may have to perform additional work to 
accomplish them. In addition, you want to determine the benefits the 
organization is realizing from the money it’s spending.
Marking Boundaries: Project Constraints
Naturally, you’d like to operate in a world where everything is possible — 
that is, where you can do anything necessary to achieve your desired results. 
Your clients and your organization, on the other hand, would like to believe 
that you can achieve everything they want with minimal or no cost to them. 
Of course, neither situation is true.
Defining the constraints you must work within introduces reality into your 
plans and helps clarify expectations. As you plan and implement your proj-
ect, think in terms of the following two types of constraints:
 
✓ Limitations: Restrictions other people place on the results you have to 
achieve, the time frames you have to meet, the resources you can use, 
and the way you can approach your tasks
 
✓ Needs: Requirements you stipulate must be met so you can achieve 
project success

46
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
The following sections help you determine your project’s limitations and needs.
Working within limitations
Project limitations may influence how you perform your project and may 
even determine whether or not you (and your project’s drivers and support-
ers) decide to proceed with your project. Consult with your project’s drivers 
and supporters to identify limitations as early as possible so you can design 
your plan to accommodate them.
Understanding the types of limitations
Project limitations typically fall into several categories. By recognizing these 
categories, you can focus your investigations and thereby increase the 
chances that you’ll discover all limitations affecting your project. Your proj-
ect’s drivers and supporters may have preset expectations or requirements 
in one or more of the following categories:
 
✓ Results: The products and effect of your project. For example, the new 
product must cost no more than $300 per item to manufacture, or the 
new book must be fewer than 384 pages in length.
 
✓ Time frames: When you must produce certain results. For example, your 
project must be done by June 30. You don’t know whether it’s possible 
to finish by June 30; you just know that someone expects the product to 
be produced by then.
 
✓ Resources: The type, amount, and availability of resources to perform 
your project work. Resources can include people, funds, equipment, 
raw materials, facilities, information, and so on. For example, you have a 
budget of $100,000; you can have two people full time for three months; 
or you can’t use the test laboratory during the first week in June.
 
✓ Activity performance: The strategies for performing different tasks. 
For example, you’re told that you must use your organization’s printing 
department to reproduce the new users’ manuals for the system you’re 
developing. You don’t know what the manual will look like, how many 
pages it’ll be, the number of copies you’ll need, or when you’ll need 
them. Therefore, you can’t know whether your organization’s printing 
department is up to the task. But at this point, you do know that some-
one expects you to have the printing department do the work.
 
Be careful of vague limitations; they provide poor guidance for what you can 
or can’t do, and they can demoralize people who have to deal with them. Here 
are some examples of vague limitations and how you can improve them:

47
 Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why
 
✓ Time frame limitation:
 
• Vague: “Finish this project as soon as possible.” This statement 
tells you nothing. With this limitation, your audience may suddenly 
demand your project’s final results — with no advance warning.
 
• Specific: “Finish this project by close of business June 30.”
 
✓ Resource limitation:
 
• Vague: “You can have Laura Webster on your project part time in 
May.” How heavily can you count on her? From Laura’s point of 
view, how can she juggle all her assignments in that period if she 
has no idea how long each one will take?
 
• Specific: “You can have Laura Webster on your project four hours 
per day for the first two weeks in May.”
 
When people aren’t specific about their constraints, you can’t be sure whether 
you can honor their requests. The longer people wait to be specific, the less 
likely you are to adhere to the limitation and successfully complete your project.
Looking for project limitations
Determining limitations is a fact-finding mission, so your job is to identify and 
examine all possible sources of information. You don’t want to miss anything, 
and you want to clarify any conflicting information. After you know what 
people expect, you can determine how (or whether) you can meet those 
expectations. Try the following approaches:
 
✓ Consult your audiences. Check with drivers about limitations regard-
ing desired results; check with supporters about limitations concerning 
activity performance and resources.
 
✓ Review relevant written materials. These materials may include long-
range plans, annual budgets and capital appropriations plans, benefit-
cost analyses, feasibility studies, reports of related projects, minutes of 
meetings, and individuals’ performance objectives.
 
✓ When you identify a limitation, be sure to note its source. Confirming 
a limitation from different sources increases your confidence in its accu-
racy. Resolve conflicting opinions about a limitation as soon as possible.
Addressing limitations in your Scope Statement
List all project limitations in your Scope Statement. If you have to explore 
ways to modify your project plan in the future, this list of limitations can help 
define alternatives that you can and cannot consider.

48
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
You can reflect limitations in your project in two ways:
 
✓ Incorporate limitations directly into your plan. For example, if a key 
driver says you have to finish your project by September 30, you may 
choose to set September 30 as your project’s completion date. Of 
course, because September 30 is the outside limit, you may choose to 
set a completion date of August 31. In this case, the limitation influences 
your target completion date but isn’t equivalent to it.
 
✓ Identify any project risks that result from a limitation. For example, if 
you feel the target completion date is unusually aggressive, the risk of 
missing that date may be significant. You want to develop plans to mini-
mize and manage that risk throughout your project. (See Chapter 8 for 
more information on how to assess and plan for risks and uncertainties.)
Dealing with needs
As soon as possible, decide on the situations or conditions necessary for 
your project’s success. Most of these needs relate to project resources. Here 
are a few examples of resource-related needs:
 
✓ Personnel: “I need a technical editor for a total of 40 hours in August.”
 
✓ Budget: “I need a budget of $10,000 for computer peripherals.”
 
✓ Other resources: “I need access to the test laboratory during June.”
 
Be as clear as possible when describing your project’s needs. The more spe-
cific you are, the more likely other people are to understand and meet those 
needs.
Sometimes you can identify needs very early in your project planning. More 
often, however, particular needs surface as you create a plan that addresses 
the drivers’ expectations. As your list of needs grows, check with your 
project’s supporters to decide how the new needs can be met and at what 
cost. Check with your project’s drivers to confirm that the estimated addi-
tional cost is justified, and modify your project documentation to reflect any 
changes in planned results, activities, schedules, or resources.

49
 Chapter 2: Clarifying What You’re Trying to Accomplish — and Why
Facing the Unknowns When Planning
As you proceed through your planning process, you can identify issues or 
questions that may affect your project’s performance. Unfortunately, just 
identifying these issues or questions doesn’t help you address them.
 
For every potential issue you identify, make assumptions regarding unknowns 
associated with it. Then use these assumptions as you plan your project. 
Consider the following examples:
 
✓ Issue: You don’t have a final, approved budget for your project.
 
 Approach: Assume you’ll get $50,000 for your project. Plan for your proj-
ect to spend up to, but no more than, $50,000. Develop detailed informa-
tion to demonstrate why your project budget must be $50,000, and share 
that information with key decision makers.
 
✓ Issue: You don’t know when you’ll get authorization to start work on 
your project.
 
 Approach: Assume you’ll receive authorization to start work on August 1. 
Plan your project work so that no activities start before August 1. 
Explain to key decision makers why your project must start on August 1, 
and work with them to facilitate your project’s approval by that date.
Note: Don’t forget to consider all project assumptions when you develop 
your project’s risk-management plan. See Chapter 8 for more info.

Knowing Your Project’s Audience: 
Involving the Right People
In This Chapter
▶ Identifying your project’s diverse audiences and building an audience list
▶ Considering your drivers, supporters, and observers
▶ Determining who has authority in your project
▶ Prioritizing your audiences by their levels of power and interest
O
ften a project is like an iceberg: Nine-tenths of it lurks below the sur-
face. You receive an assignment and you think you know what it entails 
and who needs to be involved. Then, as the project unfolds, new people 
emerge who may affect your goals and your approach to the project.
You risk compromising your project in the following two ways when you 
don’t involve key people or groups in your project in a timely manner:
 
✓ First, you may miss important information that can affect the project’s 
performance and ultimate success.
 
✓ Second, and sometimes more painful, you may insult someone. And you 
can be sure that, when someone feels you have slighted or insulted him, 
he’ll take steps to make sure you don’t do it again!
As soon as you begin to think about a new project, start to identify people who 
may play a role. This chapter shows you how to identify these candidates; 
how to decide whether, when, and how to involve them; and how to determine 
who has the authority, power, and interest to make critical decisions.
Understanding Your Project’s Audiences
A project audience is any person or group that supports, is affected by, or is 
interested in your project. Your project’s audiences can be inside or outside 
your organization, and knowing who they are helps you

52
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
✓ Plan whether, when, and how to involve them.
 
✓ Determine whether the scope of the project is bigger or smaller than 
you originally anticipated.
 
You may hear other terms used in the business world to describe project 
audiences, but these terms address only some of the people from your com-
plete project audience list. Here are some examples:
 
✓ A stakeholder list identifies people and groups who support or are 
affected by your project. The stakeholder list doesn’t usually include 
people who are merely interested in your project.
 
✓ A distribution list identifies people who receive copies of written project 
communications. These lists are often out-of-date for a couple of rea-
sons. Some people remain on the list simply because no one removes 
them; other people are on the list because no one wants to run the 
risk of insulting them by removing them. In either case, having their 
names on this list doesn’t ensure that these people actually support, are 
affected by, or are interested in your project.
 
✓ Team members are people whom the project manager directs. All team 
members are stakeholders, and, as such, they’re part of the project audi-
ence, but the audience list includes more than just team members.
Developing an Audience List
As you identify the different audiences for your project, record them in an 
audience list. Check out the following sections for information on how to 
develop this list.
Starting your audience list
A project audience list is a living document. You need to start developing 
your list as soon as you begin thinking about your project. Write down any 
names that occur to you; when you discuss your project with other people, 
ask them who they think may be affected by or interested in your project. 
Then select a small group of the audiences you identify and conduct a formal 
brainstorming session. Continue to add and subtract names to your audience 
list until you can’t think of anyone else.
In the following sections, I explain how to refine your audience list by using 
specific categories and recognizing important potential audiences; I wrap up 
with a sample to show you how to put your own list together.

53
 Chapter 3: Knowing Your Project’s Audience: Involving the Right People
Using specific categories
To increase your chances of identifying all appropriate people, develop 
your audience list in categories. You’re less likely to overlook people when 
you consider them department by department or group by group instead of 
trying to identify everyone from the organization individually at the same 
time.
 
Start your audience list by developing a hierarchical grouping of categories 
that covers the universe of people who may be affected by, needed to support, 
or interested in your project. I often start with the following groups:
 
✓ Internal: People and groups inside your organization
 
• Upper management: Executive-level management responsible for 
the general oversight of all organization operations
 
• Requesters: The person who came up with the idea for your proj-
ect and all the people through whom the request passed before 
you received it
 
• Project manager: The person with overall responsibility for suc-
cessfully completing the project
 
• End users: People who will use the goods or services the project 
will produce
 
• Team members: People assigned to the project whose work the 
project manager directs
 
• Groups normally involved: Groups typically involved in most 
projects in the organization, such as the human resources, finance, 
contracts, and legal departments
 
• Groups needed just for this project: Groups or people with special 
knowledge related to this project
 
✓ External: People and groups outside your organization
 
• Clients or customers: People or groups that buy or use your orga-
nization’s products or services
 
• Collaborators: Groups or organizations with whom you may 
pursue joint ventures related to your project
 
• Vendors, suppliers, and contractors: Organizations that provide 
personnel, raw materials, equipment, or other resources required 
to perform your project’s work
 
• Regulators: Government agencies that establish regulations and 
guidelines that govern some aspect of your project work
 
• Professional societies: Groups of professionals that may influence 
or be interested in your project
 
• The public: The local, national, and international community of 
people who may be affected by or interested in your project

54
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
Continue to subdivide these categories further until you arrive at position 
descriptions and the names of the people who occupy them.
Considering audiences that are often overlooked
 
As you develop your audience list, be sure not to overlook the following 
potential audiences:
 
✓ Support groups: These people don’t tell you what you should do; 
instead, they help you accomplish the project’s goals. If support 
groups know about your project early, they can fit you into their work 
schedules more readily. They can also tell you information about their 
capabilities and processes that may influence what your project can 
accomplish and by when you can do so. Such groups include
 
• Facilities
 
• Finance
 
• Human resources
 
• Information services
 
• Legal services
 
• Procurement or contracting
 
Dealing with reality rather than ignoring it
A number of years ago, I ran into a woman who 
had attended one of my project-management 
training sessions. She said she was using sev-
eral of the techniques discussed in the course 
and found them to be very helpful. However, she 
also said that, after making a serious attempt to 
create an audience list, she found this tool to be 
impractical and of little value.
She explained that her boss had assigned her 
a project that she had to finish in two months. 
She immediately developed an audience list, 
but, much to her horror, the list included more 
than 150 names! How, she wondered, was she 
supposed to involve more than 150 people in 
a two-month project? She concluded that the 
audience list was clearly of no help.
In fact, her audience list had served its purpose 
perfectly. Identifying the people at the outset 
who would affect the success of her project 
gave her three options:
 ✓ She could plan how and when to involve 
each person during the project.
 ✓ She could assess the potential conse-
quences of not involving one or more of her 
audiences.
 ✓ She could discuss extending the project 
deadline or reducing its scope with her 
boss if she felt she couldn’t ignore any of 
the audiences.
The audience list itself doesn’t decide whom 
you should involve in your project. Instead, it 
specifies those people who may affect the suc-
cess of your project so you can weigh the ben-
efits and the costs of including or omitting them.

55
 Chapter 3: Knowing Your Project’s Audience: Involving the Right People
 
• Quality
 
• Security
 
• Project management office
 
✓ End users of your project’s products: People or groups who will use 
the goods and services your project produces. Involving end users at 
the beginning and throughout your project helps ensure that the goods 
and services produced are as easy as possible to implement and use 
and are most responsive to their true needs. It also confirms that you 
appreciate the fact that the people who will use a product may have 
important insights into what it should look like and do, which increases 
the chances that they will work to implement the products successfully.
 
 In some cases, you may omit end users on your audience list because 
you don’t know who they are. In other situations, you may think you 
have taken them into account through liaisons — people who rep-
resent the interests of the end users. (Check out the nearby sidebar 
“Discovering the real end users” for a costly example of what can 
happen when you depend solely on liaisons.)
 
✓ People who will maintain or support the final product: People who 
will service your project’s final products affect the continuing success 
of these products. Involving these people throughout your project gives 
them a chance to make your project’s products easier to maintain and 
support. It also allows them to become familiar with the products and 
effectively build their maintenance into existing procedures.
Discovering the real end users
A major international bank based in the United 
States had spent millions of dollars revising 
and upgrading its information system. Project 
personnel had worked closely with special liai-
sons in Europe who represented the interests 
of the local bank personnel who would actu-
ally be entering and retrieving data from the 
new system. When the bank introduced the 
upgraded system, they discovered a fatal prob-
lem: More than 90 percent of the local bank per-
sonnel in Europe were non-English speaking, 
but the system documentation was all written in 
English. The enhanced systems were unusable!
The system designers had spent substantial 
time and money working with the liaisons to 
identify and address the interests and needs of 
the end users. However, the liaisons had raised 
only issues from their own experience instead 
of identifying and sharing the needs and con-
cerns of the local bank personnel. Because 
English was the primary language of all the liai-
sons, they failed to consider the possible need 
to prepare system instructions in multiple lan-
guages. Putting the local bank personnel on the 
audience list along with the liaisons would’ve 
reminded the project personnel not to overlook 
their special needs.

Ensuring your audience list is 
complete and up-to-date
Many different groups of people may influence the success of or have an 
interest in your project. Knowing who these people are allows you to plan 
to involve them at the appropriate times during your project. Therefore, 

57
 Chapter 3: Knowing Your Project’s Audience: Involving the Right People
identifying all project audiences as soon as possible and reflecting any 
changes in those audiences as soon as you find out about them are important 
steps to take as you manage your project.
 
To ensure your audience list is complete and up-to-date, consider the follow-
ing guidelines:
 
✓ Eventually identify each audience by position description and name. 
You may, for example, initially identify people from sales and marketing 
as an audience. Eventually, however, you want to specify the particular 
people from that group, such as brand manager for XYZ product, Sharon 
Wilson, and their contact information.
 
✓ Speak with a wide range of people. Check with people in different orga-
nizational units, from different disciplines, and with different tenures in 
the organization. Ask every person whether she can think of anyone else 
you should speak with. The more people you speak with, the less likely 
you are to overlook someone important.
 
✓ Allow sufficient time to develop your audience list. Start to develop 
your list as soon as you become project manager. The longer you think 
about your project, the more potential audiences you can identify. 
Throughout the project, continue to check with people to identify addi-
tional audiences.
 
✓ Include audiences who may play a role at any time during your 
project. Your only job at this stage is to identify names so you don’t 
forget them. At a later point, you can decide whether, when, and how to 
involve these people (see the “Considering the Drivers, Supporters, and 
Observers in Your Audience” section later in this chapter).
 
✓ Include team members’ functional managers. Include the people to 
whom the project manager and team members directly report. Even 
though functional managers usually don’t perform project tasks them-
selves, they can help ensure that the project manager and team mem-
bers devote the time they originally promised to the project and that 
they have the resources necessary to perform their project assignments.
 
✓ Include a person’s name on the audience list for every role she plays. 
Suppose your boss plans to provide expert technical advice to your 
project team. Include your boss’s name twice — once as your direct 
supervisor and once as the technical expert. If your boss is promoted 
but continues to serve as a technical advisor to your project, the sepa-
rate listings remind you that a new person now occupies your direct 
supervisor’s slot.
 
✓ Continue to add and remove names from your audience list through-
out your project. Your audience list evolves as you understand more 
about your project and as your project changes. Plan to review your list 
at regular intervals throughout the project to identify names that should 
be added or deleted. Encourage people involved in your project to con-
tinually identify new audiences as they think of them.

58
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
✓ When in doubt, write down a person’s name. Your goal is to avoid 
overlooking someone who may play an important part in your proj-
ect. Identifying a potential audience member doesn’t mean you have 
to involve that person; it simply means you have to consider her. 
Eliminating the name of someone who won’t be involved is a lot easier 
than trying to add the name of someone who should be.
Using an audience list template
An audience list template is a predesigned audience list that contains typical 
categories and audiences for a particular type of project. You may develop 
and maintain your own audience list templates for tasks you perform, func-
tional groups may develop and maintain audience list templates for tasks 
they typically conduct, or your organization’s project management office may 
develop and maintain templates for the entire organization.
Regardless of who maintains the template, it reflects people’s cumulative 
experiences. As the organization continues to perform projects of this type, 
audiences that were overlooked in earlier efforts may be added and audi-
ences that proved unnecessary may be removed. Using these templates can 
save you time and improve your accuracy.
 
Suppose you prepare the budget for your department each quarter. After 
doing a number of these budgets, you know most of the people who give you 
the necessary information, who draft and print the document, and who have 
to approve the final budget. Each time you finish another budget, you revise 
your audience list template to include new information from that project. The 
next time you prepare your quarterly budget, you begin your audience list 
with your template. You then add and subtract names as appropriate for that 
particular budget preparation.
 
When using audience list templates, keep the following guidelines in mind:
 
✓ Develop templates for frequently performed tasks and for entire proj-
ects. Audience list templates for kicking off the annual blood drive or 
submitting a newly developed drug to the Food and Drug Administration 
are valuable. But so are templates for individual tasks that are part of 
these projects, such as awarding a competitive contract or printing a 
document. Many times projects that appear totally new contain some 
tasks that you’ve done before. You can still reap the benefits of your 
prior experience by including the audience list templates for these tasks 
in your overall project audience list.
 
✓ Focus on position descriptions rather than the names of prior audi-
ences. Identify an audience as accounts payable manager rather than Bill 
Miller. People come and go, but functions endure. For each specific proj-
ect, you can fill in the appropriate names.

59
 Chapter 3: Knowing Your Project’s Audience: Involving the Right People
 
✓ Develop and modify your audience list template from previous proj-
ects that actually worked, not from initial plans that looked good but 
lacked key information. Often you develop a detailed audience list at 
the start of your project but don’t revise the list during the project or 
add audiences that you overlooked in your initial planning. If you only 
update your template with information from an initial list, your template 
can’t reflect the discoveries you made throughout the project.
 
✓ Encourage your team to brainstorm possible audiences before you 
show them an existing audience list template. Encouraging people 
to identify audiences without guidance or restrictions increases the 
chances that they’ll think of audiences that were overlooked on previ-
ous projects.
 
✓ Use templates as starting points, not ending points. Make clear to your 
team that the template isn’t the final list. Every project differs in some 
ways from similar ones. If you don’t critically examine the template, you 
may miss people who weren’t involved in previous projects but whom 
you need to consider for this one.
 
✓ Reflect your different project experiences in your audience list tem-
plates. The post-project evaluation is an excellent time to review, cri-
tique, and modify your audience list for a particular project (see Chapter 
15 for details on the post-project evaluation).
 
Templates can save time and improve accuracy. However, starting with a 
template that’s too polished can suggest you’ve already made up your mind 
about the contents of your final list, which may discourage people from freely 
sharing their thoughts about other potential audiences. In addition, their lack 
of involvement in the development of the project’s audience list may lead to 
their lack of commitment to the project’s success.
Considering the Drivers, Supporters, and 
Observers in Your Audience
After identifying everyone in your project audience, it’s time to determine 
which of the following groups they fall into. Then you can decide whether to 
involve them and, if so, how and when.
 
✓ Drivers: People who have some say in defining the results of your proj-
ect. You’re performing your project for these people.
 
✓ Supporters: The people who help you perform your project. Supporters 
include individuals who authorize or provide the resources for your 
project, as well as those who actually work on it.

60
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
✓ Observers: People who are neither drivers nor supporters, but who are 
interested in the activities and results of your project. Observers have 
no say in your project, and they’re not actively involved in it. However, 
your project may affect them at some point in the future.
Separating audiences into these three categories helps you decide what infor-
mation to seek from them and what to share with them, as well as to clarify 
the project decisions in which to involve them.
 
Suppose an information technology group has the job of modifying the layout 
and content of a monthly sales report for all sales representatives. The vice 
president of sales requested the project, and the chief information officer 
(CIO — the boss of the head of the information technology group) approved it. 
As the project manager for this project, consider categorizing your project’s 
audiences as follows:
 
✓ Drivers: The vice president of sales is a driver because he has specific 
reasons for revising the report. The CIO is a potential driver because she 
may hope to develop certain new capabilities for her group through this 
project. Individual sales representatives are all drivers for this project 
because they’ll use the redesigned report to support their work.
 
✓ Supporters: The systems analyst who designs the revised report, the 
training specialist who trains the users, and the vice president of finance 
who authorizes the funds for changing the manual are all supporters.
 
✓ Observers: The head of the customer service department is a potential 
observer because he hopes your project will lead to an improved 
problem-tracking system this year.
Including a project champion
A project champion is a person in a high posi-
tion in the organization who strongly supports 
your project; advocates for your project in dis-
putes, planning meetings, and review sessions; 
and takes whatever actions are necessary to 
help ensure the successful completion of your 
project.
As soon as you start planning, find out whether 
your project has a champion. If it doesn’t, try to 
recruit one. An effective project champion has 
the following characteristics:
 ✓ Sufficient power and authority to resolve 
conflicts over resources, schedules, and 
technical issues
 ✓ A keen interest in the results of your project
 ✓ A willingness to have his or her name cited 
as a strong supporter of your project

61
 Chapter 3: Knowing Your Project’s Audience: Involving the Right People
 
Beware of supporters who try to act like drivers. In the preceding example, the 
analyst who finalizes the content and format of the report may try to include 
certain items that she thinks are helpful. However, only the real drivers should 
determine the specific data that go into the report. The analyst just determines 
whether it’s possible to include the desired data and what doing so will cost.
 
Keep in mind that one person can be both a driver and a supporter. For exam-
ple, the vice president of sales is a driver for the project to develop a revised 
monthly sales report, but he’s also a supporter if he has to transfer funds from 
the sales department budget to pay for developing the report.
The following sections help you identify when you need to involve drivers, 
supporters, and observers, and the best ways to keep them involved.
Deciding when to involve your audiences
Projects pass through the following four stages as they progress from an idea 
to completion (see Chapter 1 for detailed explanations of these stages):
 
✓ Starting the project
 
✓ Organizing and preparing
 
✓ Carrying out the work
 
✓ Closing the project
Plan to involve drivers, supporters, and observers in each stage of your proj-
ect’s life cycle. The following sections tell you how you can do so.
Drivers
Involve drivers from the start to the finish of your project. Keeping them 
involved is critical because they define what your project should produce, 
and they evaluate your project’s success when it’s finished. Check out Table 
3-2 to see how to keep drivers involved during the four stages of your project.
Table 3-2

Identify and speak with as many drivers as possible. 
Their desires and your assessment of feasibility can 
influence whether you should pursue the project. If 
you uncover additional drivers later, explore with them 
the issues that led to the project; ask them to identify 
and assess any special expectations they may have.

As the project gets under way, announce and 
introduce the drivers to the project team. Having 
the drivers talk about their needs and interests rein-
forces the importance of the project and helps team 
members form a more accurate picture of project 
goals. Also, having the drivers meet team members 
increases the drivers’ confidence that the members 
can successfully complete the project.
While performing the project work, keep drivers 
apprised of project accomplishments and progress 
to sustain their ongoing interest and enthusiasm. 
Involving drivers in this way also allows you to con-
firm that the results are meeting their needs.
Closing the 
project
Heavy
Have drivers assess the project’s results and deter-
mine whether their needs and expectations were 
met. Identify their recommendations for improving 
performance on similar projects in the future.
Supporters
Just as with drivers, involve supporters from start to finish. Because they 
perform and support the project work, they need to know about changing 
requirements so they can promptly identify and address problems. Keeping 
them actively involved also sustains their ongoing motivation and com-
mitment to the project. Check out Table 3-3 to see how to keep supporters 
involved during your project’s four stages.

Supporters are the major contributors to the 
project plan. Because they facilitate or do all the 
work, have them determine necessary technical 
approaches, schedules, and resources. Also have 
them formally commit to all aspects of the plan.
Carrying out 
the work
Heavy
Familiarize all supporters with the planned work. 
Clarify how the supporters will work together to 
achieve the results. Have supporters decide how 
they’ll communicate, resolve conflicts, and make 
decisions throughout the project.
Throughout the project, keep supporters informed 
of project progress, encourage them to identify per-
formance problems they encounter or anticipate, 
and work with them to develop and implement solu-
tions to these problems.
Closing the 
project 
Heavy
Have supporters conclude their different tasks. 
Inform them of project accomplishments and rec-
ognize their roles in project achievements. Elicit 
their suggestions for handling similar projects more 
effectively in the future.
Observers
After you choose the observers with whom you want to actively share proj-
ect information, involve them minimally throughout the project because they 
neither tell you what should be done nor help you do it. Table 3-4 shows how 
you may keep observers involved.
 
Because observers don’t directly influence or affect your project, be sure to 
carefully manage the time and effort you spend sharing information with them. 
When deciding whom to involve and how to share information with them, con-
sider the following:
 
✓ Their level of interest in your project
 
✓ The likelihood that your project will affect them at some point in the 
future
 
✓ The need to maintain a good working relationship with them 
See the section “Assessing Your Audience’s Power and Interest” later in this 
chapter for information on what to consider when deciding how to involve 
different audiences.

Using different methods to keep 
your audiences involved
Keeping drivers, supporters, and observers informed as you progress in your 
project is critical to the project’s success. Choosing the right method for 
involving each audience group can stimulate that group’s continued interest 
and encourage its members to actively support your work. Consider the fol-
lowing approaches for keeping your project audiences involved throughout 
your project:
 
✓ One-on-one meetings: One-on-one meetings (formal or informal discus-
sions with one or two other people about project issues) are particularly 
useful for interactively exploring and clarifying special issues of interest 
with a small number of people.
 
✓ Group meetings: These meetings are planned sessions for some or all 
team members or audiences. Smaller meetings are useful to brainstorm 
project issues, reinforce team member roles, and develop mutual trust 
and respect among team members. Larger meetings are useful to pres-
ent information of general interest.
 
✓ Informal written correspondence: Informal written correspondence 
(notes, memos, letters, and e-mails) helps you document informal dis-
cussions and share important project information.
 
✓ More formal information-sharing vehicles: Information resources, such 
as project newsletters or sites on the organization’s intranet, may be 
useful for sharing nonconfidential and noncontroversial information 
with larger audiences.

65
 Chapter 3: Knowing Your Project’s Audience: Involving the Right People
 
✓ Written approvals: Written approvals (such as a technical approach 
to project work or formal agreements about a product, schedule, 
or resource commitment) serve as records of project decisions and 
achievements.
See Chapter 13 for additional information on sharing information about your 
project’s ongoing performance.
Making the most of your 
audience’s involvement
To maximize your audiences’ involvement and contributions, consider the 
following guidelines throughout your project:
 
✓ Involve audiences early in the project planning if they have a role 
later on. Give your audiences the option to participate in planning even 
if they don’t perform until later in the project. Sometimes they can share 
information that’ll make their tasks easier. At the least, they can reserve 
time to provide their services when you need them.
 
✓ If you’re concerned with the legality of involving a specific audience, 
check with your legal department or contracts office. Suppose you’re 
planning to award a competitive contract to buy certain equipment. You 
want to know whether prospective bidders typically have this equip-
ment on hand and how long it’ll take to receive it after you award the 
contract. However, you’re concerned that speaking to potential contrac-
tors in the planning stage may tip them off about the procurement and 
lead to charges of favoritism by unsuccessful bidders who didn’t know 
about the procurement in advance.
 
 Instead of ignoring this important audience, check with your contracts 
office or legal department to determine how you can get the information 
you want and still maintain the integrity of the bidding process.
 
✓ Develop a plan with all key audiences to meet their information needs 
and interests as well as yours. Determine the information they want and 
the information you believe they need. Also decide when to provide that 
information and in what format. Finally, clarify what you want from them 
and how and when they can provide it.
 
✓ Always be sure you understand each audience’s What’s In It For Me 
(WIIFM). Clarify why it’s in each audience’s interest to see your proj-
ect succeed. Throughout your project, keep reminding your audiences 
of the benefits they’ll realize when your project’s complete and the 
progress your project has made toward achieving those benefits. Find 
out more about identifying project benefits for different audiences in 
Chapter 14.

66
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
Confirming Your Audience’s Authority
In project terms, authority refers to the overall right to make project deci-
sions that others must follow, including the right to apply project resources, 
expend funds, or give approvals. Having opinions about how an aspect should 
be addressed is different from having the authority to decide how it will be 
addressed. Mistaking a person’s level of authority can lead to frustration, as 
well as wasted time and money.
 
Confirm that the people you’ve identified as audiences have the authority to 
make the decisions they need to make to perform their tasks. If they don’t 
have that authority, find out who does and how to bring those people into 
the process.
At the beginning of the carrying out the work stage in your projects, take the 
following steps to define each audience member’s authority:
 
1. Clarify each audience member’s tasks and decisions.
 
 Define with each person his tasks and his role in those tasks. For exam-
ple, will he just work on the task, or will he also approve the schedules, 
resource expenditures, and work approaches?
 
2. Ask each audience member what his authority is regarding each deci-
sion and task.
 
 Ask about individual tasks rather than all issues in a particular area. For 
example, a person can be more confident about his authority to approve 
supply purchases up to $5,000 than about his authority to approve all 
equipment purchases, no matter the type or amount.
 
 
Clarify decisions that the audience member can make himself. For deci-
sions needing someone else’s approval, find out whose approval he 
needs. (Ask, never assume!)
 
3. Ask each audience member how he knows what authority he has.
 
 Does a written policy, procedure, or guideline confirm the authority? Did 
the person’s boss tell him in conversation? Is the person just assuming? 
If the person has no specific confirming information, encourage him to 
get it.
 
4. Check out each audience member’s history of exercising authority.
 
 Have you or other people worked with this person in the past? Has he 
been overruled on decisions that he said he was authorized to make? If 
so, ask him why he believes he won’t be similarly overruled this time.
 
5. Verify whether anything has recently changed regarding each audi-
ence member’s authority.

67
 Chapter 3: Knowing Your Project’s Audience: Involving the Right People
 
 Is there any reason to believe that this person’s authority has changed? 
Is the person new to his current group? To his current position? Has 
the person recently started working for a new boss? If any of these situ-
ations exists, encourage the person to find specific documentation to 
confirm his authority for his benefit as well as yours.
 
Reconfirm the information in these steps when a particular audience’s 
decision-making assignments change. Suppose, for example, that you initially 
expect all individual purchases on your project to be at or under $2,500. Bill, 
the team representative from the finance group, assures you that he has the 
authority to approve such purchases for your project without checking with 
his boss. Midway through the project, you find that you have to purchase a 
piece of equipment for $5,000. Be sure to verify with Bill that he can person-
ally authorize this larger expenditure. If he can’t, find out whose approval you 
need and plan how to get it.
Assessing Your Audience’s 
Power and Interest
An audience’s potential impact on a project depends on the power it has to 
exercise and the interest it has in exercising that power. Assessing the rela-
tive levels of each helps you decide with whom you should spend your time 
and effort to realize the greatest benefits.
Power is a person’s ability to influence the actions of others. This ability 
can derive either from the direct authority the person has to require people 
to respond to her requests (ascribed power; see the previous section and 
Chapter 10 for more about authority) or the ability she has to induce others 
to do what she asks because of the respect they have for her professionally 
or their affinity for her as a person (achieved power). (See Chapter 14 for 
more information.) In either case, the more power a person has, the better 
able she is to marshal people and resources to support your project.
On the other hand, a person’s interest in something is how much she cares or 
is curious about it or how much she pays attention to it. The more interested 
a person is in your project, the more likely she is to want to use her power to 
help the project succeed.
You can define an audience’s relative levels of power and interest related 
to your project as being either high or low. You then have four possible 
combinations for each audience’s relative levels of power and interest. The 
particular values of an audience’s power and interest ratings suggest the 
chances that the audience may have a significant impact on your project and, 
therefore, the relative importance of keeping that audience interested and 
involved in your project.

68
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
Most often you base the assessments of an audience’s power over and inter-
est in your project on the aggregated individual, subjective opinions of you, 
your team members, members of your project’s other audiences, people who 
have worked with the audience on other projects, subject matter experts, 
and/or members of the audience themselves. If you assign a value of 1 to each 
individual rating of high and 0 to each individual rating of low, you’d rate an 
audience’s power or interest as high if the resulting average of the individual 
assessments were 0.5 or greater and low if it were below 0.5. 
Typically, drivers and supporters have higher levels of power over your proj-
ect than observers.
 
Figure 3-1 depicts a Power-Interest Grid, which represents these four pos-
sible power-interest combinations as distinct quadrants on a two-dimensional 
graph. As the project manager, you should spend a minimal amount of time 
and effort with audiences who have low levels of both power and interest 
(Quadrant I), increasingly greater amounts of time and effort with audiences 
that have a low level of power and a high level of interest (Quadrant II) and a 
low level of interest and a high level of power (Quadrant III), respectively. You 
should spend the most time and effort keeping audiences with high degrees 
of both power and interest (Quadrant IV) informed and involved. (Check out 
Chapter 13 for different ways to communicate with your project’s audiences.)

Developing Your Game Plan: 
Getting from Here to There
In This Chapter
▶ Dividing your work into manageable pieces
▶ Developing and displaying a Work Breakdown Structure
▶ Dealing with unknown circumstances and documenting what you need to know
T
he keys to successful project planning and performance are complete-
ness and continuity. You want to identify all important information in 
your project plan and address all aspects of your plan during project 
performance.
Describing in detail all the work required to complete your project helps 
you accomplish these tasks. Your description of project work provides the 
basis for scheduling and resource planning, defining roles and responsibili-
ties, assigning work to team members, capturing key project performance 
data, and reporting on completed project work. This chapter helps you break 
down your project work into manageable pieces.
Divide and Conquer: Working on Your 
Project in Manageable Chunks
Two of my major concerns when I start a new project are remembering to 
plan for all important pieces of work and accurately estimating the time and 
resources required to perform that work. To address both issues, I develop a 
logical framework to define all work that’s necessary to complete the project.
A while back, a friend who loves jigsaw puzzles told me about an acquain-
tance who had asked him to assemble a 5,000-piece puzzle of the United 
States. When his acquaintance suggested that, before he start, he determine 
whether any pieces were missing and, if so, which ones, my friend laughed. 

72
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
He always found out this information by trying to assemble the puzzle and 
noting any holes that remained after he’d used all the available pieces. How 
else could he do it?
 
You’ve probably had a similar puzzle-like experience with your project assign-
ments. Suppose you’re asked to design and present a training program. You 
and a colleague work intensely for a couple of months developing the content 
and materials, arranging for the facilities, and inviting the participants. A week 
before the session, you ask your colleague whether he’s made arrangements 
to print the training manuals. He says that he thought you were dealing with 
it, and you say that you thought he was dealing with it. Unfortunately, neither 
of you arranged to have the manuals printed because you each thought the 
other person was handling it. Now you have a training session in a week, and 
you don’t have the time or money to print the needed training notebooks.
How can you avoid situations like this one in the future? By using a struc-
tured approach in the organizing and preparing stage of your project to 
identify all required project work. The following sections explain how to 
accomplish this task by subdividing project intermediate and final products 
into finer levels of detail and specifying the work required to produce them.
Thinking in detail
The most important guideline to remember when identifying and describing 
project work is this: Think in detail! In my experience, people consistently 
underestimate the time and resources they need for their project work 
because they just don’t recognize everything they have to do to complete it.
 
Suppose you have to prepare a report of your team’s most recent meeting. 
Based on your past experience with preparing many similar reports, you 
quickly figure it’ll take a few days to do this one. But how confident are you 
that this estimate is correct? Are you sure you’ve considered all the differ-
ent work that writing this particular report will entail? Will the differences 
between this report and others you’ve worked on mean more time and more 
work for you? How can you tell?
 
The best way to determine how long and how much work a project will take 
to complete is to break down the required project work into its component 
deliverables, a process called decomposition. (A deliverable is an intermediate 
or final product, service, and/or result your project will produce. See Chapter 2 
for more information on project deliverables, or objectives as they’re often 
called.)
The greater the detail in which you decompose a project, the less likely 
you are to overlook anything significant. For example, creating the report 
in the preceding illustration actually entails producing three separate deliver-
ables: a draft, reviews of the draft, and the final version. Completing the 
final version of the report, in turn, entails producing two deliverables: the 

73
 Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There
handwritten version and the printed version. By decomposing the project 
into the deliverables necessary to generate the final report, you’re more 
likely to identify all the work you need to do to complete the project.
 
Observe the following two guidelines when decomposing your project:
 
✓ Allow no gaps: Identify all components of the deliverable you’re decom-
posing. In the example of creating a meeting report, if you have allowed 
no gaps, you’ll have the desired final product in hand after you’ve pro-
duced the draft, the reviews of the draft, and the final version. However, 
if you feel that you’ll have to do additional work to transform these three 
subproducts into a final product, you need to define the subproduct(s) 
that this additional work will produce.
 
✓ Allow no overlaps: Don’t include the same subproduct in your decom-
position of two or more different deliverables. For example, don’t 
include completed reviews of the draft by your boss and the vice presi-
dent of your department as parts of the draft (the first deliverable) if 
you’ve already included them with all other reviews under reviews of 
the draft (the second deliverable).
 
The first guideline — allow no gaps — is also referred to as the 100% rule. This 
rule states that the components of a project include 100% of the work and all 
the deliverables required by the project scope and do not include any work or 
deliverables that fall outside of the project scope. This rule applies at all levels 
within the hierarchy.
Specifying the parts and subparts of your project in this way decreases the 
chance that you’ll overlook something significant, which will help you develop 
more accurate estimates of the time and resources needed to do the project.
Thinking of hierarchy with the help 
of a Work Breakdown Structure
Thinking in detail is critical when you’re planning your project, but you also 
need to consider the big picture. If you fail to identify a major part of your 
project’s work, you won’t have the chance to detail it! Thus, you must be 
both comprehensive and specific.
 
My friend’s jigsaw puzzle dilemma (refer to this section’s intro) suggests an 
approach that can help you achieve your goal. He can count the pieces before 
assembling the puzzle to determine whether any piece is missing. However, 
knowing that he has only 4,999 pieces can’t help him determine which piece 
is missing. He needs to divide the 5,000 pieces into smaller groups that he 
can examine and understand. Consider that he divides the puzzle of the 
United States into 50 separate 100-piece puzzles, one for each of the 50 states. 
Because he knows the United States has 50 states, he’s confident that each 
piece of the puzzle should be in one and only one box.

74
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
Suppose he takes it a step further and divides each state into four quadrants 
each comprised of 25 pieces. Again, he can count the pieces in each box to 
see whether any are missing. However, determining which one of 25 pieces 
is missing from the northeast sector of New Jersey is easier than figuring out 
which piece is missing from the 5,000-piece puzzle of the entire United States.
Figure 4-1 shows how you can depict necessary project work in a Work 
Breakdown Structure (WBS), a deliverable-oriented, hierarchical decomposi-
tion of the work required to achieve a project’s objectives and produce the 
required project products.
 
The different WBS levels have had many different names. The top element is 
typically called a project and the lowest level of detail is typically called a work 
package. However, the levels in between have been called phases, subprojects, 
work assignments, tasks, subtasks, and deliverables. In this book, the top-level 
box (the Level 1 component) is a project, the lowest-level of detail is a work 
package, and the elements in between are Level 2 components, Level 3 com-
ponents, and so forth. A work package is comprised of activities that must be 
performed to produce the deliverable it represents. 
Specifically, Figure 4-1 shows that the entire project, represented as a Level 1 
component, can be subdivided into Level 2 components, and some or all 
Level 2 components can be subdivided into Level 3 components. You can 
continue to subdivide all the components you create in the same manner 
until you reach a point at which you think the components you defined are 
sufficiently detailed for planning and management purposes. These Level “n” 
components, where n is the number of the lowest-level component in a par-
ticular WBS branch, are called work packages.

Suppose you’re responsible for creating and presenting a new training pro-
gram for your organization. To get started, you’d develop a WBS for this proj-
ect as follows:
 
1. Determine the major deliverables or products to be produced.
 
 Ask yourself, “What major intermediate or final products or deliverables 
must be produced to achieve the project’s objectives?”

75
 Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There
 
 You may identify the following items:
 
• Training program needs statement
 
• Training program design
 
• Participant notebooks
 
• Trained instructor
 
• Program testing
 
• Training program presentation
 
2. Divide each of these major deliverables into its component deliver-
ables in the same manner.
 
 Choose any one of these deliverables to begin with. Suppose you choose 
Training program needs statement.
 
 Ask, “What intermediate deliverables must I have so I can create the 
needs statement?”
 
 You may determine that you require the following:
 
• Interviews of potential participants
 
• A review of materials discussing the needs for the program
 
• A report summarizing the needs this program will address
 
3. Divide each of these work pieces into its component parts.
 
 Suppose you choose to start with Interviews of potential participants.
 
 Ask, “What deliverables must I have to complete these interviews?”
 
 You may decide that you have to produce the following deliverables:
 
• Selected interviewees
 
• Interview questionnaire
 
• Interview schedule
 
• Completed interviews
 
• Report of interview findings
 
 But why stop here? You can break each of these five items into finer 
detail and then break those pieces into even finer detail. How far should 
you go? The following sections can help you answer that question.
Asking four key questions
 
Determining how much detail you need isn’t a trivial task. You want to 
describe your work in sufficient detail to support accurate planning and mean-
ingful tracking. But the benefits of this detail must justify the additional time 
you spend developing and maintaining your plans and reporting your prog-
ress. Asking the following four questions about each WBS component can help 
you decide whether you’ve defined it in enough detail:

76
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
✓ Do you require two or more intermediate deliverables to produce this 
deliverable?
 
✓ Can you accurately estimate the resources you’ll need to perform the 
work to produce this deliverable? (Resources include personnel, equip-
ment, raw materials, money, facilities, information, and so on.)
 
✓ Can you accurately estimate how long it will take to produce this 
deliverable?
 
✓ If you have to assign the work to produce this deliverable to someone 
else, are you confident that person will understand exactly what to do?
If you answer yes to the first question or no to any one of the other three, 
break down the deliverable into the components necessary to produce it.
Your answers to these questions depend on how familiar you are with the 
work, how critical the activity is to the success of your project, what happens 
if something goes wrong, whom you may assign to perform the activity, how 
well you know that person, and so on. In other words, the correct level of 
detail for your WBS depends on your judgment.
 
If you’re a little uneasy about answering these four questions, try this even 
simpler test: Subdivide your WBS component into additional deliverables if 
you think either of the following situations applies:
 
✓ The component will take much longer than two calendar weeks to 
complete.
 
✓ The component will require much more than 80 person-hours to 
complete.
Remember that these estimates are just guidelines. For example, if you esti-
mate it’ll take two weeks and two days to prepare a report — you’ve prob-
ably provided sufficient detail. But if you figure it’ll take two to three months 
to finalize requirements for your new product, you need to break the deliver-
able finalized requirements into more detail because
 
✓ Experience has shown that there can be so many different interpreta-
tions of what is supposed to occur during these two to three months 
that you can’t be sure your time and resource estimates are correct, and 
you can’t confidently assign the task to someone to perform.
 
✓ You don’t want to wait two or three months to confirm that work is on 
schedule by verifying that a desired product has been produced on time.
Making assumptions to clarify planned work
Sometimes you haven’t defined the work in sufficient detail, but certain 
unknowns stop you from defining it further. How do you resolve this 
dilemma? You make assumptions regarding the unknowns. If, during the 
course of your project, you find that any of your assumptions are wrong, you 
can change your plan to reflect the correct information.

77
 Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There
For example, suppose you decide that the Completed interviews deliverable 
from Step 3 in the example to develop and present a new training program 
introduced earlier in this section needs more detail so you can estimate its 
required time and resources. However, you don’t know how to break it down 
further because you don’t know how many people you’ll interview or how 
many separate sets of interviews you’ll conduct. If you assume you’ll inter-
view five groups of seven people each, you can then develop specific plans 
for arranging and conducting each of these sessions. In most situations, it’s 
best to consider a guess in the middle of the possible range. To determine 
how sensitive your results are to the different values, you may want to ana-
lyze several different assumptions.
 
Be sure to write your assumption down so you remember to change your plan 
if you conduct more or less than five interview sessions. See the discussion in 
Chapter 2 for more information about detailing assumptions.
Using action verbs to describe activities
Use action verbs when framing the titles of the activities that comprise a 
work package to clarify the nature of the work they entail. Action verbs can 
improve your time and resource estimates, your work assignments to team 
members, and your tracking and reporting because they provide a clear pic-
ture of what an activity entails.
 
Consider the assignment to prepare a report after a team meeting. Suppose 
you choose Draft Report to be one of its work packages. If you don’t break 
down Draft Report further, you haven’t indicated clearly whether it includes 
any or all of the following actions:
 
✓ Collecting information for the draft
 
✓ Determining length and format expectations and restrictions
 
✓ Handwriting the draft
 
✓ Reviewing the draft yourself before officially circulating it to others
But, if you simply word the work package Design and handwrite the draft 
report — voilà! Your scope of work is instantly clearer. A few well-chosen 
words at this level go a long way.
Using a WBS for large and small projects
You need to develop a WBS for very large projects, very small projects, and 
everything in between. Building a skyscraper, designing a new airplane, 
researching and developing a new drug, and revamping your organization’s 
information systems all need a WBS. So, too, do writing a report, schedul-
ing and conducting a meeting, coordinating your organization’s annual 
blood drive, and moving into your new office. The size of the WBS may vary 
immensely depending on the project, but the hierarchical scheme used to 
develop each one is the same.

Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
Conducting a survey: Using the 
Work Breakdown Structure
Suppose your boss asks you to estimate how 
long it’ll take to survey people regarding the 
characteristics a new product your company 
may develop should have. Based on your expe-
rience with doing similar types of assessments 
in the past, you figure you’ll need to contact 
people at the company headquarters, at two 
regional activity centers, and from a sampling 
of current clients. You tell your boss the proj-
ect will take you between one and six months 
to complete.
Have you ever noticed that bosses aren’t happy 
when you respond to their question of “How 
long will it take?” with an answer of “Between 
one and six months”? You figure that finishing 
anytime before six months meets your promise, 
but your boss expects you can be done in one 
month, given some (okay, a lot of) hard work. 
The truth is, though, you don’t have a clue how 
long the survey will take because you have no 
idea how much work you’ll have to do to com-
plete it.
Developing a WBS encourages you to define 
exactly what you have to do and, correspond-
ingly, improves your estimate of how long each 
step will take. In this example, you decide 
to conduct three different surveys: personal 
interviews with people at your headquarters, 
phone conference calls with people at the two 
regional activity centers, and a mail survey of a 
sample of your company’s clients. Realizing you 
need to describe each survey in more detail, 
you begin by considering the mail survey and 
decide it includes five deliverables:
 ✓ A sample of clients to survey: You figure 
you need one week to select your sample 
of clients if the sales department has a 
current record of all company clients. You 
check with that department, and, thankfully, 
it does.
 ✓ A survey questionnaire: As far as this deliv-
erable is concerned, you get lucky. A col-
league tells you she thinks that the company 
conducted a similar survey of a different 
target population a year ago and that extra 
questionnaires from that effort may still be 
around. You find that a local warehouse has 
1,000 of these questionnaires and —yes! — 
they’re perfect for your survey. How much 
time do you need to allow for designing and 
printing the questionnaires? Zero!
 ✓ Survey responses: You determine you’ll 
need a response rate of at least 70 percent 
for the results to be valid. You consult with 
people who’ve done these types of sur-
veys before and find out that, to have an 
acceptable chance of achieving a minimum 
response rate of 70 percent, you have to 
use the following three-phased approach:
1.  Initial mailing out and receiving of 
questionnaires (estimated time = 
four weeks)
2.  Second mailing out and receiving of 
questionnaires to nonrespondents 
(estimated time = four weeks)
3.  Phone follow-ups with people who 
still haven’t responded, encourag-
ing them to complete and return 
their surveys (estimated time = two 
weeks)
 ✓ Data analyses: You figure you’ll need about 
two weeks to enter and analyze the data 
you expect to receive.
 ✓ A final report: You estimate it’ll take two 
weeks to prepare the final report.

79
 Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There
 
Occasionally your detailed WBS may seem to make your project more com-
plex than it really is. I agree that 100 tasks (not to mention 10,000) written out 
can be a little unnerving! However, the WBS doesn’t create a project’s com-
plexity; the WBS just displays it. In fact, by clearly portraying all aspects of 
your project work, the WBS actually simplifies your project.
Check out the sidebar “Conducting a survey: Using the Work Breakdown 
Structure” for an illustration of how a WBS helps you develop a more accu-
rate estimate of the time you need to complete your work.
Dealing with special situations
With a little bit of thought, you can break most WBS elements into compo-
nents. However, this section looks a little more closely at several special situ-
ations that require some creativity.
Representing conditionally repeating work
Suppose your project contains a deliverable that requires an unknown 
number of repetitive cycles to produce, such as getting a report approved. 
In reality, you write the report and submit it for review and approval. If the 
reviewers approve the report, you proceed to the next phase of your proj-
ect (such as distributing the report). But if the reviewers don’t approve the 
report, you have to revise it to incorporate their comments and then resub-
mit it for a second review and approval. If they approve the second draft, you 
proceed to the next phase of your project. But if they still don’t approve that 
draft, you have to repeat the process (or try to catch them in a better mood).
 
Revising the draft is conditional work; it will only be done if a certain condition 
(in the report example, not receiving the reviewers’ approval) comes to pass. 
Unfortunately, a WBS doesn’t include conditional work — you plan to perform 
every piece of work you detail in your WBS. However, you can represent con-
ditional work in the following two ways:
Now, instead of one to six months, you can esti-
mate the time you need to complete your mail 
survey to be 15 weeks. Because you’ve clarified 
the work you have to do and how you’ll do it, 
you’re more confident you can reach your goal, 
and you’ve increased the chances that you will!
Note: To develop the most accurate estimates 
of your project’s duration, in addition to the 
nature of the work you do, you need to con-
sider the types and amounts of resources you 
require, together with their capacities and 
availabilities (see Chapter 5 for more on how 
to estimate durations). However, this example 
illustrates that using just a WBS to refine the 
definition of your project’s work components 
significantly improves your estimates.

80
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
✓ You can define a single deliverable as Approved report and assign it a 
duration. In effect, you’re saying that you can create as many Reviewed 
but not approved versions of the report as necessary (each of which is an 
intermediate deliverable) to obtain the final reviewed and approved ver-
sion within the established time period.
 
✓ You can assume that you’ll need a certain number of revisions and 
include the intermediate deliverable created after each one (a differ-
ent Reviewed but not approved version of the report) in your WBS. 
This approach allows more meaningful tracking.
 
Whichever approach you choose, be sure to document it in your project plan.
Assuming that your project needs three reviews and two revisions doesn’t 
guarantee that your draft will be good to go only after the third review. If 
your draft is approved after the first review, congratulations! You can move 
on to the next piece of work immediately (that is, you don’t perform two revi-
sions just because the plan assumed you would have to!).
However, if you still haven’t received approval after the third review, you 
continue to revise it and submit it for further review until you do get the seal 
of approval you need. Of course, then you have to reexamine your plan to 
determine the impact of the additional reviews and revisions on the schedule 
and budget of future project activities.
 
A plan isn’t a guarantee of the future; it’s your statement of what you’ll work to 
achieve. If you’re unable to accomplish any part of your plan, you must revise 
it accordingly (and promptly).
Handling work with no obvious break points
Sometimes you can’t see how to break a piece of work into two-week inter-
vals. Other times that detail just doesn’t seem necessary. Even in these situ-
ations, however, you want to divide the work into smaller chunks to remind 
yourself to periodically verify that your current schedule and resource esti-
mates are still valid.
Check out the sidebar “Keeping a close eye on your project” for an illustra-
tion of why it’s important to have frequent milestones to support project 
tracking and how to deal with WBS components that have no obvious break 
points.
 
No matter how carefully you plan, something unanticipated can always occur. 
The sooner you find out about such an occurrence, the more time you have to 
minimize any negative impact on your project.

81
 Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There
Planning a long-term project
A long-term project presents an entirely different challenge. Often the work you 
perform a year or more in the future depends on the results of the work you do 
between now and then. Even if you can accurately predict the work you’ll per-
form later, the farther into the future you plan, the more likely it is that some-
thing will change and require you to modify your plans.
 
When developing a WBS for a long-term project, use a rolling-wave approach, 
in which you continually refine your plans throughout the life of your project 
as you discover more about the project and its environment. This approach 
acknowledges that uncertainties may limit your plan’s initial detail and accu-
racy, and it encourages you to reflect more accurate information in your plans 
as soon as you discover it. Apply the rolling-wave approach to your long-term 
project by taking the following steps:
 
1. Break down the first three months’ work into components that take 
two weeks or less to complete.
 
2. Plan the remainder of the project in less detail, perhaps describ-
ing the work in packages you estimate to take between one and two 
months to complete.
Keeping a close eye on your project
A number of years back, I met a young engineer 
at one of my training sessions. Soon after he 
joined his organization, he was asked to design 
and build a piece of equipment for a client. He 
submitted a purchase request to his procure-
ment department for the raw materials he 
needed and was told that, if they didn’t arrive 
by the promised delivery date in six months, 
he should notify the procurement specialist 
he was working with so she could investigate 
the situation. He was uneasy about waiting six 
months without checking periodically to see 
whether everything was still on schedule, but 
being young, inexperienced, and new to the 
organization, he wasn’t comfortable trying to 
fight this established procedure. So he waited 
six months.
When he didn’t receive his raw materials by the 
promised delivery date, he notified the procure-
ment specialist, who, in turn, checked with the 
vendor. It turned out that there had been a major 
fire in the vendor’s facilities five months earlier 
and that production had just resumed the previ-
ous week. The vendor estimated his materials 
would be shipped in about five months!
I suggested that he could’ve divided the wait-
ing time into one-month intervals and called 
the vendor at the end of each month to see 
whether anything had occurred that changed 
the projected delivery date. Although checking 
periodically wouldn’t have prevented the fire, 
he would’ve known about it five months sooner 
and could’ve made other plans immediately. 
(See Chapter 8 for more information on how to 
deal with risk and uncertainty in your projects.)

82
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
3. Revise your initial plan at the end of the first three months to detail 
your work for the next three months in components that take two 
weeks or less to complete.
 
4. Modify any future work as necessary, based on the results of your first 
three months’ work.
 
5. Continue revising your plan in this way throughout the project.
Creating and Displaying Your 
Work Breakdown Structure
You can use several different schemes to develop and display your project’s 
WBS, and each one can be effective under different circumstances. This sec-
tion looks at a few of those different schemes and provides some examples 
and advice on how and when to apply them.
Considering different schemes 
for organizing your WBS
You can use many different schemes to subdivide project work into WBS 
components; the following are five possible ones with examples of each:
 
✓ Product components: Floor plan, training manuals, or screen design
 
✓ Functions: Design, launch, review, or test
 
✓ Project phases: Initiation, design, or construction
 
✓ Geographical areas: Region 1 or the northwest
 
✓ Organizational units: Marketing, operations, or facilities
Project phases, product components, and functions are the most often used.
 
When you choose a scheme to organize the subelements of a WBS component, 
continue to use that same scheme to define all subelements under that WBS 
component to prevent possible overlap in categories. For example, consider 
that you want to develop finer detail for the WBS component titled Report. You 
may choose to break out the detail according to function, such as Draft report, 
Reviews of draft report, and Final report. Or you may choose to break it out by 
product component, such as Section 1, Section 2, and Section 3.

83
 Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There
 
Don’t define Report’s subelements by using some items from both schemes, 
such as Section 1, Section 2, Reviews of draft report, and Final report. Combining 
schemes in this way increases the chances of either including work twice or 
overlooking it completely. For example, the work to prepare the final version 
of Section 2 could be included in either of two subelements: Section 2 or Final 
report.
 
Consider the following questions when choosing a scheme:
 
✓ What higher-level milestones will be most meaningful when reporting 
progress? For example, is it more helpful to report that Section 1 is com-
pleted or that the entire Draft report is done?
 
✓ How will you assign responsibility? For example, is one person respon-
sible for the draft, reviews, and final report of Section 1, or is one person 
responsible for the drafts of Sections 1, 2, and 3?
 
✓ How will you and your team members actually do the work? For exam-
ple, is the drafting, reviewing, and finalizing of Section 1 separate from 
the same activities for Section 2, or are all chapters drafted together, 
reviewed together, and finalized together?
Using different approaches 
to develop your WBS
How you develop your WBS depends on how familiar you and your team 
are with your project, whether similar projects have been successfully 
performed in the past, and how many new methods and approaches you’ll 
use. Choose one of the following two approaches for developing your WBS 
depending on your project’s characteristics:
 
✓ Top-down: Start at the top level in the hierarchy and systematically 
break WBS elements into their component parts.
 
 This approach is useful when you have a good idea of the project work 
involved before the actual work begins. The top-down approach ensures 
that you thoroughly consider each category at each level, and it reduces 
the chances that you overlook work in any of your categories.
 
✓ Brainstorming: Generate all possible work and deliverables for this proj-
ect and then group them into categories.
 
 Brainstorming is helpful when you don’t have a clear sense of a project’s 
required work at the outset. This approach encourages you to generate 
any and all possible pieces of work that may have to be done, without 
worrying about how to organize them in the final WBS. After you decide 
that a proposed piece of work is a necessary part of the project, you can 
identify any related work that is also required.

84
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
Whichever approach you decide to use, consider using stick-on notes to sup-
port your WBS development. As you identify pieces of work, write them on the 
notes and put them on the wall. Add, remove, and regroup the notes as you 
continue to think through your work. This approach encourages open sharing 
of ideas and helps all people appreciate — in detail — the nature of the work 
that needs to be done.
The top-down approach
Use the following top-down approach for projects that you or others are 
familiar with:
 
1. Specify all Level 2 components for the entire project.
 
2. Determine all necessary Level 3 components for each Level 2 
component.
 
3. Specify the Level 4 components for each Level 3 component as 
necessary.
 
4. Continue in this way until you’ve detailed all project deliverables and 
work components completely. The lowest-level components in each 
WBS chain are your project’s work packages.
The brainstorming approach
Use the following brainstorming approach for projects involving untested 
methods or for projects you and your team members aren’t familiar with:
 
1. Write down all deliverables and components of work that you think 
your project entails.
 
 Don’t worry about overlap or level of detail.
 
 Don’t discuss wording or other details of the work items.
 
 Don’t make any judgments about the appropriateness of the work.
 
2. Group these items into a few major categories with common character-
istics and eliminate any deliverables or work components that aren’t 
required.
 
 These groups are your Level 2 categories.
 
3. Divide the deliverables and work components under each Level 2 cat-
egory into groups with common characteristics.
 
 These groups are your Level 3 categories.
 
4. Now use the top-down method to identify any additional deliverables 
or work components that you overlooked in the categories you 
created.
 
5. Continue in this manner until you’ve described all project deliver-
ables and work components completely. The lowest-level components 
in each WBS chain are your project’s work packages.

85
 Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There
Considering different ways to categorize 
your project’s work
Although you eventually want to use only one WBS for your project, early 
in the development of your WBS, you can look at two or more different hier-
archical schemes. Considering your project from two or more perspectives 
helps you identify work you may have overlooked.
 
Suppose a local community wants to open a halfway house for substance abus-
ers. Figures 4-2 and 4-3 depict two different schemes to categorize the work for 
this community-based treatment facility. The first scheme classifies the work 
by product component, and the second classifies the work by function:
 
✓ Figure 4-2 defines the following components as Level 2 categories: staff, 
facility, residents (people who’ll be living at the facility and receiving 
services), and community training.
 
✓ Figure 4-3 defines the following functions as Level 2 categories: planning, 
recruiting, buying, and training.

Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
Both WBSs contain the same lowest-level components or work packages.
When you think about your project in terms of major functions (rather than 
final product components), you realize that you forgot the following work:
 
✓ Planning for staff recruiting
 
✓ Buying staff supplies
 
✓ Planning for your community training
After you identify the work components you overlooked, you can include 
them in either of the two WBSs.
 
Be sure you choose only one WBS before you leave your project’s planning 
phase. Nothing confuses people faster than trying to use two or more different 
WBSs to describe the same project.
Labeling your WBS entries
As the size of a project grows, its WBS becomes increasingly complex. Losing 
sight of how a particular piece of work relates to other parts of the project 
is easy to do. Unfortunately, this problem can lead to poor coordination 
between related work efforts and a lack of urgency on the part of people who 
must perform the work.
 
Figure 4-4 illustrates a scheme for labeling your WBS components so you can 
easily see their relationships with each other and their relative positions in 
the overall project WBS:
 
✓ The first digit (1), the Level 1 identifier, indicates the project in which 
the item is located.
 
✓ The second digit (5) indicates the Level 2 component of the project in 
which the item is located.
 
✓ The third digit (7) refers to the Level 3 component under the Level 2 
component 1.5. in which the item is located.

✓ The fourth and last digit (3) is a unique identifier assigned to distinguish 
this item from the other Level 4 components under the Level 3 compo-
nent 1.5.7. If 1.5.7.3. Order Materials isn’t subdivided further, it’s a work 
package.
Displaying your WBS in different formats
You can display your WBS in several different formats. This section looks at 
three of the most common ones.
The organization-chart format
Figure 4-5 shows a WBS in the organization-chart format (also referred to as a 
hierarchy diagram or graphical view). This format effectively portrays an over-
view of your project and the hierarchical relationships of different categories 
at the highest levels. However, because this format generally requires a lot of 
space, it’s less effective for displaying large WBSs.

The indented-outline format
The indented-outline format in Figure 4-6 is another way to display your WBS. 
This format allows you to read and understand a complex WBS with many 
components. However, you can easily get lost in the details of a large project 
with this format and forget how the different pieces all fit together.
 
Both the organization-chart format and the indented-outline format can be 
helpful for displaying the WBS for a small project. For a large project, how-
ever, consider using a combination of the organization-chart and the indented-
outline formats to explain your WBS. You can display the Level 1 and Level 2 
components in the organization-chart format and portray the detailed break-
out for each Level 2 component in the indented-outline format.

The bubble-chart format
The bubble-chart format in Figure 4-7 is particularly effective for supporting 
brainstorming to develop your WBS for both small and large projects. You 
interpret the bubble-chart format as follows:
 
✓ The bubble in the center represents your entire project (in this case, 
Report).
 
✓ Lines from the center bubble lead to Level 2 breakouts (in this case, 
Draft report, Reviews of draft, and Final report).
 
✓ Lines from each Level 2 component lead to Level 3 components related 
to the Level 2 component. (In this case, the Level 2 element Final report 
consists of the two Level 3 elements Handwritten final report and Printed 
final report.)

 Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There
The freeform nature of the bubble-chart format makes it effective for easily 
recording thoughts generated during a brainstorming session. You can also 
easily rearrange components as you proceed with your analysis.
 
The bubble-chart format isn’t effective for displaying your WBS to audiences 
who aren’t familiar with your project. Use this format to develop your WBS 
with your team, but transpose it into an organization-chart or indented-outline 
format when you present it to people outside your team.
Improving the quality of your WBS
You increase the chances for project success when your WBS is accurate and 
complete and when people who will be performing the work understand and 
agree with it. The following guidelines suggest some ways to improve your 
WBS’s accuracy and acceptance:
 
✓ Involve the people who’ll be doing the work. When possible, involve 
them during the initial development of the WBS. If they join the project 
after the initial planning, have them review and critique the WBS before 
they begin work.
 
✓ Review and include information from WBSs from similar projects. 
Review plans and consult people who’ve worked on projects similar to 
yours that were successful. Incorporate your findings into your WBS.
 
✓ Keep your WBS current. When you add, delete, or change WBS ele-
ments during your project, be sure to reflect these changes in your WBS. 
(See “Documenting What You Need to Know about Your Planned Project 
Work” later in this chapter for more about sharing the updated WBS 
with the team.)
 
✓ Make assumptions regarding uncertain activities. If you’re not sure 
whether you’ll do a particular activity, make an assumption and prepare 
your WBS based on that assumption. Be sure to document that assump-
tion. If your assumption proves to be wrong during the project, change 
your plan to reflect the true situation. (See the sections “Making assump-
tions to clarify planned work” and “Representing conditionally repeating 
work” for more about assumptions.)
 
✓ Remember that your WBS identifies only your project’s deliverables; 
it doesn’t depict their chronological order. Nothing is wrong with 
including activities from left to right or top to bottom in the approximate 
order that you’ll perform them. However, in complex projects, you may 
have difficulty showing detailed interrelationships among activities in 
the WBS format. The purpose of the WBS is to ensure that you identify 
all project deliverables. Check out Chapter 5 for more on developing 
your project schedule.

Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
Using templates
 
A WBS template is an existing WBS that contains deliverables typical for a par-
ticular type of project. This template reflects people’s cumulative experience 
from performing many projects of the same type. As people perform more 
projects, they add deliverables to the template that were overlooked and 
remove deliverables that weren’t needed. Using templates can save you time 
and improve your accuracy.
 
Although templates can save time and improve accuracy, don’t inhibit peo-
ple’s active involvement in the development of the WBS by using a template 
that’s too polished. Lack of people’s involvement can lead to missed activities 
and lack of commitment to project success.
This section looks at how you can develop a WBS template and improve its 
accuracy and completeness.
Drawing on previous experience
By drawing on previous experience, you can prepare your WBS in less time 
than it takes to develop a whole new WBS and be more confident that you’ve 
included all essential pieces of work.
 
Suppose you prepare your department’s quarterly budget. After doing a 
number of these budgets, you know most of the work you have to perform. 
Each time you finish another budget, you revise your WBS template to include 
new information you gleaned from the recently completed project.
The next time you start to plan a quarterly budget–preparation project, begin 
with the WBS template you’ve developed from your past projects. Then add 
and subtract elements as appropriate for this particular budget preparation.
Improving your WBS templates
The more accurate and complete your WBS templates are, the more time 
they can save on future projects. This section offers several suggestions for 
continually improving the quality of your WBS templates.
 
When using templates, keep the following in mind:
 
✓ Develop templates for frequently performed tasks as well as for entire 
projects. Templates for the annual organization blood drive or the sub-
mission of a newly developed drug to the Food and Drug Administration 
are valuable. So are templates for individual tasks that are part of these 
projects, such as awarding a competitive contract or having a document 
printed. You can always incorporate templates for individual pieces of 
work into a larger WBS for an entire project.

91
 Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There
 
✓ Develop and modify your WBS template from previous projects that 
worked, not from initial plans that looked good. Often you develop 
a detailed WBS at the start of your project, but you may forget to add 
intermediate or final deliverables that you overlooked in your initial 
planning. If you update your template from a WBS that you prepared at 
the start of your project, it won’t reflect what you discovered during the 
actual performance of the project.
 
✓ Use templates as starting points, not ending points. Make it clear to 
your team members and others involved in the project that the template 
is only the start for your WBS, not the final version. Every project dif-
fers in some ways from similar ones performed in the past. If you don’t 
critically examine the template, you may miss work that wasn’t done in 
previous projects but that needs to be done in this one.
 
✓ Continually update your templates to reflect your experiences from 
different projects. The post-project evaluation is a great opportunity to 
review and critique your original WBS. (See Chapter 15 for information 
on how to plan and conduct this evaluation.) At the end of your project, 
take a moment to revise your WBS template to reflect what you found.
Identifying Risks While 
Detailing Your Work
In addition to helping you identify work you need to complete, a WBS helps 
you identify unknowns that may cause problems when you attempt to per-
form that work. As you think through the work you have to do to complete 
your project, you often identify considerations that may affect how or 
whether you can perform particular project activities. Sometimes you have 
the information you need to assess and address a consideration and some-
times you don’t. Identifying and dealing effectively with information you need 
but don’t have can dramatically increase your chances for project success.
Unknown information falls into one of two categories:
 
✓ A known unknown: Information you know you need that someone else 
has but you don’t.
 
✓ An unknown unknown: Information you know you need that neither 
you nor anyone else has because it doesn’t yet exist.
 
You deal with known unknowns by finding out who has the information you 
need and then getting it. You deal with unknown unknowns by using one or 
more of the following strategies:

92
Part I: Understanding Expectations (The Who, What, and Why of Your Project)
 
✓ Buying insurance to minimize damage that occurs if something doesn’t 
turn out the way you expected
 
✓ Developing contingency plans to follow if something doesn’t turn out the 
way you expected
 
✓ Trying to influence what the information eventually turns out to be
 
In the project Conducting a survey discussed in the “Conducting a survey: 
Using the Work Breakdown Structure” sidebar earlier in this chapter, you 
figure you’ll need a week to select a sample of clients to survey if the sales 
department has a current data tape listing all the company’s clients. At this 
point, whether the data tape exists is a known unknown — it’s unknown to 
you, but, if it exists, someone else knows about it. You deal with this unknown 
by calling people to find someone who knows whether such a data tape does 
or does not exist.
You experience a different situation when you become aware that twice in 
the past month computer operators at your company accidentally destroyed 
a data tape when they spilled coffee on it as they were preparing to mount 
it on a tape drive. As part of your current project (Conducting a survey), you 
need to have a computer operator mount a tape on a tape drive. Not surpris-
ingly, you’re now concerned that the operator may spill coffee on your tape 
and destroy it, too.
Whether or not the operator will spill coffee on your tape is an unknown 
unknown when you prepare the WBS for your project plan. You can’t deter-
mine beforehand whether the operator will spill coffee on your tape because 
it’s an unintended, unplanned act (at least you hope so!).
Because you can’t find out for certain whether or not this occurrence will 
happen, you can consider taking one or more of the following approaches to 
address this risk:
 
✓ Develop a contingency plan. For example, in addition to developing 
a scheme for the computerized selection of names directly from the 
data tape, have the statistician who guides the selection of the sample 
develop a scheme for selecting names randomly by hand from the hard 
copy of the data tape.
 
✓ Take steps to reduce the likelihood that coffee is spilled on your data 
tape. For example, on the morning that your data tape is to be run, 
check beforehand for open cups of coffee in the computer room.
Of course, if you feel the chances the operator will spill coffee on your data 
tape are sufficiently small, you can always choose to do nothing beforehand 
and just deal with the situation if and when it actually occurs.

93
 Chapter 4: Developing Your Game Plan: Getting from Here to There
Developing the WBS helps you identify a situation that may compromise your 
project’s success. You then must decide how to deal with that situation. See 
Chapter 8 for more detailed information on how to identify and manage proj-
ect risks and uncertainties.
Documenting What You Need to Know 
about Your Planned Project Work
 
After preparing your project WBS, take some time to gather essential informa-
tion about all work packages (lowest-level WBS components), and keep it in 
a WBS dictionary that’s available to all project team members. You and your 
team will use this information to develop the remaining parts of your plan, 
as well as to support the tracking, controlling, and replanning of activities 
during the project. The project manager (or her designee) should approve all 
changes to information in this dictionary.
At a minimum, the WBS dictionary contains but isn’t limited to the following 
information for all WBS components:
 
✓ WBS component title and WBS identification code: Descriptors that 
uniquely identify the WBS component
 
✓ Activities included: List of all the activities that must be performed to 
create the deliverable identified in the work package
 
✓ Work detail: Narrative description of work processes and procedures
 
✓ Schedule milestones: Significant events in the component’s schedule
 
✓ Quality requirements: Desired characteristics of the deliverables pro-
duced in the WBS component
 
✓ Acceptance criteria: Criteria that must be met before project deliver-
ables are accepted
 
✓ Required resources: People, funds, equipment, facilities, raw materials, 
information, and so on that these activities need
 
For larger projects, you maintain the WBS — including all its components from 
Level 1 down to and including the work packages — together in the same hier-
archical representation, and you keep all the activities that comprise the work 
packages in an activity list and/or the WBS dictionary. Separating the WBS 
components in this way helps you more easily see and understand the impor-
tant interrelationships and aspects of the project deliverables and work.
On smaller projects, however, you may combine the deliverable-oriented 
WBS components and the activities that comprise each work package in the 
same hierarchical display.

ou have the greatest chance of achieving project suc-
cess when you have a plan that meets your client’s 
needs and that you believe is possible to accomplish.
In this part, I show you how to develop a feasible and

when you need to complete your project earlier than 
planned. I discuss how to estimate the people, funds, and 
other resources you need to perform the project work. 
And last, but definitely not least, I discuss how you can

You Want This Project

In This Chapter
▶ Creating a network diagram for your project
▶ Using your network diagram to determine schedule possibilities
▶ Forming your project’s initial schedule
▶ Estimating activity durations and presenting your project’s schedule
P
roject assignments always have deadlines. So even though you’re not 
sure what your new project is supposed to accomplish, you want to 
know when it has to be finished. Unfortunately, when you find out the desired 
end date, your immediate reaction is often one of panic: “But I don’t have 
enough time!”
The truth is, when you first receive your project assignment, you usually 
have no idea how long it’ll take to complete. Initial reactions tend to be based 
more on fear and anxiety than on facts, especially when you’re trying to 
juggle multiple responsibilities and the project sounds complex.
To help you develop a more realistic estimate of how long your project will 
take, you need an organized approach that clarifies how you plan to perform 
your project’s activities, what schedules are possible, and how you’ll meet 
deadlines that initially appear unrealistic. This chapter describes a technique 
that helps you proactively develop an achievable schedule (while keeping 
your anxiety in check).
 
The discussion in this chapter on using network diagrams to develop project 
schedules is the most technically detailed presentation in this book. Even 
though the technique takes about ten minutes to master, the explanations and 
illustrations can appear overwhelming at first glance. If this is your first contact 
with flowcharts, I suggest you initially scan this chapter for the main points and 
then read the different sections several times. The more you read the text, the 
more logical the explanations become. However, if you get frustrated with the 
technical details, put the book away and come back to it later. You’ll be sur-
prised how much clearer the details are the second or third time around!

98
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
Picture This: Illustrating a Work 
Plan with a Network Diagram
To determine the amount of time you need for any project, you have to 
determine the following two pieces of information:
 
✓ Sequence: The order in which you perform the activities
 
✓ Duration: How long each individual activity takes
For example, suppose you have a project consisting of ten activities, each of 
which takes one week to complete. How long will it take you to complete your 
project? The truth is, you can’t tell. You may finish the project in one week if 
you can perform all ten activities at the same time and have the resources to 
do so. You may take ten weeks if you have to do the activities one at a time in 
sequential order. Or you may take between one and ten weeks if you have to 
do some, but not all, activities in sequence.
To develop a schedule for a small project, you can probably consider the 
durations and sequential interdependencies in your head. But projects with 
15 to 20 activities or more — many of which you can perform at the same 
time — require an organized method to guide your analysis.
This section helps you develop feasible schedules by showing you how to 
draw network diagrams and then how to choose the best one for your project.
Defining a network diagram’s elements
A network diagram is a flowchart that illustrates the order in which you per-
form project activities. It’s your project’s test laboratory — it gives you a 
chance to try out different strategies before performing the work.
No matter how complex your project is, its network diagram has the follow-
ing three elements: milestones, activities, and durations.
Milestone
A milestone, sometimes called an event, is a significant occurrence in the life 
of a project. Milestones take no time and consume no resources; they occur 
instantaneously. Think of them as signposts that signify a point in your trip 
to project completion. Milestones mark the start or end of one or more activi-
ties. Examples of milestones are draft report approved and design begun.

99
 Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?
Activity
An activity is a component of work performed during the course of a project. 
Activities take time and consume resources; you describe them using action 
verbs. Examples of activities are design report and conduct survey.
 
Make sure you define activities and milestones clearly. The more clearly you 
define them, the more accurately you can estimate the time and resources 
needed to perform them, the more easily you can assign them to someone 
else, and the more meaningful your reporting of schedule progress becomes.
Duration
Duration is the total number of work periods it takes to complete an activity. 
The amount of work effort required to complete the activity, people’s availabil-
ity, and whether people can work on the activity at the same time all affect the 
activity’s duration. Capacity of nonpersonnel resources (for example, a com-
puter’s processing speed and the pages per minute that a copier can print) and 
availability of those resources also affect duration. In addition, delay can add 
to an activity’s duration. For example, if your boss spends one hour reading 
your memo after it sat in her inbox for four days and seven hours, the activity’s 
duration is five days, even though your boss spends only one hour reading it.
Understanding the basis of a duration estimate helps you figure out ways to 
reduce it. For example, suppose you estimate that testing a software package 
requires that it run for 24 hours on a computer. If you can use the computer 
only 6 hours in any one day, the duration for your software test is four days. 
Doubling the number of people working on the test won’t reduce the duration 
to two days, but getting approval to use the computer for 12 hours a day will.
 
The units of time describe two related, but different, activity characteristics. 
Duration is the number of work periods required to perform an activity; work 
effort is the amount of time a person needs to work full time on the activity 
to complete it. (See Chapter 6 for more details on work effort.) For example, 
suppose 4 people had to work together full time for 5 days to complete an 
activity. The activity’s duration is 5 days. The work effort is 20 person-days (4 
people multiplied by 5 days).
Drawing a network diagram
Determining your project’s end date requires you to choose the dates that 
each project activity starts and ends and the dates that each milestone is 
reached. You can determine these dates with the help of a network diagram.
 
The activity-on-node technique (also called activity-in-box or precedence dia-
gramming method) for drawing a network diagram uses the following three 
symbols to describe the diagram’s three elements:

100
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
 
✓ Boxes: Boxes represent activities and milestones. If the duration is 0, 
it’s a milestone; if it’s greater than 0, it’s an activity. Note that milestone 
boxes are sometimes highlighted with lines that are bold, double, or oth-
erwise more noticeable.
 
✓ Letter t: The letter t represents duration.
 
✓ Arrows: Arrows represent the direction work flows from one activity or 
milestone to the next. Upon completion of an activity or reaching of a 
milestone, you can proceed either to a milestone or directly to another 
activity as indicated by the arrow(s) leaving that activity or milestone.
Figure 5-1 presents a simple example of an activity-on-node network diagram. 
When you reach Milestone A (the box on the left), you can perform Activity 1 
(the box in the middle), which you estimated will take two weeks to com-
plete. Upon completing Activity 1, you reach Milestone B (the box on the 
right). The arrows indicate the direction of workflow.

resenting

Those of you who have worked with network diagrams in the past may 
have seen them drawn in another format called activity-on-arrow, also called 
the classical approach, an arrow diagram, or a PERT chart (see the section 
“Improving activity duration estimates” later in this chapter for an explanation 
of PERT analysis). This format represents milestones with circles and activi-
ties with arrows. However, because the activity-on-node technique is the one 
most used today, I draw all network diagrams in this book in this format.
Analyzing a Network Diagram
Think of your project as a trip you and several friends are planning to take. 
Each of you has a car and will travel a different route to the final destination. 
During the trip, two or more of your routes will cross at certain places. You 
agree that all people who pass through a common point must arrive at that 

101
 Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?
point before anyone can proceed on the next leg of the journey. The trip is 
over when all of you reach the final destination.
You certainly don’t want to undertake a trip this complex without planning it 
out on a road map. After all, planning your trip allows you to
 
✓ Determine how long the entire trip will take.
 
✓ Identify potential difficulties along the way.
 
✓ Consider alternate routes to get to your final destination more quickly.
This section helps you plan your project schedule by telling you how to read 
and interpret a road map (your network diagram) so you can determine the 
likely consequences of your possible approaches.
Reading a network diagram
 
Use the following two rules as you draw and interpret your network diagram. 
After you understand these rules, analyzing the diagram is a snap:
 
✓ Rule 1: After you finish an activity or reach a milestone, you can pro-
ceed to the next activity or milestone, as indicated by the arrow(s).
 
✓ Rule 2: Before you can start an activity or reach a milestone, you must 
first complete all activities and reach all milestones with arrows pointing 
to the activity you want to start or milestone you want to reach.
 
Figure 5-2 illustrates a network diagram. According to Rule 1, from Start, you 
can proceed to work on either Activity 1 or 3, which means you can do either 
Activity 1 or Activity 3 by itself or both Activities 1 and 3 at the same time. In 
other words, these two activities are independent of each other.
You may also choose to do neither of the activities. Rule 1 is an allowing rela-
tionship, not a forcing relationship. In other words, you can work on any of 
the activities that the arrows from Start lead to, but you don’t have to work 
on any of them. For example, suppose a part of your plan includes two activi-
ties to build a device: receive parts and assemble parts. As soon as you receive 
the parts, you can start to assemble them; in fact, you can’t start to assemble 
them until you receive them. But after you receive all the parts you ordered, 
neither rule says you must start to assemble them immediately; you can 
assemble them if you want to, or you can wait.
Of course, if you wait, the completion of the assembly will be delayed. But 
that’s your choice.
According to Rule 2, you can start working on Activity 2 in Figure 5-2 as soon 
as you complete Activity 1 because the arrow from Activity 1 is the only one 
leading to Activity 2. Rule 2, therefore, is a forcing (or requiring) relationship. If 

102
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
arrows from three activities led to Activity 2, you’d have to complete all three 
activities before starting Activity 2. (The diagram doesn’t indicate that you 
can start working on Activity 2 by completing only one or two of the three 
activities that lead to it.)

Interpreting a network diagram
You can use your network diagram to figure out when to start and end activi-
ties and when you’ll finish the entire project if you perform the activities in 
this way. To find out the schedule that your approach will allow, you need 
the following information:
 
✓ Critical path: A sequence of activities that takes the longest time to 
complete
 
✓ Noncritical path: A sequence of activities in which you can delay activi-
ties and still finish your project in the shortest possible time
 
✓ Slack time (also called float): The maximum amount of time you can 
delay an activity and still finish your project in the shortest possible time
 
✓ Earliest start date: The earliest date you can start an activity
 
✓ Earliest finish date: The earliest date you can finish an activity
 
✓ Latest start date: The latest date you can start an activity and still finish 
your project in the shortest possible time
 
✓ Latest finish date: The latest date you can finish an activity and still 
finish your project in the shortest possible time
You can use the Critical Path Method (CPM) to determine this information and 
to build your project’s overall schedule. The following sections illustrate how 
this method works.

103
 Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?
The importance of the critical path
The length of your project’s critical path(s) in your network diagram defines 
your project’s length (hence, the Critical Path Method for determining your 
project’s schedule). If you want to finish your project in less time, consider 
ways to shorten its critical path.
 
Monitor critical-path activities closely during performance because any delay 
in critical-path activities will delay your project’s completion. Also closely 
monitor any activities on paths that are close to being critical because any 
minor delay on those paths can also delay your project’s completion.
 
Your project can have two or more critical paths at the same time. In fact, every 
path in your project can be critical if every one of them takes the same amount 
of time. However, when every path is critical, you have a high-risk situation; a 
delay in any activity immediately causes a delay in the completion of the project.
Critical paths can change as your project unfolds. Sometimes activities on a 
critical path finish so early that the path becomes shorter than one or more 
other paths that were initially considered noncritical. Other times, activities 
on an initially noncritical path are delayed to the point where the sum of 
their completion times becomes greater than the length of the current criti-
cal path (which turns the initially noncritical path into a critical one).
The forward pass — determining critical paths, noncritical 
paths, and earliest start and finish dates
Your first step in analyzing your project’s network diagram is to start at the 
beginning and see how quickly you can complete the activities along each 
path. This start-to-finish analysis is called the forward pass.
 
To help you understand what a forward pass is, you can perform one through 
the diagram in Figure 5-2. According to Rule 1, you can consider working on 
either Activity 1 or Activity 3 (or both together) as soon as the project starts 
(check out the section “Reading a network diagram” earlier in this chapter 
for more info on the two rules of network diagram analysis). First, consider 
Activities 1 and 2 on the upper path:
 
✓ The earliest you can start Activity 1 is the moment the project starts 
(the beginning of week 1).
 
✓ The earliest you can finish Activity 1 is the end of week 5 (add Activity 1’s 
estimated duration of five weeks to its earliest start time, which is the 
start of the project).
 
✓ According to Rule 2, the earliest you can start Activity 2 is the beginning of 
week 6 because the arrow from Activity 1 is the only one leading to Activity 2.
 
✓ The earliest you can finish Activity 2 is the end of week 6 (add Activity 2’s 
estimated duration of one week to its earliest start time at the beginning 
of week 6).

104
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
So far, so good. Now consider Activities 3, 4, and 5 on the lower path of the 
diagram:
 
✓ The earliest you can start Activity 3 is the moment the project starts 
(the beginning of week 1).
 
✓ The earliest you can finish Activity 3 is the end of week 1.
 
✓ The earliest you can start Activity 4 is the beginning of week 2.
 
✓ The earliest you can finish Activity 4 is the end of week 4.
You have to be careful when you try to determine the earliest you can start 
Activity 5. According to Rule 2, the two arrows entering Activity 5 indicate 
you must finish both Activity 1 and Activity 4 before you begin Activity 5. 
Even though you can finish Activity 4 by the end of week 4, you can’t finish 
Activity 1 until the end of week 5. Therefore, the earliest you can start 
Activity 5 is the beginning of week 6.
 
If two or more activities or milestones lead to the same activity, the earliest 
you can start that activity is the latest of the earliest finish dates for those pre-
ceding activities or milestones.
Is your head spinning, yet? Take heart; the end’s in sight:
 
✓ The earliest you can start Activity 5 is the beginning of week 6.
 
✓ The earliest you can finish Activity 5 is the end of week 7.
 
✓ The earliest you can finish Activity 2 is the end of week 6. Therefore, the 
earliest you can finish the entire project (and reach the milestone called 
End) is the end of week 7.
So far, you have the following information about your project:
 
✓ The length of the critical path (the shortest time in which you can complete 
the project) is seven weeks. Only one critical path takes seven weeks; it 
includes the milestone Start, Activity 1, Activity 5, and the milestone End.
 
✓ Activity 2, Activity 3, and Activity 4 aren’t on critical paths.
The backward pass — determining latest 
start and finish dates and slack times
You’re halfway home. In case resource conflicts or unexpected delays pre-
vent you from beginning all the project activities at their earliest possible 
start times, you want to know how much you can delay the activities along 
each path and still finish the project at the earliest possible date. This finish-
to-start analysis is called the backward pass.

105
 Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?
 
To return to the example started in the preceding section: You found out from 
the forward pass that the earliest date you can reach the milestone End is the 
end of week 7. However, Rule 2 in the earlier section “Reading a network dia-
gram” says you can’t reach the milestone End until you’ve completed 
Activities 2 and 5. Therefore, to finish your project by the end of week 7, the 
latest you can finish Activities 2 and 5 is the end of week 7. Again, consider the 
lower path on the diagram in Figure 5-2 with Activities 3, 4, and 5:
 
✓ You must start Activity 5 by the beginning of week 6 to finish it by the 
end of week 7 (because Activity 5’s estimated duration is two weeks).
 
✓ According to Rule 2, you can’t start Activity 5 until you finish Activities 1 
and 4. So, you must finish Activities 1 and 4 by the end of week 5.
 
✓ You must start Activity 4 by the beginning of week 3.
 
✓ You must finish Activity 3 before you can work on Activity 4. Therefore, 
you must finish Activity 3 by the end of week 2.
 
✓ You must start Activity 3 by the beginning of week 2.
Finally, consider the upper path on the network diagram in Figure 5-2:
 
✓ You must start Activity 2 by the beginning of week 7.
 
✓ You can’t work on Activity 2 until you finish Activity 1. Therefore, you 
must finish Activity 1 by the end of week 6.
Here again, you must be careful in your calculations. You must finish Activity 1 
by the end of week 5 to start Activity 5 at the beginning of week 6. But, to 
start work on Activity 2 at the beginning of week 7, you must finish Activity 1 
by the end of week 6. So, finishing Activity 1 by the end of week 5 satisfies 
both requirements.
 
If two or more arrows leave the same activity or milestone, the latest date you 
can finish the activity or reach the milestone is the earliest of the latest dates 
that you must start the next activities or reach the next milestones.
In Figure 5-2, the latest start dates for Activities 2 and 5 are the beginnings of 
week 7 and week 6, respectively. Therefore, the latest date to finish Activity 1 
is the end of week 5. The rest is straightforward: You must start Activity 1 by 
the beginning of week 1 at the latest.
 
To organize the dates you calculate in the forward and backward passes, con-
sider writing the earliest and latest start dates and the earliest and latest finish 
dates at the top of each milestone or activity box in the project’s network dia-
gram. Figure 5-3 illustrates how this looks for the example in Figure 5-2.

Now that you have all the earliest and latest start and finish dates for your 
milestones and activities, you need to determine the slack time for each 
activity or milestone. (An activity’s slack time is the amount of time it can be 
delayed without causing a delay in your overall project completion time.) 
You can determine slack time in one of two ways:
 
✓ Subtract the earliest possible start date from the latest allowable start 
date.
 
✓ Subtract the earliest possible finish date from the latest allowable finish 
date.
Thus, you can determine that Activities 2, 3, and 4 have slack times of one 
week, while Activities 1 and 5 have no slack time. Figure 5-3 displays this 
information.
Note: If an activity’s slack time is zero, the activity is on a critical path.
 
Although slack time is defined as the amount of time an activity or milestone 
can be delayed without delaying your project’s completion time, slack time 
is actually associated with a sequence of activities rather than with an indi-
vidual activity. The information in Figure 5-3 indicates that both Activity 3 
and Activity 4 (which are on the same path) have slack times of one week. 
However, if Activity 2 is delayed by a week, Activity 3 will have zero slack time.
 
A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, 4th Edition (PMBOK 4) 
identifies the following two types of slack:

107
 Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?
 
✓ Total slack: The total amount of time a schedule activity may be delayed 
without delaying the project end date or a schedule constraint. This is 
the same as what I refer to as slack.
 
✓ Free slack: The amount of time a schedule activity may be delayed without 
delaying the early start of any immediately following schedule activities.
As an example of these terms, look at the network diagram in Figure 5-3. 
Consider that Activity 3 is scheduled to start at the beginning of week 1 and 
Activity 4 is scheduled to start at the beginning of week 3. You can delay 
the start of Activity 3 by up to one week and Activity 4 will still be able to 
start at the beginning of week 3. So, Activity 3 has a free slack of one week. 
Coincidently, Activity 3 also has a total slack of one week because if you delay 
its start by more than one week, the completion of the project would be 
delayed beyond the current scheduled completion date of the end of week 7.
Note: The concept of total slack is more often used in schedule analyses, and 
that’s the concept I use in this book. For simplicity, I refer to this information 
item simply as slack rather than total slack.
Working with Your Project’s 
Network Diagram
The preceding sections explain the general rules and procedures for drawing 
and analyzing any network diagram. This section tells you how to create and 
analyze the network diagram for your own project.
Determining precedence
To draw your project’s network diagram, you first have to decide the order of 
your project’s activities. This section tells you different reasons why you may 
need to perform activities in a particular order.
Looking at factors that affect predecessors
 
A predecessor to an activity (Activity A, for example) is an activity or milestone 
that determines when work on Activity A can begin. PMBOK 4 identifies the 
following four relationships that can exist between a predecessor and the 
activity or milestone coming immediately after it (termed its successor):
 
✓ Finish-to-start: The predecessor must finish before the successor can 
start.
 
✓ Finish-to-finish: The predecessor must finish before the successor can 
finish.

108
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
 
✓ Start-to-start: The predecessor must start before the successor can start.
 
✓ Start-to-finish: The predecessor must start before the successor can 
finish.
The finish-to-start precedence relationship is the one most commonly used, 
so it’s the one I address in this book. In other words, in this book, a predeces-
sor is an activity that must be completed before its successor activity can 
start or its successor milestone can be reached.
 
Sometimes an activity can’t start precisely when its predecessor is finished. A 
lag is the amount of time after its predecessor is completed that you must wait 
before an activity can start. A lead is the amount of time before its predeces-
sor is finished that an activity can begin. In this book, I only consider situa-
tions where lead and lag times are zero.
An activity is an immediate predecessor to Activity A if you don’t have any 
other activities between it and Activity A. When you determine the immedi-
ate predecessors for every activity, you have all the information you need to 
draw your project’s network diagram. The following considerations affect the 
order in which you must perform your project’s activities:
 
✓ Mandatory dependencies: These relationships must be observed if proj-
ect work is to be a success. They include
 
• Legal requirements: Federal, state, and local laws or regulations 
require that certain activities be done before others. As an exam-
ple, consider a pharmaceutical company that has developed a new 
drug in the laboratory and demonstrated its safety and effective-
ness in clinical trials. The manufacturer wants to start producing 
and selling the drug immediately but can’t. Federal law requires 
that the company obtain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approval of the drug before selling it.
 
• Procedural requirements: Company policies and procedures 
require that certain activities be done before others. Suppose 
you’re developing a new piece of software for your organization. 
You’ve finished your design and want to start programming the 
software. However, your organization follows a systems develop-
ment methodology that requires the management-oversight com-
mittee to formally approve your design before you can develop it.
 
• Hard logic: Certain processes must logically occur before others. 
For example, when building a house, you must pour the concrete 
for the foundation before you erect the frame.
 
✓ Discretionary dependencies: You may choose to establish these rela-
tionships between activities; they aren’t required. They include

109
 Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?
 
• Logical dependencies: Performing certain activities before others 
sometimes seems to make the most sense. Suppose you’re writing 
a report. Because much of Chapter 3 depends on what you write 
in Chapter 2, you decide to write Chapter 2 first. You could write 
Chapter 3 first or work on both at the same time, but that plan 
increases the chance that you’ll have to rewrite some of Chapter 3 
after you finish Chapter 2.
 
• Managerial choices: Sometimes you make arbitrary decisions to 
work on certain activities before others. Consider that you have to 
perform both Activity C and Activity D. You can’t work on them at 
the same time, and there’s no legal or logical reason why you should 
work on one or the other first. You decide to work on Activity C first.
 
✓ External dependencies: Starting a project activity may require that an 
activity outside the project be completed. For example, imagine that 
your project includes an activity to test a device you’re developing. You 
want to start testing right away, but you can’t start this activity until 
your organization’s test laboratory receives and installs a new piece of 
test equipment they plan to order.
Choosing immediate predecessors
You can decide on the immediate predecessors for your project’s activities in 
one of two ways:
 
✓ Front-to-back: Start with the activities you can perform as soon as 
your project begins and work your way through to the end. To use this 
method, follow these steps:
 
1. Select the first activity or activities to perform as soon as your 
project starts.
 
2. Decide which activity or activities you can perform when you 
finish the first ones (from Step 1).
 
3. Continue in this way until you’ve considered all activities in the 
project.
 
✓ Back-to-front: Choose the activity or activities that will be done last on 
the project and continue backward toward the beginning. To use this 
method, follow these steps:
 
1. Identify the last project activity or activities you will conduct.
 
2. Decide which activity or activities you must complete right 
before you can start to work on the last activities (from Step 1).
 
3. Continue in this manner until you’ve considered all activities in 
your project.
Regardless of which method you use to find your project’s immediate predeces-
sors, record the immediate predecessors in a simple table like Table 5-1. (This 
table lists the immediate predecessors in the example shown in Figure 5-2.)

Determine precedence based on the nature and requirements of the activi-
ties, not on the resources you think will be available. Suppose Activities A and 
B of your project can be performed at the same time but you plan to assign 
them to the same person. In this case, don’t make Activity A the immediate 
predecessor for B, thinking that the person can work on only one activity at 
a time. Instead, let your diagram show that A and B can be done at the same 
time. Later, if you find out you have another person who can help out with 
this work, you can evaluate the impact of performing Activities A and B at the 
same time. (See Chapter 6 for a discussion on how to determine when people 
are overcommitted and how to resolve these situations.)
 
When you create your network diagram for simple projects, consider writing 
the names of your activities and milestones on sticky-back notes and attach-
ing them to chart paper or a wall. For more complex projects, consider using 
an integrated project-management software package. (See Chapter 16 for a 
discussion of how to use software to support your project planning, and check 
out Microsoft Office Project 2007 For Dummies by Nancy Muir [Wiley] for the 
lowdown on the most popular project-management software package.)
Using a network diagram to 
analyze a simple example
Consider the following example of preparing for a picnic to illustrate how to 
use a network diagram to determine possible schedules while meeting proj-
ect expectations and satisfying project constraints. (I’m not suggesting that 
you plan all your picnics this way, but the situation does illustrate the tech-
nique rather nicely!)
Deciding on the activities
It’s Friday evening, and you and your friend are considering what to do 
during the weekend to unwind and relax. The forecast for Saturday is for 
sunny and mild weather, so you decide to go on a picnic at a local lake. 

111
 Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?
Because you want to get the most enjoyment possible from your picnic, you 
decide to plan the outing carefully by drawing and analyzing a network dia-
gram. Table 5-2 illustrates the seven activities you decide you must perform 
to prepare for your picnic and get to the lake.

In addition, you agree to observe the following constraints:
 
✓ You and your friend will start all activities at your house at 8 a.m. 
Saturday — you can’t do anything before that time.
 
✓ You must perform all seven activities to complete your project.
 
✓ You can’t change who must be present during each activity.
 
✓ The two lakes you’re considering are in opposite directions from your 
house, so you must decide where you’re going to have your picnic 
before you begin your drive.
Setting the order of the activities
Now that you have all your activities listed, you need to decide the order in 
which you will do them. In other words, you need to determine the immedi-
ate predecessors for each activity. The following dependencies are required: 
Your friend must boil the eggs before he can make the egg sandwiches (duh!), 
and both of you must load the car and decide which lake to visit before you 
start your drive.
The order of the rest of the activities is up to you. You may consider the fol-
lowing approach:

112
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
 
✓ Decide which lake before you do anything else.
 
✓ After you both agree on the lake, you drive to the bank to get money.
 
✓ After you get money from the bank, you get gasoline.
 
✓ At the same time, after you agree on the lake, your friend starts to boil 
the eggs.
 
✓ After the eggs are boiled, your friend makes the egg sandwiches.
 
✓ After you get back with the gas and your friend finishes the egg sand-
wiches, you both load the car.
 
✓ After you both load the car, you drive to the lake.

Creating the network diagram
Now that you have your immediate predecessors in mind, you can draw the 
network diagram for your project from the information in Table 5-5. To do so, 
follow these steps:
 
1. Begin your project with a single milestone and label it Start.
 
2. Find all activities in the table that have no immediate predecessors — 
they can all start as soon as you begin your project.
 
 In this case, only Activity 5 has no immediate predecessors.
 
3. Begin your diagram by drawing the relationship between the Start of 
your project and the beginning of Activity 5 (see Figure 5-4).
 
 Depict Activity 5 with a box and draw an arrow to it from the Start box.

4. Find all activities that have your first activity as an immediate 
predecessor.
 
 In this case, Table 5-3 shows that Activities 2 and 7 have Activity 5 as an 
immediate predecessor. Draw boxes to represent these two activities, 
and draw arrows from Activity 5 to Activities 2 and 7 (see Figure 5-5).
 
5. Continue in the same way with the remaining activities.
 
 Recognize from Table 5-5 that only Activity 6 has Activity 2 as an imme-
diate predecessor. Therefore, draw a box to represent Activity 6 and 
draw an arrow from Activity 2 to that box.
 
 Table 5-3 also shows that only Activity 3 has Activity 7 as an immediate 
predecessor. So draw a box to represent Activity 3, and draw an arrow 
from Activity 7 to Activity 3. Figure 5-5 depicts your diagram in progress.
 
 Now realize that Activity 1 has both Activities 3 and 6 as immediate 
predecessors. Therefore, draw a box representing Activity 1 and draw 
arrows from Activities 3 and 6 to this box.

 The rest is pretty straightforward. Because only Activity 4 has Activity 1 
as its immediate predecessor, draw a box representing Activity 4 and 
draw an arrow from Activity 1 to Activity 4.
 
6. After adding all the activities to the diagram, draw a box to represent 
End, and draw an arrow from Activity 4 (the last activity you have to 
complete) to that box (see Figure 5-6 for the complete network diagram).

Now for the important timing-related questions. First, how long will you and 
your friend take to get to the lake for your picnic? The upper path (Start, 
Activities 5, 2, 6, 1, 4, and End) takes 52 minutes to complete, and the lower 
path (Start, Activities 5, 7, 3, 1, 4, and End) takes 57 minutes to complete. 
Thus, it will take 57 minutes from the time you start until you arrive at the 
lake for your picnic, and the lower path is the critical path.
The second timing-related question you have to answer is: Can you delay 
any activities and still get to the lake in 57 minutes? If so, which ones can you 
delay and by how much? To answer these questions, consider the following:
 
✓ The network diagram reveals that Activities 5, 7, 3, 1, and 4 are all on the 
critical path. Therefore, you can’t delay any of them if you want to get to 
the lake in 57 minutes.
 
✓ Activities 2 and 6 aren’t on the critical path, and they can be performed 
at the same time as Activities 7 and 3. Activities 7 and 3 take 20 minutes 
to perform, while Activities 2 and 6 take 15 minutes. Therefore, Activities 2 
and 6 have a total slack time of 5 minutes.
Developing Your Project’s Schedule
Developing your project’s schedule requires the combination of activities, 
resources, and activity-performance sequences that gives you the greatest 

115
 Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?
chance of meeting your client’s expectations with the least amount of risk. 
This section helps you start making a project schedule. It also focuses on 
some potential pitfalls and solutions for meeting time crunches.
Taking the first steps
After you specify your project’s activities (see the discussion on creat-
ing Work Breakdown Structures in Chapter 4), take the following steps to 
develop an initial project schedule:
 
1. Identify immediate predecessors for all activities.
 
 Immediate predecessors define the structure of your network diagram.
 
2. Determine the personnel and nonpersonnel resources required for all 
activities.
 
 The type, amount, and availability of resources affect how long you need 
to perform each activity.
 
3. Estimate durations for all activities.
 
 See the section “Estimating Activity Duration” for details on how to 
do so.
 
4. Identify all intermediate and final dates that must be met.
 
 These dates define the criteria that your schedule must meet.
 
5. Identify all activities or milestones outside your project that affect 
your project’s activities.
 
 After you identify these external activities and milestones, you can set 
up the appropriate dependencies between them and your project’s 
activities and milestones.
 
6. Draw your network diagram.
 
 Use the network diagram to determine what schedules your project can 
achieve.
 
7. Analyze your project’s network diagram to identity all critical paths 
and their lengths and to identify the slack times of noncritical paths.
 
 This information helps you choose which project activities to monitor 
and how often to monitor them. It also suggests strategies for getting 
back on track if you encounter unexpected schedule delays. (See the 
section “Interpreting a network diagram” earlier in this chapter for addi-
tional information on critical and noncritical paths.)
If the completion date is acceptable to your client, you’re done with your 
scheduling. However, if your client wants you to finish faster than your initial 
schedule allows, your analyses are just beginning.

116
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
Avoiding the pitfall of backing 
in to your schedule
 
Beware of developing a schedule by backing in, that is, starting at the end of a 
project and working your way back toward the beginning to identify activities 
and estimate durations that allow you to meet your client’s desired end date. 
Using this approach substantially decreases the chances that you’ll meet the 
schedule for the following reasons:
 
✓ You may miss activities because your focus is on meeting a time con-
straint, not ensuring that you’ve identified all required work.
 
✓ You base your duration estimates on what you can allow activities to 
take rather than what they’ll require.
 
✓ The order for your proposed activities may not be the most effective one.
 
I was reviewing a colleague’s project plan a while back and noticed that she 
had allowed one week for her final report’s review and approval. When I asked 
her whether she thought this estimate was realistic, she replied that it cer-
tainly wasn’t realistic but that she had to use that estimate for the project plan 
to work out. In other words, she was using time estimates that totaled to the 
number she wanted to reach rather than ones she thought she could meet.
Meeting an established time constraint
Suppose your initial schedule has you finishing your project in three months, 
but your client wants the results in two months. Consider the following 
options for reducing the length of your critical paths:
 
✓ Recheck the original duration estimates.
 
• Be sure you have clearly described the activity’s work.
 
• If you used past performance as a guide for developing the dura-
tions, recheck to be sure all characteristics of your current situa-
tion are the same as those of the past performance.
 
• Ask other experts to review and validate your estimates.
 
• Ask the people who’ll actually be doing the work on these activi-
ties to review and validate your estimates.
 
✓ Consider using more-experienced personnel. Sometimes more-
experienced personnel can get work done in less time. Of course, using 
more-experienced people may cost you more money. Further, you’re not 
the only one in your organization who needs those more-experienced 
personnel; they may not always be available to help with your project!

117
 Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?
 
✓ Consider different strategies for performing the activities. As an example, 
if you estimate a task you’re planning to do internally to take three weeks, 
see if you can find an external contractor who can perform it in two weeks.
 
✓ Consider fast tracking — performing tasks that are normally done 
sequentially at the same time. While fast tracking can shorten the over-
all time to perform the tasks, it also increases the risk of having to redo 
portions of your work, so be ready to do so.
 
As you reduce the lengths of critical paths, monitor paths that aren’t initially 
critical to ensure that they haven’t become critical. If one or more paths have 
become critical, use these same approaches to reduce their lengths.
Applying different strategies to arrive 
at your picnic in less time
Consider the example of preparing for a picnic (which I introduce in the “Using 
a network diagram to analyze a simple example” section) to see how you can 
apply these approaches for reducing a project’s time to your own project.
Figure 5-6 illustrates your initial 57-minute plan. If arriving at the lake in 57 min-
utes is okay, your analysis is done. But suppose you and your friend agree that 
you must reach the lake no later than 45 minutes after you start preparing on 
Saturday morning. What changes can you make to save you 12 minutes?
 
You may be tempted to change the estimated time for the drive from 30 min-
utes to 18 minutes, figuring that you’ll just drive faster. Unfortunately, doing 
so doesn’t work if the drive really takes 30 minutes. Remember, your plan rep-
resents an approach that you believe has a chance to work (though not neces-
sarily one that’s guaranteed). If you have to drive at speeds in excess of 100 
miles per hour over dirt roads to drive to the lake in 18 minutes, reducing the 
duration estimate has no chance of working. (However, doing so does have an 
excellent chance of getting you a speeding ticket.)
To develop a more realistic plan to reduce your project’s schedule, take the 
following steps:
 
1. Start to reduce your project’s time by finding the critical path and 
reducing its time until a second path becomes critical.
 
2. To reduce your project’s time further, shorten both critical paths by 
the same amount until a third path becomes critical.
 
3. To reduce the time still further, shorten all three critical paths by the 
same amount of time until a fourth path becomes critical, and so on.

118
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
Performing activities at the same time
One way to shorten the time it takes to do a group of activities is by taking 
one or more activities off the critical path and doing them in parallel with the 
remaining activities. However, often you have to be creative to simultane-
ously perform activities successfully.
 
Consider the 57-minute solution to the picnic example in Figure 5-6. Assume 
an automatic teller machine (ATM) is next to the gas station that you use. If 
you use a full-service gas island, you can get money from the ATM while the 
attendant fills your gas tank. This strategy allows you to perform Activities 2 
and 6 at the same time — in a total of 10 minutes rather than the 15 minutes 
you indicated in the initial network diagram.
At first glance, it appears you can cut the total time down to 52 minutes by 
making this change. But look again. These two activities aren’t on the critical 
path, so completing them more quickly has no impact on the overall project 
schedule. (Before you think you can save five minutes by helping your friend 
make the sandwiches, remember: You agreed that you can’t swap jobs.)
Now you have to try again. This time, remember you must reduce the length 
of the critical path if you want to save time. Here’s another idea: On your 
drive to the lake, you and your friend are both in the car, but only one of you 
is driving. The other person is just sitting there. If you agree to drive, your 
friend can load the fixings for the sandwiches into the car and make the sand-
wiches while you drive. This adjustment appears to take ten minutes off the 
critical path. But does it really?
The diagram in Figure 5-6 reveals that the upper path (Activities 2 and 6) 
takes 15 minutes and the lower path (Activities 7 and 3) takes 20 minutes. 
Because the lower path is the critical path, removing five minutes from it can 
reduce the time to complete the overall project by five minutes. However, 
reducing the lower path by five minutes makes it the same length (15 min-
utes) as the upper path. As a result, both paths take 15 minutes, and both are 
now critical.
Taking an additional five minutes off the lower path (because the sandwiches 
take ten minutes to make) doesn’t save more time for the overall project because 
the upper path still takes 15 minutes. However, removing the extra five minutes 
from the lower path does add five minutes of slack to the lower path.
Figure 5-7 reflects this change in your network diagram. Now you can con-
sider using your first idea to get money at the ATM while an attendant fills 
your car with gas. This time, this move can save you five minutes because 
the upper path is now critical.
Finally, you can decide which lake to visit and load the car at the same time, 
which saves you an additional two minutes. Figure 5-8 illustrates the final 
45-minute solution.

Consider a situation in which you have to complete two or more activities 
before you can work on two or more new ones. Show this relationship in your 
diagram by defining a milestone that represents completion of the activities, 
drawing arrows from the activities to this milestone and then drawing arrows 
from that milestone to the new activities (refer to Figure 5-8).
In the example, you first complete the activities Get money, Buy gasoline, and 
Boil eggs, and then you can perform the activities Load car and Decide which 
lake. You represent this relationship by drawing arrows from each of the first 
three activities to a newly defined milestone, Ready to load car, and by drawing 
arrows from that milestone to the activities Load car and Decide which lake.
 
If you think this analysis is getting complicated, you’re right. You pay a price 
to perform a group of activities faster. This price includes
 
✓ Increased planning time: You have to detail precisely all the activities 
and their interrelationships because you can’t afford to make mistakes.
 
✓ Increased risks: The list of assumptions grows, increasing the chances 
that one or more will turn out to be wrong.

120
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
In the picnic-at-the-lake example, you make the following assumptions to 
arrive at a possible 45-minute solution:
 
✓ You can get right into the full-service island at a little after 8 a.m.
 
✓ Attendants are available to fill up your tank as soon as you pull into the 
full-service island.
 
✓ The ATM is free and working when you pull into the full-service island.
 
✓ You and your friend can load the car and make a decision together with-
out getting into an argument that takes an hour to resolve.
 
✓ Your friend can make sandwiches in the moving car without totally 
destroying the car’s interior in the process.
At the same time that making assumptions can increase the risks involved in 
your possible project schedule, identifying the assumptions you make can 
increase the chances that those assumptions will come true — or at least 
convince you to develop contingency plans in case they don’t.
Consider your assumption that you can get right into a full-service island at 
about 8 a.m. on Saturday. You can call the gas station owner and ask whether 
your assumption is reasonable. If the gas station owner tells you he has no idea 
how long you’ll have to wait for someone to pump your gas, you may ask him 
whether it would make a difference if you paid him $200 in cash. When he imme-
diately promises to cordon off the full-service island from 7:55 a.m. until 8:20 a.m. 
and assign two attendants to wait there, one with a nozzle and the other with a 
charge receipt ready to be filled out (so you’ll be out in ten minutes), you real-
ize you can reduce most uncertainties for a price! Your job is to determine how 
much you can reduce the uncertainty and what price you have to pay to do so.
Devising an entirely new strategy
So you have a plan for getting to the lake in 45 minutes. You can’t guarantee 
the plan will work, but at least you have a chance. However, suppose your 
friend now tells you he really needs to get to the lake in 10 minutes, not 45! 
Your immediate reaction is probably “Impossible!” You figure creative plan-
ning is one thing, but how can you get to the lake in 10 minutes when the 
drive alone takes 30 minutes?
By deciding that you absolutely can’t arrive at the lake in 10 minutes when 
the drive alone takes 30 minutes, you’ve forgotten that the true indicator of 
success in this project is arriving at the lake for your picnic, not performing 
a predetermined set of activities. Your original seven activities were fine, as 
long as they allowed you to get to the lake within your set constraints. But if 
the activities won’t allow you to achieve success as you now define it (arriv-
ing at the lake in ten minutes), consider changing the activities.
Suppose you decide to find a way other than driving to get from your home 
to the lake. After some checking, you discover that you can rent a helicopter 

121
 Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?
for $500 per day that’ll fly you and your friend to the lake in ten minutes. 
However, you figure that you both were thinking about spending a total of 
$10 on your picnic (for admission to the park at the lake). You conclude that 
it makes no sense to spend $500 to get to a $10 picnic, so you don’t even tell 
your friend about the possibility of renting the helicopter. Instead, you just 
reaffirm that getting to the lake in ten minutes is impossible. Unfortunately, 
when you decided not to tell your friend about the helicopter option, you 
didn’t know your friend found out that he could make a $10,000 profit on a 
business deal if he could get to the lake in ten minutes. Is it worth spending 
$500 to make $10,000? Sure. But you didn’t know about the $10,000 when you 
gave up on getting to the lake in ten minutes.
 
When developing schedule options, it’s not your job to preempt someone else 
from making a decision. Instead, you want to present all options and their 
associated costs and benefits to the decision maker so he can make the best 
decision. In this instance, you should’ve told your friend about the helicopter 
option so he could’ve considered it when he made the final decision.
Subdividing activities
You can often reduce the time to complete a sequence of activities by subdivid-
ing one or more of the activities and performing parts of them at the same time. 
To relate back to the picnic-at-the-lake example, your friend can save seven 
minutes when boiling the eggs and preparing the egg sandwiches by using the 
approach I illustrate in Figure 5-9. Here’s what your friend needs to do:
 
✓ Divide the activity of boiling the eggs into two parts:
 
• Prepare to boil the eggs: Remove the pot from the cupboard, take 
the eggs out of the refrigerator, put the water and eggs in the pot, 
put the pot on the stove, and turn on the heat — estimated dura-
tion of three minutes.
 
• Boil the eggs in water: Allow the eggs to boil in a pot until they’re 
hard — estimated duration of seven minutes.
 
✓ Divide the activity of making the egg sandwiches into two parts:
 
• Perform the initial steps to make the sandwiches: Take the bread, 
mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomatoes out of the refrigerator; take the 
wax paper out of the drawer; put the bread on the wax paper; put 
the mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomatoes on the bread — estimated 
duration of seven minutes.
 
• Finish making the sandwiches: Take the eggs out of the pot; shell, 
slice, and put them on the bread; slice and finish wrapping the 
sandwiches — estimated duration of three minutes.
 
✓ First prepare to boil the eggs; next boil the eggs in water and perform 
the initial steps to make sandwiches at the same time; finally, finish 
making the sandwiches.

As Figure 5-9 illustrates, the total time to boil the eggs and prepare the sand-
wiches is: 3 minutes + 7 minutes + 3 minutes = 13 minutes. Note: The total 
time for the original activity to boil the eggs is still ten minutes (three min-
utes to prepare and seven minutes in the water), and the total time for the 
original activity to make the sandwiches is also still ten minutes (seven min-
utes for the initial steps and three minutes to finish up). But by subdividing 
the activities and scheduling them in greater detail, you can complete them 
in 13 minutes rather than 20.
Estimating Activity Duration
A duration estimate is your best sense of how long you need to actually per-
form an activity. The estimate is not how long you want the activity to take or 
how long someone tells you it must take; the estimate is how long you think it 
really will take.
 
Overly optimistic or unrealistically short duration estimates can cause an 
activity to take longer than necessary for the following two reasons:
 
✓ Because unrealistic estimates appear to meet your schedule targets, you 
don’t seek realistic alternative strategies that increase the chances of 
accomplishing activities in their declared durations.
 
✓ If people believe duration estimates are totally unrealistic, they’ll stop 
trying to achieve them. When delays occur during an activity, people will 
accept them as inevitable instead of seeking ways to overcome them.
This section looks more closely at what you need to estimate activity dura-
tion accurately, including an understanding of the activity’s components and 
processes and the resources required to support these processes.

123
 Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?
Determining the underlying factors
The underlying makeup of an activity determines how long it will take to com-
plete. Therefore, accurately estimating that activity’s duration requires you 
to describe its different aspects and determine the effect of each one on the 
activity’s length.
 
When estimating an activity’s duration, consider past experience, expert opin-
ion, and other available sources of information to clarify the following compo-
nents of the activity:
 
✓ Work performed by people: Physical and mental activities that people 
perform, such as writing a report, assembling a piece of equipment, and 
thinking of ideas for an ad campaign
 
✓ Work performed by nonhuman resources: Activities that computers 
and other machines perform, such as testing software on a computer 
and printing a report on a high-speed copy machine
 
✓ Physical processes: Physical or chemical reactions, such as concrete 
curing, paint drying, and chemical reactions in a laboratory
 
✓ Time delays: Time during which nothing is happening, such as needing 
to reserve a conference room two weeks before holding a meeting (Time 
delays are typically due to the unavailability of resources.)
Considering resource characteristics
Knowing the types of resources an activity requires can help you improve 
your estimate of the activity’s duration. For example, not all copy machines 
generate copies at the same rate. Specifying the characteristics of the par-
ticular machine you’ll use to make copies can improve the activity’s duration 
estimate.
To support project work, you may need the following types of resources: per-
sonnel, equipment, facilities, raw materials, information, and funds. For each 
resource you need, you have to determine its
 
✓ Capacity: Productivity per unit time period
 
✓ Availability: When a resource will be available
For example, a copy machine that produces 1,000 copies per minute can com-
plete a job in half the time a machine that produces 500 copies per minute 
requires. Likewise, a large printing job can take half as long if you have 
access to a copy machine for four hours a day rather than two hours a day. 
(See Chapter 7 for more information on estimating project requirements for 
nonhuman resources.)

124
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
Finding sources of supporting information
The first step toward improving your estimate’s accuracy is to take into 
account the right kinds of information, such as determining how long similar 
activities have actually taken in the past rather than how long people thought 
they would or should take. However, your estimate’s accuracy also depends 
on the accuracy of the information you use to derive it.
 
The information you need often has no single authoritative source. Therefore, 
compare information from the following sources as you prepare your duration 
estimates:
 
✓ Historical records of how long similar activities have taken in the past
 
✓ People who’ve performed similar activities in the past
 
✓ People who’ll be working on the activities
 
✓ Experts familiar with the type of activity, even if they haven’t performed 
the exact activity before
Improving activity duration estimates
In addition to ensuring accurate and complete data, do the following to 
improve the quality of your duration estimates (see Chapter 4 for more 
details about how to define and describe your project’s activities):
 
✓ Define your activities clearly. Minimize the use of technical jargon, and 
describe work processes fully.
 
✓ Subdivide your activities until your lowest-level activity estimates are 
two weeks or less.
 
✓ Define activity start and end points clearly.
 
✓ Involve the people who’ll perform an activity when estimating its 
duration.
 
✓ Minimize the use of fudge factors. A fudge factor is an amount of 
time you add to your best estimate of duration “just to be safe.” 
Automatically estimating your final duration estimates to be 50 percent 
greater than your initial ones is an example. Fudge factors compromise 
your project planning for the following reasons:
 
• Work tends to expand to fill the allotted time. If you’re able to 
finish an activity in two weeks but use a 50-percent fudge factor to 
indicate a duration of three weeks, the likelihood that you’ll finish 
in less than three weeks is almost zero.
 
• People use fudge factors to avoid studying activities in sufficient 
depth; as a result, they can’t develop viable performance strategies.

125
 Chapter 5: You Want This Project Done When?
 
• Team members and other project audiences lose faith in your 
plan’s accuracy and feasibility because they know you’re playing 
with numbers rather than thinking activities through in detail.
 
No matter how hard you try, estimating duration accurately can be next to 
impossible for some activities. For example, you may have an exceptionally 
difficult time coming up with accurate duration estimates for activities you 
haven’t done before, activities you’ll perform in the future, and activities with 
a history of unpredictability. In these cases,
 
✓ Make the best estimate you can by following the approaches and guide-
lines in this section.
 
✓ Monitor activities closely as your project unfolds to identify details that 
may affect your initial estimate.
 
✓ Reflect any changes in your project schedule as soon as you become 
aware of them.
In situations where you’ve performed an activity many times before and have 
historical data on how long it took each time, you may be able to estimate 
with confidence how long the activity will take the next time you perform it. 
In less certain situations, however, you may choose to consider the activity’s 
duration as a random variable that can have a range of values with different 
probabilities.
 
The Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) is a network analysis 
methodology that treats an activity’s duration as a random variable with the 
probability of the variable having different values being described by a Beta 
distribution. According to the characteristics of a Beta distribution, you deter-
mine the average value (also called the expected value) of the activity’s dura-
tion from the following three time estimates:
 
✓ Optimistic estimate (to): If you perform the activity 100 times, its dura-
tion would be greater than or equal to this number 99 times.
 
✓ Most likely estimate (tm): If you perform the activity 100 times, the dura-
tion would be this number more times than any other.
 
✓ Pessimistic estimate (tp): If you perform this activity 100 times, its dura-
tion would be less than or equal to this number 99 times.
The expected value of the duration (te) is then defined by the following 
formula:
Expected value = te = (to + 4tm + tp) ÷ 6
 
If only a small number of activities in your network are uncertain, you may 
assign their durations to be equal to their expected values and determine 
the critical path, earliest and latest start and finish times, and slack times 
as before. However, if all activities in your network are uncertain, you may 

126
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
choose to develop three time estimates for each activity. In this case, you can 
use the properties of the Beta distribution to determine the probability that 
the length of the critical path falls within specified ranges on either side of the 
expected value.
Displaying Your Project’s Schedule
Unless all your activities are on a critical path, your network diagram doesn’t 
specify your exact schedule. Rather, it provides information for you to con-
sider when you develop your schedule. After you select your actual dates, 
choose one of the following formats in which to present your schedule:
 
✓ Milestone list: A table that lists milestones and the dates you plan to 
reach them
 
✓ Activity list: A table that lists activities and the dates you plan to start 
and end them
 
✓ Combined milestone/activity list: A table that includes milestone and 
activity dates
 
✓ Gantt chart: A timeline that illustrates when each activity starts, how 
long it continues, and when it ends
 
✓ Combined milestone and Gantt chart: A timeline that illustrates when 
activities start, how long they continue, when they end, and when 
selected milestones are achieved
Figure 5-10 presents the 45-minute schedule for your picnic at the lake (from 
Figure 5-8) in a milestone/activity list.
You may combine two or more formats into a single display. Figure 5-11 
illustrates a combined WBS, Responsibility Assignment Matrix (see Chapter 
10), and Gantt chart (in which triangles represent milestones) for the picnic-
at-the-lake example. In addition to requiring less paperwork to prepare and 
being easier to update and maintain than separate information documents, a 
combined display can provide greater insight into the plan by presenting two 
or more aspects together for ready comparison.
 
Each format can be effective in particular situations. Consider the following 
guidelines when choosing the format in which to display your schedule:
 
✓ Milestone lists and activity lists are more effective for indicating specific 
dates.
 
✓ The Gantt chart provides a clearer picture of the relative lengths of 
activities and times when they overlap.
 
✓ The Gantt chart provides a better high-level overview of a project.

Establishing Whom You Need, 
How Much, and When
In This Chapter
▶ Focusing first on people’s abilities
▶ Accurately planning your project’s personnel needs
▶ Striking a balance among all your resource commitments
I
 remember reading the following declaration by a stressed-out project 
manager: “We’ve done so much with so little for so long [that] they now 
expect us to do everything with nothing!”
The truth is, of course, you can’t accomplish anything with nothing; 
everything has a price. You live in a world of limited resources and not 
enough time, which means you always have more work to do than time and 
resources allow. After you decide which tasks to pursue, you need to do 
everything possible to perform them successfully.
Carefully planning for the personnel you need to perform your project 
increases your chances of succeeding by enabling you to
 
✓ Ensure the most qualified people available are assigned to each task.
 
✓ Explain more effectively to team members what you’re asking them to 
contribute to the project.
 
✓ Develop more accurate and realistic schedules.
 
✓ Ensure that people are on hand when they’re needed.
 
✓ Monitor resource expenditures to identify and address possible over-
runs or underruns.
Some organizations have procedures that detail and track every resource 
on every project. Other organizations don’t formally plan or track project 
resources at all. However, even if your organization doesn’t require you to 
plan your resource needs and track your resource use, doing so is invaluable 
to your project’s success.

130
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
This chapter helps you figure out whom you need on your project, when, and 
for how long. It also discusses how you can identify and manage conflicting 
demands for people’s time.
Getting the Information You Need 
to Match People to Tasks
Your project’s success rests on your ability to enlist the help of appropriately 
qualified people to perform your project’s work. You begin your project plan-
ning by determining your project’s required results and major deliverables 
(see Chapter 2 for details on how to do this). You continue your planning by 
detailing the intermediate and final deliverables that your project must gen-
erate in a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS; see Chapter 4 for more informa-
tion). Your next step is to decide which activities you’ll need performed 
to create the deliverables identified in your project’s work packages (the 
lowest-level components in the WBS) and to determine the skills and knowl-
edge people must have to perform them.
As you find out in the following sections, getting appropriately qualified 
people to perform your project’s activities entails the following two steps:
 
✓ Determining the skills and knowledge that each activity requires
 
✓ Confirming that the people assigned to those activities possess the 
required skills and knowledge and that they’re genuinely interested in 
working on their assignments
 
A skill is something you must be able to do to perform an activity successfully. 
Knowledge is information you must have in your head to be able to perform 
an activity successfully. Interest is your personal desire to know about and 
be involved with the subject matter of an activity and to have a part in suc-
cessfully producing the result of the activity. Possessing the necessary skills 
and knowledge means you’re capable of doing a task. Being interested in the 
task increases the chances you’ll apply your skills and knowledge to actually 
accomplish the task successfully.
Deciding the skills and knowledge 
that team members must have
To begin deciding the skills and knowledge that people must have for your 
project, obtain a complete list of all your project’s activities. Specify your 
project’s activities by decomposing all the work packages (the lowest-level 
WBS components) in your project’s WBS into the individual actions required 
to complete them.

131
 Chapter 6: Establishing Whom You Need, How Much, and When
 
You may find information to help you complete this task in your project’s WBS 
dictionary; you identify and describe your project’s activities and their impor-
tant characteristics — such as a unique name and identifier code, duration, 
predecessors, and successors — in this document. (See Chapter 4 for details 
on WBS dictionaries and decomposition.)
Next, determine each activity’s skill and knowledge requirements by review-
ing activity descriptions and consulting with subject-matter experts, your 
human resources department, and people who have worked on similar proj-
ects and activities in the past.
 
Because you’ll ask functional managers and others in the organization to 
assign staff to your project who have the specified skills and knowledge that 
your project work requires, you should check with these people before you 
prepare your list of required skills and knowledge to see whether they have 
developed any skills rosters and, if they haven’t, the schemes (if any) that 
they or the organization currently uses to describe staff’s skills and knowl-
edge. Then, if possible, you can use the same or a similar scheme to describe 
your project’s skill and knowledge requirements to make it easier for the man-
agers to identify those people who are appropriately qualified to address your 
project’s requirements.
 
For most situations, you need to know two pieces of information about a task 
to determine the qualifications that a person must have to perform it:
 
✓ The required levels of proficiency in the needed skills and knowledge
 
✓ Whether the assignment will entail working under someone else’s guid-
ance when applying the skills or knowledge, working alone to apply the 
skills or knowledge, or managing others who are applying the skills or 
knowledge.
An example of a scheme that describes these two aspects of a skill or knowl-
edge requirement is (X, Y). X is the required level of proficiency in the skill or 
knowledge and has the following values:
 
✓ 1 = requires a basic level of proficiency
 
✓ 2 = requires an intermediate level of proficiency
 
✓ 3 = requires an advanced level of proficiency
Y is the required working relationship when applying the skill or knowledge 
and has the following values:
 
✓ a = doesn’t entail managing others using the skill or knowledge
 
✓ b = entails managing others using the skill or knowledge

132
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
 
In addition to providing a basis for assigning appropriately qualified people to 
project teams, information about employees’ skills and knowledge can also 
support
 
✓ Training: The organization can develop or make available training in 
areas in which the organization has shortages.
 
✓ Career development: The organization can encourage individuals to 
develop skills and knowledge that are in short supply to increase their 
opportunities for assuming greater responsibilities in the organization.
 
✓ Recruiting: Recruiters can look to hire people who have the capabilities 
that will qualify them for specific job needs in the organization.
 
✓ Proposal writing and new business development: Information about 
people’s skills and knowledge can be included in proposals to demon-
strate the organization’s capability to perform particular types of work.
Representing skills, knowledge, 
and interests in a Skills Matrix
Whether you’re able to influence the people assigned to your project team, 
people are assigned to your team without your input, or you assume the role 
of project manager of an existing team, you need to confirm the skills, knowl-
edge, and interest of your team members.
If you have a team that was assembled without considering your opinion on 
the capabilities needed to perform your project’s work, it’s essential that 
you find out team members’ skills, knowledge, and interests so you can make 
the most appropriate task assignments. If some or all of your team has been 
chosen in response to the specific skills and knowledge needs that you dis-
cussed with the organization’s management, you should document people’s 
skills and knowledge and verify their interests, in case you need to assign 
people to unanticipated tasks that crop up or if you have to replace a team 
member unexpectedly.
 
A Skills Matrix is a table that displays people’s proficiency in specified skills 
and knowledge, as well as their interest in working on assignments using these 
skills and knowledge. Figure 6-1 presents an example of a portion of a Skills 
Matrix. The left-hand column identifies skill and knowledge areas, and the top 
row lists people’s names. At the intersection of the rows and columns, you 
identify the level of each person’s particular skills, knowledge, and interests.
Figure 6-1 shows that Sue has an advanced level of proficiency in technical 
writing and can work independently with little or no supervision. In addi-
tion, she’s interested in working on technical writing assignments. Ed has 
an advanced level of proficiency in the area of legal research and is capable 
of managing others engaged in legal research. However, he’d prefer not to 

133
 Chapter 6: Establishing Whom You Need, How Much, and When
work on legal research tasks. Instead, he would like to work on questionnaire 
design activities, but he currently has no skills or knowledge in this area.

By the way, you may assume that you’ll never assign Ed to work on a ques-
tionnaire design activity because he has no relevant skills or knowledge. 
However, if you’re trying to find more people who can develop question-
naires, Ed is a prime candidate. Because he wants to work on these types 
of assignments, he is most likely willing to put in extra effort to acquire the 
skills needed to do so.
Take the following steps to prepare a Skills Matrix for your team:
 
1. Discuss with each team member his or her skills, knowledge, and 
interests related to the activities that your project entails.
 
 Explain that you seek this information so you can assign people to the 
tasks that they’re most interested in and qualified to perform.
 
2. Determine each person’s level of interest in working on the tasks for 
which he or she has been proposed.
 
 At a minimum, ask people whether they’re interested in the tasks for 
which they’ve been proposed. If a person isn’t interested in a task, try 
to find out why and whether there is anything you can do to modify the 
assignment to make it more interesting to him or her.

134
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
 
 If a person isn’t interested in a task, you can either not ask and not know 
the reason, or ask and (if you get an honest response) know the reason. 
Knowing that a person isn’t interested is better than not knowing, 
because you can consider the possibility of rearranging assignments or 
modifying the assignment to address those aspects of it that the person 
doesn’t find appealing.
 
3. Consult with team members’ functional managers and/or the people 
who assigned them to your project to determine their opinions of the 
levels of each team member’s skills, knowledge, and interests.
 
 You want to understand the reasons why these managers assigned the 
people they did to your project.
 
4. Check to see whether any areas of your organization have already 
prepared Skills Matrices.
 
 Find out whether they reflect any information about the extent to which 
team members have skills and knowledge that you feel are required for 
your project’s activities.
 
5. Incorporate all the information you gather in a Skills Matrix, and 
review with each team member the portion of the matrix that contains 
his or her information.
 
 This review gives you the opportunity to verify that you correctly 
recorded the information you found and the team member a chance to 
comment on or add to any of the information.
Estimating Needed Commitment
Just having the right skills and knowledge to do a task doesn’t necessarily 
guarantee that a person will successfully complete it. The person must also 
have sufficient time to perform the necessary work. This section tells you 
how to prepare a Human Resources Matrix to display the amount of effort 
people will have to put in to complete their tasks. In addition, this section 
explains how you can take into account productivity, efficiency, and availabil-
ity to make your work-effort estimates more accurate.
Using a Human Resources Matrix
Planning your personnel needs begins with identifying whom you need and 
how much effort they have to invest. You can use a Human Resources Matrix 
to display this information (see Figure 6-2 for an example of this matrix). The 
Human Resources Matrix depicts the people assigned to each project activity 
and the work effort each person will contribute to each assignment.

Description

Analyst
Personnel (Person-hours)
 
Work effort or person effort is the actual time a person spends doing an activity. 
You can express work effort in units of person-hours, person-days, person-
weeks, and so forth. (You may still hear people express work effort as man-
hours or man-days. Same concept — just outdated and politically incorrect!)
Work effort is related to, but different from, duration. Work effort is a measure 
of resource use; duration is a measure of time passage (see Chapter 5 for 
more discussion of duration). Consider the work effort to complete the ques-
tionnaire design work package in the Human Resources Matrix in Figure 6-2. 
According to the matrix, J. Jones works on this activity for 32 person-hours, 
and an unnamed analyst works on it for 24 person-hours.
Knowing the work effort required to complete a work package alone, however, 
doesn’t tell you the duration of the work package. For example, if both people 
assigned to the questionnaire design work package in Figure 6-2 can do their work 
on it at the same time, if they’re both assigned 100 percent to the project, and if 
no other aspects of the task take additional time, the activity may be finished in 
four days. However, if either person is available for less than 100 percent of the 
time, if one or both people must work overtime, or if one person has to finish her 
work before the other can start, the duration won’t be four days.
Identifying needed personnel in 
a Human Resources Matrix
Begin to create your Human Resources Matrix by specifying in the top row the 
different types of personnel you need for your project. You can use three types 
of information to identify the people you need to have on your project team:
 
✓ Skills and knowledge: The specific skills and knowledge that the person 
who’ll do the work must have
 
✓ Position name or title: The job title or the name of the position of the 
person who’ll do the work
 
✓ Name: The name of the person who’ll do the work

136
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
 
Eventually, you want to specify all three pieces of information for each project 
team member. Early in your planning, try to specify needed skills and knowl-
edge, such as must be able to develop work process flow charts or must be able 
to use Microsoft PowerPoint. If you can identify the exact skills and knowledge 
that a person must have for a particular task, you increase the chances that 
the proper person will be assigned.
 
Often, you want to identify people you want on your project by name. The 
reason is simple: If you’ve worked with someone before and he’s done a good 
job, you want to work with him again. Although it’s great for that person’s 
ego, this method, unfortunately, often reduces the chances that you’ll get an 
appropriately qualified person to work on your project. People who develop 
reputations for excellence often get more requests to participate on projects 
than they can handle. When you don’t specify the skills and knowledge needed 
to perform the particular work on your project, the manager — who has to 
find a substitute for that overextended person — doesn’t know what skills and 
knowledge that the alternate needs to have.
 
On occasion, you may use a position description or title (such as operations 
specialist) to identify a needed resource. In doing so, you assume anyone with 
that title has the necessary skills and knowledge. Unfortunately, titles are often 
vague, and position descriptions are frequently out of date. Therefore, using 
titles or position descriptions are risky ways to get the right person for the job.
Estimating required work effort
For all work packages, estimate the work effort that each person has to 
invest, and enter the numbers in the appropriate boxes in the Human 
Resources Matrix (refer to Figure 6-2). As you develop your work-effort esti-
mates, do the following:
 
✓ Describe in detail all work related to performing the activity. Include 
work directly and indirectly related:
 
• Examples of work directly related to an activity include writing 
a report, meeting with clients, performing a laboratory test, and 
designing a new logo.
 
• Examples of indirectly related work include training to perform activity-
related work and preparing periodic activity-progress reports.
 
✓ Consider history. Past history doesn’t guarantee future performance, 
but it does provide a guideline for what’s possible. Determine whether 
a work package has been done before. If it has, review written records 
to determine the work effort spent on it. If written records weren’t kept, 
ask people who’ve done the activity before to estimate the work effort 
they invested.

137
 Chapter 6: Establishing Whom You Need, How Much, and When
 
 When using prior history to support your estimates, make sure
 
• The people who performed the work had qualifications and experi-
ence similar to those of the people who’ll work on your project.
 
• The facilities, equipment, and technology used were similar to 
those that’ll be used for your project.
 
• The time frame was similar to the one you anticipate for your 
project.
 
✓ Have the person who’ll actually do the work participate in estimating 
the amount of work effort that will be required. Having people contrib-
ute to their work-effort estimates provides the following benefits:
 
• Their understanding of the activity improves.
 
• The estimates are based on their particular skills, knowledge, and 
prior experience, which makes them more accurate.
 
• Their commitment to do the work for that level of work effort 
increases.
 
 If you know who’ll be working on the activity, have those people par-
ticipate during the initial planning. If people don’t join the project team 
until the start of or during the project, have them review and comment 
on the plans you’ve developed. Then update your plans as needed.
 
✓ Consult with experts familiar with the type of work you need done 
on your project, even if they haven’t performed work exactly like it 
before. Incorporating experience and knowledge from different sources 
improves the accuracy of your estimate.
Factoring productivity, efficiency, and 
availability into work-effort estimates
Being assigned to a project full time doesn’t mean a person can perform 
project work at peak productivity 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year. 
Additional personal and organizational activities reduce the amount of work 
people produce. Therefore, consider each of the following factors when you 
estimate the number of hours that people need to complete their project 
assignments:
 
✓ Productivity: The results a person produces per unit of time that he 
spends on an activity. The following factors affect a person’s productivity:
 
• Knowledge and skills: The raw talent and capability a person has 
to perform a particular task
 
• Prior experience: A person’s familiarity with the work and the 
typical problems of a particular task

138
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
 
• Sense of urgency: A person’s drive to generate the desired results 
within established time frames (urgency influences a person’s 
focus and concentration on an activity)
 
• Ability to switch among several tasks: A person’s level of comfort 
moving to a second task when he hits a roadblock in his first one 
so that he doesn’t sit around stewing about his frustrations and 
wasting time
 
• The quality and setup of the physical environment: Proximity 
and arrangement of a person’s furniture and the support equip-
ment he uses; also the availability and condition of the equipment 
and resources
 
✓ Efficiency: The proportion of time a person spends on project work as 
opposed to organizational tasks that aren’t related to specific projects. 
The following factors affect a person’s efficiency:
 
• Non-project-specific professional activities: The time a person 
spends attending general organization meetings, handling inciden-
tal requests, and reading technical journals and periodicals about 
his field of specialty
 
• Personal activities: The time a person spends getting a drink of 
water, going to the restroom, organizing his work area, conducting 
personal business on the job, and talking about non-work-related 
topics with coworkers
 
 The more time a person spends each day on non-project-specific and 
personal activities, the less time he has to work on his project assign-
ments. (Check out the nearby sidebar “The truth is out: How workers 
really spend their time” for more info. I also discuss efficiency in the 
upcoming two sections.)
 
✓ Availability: The portion of time a person is at the job as opposed to 
on leave. Organizational policy regarding employee vacation days, sick 
days, holidays, personal days, mental health days, administrative leave, 
and so on define a person’s availability.
 
When deciding how many work-hours to budget for a person to do a particu-
lar task, adjust the number required at peak performance to allow for actual 
levels of productivity, efficiency, and availability.
Reflecting efficiency when 
you use historical data
How you reflect efficiency in your estimates depends on whether and how 
you track work effort. If you base your work-effort estimates on historical 
data from time sheets and if either of the following situations is true, you 
don’t have to factor in a separate measure for efficiency:

139
 Chapter 6: Establishing Whom You Need, How Much, and When
 
✓ Your time sheets have one or more categories to show time spent on 
non-project-specific work, and people accurately report the actual 
time they spend on their different activities.
 
 In this case, the historical data represent the actual number of hours 
people worked on the activity in the past. Thus, you can comfortably 
use the numbers from your time sheets to estimate the actual level of 
effort this activity will require in the future, as long as people continue 
to record in separate categories the hours they spend on non-project-
specific activities.
 
✓ Your time sheets have no category for recording time spent on non-
project-specific work. However, you report accurately (by activity) 
the time you spend on work-related activities, and you apportion in a 
consistent manner your non-project-specific work among the available 
project activities.
 
 In this case, the historical data reflect the number of hours that people 
recorded they spent on the activity in the past, which includes time they 
actually spent on the activity and a portion of the total time they spent 
on non-project-specific work.
 
 Again, if people’s time-recording practices haven’t changed, you can use 
these numbers to estimate the hours that people will record doing this 
same activity in the future.
The truth is out: How workers 
really spend their time
A number of years ago, I read a study that 
determined that the typical employee spends 
an average of four hours of an eight-hour work 
day on preplanned project activities and work 
assignments. The interviewers in this study 
spoke with people with a wide range of job 
responsibilities from more than 100 organiza-
tions. In other words, the typical employee in 
this study averaged a work efficiency of 50 per-
cent!
Since then I have found several organizations 
that conducted similar studies of their own 
operations. These organizations all found work-
ers’ efficiency to be about 75 percent. You may 
think the workers in these companies were 
more efficient than the ones in the previous 
study, but, in fact, these studies were biased. 
The people surveyed wanted their organiza-
tions to think they were spending most of their 
time working on project assignments, and the 
organizations wanted to believe their employ-
ees were doing so. Still, the organization stud-
ies found that people spent about 25 percent 
of each day doing something other than pre-
planned, project-related activities!

140
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
 
When collected properly, time sheets provide the most reliable source of past 
experience. However, the following time-sheet practices can cause the data on 
them to be inaccurate:
 
✓ People aren’t allowed to record overtime, so some hours actually spent 
on an activity may never be known.
 
✓ People fill out their time sheets for a period several days before the 
period is over, so they must guess what their hourly allocations for the 
next several days will be.
 
✓ People copy the work-effort estimates from the project plan onto their 
time sheets each period instead of recording the actual number of hours 
they spend.
If any of these situations exist in your organization, don’t use historical data 
from time sheets to support your work-effort estimates for your current proj-
ect. Instead, use one or more of the approaches discussed in the earlier sec-
tion “Estimating required work effort.”
Accounting for efficiency in personal 
work-effort estimates
If you base work-effort estimates on the opinions of people who’ll do the 
activities or who have done similar activities in the past instead of on histori-
cal records, you have to factor in a measure of efficiency.
First, ask the person from whom you’re getting your information to estimate 
the required work effort assuming he could work at 100 percent efficiency. 
(In other words, ask him not to worry about normal interruptions during the 
day, having to work on multiple tasks at a time, and so on.) Then modify the 
estimate to reflect efficiency by doing the following:
 
✓ If the person will use a time sheet that has one or more categories for 
non-project-specific work, use his original work-effort estimate.
 
✓ If the person will use a time sheet that doesn’t have categories to record 
non-project-specific work, add an additional amount to his original esti-
mate to account for his efficiency.
As an example, suppose a person estimates that he needs 30 person-hours to 
perform a task (if he can be 100 percent efficient) and his time sheets have no 

141
 Chapter 6: Establishing Whom You Need, How Much, and When
categories for recording non-project-specific work. If you estimate that he’ll 
work at about 75 percent efficiency, allow him to charge 40 person-hours 
to your project to complete the task. (75 percent of 40 person-hours is 30 
person-hours — the amount you really need.)
Failure to consider efficiency when estimating and reviewing project work 
effort can lead to incorrect conclusions about people’s performance. 
Suppose your boss assigns you a project on Monday morning. He tells you 
the project will take about 40 person-hours, but he really needs it by Friday 
close of business. Suppose further that you work intensely all week and finish 
the task by Friday close of business. In the process, you record 55 hours for 
the project on your time sheet.
If your boss doesn’t realize that his initial estimate of 40 person-hours was 
based on your working at 100 percent efficiency, he’ll think you took 15 hours 
longer than you should have. On the other hand, if your boss recognizes that 
55 person-hours on the job translates into about 40 person-hours of work on 
specific project tasks, your boss will appreciate that you invested extra effort 
to meet his aggressive deadline.
 
Although your performance is the same, overlooking the impact of efficiency 
makes you appear less capable, while correctly considering it makes you 
appear intensely dedicated.
 
The longer you’re involved in an assignment, the more important efficiency 
and availability become. Suppose you decide you have to spend one hour on 
an assignment. You can reasonably figure your availability is 100 percent and 
your efficiency is 100 percent, so you charge your project one hour for the 
assignment. If you need to spend six hours on an assignment, you can figure 
your availability is 100 percent, but you must consider 75 percent efficiency 
(or a similar planning figure). Therefore, charge one workday (eight work 
hours) to ensure that you can spend the six hours on your assignment.
However, if you plan to devote one month or more to your assignment, you’ll 
most likely take some leave days during that time. Even though your project 
budget doesn’t have to pay for your annual or sick leave, one person-month 
means you have about 97 hours for productive work on your assignment, 
assuming 75 percent efficiency and 75 percent availability (2,080 hours total 
in a year ÷ 12 months in a year × 0.75 × 0.75).
The numbers in Table 6-1 depict productive person-hours available at dif-
ferent levels of efficiency and availability. If your organization uses different 
levels of efficiency or availability, develop your own planning figures.

In addition to reflecting the influence of efficiency and availability, improve 
the accuracy of your work-effort estimates by doing the following:
 
✓ Define your work packages clearly. Minimize the use of technical jargon, 
and describe associated work processes (see Chapter 4 for more details).
 
✓ Subdivide your work. Do so until you estimate that your lowest-level 
activities will take two person-weeks or less.
 
✓ Update work-effort estimates when project personnel or task assign-
ments change.
Ensuring Your Project Team Members Can 
Meet Their Resource Commitments
If you work on only one activity at a time, determining whether you’re over-
committed can be straightforward. But suppose you plan to work on several 
activities that partially overlap during a particular time period. Then you 
must decide when to work on each activity to see whether your multitasking 
has left you overcommitted.
This section shows you how to schedule your work effort for a task, how to 
identify resource overloads, and how to resolve those overloads.
Planning your initial allocations
The first step in making sure you can handle all your project commitments is 
to decide when you’ll work on each activity. If your initial plan has you work-
ing on more than one activity at the same time, your next task is to determine 
the total level of effort you’ll have to devote each time period to meet your 
multiple commitments.

143
 Chapter 6: Establishing Whom You Need, How Much, and When
Begin planning out your workload by developing
 
✓ A Human Resources Matrix (see the earlier section “Using a Human 
Resources Matrix” for more info)
 
✓ A Person-Loading Graph or Chart for each individual in the Human 
Resources Matrix
 
A Person-Loading Graph (also called a Resource Histogram) is a bar graph that 
depicts the level of work effort you’ll spend each day, week, or month on an 
activity. A Person-Loading Chart presents the same information in a table. The 
graphical format highlights peaks, valleys, and overloads more effectively, 
while the tabular format presents exact work-effort amounts more clearly. 
Prepare a Person-Loading Chart or Graph for each project team member.
 
Suppose you plan to work on Activities 1, 2, and 3 of a project. Table 6-2 shows 
you plan that Activity 1 will take three weeks, Activity 2 will take two weeks, 
and Activity 3 will take three weeks. Table 6-2 also shows you estimate that 
you’ll spend 60 person-hours on Activity 1 (50 percent of your available time 
over the task’s three-week period), 40 person-hours on Activity 2 (50 percent 
of your available time over the task’s two-week period), and 30 person-hours 
on Activity 3 (25 percent of your available time over the task’s three-week 
period). (Consider that you’ve already accounted for efficiency in these esti-
mates — see the earlier section “Estimating Needed Commitment” for more on 
efficiency.) If you don’t have to work on more than one activity at a time, you 
should have no problem completing each of your three assignments.

However, instead of having you work on these activities one at a time, this 
initial schedule has you working on both Activities 1 and 2 in week 2 and on 
all three activities in week 3. You have to decide how much effort you’ll put 
in each week on each of the three tasks to see whether you can work on all 
three activities as they’re currently scheduled.
As a starting point, assume you’ll spend your time evenly over the life of each 
activity. That means you’ll work 20 hours a week on Activity 1 during weeks 1, 2, 
and 3, 20 hours a week on Activity 2 during weeks 2 and 3, and 10 hours a week 
on Activity 3 during weeks 3, 4, and 5, as depicted in the Gantt chart in Figure 6-3.

Determine the total effort you’ll have to devote to the overall project each 
week by adding up the person-hours you’ll spend on each task each week as 
follows:
 
✓ In week 1, you’ll work 20 person-hours on Activity 1 for a total commit-
ment to the project of 20 person-hours.
 
✓ In week 2, you’ll work 20 person-hours on Activity 1 and 20 person-hours 
on Activity 2 for a total commitment to the project of 40 person-hours.
 
✓ In week 3, you’ll work 20 person-hours on Activity 1, 20 person-hours on 
Activity 2, and 10 person-hours on Activity 3 for a total commitment to 
the project of 50 person-hours.
 
✓ In weeks 4 and 5, you’ll work 10 person-hours on Activity 3 for a total 
commitment to the project each week of 10 person-hours.
The Person-Loading Graph in Figure 6-3 shows these commitments. A quick 
review reveals that this plan has you working 10 hours of overtime in week 3. 
If you’re comfortable putting in this overtime, this plan works. If you aren’t, 
you have to come up with an alternative strategy to reduce your week 3 com-
mitments (see the next section for how to do so).

 Chapter 6: Establishing Whom You Need, How Much, and When
Resolving potential resource overloads
If you don’t change your time allocations for Activity 1 or 2 and you’re will-
ing to work only a total of 40 person-hours in week 3, you’ll accomplish less 
than you planned on one or both of the activities that you work on that week. 
Therefore, consider one or more of the following strategies to eliminate your 
overcommitment:
 
✓ Allocate your time unevenly over the duration of one or more activi-
ties. Instead of spending the same number of hours on an activity each 
week, plan to spend more hours some weeks than others.
 
 Suppose you choose to spend your hours unevenly over the duration of 
Activity 1 by increasing your commitment by 10 hours in the first week 
and reducing it by 10 hours in the third week, as depicted in the Gantt 
chart in Figure 6-4. The Person-Loading Graph in Figure 6-4 illustrates 
how this uneven distribution removes your overcommitment in week 3.

✓ Take advantage of any slack time that may exist in your assigned 
activities. Consider starting one or more activities earlier or later.
 
 Figure 6-5 illustrates that if Activity 3 has at least one week of slack 
time remaining after its currently planned end date, you can reduce 
your total work on the project in week 3 to 40 person-hours by delaying 
both the start and the end of Task 3 by one week. (See Chapter 5 for a 
detailed definition and discussion of slack time.)
 
✓ Assign some of the work you were planning to do in week 3 to some-
one else currently on your project, to a newly assigned team member, 
or to an external vendor or contractor. Reassigning 10 person-hours of 
your work in week 3 removes your overcommitment.

Coordinating assignments 
across multiple projects
Working on overlapping tasks can place conflicting demands on a person, 
whether the tasks are on one project or several. Although successfully 
addressing these conflicts can be more difficult when more than one project 
manager is involved, the techniques for analyzing them are the same whether 
you’re the only project manager involved or you’re just one of many. This 
section illustrates how you can use the techniques and displays from the pre-
vious sections to resolve resource conflicts that arise from working on two or 
more projects at the same time.
In general, people on any of your project teams may also be assigned to other 
projects you’re managing or to other project managers’ projects. If Summary 
Person-Loading Charts are available for each project your people are 
assigned to, you can manage each person’s overall resource commitments 
by combining the information from the projects’ Summary Person-Loading 
Charts into an Overall Summary Person-Loading Chart.

148
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
Figure 6-7 illustrates an Overall Summary Person-Loading Chart that shows 
the commitments for each person on one or more of your project teams. This 
Overall Summary Person-Loading Chart (titled “All Projects”) is derived from 
the Summary Person-Loading Charts for each of your team members’ projects.
Figure 6-7 indicates that you’re currently scheduled to work on Projects A, B, 
and C in February for 40, 20, and 40 person-hours, respectively. If someone 
requests that you be assigned to work on Project D for 60 person-hours in 
February, you have several options.
If you assume that you have a total of 160 person-hours available in February, 
you can devote 60 person-hours to Project D with no problem, because only 
100 person-hours are currently committed.
However, you don’t currently have available in February the other 20 person-
hours the person is requesting. Therefore, you can consider doing one of the 
following:
 
✓ Find someone to assume 20 person-hours of your commitments to 
Projects A, B, or C in February.
 
✓ Shift your work on one or more of these projects from February to 
January or March.
 
✓ Work overtime.

Chapter 7
Planning for Other Resources and 
Developing the Budget
In This Chapter
▶ Accounting for your project’s nonpersonnel resources
▶ Preparing a detailed budget for your project
A
 key part of effective project management is ensuring that nonperson-
nel resources are available throughout the project when and where 
they’re needed and according to specifications. When people are available 
for a scheduled task but the necessary computers and laboratory equipment 
aren’t, your project can have costly delays and unanticipated expenditures. 
Also, your team members may experience frustration that leads to reduced 
commitment.
In addition to clearly defined objectives, a workable schedule, and adequate 
resources, a successful project needs sufficient funds to support the required 
resources. All major project decisions (including whether to undertake it, 
whether to continue it, and — after it’s done — whether it was successful) 
must consider the project’s costs.
This chapter looks at how you can determine, specify, and display your non-
personnel resource needs and then how to develop your project budget.
Determining Nonpersonnel 
Resource Needs
In addition to personnel, your project may require a variety of other impor-
tant resources (such as furniture, fixtures, equipment, raw materials, and 
information). Plan for these nonpersonnel resources the same way you plan 

152
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
to meet your personnel requirements. (Check out Chapter 6 for more on 
meeting your personnel needs.) As part of your plan, develop the following:
 
✓ A nonpersonnel resources matrix
 
✓ Nonpersonnel usage charts
 
✓ A nonpersonnel summary usage chart
 
A nonpersonnel resources matrix displays the following information for every 
lowest-level component (or work package) in your project Work Breakdown 
Structure, or WBS (see Chapter 4 for a discussion of a WBS):
 
✓ The nonpersonnel resources needed to perform the activities that com-
prise the work package (For example, Figure 7-1 shows that you need 
computers, copiers, and use of a test laboratory to complete the three 
listed work packages.)
 
✓ The required amount of each resource (For example, Figure 7-1 suggests 
that you need 40 hours of computer time and 32 hours of the test labora-
tory to create a device. The shaded computer usage numbers in Figure 
7-1 are detailed by week in Figure 7-2, later in this chapter.)

Amount of Resource Required (Hours)
To estimate the amount of each resource you need, examine the nature of the 
task and the capacity of the resource. For example, determine the amount of 
copier time you need to reproduce a report by doing the following:
 
1. Estimate the number of report copies.
 
2. Estimate the number of pages per copy.
 
3. Specify the copier capacity in pages per unit of time.
 
4. Multiply the first two numbers and divide the result by the third 
number to determine the amount of copier time needed to reproduce 
your reports.

153
 Chapter 7: Planning for Other Resources and Developing the Budget
Ensuring that nonpersonnel resources are available when needed requires 
that you specify the times that you plan to use them. You can display this 
information in separate usage charts for each resource. Figure 7-2 illustrates 
a computer usage chart that depicts the amount of computer time each task 
requires during each week of your project. For example, the chart indicates 
that Task 1.2.1 requires six hours of computer time in week 1, four hours in 
week 2, six hours in week 3, and eight hours in each of weeks 4 and 5. You 
would prepare similar charts for required copier time and use of the test lab.

Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
Making Sense of the Dollars: 
Project Costs and Budgets
In a world of limited funds, you’re constantly deciding how to get the most 
return for your investment. Therefore, estimating a project’s costs is impor-
tant for several reasons:
 
✓ It enables you to weigh anticipated benefits against anticipated costs to 
see whether the project makes sense.
 
✓ It allows you to see whether the necessary funds are available to sup-
port the project.
 
✓ It serves as a guideline to help ensure that you have sufficient funds to 
complete the project.
Although you may not develop and monitor detailed budgets for all your 
projects, knowing how to work with project costs can make you a better proj-
ect manager and increase your chances of project success. This section looks 
at different types of project costs that you may encounter. It then offers help-
ful tips for developing your own project budget.
Looking at different types of project costs
 
A project budget is a detailed, time-phased estimate of all resource costs for 
your project. You typically develop a budget in stages — from an initial rough 
estimate to a detailed estimate to a completed, approved project budget. On 
occasion, you may even revise your approved budget while your project is in 
progress (check out “Refining your budget as you move through your proj-
ect’s stages” later in this chapter for more info).
 
Your project’s budget includes both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs 
are costs for resources solely used for your project. Direct costs include the 
following:
 
✓ Salaries for team members on your project
 
✓ Specific materials, supplies, and equipment for your project
 
✓ Travel to perform work on your project
 
✓ Subcontracts that provide support exclusively to your project

155
 Chapter 7: Planning for Other Resources and Developing the Budget
Indirect costs are costs for resources that support more than one project but 
aren’t readily identifiable with or chargeable to any of the projects individu-
ally. Indirect costs fall into the following two categories:
 
✓ Overhead costs: Costs for products and services for your project 
that are difficult to subdivide and allocate directly. Examples include 
employee benefits, office space rent, general supplies, and the costs of 
furniture, fixtures, and equipment.
 
 You need an office to work on your project activities, and office space 
costs money. However, your organization has an annual lease for office 
space, the space has many individual offices and work areas, and people 
work on numerous projects throughout the year. Because you have no 
clear records that specify the dollar amount of the total rent that’s just 
for the time you spend in your office working on just this project’s activi-
ties, your office space is treated as an indirect project cost.
 
✓ General and administrative costs: Expenditures that keep your organi-
zation operational (if your organization doesn’t exist, you can’t perform 
your project). Examples include salaries of your contracts department, 
finance department, and top management as well as fees for general 
accounting and legal services.
 
Suppose you’re planning to design, develop, and produce a company bro-
chure. Direct costs for this project may include the following:
 
✓ Labor: Salaries for you and other team members for the hours you work 
on the brochure
 
✓ Materials: The special paper stock for the brochure
 
✓ Travel: The costs for driving to investigate firms that may design your 
brochure cover
 
✓ Subcontract: The services of an outside company to design the cover art
Indirect costs for this project may include the following:
 
✓ Employee benefits: Benefits (such as annual, sick, and holiday leave; 
health and life insurance; and retirement plan contributions) in addition 
to salary while you and the other team members are working on the 
brochure
 
✓ Rent: The cost of the office space you use when you’re developing the 
copy for the brochure
 
✓ Equipment: The computer you use to compose the copy for the 
brochure
 
✓ Management and administrative salaries: A portion of the salaries of 
upper managers and staff who perform the administrative duties neces-
sary to keep your organization functioning

156
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
Recognizing the three stages 
of a project budget
Organization decision makers would love to have a detailed and accurate 
budget on hand whenever someone proposes a project so they can assess its 
relative benefits to the organization and decide whether they have sufficient 
funds to support it. Unfortunately, you can’t prepare such an estimate until 
you develop a clear understanding of the work and resources the project will 
require.
 
In reality, decisions of whether to go forward with a project and how to under-
take it must be made before people can prepare highly accurate budgets. You 
can develop and refine your project budget in the following stages to provide 
the best information possible to support important project decisions:
 
✓ Rough order-of-magnitude estimate: This stage is an initial estimate of 
costs based on a general sense of the project work. You make this esti-
mate without detailed data. Depending on the nature of the project, the 
final budget may wind up 100 percent (or more!) higher than this initial 
estimate.
 
 Prepare a rough order-of-magnitude estimate by considering the costs 
of similar projects (or similar activities that will be part of your project) 
that have already been done, applicable cost and productivity ratios 
(such as the number of assemblies that can be produced per hour), and 
other methods of approximation.
 
 This estimate sometimes expresses what someone wants to spend 
rather than what the project will really cost. You typically don’t detail 
this estimate by lowest-level project activity because you prepare it in a 
short amount of time before you’ve identified the project activities.
 
 Whether or not people acknowledge it, initial budget estimates in annual 
plans and long-range plans are typically rough order-of-magnitude esti-
mates. As such, these estimates may change significantly as the plan-
ners define the project in greater detail.
 
✓ Detailed budget estimate: This stage entails an itemization of the esti-
mated costs for each project activity. You prepare this estimate by 
developing a detailed WBS (see Chapter 4) and estimating the costs of 
all lowest-level work packages. (Turn to Chapter 6 for information on 
estimating work effort, and see the section “Determining Nonpersonnel 
Resource Needs” earlier in this chapter for ways to estimate your needs 
for nonpersonnel resources.)
 
✓ Completed, approved project budget: This final stage is a detailed proj-
ect budget that essential people approve and agree to support.

157
 Chapter 7: Planning for Other Resources and Developing the Budget
Refining your budget as you move 
through your project’s stages
A project moves through four stages as it evolves from an idea to a reality: 
starting the project, organizing and preparing, carrying out the work, and 
closing the project. (See Chapter 1 for more discussion of these phases.) 
Prepare and refine your budget as your project moves through these differ-
ent stages by following these steps:
 
1. Prepare a rough order-of-magnitude estimate in the starting the proj-
ect stage.
 
 Use this estimate (which I introduce in the preceding section) to decide 
whether the organization should consider your project further by enter-
ing the organizing and preparing stage.
 
 Rather than an actual estimate of costs, this number often represents 
an amount that your project can’t exceed in order to have an accept-
able return for the investment. Your confidence in this estimate is low 
because you don’t base it on detailed analyses of the project activities.
 
2. Develop your detailed budget estimate and get it approved in the orga-
nizing and preparing stage after you specify your project activities.
 
 See the next section for more information on estimating project costs for 
this stage.
 
 Check with your organization to find out who must approve project bud-
gets. At a minimum, the budget is typically approved by the project man-
ager, the head of finance, and possibly the project manager’s supervisor.
 
3. Review your approved budget in the carrying out the work stage — 
when you identify the people who will be working on your project 
and when you start to develop formal agreements for the use of equip-
ment, facilities, vendors, and other resources.
 
 Pay particular attention to the following items that often necessitate 
changes in the budget approved for the project:
 
• People actually assigned to the project team are more or less expe-
rienced than originally anticipated.
 
• Actual prices for goods and services you’ll purchase have 
increased.
 
• Some required project nonpersonnel resources are no longer avail-
able when you need them.
 
• Your clients want additional or different project results than those 
they originally discussed with you.

158
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
 
4. Get approval for any required changes to the budget or other parts of 
the approved plan before you begin the actual project work.
 
 Submit requests for any changes to the original plan or budget to the 
same people who approved them.
 
5. Monitor project activities and related occurrences throughout the car-
rying out the work and closing the project stages to determine when 
budget revisions are necessary.
 
 Check out Chapter 12 for how to monitor project expenditures during 
your project’s performance and how to determine whether budget 
changes are needed. Submit requests for necessary budget revisions as 
soon as possible to the same people you submitted the original budget 
to in Step 2.
 
You may not personally participate in all aspects of developing your project 
budget. If you join your project after the initial planning, be sure to review the 
work that has been done on the budget and resolve any questions you may 
have and issues you may identify.
Determining project costs for 
a detailed budget estimate
After you prepare your rough order-of-magnitude estimate and move into the 
organizing and preparing stage of your project, you’re ready to create your 
detailed budget estimate. Use a combination of the following approaches to 
develop this budget estimate (see the following sections for more on these 
approaches):
 
✓ Bottom-up: Develop detailed cost estimates for each lowest-level work 
package in the WBS (refer to Chapter 4 for more information on the WBS), 
and total these estimates to obtain the total project budget estimate.
 
✓ Top-down: Set a target budget for the entire project and apportion this 
budget among all Level 2 components in the WBS. Then apportion the 
budgets for each of the Level 2 components among its Level 3 compo-
nents. Continue in this manner until a budget has been assigned to each 
lowest-level WBS work package.
The bottom-up approach
Develop your bottom-up budget estimate by doing the following:
 
1. For each lowest-level work package, determine direct labor costs by 
multiplying the number of hours each person will work on it by the 
person’s hourly salary.

159
 Chapter 7: Planning for Other Resources and Developing the Budget
 
 You can estimate direct labor costs by using either of the following two 
definitions for salary:
 
• The actual salary of each person on the project
 
• The average salary for people with a particular job title, in a cer-
tain department, and so on
 
 Suppose you need a graphic artist to design overheads for your pre-
sentation. The head of the graphics department estimates the person 
will spend 100 person-hours on your project. If you know Harry (with a 
salary rate of $30 per hour) will work on the activity, you can estimate 
your direct labor costs to be $3,000. However, if the director doesn’t 
know who’ll work on your project, use the average salary of a graphic 
artist in your organization to estimate the direct labor costs.
 
2. For each lowest-level work package, estimate the direct costs for mate-
rials, equipment, travel, contractual services, and other nonpersonnel 
resources.
 
 See the section “Determining Nonpersonnel Resource Needs” earlier 
in this chapter for information on how to determine the nonpersonnel 
resources you need for your project. Consult with your procurement 
department, administrative staff, and finance department to determine 
the costs of these resources.
 
3. Determine the indirect costs associated with each work package.
 
 You typically estimate indirect costs as a fraction of the planned direct 
labor costs for the work package. In general, your organization’s finance 
department determines this fraction annually by doing the following:
 
• Estimating organization direct labor costs for the coming year
 
• Estimating organization indirect costs for the coming year
 
• Dividing the estimated indirect costs by the estimated direct labor 
costs
 
 You can estimate the total amount of indirect costs either by consider-
ing that they are all in a single category labeled “indirect costs” or that 
they can be in one of the two separate categories labeled “overhead 
costs” and “general and administrative costs” (see the earlier section 
“Looking at different types of project costs” and the nearby sidebar 
“Two approaches for estimating indirect costs” for more information). 
Choose your method of estimating indirect costs by weighing the poten-
tial accuracy of the estimate against the effort to develop it.
 
Suppose you’re planning a project to design and produce a company bro-
chure. You already have the following information (Table 7-1 illustrates this 
information in a typical detailed budget estimate):
 
✓ You estimate that you’ll spend 200 person-hours on the project at $30 
per hour and that Mary will spend 100 person-hours at $25 per hour.

160
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
 
✓ You estimate that the cost of the stationery for the brochures will be $1,000.
 
✓ You estimate $300 in travel costs to visit vendors and suppliers.
 
✓ You expect to pay a vendor $5,000 for the brochure’s artwork.
 
✓ Your organization has a combined indirect cost rate of 60 percent of 
direct labor costs.

The top-down approach
You develop a top-down budget estimate by deciding how much you want 
the total project to cost and then dividing that total cost in the appropri-
ate ratios among the lower-level WBS components until you’ve allocated 
amounts to all the work packages.
 
Suppose you plan to develop a new piece of equipment. You develop a bot-
tom-up cost estimate that suggests the budget for each Level 2 component 
in your WBS should be as follows, with the total budget being determined by 
adding together the amounts to be $100,000:
 
✓ Design: $60,000 (60 percent of the resulting total budget)
 
✓ Development: $15,000 (15 percent of the resulting total budget)
 
✓ Testing: $5,000 (5 percent of the resulting total budget)
 
✓ Production: $20,000 (20 percent of the resulting total budget)
However, experience with similar projects suggests that approximately 40 
percent of the total budget is typically devoted to design, not 60 percent, as 

161
 Chapter 7: Planning for Other Resources and Developing the Budget
you’ve developed using your bottom-up approach. In other words, the rela-
tive allocations of your total budget among the four major project phases 
aren’t in agreement with the amounts recommended from prior experience. 
Your numbers indicate that you’ve planned a design phase for a $150,000 
project rather than a $100,000 project.
To fix this discrepancy, you have two options:
 
✓ Try to scale down your design approach so that it can be implemented 
for $40,000.
 
✓ Request an additional $50,000 for your project.
But whichever approach you choose, you can’t just arbitrarily change the 
numbers without specifying how you will perform the necessary work!
Two approaches for estimating indirect costs
Accurately determining the true cost of a project 
requires that you appropriately allocate all activity 
and resource costs. However, the cost of tracking 
and recording all expenditures can be consider-
able. Therefore, organizations have developed 
methods for approximating the amounts of certain 
expenses assigned to different projects.
Following are two approaches for estimating the 
indirect costs associated with an activity: The first 
approach defines two different indirect rates; it’s 
more accurate but requires more detailed record 
keeping, so it’s also more costly. The second 
defines a single rate for all indirect costs.
Option 1: Use one rate for overhead costs and 
another rate for general and administrative costs.
 ✓ Your finance department determines the 
overhead rate by calculating the ratio of all 
projected overhead costs to all projected 
direct salaries.
 ✓ Your finance department determines the 
general-and-administrative-cost rate by 
calculating the ratio of all projected gen-
eral and administrative costs to the sum 
of all projected direct salaries, overhead 
costs, and other direct costs.
 ✓ You determine overhead costs of an activ-
ity by multiplying its direct salaries by the 
overhead rate.
 ✓ You determine general and administra-
tive costs of an activity by multiplying the 
sum of its direct salaries, overhead costs, 
and other direct costs by the general-and-
administrative-cost rate.
Option 2: Use one indirect-cost rate for all over-
head and general and administrative costs.
 ✓ Your finance department determines the 
combined indirect-cost rate by calculating 
the ratio of all projected overhead costs to 
all projected direct salaries.
 ✓ You determine an activity’s indirect costs 
by multiplying its direct salaries by the indi-
rect-cost rate.
Some organizations develop weighted labor 
rates, which combine hourly salary and associ-
ated indirect costs. As an example, suppose your 
salary is $30 per hour and your organization’s 
indirect-cost rate is 50 percent. Your weighted 
labor rate is $45 per hour ($30 + 0.5 × $30).

Dealing with Risk and Uncertainty
In This Chapter
▶ Coming to terms with risk and risk management
▶ Taking a closer look at risk factors
▶ Evaluating the real costs of risks to your project
▶ Strategizing to stay on top of the risks
▶ Drafting a risk-management plan
Your first step in managing a successful project is to develop a plan to 
produce the desired results on time and within budget. If your project 
lasts a relatively short time and you’re thorough and realistic in your plan-
ning, your project will most likely be a success.
However, the larger, more complex, and longer your project is, the more 
likely you are to encounter some aspects that don’t work out as you envi-
sioned. Thus, you have the greatest chance for success if you confront the 
possibility of such changes head-on and if you plan to minimize their undesir-
able consequences from your project’s outset.
This chapter discusses how to consider potential risks when you’re deciding 
whether you’ll undertake your project, when you’re developing your project 
plan, and while you’re performing your project’s work. It shows you how to 
identify and assess the impact of project risks, and it explores strategies for 
minimizing their consequences. Finally, this chapter gives pointers for pre-
paring your own risk-management plan.
Defining Risk and Risk Management
 
Risk is the possibility that you may not achieve your product, schedule, or 
resource targets because something unexpected occurs or something planned 

164
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
doesn’t occur. All projects have some degree of risk because predicting the 
future with certainty is impossible. However, project risk is greater
 
✓ The longer your project lasts
 
✓ The longer the time is between preparing your project plan and starting 
the work
 
✓ The less experience you, your organization, or your team members have 
with similar projects
 
✓ The newer your project’s technology is
 
A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge, 4th Edition (PMBOK 4), 
asserts that risk can be either negative or positive:
 
✓ Negative risks, also referred to as threats, potentially have a detrimental 
effect on one or more of the project objectives, such as causing you to 
miss a deadline.
 
✓ Positive risks, also referred to as opportunities, potentially have a benefi-
cial effect on project objectives, such as allowing you to complete a task 
with fewer personnel than you originally planned.
In other words, anything that can cause you either to fall short of or to 
exceed your established project targets, if it occurs, is considered a risk. 
While some approaches for analyzing and responding to both types of risks 
are similar, this chapter presents approaches for identifying, evaluating, and 
managing negative risks. In this chapter, the term risk always refers to a nega-
tive risk or threat, unless otherwise noted.
 
Risk management is the process of identifying possible risks, assessing their 
potential consequences, and then developing and implementing plans for 
minimizing any negative effects. Risk management can’t eliminate risks, but it 
offers the best chance for successfully accomplishing your project despite the 
uncertainties of a changing environment.
So how can you address your project’s risks? Take the following steps to 
determine, evaluate, and manage the risks that may affect your project:
 
1. Identify risks.
 
 Determine which aspects of your plan or project environment may 
change.
 
2. Assess the potential effects of those risks on your project.
 
 Consider what can happen if those aspects don’t work out the way you 
envision.

165
 Chapter 8: Venturing into the Unknown: Dealing with Risk and Uncertainty
 
3. Develop plans for mitigating the effects of the risks.
 
 Decide how you can protect your project from the consequences of 
risks.
 
4. Monitor the status of your project’s risks throughout performance.
 
 Determine whether existing risks are still present, whether the likeli-
hood of these risks is increasing or decreasing, and whether new risks 
are arising.
 
5. Inform key audiences of all risks involved with your project.
 
 Explain the status and potential effect of all project risks — from the ini-
tial concept to the project’s completion.
The rest of this chapter describes these steps in more detail.
Focusing on Risk Factors and Risks
The first step toward controlling risks is identifying them. However, not all 
risks pose the same degree of concern to all projects, and using a scatter-gun 
approach to identify risks that may affect your project leaves a significant 
chance that you’ll overlook some important ones.
This section shows you how to identify potential risks on your project by rec-
ognizing the special situations that are most likely to create them.
Don’t put all your eggs in one basket
I once met a man who was starting a large proj-
ect that was a top priority for his organization. 
His project’s success depended heavily on one 
person who would work on the project full time 
for six months and perform all the technical-
development tasks. I asked whether he had 
considered the consequences of this person’s 
leaving the project before it was finished. He 
said he didn’t have to worry about that risk 
because he simply wouldn’t allow the man to 
leave.
It occurred to me that his approach for dealing 
with risk was similar to the one of a woman 
who canceled her health insurance for a 
year — because she wasn’t planning to get 
sick! He may have gotten top management 
to agree that the person would have no other 
assignments for the duration of his project. 
However, he still couldn’t guarantee that the 
person wouldn’t get sick or decide to leave the 
organization.

166
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
Recognizing risk factors
 
A risk factor is a situation that may give rise to one or more project risks. A 
risk factor itself doesn’t cause you to miss a product, schedule, or resource 
target. However, it increases the chances that something may happen that will 
cause you to miss one.
For example: The fact that you and your organization haven’t undertaken 
projects similar to the present one is a risk factor. Because you have no prior 
experience, you may overlook activities you need to perform, or you may 
underestimate the time and resources you need to perform them. Having no 
prior experience doesn’t guarantee you’ll have these problems, but it does 
increase the chance that you may.
 
Start to manage risks at the outset of your project, and continue to do so 
throughout its performance. At each point during your project, identify risks 
by recognizing your project’s risk factors. Use your project phases as well as 
your overall project plan to help you identify risk factors.
All projects progress through the following four life cycle stages, and each 
stage can present new risk factors for your project (see Chapter 1 for a 
detailed discussion of these stages):
 
✓ Starting the project
 
✓ Organizing and preparing
 
✓ Carrying out the work
 
✓ Closing the project
Table 8-1 illustrates possible risk factors that may arise in each of these 
stages.

Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
Identifying risks
After you recognize your project’s risk factors, the next step in your risk 
assessment is to identify the specific risks that may result from each of your 
risk factors. With this information in hand, you can determine the particu-
lar effects each risk may have on your project and decide how you want to 
manage that risk.
Describe how each risk factor may cause you to miss your product, schedule, 
or resource targets. Suppose, for example, that you plan to use a new tech-
nology in your project. Using a new technology is a risk factor (as you see 
in Table 8-2). Possible product, schedule, and resource risks that may arise 
from this risk factor include the following:
 
✓ Product risk: The technology may not produce the desired results.
 
✓ Schedule risk: Tasks using the new technology may take longer than 
you anticipate.
 
✓ Resource risk: Existing facilities and equipment may not be adequate to 
support the use of the new technology.
 
To identify specific potential risks for each risk factor, do the following:
 
✓ Review past records of problems encountered in similar situations. If 
a risk factor actually resulted in an unexpected occurrence in the past, 
you definitely want to be prepared for it this time.
 
✓ Brainstorm with experts and other people who have related experi-
ences. The more sources of expert opinion you consult, the less chance 
you have of overlooking something important.
 
✓ Be specific. The more specifically you describe a risk, the better you can 
assess its potential effect. Here’s an example of a nonspecific risk com-
pared to a specific one:
 
• Nonspecific: Activities may be delayed.
 
• Specific: Delivery may take three weeks rather than two.
 
Try to eliminate potential risk factors as soon as possible. For example, sup-
pose a key audience hasn’t approved your project’s objectives. Instead of just 
noting the risk that you may not correctly address this audience’s needs, try 
to get the audience’s approval!

171
 Chapter 8: Venturing into the Unknown: Dealing with Risk and Uncertainty
Assessing Risks: Probability 
and Consequences
The expected consequences of a risk depend on the effect of the risk if it 
becomes a reality and the probability that the risk will become a reality. 
Consider the expected consequences of different risks to choose which risks 
you want to actively manage and which risks you’ll leave alone. This section 
discusses how to determine the probability that a particular risk will occur 
on your project and how to estimate the extent of that risk’s consequences.
Gauging the likelihood of a risk
A meteorologist’s forecast that it may snow isn’t sufficient reason to go out 
and buy a $1,000 snow thrower. First, you want to know the chances that it’ll 
snow, and second, you want to know how much snow is likely to fall. If the 
meteorologist is sure that, if it snows, the total accumulation will be at least 
20 inches but the chances of it snowing at all are only one in 1,000, you may 
decide it’s not worth it to spend $1,000 to be prepared for a situation that is 
so unlikely to occur.
 
The first step in deciding whether to deal proactively with a risk is assessing 
the likelihood that it will occur. Use one of the following schemes to describe 
the chances that a risk will occur:
 
✓ Probability of occurrence: You can express the likelihood that a risk 
will occur as probability. Probability is a number between 0 and 1, with 
0.0 signifying that a situation will never happen, and 1.0 signifying that 
it will always occur. (You may also express probability as a percentage, 
with 100 percent meaning the situation will always occur.)
 
✓ Category ranking: Classify risks into categories that represent their like-
lihood. You may use high, medium, and low, or always, often, sometimes, 
rarely, and never.
 
✓ Ordinal ranking: Order the risks so the first is the most likely to occur, 
the second is the next most likely, and so on.
 
✓ Relative likelihood of occurrence: If you have two possible risks, you 
can express how much more likely one is to occur than the other. For 
example, you can declare that the first risk is twice as likely to occur as 
the second.

172
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
If you have objective data on the number of times a risk has occurred in 
similar situations in the past, use the first scheme in the preceding list to 
determine the likelihood that the risk will occur again in the future. If you 
don’t have objective data available, use one of the other three schemes that 
are based on personal opinion to describe the likelihood particular risks will 
occur.
The following sections explain how to describe the likelihood a risk occurring 
using each of the preceding approaches.
Relying on objective info
You can estimate the probability of a risk occurring by considering the 
number of times the risk actually occurred on similar projects. Suppose, for 
example, that you designed 20 computer-generated reports over the past 
year for new clients. Eight times, when you submitted your design for final 
approval, new clients wanted at least one change. If you’re planning to design 
a computer-generated report for another new client, you may conclude the 
chances are 40 percent that you’ll have to make a change in the design you 
submit (8 divided by 20, then multiplied by 100).
 
When using objective information, such as past project reports, to determine 
the likelihood of different risks,
 
✓ Consider previous experience with similar projects.
 
✓ Consider as many similar situations as possible.
 
✓ Keep in mind that the more similar situations you consider, the more 
confidence you can have in your conclusions.
Counting on personal opinions
In the absence of objective data, solicit the opinions of experts and people 
who have worked on similar projects in the past. You can estimate the likeli-
hood of a particular risk by soliciting the opinions of ten people who have 
worked on projects similar to yours. For example, ask them to rate the likeli-
hood of a specific risk as high, medium, or low. Suppose six people choose 
high, two choose medium, and two choose low. You may then develop 
your estimate of the likelihood by assigning values of 3, 2, and 1, to high, 
medium, and low, respectively, and determining the weighted average of the 
responses as follows:
(6 × 3) + (2 × 2) + (2 × 1) = (18 + 4 + 2) ÷ 10 = 2.4
This formula suggests the risk has medium to high likelihood of occurring 
(because 2.4 is between 2 and 3).

173
 Chapter 8: Venturing into the Unknown: Dealing with Risk and Uncertainty
 
To increase the accuracy of the likelihood estimates you make based on per-
sonal opinions, try the following:
 
✓ Define the category name as clearly as possible. You may suggest 
that low means the likelihood of the risk is between 0 and 33 percent, 
medium means 33 to 66 percent, and high means 66 to 100 percent.
 
✓ Consider the opinions of as many people as possible. The more data 
points you have, the more confident you can be in the estimate.
 
✓ Be sure the projects your respondents have worked on are truly simi-
lar to yours. Otherwise, you have no reason to assume you can use their 
experience to predict what’ll happen on your project.
 
✓ Don’t allow people to discuss their estimates with each other before 
they share them with you. You’re looking for individual opinions, not a 
group consensus.
 
✓ After they’ve submitted their initial estimates to you, consider having 
the people discuss their reasons for their estimates with one another 
and then asking them whether they want to revise their estimates. 
Some people may choose to modify their original estimates if they real-
ize they failed to take into account certain important considerations.
 
Precision is different from accuracy. Precision refers to the detail of a number. 
Accuracy refers to how correct the number is. You may estimate the likelihood 
of a particular risk to be 67.23 percent. However, even though you express 
the risk precisely to two decimal places, your guess has little chance of being 
accurate if you have no prior experience with similar projects. Unfortunately, 
people often assume that more precise numbers are also more accurate. You 
can help avoid misinterpretations when you share your assessments of likeli-
hood by using round numbers, categories, or relative rankings.
 
The more risk factors that suggest a particular risk may occur, the higher 
the likelihood that the risk will occur. For example, ordering from a vendor 
you haven’t worked with before increases the chances that it’ll take longer to 
receive your order than promised. However, the likelihood of a longer-than-
promised wait for delivery is even greater if the item is also a special order, if 
you want delivery during a busy period for the vendor, and if the vendor has 
to order several parts from different manufacturers to make the item.
Estimating the extent of the consequences
Not long ago, I was waiting to see my doctor when the nurse came out and 
told me the doctor had to attend to an emergency and would be slightly 
delayed. Imagine my shock when, after waiting for three hours for the doctor, 

174
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
I learned that, several hours earlier, he had gone to a hospital that was an 
hour away and was currently in the middle of an emergency operation! If I’d 
known the doctor was going to be gone for several hours, I would’ve resched-
uled my appointment. Instead, because I didn’t know how long the delay 
would be, I wasted three hours. And, unless I wanted to wait the rest of the 
afternoon, I’d have to make a new appointment anyway.
In this simple example, going for my annual checkup is my project, and 
beginning my checkup at the scheduled time is one of my project’s targets. 
The doctor being called away on an emergency shortly before my scheduled 
appointment is a risk factor — it increases the chances that my checkup 
won’t start at the scheduled time. My estimate of the magnitude of the con-
sequences (how long I expect the start of my appointment to be delayed) 
affects what I choose to do (wait for the doctor to return or reschedule my 
appointment for another time).
After you identify the likelihood that a particular risk will affect your project, 
be sure to determine the magnitude of the consequences or effects that may 
result. That magnitude directly influences how you choose to deal with the 
risk. Determine the specific effect that each risk may have on your project’s 
product, schedule, and resource performance. When evaluating these effects, 
do the following:
 
✓ Consider the effect of a risk on the total project rather than on just 
part of it. Taking one week longer than you planned to complete an 
activity may cause you to miss intermediate milestones (and cause the 
personnel waiting for the results of that activity to sit idle). However, 
the effect on the project is even greater if the delayed activity is on your 
project’s critical path (see Chapter 5), which means the weeklong delay 
on that one activity also causes a weeklong delay for your entire project.
 
✓ Consider the combined effect of related risks. The likelihood that your 
schedule will slip is greater if three activities on the same critical path 
have a significant risk of delay rather than just one.
 
Be sure to describe risks and their associated consequences as specifically as 
possible. For example, suppose a key piece of equipment you ordered for your 
project may arrive later than expected. You can describe that risk as the deliv-
ery may be late, or as the delivery may be delayed by two weeks. Just stating 
that the delivery may be late doesn’t give you enough information to assess 
the likely effect of that delay on the overall project. It also makes estimating 
the probability of that risk’s occurrence more difficult. Are you talking about a 
delay of one day? One month? Stating that the delivery may be delayed by two 
weeks allows you to determine more precisely the likely effect the delay will 
have on the overall schedule and resources. It also allows you to decide how 
much you’re willing to spend to avoid that delay.

 Chapter 8: Venturing into the Unknown: Dealing with Risk and Uncertainty
 
You can use a variety of formal techniques to support your risk estimation 
and assessment, including the following:
 
✓ Decision trees: These diagrams illustrate different situations that may 
occur as your project unfolds, the likelihood of each situation’s occur-
rence, and the consequences of that occurrence to your project.
 
 Figure 8-1 illustrates a simple decision tree to help determine from 
which of two vendors to buy a piece of equipment. Both vendors have 
proposed a price of $50,000 if the equipment is delivered on the agreed-
on date. Both vendors have also proposed they receive an incentive 
for delivering early and absorb a penalty for delivering late, but the 
amounts of the incentives and penalties differ. The decision tree depicts 
the probabilities that each vendor will deliver the equipment early, on 
time, and late, respectively, and the resulting price you pay in each case.
 
 Multiplying the base price plus the performance incentive for early 
delivery by the probability of early delivery yields the expected value 
of the price you pay if delivery is early. You can calculate the total 
expected prices for Vendors A and B by totaling the expected prices if 
each is early, on time, and late, respectively.
 
 This analysis suggests that you can expect to pay Vendor A $45,000 and 
have a 70 percent chance he’ll deliver on time or early. You can expect 
to pay Vendor B $56,000 and have a 70 percent chance he’ll deliver on 
time or early. So you can see that Vendor A is the better choice!

✓ Risk-assessment questionnaires: These formal data-collection instru-
ments elicit expert opinion about the likelihood of different situations 
occurring and their associated effects.
 
✓ Automated impact assessments: These computerized spreadsheets 
consider — in combination — the likelihood that different situations will 
occur and the consequences if they do.
Getting Everything under 
Control: Managing Risk
Recognizing risks that pose a threat to your project is the first step toward 
controlling them. But you can’t stop there. You also have to develop specific 
plans for reducing their potential negative effects on your project. This sec-
tion helps you select the risks you’ll proactively manage, develop a plan for 
addressing them, and share your plan with your project’s audiences.
Choosing the risks you want to manage
All identified risks affect your project in some way if they occur (after all, 
that’s the definition of a risk). However, you may determine that anticipating 
and minimizing the negative consequences of some risks if they occur takes 
more time and effort than just dealing with the situations when they arise.
So your first step in developing a risk-management strategy is choosing the 
risks that you want to address proactively and which ones you’ll just accept. 
When making this decision, do the following:
 
✓ Consider the likelihood of a risk and its potential effect on your project. 
If the potential effect of a risk is great and if the chances it will occur are 
high, you probably want to develop plans to manage that risk. If both the 
effect and the likelihood are low, you may decide not to worry about it.
 
 When the potential effect is high but the likelihood is low or vice versa, 
you must consider the situation more carefully. In these more complex 
situations, you can use a more formal approach for considering the com-
bined effect of likelihood of occurrence and potential consequence by 
defining the expected value of risk, as follows:
 
 Expected value of risk = (quantitative measure of the effect if it 
occurs) × (probability it will occur)

177
 Chapter 8: Venturing into the Unknown: Dealing with Risk and Uncertainty
 
 Suppose you need to buy certain materials for a device you’re planning 
to build. When you place your order, you think you have an 80 percent 
chance of receiving the materials by the date promised. However, this 
means you have a 20 percent chance that something will go wrong and 
that you’ll have to pay a premium to get the materials from another 
vendor by the date you need them. You estimate that the materials nor-
mally cost $1,000 and that you’ll have to pay an additional $500 to get 
them from another vendor at the last minute. Determine the expected 
value of this risk as follows:
 
 Expected value of risk = Additional cost incurred if you use another 
vendor at the last minute × probability that you’ll have to use this 
vendor
 
 Expected value of risk = $500 × 0.2 = $100
 
 You may conclude that, all things being equal, spending more than $100 
to reduce the chances of this risk isn’t a wise financial decision.
 
✓ Decide whether a potential consequence is so unacceptable that 
you’re not willing to take the chance even if it’s very unlikely to 
occur.
 
 Suppose your company wants to build a new plant in an area that has been 
hit hard by hurricanes. The estimated cost of the new plant is $50 million, 
and the likelihood that a hurricane will totally destroy the building is 0.1 
percent. The expected value of this risk is $50,000 ($50,000,000 × 0.001), 
which the company can easily absorb. However, if a hurricane actually 
destroys the building, the associated $50 million loss would put the com-
pany out of business. So, even though the expected value of the loss is rela-
tively small, the company may feel that even a 0.1 percent chance of its new 
building being destroyed by a hurricane is unacceptable.
 
 If you choose to build the plant, be sure you develop a strategy to 
manage the risk of the plant being totally destroyed (see the next sec-
tion). You may want to reconsider whether you want to undertake the 
project at all.
Developing a risk-management strategy
 
Choose one or more of the following approaches for dealing with the risks you 
decide to manage:
 
✓ Avoidance: Act to eliminate the risk factor that gave rise to the risk. An 
example is deciding not to use a new, untested procedure that you’re 
concerned may not produce the desired project results.

178
Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
 
✓ Transfer: Pay someone else to assume some or all of the effect of the 
risk. Suppose you choose to proceed with your plans to build a new 
$50 million facility (see the example in the preceding section). You can 
buy disaster insurance on the facility so the company doesn’t have to 
assume the full burden of a total loss if a hurricane destroys the facility.
 
✓ Mitigation: Either reduce the likelihood that a risk occurs, or minimize 
the negative consequences if it does occur. The following are examples 
of risk mitigation:
 
• Minimize the chances that the risk will occur. Take actions to 
reduce the chances that an undesirable situation will come to 
pass. For example, consider that you have a person on your proj-
ect who’s new to your organization. Consequently, you feel the 
person may take longer to do her assigned task than you planned. 
To reduce the chances that the person will require more time, 
explain the task and the desired results very clearly to the person 
before she begins to work on it, develop frequent milestones and 
monitor the person’s performance often so that you can deal with 
any problems as soon as they occur, and have her attend train-
ing to refresh the skills and knowledge she needs to perform the 
assignment.
 
• Develop contingencies to minimize the negative consequences 
if an undesirable situation does come to pass. Suppose you plan 
to have your organization’s publication department reproduce 
100 copies of the manual for your training program. If you’re con-
cerned that the department may have higher-priority projects at 
the same time, locate an external vendor that can reproduce the 
manuals if the need arises. Finding the vendor beforehand can 
reduce any time delay resulting from the need to switch to another 
resource.
Keep in mind that if these approaches are to work, you must choose your 
strategies and plan their implementation as early as possible in your project.
 
Although the following approaches may sometimes seem appealing as you 
consider all the risks involved in a particular project, they don’t work, so don’t 
use them:
 
✓ The ostrich approach: Ignoring all risks, or pretending they don’t exist
 
✓ The prayer approach: Looking to a higher being to solve all your prob-
lems or to making them disappear
 
✓ The denial approach: Recognizing that certain situations may cause 
problems for your project but refusing to accept that these situations 
may occur
 
Though it may require a bit of work upfront, proactively managing your proj-
ect’s risks always pays dividends down the line.

179
 Chapter 8: Venturing into the Unknown: Dealing with Risk and Uncertainty
Communicating about risks
People often share information about project risks ineffectually or not at all. 
As a result, their projects suffer unnecessary problems and setbacks that 
proper communication may have avoided.
You may be reluctant to deal with risk because the concept is hard to grasp. 
If your project’s a one-time deal, what difference does it make that, in the 
past, a particular risk has occurred 40 times out of 100? You may also feel 
that focusing on risks suggests you’re looking for excuses for failure rather 
than ways to succeed.
 
Communicate about project risks early and often. In particular, share informa-
tion with drivers and supporters at the following points in your project (see 
Chapter 1 for more about these project life cycle stages):
 
✓ Starting the project: To support the process of deciding whether or not 
to undertake the project
 
✓ Organizing and preparing: To guide the development of all aspects of 
your project plan
 
✓ Carrying out the work:
 
• To allow team members to discuss potential risks and to encour-
age them to recognize and address problems as soon as those 
problems occur
 
• To update the likelihood that identified risks will occur, to rein-
force how people can minimize the negative effects of project 
risks, and to guide the assessment of requests to change parts of 
the current approved project plan
 
You can improve your risk-related communications with your project’s driv-
ers and supporters by
 
✓ Explaining in detail the nature of a risk, how it may affect your project, 
and how you estimated the likelihood of its occurrence
 
✓ Telling people the current chances that certain risks will occur, how 
you’re minimizing the chances of problems, and how they can reduce 
the chances of negative consequences
 
✓ Encouraging people to think and talk about risks, always with an eye 
toward minimizing the negative effects of those risks
 
✓ Documenting in writing all the information about the risks
You can discuss this information at regularly scheduled team meetings, in 
regularly scheduled progress reports and upper-management reviews, and 
in special meetings to address issues that arise. (See Chapter 13 for more on 
sharing project information.)

Part II: Planning Time: Determining When and How Much 
Preparing a Risk-Management Plan
A risk-management plan lays out strategies to minimize the negative effects 
that uncertain occurrences can have on your project. Develop your risk-
management plan in the organizing and preparing stage of your project, refine 
it at the beginning of the carrying out the work stage, and continually update 
it during the remainder of the carrying out the work stage (see Chapter 1 for 
more on these stages). Include the following in your risk-management plan:
 
✓ Risk factors
 
✓ Associated risks
 
✓ Your assessment of the likelihood of occurrence and the consequences 
for each risk
 
✓ Your plan for managing selected risks
 
✓ Your plan for keeping people informed about those risks throughout 
your project

I
n the traditional work environment, you have one direct supervisor who 
assigns your work, completes your performance appraisals, approves 
your salary increases, and authorizes your promotions. However, increasing 
numbers of organizations are moving toward a structure in which a variety of 
people direct your work assignments. What’s the greatest advantage of this 
new structure? When all is said and done, it supports faster and more-
effective responses to the diverse projects in an organization.
Success in this new project-oriented organization requires you to do the 
following:
 
✓ Recognize the people who define and influence your work environment.
 
✓ Understand their unique roles.
 
✓ Know how to work effectively with them to create a successful project.
This chapter helps you define your organization’s environment and under-
stand individual roles. It also provides tips to help you successfully accom-
plish your project in a matrix-structured organization.
Defining Three Organizational Environments
Over the years, projects have evolved from organizational afterthoughts 
to major vehicles for conducting business and developing future capabili-
ties. Naturally, the approaches for organizing and managing projects have 
evolved, as well.

186
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
This section explains how projects are handled in the traditional functional 
structure, the project-focused projectized structure, and the extensively used 
matrix structure, which combines aspects of both the functional and projec-
tized structures.
The functional structure
 
The functional organization structure (see Figure 9-1 for an example) brings 
together people who perform similar tasks or who use the same kinds of skills 
and knowledge in functional groups. In this structure, people are managed 
through clear lines of authority that extend through each group to the head 
of the group and, ultimately, to a single person at the top. For example, in 
Figure 9-1, you see that all people who perform human resources functions for 
the organization (such as recruiting, training, and benefits management) are 
located in the human resources group, which reports to the chief executive.
 
Figure 9-1:

ing projects.

Depending on the nature of the project and the skills and knowledge required 
for it, a project in the functional structure may be handled completely by 
staff within a particular functional group. However, as illustrated in Figure 9-1, 
if the manufacturing group is performing a project that requires the expertise 
of a person from the human resources group, the vice president of manu-
facturing must make a formal agreement with the vice president of human 
resources to make the necessary human resources staffer available to work 
on the project. The vice president of human resources must then manage 
this person as he performs his tasks for the project.

187
 Chapter 9: Aligning the Key Players for Your Project
The project manager has less authority over project team members in the 
functional structure than in any other form of project organization. In fact, 
he serves more as a project coordinator than a project manager because the 
functional managers maintain all authority over the project team members 
and the project budget.
Advantages of the functional structure
The functional structure has the following advantages:
 
✓ Functional groups are reservoirs of skills and knowledge in their 
areas of expertise. Group members are hired for their technical cre-
dentials and continue to develop their capabilities through their work 
assignments.
 
✓ Functional groups’ well-established communication processes and 
decision-making procedures provide timely and consistent support 
for the group’s projects. From the beginning of their assignments, group 
members effectively work with and support one another because they 
know with whom, how, and when to share important task information. 
Decisions are made promptly because areas of authority are clearly 
defined.
 
✓ Functional groups provide people with a focused and supportive job 
environment. Group members work alongside colleagues who share 
similar professional interests. Each member has a well-defined career 
path and one boss who gives his assignments and reviews his perfor-
mance. The established interpersonal relationships among the group’s 
members facilitate effective collaborative work efforts.
Disadvantages of the functional structure
 
The functional structure has the following drawbacks:
 
✓ The functional structure hampers effective collaboration between 
different functional groups. Group members’ working relationships 
are mainly with others in their group, and management assesses their 
performance on how well they perform in the group’s area of specializa-
tion. This makes effective collaboration with other groups on a project 
difficult.
 
✓ The functional group members’ main interest is to perform the tasks 
in their group’s specialty area effectively, rather than to achieve goals 
and results that may involve and affect other groups in the organiza-
tion. Group members’ professional interests and working relationships 
are mostly with others in their group, and their boss, who gives them 
their work assignments and evaluates their performance, is the head 
of the functional group. This environment encourages members to be 
most concerned with and to give the highest priority to their functional 
group’s task assignments.

188
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
 
✓ A functional group may have difficulty getting buy in and support 
for its project from other functional groups that must support or will 
be affected by the project. Each functional group can initiate a project 
without consulting other functional groups. As a result, people in these 
other areas may be reluctant to support such a project when it doesn’t 
address their needs in the most effective way. They may also be reluc-
tant to support it because the project may be competing with projects 
from their own functional group for scarce resources.
The projectized structure
 
The projectized organization structure groups together all personnel working 
on a particular project. Project team members are often located together and 
under the direct authority of the project manager for the duration of the proj-
ect. As an example, you see in Figure 9-2 that a design engineer, an IT special-
ist, and a test engineer all work on Project A, while a different design engineer 
and a different test engineer work on Project B.
The project manager has almost total authority over the members of her 
team in the projectized structure. She makes assignments and directs team 
members’ task efforts; she controls the project budget; she conducts team 
members’ performance assessments and approves team members’ raises and 
bonuses; and she approves annual leave.

Advantages of the projectized structure
The projectized structure has the following advantages:
 
✓ All members of a project team report directly to the project manager. 
This clarified and simplified reporting structure reduces the potential 

189
 Chapter 9: Aligning the Key Players for Your Project
for conflicting demands on team members’ time and results in fewer and 
shorter lines of communication. In addition, it facilitates faster project 
decision making.
 
✓ Project team members can more easily develop a shared sense of 
identity, resulting in a stronger commitment to one another and to 
the success of the project. Consistent focus on a single project with the 
same group of team members gives people a greater appreciation of one 
another’s strengths and limitations, as well as a deeper understanding of 
and a stronger belief in the value of the intended project results.
 
✓ Everyone on the team shares the processes for performing project 
work, communication, conflict resolution, and decision making. The 
projectized structure enhances project productivity and efficiency 
because more time can be devoted to doing work rather than creating 
systems to support doing the work.
Disadvantages of the projectized structure
 
The projectized structure has the following disadvantages:
 
✓ Higher personnel costs: Even when several projects have similar 
personnel needs, different people with the same skill set have to be 
assigned to each one. As a result, chances are greater that projects 
won’t be able to fully support people with specialized skills and knowl-
edge, which can lead to either keeping people on projects longer than 
they’re actually needed or having to cover people’s salaries when their 
project doesn’t have enough work to support them full time.
 
✓ Reduced technical interchange between projects: Providing all the 
skills and knowledge required to perform a project by assigning people 
full time to the project team reduces the need and the opportunity for 
sharing work experiences with people on other teams.
 
✓ Reduced career continuity, opportunities, and sense of job security: 
Because people are hired to work on one specific project team, they 
have no guarantee that the organization will need their services when 
their current project comes to an end.
The matrix structure
With increasing frequency, projects today involve and affect many functional 
areas within an organization. As a result, personnel from these different 
areas must work together to successfully accomplish the project work. The 
matrix organization structure combines elements of both the functional and 
projectized structures to facilitate the responsive and effective participation 
of people from different parts of the organization on projects that need their 
specialized expertise.

190
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
 
As Figure 9-3 illustrates, in a matrix organization structure, people from differ-
ent areas of the organization are assigned to lead or work on projects. Project 
managers guide the performance of project activities while people’s direct 
supervisors (from groups such as finance, manufacturing, and sales, as in 
Figure 9-3) perform administrative tasks like formally appraising people’s per-
formance and approving promotions, salary increases, or requests for leave. 
Because an individual can be on a project for less than 100 percent of his time, 
he may work on more than one project at a time. (I discuss the key players in 
a matrix structure in more detail later in the “Recognizing the Key Players in a 
Matrix Environment” section.)

Functional
A matrix environment is classified as weak, strong, or balanced, depending on 
the amount of authority the project managers have over their teams. Here’s a 
little more info about each of these classifications:
 
✓ Weak matrix: Project team members receive most of their direction 
from their functional managers. Project managers have little, if any, 
direct authority over team members and actually function more like 
project coordinators than managers.
 
✓ Strong matrix: Companies with strong matrix structures choose project 
managers for new projects from a pool of people whose only job is to 
manage projects. The companies never ask these people to serve as 
team members. Often these project managers form a single organiza-
tional unit that reports to a manager of project managers. In addition to 
directing and guiding project work, these project managers have certain 
administrative authority over the team members, such as the right to 
participate in their performance appraisals.

191
 Chapter 9: Aligning the Key Players for Your Project
 
✓ Balanced matrix: This type of matrix environment is a blend of the weak 
and strong environments. People are assigned to lead projects or serve 
as team members based on the projects’ needs rather than on their job 
descriptions. Although the project manager may have some administra-
tive authority over team members (such as approving leave requests), 
for the most part, the project manager guides, coordinates, and facili-
tates the project.
Check out the later section “Working Successfully in a Matrix Environment” 
for more information on the matrix structure.
Advantages of the matrix structure
A matrix environment offers many benefits, including the following:
 
✓ Teams can assemble rapidly. Because you have a larger resource pool 
from which to choose your project team, you don’t have to wait for a 
few people to finish current assignments before they can start on your 
project. Additionally, this approach reduces the time-consuming pro-
cess of hiring someone new from the outside.
 
✓ Specialized expertise can be available for several different projects. 
Projects often require a small amount of effort from a person with highly 
specialized knowledge or skills. If your project alone can’t provide 
sufficient funds to hire this person full time, perhaps several projects 
together, each using a portion of the expert’s time, can.
 
✓ Getting buy in from team members’ functional units is easier with the 
matrix structure than with the functional or projectized structures. 
Unit members who work on a project or who are affected by its outcome 
are more likely to support the project if they’re confident that the team 
hears their concerns and issues.
Disadvantages of the matrix structure
 
A matrix environment introduces the following challenges, which the project 
manager must successfully address:
 
✓ Team members working on multiple projects respond to two or more 
managers. Each team member has at least two people giving her direc-
tion — a project manager (who coordinates project work and team 
support) and a functional manager (who coordinates the team mem-
ber’s project assignments, completes her performance appraisal, and 
approves requests for leave). When these two managers are at similar 
levels in the organization, resolving conflicting demands for the team 
member’s time can be difficult.

Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
 
✓ Team members may not be familiar with one another’s styles and 
knowledge. Because team members may not have worked extensively 
together, they may require some time to become comfortable with one 
another’s work styles and behaviors.
 
✓ Team members may focus more on their individual assignments and 
less on the project and its goals. For example, a procurement specialist 
may be responsible for buying equipment and supplies for all her proj-
ects. In such a case, the specialist may be less concerned about a proj-
ect’s target date for the purchases and more concerned about correctly 
following her department’s procurement procedures.
Recognizing the Key Players 
in a Matrix Environment
The matrix structure that I introduce earlier in this chapter makes it easier 
for people from diverse parts of the organization to contribute their expertise 
to different projects. However, working in a matrix environment requires that 
the project manager deal with the styles, interests, and demands of more 
people who have some degree of control over his project’s resources, goals, 
and objectives than in a functional or projectized structure.
In a matrix environment, the following people play critical roles in every proj-
ect’s success:
 
✓ Project manager: The person ultimately responsible for the successful 
completion of the project
 
✓ Project team members: People responsible for successfully performing 
individual project activities
 
✓ Functional managers: The team members’ direct-line supervisors
 
✓ Upper management: People in charge of the organization’s major busi-
ness units
The following sections discuss how each of these people can help your proj-
ect succeed.
The project manager
If you’re the project manager, you’re responsible for all aspects of the proj-
ect. Being responsible doesn’t mean you have to do the whole project your-
self, but you do have to see that every activity is completed satisfactorily. 

193
 Chapter 9: Aligning the Key Players for Your Project
(See Chapter 10 for definitions of authority, responsibility, and accountabil-
ity.) In this role, you’re specifically responsible for the following:
 
✓ Determining objectives (see Chapter 2), schedules (see Chapter 5), and 
resource budgets (see Chapters 6 and 7)
 
✓ Ensuring you have a clear, feasible project plan to reach your perfor-
mance targets (see Chapter 4)
 
✓ Identifying and managing project risks (see Chapter 8)
 
✓ Creating and sustaining a well-organized, focused, and committed team 
(see Part III)
 
✓ Selecting or creating your team’s operating practices and procedures 
(see Chapter 11)
 
✓ Monitoring performance against plans and dealing with any problems 
that arise (see Chapter 12)
 
✓ Resolving priority, work approach, or interpersonal conflicts (see 
Chapter 14)
 
✓ Identifying and facilitating the resolution of project issues and problems 
(see Chapter 12)
 
✓ Controlling project changes (see Chapter 12)
 
✓ Reporting on project activities (see Chapter 13)
 
✓ Keeping your clients informed and committed (see Chapter 13)
 
✓ Accomplishing objectives within time and budget targets (see Part IV)
 
✓ Contributing to your team members’ performance appraisals (see 
Chapter 15)
 
On occasion, you may hear people use the terms project director and proj-
ect leader, both of which sound similar to project manager. Check with your 
organization, but usually manager and director describe the same position. 
Project leader, however, is a different story. People often think of manage-
ment as focusing on issues and leadership as focusing on people; management 
also deals with established procedures, while leadership deals with change. 
Therefore, calling someone a project leader emphasizes her responsibility to 
focus and energize the people supporting the project, as opposed to the more 
technical tasks of planning and controlling. But again, check with your orga-
nization to be sure the term leader is meant to convey this message. (Often 
project leader is just another term for project manager — go figure!)

194
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
Project team members
Project team members must satisfy the requests of both their functional man-
agers and their project managers. As a team member, your responsibilities 
related to project assignments include the following:
 
✓ Performing tasks in accordance with the highest standards of technical 
excellence in your field
 
✓ Performing assignments on time and within budget
 
✓ Maintaining the special skills and knowledge required to do the work 
well
In addition, you’re responsible for working with and supporting your team 
members’ project efforts. Such help may entail the following:
 
✓ Considering the effect your actions may have on your team members’ 
tasks
 
✓ Identifying situations and problems that may affect team members’ tasks
 
✓ Keeping your team members informed of your progress, accomplish-
ments, and any problems you encounter
Functional managers
Functional managers are responsible for orchestrating their staff’s assign-
ments among different projects. In addition, they provide the necessary 
resources for their staff to perform their work in accordance with the high-
est standards of technical excellence. Specifically, functional managers are 
responsible for the following:
 
✓ Developing or approving plans that specify the type, timing, and amount 
of resources required to perform tasks in their area of specialty
 
✓ Ensuring team members are available to perform their assigned tasks for 
the promised amount of time
 
✓ Providing technical expertise and guidance to help team members solve 
problems related to their project assignments
 
✓ Providing the equipment and facilities needed for a person to do his 
work
 
✓ Helping people maintain their technical skills and knowledge
 
✓ Ensuring members of the functional group use consistent methodologi-
cal approaches on all their projects
 
✓ Completing team members’ performance appraisals

195
 Chapter 9: Aligning the Key Players for Your Project
 
✓ Recognizing performance with salary increases, promotions, and job 
assignments
 
✓ Approving team members’ requests for annual leave, administrative 
leave, training, and other activities that take time away from the job
Upper management
Upper management creates the organizational environment; oversees the 
development and use of operating policies, procedures, and practices; and 
encourages and funds the development of required information systems. 
More specifically, upper management is responsible for the following:
 
✓ Creating the organizational mission and goals that provide the frame-
work for selecting projects
 
✓ Setting policies and procedures for addressing priorities and conflicts
 
✓ Creating and maintaining labor and financial information systems
 
✓ Providing facilities and equipment to support project work
 
✓ Defining the limits of managers’ decision-making authority
 
✓ Helping to resolve project issues and decisions that can’t be handled 
successfully at lower levels in the organization
Working Successfully in a 
Matrix Environment
Achieving success in a matrix environment requires that you effectively align 
and coordinate the people who support your project, deflecting any forces 
that pull those people in different directions. This section can help you, as a 
project manager, get the highest-quality work from your team members in a 
matrix environment, along with timely and effective support from the func-
tional and senior managers.
Creating and continually reinforcing 
a team identity
 
Committing to work with others to achieve a common goal encourages people 
to overcome problems they may encounter along the way. The following tips 
can help clarify your team’s purpose and encourage team members to support 

196
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
one another as you work together to achieve it (see Chapter 11 for additional 
guidelines):
 
✓ Clarify team vision and working relationships. As soon as you have a 
team, work with the team members to develop a project mission that 
members can understand and support. Give people an opportunity to 
become familiar with each other’s work styles.
 
✓ Define team procedures. Encourage your team to develop its own work 
procedures instead of allowing people to use the approaches of their 
respective functional groups.
 
✓ Clarify each person’s authority. Team members may have to repre-
sent their functional areas when making project decisions. Clarify each 
team member’s level of independent authority to make such decisions, 
and determine who outside the team can make any decisions that are 
beyond the purview of the team member.
 
✓ Be aware of and attend to your team’s functioning. Help people estab-
lish comfortable and productive interpersonal relationships. Continue to 
support these relationships throughout your project.
 
✓ Be sure one person is assigned the role of project manager — with 
overall coordinative responsibilities. The project manager continually 
reminds team members of the overarching project goals and focuses 
their attention on how they influence and affect each other’s work.
Getting team member commitment
Team members typically have little or no authority over each other in a 
matrix environment. Therefore, they perform their project assignments 
because they choose to, not because they have to. Work with people initially 
and throughout your project to encourage them to commit to your project’s 
goals (see Chapter 14 for more on how to encourage team member buy in).
Eliciting support from other 
people in the environment
 
The project manager’s authority over team members is frequently limited; 
for the most part, he must rely on suggestion, encouragement, and persua-
sion to help team members address issues and accomplish their assignments. 
Therefore, it’s important that you identify and establish relationships with 

197
 Chapter 9: Aligning the Key Players for Your Project
others who can help you deal with situations that you’re unable to resolve 
yourself. Here’s how:
 
✓ Get a champion. Because you most likely don’t have authority over all 
the people who affect the chances for your project’s success, get an ally 
who does have that authority — and do so as soon as possible. This 
project champion can help resolve team members’ schedule and inter-
personal conflicts and raise your project’s visibility in the organization. 
(See Chapter 3 for more information.)
 
✓ Ask for and acknowledge your team members’ functional managers’ 
support. By thanking functional managers for supporting their staff and 
allowing the staff to honor their project commitments, you’re encourag-
ing those managers to provide similar support for you and others in the 
future.
Heading off common problems 
before they arise
 
Take the following steps upfront and throughout your project to head off 
potential conflicts and concerns before they arise:
 
✓ Plan in sufficient detail. Work with team members to clearly and con-
cisely define the project work and each person’s specific roles and 
responsibilities for all activities. This planning helps people more accu-
rately estimate the amount of effort they need to give and the timing of 
that effort for each assignment.
 
✓ Identify and address conflicts promptly. Conflicts frequently arise in 
a matrix environment, given people’s diverse responsibilities, different 
styles, and lack of experience working together. Encourage people to 
identify and discuss conflicts as soon as they arise. Develop systems 
and procedures to deal with conflicts promptly — before they get out of 
hand.
 
✓ Encourage open communication among team members, especially 
regarding problems and frustrations. The earlier you hear about 
problems, the more time you have to deal with them. Discussing and 
resolving team issues encourages working relationships that are more 
enjoyable and productive.
 
✓ Encourage upper management to establish an oversight committee to 
monitor project performance and to address resource and other con-
flicts. Project and functional managers must focus on the goals for their 
respective areas of responsibility. Often, both groups rely on the same 

198
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
pool of people to reach these goals. But these diverse needs can place 
conflicting demands on people’s time and effort. An upper-management 
oversight committee can ensure that the needs of the entire organiza-
tion are considered when addressing these conflicts.

Defining Team Members’ Roles 
and Responsibilities
In This Chapter
▶ Characterizing authority, responsibility, and accountability
▶ Delegating assignments the right way
▶ Developing and using a Responsibility Assignment Matrix
▶ Handling micromanagement effectively
Your project team typically includes people with different skill sets and 
operating styles who work in different parts of the organization. Thus, 
you may not have worked extensively with your team members before. In 
addition, your project usually has a tight time schedule, and team members 
most likely are working on several other assignments at the same time.
Success in this kind of environment requires that you and your team mem-
bers agree on how to work with each other to maximize contributions and 
minimize wasted time and mistakes. The team needs an approach that gives 
everyone confidence that members will live up to their commitments. The 
project manager and every team member must understand and be comfort-
able with their planned roles.
This chapter explains how to distinguish between the different degrees of 
team member task involvement, make key assignments, encourage people to 
keep their promises, present an overall picture of team members’ roles and 
responsibilities, and, finally, handle a micromanager.
Understanding the Key Roles
A typical project entails performing specific pieces of work, making decisions, 
and coordinating the activities of others. To accomplish the project with a min-
imum of time and resources, each piece of work must be done in the correct 
order, and each person must work at peak efficiency, being sure not to repeat 

200
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
or duplicate unnecessarily work that others have already done. The more com-
plex the project and the greater the number of people working on it, the more 
difficult it is to ensure people don’t step on each other’s toes along the way.
To help you start coordinating people’s efforts, this section defines three dif-
ferent roles that team members can play when working on a project activity 
and takes a look at their similarities and differences.
Distinguishing authority, responsibility, 
and accountability
The following concepts can help you define and clarify how team members 
should relate to each other and to their assigned tasks:
 
✓ Authority: The ability to make binding decisions about your project’s 
products, schedule, resources, and activities. Examples include your 
ability to sign purchase orders that don’t exceed $3,000 and your ability 
to change a scheduled date by no more than two weeks.
 
✓ Responsibility: The commitment to achieve specific results. An example 
is your promise to have a draft report ready by March 1.
 
✓ Accountability: Bringing consequences to bear in response to people’s 
performance, such as your boss noting in your annual performance 
appraisal that you solved a tough manufacturing problem.
 
 Unfortunately, many people think accountability means only paying the 
price when you foul up. This fear of having to be accountable for their 
mistakes often leads people to avoid situations in which they would be 
accountable for their performance. Paying a price when you foul up is 
certainly half of the concept, but the other half is being rewarded for 
doing a good job. This positive reinforcement is far more effective than 
negative reinforcement for encouraging high-quality results.
 
Although these three terms are related, each term is a distinct and necessary 
element of defining and reinforcing team roles.
Comparing authority and responsibility
Both authority and responsibility are upfront agreements. Before you start 
your project, you agree who can make which decisions and who will ensure 
particular results. However, authority focuses on processes, while responsi-
bility focuses on outcomes:
 
✓ Authority defines the decisions you can make but doesn’t mention the 
results you have to achieve.

201
 Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities
 
✓ Responsibility addresses the results you must accomplish but doesn’t 
mention the decisions you can make to reach those results.
Remember, too, that you can transfer the authority to make decisions to 
another person, but you can’t transfer the responsibility for the results of 
those decisions. (For more about delegating authority and sharing responsi-
bility, check out the next section.)
Suppose you have the authority to issue purchase orders up to $5,000 for 
your project. Assume no policy or instructions specifically prevent you from 
giving some or all of this authority to someone else, so you give Matt, one of 
your team members, authority to sign purchase orders for your project not 
to exceed $4,000. However, if Matt mistakenly issues a $3,000 purchase order 
for ten reams of specialty paper instead of a $1,500 purchase order for the 
five reams that he really needs, you’re still responsible for his error.
 
You can always take back authority that you gave to someone else, but you 
can’t blame the person for exercising that authority while he has it.
Making Project Assignments
Effectively eliciting the help and support of others in the work you do is 
essential to get the most out of all team members. This section focuses spe-
cifically on what you need to know about defining project roles, including 
deciding what can and can’t be delegated, assigning roles with confidence, 
sharing responsibility, and holding everyone accountable.
Delving into delegation
Delegating is giving away something you have. (I know other definitions of 
delegating exist, but to keep it simple: to delegate is to give away.) In the fol-
lowing sections, I help you decide what to delegate and understand different 
degrees of delegation; I also explain how to support your delegations and 
achieve the best results possible.
 
You can delegate authority, but you can only share responsibility. You can 
completely transfer your decision-making power to someone else so she can 
make the decisions with no involvement or approval from you. However, when 
another person agrees to assume a responsibility of yours, you’re still obli-
gated to ensure that she achieves the desired results. See the later section 
“Sharing responsibility” for more details.

202
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
Deciding what to delegate
You delegate authority for four reasons:
 
✓ To free yourself up to do other tasks
 
✓ To have the most qualified person make decisions
 
✓ To get another qualified person’s perspective on an issue
 
✓ To develop another person’s ability to handle additional assignments 
prudently and successfully
 
Although the potential benefits of delegating can be significant, not every task 
can or should be delegated. Consider the following guidelines when deciding 
which tasks are appropriate candidates for delegation:
 
✓ Assign yourself to the tasks that you do best. Suppose you’re the best 
lawyer in town and there’s more demand for your services at a fee of 
$500 per hour than you can meet. Suppose also that you can type twice 
as fast as the next fastest typist in town, who charges $200 per hour. 
Should you type all your own legal briefs?
 
 The answer is no. If you spend an hour typing, you’d save the $400 you’d 
have to pay the typist (who’d require two hours at a cost of $200 per 
hour to do the same work). However, if you spend the same one hour 
providing legal services, you’d earn $500, which would allow you to pay 
the typist $400 for the work and still have $100 left over. (This concept is 
referred to as the law of comparative advantage.)
 
✓ If possible, assign yourself to tasks that aren’t on a project’s critical 
path. (See Chapter 5 for a discussion of critical paths.) A delay on any 
activity on a project’s critical path pushes back the estimated date for 
project completion. Therefore, when you have to stop working on a task 
that’s on your project’s critical path to deal with problems on another 
task, you immediately delay the entire project.
 
 Suppose you’re managing a project to develop and present a train-
ing program. Part of the project entails preparing the content for the 
training manual and reserving the facilities where you’ll present the 
training. Each activity is on one of the project’s critical paths, and 
both are scheduled to be performed at the same time. Because you’re 
so concerned that the training manual has the correct content and is 
completed on time, you assign yourself to finish developing it, and you 
assign Marty, a member of your project team, to reserve the facilities.
 
 When Marty encounters an unexpected problem while trying to use the 
organization’s credit card to pay for the deposit to hold the facilities, 
you feel you need to help him resolve it. However, if you stop working 
on your critical path activity of completing the training manual to help 
him, your project’s completion will be delayed.
 
✓ Don’t assign other people to work on a task that you can’t clearly 
describe. The time you save by not working on the task is more than 

203
 Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities
offset by the time you spend answering questions and continually redi-
recting the person to whom you’ve assigned the unclear task.
Understanding degrees of delegation
Delegation doesn’t have to be an all-or-nothing proposition, where you either 
make all decisions yourself or you withdraw from the situation entirely. 
Consider the following six degrees of delegation, each of which builds on and 
extends the ones that come before it:
 
✓ Get in the know. Get the facts and bring them to me for further action.
 
✓ Show me the way to go. Develop alternative actions to take based on 
the facts you’ve found.
 
✓ Go when I say so. Be prepared to take one or more of the actions you’ve 
proposed, but don’t do anything until I say so.
 
✓ Go unless I say no. Tell me what you propose to do and when, and take 
your recommended actions unless I tell you otherwise.
 
✓ How’d it go? Analyze the situation, develop a course of action, take 
action, and let me know the results.
 
✓ Just go! Here’s a situation; deal with it.
Each level of delegation entails some degree of independent authority. For 
example, as your manager, when I ask you to find the facts about a situation, 
you choose what information sources to consult, which information to share 
with me, and which to discard. The primary difference between the levels of 
delegation is the degree of checking with the manager before taking action.
Supporting your delegations of authority
You must reinforce and support your delegations of authority, or you can 
find yourself doing the task you thought you had assigned to someone else.
 
Suppose you’ve been a manager of a project for the past two months, and 
Mary, who has been your assistant, has been dealing with people’s technical 
issues. When someone comes to Mary with a technical problem, she analyzes 
the problem, decides how to address it, and passes the problem and her 
proposed solution by you. If you agree with her solution, you ask her to imple-
ment it. If you don’t, you help her develop a more acceptable one.
Yesterday, you told Mary that, from now on, she doesn’t have to pass her 
proposed solutions by you before implementing them. After discussing this 
with her, you told the other team members about the new procedure.
This morning Joe came to Mary to discuss a problem he was having with 
a contractor, and after listening to the problem, she gave Joe very specific 
instructions for how to deal with it. When Joe left Mary’s office, he called you, 
recounted the problem he had discussed with Mary and her proposed solu-
tion, and asked you whether you agreed with Mary’s approach.

204
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
You now have a dilemma. On the one hand, you want to support Mary’s 
newly delegated authority. On the other hand, you want to ensure that your 
project goes smoothly and successfully. What should you do?
The only response you can make to Joe that supports your delegation of 
authority to Mary is: “Do whatever Mary told you to do.”
 
Responding to Joe with, “Yes, Mary’s solution sounds good to me,” doesn’t 
work because, by declaring that you like Mary’s solution, you undercut Mary’s 
authority to make the decision on her own! Perhaps you intend your words to 
assure Joe that you have full confidence in Mary’s ability to develop an appro-
priate solution and that the one she proposed is an example of her good judg-
ment. In reality, your response suggests to Joe that you’re still in the approval 
process because you gave your approval to Mary’s decision rather than to her 
exercising her authority to make the decision.
You want to support your delegation, but you also want to ensure your proj-
ect’s success. So how do you deal with the following situations?
 
✓ You don’t agree with Mary’s recommendation. If you fear that following 
Mary’s recommendation will have catastrophic consequences, you must 
suggest to Joe that he wait until you can discuss the issue with Mary. 
In this instance, protecting your project and your organization is more 
important than supporting your delegation of authority.
 
 In all other instances, though, you need to tell Joe to follow Mary’s sug-
gestion because she has the authority to make that decision. Here are 
several reasons to do so, even if you don’t agree with her choice:
 
• She may know more about the situation than Joe told you.
 
• Maybe she’s right and you’re wrong.
 
• If Mary believes that you’ll jump in to save her every time she 
makes a bad decision, she’ll be less concerned about making the 
correct decision the first time.
 
 You can always ask Mary later to explain to you privately the rationale 
for her decision, and you can offer your thoughts and opinions when 
you feel they’re necessary.
 
✓ Joe’s call indicates a more general problem with the team’s proce-
dures and working relationships.
 
• Perhaps you weren’t clear when you explained the new working 
procedures with Mary to your team. Explain and reinforce the new 
procedures to Joe and the other team members.
 
• Perhaps Joe didn’t like Mary’s answer and is trying to go behind 
her back to get his way. Again, you must reinforce that the deci-
sion is Mary’s to make.

205
 Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities
 
• Perhaps Mary didn’t adequately explain to Joe why she recom-
mended what she did. Suggest to Mary that she discuss with Joe 
the reasons behind her solutions and that she verifies that he 
understands and is comfortable with the information she shares.
 
• Perhaps some interpersonal conflict exists between Joe and Mary. 
Talk with both of them to determine whether such a conflict exists 
and, if it does, how it came about. Work with Joe and Mary to help 
them address and resolve the conflict.
Delegating to achieve results
Delegation always involves some risk — you have to live with the conse-
quences of someone else’s decisions. However, you can take the following 
steps to improve the person’s chances for successful performance:
 
1. Clarify what you want to delegate.
 
 Describe in unambiguous terms the activity you want the other person 
to perform and the results you want her to achieve. If necessary, also 
explain what you don’t want the person to do.
 
2. Choose the right person.
 
 Determine the skills and knowledge you feel a person must have to per-
form the task successfully, and don’t delegate the task to a person who 
lacks these skills and knowledge. (See Chapter 6 for more on describing 
the skills and knowledge people need to do different jobs.)
 
3. Make the delegation correctly.
 
 Explain the activity to be performed, the effort you expect the person to 
expend, and the date she should have the activity completed. Put this 
information in writing for clarity and future reference.
 
4. Be available to answer questions.
 
 Maintaining contact while the person performs the task allows you to 
ensure that any ambiguities and unexpected situations encountered are 
resolved promptly and to your satisfaction. It also conveys to the person 
that the task is important to you.
 
5. Monitor performance.
 
 Set up frequent, well-defined checkpoints at which you can monitor the 
person’s performance. Then keep that schedule.
 
6. Promptly address problems that arise.
 
 If you feel the person’s performance isn’t satisfactory, discuss your con-
cerns and develop steps to bring it back on track.

206
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
Sharing responsibility
The decision to delegate authority is unilateral; it doesn’t require the agree-
ment of both parties. You can choose to give someone the authority to make 
a decision whether or not she wants it. After you give your authority to 
another person, she’s free to pass it on to someone else (if you haven’t spe-
cifically told her not to).
 
Responsibility is a two-way agreement. You ask me to respond to a customer 
inquiry, and I agree that I will. Because you and I agree that I’ll handle the 
inquiry, I can’t decide to give the assignment to someone else and then not 
worry about whether she’ll handle it. I committed to you that the inquiry 
would be addressed; the only way I can free myself from this responsibility is 
to ask you to agree to change our original understanding.
 
Suppose Alice, your boss, asks you to prepare a report of your organiza-
tion’s latest sales figures. You know where to get the raw sales data, and you 
figure that you can prepare the text of the report in Microsoft Word and ask 
Bill, a member of your staff, to prepare any necessary graphics in Microsoft 
PowerPoint. So you accept Alice’s assignment, and you then ask for and 
receive Bill’s agreement to prepare the graphics for you.
A week later, Alice asks how you’re doing on the report. You tell her that 
you’ve completed the text, but Bill hasn’t finished the graphics, yet. You sug-
gest that she check with Bill to find out how he’s doing and when he’ll be fin-
ished. How do you think Alice will respond to your suggestion?
After a moment’s silence, Alice reminds you that you agreed to prepare the 
report and, therefore, that ensuring all parts of the work are complete is your 
responsibility, not hers. In other words, because you accepted the respon-
sibility for completing the report, you can’t choose unilaterally to give away 
part of that responsibility to someone else.
Alice was correct in refusing to deal directly with Bill for other reasons:
 
✓ If Alice had agreed to check directly with Bill, she would have tacitly 
been telling him that whenever you give him assignments in the future, 
he should be concerned about satisfying her rather than you. In other 
words, she would have undermined your leadership position.
 
✓ Following up with Bill would’ve been difficult for Alice to do, even if she 
had wanted to, because she didn’t know exactly what you asked him to 
do or when you asked him to have it done.
The only way you can relieve yourself of some or all of the responsibility you 
accepted is to ask Alice to agree to a revised plan.

 Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities
Holding people accountable when 
they don’t report to you
People who make promises, fail to keep them, and then suffer no conse-
quences create some of the worst frustrations in a project environment. 
Observe these guidelines to encourage people to honor commitments to you:
 
✓ If you’re responsible, you should be held accountable. In other words, 
if you make a promise, you should always experience consequences 
based on how well you keep your promise.
 
✓ If you’re not responsible, you shouldn’t be held accountable. When 
something goes wrong but you weren’t responsible for ensuring that it 
was handled correctly, you shouldn’t face negative consequences. (Of 
course, you shouldn’t receive accolades when it goes well, either.)
 
 Holding people accountable when something they aren’t responsible for 
goes wrong is called scapegoating. Assigning blame indiscriminately only 
encourages people to avoid dealing with you in the future.
When a person who doesn’t report to you administratively promises to do 
something for you, holding her accountable can be a touchy issue. You may 
not try to hold her accountable because you think it’s inappropriate (after all, 
you’re not her boss) or because you don’t know how to do so. But remem-
ber: Holding people accountable is appropriate and necessary when they’ve 
accepted a responsibility. Accountability helps people know that they’re on 
the right track, and it enables you to acknowledge when they’ve completed 
the promised assignments. You don’t need authority to hold people account-
able; the people just have to have accepted the responsibility.
 
Use the following approaches to hold people accountable when you don’t 
have direct authority over them:
 
✓ Find out who has direct authority over the person and bring that 
supervisor into the process. Consider soliciting the approval of the per-
son’s boss when you ask the person to accept responsibility for a task. 
When you do so correctly and at the right time, you can improve the 
chances for success. If a person’s boss is unaware that her staff member 
agreed to perform a task for you, your chances of getting the boss’s help 
when the person fails to perform as promised are small. However, if the 
boss supported her staff member’s offer to help you when it was made, 
the boss and her staff member shouldn’t be surprised if you solicit the 
boss’s help when the staff member doesn’t do the task.

208
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
 
✓ Put it in writing. Have you ever noticed how strangely people react 
when you put an informal agreement in writing? All of a sudden, they 
act as if you don’t trust them. Don’t let this reaction deter you. Put your 
agreement in writing to formalize it, to clarify the terms, and to serve 
as a reminder to both you and the person agreeing to do the task. If the 
person asks whether you want to have a written agreement because you 
don’t trust that she’ll do what she promises, explain to her that if you 
didn’t trust her, you wouldn’t work with her at all!
 
✓ Be specific. The clearer you make your request, the easier it is for the 
person to estimate the effort she needs to respond to the request and 
to produce the right result the first time. You may feel that being too 
specific is inappropriate because you have no direct authority over her. 
But recognize that putting a request in writing doesn’t make it an order; 
it just clarifies its specifics and makes it easier to perform.
 
✓ Follow up. Negotiate a schedule to monitor the person’s performance 
and to address any issues or questions that arise. Be sure to
 
• Negotiate a follow-up schedule at the outset of the agreement. If 
you call unannounced at random times, you appear to be checking 
up because you don’t trust the person.
 
• Base your follow-up schedule on when the person plans to achieve 
certain intermediate milestones; this timeline gives you more 
objective criteria for an assessment.
 
✓ Make the person accountable to the team. Your most valuable profes-
sional asset is your reputation. When a person promises to do some-
thing for you, let others on your team know about the promise. When 
the person lives up to that promise, acknowledge her accomplishment 
in front of her colleagues. If the person fails to live up to the promise, let 
her know you’ll share that information with others.
 
✓ Get commitment. When a person indicates that she’ll help you out, be 
sure to get a firm, specific commitment that the desired result will be 
achieved by a specific time and for a specific cost. Beware of vague dec-
larations like “I’ll give it my best effort” or “You can count on me.”
 
✓ Create a sense of urgency and importance. You may want to mini-
mize any pressure the person feels by offering to understand if she 
can’t perform to your expectations because of one reason or another. 
Unfortunately, this approach suggests that the work you’re asking her to 
do isn’t really that important and actually increases the chance that she 
won’t complete it. Instead, let the person know how her work influences 
other activities and people on the project. Let her know why she needs 
to perform to expectations and what the consequences will be — to the 
project and the organization — if she doesn’t.
The nearby sidebar “Holding the line when someone else drops the ball” has 
an example of holding someone accountable when he isn’t your direct report.

209
 Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities
Holding the line when someone else drops the ball
Suppose you recently joined a team work-
ing on a project to develop and implement an 
upgraded inventory control system for your 
organization. When you learn that your friend 
Eric had been on this team until a month ago, 
you call him to discuss his experiences on the 
project.
After listening to his in-depth account of his 
project involvement, you explain that you and 
three other team members have been asked 
to develop the new system’s users’ manual. 
You ask him whether, in view of his extensive 
knowledge of the project’s history, he’d be will-
ing to do you a favor and write a draft of Chapter 
1 of the manual that recounts the system’s 
background and evolution. Today is Monday, 
and you explain you need the draft by a week 
from Friday. Eric agrees, and you both hang up.
Unfortunately, you never receive the draft 
of Chapter 1 from Eric. He never calls you to 
explain why he didn’t submit the draft, and you 
never check with him to see what’s happening.
You probably make and receive requests like 
this one several times each day. Unfortunately, 
too many times people promise to help you out 
but don’t deliver. You have to find ways to hold 
people accountable when they make agree-
ments to complete assignments for you — even 
if you have no direct authority over them.
Of course, you can hold people accountable 
only if they accept responsibility in the first 
place. Therefore, in the preceding illustration, 
the first question you have to ask is: After your 
phone call, did Eric accept the responsibility to 
write the draft for you and your colleagues?
Very simply, the answer is yes. How do you 
know? Because he said he would. Take note, 
however, that I’m not suggesting that Eric is 
responsible for preparing the draft of Chapter 
1 and that you and your colleagues are off the 
hook. Your responsibility to prepare the users’ 
manual hasn’t changed, but Eric accepted the 
responsibility to prepare the Chapter 1 draft for 
you. That Eric no longer works on the project 
or that he doesn’t report to you or your boss is 
beside the point. He’s responsible because he 
said he would be.
Eric may argue that he has a personal obliga-
tion to complete the draft (because he said 
he would) but no organizational obligation 
because the agreement wasn’t in writing and 
he wasn’t officially on your project team. That 
argument doesn’t hold up, though; he’s respon-
sible because he said he would be. If he didn’t 
want to accept the responsibility, he only had 
to say no.
The second question is: Did you do anything to 
hold Eric accountable for not keeping his prom-
ise? The answer to this question is no. If Eric 
never sent you the draft, your actions (or lack of 
them) send him the following messages:
 ✓ The assignment wasn’t that important. 
What a terrible message to send! You 
asked Eric to take time away from his busy 
day to do something for you, and you didn’t 
even care whether he completed the task? 
He’s probably happy that he decided not 
to spend time on the task because, appar-
ently, it wouldn’t have made a difference 
anyway.
 ✓ Eric’s behavior was okay. This message 
is even worse! It confirms that making 
promises and then not performing and 
not explaining your reasons for not per-
forming is okay. Circumstances may have 
arisen that made it impossible for Eric to 
honor his commitment, but does that jus-
tify not calling to tell you about the situa-
tion? Unfortunately, this type of behavior, 
multiplied many times every day, defines 
(continued)

Picture This: Depicting Roles with a 
Responsibility Assignment Matrix
Defining and sharing team roles and responsibilities upfront can help you 
improve performance and identify and head off potential difficulties during 
a project. One way you can display team roles and responsibilities is in a 
Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) — also called a Linear Responsibility 
Chart (LRC). This section helps you understand the elements of a RAM, effec-
tively read a RAM, develop your own chart, and improve your chart to meet 
your own needs. Your only limit is your creativity!
 
A RACI chart is a particular type of RAM. The RACI chart derives its name 
from the first letters of the four roles most commonly used in the chart — 
Responsible, Accountable, Consult, and Inform.
Introducing the elements of a RAM
The RAM is a table that depicts each project audience’s role in the per-
formance of different project activities (see Chapter 3 for more on project 
an organizational environment in which 
promises mean little and breaking them 
becomes an accepted part of business as 
usual.
Most likely, you didn’t intend to convey these 
messages. You probably figured that Eric didn’t 
send the draft because he was busy with other 
work, and you didn’t want to make a big deal 
about it because he agreed to go out of his 
way to help you. Unfortunately, he can’t know 
what’s in your mind because you didn’t tell him.
Maybe he didn’t ignore his promise to prepare 
the draft. Consider some other possibilities:
 ✓ He sent you the draft, but it got lost in 
the delivery system. Unfortunately, most 
people figure that no news is good news. 
When Eric didn’t get a call from you, he 
probably assumed that you’d received the 
draft and found it acceptable. Certainly, he 
reasoned, you would’ve called if you had 
any questions!
 ✓ He misunderstood you initially; he thought 
you needed the draft by a month (rather 
than a week) from Friday. Maybe he’s still 
working on the draft and plans to give it to 
you on the date he thought you needed it.
Accountability is a management-control pro-
cess. Responding to a person’s actions lets the 
person know whether he’s on target or whether 
he needs to make a correction. Not respond-
ing to unacceptable performance unfortunately 
increases the likelihood that it will occur again.

audiences). A RAM’s format is as follows (see Figure 10-1, which illustrates a 
portion of a RAM for designing and conducting a customer-needs survey):
 
✓ Project deliverables are in the left-hand column.
 
✓ Project audiences are in the top row.
 
✓ The role each audience will play in performing the work to produce each 
deliverable is in the intersections of the rows and columns.

People
The RAM in Figure 10-1 indicates which of the following three roles people 
can have in this project’s activities:
 
✓ Primary responsibility (P): You’ll ensure the results are achieved.
 
✓ Secondary responsibility (S): You’ll ensure some portion of the results 
is achieved.
 
✓ Approval (A): You’re not actually working on the deliverable, but you 
approve the results produced by others who are.
 
The RAM is just a format; for each project, you define and assign the roles you 
feel are appropriate. You may, for example, decide to use the following roles 
in addition to the three already defined:
 
✓ Review (R): You review and comment on the results of an activity, but 
your formal approval isn’t required.
 
✓ Output (O): You receive products from the activity.
 
✓ Input (I): You provide input for the activity work.

212
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
Reading a RAM
To illustrate how you read the RAM, consider the deliverable questionnaire 
design in Figure 10-1. The chart suggests that three people work together on 
this activity as follows:
 
✓ Staffer A has primary responsibility for the questionnaire’s content, 
format, and layout. On this project, Staffer A reports to the task leader 
who, in turn, reports to the project manager.
 
✓ The task leader performs selected parts of the questionnaire design 
under the general coordination of Staffer A. Also, the task leader must 
approve all aspects of the questionnaire design before work can proceed 
to the next step.
 
✓ The project manager must approve the entire questionnaire, even 
though he isn’t doing any of the actual design or layout himself.
You can analyze any RAM vertically by audience and horizontally by activ-
ity for situations that may give rise to problems. For an example, check out 
Table 10-1, which notes some observations about the assignments displayed 
in Figure 10-1 and issues they may suggest. After you identify these situa-
tions, you can decide how to address them.
Table 10-1 
Situations and Issues Suggested in Figure 10-1
Situation
Possible Issues
The project manager has no direct 
responsibilities for individual project 
deliverables.
Will the project manager fully under-
stand the substance and status of 
the project work?
The task leader is heavily committed.
The task leader won’t have enough 
time to handle all these duties.
The task leader is making all key 
decisions.
What if the task leader leaves during 
the project?
The group director doesn’t get involved 
until he is asked to approve the funds for 
printing the questionnaires.
The group director will slow down 
the approval process by asking 
questions about the purpose of the 
project, the use of the results, and 
so on.

213
 Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities
Situation
Possible Issues
The task leader is the only person 
involved in selecting the respondents.
Do you want a key decision (that can 
determine the validity of the entire 
pretest) to be made by only one 
person?
The deliverable final questionnaire print-
ing requires three approvals.
Does anyone else have to approve 
the questionnaire before it can be 
used?
Are too many people approving the 
questionnaire? Would it be accept-
able just to notify one or two of these 
people rather than to require their 
sign-off?
The activity may take longer than 
estimated because the people 
approving the questionnaire aren’t 
under the project manager’s direct 
control.
 
After identifying a potential issue with your project’s role assignments, you 
can choose how to deal with it. Possibilities include
 
✓ Ignoring the issue: For example, you may decide that three approvals 
are necessary to print the questionnaires.
 
✓ Taking simple steps to minimize the risk of a problem: For example, 
you may ask the task leader to thoroughly document all important infor-
mation in case he leaves the project unexpectedly.
 
✓ Addressing the issue further in a formal risk-management plan: See 
Chapter 8 for a discussion of how to analyze and plan to manage risks.
Developing a RAM
Despite the straightforward nature of the information included in the RAM, 
getting everyone to agree on people’s roles can be time-consuming. The fol-
lowing steps can help you get people’s input and approval with the least time 
and effort:
 
1. Identify all people who’ll participate in or support your project.
 
 See the discussion of project audiences in Chapter 3 for details.

214
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
 
2. Develop a complete list of deliverables for your project.
 
 See Chapter 4 for details on a Work Breakdown Structure.
 
3. Discuss with all team members how they’ll each support the work to 
produce the different project deliverables.
 
 For each of their assignments, discuss the level of their responsibility 
and authority, as well as the specific work they’ll perform. Also discuss 
with them any involvement that others will have on their activities. If 
specific people haven’t yet been identified for certain activities, consult 
with people who have done those types of activities before.
 
4. Prepare an initial draft of your RAM.
 
 Draw the table for your chart, and enter your project’s deliverables in 
the left-hand column and the people who will support the activities in 
the first row. In the cells formed by the intersection of each row and 
column, enter the roles that each person will have (based on the discus-
sions you have with your team members in Step 3).
 
5. Have the people whom you consulted in Step 3 review and approve 
your draft chart.
 
 If people agree with the chart, ask them to indicate their agreement in 
writing. If they express concerns about some aspects, ask them to note 
their concerns in a memo or an e-mail.
 
6. If some of your team members don’t approve the draft chart, revise 
the chart to address their concerns and ask all people who gave input 
to review and approve the revised chart.
 
 If you make any changes to the draft RAM, have all your team mem-
bers review and approve the revised chart, especially if they already 
approved the prior version.
 
7. Go back to Step 5 and continue the process until everyone you con-
sulted in Step 3 approves the chart.
Ensuring your RAM is accurate
For complex projects, the RAM can be quite large. And keeping the chart cur-
rent and consulting throughout the project with all the people identified can 
be time-consuming. However, having a chart with incorrect information can 
result in duplicated efforts and overlooked activities. The following sections 
offer you suggestions for how you can keep your RAM accurate and current 
throughout the project.
Developing a hierarchy of charts
Including 50 or more activities on the same RAM can be cumbersome, so con-
sider developing a series of nested charts for larger projects (also known as 
a hierarchy of charts). Prepare a high-level chart that identifies responsibilities 

215
 Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities
for higher-level components in your Work Breakdown Structure (such as 
project phases and major deliverables), and then develop separate charts 
that detail responsibilities for lower-level deliverables and work packages. 
(See Chapter 4 for the definition of phases, deliverables, and work packages 
in a Work Breakdown Structure.)
 
Suppose you’re planning a project to design and implement an information 
system. Figure 10-2 illustrates how you may create two layers of RAMs to 
depict the project team members’ roles. Prepare a high-level RAM that details 
the roles for major phases, such as requirements, system design, and system 
test. Display in a second chart the roles of the team leader and his group in 
terms of the activities that comprise requirements.

Getting input from everyone involved
Involve the entire team when developing your chart. As the project manager, 
you don’t know exactly how people should perform tasks in their areas of 
specialty, so you need to ask them. And, even if you do know, people have a 
greater commitment to a plan when they participate in developing it.

216
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
Putting your RAM in writing
You may think you can save time by not putting your RAM in writing. 
However, putting the chart in writing is essential for two reasons:
 
✓ You can see possible problems in your project that you may have 
overlooked if you were considering pieces of information separately.
 
 Refer to the RAM in Figure 10-1. Before preparing the chart, the task 
leader knew he was primarily responsible for selecting respondents or 
the questionnaire’s pretest, and other team members knew they weren’t 
involved in that activity. But writing this down in the RAM highlights 
that the task leader is, in fact, the only one involved in this activity.
 
✓ You ensure that people have a common understanding of their roles 
and relationships.
Keeping your RAM up to date
The longer your project is, the more likely it is that activities will be added 
or deleted, that people will leave the team, and that new people will join the 
team. Periodically reviewing and updating your RAM enables you to
 
✓ Assess whether the current assignments are working out and, if not, 
where changes may be needed.
 
✓ Clarify the roles and responsibilities for new activities.
 
✓ Clarify the roles and responsibilities for new people who join the team.
 
You can develop a RAM at any time during a project. If you join a project 
that’s underway and find that no RAM exists, develop one to clarify the roles 
and responsibilities from the current point forward.
Dealing with Micromanagement
 
Micromanagement is a person’s excessive, inappropriate, and unnecessary 
involvement in the details of a task that she asks another person to perform. 
It can lead to inefficient use of personal time and energy, as well as to tension 
and low morale. In this section, I help you look at the causes for micromanage-
ment, give you some tips on ways to gain your micromanager’s trust and con-
fidence, and suggest how to work with a micromanager.
Realizing why a person micromanages
Unfortunately, no simple rules define when a person is micromanaging. If you 
think your boss is getting a little too close for comfort, let her know you feel 

217
 Chapter 10: Defining Team Members’ Roles and Responsibilities
that her oversight is a bit excessive. Try to give her some objective indica-
tors to explain why you feel the way you do.
 
If the person doesn’t change, you need to understand why she continues to 
micromanage you. Think about whether one or more of the following explana-
tions may be the reason, and try the suggested approaches:
 
✓ The person is interested in and enjoys the work. Set up times to dis-
cuss interesting technical issues with the person.
 
✓ The person is a technical expert and feels that she can do the job best. 
Review your technical work frequently with the person; give the person 
opportunities to share her technical insights with you.
 
✓ The person may feel that she didn’t explain the assignment clearly or 
that unexpected situations may crop up. Set up a schedule to discuss 
and review your progress frequently so that the micromanager can 
promptly uncover any mistakes and help you correct them.
 
✓ The person is looking for ways to stay involved with you and the 
team. Set up scheduled times to discuss project activities. Provide the 
micromanager with periodic reports of project progress, and make a 
point to stop by and say “Hello” periodically.
 
✓ The person feels threatened because you have more technical knowl-
edge than she does. When talking about your project in front of others, 
always credit the micromanager for her guidance and insights. Share key 
technical information with the person on a regular basis.
 
✓ The person doesn’t have a clear understanding of how she should be 
spending her time. Discuss with the person the roles she would like 
you to assume on project activities. Explain how the person can provide 
useful support as you perform the work.
 
✓ The person feels that she has to stay up on the work you’re doing 
in case anyone else asks about it. Discuss with the person what type 
of information she needs and how frequently she needs it. Develop a 
schedule to provide progress reports that include this information.
Helping a micromanager trust you
Your boss may be micromanaging you because she doesn’t yet have full con-
fidence in your ability to perform. Instead of being angry or resentful, take 
the following steps to help your boss develop that confidence:
 
✓ Don’t be defensive or resentful when the person asks you questions. 
Doing so makes you appear like you’re hiding something, which only 
makes the person worry more. Instead, willingly provide all the informa-
tion the person asks for.

218
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
 
✓ Thank the micromanager for her interest, time, and technical guid-
ance. Complaining about what you perceive to be excessive oversight 
strains your relationship and increases the person’s fears and insecuri-
ties. After you explain that you value and will incorporate her input, you 
can try to develop a more acceptable working relationship.
 
✓ Offer to explain how you approach your tasks. Seeing that you perform 
your work using appropriate, high-quality techniques increases your 
manager’s confidence that you’ll successfully complete the assignment 
she gave you.
 
✓ Work with the person to develop a scheme for sharing progress and 
accomplishments. Develop meaningful and frequent checkpoints. 
Frequent monitoring early in your work reassures both of you that 
you’re performing the assignments successfully.
Working well with a micromanager
You can reduce or even eliminate most micromanagement by improving your 
communication and strengthening your interpersonal relationships. Consider 
the following tips as you work with a micromanager:
 
✓ Don’t assume. Don’t jump to conclusions. Examine the situation and try 
to understand the motivations of the person who’s micromanaging you.
 
✓ Listen. Listen to the micromanager’s questions and comments; see if 
patterns emerge. Try to understand her real interests and concerns.
 
✓ Observe the person’s behavior with others. If the person microman-
ages others, the micromanagement likely stems from her feelings rather 
than from your actions. Try to find ways to address the person’s real 
interests and concerns.
 
✓ If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. If your first attempts to 
address the situation are unsuccessful, develop an alternative strategy. 
Keep at it until you succeed.

“Tell me the good news,” you respond.
“Your plan’s been approved.”
“So, what’s the bad news?” you ask.
“Now you have to do the project!”
Starting off your project correctly is a key to ultimate success. Your project 
plan describes what you’ll produce, the work you’ll do, how you’ll do it, when 
you’ll do it, and which resources you’ll need to do it. When you write your 
project plan, you base it on the information you have at the time, and, if infor-
mation isn’t available, you make assumptions. The more time between your 
plan’s completion and its approval, the more changes you’re likely to find in 
your plan’s assumptions as you actually start your project.

222
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
As you prepare to start your project, you need to reconfirm or update the 
information in your plan, determine or reaffirm which people will play roles 
in your project and exactly what those roles will be, and prepare the systems 
and procedures that will support your project’s performance. This chapter 
tells you how to accomplish these tasks and get your project off to a strong 
start.
Finalizing Your Project’s Participants
 
A project audience is a person or group that supports, is affected by, or is 
interested in your project. (See Chapter 3 for a detailed discussion of how to 
identify project audiences.) In your project plan, you describe the roles you 
anticipate people to play and the amount of effort you expect team members 
to invest. You identify the people by name, by title or position, or by the skills 
and knowledge they need to have.
This section shows you how to reaffirm who will be involved in your project. 
It also helps you make sure everyone’s still on board — and tells you what to 
do if some people aren’t.
Are you in? Confirming your 
team members’ participation
As you start your project, you need to confirm the identities of the people 
who’ll work to support your project by verifying that specific people are still 
able to uphold their promised commitments and, if necessary, by recruiting 
and selecting new people to fulfill the remaining needs.
 
As you contact all the people who will support your project, be sure to do the 
following:
 
1. Inform them that your project has been approved and when work will 
start.
 
 Not all project plans are approved. You rarely know in advance how 
long the approval process will take or how soon your project can start. 
Inform team members as soon as possible so they can schedule the nec-
essary time.
 
2. Confirm that they’re still able to support your project.
 
 People’s workloads and other commitments may change between the time 
you prepare your plan and your project’s approval. If a person is no longer 
able to provide the promised support, recruit a replacement as soon as 
possible (see the later section “Filling in the blanks” for guidelines).

223
 Chapter 11: Starting Your Project Team Off on the Right Foot
 
3. Explain what you’ll do to develop the project team and start the proj-
ect work.
 
 Provide a list of all team members and others who will support the proj-
ect. Also mention the steps you’ll take to introduce members and kick 
off the project.
 
4. Reconfirm the work you expect them to perform, the schedules and 
deadlines you expect them to keep, and the amount of time you 
expect them to spend on the work.
 
 Clarify specific activities and the nature of the work.
Depending on the size and formality of your project, you can use any format 
from a quick e-mail to a formal Work-Order Agreement to share this informa-
tion with the people who will be involved in your project.
As Figure 11-1 illustrates, a typical Work-Order Agreement includes the follow-
ing information:
 
✓ Identifiers: The identifiers include the project name, project number, 
activity name, and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) code. (For more 
information about the WBS, see Chapter 4.) The project name and 
number confirm that your project is now official. You use the activ-
ity name and WBS code to record work progress as well as time and 
resource charges.
 
✓ Work to be performed and deliverables or results to be produced: 
These details describe the different activities and procedures involved 
in the project, as well as outputs of the project.
 
✓ Activity start date, end date, and number of hours to be spent: 
Including this information reaffirms
 
• The importance of doing the work within the schedule and budget
 
• Acknowledgement from the person who’ll do the work that he 
expects to do the described work within these time and resource 
constraints
 
• The criteria you’ll use to assess the person’s performance
 
✓ Written approvals from the person who’ll do the work, his supervisor, 
and the project manager: Including these written approvals increases 
the likelihood that everyone involved has read and understood the proj-
ect’s elements and is committed to support it.
 
Be sure you specify all this information when reconfirming a person’s commit-
ment to your project. The longer you wait to specify any of this information, 
the greater the chances are that the person won’t provide the support you 
had hoped for.

If you choose not to use a formal Work-Order Agreement, be sure to write 
down all key information that clarifies your agreement and get signed approv-
als from the team member and his supervisor. Asking for signed approvals 
encourages people to consider carefully before they make any commitments 
and serves as a reference and reminder of exactly what was promised.
Assuring that others are on board
Other people may also play a role in your project’s success, even though 
they may not officially be members of your project team. Two such groups 
are drivers (people who have a say in defining the results of your project) and 
supporters (people who will perform a service or provide resources for your 
team).
Another special audience is your project champion, a person in a high posi-
tion in the organization who strongly supports your project; who will advo-
cate for your project in disputes, planning meetings, and review sessions; 
and who will take necessary actions to help ensure your project’s success. 
(See Chapter 3 for a detailed discussion of these different types of project 
audiences.)

225
 Chapter 11: Starting Your Project Team Off on the Right Foot
Contact your project champion and all other drivers and supporters to
 
✓ Inform them that your project has been approved and when work will 
start.
 
✓ Reaffirm your project’s objectives.
 
✓ Confirm with identified drivers that the project’s planned results still 
address their needs.
 
✓ Clarify with supporters exactly how you want them to help your project.
 
✓ Develop specific plans for involving each audience throughout the proj-
ect and keeping them informed of progress.
 
Some people will be interested in your project but won’t define its planned 
results or directly support your efforts. As you identify these observers, as 
they’re often called, choose those individuals you want to keep informed of 
your progress throughout the project, and plan how you’ll do so. (See Chapter 3 
for a discussion of how to identify project observers and Chapter 13 for differ-
ent ways to keep people informed about your progress.)
Filling in the blanks
If your plan identifies proposed project team members only by job title, posi-
tion description, or skills and knowledge (and not by specific names), you 
have to find actual people to fill the specified roles. You can fill the empty 
roles by assigning responsibility to someone already on your organization’s 
staff, by recruiting a person from outside your organization, or by contract-
ing with an external organization.
Whichever method you choose, prepare a written description of the activities 
you want each person to perform. This description can range from a simple 
memo for informal projects to a written job description for more formal ones.
 
Write down your needs for each category of personnel separately. At a mini-
mum, include the following information in your role descriptions:
 
✓ Project name, number, and start date
 
✓ Necessary skills and knowledge
 
✓ Activities to be performed and start and end dates
 
✓ Anticipated level of effort

226
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
If you plan to look inside your organization to recruit team members for roles 
not yet filled, do the following:
 
✓ Identify potential candidates by working with your human resources 
(HR) department and area managers.
 
✓ Meet with the candidates to discuss your project, describe the work, 
and assess their qualifications.
 
✓ Choose the best candidates, and ask them to join your team.
 
✓ Document the agreements you make with the new team members.
If you’re looking outside the organization, consult with your organization’s HR 
department to identify potential resources. Provide a detailed description of 
the qualifications, skills, and knowledge needed, the expected tasks, and the 
anticipated level of effort. Sit in on the interviews and assessment process.
Also, if you plan to obtain the support of external consultants, work with 
your organization’s contracts office. Provide the contracts office with the 
same information that you provide your HR office. Review the contract docu-
ment before your contracting officer signs it.
In addition to filling your empty team member roles, work with people in key 
organizational units to identify people, other than team members, who will 
support your project (for example, a contracts specialist or a procurement 
specialist, as long as he or she isn’t officially on your project team). After you 
identify these people, do the following:
 
✓ Meet with them to clarify your project’s goals and anticipated outputs 
and the ways in which they will support your performance.
 
✓ Develop plans for involving them and keeping them informed of prog-
ress throughout your project.
Developing Your Team
Merely assigning people to tasks doesn’t create a project team. A team is a 
collection of people who are committed to common goals and who depend 
on one another to do their jobs. Project teams consist of members who can 
and must make a valuable and unique contribution to the project.
 
A team is different from other associations of people who work together. For 
example,
 
✓ A group consists of people who work individually to accomplish their 
particular assignments on a common task.

227
 Chapter 11: Starting Your Project Team Off on the Right Foot
 
✓ A committee consists of people who come together to review and cri-
tique issues, propose recommendations for action, and, on occasion, 
implement those recommendations.
 
As soon as you identify your project team members, take steps to define and 
establish your team’s identity as well as its operating practices. Develop the 
following elements, making sure your team understands and accepts them:
 
✓ Goals: What the team as a whole and members individually hope to 
accomplish
 
✓ Roles: Each member’s areas of specialty, position on the team, author-
ity, and assignments
 
✓ Processes: The techniques that team members will use to perform their 
project tasks
 
✓ Relationships: The attitudes and behaviors of team members toward 
one another
This section discusses how to begin creating your team’s identity by having 
members review and discuss the project plan, examine overall team and indi-
vidual team member goals, agree on everyone’s roles, and start to establish 
productive working relationships.
Reviewing the approved project plan
 
As soon as people join the team, have them review the approved project plan 
to reinforce the project’s goals, clarify the work planned, confirm the feasibil-
ity of time and resource estimates, and identify any potential problems. Meet 
as a group to discuss people’s thoughts and reactions, after they’ve reviewed 
the plan.
Team members who contributed to the proposal can remind themselves of 
the project’s background and purpose, their planned roles, and the work to 
be done. They can also identify situations and circumstances that may have 
changed since the proposal was prepared and then review and reassess proj-
ect risks and risk-management plans.
New team members can understand the project’s background and purpose, 
find out about their roles and assignments, raise concerns about time frames 
and budgets, and identify issues that may affect the project’s success.

228
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
Developing team and individual goals
Team members commit to your project when they believe their participa-
tion can help them achieve worthwhile professional and personal goals. Help 
team members develop and buy into a shared sense of the project goals by 
doing the following:
 
✓ Discuss the reasons for the project, its supporters, and the impact of its 
results. (See Chapter 2 for a discussion of how to identify the needs your 
project will address.)
 
✓ Clarify how the results may benefit your organization’s clients.
 
✓ Emphasize how the results may support your organization’s growth and 
viability.
 
✓ Explore how the results may impact each team member’s job.
 
Encourage people to think about how their participation may help them 
achieve personal goals, such as acquiring new skills and knowledge, meeting 
new people, increasing their visibility in the organization, and enhancing their 
opportunities for job advancement. Obviously, projects aren’t only about 
helping team members achieve personal benefits. However, when team mem-
bers can realize personal benefits while performing valued services for the 
organization, the members’ motivation and commitment to project success 
will be greater. (See Chapter 14 for more on how to create and sustain team 
member motivation.)
Specifying team member roles
Nothing causes disillusionment and frustration faster than bringing moti-
vated people together and then giving them no guidance on working with 
one another. Two or more people may start doing the same activity indepen-
dently, and other activities may be overlooked entirely. Eventually, these 
people find tasks that don’t require coordination, or they gradually withdraw 
from the project to work on more rewarding assignments.
To prevent this frustration from becoming a part of your project, work with 
team members to define the activities that each member works on and the 
nature of their roles. Possible team member roles include the following:
 
✓ Primary responsibility: Has the overall obligation to ensure the comple-
tion of an activity
 
✓ Secondary or supporting responsibility: Has the obligation to complete 
part of an activity
 
✓ Approval: Must approve the results of an activity before work can proceed

229
 Chapter 11: Starting Your Project Team Off on the Right Foot
 
✓ Consultation resource: Can provide expert guidance and support if 
needed
 
✓ Required recipient of project results: Receives either a physical prod-
uct from an activity or a report of an activity
 
If you prepared a Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) as part of your 
project plan, use it to start your discussions of project roles with your team 
members (see Chapter 10 for more on how to use the RAM). Make sure you 
don’t just present the RAM; take the time to encourage questions and con-
cerns from team members until they’re comfortable that the roles are feasible 
and appropriate.
Defining your team’s operating processes
Develop the procedures that you and your team will use to support your day-
to-day work. Having these procedures in place allows people to effectively 
and efficiently perform their tasks; it also contributes to a positive team 
atmosphere. At a minimum, develop procedures for the following:
 
✓ Communication: These processes involve sharing project-related infor-
mation in writing and through personal interactions. Communication 
procedures may include
 
• When and how to use e-mail to share project information
 
• Which types of information should be in writing
 
• When and how to document informal discussions
 
• How to set up regularly scheduled reports and meetings to record 
and review progress
 
• How to address special issues that arise
 
✓ Conflict resolution: These processes involve resolving differences 
of opinion between team members regarding project work. You can 
develop the following conflict-resolution procedures:
 
• Standard approaches (normal steps that you take to encourage 
people to develop a mutually agreeable solution)
 
• Escalation procedures (steps you take if the people involved can’t 
readily resolve their differences)
 
✓ Decision making: These processes involve deciding among alterna-
tive approaches and actions. Develop guidelines for choosing the most 
appropriate choice for a situation, including consensus, majority rule, 
unanimous agreement, and decision by technical expert. Also develop 
escalation procedures — the steps you take when the normal decision-
making approaches get bogged down.

230
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
Supporting the development of 
team member relationships
On high-performance project teams, members trust each other and have cor-
dial, coordinated working relationships. But, developing trust and effective 
work practices takes time and concerted effort.
 
Help your team members get to know and be comfortable with one another as 
soon as your project starts by encouraging them to do the following:
 
✓ Work through conflicts together.
 
✓ Brainstorm challenging technical and administrative issues.
 
✓ Spend informal personal time together, such as having lunch or partici-
pating in non-work-related activities after hours.
All together now: Helping your team 
become a smooth-functioning unit
When team members trust each other, have confidence in each other’s abili-
ties, can count on each other’s promises, and communicate openly, they can 
devote all their efforts to performing their project work instead of spending 
their time dealing with interpersonal frustrations. Help your team achieve 
this high-performance level of functioning by guiding them through the fol-
lowing stages:
 
✓ Forming: This stage involves identifying and meeting team members 
and politely discussing project objectives, work assignments, and so 
forth. Share the project plan, introduce people to each other, and dis-
cuss each person’s background, organizational responsibilities, and 
areas of expertise.
 
✓ Storming: This stage involves raising and resolving personal conflicts 
about the project or other team members. As part of the storming stage, 
do the following:
 
• Encourage people to discuss any concerns they have about the 
project plan’s feasibility, and be sure you address those concerns.
 
• Encourage people to discuss any reservations they may have 
about other team members or team members’ abilities.
 
• Focus these discussions on ways to ensure successful task perfor-
mance — you don’t want the talks to turn into unproductive per-
sonal attacks.

231
 Chapter 11: Starting Your Project Team Off on the Right Foot
 
 You can initially speak privately with people about issues you’re uncom-
fortable bringing up in front of the entire team. Eventually, though, you 
must discuss their concerns with the entire team to achieve a sense of 
mutual honesty and trust.
 
✓ Norming: This stage involves developing the standards and operating 
guidelines that govern team member behavior. Encourage members to 
establish these team norms instead of relying on the procedures and 
practices they use in their functional areas. Examples of these norms 
include the following:
 
• How people present and discuss different points of view: Some 
people present points of view politely, while others aggressively 
debate their opponents in an attempt to prove their points.
 
• Timeliness of meeting attendance: Some people always show up 
for meetings on time, while others are habitually 15 minutes late.
 
• Participation in meetings: Some people sit back and observe, 
while others actively participate and share their ideas.
 
 At a team meeting, encourage people to discuss how team members 
should behave in different situations. Address the concerns people 
express, and encourage the group to adopt team norms.
 
✓ Performing: This stage involves doing project work, monitoring sched-
ules and budgets, making necessary changes, and keeping people 
informed.
 
As you guide your team through these developmental stages, keep in mind the 
following guidelines:
 
✓ Your team won’t automatically pass through these stages; you have 
to guide them. Left on their own, teams often fail to move beyond the 
forming stage. Many people don’t like to confront thorny interpersonal 
issues, so they simply ignore them. Your job is to make sure your team 
members address what needs to be addressed and become a smooth-
functioning team.
 
✓ Your involvement as project manager in your team’s development 
needs to be heavier in the early stages and lighter in the later ones. 
During the forming stage, you need to take the lead as new people join 
the team. Then, in the storming stage, you take a strong facilitative role 
as you guide and encourage people to share their feelings and concerns. 
Although you can help guide the team as it develops its standards and 
norms during the norming stage, your main emphasis is to ensure that 
everyone participates in the process. Finally, if you’ve navigated the first 
three stages successfully, you can step back in the performing stage and 
offer your support as the team demonstrates its ability to function as a 
high-performing unit.

232
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
 
✓ On occasion, you may have to revisit a stage you thought the team had 
completed. For example, a new person may join the team, or a major 
aspect of the project plan may change.
 
✓ If everything goes smoothly on your project, it doesn’t matter whether 
the team has successfully gone through the forming, storming, and 
norming stages. But when the project runs into problems, your team 
may become dysfunctional if it hasn’t progressed successfully through 
each stage. Suppose, for example, that the team misses a major proj-
ect deadline. If team members haven’t developed mutual trust for one 
another, they’re more likely to spend time searching for someone to 
blame than working together to fix the situation.
 
✓ As the project manager, you need to periodically assess how the team feels 
it’s performing; then you have to decide which, if any, issues the team 
needs to work through. Managing your team is a project in and of itself!
Laying the Groundwork for 
Controlling Your Project
Controlling your project throughout its performance requires that you col-
lect appropriate information, evaluate your performance compared with your 
plan, and share your findings with your project’s audiences. This section 
highlights the steps you take to prepare to collect, analyze, and share this 
information. (See Chapter 12 for full details on maintaining control of your 
project.)
Selecting and preparing 
your tracking systems
Effective project control requires that you have accurate and timely information 
to help you identify problems promptly and take appropriate corrective action. 
This section highlights the information you need and explains how to get it.
Throughout your project, you need to track performance in terms of the 
following:
 
✓ Schedule achievement: The assessment of how well you’re meeting 
established dates
 
✓ Personnel resource use: The levels of effort people are spending on 
their assignments
 
✓ Financial expenditures: The funds you’re spending for project 
resources

233
 Chapter 11: Starting Your Project Team Off on the Right Foot
See Chapter 12 for a detailed discussion of the information systems you can 
use to track your project’s progress.
If you use existing, enterprise-wide information systems to track your proj-
ect’s schedule performance and resource use, set up your project on these 
systems as follows (see Chapter 12 for information on how to decide whether 
to use existing information systems to support your project’s monitoring and 
control):
 
✓ Obtain your official project number. Your project number is the offi-
cial company identifier for your project. All products, activities, and 
resources related to your project are assigned that number. Check with 
your organization’s finance department or project office to find out your 
project’s number, and check with your finance or information technol-
ogy department to determine the steps you must take to set up your 
project on the organization’s financial tracking system, labor recording 
system, and/or activity tracking system.
 
✓ Finalize your project’s Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Have team 
members review your project’s WBS and make any necessary changes 
or additions. Assign identifier codes to all WBS elements. (Check out 
Chapter 4 for a complete explanation of the WBS.)
 
✓ Set up charge codes for your project on the organization’s labor track-
ing system. If team members record their labor hours by projects, set 
up charge codes for all WBS activities. Doing so allows you to monitor 
the progress of individual WBS elements, as well as the total project.
 
 If your organization’s system can limit the number of hours for each 
activity, enter those limits (see the “Setting your project’s baseline” sec-
tion later in this chapter and the information in Chapter 12 for how to 
establish your project’s schedule, resource, and budget targets). Doing 
so ensures that people don’t mistakenly charge more hours to activities 
than your plan allows.
 
✓ Set up charge codes for your project on your organization’s financial 
system. If your organization tracks expenditures by project, set up the 
codes for all WBS activities that have expenditures. If the system can 
limit expenditures for each activity, enter those limits.
Establishing schedules for 
reports and meetings
To be sure you satisfy your information needs and those of your project’s 
audiences, set up a schedule of reports you’ll prepare and meetings you’ll 
hold during the project. Planning your communications with your audiences 
in advance helps ensure that you adequately meet their individual needs and 
allows them to reserve time on their calendars to attend the meetings.

234
Part III: Group Work: Putting Your Team Together 
Meet with project audiences and team members to develop a schedule for 
regular project meetings and progress reports. Confirm the following details:
 
✓ Reports that will be issued
 
✓ Meetings that will be held and their specific purposes
 
✓ When reports will be issued and when meetings will be held
 
✓ Who will receive the reports and attend the meetings
 
✓ The formats and content of the reports and meetings
See Chapter 13 for a discussion of the reports and meetings you can use to 
support ongoing project communications.
Setting your project’s baseline
 
The project baseline is the version of your project’s plan that guides your 
project activities and provides the comparative basis for your performance 
assessments. At the beginning of your project, use the plan that was approved 
at the end of the organizing and preparing stage, modified by any approved 
changes made during the carrying out the work stage, as your baseline (see 
Chapter 1 for a discussion of the project life cycle stages). During the project, 
use the most recent approved version of the project plan as your baseline. 
(See Chapter 12 for more discussion on setting, updating, and using your proj-
ect’s baseline to control your project.)
Hear Ye, Hear Ye! Announcing 
Your Project
After you’ve notified your key project audiences (that is, the drivers and sup-
porters) that your project has been approved and when it’ll start, it’s time to 
introduce it to others who may be interested (see Chapter 3 for a discussion of 
how to identify the observers in your project’s audience). Consider one or more 
of the following approaches to announce your project to all interested parties:
 
✓ An e-mail to selected individuals or departments in your organization
 
✓ An announcement in your organization’s newsletter
 
✓ A flyer on a prominent bulletin board
 
✓ A formal kickoff meeting (if your project is large or will have broad orga-
nizational impact)
 
✓ A press release (if your project has stakeholders outside your organization)

235
 Chapter 11: Starting Your Project Team Off on the Right Foot
 
Regardless of how you announce your project, be sure to mention the purpose 
and scope of your project, your intended outcomes and results, and the key 
dates. Tell people how they can get in touch with you if they have questions 
or would like detailed information.
Setting the Stage for Your 
Post-Project Evaluation
 
A post-project evaluation (which I describe in detail in Chapter 15) is a meeting 
in which you
 
✓ Review the experience you have gained from the project.
 
✓ Recognize people for their achievements.
 
✓ Plan to ensure that good practices are repeated on future projects.
 
✓ Plan to head off problems you encountered on this project on future 
projects.
Start laying groundwork as soon as your project begins to ensure you cap-
ture all relevant information and observations about the project to discuss 
at the post-project evaluation meeting. You can lay the groundwork for the 
post-project evaluation by doing the following:
 
✓ Tell the team you’ll hold a post-project review when the project ends.
 
✓ Encourage team members to keep records of problems, ideas, and sug-
gestions throughout the project. When you prepare the final agenda for 
the post-project evaluation session, ask people to review these records 
and notes to find topics to discuss.
 
✓ Clarify the criteria that define your project’s success by reviewing the 
latest version of your project’s objectives with team members.
 
✓ Describe the details of the situation your project is designed to address 
before you begin the project work (if the project was designed to change 
or improve a situation). Doing so enables you to assess the changes in 
these details when the project ends.
 
✓ Maintain your own project log (a narrative record of project issues and 
occurrences), and encourage other team members to do the same.

agement requires that you start off strong, keep moving in 
the right direction, and make necessary changes to your 
plan in a timely manner along the way.
In this part, I discuss different information systems you 
can use to monitor your project’s performance and expen-
ditures. I show you ways to track, analyze, and report on 
project activities, and I discuss techniques to sustain 
team members’ focus and commitment. Finally, I suggest 
steps to bring your project to a successful close and ways 
to plan and conduct a post-project evaluation.

▶ Formulating and taking corrective actions
▶ Managing changes responsibly
A
 sad reality for many projects is that although they’re born accompa-
nied by high hopes and expectations, they die amid frustration and dis-
appointment. Your project plans represent visions that you believe will work; 
however, those plans don’t implement themselves automatically, and they 
can’t predict the future with certainty.
Successful projects require continued care and management to ensure that 
they follow their plans correctly and, in turn, produce the desired results. 
When unexpected situations occur, you, as the project manager, must react 
promptly to adjust your efforts and keep your project on track.
This chapter discusses the steps in the project control process and focuses 
on the systems and techniques you can use to collect, analyze, and report on 
schedule performance, labor hours, and expenditures, as well as the process 
for taking corrective actions when needed.
Holding On to the Reins: Project Control
 
Project control entails the following activities, which you perform through-
out your project to ensure that it proceeds according to plan and produces 

240
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
the desired results (see the appendix for a flowchart illustrating the cyclical 
nature of project control):
 
✓ Reconfirming the plan: At the beginning of each performance period, 
reaffirm with team members the following project responsibilities and 
commitments they made for the coming period:
 
• Activities they agreed to perform
 
• Dates they agreed they will start and end these activities
 
• Amount of person-effort they agreed they’ll need to perform these 
activities (see Chapter 6 for information on estimating this effort)
 
✓ Assessing performance: During the performance period, have team 
members record information on the following:
 
• Completed intermediate and final deliverables
 
• Dates they reached milestones
 
• Dates they started and ended activities
 
• Number of hours they worked on each activity
 
• Amount of nonpersonnel resources they used for each activity
 
• Expenditures they made for each activity
 
 Collect this information at the end of the performance period, compare 
it with the plan, and determine the reasons for any differences.
 
✓ Taking corrective action: If necessary, take steps to bring your project’s 
performance back into conformance with your plans, or if doing so isn’t 
possible, change the plans to reflect new expectations.
 
✓ Keeping people informed: Share your achievements, problems, and 
future plans with your project’s audiences. (See Chapter 13 for sugges-
tions on how to do so.)
 
Choose the periods for monitoring your project’s performance based on the 
overall length of the project, the risk of unexpected occurrences, and your 
proximity to major milestones. Although you may choose to monitor selected 
project activities on a daily basis in certain situations, plan to assess your 
project’s overall performance at least once a month to identify promptly any 
unexpected occurrences or performance problems that must be addressed.
Initially, you may be uncomfortable reconfirming commitments people have 
made for an upcoming performance period because you feel doing so
 
✓ Suggests that you don’t trust the person. After all, the person has made 
a commitment to do the specified work; wouldn’t she tell you if she were 
unable to live up to that commitment?

241
 Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control
 
✓ Increases the likelihood that she’ll say she can’t live up to the original 
promise. You’re concerned that raising the topic may actually encour-
age her to say she can’t honor her commitments.
In most cases, however, neither situation proves to be true. Why? Because of 
the following two reasons:
 
✓ Raising the issue doesn’t suggest a lack of trust; if you didn’t trust the 
person, you wouldn’t talk with her at all! Checking in with her reflects 
your understanding that she may not have had a chance to tell you about 
new circumstances that make it difficult to honor her commitments.
 
✓ Raising the issue doesn’t increase the chances that she’ll opt out of a 
commitment — it buys you time. If the person can’t perform accord-
ing to her promises, you’ll find that out at the end of the performance 
period anyway — when she hasn’t finished the work. So taking time to 
reconfirm actually provides an entire performance period to develop 
alternative ways of dealing with her new restrictions.
 
When a person reaffirms her existing commitments for the upcoming perfor-
mance period, the chances are greater that she’ll perform her assignments 
successfully, on time, and within budget. If she’s unable to honor the com-
mitments she made previously (for example, if she has unexpectedly been 
assigned to work on another high-priority effort during the same time period), 
you can work with her to develop new plans for how and when she will com-
plete her assignment for your project.
Establishing Project Management 
Information Systems
 
A project management information system (PMIS) is a set of procedures, equip-
ment, and other resources for collecting, analyzing, storing, and reporting 
information that describes project performance. A PMIS contains the following 
three parts:
 
✓ Inputs: Raw data that describe selected aspects of project performance
 
✓ Processes: Analyses of the data to compare actual performance with 
planned performance
 
✓ Outputs: Reports presenting the results of the analyses
In addition to requiring that you define the data, designing a PMIS also 
requires that you specify how to collect the data, who collects it, when they 

242
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
collect it, and how they enter the data into the system. All these factors can 
affect the timeliness and accuracy of the data and, therefore, of your project 
performance assessments.
To support your ongoing management and control of the project, you need 
to collect and maintain information about schedule performance, work effort, 
and expenditures. The following sections tell you how to collect, analyze, and 
report on these three parts of your project’s performance.
 
Many information systems have the technical support of computers, scan-
ners, printers, and plotters. But an information system can consist of manual 
processes and physical storage devices, as well. For example, you can record 
project activities in your notebook or calendar and keep records of project 
budgets in your file cabinet. However, you still need to monitor your proce-
dures for collecting, storing, analyzing, and reporting your information; they 
affect the accuracy and timeliness of your performance assessments.
The clock’s ticking: Monitoring 
schedule performance
Regularly monitoring your project’s schedule performance can provide early 
indications of possible activity-coordination problems, resource conflicts, 
and cost overruns that may occur in the future. The following sections show 
you what information you need to monitor schedule performance, how to col-
lect and evaluate it, and how to ensure its accuracy.
Defining the schedule data to collect
As I discuss in further detail in Chapter 4, your project’s Work Breakdown 
Structure (WBS) is a deliverable-oriented decomposition of the work required 
to produce your project’s deliverables. The lowest level of detail of each 
branch of the WBS is a work package, and each work package, in turn, is com-
posed of activities (pieces of work performed during the project).
You can describe an activity’s schedule performance either by noting the 
dates it began and ended or by describing how much of it has been done.
If you choose to describe your project’s schedule performance by noting 
the status of individual activities, collect either or both of the following data 
items to support your analyses:
 
✓ The start and end dates for each activity in your project
 
✓ The dates when milestones (such as contract signed, materials received, 
or environmental test completed) are reached (see Chapter 5 for more 
information about milestones)

243
 Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control
 
Be careful if you decide to use percent completed to indicate an activity’s prog-
ress, because most often you have no clear way to determine this percentage. 
For example, saying that your new product design is 30 percent complete is 
virtually meaningless because you can’t determine objectively how much of 
the thinking and creating is actually done. Suggesting that you have completed 
30 percent of your design because you have expended 30 of the 100 hours 
budgeted for the task or because three of the ten days allotted for its perfor-
mance have passed is equally incorrect. The first indicator is a measure of 
resource use, and the second is a measure of time elapsed. Neither measure 
indicates the amount of substantive work completed.
On the other hand, if your activity has clear segments that take roughly the 
same amount of time and effort, you may be able to determine an accurate 
measure of percent completed. For example, if you planned to conduct tele-
phone interviews with 20 different people and you have completed 10, you 
can argue that the activity is 50 percent complete.
Analyzing schedule performance
Assess your project’s schedule status by comparing actual activity start/end 
dates and actual milestone dates to their planned dates. Figures 12-1 and 12-2 
present formats that support ready comparisons of this data.
Figure 12-1 depicts a combined activities and milestones report. The following 
information in this report comes from your project plan:
 
✓ The activity or milestone identification code and name
 
✓ The person responsible for ensuring the activity or milestone occurs
 
✓ The dates the activity should start and end or the milestone should 
occur
Compare this information with the following data to describe performance 
during the period of the report:
 
✓ The actual activity start and end dates or the actual milestone date
 
✓ Relevant comments about the activity or milestone
Figure 12-2 illustrates a progress Gantt chart. You shade an appropriate por-
tion of each bar to represent deliverable progress (see Chapter 5 for more 
information about Gantt charts). This sample chart presents project per-
formance as of the end of week 4 of the project. According to the chart, the 
design phase is complete, the development phase is one week behind sched-
ule, and the testing phase is one week ahead of schedule.

Date
The most meaningful way to assess progress on a WBS component is to note 
the component’s intermediate deliverables that you’ve achieved to date. The 
progress Gantt chart in Figure 12-2 really says that, by the end of week 4, you 
produced all the intermediate deliverables for Task 3.0 — development — 
that you had planned to produce by the end of week 3 or that Task 3.0 is one 
week behind schedule.

245
 Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control
Note: You can prepare these project schedule reports with any level of detail 
you choose, depending on your audiences’ interests and needs. This higher-
level report presents information for four-week portions of project work, but 
the detailed data used to determine the status of these four-week portions of 
work was for activities that were two weeks or less.
 
Not everyone interprets a progress Gantt chart the same way. I intended the 
chart to suggest that Task 3.0 is one week behind schedule. However, some 
people have told me that they interpret the report to mean Task 3.0 is 25 per-
cent complete because one of the four segments for Task 3.0 is shaded. The 
message is: Be sure you include a legend with your graph that explains clearly 
how you want people to interpret it.
Collecting schedule performance data
To collect the schedule performance data, develop a standard format and 
process for recording your work accomplishments. Standard formats and 
processes improve the accuracy of your information and take less time to 
complete. I frequently use the combined activities and milestones report 
format.
 
Consider the following factors when you schedule your activity monitoring:
 
✓ Is the activity on a critical path? Delayed activities on a critical path 
will delay your overall project schedule (see Chapter 5 for a detailed dis-
cussion of critical paths). Therefore, consider monitoring critical-path 
activities more often to identify potential problems as soon as possible 
and minimize their effect on the project schedule.
 
✓ Is the activity on a path that’s close to being critical? Activities on non-
critical paths can have some delays before their paths become critical. 
The maximum delay for noncritical activities is called slack time or float 
(see Chapter 5). If an activity’s slack time is very short, a small delay can 
cause the path to become critical. Therefore, consider monitoring activi-
ties that have very small slack times more often (again to identify poten-
tial problems as soon as possible).
 
✓ Is the activity risk high? If you feel that an activity is very likely to 
encounter problems, consider monitoring it more frequently to identify 
those problems as soon as they occur. (Flip to Chapter 8 for details on 
risk and uncertainty.)
 
✓ Have you already encountered problems with this activity? Consider 
monitoring activities more frequently if you’ve already had problems 
with them. Past problems often increase the chances of future problems.
 
✓ Are you approaching the activity’s planned completion date? Consider 
monitoring activities approaching completion more frequently to ensure 
all final details are addressed and the schedule is met.

246
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
At the beginning of a performance period, I print separate reports for each 
team member that include their planned activities and milestones for the 
period. I ask team members to record actual activity start and end dates and 
actual milestone dates in the appropriate columns, along with any comments 
they want to share. I ask them to send me a copy of the completed report on 
the first business day after the performance period.
Recording and reporting on progress this way has several advantages:
 
✓ Recording achievements at the time they occur increases the likelihood 
that the data are accurate.
 
✓ The agreed-upon submission schedule reduces the chances that I’ll sur-
prise people with unexpected requests for progress data.
 
✓ Having people continuously review their proposed schedules and 
record their accomplishments heightens their awareness of goals and 
increases the chances that they’ll meet their commitments.
 
✓ The purpose of project control is to encourage people to perform 
according to your plan, not just to collect data. The more aware the 
team members are of their work in relation to the overall schedule, the 
greater the likelihood that they’ll hit the schedule. If they don’t know or 
care about the target date, they’re unlikely to hit it.
 
I use the combined activities and milestones report format to reaffirm peo-
ple’s commitments at the start of a performance period. When I give them the 
report detailing their activities and events for the coming period, I ask them to 
verify the information and reaffirm their commitments. Then we immediately 
discuss and resolve any issues they identify.
 
Monitor schedule performance at least once a month. Experience has shown 
that waiting longer does the following:
 
✓ Allows people to lose focus and commitment to the activity and 
increases the chances that the activity won’t end on schedule
 
✓ Provides more time for small problems to go undetected and, thus, 
evolve into bigger problems
Improving the accuracy of your schedule performance data
 
Collecting the right data is the first requirement for effectively controlling 
your project’s schedule. However, your analyses will be meaningless unless 
the data are correct. Do the following to improve the accuracy of your sched-
ule performance data:
 
✓ Tell the team members how you plan to use their schedule perfor-
mance data. People are always more motivated to perform a task if they 
understand the reasons for it.

247
 Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control
 
✓ Provide schedule performance reports to the people who give you the 
data. People are even more motivated to perform a task if they get direct 
benefits from it.
 
✓ Publicly acknowledge those people who give you timely and accurate 
data. Positive reinforcement of desired behavior confirms to people that 
they’re meeting your expectations; it also emphasizes that desirable 
behavior to other people.
 
✓ Clearly define activities and milestones. Clear definitions help you con-
firm when an event or activity does or doesn’t occur.
 
✓ Use all the data that you collect, and don’t collect more data than 
you’ll use. Collect only the data that you know you’ll use to assess 
schedule performance.
Choosing a vehicle to support your schedule tracking system
Check to see whether your organization uses an enterprise-wide project plan-
ning and tracking system. The best places to look for this information are 
your organization’s project management office (PMO), information technol-
ogy department, and finance department (see Chapter 16 for different types 
of software used to support project management). If your organization does 
have such a system, check to see whether you can use it to monitor your 
project, whether it provides the information you need, and whether its infor-
mation is timely and accurate.
If your organization doesn’t have an existing tracking system you can use, 
you need to develop your own. You can use either a manual system or a com-
puter-based system; both offer advantages and disadvantages:
 
✓ Manual tracking systems: These systems include day planners, personal 
calendars, and handwritten project logs. If you use any of these systems 
to record your activities and achievements, you don’t need special com-
puters or software, which may save you money.
 
 However, manual systems have these disadvantages:
 
• Storing your data requires physical space. The more data you 
have, the more space you need.
 
• Comparing and analyzing the data by hand can be time-consuming, 
and the chances for errors are greater.
 
• Preparing reports by hand is time-consuming.
 
✓ Computer-based tracking systems: These systems offer the advantages 
of faster processing, more efficient data storage, and professionally 
designed reports. The following types of software can support a 
computer-based tracking system:
 
• Integrated project-management software, such as Microsoft Project 
and Microsoft Project Server

248
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
• Database software, such as Microsoft Access
 
• Spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel
 
• Word processing software, such as Microsoft Word
 
 However, computer-based systems are more difficult to learn to use, 
more difficult to maintain, and more expensive.
 
 Many manufacturers offer software packages in these categories, 
but more than 80 percent of the organizations I’ve worked with use 
Microsoft software for these functions. Check to see whether this soft-
ware is available on your organization’s local area network (LAN).
All in a day’s work: Monitoring work effort
Comparing work effort expended with work effort planned can highlight 
when people are incorrectly expanding or reducing the scope of an activity, 
are more or less qualified than you anticipated, are encountering unexpected 
difficulties performing the work, or are in danger of using up allocated work 
effort before your project ends.
Monitoring work effort requires that you collect the actual effort spent on 
each WBS work package or activity. In the following sections, I discuss what 
data to collect, how to collect it, how to improve its accuracy, and how to 
analyze it.
Analyzing work effort expended
Evaluate your project’s work-effort expenditures by comparing the actual 
expenditures with those in your plan. Figure 12-3 depicts a typical labor 
report that describes the work effort by each team member on each work 
package. The following information comes from your project plan:
 
✓ The work package identifiers and names
 
✓ The total hours budgeted for each team member to spend on each work 
package
 
✓ The hours budgeted for each team member to spend on each work pack-
age every week
You obtain or derive the following information for the labor report from data 
during the period covered by the report:
 
✓ The number of hours each team member spent on each work package
 
✓ The number of hours left for each team member to spend on each work 
package
 
✓ The difference between the number of hours in the plan and the number 
of hours each team member actually spent on each work package

Actual labor expenditures rarely agree 100 percent with the planned amounts. 
(In fact, if the number of hours for each task each month is identical to the 
number in your plan for several months, you may wonder whether people 
are copying the numbers from the plan onto their time sheets! See the next 
section for more info on time sheets.) Typically, variances of up to 10 percent 
above or below the expected numbers in any month are normal.
Consider the work-effort expenditures for the two team members in the labor 
report in Figure 12-3. Smith appears to be working in accordance with the 
plan. He charged more hours in week 2 than planned, fewer than planned in 
week 3, and the same as planned in week 4. Jones’s situation is very different. 
Each week, Jones spends less time on the project than planned, and the total 
shortfall of hours increases steadily. Whether or not this shortfall indicates 
a problem isn’t clear from the report, but the systematic undercharging does 
point to a situation that needs further investigation.
Collecting work-effort data
Having people fill out time sheets is the most effective way to collect work-
effort expenditure data. You need to include the following information on 
each time sheet (see Figure 12-4 for an example of a typical time sheet):
 
✓ The number of hours a team member worked on each work package 
each day
 
✓ The team member’s signature verifying that the information is correct
 
✓ An approval signature (typically the project manager or someone he 
designates) verifying that the time charges are valid and appropriate

Generally, recording work on activities to the nearest half-hour is sufficient.
Note: Some people may record their time in intervals smaller than half-hours. 
Lawyers, for example, often allocate their time in six-minute segments. Their 
clients would have it no other way — given that a lawyer may charge $300 or 
more per hour!
 
A time log is a form that breaks the day into intervals and enables a team 
member to record the specific activity he worked on in each interval. For 
example, to record time in half-hour intervals for a member who begins work 
at 8:30 a.m., the first interval on the log is 8:30 to 9 a.m., the second is 9 to 9:30 
a.m., and so on.
If team members fill out time logs conscientiously, they provide more-
accurate data because the log allows them to account for every segment of 
the day. However, maintaining a time log is far more time-consuming than 
filling out a time sheet. Normally, recording on a time sheet the total time a 
person spends working on different activities each day is sufficient.
Improving the accuracy of your work-effort data
Just as with schedule performance data, the more accurate your work-effort 
expenditure data are, the more meaningful your analyses will be. Take the fol-
lowing steps to increase the accuracy of the work-effort expenditure data you 
collect:
 
✓ Explain to people that you’re using their labor-effort expenditures to 
help you determine when you may need to change aspects of the plan. 
When you ask people to detail the hours they spend on specific assign-
ments, they often fear that you’ll criticize them for not spending time 

251
 Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control
exactly in accordance with the plan — no matter what the reason — or for 
not spending enough hours on project work as opposed to other adminis-
trative duties. Unfortunately, if they believe these are your motives, they’ll 
allocate their work-hours among activities to reflect what they think you 
want to see instead of what they’re really doing.
 
✓ Encourage people to record the actual hours they work instead of 
making their total hours equal 40 hours per week. If people must 
record a total of 40 hours per week and they work overtime, they’ll omit 
hours here and there or try to reduce them proportionately. You want 
workers to record accurate data.
 
✓ Include categories for time on nonproject activities, such as unal-
located, administrative overhead, and so on. If you want people to 
record their time expenditures honestly, you must provide them with 
appropriate categories.
 
✓ Encourage people to fill out their own time sheets. Some people ask 
a third person, such as a secretary, to fill out time sheets for them. But 
people have a hard enough time remembering what they themselves 
did the past day or the past week; expecting someone else to accurately 
remember it for them is totally unrealistic.
 
✓ Collect time sheets weekly, if possible, or at least once every two 
weeks. No matter how often you ask people to fill out their time sheets, 
many people wait until the sheet is due to complete it. If you collect 
sheets once a month, those people will be sitting there at the end of the 
month trying to remember what they did four weeks ago!
 
✓ Don’t ask people to submit their time sheets before the period is over. 
On occasion, managers ask workers to submit time sheets on Thursday 
for the week ending on Friday. But this practice immediately reduces 
the accuracy of the data because a worker can’t be certain what he’ll do 
tomorrow. More importantly, though, this practice suggests to workers 
that, if guessing at Friday’s allocation is acceptable, maybe they don’t 
have to be too concerned with the accuracy of the rest of the week’s 
data, either.
Choosing a vehicle to support your work-effort tracking system
Before you choose a method for tracking your work effort, check whether 
your organization has a time-recording system in place that can accurately 
record data the way you need it. When assessing an existing time-recording 
system, consider the following:
 
✓ Time-recording systems typically allocate a person’s pay to regular 
work, vacation time, sick leave, and holiday leave. As such, the system 
may require exempt employees (that is, employees who aren’t paid for 
overtime) to record no more than 40 hours per week. Additionally, these 
systems are often unable to track work by detailed WBS categories.

252
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
✓ People are often uncomfortable recording the hours they spend on dif-
ferent assignments because they aren’t sure how the organization will 
use the information.
 
✓ A time-recording system’s standard reports may not present information 
the way you need it to support your work-effort tracking.
If you decide to create your own work-effort recording and storage capability, 
you have to decide whether to develop a manual or computer-based system. 
As you decide, consider the following:
 
✓ Manual systems typically involve having people note in their daily cal-
endars or personal diaries the hours they spent on different activities. 
Unfortunately, data recorded this way are often incomplete and inac-
curate. In addition, you’ll have difficulty pulling the data together to per-
form organized assessments and prepare meaningful reports.
 
✓ You can support a computer-based system with the following software:
 
• Project-management software, such as Microsoft Project
 
• Database software, such as Microsoft Access
 
• Spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel
 
 See Chapter 16 for a discussion of the potential uses and benefits of soft-
ware to support project management.
Follow the money: Monitoring expenditures
You monitor your project’s expenditures to verify that they’re in accordance 
with the project plan and, if they’re not, to address any deviations. You may 
think that you can determine project funds used to date and funds remaining 
just by reading the balance in your project’s financial account (the project’s 
checkbook). However, spending project funds entails several steps before you 
actually pay for an item. After each step, you have a better sense of whether 
you’ll incur the expenditure and, if you do, its exact amount.
The process leading up to and including the disbursement of funds for goods 
and services includes the following steps:
 
1. You include a rough estimate of the item’s cost in your project’s 
budget.
 
 You can develop this rough estimate by using your prior experience, by 
checking with others who have purchased similar items in the past, or by 
checking with your procurement department. Usually, you don’t check 
with specific vendors or supplies when developing this rough estimate.

253
 Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control
 
2. You submit a written, approved request for the item to your procure-
ment department.
 
 This request specifies the rough estimate of the cost included in your 
project budget and any upper limit that the actual cost can’t exceed. 
The project manager or his designee approves it, and anyone else who 
controls the expenditure of project funds (such as the finance depart-
ment) approves it.
 
3. Your procurement department selects a vendor and submits a pur-
chase order.
 
 The purchase order formally requests the vendor to furnish you the 
item and specifies the procurement department’s estimate of the price.
 
4. The vendor agrees to provide the item you requested.
 
 The vendor provides you written confirmation that he will sell you the 
item, together with the item’s price (including applicable taxes and ship-
ping and handling charges) and the projected delivery date.
 
5. You receive and accept the item but aren’t yet billed for it.
 
 You receive the item and verify that it meets the agreed specifications. 
If you don’t accept the item after the vendor makes repeated attempts 
to fix any problems you have with it, your procurement department can-
cels the purchase order and you begin looking for a different vendor or a 
different item that will meet your needs.
 
6. You or your finance department receives a bill for the item.
 
 This bill details the item’s final cost, together with associated discounts, 
taxes, and shipping and handling charges.
 
7. Your finance department disburses funds to pay for the item.
 
 The bill for your item is paid with money from your project’s funds.
Depending on the size of your purchase and the size and formality of your 
organization, you may handle some of these stages informally for some pur-
chases. As you proceed from the first step to the last, your estimate of the 
item’s price becomes more accurate, and the likelihood that you’ll actually 
make the purchase increases.
Responsible project monitoring requires that you have a clear idea of avail-
able project funds at each stage of the process. To do so, you typically want 
to monitor purchase requisitions, purchase orders, commitments (that is, 
purchase orders or contracts that you and the contractor or vendor agreed 
to), accounts payable, and expenditures.
In the following sections, I discuss how to analyze your project’s expendi-
tures, how to get the expenditure data you need for your analyses, and how 
to improve the accuracy of that data.

254
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
Analyzing expenditures
You evaluate your project’s financial performance by comparing actual 
expenditures with those you planned. Figure 12-5 depicts a typical cost 
report that presents expenditures for the current performance period and 
from the beginning of the project for different levels of WBS components. The 
following information in this report comes from your project plan:
 
✓ Identifying codes and names for each WBS component
 
✓ The funds budgeted for each WBS component in the performance period
 
✓ The cumulative funds budgeted to date for each WBS component
 
✓ The total budget for each WBS component
The actual numbers for the period come from the data you obtain during 
that period. Actual in this illustration may mean the value of purchase requi-
sitions, purchase orders, commitments, accounts payable, and/or expendi-
tures. Total remaining funds are the difference between the total budget and 
the actual amounts expended to date.
 
Earned Value Management (EVM) is a method of determining — from resource 
expenditures alone — whether you’re over or under budget and whether 
you’re ahead of or behind schedule. On complex projects, EVM is a useful 
way to identify areas you should investigate for possible current problems or 
potential future problems. See Chapter 17 for further discussion of EVM.

 Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control
Collecting expenditure data and improving its accuracy
Typically, you obtain your expenditure data from purchase requisitions, pur-
chase orders, vendor bills, and written checks. You normally see all purchase 
requisitions because, as the project manager, you probably have to approve 
them. The procurement department typically prepares purchase orders, 
and you may be able to get copies. Vendor bills usually go directly to the 
accounts payable group in the finance department, and these people pay the 
checks. You may be able to have the finance department send copies of bills 
to you to verify the amounts and so forth, and you can request reports of all 
payments from your project’s account if they’re tracked by project code.
 
Do the following to increase the accuracy of your project’s expenditure data:
 
✓ Remove purchase orders from your totals after you receive the bill 
(or verify that payment has been made) to avoid double-counting an 
expenditure.
 
✓ Be sure to include the correct work package charge code on each pur-
chase requisition and purchase order.
 
✓ Periodically remove voided or canceled purchase requisitions and pur-
chase orders from your lists of outstanding documents.
Choosing a vehicle to support your expenditure tracking system
Before developing your own system to monitor your project’s expendi-
tures, first check the nature and capabilities of your organization’s financial 
tracking system. Most organizations have a financial system that maintains 
records of all expenditures. Often the system also maintains records of 
accounts payable. Unfortunately, many financial systems categorize expenses 
by cost center but don’t have the capacity to classify expenses by project or 
WBS component within a project.
If you have to develop your own system for tracking project expenditures, 
consider using the following types of software:
 
✓ Integrated project-management software, such as Microsoft Project
 
✓ Accounting software, such as QuickBooks
 
✓ Database software, such as Microsoft Access
 
✓ Spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel
See Chapter 16 for more information on the potential uses and benefits of 
software to support project management.

256
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
Even if your organization’s financial system can classify expenditures by work 
package within a project, you’ll probably have to develop your own system for 
tracking purchase requisitions and purchase orders. Consider using a spread-
sheet program or database software to support this tracking.
Putting Your Control Process into Action
The first part of this chapter tells you how to set up the systems that provide 
you the necessary information to guide your project. This section tells you 
how to use those systems to consistently monitor and guide your project’s 
performance.
Heading off problems before they occur
Great project plans often fall by the wayside when well-intentioned people 
try to achieve the best-possible results on their own. They may spend more 
hours than the plan allowed for, hoping the additional work can produce 
better results. They may ask people who weren’t in the original plan to work 
on the project or spend more money for an item than the budget allowed, 
believing these choices will result in higher-quality outcomes.
If possible at the start of your project, set up procedures that prevent people 
from exceeding established budgets without prior approval. For example, if 
people record the number of hours they spend on each project activity
 
✓ Confirm with them the maximum number of hours they may charge to 
each activity before they start it.
 
✓ Arrange for the time-recording system to reject attempts to charge more 
hours than planned for an activity unless the person has your prior writ-
ten approval.
 
✓ Arrange for the time-recording system to reject any project hours 
charged by unauthorized people.
For purchases of equipment, materials, supplies, and services
 
✓ Confirm anticipated purchases, the upper limits for cost of individual 
items (if any), and the upper limit on the total expenditures.
 
✓ Arrange for the procurement office or financial system to reject attempts 
to overspend these limits without your prior written approval.
 
A change to your project’s budget may be necessary and desirable. However, 
you want to make that decision with full awareness of the change’s effect on 
other aspects of the project.

257
 Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control
Formalizing your control process
To guide your project throughout its performance, establish procedures to 
collect and submit required progress data, to assess work and results, to 
take corrective actions when needed, and to keep audiences informed of your 
project’s status. Follow these procedures throughout your project’s life by 
doing the following:
 
1. At the start of a performance period, reconfirm with people their com-
mitments and your expectations.
 
 See the earlier section “Holding On to the Reins: Project Control” for 
more details on how to do so.
 
2. During the performance period, have people record schedule perfor-
mance data, work effort, and any purchase requisitions and purchase 
orders they issue.
 
 See the earlier sections “Collecting schedule performance data,” 
“Collecting work-effort data,” and “Collecting expenditure data and 
improving its accuracy” for more details.
 
3. At agreed-upon intervals during or at the end of the performance 
period, have people submit their activity performance, expenditures, 
and work-effort data either to all relevant organizational systems or to 
systems specially maintained for your project.
 
4. At the end of the performance period, enter people’s tracking data 
into the appropriate PMIS, compare actual performance for the period 
with planned performance, identify any problems, formulate and take 
corrective actions, and keep people informed.
 
 See the later sections “Identifying possible causes of delays and vari-
ances,” “Identifying possible corrective actions,” and “Getting back on 
track: Rebaselining” for more details.
 
5. At the beginning of the next performance period, start these steps 
again.
 
Monitoring project performance doesn’t identify problems; it identifies symp-
toms. When you identify a symptom, you must investigate the situation to 
determine the nature of any underlying problems, the reasons for the prob-
lems, and ways to fix them. But you can’t get an accurate picture of where 
your project stands by monitoring only one or two aspects of your project. 
You must consider your project’s performance in all three of its dimensions — 
outcomes produced, activity time frames, and resources used — together to 
determine the reasons for any inconsistencies you identify.
Suppose a member of your project team spent half as much time working on 
a project activity during the period as you had planned. Does this discrep-
ancy mean you have a problem? You really can’t tell. If the person reached all 
her planned milestones and the quality of her deliverables met the established 

258
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
standards, perhaps you don’t have a problem. However, if she didn’t reach 
some milestones or the quality of her deliverables was subpar, a problem 
may exist. You must consider product quality and schedule achievement 
together with the discrepancy between planned and actual work-hours to 
determine whether your project actually has a problem.
Identifying possible causes 
of delays and variances
After you confirm that a problem exists, you have to understand what caused 
the problem before you can bring your project back on track. The following 
circumstances may cause schedule delays:
 
✓ During the performance period, people spend less time on the activity 
than they agreed to.
 
✓ The activity requires more work effort than you planned.
 
✓ People are expanding the scope of the activity without the necessary 
reviews and approvals.
 
✓ Completing the activity requires steps you didn’t identify in your plan.
 
✓ The people working on the activity have less experience with similar 
activities than you anticipated.
The following situations may result in people charging more or less time to 
activities than you planned:
 
✓ The person is more or less productive than you assumed when you 
developed the plan (see Chapter 6 for a discussion of productivity).
 
✓ You allowed insufficient time for becoming familiar with the activity 
before starting to work on it.
 
✓ The person is more or less efficient than you considered (see Chapter 6 
for a discussion of efficiency).
 
✓ The activity requires more or less work than you anticipated.
You may spend more or less money on your project activities than you 
planned for the following reasons:
 
✓ You receive the bills for goods or services later than you planned, so 
they’re paid later than you planned.
 
✓ You prepay for certain items to receive special discounts.
 
✓ You don’t need certain goods or services that you budgeted for in your plan.
 
✓ You need goods or services that you didn’t budget for in your plan.

259
 Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control
Identifying possible corrective actions
When your project’s performance deviates from your plan, first try to bring 
your project back in accordance with the existing plan. Then, if necessary, 
investigate the option of formally changing some of the commitments in the 
existing plan to create a new plan.
 
Consider the following approaches for bringing a project back in line with its 
existing plan:
 
✓ If the variance results from a one-time occurrence, see whether it will 
disappear on its own. Suppose you planned to spend 40 person-hours 
searching for and buying a piece of equipment, but you actually spent 10 
person-hours because you found exactly what you wanted for the price 
you wanted to pay at the first store. Don’t immediately change your plan 
to reallocate the 30 person-hours you saved on this activity. Most likely, 
you’ll wind up overspending slightly on some future activities, and the 
work-effort expenditures will even each other out.
 
✓ If the variance suggests a situation that will lead to similar variances 
in the future, consider changing your plan to prevent the future vari-
ances from occurring. Suppose a team member requires twice the allot-
ted work effort to finish her assignment because she’s less experienced 
than the plan anticipated. If her lack of experience will cause her to be 
less productive on future assignments, revise the plan for her to spend 
more effort on those assignments. (See Chapter 5 for information on 
how to reduce the time it takes to complete a project and Chapter 6 for a 
discussion of how to modify personnel assignments.)
Getting back on track: Rebaselining
 
Your project’s baseline is the current version of your project plan that guides 
project performance and provides a standard against which to compare your 
actual project performance. Rebaselining is officially adopting a new project 
plan to guide activities and serve as the comparative basis for future perfor-
mance assessments.
If you think adopting a new baseline is necessary, do the following:
 
✓ Consult with key project audiences to explain why the changes are nec-
essary and to solicit the audiences’ approval and support.
 
✓ Make sure all key project audiences know about the new baseline.
 
✓ Keep a copy of your original plan and all subsequent modifications to 
support your final performance assessment when the project is over.

260
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
Rebaselining is a last resort when project work isn’t going according to plan. 
Exhaust all possible strategies to get back on track before you attempt to 
change the plan itself. (Chapter 5 has information about changing the order 
and duration of activities to make up for unexpected delays; Chapter 6 has 
details on reallocating work effort to activities.)
Reacting Responsibly When 
Changes Are Requested
No matter how carefully you plan, occurrences you don’t anticipate will most 
likely happen at one point or another during your project. Perhaps an activ-
ity turns out to be more involved than you figured, your client’s needs and 
desires change, or new technology evolves. When these types of situations 
arise, you may need to modify your project plan to respond to them.
Even though change may be necessary and desirable, it always comes at a 
price. Furthermore, different people may have different opinions about which 
changes are important and how to implement them.
This section helps you manage changes in your project. It provides some 
helpful steps to follow when considering and acting on a change request. It 
also looks at gradual and unapproved project expansion and steps you can 
take to avoid it.
Responding to change requests
On large projects, formal change-control systems govern how you can 
receive, assess, and act on requests for changes. But whether you handle 
change requests formally or informally, always follow these steps:
 
1. When you receive a request for change to some aspect of your project, 
clarify exactly what the request is asking you to do.
 
2. If possible, ask for the request in writing or confirm your understand-
ing of the request by writing it down yourself.
 
 In a formal change-control system, people must submit every request for 
change on a change-request form.
 
3. Assess the change’s potential effects on all aspects of your project.
 
 Also consider what may happen if you don’t make the change.
 
4. Decide whether you’ll implement the change.
 
 If this change affects other people, involve them in the decision, too.

261
 Chapter 12: Tracking Progress and Maintaining Control
 
5. If you decide not to make the change, tell the requester and explain 
the reason(s).
 
6. If you decide to make the change, write down the necessary steps to 
implement the change.
 
 In a formal change-control system, all aspects of a change are detailed in 
a written change order.
 
7. Update your project’s plan to reflect any adjustments in schedules, 
outcomes, or resource budgets as a result of the change.
 
8. Tell team members and appropriate audiences about the change and 
the effect you expect it to have on your project.
 
Observe the following guidelines to ensure that you can smoothly incorporate 
changes into your project:
 
✓ Don’t use the possibility of changes as an excuse for not being thor-
ough in your original planning. Make your project plan as accurate and 
complete as possible to reduce the need for future changes.
 
✓ Remember that change always has a cost. Don’t ignore that cost, fig-
uring you have to make the change anyway. Determine the cost of the 
change so you can plan for it and, if possible, minimize it.
 
✓ Assess the effect of change on all aspects of your project. Maintain 
a broad perspective — a change early in your project may affect your 
project from beginning to end.
Creeping away from scope creep
 
Scope creep is the gradual expansion of project work without formal consider-
ation and acceptance of these changes or their associated costs and effects. 
Scope creep can occur as a result of any of the following:
 
✓ Lack of clarity and detail in the original description of project scope, 
objectives, and work
 
✓ Willingness to modify a project without formal review and approval
 
✓ Allowing people who don’t do the work associated with the changes to 
decide whether to make changes
 
✓ Feeling that you should never say “No” to a client
 
✓ Personal pride that encourages you to believe you can do anything

262
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
Control scope creep by doing the following:
 
✓ Include detailed descriptions of all project objectives in your plan.
 
✓ Always assess the effect of requested changes on project products, 
schedules, and resources.
 
✓ Share your true feelings about whether you can implement the 
requested changes.
 
✓ Develop honest and open relationships with your clients so they’re more 
receptive when you raise issues associated with their requested changes.

magine standing at one end of a large room filled with assorted sofas, 
chairs, and tables. You’ve accepted a challenge to walk to the other end 
without bumping into any of the furniture. But, as you set off on your excur-
sion, the lights go off, and you now have to complete your trip in total dark-
ness, with only your memory of the room’s layout to guide you.
Sounds like a pretty tough assignment, doesn’t it? How much easier it would 
be if the lights went on every few seconds — you could see exactly where 
you were, where you had to go, and where the furniture got in the way. The 
walk would still be challenging, but it would be much more successful than in 
total darkness.
Surprisingly, many projects are just like that walk across the room. People 
plan how they’ll perform the project — who will do what, by when, and for 
how much — and they share this information with the team members and 
other people who will support the project. But as soon as the project work 
begins, people receive no information about their progress, the work remain-
ing, or obstacles that may lie ahead.
Effective communication — sharing the right messages with the right people 
in a timely manner — is a key to successful projects. Informative communica-
tions support the following:
 
✓ Continued buy in and support from key audiences and team members
 
✓ Prompt problem identification and decision making
 
✓ A clear project focus
 
✓ Ongoing recognition of project achievements
 
✓ Productive working relationships among team members

264
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
Planning your project communications upfront enables you to choose the 
appropriate media for sharing different messages. This chapter can help you 
keep everyone in the loop so no one’s left wondering what your project’s 
status is.
I Said What I Meant and I Meant What I 
Said: Successful Communication Basics
Have you ever played the game of telephone with a group of people sitting 
around a table? The first person at the table has a written message, and the 
object of the game is for the group to transmit that message accurately to 
the last person at the table by having each person in turn whisper the con-
tents of the message to the next person in line. The rules are simple — no 
one other than the first person can see the original written message, and 
each person must ensure that only the next in line hears the message that’s 
whispered to him or her. Invariably, the message received by the last person 
bears little, if any, resemblance to the original message because, even in this 
controlled setting, a myriad of factors influence how well people send and 
receive messages.
Sadly, sometimes this type of miscommunication can occur in a project-
management environment. But don’t worry! This section is here to help. It 
explores important parts of the communication process, distinguishes differ-
ent types of communication, and offers suggestions to improve the chances 
that the message a receiver gets is the one the sender intended to give.
Breaking down the communication process
 
Communication is the transmitting of information from a sender to a receiver. 
Whenever you communicate, during the life of a project or at any other time, 
your goal is to ensure that the right person correctly receives your intended 
message in a timely manner.
 
The process of transmitting information includes the following components:
 
✓ Message: The thoughts or ideas being transmitted
 
✓ Sender: The person transmitting the message
 
✓ Encoded message: The message translated into a language understand-
able to others (This language may consist of words, pictures, or actions.)
 
✓ Medium: The method used to convey the message (I discuss different 
mediums in detail in the “Choosing the Appropriate Medium for Project 
Communication” section later in this chapter.)

265
 Chapter 13: Keeping Everyone Informed
 
✓ Noise: Anything that hinders successfully transmitting the message 
(Noise may include preconceived notions, biases, difficulty with the lan-
guage used, personal feelings, nonverbal cues, and emotions.)
 
✓ Receiver: The person getting the message
 
✓ Decoded message: The message translated back into thoughts or ideas
Depending on the nature of a particular communication, any or all of these 
elements can affect the chances that a message is received as intended.
Distinguishing one-way and 
two-way communication
Certain types of communication are more effective for transmitting particular 
types of information. The two main types are one-way and two-way:
 
✓ One-way communication: Going from the sender to the receiver with no 
opportunity for clarification or confirmation that the receiver got and 
correctly understood the intended message. This type of communica-
tion can be effective for presenting facts, confirming actions, and shar-
ing messages that have little chance of being misinterpreted.
 
 One-way communications are either:
 
• Push: Proactively distributed to particular people; examples 
include memos, reports, letters, faxes, and e-mails
 
• Pull: Available to people who must access the communications 
themselves; examples include Internet and intranet sites, knowl-
edge repositories, and bulletin boards
 
✓ Two-way communication: Going from the sender to the receiver and from 
the receiver back to the sender to help ensure that the intended audience 
received and correctly interpreted the intended message. Examples include 
face-to-face discussions, phone calls, in-person group meetings, interactive 
teleconferences, and online instant messaging. Two-way communication is 
effective for ensuring that more complex content is correctly received and 
for conveying the sender’s beliefs and feelings about the message.
Can you hear me? Listening actively
The one skill that most strongly influences the quality of your communica-
tions is your ability to listen actively. Although you can assume that the infor-
mation contained in a message and the format in which it’s presented affect 
how well that message is received, you can find out whether the recipient 
actually received the message as you intended by listening carefully to the 
recipient’s reactions.

266
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
Active listening is exploring and discussing a message that’s being sent to help 
ensure that the message is understood as intended. If you’re sending a mes-
sage, you should encourage your intended recipient to use active listening 
techniques to help ensure that she correctly understands your message. If 
you’re receiving a message, you should use these techniques to verify to your-
self that you have correctly received the intended message.
Because listening to and observing your recipient’s response to a message 
you sent her involves information flowing first from you to the recipient and 
then from the recipient back to you, active listening is, by definition, a form 
of two-way communication.
Active listening techniques include the following:
 
✓ Visualizing: Forming a mental picture of the content of a message. 
Forming this picture gives the receiver the opportunity to identify 
pieces of the message that may be missing or misunderstood, as well as 
to seek additional information that may improve the overall understand-
ing of the original message.
 
 Consider that you’ve been asked to redesign the layout of your group’s 
offices to create a more open environment that will encourage people 
to feel more relaxed and to engage in more informal working group dis-
cussions. To help clarify what’s expected, you may try to visualize how 
the office environment will look and how people will behave after the 
changes in the layout are made. In particular, you may think about the 
following:
 
• Whether you’ll have to use the existing furnishings or you’ll be 
able to buy new ones
 
• Where people might hold informal meetings
 
• How much soundproofing partitions of differing heights will provide
 
 As you try to visualize these different parts of the new office layout, you 
realize that the following aspects aren’t quite clear to you:
 
• Will window offices have couches or just chairs?
 
• How many people should be able to sit comfortably in an office?
 
• Should “white noise” machines be installed?
 
 As you talk with people to find answers to your questions, you get a 
better idea of what your boss does and doesn’t want.
 
✓ Paraphrasing: Explaining the message and its implications, as the 
receiver understands them, back to the sender in different words than 
the original message. To be most effective, the receiver should repeat 
the message in his or her own words to give the sender the best chance 
of identifying any misinterpretations.

267
 Chapter 13: Keeping Everyone Informed
 
 Consider that your boss asks you to prepare a report of your com-
pany’s recent sales activity by the end of the week. Many aspects of this 
request are unclear, such as the time period the report should cover, 
the specific time by when the report must be finished, the format in 
which you should prepare the report, and so forth. To clarify these 
items, you can paraphrase the request back to your boss as follows:
 
 “I’d like to confirm that you’re asking me to prepare for you by this 
coming Friday at 5:00 p.m. a PowerPoint presentation on the company’s 
total gross and net sales of products a, b, and c for the period from 
January 1 to March 31 of this year.”
 
✓ Checking inferences: Clarifying assumptions and interpretations that 
the receiver makes about the message received.
 
 Consider the previous example in which your boss asks you to redesign 
the layout of your group’s offices. As you start to calculate the numbers 
of desks and chairs you’ll need in the new arrangement, you realize 
you’re assuming that the group will have the same number of people it 
has now after the move. However, instead of making this assumption, 
you can check with your boss to find out how many people he would 
like you to plan for as you design the new layout.
 
Active listening is particularly useful in emotionally charged situations, situ-
ations in which understanding is critical, situations in which consensus and 
clarity are desired in resolving conflict, and situations in which trust is sought.
Choosing the Appropriate Medium 
for Project Communication
When deciding how to communicate with your team and your project’s audi-
ences, choosing the right medium is as important as deciding what infor-
mation to share (check out Chapter 3 for a detailed discussion of project 
audiences). Your choice of medium helps ensure that people get the informa-
tion they need when they need it.
Project communications come in two forms:
 
✓ Formal: Formal communications are preplanned and conducted in a 
standard format in accordance with an established schedule. Examples 
include weekly team meetings and monthly progress reports.
 
✓ Informal: Informal communications occur as people think of information 
they want to share. These communications occur continuously in the 
normal course of business. Examples include brief conversations 
by the water cooler and spur-of-the-moment e-mails you dash off during 
the day.

268
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
 Take care not to rely on informal communications to share important 
information about your project because these interchanges often 
involve only a small number of the people who should hear what 
you have to say. To minimize the chances for misunderstandings 
and hurt feelings among your project’s team members and other 
audiences
 
• Confirm in writing any important information you share in informal 
discussions.
 
• Avoid having an informal discussion with only some of the people 
who are involved in the topic.
Both formal and informal communications can be either written or oral. The 
following sections suggest when to use each format and how to make it most 
effective.
Just the facts: Written reports
Unlike informal oral communication, written reports enable you to present 
factual data efficiently, choose your words carefully to minimize misunder-
standings, provide a historical record of the information you share, and 
share the same message with a wide audience.
 
Although written reports have quite a few benefits, they also have some draw-
backs that you need to consider:
 
✓ They don’t allow your audience to ask questions to clarify the content, 
meaning, and implication of your message.
 
✓ With written reports, you can’t verify that your audience received and 
interpreted your message as you intended.
 
✓ They don’t enable you to pick up nonverbal signals that suggest your 
audience’s reactions to the message, and they don’t support interactive 
discussion and brainstorming about your message.
 
✓ You may never know whether your audience reads the report!
 
Keep the following pointers in mind to improve the chances that people 
read and understand your written reports (see the later section “Preparing a 
Written Project-Progress Report” for specifics on writing this special type of 
communication):

269
 Chapter 13: Keeping Everyone Informed
 
✓ Prepare regularly scheduled reports in a standard format. This 
consistency helps your audience find specific types of information 
quickly.
 
✓ Stay focused. Preparing several short reports to address different topics 
is better than combining several topics into one long report. People are 
more likely to pick up the important information about each topic.
 
✓ Minimize the use of technical jargon and acronyms. If a person is unfa-
miliar with the language in your report, she’ll miss at least some of your 
messages.
 
✓ Use written reports to share facts, and be sure to identify a person or 
people to contact for clarification or further discussion of any informa-
tion in the reports. Written reports present hard data with a minimum 
of subjective interpretation, and they provide a useful, permanent refer-
ence. A contact person can address any questions a recipient has about 
the information or the reasons for sharing it.
 
✓ Clearly describe any actions you want people to take based on infor-
mation in the report. The more specifically you explain what you want 
people to do, the more likely they are to do it.
 
✓ Use novel approaches to emphasize key information. For example, 
print key sections in a different color or on colored paper, or mention 
particularly relevant or important sections in a cover memo. This addi-
tional effort increases the chances that your audience will see the report 
and read it.
 
✓ After you send your report, discuss one or two key points that you 
addressed in the report with people who received it. These follow-up 
conversations can quickly tell you whether your recipients have read it.
 
 When you come across people who clearly haven’t read your report, 
in addition to following the other suggestions in this section, explain to 
them the specific parts of the document that are most important 
for them to review and why. Then tell them that you’d like to set up a 
follow-up meeting with them to discuss any questions or issues they 
may have regarding the information contained in those parts of the 
document.
 
✓ Keep your reports to one page, if possible. If you can’t fit your report 
on one page, include a short summary (one page or less) at the begin-
ning of the report (check out the nearby sidebar “Keep it short — and 
that means you!”).

270
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
Move it along: Meetings that work
Few words elicit the same reactions of anger and frustration that the word 
meeting can provoke. People consider meetings to be everything from the 
last vestige of interpersonal contact in an increasingly technical society to 
the biggest time waster in business today.
You’ve probably been in meetings where you wanted to bang your head 
against the wall. Ever been to a meeting that didn’t start on time? How about 
a meeting that didn’t have an agenda or didn’t stick to the agenda it did have? 
Or how about a meeting at which people discussed issues you thought were 
resolved at a previous meeting?
 
Meetings don’t have to be painful experiences. If you plan and manage them 
well, meetings can be effective forms of communication. They can help you 
find out about other team members’ backgrounds, experiences, and styles; 
stimulate brainstorming, problem analysis, and decision making; and provide 
a forum to explore the reasons for and interpretations of a message.
You can improve your meetings by using the suggestions in the following sec-
tions. (In addition, be sure to check out the later section “Holding Key Project 
Meetings” for information on different types of meetings.)
Keep it short — and that means you!
Be careful of the “yes, but” syndrome — in 
which you think an idea sounds great for others, 
but your special situation requires a differ-
ent approach. In a training program a number 
of years ago, I shared my suggestion to keep 
project reports to one page or less. Most people 
agreed that doing so made sense, but one par-
ticipant rejected the notion. He proceeded to 
explain that his project was so important and 
so complex that he sent his boss monthly proj-
ect reports that were a minimum of ten pages in 
length. “And,” he added, “My boss reads every 
word.”
A few weeks after the training session, I had the 
opportunity to speak with this participant’s boss 
about a totally unrelated matter. In the course 
of our conversation, he happened to mention 
his frustration with a person on his staff who 
felt his project was so important that he had to 
submit monthly progress reports no fewer than 
ten pages long. He said that he usually read the 
first paragraph, but he rarely had time to review 
the reports thoroughly. He added that he hoped 
this person had listened carefully when I sug-
gested that reports should be one page or less!

271
 Chapter 13: Keeping Everyone Informed
Planning for a successful meeting
 
To have a good meeting, you need to do some pre-meeting planning. Keep 
these pointers in mind as you plan:
 
✓ Clarify the purpose of the meeting. This step helps you ensure that you 
invite the right people and allows attendees to prepare for the meeting.
 
✓ Decide who needs to attend and why. If you need information, decide 
who has it, and make sure they attend the meeting. If you want to make 
decisions at the meeting, decide who has the necessary authority and 
who needs to be part of the decision making, and make sure they attend.
 
✓ Give plenty of advance notice of the meeting. This step increases the 
chances that the people you want to attend will be able to do so.
 
✓ Let the people who should attend the meeting know its purpose. 
People are more likely to attend a meeting when they understand why 
their attendance is important.
 
✓ Prepare a written agenda that includes topics and their allotted dis-
cussion times. This document helps people see why attending the meet-
ing is in their interests. The agenda is also your guideline for running the 
meeting.
 
✓ Circulate the written agenda and any background material in 
advance. Doing so gives everyone time to suggest changes to the agenda 
and to prepare for the meeting.
 
✓ Keep meetings to one hour or less. You can force people to sit in a 
room for hours, but you can’t force them to keep their minds on the 
activities and information at hand for that long. If necessary, schedule 
several meetings of one hour or less to discuss complex issues or mul-
tiple topics.
Conducting an efficient meeting
 
How you conduct the meeting can make or break it. The following tasks are 
essential for conducting a productive meeting:
 
✓ Start on time, even if people are absent. After people see that you wait 
for latecomers, everyone will come late!
 
✓ Assign a timekeeper. This person reminds the group when a topic has 
exceeded its allotted time for discussion.
 
✓ Assign a person to take written minutes of who attended, which items 
you discussed, and what decisions and assignments the group made. 
This procedure allows people to review and clarify the information and 
serves as a reminder of actions to be taken after the meeting.

272
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
✓ Keep a list of action items that need further exploration, and assign 
one person to be responsible for each entry. This step helps ensure 
that when you meet to discuss these issues again, you have the right 
information and people present to resolve them.
 
✓ If you don’t have the right information or the right people to resolve 
an issue, stop your discussion and put it on the list of action items. 
Discussing an issue without having the necessary information or the 
right people present is just wasting everyone’s time.
 
✓ End on time. Your meeting attendees may have other commitments that 
begin when your meeting is supposed to end. Not ending on time causes 
these people to be late for their next commitments or to leave your 
meeting before it’s over.
Following up with the last details
Your meeting may be over, but your work isn’t done. Make sure you com-
plete the following post-meeting tasks to get the greatest benefit from the 
session:
 
✓ Promptly distribute meeting minutes to all attendees. These minutes 
allow people to reaffirm the information discussed at the meeting when 
it’s still fresh in their minds, and minutes quickly remind people of their 
follow-up tasks. Try to distribute the minutes within 24 hours of the 
meeting, and ask recipients to let you know if they have any corrections 
or additions.
 
✓ Monitor the status of all action items that are performed after the 
meeting. Because each action is itself a miniproject, monitoring its prog-
ress increases the chances that people successfully complete it.
 
Don’t just talk about these suggestions for making your meetings more effec-
tive. Discussing them can’t improve your meetings. Act on them!
Preparing a Written 
Project-Progress Report
The project-progress report is a project’s most common written communica-
tion. The report reviews activities performed during a performance period, 
describes problems encountered and the corrective actions planned and 
taken, and previews plans for the next period. (Check out Chapter 12 for some 
tips on how to choose the length of your project’s performance period — the 
length of time between performance assessments.)

273
 Chapter 13: Keeping Everyone Informed
This section helps you identify the audience for your project-progress report, 
provides pointers on what to include in your report, and suggests improve-
ments for that content so it doesn’t put your team to sleep.
Making a list (of names) 
and checking it twice
 
A project-progress report is a convenient way to keep key audiences involved in 
your project and informed of their responsibilities. Decide who should get regu-
larly scheduled project-progress reports by answering the following questions:
 
✓ Who needs to know about your project?
 
✓ Who wants to know about your project?
 
✓ Whom do you want to know about your project?
At a minimum, consider providing project-progress reports to your super-
visor, upper management, client or customer, project team members, and 
other people who are helping you on the project, as well as to people who 
are interested in or who will be affected by the project’s results.
Knowing what’s hot (and 
what’s not) in your report
 
Preparing the project-progress report gives you an opportunity to step back 
and review all aspects of your project so you can recognize accomplishments 
and identify situations that may require your early intervention. Be sure to 
include some or all of the following information in your project-progress 
report for each performance period:
 
✓ Performance highlights: Always begin your report with a summary of 
project highlights, such as “The planned upper-management review 
was successfully conducted on schedule” or “Our client Mary Fisher 
approved our training outline according to schedule.” (Just remember 
to keep it to one page!)
 
✓ Performance details: Describe the activities, outcomes, milestones, 
labor hours, and resource expenditures in detail.
 
✓ Problems and issues: Highlight special issues or problems that you 
encountered during the period, and propose any necessary corrective 
actions.

274
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
✓ Approved changes to the plan: Report all approved changes to the 
existing project plan.
 
✓ Risk-management status: Update your project risk assessment by 
reporting on changes in project assumptions, the likelihood of these 
updated assumptions occurring, and the effect of those updated 
assumptions on existing project plans. (Chapter 8 covers the basics of 
dealing with risk and uncertainty.)
 
✓ Plans for the next period: Summarize major work and accomplishments 
that you have planned for the next performance period.
Earning a Pulitzer, or at least 
writing an interesting report
When you write your project-progress report, make sure it’s interesting and 
tells the appropriate people what they need to know. After all, you don’t want 
your report to end up as a birdcage liner. Use the following tips to improve 
the quality of each of your project-progress reports:
 
✓ Tailor your reports to the interests and needs of your audiences. 
Provide only the information that your audience wants and needs. If nec-
essary, prepare separate reports for different audiences. (See Chapter 3 
for more on defining your project’s audiences.)
 
✓ If you’re preparing different progress reports for different audiences, 
prepare the most detailed one first and extract information from 
that report to produce the others. This approach ensures consistency 
among the reports and reduces the likelihood that you’ll perform the 
same work more than once.
 
✓ Produce a project-progress report at least once a month, no matter 
what your audience requests. Monitoring and sharing information 
about project progress less often than once per month significantly 
increases the chances of major damage resulting from an unidentified 
problem.
 
✓ Make sure that all product, schedule, and resource information in 
your report is for the same time period. Accomplishing this may not be 
easy if you depend on different organization systems for your raw per-
formance data.
 
 If you track project schedule performance on a system that you maintain 
yourself, you may be able to produce a status report by the end of the 
first week after the performance period. However, your organization’s 
financial system, which you use to track project expenditures, may not 
generate performance reports for the same period until a month later.
 
 Address this issue in your project’s start-up phase (see Chapter 11 for 
suggested start-up activities). Determine your sources for status data, 

275
 Chapter 13: Keeping Everyone Informed
the dates your updated data are available from each source, and the 
time periods that the data apply to. Then schedule your combined anal-
ysis and reporting so that all data describe the same time period.
 
✓ Always compare actual performance with respect to the performance 
plan. Presenting the information in this format highlights issues that you 
need to address.
 
✓ Include no surprises. If an element requires prompt action during the 
performance period (like a key person unexpectedly leaves the project 
team), immediately tell all the people involved and work to address the 
problem. However, be sure to mention the occurrence and any correc-
tive actions in the progress report to provide a written record.
 
✓ Use your regularly scheduled team meetings to discuss issues and 
problems that you raise in the project-progress report. Discuss any 
questions people have about the information in the project-progress 
report. (However, don’t read verbatim to people from the written report 
they’ve already received — and hopefully read!)
Using a project dashboard
To make your written project-progress reports 
most effective, you want to include the great-
est amount of information in the least amount 
of space. A project dashboard is an information 
display that depicts key indicators of project 
performance in a format that resembles an 
instrument panel on a dashboard. This format 
can convey the project’s overall progress and 
highlight particular problems that require fur-
ther attention.
When designing a dashboard for your project, 
take the following steps:
 1. Select the major categories of information.
 2. Choose specific indicators for each infor-
mation category.
 3. Select the format for each indicator.
Typical information categories that reflect 
important aspects of project performance 
include
 ✓ Results: Desired products your team has 
produced to date
 ✓ Performance to schedule: Dates that your 
team achieved milestones and started 
and completed activities compared to the 
schedule plan for milestones and activities
 ✓ Performance to resource budgets: Labor 
hours, funds, and other resources your 
team has used to date compared to their 
budgeted amounts
 ✓ Risk management: Current status of factors 
that may unexpectedly impede project per-
formance
Choose specific indicators for each category in 
conjunction with the project’s drivers and sup-
porters. As an example, a project that develops 
an operations manual for a piece of equipment 
may have the following indicators:
 ✓ Results: The number of manual chapters 
written or the number of people who have 
approved the final manual
(continued)

276
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
Holding Key Project Meetings
Active, ongoing support from all major project audiences gives you the great-
est chance for achieving project success. To gain that support, continually 
reinforce your project’s vision and your progress toward it, and help your 
project’s audiences understand when and how they can most effectively sup-
port your efforts. This section looks more closely at the three types of meet-
ings you may hold during your project.
Regularly scheduled team meetings
Regularly scheduled team meetings give members an opportunity to share 
progress and issues and to sustain productive and trusting interpersonal 
relationships. These meetings also provide an opportunity to reaffirm the 
 ✓ Performance to schedule: The number of 
milestone dates you’ve met and the number 
you’ve missed
 ✓ Performance to resource budgets: The ratio 
of actual funds expended to those budgeted 
for all completed activities
 ✓ Risk management: The number of original 
risks that may still occur or the number of 
new risks you’ve identified during the project
You can display indicators in a table, bar graph, 
pie chart, or speedometer format. In addition, 
indicators often have a traffic light format:
 ✓ Green light: The element is proceeding 
according to plan.
 ✓ Yellow light: One or more minor problems 
exist.
 ✓ Red light: One or more serious situations 
require immediate attention.
Determine the specific criteria for green-, 
yellow-, and red-light status for each indicator 
in consultation with the project’s drivers and 
supporters.

When creating a dashboard for your project, be 
sure to
 ✓ Work with the intended audiences of a 
report to select the categories, indicators, 
and their display formats.
 ✓ Always present actual indicator values 
alongside planned values.
 ✓ Keep the project dashboard report to one 
page or less.
(continued)

277
 Chapter 13: Keeping Everyone Informed
project’s focus and to keep team members abreast of activities within and 
outside the project that affect their work and the project’s ultimate success. 
Recognizing that most people work on several projects at the same time, 
these meetings can reinforce the team’s identity and working relationships.
 
Consult with team members to develop a meeting schedule that’s convenient 
for as many people as possible. If some people can’t attend in person, try to 
have them participate in a conference call. (See Chapter 16 for more about 
how you can use technology to support your project.)
In addition to following the suggestions for productive meetings in the “Move 
it along: Meetings that work” section earlier in this chapter, observe the fol-
lowing guidelines when planning and conducting regular team meetings:
 
✓ Even though your team meetings are held regularly, before each meet-
ing, prepare a specific agenda, distribute it beforehand, and solicit com-
ments and suggestions.
 
✓ Before the meeting, distribute the project-progress report for the most 
recent performance period (take a look at the earlier section “Preparing 
a Written Project-Progress Report” for details on this report).
 
✓ Distribute any other background information related to topics on the 
agenda before the meeting.
 
✓ Limit discussions that require more in-depth consideration; deal with 
them in other forums.
 
✓ Start on time and end on time (there, I said it again!).
 
✓ Prepare and distribute brief minutes of the meeting within 24 hours after 
its end.
Ad hoc team meetings
Hold ad hoc team meetings to address specific issues that arise during your 
project. An ad hoc meeting may involve some or all of your team’s members, 
depending on the topic. Because issues often arise unexpectedly, do the fol-
lowing as you plan an ad hoc meeting:
 
✓ Clarify the issue and what you hope to achieve at your meeting.
 
✓ Identify and invite all people who may be interested in, affected by, or 
working on the issue.
 
✓ Clearly explain the meeting’s purpose to all meeting invitees.

278
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
✓ Carefully document all action items that the attendees develop at the 
meeting, and assign responsibility for their completion.
 
✓ Be sure to share the results of an ad hoc meeting with all team members 
who may be affected by the results, who have an interest in them, and/
or whose support you need to implement them.
Upper-management progress reviews
An upper-management progress review is usually presided over by a senior man-
ager, run by a project manager, and attended by team members and represen-
tatives of all functional areas. This review gives you the chance to tell upper 
management about your project’s status, its major accomplishments, and any 
issues that require their help. The review is also an opportunity for you to note 
ways to keep the project in line with major organization initiatives.
 
Take every opportunity to help upper management remember why your proj-
ect is important to them. They may have approved your project only months 
ago, but chances are your project’s now just one of many activities in your 
busy organization.
Make your upper-management progress review effective by observing the fol-
lowing tips:
 
✓ Identify the interests of your audience, and explain how your project is 
meeting those interests.
 
✓ Keep your presentation short; choose a few key messages and empha-
size them.
 
✓ Highlight your key information, but be prepared to go into more detail 
on issues if anyone asks you to do so.
 
✓ Use both text and graphics to convey important information.
 
✓ Allow time for questions.
 
✓ Present updated information on project risks, and explain how you’re 
addressing them.
 
✓ Distribute a brief handout at the meeting that summarizes the key points 
of your presentation.
 
✓ After the meeting, distribute notes that highlight issues raised and 
actions that you agreed on during the review.

279
 Chapter 13: Keeping Everyone Informed
Preparing a Project Communications 
Management Plan
With the diversity of audiences that will be looking for information about 
your project and the array of data that you will be collecting, it’s essential 
that you prepare a project Communications Management Plan to avoid 
duplication of effort and to ensure that nothing and no one falls through the 
cracks.
 
A project Communications Management Plan is a document that specifies all 
project communications generated throughout the project, their target audi-
ences, their information content, and their frequency. Prepare an initial ver-
sion of your project Communications Management Plan in the starting the 
project stage of your project, and update it as needed in the carrying out the 
work stage. (Flip to Chapter 1 for details on the distinct stages of a project.)
At a minimum, your plan should specify the following for all project 
communications:
 
✓ Target audience: The people whose information needs are addressed 
through the project communication (Check out Chapter 3 for a discus-
sion of how to identify and classify project audiences.)
 
✓ Information needs: The information that the target audience wants and/
or needs
 
✓ Information-sharing activity: The specific type of information-sharing 
activity to be used to transmit information to the target audience (writ-
ten reports, presentations, and meetings, for example) (Check out the 
section “Choosing the Appropriate Medium for Project Communication” 
earlier in this chapter for more on when different types of information-
sharing activities should be used.)
 
✓ Content: The specific data to be shared in the project communication
 
✓ Frequency: When the information-sharing activity occurs (can be either 
regularly scheduled or ad hoc)
 
✓ Data collection: How and when the data for the report are collected

Encouraging Peak Performance by 
Providing Effective Leadership
In This Chapter
▶ Clarifying the difference between leadership and management
▶ Tapping into different sources of power
▶ Developing and maintaining motivation on your team
B
ecause of the rapid changes that are occurring in every facet of busi-
ness and personal life today, leadership is one of the most impor-
tant issues facing organizations. As a result, a large body of literature has 
emerged to explore how to guide people to achieve common goals in a wide 
variety of settings.
When working in a matrix environment, your project’s success depends on 
your ability to organize, coordinate, and support a diverse team that’s work-
ing toward a common goal (see Chapter 9 for more specifics about the matrix 
structure). Often the people on your team come from different areas of your 
organization, have different operating styles, and don’t report to you admin-
istratively. Successfully guiding such a group of people requires both vision 
and structure.
This chapter discusses tips for aligning, focusing, and motivating the people 
supporting your project to maximize the chances for your project’s success.
Comparing Leadership and Management
Leadership and management are two related but distinct sets of behaviors for 
guiding and supporting people through a project. Here are the differences:
 
✓ Leadership emphasizes defining a vision and encouraging other people 
to help make that vision a reality; management focuses on creating plans 
and assessing performance.

282
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
✓ Leadership focuses on people; management focuses on systems, proce-
dures, and information.
 
✓ Leadership facilitates change; management creates order and 
predictability.
 
As you plan your project, explore the why of the project (a leadership issue) 
to help elicit people’s buy in and commitment. Also explore the what, when, 
and how (management issues) to develop a feasible approach for successfully 
achieving the project’s goals. As you organize your project, clarify who will 
support the different project activities (a management task) and help them get 
excited about doing so (a leadership task).
Throughout the project, continually let people know how the project is pro-
gressing, and deal with any problems you encounter along the way (manage-
ment tasks). Remind people of the project’s benefits, and acknowledge their 
contributions to the project’s success (leadership tasks). Table 14-1 illus-

in a project.

Developing Personal Power and Influence
Power is the ability to influence the actions of others. Establishing effective 
bases of power enhances your ability to coordinate your team and other 
key audiences. In this section, I explain how to develop your personal power 
bases and how to use the power you can derive from those bases to energize 
and motivate people throughout the life of your project.

Chapter 14: Encouraging Peak Performance by Providing Effective Leadership
Understanding why people 
do what you ask
Because personal power is the ability to influence and guide the actions of 
others, the first step in developing this power is understanding why people 
choose to do what you ask in the first place. People respond to your requests 
and directions for many reasons, including the following:
 
✓ Rewards: People do what you ask because they want the benefits you 
can give them. Examples of rewards include raises and recognition.
 
✓ Punishments: People do what you ask because they don’t want what 
you can give them. Examples of punishments include poor performance 
appraisals and undesirable job assignments.
 
✓ Your position: People take your requests more seriously because they 
feel the project manager should direct team members. You can lose this 
power if you behave inappropriately, but you have it initially.
 
✓ What you stand for: People do what you ask because they agree with 
your goals. They know that your requests and actions are attempts to 
achieve the same results they want to achieve.
 
✓ Who you are: People listen to you because they appreciate and respect 
who you are, as reflected by your sensitivity, your loyalty to others, 
your sense of humor, or other positive characteristics of your attitudes 
and behaviors.
 
✓ Your expertise: People listen to you because they respect the skills and 
knowledge that you bring to your job. They listen to you because they 
believe you’re probably right.
 
You don’t have to be the technical expert on your project to command the 
respect of your team members and effectively lead your project. But you do 
have to be an expert in the skills and knowledge that your job demands on the 
project. Because you’re the project manager, these skills and knowledge 
include your abilities to plan and control the project, encourage effective com-
munication, encourage a positive and productive work environment, and 
understand the political environment in your overall organization.
Of course, your technical expertise can be a significant asset if you use it cor-
rectly. Your praise for a job well done means a lot more to your team mem-
bers than praise from someone who’s less qualified to assess the work.
 
Take note that being both the technical expert and the project manager on 
your project can work against you. If you’re not careful, you can discourage 
others from accepting responsibilities and performing their work indepen-
dently for one or more of the following reasons:

284
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
✓ They feel that their work can never be as good as yours.
 
✓ You keep the more challenging and important assignments for yourself 
because you like the work and think you can do it best.
 
✓ You resist approaches that differ from the ones you normally take.
 
✓ You tend to micromanage people to ensure that they’re performing 
assignments just as you would.
Although many factors can contribute to your ability to influence people, 
your power over your team members is generally one of the following:
 
✓ Ascribed: Someone gives you authority to reward and punish others.
 
✓ Achieved: You earn the respect and allegiance of other people.
Achieved power is far more effective and longer-lasting than ascribed power. 
People who act in response to your ascribed power usually do the least 
amount of work necessary to get the rewards they want or to avoid the con-
sequences they fear. On the other hand, people motivated by your achieved 
power work to accomplish the highest possible quality of results because 
they’ve decided that doing so is in their best interests (and yours).
 
Whether or not you recognize and acknowledge it, you have considerable 
opportunity to develop and use achieved power. You can choose how you 
want to influence people’s behavior, or you can inadvertently influence their 
behavior. Either way, your actions influence other people’s behavior.
Establishing the bases of your power
You can get a sense of the power you have over someone by taking note of 
the willingness with which she agrees to do and then does what you request. 
If you already get all the cooperation from others that you need, just keep 
doing what you’re doing. However, if you feel frustrated by people’s resis-
tance and lack of cooperation when you ask for their help, take steps to 
improve the power you have over them.
 
Successfully influencing the behavior of others requires, first, that you under-
stand the different types of power you have over them and, second, that you 
effectively use that power. Your ascribed power over people depends, in part, 
on their perceptions of the specific authority you and others whom you can 
influence have over them. Your achieved power is based on people’s percep-
tions of what you know, who you are, and what you stand for. (I introduce 
ascribed and achieved power in the preceding section.)
Take the following steps to improve your ability to influence your team mem-
bers and other people in your project environment:

285
Chapter 14: Encouraging Peak Performance by Providing Effective Leadership
 
✓ Determine the authority you have over the people you want to influ-
ence. Common types of authority include the ability to give salary 
increases and promotions, complete performance appraisals, and assign 
people to future jobs.
 
✓ Find out who else has authority over the people you want to influ-
ence. If you don’t make the decision about whether and how much to 
increase a person’s salary but you can influence the individual who 
does, the person will react to you as if you, too, have some measure of 
ascribed power over her.
 
✓ Clarify for yourself how and why the project’s successful completion 
benefits your organization, and share those benefits with the people 
you want to influence. Knowing all the benefits your project is designed 
to yield puts you in a better position to help others see why helping you 
complete your project is in their best interests.
 
✓ Get to know the people you want to influence; understand, appreciate, 
and acknowledge their special talents and strengths. Getting to know 
other people helps you understand the types of rewards and recognition 
they appreciate most. It also tells them you care for them as people, not 
just as technical resources for your project.
 
✓ Let the people you want to influence get to know your good side. Your 
achieved power over others is based on their perceptions of your char-
acter and abilities.
 
✓ Don’t condemn or complain, but do give feedback when necessary. 
Condemning is making negative judgments about others; complaining is 
criticizing people or things without doing anything to improve them. 
Both behaviors entail sharing negative opinions rather than facts, which 
demoralizes and demotivates people while doing little to achieve high-
quality results. Constructive feedback, on the other hand, entails sharing 
factual information to improve people’s performance. People respect 
others whom they feel are interested in helping them succeed.
 
✓ Become proficient in the tasks you have to perform. People listen to 
you more seriously when they believe you know what you’re talking 
about.
 
You must reestablish your bases of power for each new project you perform 
because you may be dealing with different people on each project and 
because your power bases depend heavily on the specific details of the proj-
ect itself. Further, even on the same project, your bases of power can diminish 
over time if you don’t consistently reinforce them. Meeting with team mem-
bers at the start of your project can help them appreciate your style and rec-
ognize that everyone wants to accomplish similar goals. However, if you don’t 
have any more contact with your team members for six months, their initial 
positive impressions can fade — right along with your ability to influence their 
commitment and performance.

286
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
You Can Do It! Creating and Sustaining 
Team Member Motivation
Efficient processes and smooth relationships create the opportunity for suc-
cessful projects. And having team members personally commit to your proj-
ect’s success gives you the greatest chance of achieving it. Therefore, your 
major task as a project manager is to encourage every team member to be 
motivated and committed to your project’s success.
 
Motivation is a personal choice — the only person you can motivate directly 
is yourself. You can create the opportunity for other people to become moti-
vated, but you can’t make the decision for them. The following factors encour-
age a person to become and remain motivated to achieve a goal:
 
✓ Desirability: The value of achieving the goal
 
✓ Feasibility: The likelihood that you can achieve the goal
 
✓ Progress: Your accomplishments as you work to reach your goal
 
✓ Reward: The payoff when you reach the goal
When your project meets people’s professional and personal needs in each of 
these four areas, you strengthen their commitment to the project’s success. 
In this section, I show you specific ways to meet these needs.
Increasing commitment by clarifying 
your project’s benefits
Although some people commit to completing an assignment because some-
one tells them to do so, you get a much more serious commitment when a 
person recognizes and appreciates a project’s benefits. When discussing 
your project’s benefits with your team, consider those benefits that are most 
important to your organization, its employees, and its clients, such as
 
✓ Improved products and services
 
✓ Improved internal processes and procedures
 
✓ Increased sales
 
✓ Improved productivity
 
✓ Better work environment

287
Chapter 14: Encouraging Peak Performance by Providing Effective Leadership
Also consider potential benefits to each team member, such as
 
✓ Acquiring new skills and knowledge
 
✓ Working in an enjoyable environment
 
✓ Expanding business contacts
 
✓ Enhancing career potential
 
When you help people realize the personal benefits they can get from partici-
pating in your project, you increase their commitment to the project and, 
therefore, the chances that the project will succeed.
Occasionally, someone reminds me that his team members receive sala-
ries for doing their jobs. In other words, this person is suggesting that he 
doesn’t have to worry about whether his team members realize personal 
benefits from doing their assigned tasks. As far as he’s concerned, people 
will perform their assignments because they want to receive their paychecks. 
Unfortunately, however, this type of reward power encourages people to do 
the least work necessary to ensure they receive their next paychecks rather 
than to work toward the highest-quality results.
I’m not suggesting your main concerns on a project are your team mem-
bers’ personal benefits. However, people are more committed if they feel 
they can accomplish their personal goals while helping their organization 
achieve its goals.
 
Do the following to help your team understand and appreciate the benefits 
your project can achieve for the organization:
 
✓ Identify the situation that led to your project.
 
✓ Identify your project’s key drivers, and clarify their hopes for the project 
(see Chapter 3 for more about project drivers).
 
✓ Encourage team members to discuss the expected benefits and the 
value of those benefits.
 
Do the following to encourage your team members to identify the personal 
benefits they may realize from participating in your project:
 
✓ Discuss their personal interests and career goals, and relate those inter-
ests and goals to aspects of the project.
 
✓ Discuss past projects they’ve enjoyed and the reasons they’ve enjoyed 
them.
 
✓ Discuss some of the benefits that you and other people hope to realize 
by working on this project.

288
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
Encouraging persistence by demonstrating 
project feasibility
A project is feasible if it’s possible to accomplish. No matter how desirable 
you may feel a project is, if you’re convinced that nothing you do can lead to 
its success, you’ll give up more easily when you encounter the slightest of 
difficulties (and so will your team members). You don’t need a guarantee of 
success, but you must believe that you have a reasonable chance at it.
 
Feasibility is a subjective assessment. What seems impossible to one person 
can appear feasible to another. Further, your assessment of feasibility can 
become a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you think an assignment is feasible, you 
work hard to complete it; if you encounter problems, you try to work them 
out. However, if you really believe you have no chance of succeeding, you give 
up at the first sign of difficulty. Any problems you encounter just confirm what 
you already knew — the project was doomed from the start. Of course, as 
soon as you give up, you have no chance of succeeding, so you’ve confirmed 
your initial belief that the project wasn’t feasible!
 
Help people believe a project is feasible by working with them to define what 
the team will produce, when, and how. Specifically, do the following:
 
✓ Involve team members in the planning process.
 
✓ Encourage them to identify potential concerns so you can address them.
 
✓ Explain why you feel that your targets and plans are feasible.
 
✓ Develop responsive risk-management plans (see Chapter 8).
Letting people know how they’re doing
Getting your team members to appreciate your project’s value and feasibility 
helps you motivate them initially. However, if the project lasts longer than a 
couple of weeks, the team’s initial motivation can die out without continual 
reinforcement from you. In general, people working on a particular task need 
to know how they’re doing over time for three reasons:
 
✓ Achieving intermediate milestones provides personal satisfaction.
 
✓ Recognizing their successes confirms they’re on the right track.
 
✓ Successfully completing intermediate steps reinforces their belief that 
they can accomplish the final goals.

289
Chapter 14: Encouraging Peak Performance by Providing Effective Leadership
 
Have you ever seen a 12-month project in which all the major milestones 
occurred in months 11 and 12? When do you think people got serious about 
this project? Months 10, 11, and 12 (if they were still around by then)! 
Obviously, you want your team members to stay interested and motivated 
throughout the life of your project, not just at its climax. Do the following to 
help keep people on track and excited about your project:
 
✓ Establish meaningful and frequent intermediate milestones.
 
✓ Continually assess how people are doing.
 
✓ Frequently share information with people about their performance.
 
✓ Continually reinforce the project’s potential benefits.
See Chapter 13 for ways to inform people of your project’s progress.
Providing rewards for work well done
Rewarding people at a project’s conclusion for their effort and accomplish-
ments confirms to them that they accomplished the desired results and met 
the audience’s needs. It also reassures them that team members and manag-
ers recognize and appreciate their contributions. This recognition, in turn, 
makes it more likely that they’ll welcome the opportunity to participate in 
future projects.
 
Post-project rewards can take several forms, including the following:
 
✓ You talk with the person and express your appreciation for her help.
 
✓ You express your appreciation in a written note or e-mail to the person.
 
✓ You express your appreciation in writing to the person’s supervisor.
 
✓ You formally submit input to the person’s performance appraisal.
 
✓ You nominate the person for a future assignment she particularly wants.
 
✓ You nominate the person for a cash award.
 
✓ You issue the person a certificate of appreciation.
 
✓ You take the person out to lunch.
Rather than guessing which form of reward your team members will appreci-
ate most, ask each of them directly.

290
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
To make the rewards you offer the most effective, do the following:
 
✓ Be sure your acknowledgment and appreciation is honest and sincere.
 
✓ Note the specific contribution the reward recognizes.
 
✓ Respect the person’s personal style and preferences when giving the 
reward:
 
• Some people enjoy receiving acknowledgements in front of their 
coworkers, while others prefer receiving them in private.
 
• Some people appreciate receiving an individual award; others 
appreciate receiving an award presented to the entire team.

Bringing Your Project to Closure
In This Chapter
▶ Planning for a successful project termination
▶ Taking care of the remaining administrative issues
▶ Helping your team transition to the end of your project
▶ Evaluating your project’s successes and failures with the post-project evaluation
O
ne characteristic that distinguishes a project from other work assign-
ments is its distinct end — the point at which all work is complete 
and the results are achieved. However, with intense demands pulling you to 
your next assignment, you may be compelled to let your completed projects 
languish and eventually fade away instead of clearly ending them with an 
announcement, recognition of the results, and a thank-you to all the people 
who made them possible.
Unfortunately, not bringing your projects to full closure hurts both the orga-
nization and the people who performed the work. When you don’t assess 
the extent to which your project achieved the desired outcomes, you can’t 
determine whether you conceived, planned, and performed the project well. 
Furthermore, team members don’t have the chance to experience closure, 
achievement, and a job well done.
This chapter shows you how to close your project successfully by finishing 
all substantive work, performing the final administrative tasks, and helping 
team members complete their association with your project and move on. In 
addition, this chapter helps you announce your project’s end and conduct a 
post-project evaluation.
 
As discussed in Chapter 1, very large projects are often subdivided into 
phases and each phase is treated as a separate miniproject. The discussions 
in this chapter apply to closing project phases, as well as to closing the entire 
project.

292
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
Staying the Course to Completion
Following your project all the way through to completion helps ensure that 
everyone gets the maximum benefits from your project’s results. It also 
allows you to determine all these benefits and compare them with the costs 
incurred, confirm the company’s return on investment, and validate its pro-
cess for selecting projects.
 
Bringing a project to an end typically entails wrapping up a multitude of small 
details and open issues. Dealing with these numerous assignments can be 
frustrating under the best of circumstances. However, the following situations 
can make the end of a project even more difficult:
 
✓ You don’t have a detailed, written list of all the activities you must per-
form during closeout.
 
✓ Some team members transferred to new assignments during your proj-
ect’s course, forcing the remaining members to assume new responsi-
bilities in addition to their original ones.
 
✓ The project staff loses motivation as general interest in the project 
wanes and people look forward to new assignments.
 
✓ The project staff wants the project to continue because they don’t want 
to end the personal and professional relationships they’ve developed or 
they’re not excited about their next assignments.
 
✓ Your customers (internal and/or external) aren’t overly interested in 
completing the final details of the project.
Reduce the impact of difficult situations like these and increase the chances 
for your project’s success by planning for closure at the outset of your proj-
ect, identifying and attending to all closure details and tasks, and refocusing 
your team. This section shows you how to do so (and more).
Planning ahead for your project’s closure
If you wait until the end of your project to start thinking in detail about 
its closure, it may be too late to gather all the necessary information and 
resources. Instead, start planning for your project’s completion at the same 
time that you prepare your initial project plan by doing the following (see 
Chapter 1 for information on what goes into the project plan):
 
✓ Describe your project objectives completely and clearly, and iden-
tify all relevant objective measures and specifications. If one of the 
project objectives is to change an existing situation, describe that situa-
tion before you begin your project so you have a comparative basis for 
assessment at the end of your project.

293
 Chapter 15: Bringing Your Project to Closure
 
✓ Prepare a checklist of everything you must do before you can offi-
cially close your project. Here are some examples of closure items to 
include on your checklist:
 
• Complete any unfinished project activities.
 
• Complete all required deliverables.
 
• Obtain all necessary acceptances and approvals of project results, 
including those of the client(s).
 
• Assess the extent to which project results met expectations.
 
• Perform all required administrative tasks.
 
• Terminate all related contracts for goods and services.
 
• Transition team members to their new assignments.
 
• Ensure that all project documentation and deliverables are 
archived in the appropriate storage locations.
 
 For each item on the project-closure checklist, specify who will perform 
it, when it will be done, and what resources will be required.
 
✓ Include closure activities in your project plan. In your project’s Work 
Breakdown Structure (WBS), specify all activities you’ll have to perform 
to close out your project, and then plan for sufficient time and resources 
to perform them (see Chapter 4 for more on this tool).
Updating your initial closure plans when 
you’re ready to wind down the project
Encourage your team members to consider the closing the project stage of 
your project to be a separate assignment with its own objectives, tasks, and 
resource requirements (see Chapter 1 for more on the closing the project 
stage of your project). As you complete the main project’s work, review and 
update the preliminary closure plans you developed in your initial project 
plan (see the preceding section for details on these preliminary plans).
Charging up your team for the 
sprint to the finish line
As team members work hard to fulfill project obligations, their focus often 
shifts from accomplishing the project’s overall objectives to completing their 
individual assignments. In addition, other audiences who were initially very 
interested in the project’s results may become involved with other priorities 

294
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
and activities as the project continues (which means they likely lose inter-
est and enthusiasm for your project). Yet, successful project completion 
requires a coordinated effort by all key participants.
 
To reinforce your team’s focus and interest, do the following:
 
✓ Remind people of the value and importance of the project’s final results. 
Frequently discuss the benefits the organization will realize from your 
project’s final results as well as the individual benefits your team members 
will gain. People are more likely to work hard to successfully complete a 
project when they realize the benefits they’ll achieve by doing so.
 
✓ Call your team together, and reaffirm your mutual commitment to 
bring the project to successful completion. Discuss why you feel the 
project is important, and describe your personal commitment to com-
pleting it successfully. Encourage other people to make similar commit-
ments. People overcome obstacles and perform difficult assignments 
more effectively when they’re committed to succeed.
 
✓ Monitor final activities closely, and give frequent feedback on perfor-
mance to each team member. Set up frequent milestones and progress-
reporting times with team members. Staying in close touch with team 
members provides you and them up-to-date info on how close you are to 
final closure; it also provides the opportunity to identify and deal with any 
issues and problems that may arise throughout the course of your project.
 
✓ Be accessible to all team members. Make yourself available when team 
members want to confer with you. Consider having lunch periodically 
with them and letting them see you around their office area. Being acces-
sible affirms your interest in and the importance of their work.
Handling Administrative Issues
 
Just as you must have authorization for people to legally spend time, effort, 
and resources to perform work on your project, you must rescind this authori-
zation when you close the project to ensure that people won’t continue to 
spend time, effort, or resources on it in the future. You can officially terminate 
this authorization by doing the following:
 
✓ Obtain all required approvals. Obtain written approval that your proj-
ect has passed all performance tests and adhered to applicable stan-
dards and certifications. In addition, be sure you’ve obtained customer 
or client acceptances. This step confirms that no additional work is nec-
essary on the project.
 
✓ Reconcile any outstanding transactions. If you’ve made project pur-
chases from outside sources, resolve any disputes with vendors and 
suppliers, pay all outstanding bills, and make sure the contracts are 

295
 Chapter 15: Bringing Your Project to Closure
officially closed. Make sure you adjust any project work effort or expen-
ditures that were posted to incorrect accounts.
 
✓ Close out all charge categories. Get official confirmation that no future 
labor or financial charges can be made to your project accounts.
Providing a Good Transition 
for Team Members
As part of successfully finishing your own project, you need to help project 
team members complete their project responsibilities and move on to their 
next assignments. Handling this transition in an orderly and agreed-upon 
fashion allows people to focus their energies on completing their tasks on 
your project instead of wondering where and when their next assignments 
will be. In particular, do the following:
 
✓ Acknowledge and document team members’ contributions. Express 
your appreciation to people for their assistance on your project, and 
share with them your assessment of their performance. Take a moment 
to thank their supervisors for making them available to your project, 
and provide the supervisors with an assessment of their performance.
 
 As a general rule, share positive feedback in public; share constructive 
criticisms and suggestions for improvement in private. In both cases, be 
sure to share your comments with team members personally and follow 
up your conversation in writing.
 
✓ Help people plan for their transition to new assignments. If appropri-
ate, help people find their next project assignments. Help them develop 
a schedule for winding down their involvement with your project while 
making sure they fulfill all their remaining obligations. Consider holding 
a final project meeting or lunch to provide your team members closure 
on their work and project relationships.
 
✓ Announce to the organization that your project is complete. You can 
make this announcement in an e-mail, in an announcement on the com-
pany intranet, in a meeting, or through an organization-wide publication, 
such as a newsletter. You need to make this announcement for the fol-
lowing three reasons:
 
• To alert people in your organization that the planned outcomes of 
your project are now available
 
• To confirm to people who supported your project that their efforts 
led to a successful result
 
• To let people know they can no longer charge time or resources to 
your project

296
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
✓ Take a moment to let team members and others who supported your 
project know the true results of the time and work they invested. 
Nothing can give your team members stronger motivation to jump into 
the next assignment and provide continued high-quality support than 
telling them about the positive results of their previous work.
See the sidebar “Using a novel approach to announce your project’s closure” 
to see one person’s unusual way to let people know his project was over.
Using a novel approach to announce 
your project’s closure
If your project was small, chances are all the 
participants already know it’s over and are 
aware of its results. But if the project took a 
long time (six months or more) and involved 
many groups in your organization, people who 
participated early may never see the actual 
results of their efforts.
A while back, a client of mine had just com-
pleted a one-year project that entailed the 
design, development, production, and introduc-
tion of a small piece of equipment for an aircraft 
cockpit. At the official end of his project, he 
reflected on the many different people from all 
areas of his organization who had played some 
role in the project. In addition to the engineers 
who completed the final installation and testing 
of the equipment, contract officers, procure-
ment specialists, financial managers, human 
resources specialists, test lab personnel, logis-
ticians, and others had all helped make the proj-
ect a success.
He realized that, if past experience was any 
indicator, the vast majority of these support 
people would never see the final result of their 
efforts. So he decided to do something that his 
organization had never done; he put together a 
small display in his workplace that illustrated 
the birth, evolution, and fruition of his project. 
He included everything from the signed con-
tract document and purchase orders to the ini-
tial design model and engineering drawings to 
pictures of the device in an airplane, a pilot who 
would use it, as well as the maintenance people 
who would support it. He then sent messages 
to all the people who had worked on the proj-
ect, announcing the display and inviting them to 
come by his workplace to visit.
The response was overwhelming. He estimated 
that more than 100 people came by to look at 
the display. He overheard comments by people 
throughout the organization about how they’d 
performed individual tasks large and small that 
contributed to the success of this equipment — 
equipment that they now could see would affect 
people’s lives. The most poignant comment he 
received was from a technician who worked in 
the test laboratory. The technician told him this 
was the first time in his 11 years with the orga-
nization that he’d ever seen the final results of 
an item he’d tested.
My client estimated that he spent several hours 
assembling the display. But the positive results 
he and his organization received from this shar-
ing were immeasurable.

Lay the groundwork for repeating on future projects what worked on past 
ones (and avoiding what didn’t) by conducting a post-project evaluation.
 
A post-project evaluation (also called a post-project review or lessons learned) is 
an assessment of project results, activities, and processes that allows you to
 
✓ Recognize project achievements and acknowledge people’s work.
 
✓ Identify techniques and approaches that worked, and devise steps to 
ensure they’re used in the future.
 
✓ Identify techniques and approaches that didn’t work, and devise steps 
to ensure they aren’t used again in the future.
 
A project postmortem is another term for post-project evaluation. I avoid using 
this term, however, because it conjures up the image of an autopsy to deter-
mine the cause of death! I prefer to leave people with a more positive memory 
of their experience with a project.
This section helps you plan for, conduct, and follow up on a post-project 
evaluation.
Preparing for the evaluation 
throughout the project
Take steps in each stage of your project’s evolution (starting the project, 
organizing and preparing, carrying out the work, and closing the project) to 
lay the groundwork for your post-project evaluation (see Chapter 1 for more 
on the four states of a project):
 
✓ Starting the project:
 
• Determine the benefits your project’s drivers wanted to realize 
when they authorized your project. (See Chapter 3 for a discussion 
of drivers and the other types of project audiences.)
 
• If your project is designed to change an existing situation, take 
before measures to describe the existing situation so that you have 
something to compare to the after measures you take when the 
project is completed.

Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
✓ Organizing and preparing:
 
• Identify additional project drivers you may have overlooked in the 
first stage of your project. Your project drivers’ expectations serve 
as the criteria for defining your project’s success, so you want to 
know who they all are before you begin your project’s work.
 
• Develop clear and detailed descriptions of all project objectives.
 
• Include the activity Conduct a post-project evaluation in your Work 
Breakdown Structure (WBS), and allow time and resources to per-
form it. (See Chapter 4 for a discussion of the WBS.)
 
✓ Carrying out the work:
 
• Tell team members that the project will have a post-project 
evaluation.
 
• Encourage team members to record issues, problems, and suc-
cesses throughout their project involvement in a handwritten or 
computerized project log. Review the log when proposing topics 
for discussion at the post-project evaluation meeting.
 
• Maintain files of cost, labor-hour charges, and schedule perfor-
mance reports throughout the project. (See Chapter 12 for details 
on how to track and report this information.)
 
✓ Closing the project:
 
• If changing an existing situation was a project objective, take after 
measures of that situation’s key characteristics to see whether you 
successfully met that objective.
 
• Obtain final cost, labor-hour, and schedule performance reports 
for the project.
 
• Survey key stakeholders to determine how well they feel the proj-
ect addressed their needs and their assessments of project team 
and project manager performance.
Setting the stage for the 
evaluation meeting
A post-project evaluation is only as good as the results, expenditures, and 
performance information it’s based on. The information must be complete, 
detailed, and accurate. Prepare for your post-project evaluation meeting by 
collecting information on the following:
 
✓ Project results
 
✓ Schedule performance

299
 Chapter 15: Bringing Your Project to Closure
 
✓ Resource expenditures
 
✓ Problems that arose during the project
 
✓ Changes during the project in objectives, schedules, and budgets
 
✓ Unanticipated occurrences or changes in the environment during the 
project
 
✓ Customers’ satisfaction with the project results
 
✓ Management’s satisfaction with the project results
 
✓ Effectiveness of the project-management processes
 
✓ Lessons learned
You can collect this information from the following sources:
 
✓ Progress reports
 
✓ Project logs
 
✓ Cost reports
 
✓ Schedule reports
 
✓ Project memos, correspondence, and meeting minutes
 
✓ Interviews and surveys of customers, managers, and team members
 
Prepare a detailed agenda for the post-project evaluation meeting that speci-
fies the times when topic discussions will start and end. Consider including 
the following topics on your agenda:
 
✓ Statement of the meeting’s purpose
 
✓ Specific meeting outcomes to be accomplished
 
✓ Highlights of project performance, including the following:
 
• Results, schedules, and resources
 
• Approaches to project planning
 
• Project-tracking systems and procedures
 
• Project communications
 
• Project team practices and effectiveness
 
✓ Recognition and discussion of special achievements
 
✓ Review of customer and management reactions to the project
 
✓ Discussion of problems and issues
 
✓ Discussion of how to reflect experiences from this project in future efforts

300
Part IV: Steering the Ship: Managing Your Project to Success 
 
Circulate a draft agenda, related background materials, and a list of attendees 
to all expected attendees at least one week before the meeting. This advance 
notice gives people time to suggest additions, deletions, and changes to the 
agenda. Revise the agenda to address these suggestions, and distribute the 
final agenda to all meeting participants at least one day before the meeting.
Conducting the evaluation meeting
A successful post-project evaluation meeting (which you can hold in person, 
via video conference, or through most other meeting methods) requires that 
you address the right topics and that people share their project thoughts and 
experiences openly and honestly.
At the post-project evaluation meeting, explore the following issues:
 
✓ Did you accomplish all the project objectives?
 
✓ Did you meet the project schedule?
 
✓ Did you complete the project within budget?
 
✓ With regard to problems during the project
 
• Could you have anticipated and planned for them in advance? If so, 
how?
 
• Did you handle them effectively and efficiently when they arose?
 
✓ Did you use the organization’s project-management systems and proce-
dures effectively?
 
To ensure you get the most accurate information and the best recommenda-
tions for future actions, do the following before and during your post-project 
evaluation meeting:
 
✓ Invite the right people. Invite all the people who participated in your 
project at all points throughout its life. If the list of potential invitees is 
too long, consider meeting separately with select subgroups and then 
holding a general session at which everyone reviews the results of the 
smaller meetings and you solicit final comments and suggestions.
 
✓ Declare at the beginning of the meeting that it’s supposed to be a 
learning experience rather than a finger-pointing session. As the proj-
ect manager, you run the post-project evaluation meeting. At its outset, 
you need to declare that the session is a time for self-examination and 
suggestions for ensuring the success of future projects. If people start to 
attack or criticize other participants, you can immediately bring the dis-
cussion back on track by asking the participants the following questions:

301
 Chapter 15: Bringing Your Project to Closure
 
• What can you do in the future to deal more effectively with such 
situations?
 
• What can you do in the future to head off such situations?
 
 If people resist your attempts to redirect their conversations, you can 
mention actions that you, as project manager, can take in the future to 
head off or deal with similar situations more effectively and then ask 
people to share additional ideas.
 
✓ Encourage people to
 
• Identify what other people did well.
 
• Examine their own performance and see how they could’ve han-
dled situations differently.
 
✓ Consider holding the session away from your office. People often 
feel more comfortable critiquing existing practices and discussing new 
approaches when they’re away from their normal work environments.
 
Be sure to assign a person to take notes during the post-project evaluation 
meeting. In addition to a list of attendees and highlights of information, the 
notes should list all the agreed-on activities to implement the lessons learned 
from the meeting and the people responsible for those activities.
Following up on the evaluation
Often your busy schedule pulls you to new projects before you’ve had a 
chance to analyze and benefit from previous ones. However, even when 
people do take a few moments to review previous project experiences, they 
seldom incorporate the lessons learned in their future operating practices.
 
As soon as possible after your post-project evaluation meeting, you, as project 
manager, need to prepare and distribute a report that’s based on the meeting 
minutes and that addresses the following topics:
 
✓ Practices to incorporate in future projects
 
✓ Steps to take to encourage these practices
 
✓ Practices to avoid in future projects
 
✓ Steps to take to discourage these practices
Consider this wrap-up report as you plan future projects to make sure you 
apply the lessons you learned.

Taking Your Project 
Management to 
the Next Level

In this part . . .
Y
ou become a truly skilled project manager by con-
tinuing to increase your knowledge and refine your 
practices and by effectively using tools and resources 
from start to finish. Lucky for you, this part is here to help 
you do just that.
In this part, I suggest ways to use new technologies and, 
just as important, ways to avoid some of their pitfalls. I 
also walk you through an advanced method for assessing 
project schedule and cost performances that can provide 
early warning signs of potential problems on larger 
projects.

Chapter 16
Using Technology to 
Up Your Game
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing software’s role in project planning and control
▶ Sizing up the benefits and limitations of e-mail
▶ Using technology to support virtual teams
A
major part of project management is information — getting it, storing 
it, analyzing it, and sharing it. But the key to successful project manage-
ment is using this information to guide and encourage people’s performance.
Today’s technology provides easier and more affordable ways to handle 
information. For example, computer software allows you to enter, store, and 
analyze information and then present the results in professional formats. 
E-mail allows written communication with people in remote locations at all 
hours of the day (and night!).
Even with all these advances, however, technology alone can’t ensure 
focused and committed team performance. In fact, excessive reliance on 
today’s technology can actually result in poor morale, confused and disorga-
nized team members, and lower overall performance.
In this chapter, I suggest how you can use technology in jobs that work well 
with it. For the jobs that aren’t so well-suited for technology, I discuss other, 
more appropriate means for handling people’s information needs.
Using Computer Software Effectively
 
Today’s software for special analyses and reporting looks so good that you 
may be tempted to believe it’s all you need to ensure your project’s success. 
However, even though the software works effectively and efficiently, it can’t 
perform the following essential tasks:

306
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 
 
✓ Ensure that information is appropriately defined, timely, and accurate. 
In most instances, people record information to support project planning 
and control, and then they enter the info into a computer. You can pro-
gram the software to check for correctness of format or internal consis-
tency, but the software can’t ensure the quality and integrity of the data.
 
 Suppose you use a computer program to maintain records of labor 
hours that team members charge to your project. You can program the 
computer to reject hours that are inadvertently charged with an invalid 
project code. However, you can’t program the computer to recognize 
hours charged to the wrong project with a valid code.
 
✓ Make decisions. Software can help you objectively determine the results 
of several possible courses of action. However, software can’t effectively 
take into account all the objective and subjective considerations that 
you must weigh before making a final decision.
 
✓ Create and sustain dynamic interpersonal relationships. Despite 
people’s fascination with chat rooms, e-mail, and other types of com-
puter-aided communication, computers don’t foster close, trusting rela-
tionships between people. If anything, technology makes relationships 
more difficult to develop because it removes your ability to see facial 
expressions and body language.
So how can computer software help you during the life of a project? This sec-
tion looks at what different types of software are available, how software can 
help you manage your project, and how to introduce software into your work 
environment.
Looking at your software options
When your project is sufficiently complex, you can use software for a wide 
variety of tasks, including storing and retrieving important information, 
analyzing and updating that information, and preparing presentations and 
reports that describe the information and results of the analyses.
The available software falls into two categories: stand-alone specialty soft-
ware and integrated project-management software. Each type has benefits 
and drawbacks, as I discuss in the following sections.
Stand-alone specialty software
Stand-alone specialty software consists of separate packages that perform one 
or two functions very well. The following types of specialized software can 
support your project planning and performance:

307
 Chapter 16: Using Technology to Up Your Game
 
✓ Word processing: Useful for preparing the narrative portions of project 
plans, maintaining a project log, creating progress reports, and preparing 
written project communications (Microsoft Office Word, for example)
 
✓ Business graphics and presentation: Useful for preparing overheads 
and slide shows for project presentations and developing charts and art-
work for written reports and publications (Microsoft Office PowerPoint, 
for example)
 
✓ Spreadsheet: Useful for storing moderate amounts of data, performing 
repetitive calculations, running statistical analyses, and presenting infor-
mation in chart formats (Microsoft Office Excel, for example)
 
✓ Database: Useful for storing and retrieving large amounts of data for 
analysis and presentation (Microsoft Office Access, for example)
 
✓ Accounting: Useful for keeping records of project income and expenses 
and producing a variety of descriptive and comparative reports (Intuit 
QuickBooks, for example)
 
✓ Time and information management: Useful for scheduling your calen-
dar, maintaining a to-do list, keeping your address book, and managing 
your e-mail activities (Microsoft Office Outlook, for example)
Note: Many manufacturers offer software packages in the preceding catego-
ries. However, because so many of the organizations I’ve worked with use 
Microsoft software, I’ve noted examples of Microsoft software packages in 
the different categories. You may have heard of them before, and, if you 
don’t have them already, you can easily install them on your computer.
 
Initially, specialty packages performed one or two functions very well. As 
they’ve evolved, however, they’ve expanded to include capabilities that sup-
port their primary functions. For example,
 
✓ Word-processing packages now possess some spreadsheet, business-
graphics, and database capabilities.
 
✓ Spreadsheet packages now have some business-graphics and word-
processing capabilities.
 
✓ Database packages now have some spreadsheet and word-processing 
capabilities.
In general, specialty packages offer the following benefits:
 
✓ They offer powerful capabilities in their areas of specialty. For exam-
ple, a business-graphics-and-presentation package makes it relatively 
easy to prepare professional-quality presentations that effectively share 
information and stimulate your audience’s interest.
 
✓ You most likely have several packages already on your computer. 
Having these packages already available means you can use them imme-
diately for no additional cost.

308
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 
 
✓ People probably know how to use many of the common specialty 
packages. As a result, people are more apt to use them and use them 
correctly. Also, you save time and money because people don’t require 
special training to use them.
 
Keep in mind that these packages have the following potential drawbacks:
 
✓ They’re likely to encourage piecemeal approaches to project planning 
and control, which may omit certain key steps. You can use a business-
graphics package to draw a Gantt chart (see Chapter 5). However, ensur-
ing that your schedule is feasible requires you to consider the effect of 
activity interdependencies when you prepare it. A business-graphics 
package can’t perform that function for you.
 
✓ They don’t integrate easily. For example, you can depict your project’s 
schedule in a Gantt chart in a graphics package and display personnel 
hours over the duration of each task in a spreadsheet. However, if a 
team member is unexpectedly out for a week, you have to make separate 
changes by revising the person’s hours in the spreadsheet and then 
changing the Gantt chart in the graphics package to reflect new activity 
start and end dates. Even though some programs can share data directly 
with other programs, this process is often cumbersome.
Integrated project-management software
Integrated project-management software combines database, spreadsheet, 
graphics, and word-processing capabilities to support many of the activities 
normally associated with planning and performing your project. An example 
of an integrated package is Microsoft Office Project, although hundreds of 
such packages of all shapes and sizes are on the market today.
A typical integrated project-management package allows you to
 
✓ Create a hierarchical list of activities and their components.
 
✓ Define and store key information about your project, activities, and 
resources.
 
✓ Define activity interdependencies (see Chapter 5 for more information 
on activity interdependencies).
 
✓ Develop schedules by considering activity durations, activity interde-
pendencies, and resource requirements and availability.
 
✓ Display your plan for performing project activities in a network diagram 
(see Chapter 5).
 
✓ Display a schedule in Gantt-chart and table formats (see Chapter 5).
 
✓ Assign people to work on project activities for specific levels of effort at 
certain times.
 
✓ Schedule other resources for project activities at specified times.

309
 Chapter 16: Using Technology to Up Your Game
 
✓ Determine your overall project budget (see Chapter 7 for how to pre-
pare project budgets).
 
✓ Determine the effect of changes on the project’s schedule and resources.
 
✓ Monitor activity start and end dates and milestone dates.
 
✓ Monitor person-hours and resource costs.
 
✓ Present planning and tracking information in a wide array of graphs and 
tables.
As you may have guessed, integrated project-management packages offer 
benefits as well as drawbacks. The benefits include the following:
 
✓ The package’s functions are linked. For example, if you enter personnel 
requirements one time, the program considers them when developing 
schedule and resource budgets and when reporting project progress.
 
✓ Packages typically have a variety of predesigned report templates. 
Having predesigned report templates allows you to use formats that are 
proven to be effective. It also saves you time and money when preparing 
and distributing your reports.
 
Integrated project-management packages also have their drawbacks:
 
✓ The package may not be immediately available. If it isn’t currently 
available, you have to devote time and money to buy and install the soft-
ware before you can use it to support project planning and control.
 
✓ Most people require training to become comfortable with the package. 
Training takes additional time and money.
 
✓ Having a wide range of capabilities in a software package doesn’t 
guarantee that you’ll use them correctly. Remember the old adage: 
Garbage in, garbage out. Even the most advanced software package can’t 
help your project if people don’t submit accurate and timely data.
 
If you decide to use an integrated project-management package, consider the 
following factors when choosing your program:
 
✓ Types and formats of reports: Choose a package that supports your 
reports and means of reporting with minimum customization.
 
✓ Your team members’ general comfort and familiarity with computers 
and software: Will they take the time and effort to learn and then use 
the package? Having a package with state-of-the-art analysis and report-
ing capabilities is no help if people don’t know how to use it.
 
✓ Your organization’s present software: If several software packages are 
equal in most aspects, choose a package that’s already available and in 
use because team members most likely have experience with it.

310
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 
 
✓ Your organization’s existing systems to record labor hours and 
expenses: If your organization has such systems, consider a package that 
can easily interface with them. If the organization doesn’t have these sys-
tems, consider a package that can store the information you need.
 
✓ The project environment in your organization: What’s the size of the 
human-resource pool for projects, the number and typical size of projects, 
and so on? Choose a package that has the necessary capacity and speed.
 
✓ Software used by clients and companies you work with: Choosing a 
package that allows you to communicate and coordinate easily with 
your customers’ and collaborators’ software saves you time and money.

for more information on effectively using this software’s capability.
Helping your software perform at its best
No matter which type of project-management software you choose (either 
stand-alone specialty software or integrated project-management software), 
your project’s success depends on how well you coordinate and support 
your project planning and control activities. Table 16-1 illustrates the activi-
ties that software can support, the types of software that can provide the 
support, and how you can ensure that the activity is performed correctly.
Project-Portfolio Management software: 
Raising the bar on project management
Most integrated project-management soft-
ware packages support the planning, tracking, 
and reporting of an individual project. Project-
Portfolio Management software, however, is 
special because it also
 ✓ Supports the assigning and tracking of 
people to activities on more than one project
 ✓ Takes into account interproject activity 
dependencies when determining different 
schedule possibilities
 ✓ Tracks and reports the progress and 
accomplishments of numerous projects 
simultaneously
 ✓ Supports communication throughout the 
organization regarding the planning and 
performance of different projects
Consider using Project-Portfolio Management 
software to support project planning and control 
when your organization meets these criteria: 
 ✓ It has several large, cross-departmental 
projects underway.
 ✓ It staffs these projects from a common 
resource pool.
 ✓ It has well-established project-manage-
ment and data-collection practices and 
procedures.

Introducing project-management 
software into your operations
 
Before you rush out and buy any project-management software, plan how to 
maximize its capabilities and avoid associated pitfalls. Do the following to help 
you select and install your software:
 
✓ Be sure you have a firm grasp of project planning and control 
approaches before you consider any software.
 
✓ See what software other groups in your organization are using or have 
used; find out what they like, what they don’t like, and why.
 
✓ If possible, ask someone who already has a copy of the software 
whether you can spend a few minutes exploring its operation.
 
✓ After the package is on your computer, load a simple project or a small 
part of a larger project to practice with (that is, enter the activities, 
durations, interdependencies, resources, and so on).

313
 Chapter 16: Using Technology to Up Your Game
 
✓ Use only a few of the program’s capabilities at first (determine the effect 
of small changes on your schedule, print out some simple reports, and 
so on); use more capabilities as you get more comfortable with the soft-
ware and feel the need for them.
 
✓ Consider attending a formal training program after you’ve become com-
fortable accessing the software’s different capabilities.
After you’ve undertaken these steps, you can effectively use software to sup-
port your project planning and control activities. On an ongoing basis, ensure 
that you obtain all updates and changes to the software, and consider pur-
chasing software upgrades that introduce significant new capabilities.
Making Use of E-Mail
Before the advent of e-mail, people consistently told me that the two most 
common frustrations in their daily routine were unproductive meetings and 
playing telephone tag. Is it any wonder that people embraced e-mail as soon 
as it hit the workplace?
Because e-mail is so common, I don’t devote too much time to it in this book. 
However, this section briefly looks at its pros and cons, its appropriate uses 
with your project team, and ways to use it to your advantage.
Distinguishing the pros and cons of e-mail
E-mail is a fast and convenient means of one-way, written communication. It 
has many desirable qualities when it comes to project management:
 
✓ The sender and receiver don’t have to be present at the time of com-
munication. You can write an e-mail message whenever you want, and 
your recipient can read it at his convenience.
 
✓ The sender and receiver don’t have to be in the same place. You can 
send your message anywhere from Iowa to Tibet.
 
✓ Your message is delivered quickly. Relaying your message doesn’t 
depend on delivery schedules, work-hours, or weather conditions.
 
✓ E-mail serves as written documentation. The receiver can read your 
message several times to clarify its meaning, and it serves as a reminder 
that you have shared the information.
 
✓ You can store e-mail on computer hard disks, Zip disks, USB flash 
drives, CDs, or DVDs rather than in hard copy. This capability saves 
you space and money and makes retrieval easier.

314
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 
 
Unfortunately, e-mail also has the following drawbacks:
 
✓ People may not read it. I often meet people who receive 50 to 100 
e-mails each day! They readily admit to scanning the first few lines to 
decide whether a message is worth reading. Some people just read the 
sender’s name to decide whether to read any further.
 
✓ The medium doesn’t provide real-time interaction between sender 
and receiver. The receiver may have difficulty correctly interpreting 
the message because she can’t quickly ask questions, check infer-
ences, or ask you to paraphrase the message. You can try to clarify any 
issues through subsequent e-mails, but people often lose interest in 
the process.
 
✓ Communication is limited to the exchange of words. The sender’s 
nonverbal cues (such as facial expressions, body language, and tone of 
voice) are lost.
 
✓ Readers can often misinterpret the content or intent. E-mail has a 
growing dictionary of meanings associated with different modes of 
expression. (For an example, check out the nearby sidebar, “Reading 
between the lines of your e-mails.”) Unfortunately, when people’s e-mail 
recipients pick up these meanings informally, the e-mails may convey 
the wrong messages.
Reading between the lines of your e-mails
An old adage claims “It’s not what you say — 
it’s how you say it that counts.” In face-to-
face communication, people often pay more 
attention to the speaker’s tone of voice, facial 
expressions, and body language than to his 
words. Because e-mail can’t transmit nonver-
bal cues, people have developed a new vocab-
ulary to share their nonverbal messages with 
their e-mail recipients. Unfortunately, incorrect 
use of this vocabulary can send the wrong mes-
sage, creating misunderstandings and hard 
feelings.
A client once told me of a time he sent an 
e-mail to a coworker. To emphasize a particular 
message, he typed it in bold characters. But 
the recipient never responded and actually 
appeared to ignore him when they passed in the 
hallways. After several days, my client sought 
the person out and asked whether there was 
a problem. The coworker said he was upset 
and insulted that my client had yelled at him in 
his e-mail. My client expressed complete sur-
prise and confusion and asked how an e-mail 
could suggest a person was yelling. Apparently, 
some people equate boldface typing to yelling. 
Fortunately, my client was able to discover the 
misunderstanding and correct it. But it makes 
you wonder how often such misunderstandings 
go unnoticed and unaddressed!

 Chapter 16: Using Technology to Up Your Game
Using e-mail appropriately
E-mail can be an effective component of a comprehensive communication 
system for your project team. For example, you can use e-mail to confirm oral 
discussions and agreements. In these instances, you want a written message 
to stand on its own with no interactive discussion or explanation. If a recipi-
ent needs to ask questions, the written message hasn’t documented the infor-
mation clearly and accurately.
You can also use e-mail to share factual information that requires little or 
no clarification. Write simple messages using straightforward language. Tell 
recipients how they can reach you if they have any questions.
 
Take note that e-mail can’t be the exclusive means of communication to do any 
of the following tasks:
 
✓ Brainstorm to analyze problems and develop new ideas. Use e-mail to 
announce the brainstorming session, invite people to attend, identify 
the topic(s) you’ll explore, and provide relevant background material 
for people to review before the session. Use e-mail to share a summary 
of the results and future actions. But conduct the actual interchange of 
ideas in a face-to-face session.
 
✓ Build and sustain team members’ trust and commitment. Even though 
you use e-mail to inform team members of each other’s background and 
experience, commitments, and accomplishments, be sure you provide 
sufficient opportunities for face-to-face meetings so team members 
become familiar and comfortable with each other.
 
✓ Share an important message. Perhaps you can share the message ini-
tially through e-mail, but follow up with phone calls and in-person meet-
ings to emphasize its importance and ensure that your recipients have 
correctly understood its content.
Getting the most out of your e-mail
When used correctly, e-mail can be a valuable tool for clear, timely, conve-
nient, and inexpensive communications. Do the following to get the most 
from your team e-mail communications:
 
✓ Be concise. Use clear, measurable words, and avoid technical jargon 
and acronyms when possible.
 
✓ Read your e-mail before you send it. People’s impressions of you, your 
ideas, and your attitude are strongly affected by what you say and how 
you say it. Take a moment to proof your e-mail message before you hit 
Send. Make sure you’ve made no typos.

316
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 
 
✓ Anticipate miscommunications. Put yourself in your audience’s shoes. 
How might they misinterpret your message? What additional informa-
tion might they want to have? Have you been clear about how you want 
them to respond to your message? In other words, minimize the need for 
extra e-mails back and forth to raise questions and clarify points by writ-
ing one, well-thought-out e-mail.
 
✓ Be sure people have received it. If possible, program your system to 
let you know automatically when your audience has opened your e-mail. 
Otherwise, ask the receiver to verify that he’s received the message via 
a return e-mail, a phone call, or a quick face-to-face conversation.
 
✓ Keep a copy of important e-mails. Maintain a file of important messages 
you’ve sent. I keep computerized records of all sent e-mails on an exter-
nal hard drive, and I keep paper copies of especially important e-mails. 
These copies confirm the information, date, and recipients. (Chapter 13 
has more on communicating with your project audience.)
Supporting Virtual Teams with 
Communication Technology
The globalization of today’s businesses creates a greater need for people 
around the world to work together on projects. This lack of proximity cre-
ates unique challenges for encouraging successful team performance. Lucky 
for you and me, today’s technology can support the communication needs of 
these virtual teams.
 
A virtual project team is a group of people who work together across geo-
graphic, time, and organizational boundaries to accomplish a common set of 
goals and objectives. Although the needs of a virtual project team are the 
same as those of more conventional teams, many processes and resources 
used by conventional teams aren’t available to the virtual team. Only through 
creative use of the communication technology available can virtual teams per-
form at peak capacity.
High-performance team members on both virtual and conventional teams 
must successfully accomplish the following tasks:
 
✓ Share project and team-related information in a timely and accurate 
manner.
 
✓ Create and sustain trusting and productive interpersonal relationships.
 
✓ Effectively collaborate to perform project work.
Each of these tasks requires effective and timely communication. But, as vir-
tual teams approach these activities, they face these unique challenges:

317
 Chapter 16: Using Technology to Up Your Game
 
✓ Members may never meet each other in person. Becoming familiar with 
and trusting each other is more difficult; the use of nonverbal signals 
and body language when communicating is severely limited.
 
✓ Members may have different primary languages. This challenge 
increases the chances that people may incorrectly interpret a message.
 
✓ Members may come from different organizational and cultural envi-
ronments. People’s work styles and communication practices may 
differ.
 
✓ Members may be in different time zones. People may not be available 
to interact with each other during certain time periods.
Today’s communication technology can help you and your virtual team 
address these challenges (see Table 16-2 for specific ways that today’s tech-
nology can support communications on a virtual team).

Monitoring Project Performance 
with Earned Value Management
In This Chapter
▶ Getting a grip on Earned Value Management and all the terms and formulas that go with it
▶ Understanding the how-to of Earned Value Management
▶ Approximating an activity’s earned value
B
ecause you’re reading this chapter, I assume you’re looking for a way 
to assess your ongoing project performance. Earned Value Management 
(EVM), formerly called Earned Value Analysis (EVA), is a technique that helps 
determine your project’s schedule status and cost status from your resource 
expenditures alone. EVM is particularly useful for identifying potential prob-
lems on larger projects.
To get the most from this chapter, you need to have some prior experience 
or knowledge in project management. This chapter helps you better under-
stand EVM by defining it, discussing how to determine and interpret vari-
ances, and showing you how to use it in your project.
Defining Earned Value Management
Monitoring your project’s performance involves determining whether you’re 
on, ahead of, or behind schedule and on, under, or over budget. But just 
comparing your actual expenditures with your budget can’t tell you whether 
you’re on, under, or over budget — which is where EVM comes in. In this sec-
tion, I explain the basics of EVM and the steps involved in conducting an EVM 
analysis to determine your project’s schedule and cost performance.

320
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 
Understanding EVM terms and formulas
Suppose you’re three months into your project and you’ve spent $50,000. 
According to your plan, you shouldn’t have spent $50,000 until the end of the 
fourth month of your project. You appear to be over budget at this point, but 
you can’t tell for sure. Either of the following situations may have produced 
these results:
 
✓ You may have performed all the scheduled work but paid more than you 
expected to for it — which means you’re on schedule but over budget 
(not a good situation).
 
✓ You may have performed more work than you scheduled but paid 
exactly what you expected to for it — which means you’re on budget 
and ahead of schedule (a good situation).
In fact, many other situations may also have produced these same results, 
but you probably don’t have the time or the motivation to go through each 
possible situation to figure out which one matches yours. That’s where EVM 
comes in handy. Evaluating your project’s performance using EVM can tell 
you how much of the difference between planned and actual expenditures is 
the result of under- or overspending and how much is the result of perform-
ing the project work faster or slower than planned. In the following sections, I 
describe some terms and formulas you need to know to use EVM.
Spelling out some important terms
 
The basic premise of EVM is that the value of a piece of work is equal to the 
amount of funds budgeted to complete it. As part of EVM, you use the follow-
ing information to assess your schedule and cost performance throughout 
your project (see Figure 17-1 for an example):

Chapter 17: Monitoring Project Performance with Earned Value Management
 
✓ Planned value (PV): The approved budget for the work scheduled to 
be completed by a specified date; also referred to as the budgeted cost 
of work scheduled (BCWS). The total PV of a task is equal to the task’s 
budget at completion (BAC) — the total amount budgeted for the task.
 
✓ Earned value (EV): The approved budget for the work actually com-
pleted by the specified date; also referred to as the budgeted cost of work 
performed (BCWP).
 
✓ Actual cost (AC): The costs actually incurred for the work completed by 
the specified date; also referred to as the actual cost of work performed 
(ACWP).
 
To describe your project’s schedule and cost performance with EVM, you use 
the following indicators:
 
✓ Schedule variance (SV): The difference between the amounts budgeted 
for the work you actually did and for the work you planned to do. The 
SV shows whether and by how much your work is ahead of or behind 
your approved schedule.
 
✓ Cost variance (CV): The difference between the amount budgeted 
and the amount actually spent for the work performed. The CV shows 
whether and by how much you’re under or over your approved budget.
 
✓ Schedule performance index (SPI): The ratio of the approved budget 
for the work performed to the approved budget for the work planned. 
The SPI reflects the relative amount the project is ahead of or behind 
schedule, sometimes referred to as the project’s schedule efficiency. 
You can use the SPI to date to project the schedule performance for the 
remainder of the task.
 
✓ Cost performance index (CPI): The ratio of the approved budget for 
work performed to what you actually spent for the work. The CPI 
reflects the relative value of work done compared to the amount paid 
for it, sometimes referred to as the project’s cost efficiency. You can 
use the CPI to date to project the cost performance for the remainder 
of the task.
Figure 17-2 shows the key information in an EVM analysis. In this figure, the dif-
ference between planned and actual expenditures up to the date of the report 
is the result of both a schedule delay and cost savings. You can approximate 
the amount of time you’re behind or ahead of the approved schedule by draw-
ing a line from the intersection of the EV and assessment date lines parallel to 
the x-axis to the PV line. Doing so in Figure 17-2 suggests that the project being 
described by the graph is about one month behind schedule.
Defining the formulas of EVM performance descriptors
Schedule and cost variances and performance indicators are defined math-
ematically as follows:

322
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 
Schedule variance (SV) = Earned value (EV) – Planned value (PV)
Cost variance (CV) = Earned value (EV) – Actual cost (AC)
Schedule performance index (SPI) = Earned value (EV) ÷ Planned value (PV)
Cost performance index (CPI) = Earned value (EV) ÷ Actual cost (AC)

Tables 17-1 and 17-2 illustrate that a positive variance, or a performance indi-
cator greater than 1.0, indicates something desirable (that is, you’re either 
under budget or ahead of schedule) and a negative variance, or a perfor-
mance indicator less than 1.0, indicates something undesirable (you’re either 
over budget or behind schedule).

Chapter 17: Monitoring Project Performance with Earned Value Management
Last but not least: Projecting total expenditures at completion
 
The final step when assessing task performance to date is to update what you 
expect your total expenditures will be upon task completion. Specifically, you 
want to determine the following:
 
✓ Estimate at completion (EAC): Your estimate today of the total cost of 
the task
 
✓ Estimate to complete (ETC): Your estimate of the amount of funds 
required to complete all work still remaining to be done on the task
You can use the following two approaches to calculate the EAC:
 
✓ Method 1: Assume that the cost performance for the remainder of the 
task will revert to what was originally budgeted.
 
 EAC = Approved budget for the entire task – Cost variance for the work 
done to date on the task
 
  
= Budget at completion (BAC) + Actual cost (AC) – Earned value (EV)
 
✓ Method 2: Assume that the cost performance for the remainder of the 
task will be the same as what it has been for the work done to date.
 
 EAC = Budget at completion (BAC) ÷ Cumulative cost performance 
index (CPI)
Whether you use Method 1 or Method 2 to calculate EAC, ETC is determined 
as follows:
ETC = Budget at completion (BAC) – Actual costs to date (AC)
Looking at a simple example
 
The terms and definitions associated with EVM (see the preceding section) 
are easier to understand when you consider an example. Suppose you’re plan-
ning to conduct a series of telephone interviews. Your interview guide is 
ready, and each phone interview is independent of the others. You state the 
following in your project plan:
 
✓ Your project will last ten months.
 
✓ You will conduct 100 interviews each month.
 
✓ You will spend $300 to conduct each interview.
 
✓ Your total project budget is $300,000.

324
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 
During your first month, you do the following:
 
✓ Conduct 75 interviews
 
✓ Spend a total of $15,000
Because you planned to conduct 100 interviews in the first month and you 
only conducted 75, you’re behind schedule. But, because you planned to 
spend $300 per interview and you spent only $200 ($15,000 ÷ 75 interviews = 
$200 per interview), you’re under budget. To calculate and then interpret the 
EVM information associated with this example, follow these steps:
 
1. Determine the planned value (PV), earned value (EV), and actual costs 
(AC) for the month as follows:
 
 PV = Amount budgeted for the 100 interviews you planned to conduct in 
the first month
 
  
= 100 interviews × $300 per interview = $30,000
 
 EV = Amount budgeted for the 75 interviews you actually conducted in 
the first month
 
  
= 75 interviews × $300 per interview = $22,500
 
 AC = Actual costs for the first month = $15,000
 
2. Determine your schedule variance (SV), cost variance (CV), schedule 
performance index (SPI), and cost performance index (CPI) for the 
month as follows:
 
 SV = EV – PV = $22,500 – $30,000 = –$7,500
 
 CV = EV – AC = $22,500 – $15,000 = $7,500
 
 SPI = EV ÷ PV = $22,500 ÷ $30,000 = 0.75
 
 CPI = EV ÷ AC = $22,500 ÷ $15,000 = 1.50
 
 The SPI and CPI make sense when you look at the actual numbers for 
the month. You originally planned to conduct 100 interviews in the first 
month, but you finished only 75, which means you accomplished 0.75 of 
the work scheduled for the month, just as the SPI indicates.
 
 You originally planned to spend $300 per interview, but in the first 
month you spent only $200 per interview ($15,000 in actual costs ÷ 75 
interviews conducted). So, for the interviews conducted in the first 
month, you received a benefit equal to 1.50 times the money you spent, 
just as the CPI indicates.
Finally, you calculate your revised estimate at completion (EAC), as follows:
 
✓ Method 1: Assume that the remaining work is performed at the origi-
nally budgeted rate.
 
 EAC = BAC + AC – EV = $300,000 + $15,000 – $22,500 = $292,500

325
Chapter 17: Monitoring Project Performance with Earned Value Management
 
 If you keep the $7,500 cost savings from the 75 interviews performed 
in the first month and do the remaining 925 interviews for the $300 per 
interview originally budgeted, you’ll spend $292,500 to do the 1,000 
interviews.
 
✓ Method 2: Assume that the remaining work is performed at the same 
CPI as the work performed to date.
 
 EAC = BAC ÷ Cumulative CPI = $300,000 ÷ 1.50 = $200,000
 
 In other words, if you continue to perform your interviews for $200 each 
rather than the planned $300 each, you’ll spend two-thirds of your total 
planned budget to complete all 1,000 interviews.
 
Although you don’t need a formal EVM analysis on a project this simple, in a 
project with 50 to 100 activities or more, an EVM analysis can help identify gen-
eral trends in your project’s cost and schedule performances. The earlier you 
identify such trends, the more easily you can address them when necessary.
Determining the reasons 
for observed variances
Positive or negative cost or schedule variances indicate that your project 
performance isn’t going exactly as you planned. After you determine that a 
variance exists, you need to figure out what’s causing it so you can take cor-
rective actions (if the variance is negative) or continue what you’ve been 
doing (if the variance is positive).
Possible reasons for positive or negative cost variances include the following:
 
✓ Your project requires more or less work to complete a task than you 
originally planned.
 
✓ Work outside the approved scope was performed.
 
✓ The people performing the work are more or less productive than 
planned.
 
✓ The actual unit costs of labor or materials are more or less than 
planned.
 
✓ Resources used on other projects were incorrectly recorded to your 
project, or resources from your project were incorrectly recorded to 
other projects.
 
✓ Actual organization indirect rates are higher or lower than you originally 
planned. (See Chapter 7 for a discussion of indirect rates and how they 
can affect your project expenditures.)

326
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 
Possible reasons for positive or negative schedule variances include the 
following:
 
✓ Work is running ahead of or behind schedule.
 
✓ The project requires more or less work than you originally planned.
 
✓ People performing the work are more or less productive than planned.
The How-To: Applying Earned Value 
Management to Your Project
If your project is fairly complex, you may consider using EVM to help control 
performance. By providing cost and schedule performance assessments of 
both the total project and its major parts, EVM allows you to identify the 
likely problem areas so you can take the most effective corrective actions.
The following example presents a more realistic illustration of how EVM can 
support insightful analysis of your project’s performance.
 
Suppose the Acme Company has awarded a contract for the production of two 
specialized and complex corporate brochures to Copies ‘R’ Us. The contract 
calls for Copies ‘R’ Us to produce 500 copies of Brochure A and 1,000 copies of 
Brochure B. It further states that Copies ‘R’ Us will produce Brochure A at the 
rate of 100 per month and Brochure B at the rate of 250 per month. Production 
of Brochure A is to start on January 1, and production of Brochure B is to start 
on February 1.

Your job is to figure out your schedule and cost performances to date and 
to update your forecast of the total amount you’ll spend for both brochures. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. Determine the planned value (PV), earned value (EV), and actual cost 
(AC) for Brochure A through March 31 as follows:
 
 PV = $200 per brochure × 100 brochures per month × 3 months = $60,000
 
 EV = $200 per brochure × 150 brochures = $30,000
 
 AC = $45,000
 
2. Determine the schedule variance (SV), cost variance (CV), schedule 
performance index (SPI), and cost performance index (CPI) for the 
production of Brochure A through March 31 as follows:
 
 SV = EV – PV = $30,000 – $60,000 = –$30,000
 
 CV = EV – AC = $30,000 – $45,000 = –$15,000
 
 SPI = EV ÷ PV = $30,000 ÷ $60,000 = 0.50
 
 CPI = EV ÷ AC = $30,000 ÷ $45,000 = 0.67
 
 Your analysis reveals that you produced only half of the copies of 
Brochure A you thought you would and that each brochure cost you 1.5 
times the amount you had planned to spend (1 ÷ CPI = 1 ÷ 0.67 = 1.5; also, 
actual cost per brochure ÷ planned cost per brochure = [$45,000 expended ÷ 
150 brochures produced] ÷ $200 per brochure = 300 ÷ 200 = 1.5).
 
3. Determine the planned value (PV), earned value (EV), and actual cost 
(AC) for Brochure B through March 31 as follows:
 
 PV = $100 per brochure × 250 brochures per month × 2 months = $50,000
 
 EV = $100 per brochure × 600 brochures = $60,000
 
 AC = $30,000

328
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 
 
4. Determine the schedule variance (SV), cost variance (CV), schedule 
performance index (SPI), and cost performance index (CPI) for the 
production of Brochure B through March 31 as follows:
 
 SV = EV – PV = $60,000 – $50,000 = $10,000
 
 CV = EV – AC = $60,000 – $30,000 = $30,000
 
 SPI = EV ÷ PV = $60,000 ÷ $50,000 = 1.20
 
 CPI = EV ÷ AC = $60,000 ÷ $30,000 = 2.00
 
 Your analysis reveals that production of Brochure B is 20 percent ahead 
of schedule and 50 percent under budget (1 ÷ CPI = 1 ÷ 2 = 0.5; also, 
[$30,000 expended ÷ 600 brochures produced] ÷ $100 per brochure = 50 ÷ 
100 = 0.5).
 
5. Forecast the estimate at completion (EAC) for Brochure A.
 
 Method 1: Assume the remaining work is performed at the originally 
budgeted rate.
 
 EAC = BAC + AC – EV = $100,000 + $45,000 – $30,000 = $115,000
 
 Method 2: Assume the remaining work is performed at the same CPI 
as the work performed to date.
 
 EAC = BAC ÷ Cumulative CPI = $100,000 ÷ 0.67 = $150,000
 
 In other words, if the remaining 350 copies of Brochure A are produced 
for the originally planned cost of $200 per copy, the total cost to pro-
duce the entire 500 copies will be $115,000. If the remaining 350 copies 
of Brochure A are produced for the same $300 per copy cost as the first 
150, the total cost to produce the entire 600 will be $150,000.
 
6. Forecast the estimate at completion (EAC) for Brochure B.
 
 Method 1: Assume the remaining work is performed at the originally 
budgeted rate.
 
 EAC = BAC + AC – EV = $100,000 + $30,000 – $60,000 = $70,000
 
 Method 2: Assume the remaining work is performed at the same CPI 
as the work performed to date.
 
 EAC = BAC ÷ Cumulative CPI = $100,000 ÷ 2.00 = $50,000
 
 In other words, if the remaining 400 copies of Brochure B are produced 
for the originally planned cost of $100 per copy, the total cost to pro-
duce the entire 1,000 copies will be $70,000. If the remaining 400 copies 
of Brochure B are produced for the same $50 per copy cost as the first 
150, the total cost to produce the entire 1,000 will be $50,000.

7. Determine the overall status of your project by adding together the 
schedule variances (SV), the cost variances (CV), and the updated esti-
mates at completion (EAC) for Brochures A and B.
 
 Project SV = –$30,000 + $10,000 = –$20,000
 
 Project CV = –$15,000 + $30,000 = $15,000
 
 Method 1: Assume the remaining work is performed at the originally 
budgeted rate.
 
 EAC = $115,000 + $70,000 = $185,000
 
 Method 2: Assume the remaining work is performed at the same CPI 
as the work performed to date.
 
 EAC for the project = $150,000 + $50,000 = $200,000

If project production rates and costs remain the same until all the required 
brochures are produced (this is the Method 2 used to develop the EACs):
 
✓ You’ll finish on budget. Table 17-5 shows that EAC for the project will 
be $200,000, the amount originally budgeted for the whole project.
 
✓ You’ll finish five months late. Because Brochure A is being produced 
at only half the anticipated rate, finishing all of them will take twice the 
time of five months that was originally planned.

330
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 
Determining a Task’s Earned Value
The key to a meaningful EVM analysis lies in the accuracy of your estimates 
of EV. To determine EV, you must estimate
 
✓ How much of a task you’ve completed to date
 
✓ How much of the task’s total budget you planned to spend for the 
amount of work you’ve performed
If you assume that the amount of a task’s total budget that should be spent to 
complete a portion of the task is directly proportional to the amount of the 
task completed, you should spend 60 percent of the total task budget to com-
plete 60 percent of the task.
For tasks with separate components, like printing brochures or conducting 
telephone surveys, determining how much of a task you’ve completed is 
straightforward. However, if your task entails an integrated work or thought 
process with no easily divisible parts (such as designing the brochure), the 
best you can do is make an educated guess.
To estimate the EV in your project, you can use one of the three following 
approaches (Figure 17-3 illustrates these commonly used approaches in dif-
ferent situations): 
 
✓ Percent-complete method: EV is the product of the fraction represent-
ing the amount of an activity that has been completed and the total 
budget for the activity.
 
 This method is potentially the most accurate if you correctly determine 
the fraction of the activity you have completed. However, because that 
estimate depends on your subjective judgment, this approach is also 
most vulnerable to errors or purposeful manipulation.
 
✓ Milestone method: EV is zero until you complete the activity, and it’s 
100 percent of the total activity budget after you complete it.
 
 The milestone method is the most conservative and the least accurate. 
You expect to spend some money while you’re working on the task. 
However, this method doesn’t allow you to declare EV greater than $0 
until you’ve completed the entire activity. Therefore, you’ll always 
appear over budget while you perform the activity.
 
✓ 50/50 method: EV is zero before you start the activity, 50 percent of the 
total activity budget after you start it, and 100 percent of the activity 
budget after you finish the activity.

331
Chapter 17: Monitoring Project Performance with Earned Value Management
 
 The 50/50 method is a closer approximation to reality than the mile-
stone method because you can declare an EV greater than $0 while you 
perform the task. However, this approximation can inadvertently mask 
overspending.
 
 For example, suppose you’ve spent $4,000 to complete 30 percent of a 
task with a $10,000 budget. Arguably, you should’ve spent about 30 per-
cent of the total task budget, or $3,000, to complete 30 percent of the 
work on the task, which means you’re $1,000 over budget. However, 
using the 50/50 method, you estimate the EV to be $5,000 (50 percent of 
the total budget for the task), which makes it appear that you’re $1,000 
under budget.
As you can see, the milestone method and 50/50 method allow you to approx-
imate EV without estimating the portion of a task that you’ve completed. 
Choosing which of the three methods to use for your project requires that 
you weigh the potential for accuracy against the possibility of subjective data 
resulting in misleading conclusions.

Figure 17-3 compares the accuracy of the three different methods for a simple 
example. Task 1.2 has three subtasks: 1.2.1, 1.2.2, and 1.2.3. For this illustra-
tion, assume the status of each subtask is as follows:
 
✓ Subtask 1.2.1 is complete.
 
✓ Subtask 1.2.2 is 75 percent complete.
 
✓ Subtask 1.2.3 is 20 percent complete.

332
Part V: Taking Your Project Management to the Next Level 
The EV of Task 1.2 is the sum of the EVs for each of the three subtasks that 
comprise Task 1.2. According to the percent-complete method, the actual 
EV should be $31,000. (Remember, you can use this method only if you can 
accurately estimate the percentage of the entire task that you’ve completed.) 
According to the milestone method, the actual EV is $10,000, and, according 
to the 50/50 method, it’s $35,000.
 
When you use either the 50/50 method or the milestone method, improve the 
accuracy of your EV estimates by defining your lowest-level activities to be 
relatively short, usually completed in two weeks or less (see Chapter 4 on 
Work Breakdown Structures). When you determine activity status for your 
progress assessments, most activities will not have started or will be finished, 
thereby increasing the accuracy of your EV estimates.

H
aving hundreds of pages of detailed information to 
guide you through your project’s ups and downs is 
nice. However, when a crisis hits, you may want to refer-
ence a few handy tips to head off a potential disaster.
Just like every For Dummies book, this part gives you tid-
bits of interesting information that you can access as 
needed. I share ten tips for how to plan a project and ten 
tips for how to be a better project manager.
And don’t stop there! This part also includes a helpful 
appendix. In it, I present the usual order for the planning 
and control activities that I discuss throughout this book.

Chapter 18
Ten Questions to Ask Yourself as 
You Plan Your Project
In This Chapter
▶ Clarifying your project’s purpose
▶ Describing outcomes, schedules, and resources
▶ Addressing the uncertainties
W
hen you begin a project, you always feel the pressure to jump in and 
start working immediately to meet the aggressive time schedules. 
Although you’re not exactly sure of where to start, you know you have the 
greatest chance of success if you plan out your project before you start the 
actual work. Answer the ten questions in this chapter to be sure you’ve com-
pletely identified all the work your project will require.
What’s the Purpose of Your Project?
 
An accurate appreciation of your project’s purpose can lead to better plans, a 
greater sense of team member commitment, and improved performance. As 
soon as you’re assigned to your project, get a clear and complete picture of its 
significance. You can do so by determining the following:
 
✓ What situation(s) led to your project?
 
✓ Who had the original idea?
 
✓ Who else hopes to benefit from it?
 
✓ What would happen if your project weren’t done?
See Chapters 2 and 3 for more details about clarifying a project’s purpose.

336
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Whom Do You Need to Involve?
Knowing early whom you need to involve allows you to plan for their partici-
pation at the appropriate stages in your project. Involving these people in a 
timely manner ensures that their input will be available when it’s needed and 
lets them know you value and respect their contributions.
As you determine who may play a role in your project’s success, categorize 
them as follows:
 
✓ Drivers: People looking for your project’s results
 
✓ Supporters: People who can help your project succeed
 
✓ Observers: People interested in your project
After you have this comprehensive list, decide whom you need to involve and 
when and how you want to involve them. (See Chapters 3, 9, and 10 for more 
information on identifying project audiences.)
What Results Will You Produce?
Specify all the results you expect your project to achieve. Be sure that you 
clearly describe each product, service, or impact; make the outcomes mea-
surable and include performance targets. Confirm that your project’s drivers 
believe these outcomes meet their needs and expectations (see Chapter 3 for 
more about project drivers). See Chapter 2 for more discussion about fram-
ing your project objectives.
What Constraints Must You Satisfy?
 
Identify all information, processes, and guidelines that may restrict your proj-
ect activities and your performance. When you know your constraints, you 
can plan to minimize their effects on your project. Distinguish between the 
following:
 
✓ Limitations: Restrictions that people outside your project team set
 
✓ Needs: Restrictions that you and your project’s team members establish
Chapter 2 has more about project constraints and ways to overcome them.

337
 Chapter 18: Ten Questions to Ask Yourself as You Plan Your Project
What Assumptions Are You Making?
 
As soon as you begin thinking about your project, document all assumptions 
you make about it — after all, each of those assumptions can lead to one or 
more project risks that you may choose to plan for in advance. Continue 
adding to your list of assumptions as you develop the different parts of your 
project plan. Update your plans whenever an assumption changes or you find 
out its actual value. See Chapter 2 for further details about project assump-
tions and Chapter 8 for a lot more information about project risks.
What Work Has to Be Done?
Identify all the activities required to produce your project’s deliverables so 
that you can assign responsibilities for them, develop schedules, estimate 
resource needs, give specific tasks to team members, and monitor your proj-
ect’s performance. For each activity, specify the following:
 
✓ The work to be done: The processes and steps that each activity entails
 
✓ Inputs: All people, facilities, equipment, supplies, raw materials, funds, 
and information necessary to perform each activity
 
✓ Results you expect: Products, services, situations, or other deliverables 
that you expect each activity to produce
 
✓ Interdependencies and relationships: Activities that you must complete 
before you can start the next one; activities you can start after you’ve 
completed the current one
 
✓ Durations: The number of work periods required to perform each activity
See Chapter 4 for information on describing project work.
When Does Each Activity Start and End?
Develop a detailed schedule with clearly defined activities and frequent 
intermediate milestones. Having this information on hand allows you to give 
team members precise guidance on when to perform their assignments. This 
information also supports your ongoing monitoring and control of work in 
progress. Take the following into account when you create your schedule:
 
✓ Duration: The number of work periods required to perform each indi-
vidual activity

338
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Interdependencies: What you must finish before you can begin your 
activity
 
✓ Resource availability: When you need particular resources and when 
they’re available
See Chapter 5 for more information on how to develop a project schedule.
Who Will Perform the Project Work?
 
Knowing who will perform each task and how much effort they’ll have to 
devote allows you to plan for their availability and more accurately estimate 
the overall project budget. Specify the following information for all people 
who need to work on your project:
 
✓ Their names, position descriptions or titles, and the skills and knowl-
edge they need to do the assignment
 
✓ The specific roles each person will have on an activity when more than 
one person will work on the same activity, as well as how they can coor-
dinate their efforts
 
✓ The level of effort each person has to invest
 
✓ The exact time when people will do their work if they will work less than 
full time on an activity
Consult with the people who’ll perform the project tasks to develop this 
information. See Chapter 6 for help with estimating personnel requirements.
What Other Resources Do You Need?
Identify all equipment, facilities, services, supplies, and funds that you need 
to perform your project work. Specify how much of each resource you need 
and when. Chapter 7 has more on how to identify nonpersonnel resources.
What Can Go Wrong?
Identify those parts of your project that may not go according to plan. Decide 
which risks pose the greatest dangers to your project’s success, and develop 
plans to minimize their negative effects. See Chapter 8 for information on 
how to address project risks.

Chapter 19
Ten Tips for Being a 
Better Project Manager
In This Chapter
▶ Being proactive and looking at the big picture
▶ Encouraging others and treating them with respect
▶ Communicating effectively and acknowledging other people’s accomplishments
S
uccessful project management depends not only on what you do, but 
also on how you do it. Your attitudes and behaviors toward people 
affect how they respond to you. If I could, I’d place a large Tip icon on this 
entire chapter because it offers ten tips that can help you successfully win 
people’s support. So why not give it a little of your attention?
Be a “Why” Person
Look for the reasons behind requests and actions. Understanding why helps 
you make sure you respond appropriately to team members, upper managers, 
and all other project audiences (which, in turn, increases people’s motiva-
tion and buy in). First, look to understand the reasons behind other people’s 
requests and actions; then share your findings with other people. (Check out 
Chapter 2 to find out more about how you can be a “why” person.)
Be a “Can Do” Person
Look at all problems as challenges, and do everything you can to find ways 
to overcome them. Be creative, flexible, and tenacious. Keep working at the 
problem until you solve it. (Flip to Chapters 2, 4, 5, and 12 for more on how to 
be a tenacious problem solver.)

340
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Think about the Big Picture
Keep events in perspective. Understand where you want to go and how your 
plan will get you there. Recognize the effect your actions have on current and 
future efforts. Share your vision with other people. (Flip to Chapters 2 and 14 
for more on how you can keep your project elements in perspective.)
Think in Detail
Be thorough. If you don’t think through your project’s issues, who will? The 
more clearly you describe your intended results, the more easily people can 
recognize the benefits associated with your project. And the more clearly 
you define your intended work, the more often people will ask important and 
insightful questions — and believe that they can perform the work success-
fully. Clarity leads to increased personal motivation and reduced chances of 
mistakes. (Check out Chapters 2 and 4 for tips on thinking in detail.)
Assume Cautiously
Take the time to find out the facts; use assumptions only as a last resort. 
With every assumption comes a risk that you’re wrong. The fewer assump-
tions you make, the more confidence you can have in your plan. (Check out 
Chapter 2 for more information on assumptions and Chapter 8 for info on 
how to deal with risks and uncertainty.)
View People as Allies, Not Adversaries
Focus on common goals, not individual agendas. Making people feel comfort-
able encourages brainstorming, creative thinking, and the willingness to try 
new ideas — all of which are essential to managing a successful project. But 
viewing and treating people as adversaries can put them on the defensive 
and encourage them to become enemies. (Refer to Chapters 3 and 14, where I 
tell you how to get people on your side.)

341
 Chapter 19: Ten Tips for Being a Better Project Manager
Say What You Mean, and 
Mean What You Say
Communicate clearly. Be specific by letting people know exactly what you 
mean. Tell them what you want them to know, what you want them to do, 
and what you’ll do for them. Don’t leave these details up to their imagina-
tions. You may think that being vague gives you more leeway, but, in reality, 
being vague just increases the chances for misunderstandings and mistakes. 
(Check out Chapter 13 for ways to communicate more clearly.)
Respect Other People
Focus on people’s strengths rather than their weaknesses. In each person on 
your team, find a quality that you can respect. People work harder and enjoy 
their work more when they’re around others who appreciate them and their 
efforts. (See Chapter 14 for more helpful tidbits on respecting and encourag-
ing other people.)
Acknowledge Good Performance
Take a moment to acknowledge good performance. When someone does 
something good, tell the person, tell the person’s boss, tell other team mem-
bers, and tell the person’s peers that you appreciate the effort and its results. 
Recognizing good performance confirms to a person the accuracy and value 
of his work; your praise tells a person that you appreciate his efforts, which 
motivates him to work with you and other team members on future projects.
When acknowledging a person’s performance, mention the quality of the 
results he accomplished as well as the effort he invested. Be specific — tell 
the person exactly what he did or produced that you appreciate. Be sure to 
provide your feedback promptly — don’t wait weeks or months before recog-
nizing someone for his hard work. (See Chapter 14 for more about acknowl-
edging good performance.)

342
Part VI: The Part of Tens 
Be a Manager and a Leader
Attend to people as well as to information, processes, and systems. Create 
and share your vision and excitement with your team members, but don’t 
forget to share a sense of order and efficiency, too. Encourage people to 
strive for outstanding results, and provide the guidance and support to help 
them achieve those results. (See Chapter 14 for more information about man-
agement and leadership.)

Appendix
Combining the Techniques into 
Smooth-Flowing Processes
Y
ou’ll use the tools and techniques in this book many times during any 
given project — as you hammer out your initial plan, monitor work in 
progress and its results, and continue to tweak the details as necessary. Even 
though you can’t avoid surprises or changes as your project unfolds, you can 
provide logical order for your project’s planning and its control activities. This 
sense of order discourages bad surprises (and their faithful companions — 
change and redirection). I illustrate this order in this appendix.
Preparing Your Project Plan
Figure A-1 depicts the steps in project planning and the parts of the plan that 
you produce along the way.
When you receive a project assignment, take the following steps to develop a 
plan for your project:
 
1. Clarify the reasons for the project and the desired results.
 
 To complete this step, you need to do the following two important 
activities:
 
• Identify the audiences who will have a say in your project.
 
• Get info from all the audiences and written sources about 
expectations.
 
 See Chapter 2 for more on how to identify your project’s audiences and 
the sources you need to check to find out about the reasons and expec-
tations for your project.
 
 Perform these two activities interactively. In other words, use the initial 
statement of your assignment to suggest additional audiences and con-
sult with those audiences to identify more issues to address.

344
Project Management For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
 
 The outcomes from these activities are your Scope Statement and your 
audience list. (See Chapter 2 for more on preparing a Scope Statement 
and Chapter 3 for putting together an audience list.)

2. After you know all the results and deliverables your project is sup-
posed to produce, identify the work required to accomplish them.
 
 Record this information in a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). (See 
Chapter 4 for information on how to prepare a WBS.)
 
3. Consider the WBS and the audience list together to decide on each 
audience’s roles and responsibilities for each project activity.
 
 Display this information in a Responsibility Assignment Matrix, also 
known as a RAM. (See Chapter 10 for a discussion on preparing this 
matrix.)
 
4. Create and analyze a network diagram of the activities from the WBS 
to develop a schedule that meets your project drivers’ requirements 
and that your project supporters believe is possible.
 
 Display your final schedule in a milestone list, an activity list, or a Gantt 
chart. (See Chapter 5 for how to prepare and display a project schedule.)
 
5. Estimate your resource needs, and display them in one or more 
Resources Matrices and Resources Loading Charts and in your project 
budget. After you specify the particular resources you need and when 
you need them and identify people who may meet those needs, revise 
your network diagram and schedule to reflect any differences between the 
capabilities and availability of the people you requested and those being 
offered to you. Negotiate for different people, if necessary, and modify 
your schedule accordingly until you have a schedule and a list of resource 
assignments that you believe will meet your project’s needs. See Chapters 
6 and 7 for preparing and displaying project resource needs.
 
6. Identify, analyze, and plan for any significant project risks. See 
Chapter 8 for suggestions on dealing with project risks.
 
Continue working on each step in this initial process until all project drivers 
and supporters agree with and support your results.
Controlling Your Project 
during Performance
Figure A-2 illustrates the steps you routinely perform to monitor and control 
your project throughout its performance.
To monitor and control your project throughout its life cycle, follow these 
steps:

346
Project Management For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
 
1. At the start of each performance period, reconfirm that the necessary 
people and resources are available and scheduled in accordance with 
your current project plan (see Chapter 12 for details).
 
2. At the end of each performance period, do the following:
 
• Gather activity start and end dates, milestone dates, resource 
expenditures, and the results of quality assessments.
 
• Compare the actual results with the planned results, identify any 
issues or problems, and take any necessary corrective actions.
 
3. Report your progress for the period to your project audiences.
 
 See Chapters 12 and 13 for information on tracking, assessing, and 
reporting project performance.
