NPM  
So, in this section, you learned that: 
- Every Node application has a package.json ﬁle that includes metadata about the 
application. This includes the name of the application, its version, dependencies, 
etc. 
- We use NPM to download and install 3rd-party packages from NPM registry: 
- All the installed packages and their dependencies are stored under 
node_modules folders. This folder should be excluded from the source control.
- Node packages follow semantic versioning: major.minor.patch 
- Useful NPM commands are: 
// Install a package
npm i <packageName>
// Install a speciﬁc version of a package 
npm i <packageName>@<version>
// Install a package as a development dependency
npm i <packageName> —save-dev
 
// Uninstall a package
npm un <packageName>
// List installed packages 
npm list —depth=0

// View outdated packages
npm outdated
// Update packages 
npm update 
- To install/uninstall packages globally, use -g ﬂag.
