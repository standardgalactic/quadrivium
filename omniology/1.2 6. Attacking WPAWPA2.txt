Attacking WPA/WPA2

• You need a client connected to the target
• You need to capture the handshake 
• Easiest way is to deauth client, which then 
forces client to reauthenticate
Attacking WPA/WPA2
(Overview)

• Goal is to deauthenticate client(s) to make 
them reauthenticate
• aireplay-ng --deauth 1000 -a 
00:11:22:33:44:55 -c 00:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE 
wlan0
deauth
1000 = number of requests
-a = MAC of the target AP
-c = MAC of the target client
wlan0 = adapter 
Attacking WPA/WPA2
(Deauth attack)

• Step 1 (Client to AP): The client sends an 
initial message called the "EAPOL-Start" to 
the AP, indicating its intent to perform the 
handshake.
• Step 2 (AP to Client): The AP responds with a 
message called the "EAPOL-Key" message, 
providing the necessary cryptographic 
information and a random number called 
the "ANonce."
Attacking WPA/WPA2
(4 way handshake)

• Step 3 (Client to AP): The client generates its 
own random number called the "SNonce" 
and combines it with the ANonce received 
from the AP. It then calculates a Pairwise 
Transient Key (PTK) using the pre-shared key 
(PSK) or other authentication method. The 
client sends this information to the AP.
Attacking WPA/WPA2
(4 way handshake)

• Step 4 (AP to Client): The AP also calculates 
the PTK using the ANonce, SNonce, and 
other shared information. It compares the 
calculated PTK with the one received from 
the client. If they match, it indicates 
successful authentication. The AP sends a 
confirmation message to the client.
Attacking WPA/WPA2
(4 way handshake)

• For each password attempt, the attacker 
uses the captured handshake to validate 
whether the password is correct or not. The 
validation is done by calculating the Pairwise 
Transient Key (PTK) using the captured 
handshake and the guessed password. If the 
calculated PTK matches the one in the 
captured handshake, it indicates that the 
password is correct.
Attacking WPA/WPA2
(Brute Force)

• airodump-ng wlan1mon --channel 1
• aireplay-ng --deauth 100 -a 
3C:E8:24:C6:96:F8 wlan1mon
• Capture hash 
• airodump-ng wlan1mon --channel 1 -w 
hash1
• aireplay-ng --deauth 100 -a 
3C:E8:24:C6:96:F8 wlan1mon
Attacking WPA/WPA2
(Capture the hash)

• aircrack-ng (slow)
• hashcat -m 16800 hash.cap 
/home/kali/top10000passwords.txt
Attacking WPA/WPA2
(Crack the hash)

• hashcat -h
• hashcat -m 16800 hash.cap 
/home/kali/wordlist.txt
-m for type of hash
Examples: 
22000 | WPA-PBKDF2-PMKID+EAPOL  
16800 | WPA-PMKID-PBKDF2  
2500 | WPA-EAPOL-PBKDF2
