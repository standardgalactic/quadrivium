Every pilot has
the dream of 
-
 0 : 1
ﬂying one of 
.
L
.
these unique and ,
complex ﬁghting 
-
machines. Here is your chance to do what few pilots have the
privilege to try.
Depending on your skill, conﬁdence and courage, you have the
choice of remaining near the landing pad, learning to hover
and land, or venturing higher to practise your approaches.
When you think you have mastered these, then accelerate the
Jump Jet into an attack ﬁghter. Use the radar and range ﬁnder to seek and destroy the
enemy, by launching heat-seeking air-to-air missiles. Beware! His radar and missile
systems are as good as yours. Reckless pursuit is ill-advised: you must maintain a fuel
level that will enable you to relocate and return to the aircraft carrier, executing the
skills you have learned to achieve a successful landing.
You are n o w ready to proceed to the next skill level to face additional hazards, such as
unpredictable swell and treacherous cross-winds.
Be warned, this program is not a toy or game. You wilt need to c o
eyes and mind to successfully complete each mission. Do  not hope to achieve in a
short time that which took the author three years to learn as a Ju mp  Jet pilot, and
over a year to record on this computer program.

IT'S NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.
Our famous hero Adenoid Anthony is
rising from bed for a day at school.
Anthony descends the stairs and walks
over to his Commodore C999, switches it
on and dials up his local education centre
ready for the days lessons.
You may think that all of this seems a
little far fetched. Well it isn't. It is already
possible for you to link your computer to
numerous other systems around t h e
country by means of a device called a
modem. Quite simply a modem takes
information from one computer,transfers
it into a form which can be sent down a
telephone line and a modem at the other
end of the call transfers this back into a
form that t h e  other  computer c an
understand.
The 'other computer' could be one
that is owned by a friend and you could be
sending your latest programs t o  one
another or it could possibly be one of the
large commercial systems such as Prestel
or Compunet. Prestel is used within many
companies for  gathering information.
You must have seen Prestel terminals in
travel agents used for keeping them up to
date with variable holidays_ Compunet is a
system run speciﬁcally for Commodore
owners and offers news, games and an
area called the Jungle where subscribers
to the system can set up their own area
and store their own programs.
So you see, Adenoids' school in the
home computer' is not really all that far
away, you can already get access to a large
amount o f  information ov er  y our
telephone line.
In order to help you to enter this new
area of computing we have a couple of
features i n  this  issue dedicated t o
communications on your Commodore
computer.
The ﬁrst article explains just what is
available once you have forked out the
money for a modem for your computer.
There is even a list of bulletin board
telephone numbers that will allow you to
access computers all over Great Britain.
The second article gives details about
some of the modems that are currently
available for  Commodore micros and
explains the differences between the
cheaper and dearer modems.
Why not join Adenoid Anthony by
becoming a part of this exciting new area?
Introductions
Now it's time for the boring bit where I
get a chance to introduce myself.
You may have noticed that there has
been a few changes to the list of staff
working on the magazine. Alison Hjul has
unfortunately moved on to new pastures
and I have taken over as Editor of the
magazine.
Even though I am sat here at Your
Commodore HQ, I feel that this is not my
magazine but rather, as is stated in the
title, it is yours, the readers. In order for
me to continue seeing the magazine in
this w ay  I  mus t r ely  o n  a ll y o u
Commodore owners  s at a t  home,
programming your machines and making
new discoveries, to write to me here at
Your Commodore, sending i n  that
fantastic n e w  game that y ou k now
everyone will love to play or that great
new utility that will turn your computer
into the best thing since the creation of
Commodore Business Machines.
So there you have it, get stuck into the
magazine, have fun and don't forget I'm
waiting to hear from you.

STATEMENT
Public see the 128
The British public had its ﬁrst glimpse of
Commodore latest computer at the Sixth
International Commodore Computer
Show. The Commodore 128 was on show
together w it h  a  f u ll range o f  new
peripherals, including a new disk drive,
the 1571 which will load programs much
faster than the existing 1541. The 1571 is
seen as a replacement for the 1541 as it is
completely c ompatible w i t h  t h e
Commodore 64, although the disk drive
will not work any faster than the present
1541 on this machine.
41,1
No prices were announced for the
new hardware and it was also stated that
there will be no price cuts made to the
Commodore 64. In order to promote the
'64 Commodore has  announced a
number of value added packs. The ﬁrst of
these is a '64, cassette recorder and a copy
of International Soccer for 1199. Sales of
the new Commodore package will be
further promoted by a special holiday
offer that will give anyone purchasing a
Commodore 64 or Commodore 16 three
nights' fr ee accommodation f o r  t w o
people a t  a  choice o f  300 hotels
throughout Britain and the Continent.
As well as promoting the sales of the
'64, special peripheral value packs were
announced, for 1229 it will be possible to
purchase a  1541 disk drive with the
Commodore Modem and a selection of
disc based software. This is a saving of over
1200.
A business pack is being offered, based
around a  Plus/4, for  1449. The pack
comprises of a Plus/4, a 1541 disc drive
and an MPS 801 dot matrix printer. A suite
of-business programs, called Impex 1,2,3,
is also included in the price. This pack has
an overall saving of 1198.
Probably the most exciting item to be
previewed at the show from was a sound
sampling device from Music Sales, the
company who produce the Commodore
music keyboard. The device will allow you
to sample any sound, for  example a
human voice, and then alter it using the
computer. You could alter the pitch of the
speech so that it was either higher or
lower than your own, you could even play
a tune on the word hello if you really
wanted. The sampler is expected to be
ready for launch by christmas and will cost
around 170.
Software houses launched a number
of new tides at the show. Melbourne
House showed Exploding Fist based
around the karate games that are in the
arcades. Domark showed A View To A
Kill, based around the James Bond Film of
the same name, and Island Logic were
showing their Music System a program
which received much publicity on the
BBC.
Fly to the USA
IT IS THE NORM FOR AMERICAN SOFT-
ware to be bought by British companies
and launched in this country, one only has
to look at the giant US Gold to prove that
this works.
It is however extremely unusual to
hear of a British software product to be
bought by an american company for sale
in the States. However, this is just what has
happened to Digital Integration and its
game Fighter Pilot.
Digital Integration has ﬁnalised a deal
with the US giant EPYX that will allow EPYX
to manufacture and market the 64 version
of the game throughout the US and
Canada. The name of the program will be
changed to Jet Flight Simulator.

What Next?
Q. When is a game not a game?
A. When it's called Web Runner the latest
program from the Activision stable.
Web Runner is described as a musical
fantasy of light, colour and sound. The
aim of the game(?) is to traverse a web
pattern and freeze a number of objects
that are moving around it. The difﬁculty in
deciding whether or not it is a game stems
from the fact that there are no lives and no
points scored. Whatever next? Computer
games without a computer?
Web runner should be available in
your local computer store and will cost
£10.99.
TONY 'GIBBO' GIBSON THE AUTHOR
of the Taskset games Jammin, Bozo's
Night Out and Seaside special has quit the
Bridlington based company and licensed
his latest game to Virgin.
The new game, Ghettoblaster was
produced by Gibbo and his partner Mark
Harrison, Both of them are very big music
fans, as reﬂected in earlier games, and
have produced w hat  c an o n ly  b e
described as a Musical Arcade Adventure.
In fact there is so much music in the game
that a special synthesiser was designed for
them to work on.
In the game you play the part of Rock-
in Rodney, last seen on a ﬂashing spot
somewhere in the game lammin, as a
messenger for Interdisc Records. Rodney
must run around Funky Town collecting
demo tapes which are for possible release.
For some unknown reason Rodney also
has the task of making the locals dance.
The game contains 12 original pieces
of music and the graphics are extremely
reminiscent of Gibbos Taskset games.
U.S. G old, Ocean and Walt Disney
Productions have ﬁnalised a deal that will
give the British companies a licence to
create computer programs f o r  t h e
forthcoming Walt Disney ﬁlms Return to
Oz, the sequel to the Wizard of Oz, and
The Black Cauldron, a ﬁlm which Disney
are expected to spend around f 750 MO on
the advertising alone. A s  w e ll as
producing games for the new ﬁlms, U.S.
Gold and Ocean have been commis-
sioned to produce a game based around
that old favourite the Jungle Book.
U.S. Gold go to Disneyland
It would also appear that U.S. Gold is
being allowed to use many of the other
popular characters fr om Disney ﬁlms
including Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck,
and Winnie the Pooh,
In addition to the agreement that will
allow U.S. Gold t o  use these World
famous characters, U.S. Gold will also
have the rights to the current range of
Walt Disney titles. The ﬁrst three to be
released are:
'Mickeys Space Adventure' which is
described as an adventure game through
our solar 5ystem for  ages of  8 years
upwards. 'Winnie t h e  Pooh i n  t h e
Hundred A c r e  W o o d '  a n o t h e r
adventure for children aged 7 years and
up and 'Donald Duck's Playground'
which aims to teach the skills of matching
items, mak ing money  a n d  c hange
making.
These products are marketed in the
U.S. by Sierra On-Line and U.S. Gold hope
to have them available on the market by
Christmas 1985.

MONOLITH-TIMELESS SOFTWARE WILL
be launching a  new adventure game
based around that well loved superhero
Superman.
The adv entur e game i s  b e in g
produced i n  close association w it h
America's First Star who are part of the
Warner Communications Group.
What Monolith Timeless software
claim t o  be a unique concept called
'authoring' has been used in writing the
game. This system allows the games and
graphics designers t o  create superb
animated cartoon graphics.
Monolith are due t o  launch their
debut titles.
Monolith's ﬁrst titles should just be

Rockford's Riot and Quake Minus One.
You c an deﬁnately tell that i t  is

them are computer simulations of sports.
On-court tennis will keep all you
Wimbledon fans happy. You can choose
from f o u r  players, a ll supposedly
patterned from real life tennis players,
and the type of court that you wish to play
on. I just hope we don't have any displays
of bad behaviour from the stars.
Star league baseball brings  t h e
excitement of this american game into
your living room. Options to play against
another human player or the very tough
computer player should keep all the
family happy.
Fans o f  the American version o f
football are catered for with On-ﬁeld
football. This game allows you to play this
extremely violent sport within the safety
of yor own home.


Listings will be much easier to
enter with our new system.
COMMODORE LISTINGS ARE RATHER
well known for the horrible little black
blobs that always abound. Unfortunately
the graphics characters which are used to
represent graphic and control characters
do not reproduce very well and they are
also difﬁcult to ﬁnd on the Commodore
keyboard.
For this reason Your Commodore
started to precede any control characters
with a REM statement on the previous line
that explained exactly what the black
blobs were meant to be. Unfortunately
the graphic s  characters w er e n o t
documented and these still cause some
confusion. For this reason we are starting
to use a new method for marking the
control and graphic characters in our
listings.
In future all control and graphics
commands will be replaced by mnemonic
within square brackets. This mnemonic is
not typed out as printed in the magazine
but rather the corresponding key or keys
on the keyboard are pressed. For example
[RIGHT] means press the cursor right key,
you do not type in [RIGHT]. All of the
keywords, what keys to press and how
they are shown on the screen are shown
below.

In this month's project, Garr;
Marshall shows how to
develop a drawing package,
complete with a Fill routine.
THERE ARE MANY TIMES WHEN YOU
will need to develop illustrations for use
within a program. It could be a technical
picture f o r  a  design package o r  the
backdrop for  y our latest game. This
month we will develop a program that will
make this extremely easy for you.
It is possible to draw any shape by
linking a number of points together with
lines. A program is to be developed that
uses a cursor to indicate the points that
must be joined to create a shape. This
allows a 'free hand' drawing to be made
but, for those with no special artistic
ability, it can be employed by using the
cursor t o  'trace' an illustration held
against the screen.
By adding the capability to ﬁll a region
with colour, the program can then be
used to 'paint a picture, providing a most
satisfying utility.

Starting out
Our program must begin by setting up the
high-resolution graphics screen. A sprite
is then created for use as the cursor, and
placed on the screen. A  cross-shaped
cursor will give an accurate way of ﬁxing
the position of a point.
When this has been done, we can
drive the program with single key presses
from the keyboard. One group of keys
can be used to move the cursor, and
another f o r  creating a n d  colouring
drawings. The four keys positioned in a
diamond around the 'K' at the right of the
keyboard form a convenient group for
moving the cursor, as shown in Figure 1.
The four keys shown in Figure 2, which
form a  diamond a t  t he left o f  the
keyboard, will be used for drawing and
ﬁlling as indicated in that ﬁgure.
This description gives o u r  main
program as:
Set up the high-resolution screen
Create and position a sprite for the
cursor
Repeat
When a key is pressed
If it is an "I" then move the sprite up
If it is a "I" then move the sprite to the
left
If it is an "L" then move the sprite to
the right
If it is an " M"  then move the sprite
down
If it is an "S" then start a drawing
If it is a "D" then draw a line to this
point
If it is an "E" then end the drawing
If it is an "X" then ﬁll the region with
colour
End repeat
Writing the program
The above description converts directly to
lines 10 to 120 in the program listing,
giving us the main body of the program.
We h a v e  us ed high-res olution
graphics in previous projects, and the
subroutine starting at line 1000 for setting
up this mode of display is one that we
have used before. We have also used
sprites previously. Describing the cross
shapes for sprite 0 and placing this sprite
on the screen is done by the subroutine
starting a t  line 2000, very similar t o
routines used earlier in the series. Once
on the screen, the sprite is moved by lines
40 t o  70, which simply increase o r
decrease the numbers in the registers that
hold its row or column numbers.
Pressing "S" to begin a drawing causes
E
 the column and row positions of the
cursor to be stored in XEI and YB, so that
the start position will be available when
the drawing is to be completed. This
position is then copied into X1 and 'Cl. To
1000 T o  set up the high-resolution graphics screen.
2000 T o  create the sprite for the cursor and place it in its initial position.
3000 T o  draw an unbroken straight line. Line 3010 detects vertical lines, and
lines 3080 to 3110 draw them. Line 3020 detects lines with slopes
exceeding 45 degrees, and lines 3130 to 3160 draw them,
3500 T o  plot a point at a given row and column position. This routine is called
repeatedly by the line-drawing subroutine to plot a series of points
along the path of the line.
4000 T o  ﬁll an area from the cursor to the edge of a region.

get the actual screen co-ordinates we
must subtract numbers from the contents
of the position registers to compensate
for two factors. First, the sprite position is
not the same as the dot position on the
high-resolution screen. Secondly, a sprite
is positioned by its bottom corner,and we
are taking positions from the cross-point
at the centre of the sprite.
Pressing " D "  causes t h e  current
position of the sprite to be stored in X2
and Y2, then a subroutine is called to a line
from (Xl, Y1) to (X2, Y2), and then copies
X2 and Y2 into Xl, Y1 ready to draw the
next line. The subroutine for drawing the
line starts at line 3000, and again is one that
we have used before, except that it has
been modiﬁed to ensure that it always
draws a  continuous line. This will be
important when we write the routine for
ﬁlling a  r egion w i t h  c olour . T h e
subroutine operates by repeatedly calling
the subroutine starting at line 3500, which
simply plots a  point a t  t he current
position.
Pressing "E" indicates the end of a
drawing, and causes a line to be drawn
from the last point to the ﬁrst one, giving a
drawing that consists of a closed contour.
The sequence o f  key presses that is
necessary to create a drawing is illustrated
in Figure 3,
Now we come to the routine for ﬁlling
a region with colour. Ideally, since the
drawing part of our program always gives
a closed contour, we should like to place
the cursor inside a contour, to indicate
the region to be coloured, and have the
'painting' routine do the rest. Although
this can be done, it is far from simple. The
subroutine presented here, which starts at
line 4000, ﬁlls an area that extends to the
right and down from the cursor position,
and stops at the edge of the region. The
sort of area that it will ﬁll depends on the
shape of the contour, and on the position
of the cursor relative to it. Two examples
of what it does are shown in Figure 4.
This fairly rudimentary ﬁlling routine
should provide a basis from which you
can develop a better one. It can also be
used in its own right to ﬁll most of a region
by using it repeatedly to ﬁll gaps left by its
previous applications.
The routine starts b y  drawing a
horizontal line t o the right from the
cursor position to the edge of the region.
This is why the line-drawing routine must
produce continuous lines. If there are any
gaps then our  horizontal line will go
straight through them. The program then
moves the drawing position down by one
line from the cursor position and draws
another horizontal line to the edge of the
region. It repeats this until the starting
position for the next horizontal line hits
the edge of the region.
Figure 5  gives a  summary of  the
subroutines used by  the program and
their actions,

THE ABILITY TO READ IS ONE OF OUR 
•
most important acquisitions, and is
something that many of  us cannot
remember learning t o do. Others,
however, ﬁnd a very difﬁcult exercise,
which may stem from early failure leading )
a person to decide that he does not want
to learn to read, thus closing all the
experiences reading brings.
Your Commodore 64 computer can be
of help in introducing your child to
reading and will hopefully, keep his
interest so that he is encouraged to go on
learning. To help you there is a variety of
software available from software houses
and publishing ﬁrms.
Talking to the child about everyday
events and getting the child to talk is an
important ﬁrst step in learning to read
There are several games which will help
you to expand on this process whilst
playing games a nd having fun.
Commodore markets two excellent packs
for this step.
Gel Ready t o  Read  w it h  B.J.
Bear is a  pack of  four cassettes, a
childrz:n's book and a parents' guide.
Using a  cuddly teddy as its central
character it starts with vocabulary and
memory training and works in a sure and
steady way through listening and auditory
discrimination to learning the letters of
the alphabet and the sounds they make.
All of the games are colourful and fun to
play.
Hide and Seek by A.S.K. (again
marketed by Commodore) is a  pre
reading vocabulary set which is based on a
memory game - which picture is missing?
There are four games in the pack. The
early games are very easy but as they
progress more discussion is needed
before an answer can be given.
Another good game of this type is Mr.
I  Meets His Match, in which shape, colour
and size of objects is discussed. All of the
above are for the 3-year old age group up-
wards but it must be stressed that they
need to be with an adult: the computer
can only be used as a teaching aid, not as
an end in itself.
Once a basic vocabulary and a rapport
between parent and child is established
alphabet work can be introduced in
earnest. Mr T's Alphabet Games (Good
Housekeeping) and kids on Keys
(Spinnaker) both keep the young child on
their toes as they match and learn letters.
Mr. T. then shows the child how the
letters are written whilst going on to
GOOD HOUSEKEEPING

match simple words with pictures. Both
these games have arcade type action to
help keep the child's attention.
The next stage is looking at the
symbols, realising that they are words with
meaning and then learning the words.
One way of doing this, also used in some
schools, is the ﬂashcard method. This has
been successfully transferred t o the
computer by a small ﬁrm, Toddlersolt,
using lots of familiar everyday words with
colourful animated illustrations. One
section is based upon the Grifﬁn Pirate
reading series, a favourite ﬁrst reading
scheme used in some schools.
Once over the initial hurdles of
alphabet and ﬁrst word learning it is
useful t o show the child what fun
reading can be. This can, of course be
done with conventional books; however
the computer's graphics capabilities add
another dimension. Mirrorsoft has a
delightful package of cassette and book
called Caesar's Travels which ﬁts this bill.
The cassette is an animated storybook in
which the child reads part of the story and
then decides which option to take to
continue the story. The book included in
the pack has the same stories and some
beautiful illustrations for the child to
colour. As there are about twenty
different endings to the story the pack can
be used time after time,
Mr. Ju n g le Stories is a double-sided
cassette. On one side is the story of animals
moving through the jungle to reach a raft
ﬂoating down the river. The reader
decides how the animals move and thus
determines whether the animal reaches
the raft or falls in the river.
Jungle Challenge lets the child build
up a story choosing characters, setting
etc., and then replays the story for the
child to read. Both games are well
animated and have amusing sound
effects.
To recap, there are four basic steps in
learning to read:-
1 Vocabulary building and memory
training. Talk to your child at every
opportunity - even the small baby will
beneﬁt from conversation.
2 Alphabet recognition and learning the
sounds that go with each letter
Remember it is the sound and not the
letter's name that counts.
3 First words
4 Using what has been learnt to read a
story.
Overall make learning fun. Take it in short
sessions at a pace to suit your child; too
much pressure can lead to early failure
and so defeat the object. Once these
stages have been worked through your
child should have a foundation on which
to build and hopefully he will discover the
joy of reading and will want to learn more.

The aliens come in various forms and
most of them have irregular movement

can ﬁre missiles.

ONE OF THE BEST GAMES FOR THE
commodore 64 is 'Boulderash'. Now a
very similar game has arrived for the
unempanded VI C . Rockman i s  a n
excellent version of  this very popular
game.
The instructions for this game include
a very complex little story which is
irrelevant to the actual game. Brieﬂy, it
seems that you arrive back in your country
only t o  ﬁnd y our  Father has been
murdered by his younger brother. He has
then managed to convince your people
into believing he is their King. Your only
hope is to ask the Elders' for help. All they
do is send you into some caves to retrieve
160 pieces of a magical Amulet. There are
8 pieces in each cave making 20 caves in
all.
In the actual game collecting the
pieces of the Amulet is far from easy. Each
cave has a different layout of rocks in it.
The rocks are supported by earth which
you as Rockman can dig away. Also
Inhabiting t h e  caves ar e nasty little
creatures which follow you round the
paths you dig. However, a careful push of
a rock onto its head will rid you of it. Once
you have collected the 8 pieces in that
cave you can head for the exit to the next.
The graphics are all double height and
an expanded screen is used. They are all
well deﬁned and animated. The sound is
also very good although the rendition of
'Popcorn' is a little out of key.
This is  a n incredible game. T he
programmer deserves a medal for the
sheer variety in screens, graphics, sound
effects and playa bil ity. There is even a title
screen and all in 3.5K of memory! Superb.

You control a stunt motorcyclist over a
wide variety of obstacles ranging from
jumps over water, vehicles and telephone
booths to rough riding over potholes and
through hedges. That is 'you' may control
the rider, I failed dismally to do anything
of the sort and found the game to be very
difﬁcult.
The program caters for two players by
the neat inclusion of a split screen as in
PITSTOP 2, player one using the top half.
There are eight different sections on
which to try you skill, three of which,
together make up one game.
The introduction of software of this
quality at such a realistic price can only be
applauded and should go someway to
discouraging piracy, surely most people
can afford a couple of quid for an original
game. Well done Mastertronic. D . I . T .

PUT ON YOUR CRASH HELMET AND
hold on tight, because there is nothing
slow or tame about this budget-priced
game from Mastertronic!
Your aim is to complete a sequence of
ﬁve obstacle courses, avoiding t h e
hazards and collecting marker-ﬂags as
you go. If you miss a single ﬂag you cannot
complete the course. At the same time
your energy is falling, buit this can be
replenished by picking up energy pods
along the way. You are able to jump and
manoeuvre rapidly -  the only thing you
can't do is travel slowly! lightning reﬂexes
and iron nerves will be needed if you
intend to complete the course and win
the gold cup.
The quality of C16 games is improving
all the time, and this is a very worthy
offering, especially at only El .99. The
graphics are colourful and detailed, with
very smooth vertical scrolling, and the
sound effects are interesting. This is not
just a translation of Mastertronics' game
of the same name for the 64. This one is far
superior and well worth buying. Don't
expect to ﬁnish it in a hurry, though. After
several hours play I have still not gone
further than course 2! P . R . B .

for the VIC called 'Rockman'_ However it
is still a very good game and a great feat of
programming in limited memory space.
You mus t enter  t h e  'Crypts o f

All the features of the original Super
Pipeline have been kept, including its
nightmare-like quality. Now, however,
the nightmare has become more intense
as there are constant attacks from scores
of baddies! Some make leaks in the pipe;
others are difﬁcult or impossible to kill.
You race around, collecting workmen to
repair leaks and shooting everything that
moves! The game is much faster and more
challenging than the original.
It is impossible to fault Taskset for the
sheer professionalism of their games. The
graphics are excellent, showing the full
potential o f  sprites, and the musical
soundtrack is quite superb. If you already
own Pipeline I, you may think £8.90 too
much to pay for what amounts to an
upgrade. If you don't, then this is a game
you must try to buy!

NO, IT'S NOT A COMPUTER •'ERSION
of Aladdin but a new and rather unusual
game, in which a series of evil genies have
to be captured and shoved back into their
lamps.
In case you are not familiar with the
ancient oriental art of genie-bottling, let
me put you in the picture. Two stages are
involved. First you ﬂy rapidly on a magic
carpet through a tunnel which wriggles
about all over the place. Then you have to
strike a succession of coloured gongs in
are a number of nasties which make your
task far from easy.
As with ' Rock man ' some very effective
data compression routines have been
used to give the player as much variety as
possible in .3
Crypts are all different and contain
different numbers of nasties and passage
ways. Some screens appear as mazes,
some in the form of skulls or outlines of
men.
Graphics are all well deﬁned and are in
double height on an expanded screen.
Sound is also quite good and fairly varied.
Despite the similarities between this
and 'Rockman' it is still worth a look
especially a t  t h e  superb price. VI C
software is  very low  o n the ground
nowadays and I just wished it was all as
good as this. Cheap but not nasty.
the correct order, to neutralise matching
musical notes which the genie throws at
you. They really are ingenious genies!
The game is original and requires
several skills. Flying through the tunnels
calls for very rapid manipulation of the
joystick, while, as well as speed, a good
memory will be needed to hit the right
gongs. On the higher levels the colours
disappear and you rely entirely on your
ear for music! If you fail, you are not killed
but have to start again on the same level.
This can become tedious.
The game's graphics are good and
there i s  a n  ex c ellent soundtrack.
However, there is little real variety, so I
fear it might quickly become boring. An
interesting idea, b u t  n o t  sufﬁciently
developed.

actually spend o n  t he squash c ourt
apparently i n  t h e  name o f  ﬁtness,
probably t he last thing I  need is  a
simulator for  the computer. But then
perhaps the best thing I could have is a
few tips from one of the all time masters
like Jonah Barrington.
Needless to say this is an excellent
game which follows,asclosely as possible,
the proper rules of square and represents
them on screen with brilliant graphics. So
on with the action.
You can choose a one, three or ﬁve
game match as well as the spot of the ball
you play with ranging from red, which is
easy, through blue and white to yellow,
which is hard.
A GRAPHICALLY EXCELLENT PICTURE.
almost a  photograph, of  a helicopter
appears on screen during loading, giving
some clue as to what this game is about.
The aim is  t o  pilot a  helicopter,
gathering up supplies and equipment for
the good guys and delivering them to
bases while at the same time avoiding
enemy gunﬁre. It also helps if., in idle
moments, a few depth charges are aimed
at numerous submarines carrying enemy
reinforcements.
Nothing special really and on ﬁrst
playing the game did disappoint as the
object was none too clear. Clarity soon
returned by opting for a low skill level
(there d  re ten i n  all) and although
graphics a n d  s ound w e r e  har dly
Minteresque the game did require a fair
bit of dexterity with the old wrist and
trigger ﬁnger.
Quite a pleasant romp all in all with
well deﬁned if  slightly jerky graphics
showing t h e  land bases, seas and
numerous combatants both aﬂight and
aﬂoat. Sounds c ould b e  adapted t o
personal taste with a joystick controlled
option before each game.
Skyjet features about six different
screens o f  ascending complexity but
Naturally squash is a two player game
and you also have the choice of playing
against the computer itself or a human
and perhaps more fallible opponent. But
then the computer player is not adverse to
being rear-ended. T he computer is
remarkably fair in this respect. Well as fair
as any computer can be!
Surprisingly the game doesn't have to
be played using a joystick, although it is
easier. Full movement around the court
can be achieved through the keyboard
using keys which y ou can designate.
Whether you play a back hand or a fore
hand depends on your position relative to
the ball. To actually strike the ball you
simply use the ﬁre button and theangle at
which you strike the ball varies according
to how long you hold the button down.
There are six different angles at which the
ball can ﬂy from the raquet.
With the addictiveness of the game, I
guess my ﬁtness is going to begin to suffer
from this more sedentary style of game!
K.M.
overall the game was not compelling
enough t o  persevere thr ough t h e
progressive levels. It was though a typical
Mastertronic game, well produced with
no pretensions b u t  including a  few
features usually carried by only the more
expensive games. Good value at the price.

AS GRIBBLY-GROBBLY, YOU PLAY A
creature of enormous brain power, type-
casting, do I hear you say? In fact you are
an odd-looking, one legged froglike
animal, but very endearing for all that!
The scene is set on your home planet
of Blabgor -  a strange land of ﬂoating
islands with deadly rocks and plants.,
shrouded in an energy web designed to
contain the wicked Seon. You, as Gribbly,
have a lot of trouble with your children,
the Gribblets, who keep wandering off
into dangerous places. Your rask is to
rescue them from peril by carrying them
back to your cave. To move, you bounce
along the ground but you can also levitate
and ﬂy, using the immense power of your
mind.
Despite the silly name, this is one of
the best and most original games I have
seen recently. The graphics are bold and
colourful, while Gribbly's expressions and
the antics o f  the Gribblets are really
amusing. The sound effects are excellent
and real skill is needed to avoid the many
hazards. There are sixteen screens, each
showing a different area of the planet's
surface.
Had it not been for loading difﬁculties
and the lack of a score table, I would have
given the game ﬁve stars. Even so I
recommend it very highly -  a ﬁrst rate
game!

I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THE YELLOW

that this  game involves. Picture the
scenario. Here's this little penguin called
Parky who has lost his twin brother Perry
in the depths o f  the South Atlantic
subterranean caverns. But like all South
Atlantic rescue missions there are plenty
of baddies to make the task difﬁcult. Who
said it was going to be easy anyway? To
make it even worse you can reduce the
number of lives you're allowed as well.
Lives are lost by causing Parky to bump
into the cavern walls and by failing to
avoid the underground nasties. There are
also three different skill levels. The higher
the skill level, the bigger your starting
bonus which gradually ticks away as you
move around the caverns.

Oh I almost forgot the special 'help'

Parky needs them. Just in case Parky feels
a little disoriented the package contains a

getting fairly popular on the '64. What
with Airwolf, Super Huey and various
others w e  are getting quite a  good
selection. However, Chopper is not in the
same class as most of the other games.
You are placed in the pilots seat of the
latest and most deadly helicopter gunship
your airforce has produced. Your mission
is to destroy an enemy base built into the
side of a cliff. Of course this is an almost
impossible task to achieve.
The mission is  made u p  o f  three
sectors and a refueling stage. The ﬁrst
sector is a scrolling dodge'em. You must
zap t h e  enemy helicopters and
planes whilst avoiding their gunﬁre. One
nasty glitch is that you cannot move up or
down while you are ﬁre-ing. The second
sector is a scrolling dodge'em. You must
ﬂy up and down avoiding the millions of
airships and balloons  w hic h hav e
suddenly inhabited the skys.
After each of the ﬁrst two sectors you
must dock with a large plane to refuel and
gain more points. Then its on to the next
sector.
The last sector is the most difﬁcult to
complete. You arrive at the cliff housing
the enemy base. You have to destroy
three shafts by successfully ﬁring a bullet
down them. This is far from easy as two
indestructable helicopters move up and
down as you do. It is very difﬁcult to out
wit these craft so that you can deliver your
shots accurately.
Some nic e graphics and pleasing
sound effects make for  a  fair game.
Unfortunately it all becomes to repetetive
in the end. Various play options and a
high score table don't prevent the game
from becoming dull.

A REAL TIME ACTION ADVENTURE SAYS
the inlay card and I'm prepared to believe
there are 1200 locations and seven levels
of play as it says.
Ice Palace opens with atmospheric
Medieval music, promising much, and
totally in keeping to the quest in hand of
ﬁnding the seven pieces of the Ice Crown
hidden in the Ice Palace and guarded by
the I c e  Q ueen a n d  h e r  naughty
renegades.
The fact that it is played in real time
soon becomes painfully apparent as Evil
usually wins when time runs away at an
alarming rate, mainly because moving the
heroic Prince about is so ﬁddly. While
joystick forwards moves t h e  princ e
forwards, left or  right joystick rotates
surrounding hexagonal shaped rooms.
Joystick back rotates the hero. No easy
darting from room to room here - three
different actions may be required before
moving to the next room.
The screen displays an aerial view of
the hexagonal grid showing the hero and
different symbols representing artifacts,
barriers and hazards. T he complex
movement mechanics, however, usually
result i n  a  rather swift ending with
gloomy music signifying the prince's
demise. Overall it's  a  pretty gloomy
escapade.
Access can be had to an 'adventure'
screen giving a menu of actions to be
performed b u t  n o  time is  given t o
consider choice. A time-out this is not. As
the next action is  pondered a  scale
indicates the rising tide of the Ice Queen's
hold over the adventure and before you
can say 'Moonprince' o r  such other
hallowed words, the game is lost.
While being quite appealing, the
game was on the whole tedious. Too
much thought seems to have been given
to a movement routine quite unsuited to
performing even the simplest of tasks with
little consideration of how this would ﬁt
into the overall structure of a game which
is really a maze game with a time limit to
beat. Very few games have successfully
combined the excitement of the arcade
with the intrigue of adventure and Ice
Palace is cold on this trail.

you will lose a life. Each time that happens
you must wait, getting more and more
irritated, while your Mr  Man bounces
aimlessly around the screen for  what
seems like half an hour!
The game is not just difﬁcult and
annoying; it is practically unplayable - yet
it says on the insert that it is suitable for
young children! Sorry, Mirrorsoft. I
suggest that you send Hi Bouncer to that
happy bouncing ground for software in
the sky, where it surely belongs.

Pa v e Crisp takes a look at
some of the modems that air
available for Commodorlini
mac h a t
IN GENERAL A MODEM IS A MODEM. IF
it works you are equal to all others. Most
extra facilities (which you pay for) only
make life easier once on line so even if
you had to buy the cheapest available
your mailbox messages still look the same
as the persons with 500,00 set up.
I know of many instances where the
modem has been purchased and the user
has waited days for their Prestel number
to arrive. Don't just sit there. Dial up a
Prestel number and use the identiﬁcation
4444444444 and the the password 4444.
This w ill giv e y ou access t o  many
interesting demo pages and will allow you
to get the hang of moving around Prestel.
Also do not forget Bulletin Boards. There
is nothing to stop you going around some
of them. If you have a modem which will
only use 1200/75 do not worry as more
and more BB's are using this mode.
PRISM 1000
The Prism 1000 was dealt with a little while
ago but it is worth recapping in order to
let new readers see what it is all about.
It is not the most sophisticated of
packages, being limited to 1200/75 and
1200/1200 but to those just starting out in
communications or those who know they
will be wanting viewdatea services then it
is quite adequate.
The Prism 1000 is certainly uncluttered
by switches. There are only two. One
selects 1200/75 Viewdata or 1200/1200 the
other seizes the line once you have
dialled the computer and heard the tone.
The important part of the Prism set-up
is the software which arrives with it.
The cartridge based OEL package was
easy to use. Everything being more or less
self explanatory. It is worth mentioning
that if you have an SX-64 the cartridge will
not ﬁt and so a little 'hacking' with a
Stanley knife and saw would be required
to make it  ﬁt the cartridge port. The
problem is the short 'neck'. It will not
allow the connector t o  make proper
contact with the socket.
When ﬁnally  connected u p  ( the
instructions could have been better) and
powered up, the on screen menu will
enable you to get going quickly.
Presuming that you have selected a
viewdata type service the procedure is as
follows. Select option 0: LOG ON/OFF.
This takes you to a sub menu which
allows you to auto log on, Manual log on
or log off.
MODEM 11
I may be wrong but it appeared that
irrespective of whether manual or auto
logging on was selected you still had to
input your ID.
Once the description is made and you
have input your ID, the screen clears and
tells you to phone the computer.
Using the telephone dial up and wait
for the tone. Once heard throw the
on/off line switch down and after a few
seconds contact should be made. Once
the line has been seized you should be
able to put down your receiver but on my
set-up i f  I  d i d  that t h e  line was
disconnected. This left me with an open
line to which all sorts of noise pollution
(mainly my 3 children) had unrestricted
access. I suspect though that it may be a
fault at my  end rather than with the
modem.
The other options available from the
power up menu are:
TERMINAL: This allows you to return to
viewdata service after performing a
function such as print frame.
SAVE FRAME: This enables you to save a
frame to tape or disc and is useful on
pages such as timetables and so on.
VIEW FRAME: From here you can load up
a frame that has been previously saved to
tape/disc.
PRINT FRAME: Problems here but I must
tread carefully. I could not get a printout
on my Canon/Comrnprint set up which
emulates an MPS801 and from mailboxes I
have had I know quite a few people have
been able to dump on an MP5801. It
would appear that it is set up to print only
onto a  centronics printer connected
through the user port but I have a feeling
that in the distant past I did get a mailbox
from someone who said you could dump
to the 801. If you are out there and reading
this please get in  touch again as the
method used would be worth putting in
the mag.
DOWNLOADER: This allows y ou t o
download the hopelessly small amount of
software available on Prestel/Micronet.
What is there appears rather dated and
unexciting, however for the ﬁrst time I did
ﬁnd t hat  downloading results wer e
consistently good. There is a check on
each frame and up to give attempts are
made to download the frame before the
software aborts. F only had one failure in
19 loads.
MAILBOX: With this option you can
prepare, ofﬂine, mailbox messages to be
used with either Prestel or user to user.
This saves telephone time and so keeps
the phone bills down. When preparing a
mbx to use with Prestel bare in mind the
size of the page you will be sending on as
it is easy to overtype and ﬁnd part of your
message will not ﬁt the page.
USER CO MMS: This  allows y ou t o
connect up with other Prism users and

C o m m u n i c a t i o n s
VIADNESS
either send/receive ﬁles, send receive
mailboxes or enter CHAT MODE. Chat
mode allows you to 'talk' directly using
the keyboard. I ﬁnd though that that little
used option called 'speech i s  often
quicker and more effective.
I only had chance to have a very quick
run through user to user. The results were
not very good but I  suspect that the
problems lay with unclean telephone
lines not in lthe modem itself.
In conclusion
For the money the Prism package with
software seems a good buy. It is a shame
that it does not support 300/300 out one
cannot have everything.
I found it easy to use with only a
couple of small niggles.
There is a good second hand market in
modems and so I feel that this would be a
particularly good buy for the ﬁrst time
user. You would be able to check out
communications and see if you liked it
and then either sell it to upgrade or sell it
and pack up.
Miracle Technology
This is the one for anybody who loves
switches a n d  L.E.D's T he Mir ac le
Technology modem certainly looks the
part. Three Rotary Dials and 5 IRA's and
two tone lettering makes this look as if it
will do everything. Well, it comes very
close_
This one does so much that some of
the options are restricted by a stop on the
switch in  order for it to comply with
current Telecom approval speciﬁcations.
Now, I  say it  seems to do nearly
anything, in practice my review model did
virtually nothing. Why? Well when you
buy the Modem that is practically all you
get. On its own it could not do anything
except a self test. The thing you would
need to buy to get everything going is
communications software.
Supplied with the Modem is an RS232
interface which plugs into the user port of
the 64 and into the modem. It was a shame
that the user port plug did not have a
straight through socket as many people
now have Centronics printers connected
via the user port so as it stands there
would be a certain amount of plugging/
unplugging involved_
The Features
On the HARDWARE side the WS2000
offers the following.
300 bit/s Full Duplex
600 bit/s Half Duplex
1200/75 bit/s Viewdata
75/1200 bit/s Viewdata host
And if you are outside the restrictions of
BT t h e r e  i s  a ls o  BELL 103/202
Compatability.
There should be something there that
most of you will want, I particularly like
the 300/300 option. As I said on its own it is
virtually useless and you will need to get
terminal software in order to make use of
your Modem.
I could see that if you were new to this
type o f  t h in g  y o u  c ould e n d  u p
disappointed, and somewhat poorer, if
the need for comms software was not
appreciated at the time of purchase. This
could have been made clearer. I may be
wrong but a  message passed t o  me
indicated that in future the modem may
be supplied with fairly basic comms
software so you could at least get going
from the start.
I understand that o n e  piec e o f
software that goes together well with the
W5200 is the Comms software from PSI.
Unfortunately this did not arrive in time
for it to be used in conjunction with this
modem which would have made it a more
meaningful review, however i f  that
software is as good as rumour has it then it
may be worth getting it into a later edition
of the magazine.
My conclusions on the W52000 have to
be drawn from the information in the
manual,
It seems t o  offer most things and
would, with the right software b e a
versatile tool. The documentation is fairly
comprehensive but I found that it was
heavy going the ﬁrst time through. O f
course once connected to good software
most of the Modems manual becomes
redundant as options will be controlled
through software.
The most unsatisfactory conclusion is
that I think you would enjoy using the
WS2000, but b e  warned o f  the extra
hidden costs of Comms software.
Tandata TM200
Could this be the cream of the Modems I
had for review?
It did not seem quite as versatile as the
WS2000 on options but where this set up
scored was with t he cartridge based
software.
The IM200 is exactly the opposite to
the WS2000. Where the WS2000 has
masses o f  switches and writing t h e
TM2000 has nothing. I t  sits b y  the
computer, lik e a mysterious monolith
giving no indication of what it is.
In use though it is different. It will
handle 1200/75, 75/1200 and 300/300
allowing you to choose parity and so on.
All under software control.
Little can be said about the Modem
itself except that it is impressively silent
You could easily forget it.
Inside there is what appears to be non-
volatile R AM  which remembers your
password and ID (optional) and stores a

- -  it ?'f, (0>
1.213113
M O D E M
C o m m u n i c a t i o n s
list of your most often used computer
numbers. This saves much time and makes
it very, very easy to use. No setting up just
plug in and go.
No manual intervention is required to
seize the line, the modem does all that.
When you have dialled up you can hear
through it's inbuilt speaker the dialling
tone etc. When you have the tone it shuts
off and you are away.
The cartridge
The cartridge is the brain behind the
button. Plug in and the master menu is
presented.
The options are as follows.
1. MODEM MENU
This takes you to the dial menu. After
programming the numbers in when ﬁrst
used you select the computer you wish to
call and the modem auto dials.
2. SELECT OUTPUT DEVICE
With this you conﬁgure the disc/printer
type you have. This would need to be
done each time with a non-standard set
up but with a 1541 as device 8 and a
Commodore type printer this option can
be ignored.
E
This allows you to load from tape or disc a
previously stored frame.
4. DISC FUNCTIONS
From her e y ou c an display a  disc
directory, format discs, scratch ﬁles and so
on.
5. LOAD AUXILIARY PACK
You can load external programs designed
to r un with the TANDATA cartridge.
These may give you extra functions.
6. EDIT MAILBOX
Like the Prism modem this allows you to
prepare or edit stored mailboxes in order
to save on line time. Again the same
problem of text longer than a page can be
arise.
7. EDIT MEMORY
This is almost the same as EDIT MAILBOX
except that the one t o  be edited is
resident only in memory and not stored.
8. TERMINAL MODE
With this option you can enter 300/300
mode. When connected to your BB or
view data service from terminal mode the
screen will scroll and it is possible to direct
output straight to the printer as well as the
screen.
When you are connected to a service
there is a second menu which is called the
ON LINE MENU
From here you can
a. SAVE CURRENT FRAME
b. GO-OFF LINE (LOG OFF)
c. SEND ASCII FILE
d. SEND BASIC FILE
e, TOGGLE CALL TIMER. This is a built in
call timer which is  displayed o n the
bottom line of the screen. I ﬁnd it very
useful but it is surprising how fast the
minutes click away when you are on line.
For a  change this clock seems quite
accurate.
f. SEND EDITED FILE. This allows you to
send a disc/tape based frame.
g• SEND FRAME FROM MEMORY This
allows you t o send the ﬁle edited in
memory.
h. PRINT FRAME
i, REVEAL With this option y ou can
display hidden Prestel data. e.g. Answers
to quiz questions arid so on.
j. DOWNLOAD TELESOFTWARE I had
little success with this one, The Tandata
system requires the use of a tokenising
program and repeated attempts only
resulted in failure. I shall be trying again
soon.
k. SEND 800 This is effect a clear screen
when on line to Prestel/Micronet.
1. CLEAR MENU This returns you to the
point you were at prior to calling up this
menu.
For me the Tandata was the best of the
three with certain reservations.
The f a i l u r e  o f  teles oftv v ar e
downloading was disappointing though
there is so little on PIEL/M'net at the
moment I can live without it. The next is
the price. The IM200 must be in the
luxury class, but you get what you pay for
and to me it does seem a fair price for a
piece o f  e q u ip m e n t  w i t h  h i g h
speciﬁcations.
Having the cartridge based software
and the auto-dial facility meant that I
could get on line very quickly with no
setting up and I found that an advantage
as it is not unusual for me to log on to
Prestel 3 or 4 times a day.
Which one
Any of them is all I can suggest. They are
all good in their different departments.
Much depends on the amount you can
afford t o  spend and your reasons for
wanting to go on line.
Before I ﬁnish I think I should point
out another Modem which was reviewed
in an earlier issue. The PROTEK. Still the
cheapest on the market. I still use the
Protek regularly and ﬁnd it reliable, The
software could still do with rewriting as
you can often end up with screens full of
garbage but for the person who wants a
cheap but effective Prestel terminal and
one which is portable I still think it takes
some beating.
Commodore also produce a modem for
the 64. However this modem will only
work in 1200/75 baud rate mode and has
been covered numerous times in the
magazine already. It is a good modem, it
works well and you get a free subscription
to Compunet with it. Next month we will
be looking at Compunet and this modem
in a greater depth.
If anybody has  any  snippets o f
information they think may help other
readers or moans or gripes and so on, why
not leave me a message on Prestel. My
Prestel mbx number is 106434851. I will be
pleased to hear from you,

Tony Dennis explains exactly
ivhat you can do once you
have bought a modem for
your Commodore.
BUYING A  MOD EM GIVES THE
Commodore 64 or Vic 20 user access to a
wealth o f  information stored o n
mainframe computers all over the world.
Sadly many enthusiasts soon become
disillusioned because they cannot ﬁnd
any interesting telephone numbers to
call. Here is a brief overview of the
different telephone accessible services.
Some are free - others charge for access
time on the host computer, Start with the
freebies and then decide what's worth
paying for.
An obvious route for modem buffs is
to subscribe to Prestel. It is run by British
Telecom and was originally devised for
people to access using their television
sets. That is partly why the information is
displayed in the form of colour pages, and
virtually everything is done using the ten
numerals plus *(star) and (hash).
Taking out a subscription to Prestel
gives access t o  a  whole bunch o f
databases operated b y  travel agents,
banks, b u i l d i n g  societies a n d
manufacturers. There are areas devoted
to th e  legal profession, ﬁnancial
information such as currency and share
prices, and education as well as electronic
mail, For most Commodore owners,
though, it is well worth taking on a Prestel
subscription through Micronet. This area
is part of Prestel Microcomputing and
therefore tailored to  micro devotees.
Micronet has all the latest micro news,
reviews, free and chargeable software on-
line waiting for downloading and, o f
course, games. Micronet also happens to
be one of the most accessed parts of
Prestel with a  very loyal band o f
subscribers which number roughtly
15,000.
To get onto Micronet, a 1200/75 baud
modem and Prestel compatible software
are required. Don't worry because
Micronet, Modem House, and Tandata
among others sell all the necessary kit for
Commodore owners. At most times at
least one of these will throw in a free
initial subscription to Micronet with the
modem.
Commodore UK itself decided that its
micro owners (and currently only 64
owners) should have a service of their
own. Hence i t got together with a
computer bureau company called ADP
and Compunet was born. This service can
be accessed only by those who buy the
Compunet modem (around E99). It uses
pages of information like Prestel but the
commands are much more sophisticated.
A list of commands is displayed at the
bottom o f the screen with a  cursor
highlighting one o f them. The caller
moves through the list of commands in
either direction t o  get to  the one
required, It is known as a duck shoot as it
is possible to rotate through the list until
you arrive back at the starting point.
Compunet also has micro news,
software available for downloading and
electronic mail. The most popular part is
MUD (multi-user Dungeons & Dragons) a
game that originally started on Essex
University's computer. It is very much like
the board game with wizards, spells and
treasure to ﬁnd. The difference is that the
players are actually on-line together and
can be calling from any part o f the
country. Beware because the game is so
addictive that enormous phone charges
can easily be run up. Century who
operate the game for Compunet also
charge for playing time. Compunet is still
in its infancy and thus a much smaller
database than Micronet.
Both Micronet and Compunet can be
accessed for the cost of a local call from
most parts of the country. However, they
both charge for subscriptions to their
services. Luckily there are some services
which don't. Some local authorities like
Hackney have bought viewdata services
which have free areas for the general
public. They are fun to look at if you live in
the area or - in the case of C-View - fancy
a holiday in Rochford. The ITeCs (centres
for deprived youngsters t o  learn
computing skills) operate viewdata
services, too_ Each ITeC has its own special
interests so these boards tend to be very
different.
The ITeCs run software developed for
the BBC known as Communitel. Since
Communitel i s  n o w  commercially
available some enthusiasts have begun to
use to run their own bulletin boards.
What are bulletin boards? They are
messaging systems run on microcom-
puters by enthusiastic amateurs. When
connected up to one, the caller is able to
read and send messages to fellow micro
enthusiasts on virtually any topic. It is
possible to send private messages' to an
individual as well as public ones. Most
boards have Special Interest Groups
(SIGs) and there's nearly always one for
Commodore users. Th e  5iGs are
particularly useful fo r  asking other
people's advice o n  micro problems,
picking up the latest gossip and news on
products, and even meeting other users!
Most boards have free software for
downloading and some o f  i t  will
undoubtedly have been left there by
other kind hearted Commodore users.
Micronet, Hackney and Communitel
boards can all be accessed using Prestel
COMMUNICAT
software. Th e r/t also software available
for the Compunet modem which allows it
to be used with Prestel and even includes
the special Micronet downloading
protocols, but bulletin boards almost
inevitably require what has come to be
known as 'scrolling' software.
Instead of displaying information in
the form of pages. services like bulletin
boards send it in a continuous stream_
Thus as the screen ﬁlls up, the ﬁrst lines
sent begin to scroll off the bottom. In
order to access such services it is therefore
necessary to have what is known as a
terminal program. VIP terminal is the
most popular of this type of software.
Bulletin boards also operate at a
different baud rate (data transmission
speedy from Prestel, Micronet, etc. For
this a different modem will often be
needed. The cheapest is from Intelnet
which includes RS232 interface, modem
and software all in the same unit. With
such a modem another huge group of
services can be accessed.
The most popular are electronics mail
services like Telecom Gold, Easylink
One-to-One and Comet. They are mainly
aimed at business users since they are a
very cost effective method of sending
telexes. Unlike bulletin boards, these
electronic mail services can have
hundreds of callers accessing the system

Many c ompanies  w h i c h  k e p t
extensive databases o n  mainframe
computers found that they could recoup
some o f  t h e  costs b y  making t h e
information available on-line. In return
for subscription fees which often run into
hundreds of pounds it is possible to access
the Financial Times service, Hate! or
Hansard (Parliamentary) records kept by
Scicon•
Most such information providers are
riot anxious for micro users to subscribe.
The exception is an American company
called Dialog which actively promotes a
service for those with microcomputers.
Known as Knowledge Index, it  gives
access t o a whole range of databases
which were considered to be of general
interest. The cost is not too great but
naturally the service is only available at
off-peak times, when business subscribers
are not calling. The most exciting thing
about Knowledge Index is that British

callers are actually connected via an
international data switching network to
Dialog's computers in the USA.
Normally it is not possible to access
American services direct because their
modems use the Bell standard not CCITT
as in England. Thus the two really exciting
services for micro users in the States.
Cornpuserve and the Source are not
readily available.
The way around this is to pay for a
packet switching account (PSS) fr om
British Telecom. Packet switching takes
care of the difference in data protocols as
well as costing less than dialling direct. To
access Compuserve for example a British
Commodore user would have to pay for
the cost of a local call, the cost of PSS, plus
subscription and connection charges on
Compuserve itself. Not the thing for low
income modem buffs!

thus need a modem which supports Bell
frequencies. However, contact with our
American cousins is  possible v ia U K
bulletin boards which switch t o  Bell
frequencies at night like the Fido boards
and Mailbox-80 Liverpool.
Luckily most of the rest of the world
uses CCITT modems like us. Enthusiasts
can therefore phone boards in Europe,
South Afr ic a a n d  ev en Australia.
Naturally, the phone bill will be vast.
Finally, modem buffs usually come
around t o  wanting t o  run their own
bulletin board so that instead of making
outgoing calls, everybody phones them.
Currently I  know of only one system
which allows Commodore 64 owners to
host a board and that is Dial-a-match.
Available in the USA, it is intended as a
Lonely Hearts service. You would need to
be very lonely though becuse when any
substantial number of people has called,
disk access time becomes intolerably slow.

David Janda takes a look at
some programs to enhance a
your 64.
SIL
THERE IS A WHOLE RANGE OF BASIC
language extensions available for  the
Commodore 64. You could be forgiven
for asking why? The answer t o  that
question is twofold. First, the Basic on the
Commodore 64 is quite simply crummy.
Taking into account that the 64 offers
sprites, colour and sound it is amazing
that Commodore didn't produce a Basic
to utilise these features.
Secondly, the memory map of the
Commodore 64 is very ﬂexible. Many
people refer to the 64 *as being a soft'
machine. This is because it is very easy to
re-conﬁgure t h e  memory map, add
additional commands and so on.
In this, the ﬁrst part of a two part series,
I shall be taking a look at some of the
extended Basics available. Please note
that it would take months to cover every
one, s o w e  have selected t he most
popular ones currently available.
M CI  Basic — Micro
Component Trading
One problem faced by software houses
who produce this type of of package
concerns the contents. What commands
do you incorporate into a Basic extension
package?
The producers o f  MCT Basic have
overcome the problem in a novel way —
they hav e added c ommands  a n d
functions that are compatible with BASIC
V3.5. In other words, the extra goodies
found on the C16 and Plus/4.
The MCT Basic package consists of a
library-case style cassette holder with two
cassettes and documentation. The ﬁrst
cassette (incorporating t h e  Novaload
system) holds the Basic extensions which
include an assembler), whilst the second
contains a screen painter which is written
in MCT Basic. Documentation is supplied
in the form of a 23 page booklet which
describes (in small print) the operation of
the commands in a concise manner.
The package includes extensions
which cover three main areas. First there
are the C16 and Plus/4 additions, next
comes new Basic commands followed by
programming aids,
The user-interface o f  the screen-
editor has also been changed with the
addition of 17 new keyboard functions.
These functions are accessed by pressing
the ESC key followed by a letter and

perform operations such as line delete,
screen scroll up/down and so on. The
same functions can be used within a
program by using the PRINT command ie.
PRINT CHRS(27);CHRS(80);
Where 27 is the ASCII code for [SC and 80
is the code for a letter that performs a
function.
The four standard function keys have
been made more accessible by the KEY
command which has two forms. Entering
key in direct mode will display the current
function k ey  settings. KEY number,
"string" will assign a string to the speciﬁed
function key.
A fairly comprehensive selection of
graphic commands are included in MCT
Basic. Five graphic modes are made
available with the GRAPHIC command.
The graphic  commands inc lude
COLOUR, DRAW, CIRCLE, BOX, PAINT
and so on, Eight sprite commands are
included,
Programming a id s  in c lu d e t h e
essentials; AUTO, RENUMBER, DELETE,
OLD, TRON/TROFF. HELP will highlight
an e r r o r  i n  t h e  p r o g r a m  a n d
TRAP/RESUME/ERS simply allow t h e
programmer to trap errors - very handy
when de-buggingl
MCT Basic also includes a whole set of
improved and new commands. PRINT can
now use USING (for screen formatting).
RESTORE can be followed by  a  line
number and MIDS can be used on the left
of an argument. Added control structures
include ELSE, D O . .  LO O P, D O
UNTIL.. LOOP and DO WHILE.. LOOP.
It's a  great pity  that this package
doesn't include a facility to incorporate
the extensions within your own program
ie• without the use of the main MCT Basic
resident. As it stands, MCT Basic provides
a well balanced selection of commands
and functions which are both useful and
functional.

R e v i e w s
EXTENDED BASIC —
Mushroom Software
When I  ﬁrst looked at the instruction
manual for Extended Basic, I thought I was
looking at the BBC User Guide! The
package incorporates some commands
found in I3BC Basic including an in-line
three pass assembler.
Extended Basic fr om Mus hroom
software includes 47 new commands that
are divided into 13 groups. As mentioned
before, a  thr ee pass assembler i s
incorporated within Extended Basic, and
in my  opinion the package is worth
buying for that alone. (Machine code fans
may b e  interested t o  k now that an
updated version of the assembler can be
purchased separately for E5.95).
The package includes quite a few
commands, and it is not recommended
for t h e  absolute beginner. I  c a n
understand why, as many commands are
related with each other in some way t h e
sprite commands being example.
Although Extended Basic covers a
variety o f  programming requirements,
graphics and sprites are the main theme of
the package.
The graphic commands merely deal
with the colour settings for the paper, ink
and so on. The MODE command selects
the video mode and is conﬁgured as
shown in table 2.
The COLOUR command within the
hires group will explain MODE1 a little
better. Basically four colours are available
in MODEl. COLOUR pa,ph is used to
select a physical (ph) colour from the
pallet of 16 and assign it to the paint (pa).
To actually select a colour to be used in
high-res drawing the PAINT command is
used. Paint also has a second parameter
which selects o n e  o f  ﬁv e boolean
operations t o  b e  performed o n  t he
drawing.
Extended Basic is quite a complex
package that offers numerous commands.
Yet I believe it is over-complex in some
areas, and also feel that the operation of
some of the commands could have been
implemented in  a  more easy t o  use
manner.
EXTENDED BASIC —
Duckworth/Bug
A major  pr oblem associated w it h
extended Basics is complexity. A software
house will try and do better than the next
one b y  providing mor e a n d  mor e
sophisticated commands and functions.
For the novice programmer who has just
learnt Basic but would like a few more
commands confusion is the order of the
day.
Therefore, I  was relieved t o  use
Extended Basic fr om Duckworth/Bug
software. This cassette based package
offers the user 27 new commands that
either add new  features, o r  replace
complex POKEs.
The commands provided i n  this
version of Extended Basic are simple but
practical. One command is used to select
the screen mode whilst another selects
the graphic mode.
Colour control is achieved with just
one command -  COLOUR. Colour is
followed b y  eight parameters whic h
correspond to the colour registers with
the 64'.
Graphic functions include a  basic
PLOT command for use in both modes.
The DRAW command is followed by two
or more sets of co-ordinates, and draws a
line between the points speciﬁed. POINT
x,y,v w ill check t he screen location
pointed to by x and y for a colour whose
number is held in variable vo In other
words, it's a function that would be used
as an argument within an IF statement.
To round-off the graphics side o f
things, TYPE w ill display a  string o f
characters in both graphic modes. The
user speciﬁes the x and y co-ordinated as
well as the height and width (in pixels) of
each character.
I was highly impressed with the way
the sprite commands were incorporated
in this  package. The sprite shape is
deﬁned by using the SHAPE command.
The user enters SHAPE on one line, and
the following 21 lines are used to deﬁne
the shape itself. Each line starts with a
double-quote a n d  w her ev er  t h e
foreground is to appear a '1' is inserted.
The background is represented by a
and nothing, by  nothing! Using this
method enables  y o u  t o  ins tantly
recognise the shape of a sprite when
looking at the program listing.
SPRITE n  i s  followed b y  severt
parameters which set the mode, colour
and so on. The next two commands are
very handy! SMOVE n,x,y will move sprite
n to co-ordinates x y whilst COLLIDE n,v
which check to see if sprite n has collided
with another sprite or background. The
amount of the screen to be checked (in %
terms) is speciﬁed by v.
It was a  real pleasure using this
Extended Basic. The commands are just
right f o r  t h e  les s  ex per ienc ed
programmer a n d  I  w o u l d  a l s o
recommend the package to the more
experienced who wish to get some quick
results!

BASIC LIGHTNING — Oasis
Software
Basic Lightning from Oasis software is the
most comprehensive Basic extension I
have us ed o n  t h e  Commodore 64.
Adapted fr om White Lightning —  a
FORTH based package - Basic Lightning
offers over 150 commands and functions.
As well as the added features., Basic
Lightning allows for multi-tasking with up
to ﬁve parts of a program running at the
same time.
The commands cover three main
areas; graphics, sound and structured
programming. Oasis claim that i t  is
possible to produce commercial quality
software package, and in general I agree.
The planned addition of a compiler
later this year will mean that programs
developed with this package will run
independant of the main package.
Rather than attempt to describe the
vast numbers of commands available in
this package (just have a look at the sound
commands!), I will describe some of the
structured programming features i t

offers. Even a games programmer needs
good programming structures to write
fast and efﬁcient code, and this is often
overlooked by  other extension writers.
Thankfully, this is not the case with Basic
Lightning.
The ﬁr s t addition i s  t h e  ELSE
construct. Thus enabling you to say IF
SCORE =1000 THEN PRINT "GOOD" ELSE
PRINT "KEEP ON TRYING!".
As you can see, a very handy addition.
Not only that, but it is possible to 'nest'
ELSE's. Another form of the IF...THEN...
ELSE construct is as follows:
10 INPUT A
20 CIF A:1
30 PRINT "ERROR, TRY AGAIN!"
40 GOTO 10
50 CELSE
60 PRINT "NUMBER ACCEPTED"
70 A=A,A
80 CEND
Basically, CIF...CELSE...CEND provide a
means where the 'IF' construct can be
spread out over several lines. Notice the
automatic indentation for readability.
REPEAT...UNTIL is useful for setting
up a loop when you don't know how
many times a group of statements are to
be repeated. This is because REPEAT...
UNTIL works on a condition. A variation is
the WHILE., .WEND construct. T h e
difference her e i s  that t h e  tes t is
performed at the beginning of the loop.
The next item to consider is the CASE
statement. Originating from the Pascal
programming language, it offers a ﬂexible
means o f  branching giv en a  t r u e
condition. An example from the manual
demonstrates this:
10 INPUT A
20 CASE A
30 OF 3 : PRINT ''Three French hens."
40 OF 2,3 : PRINT "Two turtle doves."
50 OF 1,2,3 : PRINT "And a partridge in a
pear tree."
...And so on.
Finally, those of you who are jealous of
BBC Basics' procedures need not be
jealous any more! Procedures are fully
supported w it h in  Bas ic  Lightning.
Parameters may be passed to and from
them, local variables can be declared
even whole arrays can b e  passed as
parameters.
Basic Lightning i s  q u it e  s imply
excellent. But be warned, it is a complex
package t h a t  takes s ome t im e  t o
understand and appreciate!
Summary
The packages I have looked at this month
are all quite good. But there are a couple
of points worth bearing in mind. First, you
will ﬁnd it a tough job ﬁnding a package
that incorporates all the features that you
want. Secondly, big is not necessarily
beautiful. I  wouldn't, f o r  example,
recommend Basic Lightning t o  t h e
absolute beginner!

More and more games are appearing on
the market that ar e based around
television series or ﬁlms. Give My Regards
to Broadstreet from Argus Press Software
being an excellent example of how a good
game can be made from a ﬁlm plot.
Both game and ﬁlm are based around
Paul McCartney who is trying to ﬁnd some
missing sections of the master tape for his
latest album. In the game you play the part
of Mr McCartney and must dash around
an authentic map of London trying to
locate your friends to see if they have the
missing pieces.

Make your graphics
programming easier
with these helpful 4
routines from AP and
DI Stephenson
SEVEN ROUTINES ARE PRE-
sented here and are given in
assembly language form in Pro-
gram 11.1 All the routines are
used by the function plotter
program described i n  this
months BASIC FACTS article, A
hex loader program, with the
object code in  DATA state-
ments, is given and should ease
the task o f  ty ping i n  t h e
program. However, if you wish
to modify  o r  improve t h e
routines then the Assembly
language listing is  the best
course of action. Please make
sure you SAVE the source code
on tape before attempting to
execute any code. A  simple
typing error or omission will
almost certainly cause t h e
system to crash.
The routines
Programming high resolution
graphics, u s in g  s tandar d
CBM64 BASIC, can be rather
tedious. I n  a d d it io n  t h e
execution s peed c a n  b e
painfully slow. A  few simply
machine code routines, of the
type given in this article, are
very useful in areas such as
graph plotting especially if they
can b e  called fr om BASIC.
Figure 1  lists t h e  available
routines.
Clearing the bit map
area
Before we even start using hi-
res graphics, it is necessary to
clear the bit map. an 8000 byte
area o f  memor y , corres-
ponding to a graphics screen of
320 by 200 pixels. This area is
normally placed a t  address
$2000 (B152 decimal) but can
easily b e  r e p o s it io n e d .
Clearing the bit map with a
series of POKEs from BASIC
would take several seconds to
execute whereas a  machine
code version would appear to
execute instantaneously. A n
example of such a routine is
that of CLEARMAP (lines 930 to
1090).
Setting u p  screen
memory
Two colours are available in
high resolution mode. A one
byte number is used to set up
the t w o  c olours  that a r e
available. The upper nybble
speciﬁes the colour (coded 0 to
15) of any pixel represented by
a binary one in the bit map. The
lower nybble is the colour code
of any pixel represented by a
binary z er o. T h e  des ired
combination o f  colours are
POKEd i n t o  t h e  loc ation
labelled SCRCOL O E hex or
254 decimal) prior to a call to
!NIT or SCRFILL. For example,
P0KE254,7 would specify black
graphic s  o n  a  y e l l o w
background. Refer  t o  t h e
program breakdown for details
of the coding.
The INIT ROUTINE
This routine sets u p all the
default bit map addresses and
screen memory and calls the
CLEARMAP a n d  SCRFILL
routines. It is also responsible
for s etting u p  t h e  raster
interrupt SERVICE routine by
resetting t h e  interrupt IR Q
vector. By using raster interrupt
techniques, the screen can be
split between high resolution
graphics and a text window at
the bottom o f  t he screen.
Before calling the INIT routine
with SY549152 it is necessary to
set up a few locations. Firstly,
the colour information needs
to be present in location SFE
(254). For testing purposes try
P0KE254,7 as described above.
Secondly, the position of the
screen split needs to be set up
in location $02 (2 decimal). This
should be in the range 51 to 251
corresponding to the top and
1,
bottom of the visible screen. A
ﬁgure of $D8 (216) leaves a text
window of about four lines. Try
POKE2,216.
XY coordinate plotting
According t o  t h e  C8M64
programmers reference guide,
the address i n  whic h t h e
character memory dot (X,Y) is
located is given by: BYTE=BASE
+ R0W•320 + CHAR•8 + LINE.
POKE BYTE.PEEK(BYTE) OR 2 t
BIT
where,
BASE =  t h e  b i t  map start
address. By default, $2000 (8192
decimal) ROW = INT(Y/8). The
character row number (0 to 24)
containing the Y coordinate.
LINE = (Y AND 8). The character
line (0 to 7) which contains the
Y coordinate.
CHAR = INT(X/8). The position
of the character within the row
whic h c o n t a i n s  t h e  X
coordinate (0 to 39).
Rearranging the
equations
Obviously, t h e  a b o v e
calculations would b e  fairly
lengthy if executed in BASIC.
CLEARMAP: a fast routine for clearing the bit map
area of memory.
2. SCRF ILL, a routine for setting up the screen memory
area with the colour information needed by the VIC II
chip.
3. PLOTBIT, A routine for lighting up any individual pixel
from supplied X,Y screen coordinates.
4. VLIN, a routine for drawing a vertical line of a chosen
length.
5. HLIN, a routine for drawing a horizontal line of
chosen length.
6. SERVICE, this is the interrupt routine which handles
split screen text and graphics windows.
7. INIT, an initialisation routine for the raster interrupt
sequence. It also calls on the subroutines CLEARMAP
and SCRFILL.
Fortunately, we can rearrange
the equation so that machine
coding c an b e  performed
efﬁciently. We need to expand
the equation so that, as far as
possible, all multipliers and
divisors are exact powers of
two. T h is  s impliﬁes  a l l
multiplication and division to
simply shifting bits to the left or
right r es pec tiv ely . T h e
r ear r angement c a n  b e
performed as follows:
ADDRESS= BASE + ROW*320 +
LINE + CHAR*8
This can be expanded to,
ADDRESS = BASE + 40*(ROW*8)
+ LINE + CHAR*8
ADDRESS= BASE+ 3r  (Rows)
+ LINE + CHAR*8
By substituting the equations
for ROW, LINE and CHAR and
setting BASE at default $2000
we ﬁnally arrive at:
ADDRESS = $2000 + 32*(INT
(Y/8)*13) + 8*(INT(Y/8)*8) + (Y
AND 7) + INT(X/8)
It is now relatively easy to
convert the ﬁnal equation to
machine c o d e .  A l l  t h a t
INT(Y/8) entails is shifting Y
right three times, thus dividing
by e ig h t  a n d  los ing t h e
remainder ( the thr ee least
s igniﬁc ant b i t s  o f  Y ) .

Program Listing
Multiplying b y  8  is  t h e n
achieved by shifting the result
left thr ee times. However,
there is an even simpler way of
calculating 1NT(Y/8)*8. I n
effec t, t h e  a b o v e  t w o
operations simply clear the 3
least signiﬁcant bits  o f  Y.
Therefore masking o u t  t h e
three least signiﬁcant bits of Y
with AND $F13 will produce
the same result. Similarly, the
INT(X/8)*8) term can be coded
by ANDing the lower byte of X
with SFB. Remember that the
speciﬁed X  coordinate w ill
occupy t w o  bytes i n  this
graphics mode (0 to 319). If the
X coordinate is  stored i n
locations labelled XCOORD
and XCOORD+1 the following
code should temporarily store
the lo w  by te result i n  the
location STORE.
[BA XCOORD
AND SFI3
STA STORE
We a r e  e v e n  m o r e
fortunate in coding the term
32*(1NT(Y/8)*8). This simpliﬁes
even further because logically
shifting Y right three times and
storing it as the high byte of the
result is  all that is  needed.
However, this is only possible
because the 3 least signiﬁcant
bits of Y are redundant. If the Y
coordinate is  stored i n  the
location labelled YCOORD it
follows that t h e  result o f
32*(INT(Y/8)*8) can always be
stored in the location LOC+1
the low byte is always zero. The
process c an b e  c oded as
follows:

STA LOC+1
Two further shifts right of
the 32*(INT(Y/8)*13) r es ult
(dividing t w o  twice) giv es
8*(INT(Y/8)*8). The high byte
of the former w ill s till b e
present in the accumulator, the
low byte is always zero. This can
be coded as,
LSR A
ROR LOC

Notice that LOC is not strictly
necessary in the result of the
previous operation since it is
always z ero. However, b y
reusing it for future calcula-
45
=7==============

tions we save instructions and
memory locations.
The remaining (Y AND 7)
term is easy to code, the result
will be in the accumulator:
LDA YCOORD
AND # 7
If the page address of the bit
map base address ($20) i s
present in the location labelled
BMPAGE, t h e n  t h e  ﬁn a l
addition of all the terms gives
the address of the location in
which the relevant bit is to be
set. The corresponding code in
Program 11.1 is similar but has
been messed around a bit for
efﬁciency.
Finally, in order to select the
individual bit corresponding to
the required pixel we need a
mask byte t o  O R with the
address found above. The mask
can be constructed by setting
the carry and rotating right the
required number of times. The
loop counter can be initialised
from the three least signiﬁcant
bits o f  X C O O R D .  T h e

Program Listing (cont.)
Once this has been done a
SY549156 call will light up the
pixel a t  t he chosen screen
coordinate.
The VLIN routine
This is a very simple routine
that draws a vertical line on the
high resolution screen b y
implementing t h e  loc ation
YCOORD prior to calling the
PLOTBIT subroutine. Before
calling, set up the following
locations with legal values.
Start X coordinate low byte.
Location SRI (251).
Start X coordinate high byte.
Location SFC (252).
Start Y  coordinate. Location
SFD (253)
Length of vertical line in range
1 t o  200. Location $C201
(49665).
The VLIN routine can be
called f r o m  BASIC  w i t h
SYS49160.
The HLIN routine
This is similar to above but
draws a  horizontal line b y
incrementing the X coordinate
values pr ior  t o  calling t h e
PLOTBIT s ubr outine. T h e
routine i s  s lightly  m o r e
complex because two bytes
each are used for the lengthy
information and X coordinate
values. Remember that t h e
width o f  the screen is  320
pixels. Before c alling fr om
BASIC with SY549164 set up the
following locations with legal
values.
Start X coordinate, low byte.
Location SF13 (251).
Start X coordinate, high byte.
Location SFC (252).
Start Y  coordinate. Location
VD  (253)
Length of horizontal line, low
byte. Location $C201 (49665).
Length of horizontal line, high
byte. Location $C202 (49666).
The raster I nterrupt
SERVICE routine.
This is a fairly complex piece of
programming to explain so is
best treated in detail in the
program breakdown section.
The SERVICE routine is called
each time a raster interrupt
occurs this will be at the top of
the screen for  graphics and,
say, two thirds of the way down
the screen for text.

Assign labelled loc ations  f o r
convenience and ease of program-
ming.
Causes assembly at location $C000
(49152) onwards.
Form a jump table which calls the
chosen routines and returns either
to the machine code program that
called it  or back to BASIC, This
practice can save considerable time
when modiﬁcations are made, since
the routines would all have the
same apparent calling addresses.
Where possible, always use labels
and force the assembler to do the
tedious work.
Disables interrupts while vectors
are changed.
Clear the screen.
Set the labelled location BMPAGE
to $20 which contains the default
base page address of the bit map.
Calls the screen memory ﬁll routine
SCRF ILL.
Set bit zero of Control Register A
(CRA) of the CIA. This in effect stops
the n o r m a l  k e y b o a r d  s c an
interrupts every 1/60th of a second.
Redirect the interrupt IRQ vector to
the SERVICE routine.
Sets the raster interrupt to occur at

A.P. and D.J. Stephensor
provide a handy plotting
routine, together with a
program to make graph
plotting a little easier.
WE THOUGHT THE BEST WAY TO ILL-
ustrate the use of graphics and raster
interrupts was to provide a full working
program for plotting the graph of any
function. We could have concentrated on
games graphics but so much has already
been written on the subject. Anyway, the
Commodore 6 4  deserves a  change
sometimes.
It is comparatively easy to use the low
resolution 'chunky' graphics available in
standard C ommodor e 6 4  BASIC.
However, unless special ROM modules
are installed, high resolution graphics,
programmed in BASIC, can be dreadfully
slow. Because of this, we advise you to
employ mac hine c ode routines t o
supplement the deﬁciencies of BASIC.
However, this series is supposed to be
about BASIC so how can we bring in
machine code without involving readers
who do not feel justiﬁed in devoting the
necessary study time to this admittedly
more difﬁcult subject? A  reasonable
compromise is  t o  provide a  BASIC
program which calls on machine code
subroutines for handling the tricky bits.
The problem of entering the machine
code bytes is easily overcome by means of
a separate program which loads the
machine code hexadecimal bytes, (see
Program 11.1).
Program 11.1 must be RUN before the
main BASIC program can be used so we
must deal with this ﬁrst.
Details of the hex loader
The object of the program is to read in
that r at her  f or midable b lo c k  o f
hexadecimal data bytes, representing the
machine c o d e ,  a n d  s t o r e  t h e m
sequentially in memory, starting at the
usual safe address $C000 (the second line
in the program assigns this address 49152
in decimal to the variable M). Now it is
very unlikely, however skilled you are at
the keyboard, that all those data bytes are
going to be entered ﬁrst time without
error. The bytes are virtually meaningless
and, because they do not correspond to
any observable pattern, must be entered
!
E
 blindly and without mnemonic aid.
Because of the error prone nature we
have used a  useful trick known as a
checksum which will automatically spot
the slightest error made during data byte
entry at the keyboard. Some readers may
T• H • E
IF•A•C•T•S
be unfamiliar  w it h  t h e  checksum
technique so a few words of explanation
are indicated. After the machine code
bytes have been carried out and proven
during the development stages, they are
added and the resultant ﬁgure preserved
for subsequent use when the bytes are
entered. In this case, the checksum of the
bytes, rather surprisingly, happened to be
a nice round ﬁgure of 46000. This value
has been assigned to the variable CH in
the second line of the program. When the
program is RUN, the hex bytes are added
up and the ﬁnal sum checked with CH
(see line 130). Is it  fool proof? Well,
almost! I t  is  possible, but extremely
unlikely, that you make two or more
keying errors which together produce a
compensation error which just happens
to equal the correct checksum. Because
such a possibility is remote., you can safely
bet that if you get the message 'CODE
LOADED OK' all bytes are good. We
would warn you however, that you should
always SAVE a  reserve copy o f  any
program involving machine code, o r
POKEs before it is actually RUN. It is quite
possible that, if you have made an error,
the machine will crash causing loss of all
bytes and you will have to start again from
scratch -  a dismal prospect even for the
most philosophical of us.
Although we make no attempt here to
explain how the machine code sections
work, details are to be found in this
month's  a c c o m p a n y in g  a r t i c l e
MASTERING MACHINE CODE. Both
these series are drawing towards their
closing months so we thought it would be
nice for the two paths to converge.
Finally, it must be emphasised once
again that Program 11.1 must be entered
and RUN before the BASIC program 11.2
Details of the graph plotting
program
Most people shun mathematics, although
some g r u d g in g ly  a d m it t e d  t h a t
mathematics can b e  useful at  times,
particularly i n  t h is  mo d e r n  age.
Fortunately, the computer has made
many people aware of the importance of
maths and, because it can take on much of
the borging drudgery, more and more are
showing signs o f  actually lik ing t he
subject. Ap a r t  f r o m  handling t h e
arithmetic, the computer comes into its
own when dealing with graphical output.
An equation comes to life when it  is
presented in form of a graph, showing
how one quantity varies in response to
changes in another. Program 11.2 does
just that.
Program details
As its name implies, the program accepts
an equation, together with certain details,
entered from the keyboard, and proceeds
to plot the curve in high resolution form.
The curve appears against a background
of calibrated X and Y axes known as
cartesian coordinates, For example, we
can take a simple equation such as Y X
The progressively increasing values of X
are plotted on the horizontal axis and the
X squared values on the vertical or Y axis.
The range of X values will have to be
stated by the operator by entering the
lowest and highest values. Obviously, real
equations will not necessarily be in terms
of X and Y but this is of no importance -as
far as this program is concerned, its just a
question of variable names.
The program distinguishes between
two fundamental ty pes  o f  gr aph,
continuous a n d  discontinuous. Mos t
curves are continuous, in the sense that
the variables progress smoothly with no
sudden breaks or violent lurches towards
inﬁnity or -
the computer the range of X values and it
will then calculate all the corresponding Y
values which, in most cases, would be well
within the capability of the computer's
numerical limit. Most equations likely to
be encountered a r e  lik e  t his  b u t
occasionally we come across an awkward
specimen. To quote a few examples, Y =
sin X, Y = cos X, Y = sin X + cos X - 2X are
three ex amples  o f  w e l l  behav ed
continuous functions. On the other hand,
the equations Y = tan X or Y = 1/X are two

examples of discontinuous curves and will
tend to inﬁnity at certain points. Now
computers, as you probably k now, are just
as wary of inﬁnity as mathematicians are.
There is an upper and lower ﬁnite limit to
the magnitude o f  a  number that a
computer can handle without spitting out
an error message of some kind. This
means that a function plotter must ﬁrst ask
the operator whether the function is
continuous o r  discontinuous. I f  t h e
operator tells  t h e  c omputer i t  i s
continuous, then the Y axis is scaled
automatically and it is only necessary to
enter the range of X values over which the
equation is to be plotted. On the other
hand, if the function is discontinuous,
then it will be necessary for the operator
to give the Y value range as well as the X
value range.
The plotting density, which is another
way of  stating the resolution, can be
deﬁned by the operator on a scale of 1 to
4. Plotting density 1 gives the lowest
resolution (small number o f  plotting
points) and plotting density 4 the highest
plotting density and therefore the slowest
in execution.
There are no error trapping facilities in
BASIC so be prepared for the program to
break out i f  incorrect equations are
entered. It is also possible for a break out
to occur i f  the calculations attempt
division by zero. If this happens, try the
program again with different limits of X or
perhaps with a different plotting density.
This may avoid the region where the
division by zero is occuring.
Using the program
To obtain initial familiarity with t he
program, an example equation is already
programmed into line 1000. So, in the ﬁrst
instance, the procedure is:
1. Enter RUN and press RETURN. After
some explanatory messages, t h e
program comes to a halt.
2, Enter RUN 1000 and press RETURN.
You will then be asked to supply the
following information:
"ENTER X AXIS (MIN)", Try O.
"ENTER X  AXIS (MAX)". Try 6.28
(which is approximately 2 times pi)
since this will produce a graph of sine x
over nearly one complete cycle.
"ENTER PLOTTING DENSITY (1-4)".
Suggest you reply with 1, the lowest
density but fast to execute.
"AUTO Y AXIS LIMITING (Y/N)". This
is really asking if the curve is contin-
uous and therefore suitable f o r
automatic scaling of the X axis. The
built in equation is indeed continuous
because it is the sin X function and so
you will enter Y.
Assuming everything is OK with your
program and the machine code bytes
(mentioned earlier) are already resident
in RAM, the program should begin to
draw the typical sinusoidal graph of the
function extending ov er  o n e  cycle,

together with calibrated pips on the X and
Y axis. You can then try out the program
again with perhaps different X limits and
perhaps a higher plotting density. For
example, try the effect of X (MIN) = -6.28
and X (MAX) = 12.5 and a plotting density
of 4. This should show almost three
complete cycles of a sine wave.
Using your own equations
Once you have gained familiarity with the
program you will naturally want to enter
your own equations instead of sticking to
the one built in. The instructions to do this
are presented on the screen during the
initial r un b u t  i t  is  worth giving an
example. Suppose you want to graph the
equation, Y = 3X + 4X
enter, when the ﬁrst part of the program
has come to a halt, would be:
1000 DEF FN EQ (X)=3*X+4•X 3
This, of  course, will now replace the
original line 1000. You must then enter
RUN 1000 before t h e  program w ill
continue. The rest is up to you.
If the equation you want happens to
be discontinuous, then your reply to the
query "AUTO Y AXIS LIMITING (Y/N)"
must be N. You will then be asked to enter
your own Y  limits instead o f  relying
on automatic scaling. I f  you have no
knowledge whatsoever of the behaviour
of the function, then this will be very
much a trial and error process which must
continue until the Y limits are deemed
acceptable.
Those who, in the past, have spent
hours plotting equations on graph paper
with paper and pencil (and rubber) will
appreciate the value of this program. An
equation like Y = 3 sin X + 3.67 (cos X-sin X
would b e  drawn i n  seconds by  the
computer. How long would it take you
without one?
How the program works
Drawing some sort of graph on the screen
is relatively easy. The trouble arises when
you have to tailor the graph to make full
use of the available screen area and, more
importantly, to avoid overstepping the
boundaries. This means that all actual X
values and corresponding Y values can
not be used in their raw form. This means
that,
a) The maximum and minimum Y values
must ﬁrst be found.
b) The calculations must then be scaled to
ﬁt into the screen area but without
wasting any space.
c) The scaled values must then be trans-
formed into the appropriate screen
coordinates.
As you will appreciate, the entire
project is far from easy and so you will
understand why the program may seem
rather lengthy. Another complication is
the production of calibration pips on the

screen. The program has been arranged
so that the pips represent integral powers
often. This should make it easy to read off
the values. A text window, of about four
lines, at the foot of the screen is employed
to display t he values o f  these axes
graduation increments. Raster interrupt
techniques are used to display and switch
between the high resolution screen and
the text screen.
The program has been written, as far as
possible, i n  t ight ,  s elf c ontained,
subroutines, The meat of the program
begins at line 1000 with a batch of ﬁve
user-deﬁned functions followed by the
set of keyboard prompt messages. This is
all fairly straight forward asking for X and
Y value limits, plotting densities etc.
Calling the Machine Code NIT
routines
1 5 4  L i n e  1190 calls an initialising machine
code routine called INIT. This machine
code subroutine sets u p  t h e  faster
interrupts, clears screen memory and the
8K bit map area. Two parameters need to
be passed before calling the INIT routine_
1_ The two colours allowable in the
standard high resolution mode need to be
POKEed into location $FE (254 decimal).
The upper nibble (4 bits or half a byte) is
set to zero (black) and the lower nibble is
set to 7 (yellow). Therefore POKEing 7 into
location 254 speciﬁes a black graph on a
yellow background.
1 The position of the screen split
between graphics and text needs to be
POKEd into location $02 (2). POKEing 216
into location 2 produces a text window of
about four lines at the bottom of the
screen.
The subroutines
CALL VLIN ROUTINE (G OS UB 4000)
Draws a vertical line of length, L%,
starting a t  t h e  screen coordinates
speciﬁed by X% and Y%. The purpose of
using the DEFined function FN LO(X%)
and FN HI (X%) is to split the X screen
coordinate X%, which may exceed 255,
into two-byte form for direct POKEing
into locations SF13 (251) and $FC (252). The
length parameter, L%, must be POKEed
into location $C200 (49665).
L% should be within the range 1 to 200.
Y% should be within the range 0 to 199.
X% should be within the range 0 to 359.
Once the parameters have been POKEd
the machine code subroutine is called
from BASIC with SYS 49160.
CALL HLIN ROUTINE (CO RM 5000)
This sets up the parameters and calls a
machine code routine for  drawing a
horizontal line. Parameters are identical
to above except of course that L% can be
as large as 360. Therefore the functions FN
LO(L%) and FN HI(L%) are needed to
POKE the necessary bytes into $C200
(49665) and SC201 (49666).
CALL PLOTBIT ROUTINE (GOSLIB 6000)
Lights up a pixel at the prescribed
screen coordinates b y  calling o n  a
machine code subroutine from BASIC
with SYS 49156. The parameters that need
to be POKEd prior to calling are the X
coordinate X% and the Y coordinate Y%.
The X coordinate value must be split into
low byte and high byte form as above. The
Y coordinate value V% is always less than
255 s o can b e  POKEd directly. The
machine code subroutine itself is called
from BASIC with SYS 49156.
PLOT G
Plots the actual graph with the aid of
FN XC and FN VC, These scaling functions
translate the actual values of X and Y to a
scaled value within the available screen
area. The subroutine frequently employs
the CALL PLOTBIT SUBROUTINE to light
up individual pixels corresponding to the
graph.
TABULATION (GOMA  8000)
This subroutine is  responsible for
ﬁnding t he maximum and minimum
values of the function and also calculating
all Y values corresponding to the X values.
The individual results are then held in the
array Y (N), ready for use in plotting the
graph. If the function, was deemed by the
operator to be discontinuous, (answered
N to the query instead of V) then lines 8040
and 8050 are not skipped.
DRAWS AXIS (GOSUB 9000)
Draws the X and Y axis of the graph.
DRAW AXIS DIVISIONS (COSUB 10000)
Draws and positions the calibration
pips which are to appear on the axis. Each
large graduation interval, corresponding
to an integer power of ten, is further
divided into 3 small graduations to assist
accurate readings of the graph.
FIND G R A D U A  T/ON I N C R E ME N T
(GOSUB 11000)
This subroutine calculates the range
and integer powers of ten increment for
the graduation pip positioning and is used
in c onjunc tion w it h  t h e  previous
subroutine.

Runecaster discovers that
adventures don't really need
text with two games that set
new standards for adventure
programs.
SOME MONTHS BACK WE LOOKED AT
that incredible arcade adventure
'Impossible Mission'. Fantastic graphics
and as has been proved by its sales, a
winner all the way. In between guiding
the hero around the screen in all sorts of
athletic manoeuvres, various operations
are performed by moving a cursor over a
selection of small pictures, or icons, to
issue input commands to the computer.
This use of icons is very much in vogue
at the moment, with many business
systems using this technique in striving to
make programs ultra simple and
foolproof to use. More often than not
speed of use is sacriﬁced slightly, as it is
often quicker to type LOAD PROGRAM
than to manipulate a cursor over the
appropriate icon and initiate the
command!
Nevertheless 'icon driven' programs
have much to offer, by making input
commands limited to only those that may
be understood and acted upon. They
often employ good graphic effects,
especially when full colour, hi-res
pictures are used, such as in Beyond
Software's 'Shadowf ire'
Shadowf ire
The instruction booklet insists that there
are NO riddlesome texts to impede the
fast ﬂow of  real time, high speed
adventure. The screen presentation is in a
word -excellent -and although the speed
of operation is in practice, perhaps not so
fast as one has been lead to expect; it is
difﬁcult to see how the independent
handling of six different characters could
be improved upon by any other system.
The basic scenario revolves around the
kidnapping of one Ambassador Kryxix,
who has a  t op secret micro-disc
imbedded in his spine (!). He must be
rescued quickly and at any cost.
Super baddie General Zoff, holds
Kryxix captive aboard his personal 'sky-
fortress' behind an asteroid belt. Who can
possibly penetrate such a heavily defen-
ded position and successfully complete
this mission in such a short time.
Enter...Enigma, a  secretive
organisation with its operatives a classic
mixture of whiter than white, noble and
dedicated 'super persons' together with
barely controlled 'super criminals' and
the latest in cybernetic androids.
You have control (well almost), over
this team of stalking death dealers. You
have one hour and forty minutes in which
to locate and free the prisoner, capture
General Zoff and destroy his skyfortress.
Use the time wisely, you will need every
second.
Control may be either from the
keyboard, analogue or digital joysticks
(the normal joystick is digital) or even by
the use of a  light-pen. Reading the
operating manual is a must! You may not
assimilate all that it has to tell you at the
ﬁrst read but to start your mission some or
all o f  your team have got t o be
transported over t o General Zoffs
skyfortress. Without reading the manual
this may take you some time to organise!
Likewise each team member has
specialised training in various areas. So
before you start arming them for the
ensuing mission.. .read the manual. Only
one can carry and operate the portable
transporter beacons. Only one can
successfully pick the locks to be found on
the enemy craft.
You may only issue orders to one
person at a time (is an android a person?)
On selecting the member to instruct, the
display graphically shows you that
person's status strength, agility, stamina
and the weight they are carrying.
The display also depicts graphically the
present status of all the team members -
whether they are inactive, attacking,
moving defending, weak, dying etc. A
'view screen' gives you a plan of the
immediate area around the chosen
character, including other team members
and enemy patrols (if either is present).
Finally a box at the bottom right of the
screen encloses the icons for further
commands. You may choose the Object,
Movement or Battle screens, or you may
Quit issuing commands on that screen.
Choose the Object screen and you will
again be presented with a series of icons.
Those in the box to the right allow you to
manipulate the objects shown in the
other two boxes. Those to the left are
what is visible at that location and those in
the centre are what that character is
already carrying. The control icons permit
picking up, dropping, activation or
readying for use. Three others enable you
to display the other control screens or
Quit.
The Movement screen displays eight
arrows indicating the possible directions
of movement, although not all eight
directions may be permitted.
The Battle screen allows the choice of
attack, defend, retreat or just observe; in
any of eight directions. Having made your
choice, any characters visible in that
direction are displayed in a box on the
left.
As you may have gathered, starting out
A d v e n t u r e s

takes a little concentration! Fortunately
the learning period is short, partially due
to the clear instructions and partially due
to the simplistic icon control system.
Moving around...
Again...read the manual! Android
Manto; is the only team member who can
operate the transporter beacons and the
wrong sequence of moves can leave
Manta on the enemy craft without any
means of returning, or of summoning any
help!
When transporting any team
members, make sure that they are
adequately armed...you may well meet
some enemy troopers sooner than you
expect. Also take note of the brief notes
on your team's character proﬁles...there
is more in them than ﬁrst meets the eye.
Like any adventure game you cannot
expect to solve this one at one sitting. You
will need to map out the enemy ship if
only to ﬁnd out what are mere cupboards
and what are important passageways.
Remember that some characters move
faster than others and could well prove to
be admirable scouts.
Unlike most adventures there do not
appear to be many objects to ﬁnd and
puzzle over, ..on the other hand not all
objects found are described in the
manual. Some are weapons, even if you
don't know exactly what they do!
The frequency of meeting enemy
troops also appears to be somewhat
random, and one early game had me
manoeuvring ﬁve characters around for
over an hour with only two 'incidents' and
nothing of great interest to report!
Although the 'icon drive' system
works very well and new screen displays
are 'drawn' very quickly for a hi-res
screen, there is an appreciable delay
whilst you are itching to DO something.
There are plenty of locations to explore
but really very little variety in the objects
to be found.
There is a SAVE game facility, so before
entering into what may be  a  fatal
confrontation with the enemy - you can
always 'hedge your bets'. Never forget
that 'he who runs away, lives to ﬁght
another day'!
The puzzles are more of 'mapping'
and 'battle strategy'.. if you like the
'hunter killer' scenario then 'Shadowﬁre'
is a must. Even if this is not your ﬁrst
choice in adventure games, it will surely
be a classic of its type and I suspect will
tempt you back many times as you
attempt to better your previous efforts...
It is also interesting to note that
Beyond propose to offer a 'Shadowﬁre
Tuner' in the Autumn, This will allow you
to alter the Enigma team's strengths and
weaknesses, re-locate weapoons and
objects, map Out the skyfortress and
more! Could this be because they think
the game is too easy.. .or too hard.

OV GARGCIVIt CAWS
Whichever is the answer, it can only add
to the possibilities of a good game.
Tir na Nog
Here we have another graphic arcade
adventure, it has to have the word
'arcade' because a certain amount of
dexterity is called for in controlling our
hero Cuchulainn. It is more truly a pure
graphics adventure.
Tir na Nog is the Land of Youth in Irish
myth, the same world in which the
inhabitants of the fairy mounds lived.
Cuchulainn was a great hero of Ulster
again in Irish legend, and the stories of his
prowess and daring are legion.
Gargoyle Games have combined a
number of factual (well I believe in race
memory anyway...) a nd fanciful
situations and places to produce quite a
remarkable adventure. The aim being to
guide Cuchulainn in ﬁnding the four
scattered parts of the Seal of Calum, The
only answer to controlling or inhibiting
the Great Enemy. The seal was shattered
eons ago, freeing the Enemy to pursue his
evil ways.
The shade o f  the  dead hero
Cuchulainn strolls, strides and ambles
across your screen in search of the four
parts o f  t he  seal. The  graphic
representation of  this hero is quite
heroic! The ﬁgure is large enough on your
display to quite stir one's admiration for
the programmer.
The background scrolls smoothly past
giving the nearest yet to the idea of
computer movies. Control is from the
keyboard, and is not the easiest thing to
come to grips with! You can in fact only
direct him to move to the left or the
right...but, to confuse the issue, you can
view him from any of four directions! This
means he can walk to the East by either
moving t o the left or  the right -
depending upon whether you are looking
at him from the South or the North!
-
C144111(1101Nk? N M
C o
Initially this takes quite a bit of getting
used to...
To make matters worse there are any
number of Sidhe wandering around.
Should you meet one of these creatures
and not possess a weapon that can affect
them, you are sent back (you cannot be
killed.. .you are already dead!) to your
starting place by the Altar of the Seal. If
you are unable to control our hero with
any certainty, then the more likely you are
to loose any objects found to date and
end up starting again!
The moral here is to spend time right at
the beginning learning how to control his
movements, Once you have some
semblance of control, then you must
begin to map Tir na Nog.
The Sidhe are presumably degenerate
descendants of the Side of the myths-the
original inhabitants of the fairy mounds
that abound in Tir na Nog. Enter these and
although time does not slow down as in
the myths, you may well be in for a
surprise when you take a  different
exit.. .Magical transportation is  fairly
common!
Artefacts lie around for the taking and
all appear to have some use.. .you just
have to ﬁnd what that use is! Also bear
in mind that there are a number of in-
visible 'doorways', so if you seem to be in
an impossible situation, keep moving in
different directions. , .there is probably an
exit you cannot see!
Each object that you pick up may be
used as a weapon and you have the choice
of those carried as to which to use. Again
this means quite a long 'learning cycle'
while you learn what is effective where.
On the other hand there is a SAVE game
facility...make use of it...
Deﬁnitely a game to investigate, with
plenty of interest that maintains a Celtic
mythos most convincingly. Frustrating on
many occasions but once you have got the
hang of what is expected of you.. .quite
addictive,

Adventure Map Generator by Malcolm
Clarkson of Scunthorpe.
I have mentioned many times, the
necessity t o  map your travels within
adventure games and have on several
occasions drawn your attention to the
excellent Adv entur e Planner pads
produced by Print 'n' Plotter. Malcolm's
program will enable those of you with a
printer to create your own...
The program will work on a CBM 64
with an MPS 801 or equivalent printer. As
written it will print 320 squares on a sheet,
in a 16 x 20 grid. The listing, variable list
and line notes should be self explanatory.
The squares are small and are intended for
just a number, you will have to keep a
separate record of what each number
signiﬁes.
The reduction of the number of boxes
(dom. the page) in line 100 together with
the addition of a PRINT (or even another
FOR.. .NEXT loop printing two vertical
lines) at line 135, would lengthen the
boxes and enable more to be written
with them. Anyway the program works as
is...experiment with it to suit your needs.

RELIABLE
ROUTINES
Mike Hart rectiﬁes some of
the faults of Commodore
Bask with handy REPEAT and
DO loops.
IT IS WELL-KNOWN BY NOW THAT THE
version of BASIC contained in the C64 and
the VIC is tired to put it politely, deriving
from the version of BASIC found in the
PETS. The most obvious ommisions are
the absence o f  control loops such as
DO.. .WHILE or REPEAT...UNTIL which
are found in more recent (and better
structured) BASICS such as version 7.0 in
the C128.
However it is possible to simulate both
of these structures by using CBM BASIC in
particular ways. I shall present here two
ways of adding REPEAT., .UNTIL loops,
the ﬁrst being in BASIC itself whilst the
second is a machine-code routine.
REPEAT. .UNTIL in BASIC
To implement REPEAT. .UNTIL in BASIC
we can utilise FOR.. .NEXT loops as our
basic building block. In the traditional
FOR...NEXT loop we are using the loop
counter to specify the number of times
that w e  wish t o  have an operation
performed. The trick is  to make the
FOR...NEXT loop an endless loop (i.e.
repeat itself) whilst a condition is untrue
i.e. logically false but have the loop end
when the condition under test is true. So
there are two processes involved here —
let us consider both in turn.
Firstly, how do we make the loop
endlessly repeat itself? The answer lies in
knowing how the loop operates in the
ﬁrst place. T he loop w ill always b e
performed at least once. When NEXT is
encountered the step increment will be
added to the loop variable. The new loop
value is now checked against the speciﬁed
upper limit and if it is less (or with a
negative step greater) then the loop is
reactivated. If we specify a STEP size of 0
then usually the upper limit will never be
exceeded a n d  t h e  lo o p  w ill repeat
58 indeﬁnitely . To check this out the reader
can see that the following loop will never
end until the RUN-STOP key is pressed:
FOR J = TO 2 STEP 0 : NEXT 1
The next stage in the process is to use
logical operators to determine the truth
of an expression. If an expression is 'false'
then a value of 0 will be produced. So in
the expression:
A = 10 : B = (A = 9): PRINT B
B will always take a value of 0_ If we were
to change the expression so that B = (A =
10) we now ﬁnd that B is true and has a
value of -1. To make our REPEAT.. .UNTIL
loop all we have to do is make an endless
loop which repeats indeﬁnitely when the
conditionn is false i.e. 0 but which ends
when the condition is true i.e. -1.
We achieve this in the following way. I
am assuming that we wish to double and
print out a number until such time as the
number exceeds 1000.
10 A = 1
20 FOR =  0 TO -1 STEP 0
30 A = 2 * A : PRINT A
40 1 = (A >1000) : NEXT 1
Whilst A is less than 1000 then 1 will be
false i.e. 0_ When incremented by a STEP
of 0 it remains O. This is greater than-land
so the loop continues. When A = 1024, it is
'true' that A > 1000 and so 1 is made to -1.
This is incremented still by 0 but -1 is not
greater than the end-limit and so the loop
ends.

Program Listing

This an example of a REPEAT.. .UNTIL
loop but a DO.. .WHILE loop will test the
condition before processing and skip the
further processing if this proves not to be
necessary. T o turn the above into a
DO...WHILE loop then make line 10 A =
1001 and add a new line:
25 IF A> 1000 THEN J - 1  : GOTO 40
As you can see, the processing section of
the loop is  completely missed out if
initially A is set to a value greater than the
upper limit.
REPEAT...UNTIL i n  machine
code
Also given is  an implementation o f
REPEAT.. .UNTIL in machine-code in a
form which works on both the VIC and
the C-64. By altering CHRGET to look for
the &  character, the routine identiﬁes
when a R (for REPEAT) or a U (for UNTIL)
are required. Just a few points need to be
made about this implementation. Firstly,
it is now the programmer's responsibility
to make sure that the looping variable is
correctly initialised -  see lin e  160.
Secondly, notice that nested REPEAT-
UNTIL are possible - in fact a secondary
stack is created to allow for nesting up to
12 deep.
Re location
To minimise relocation difﬁculties, the
routine is split into two halves, the ﬁrst
half o f  which occupies S02A7-$02CC
where it should be safe! The second half
of the routine can go anywhere that is
protected although I have put it in the
cassette buffer. The second half of the
routine makes calls into the ﬁrst half of the
routine both to initialise and reset the
CHRGET routine (which looks for and
processes BASIC characters one at a time)
and also builds up a stack of line addresses
and pointers. This is to ensure that whena
&U is met the interpreter 'knows' where
to return to and keeps the line numbers
correct. Locations 680 and 681 should
contain the low and high bytes of thestart
location o f  the main routine. I f  C M
owners wished to put the main routine
into SC000 then they could make S in line
14 equal to 49152 and lines 20-21 would
ensure that the correct low and high bytes
were poked into position.
Finally, for VIC owners a list of changes
is given to enable them to run the routine
on their own machines. It has been tested
Out on both!

Norman Doyle clocks on to
Seiko's RC-1000 wrist
terminal.
THE SEIKO RC-1000, RETAILING A T
around i l l %  comes complete w it h
application software on disk or cassette
and a clip on connector which ﬁts neatly
onto two of the pins on the edge of the
user port. It measures 41.8 x 10.6 mm,
weighs 60 grams and has room for twelve
characters on each of the two rows on its
LCD display. Internal memory consists of
SK ROM and 2K RAM,
This n e w  dev ic e converts t h e
usual wrist-borne technology int o a
state-of-the-art device which transcends
the mere timepiece of the past and hints
at what the future has in store for the busy
jet-setting executive. It is not merely able
to display the time and date but also has a
daily alarm function and can remind you
of birthdays, anniversaries and special
appointments. It can display the current
time in named cities, towns or villages
worldwide, corrected according to time-
zone, act as a memory aid, a daily routine
reminder, and store telephone numbers.
The applications are limited only by its 2K
RAM memory.
What's all this got to do with Your
Commodore? Well, all this information
has to be fed into the watch and what
better way than via the pseudo RS 232 user
port on the back of the Commodore 64?
The 64 software supplied with the
database watch is  written i n  BASIC
allowing t h e  knowledgeable user t o
modify the routines But if anyone can
come u p  w ith a  mor e user-friendly
version I'm sure it would make the watch
a more attractive proposition -  more of
that later.
Using t h e  program, data c an b e
entered under one of four categories:
weekly alarm, schedule alarm, world time
and memo. Time details for the alarm
occupy the lower twelve character line of
the 24-character display leaving t he
upper line for text to remind you of the
purpose f o r  t he alarm, such as SEE
DENTIST or NORMANS BRTHDY. They
can be set to remind you of appointments
either on a daily routine basis or for any
speciﬁc time on a future date.
World times may be selected from any
of the 158 cities stored by the program,
but new data can be added if the place
you require does not appear on the list,
either b y  permanently changing t he
DATA statements in the program or by a
temporary software-controlled addition.
The most ﬂexible function of the unit
is the memo facility. These entries may be
further sub-divided into categories which
suit your personal needs. Each entry can
cover the two lines of the display or even
overﬂow Onto more lines if necessary.

This means that telephone numbers can
be stored with a name label to remind you
whose number it is, or even crib notes for
an exam, though only very brief notes
could be made to avoid arousing the
invigilator's suspicions by constant key
pressing!
The length of each main data category
is selected by the user, so the database
could consist solely of memos or schedule
alarms. The only limit on its use is that a
maximum of 80 entries of 24 characters
each can be entered into the memory.
I was bitterly disappointed with the
quality of the software. Consider for a
moment the main market for this kind of
equipment, t he busy executive. The
chancesare that the programming of the
watch would be delegated to a personal
assistant o r  secretary, whose lif e  is
probably complicated enough without
having to grapple with the complexities of
the software provided. User-friendly
implies that the user can simply load and
run the program. I tried this with the Seiko
package and failed miserably, despite the
two help screens and menus.
I also had to study the manual carefully to
understand the program fully. Data entry
was laborious and I was disappointed by
the length of time it took to save the data
to disc: I shudder to think how long it
would take to save to tape.
Another drawback of the system is the
fact t h a t  reprogramming requires
hooking u p  t o  a  computer s o t he
executive w ill s till have t o  carry a
notebook to write down appointments
which can later be entered into the
watch's memory. A case of hi-tech for hi-
tech's sake.
Casio have also produced a similar
watch into which data can be stored
simply by writing with your ﬁnger on the
sensitised display cover. Now, if someone
could ﬁnd a way to store that data into a
computer database that would be a force
to be reckoned with.

How often have you wished
that your 64 could help you
to sort out your address
book. Well now it can with
this program from L.A. Wolfe.
'SYSTEM 64' IS A COMPLETE ADDRESS
handling program for the Commodore 64
computer. It allows you to store addresses
as records in a ﬁle as well as listing the ﬁle
to the screen, deleting records, printing
records and recalling them from tape
when required.
The program has been written t o
accomodate 250 names in each ﬁle, each
which contain 6 ﬁelds or address lines and
each lin e  is  capable o f  holding 30
characters.
The program is menu driven and the
menu can be accessed at any time by
using the left arrow key which has been
assigned as the escape key.
The Ad d  records section searches
through the ﬁle for the ﬁrst empty record
and then offers the 6 ﬁelds to be ﬁlled_ As
with the rest of the program this section
uses a  Mac hine c o d e  r outine t o
compensate for the rather clumsy INPUT
command offered by BASIC V2. The keys
valid during the routine are held in the
variable KEYS and all other keys including
RUN STOP are ignored. Any ﬁelds not
required may be left empty simply by
pressing RETURN.
The Delete records section requests
the number of the record that is to be
removed from the ﬁle and on a valid
response w ill display t h e  ﬁrst lin e
(theoretically t h e  addressee) o f  that
record before asking for conﬁrmation of
deletion. On escaping from this routine
the ﬁle is collapsed t o ﬁll any holes
created when deleting records. T he
reason for this is to compact the ﬁle so that
time is saved during saving and loading
operations; as only full records are stored
to tape. This 'Shufﬂe routine' is the only
SYSTEM
other part of the program which could be
better if  written WI Machine code as,
depending on the amount of records
deleted, it can take 45 seconds or more to
execute, although it does save minutes in
the parts of the program forementioned.
The List ﬁle section will display the ﬁrst
line of each record (20 records at a time)
on the screen, any empty records are
shown as asterix.
The Print records part of the program
requests the numbers of the ﬁrst and last
records to be printed and allows you to
reference the screen listing of the ﬁle; if
the last parameter overlaps into empty
records these will be ignored. The screen
will then display a diagram to illustrate
how the printer should be set up. Should
you have trouble with paper feed or
cartridge adjustment during printing, a
pause feature is included which then
gives t h e  option o f  continuing o r
abandoning the print.
Tractored labels are cheap if you buy
in fairly large amounts, although you can
always use ordinary printed paper and cut
it into labels as required.
As a ﬁnal note on the print routine, it
has been written for the Commodore
MPS 801 although it should run on other
printers with little or no alteration.
The Save ﬁle and Load ﬁle sections are
fairly  s tr aightfor w ar d, I  w o u l d
recommend that ﬁles are saved on to a
separate tape from that containing the
program and that back-up copies are
saved regularly. As an assurance, I have
included a status check after saving any
ﬁle and if  this produces an error, the
program w ill return t o  the Save ﬁle
screen,
Text is positioned on the screen by
using the TAB statement and a string
variable CDS which holds 24 cursor down
characters compensating for the missing
PRINT AT command and avoiding the use
of cumbersome cursor control characters
in PRINT statements. The same applies to
the text colour which wherever possible is
assigned to the variable TX although in
some places using the colour control
characters has  pr ov ed easier than
continually opening and closing PRINT
statements.
The variable FS in line 70 which holds
the ﬁle size may be increased without
altering any other part of the program,
however t h e  following s hould b e
considered w h e n  us ing t h e  D I M
5 Bytes are used for the array name.
2 Bytes are used for each dimension.

Phil South closes his music 1111
series with a few bells &
whistles.
The Last Chorus
WELL HERE WE ARE. THE LAST EPISODE
of this scintillating survey of simpliﬁed
synthesis on the sixty-four! We've been
through almost everything, all that
remains is to tie up some loose ends and
go out with a bang! (Cut the verbosity and
get on with it, South! - - Ed.) Ok! Okl, by
the way, sorry if this all seems a little
muddled; tr y ing t o  ex plain about
computer music in a four part series is like
wrestling with a hot-buttered octopus.
Is it real, or is it...synthesised?
Last month we promised you some tips on
Imitative Synthesis. Well, unfortunately
we ran out of space, so to begin this last
sortie into music and synthesis, here is the
info:
Imitative synthesis is the art (or in some
cases science) of imitating natural sounds
or conventional instruments. This is a
controversial topic, as synths can imitate
ANY ins tr ument, w i t h  intelligent
programming, and you try telling that to
the Musicians Union; they'd smash your
face in !  Synthesisers, and Computer
keyboards generally, are seen to be doing
for the number of working musicians
what the advent of computers did to the
number o f  w or k ing accountants.
Personally I don't think musicians have
anything t o  worry about; NOTHING
sounds as good as a  real instrument
played well by a real person. But I digress,
Here, for your use, are some hints and
tips on how to imitate all your favourite
instruments.
PIANO: The most difﬁcult sound to
imitate, mainly because of the complexity
of the instrument; all that vibrating wood
and metal! Still, try a pulse wave with an
attack/decay o f  d b o u t  9 ,  a n d
sustain/release of O. POKE the lo-byte
pulse w i d t h  addr es s  w i t h  2 5 5 .
THE WELL-TEMPERED 64
Alternatively, use a triangle wave with fast
attack, slow decay, no sustain, and a little
release.
HARPSICHORD: N ic e  o n e  this !
Almost the same as piano, but slightly less
decay and release, to give it that sharp,
plucky sound. Use a sawtooth wave, too!
VIOLIN: Octave range between 4 and 6.
Sawtooth wave with slow attack, slow
decay and lots of sustain. Lots of glide and
vibrato effects, too!
SAX: Tricky! Tenor is in the octave
range 2 to 4. Alto in the range 3 to 5. Try a
pulse wave and trim the width to taste.
Medium to fast attack, medium decay,
lots of sustain and medium release. Use
glide to slide UP to the notes.
XYLOPHONE: Triangle wave, with a
fast attack and slow decay/release. No
sustain. Octave 4 to 7.
TRUMPET: Fast attack and no decay.
Sawtooth wave in the octave 4to 6. Trilling
and vibrato goes well here.
SNARE DRUM: Nois e wave. Fast
attack, medium decay. Use drum rolls.
BASS DRUM: Pulse wave on a very low
octave. Same ADSR as Snare.
So there you have it; just a random
sampling to give you a head start. If these
sounds don't seem quite right to you,
then ﬁddle with them. No, hold on there,
I don't mean get yer bow out, I mean the
start tinkering or feeling out the sound.
The only way you can really learn to do
this is if you can get immediate feedback
as you alter the sound. You need a good
synth package. This brings me neatly
round t o  t a lk  about t h e  amazing
MusiCalc.
The Business
There is no two ways about it. I've seen
pretty much every synth package for the
64 that there is, but this beats them ALL!
Hands down, No messing about.
MusiCalc is  a  system, not just a
program, but a suite of programs. They
are being constantly updated a n d
enhanced by the US writers_ Waveform,
and their UK distributor. (01-241-244B)
The basic system is the MusiCalci disk.
This is the original program, and contains
the synthesiser and sequencer parts of the
system. The program presents you with
control panel, much the same as you
would ﬁnd on a real Isynth (What am I
saying, this is a real synth!), unlike such a
lot of other synth programs, which use
two o r  thr ee separate screens and
confusing abbreviations f o r  different
functions, Mus iCalc  crams a l l  t h e
information onto one screen by tasteful
use of graphics (see screen shots): the
little dashes under the letters tspn and gsrt
are switches, and the black lines are
faders. The grid is your sequencer display,
showing a measure of sixteen beats, in
ﬁfteen rows.
The top row of faders control the
ADSR, or attack, decay, sustain, release,
for the 3 oscillators, and are colour coded
to the cursors on the sequencer grid. The
next row down control the pulse width.
The row below that holds the faders for
the ﬁlter and modulation. Finally, the bot-
tom row displays the coarse, medium and
ﬁne tempo controls, giving the user a very
wide range of tempos to select from.
The score, the manner in which notes
are input into the sequencer, is a little
strange to use at ﬁrst, but you soon get
used to it. It is actually quite logical, and
the tutorial program soon has you tapping
away with gay abandon. The lay of the
land, with respect to scoring each voice, is
competantly illustrated by  the sample
tunes, which when you ﬁrst boot up the
disk are automatically loaded into the
preset SOUND and SCORE locations.
MusiCaIc 2 :  "Scorewriter" is  t h e
second disc in the system. On it are three
programs whic h extend t h e  already
formidable facilities of the system: the
Scorewriter program itself, List Maker and
E. Sequencer.
Scorewriter takes your SCORE ﬁles
created by MusiCalc 1, and turns them
into music, sheet music that can be read
by any competant musician. This is great,
because if you, like me have no idea
about "sticks and blobs" notation, then
this means thet you really don't have to;
the program doPs it all for you. List Maker
and E.Sequencei f or m a  major im-
provement in the way MusiCalc plays
back it's SCORES, by allowing you to
chain them together to make long arid
complicated tunes, otherwise impossible
in the 15x16 matrix.

MusiCalc 3: Keyboard Maker extends
the possibility still further, by letting you
set up, or load from a library of eighty,
keyboard scales, to utilise non-European
scales and intonations. The choice is very
varied, f r o m  Japanese, Indonesian,
Balinese, Baroque and Indian.
MusiCalc's r a n g e  o f  c r eativ e
possibilities is further extended by the use
of musical "templates"„ loaded into the
program to replace the 32 sounds and
scores w it h  3 2  different ones. T he
African/Latin template is certainly very
impressive, as is the Rock/New Wave
template.
The MusiCalc system is the current
best on the market, and as a MusiCalc
representative said to me, "at the price, it
should be!" What is the price? A cool E45
for MusiCalc 1, f30 each for 2 and 3, and
i15 for each of the music templates! But
even THAT doesn't put me off. It's worth
every penny; n o 64 owner should be
without it!
I thought MIDI was a kind of
skirt
The fac t that t h e  extensive ( I  said
extensive n o t  expensive!) MusiCalc
system can utilise MIDI brings me to the
next subject, and one very much the rage
at t h e  moment. MI D I ,  o r  Musical
Instrument Digital Interface, allows any
synth with MIDI to be linked and used
with any other make or synth carrying the
system. The upshot of this is that you can
for instance, use a MIDI guitar synth to
drive a drumbox or a keyboard to drive a
guitar etc. Confusing.
If you want to know all about MIDI
and a good deal more besides then I must
refer you to Mark Jenkins' excellent book,
"Electronic Music on the Commodore
64" published by Sunshine Books. In it he
covers all aspects of computer music, with
special reference to the 64. He also gives a
list of all the relevant MIDI codes.
Speaking to the machine
Machine code isn't a hard thing to learn,
and it can be invaluable to the music
programmer. Especially if you want to
write music for a computer game. One
thing you learn about when you learn
machine code is the signiﬁcance of 16 bit
numbers.
A Commodore 64 can only deal with 8
bits at a time. Due to those bits being in
binary the highest 8 bit number you can
get is 255. So when you have to input a
number like 440, the frequency of the
note A above middle C, you're up the
creek. So you have to split the number
into two 8 bit ones, the most signiﬁcant, or
hi-byte, and the least signiﬁcant, or lo-
byte. That, my dear friend is the reason for
all those annoying numbers for pitch
values, h i g h  fr equenc y  a n d  l o w
frequency. You remember Frekk? (You
don't? Shame on you! Buy a back issue,
immediately!) Well, that's what it was
doing.
Another thing you'd learn by checking
out memory maps of the SID chip (there's
a really good one in Ian Waugh's book,
mentioned later) is the purposes to which
you can put oscillator 3. At address 54299
(5+27) you can read the output of Osc 3.
You c a n  us e t h is  infor mation t o
"modulate" either of the other voices.
The digital (numbers) output from this
Oscillator could be made to make the
note wobble or trill, using the ﬁgures
output from this source to increment the
pitch or ﬁlter. (Think of it as a bit of
homework, Jones Minor.) POKEing
address 54296 with 128 turns the output of
Osc. 3 off, Sc) you just hear the effect. Try it
out.
Interface the music
One o f  the most joyous things your
average 64 owner discovers sooner or
later is how very easy the 64 is to interface
with t h e  outs ide w or ld. V i a  t h e
video/audio socket in the back of your 64,
you can link it to your hi-ﬁ for example.
Pin 3 does the job. That is the one on the
right of the ﬁve holes in your 5-pin DIN
socket. In this manner, you could record
the musical output from your compueter,
OR you could put it through a musical
effects pedal, like a chorus o r
.  ﬂanger. This
will give the sound more body, and
generally fatten it up for recording. (Or
indeed just listening to!)
The well tempered bookshelf
The only way to get swotted up on what to
do in all the things I've mentioned is to get
a good book on the one you're most
interested in. Due to considerations of
space I haven't been able to go into the
topic in any mega-depth, but there are
books around which can do this. So, now I
present the Hippo Good Music Book
Guide:
Ian Waugh "Commodore 64 Music"
(Sunshine Books) — This is a book about
the 64's musical capacity in great depth
and readability. M r  Waugh treats the
subject with clarity and covers all aspects
of making music with your computer. The
memory maps o f  the SID c hip ar e
particularly us eful t o  t h e  aspiring
programmer, as  ar e t h e  exhaustive
explanations as to what does what. An
essential read for those wishing to learn
how to use the 64's musical talent.
Mark Jenkins "Electronic Music on the
Commodore 64' (Sunshine Books) —
Where Ian Waugh leaves off, Mark
Jenkins takes up, and covers the rocky
ground thereafter. Interfacing and
detailed MIDID info is here, as well as
comprehensive lists of all the best music
software and hardware available, along
with manufacturers addresses and phone
numbers. Mr Jenkins obviously hasa lot of
technical ability, and h e shares it  all
with the reader in very clear language,
highlighting many drawbacks, hints and
tips which one can only ever normally
gain with experience. A very informative
and stimulating book, and well worth the
seven quid.
George Martin "Making Music" (Pan
Books) — The producer of the Beatles
edits articles by  everyone who's ever
done anything in music on their specialist
topic; Bernard Krause o n  electronic
music, Hans Zimmer o n synthesisers,
Herbie Hancock on playing synthesisers
and Warren Cann on computer music,
plus many, many more. As far as I'm
concerned, this is the set text as far as
recording and the technical aspects of
music are concerned. It's also a ﬂippin'
good read!
Danny Davis "Machine Language for
the Absolute Beginner" (Melbourne
House) —  Logic ally  w r it t e n  a n d
illuminating. I found, as a person with an
incomplete knowledge of machine code,
(I learn only what I need to, to solve a
particular problem) that it ﬁlled in the
necessary gaps in my  knowledge, and
now provides a  welcome source o f
reference, for those times when my brain
throws the baby out with the bath water.
Lothar Englisch " T h e  Mac hine
Language Book of the Commodore 64"
(Abacus/Adamsoft) —  translated from
German, I think, because the English is a
little stiff. Nevertheless a book packed
with content. O k , s o the cover and
typesetting wouldn't win any prizes, but
then we aren't here to judge design. Not
so good as a reference book, and more for
the serious student, perhaps.
CODA
So, that, my ﬁne lads and lasses, is all you
need to know to make music with your
computer. Simple innit? I hope you've
enjoyed this series, I f  you have any
queries about the series (that rhymes!)
then please do not hesitate to write to
me, Phil South, c /o Your Commodore.

With Pact International Ltd's
Panda cassette interface, it is
now possible to use a normal
domestic cassette recorder
with the 64 or VIC 20. Does
this mean death to the
dataseftel Mike Roberts
passes judgement.
I.
EVERYBODY EVEN SLIGHTLY INVOLVED
with Commodore computers knows
about t h e  famous  ( o r  infamous )
Commodore tape system.
Back in the old days, the commodore
PET (at around f  700) was the ultimate in
home computers. It had a built-in screen
and a built-in tape deck. At that stage
nobody was arguing about the tape
system because interfacing normal tape
recorders was a pretty hit or miss affair.
Later, PETs came with an external tape
deck because the space on the front panel
was needed to ﬁt in a real keyboard. Some
grumbles were heard from the computer
fraternity at this stage, but nobody raised
any serious objections due to maintaining
compatability with earlier models.
Then c a m e  t h e  V I C  a n d  t h e
Commodore 64. Commodore wer e
univ ers ally  s la m m e d  f o r  t h e i r
unwillingness to provide a 'normal' tape
system using a domestic tape recorder.
But there are some good reasons for
having a dedicated unit. If unturboed, it is
the most reliable and user friendly (who
will ever forget 'PRESS PLAY ON TAPE 1 '
system ev er  devised. I t  compares
favourably with other dedicated tape
systems. A t a r i i s  unr eliable a n d
unfriendly, so is the Amstrad system -
which isn't really a dedicated system at all
but jus t a  standard Amstrad device
plugged in for marketings sake.
The big problem is price, whereas
most people have a cassette recorder
nowadays, most don't have the £45
IR necessary to buy a C2N or 1531.
Looking at the output of the tape
connector it doesn't seem too difﬁcult to
plug in a normal cassette as long as you
connect it correctly, Alas, this is not so.
Speech, music, and normal computer
tape interfaces have their sound waves
composed of sine waves or the like - great
for music and speech, but not so good for
transmitting c omputer information,
which is, after all, a series of ons and offs
and not analogue at all.
The Commodore tape interface uses a
series of square waves to transmit its
information (much mor e sensible for
computer data); this results in a square

wave. Domestic cassette recorders hate
square waves, some even have circuitry to
turn them into sine waves, not what we
want at all.
Cassette interlace
This brings us to the problem again of a
cheap system for  Commodore users.
What we want is a cheap black box that
plugs into the 64 or VIC and lets you use a
domestic cassette recorder.
The 'Panda' cassette interface claims to
solve the problem. Pack in utilitarian
bubble packaging it is neither cheap or
black, but the 'blurb' does say that it will
load all tapes 'including turbos'. Turbos
are another problem for Commodore
users as some normal Commodore tape
decks will not even accept them, the
frequencies are just too high.
The Panda interface is equipped with a
special switch which is designed to alter
the signal level and increase reliability.
There are also two lights on top which
indicate whether a LOAD or a SAVE is in
operation. On opposite sides of the main
box is the edge connector and the three
wires that go to your standard tape deck.
Unfortunately, I  c annot giv e a
favourable report for this unit as it does
not function as is claimed, It will load
normal 64 tapes, and it is slightly more
reliable with tapes that have been written
by it than with tapes written by a normal
Commodore tape system. With Turbos
though it was another story altogether. I
tried s ix  different tape decks, t w o
interfaces and two Commodore 64s as
well as one CBM 3032. The only turbo that
would load is Novaload, which says more
for the reliability of the Turbo than for the
interface because Novaload is notoriously
reliable, and w i l l  load in t o  almost
everything.
My verdict is that at f 19.95 this device is
far to expensive a gamble to take. You
have to gamble that your tape deck will
work with it, your computer will work
with it, and that every piece of software
that you ever buy with it will work -
which is very unlikely, and remember
most shops will refuse to swap software if
it will work on their system. Surely E45 for
a datasette isn't too much for piece of
mind?

collecting as many of the ﬂags as possible.
Be extremely careful however, as the
slightest knock will relieve you of one of
your ﬁve lives.
Your craft can be controlled by either
joystick of keyboard. K rotates you right, I
rotates left and the space bar starts your
craft.
Entering the Program
Death Maze must be typed into your VIC
20 in three parts; this is due to the large
amount of machine code and character
data.
Four simple steps must be followed in
entering the program these areas follows:
1 Enter Program 1 and save on tape
2 Enter the machine code loader and
save on a separate tape
3 Using the loader program type in the
hex values exactly as printed. Each line
starts with a two digit number and ends
with a checksurn. Lines can be input in
any order. If an error is made, the line
will be displayed and can then be
corrected us ing t h e  cursor a n d
INST/DEL keys.
Data can be saved to tape at any time
by entering the word SAVE to the NEXT
LINE prompt.
If you are only saving part of the data it
is probably better to save it onto a
spare tape. Remember to LOAD it back
into the machine by typing LOAD
when presented with the NEXT LINE
prompt.
It is possible that if you have made any
corrections to the data that line 00 will
have been corrupted it is therefore advis-
able that you type this line in last.
When all of the data has been typed in
SAVE i t  onto the tape straight after
Program one using the SAVE option as
before.
4 Enter the main program and save after
the machine code and program one.

lAllen Webb produces some
more routines to add a little
'spice to your programs.
IN THE LAST PART OF THIS SERIES,
described how you could get interesting
effects b y  manipulating redeﬁned
characters. This month, I want to cover
some ways of producing some effects
using ﬁlls and ﬂashes. These effects are of
value when you want to move from on
display to another in an interesting way.
Most of you will have seen the screen
effects used by some of the fast load
programs available. The effect is to ﬁll the
screen, b o r d e r  o r  b o t h  w i t h
multicoloured stripes. 8y changing the
delays, the width of the stripes can be
altered. Loader 1 gives a simple routine
which will give such an effect. Demo 1
shows what it can do. You can vary a
number of parameters. Location 831 holds
the delay parameter. This decides the
width of the lines. (A value of -
lines of about half a millimetre in width).
You can specify the duration of the effect
by putting the number o f  loops in
location 829 and 830 (high byte in 830).
Finally, location 832 holds a ﬂag. A value
of 1 limits the effect to the border, 2
ﬂashes the screen and any other value
ﬂashes both.
In arcade type games, greater i
is created if you can use an interesting
method of changing from one screen to
the next. This can be as complex as you
like, but one thing they do show is that the
programmer has taken time to deal with
the minor details. Loader 2 gives a trivial
ﬁll routine. This routine simply ﬁlls the
screen with a  speciﬁed character (in
location 834) o f  a speciﬁed colour (in
location 833). You can vary the speed from
very slow to instantaneous by changing
location 831.
A more interesting variant is given by
loader 3. This is  a  random ﬁll. The
parameters available ar e character
(location 902), number of loops (location
920), colour ﬂag (location 921, 0 gives
multicolour, 1 uses colour in location
922). T he number o f  loops c an b e
changed to give a part ﬁll. A value of 44
will completely ﬁll the screen, a lower
value will not. A value above 44 will simply
give a pretty effect. This sort of effect is
used in impossible Mission to signify that
you have failed the complete the game.
Using certain characters in this way can
give some intriguing effects.
Loader 4 gives a move useful ﬁll. This
routine slowly ﬁlls an area of screen from
top to bottom. To give smooth motion,
the standard Commodore characters are

used to ﬁll in two pixels at a time. The
effect is similar to a shutter slowly sliding
down over a window. Got the idea? As
usual, I 'v e prov ided a  number  o f
tweakable parameters. The start line, top
line is 1, is poked into 907. The end line
plus 1 is  poked into 908. Two delay
parameters are put into 909 and 910. The
value in 909 is a coarse tweak and 910 a
ﬁne adjustment. The colour of the ﬁll goes
into 906. Again, this sort of effect is used in
Impossible Mission.
All of these routines occupy the spare
area bet w een t h e  R O M s  s o  n o
precautions are necessary to protect them
from corruption. They occupy different
ideas s o that they can cohabit, The
routines use common areas of zero page
memory, but no conﬂict should occur.
Clearly the range of effects available is
huge, but when it comes down to it, they
are based on similar concepts to those
above. I've deliberately limited myself to
simple routines for two reasons. First they
are short meaning that they take up less
RAM and they're easier for you to type in.
Secondly, by allowing you to specify the
operating parameters, complex effects
are never-the-less possible.
Next month I will be applying myself
to the problem of raster interrupts. Using
my routine, y ou will have complete
control over ﬁfty zones on the screen
allowing complex graphical effects.

about advertisements.
But which ones?
Every week millions of advertisements appear in print, on posters or in the cinema.
Most of them comply with the rules contained in the British Code of Advertising
Practice.
But some of them break the rules and warrant your complaints.
If you're not sure about which ones they are, however, drop us a line and we'll
send you an abridged copy of the Advertising Code. Then, if an advertisement
bothers you, you'll be justiﬁed in bothering us.

Choosing the right computer
is a good start b u t  can you
ﬁnd the right software?
At SUPERSOFT we're very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders.
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
— making ends meet! Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better.
For home, club or small business use
BUSICALC 1 should pay for itself in no time at
all; for larger companies we recommend
BUSICALC 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 64 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it all works. Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
To use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTER is the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wish.
INTERDICTOR PILOT is a  space ﬂight
simulator. Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because—
to be frank — it's a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the real thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century: space travel is commonplace, and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought. A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!

Other SUPERSOFT products include the
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, the only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pcwo
ertul enough for the professional (most r
our competitors use it!). The VICTREE can
ridge adds dozens of commands to Bask:.
including toolkit aids and disk commands; or
on disk there's MASTER 64, a really corn-
prehensive package for  the keen prog-
rammer.
Of course, we do also publish games
programs, and with classics like STIX. QUINX
and KAMIKAZE in our range we are one of
the market leaders. But we most enjoy
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be in use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer—
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket. But
most specialist shops stock titles from our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order). However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by calling at our
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
ACCESS card.
