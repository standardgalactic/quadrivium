CHAPTER 1
Geometric Measure Theory
Geometric measure theory could be described as differential geometry,
generalized through measure theory to deal with maps and surfaces that are not
necessarily smooth, and applied to the calculus of variations. It dates from the
1960 foundational paper of Herbert Federer and Wendell Fleming on “Normal
and Integral Currents,” recognized by the 1986 AMS Steele Prize for a paper
of fundamental or lasting importance, and earlier and contemporaneous work
of L. C. Young [1, 2], E. De Giorgi [1, 3], and E. R. Reifenberg [1–3] (see
Figure 1.0.1). This chapter will give a rough outline of the purpose and basic
concepts of geometric measure theory. Later chapters will take up these topics
more carefully.
1.1. Archetypical Problem.
Given a boundary in Rn, ﬁnd the surface of
least area with that boundary. See Figure 1.1.1. Progress on this problem
depends crucially on ﬁrst ﬁnding a good space of surfaces to work in.
1.2. Surfaces as Mappings.
Classically, one considered only two-dimensio-
nal surfaces, deﬁned as mappings of the disc. See Figure 1.2.1. Excellent
references include J. C. C. Nitsche’s Lectures on Minimal Surfaces [2], now
available in English, R. Osserman’s updated Survey of Minimal Surfaces, and
H. B. Lawson’s Lectures on Minimal Submanifolds. It was not until about
1930 that J. Douglas and T. Rado surmounted substantial inherent difﬁculties
to prove that every smooth Jordan curve bounds a disc of least mapping
area. Almost no progress was made for higher-dimensional surfaces (until
in a surprising turnaround B. White [1] showed that for higher-dimensional

surfaces the geometric measure theory solution actually solves the mapping
problem too).
Along with its successes and advantages, the deﬁnition of a surface as a
mapping has certain drawbacks (see Morgan [24]):
(1) There is an inevitable a priori restriction on the types of singularities that
can occur;
(2) There is an a priori restriction on the topological complexity; and
(3) The natural topology lacks compactness properties.
The importance of compactness properties appears in the direct method descri-
bed in the next section.
1.3. The Direct Method.
The direct method for ﬁnding a surface of least
area with a given boundary has three steps.
(1) Take a sequence of surfaces with areas decreasing to the inﬁmum.
(2) Extract a convergent subsequence.
(3) Show that the limit surface is the desired surface of least area.
Figures 1.3.1–1.3.4 show how this method breaks down for lack of compact-
ness in the space of surfaces as mappings, even when the given boundary is
the unit circle. By sending out thin tentacles toward every rational point, the
sequence could include all of R3 in its closure!
1.4. Rectiﬁable Currents.
An alternative to surfaces as mappings is provi-
ded by rectiﬁable currents, the m-dimensional, oriented surfaces of geometric
measure theory. The relevant functions f: Rm ! Rn need not be smooth, but
merely Lipschitz, i.e.,
jf▷x◁ f▷y◁j  Cjx  yj,
for some “Lipschitz constant” C.

Fortunately there is a good m-dimensional measure on Rn, called Hausdorff
measure, H m. Hausdorff measure agrees with the classical mapping area of
an embedded manifold, but it is deﬁned for all subsets of Rn.
A Borel subset B of Rn is called (H m, m) rectiﬁable if B is a countable union
of Lipschitz images of bounded subsets of Rm, with H m▷B◁< 1. (As usual,
we will ignore sets of H m measure 0.) That deﬁnition sounds rather general,
and it includes just about any “m-dimensional surface” I can imagine. Never-
theless, these sets will support a kind of differential geometry; for example, it
turns out that a rectiﬁable set B has a canonical tangent plane at almost every
point.
Finally, a rectiﬁable current is an oriented rectiﬁable set with integer multi-
plicities, ﬁnite area, and compact support. By general measure theory, one can
integrate a smooth differential form ϕ over such an oriented rectiﬁable set S,
and hence view S as a current, i.e., a linear functional on differential forms,
ϕ 7!

This perspective yields a new natural topology on the space of surfaces, dual
to an appropriate topology on differential forms. This topology has useful
compactness properties, given by the fundamental Compactness Theorem
below. Viewing rectiﬁable sets as currents also provides a boundary operator
∂from m-dimensional rectiﬁable currents to (m  1)-dimensional currents,

Geometric Measure Theory
deﬁned by
▷∂S◁▷ϕ◁D S▷dϕ◁,
where dϕ is the exterior derivative of ϕ. By Stokes’s Theorem, this deﬁnition
coincides with the usual notion of boundary for smooth, compact manifolds
with boundary. In general, the current ∂S is not rectiﬁable, even if S is recti-
ﬁable.
1.5. The Compactness Theorem.
Let c be a positive constant. Then the set
of all m-dimensional rectiﬁable currents T in a ﬁxed large closed ball in Rn,
such that the boundary ∂T is also rectiﬁable and such that the area of both T
and ∂T are bounded by c, is compact in an appropriate weak topology.
1.6. Advantages of Rectiﬁable Currents.
Notice that rectiﬁable currents
have none of the three drawbacks mentioned in Section 1.2. There is certainly
no restriction on singularities or topological complexity. Moreover, the com-
pactness theorem provides the ideal compactness properties. In fact, the direct
method described in Section 1.3 succeeds in the context of rectiﬁable currents.
In the ﬁgures of Section 1.3, the amount of area in the tentacles goes to 0.
Therefore, they disappear in the limit in the new topology. What remains is
the disc, the desired solution.
All of these results hold in all dimensions and codimensions.
1.7. The Regularity of Area-Minimizing Rectiﬁable Currents.
One seri-
ous suspicion hangs over this new space of surfaces: The solutions they provide
to the problem of least area, the so-called area-minimizing rectiﬁable currents,
may be generalized objects without any geometric signiﬁcance. The following
interior regularity results allay such concerns. (We give more precise state-
ments in Chapter 8.)
(1) A two-dimensional area-minimizing rectiﬁable current in R3 is a smooth
embedded manifold.
(2) For m  6, an m-dimensional area-minimizing rectiﬁable current in RmC1
is a smooth embedded manifold.
Thus in low dimensions the area-minimizing hypersurfaces provided by
geometric measure theory actually turn out to be smooth embedded mani-
folds. However, in higher dimensions, singularities occur, for geometric and
not merely technical reasons (see Section 10.7). Despite marked progress,
understanding such singularities remains a tremendous challenge.

CHAPTER 2
Measures
This chapter lays the measure-theoretic foundation, including the deﬁnition
of Hausdorff measure and covering theory. The general reference is Federer [1,
Chapter II].
2.1. Deﬁnitions.
For us a measure  on Rn will be what is sometimes called
an outer measure: a nonnegative function  on all subsets of Rn (with the
value C 1 allowed, of course), which is countably subadditive, i.e., if A is
contained in a countable union, [ Ai, then
▷A◁ ▷Ai◁.
A set A ² Rn
is called measurable
if, for all E ² Rn, ▷E \ A◁C
▷E \ AC◁D ▷E◁. The class of measurable sets is a -algebra, i.e., closed
under complementation, countable union, and countable intersection. If A is a
countable disjoint union of measurable sets Ai, then ▷A◁D ▷Ai◁.
The smallest -algebra containing all open sets is the collection of Borel
sets. A measure  is called Borel regular if Borel sets are measurable and
every subset of Rn is contained in a Borel set of the same measure.
Suppose that  is Borel regular, A is measurable, and ε > 0. If ▷A◁< 1,
then A contains a closed subset C with ▷A  C◁< ε. If A can be covered by
countably many open sets of ﬁnite measure, then A is contained in an open
set W with ▷W  A◁< ε [Federer, 2.2.3].
All Borel sets are measurable if and only if Caratheodory’s criterion holds:
(1) Whenever A1, A2 are sets a positive distance apart, then
▷A1 [ A2◁D ▷A1◁C ▷A2◁.

2.2. Lebesgue Measure.
There is a unique Borel regular, translation invari-
ant measure on Rn such that the measure of the unit cube [0, 1]n is 1. This
measure is called Lebesgue measure, L n.
2.3. Hausdorff Measure [Federer, 2.10].
Unfortunately, for general “m-
dimensional” subsets of Rn (for m < n), it is more difﬁcult to assign an
m-dimensional measure. The m-dimensional area of a C1 map f from a
domain D ² Rm into Rn is classically deﬁned as the integral of the Jacobian
Jmf over D. [Computationally, at each point x 2 D, ▷Jmf◁2 equals the sum of
the squares of the determinants of the m ð m submatrices of Df▷x◁or, equiv-
alently, the determinant of ▷Df▷x◁◁tDf▷x◁.] The area of an m-dimensional
submanifold M of Rn is then deﬁned by calculating it on parameterized
portions of M and proving that the area is independent of choice of parame-
terization.
In 1918, F. Hausdorff introduced an m-dimensional measure in Rn which
gives the same area for submanifolds, but is deﬁned on all subsets of Rn.
When m D n, it turns out to be equal Lebesgue measure.
DEFINITIONS.
For any subset S of Rn, deﬁne the diameter of S
diam▷S◁D supfjx  yj: x, y 2 Sg.
Let ˛m denote the Lebesgue measure of the closed unit ball Bm▷0, 1◁² Rm.
For A ² Rn, we deﬁne the m-dimensional Hausdorff measure H m▷A◁by the
following process. For small υ, cover A efﬁciently by countably many sets
Sj with diam▷Sj◁ υ, add up all the ˛m▷diam▷Sj◁/2◁m, and take the limit as
υ ! 0:
H m▷A◁D lim
υ!0
inf
A²[Sj
diam▷Sj◁υ
˛m
diam▷Sj◁

m
.
The inﬁmum is taken over all countable coverings fSjg of A whose members
have diameter at most υ. As υ decreases, the more restricted inﬁmum cannot
decrease, and hence the limit exists, with 0  H m▷A◁ 1. In Figure 2.3.1,
the two-dimensional area is approximated by r2. The spiral of Figure 2.3.2
illustrates one reason for taking the limit as υ ! 0, since otherwise a spiral
of great length could be covered by a single ball of radius 1.
Countable subadditivity follows immediately from the deﬁnition. The mea-
surability of Borel sets follows easily from Caratheodory’s criterion 2.1(1).
To see that each A ² Rn is contained in a Borel set B of the same measure,
note ﬁrst that each Sj occurring in the deﬁnition of H m▷A◁may be replaced by
its closure, so that [ Sj is Borel. If fS▷k◁
j g is a countable sequence of coverings

The Hausdorff measure (area) of a piece of surface A is approximated
by the cross-sections of little balls which cover it.
Figure 2.3.2.
One must cover by small sets to compute length accurately. Here the
length of the spiral is well estimated by the sum of the diameters of the tiny balls, but
grossly underestimated by the diameter of the huge ball.
deﬁning H m▷A◁, then B D \k [j S▷k◁
j
gives the desired Borel set. Therefore,
H m is Borel regular. Later it will be proved that H m gives the “correct” area
for C1 submanifolds of Rn.
The deﬁnition of Hausdorff measure extends to any nonnegative real
dimension. [The deﬁnition of ˛m is extended by the function: ˛m D
m/2/▷m/2 C 1◁]. Notice that H 0 is counting measure; H 0▷A◁is the number
of elements of A.

10
Geometric Measure Theory
The Hausdorff dimension of a nonempty set A is deﬁned as
inffm ½ 0: H m▷A◁< 1g D inffm: H m▷A◁D 0g
D supfm: H m▷A◁> 0g
D supfm: H m▷A◁D 1g.
The equivalence of these conditions follows from the fact that if m < k
and H m▷A◁< 1, then H k▷A◁D 0 (Exercise 2.4). The Cantor set of Exer-
cise 2.6 turns out to have Hausdorff dimension ln 2/ ln 3. Figure 2.3.3 pictures
a Cantor-like set in R3, called the Sierpinski sponge, which has Hausdorff
dimension of about 2.7.
These Cantor-like sets are self-similar in the sense that certain homothetic
expansions of such a set are locally identical to the original set. Self-similarity
appears in the coastline of Great Britain and in the mass in the universe.
B. Mandelbrot has modeled many natural phenomena by random fractional
dimensional sets and processes, called fractals. His books, Fractals and The
Figure 2.3.3.
The Sierpinski sponge is an example of a fractional dimensional set. Its
Hausdorff dimension is about 2.7. (From Studies in Geometry by Leonard M. Blumen-
thal and Karl Menger. Copyright 1979 by W. H. Freeman and Company. Reprinted

2.4. Integralgeometric Measure.
In 1932, J. Favard deﬁned another m-
dimensional measure on Rn▷m D 0, 1, . . . , n◁, now called integral-geometric
measure, I m. It turns out that I m agrees with H m on all smooth m-dimensio-
nal submanifolds and other nice sets, but disagrees and often is zero on
Cantor-like sets.
Roughly, to deﬁne I m▷A◁, project A onto an m-dimensional subspace of
Rn, take the Lebesgue measure (counting multiplicities), and average over all
such projections.
More precisely, let OŁ▷n, m◁denote the set of orthogonal projections p
of Rn onto m-dimensional subspaces. For general reasons there is a unique
measure on OŁ▷n, m◁invariant under Euclidean motions on Rn, normalized to
have total measure 1. For example, the set OŁ▷2, 1◁of orthogonal projections
onto lines through 0 in the plane may be parameterized by 0  $ < , and
the unique measure is ▷1/◁d$. For y 2 image p ¾D Rm, let the “multiplicity
function,” N▷pjA, y◁, denote the number of points in A \ p1▷y◁. Deﬁne a
normalizing constant,

One checks that the function N▷pjB, y◁is indeed measurable and that I m
is countably subadditive. Finally extend I m to a Borel regular measure by
deﬁning for any set A ² Rn,
I m▷A◁D inffI m▷B◁: A ² B, B Borelg.
2.5. Densities [Federer, 2.9.12, 2.10.19].
Let A be a subset of Rn. For 1 
m  n, a 2 Rn, we deﬁne the m-dimensional density m▷A, a◁of A at a by
the formula
m▷A, a◁D lim

H m▷A \ Bn▷a, r◁◁

where ˛m is the measure of the closed unit ball Bm▷0, 1◁in Rm. For example,

Hence density of measures actually generalizes the notion of density of sets.

Let A ² Rm. A function f:
A ! Rn has approximate limit y at a if for every ε > 0, Rm  fx 2 A: jf▷x◁

that in particular A must have density 1 at a.

PROPOSITION.
A function f: A ! Rn has an approximate limit y at a if and
only if there is a set B ² A such that BC has m-dimensional density 0 at a and
fjB has the limit y at a.
Remark.
In general, the word approximate means “except for a set of
density 0.”
Proof.
The condition is clearly sufﬁcient. To prove necessity, assume that
f has an approximate limit y at a. For convenience we assume y D 0. Then
for any positive integer i,

Geometric Measure Theory
The following covering theorem of Besicovitch proves more powerful in
practice than more familiar ones, such as Vitali’s. It applies to any ﬁnite Borel
measure ϕ.
2.7. Besicovitch Covering Theorem [Federer, 2.8.15; Besicovitch].
Sup-
pose ϕ is a Borel measure on Rn, A ² Rn, ϕ▷A◁< 1, F is a collection of
nontrivial closed balls, and inffr: B▷a, r◁2 Fg D 0 for all a 2 A. Then there is
a ▷countable◁disjoint subcollection of F that covers ϕ almost all of A.
Partial Proof.
We may assume that all balls in F have radius at most 1.
PART 1.
There is a constant .▷n◁such that, given a closed ball, B, of
radius r and a collection, C, of closed balls of a radius of at least r which
intersect B and which do not contain each other’s centers, then the cardinality
of C is at most .▷n◁. This statement is geometrically obvious, and we omit
the proof. E. R. Riefenberg [4] proved that for n D 2, the sharp bound is 18.
(See Figure 2.7.1.)
PART 2.
. C 1 subcollections of disjoint balls cover A. To prove this state-
ment, we will arrange the balls of F in rows of disjoint balls, starting with
Figure 2.7.1.
At most, 18 larger discs can intersect the unit disc in R2 without
containing each other’s centers. Figure courtesy of J. M. Sullivan [2].

the largest and proceeding in order of size. (Of course, there may not always
be a “largest ball,” and actually one chooses a nearly largest ball. This tech-
nical point propagates minor corrections throughout the proof, which we will
ignore.)
Place the largest ball B1 in the ﬁrst row. (See Figure 2.7.2.) Throw away
all balls whose centers are covered by B1.
Take the next largest ball, B2. If B2 is disjoint from B1, place B2 in the ﬁrst
row. If not, place B2 in the second row. Throw away all balls whose centers
are covered by B2.
At the nth step, place Bn in the earliest row that keeps all balls in each row
disjoint. Throw away all balls whose centers are covered by Bn.
Proceed by transﬁnite induction. The whole list certainly covers A, since we
throw away only balls whose centers are already covered. Each row consists
of disjoint balls, by construction. Hence it sufﬁces to show that there are at
most . C 1 nonempty rows. Assume some ball, B, gets put in the . C 2 row.
Then there are balls D1, . . . , D.C1, at least as large as B already in the ﬁrst
. C 1 rows and not disjoint from B. No Dj can contain another’s center, or
the smaller would have been thrown away when the larger was put in. This
contradiction of Part 1 completes the proof of Part 2.
PART 3.
Completion of proof. By Part 2, some disjoint subcollection covers

In the proof of the Besicovitch covering Theorem 2.7, the balls cover-
ing A are arranged by size in rows or discarded. Intersecting balls must go in different
rows. For the case of R2, this requires at most .▷2◁C 1  19 rows. Then some row
must provide a disjoint cover of at least 1/19 the total measure.

Countably many such repetitions ﬁnally yield a countable disjoint subcollec-

We now give three corollaries as examples of the usefulness of Besicovitch’s
covering theorem.
2.8. Corollary.
H n D L n on Rn.
Proof.
We will need the so-called isodiametric inequality or Bieberbach
inequality, which says that among all sets of ﬁxed diameter, the ball has the
largest volume. In other words, for any set S in Rn,
L n▷S◁ ˛n
diam S
2
n
.
It follows immediately that H n ½ L n.
There happens to be an easy proof of the isodiametric inequality. (See also
Burago and Zalgaller, Theorem 11.2.1.) We may assume that S is symmetric
with respect to each coordinate axis, since replacing each intersection of S
with a line parallel to the axis by a symmetric interval of the same one-
dimensional measure does not change the Lebesgue measure and can only
decrease the diameter. But now S is symmetric with respect to the origin and
hence is contained in the ball B of the same diameter. Therefore
L n▷S◁ L n▷B◁D ˛n
diam S

,
as desired. Notice that the symmetrization step is necessary, because an
equilateral triangle, for example, is not contained in a ball of the same
diameter.
To prove that H n  L n, we will use the Besicovitch Covering Theorem.
First, we note that it sufﬁces to prove that H n▷A◁ L n▷A◁for A Borel and
bounded, or hence for A equal to the open R-ball Un▷0, R◁² Rn, or hence

because (1) does not apply to B.
2.9. Corollary.
If A ² Rn is Lebesgue measurable, then the density n▷A, x◁
equals the characteristic function 1A▷x◁almost everywhere.
Proof.
It sufﬁces to show that for every measurable set A, ▷A, x◁D 1 at
almost all points x 2 A. (Considering AC then implies ▷A, x◁D 0 at almost
all x /2 A.) Assume not. We may assume 0 < L n▷A◁< 1. We may further

and then replacing A by fa 2 A: Ł▷A, a◁< υg. Choose an open set U ¦ A

Let F be the collection of all closed balls B centered in A and contained in
U such that

By (1), F contains arbitrarily small balls centered at each point of A. By
the covering theorem, there is a countable disjoint subcollection G covering
almost all of A. Therefore,

CHAPTER 3
Lipschitz Functions and Rectiﬁable Sets
This chapter introduces the m-dimensional surfaces of geometric measure
theory, called rectiﬁable sets. These sets have folds, corners, and more general
singularities. The relevant functions are not smooth functions as in differential
geometry, but Lipschitz functions. See also the survey, “What Is a Surface?”
[Morgan 24].
3.1. Lipschitz Functions.
A function f: Rm ! Rn is Lipschitz if there is a
constant C such that
jf▷x◁ f▷y◁j  Cjx  yj.
The least such constant is called the Lipschitz constant and is denoted by
Lip f. Figure 3.1.1 gives the graphs of two typical Lipschitz functions. Theo-
rems 3.2 and 3.3 show that a Lipschitz function comes very close to being
differentiable.
3.2. Rademacher’s Theorem [Federer, 3.1.6].
A Lipschitz function f:
Rm ! Rn is differentiable almost everywhere.
The Proof has ﬁve steps:
(1) A monotonic function f: R ! R is differentiable almost everywhere.
(2) Every function f: R ! R which is locally of bounded variation (and
hence every Lipschitz function) is differentiable almost everywhere.
(3) A Lipschitz function f: Rm ! Rn has partial derivatives almost every-
where.

Examples of Lipschitz functions.
(4) A Lipschitz function f: Rm ! Rn is approximately differentiable almost
everywhere.
(5) A Lipschitz function f: Rm ! Rn is differentiable almost everywhere.
Step (1) is a standard result of real analysis, proved by differentiation of
measures. Step (2) follows by decomposing a function of bounded variation
as the difference of two monotonic functions. Step (3) follows immediately
from Step (2) (modulo checking measurability). The deduction of (4) from
(3) is technical, but not surprising, because the existence of continuous partial
derivatives implies differentiability and a measurable function is approximately
continuous almost everywhere. If (3) holds everywhere, it does not follow that
(4) holds everywhere.
The ﬁnal conclusion (5) rests on the interesting fact that if a Lipschitz func-
tion is approximately differentiable at a, it is differentiable at a. We conclude
this discussion with a proof of that fact.
Suppose that the Lipschitz function f: Rm ! Rn is approximately differ-
entiable at a but not differentiable at a. We may assume a D 0, f▷0◁D 0 and
ap Df▷0◁D 0.
For some 0 < ε < 1, there is a sequence of points ai ! 0 such that
jf▷ai◁j ½ εjaij.
Let C D maxfLip f, 1g. Then, for x in the closed ball B▷ai, εjaij/3C◁,
jf▷x◁j ½ εjaij  εjaij/3 ½ εjxj/2.
Thus, for x 2 E D [1
iD1B▷ai, εjaij/3C◁,
jf▷x◁j ½ εjxj/2.

But E does not have density 0 at 0, because

This contradiction of the approximate differentiability of f at 0 completes the
proof.
3.3. Approximation of a Lipschitz Function by a C 1 Function [Federer,
3.1.15].
Suppose that A ² Rm and that f: A ! Rn is Lipschitz. Given ε > 0
there is a C1 function g: Rm ! Rn such that L mfx 2 A: f▷x◁6D g▷x◁g  ε.
Note that the approximation is in the strongest sense: the functions coincide
except on a set of measure ε. The proof of 3.3 depends on Whitney’s Exten-
sion Theorem, which gives the coherence conditions on prescribed values for
a desired C1 function.
3.4. Lemma (Whitney’s Extension Theorem) [Federer, 3.1.14].
Let A be
a closed set of points a in Rm at which the values and derivatives of a desired C1
function are prescribed by linear polynomials Pa: Rm ! R. For each compact
subset C of A and υ > 0, let ▷C, υ◁be the supremum of the numbers jPa▷b◁
Pb▷b◁j/ja  bj, jjDPa▷b◁ DPb▷b◁jj, over all a, b 2 C with 0 < ja  bj  υ. If
the prescribed data satisfy the coherence condition that limυ!0 ▷C, υ◁D 0 for
each compact subset C of A, then there exists a C1 function g satisfying
g▷a◁D Pa▷a◁, Dg▷a◁D DPa▷a◁
for all a 2 A.
Remarks.
A more general version of Whitney’s Extension Theorem gives
the analogous conditions to obtain a Ck function with values and derivatives
prescribed by polynomials Pa of degree k. In the proof, the value g▷x◁assigned
at a point x /2 A is a smoothly weighted average of the values prescribed at
nearby points of A. The averaging uses a partition of unity subordinate to a
cover of AC which becomes ﬁner and ﬁner as one approaches A.
Sketch of Proof of 3.3.
First extend f to a Lipschitz function on all of
Rm (see [Federer [1, 2.10.43]). Second, by Rademacher’s Theorem 3.2, f is
differentiable almost everywhere. Third, by Lusin’s Theorem [Federer, 2.3.5],
there is a closed subset E of A such that Df is continuous on E and L m▷A 
E◁< ε. Fourth, for any a 2 E, υ > 0, deﬁne

Geometric Measure Theory
Since as υ ! 0, υ ! 0 pointwise, then by Egoroff’s Theorem [Federer, 2.3.7]
there is a closed subset F of E such that L m▷A  F◁< ε and υ ! 0 uni-
formly on compact subsets of F. This condition implies the hypotheses
of Whitney’s Extension Theorem (3.4), with Pa▷x◁D f▷a◁C Df▷a◁▷x  a◁.
Consequently there is a C1 function g: Rm ! Rn which coincides with
f on F.
The following theorem implies for example that Lipschitz images of sets
of Hausdorff measure 0 have measure 0.
3.5. Proposition [Federer, 2.10.11].
Suppose f: Rl ! Rn is Lipschitz and
A is a Borel subset of Rl. Then

Rn N▷fjA, y◁dH my  ▷Lip f◁mH m▷A◁.
Here N▷fjA, y◁ cardfx 2 A: f▷x◁D yg.
Proof.
Any covering of A by sets Si of diameter di yields a covering of
f▷A◁by the sets f▷Si◁, of diameter at most ▷Lip f◁di. Since the approximating
sum ˛m▷diam/2◁m for the Hausdorff measure contains ▷diam◁m,
H m▷f▷A◁◁ ▷Lip f◁mH m▷A◁.
Notice that this formula gives the proposition in the case that f is injective.
In the general case, chop A up into little pieces Ai and add up the formulas
for each piece to obtain

f▷A◁
▷the number of Ai intersecting f1fyg◁dH my  ▷Lip f◁mH m▷A◁.
As the pieces subdivide, the integrand increases monotonically to the multi-
plicity function N▷fjA, y◁, and the proposition is proved.
The beginning of this proof illustrates the virtue of allowing coverings by
arbitrary sets rather than just balls in the deﬁnition of Hausdorff measure. If
fSig covers A, then ff▷Si◁g is an admissible covering of f▷A◁.
3.6. Jacobians.
Jacobians are the corrective factors relating the elements of
areas of the domains and images of functions. If f: Rm ! Rn is differentiable
at a, we deﬁne the k-dimensional Jacobian of f at a, Jkf▷a◁, as the maximum
k-dimensional volume of the image under Df▷a◁of a unit k-dimensional
cube.
If rank Df▷a◁< k, Jkf▷a◁D 0. If rank Df▷a◁ k, as holds in most
applications, then Jkf▷a◁2 equals the sum of the squares of the determinants

Lipschitz Functions and Rectiﬁable Sets
25
of the k ð k submatrices of Df▷a◁. If k D m or n, then Jkf▷a◁2 equals the
determinant of the k ð k product of Df▷a◁with its transpose. If k D m D n,
then Jkf▷a◁is just the absolute value of the determinant of Df▷a◁. In general,
computations are sometimes simpliﬁed by viewing Df▷a◁as a map from the
orthogonal complement of its kernel onto its image. If L: Rm ! Rm is linear,
then L m▷L▷A◁◁D JmL Ð L m▷A◁.
3.7. The Area Formula [Federer, 3.2.3].
Consider a Lipschitz function
f: Rm ! Rn for m  n.
(1) If A is an L m measurable set, then

Remark.
If f is a smooth embedding, then (1) equates the classical area
of the parameterized surface f▷A◁with the Hausdorff measure of f▷A◁.
Therefore for all smooth surfaces, the Hausdorff measure coincides with the
classical area.
Sketch of the Proof of the Area Formula 3.7(1).
We will split up A into
two cases, according to the rank of Df. In either case, by Rademacher’s
Theorem 3.2 and 3.5, we may assume that f is differentiable.
CASE 1.
Df has rank m. Let fsig be a countable dense set of afﬁne maps of
Rm onto m-dimensional planes in Rn. Let Ei be a piece of A such that for each
a 2 Ei the afﬁne functions f▷a◁C Df▷a◁▷x  a◁and si▷x◁are approximately
equal. It follows that
(1) det si ³ Jmf on Ei,
(2) f is injective on Ei, and
(3) the associated map from si▷Ei◁to f▷Ei◁and its inverse both have Lipschitz
constant ³ 1.
Because f is differentiable, the Ei cover A. Reﬁne fEig into a countable
disjoint covering of A by tiny pieces. On each piece E, by (3) and 3.5,
H m▷f▷E◁◁³ H m▷si▷E◁◁
D L m▷si▷E◁◁

and completes the proof of Case 1.
We remark that it does not sufﬁce in the proof just to cut A up into tiny pieces
without using the si. Without the requirement that for a, b 2 E, Df▷a◁³
Df▷b◁, f need not even be injective on E, no matter how small E is.
CASE 2.
DF has rank < m. In this case the left-hand side

Deﬁne a function

Therefore the right-hand side also must vanish. Finally we remark that 3.7(2)
follows from 3.7(1) by approximating u by simple functions.
The following useful formula relates integrals of a function f over a set A
to the areas of the level sets A \ f1fyg of the function.

CASE 1.
f is orthogonal projection. If f is orthogonal projection,
then Jnf D 1, and the coarea formula is reduced to Fubini’s Theorem.
GENERAL CASE.
We treat just the main case Jnf 6D 0. By subdividing A
as in the proof of the area formula, we may assume that f is linear. Then
f D L ° P, where P denotes projection onto the n-dimensional orthogonal
complement V of the kernel of f and where L is a a nonsingular linear
map from V to Rn. Now

3.10. Rectiﬁable Sets [Federer, 3.2.14].
A set E ² Rn is called (H m, m◁
rectiﬁable if H m▷E◁< 1 and H m almost all of E is contained in the union
of the images of countably many Lipschitz functions from Rm to Rn. These
sets are the generalized surfaces of geometric measure theory. They include
countable unions of immersed manifolds (as long as the total area stays ﬁnite)
and arbitrary subsets of Rm.
Rectiﬁable sets can have countably many rectiﬁable pieces, perhaps connec-
ted by countably many tubes and handles and perhaps with all points in Rn as
limit points (cf. Figure 3.10.1). Nevertheless, we will see that from the point
of view of measure theory, rectiﬁable sets behave like C1 submanifolds.
This book will call an ▷H m, m◁-rectiﬁable and H m-measurable set an m-
dimensional rectiﬁable set.

Lipschitz Functions and Rectiﬁable Sets
29
The following proposition shows that a measurable set E is rectiﬁable if
and only if H m▷E◁< 1 and H m almost all of E is contained in a countable
union of C1, embedded manifolds.
3.11. Proposition [cf. Federer 3.2.18].
In the deﬁnition of a rectiﬁable set E,
one can take the Lipschitz functions to be C1 diffeomorphisms fj on compact
domains with disjoint images whose union coincides with E H m almost every-
where. Moreover, the Lipschitz constants of fj and f1
j
can be taken near 1.
Proof.
It sufﬁces to obtain 1% of the set; the rest can be exhausted by repe-
tition. By subdividing them we may assume that the domains have diameter at
most 1. The ﬁrst Lipschitz function f can be replaced by a C1 approximation
g by Theorem 3.3. By the area formula 3.7, we may assume Dg is nonsin-
gular. By subdividing the domain, we may assume it is reasonably small. Take
just a portion of the domain so that image g ² image f, Dg is approximately
constant, and hence g is injective. Altering domain g by a linear transforma-
tion makes Dg ³ identity, and Lip g ³ Lip g1 ³ 1. Finally the domain may
be replaced by a compact subset. Thus 1% of image f is obtained. Simi-
larly replace the second Lipschitz function by a nice one with disjoint image.
Continuing through all the original Lipschitz functions yields 1% of the set E.
Countably many repetitions of the whole process prove the proposition.
The following proposition shows that in a certain sense a rectiﬁable set has
a tangent plane at almost every point. (Using different deﬁnitions, Hardt and
Simon [2, 2.5, p. 22] or Simon [3, 11.6] shows that a modiﬁed “rectiﬁability”
is equivalent to the existence of certain “approximate tangent planes” almost
everywhere.)
3.12. Proposition [Federer, 3.2.19].
If W is an m-dimensional rectiﬁable
subset of Rn, then for almost all points a in W, the density m▷W, a◁D 1 and
Tanm▷W, a◁is an m-dimensional plane. If f is a Lipschitz map from W to R.,
then f is approximately differentiable H m almost everywhere.
EXAMPLE.
This example gives a modest indication of how bad rectiﬁable
sets can be and hence how strong Proposition 3.12 is. Begin by constructing a
Cantor-like set of positive measure as follows. Start with the unit interval. First,
remove the middle open interval of length 1
4. (See Figure 3.12.1.) Second,
from the two remaining intervals, remove middle open intervals of total length
1
8. At the nth step, from the 2n1 remaining intervals, remove middle open
intervals of total length 2▷nC1◁. Let C be the intersection. Clearly C contains
no interval. However, since the total length removed was 2▷nC1◁D 1
2, the
length remaining H 1▷C◁D 1
2.

The image of g intersects [0, 1] in the set C.
Now deﬁne g: [0, 1] ! R2 by
g▷x◁D ▷x, dist▷x, C◁◁.
See Figure 3.12.2.
Then image g and hence E D [0, 1] [ ▷image g◁are rectiﬁable, even though
E fails to be a submanifold at all points of C. Nevertheless, Proposition 3.12
says that 1▷E, x◁D 1 and Tan1▷E, x◁is a line at almost all points x 2 C.
Remarks on Proof.
The proof that m▷W, a◁D 1 almost everywhere uses
a covering argument (see Corollary 2.9).
Proposition 3.11 implies that Tanm▷W, a◁contains an m-plane almost every-
where. Since m▷W, a◁D 1, it can contain no more.
Similarly by Proposition 3.11, at almost every point, neglecting sets of
density 0, W is parameterized by a nonsingular C1 map g: Rm ! Rn. By
Rademacher’s Theorem, 3.2, f ° g is differentiable almost everywhere, and
hence f is approximately differentiable almost everywhere.
Here we state a general theorem which subsumes both the area and the
coarea formula.
3.13. General Area–Coarea Formula [Federer, 3.2.22].
Let W be an m-
dimensional rectiﬁable subset of Rn, Z a 0-dimensional rectiﬁable subset of
R., m ½ 0 ½ 1, and f a Lipschitz function from W to Z. Then

3.14. Product of measures [Federer, 3.2.23].
Let W be an m-dimensional
rectiﬁable Borel subset of Rn and let Z be a 0-dimensional rectiﬁable Borel
subset of R.. If W is contained in the image of a single Lipschitz function on
a bounded subset of Rm, then W ð Z is rectiﬁable and
H mC0
▷W ð Z◁D ▷H m
W◁ð ▷H 0
Z◁.
Remarks.
In general, the additional hypothesis on W is necessary. If 0 D
., it holds automatically. In particular, if W is an m-dimensional rectiﬁ-
able Borel subset of Rn, then W ð [0, 1]. is an ▷m C .◁-dimensional recti-
ﬁable subset of RnC.. If m D n and 0 D ., this proposition is just Fubini’s
Theorem.
The proof, as that of Fubini’s Theorem, shows that the collection of sets on
which the proposition holds is a 2-algebra.
3.15. Orientation.
An orientation of an m-dimensional rectiﬁable subset
W of Rn is a (measurable) choice of orientation for each Tanm▷W, a◁. At
present no further coherence is required, but we will see in Section 4.2 that a
bad choice will make the boundary ∂W much worse. Every rectiﬁable set
of positive measure has uncountably many different orientations (not just
two).
3.16. Crofton’s Formula [Federer, 3.2.26].
If W is an m-dimensional
rectiﬁable set, then the integralgeometric measure of W equals its Hausdorff
measure:
I m▷W◁D H m▷W◁.
Remarks.
Crofton’s Formula follows easily from the coarea formula. The
proof, although stated for one-dimensional measure in R2, applies virtually
unchanged to m-dimensional measure in Rn.

3.17. Structure Theorem [Federer, 3.3.13].
This striking theorem descri-
bes the structure of arbitrary subsets of Rn. Proved for one-dimensional subsets
of R2 by Besicovitch in 1939, it was generalized to general dimensions by
Federer in 1947.
Let E be an arbitrary subset of Rn with H m▷E◁< 1. Then E can be decom-
posed as the union of two disjoint sets E D A [ B with A ▷H m, m◁rectiﬁable
and I m▷B◁D 0.
Remarks.
That I m D 0 means that almost all of its projections onto m-
planes have measure 0; we might say B is invisible from almost all directions.
Such a set B is called purely unrectiﬁable.
The proof, a technical triumph, employs numerous ingenious coverings,
notions of density, and amazing dichotomies. A nice presentation of Besicov-
itch’s original proof of the structure theorem for one-dimensional subsets of
the plane appears in [Falconer, Chapter 3].
Structure theory had been considered the most daunting component of the
proof of the compactness theorem for integral currents, 5.5. In 1986, following
Bruce Solomon, Brian White [3] found a direct argument that obviated the
dependence on structure theory. In 1998, White [4] gave an easier proof by
induction of the structure theorem.
If E is Borel, so are A and B.
EXAMPLE.
Purely unrectiﬁable sets result from Cantor-type constructions.
For example, start with the unit square. Remove a central cross, leaving four
squares, each 1
4 as long as the ﬁrst. (See Figure 3.17.1.) Similarly, remove
central crosses from each small square, leaving 16 smaller squares. Continue,
and let the set E be the intersection.
The set E is purely unrectiﬁable. H 1▷E◁D
p

projections onto lines have measure 0. For example, the projection onto the
x-axis is itself a slim Cantor-like set of dimension 1

CHAPTER 4
Normal and Rectiﬁable Currents
In order to deﬁne boundary and establish compactness properties, it will be
useful to view our rectiﬁable sets as currents, i.e., linear functionals on smooth
differential forms (named by analogy with electrical currents). The action of
an oriented rectiﬁable set S on a differential form ϕ is given by integrating
the form ϕ over the set:
S▷ϕ◁D

S
ϕ dH m.
Currents thus associated with certain rectiﬁable sets, with integer multiplicities,
will be called rectiﬁable currents. The larger class of normal currents will allow
for real multiplicities and smoothing.
The concept of currents is a generalization, by de Rham [2], of distri-
butions. Normal and rectiﬁable currents are due to Federer and Fleming.
Important earlier and contemporaneous work includes the generalized surfaces
of L. C. Young [1, 2], the frontiers of E. De Giorgi [1, 3], and the surfaces of
E. R. Reifenberg [1–3]. For hypersurfaces, rectiﬁable currents are just bound-
aries of the sets of ﬁnite perimeter of Caccioppoli and De Giorgi (see Giusti).
The general reference for this chapter is [Federer, Chapter IV].

in Rn to obtain a new object called an m-vector 	:
	 D v1 ^ Ð Ð Ð ^ vm.

This wedge product is characterized by two properties. First, it is multilinear:

▷u1 C v1◁^ ▷u2 C v2◁D u1 ^ u2 C u1 ^ v2 C v1 ^ u2 C v1 ^ v2.
Second, it is alternating:
u ^ v D v ^ u
or
u ^ u D 0.
For example,
▷2e1 C 3e2  53◁^ ▷7e1  11e3◁
D 14e1 ^ e1  22e1 ^ e3 C 21e2 ^ e1  33e2 ^ e3

D 21e12 C 13e13  33e23.
We have abbreviated e12 for e1 ^ e2.
In general, computation of 	 D v1 ^ Ð Ð Ð ^ vm yields an answer of the form
	 D

i1<ÐÐÐ<im
ai1ÐÐÐimei1ÐÐÐim.
The set of all linear combinations of fei1ÐÐÐim: i1 < Ð Ð Ð < img is the space mRn
of m-vectors, a vectorspace of dimension
n
m
. It has the inner product for
which fei1...img is an orthonormal basis.
The purpose of an m-vector 	 D v1 ^ Ð Ð Ð ^ vm is to represent the oriented
m-plane P through 0 of which v1, Ð Ð Ð , vm give an oriented basis. Fortunately,
the wedge product 	0 D v0
1 ^ Ð Ð Ð ^ v0
m of another oriented basis for P turns out
to be a positive multiple of 	. For example, replacing v1 with v0

If v1, . . . , vm give an orthonormal basis, then 	 D v1 ^ Ð Ð Ð ^ vm has length 1.
A product v1 ^ Ð Ð Ð ^ vm is 0 if and only if the vectors are linearly dependent.
For the case m D n,
v1 ^ Ð Ð Ð ^ vn D det[v1, . . . , vn] Ð e1...n.
An m-vector 	 is called simple or decomposable if it can be written as a
single wedge product of vectors. For example, in 2R4, e12 C 2e13  e23 D

Normal and Rectiﬁable Currents

▷e1 C e3◁^ ▷e2 C 2e3◁is simple, whereas e12 C e34 is not (see Exercise 4.5).
The oriented m-planes through the origin in Rn are in one-to-one correspon-
dence with the unit, simple m-vectors in mRn.
Incidentally, the geometric relationship between two m-planes in Rn is given
by m angles, as appeared at least as early as [Somerville, IV.12], with beautiful
later applications to the geometry of Grassmannians (see Wong) and to area
minimization (see Morgan [1, §2.3]).
Let RnŁ denote the space of covectors dual to Rn, with dual orthonormal
basis eŁ
1, . . . , eŁ
n. We remark that dxj is a common alternate notation for eŁ
j. The
dual space to mRn is the space mRn 
 m▷RnŁ◁of linear combinations of
wedge products of covectors, called m-covectors. The dual basis is feŁ
i1ÐÐÐim : i1 <
Ð Ð Ð < img.
A differential m-form ϕ on Rn is an m-covectorﬁeld, that is, a map
ϕ: Rn ! mRn.
For example, one 2-form on R4 is given by
ϕ D cos x1eŁ
12 C sin x1eŁ
34
D cos x1 dx1 dx2 C sin x1 dx3 dx4.
The support, spt ϕ, of a differential form ϕ is deﬁned as the closure of fx 2
Rn: ϕ▷x◁6D 0g.
A differential m-form ϕ is a natural object to integrate over an oriented, m-
dimensional rectiﬁable set S, because it is sensitive to both the location x 2 S
and the tangent plane to S at x. Let ES▷x◁denote the unit m-vector associated
with the oriented tangent plane to S at x. Then

In a classical setting, with no Hausdorff measure available, the deﬁnition is
more awkward. One uses local parameterizations and proves that the deﬁnition
is independent of the choice of parameterization. Even the appropriateness of
dealing with forms — functions on mRn — is obscured.

In addition to the dual Euclidean norms j	j, jϕj on mRn and mRn, there
are the mass norm jj	jj and comass norm jjϕjjŁ, also dual to each other, deﬁned
as follows:
jjϕjjŁ D supfjh	, ϕij: 	 is a unit, simple m-vectorg;

It follows from convexity theory that

Consequently, jjϕjjŁ D supfjh	, ϕij: jj	jj D 1g, so that the mass and comass

norms by jj
jj.
4.2. Currents [Federer, 4.1.1, 4.1.7].
The ambient space is Rn. Let
D m D fC1 differential m-forms with compact supportg.
For example, in R4, a typical ϕ 2 D 2 takes the form
ϕ D f1 dx1 dx2 C f2 dx1 dx3 C f3 dx1 dx4 C f4 dx2 dx3
C f5 dx2 dx4 C f6 dx3 dx4
D f1eŁ
12 C f2eŁ
13 C f3eŁ
14 C f4eŁ
23 C f5eŁ
24 C f6eŁ
34,
where the fj are C1 functions of compact support. The topology is generated
by locally ﬁnite sets of conditions on the fj and their derivatives of arbitrary
order.

Normal and Rectiﬁable Currents
39
The dual space is denoted Dm and called the space of m-dimensional cur-
rents. This is a huge space. Under the weak topology on Dm, Tj ! T if and
only if Tj▷ϕ◁! T▷ϕ◁for all forms ϕ 2 D m.
Any oriented m-dimensional rectiﬁable set may be viewed as a current as
follows. Let ES▷x◁denote the unit m-vector associated with the oriented tangent
plane to S at x. Then for any differential m-form ϕ, deﬁne
S▷ϕ◁D



ES▷x◁, ϕ

Furthermore, we will allow S to carry a positive integer multiplicity "▷x◁,
with

S "▷x◁dH m < 1, and deﬁne
S▷ϕ◁D

S

ES▷x◁, ϕ

"▷x◁dH m.
Finally, we will require that S have compact support. Such currents are called
rectiﬁable currents.
Deﬁnitions for currents are by duality with forms. The boundary of an m-
dimensional current T 2 Dm is the ▷m  1◁-dimensional current ∂T 2 Dm1
deﬁned by
∂T▷ϕ◁D T▷dϕ◁.
By Stokes’s Theorem, this agrees with the usual deﬁnition of boundary if T
is (integration over) a smooth oriented manifold with boundary. Notice that
giving a piece of the manifold the opposite orientation would create additional
boundary (as in Figure 4.3.6). A boundary has no boundary; i.e., ∂° ∂D 0, as
follows from the easy fact that d ° d.
The boundary of a rectiﬁable current S is generally not a rectiﬁable current.
If it happens to be, then the original current S is called an integral current.
The support of a current is the smallest closed set C such that
▷spt ϕ◁\ C D ∅) S▷ϕ◁D 0.
4.3. Important Spaces of Currents [Federer, 4.1.24, 4.1.22, 4.1.7, 4.1.5].
Figure 4.3.1 gives increasingly general spaces of currents that play an impor-
tant role in geometric measure theory. Figure 4.3.2 pictures some low dimen-
sional examples. The ﬁrst tier has a polygonal curve, an integral current of
ﬁnite length and ﬁnite boundary, and a rectiﬁable region of ﬁnite area but inﬁ-
nite boundary length, bounded by an integral ﬂat chain of inﬁnite length. The
second tier allows real multiplicities and smoothing. The ﬁnal rows illustrate
more general currents without the same geometric signiﬁcance.

D fT 2 Rm: ∂T 2 Rm1g,
Fm D fintegral ﬂat chainsg
D fT C ∂S: T 2 Rm, S 2 RmC1g.
The deﬁnitions of the second tier of spaces will appear in Section 4.5.
We also deﬁne two important seminorms on the space of currents Dm: the
mass M and the ﬂat norm F.
M▷T◁D supfT▷ϕ◁: sup
x
jjϕ▷x◁jjŁ  1g,
F ▷T◁D inffM▷A◁C M▷B◁: T D A C ∂B, A 2 Rm, B 2 RmC1g.
The mass of a rectiﬁable current is just the Hausdorff measure of the associ-
ated rectiﬁable set (counting multiplicities) as explained in Section 4.5. Note
that the norm supx jjϕ▷x◁jjŁ gives a weaker topology on Dm than the one to
which currents are dual, so that a general current may well have inﬁnite mass.
Similarly, F ▷T◁< 1 if and only if T 2 F m.
The ﬂat norm gives a good indication of when surfaces are geometrically
close together. For example, the two unit discs D1, D2 of Figure 4.3.3 are
close together under the ﬂat norm F because their difference T D D2  D1,
together with a thin band A, is the boundary of a squat cylindrical region B
of small volume. On the other hand, in the mass norm, M▷D2  D1◁D 2'.
The ﬂat norm topology is clearly weaker than the mass norm topology but
stronger than the weak topology. Actually it turns out that for integral currents
of bounded mass and boundary mass, the ﬂat and weak topologies coincide as
follows from the Compactness Theorem 5.5, or really, just from Corollary 5.2
(compare Simon [3, 31.2]).

The unit discs D1, D2 are close together in the ﬂat form F because
their difference T D D2  D1, together with a thin band A, is the boundary of a squat
cylindrical region B of small volume. [Morgan 24, Figure 7].

42
Geometric Measure Theory
To obtain a rectiﬁable current which is not an integral current, choose the
underlying rectiﬁable set E with inﬁnite boundary. For example, let E be a
connected open subset of the unit disc bounded by a curve of inﬁnite length,
as in Figure 4.3.4.
E
Figure 4.3.4.
Although a rectiﬁable set E must have ﬁnite area, its boundary can
wiggle enough to have inﬁnite length. Thus a rectiﬁable current need not be an integral
current. Here the width of each successive smaller square rapidly approaches one-third
the length of the larger square.
Alternatively, let E be a countable union of discs of radius 1/k:
E D

k 2 ZC
f▷x, y, z◁: x2 C y2  k2, z D k1g.
See Figure 4.3.5.
As a second alternative, decompose the unit disc into the inﬁnitely many
concentric annuli
An D f1/▷n C 1◁< r  1/ng
of Figure 4.3.6 with alternating orientations.
In all three examples, the associated rectiﬁable current T is not an integral
current, and ∂T is an integral ﬂat chain but not a rectiﬁable current.

Normal and Rectiﬁable Currents
43
Figure 4.3.5.
This inﬁnite collection of discs gives another example of a rectiﬁable
current which is not an integral current. There is ﬁnite total area, but inﬁnite total
boundary length.
Figure 4.3.6.
Giving alternating orientations to concentric annuli creates inﬁnite
boundary so that the disc is no longer an integral current. [Morgan 24, Fig. 6].

44
Geometric Measure Theory
Actually, only by having inﬁnite boundary mass can a rectiﬁable current fail
to be an integral current. The difﬁcult Closure Theorem, 5.4, will show that
▷1◁
Im D fT 2 Rm: M▷∂T◁< 1g,
Rm D fT 2 Fm: M▷T◁< 1g.
(The equivalence of these two equalities follows immediately from the deﬁ-
nitions.)
Remarks on Supports and Notation.
Let K be a compact C1 submanifold
of Rn, with or without boundary (or more generally, a “compact Lipschitz
neighborhood retract”). Federer uses the subscript K to denote support in K.
For example,
Rm,K D fT 2 Rm: spt T ² Kg.
(For arbitrary compact K, Rm,K has a more technical meaning [Federer, 4.1.29].)
Similarly, a norm FK is deﬁned by
FK▷T◁
 inffM▷A◁C M▷B◁: T D A C ∂B, A 2 Rm,K, B 2 RmC1,Kg.
If K is any large ball containing spt T, then FK▷T◁equals what we have called
F ▷T◁, as can be seen by projecting the A and B from the deﬁnition of F
onto K. In the other main case of interest, when K is a compact C1 submani-
fold of Rn, FK▷T◁½ F ▷T◁, with strict inequality sometimes. However, F K
and F
yield the same topology on F m,K, the integral ﬂat chains supported
in K.
4.3A. Mapping Currents.
Next we want to deﬁne the image of a compactly
supported current under a C1 map f: Rn ! R,. First, for any simple m-
vector 	 D v1 ^ Ð Ð Ð ^ vm 2 mRn, and point x in the domain of f, deﬁne the
push-forward of 	 in mR,:
[m▷Df▷x◁◁]▷	◁D ▷Df▷x◁◁▷v1◁^ Ð Ð Ð ^ ▷Df▷x◁◁▷vm◁.
The map m▷Df▷x◁◁extends to a linear map on all m-vectors.
Second, for any differential m-form ϕ 2 D m▷R,◁, deﬁne its pullback f♯ϕ
on Rn by
h	, f♯ϕ▷x◁i D h[m▷Df▷x◁◁]▷	◁, ϕ▷f▷x◁◁i.

Finally, for any compactly supported current T 2 Dm▷Rn◁, deﬁne its push-
forward f♯T 2 Dm▷R,◁by
▷f♯T◁▷ϕ◁D T▷f♯ϕ◁.
If T is the rectiﬁable current associated with some oriented rectiﬁable set
E, then f♯T is the rectiﬁable current associated with the oriented rectiﬁ-
able set f▷E◁, with the appropriate multiplicities (see Exercise 4.23). The
boundary ∂▷f♯T◁D f♯∂T. In many cases the smoothness hypothesis on f
may be relaxed.
4.3B. Currents Representable by Integration.
A current T 2 Dm is called
representable by integration if there is a Borel regular measure jjTjj on Rn,
ﬁnite on compact sets, and a function ET: Rn ! mRn with jjET▷x◁jj D 1 for
jjTjj almost all x such that
T▷ϕ◁D

hET▷x◁, ϕ▷x◁idjjTjjx.
The mass M▷T◁is just the total measure jjTjj▷Rn◁. We write T D jjTjj ^ ET.
A current T 2 Dm of ﬁnite mass is automatically representable by integra-
tion, as follows from the representation theory of general measure theory. On
the other hand, the current T 2 Dm▷Rn◁deﬁned by
T▷a1 dx1 ^ Ð Ð Ð ^ dxm C Ð Ð Ð◁D ∂a1
∂x1
▷p◁,
where p is a ﬁxed point in Rn, has inﬁnite mass, and is not representable by
integration.
Every rectiﬁable current S is representable by integration. Indeed, if E is the
associated set with multiplicity function l, then jjSjj is the measure l▷H m

and ES is the unit m-vectorﬁeld orienting E. S D l▷H m

4.4. Theorem [Federer, 4.1.28].
The following are equivalent deﬁnitions for
T 2 Em to be a rectiﬁable current.
▷1◁Given ε > 0, there are an integral polyhedral chain P 2 Pm▷R,◁and a
Lipschitz function f: R, ! Rn such that
M▷T  f♯P◁< ε.
▷2◁There are a rectiﬁable set B and an H m

is associated with /▷x◁, and T▷ϕ◁D

Bh/▷x◁, ϕ▷x◁i dH m.
Remarks.
In (1), if T is supported in a closed ball K, one may assume
spt f♯P ² K, by replacing f♯P by its projection onto K. Actually, Federer
takes (1) as the deﬁnition of Rm, whereas we have used (2).
A current ▷H m
B◁^ / can fail to be rectiﬁable in several ways: the set
B could fail to be rectiﬁable or to have compact closure; the total mass

B jj/▷x◁jj dH m could fail to be ﬁnite; the given m-vector /▷x◁could fail to be
tangent to B at x; or j/▷x◁j could fail to be an integer.
Proof Sketch.
First suppose (1) holds. Since each side of the polyhedral
chain is a subset of some Rm, its image under f is rectiﬁable and hence f♯P
is a rectiﬁable current and satisﬁes (2). But now T, as a mass convergent sum
of such, obtained by successive approximation, is a rectiﬁable current.
The opposite implication depends on the following lemma of measure
theory.
LEMMA.
Let A be a bounded ▷L m-measurable◁subset of Rm. Then given
ε > 0, there is a ﬁnite disjoint set of m-simplices which coincide with A except
for a set of measure less than ε.
Proof of Lemma.
We may assume that A is open, by replacing A by a
slightly larger open set. Cover 1% of A by disjoint simplices (as in the proof
of the Besicovitch Covering Theorem, 2.7). Repeat on what is left. After N
repetitions, 1  ▷.99◁N of A is covered by disjoint simplices, as desired.
Completion of Proof of Theorem.
Suppose T satisﬁes (2). The rectiﬁable
set B is the union of Lipschitz images of subsets of Rm. Use the lemma to
approximate B by images of polyhedra.
4.5. Normal Currents [Federer, 4.1.7, 4.1.12].
In preparation for the deﬁ-
nitions of more general spaces of currents, we deﬁne a more general ﬂat

norm, F. For any current T 2 Dm, deﬁne
F▷T◁D supfT▷ϕ◁: ϕ 2 D m, jjϕ▷x◁jjŁ  1 and jjdϕ▷x◁jjŁ  1 for all xg
D minfM▷A◁C M▷B◁: T D A C ∂B, A 2 Em, B 2 EmC1g.
The second equality shows the similarity of the norm F and the previously
deﬁned norm F. Inequality () is easy, since if T D A C ∂B as in the minimum
and ϕ is as in the supremum, then
T▷ϕ◁D ▷A C ∂B◁▷ϕ◁D A▷ϕ◁C B▷dϕ◁ M▷A◁C M▷B◁.
Equality is proved using the Hahn–Banach Theorem (Federer [1, p. 367]).
Now continuing the deﬁnitions of the spaces of currents in the diagram in
the beginning of Section 4.3, let
Nm D fT 2 Em: M▷T◁C M▷∂T◁< 1g
D fT 2 Em: T and ∂T are representable by integrationg,
Fm D F-closure of Nm in Em,
Rm D fT 2 Fm: M▷T◁< 1g,
Pm D f real linear combinations of elements of Pmg.
The important space Nm of normal currents allows real densities and smooth-
ing. For example, if A is the unit square region
f▷x, y◁: 0  x  1, 0  y  1g

Whether every normal current can be written as an integral of integral currents
without cancellation has been a subject of research. A counterexample was
provided by M. Zworski.
4.6. Proposition [Federer, 4.1.17].
The space Rm is the M-closure of Nm
in Em.
Proof.
Clearly Rm is M-closed in Em. Suppose T 2 Rm. Given ε >
0, choose S 2 Nm such that F▷T  S◁< ε. Hence there are currents A 2

Em and B 2 EmC1 such that T  S D A C ∂B and M▷A◁C M▷B◁< ε. Since
M▷∂B◁D M▷T  S  A◁< 1, ∂B 2 Nm. Therefore S C ∂B 2 Nm, and M▷T 
▷S C ∂B◁◁D M▷A◁< ε. Hence T is the M-closure of Nm, as desired.
We have seen examples of m-dimensional normal currents based on higher-
dimensional sets. The following theorem shows that even real ﬂat chains
cannot be supported in lower-dimensional sets. The hypothesis that the
integral geometric measure I m▷spt T◁D 0 holds if the Hausdorff measure
H m▷spt T◁D 0, as follows easily from the deﬁnition of I m▷2.4◁.
4.7. Theorem [Federer, 4.1.20].
If T 2 Fm▷Rn◁and I m▷spt T◁D 0, then
T D 0.
EXAMPLES.
The current S 
 H 0
f▷0, 0◁g ^ e1 2 D1 is not ﬂat because
I 1▷spt S◁D I 1f▷0, 0◁g D 0. The current
T D H 1
f▷0, y◁: 0  y  1g ^ e1
is not ﬂat, because if it were, its projection on the x-axis, which is S, would
be ﬂat. (See Figure 4.7.1.) This example illustrates the principle that for
a ﬂat current, the prescribed vectorﬁeld must lie down “ﬂat” (see Federer
[1, 4.1.15]). The suggestiveness of the term ﬂat is a happy accident.
H. Whitney, also a student of music, coined the term for the smaller of his
ﬂat and sharp norms, originally designated jj jj♭, and jj jj♯.
Figure 4.7.1.
The current T is not ﬂat; its prescribed vectorﬁeld is not tangent to the
underlying set.

Geometric Measure Theory
Outline of Proof.
I. Smoothing.
A smooth normal current in Rn is one of the form L n ^ 	,
with 	 a smooth m-vectorﬁeld of compact support. Any normal current T can
be approximated in the ﬂat norm by a smooth normal current Tε D L n ^ 	 as
follows. Let f be a smooth approximation to the delta function at 0, and put
Tε D

x2Rn f▷x◁Ð 4x♯T dL nx.
II. If T 2 Fn▷Rn◁, then T is of the form L n ^ 	 for some vectorﬁeld 	
[Federer, 4.1.18].
Notice the assumption of codimension 0, where the norms
F and M coincide. Therefore T can be M-approximated by a normal current
and hence by smoothing by L n ^ 	1, with 	1 a smooth n-vectorﬁeld,
M▷T  L n ^ 	1◁< 21, and hence
M▷L n ^ 	1◁D

j	1jdL n < M▷T◁C 21.
Likewise, T  L n ^ 	1 can be M-approximated by L n ^ 	2, with M▷T 
L n ^ 	1  L n ^ 	2◁< 22, and hence
M▷L n ^ 	2◁D

j	2j dL n < 21 C 22.
Likewise, T  L n ^ 	1  L n ^ 	2 can be M-approximated by L n ^ 	3,
with
M▷T  L n ^ 	1  L n ^ 	2  L n ^ 	3◁< 23,
and
hence
M▷L n ^
	3◁< 22 C 23. Continue. Since
 1
jD1 j	jj < M▷T◁C 21 C 21 C 22 C
22 C Ð Ð Ð D M▷T◁C 2 < 1,  	j converges in L1. Let 	 D  	j. Then T D
L n ^ 	 as desired.
III. Completion of Proof.
For the case m D n, the theorem follows imme-
diately from part II. Let m < n. Since I m▷spt T◁D 0, we may assume spt T
projects to sets of measure 0 in the m-dimensional coordinate axis planes. For
notational convenience we take m D 1, so that T 2 F1▷Rn◁. We consider the
action of T on an arbitrary smooth 1-form
ϕ D f1eŁ

Since T▷ϕ◁D  T▷fjeŁ

j◁D 0. Let pj denote
projection onto the jth coordinate axis, and let T

Since pj#▷T
fj◁2 Fm▷Rm◁is of the form L m ^ 	 by part II, and its support
has measure 0, it must be 0. Therefore T▷fjeŁ
j◁D 0, as desired.
4.8. Theorem [Federer, 4.1.23].
Given a real ﬂat chain T 2 Fm and ε > 0.
there is a real polyhedral approximation P 2 Pm satisfying F▷T  P◁ ε and
M▷P◁ M▷T◁C ε.
Proof.
Since the space Fm is deﬁned as the F-closure of Nm, and if
M▷T◁< 1, T lies in the M-closure of Nm (Proposition 4.6), we may assume
T 2 Nm. By smoothing (cf. proof of 4.7, part I), we may assume T is of
the form T D L n ^ 	▷x◁, where 	▷x◁is a smooth m-vectorﬁeld of compact
support with
 j	▷x◁jdL n < 1. By approximating 	 by step functions, we
may assume T is of the form T D L n
A ^ /, for some bounded set A and m-
vector /. We may assume / D e1ÐÐÐm and A is the unit cube f0  xi  1g ² Rn.
Now we can approximate T D L n
A ^ / by layers. Take a large integer, M,
let
B D fx 2 Rm: 0  xi  1g ð

M, . . . , 1

² Rn,
and let
P D M▷nm◁▷H m
B◁^ e1ÐÐÐm.
Then M▷P◁D M▷T◁and for M large, F▷T  P◁< ε.
4.9. Constancy Theorem [Federer, 4.1.31].
Suppose B is an m-dimensional
connected, C1 submanifold with boundary of Rn, classically oriented by 8. If
a real ﬂat chain T 2 Fm is supported in B and its boundary is supported in the
boundary of B, then, for some real number r,
T D r▷H m
B◁^ 8.
Of course if T is an integral ﬂat chain, then r is an integer.
Proof.
We must show locally that ∂T D 0 means T is constant. We may
assume locally that B D Rm ð f0g ² Rn. Then T is of the form L m ^ 	
for some m-vectorﬁeld 	 D f Ð e1ÐÐÐm (proof of 4.7, part II). For any smooth

4.10. Cartesian Products.
Given S 2 Dm▷Rn◁and T 2 D"▷R,◁, one can
deﬁne their Cartesian product S ð T 2 DmC"▷RnC,◁. The details appear in
Federer [1, 4.1.8. p. 360], but for now it is enough to know that it exists and
has the expected properties.
4.11. Slicing [Federer, 4.2.1].
The Coarea Formula 3.13 relates the area of
a rectiﬁable set W to areas of its slices. In this section we deﬁne (m  1)-
dimensional slices of m-dimensional normal currents by hyperplanes or by
hypersurfaces fu▷x◁D rg. It will turn out that for almost all values of r, the
slices themselves are normal currents, and that the boundary of the slice is
just the slice of the boundary. For rectiﬁable sets the two notions of slicing
agree (4.13).
First, for any current T 2 Dm and C1 differential k-form ˛, deﬁne a current
T
˛ 2 Dmk by
▷T
˛◁▷ϕ◁D T▷˛ ^ ϕ◁.
In particular, if ˛ is a function (0-form) f, then ▷T
f◁▷ϕ◁D T▷fϕ◁. The
symbol
for such “interior multiplication,” sometimes called “elbow,” points
to the term of lower degree which gets pushed to the other side in the deﬁnition.
If T is representable by integration, T D jjTjj ^ ET, then it sufﬁces to assume
that
 jfjdjjTjj < 1. Indeed, then T
f D fjjTjj ^ ET: one just multiplies the
multiplicity by f. Of course, even if T is rectiﬁable, T
f will not be, unless
f is integer valued. For A ² Rn, deﬁne “T restricted to A,” T
A D T
;A,
where ;A is the characteristic function of A.
For a normal current T 2 NmRn, a Lipschitz function u: Rn ! R, and a
real number r, deﬁne the slice

Remarks.
If T is an integral current, so is almost every slice, as will follow
from the Closure Theorem, 5.4(2,3), and 4.11(5) (or as is shown directly
in Simon [3, §28]). Slicing can be generalized to a vector-valued function
u: Rn ! Rl [Federer, 4.3].

If T has no boundary, then

The lemma says that if almost all such “slices by spheres” are rectiﬁable, then
T is rectiﬁable.

If T is a normal current without boundary
and if, for each a 2 Rn, ∂▷T
B▷a, r◁◁is rectiﬁable for almost all r 2 R, then
T is rectiﬁable.
Remarks.
This lemma is crucial to proving the Closure and Compactness
Theorems of Chapter 5. The proof of this lemma in Federer uses structure
theory and a covering argument. In 1986, following the work of Solomon,
White [3] discovered a way of circumvent the structure theory at almost no
cost.
4.13. Proposition [Federer, 4.3.8, 3.2.22].
Let W be an m-dimensional rec-
tiﬁable set in Rn, u a Lipschitz function from W to R". Then for almost all z 2
R", W \ u1fzg is rectiﬁable, and the associated current is the slice hT, u, rCi
of the current T associated to W.

CHAPTER 5
The Compactness Theorem and the
Existence of Area-Minimizing Surfaces
The Compactness Theorem, 5.5, deserves to be known as the fundamental
theorem of geometric measure theory. It guarantees solutions to a wide class
of variational problems in general dimensions. It says that a certain set T
of surfaces is compact in a natural topology. The two main lemmas are the
Deformation Theorem, 5.1, which will imply in 5.2 that T is totally bounded,
and the Closure Theorem, 5.4, which will imply that T is complete.
5.1. The
Deformation
Theorem
[Federer,
4.2.9].
The
Deformation
Theorem approximates an integral current T by deforming it onto a grid
of mesh 2ε > 0. (See Figure 5.1.1.) The resulting approximation, P, is
automatically a polyhedral chain. The main error term is ∂S, where S is the
surface through which T is deformed. There is a secondary error term, Q, due
to moving ∂T into the skeleton of the grid.
Whenever T 2 ImRn and ε > 0, there exist P 2 PmRn, Q 2 ImRn, and S 2
ImC1Rn such that the following conditions hold with 
 D 2n2mC2:

The Deformation Theorem describes a multistep process for deforming
a given curve T onto a polygon P in the 2ε grid. During the process surfaces S1 and
S2 are swept out. The endpoints of T trace out curves Q1, Q2, and Q3.
(3) spt P is contained in the m-dimensional 2ε grid; i.e., if x 2 spt P, then
at least n  m of its coordinates are even multiples of ε. Also, spt ∂P is
contained in the (m  1)-dimensional 2ε grid.

Proof Sketch, Case m D 1, n D 3. Let Wk denote the k-dimensional ε grid:
Wk D f▷x1, x2, x3◁2 R3 : at least 3  k of the xj are even multiples of εg.
Then W2 consists of the boundaries of 2ε ð 2ε ð 2ε cubes.
First project the curve T radially outward from the centers of the cubes onto
W2. (For now, suppose T stays away from the centers.) Let S1 be the surface
swept out by T during this projection, let Q1 be the curve swept out by ∂T,
and let T1 be the image of T in W2. Then, with suitable orientations,
T D T1 C Q1 C ∂S1.

The Compactness Theorem and the Existence of Area-Minimizing Surfaces

The mass of T1 is of the same order as the mass of T, M▷T1◁¾ M▷T◁.
Likewise M▷∂T1◁¾ M▷∂T◁, M▷Q1◁¾ εM▷∂T◁, and M▷S1◁¾ εM▷T◁.
Second, W1, the 1-skeleton of W2, consists of the boundaries of 2ε ð 2ε
square regions. Project the curve T1 radially outward from the centers of the
squares onto W1. Let S2 be the surface swept out by T1, let Q2 be the curve
swept out by ∂T1, and let T2 be the image of T1 in W1. Then, T1 D T2 C Q2 C
∂S2, and the masses are of order M▷T2◁¾ M▷T1◁¾ M▷T◁, M▷∂T2◁¾ M▷∂T◁,
M▷Q2◁¾ εM▷∂T◁, and M▷S2◁¾ εM▷T◁.
Third, let Q3 consist of line segments from each point of ∂T2 to the nearest
point in the 0-skeleton W0. Put P D T2  Q3. Then not only does P lie in
W1, but also ∂P lies in W0. In particular, P is an integral polyhedral chain.
The masses satisfy
M▷Q3◁¾ εM▷∂T◁,
M▷P◁D M▷T2◁C M▷Q3◁¾ M▷T◁C εM▷∂T◁,
M▷∂P◁D M▷∂T2◁¾ M▷∂T◁.
Let Q D Q1 C Q2 C Q3 and S D S1 C S2. Then T D P C Q C ∂S. The
masses satisfy
M▷Q◁D M▷Q1◁C M▷Q2◁C M▷Q3◁¾ εM▷∂T◁,
M▷S◁¾ εM▷T◁,
completing the proof.
There is one problem with the foregoing sketch. If the original curve winds
tightly about (or, worse, passes through) one of the centers of radial projection,
the mass of its projection could be an order larger than its own mass. In this
case, one moves the curve a bit before starting the whole process. If the original
curve winds throughout space, it may be impossible to move it away from the
centers of projection, but the average distortion can still be controlled.
5.2. Corollary.
The set
T D fT 2 Im : spt T ² Bn▷0,c1◁, M▷T◁ c2, and M▷∂T◁ c3g
is totally bounded under F.
Proof.
Each T 2 T can be well approximated by a polyhedral chain P in
the ε-grid with M▷P◁ 
[c2 C εc3] and spt P ² Bn▷0,c1 C 2nε◁by 5.1(4).
Since there are only ﬁnitely many such P, T is totally bounded.

That T bounds some rectiﬁable current S is shown by taking the

estimate on M(S). It was long conjectured that the worst case (exhibiting
the best constant) was the sphere, in all dimensions and codimensions. This
conjecture was proven in 1986 by Almgren [2]. For merely stationary surfaces,
an isoperimetric inequality still holds [Allard, § 7.1], but the sharp constant
remains conjectural, even for minimal surfaces in R3. For more general
(bounded) integrands than area, an isoperimetric inequality follows trivially
for minimizers, but remains conjectural for stationary surfaces, even in R3.
The Isoperimetric Theorem 5.3 extends from Rn to a smooth compact
Riemannian manifold M. One must assume that T is a boundary, and the
constant 
 depends on M. A cycle of small mass is a boundary. These exten-
sions are special cases of the isoperimetric inequality of 12.3, with B D ∅.
For more on these results, see Chapter 17.
The proof of 5.3 is a bizarre application of the Deformation Theorem,
T D P C Q C ∂S. One chooses ε large, a grid large enough to force the approx-
imation P to T to be 0. See Figure 5.3.1.
Proof.
Choose ε so that 
M▷T◁D εm, and apply the Deformation Theorem
to obtain T D P C Q C ∂S. Since ∂T D 0, Q D 0. By 5.1(2), M▷P◁ 
M▷T◁.
But, since P lies in the 2ε grid, M(P) must be a multiple of ▷2ε◁m, which
exceeds 
M▷T◁by choice of ε. Therefore P D 0. Now T D ∂S, and, by 5.1(2),
M▷S◁ ε

Consequently,

Remarks.
This result, speciﬁcally (1), is the hard part of the Compactness
Theorem. It depends on Lemma 4.12, the characterization of rectiﬁable sets

by rectiﬁable slices. The original proof of Lemma 4.12 used structure theory.
However, in 1986 White [3] found a simpler and more direct argument.
It follows directly from the deﬁnition of F m that fT 2 F m: spt T ² B▷0,R◁g
is F complete. Consequence (4) now follows by the lower semicontinuity of
M (Exercise 4.22) and the continuity of ∂.

We leave it as an exercise (5.2) to check that for each m, ▷1◁)

assuming all three conclusions for m  1.
To prove (1), suppose that a sequence of integral currents Qi 2 Im converges
in the F norm to a normal current T 2 Nm. We must show that T 2 Im.
By induction, we may assume that ∂T 2 Im1. By replacing T with T  T1,
where T1 2 Im has the same boundary as T, we may assume that ∂T D 0.
By Lemma 4.12, it sufﬁces to show that for all points p 2 Rn, for almost
every positive real number r, the slice ∂▷T
B▷p, r◁◁is rectiﬁable. We may
assume that the Qi’s converge so rapidly that

T is an integral current, and (1) is proved. As mentioned, (2) and (3) follow.
To prove (4), let Tj be a Cauchy sequence in T. By the completeness of

Let K be a closed ball

fT 2 ImRn: spt T ² K, M▷T◁ c, and M▷∂T◁ cg
is F compact.
Remark.
More generally, K may be a compact C1 submanifold of Rn or a
compact Lipschitz neighborhood retract (cf. Federer [1, 4.1.29]), yielding the
Compactness Theorem in any C1 compact Riemannian manifold M. (Any C1
embedding of M in Rn, whether or not isometric, will do, since altering the
metric only changes the ﬂat norm by a bounded amount and does not change
the topology, as Brian White pointed out to me.)

5.6. The Existence of Area-Minimizing Surfaces.
Let B be an (m  1)-
dimensional rectiﬁable current in Rn with ∂B D 0. Then there is an m-
dimensional area-minimizing rectiﬁable current S with ∂S D B.

Remarks.
S area minimizing means that, for any rectiﬁable current T with
∂T D ∂S, M▷S◁ M▷T◁. That B bounds some rectiﬁable current is shown by
taking the cone over B. Even if B is a submanifold, S is not in general.
Proof.
Let B▷0,A◁be a large ball containing spt B. Let Sj be a sequence
of rectiﬁable currents with areas decreasing to inffM▷S◁: ∂S D Bg. The ﬁrst
problem is that the spt Sj may send tentacles out to inﬁnity. Let denote the
Lipschitz map which leaves the ball B▷0,A◁ﬁxed and radially projects points
outside the ball onto the surface of the ball (Figure 5.6.1). is distance
nonincreasing and hence area nonincreasing. Therefore by replacing Sj by
#Sj, we may assume that spt Sj ² B▷0,A◁.

In the proof of the existence of an area-minimizing surface with given
boundary B, it is necessary to keep surfaces under consideration inside some large
ball B▷0,A◁. This is accomplished by projecting everything outside the ball onto its
surface.
Now using the Compactness Theorem we may extract a subsequence which
converges to a rectiﬁable current S. By the continuity of ∂and the lower
semicontinuity of mass (Exercise 4.22), ∂S D B and M▷S◁D inffM▷T◁: ∂T D

5.7. The Existence of Absolutely and Homologically Minimizing Surfaces
in Manifolds [Federer, 5.1.6].
Let M be a compact, C1 Riemannian mani-
fold. Let T be a rectiﬁable current in M. Then among all rectiﬁable currents S
in M such that ∂S D ∂T (respectively, S  T D ∂X for some rectiﬁable current
X in M), there is one of least area.
S is called absolutely or homologically area minimizing. The methods also
treat free boundary problems (cf. 12.3).
Proof.
Given the Remark after the Compactness Theorem, 5.5, we just
need to check that a minimizing limit stays in the same homology class. If
F ▷Si  S◁is small, Si  S D A C ∂B, with M(A) and M(B) small. Let Y1 be the
area minimizer in Rn with ∂Y1 D A. Since M▷Y1◁is small, by monotonicity
9.5, Y1 stays close to M and hence may be retracted onto Y in M. Since
Si  S D ∂Y C ∂B, therefore S ¾ Si, as desired.

CHAPTER 6
Examples of Area-Minimizing Surfaces
It can be quite hard to prove that any particular surface is area minimizing.
After all, it must compare favorably with all other surfaces with the given
boundary. Fortunately, there are a number of beautiful examples.
6.1. The Minimal Surface Equation [Federer, 5.4.18].
Let f be a C2,
real-valued function on a planar domain D, such that the graph of f is area
minimizing. Then F satisﬁes the minimal surface equation:
▷1 C f2
y ◁fxx  2fxfyfxy C ▷1 C f2
x ◁fyy D 0.
Conversely, if f satisﬁes the minimal surface equation on a convex domain,
then its graph is area minimizing.
The minimal surface equation just gives the necessary condition that under
smooth variations in the surface, the rate of change of the area is 0. This
condition turns out to be equivalent to the vanishing of the mean curvature.
A smoothly immersed surface which is locally the graph of a solution to
the minimal surface equation (or, equivalently, which has mean curvature 0)
is called a minimal surface. Some famous minimal surfaces are pictured in
Figures 6.1.1–6.1.3b.
Theorem 6.1 guarantees that small pieces of minimal surfaces are area mini-
mizing, but larger pieces may not be. For example, the portion of Enneper’s
surface pictured in Figure 6.1.2 is not area minimizing. There are two area-
minimizing surfaces with the same boundary, pictured in Figure 6.1.4. Some
systems of curves in R3 bound inﬁnitely many minimal surfaces. See Morgan
[6] and references therein or the popular articles by Morgan [21, 18].

On the disc (or any other convex domain), there is a solution of the minimal

domains there can be solutions of the minimal surface equation whose graphs
are not area minimizing (Figure 6.1.5).
The ﬁrst part of the proof of 6.1 will afford an opportunity to illustrate
the classical method and notation of the calculus of variations. In general,
begin with a function f: D ! Rm, supposed to maximize or minimize some
functional A▷f◁for the given boundary values fj∂D. Consider inﬁnitesimal
changes υf in f, with υfj∂D D 0. Set to 0 the corresponding change in A,
called the ﬁrst variation υA. Use integration by parts to obtain an equation of
the form

D
G▷f◁Ð υf D 0.
Since this equation holds for all admissible υf, it follows immediately that
G▷f◁D 0. This turns out to be a differential equation for f, called the
Euler–Lagrange equation. When A▷f◁is the area of the graph of f, the
associated Euler–Lagrange equation is the minimal surface equation.
Proof of 6.1.
First we will show that if the graph of f is area minimizing,
then f satisﬁes the minimal surface equation. By hypothesis, f minimizes the

the minimal surface equation.
Second, we prove that the graph over a convex domain of a solution to the
minimal surface equation is area minimizing. This proof uses a calibration,
i.e., a differential form ϕ which is closed (dϕ D 0) and has maximum value
sup ϕ▷◁D 1 as a function on the set of unit k-planes . A surface is said to be

calibrated by ϕ if each oriented tangent plane  satisﬁes ϕ▷◁D 1. The method
shows that a calibrated surface is automatically area minimizing.
Given f: D ! R, deﬁne a 2-form ϕ on D ð R by
ϕ▷x, y, z◁D fx dy dz  fy dz dx C dx dy

f2x C f2y C 1
.
Then for any point ▷x, y, z◁2 D ð R and for any unit 2-vector , ϕ▷◁	 1,
with equality if  is tangent to the graph of f at (x, y, z). Moreover, ϕ is

Now let S denote the graph of f, and let T be any other rectiﬁable current

Therefore S is area minimizing, as desired.

74

Remark.
The same argument with the same calibration shows that if the
graph of f has constant mean curvature, then it minimizes area for ﬁxed
volume constraint.
6.2. Remarks on Higher Dimensions.
For a function f: Rn1 ! R, the
minimal surface equation takes the form
(1)
div
rf

1 C jrfj2 D 0.
The statement and proof of 6.1 apply virtually unchanged.
In higher codimension there is a minimal surface system. For example, for
a function f: R2 ! Rn2, the minimal surface system is
(2)
▷1 C jfyj2◁fxx  2▷fx Ð fy◁fxy C ▷1 C jfxj2◁fyy D 0.
In general codimension, the graph of f need not be area minimizing, even
if the domain is convex. (In an attempted generalization of the Proof of
6.1, ϕ generally would not be closed. For a counterexample, see Lawson and
Osserman.)
6.3. Complex Analytic Varieties [Federer, 5.4.19].
Any compact portion
of a complex analytic variety in Cn ¾D R2n is area minimizing.
With this initially astonishing fact, Federer provided some of the ﬁrst examples
ofarea-minimizingsurfaceswithsingularities.Forexample, fw2 D z3g ² C2 has
an isolated “branch-point” singularity at 0. Similarly, the union of the complex
axis planes fz D 0g and fw D 0g in C2 has an isolated singularity at 0. These are
probably the simplest examples. fw D špzg is regular at 0; it is the graph of
z D w2. The proof, as that of the second part of 6.1, uses a “calibration” ϕ.
Proof.
On Cn D Rn ý Rn, let ω be the K¨ahler form
ω D dx1 ^ dy1 C Ð Ð Ð C dxn ^ dyn.
Wirtinger’s Inequality [Federer, 1.8.2, p. 40] says that the real 2p-form ϕ D
ωp/p! satisﬁes
jϕ▷◁j 	 1
for every 2p-plane , with equality if and only if  is a complex p-plane.
Now let S be a compact portion of a p-dimensional complex analytic
variety, and let T be any other 2p-dimensional rectiﬁable current with the

Since ∂S D ∂T, S  T is a boundary. Of course dϕ D 0, because ϕ has constant

Finally, since ϕ▷◁is always at most 1,

Combining the equalities and inequality yields

We conclude that S is area minimizing, as desired.
The second part of the Proof of 6.1 and 6.3 proved area minimization by
means of a calibration or closed differential form of comass 1, as examples
of the following method.
6.4. Fundamental Theorem of Calibrations.
Let ϕ be a closed differential
form of unit comass in Rn or in any smooth Riemannian manifold M. Let S
be an integral current such that hES, ϕi D 1 at almost all points of S. In Rn,
S is area minimizing for its boundary. In any M, S is area minimizing in its
homology class (with or without boundary).
Proof.
Let T be any comparison surface. Then

6.5. History of Calibrations (cf. Morgan [1, 2]).
The original example
of complex analytic varieties was implicit in Wirtinger (1936), explicit for
complex analytic submanifolds in de Rham [1] (1957), and applied to singular
complex varieties in the context of rectiﬁable currents by Federer [3, §4]
(1965). Berger [2, §6, last paragraph] (1970) was the ﬁrst to extract the under-
lying principle and apply it to other examples such as quaternionic varieties,
followed by Dao (1977). The term calibration was coined in the landmark
paper of Harvey and Lawson, which discovered rich new calibrated geometries
of “special Lagrangian,” “associative,” and “Cayley” varieties.

76
Geometric Measure Theory
The method has grown in power and applications. Surveys appear in Morgan
[1, 2]. Mackenzie and Lawlor use calibrations in the proof (Nance; Lawlor
[1]) of the angle conjecture on when a pair of m-planes in Rn is area mini-
mizing. The “vanishing calibrations” of Lawlor [3] actually provide sufﬁcient
differential-geometric conditions for area minimization, a classiﬁcation of
all area-minimizing cones over products of m spheres, examples of nonori-
entable area-minimizing cones, and singularities stable under perturbations.
The “paired calibrations” of Lawlor and Morgan [2] and of Brakke [1, 2] and
the covering space calibrations of Brakke [3] prove new examples of soap
ﬁlms in R3, in R4, and above. Other developments include Murdoch’s “twisted
calibrations” of nonorientable surfaces, Le’s “relative calibrations” of stable
surfaces, and Pontryagin calibrations on Grassmannians (Gluck, Mackenzie,
and Morgan).
Lawlor [2] has developed a related theory for proving minimization by
slicing. Lawlor and Morgan [1] show, for example, that three minimal surfaces
meeting at 120 degrees minimize area locally.

CHAPTER 7
The Approximation Theorem
The Approximation Theorem says that an integral current, T, can be approx-
imated by a slight diffeomorphism of a polyhedral chain, P, or, equivalently,
that a slight diffeomorphism f#T of T can be approximated by P itself. (See
Figure 7.1.1.) The approximation P actually coincides with f#T except for an
error term, E, of small mass.
7.1. The Approximation Theorem [Federer, 4.2.20].
Given an integral
current T 2 ImRn and ε > 0, there exist a polyhedral chain P 2 PmRn, sup-
ported within a distance ε of the support of T, and a C1 diffeomorphism f of
Rn such that
f#T D P C E
with M▷E◁ ε, M▷∂E◁ ε, Lip▷f◁ 1 C ε, Lip▷f1◁ 1 C ε, jf▷x◁ xj 
ε, and f▷x◁D x whenever dist ▷x, spt T◁ ε.
Proof.
CASE 1.
∂T polyhedral. Since T is rectiﬁable, T D ▷H m

rectiﬁable and jj integer valued. By Proposition 3.11, H m almost all of B is
contained in a countable union [ Mi of disjoint C1 embedded manifolds. At
almost every point x 2 B, the density of B and of [ Mi is 1 (Proposition 3.12),
so that there is a single Mi such that B and Mi coincide at x except for a set
of density 0. Now a covering argument produces a ﬁnite collection of disjoint
open balls Ui ² Rn  spt ∂T and nearly ﬂat C1 submanifolds Ni of Ui such

The Approximation Theorem yields a diffeomorphism f#T of T which
coincides with a polyhedral P except for small measure.
that [ Ni coincides with B except for a set of small jjTjj measure. Gentle
hammering inside each Ui, smoothed at the edges, is the desired diffeomor-
phism f of Rn, which ﬂattens most of B into m-dimensional planes, where
f#T can be M approximated by a polyhedral chain P1 (cf. Proof of 4.4).
Unfortunately the error f#T  P1, although small in mass, may have huge
boundary. Now we use the Deformation Theorem, 5.1, to decompose the error
f#T  P1 D P2 C Q C ∂S.
As usual, Q and S have small mass. But in this case, because f#T  P1 has
small mass, so does P2 and hence so does the remaining term, ∂S. Because
f leaves spt ∂T ﬁxed, ∂▷f#T  P1◁D ∂T  ∂P1 is polyhedral, and hence the
Deformation Theorem construction makes Q polyhedral. Now take
P D P1 C P2 C Q.
Then f#T  P D ∂S has small mass and no boundary.

GENERAL CASE.
When ∂T is not polyhedral, ﬁrst approximate ∂T by the
ﬁrst case,
f1#∂T D P1 C ∂S1,
with M▷S1◁and M▷∂S1◁small. Now f1#T  S1 has polyhedral boundary and
can be approximated by an integral polyhedral chain, P2,

and the error term and its boundary have small mass, as desired.

CHAPTER 8
Survey of Regularity Results
In 1962 Wendell Fleming proved a regularity result that at ﬁrst sounds too
good to be true.
8.1. Theorem [Fleming, 2].
A two-dimensional, area-minimizing rectiﬁable
current T in R3 is a smooth, embedded manifold on the interior.
More precisely, spt T  spt ∂T is a C1 embedded manifold.
In the classical theory, such complete regularity fails. The disc of least
mapping area with given boundary is an immersed minimal surface (see
Nitsche [2, §365, p. 318], Osserman [2, Appendix 3, §1, p. 143], or Lawson
[§3, p. 76]), but not in general embedded. For the boundary pictured in
Figure 8.1.1, a circle with a tail, the area-minimizing rectiﬁable current has
higher genus, has less area, and is embedded. Pictured in Figure 8.1.2, it ﬂows
from the top, ﬂows down the tail, pans out in back onto the disc, ﬂows around
front, and ﬂows down the tail to the bottom. There is a hole in the middle that
you can stick your ﬁnger through. Incidentally, this surface exists as a soap
ﬁlm, whereas the least-area disc does not.
The regularity theorem 8.1 was generalized to three-dimensional surfaces in
R4 by Almgren [6] in 1966 and up through six-dimensional surfaces in R7 by
Simons in 1968. In 1969, Bombieri, De Giorgi, and Giusti gave an example of
a seven-dimensional, area-minimizing rectiﬁable current in R8 with an isolated
interior singularity. Chapter 10 gives a short discussion of this counterexample
as well as an outline of the proof of the regularity results.

The complete interior regularity results for area-minimizing hypersurfaces
are given by the following theorem of Federer.
8.2. Theorem [Federer 2].
An ▷n  1◁-dimensional, area-minimizing recti-
ﬁable current T in Rn is a smooth, embedded manifold on the interior except
for a singular set of Hausdorff dimension at most n  8.
Regularity in higher codimension, for an m-dimensional area-minimizing
rectiﬁable current T in Rn, with m < n  1, is much harder. Until 1983 it was
known only that the set of regular points, where spt T is a smooth embedded
manifold, was dense in spt T  spt ∂T [Federer, 5.3.16]. On the other hand,
m-dimensional complex analytic varieties, which are automatically area mini-
mizing (6.3), can have (m  2)-dimensional singular sets. In a major advance
Almgren proved the conclusive regularity theorem.
8.3. Theorem [Almgren 3, 1983].
An m-dimensional, area-minimizing
rectiﬁable current in Rn is a smooth, embedded manifold on the interior except
for a singular set of Hausdorff dimension at most m  2.
For example, a two-dimensional area-minimizing rectiﬁable current in Rn
has at worst a zero-dimensional interior singular set. In 1988 Sheldon Chang
(Figure 8.3.1) proved that these singularities must be isolated, “classical branch
points.”
Figure 8.3.1.
Graduate student Sheldon Chang sharpened Fred Almgren’s regularity
results for two-dimensional area-minimizing surfaces. Pictured outside the Almgren
house in Princeton. Photo courtesy Jean Taylor.

Geometric Measure Theory
The stronger regularity theory in codimension 1 comes from an elementary
reduction to the relatively easy case of surfaces of multiplicity 1. Indeed,
a nesting lemma decomposes an area-minimizing hypersurface into nested,
multiplicity-1 area-minimizing surfaces, for which strong regularity results
hold. If these surfaces touch, they must coincide by a maximum principle.
(See Section 8.5 and Chapter 10.)
In general dimensions and codimensions, very little is known about the
structure of the set S of singularities. One might hope that S stratiﬁes into
embedded manifolds of various dimensions. However, for all we know to
date, S could even be fractional dimensional.
8.4. Boundary Regularity.
In 1979 Hardt and Simon proved the conclusive
boundary regularity theorem for area-minimizing hypersurfaces.
THEOREM [Hardt and Simon, 1].
Let T be an ▷n  1◁-dimensional, area-
minimizing rectiﬁable current in Rn, bounded by a C2, oriented submanifold
▷with multiplicity 1◁. Then at every boundary point, spt T is a C1, embedded
manifold-with-boundary.
Notice that general regularity is stronger at the boundary than on the interior,
where there can be an (n  8)-dimensional singular set. The conclusion is
meant to include the possibility that spt T is an embedded manifold without
boundary at some boundary points, as occurs for example if the given boundary
is two concentric, similarly oriented planar circles. (See Figure 8.4.1.)
Multiplicity 2
Multiplicity 1
Figure 8.4.1.
This example shows that part of the given boundary can end up on the
interior of the area-minimizing surface T.
The surface of Figure 8.1.2 at ﬁrst glance may seem to have a boundary
singularity where the tail passes through the disc. Actually, as you move down
the tail, the inward conormal rotates smoothly and rapidly almost a full 360°.
B. White [5] has generalized regularity to smooth boundaries with multi-
plicities.

Survey of Regularity Results
85
In higher codimension, boundary singularities can occur.
For the classical least-area disc in R3, it remains an open question whether
there can be boundary branch points if the boundary is C1 but not real analytic
(see Nitsche [2, §366, p. 320]).
8.5. General Ambients and Other Integrands.
All of the above regu-
larity results continue to hold in smooth Riemannian manifolds other than Rn.
Federer [1, 5.4.15, 5.4.4] gives the proof of Theorem 8.2 for Rn and explains
that the methods can be generalized to any smooth Riemannian manifold,
except possibly a maximum principle. Because two regular minimal surfaces in
local coordinates are graphs of functions satisfying a certain nonlinear, elliptic,
partial differential system (see Morgan [7, §2.2] or Federer [1, 5.1.11]), such
a maximum principle is standard, due essentially to Hopf [Satz 10; see also
Serrin, p. 184].
Incidentally, Schoen, Simon, and Yau, as well as Schoen and Simon, have
proved regularity results for hypersurfaces that are stable but not necessarily
area minimizing in Riemannian manifolds of dimension less than eight.
Regularity for surfaces minimizing more general integrands than area is
harder, and the results are weaker. For a smooth elliptic integrand (see 12.5)
on an n-dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold, an m-dimensional -
minimizing rectiﬁable current is a smooth embedded manifold on an open,
dense set [Federer 1, 5.3.17]. If m D n  1, the interior singular set has dimen-
sion less than m  2 (Schoen, Simon, and Almgren [II.7, II.9] plus an addi-
tional unpublished argument of Almgren as in White [7, Theorem 5.2]). The
achievement of such general regularity results is one of the telling strengths
of geometric measure theory.
The regularity theory extends to hypersurfaces minimizing area subject to
volume constraints.
8.6. Theorem [Gonzalez, Massari, and Tamanini, Theorem 2].
Let T be
an ▷n  1◁-dimensional rectiﬁable current of least area in the unit ball B ² Rn,
with prescribed boundary in ∂B, bounding an oriented region of prescribed
volume.
Then T is a smooth hypersurface of constant mean curvature on the interior,
except for a singular set of dimension at most n  8.
Gonzalez, Massari, and Tamanini state the result in the equivalent termi-
nology of sets of ﬁnite perimeter. Of course once smooth, T must have constant
mean curvature by a simple variational argument.
By the methods of Almgren [1], the result also holds in a smooth Rieman-
nian manifold, although there seems to be no clear statement in the literature.

Hint: First show that the area of any surface S is at least the sum of the areas of
its projections into the x1-x2 and x3-x4 planes.

CHAPTER 9
Monotonicity and Oriented
Tangent Cones
This chapter introduces the two basic tools of the regularity theory of area-
minimizing surfaces. Section 9.2 presents the monotonicity of the mass ratio, a
lower bound on area growth. Section 9.3 presents the existence of an oriented
tangent cone at every interior point of an area-minimizing surface.
9.1. Locally Integral Flat Chains [Federer, 4.1.24, 4.3.16].
We need to
generalize our deﬁnitions to include noncompact surfaces such as oriented
planes. First, deﬁne the space F loc
m
of locally integral ﬂat chains as currents
which locally coincide with integral ﬂat chains:
F loc
m
D fT 2 Dm: for all x 2 Rn there exists S 2 Fm with x /2 spt▷T  S◁g.
For the local ﬂat topology, a typical neighborhood Uυ of 0 takes the form
Uυ D fT 2 F loc
m : spt▷T  ▷A C ∂B◁◁\ U▷0, R◁D ∅,
A 2 Rm, B 2 RmC1, M▷A◁C M▷B◁< υg,
where U(0, R) is the open ball fx 2 Rn: jxj < Rg.
The subspaces Iloc
m ² R loc
m
² F loc
m
of locally integral currents and locally
rectiﬁable currents are deﬁned analogously:
Iloc
m D fT 2 Dm: for all x 2 Rn there exists S 2 Im with x /2 spt▷T  S◁g.
R loc
m
D fT 2 Dm: for all x 2 Rn there exists S 2 Rm with x /2 spt▷T  S◁g.
87

88
Geometric Measure Theory
Alternative deﬁnitions of the locally rectiﬁable currents are given by
R loc
m
D fT 2 Dm: T
B▷0, R◁2 Rm for all Rg
D fT 2 Dm: T
B▷a, R◁2 Rm for all a and all Rg.
There are no similar alternatives for locally integral currents. Indeed,
Figure 9.1.1 shows an integral current T such that T
B▷0, 1◁is not an integral
current, because M▷∂▷T
B▷0, 1◁◁◁D C1.
Figure 9.1.1.
T is a single curve with two endpoints. However, its restriction to the
inside of the circle has inﬁnitely many pieces and inﬁnitely many endpoints. Hence
the restriction of an integral current need not be an integral current.
A locally rectiﬁable current T is called area minimizing if for all a and
R, T
B▷a, R◁is area minimizing.
The Compactness Theorem, 5.5, generalizes to unbounded locally integral
currents in Rn or noncompact manifolds, as nicely explained in Simon [3,
27.3, 31.2]. Without this perspective, Federer [1] must be forever judiciously
restricting currents, a troublesome complication.
9.2. Monotonicity of the Mass Ratio.
For a locally rectiﬁable current T 2
R loc
m
and a point a 2 Rn, deﬁne the mass ratio
m▷T, a, r◁D M▷T
B▷a, r◁◁/˛mrm,
where ˛m is the measure of the unit ball in Rm. Deﬁne the density of T at a,
m▷T, a◁D lim
r!0 m▷T, a, r◁.
The following theorem on the monotonicity of the mass ratio is one of the
most useful tools in regularity theory.
9.3. Theorem [Federer, 5.4.3].
Let T be an area-minimizing locally
rectiﬁable current in R loc
m . Let a lie in the support of T. Then for 0 <
r < dist▷a, spt ∂T◁, the mass ratio ▷T, a, r◁is a monotonically increasing
function of r.

Monotonicity and Oriented Tangent Cones
89
Remark.
If the mass ratio is constant, then T is a cone (invariant under
homothetic expansions).
Monotonicity for Minimal Surfaces and Other Integrands.
Monotonicity
actually holds for stationary (minimal) surfaces or, in a weakened form, even
for bounded mean curvature surfaces, but not for more general integrands
than area [Allard, 5.1]. (Nevertheless 9.5 holds with a smaller constant for
minimizers of general integrands.)
Before giving the Proof of 9.3, we state two immediate corollaries.
9.4. Corollary.
Suppose T 2 R loc

is area minimizing. Then m▷T, a◁exists
for every a 2 spt T  spt ∂T.
9.5. Corollary.
Suppose T 2 R loc

for 0 < r < dist▷a, spt ∂T◁,
M▷T

For example, if furthermore T happens to be an embedded, two-dimensional,
oriented manifold-with-boundary, then
M▷T

See Figures 9.5.1 and 9.5.2.

Since T is area minimizing, M▷T

Hence the absolutely continuous part of ▷T, a, r◁is increasing. Since any

9.6. Corollary.
Let T be an area-minimizing rectiﬁable current in RmRn.
Then for all a 2 spt T  spt ∂T, m▷T, a◁½ 1.
Proof.
Since a rectiﬁable set has density 1 almost everywhere (3.12),
there is a sequence of points aj ! a with m▷T, aj◁½ 1. Let 0 < r <

9.7. Oriented Tangent Cones [Federer, 4.3.16].
We now develop a gener-
alization to locally integral ﬂat chains of the notion of the tangent plane to a
C1 manifold at a point. (See Figure 9.7.1.)

DEFINITIONS.
A locally integral ﬂat chain C is called a cone if every homo-
thetic expansion or contraction R#C D C. If T 2 F loc
m , such a cone C is
called an oriented tangent cone to T at 0 if there is a decreasing sequence
r1 > r2 > r3 > Ð Ð Ð tending to 0 such that r1
j #T converges to C in the local
ﬂat topology. Note that an oriented tangent cone C is a current, whereas a
tangent cone Tan▷E, 0◁as deﬁned in Section 3.9 is a set. In general, spt C ²
Tan▷spt T, 0◁, but equality need not hold (cf. Exercise 9.6).
Remarks.
Figure 9.7.2 illustrates that an oriented tangent cone is not
necessarily unique. As it approaches 0, this curve alternates between following
the x-axis and following the y-axis for successive epochs.
In fact, one of the big open questions in geometric measure theory is whether
an area-minimizing rectiﬁable current T has a unique oriented tangent cone at
every point a 2 spt T  spt ∂T.
Figure 9.7.3 illustrates the need for specifying that C be a cone.
9.8. Theorem [Federer, 5.4.3(6)].
Let T be an area-minimizing rectiﬁable
current in Rm. Suppose 0 2 spt T  spt ∂T. Then T has an oriented tangent
cone C at 0.

T1 and T2 are both invariant under certain sequences of homothetic
expansions, but are not cones.
Because the proof is a bit technical, we will prove just this much: there
is a rectiﬁable current C supported in B(0, 1) and a sequence r1 > r2 >
r3 > . . . tending to 0 such that the sequence r1

to C. The hypotheses of the Compactness Theorem require bounds on both
M▷r1

B▷0, rj◁◁◁and M▷r1
j #∂▷T
B▷0, rj◁◁◁. Fix r0 < dist▷0, spt ∂T◁.

the ﬁrst desired bound. To get the second bound, slicing theory must be
employed to choose the sequence rj carefully. The theory (4.11(4)) says that
for 0 < s < r0,

M▷∂▷T

and
M▷r1#∂▷T
B▷0, r◁◁◁ 2mc.
Therefore a sequence of rj can be chosen satisfying both desired mass bounds.
Now the Compactness Theorem guarantees that some subsequence converges
to the desired rectiﬁable current C, as we set out to prove.
A complete proof of the theorem involves considering not just B(0, 1),
but a sequence of balls B▷0, Rk◁with Rk ! 1, successively applying the
Compactness Theorem to extract subsequences convergent in each B▷0, Rk◁,
and applying a diagonal argument. One difﬁculty comes in choosing the initial
sequence r1 > r2 > r3 > . . . ! 0 such that the
lim

for each k. The remark after 9.3 may be used to conclude that C is in fact a
cone.
9.9. Theorem.

Suppose 0 2 spt T  spt ∂T. Let C be an oriented tangent cone to T at 0. Then

CHAPTER 10
The Regularity of Area-Minimizing
Hypersurfaces
This chapter outlines some parts of the proof of the regularity theorem for
area-minimizing rectiﬁable currents in R n1Rn for n  7. The purpose is to
give an overview, illustrate basic arguments, and indicate why regularity fails
for n ½ 8. The deeper and more technical aspects of the theory are omitted.
The ﬁrst theorem proves a special case by methods that will be useful in the
general case.
10.1. Theorem.
Let T be an area-minimizing rectiﬁable current in R 1R2.
Then spt T  spt ∂T consists of disjoint line segments.
Proof.
It will be shown that every point a 2 spt T  spt ∂T has a neigh-
borhood U▷a, r◁such that spt T \ U▷a, r◁is a straight line segment.
CASE 1.
If ∂T consists of two points (oppositely oriented), then T is the
oriented line segment between them. Our assignment is to prove the most
famous result in the calculus of variations: that a straight line is the shortest
distance between two points! We may assume ∂T D υ▷1,0◁ υ▷0,0◁. Let T0 be
the oriented segment from (0,0) to (1,0):
T0 D [▷0, 0◁, ▷1, 0◁] D H 1
f0  x  1, y D 0g ^ i.

Geometric Measure Theory
We will actually show that T0 uniquely minimizes length among all normal
currents N 2 N1R2 with the same boundary as T0. Indeed,
M▷N◁½ N▷dx◁D ∂N▷x◁D 1 D M▷T0◁.
Therefore T0 is area minimizing. Furthermore, if M▷N◁D 1, then EN D i jjNjj-
almost everywhere.
Next, supposing that M▷N◁D 1, we show that spt N ² fy D 0g. If not,
for some ε > 0 there is a C1 function 0  f▷y◁ 1 such that f▷y◁D 1 for
jyj  ε and M▷N
f◁< 1.
∂▷N
f◁D ▷∂N◁
f  N

because EN D i jjNjj-almost everywhere and df▷i◁D 0. Since ∂▷N
f◁D
∂N D ∂T0
and
T0
is
mass-minimizing,
therefore
M▷N
f◁½ 1.
This
contradiction proves that spt N ² fy D 0g.
Finally, note that ∂▷N  T0◁D 0. By the Constancy Theorem 4.9, N  T0
is a multiple of E1  H 1 ^ i. Since N  T0 has compact support, it must be
0. Therefore N D T0, uniqueness is proved, and Case 1 is complete.
CASE 2.
If the density 1▷T, a◁equals 1, then spt T is a straight line
segment in some neighborhood U▷a, r◁of a. For almost all s, 0 < s <
dist▷a, spt ∂T◁, the slice ∂▷T
B▷a, s◁◁is a zero-dimensional rectiﬁable current
and a boundary, i.e., an even number of points (counting multiplicities). There
cannot be 0 points, because then T0 D 0 would have the same boundary and
less mass than T
B▷a, s◁. Therefore, M▷∂▷T
B▷a, s◁◁◁½ 2. On the other
hand, by slicing theory 4.11(4),

B▷a, r◁◁◁D 2, and ∂▷T
B▷a, r◁◁consists of two points. By Case 1,
spt▷T
B▷a, r◁◁is a line segment, as desired.
The general case will require the following lemma.

T 2 InRn. Such a T is of the form T D En
f for some measurable, integer-
valued function f, and M▷T◁D
 jfj. Just put Mi D fx: f▷x◁½ ig. See
Figure 10.1.1. All of the conclusions of the lemma except the last follow
immediately. The last conclusion on M▷R◁means that there is no cancellation
in the sum R D ∂▷En
Mi◁. The idea of the proof is that, because the Mi are
nested, their boundaries, if they happen to overlap, have similar orientations.
Hence, in their sum, the masses add. We omit the details.

Now we state and sketch the proof of a complete interior regularity theorem
for area-minimizing rectiﬁable currents in Rn, for n  7.
10.2. Regularity for Area-Minimizing Hypersurfaces Theorem (Simons;
see Federer [1, 5.4.15]).
Let T be an area-minimizing rectiﬁable current in
Rn1Rn for 2  n  7. Then spt T  spt ∂T is a smooth, embedded manifold.
The proof depends on a deep lemma, which we will not prove. Our intent
is to show how the pieces ﬁt together. This lemma gives conditions on density
and tangent cones sufﬁcient to establish regularity. A later regularity theorem
of Allard [Section 8] shows that the hypothesis on an oriented tangent cone
is superﬂuous.
10.3. Lemma [Federer, 5.4.6].
For 1  m  n  1, suppose T is an
area-minimizing locally rectiﬁable current in R loc
m Rn, a 2 spt T  spt ∂T,
m▷T, a◁D 1, and some oriented tangent cone to T at a is an oriented, m-
dimensional plane. Then spt T is a smooth, embedded manifold at a.
The second lemma gives a maximum principle for area-minimizing
hypersurfaces. The result is contained in Federer [5.3.18], but it is easier to
prove.
10.4. Maximum Principle.
For n ½ 2, let S1 and S2 be (n  1)-dimensional,
area-minimizing rectiﬁable currents in Rn, and let Mi D spt Si. Suppose that
M1 and M2 intersect at a point a; that, in some neighborhood of a, M1 and M2
are smooth submanifolds; and that M2 lies on one side of M1. Then in some
neighborhood of a, M1 and M2 coincide.
Remark.
The maximum principle holds for singular area-minimizing
hypersurfaces and more generally. Indeed, Ilmanen generalizes it to minimal
hypersurfaces (stationary integral varifolds, not necessarily area-minimizing)
whose singular sets have (n  3)-dimensional Hausdorff measure 0. Solomon
and White treat hypersurfaces stationary for smooth, even elliptic integrands,
at least one of which is smooth.
Proof.
At a, M1 and M2 may be viewed locally as graphs of functions
u1 and u2, satisfying the minimal surface equation (6.2(1)). By a standard

102
Geometric Measure Theory
maximum principle, due essentially to Hopf [Satz 10], the functions u1 and u2
coincide.
The next lemma of Simons provided the ﬁnal ingredient for the regu-
larity theorem. In a remark following the proof of the theorem we discuss
its failure for n ½ 8. This lemma marks a solo appearance of differential
geometry without measure theory.
10.5. Simons’s Lemma [Federer, 5.4.14].
For 3  n  7, let B be an
oriented, compact, (n  2)-dimensional smooth submanifold of the unit
(n  1)-dimensional sphere, such that the cone over B is area minimizing. Then
B is a great sphere.
It is customarily assumed that the submanifold B is connected. That weaker
version of the lemma, applied to the connected components of a general subman-
ifold B, shows that all components are great spheres and hence intersect. This
contradiction shows that B is connected and renders that assumption superﬂuous.
The ﬁnal lemma has an easy proof by slicing.
10.6. Lemma [Federer, 5.4.8, 5.4.9].
For 1  m  n  1, let Q be a locally
rectiﬁable current in R loc
m Rn. Then Q is area minimizing if and only if E1 ð Q
is area minimizing.
Proof of Theorem 10.2.
The proof will be in two parts, by induction. The
initial case, n D 2, was proved by Theorem 10.1.
PART I.
Suppose S is an area-minimizing rectiﬁable current in R n1Rn and
S is of the form S D ▷∂▷En
M◁◁
V for some measurable set M and open
set V. Then spt S \ V is a smooth embedded manifold. To prove Part I, let
a 2 spt S \ V. An oriented tangent cone C to S at a can be shown to be of
the form C D ∂▷En
N◁(cf. Federer [1, 5.4.3]). Similarly, for b 2 spt C  f0g,
an oriented tangent cone D to C at b is of the form D D ∂▷En
P◁. The fact
that C is an oriented cone means that D is an “oriented cylinder” of the form
D D E1 ð Q for some Q 2 R n2Rn1 (cf. Federer [1, 4.3.15]). Since S is area
minimizing, so are C and D D E1 ð Q. By Lemma 10.6 and induction, Q is
an oriented, smooth, embedded manifold, possibly with multiplicity. Hence
D is an oriented, smooth, embedded manifold, with multiplicity 1 because
D is of the form D D ∂▷En
P◁. Therefore any oriented tangent cone to D
at 0 is an oriented, (n  1)-dimensional plane. In particular, since D is an
oriented cone, D itself is an oriented, (n  1)-dimensional plane. Therefore by
Lemma 10.3, spt C  f0g is a smooth, embedded manifold. By Lemma 10.5,
spt C intersects the unit sphere in a great sphere. Hence C is an oriented,
(n  1)-dimensional plane, with multiplicity 1 because C is of the form C D

smooth embedded manifold at a. The containments Mi ² Mi1 imply that each
of these manifolds lies on one side of another. Therefore by the maximum prin-
ciple, 10.4, spt T is a smooth, embedded manifold at a. The theorem is proved.
10.7. Remarks.
The regularity theorem fails for n ½ 8. E. Bombieri, E. De
Giorgi, and E. Giusti (1969), gave an example of a seven-dimensional,
area-minimizing rectiﬁable current T in R8 with an isolated singularity at
0. This current T is the oriented truncated cone over B D S3▷0, 1/

CHAPTER 11
Flat Chains Modulo , Varifolds, and
(M, ε, υ)-Minimal Sets
A number of alternative spaces of surfaces have been developed in geometric
measure theory, as required for theory and applications. This chapter gives
brief descriptions of ﬂat chains modulo , varifolds, and (M, ε, υ)-minimal sets.
11.1. Flat Chains Modulo n [Federer, 4.2.26].
One way to treat nonori-
entable surfaces and more general surfaces is to work modulo 2, or more
generally modulo  for any integer  ½ 2. Two rectiﬁable currents T1, T2
are congruent modulo  if T1  T2 D Q for some rectiﬁable current Q. In
particular, T  T (mod 2). The m-dimensional rectiﬁable currents modulo
, denoted R 
m , are deﬁned as congruence classes of rectiﬁable currents.
For example, consider the M¨obius strip of Figure 11.1.2 bounded by the
curve C. There is no way to orient it to turn it into a rectiﬁable current with
boundary C. However, if it is cut along a suitable curve D, it can then be
oriented as a rectiﬁable current T, and it works out that ∂T  C (mod 2). In
general, rectiﬁable currents modulo 2 correspond to unoriented surfaces.
Two parallel circles, as in Figure 11.1.3, bound an interesting rectiﬁable
current modulo 3. The surfaces of both Figures 11.1.2 and 11.1.3 occur as
soap ﬁlms.
Most of the concepts and theorems on rectiﬁable currents have analogs for
rectiﬁable currents modulo : mass, ﬂat norm, the Deformation Theorem, the
Compactness Theorem, existence theory, and the Approximation Theorem.
One tricky point: to ensure completeness, the integral ﬂat chains congruent
to 0 modulo  must be deﬁned as the ﬂat-norm closure of those of the form Q.

A rectiﬁable current modulo 2 can be nonorientable, like this M¨obius
strip.

Flat Chains Modulo , Varifolds, and (M, ε, υ)-Minimal Sets
107
Figure 11.1.3.
In a rectiﬁable current modulo 3, three sheets can meet along a curve
inside the surface which does not count as boundary.
In codimension greater than 1, it is an open question whether they are all of
the form Q. (The counterexample in Federer [p. 426] is wrong.) However,
every rectiﬁable current congruent to 0 modulo  is of the form Q.
It is generally easier to prove regularity for area-minimizing rectiﬁable
currents modulo 2 than for rectiﬁable currents themselves. Indeed, an m-
dimensional area-minimizing rectiﬁable current modulo 2 in Rn is a smooth
embedded manifold on the interior, except for a rectiﬁable singular set of
locally ﬁnite H m2 measure (Federer [2]; Simon [1]). The only standard regu-
larity result I know which fails modulo 2 is boundary regularity for area-
minimizing hypersurfaces (8.4).
For  > 2, even area-minimizing hypersurfaces modulo  can have codi-
mension 1 singular sets, as Figure 11.1.3 suggests. Taylor [3] proved that
a two-dimensional area-minimizing rectiﬁable current modulo 3 in R3 away
from boundary consists of C1 surfaces meeting in threes at 120° angles along
C1,˛ curves (cf. 13.9). White [8] proved that an ▷n  1◁-dimensional area-
minimizing rectiﬁable current modulo 4 in Rn decomposes locally into a pair
of area-minimizing rectiﬁable currents modulo 2. Moreover, White [7] proved
that for any odd , an ▷n  1◁-dimensional area-minimizing rectiﬁable current
modulo  in Rn away from boundary is a smooth embedded manifold, except
for a singular set of dimension at most n  2. For even  > 2, almost every-
where regularity remains an open question.
11.2. Varifolds [Allard].
Varifolds provide an alternative perspective to cur-
rents for working with rectiﬁable sets. Varifolds carry no orientation, and hence
there is no cancellation in the limit and no obvious deﬁnition of boundary.

108
Geometric Measure Theory
An m-dimensional varifold is a Radon measure on Rn ð GmRn, where
GmRn is the Grassmannian of unoriented unit m-planes through 0 in Rn.
We have seen previously how to associate to a rectiﬁable set E the measure
H m
E on Rn, but this perspective ignores the tangent planes to E. Instead,
we now associate to a rectiﬁable set E, with unoriented tangent planes EE▷x◁D
Tanm▷E, x◁2 GmRn, the varifold
v▷E◁ H m
f▷x, EE▷x◁◁: x 2 Eg.
The varifolds which so arise are called integral varifolds. One allows positive
integer multiplicities and noncompact support.
In general varifolds, the tangent planes need not be associated with the
underlying set. For example, if you cut an edge off a cubical crystal, as in
Figure 11.2.1, because the crystal loves horizontal and vertical directions, the
exposed surface forms very small horizontal and vertical steps. Such a corru-
gation can be modeled by a varifold concentrated half and half on horizontal
and vertical tangent planes in G2R3, whereas in space R3 it is concentrated
on the diagonal surface.
Figure 11.2.1.
If you cut an edge off a cubical crystal, the exposed surface forms
tiny steps, well modeled by a varifold.
The ﬁrst variation υV of a varifold V is a function which assigns to any
compactly supported smooth vectorﬁeld g on Rn the initial rate of change
of the area of V under a smooth deformation of Rn with initial velocity
g. Roughly, the ﬁrst variation is due to the mean curvature of V and the
boundary of V. A varifold is called stationary if υV D 0. Geometrically,
stationary integral varifolds include area-minimizing rectiﬁable currents, area-
minimizing rectiﬁable currents modulo , and many other physical surfaces
such as soap ﬁlms. Some singularities of soap ﬁlms unavoidably count as addi-
tional boundary in the category of rectiﬁable currents or rectiﬁable currents
modulo , but fortunately do not add to their ﬁrst variations as varifolds.

Flat Chains Modulo , Varifolds, and (M, ε, υ)-Minimal Sets
109
There is a compactness theorem for integral varifolds with bounds on
their areas, ﬁrst variations, and supports. There are also general isoperimetric
and regularity theorems. However, it is an open question whether a two-
dimensional stationary integral varifold in an open subset of R3 is a smooth
embedded manifold almost everywhere.
11.3. (M, e, d)-Minimal Sets [Almgren 1].
Perhaps the best model of soap
ﬁlms is provided by the (M, 0, υ)-minimal sets of Almgren. A nonempty,
bounded subset S ² Rn  B with H m▷S◁< 1 and S D spt▷H m
S◁ B is
(M, 0, υ) minimal with respect to a closed set B (typically “the boundary”) if,
for every Lipschitz deformation ϕ of Rn which differs from the identity map
only in a υ-ball disjoint from B,
H m▷S◁ H m▷ϕ▷S◁◁.
Since ϕ need not be a diffeomorphism, it can pinch pieces of surface together,
as in Figure 11.3.1. The M refers to area and may be replaced by a more
general integrand. For more general functions ε▷r◁D Cr˛, ˛ > 0, the inequality
imposed on deformations inside r-balls ▷r  υ◁relaxes to
H m▷S◁ ▷1 C ε▷r◁◁H m▷ϕ▷S◁◁.

A curve S is not (M, 0, υ) minimal if a deformation ▷S◁has less
length.
Such (M, ε, υ)-minimal sets include soap bubbles (with volume constraints);
see Section 13.8.
Three basic properties of (M, ε, υ)-minimal sets are ▷H m, m◁rectiﬁability
[Almgren 1, II.3(9)], monotonicity [Taylor 4, II.1], and the existence of an

It is an open question whether the cone over the tetrahedron is a
least-area soap ﬁlm or whether there might be a smaller soap ﬁlm of higher topological

(M, 0, υ)-minimal tangent cone at every point [Taylor 4, II.2]. The condition
in the deﬁnition that S D spt▷H m
S◁ B may be replaced by the condition
that S be rectiﬁable, with the understanding that S may be altered by a set of
H m measure 0 [Morgan 17, §2.5].
Almgren [1] has proved almost-everywhere regularity results for (M, ε,
υ)-minimal sets. In 1976, Taylor [4] proved that for two-dimensional (M, ε, υ)-
minimal sets in R3, there are only two possible kinds of singularities: (1) three
sheets of surface meeting at 120° angles along a curve and (2) four such curves
meeting at approximately 109° angles at a point (see Section 13.9). These
are precisely the two kinds of singularities that Plateau had observed in soap
bubbles and soap ﬁlms a hundred years earlier. (Warning: Almgren [1] and
Taylor [4] are technical, and I think there are some (correctable) gaps.)
Boundary regularity remains conjectural; see Section 13.9.
It remains an open question today whether a smooth curve in R3 bounds
a least-area soap ﬁlm in the class of (M, 0, υ)-minimal sets, with variable
υ > 0. The problem is that in the limit υ may go to 0. See Morgan [20]. It
is an open question whether the cone over the tetrahedron (the soap ﬁlm of
Figure 11.3.2) is a least-area soap ﬁlm or whether there might be a smaller
soap ﬁlm of higher topological type. Another open question asks whether the
Cartesian product of an (M, 0, υ)-minimal set with an interval is (M, 0, υ0)
minimal (a property which holds trivially for most classes of minimal surfaces;
cf. 10.6).
EXERCISES
11.1. Give an example of a boundary curve in R3 for which the area-minimizing ﬂat
chain modulo 4 has less area than the area-minimizing integral current.
11.2. Let S be the unit 2 disc, and let v▷S◁be the associated varifold. What is
v▷S◁▷Rn ð G2Rn◁?
11.3. Give an example of a two-dimensional set in R3 that is (M, 0, υ) minimal for
small υ but not for large υ.
11.4. Give an example of a two-dimensional set in R3 that is (M, 0, υ) minimal for
all υ > 0 but not area minimizing.

CHAPTER 12
Miscellaneous Useful Results
Federer’s treatise presents many basic methods of geometry and analysis
in a generality that embraces manifold applications. This chapter describes
Federer’s treatment of Sard’s Theorem, Green’s Theorem, relative homology,
functions of bounded variation, and general parametric integrands.
12.1. Morse–Sard–Federer Theorem.
The usual statement of Sard’s The-
orem says that the set of critical values of a C1 function f: Rm ! Rn has
Lebesgue measure 0. Federer’s reﬁnement shows precisely how the Haus-
dorff measure of the image depends on the rank of Df and the smoothness
class of f.
THEOREM [FEDERER, 3.4.3].
For integers m >  ½ 0, k ½ 1, let f be a Ck
function from an open subset A of Rm into a normed vectorspace Y. Then
H C m
k f▷fx 2 A: rank Df▷x◁ g◁D 0.
Note that the usual statement may be recovered by taking Y D Rn,  D n  1,
k ½ m  n C 1. The latest improvement has been provided by Bates.
12.2. Gauss–Green–De Giorgi–Federer Theorem.

of Green’s Theorem says that a C1 vectorﬁeld ▷x◁on a compact region A in

where n▷A, x◁is the exterior unit normal to A at x and d is the element of
area on B. Federer treats more general regions and vectorﬁelds that are merely
Lipschitz.
Federer allows measurable regions A for which the current boundary T D
∂▷En
A◁is representable by integration: T▷ϕ◁D
 hET, ϕi djjTjj (cf. 4.3). If
A is compact, this condition just says that the current boundary has ﬁnite
measure: M▷T◁D jjTjj▷Rn◁< 1. In any case, this condition is weaker than
requiring that the topological boundary of A have ﬁnite H n1 measure.
DEFINITION.
Let b 2 A ² Rn. We call n D n▷A, b◁the exterior normal of
A at b if n is a unit vector,
n▷fx: ▷x  b◁Ð n > 0g \ A, b◁D 0,
and
n▷fx: ▷x  b◁Ð n < 0g  A, b◁D 0.
Clearly there is at most one such n. If b is a smooth boundary point of A,
then n is the usual exterior normal. Even if ∂A is not smooth at b, n may
be deﬁned, as Figure 12.2.1 suggests. The assertion in the theorem below
that the measure jjTjj D H n1
domain n▷A, x◁says roughly that the current
boundary of A coincides with the domain of n▷A, x◁almost everywhere. In
the ﬁnal formula, div  exists almost everywhere because a Lipschitz function
is differentiable almost everywhere.

Suppose B ² M are C1, compact
submanifolds with boundary of Rn (or, more generally, compact Lipschitz
neighborhood retracts; cf. Federer [1, 4.1.29, 4.4.1, 5.1.6]). Two rectiﬁable
currents S, T in M are homologous with respect to B if there is a rectiﬁable
current X in M such that
spt▷T  S  ∂X◁² B.
We say that S and T are in the same relative homology class. Given a rectiﬁable
current S, there is a rectiﬁable current T of least area in its relative homology
class.
EXAMPLE 1.
Let M be a perturbed solid torus in R3, let B be its boundary,
and let S be a cross-sectional disc. The area minimizer T relatively homologous
to S provides a cross-sectional surface of least area. See Figure 12.3.1. The
boundary of T is called a free boundary.
EXAMPLE 2.
Let M be a large, encompassing ball in R3, let B be the surface
of a table (not necessarily ﬂat), and let C be a curve which begins and ends in

homologous to S provides a surface of least area with the ﬁxed boundary C
and additional free boundary in B. It can generally be realized as a soap ﬁlm.

Proof of Existence.
As Brian White pointed out to me, there is a much
simpler existence proof than that of Federer [1, 4.4.2, 5.1.6]. Consider a mini-
mizing sequence Ti, viewed as locally integral currents in M  B (cf. 9.1). By
compactness, we may assume that the Ti converge to a minimizer T. The hard
part is to show that T stays in the same relative homology class. Convergence
means that, for some Y and Z1 in M with small mass,
E D Ti  T  Y  ∂Z1
is supported in a small neighborhood of B. Let Y1 be a minimizer in RN
with ∂Y1 D ∂Y. Since ∂Y1 lies in a small neighborhood of B and because
M▷Y1◁ M▷Y◁is small, by monotonicity, 9.5, Y1 lies in a small neighborhood
of B. Let Z2 be a minimizer in RN with ∂Z2 D Y  Y1. Then M▷Z2◁is small,
and hence Z2 lies in a small neighborhood of M. Let E1 denote the projection
of the cycle E C Y1 onto B; then E C Y1  E1 D ∂Z3, with Z3 in a small
neighborhood of B. We now have
Ti  T D E1 C ∂Z1 C ∂Z2 C ∂Z3,
with E1 in B and the Zi in a small neighborhood of M. Projecting onto M
yields
Ti  T D E1 C ∂Z,
with Z in M, so that T lies in the same relative homology class as Ti, as
desired.

Moreover, every relative cycle with small mass is a relative boundary.
Remarks on Regularity.
Of course, away from B, a relatively homologi-
cally area-minimizing rectiﬁable current enjoys the same regularity as an
absolutely area-minimizing rectiﬁable current. In addition, regularity results
are known along the free boundary (see e.g. Taylor [1], Gr¨uter [1, 2], and
Hildebrandt). In particular, if M is a smooth Riemannian three manifold with
boundary B, then an unoriented homologically area-minimizing surface T rela-
tive to B with T ² B is a C1 submanifold with boundary (Taylor [1, 1(7),
and Theorem 5], preceded by decomposition into multiplicity-1 boundaries of
nested sets as in the Lemma of 10.1 and followed by a maximum principle).
12.4. Functions of Bounded Variation [Federer, 4.5.9; Giusti; Simon
3, §6].
An important class of functions in analysis is the space BVloc of
functions of locally bounded variation. A real-valued function on R1 is in
BVloc if it agrees almost everywhere with a function g of ﬁnite total variation
on any interval [a, b],

or, equivalently, if the distribution derivative Df is a locally ﬁnite measure.
Similarly, a real-valued function on Rn is in BVloc if Df is a locally ﬁnite
(vector-valued) measure. The associated space of currents fEn
fg is precisely
Nloc
n Rn, the locally normal currents of codimension 0. Here we give a sampling
from Federer’s comprehensive theorem on BVloc.

12.5. General Parametric Integrands [Federer 1, 5.1].
In many mathe-
matical and physical problems the cost of a surface depends not only on its
area but also on its position or tangent plane direction. The surface energy of a
crystal depends on its orientation with respect to the underlying crystal lattice
(cf. Taylor [2]). Therefore one considers an integrand ▷x, ◁associating to a
rectiﬁable current T a cost or energy
▷T◁D

▷x, ET▷x◁◁djjTjj.
The most important case remains the area integrand A▷x, ◁D jj. One always
requires to be continuous and homogeneous in . Usually is positive (for 
nonzero), even ▷▷x, ◁D ▷x, ◁◁, and convex ▷▷x, 1 C 2◁ ▷x, 1◁C

a▷◁ ▷a, ◁
is a norm. (If this norm is given by an inner product, then ▷x, ◁is a Rieman-
nian metric.)
The adjective parametric just means that ▷T◁depends only on the geo-
metric surface T and not on its parameterization (geometric measure theory
rarely uses parameterizations at all). Convexity of means each a is convex,

One says is elliptic. Ellipticity, introduced by Almgren, seems to be the
right hypothesis for theorems, but much harder to verify directly than uniform
convexity. The two notions are equivalent in codimension 1.
All of these notions are invariant under diffeomorphisms of the ambient.
In general, semiellipticity implies lower semicontinuity and the existence of
minimizers; ellipticity implies regularity of minimizers (see 8.5). Figure 12.5.1
considers the cost of curves for three integrands ▷◁on the plane for which
horizontal and vertical directions are relatively cheap. 1 is not convex and
not lower semicontinuous, so limit arguments can fail to produce minimizers.
2 is borderline convex and admits nonsmooth minimizers. 3 is uniformly
convex, and the cheapest path between two points is uniquely a straight line.

CHAPTER 13
Soap Bubble Clusters
Soap bubble clusters illustrate simple mathematical principles. Yet despite
notable progress, they defy complete mathematical explanation.
A single soap bubble quickly ﬁnds the least-surface-area way to enclose the
ﬁxed volume of air trapped inside — the round sphere in Figure 13.0.1.
Similarly bubble clusters seek the least-area way to enclose and sepa-
rate several regions of prescribed volumes. This principle of area minimiza-
tion alone, implemented on Ken Brakke’s Surface Evolver (see 16.8), yields
computer simulations of bubble clusters, as in Figure 13.0.2, from the video
“Computing Soap Films and Crystals” by the Minimal Surface Team at the
Geometry Center.
Do soap bubble clusters always ﬁnd the absolute least-area shape? Not
always. Figure 13.0.3 illustrates two clusters enclosing and separating the same
ﬁve volumes. In the ﬁrst, the tiny ﬁfth volume is comfortably nestled deep in
the crevice between the largest bubbles. In the second, the tiny ﬁfth volume
less comfortably sits between the medium-size bubbles. The ﬁrst cluster has
less surface area than the second. It might be still better to put the smallest
bubble around in back.
As a matter of fact, until 2000 (see our new Chapter 14) it remained an
open question whether the standard double bubble of Figure 13.0.4 is the
least-area way to enclose two given volumes, as realized over the course
of an undergraduate thesis by Foisy, despite a proof due to White that the
solution must be a surface of revolution [Foisy, Theorem 3.4; cf. Morgan 3,
Theorem 5.3]. It may seem hard to imagine any other possibilities, until you
see J. M. Sullivan’s computer-generated competitor in Figure 13.0.5, which

does, however, have more area and is apparently unstable. More generally,
both regions might have several components, wrapped around each other.
In general, it is a difﬁcult open question whether each separate region is
connected, or whether it might conceivably help to subdivide the regions of
prescribed volume, with perhaps half the volume nestled in one crevice here,
and the other half in another crevice there.
Similarly, it is an open question whether an area-minimizing cluster may
incidentally trap inside “empty chambers,” which do not contribute to the
prescribed volumes. Figure 13.0.6 shows a 12-bubble with a dodecahedral
empty chamber on the inside, obtained by Tyler Jarvis of Mississippi State
University using Brakke’s Surface Evolver. The computation postulated the
empty chamber; without such a restriction, empty chambers probably never
occur. Michael Hutchings proved that in a minimizing double bubble, there
are no such empty chambers.
This chapter began with my AMS-MAA address in San Francisco, 1991,
available on video [Morgan 4] and written up in Morgan [13, 12].

13.1. Planar Bubble Clusters.
Many of the fundamental questions remain
open for planar bubble clusters — least-perimeter ways to enclose and separate
regions of prescribed areas. A proof of the planar double bubble conjecture
appeared in 1993, the work of a group of undergraduates: Joel Foisy, Manuel
Alfaro, Jeffrey Brock, Nickelous Hodges, and Jason Zimba (see Figure 13.1.1).
(Their work was featured in the 1994 AMS What’s Happening in the Mathe-
matical Sciences.)

In the plane (but not in higher dimensions) the nontrivial general existence
theory [Morgan 19] admits requiring regions to be connected, although they
then must be allowed to bump up against each other. For this restricted
problem, another group of undergraduates — Christopher Cox, Lisa Harrison,
Michael Hutchings, Susan Kim, Janette Light, Andrew Mauer, and Meg
Tilton — proved the standard triple bubble of Figure 13.1.2 minimizing.
13.2. Theory of Single Bubbles.
Simplikios’s sixth century commentary on
Aristotle’s De Caelo (see Knorr [p. 273], recommended to me by D. Fowler),
referring incidentally to work no longer extant, reports that
. . . it has been proved . . . by Archimedes [287–212 B.C.] and Zenodorus [¾200
B.C.] that of isoperimetric ﬁgures the more spacious one . . . among the solids [is]
the sphere.

The standard planar triple bubble (a) provides the least-perimeter way
to enclose and separate three regions of prescribed area, at least in the category of
connected regions, as proved by another group of undergraduates [Cox et al.].
But Archimedes and Zenodorus considered only a small class of solids, includ-
ing of course the Platonic solids.
Over 2000 years later H. A. Schwarz (1884) apparently gave the ﬁrst
complete proof, by a symmetrization argument. Schwarz symmetrization re-
places slices by parallel hyperplanes in Rn with ▷n  1◁-discs centered on
an orthogonal axis. De Giorgi [2] (1958) gave a simple completion of
an early argument of J. Steiner. Steiner symmetrization replaces slices by
parallel lines with intervals centered on an orthogonal hyperplane. Perhaps
the simplest known proof is based on the divergence theorem [Gromov,
§2.1; Berger 1, 12.11.4]. This result also follows from the Brunn-Minkowski
Theorem [Federer, 3.2.41]. Furthermore, given known existence and regularity,
there is a very simple symmetry proof (see Section 14.3 and [Hutchings,
Corollary 2.8]). For more history, results, and references, see the excellent
review by Burago and Zalgaller (especially §10.4). These isoperimetric results
generalize to norms more general than area [Gromov, §2.1; Morgan 16, §10.6;
Brothers and Morgan].
More General Ambients.
Round balls are known to be minimizing also in
Sn and Hn [Schmidt]. Round balls about the origin are known to be mini-
mizing in certain two-dimensional surfaces of revolution (see the survey by
Howards et al.), in certain n-dimensional cones [Morgan and Ritor´e], and
in Schwarzschild-like spaces by Bray and Morgan, with applications to the
Penrose Inequality in general relativity. [Morgan and Johnson, Theorem 2.2]
show that in any smooth compact Riemannian manifold, minimizers for small
volume are nearly round spheres. There are results on R ð Hn by Hsiang and
Hsiang, on RP3, S1 ð R2, and T2 ð R by Ritor´e and Ros ([2]; [1], [Ritor´e]),
on R ð Sn by Pedrosa, and on S1 ð Rn, S1 ð Sn, and S1 ð Hn by Pedrosa
and Ritor´e. In RP3, the least-area way to enclose a given volume V is: for

128
Geometric Measure Theory
small V, a round ball; for large V, its complement; and for middle-sized V, a
solid torus centered on an equatorial RP1.
Although regularity theory (8.5) admits the possibility of singularities of
codimension 8 in an area-minimizing single bubble, one might well not expect
any. Nevertheless Hsiang (1993) announced an example of a singular bubble
in the Cartesian product H7 ð S7 of hyperbolic space with the round sphere.
Hsiang uses symmetry to reduce it to a question about curves in the plane.
To understand his example, I like to think about the least-perimeter way to
enclose a region of prescribed area A on the cylinder R1 ð S1. For small A,
the solution is a disc, for large A, the solution is an annular band. Both types
occur for a critical value of A, when the minimizer jumps from one type to
the other. If the minimizer were continuous in A, it would have to become
singular to change type. This is what happens in H7 ð S7.
13.3. Cluster Theory.
The existence of soap bubble clusters in Rn (see
Figure 13.3.1) is guaranteed by the following theorem, proved in a more

13.4. Existence
of
Soap
Bubble
Clusters.
In
Rn,
given
volumes
V1, . . . , Vm > 0, there is an area-minimizing cluster of bounded regions Ri
of volume Vi.
To outline a simple proof, we will need a few lemmas. Lemma 13.5, an
extremely useful observation of Almgren’s (see Almgren [1, V1.2(3)] or
Morgan [19, 2.2]), will let us virtually ignore the volume constraints in elim-
inating wild behavior.
13.5. Lemma.
Given any cluster, there exists C > 0, such that arbitrary
small volume adjustments may be accomplished inside various small balls at
a cost
jAj  CjVj
(see Figure 13.5.1).
Remark.
There is much freedom in the placement of the balls. Selecting
two disjoint sets of such balls now will allow later proofs to adjust volumes
at such locations, away from the main argument.
Figure 13.5.1.
Gently pushing R1 into R2 at a typical border point yields a small
volume adjustment with jAj  CjVj.

130
Geometric Measure Theory
Proof Sketch.
By the Gauss–Green–De Giorgi–Federer Theorem, 12.2,
at almost all points of ∂Ri, Ri has a measure-theoretic exterior normal and
the approximate tangent cone is a half-space. Hence at almost every point
of ∂R1, for example, this half-space ﬁts up against that of some other Ri,
say R2. Gently pushing R1 into R2 costs jAj  C12jVj. Combining over
many such neighboring pairs yields an arbitrary small volume adjustment with
jAj  CjVj.
13.6. Lemma.
An area-minimizing cluster is bounded in Rn.
Proof.
Let V▷r◁denote the volume outside B▷0, r◁; let A▷r◁denote the
area outside B▷0, r◁. Truncation at almost any radius r saves A▷r◁, requires
patching by the slice hRi, u, rCi with u▷x◁D jxj and
MhRi, u, rCi  jV0▷r◁j
(4.11(3)), and requires replacing lost volume at a cost of CV▷r◁for large r by
Lemma 13.5. Therefore
▷1◁
jV0▷r◁j C CV▷r◁½ A▷r◁.
On the other hand, application of the isoperimetric inequality, 5.3, to the exte-
rior of B▷0, r◁yields
▷2◁
jV0▷r◁j C A▷r◁½ V▷r◁▷n1◁/n.
Adding inequalities (1) and (2) yields
2jV0▷r◁j ½ CV▷r◁C V▷r◁▷n1◁/n ½ 1
2V▷r◁▷n1◁/n
for large r. If V▷r◁is never 0,
n▷V1/n◁0 D V▷n1◁/nV0  c < 0
for almost all large r, which contradicts positive and nonincreasing V.
13.7. Sketch of Proof of Theorem 13.4.
The main difﬁculty is that volume
can disappear to inﬁnity in the limit. First we show that we can preserve some
fraction of the volume. Let C˛ be a minimizing sequence of clusters with the
prescribed volumes Vi. We claim there are constants S, υ > 0, such that if Rn
is partitioned into cubes Ki of edge length S, then for some Ki,
▷1◁
vol▷R1,˛
Ki◁½ υV1.

Soap Bubble Clusters
131
Indeed choose S large enough so that if vol▷R
Ki◁ V1, then
area▷∂R
Ki◁½  ▷vol▷R
Ki◁◁▷n1◁/n,
for some isoperimetric constant  (12.3(1)). Let υ  /A. Then for each Kj,
area▷∂R1,˛
Kj◁½

max
i ▷R1,˛
Ki◁vol▷R1,˛
Kj◁.
Summing over j yields
A ½

max
i ▷R1,˛
Ki◁V1,
max
i ▷R1,˛
Ki◁½ V1/A ½ υV1,
proving the claim. Therefore, by translating the C˛, we may assume that for
some ﬁxed r > 0,
▷2◁
vol▷R1,˛
B▷0, r◁◁½ υV1.
By a compactness argument (see 9.1), we now may assume that the C˛
converge to a limit cluster C. By (2),
▷3◁
vol▷R1◁½ υV1.
The second step is to show that C is area minimizing for its volume. Other-
wise, a compact improvement of C could be used to improve substantially
the C˛, with only a small volume distortion. The volume distortion could be
corrected by truncation, slight homothetic contraction until no volume is too
big, and the addition of tiny spheres. By Lemma 13.6, C is bounded.
Now if there was no volume loss to inﬁnity, C solves our problem. If
there was a volume loss, repeat the whole process with translations of the
discarded material, obtained as the restriction of the C˛ to the exterior of an
increasing sequence of balls, judiciously chosen to make the required patching
inconsequential. Since each repetition recovers a ﬁxed fraction of missing
volume, countably many repetitions can capture the total volume and yield a
solution. (Since each is bounded, they do ﬁt in Rn). Since the conglomerate
solution must be bounded by Lemma 13.6, we conclude that only ﬁnitely
many repetitions were actually needed.

Regularity results for minimizing clusters begin with the following.

The proof depends on Lemma 13.5, which provides volume adjust-
ments at cost jAj  CjVj. υ must be chosen small enough so that a υ-ball
has small volume in the sense of Lemma 13.5 and so that any υ-ball is disjoint
from a set of balls used to readjust volumes.

In 1976 Jean Taylor gave a deﬁnitive mathematical explanation of the struc-
ture of soap bubble clusters recorded more than a century before by J. Plateau,
based on Fred Almgren’s theory of ▷M, ε, υ◁-minimal sets. A beautiful descrip-
tion of Taylor’s work appears in a Scientiﬁc American article by Taylor and
Almgren, who supervised her Ph.D. thesis. (See also Kanigel.) As another
nice result, Almgren and Taylor were married (see Figure 13.8.1).
13.9. Regularity of Soap Bubble Clusters in R3 [Taylor, 4].
A soap bubble
cluster C in R3 ▷▷M, ε, υ◁-minimal set◁consists of real analytic constant-mean-
curvature surfaces meeting smoothly in threes at 120° angles along smooth
curves, in turn meeting in fours at angles of cos1▷1/3◁³ 109°.
Remark.
The singular curves were proved C1,˛ by Taylor [4]; C1
by Nitsche [1]; and real-analytic by Kinderlehrer, Nirenberg, and Spruck
[Theorem 5.1].
Comments on Proof.
Consider a linear approximation or tangent cone C
at any singularity (which exists by monotonicity and further substantial argu-
ments). By scaling, C is ▷M, ε, υ◁minimal for ε D 0 and υ D 1. C must
intersect the unit sphere in a “net” of geodesic curves meeting in threes at
120°, an extension of the more familiar fact that shortest networks meet only
in threes at 120°. (This angle comes from a balancing condition for equilib-
rium. A junction of four curves could be proﬁtably deformed to two junctions
of three as in Figure 11.3.1). In 1964 Heppes [1], unaware of much earlier
incomplete work of Lamarle (1864), found all ten such geodesic nets, pictured
in Figure 13.9.1. Taylor, adding a ﬁnal case to complete the work of Lamarle,
showed all but the ﬁrst three cones to be unstable by exhibiting area-decreasing
deformations as in Figure 13.9.2. In an ironic twist of fate, in the fourth case,

the comparison surface provided by Taylor has more area than the cone; the
correct comparison surface, which reduces area by pinching out a ﬂat triangular
surface in the center, had been given correctly by Lamarle.
Actually back in 1964, in work not published until 1995, Heppes [2, Lemma
1] had already shown all but the ﬁrst three cones to be unstable. When writing

1995 at a special session on Soap Bubble Geometry in Burlington, Vermont,
organized by the author.

Incidentally, an octahedral frame, whose cone, of course, cannot be in equi-
librium since surfaces meet in fours, bounds at least ﬁve interesting soap ﬁlms
[Isenberg, color plate 4.6]. It is an open question whether the smallest of these
ﬁve is, in fact, the minimizer.
Thus, for the approximating cone, there are just three possibilities, corre-
sponding to a smooth surface or the two asserted types of singularities.
The really hard part is to show that the cone is a good enough approximation
to the original soap ﬁlm. Taylor uses a deep method of Reifenberg [1–3],
requiring the veriﬁcation of a certain “epiperimetric inequality,” which says
roughly that cones near the special three are not too close to being minimizers
themselves.
Of course, where the surface is regular, a classical variational argument
yields constant mean curvature and hence real analyticity.
Boundary Singularities.
Lawlor and Morgan [1] (see also Morgan [18,
Lecture I, Section 11.3, p. 91] and [Sullivan and Morgan, Problem 12])
describe ten conjectured types of smooth boundary singularities of soap ﬁlms,
as in Figure 13.9.3.
13.10. Cluster Regularity in Higher Dimensions.
Almgren [1, Theorem
III.3(7)] proved that soap bubble clusters (▷M, ε, υ◁-minimal sets) in Rn
▷n ½ 3◁are C1,˛ almost everywhere. [White 9] has proved that they consist
of smooth constant-mean-curvature hypersurfaces meeting in threes at 120
degrees along smooth ▷n  2◁-dimensional surfaces, which in turn meet in
fours at equal angles along smooth ▷n  3◁-dimensional surfaces, which meet
in an ▷n  4◁-dimensional set.
Brakke [2] has classiﬁed the polyhedral ▷M, 0, 1◁-minimal cones in R4,
which include the cone over the hypercube. It is conjectured that there are no
non-polyhedral ▷M, 0, 1◁-minimal cones below R8.
For a simple treatment of l-dimensional ▷M, ε, υ◁-minimal sets see
Morgan [7]. (Almgren’s regularity results technically do not apply [Almgren
1, IV.3(1), p. 96].) Taylor’s [4] regularity results go through for soap bubble
clusters in R2. Only in R2 does existence theory provide the alternative option
of requiring that the regions be connected [Morgan 19]; such regions may
bump up against each other.
13.11. Minimizing Surface and Curve Energies.
In some materials, not
only interfacial surfaces but also singular curves may carry energetic costs.
This modiﬁcation alters behavior qualitatively as well as quantitatively, with
four surfaces meeting along a singular curve, for example, as in Figure 13.11.1.

For an equilibrium bubble cluster in
Rn, each region has a pressure pi deﬁned up to a constant (the external
pressure pext), such that the mean curvature of an interface between regions
Ri and Rj is pi  pj. The rate of change of area with respect to volume

CHAPTER 14
Proof of Double Bubble Conjecture
The year 2000 brought an announcement of the proof the Double Bubble
Conjecture in R3 by Hutchings, Morgan, Ritor´e, and Ros. The Double Bubble
Conjecture says that the “standard” familiar double soap bubble of Figure 14.0.1,
consisting of three spherical caps meeting at 120 degrees, provides the least-
perimeter way to enclose two prescribed volumes in R3 (or similarly in Rn).
Long believed (see Plateau [pp. 300–301] and Boys [p. 120]) but not published,
the conjecture ﬁnally appeared in a 1991 undergraduate thesis at Williams
College by Joel Foisy, who realized that no one knew how to prove it, despite
the fact that a minimizer was known to exist and be a surface of revolution.
The 1990 Williams College NSF “SMALL” undergraduate research Geo-
metry Group, including Foisy, proved the Double Bubble Conjecture in R2,
using original geometric arguments and some computation.
In 1995, Joel Hass, Michael Hutchings, and Roger Schlaﬂy announced a
proof of the Double Bubble Conjecture for equal volumes in R3, using new
theoretical tools and extensive computer computations. (See also Morgan [5],
Hass and Schlaﬂy, and Hutchings.)
In 2000, Hutchings, Morgan, Manuel Ritor´e, and Antonio Ros announced
a proof of the Double Bubble Conjecture for arbitrary volumes in R3, using
a new instability argument. (See also Cipra.)
The Williams undergraduate research Geometry Group, consisting of Ben
Reichardt, Cory Heilmann, Yuan Lai, and Anita Spielman, generalized the
result from R3 to R4, and, for the case when the larger volume is more than
twice the smaller, to Rn.
In R5, even the case of equal volumes remains open.

This chapter outlines the latest proofs of the Double Bubble Conjecture
in R3 and Rn. In R3, a major difﬁculty is ruling out a bubble with three
components, as in Figure 14.0.2. The main new idea is to prove such bubbles
unstable by rotating pieces about well-chosen axes (see Proposition 14.15).
14.1. Proposition.
For prescribed volumes v, w, there is a unique standard
double bubble in Rn consisting of three spherical caps meeting at 120 degrees
as in Figure 14.0.1.
The mean curvature H0 of the separating surface is the difference of the
mean curvatures H1, H2 of the outer caps.
Proof.
Consider a unit sphere through the origin and a congruent or smaller
sphere intersecting it at the origin (and elsewhere) at 120 degrees, as in
Figure 14.1.1. There is a unique completion to a standard double bubble.
Varying the size of the smaller sphere yields all volume ratios precisely once.
Scaling yields all pairs of volumes precisely once.
The condition on the curvatures follows by the law of sines (see
Figure 14.1.2) for R2 and hence for Rn. (Plateau presented this ﬁgure for
constructing standard double bubbles.) Since curvature is proportional to

In R3, a major difﬁculty is ruling out a bubble with three compo-
nents. Here one region consists of a central bubble and a thin toroidal tube around
the outside, while the second region consists of a larger toroidal tube in between.

pressure difference, this condition implies that the pressure is well deﬁned
(up to a constant).
14.2. Remark.
Montesinos has proved the existence of a unique standard
k-bubble in Rn for k  n C 1. (See also Sullivan and Morgan.)
The following symmetry theorem is based on an idea of Brian White,
written up by Foisy [Theorem 3.4] and Hutchings [Theorem 2.6]. Inciden-
tally, the same argument shows that an area-minimizing single bubble is a
round sphere.
14.3. Theorem.
An area-minimizing double bubble in Rn is a hypersurface
of revolution about a line.
Proof sketch (for details see the beautiful proof of Hutchings).
In R2, the
standard double bubble, which is symmetric about a line, is known to be the
unique minimizer (Foisy et al.). First, we’ll show in R3 that a symmetrized
minimizer is symmetric about a line. Second, we’ll consider Rn. Third, we’ll
show that every minimizer is symmetric about a line.

Proof of Double Bubble Conjecture
145
First, to obtain a symmetrized minimizer, start with any minimizing double
bubble in R3. We claim that there are two orthogonal planes that split both
volumes in half. Certainly, for every 0    , there is a vertical plane at
angle  to the xz-plane, which splits the ﬁrst region in half. These planes can
be chosen to vary continuously back to the original position, now with the
larger part of the second region on the other side. Hence for some intermediate
, the plane splits both volumes in half. Turning everything to make this plane
horizontal and repeating the argument yield a second plane, as desired. (The
Borsuk-Ulam theorem, as applied to prove the ham sandwich theorem, gives a
direct proof. See e.g. Munkres, Theorem 68.6, p. 405.) Hence we may assume
that the xz- and yz-planes bisect both volumes.
Reﬂecting the quadrant of least area now yields a symmetrized bubble B
of no more (hence equal) area, symmetric under reﬂection across both planes
and hence under their composition, rotation by 180 degrees about the z-axis.
Hence every plane containing the z-axis splits both volumes in half.
We claim that at every regular point, the bubble B is orthogonal to the
vertical plane. Otherwise the smaller or equal half of B, together with its
reﬂection, would be a minimizer with an illegal singularity (which could be
smoothed to reduce area while maintaining volume). Now it follows that B is
a surface of revolution.
Second, in Rn, one analogously ﬁnds n  1 orthogonal hyperplanes H1,
. . . , Hn1 of reﬂective symmetry, symmetrizes, deduces rotational symmetry
about the intersection Hi \ Hj of any two hyperplanes, and concludes rota-
tional symmetry about their common intersection L D \ Hi.
Third, suppose there is some minimizer B in Rn which is not symmetric
about the line L D \ Hi. Then it is not symmetric about some Hi \ Hj, say
H1 \ H2. By the following Lemma 14.4, the part of B on one side of H1 and
its reﬂection, together called B0, is not symmetric about H1 \ H2. Likewise
the part of B0 on one side of H2 and its reﬂection, together called B00, is not
symmetric about H1 \ H2. But B00 is symmetric with respect to both H1 and
H2, and hence is symmetric with respect to H1 \ H2 by the ﬁrst part of this
proof, the desired contradiction.
14.4. Lemma.
Suppose that both regions of a minimizing double bubble B
in Rn▷n ½ 3◁are split in half by a hyperplane H. Let B1, B2 be the halves
together with their reﬂections. If each Bi is symmetric about an ▷n  2◁-plane
Pi in H, then they are both symmetric about P1 (indeed, about P1 \ P2).
Proof sketch.
It sufﬁces to show that at every regular point of B2, the
tangent plane contains the direction of rotation about P1 \ P2. By symmetry,
almost every point p of B \ H  P1  P2 is a regular point of B1, B2, and B

146
Geometric Measure Theory
(since a singular point yields a whole singular orbit). By analytic continuation,
in a neighborhood of p, the tangent plane contains the directions of rotation
about P1 \ P2. By symmetry, this holds almost everywhere in B2, except
possibly at points where B2 is locally contained in the orbit of P1  P2. By
the symmetry of B2, such a piece of surface would continue down to H, where
the symmetry of B1 shows that as a piece of B it does not separate distinct
regions, a contradiction.
14.5. Concavity (Hutchings Theorem 3.2).
The least area A▷v, w◁of a
double bubble of volumes v, w in Rn is a strictly concave function. In particular,
A▷v, w◁is increasing in each variable.
Proof sketch.
To illustrate the idea of the proof for the interesting case
n D 3, we will just prove that for ﬁxed w0, A▷v, w0◁is nondecreasing, which
sufﬁces to prove Corollary 14.6. If not, then there is a local minimum at some
v0. For simplicity, we treat just the case of a strict local minimum. Consider
a minimizing double bubble B of volumes v0, w0. By Theorem 14.3 and its
proof, B is a surface of revolution about a line L D P1 \ P2, where P1 and
P2 are planes that divide both regions in half. Choose a plane P3 near P2
which divides the second region in half but does not contain L. We claim that
it divides the ﬁrst region in half. Otherwise, the half with smaller (or equal)
area, reﬂected across the plane, would yield a bubble of no more area and
slightly different volume, contradicting the assumption that v0 is a strict local
minimum. Therefore P3 splits both volumes in half. Now as in the proof of
Theorem 14.3, B is symmetric about the line L0 D P1 \ P3 as well as about L.
It follows that B consists of concentric spheres, which is impossible. Therefore
A▷v, w0◁must be nondecreasing as desired.
14.6. Corollary
(Hutchings
Theorem 3.4).
An area-minimizing double
bubble in Rn has connected exterior.
Proof.
If the exterior has a second, bounded, component, removing a
surface to make it part of one of the two regions would reduce area and
increase volume, in contradiction to A▷v, w◁increasing.
14.7. Corollary (Hutchings Theorem 3.5).
If the larger region of a mini-
mizing double bubble has more than twice the volume of the smaller region, it
is connected.
Proof.
If not, create a new double bubble by calling the smallest compo-
nent of the ﬁrst region part of the second region. Of course total volume

v0 C w0 D v C w does not change and area does not increase. Each region now
has volume greater than w, so that ▷v0, w0◁is a convex combination of ▷v, w◁
and ▷w, v◁. By Concavity 14.5, area must increase, a contradiction.
14.8. Decomposition Lemma (Cox et al. [2], Hutchings Lemma 4.1).
Consider a minimizing double bubble of volumes v, w in Rn. If the ﬁrst region
has a component of volume x > 0, then
2A▷v, w◁½ A▷v  x, w◁C A▷x◁C A▷v  x, w C x◁,

that each piece of surface on the left appears twice on the right.

14.10. Hutchings Structure Theorem (Hutchings Theorem 5.1).
An area-
minimizing double bubble in Rn is either the standard double bubble or another
surface of revolution about some line, consisting of a topological sphere with a
tree of annular bands (smoothly) attached, as in Figure 14.10.1. The two caps
are pieces of round spheres, and the root of the tree has just one branch. The
surfaces are all constant-mean-curvature surfaces of revolution, “Delaunay
surfaces,” meeting in threes at 120 degrees.
Proof sketch.
Regularity, including the 120-degree angles, comes from
applying planar regularity theory [Morgan 19] to the generating curves;
also the curves must intersect the axis perpendicularly. The bubble must

be connected, or moving components could create illegal singularities (or
alternatively an asymmetric minimizer). By comparison with spheres centered
on the axis and vertical hyperplanes, pieces of surface meeting the axis must
be such spheres or hyperplanes. We claim that the number of such pieces
is two (or three for the standard double bubble). If it were 0, an argument
given by [Foisy, Theorem 3.6] shows that the bubble could be improved
by a volume-preserving contraction toward the axis (r ! ▷rn1  ε◁1/▷n1◁).
If it were 1, that piece of surface would not be separating any regions. If
it were more than 2, some piece separates the two regions and eventually
branches into two surfaces S1 and S2, as in Figure 14.10.2. We claim that S1
and S2 must be spherical. If, for example, S1 were not spherical, replacing
it by a spherical piece enclosing the same volume (possibly extending a
different distance horizontally) would decrease area, as follows from the area-
minimizing property of the sphere. Since everything else can be rolled around
S1 or S2 without creating any illegal singularities, they must be spheres and
the bubble must be the standard double bubble. The structure theorem now
follows, since the only possible structures are bubbles of one region in the
boundary of the other. The same rolling argument implies that the root of the
tree has just one branch.
The Hutchings Basic Estimate 14.9 also has the following corollary.
14.11. Corollary.
Let QA▷v, w◁be the area of the standard double bubble in
Rn of volumes v, w, or any other upper bound on the minimum double bubble
area. Consider a minimizing double bubble of volumes v, 1  v. Then the ﬁrst
region has at most k components, where
A▷v◁k1/n D 2QA▷v, 1  v◁ A▷1◁ A▷1  v◁.

Let x be the volume of the smallest component of the ﬁrst region,
so that the number of components is bounded by k D v/x. Since, of course, the

in R2 both regions are connected, from which the Double Bubble Conjecture
in R2 follows easily (as in Proposition 22 of Foisy et al.). The Rn bounds are

plot of Figure 14.11.1. Unfortunately, obtaining useful bounds on the deriva-
tive of the plotted functions seems difﬁcult as well as ugly. For R3, Hutchings
et al. use a simple, weaker, convex bound to prove the larger region connected;
of course for a convex bound it is enough to check the endpoints. To prove
that the smaller region has at most two components, they use a completely
different auxiliary instability argument. For R4 (and incidentally R3), Heil-
mann et al. [1] develop a piecewise convex bound to cover all volumes.
Ultimately Reichardt et al. do not need any such bounds, because they gener-
alize the main instability argument of Hutchings et al. to any number of
components for the smaller region (as long as the larger region is connected).
The following conjecture [Heilmann et al. 1, Conj. 4.10] would perhaps
provide the most elegant way to prove the bounds rigorously. I hereby renew
the $200 offer of my Math Chat column (at www.maa.org) of October 7, 1999
for the ﬁrst proof.
14.14. Conjecture.
In Rn, let H0, H1, H2, respectively, denote the mean
curvature of a sphere of volume w, a sphere of volume w C 1, and the exte-
rior of the second region of the standard double bubble of volumes 1, w, as
suggested by Figure 14.14.1. Then
2H2 > H0 C H1.
Remark.
Since the derivatives of the terms of 14.12(1) are proportional to the
mean curvatures (see Morgan [16]), Conjecture 14.14 implies that the associated
function k of 14.11 and 14.12 is increasing in w and hence decreasing in v.
Proposition 14.15 contains the main idea of the proof of the Double Bubble
Conjecture in R3. The existence of points pi where certain rotational eigen-
functions vanish implies instability (unless associated surfaces are all spheres
and hyperplanes, which will be shown to be impossible). This idea goes back to
the Courant Nodal Domain Theorem, which relates the divisions of a domain

ment shows that each ui vanishes. It follows that S is spherical or planar as
asserted.
14.16. Corollary.
There is no nonstandard minimizing double bubble in Rn
in which both regions and the exterior are connected, as in Figure 14.16.1.
Proof.
The line equidistant from the two vertices intersects the axis L
in a point p (unless the line is horizontal, which we will consider next).
Hence 1 and 2 each has an interior point farthest from or closest to p, so
that p 2 f▷1◁\ f▷2◁. By Proposition 14.15, 1 and 2 are both spherical,
which is impossible.
If the line is horizontal, 1 and 2 each has an interior point farthest left or
right, so that 1 2 f▷1◁\ f▷2◁. By Proposition 14.15, 1 and 2 are both
vertical, which is impossible.
14.17. Corollary.
Consider a minimizing double bubble in Rn of three com-
ponents and connected exterior as in Figure 14.17.1. Then there is no x 2 R
such that f1▷x◁ 0 contains points in the interiors of distinct j which
separate .
Proof.
If so, there must be points in 1, 2, or 3. By Proposition 14.15,
one of them is spherical. By so-called “force balancing” (Korevaar, Kusner,

and Solomon), when two spherical pieces met, the third piece is also spherical.
Therefore 1, 2, and 3 are all spherical. But since 2 bounds a region of
positive pressure by Concavity 14.5 and hence 2 curves to the right from its
vertex with 1, therefore 1 and 2 cannot both be spherical.
14.18. Proposition (Hutchings et al. Proposition 5.8).
There is no mini-
mizing double bubble in Rn in which the region of smaller or equal pressure is
connected, the other region has two components, and the exterior is connected,
as in Figure 14.17.1.
Remarks on proof.
Corollary 14.17 reduces this to plane geometry, aided
by a few simple facts about surfaces of Delaunay. Finding the separating
set of points requires consideration of a number of cases, as suggested by
Figure 14.18.1.
14.19. Proposition.
In a minimizing double bubble in Rn, the smaller region
has larger pressure.
Proof.
Consider the function A▷v, 1  v◁giving the least area enclosing
and separating regions of volume v, 1  v. By Concavity 14.5, A is strictly
concave and of course symmetric about v D 1/2. Since one way to obtain
nearby ▷v, 1  v◁is to vary the separating surface of mean curvature say H,
with dA/dv D 2H, the left and right derivatives of A must satisfy
A0
R  2H  A0
L.
Consequently H is positive for v < 1/2 and negative for v > 1/2. In other
words, the smaller region has larger pressure.
14.20. Theorem (Hutchings et al. Theorem 7.1).
The standard double
bubble in R3 is the unique area-minimizing double bubble for prescribed
volumes.

Proof.
Let B be an area-minimizing double bubble. By Corollary 14.11 and
Proposition 14.19, either both regions are connected, or one of larger volume and
smaller pressure is connected and the other of smaller volume and larger pres-
sure has two components. By the Hutchings Structure Theorem 14.10, B is either
as in Figure 14.16.1 or as in Figure 14.17.1. By 14.16 and 14.18, B must be the
standard double bubble.
Remark.
Although the ﬁnal competitors are proved unstable, earlier steps
such as symmetry (14.3) assume area minimization. It remains conjectural
whether the standard double bubble is the unique stable double bubble.
To obtain results in higher dimension, Reichardt et al. generalized Propo-
sition 14.18 to Proposition 14.21. Since there is no bound on the number of
components of the second region, the case-by-case analysis of Figure 14.18.1
must be broken down into more general arguments about constitutive parts,
with the help of new ideas.
14.21. Proposition (Reichardt et al.).
A minimizing double bubble in which
the larger or equal region is connected must be the standard double bubble.
14.22. Corollary (Reichardt et al.).
In R4, the standard double bubble is the
unique minimizer. In Rn, for prescribed volumes v > 2w, the standard double
bubble is the unique minimizer.

156
Geometric Measure Theory
Proof.
By 14.7 and 14.11, the larger (or equal) region is connected. By
Proposition 14.21, a minimizer must be the standard double bubble.
14.23. Open Questions.
It is conjectured by Hutchings et al. that the stan-
dard double bubble in Rn is the unique stable double bubble. Sullivan [Sullivan
and Morgan, Proposition 2] has conjectured that the standard k-bubble in Rn
(k  n C 1◁is the unique minimizer enclosing k regions of prescribed volume.
This remains open even for the triple bubble in R2, although Cox et al. have
proved it minimizing in a category of bubbles with connected regions (see
Section 13.1).
One could consider the Double Bubble Conjecture in hyperbolic space Hn
or in the round sphere Sn. The symmetry and concavity results still hold
[Hutchings, 3.8–3.10]. The case of S2 was proved by J. Masters.

CHAPTER 15
The Hexagonal Honeycomb and Kelvin
Conjectures
The Hexagonal Honeycomb Conjecture says that regular hexagons as in
Figure 15.0.1 provide the most efﬁcient (least-perimeter) way to divide the
plane into unit areas. A proof was announced by Thomas Hales of the Univer-
sity of Michigan in 1999, the same Hales who recently proved the 1611 Kepler
sphere-packing conjecture (see also Peterson [2], Klarreich, and Notices AMS
47(2000), 440–449).
The Kelvin Conjecture describes a candidate for the least-perimeter way
to divide three-space into unit volumes. A counterexample was announced
by Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan of Trinity College, Dublin, in 1994 (see
also Peterson [1] and Klarreich). Whether their counterexample is optimal
remains open.

15.1. Hexagonal Honeycomb History.
Since antiquity philosophers and
honeybees have regarded hexagons as the ideal way to partition the plane into
equal areas, as in the honeycomb of Figures 15.1.1 and 15.1.2. Around 36 BC
Marcus Terentius Varro, in his book On Agriculture [III, xvi.5], wrote about
the bees’ honeycomb, “The geometricians prove that this hexagon . . . encloses
the greatest amount of space.” Zenodorus (¾200 BC) had proved the regular
hexagon superior to any other hexagon, triangle, or parallelogram [Heath,
pp. 206–212].
The next major advance came in 1953, when L. Fejes T´oth ([2, Chapter III,
§9, p. 84] or [3, Corollary Section 26, p. 183] after [4]; see also [1] or [3,
Section 29, pp. 206–208] on “wet ﬁlms”) used a simple convexity argument
Figure 15.1.1.
The bees’ honeycomb illustrates the efﬁciency of using hexagons to
enclose equal spaces with the least partitioning. From T. Rayment, A cluster of bees

to prove regular hexagons superior in the very restricted category of convex (or
polygonal) regions, modulo a truncation argument as in our Proposition 15.3.
Many mathematicians came to have the erroneous impression that the problem
was solved (see e.g. [Weyl, p. 85]).
Finally in 1999, Hales announced a proof in the category of connected
regions.
When I arrived at St. John’s University to give a talk on this topic, I was
greeted by the church of Figure 15.1.3.
A difﬁculty with the honeycomb and its symmetry was pointed out in 1994
by Gary Larson (Figure 15.1.4).

15.2. Deﬁnition of Clusters in R2.
We will deﬁne a cluster C in R2 as
a smooth, locally ﬁnite graph, with each face included in a unique region
(nonempty union of faces) Ri or the exterior. We will usually assume that each
Ri is connected (consists of a single face). For inﬁnite clusters, we consider
the perimeter P▷r◁and area A▷r◁inside the ball B▷0, r◁. The truncated cluster
C0▷r◁consists of the n▷r◁regions completely contained inside the ball B▷0, r◁,
with perimeter P0▷r◁and area A0▷r◁.
15.3. The Truncation Lemma (Morgan [8, proof of Theorem. 2.1]).
Let C
be a cluster of connected regions of area at most 1 in R2. Then

For almost all r, P0▷r◁exists and bounds the number of points where
cluster boundaries meet the circle S▷0, r◁, by the co-area formula 3.13 applied
to the function f▷w◁D r. Given ε > 0, r0 > 0, we can choose r ½ r0 such
that P0▷r◁< εA▷r◁. Otherwise, for almost all r ½ r1 ½ r0,
P0 ½ εA > ε

Since P is nondecreasing, for large r,
P▷r◁½ P▷r1◁e▷ε/2◁▷rr1◁> 2r2,
which implies that A▷r◁> r2, a contradiction.
Therefore in forming the truncated cluster C0 from the restriction of C to

as desired.
The following inequality is the central idea of Hales’s proof. Its penalty
terms for bulging outward and for using more than six edges make the hexagon
superior to the circle.
15.4. Hexagonal Isoperimetric Inequality (Hales Theorem 4).
Consider
a curvilinear planar polygon of N edges, area A at least 3.6/N2, and
perimeter P. Let P0 denote the perimeter of a regular hexagon of area 1. For
each edge, let ai denote how much more area is enclosed than by a straight
line, truncated so that –1/2  ai  1/2. Then

hexagon of unit area.
Remark.
The truncation in the deﬁnition of ai is necessary to prevent
counterexamples as in Figure 15.4.1.
Figure 15.4.1.
Without truncation in the deﬁnition of the ai, this would be a coun-
terexample to (1) [Hales].
Proof sketch.
It is convenient to work in the larger category of immersed
curvilinear polygons, counting area with multiplicity and sign. Then one
may assume that all the edges are circular arcs (or straight lines). Without
the truncation condition, one could further assume that all the edges have
the same curvature, since moving to that condition at constant net area
decreases perimeter. With the truncation condition, the reductions are a little
more complicated. Let xi denote the excess area enclosed by an edge (in
comparison with a straight line, before truncation, so that, for example,
jaij D minfjxij, 1/2g). We may assume that all xi 2 ▷1/2, 1/2◁have the same
curvature, and that all xi 2 [1/2, 1/2] have the same sign. We may assume
that each xi ½ 1/2, since increasing it to 1/2 decreases perimeter, leaves
truncated area ai at 1/2, and increases total area. Hales now treats separately
two cases:
Case I: some xi > 1/2,
Case II: every jxij  1/2.
The proofs use ﬁve lower bounds on perimeter:
▷LN◁The perimeter of the N-gon determined by the N vertices is at least as
great as the perimeter LN of the regular N-gon of the same area.
▷LC◁“Standard isoperimetric inequality.” The perimeter is at least the
perimeter LC of a circle of area A, namely 2
p
A.
▷L◁The ﬁgure obtained by reﬂecting each edge across its chord has at least
as much perimeter as a circle of the same area.

The Hexagonal Honeycomb and Kelvin Conjectures
163
▷LD◁“Dido’s inequality.” Each edge is at least as long as a semicircle
enclosing the same area xi.
▷L0
N◁If all the chords have length at most 1 and jxij  /8, then the
perimeter is at least LN times the length of a circular arc of chord 1
enclosing area jxij/LN. For example when xi D 0, L0
N D LN.
This last estimate is new, applying LN to the original ﬁgure. It follows imme-
diately from the Chordal Isoperimetric Inequality 15.5 below.
Before treating Cases I and II, Hales treats the easy case of digons ▷N D 2◁,
which uses nothing more than the standard isoperimetric inequality LC.
Case I also is easy, using LC, LD, and a construction that reﬂects the edges
enclosing negative area.
Case II is more delicate, using LC for xi very positive, L or LD for xi
very negative, and LN in between. For N ½ 100, LC and LD alone sufﬁce. The
subcases N D 6 or N D 7, xi ³ 0, require special attention and L0

Chordal Isoperimetric Inequality.
15.5. Chordal Isoperimetric Inequality (Hales Proposition 6.1).
Consider
an immersed curvilinear polygon as in Figure 15.5.1 of length L, net excess
area X over the chordal polygon, jXj  /8, and each chord length at most 1.
Let L0 be the length of the chordal polygon. Then the length L is at least L0
times the length arc▷jXj/L0◁of a circular arc of chord 1 enclosing area jXj/L0.
The function L0arc▷jXj/L0◁is increasing in L0.
Remark.
The constant /8 can probably be improved a bit. For L0 ½ 2
the sharp bound is /4. Of course if L0  1, no bound on X is necessary.
Proof (a simpliﬁcation of Hales’s original proof).
We may assume that
each edge is a circular arc. Since the derivative of arc▷x◁is just the curvature of
the arc, arc▷x◁is convex up to a semicircle with x D /8, as in Figure 15.5.2.
Once we reduce to arcs at most semicircles, we’ll deduce the lemma by
convexity.
We may assume that each excess area xi has the same sign, by moving two
with opposite signs closer to 0, without changing X, reducing length, until one
is 0. We may assume that X ½ 0.
We now consider the less constrained problem of enclosing area X by arcs
above chords on the x-axis of length at most 1 and total chord length L0. The
minimizer consists of circular arcs. To be in equilibrium, they must have the
same curvature, because curvature is the rate of change of length with respect
to area.
It pays to lengthen chords of (equal or) higher arcs, since moving a tiny
subarc from the middle of a lower arc to the middle of a higher arc would

leave L0 ﬁxed and increase X. Now reducing the area under the lower arc
to restore X reduces length. (This simplifying argument was suggested by
Stewart Johnson.)
Hence if L0  1, a minimizer is a single arc on chord L0, and its length
L0arc▷jXj/L02◁½ L0arc▷jXj/L0◁,
as desired.
On the other hand if L0 ½ 1, a minimizer consists of m ½ 1 arcs over chords
of length Li D 1 and one arc over a chord of length 0  LmC1 < 1. The length
of each arc is Liarc▷xi/Li2◁.
Since by hypothesis X  /8, none of the arcs over unit chords is greater
than a semicircle, and hence a lower arc of the same curvature cannot be
greater than a semicircle. Hence we are in the convex range of arc. Since each
Li  1, the total length
Liarc▷xi/Li
2◁½ Liarc▷xi/Li◁½ L0arc▷X/L0◁
by convexity, as desired.
Finally we show that L0arc▷jXj/L0◁is increasing, or equivalently that
arc▷x◁/x is decreasing, or equivalently that arc0▷x◁< arc▷x◁/x. Since arc▷x◁
is convex for 0  x  /8 and concave for /8  x as in Figure 15.5.2, it

The length arc▷x◁of a circular arc enclosing area x with a unit chord

15.6. Proposition (Hales Theorem 2).
Let C be a cluster of n regions of area
at most 1 in R2. Then the ratio of perimeter to area is greater than the ratio of
perimeter to area for the unit regular hexagonal tiling.
Proof.
More generally, without assuming that each area Ai  1, we bound
the ratio of perimeter to minfAi, 1g. By considering connected components,
we may assume that the regions are connected. To obtain a contradiction, take
a counterexample to minimize the number of (connected) regions. We may
assume n ½ 2, since the perimeter to area ratio for a circle of unit area is
greater than the ratio for the hexagonal tiling, which is half the ratio for a
regular hexagon.
By trivial modiﬁcations we may always assume that C is a smooth
connected graph with no loops, all vertices of degree at least three, and simply
connected faces. We may assume that C is simply connected by incorporating
any bounded components of the exterior into the regions of C by removing
edges. Each region with say N edges must have area at least 2/N2p
3, or
removing its longest edge would yield a counterexample with fewer regions

166
Geometric Measure Theory
(for details, see Hales Remark 2.6). If for the moment we think of C as lying
on a sphere, then the number of vertices, edges, and regions satisfy
2 D v  e C n
▷including the exterior◁.
Each region with N edges contributes at most N/3 to v and exactly N/2 to
e, because, for example, each edge bounds two regions (or possibly the same
region twice). Therefore

▷including the exterior◁.
If we remove the contribution of the exterior region, we have
1  ▷1  N/6◁
▷C, without the exterior◁.
Hence if we sum the Hexagonal Isoperimetric Inequality 15.4(1) over all
regions, the sum of the c▷N  6◁terms is positive. The sum of the ai terms
from interior edges is 0, because the two regions sharing an edge make oppo-
site contributions. The length Pi of each interior edge contributes twice to the
sum of the perimeters. Therefore summing (1) yields the proposition except
for two discrepancies: the favorable undercounting of exterior perimeter Pi
and the possibly unfavorable contribution of any exterior .5ai > 0. But by

The bees actually have a more complicated,
three-dimensional problem involving how the ends of the hexagonal cells are
shaped to interlock with the ends of the cells on the other side. L. Fejes T´oth

be accomplished by partitions of the plane. Figure 15.9.1 suggests two other

candidate minimizers for two equally likely prescribed areas (k D 2, A1 >

does better approximately for .117 < A2/A1 < .206, while Figure 15.9.1b does
better approximately for A2/A1 < .039. Figure 15.9.1c never does better.
15.10. Kelvin Conjecture Disproved by Weaire and Phelan.
1994 brought
striking news of the disproof of Lord Kelvin’s 100-year-old conjecture by
Denis Weaire and Robert Phelan of Trinity College, Dublin. Kelvin sought the
least-area way to partition all of space into regions of unit volumes. (Since
the total area is inﬁnite, least area is interpreted to mean that there is no
area-reducing alteration of compact support preserving the unit volumes.) His
basic building block was a truncated octahedron, with its six square faces
of truncation and eight remaining hexagonal faces, which packs perfectly to
ﬁll space as suggested by Figure 15.10.1. (The regular dodecahedron, with
its twelve pentagonal faces, has less area, but it does not pack.) The whole
structure relaxes slightly into a curvy equilibrium, which is Kelvin’s candidate.
All regions are congruent.
Kelvin loved this shape, constructed models, and exhibited stereoscopic
images as in Figure 15.10.2.
Weaire and Phelan recruited a crystal structure from certain chemical
“clathrate” compounds, which uses two different building blocks: the
regular dodecahedron and a tetrakaidecahedron with 12 pentagonal faces and
Figure 15.10.1.
Lord Kelvin conjectured that the least-area way to partition space
into unit volumes uses relaxed truncated octahedra. Graphics by Ken Brakke in his
Surface Evolver from Brakke’s early report [5].

2 hexagonal faces. The tetrakaidecahedra are arranged in three orthogonal
stacks, stacked along the hexagonal faces, as in Figure 15.10.3. The remaining
holes are ﬁlled by dodecahedra. Again, the structure is allowed to relax into a
stable equilibrium. Computation in the Brakke Evolver shows an improvement
over Kelvin’s conjecture of about 0.3%. The rigorous proof, by Kusner and
Sullivan [1], with further details by Almgren et al., proves only about 0.01%.

Given a center, the corresponding polyhedral region is just the “Voronoi cell”
of all points closer to the given center than to any other center. The relaxation
process also needs to slightly adjust the volumes to make them all 1.
Weaire and Phelan thus provided a new conjectured minimizer. Weaire’s
popular account in New Scientist gives further pictures and details (see also
Klarreich). Don’t miss the pictures of Kelvin, Weaire, and Phelan in Discover
Magazine’s comic-book version by Larry Gonick.
15.11. Higher Dimensions.
Kelvin’s truncated octahedron is actually a
scaled “permutohedron,” the convex hull of the 24 permutations of (1, 2, 3, 4) in
R3 D fx 2 R4: xi D 10g. Likewise the regular hexagon is the permutohedron
in R2 D fx 2 R3: xi D 6g. Will permutohedra turn out to relax into optimal
partitions in higher dimensions? To the contrary, John M. Sullivan (personal
communication, 1999) conjectures that the least-area partitioning of R4 into
unit volumes is given by what Coxeter [Chapter VIII] calls the regular
honeycomb f3, 4, 3, 3g, with octaplex cells f3, 4, 3g, each with 24 octahedral
faces. Intriguingly enough, this polyhedral foam has no need of relaxation. Its
surfaces and lines all meet at the ideal angles. Likewise in R8, there is such a
candidate based on the so-called E8 lattice. See Conway and Sloane.
15.12. How the Weaire-Phelan Counterexample to the Kelvin Conjecture
Could Have Been Found Earlier.
The clathrate compounds that inspired
Weaire and Phelan had just three years earlier inspired counterexamples by
Tibor Tarnai to related conjectures on the optimal way to cover a sphere with
discs (see Stewart).
K. Brakke spent hours at his father’s old desk seeking counterexamples.
Had he reached up and pulled down his father’s copy of Linus Pauling’s
classic, The Nature of the Chemical Bond, it would doubtless have fallen open
to the illustration, in the clathrate compound section, of the chlorine hydrate
crystal, essentially the Weaire-Phelan counterexample!

The Hexagonal Honeycomb and Kelvin Conjectures

R. Williams, after spending years seeking a Kelvin counterexample, ﬁnally
gave up and later published a well-illustrated The Geometrical Foundation of
Natural Structure: A Source Book of Design. In his Figure 5.22, he pictured
the Weaire-Phelan counterexample without realizing it. Of course, it would
have been hard to check without Brakke’s Surface Evolver.
15.13. Conjectures and Proofs.
Optimal partitioning, as described in this
chapter, is much harder than optimal packing or covering. Hales’s proof for
the hexagonal honeycomb in R2 did not come until 1999. Will the new Weaire-
Phelan candidate for R3 take another century to prove?

15.1. The perimeter of a ﬁnite cluster equals half the sum of the perimeters of the
regions and the perimeter of their union. Moreover, the perimeter of a region is
at least the perimeter of a round disc of the same area. Use these two facts to
give a short proof of Proposition 15.6 for n  398.

CHAPTER 16
Immiscible Fluids and Crystals
16.1. Immiscible Fluids.
Clusters of immiscible ﬂuids F1, . . . , Fm (with
ambient F0) such as oil, water, and mercury in air tend to minimize an energy
proportional to surface area, where now the constant of proportionality aij > 0
depends on which ﬂuids the surface separates. We might as well assume
triangle inequalities aik  aij C ajk, since otherwise an interface between Fi
and Fk could proﬁtably be replaced by a thin layer of Fj.
16.2. Existence of Minimizing Fluid Clusters.
The existence of least-
energy clusters of immiscible ﬂuids in Rn follows as for soap bubble
clusters (13.4). Technically it is very convenient to use ﬂat chains with “ﬂuid”
rather than integer coefﬁcients, after Fleming [1], White [2], and Morgan [9]
so that, for example, the superposition of an oil-water interface and a water-
mercury interface is automatically an oil-mercury interface.
16.3. Regularity of Minimizing Fluid Clusters.
Now suppose strict
triangle inequalities hold. White [6; 2, Section 11] has announced that
minimizing
ﬂuid
clusters
consist
of
smooth
constant-mean-curvature
hypersurfaces meeting along a singular set of Hausdorff dimension at most
n  2. A form of monotonicity holds [Morgan 9, Section 3.2]. G. Leonardi
has proved that if two ﬂuids occupy most of a ball in a minimizer, then they
occupy all of a smaller ball.
The structure of the singularities is not as well understood as for soap
bubble clusters. In planar singularities, many circular arcs can meet at an
173

174
Geometric Measure Theory
isolated point. A conjecture on the classiﬁcation of energy-minimizing cones
in R2 was recently proved for up to ﬁve ﬂuids and disproved for six by the
Williams College NSF “SMALL” undergraduate research Geometry Group
[Futer et al.].
Examples of energy-minimizing cones in R3 include cones over the edges
of any tetrahedron, a regular polygonal prism, the regular octahedron, the
regular dodecahedron, the regular icosahedron, and the cube; if, however, you
move just one vertex of the cube, the cone is not minimizing for any choice
of weights aij (Morgan, unpublished). It is an open question whether every
combinatorial type of polyhedron occurs as an energy-minimizing cone.
16.4. Crystals (see Taylor [2], Feynman, Morgan [16, Chapter 10]).
Clus-
ters of crystals C1, . . . , Cm tend to minimize an energy that depends on
direction as well as the pair of crystals separated, an energy given by norms
ij (cf. 12.5), sometimes assumed to be even so that ij▷v◁D ij▷v◁.
Figure 16.4.1.
Crystal shapes typically have ﬁnitely many ﬂat facets corresponding to
surface orientations of low energy. (The ﬁrst two photographs are from Steve Smale’s
Beautiful Crystals Calendar. The third photograph is from E. Brieskorn. All three
appear in The Parsimonious Universe by S. Hildebrandt and A. Tromba [pp. 263–264]
and in Morgan [16, Figure 10.1].)

Immiscible Fluids and Crystals
175
For a single crystal of prescribed volume, the unique energy minimizer is the
well-known Wulff shape (ball in dual norm; see Morgan [16, Chapter 10] and
references therein). Typically the norm is not smooth, certain directions are
much cheaper than others, and the Wulff shape is a polytope, like the crystals
of Figure 16.4.1. For salt, horizontal and vertical axis-plane directions are
cheap and the Wulff shape is a cube.
If the energy functional is lower-semicontinuous, then the existence of least-
energy clusters of crystals in Rn follows as for soap bubble clusters (13.4).
Ambrosio and Braides [Example 2.6] (see Morgan [10]) show that the triangle
inequalities ik  ij C jk do not sufﬁce to imply lower-semicontinuity.
There are no general regularity or monotonicity results. For the case when
the ij are multiples aijof a ﬁxed norm, Leonardi [Remark 4.7] has proved
that almost every point in the surface has a neighborhood in which the surface
is a minimizing interface between two regions (for ﬁxed volumes).
16.5. Planar Double Crystals of Salt.
For the case of double crystals of
salt in R2, Morgan, French, and Greenleaf proved that three types of mini-
mizers occur, as in Figure 16.5.1. (Here the energy norm is given by ▷x, y◁D
jxj C jyj, so that horizontal and vertical directions are cheap.) Electron micro-
scope photographs of table salt crystals in Figure 16.5.2 show similar shapes.
Undergraduates Wecht, Barber, and Tice considered a reﬁned model in which
the interface cost is some fraction  of the external boundary cost. They
found the same three types (with different dimensions), except that when
  0 ³ .56, the minimizer jumps directly from Type I to Type III (as shown
in Figure 16.5.3).

Physical rods or membranes may tend
to minimize nonlinear elastic energies such as the Willmore energy

(where H is the mean curvature). In 1965 [Willmore, Section 7.2] showed
that the round sphere minimizes this energy. The Willmore Conjecture says

that among tori, a standard “Clifford” torus of revolution (with circular cross-
section) minimizes energy. L. Simon [2] proved existence and regularity for
a minimizing torus.
Kusner and Sullivan [2] studied a modiﬁed electrostatic energy on knots
and links and provided stereoscopic pictures of (nonrigorously) computed
minimizers.
16.7. Flows and Crystal Growth.
Energy minimization guides not only
equilibrium shapes but also dynamical processes such as crystal growth. Length
or area minimization gives rise to ﬂows in the direction and magnitude of
the curvature. Matt Grayson proved that a smooth Jordan curve in a closed
surface ﬂows by curvature to a round point or a geodesic. Gerhard Huisken
proved that a smooth uniformly convex hypersurface in Rn ﬂows by mean
curvature to a round point. (Some nonconvex surfaces, such as a dumbbell,
can develop singularities.) Other factors such as heat ﬂow further complicate
crystal growth. There are many deﬁnitions of ﬂow, which agree in the nicest
cases (see e.g. the survey on “Geometric models of crystal growth” by Taylor,
Cahn, and Handwerker). Some recent approaches require the full strength of
geometric measure theory (see e.g. Almgren, Taylor, and Wang). Hubert Bray
used a simultaneous ﬂow of surfaces and metrics in his recent proof of the

178
Geometric Measure Theory
Riemannian Penrose Conjecture in general relativity, which says roughly that
the square of the mass of the universe is at least as great as the sum of the
squares of the masses of its black holes. This result uses and generalizes the
Positive Mass Theorem of Schoen and Yau, which just says that the mass of
the universe is positive.
Francis, Sullivan, Kusner, et al. used elastic energy gradient ﬂow on Brak-
ke’s Surface Evolver to turn a sphere inside out, starting as in Figure 16.7.1.
The ﬂow is downward in two directions from the halfway energy saddle point
pictured in Figure 16.7.2.

CHAPTER 17
Isoperimetric Theorems in General
Codimension
The classical isoperimetric inequality (Section 13.2) for the volume of a
region in Rn in terms of its perimeter, maximized by the round ball, has
important generalizations to higher codimension and to other ambients. It
was not until 1986 that the classical isoperimetric inequality was extended
to general codimension by Fred Almgren (Figure 17.0.1). While in codimen-
sion 0 there is a unique region with given boundary, in higher codimension
there are many surfaces (of unbounded area) with given boundary, and the
isoperimetric inequality applies only to the one of least area.
17.1. Theorem (Almgren [2]).
An m-dimensional area-minimizing integral
current in Rn▷2  m  n◁has no more area than a round disc of the same
boundary area, with equality only for the round disc itself.
Remark.
Previously for m < n this result was known just for m D 2. In
that case the boundary, a curve in Rn, may by decomposition be assumed to be
a closed curve through the origin. The cone over the curve can be developed
in the plane and thus shown to have no more area than a round planar disc
(see Federer 4.5.14).
Proof sketch.
As in 13.7, among area-minimizing surfaces with the same
area as the round unit disc, there exists a Q of least boundary area.
The second step is to show that ∂Q has mean curvature at most 1 (the mean
curvature of the boundary of the unit disc). Since ∂Q is not known to be
smooth, this statement is formulated weakly, in terms of the ﬁrst variation of
∂Q (see Section 11.2).

Isoperimetric Theorems in General Codimension
183
To make the ensuing discussion speciﬁc we treat the case of a 2-dimensional
area-minimizing surface Q of area 	 in R3, chosen to minimize the length of
its boundary curve C. Also we will suppress some relatively routine concerns
about singularities.
Note that ﬂowing the boundary of the unit disc (with unit curvature) by
its curvature and then rescaling to the original enclosed area just restores
the unit disc, with no change in enclosed area. Moreover, this ﬂow, directly
into the surface, realizes a general upper bound on the reduction of least
area enclosed; any smaller new minimizer, together with the strip of surface
swept out by the ﬂowing boundary, would have less area than the original
minimizer, a contradiction. By comparison, if C somewhere had curvature
greater than 1, a local variation followed by rescaling would reduce the length
of C, a contradiction.
The third step is to show that the length of a curve with curvature bounded
by 1 is at least 2	, with equality only for a round circle. Consider the
Gauss map G mapping each point of the boundary B of the convex hull of C
to the unit sphere. Because B  C is generally ﬂat in one direction as in
Figure 17.1.1, the entire area 4	 of the unit sphere is due to the singular
contribution along B \ C, where the surface has a dihedral angle 0  ˛  	.
The contribution of an element ds to the area 4	 of the sphere is proportional
to ˛ ds. Consideration of the example of the unit circle with  D 1 and ˛ D 	
shows the constant to be 2/	. Therefore

The boundary B of the convex hull of the curve C is generally ﬂat

the singular contribution along B \ C, depending on a dihedral angle ˛, here often
90 degrees, while 180 degrees for a ﬂat circle.

184
Geometric Measure Theory
The following theorem of Almgren and Allard gives a general isoperi-
metric inequality for m-dimensional minimal (stationary, not necessarily area-
minimizing) surfaces (possibly with singularities) in Rn. It is conjectured that
the round disc is the extreme case, but this remains open even for smooth
minimal surfaces of several boundary components in R3; see Section 4 of the
survey on “The isoperimetric inequality” by Osserman [1], and [Sullivan and
Morgan, Problem 22].
17.2. Theorem (Allard Theorem 7.1 and Corollary 7.2).
There is a constant
c▷m, n◁such that an m-dimensional minimal submanifold with boundary of
Rn has no more than c times the area of a round disc of the same boundary
area. More generally, any submanifold M with boundary and mean curvature
vector H satisﬁes

Still more generally, any compact integral varifold V satisﬁes
▷2◁
jVj▷m1◁/m  cjυVj.
Here j j is used for total area or measure.
Remark.
The proof uses monotonicity (and a covering argument), and
hence does not generalize to more general integrands. Of course, minimizers
for general integrands satisfy certain inequalities by comparison with mini-
mizers for area.
17.3. General Ambient Manifolds.
As described in Section 12.3, Federer
provides a very general isoperimetric inequality for area-minimizing surfaces
in a general Riemannian manifold M with boundary, with little information
about how the constant depends on M. Hoffman and Spruck [Theorem 22]
give a delicate generalization of 17.2(1) to small submanifolds of a Rieman-
nian manifold, depending on the mean curvature of the submanifold and the
sectional curvature of the ambient.
In codimension 0, Yau [Section 4] (using divergence of the distance func-
tion) and Croke (using integral geometry) give linear and standard isoperi-
metric inequalities depending on diameter, volume, and Ricci curvature.
The Aubin Conjecture seeks sharp isoperimetric inequalities in a simply
connected Riemannian manifold of sectional curvature K  K0  0. This has
been proved only in dimension two, and in dimension three by Bruce Kleiner
by a generalization of Almgren’s proof of Theorem 17.1; see Morgan and
Johnson.

4.11. It follows from Theorem 4.4(1) that A D fT 2 Rm: spt T ² B▷0, R◁g is M com-
plete. To show that B D fT 2 Fm: spt T ² B▷0, R◁g is F -complete, let Rj be a
Cauchy sequence in B. By taking a subsequence, we may assume that F ▷RjC1 
Rj◁< 2j. Write RjC1  Rj D Tj C ∂Sj with M▷Tj◁C M▷Sj◁< 2j. Since A is

4.12. That ∂carries Nm into Nm1 follows immediately from the deﬁnition of Nm and
