Introduction
In the Download Page blueprint I will tell you how to setup your download 
pages. These download pages will be the pages where your copycat 
sites redirect the traffic to. The download pages contain the actual 
download link (matching to the copycat site) and the ad for the offer you 
promote!

The Download Page Concept
Let’s recall the screenshot from blueprint 1 about download.com and 
their earning model 
Just free products and ads. 

Let’s follow their example. So basically our download pages should have 
these 2 sections: the free download and the ads.
That’s not too hard to replicate, is it? However of course I have included 
some bonus templates for these download pages.

Creating your Download Pages
Once again you don’t have to code anything yourself. Just open one of 
the bonus download page templates in your kompozer. 
It should look like:

The ad part
As you can see I don’t like to use that custom made banners that come 
with all those affiliate or CPA programs. Most banners convert really like 
Shi*. People just don’t click on it.
What I mostly do (like in this example) is making a screenshot of the 
offer I promote. Just hit printscreen. Go to a drawing program like paint 
(that everyone has running. Or a similar kind of program when you run 
MaC) and paste your printscreen. Now select only the part you want 
within paint and skip the rest.
If you are not happy with the free download button in the printscreen then 
just go to “Google”and search for a cool image. 
Example search for: free download icon. That goes for every picture you 
need btw.
In the download page example above I have made a printscreen of 
myfuncards.com and pasted another free download button in the 
printscreen within the Paint program.
This goes for every offer you want to promote. Just create an easy 
attractive ad and paste it that top part

The free download part
Simply change the name of the free download to the right program name 
(matching your copycat site) and link the name to the right setup file.

There are 3 ways to link to the right installer:
1. One download the installer from a download site to your local 
system (computer). After that upload the installer to your hosting 
account. Now just link the program name on your download page 
to this installer.
2. Go to a download site. And go the page where you can download 
the right installer. Now hit your right mouse button and hit 
properties. Copy/paste the link of the target url of the installer and 
link the program link on your download page to that url.

3. Check Blueprint 1 about the dMayBelFire.com download and CPA 
offer platform. Run your own kind download.com site for just $349. 
Upload new programs with the ease of mouse click from your 
administration panel!

Where to upload your download pages
This part is also cover in the Copycat BluePrint.
Basically you could upload the download pages to the same domain as 
your copycat sites as download.html for instance.
Example
http://www.yourdomain.com/copycatsitename/download.html
You can also choose to have your copycat sites on one domain and your 
download pages on another. Up to you! If you have a separate download 
pages domain. You could choose to call the file just like 
programname.html
Example
http://www.yourdomaincopycatsites.com/programname/
http://www.yourdomaindownloadpages.com/programname.html 
Get another domain for your download page site here:
http://www.whitehatcopycat.com/godaddy.html 

Something for lazy marketers
Of course you could link all copycat sites to just one download page 
With all downloads on 1 download page like:

I wouldn’t do it though. The page may become pretty long and it may 
focus the attention of your traffic on the wrong part  the other 
downloads instead of the ad.
It’s handy though if you ever want to promote another offer. You only 
have to change one page…
Your call!
