EYE’S ULTIMATE MONETIZING GUIDE 
 
If you don’t have CPALead, Leadbolt, or any other content unlocking network account I suggest you 
get one right now. They are, in my opinion, the easiest and most efficient affiliate networks for 
generating large sums of cash. I use Leadbolt, and I’ll be using it as an example for showing you one 
of my many monetizing methods. 
Unlike most eBooks, let’s get straight to the point: 
1. First we need to set up our page. If you don’t have one yet, create a 
Wordpress account here. The blog address can be anything you like, 
really. 
 
2. Download a cracked version of Auto Blog Samurai here. Use it to get some 
posts on your blog (which would also get you accepted on affiliate 
networks), it’s pretty self-explanatory. Here are the instructions just in 
case:

3. This is my blog: 
 
I have installed Wordpress on my own hosting with FTP, which allows me 
to install external plugins and themes. You could do this too, but you don’t 
have to for this method. If you don’t have WP on your OWN hosting 
skip this step. 
 
If you have Wordpress installed on your own hosting you can go ahead 
and install this plugin called 
Contact Form 7. It lets you create 
a simple but flexible contact form. 
You just need to copy the 
contents to wp-content/plugins 
(guide here). Once installed go to 
Plugins -> Plugins -> Activate.

Now hit settings. 
 
Copy in the following code (also available here), and hit save: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4. Go to Pages -> Add New 
 
If you did step 3 right you can simply enter a title and type in 
[contact-form 1 "Contact form 1"] 
 
If you didn’t do step 3 enable HTML and paste in this code (the only 
difference is that it’s not actually going to do anything this way): 
 
 
 
<p>Your 
Name<br /> 
    [text* your-
name] </p> 
 
<p>Your Paypal 
mail<br /> 
    [email* your-
email] </p> 
 
<p>Your 
Feedback<br />

This should be your result: 
 
The ‘Share and Enjoy!’ you see at the bottom is a great viral plugin called 
SexyBookmarks. 
 
5. Next we’re going to put our Leadbolt/CPALead lock over it. 
 
Go to Leadbolt and create a new unlocker:

Once it’s been approved grab you code: 
 
And just paste the code anywhere in your post. 
 
Here’s my result!

6. Ladies and gentlemen, it’s time to start spreading our page! You’ll need to 
find job offering websites such as: 
- Craigslist: http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites 
- Minute Workers: http://www.minuteworkers.com/ 
- Kijiji - http://www.ebayclassifieds.com/ 
- PostJobsFree - http://www.postjobsfree.com/ 
 
There are many more job websites. The more you can find, the 
Better it is. Also, high traffic job sites such as Minute Workers charge per 
job postings and will get you more revenue. 
 
After you’ve signed up at a couple of sites submit your job; writing a 
professional job offer is crucial! Here’s an example: 
 
Hello, 
 
We are a global third-party software company that just created a new *** 
website. We’re still in a free BETA-stage and we’d like to hear from you, in order 
to improve our service before we start officially. Therefore we are paying 150 
participants to take a look at our website and tell us what we should add/change 
on our website. 
 
Here’s the page: *****.com
