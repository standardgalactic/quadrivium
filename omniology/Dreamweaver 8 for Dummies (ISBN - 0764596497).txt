Dedication
To all those who dare to dream about the possibilities of the Web:
May this book make your work easier so you can make those
dreams come true.


Author’s Acknowledgments
Let me start by thanking my husband, David LaFontaine, whose patience and
support have kept me fed, loved, and entertained, even while working long
hours to make seemingly impossible deadlines.
Thanks to my wonderful contributor, Susannah Gardner, for gracing these
pages with examples of her own beautiful Web design work (see it on the Web
at www.hopstudios.com) and for revising Chapters 8 and 9. I recommend
both of her latest books, Buzz Marketing with Blogs For Dummies and
BitTorrent For Dummies.
Thanks to Frank Vera, a skilled programmer who deserves credit for revising
the three most complex chapters in this book, Chapters 13, 14, and 15, on
dynamic database features in Dreamweaver. 
Thanks also to Sheila Castelli, who designed many of the Web sites featured
in the examples. You can find her work online at www.digitalcottage.com.
Thanks to the entire editorial team: Travis Smith for his superb tech editing;
Becky Huehls and Rebecca Senninger for catching the details and improving
the prose; and Bob Woerner for shepherding this book through the develop-
ment and publishing process.
Over the years, I’ve thanked many people in my books — family, friends,
teachers, and mentors — but I have been graced by so many wonderful
people now that no publisher will give me enough pages to thank them all. So
let me conclude by thanking everyone I’ve ever known, just so I can go to
sleep tonight and know I haven’t forgotten anyone.

Dreamweaver 8 For Dummies

Introduction
I
’ve been writing about Macromedia Dreamweaver since the first version
came out in the mid 1990s, and I’m pleased to say that this latest (and
long-awaited) version 8 makes this program better than ever. If you’ve never
used Dreamweaver before, don’t worry; this book shows you everything you
need to know about the old features, as well as the new ones. If you have
used earlier versions of Dreamweaver, it’s definitely time to upgrade and
make sure you have all the tools available to create a fabulous Web site.
If you’re like most of the Web designers I know, you don’t have time to wade
through a thick book before you start working on your Web site. That’s why I
wrote Dreamweaver 8 For Dummies in a way that makes it easy for you to find
the answers you need quickly. You don’t have to read this book cover to
cover. If you’re in a hurry, just go right to the information you need most and
get back to work. If you’re new to Web design, or you want to really get to
know the intricacies of Dreamweaver, skim through the chapters to get an
overview and then go back and read what’s most relevant to your project in
greater detail. Whether you are building a simple site for the first time or
working to redesign a complex site for the umpteenth time, you find every-
thing you need in these pages.
Why Choose Dreamweaver?
With each new version of Dreamweaver, this award-winning program
becomes more efficient and powerful. Yet somehow, Macromedia continues
to make Dreamweaver intuitive and easy to use, even as its programmers
work long hours to keep up with the latest innovations in Web design and
release a new version of this program nearly every year since its creation.
The high-end features and ease of use of Dreamweaver make it an ideal
choice for professional Web designers, as well as for those new to working on
the Internet. And the new features in version 8 make Dreamweaver better
than ever!
I’ve been reviewing Web design programs since the first ones hit the market
in 1994, and I can assure you that Dreamweaver is the best one I’ve ever
worked with. But don’t take my word for it — Dreamweaver has already won
a slew of awards over the years, including Best of Show at Internet World, the
prestigious five-mouse rating from MacWorld, and Best Web Authoring Tool in
the Readers Choice Awards by PC Magazine.

Among all the Dreamweaver features, these are some of the best:
 Dreamweaver has clean HTML code and sophisticated support for the
latest HTML options (such as Dynamic HTML). 
 Cascading Style Sheets, better known as CSS, have become popular
among professional Web designers. It’s no wonder; this powerful part of
the HTML code can save considerable time and give you greater design
control than ever before. As you’d expect, Dreamweaver 8 offers more
sophisticated support for CSS and better rendering within the design
environment.
 Dreamweaver 8 even makes adding high-end features for creating database-
driven Web sites easier. These features used to be sold separately in
Dreamweaver UltraDev, but since Dreamweaver MX 2004, they’ve been
integrated into this one powerful program. Now, in version 8, these fea-
tures have been further refined and enhanced to work better than ever.
 As in previous versions, you find a state-of-the-art integrated text editor
that makes switching back and forth between Dreamweaver and a text
editor easier (if you prefer to look at the code, behind your pages you
find some great enhancements to the text editor in this version). 
If you’ve never written HTML before, don’t be intimidated by these fancy 
features. The Dreamweaver graphical design environment uses carefully
designed palettes and windows to make it easy for you to create high-end
Web sites that include such features as animations, interactive forms, and 
e-commerce systems, even if you don’t know HTML.
Foolish Assumptions
Although Dreamweaver is designed for professional developers, I don’t assume
you’re a pro — at least not yet. In keeping with the philosophy behind the For
Dummies series, this book is an easy-to-use guide designed for readers with a
wide range of experience. Being interested in Web design and wanting to
create a Web site is key, but that desire is all that I expect from you. 
If you’re an experienced Web designer, Dreamweaver 8 For Dummies is an ideal
reference for you because it gets you working quickly with this program, start-
ing with basic Web page design features and progressing to the more advanced
options for DHTML and database-driven sites. If you’re new to Web design,
this book walks you through all you need to know to create a Web site.

About This Book
I designed Dreamweaver 8 For Dummies to help you find the answers you
need when you need them. You don’t have to read this book cover to cover
and memorize it (and I don’t really recommend this as beach reading). Con-
sider this a quick study guide and a reference when you need it. Each section
of the book stands alone, giving you easy answers to particular questions and
step-by-step instructions for specific tasks.
Want to find out how to change the background color on a page, create a
nested table, build HTML frames, or get into the really cool stuff such as style
sheets and layers? Then jump right in and go directly to the section that most
interests you. Oh, and don’t worry about keeping all those new HTML tags in
your head. You don’t have to memorize anything. The next time you need to
do one of these tasks, just go back and review that section. And don’t worry
about getting sand on this book if you do take it to the beach — I promise it
won’t complain!
Conventions Used in This Book
Keeping things consistent makes them easier to understand. In this book,
those consistent elements are conventions. Notice how the word conventions
is in italics? That’s a convention I use frequently. I put new terms in italics
and then define them so that you know what they mean.
When I type URLs (Web addresses) or e-mail addresses within regular para-
graph text, they look like this: www.jcwarner.com. Sometimes, however, I set
URLs off on their own lines, like this:
www.jcwarner.com
That’s so you can easily spot them on a page if you want to type them into
your browser to visit a site. I also assume that your Web browser doesn’t
require the introductory http:// for Web addresses. If you use an older
browser, remember to type this before the address (also make sure you
include that part of the address when you’re creating links in Dreamweaver).
Even though Dreamweaver makes knowing HTML code unnecessary, you may
want to wade into HTML waters occasionally. I include HTML code in this
book when I think it can help you better understand how HTML works. When
3
Introduction

I do provide examples, such as this code which links a URL to a Web page, I
set off HTML in the same monospaced type as URLs:
<A HREF=”http://www.jcwarner.com”>Janine’s Web Site</A>
When I introduce you to a new set of features, such as options in a dialog
box, I set these items apart with bullets so that you can see that they’re all
related. When I want you to follow instructions, I use numbered steps to walk
you through the process.
How This Book Is Organized
To ease you through the learning curve associated with any new program, 
I organized Dreamweaver 8 For Dummies to be a complete reference. The 
following sections provide a breakdown of the parts of the book and what
you can find in each one. Each chapter walks you through the features of
Dreamweaver step by step, providing tips and helping you understand the
vocabulary of Web design.
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams
This part introduces you to Dreamweaver and covers getting started with the
basics. In Chapter 1, I give you a handy reference to toolbars and menu
options. I also describe the new features in version 8. You may prefer to skim
this chapter as it’s designed to give you an overview of the program, and you
don’t have to memorize the contents of each menu and toolbar. In Chapter 2,
I start you on the road to creating your first Web site, including setting up
your site, importing an existing site, creating new Web pages, applying basic
formatting to text, and even placing images and setting links on your pages.
To make this chapter more interesting and help you see how all these fea-
tures come together, I walk you through creating a real Web page in this chap-
ter as I show you how each features works.
Part II: Looking Like a Million 
(Even on a Budget)
Planning the design of your Web site is perhaps the most important part of
Web site development — you’ll save plenty of reorganizing time later. In
Chapter 3, I start you out on the right foot with tips on Web site management,
the principles of good design, and strategies that can save you countless
hours. I also introduce you to the Dreamweaver site-management features,
which can help you keep track of all the elements in your site and make sure
4
Dreamweaver 8 For Dummies 

you don’t have any broken links. In Chapter 4, I introduce you to some of my
favorite Dreamweaver features, including sophisticated template capabilities,
that enable you to create more consistent designs and even lock sections of a
page to protect them. I also love Dreamweaver’s Library items, which can be
used to place and update commonly used elements on your pages, such as
navigation bars or copyright tags. If you work with a team of designers, you
may be especially interested in the check in and check out features covered
in this chapter for version control and integrated e-mail for communicating
with other team members. Chapter 4 also covers tracing images, the Quick
Tag Editor, Design Notes, and the History palette.
Chapter 5 introduces you to the basics of creating, converting, and optimiz-
ing graphics for the Web and shows you how to add graphic elements to your
pages. You can find tools and strategies for creating the best images for your
Web site, as well as tips for finding free images online and buying graphics
that are specially designed for the Web.
Part III: Advancing Your Site
In Part III, I show you how to use Dreamweaver with some of the more
advanced HTML features. In Chapter 6, you discover how to use HTML tables
to create page layouts that work in the most common Web browsers. A high-
light of this chapter is Layout mode, which makes creating complex Web
designs easier than ever. In Chapter 7, you find all you need to know about
designing a site with HTML frames. (This chapter helps you decide when you
should and shouldn’t use frames and gives you plenty of step-by-step instruc-
tions for creating HTML frames in Dreamweaver.)
Chapter 8 provides an overview of how Cascading Style Sheets work and how
they can save you time. CSS has become a popular way to create designs and
manage formatting on Web pages, and these features have been nicely
improved in Dreamweaver 8. In this chapter, you find descriptions of the style
definition options available in Dreamweaver as well as instructions for creat-
ing and applying styles.
Part IV: Making It Cool
The most important thing in Web design is looking cool, and this section of
the book is designed to make sure you’re part of the “cool club.” In Chapter 9,
I take you further into CSS and include Dynamic HTML features, such as
layers and behaviors, which allow precise design control and new levels of
interactivity. Chapter 10 introduces Fireworks, the Macromedia image pro-
gram for the Web, and shows you how to take advantage of Dreamweaver’s
integration with Fireworks to more easily edit images.
5
Introduction

In Chapter 11, you find out how easily you can add multimedia to your Web
pages, including how to link a variety of file types — from Flash to Java to
RealAudio — to your Web pages. Then in Chapter 12, I cover HTML forms and
how to use Dreamweaver to add interactive elements, such as surveys, search
engines, online discussion areas, and e-commerce systems to your pages.
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content
Part V features three chapters that cover the most advanced features in
Dreamweaver 8. Chapter 13 is designed to help you understand how database-
driven Web sites work and why they have become so important on the Web. 
In Chapter 14, you discover how to add dynamic content to your pages, 
define data sources, and display record sets. And in Chapter 15, you pull 
it all together and find out how to build master pages, create pages to search
databases, and test your work with a live connection.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In The Part of Tens, you get three quick references to help you get the most
out of Dreamweaver and avoid some of the common design mistakes on the
Web. In Chapter 16, you find descriptions and images of ten Web sites created
with Dreamweaver to give you an idea of what’s possible. In Chapter 17, you
find ten great Web design ideas; and in Chapter 18, you get ten tips to save
you time and make your sites work better.

n Part I, you discover that you’re not dreaming and all
the wonderful advances in this powerful Web design
program are real and at your fingertips. The new features
of Dreamweaver 8 make Web design easier, more intuitive,
and more powerful than ever. And don’t worry, if you’re
new to Dreamweaver or need a little refresher, this part
includes an introduction to this award-winning Web design
program. Chapter 1 provides an overview, with highlights
on what’s new in version 8, as well as descriptions of the
toolbars, menus, and panels that make up Dreamweaver’s
interface. In Chapter 2, you dive right into setting up your
Web site, creating your first Web page, and adding text,
images, and links.

W
elcome to the wonderful world of Dreamweaver 8. If you’re an experi-
enced Web designer, you’re going to love the power and sophistica-
tion of this Web editor. If you’re new to building Web sites, you’ll appreciate
its simplicity and intuitive interface. Either way, this chapter starts you on
your way to making the most of Dreamweaver by introducing you to the
menus and panels that make this program so useful.
Dreamweaver can help you with every aspect of Web development, from
designing simple pages, to fixing links, to publishing your pages on the World
Wide Web. Dreamweaver can handle the simplest HTML, as well as some of
the most complex and advanced features possible on the Web, including
Cascading Style Sheets and Dynamic HTML (see Chapters 8 and 9 for more
information on these features). Dreamweaver also integrates a powerful
HTML text editor into its easy-to-use graphical design environment so you
can work in the HTML code if you prefer.
If you already work in another Web design program or you’re updating a site
that was created in another program, don’t worry — you can use Dreamweaver
to modify existing Web pages and continue to develop your Web site without
losing all the time you’ve already invested. For example, if you’ve been working
in a program such as Microsoft FrontPage or Adobe GoLive, you can change to
Dreamweaver to edit and develop your site further. All Web design programs
create HTML pages, and those pages can be opened in any other Web design
program. At the end of this chapter, in the “Working on Web Pages Created in
Another Web Design Program” section, you find a few warnings about the chal-
lenges you may encounter because the code can vary slightly from program to
program, but once you clean up those differences, you should be fine.
In this chapter, you find an introduction to the new features in Dreamweaver 8,
get a tour of the desktop, and gain an overview of what makes Dreamweaver
such a powerful Web design program. 

So What’s New in Dreamweaver 8?
Now the good stuff. All those requests you make to Macromedia, all that
wishful thinking . . . believe it or not, they heard you and many of the little —
and not so little — things we all have been wanting in this program are finally
here, as well as a few extras you might expect! 
The following list provides you a quick overview of some of the new features
you find in version 8:
 When you first launch Dreamweaver 8, you’ll notice a few changes to the
Workspace. Although it has no dramatic changes, the programmers at
Macromedia have added some clever new features, including a magnify-
ing glass feature complete with a little icon in the status bar just below
the work area. Much like the magnifiers common in image-editing pro-
grams, this new feature enables you to zoom in to view page elements in
greater detail or zoom out to see the full layout of a larger page.
 You’ll find some of the most extensive changes in the way Dreamweaver
handles CSS — important upgrades as Cascading Style Sheets become
increasingly popular among professional designers. Among other things,
you’ll find improved CSS rendering, better support for positioning, and a
more unified CSS panel that includes the Rule Tracker, Property Grid,
and a new Composite view.
 You can find one of my favorite new feature sets on the Edit menu. Paste
Special enables you to paste formatted text (and even tables) from other
programs, such as Microsoft Word or Excel, with options about what for-
matting is kept. You can choose to paste text with structural formatting,
such as tables and paragraph marks; with or without basic formatting,
such as bold and italics; and you can even opt to clean up the often
problematic paragraph formatting from Word as you paste in the text. 
If you specify your choices in Dreamweaver’s Preferences, anytime 
you use the paste feature your text is inserted based on your favorite
options.
 Going beyond the predesigned templates included in previous versions,
Dreamweaver now includes Starter Pages, which not only include topic-
based designs. They actually include text. Of course, you can edit the
text; but if you’re creating a calendar of events or a product catalog, for
example, the general text already in place on these pages gives you a
head start. 
 If you prefer working in Code view, where you can see all the HTML tags,
you’ll find a few enhancements to that interface, including a new toolbar
that provides quick access to common commands and the capability to
selectively expand and collapse code so you can focus on the area you
are working on.
12
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

 I always recommend that you design your pages for the broadest audi-
ence, and that definitely includes designing for the disabled, such as the
blind who use special browsers that read Web pages aloud. Macromedia
has always been good about including accessibility features, and I’m
pleased to see those features support the Priority 2 Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines.
Introducing the Many Components 
of Dreamweaver
Dreamweaver can seem a bit overwhelming at first. It has so many features,
and they are spread out in so many panels, toolbars, and dialog boxes that
you can easily get lost. If you prefer to learn by poking around, have at it (and
feel free to skip ahead to the next chapter where you start building your first
Web page). If you want a tour before you get started, the next few sections
introduce you to the interface and provide an overview of the basics of
Dreamweaver. You also discover where to find common features and func-
tions, which the rest of the book covers in more detail.
The Workspace
When you launch Dreamweaver, the Start Screen appears in the main area of
the program (and it reappears anytime you don’t have a file open). From the
Start Screen, you can choose to create a new page from one of the many
Dreamweaver pre-made templates, or you can create a new blank page by
selecting HTML from the Create New options in the middle column. When
you select HTML, Dreamweaver creates a new blank HTML page in the main
Workspace, as shown in Figure 1-1. You can type text directly into any page in
the Workspace and apply basic formatting with the many formatting options
described later in this chapter.
You build HTML pages, templates, style sheets, and so on in the Workspace,
which consists of a main window that shows the page you’re working on sur-
rounded by a number of panels and menus that provide tools you can use to
design and develop your pages (shown in Figure 1-1). The Dreamweaver
Workspace consists of the following basic components: the menu bar (at the
very top), the Insert bar (just below it), the Document window (the main area
of the screen, just below the Insert bar), the Properties inspector (at the
bottom of the screen), and the Vertical Docking panels (to the right of the
Document window) that expand and collapse as needed. More detailed
descriptions of each of these follows.
13
Chapter 1: Introducing Your New Best Friend

The Document window
The big, open area in the main area of the Workspace is the Document window,
which is where you work on new and existing pages. If you use the Designer
interface in Design view, you see your page as it would display in a Web
browser. If you want to see the HTML code behind your page, click the Code
button at the top of the work area. Choose the Split button to see the HTML
code and Design view simultaneously (which you can see in Figure 1-2). 
Pages viewed on the World Wide Web may not always look exactly the way
they do in the Document window in Dreamweaver because not all browsers
support the same HTML features or display them identically. For best results,
always test your work in a variety of Web browsers, and design your pages to
work best in the browsers that your audience are most likely to use. Fortu-
nately, Dreamweaver includes features that help you target your page designs
to specific browsers, such as the Check Target Browsers feature covered in
Chapter 3.)

Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

Customizing the interface
The docking panels, palettes, and bars in Dreamweaver provide easy access
to most of the program’s features. The default settings put the Properties
inspector at the bottom of the page, the Insert bar at the top, and the panels
on the right, but you can move these elements around the screen by selecting
them and use drag and drop to move them to another part of the screen. You
can also close any or all the panels on the right by clicking the tiny Options
icon in the top right of each panel and selecting Close Panel from the drop-
down list (it looks like three bullet points with lines next to them and a little
arrow underneath, and it’s really, really small). You can close them all at once
by choosing Window➪Hide Panels (or by clicking the arrow in the middle of
the row of panels), and you can access any or all the panels through the vari-
ous options on the Window menu. If you want to open a particular panel —
the CSS Styles panel, for example — choose Window➪CSS Styles and it
expands to become visible on your screen. The Properties inspector, Insert
bar, and panels are integral parts of this program, and you find a lot more
information about them throughout the book. Check out the Cheat Sheet at
the front of this book for a handy reference to the Properties inspector
options. In Chapter 2, you discover how to use some of the most common
features, such as the icon for inserting an image on the Insert bar at the top
of the screen.

Chapter 1: Introducing Your New Best Friend

The Insert bar
The Insert bar, located at the top of the screen, comes with eight subcate-
gories, each with a different set of icons representing common features. Click
the small arrow to the right of the name to access the drop-down list to
switch from displaying the buttons on one subcategory to showing the but-
tons for another. The options are
 Common bar: Displays icons for many of the most common features,
including links, tables, and images.
 Layout bar: Displays layer and table options essential for creating com-
plex layouts.
 Forms bar: Surprise! This one features all the most common form ele-
ments, such as radio buttons and boxes.
 Text bar: Displays common text-formatting features, including para-
graphs, breaks, and lists.
 HTML bar: Offers a mishmash of raw HTML, such as rules, tables,
frames and, scripts.
 Application: Use these options when building dynamic Web pages pow-
ered by database material.
 Flash elements: A single icon allows you to place a Flash file on your
Web page.
 Favorites: Right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac) to customize
your most-used HTML elements.
At the very end of the drop-down list, you find the Show as Tabs option,
which enables you to display the names of the Insert bars as tabs across the
top of the screen, as shown in Figure 1-3. 
The Favorites Insert bar is blank by default, and you can customize it to hold
your own collection of options. Simply right-click (Windows) or Control+click
(Mac) in the bar and you can easily customize this bar.
Throughout the book, I refer to these Insert bars by their full names, such as
the Forms Insert bar or the Layout Insert bar. You find more information on
each of these in their relevant chapters. For example, Chapter 12 covers the
Forms Insert bar in detail; and Chapters 13, 14, and 15 cover the Application
Insert bar.
Figure 1-3 shows the Insert bar with the Common options visible and each
name displayed in a tab across the top of the screen.
16
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

The Properties inspector
The Properties inspector is docked at the bottom of the page in Dreamweaver.
If you prefer it at the top of the screen, you can drag it up there, and it locks
into place; but I rather like that it’s handy, yet out of the way, at the bottom of
the screen.
The Properties inspector displays the properties of a selected element on the
page. A property is a characteristic of HTML — such as the alignment of an
image or the size of a cell in a table — that you can assign to an element on
your Web page. If you know HTML, you recognize these as HTML attributes.
When you select any element on a page (such as an image), the inspector
changes to display the relevant properties for that element, such as the
height and width of an image. You can alter these properties by changing the
fields in the Properties inspector. You can also set links and create image
maps using the options in the Properties inspector.
Figure 1-4 shows the image options displayed in the Properties inspector,
including height and width, alignment, and the URL (Uniform Resource
Locator or, more simply, Web address) to which the image links.
At the bottom-right corner of the Properties inspector, you see a small arrow.
Click this arrow (or double-click in any open inspector space) to reveal addi-
tional attributes that let you control more advanced features, such as the
image map options when a graphic is selected.

Figure 1-5 shows the Properties inspector when you select a table. Notice
that the fields in the inspector reflect the attributes of an HTML table, such
as the number of columns and rows. (See Chapter 6 to find out more about
HTML tables.)
The Docking panels
The Docking panels, shown in Figure 1-6, are located to the right of the work
area (although you can easily move them anywhere on the screen). The Docking
panels display a variety of important features in Dreamweaver, including all the
files and folders in a site (in the Files panel), Cascading Style Sheets (in the CSS

panel) and more. You can open and close panels by clicking the small arrow to
the left of the panel’s name. To display more panels, select the panel name from
the Window menu. To hide all the visible panels at once, click the tab with the
small arrow in the middle, left of the row of panels.
The following list offers a description of some of the elements that you
access through the Docking panels (the others are described in greater detail
in their respective sections of the book).
 Files panel: Shown in Figure 1-6, the Files panel lists all the folders and
files in a Web site and helps you manage the structure and organization
of the site. You can move files in and out of folders and even create new
folders in this panel, and Dreamweaver automatically adjusts any related
links. The Files panel is also where you access FTP (file transfer protocol)
capabilities to upload or download files from a server. You can use the
Connect button at the top of this panel to dial quickly into your server
and use the Get Files and Put Files arrows to transfer pages. (See
Chapter 2 for more about the Files panel and built-in FTP features.)

19
Chapter 1: Introducing Your New Best Friend

 Assets panel: The Assets panel, shown in Figure 1-7, automatically lists
all the images, colors, external links, multimedia files, scripts, templates,
and Library items in a Web site. You can add a stored item, such as a
graphic, to a Web page simply by dragging the element into the work
area. You find more on templates and Library items in Chapter 4.
These features work only if you define your site using the Site Definition
dialog box (by choosing Site➪Manage Sites) and then identifying the
main folder of your Web site. If you find that the Library or other options
aren’t available, follow the steps in Chapter 2 to define your site (a setup
process you should go through for all your sites). 
 CSS panel: The Cascading Style Sheets panel includes Layers and CSS
Styles panels. CSS styles are similar to style sheets used in word pro-
cessing and desktop publishing programs, such as Microsoft Word and
QuarkXPress. You define a style and name it, and the style is then
included in the CSS Styles panel (see Figure 1-8). The Layers panel pro-
vides access to layers options, which enable you to precisely position
elements on a page. (For more information about CSS and layers, see
Chapters 8 and 9.)
Figure 1-7:

20
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

 Tag panel: The Tag panel provides access to attributes and behaviors. In
Dreamweaver, behaviors are scripts (usually written in JavaScript) that
you can apply to objects to add interactivity to your Web page.
Essentially, a behavior is made up of a specified event that, when trig-
gered, causes an action. For example, an event may be a visitor clicking
an image, and the resulting action may be that a sound file plays.
Figure 1-9 shows the Tag panel’s Attributes tab, which displays all the
attributes of a selected element. You can change attributes in the
Attributes tab as well as in the Properties inspector. (Chapter 9 provides
more information on creating and applying behaviors.)

 History panel: The History panel, shown in Figure 1-10, keeps track of
every action you take in Dreamweaver. You can use the History panel to
undo multiple steps at once, to replay steps you performed, and to auto-
mate tasks. Dreamweaver automatically records the last 50 steps, but you
can increase or decrease that number by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪
General (Windows) or Dreamweaver➪Preferences➪General (Mac), and
changing the maximum number of history steps.
 Application panel: This panel includes the Database, Bindings, Server
Behaviors, and Components panels. These features are used only if you
work with a database-driven site (the most technically complex of the
features covered in this book). You find more on database options in
Chapters 13, 14, and 15.
 Frames panel: If you create a site design that uses frames, a set of HTML
tags that enable you to divide a screen into sections made up of sepa-
rate pages, you use the Frames panel to manage the different pages on
the screen, such as the three frames shown in Figure 1-11.

The menu bar
At the top of the screen, the Dreamweaver menu bar provides easy access 
to all the features that you find in the Insert bar, Properties inspector, and
panels, as well as a few others that are available only from the menu. The fol-
lowing sections provide a general description of each of the menu options.
The File menu
You find many familiar options, such as New, Open, and Save, on the File
menu, shown in Figure 1-12. You also find a Revert option, which is similar to
the Revert feature in Adobe Photoshop. This sophisticated undo feature
enables you to return your page quickly to its last-saved version if you don’t
like the changes you made.
The File menu also includes access to Design Notes, a unique feature that
associates private notes with HTML and other files. Take a look at Chapter 4
for more information about Design Notes and other Dreamweaver features
that make collaboration easier.
You can also find features useful for checking your work in Web browsers on
the File menu. Most Web design programs include some way of previewing
your work in a browser. Dreamweaver takes this feature two steps further by
enabling you to check your work in a number of browsers and even test the
compatibility of your pages in different versions of different browsers.
Figure 1-12 shows the Check Page options, which includes Check Accessibility,
Check Links, and Check Target Browsers — all great tools for testing your
work. The Check Target Browsers option enables you to specify a browser
and version, such as Safari 2.0, Netscape 6, or Internet Explorer 6.0. When
you do a browser check, Dreamweaver generates a report listing any HTML
features you use that the chosen browser doesn’t support. 
The Check Links feature verifies all the links in a site and produces a report
with all broken and unresolved links. The Check Accessibility feature checks
to make sure the page displays properly in browsers for the blind and other
systems for the disabled.
The Edit menu
The Edit menu contains many features that you may find familiar, such as
Cut, Copy, and Paste. One feature that may be new to you is the Edit with
External Editor option, which enables you to open an element in another pro-
gram, such as an image editor, and make changes without ever closing
Dreamweaver.
23
Chapter 1: Introducing Your New Best Friend

You also find the Preferences settings on the Edit menu (Windows) or on the
Dreamweaver (Mac). Before you start working with a new program, go
through all the Preferences options to ensure that the program is set up the
best way for you.
The View menu
The View menu provides access to some helpful design features, such as
grids and rulers, as well as the new zoom features. The Visual Aides option
on the View menu gives you the option of turning on or off the borders of
your HTML tables, frames, and layers, as well as controlling visibility of
image maps and other invisible elements. This option is useful because you
often want to set the border attribute of these HTML tags to zero so that
they’re not visible when the page displays in a browser. However, while you
work on the design of your page in Dreamweaver, seeing where elements,
such as tables and layers, start and stop is very useful. Checking the frame
options on the View menu lets you see the borders in Dreamweaver even if
you don’t want them visible to your site’s visitors.
The Insert menu
As shown in Figure 1-13, the Insert menu offers access to a number of fea-
tures unique to Web design. From this menu, you can insert elements such as
a horizontal rule, a Java applet, a form, or a plug-in file.
Figure 1-12:

24
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

Dreamweaver offers extra support for inserting Flash and Shockwave
Director files, both of which are products from Macromedia. (You can find
out more about using multimedia files in Chapter 11.)
The Modify menu
The Modify menu is another place where you can view and change object
properties, such as the table attributes shown in Figure 1-14. The properties
(usually called attributes in HTML) let you define elements on a page by set-
ting alignment, height, width, and other specifications.
Page Properties
To alter properties for an entire page, such as text and link colors, use the
Page Properties dialog box shown in Figure 1-15. Available from the Modify
menu or by clicking the Page Properties button at the bottom of the
Properties inspector, the Page Properties panel also enables you to specify
the background color or to use an image as a page background.

The Text menu
You can easily format text with the Text menu by using simple options, such
as bold and italic, as well as more complex features, such as font styles and
custom style sheets. Text formatting options have evolved dramatically on
the Web. Just a few years ago, you didn’t even have the option of specifying a
particular font style or controlling leading and spacing. Today you have more
control than ever over the look of your Web pages, although these options
aren’t yet universally supported. The Text menu also features options that

enable you to quickly create headers and subheads, check spelling, and
create lists.
The Commands menu
The Commands menu, shown in Figure 1-16, provides access to a host of
options in Dreamweaver. These options include the Start and Play Recording
features, which let you quickly save a series of steps and then repeat them.
To use this feature, choose Commands➪Start Recording, perform whatever
actions you want to record — for example, copying and pasting some text —
and then choose Stop Recording. To perform any action again, choose
Commands➪Play Recorded Command. You can download an action by
choosing Commands➪Get More Commands, which automatically launches a
browser and takes you to the Macromedia Web site. You can download new
commands from the Web site that add functionality to Dreamweaver.
The Clean Up XHTML and Clean up Word HTML options on the Commands
menu help you correct incorrect or redundant HTML code, and the Clean Up
Word HTML feature is designed especially to correct the common problems
caused by the Save As HTML feature in Microsoft Word.
The Add/Remove Netscape Resize Fix option on this menu inserts or removes
a JavaScript script designed to help correct an old Netscape bug by automati-
cally reloading the page when users resize their browser windows.

The Create Web Photo Album option launches Macromedia Fireworks and
uses it to automate the creation of a photo album with a series of images. If
you choose Optimize Image in Fireworks, a selected image automatically
opens in the optimization area in Fireworks. (Both these commands require
that you have Fireworks installed.)
The Site menu
The Site menu provides access to the options you need to set up your site, a
process required before many of the other Dreamweaver features work prop-
erly. (Chapter 2 covers this process.) The Site menu also gives you easy
access to the Check In and Check Out features, which are options that can
help you keep a team of designers from overwriting each other’s work.
(Chapter 4 talks about this feature.)
The Window menu
The Window menu lets you control the display of panels and dialog boxes,
such as Insert, Properties, and Behaviors. To make these panels visible,
select the panel name so that a check mark appears next to the feature you
want to display; to hide them, select again to remove the check mark. Other
panels and dialog boxes, such as CSS Styles and HTML Code Inspector, are
also listed on the Window menu for easy access.
The Help menu
The Help menu provides easy access to help options that can assist you in
figuring out many features of Dreamweaver. You also find access to the
Dreamweaver template and example files on the Help menu. 
Templates and examples provide visual samples of common HTML designs,
such as tables and frames, and provide design ideas and great shortcuts for
creating complex layouts.
The status bar
The status bar appears at the bottom left of any open Dreamweaver docu-
ment. On the right end of the status bar, you can see tool icons that control
the on-screen display of your document. On the left end, you find a row of
HTML codes that indicate how elements on your page are tagged. If you place
your cursor in bold text that is centered, for example, the status bar might
display <BODY><CENTER><B>. This feature makes double-checking the kind of
formatting applied to any element on your page easy. 
You can also use the status bar to quickly make a selection on your page. For
example, if you click the name of a tag in the status bar, the section of your
page where that tag is applied is highlighted. This makes selecting a certain
section of a page, such as a page, easier.
28

Working on Web Pages Created in
Another Web Design Program
In theory, all Web design programs should be compatible because HTML files
are, at their heart, just ordinary text files. You can open an HTML file in any
text editor, including Macintosh TextEdit and Windows Notepad. However,
HTML has evolved dramatically over the years and different Web programs
follow different standards, which can cause serious conflicts when a page cre-
ated in one program opens in another.
One of the reasons Dreamweaver is so popular is because it creates very
clean code and is considered more accurate and more respectful of HTML
standards than other programs. Dreamweaver is also better at creating pages
that work in different browsers and on different platforms, but importing files
created in another Web program can be challenging, even in Dreamweaver. 
To help with the transition, Dreamweaver includes some special features,
such as the Clean Up Word HTML option, designed to fix some of the
common problems with Microsoft Word’s HTML code. 
Before you start working on a site that was developed in another program,
you need to import the site into Dreamweaver. I recommend you make a
backup of the site first so you have a copy of all the original pages (strange
things can happen when you open a site created in another program). You
find step-by-step instructions for importing an existing Web site in Chapter 2.
The following sections describe the most popular HTML editors and what
you need to know if you’re moving files from one of these programs to
Dreamweaver.
Microsoft FrontPage 
Microsoft FrontPage is one of the most popular HTML editors on the market,
in large part because it’s a part of the immensely popular Microsoft Office.
FrontPage offers some powerful features as well as an attractive bundle of
programs for Web developers, including Image Composer, a graphics pro-
gram designed for creating images for the Web. FrontPage also includes Web
components that you can use to add interactive features, such as a simple
search engine or a discussion area, to your Web site. Web components work
only if their corresponding programs reside on the Web server that you use,
but many commercial service providers now offer FrontPage Web components. 
If you are migrating a site from FrontPage to Dreamweaver, first make note of
any FrontPage Web components that you use, such as search engines or forms.
Dreamweaver doesn’t offer these same built-in features, and you won’t be able
29
Chapter 1: Introducing Your New Best Friend

to continue editing them in Dreamweaver the way you did in FrontPage.
Although you don’t need to alter the code for these components, thanks to the
Dreamweaver respect for unique code, you can’t edit FrontPage’s built-in com-
ponents in Dreamweaver.
If you use CSS or layers in FrontPage, you need to pay special attention to
those features as you convert your site to Dreamweaver. Microsoft FrontPage
isn’t as good as Dreamweaver at creating high-end features that work in both
Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, so you probably want to
improve your code if you expect viewers to use any browser other than
Internet Explorer. Because CSS and layers are more complex than HTML to
code, you probably don’t want to edit this code manually — converting from
other editors to Dreamweaver can get pretty tricky. Tables can also get messy
when you switch from one program to another. In some cases, you may find
that the simplest solution is to delete the elements that you created in
FrontPage and re-create them in Dreamweaver. (For more on CSS and layers,
check out Chapters 8 and 9.)
Microsoft Word
Although Microsoft Word is a word processor and is not considered an HTML
editor per se, it does have HTML output capabilities. As a result, you will
likely encounter pages that have been created and saved in Microsoft Word
at some point. The problems you find in HTML code generated from Word are
similar to the problems generated from FrontPage: They both tend to create
unusual and sometimes redundant code that deviates from HTML standards.
Because Word-generated HTML is so common, Dreamweaver includes a spe-
cial Clean Up Word HTML command. To use this feature, choose Commands➪
Clean Up Word HTML and then specify the code you want altered in the Clean
Up Word HTML dialog box. When you use this feature, Dreamweaver removes
excess code, which can help your pages load faster and work better in differ-
ent browsers.
After you use Dreamweaver to clean up Word HTML, you should not expect
to edit the file in Word again. The code may be cleaner, but depending on the
formatting options you’ve used, Word may no longer be able to read it.
Adobe GoLive
Adobe GoLive offers some great features for easy page design and a lot of
similarities to Dreamweaver, so you should have little if any trouble migrating
a site from GoLive to Dreamweaver.
30
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

If you have included any JavaScript actions in your pages using GoLive, you
may not be able to edit them in Dreamweaver, but the actions should still
work when the page displays in a browser. Likewise, CSS and other Dynamic
HTML features created in GoLive do not always work well in Dreamweaver
unless you know how to edit the code manually. If your page contains any
actions or DTHML features, you may find re-creating the page in
Dreamweaver your best option.
Not long before the writing of this book, Adobe purchased Macromedia and
although, to date, no announcement has been made about changes to GoLive,
I imagine that both GoLive and Dreamweaver are likely to see changes in the
future that will either make them more compatible or make one of them obso-
lete. I’m betting on Dreamweaver, not only because I’m the author of this
book, but because it has the largest market share; but it’s hard to predict
what will happen to GoLive, which is also a strong Web design program.
Other HTML editors
In the early days of the Web, lots of different visual HTML editors were being
used. Today only a few major ones are left. The few that I discuss here seem
to capture most of the market. Still, you may find yourself inheriting sites
built in really old editors such as Claris HomePage, or Symantec VisualPage.
Each of these programs present fewer problems than either Frontpage or
GoLive because they aren’t capable of creating the complex, high-end fea-
tures that are hardest to migrate from one program to another.
For the most part, you can open any HTML page with Dreamweaver and con-
tinue developing it with little concern. If you run into problems, remember
that you always have the option of re-creating the page from scratch in
Dreamweaver — a sure way to get rid of any unwanted code. You may also
want to use the Dreamweaver Clean Up XHTML feature to identify poten-
tially problematic code. To use this feature, choose Commands➪Clean Up
XHTML and then select the elements you want to alter in the Clean Up 
HTML dialog box.
No matter what program your site is originally created in, as you consider
how best to convert your work into Dreamweaver, pay special attention to
unusual code output, nonstandard rules about HTML tags and syntax, and
sophisticated features such as CSS, Dynamic HTML, and sophisticated pro-
gramming, such as ASP, Java, or CGI scripts. These Web page elements are
most likely to cause problems when you import them into Dreamweaver.

Chapter 2
Setting Up a Web Site 
with Dreamweaver
In This Chapter
 Building a new site
 Making new pages
 Creating links
 Getting your Web site online
I
f you’re ready to dive in and start building your Web site, you’ve come to
the right place. In this chapter, you find what you to need to start building
a Web site whether you are working on an existing Web site or creating a new
one. First you discover an important preliminary step — site setup, which
enables Dreamweaver to keep track of the images, links, and other elements
in your site. Then, you get into the fun stuff, creating your first page and
adding images and text.
Before you start creating or editing individual pages, setting up your site
using the site-management features in Dreamweaver is really important.
Whether you’re creating a new site or working on an existing site, follow the
steps in the next section to get Dreamweaver ready to manage the site for
you. The site-management features enable Dreamweaver to keep track of the
elements in your site, automatically create links, update your server, and
even manage a team of developers. With the enhancements in this latest ver-
sion, all these features are even more powerful and easy to use.
You can use Dreamweaver without doing this initial site setup, but many of
the features — such as automated link checking and the capability to store
commonly used elements in the Library — won’t work.

Setting Up a New or Existing Site
The site-management features in Dreamweaver are designed to ensure that
everything works properly in your Web site by making certain that links con-
nect and files and folders are placed correctly on your hard drive. If you don’t
do site setup, you risk breaking links between pages. The site setup process
also gets you ready to use Dreamweaver’s file transferring tools, including FTP
capabilities (File Transfer Protocol). These tools facilitate the transfer of your
pages to and from your local computer to your Web server. Dreamweaver also
includes special features that help track and manage updates to your server
anytime you make changes to your site.
As you go through the site setup process, you start by telling Dreamweaver
which folder on your hard drive is the one that you use to store all the files
and folders for your Web site. You need to keep all the files and folders for
your site in one main folder because when you finish building your site and
upload it to your Web server, the individual pages, images, and other ele-
ments must remain in the same relative location on the Web server as they
are on your hard drive, and that’s most easily accomplished by storing them
all in one main folder.
If this setup seems a little confusing to you, don’t worry; it’s a quick easy
process and as long as you keep all the files of your Web site in one main
folder, you’ll be fine. Just trust me; don’t skip this first step.
When you use site setup for a new Web site, Dreamweaver by default creates
a new folder on your hard drive to ensure that you save all the pages and
other elements of your site in one place. If you prefer, you can change the
location of that folder or create a new one yourself. 
If you’re working on an existing site, you follow the same steps for site setup,
but instead of creating a new folder, you direct Dreamweaver to the folder
that contains the existing site.
If you’re an experienced Web designer and just want to make quick changes
to a site or use the FTP features to access files on a server without doing the
site setup steps, Dreamweaver does enable you to use these features without
completing site setup. To access FTP features and set them up quickly, choose
Site➪Manage Sites and then choose New➪FTP & RDS Server from the Manage
Sites dialog box. This shortcut enables you to work directly on your server
using FTP & RDS Server; but Dreamweaver does not manage link checking,
and none of the other site-management features work.
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used for copying files to and from computers
connected across a network, such as the Internet. FTP is the protocol you use
to send your Web pages to your Web server when you’re ready to publish
your site on the Web. 
34
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

Defining a site
The following steps walk you through the process of using the Site Definition
dialog box to define your site. Whether you create a new site or work on an
existing Web site, this first step is important to your Web design work because
you identify your site structure, which enables Dreamweaver to set links and
effectively handle many of the site-management features explained in later
chapters.
If you want to work on an existing site that is on a remote Web server, follow
the steps in the sidebar, “Downloading an existing Web site,” later in this
chapter.
To define a site using the Site Definition dialog box, follow these steps.
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites.
The Manage Sites dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-1.
2. Click the New button and then select Site.
The Site Definition dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-2. 
3. Click the Advanced tab.
The Advanced window appears. If you prefer, you can use the Basic
wizard that steps you through the setup process, but I find it easier to
understand what’s happening when I can view all the options at once on
the Advanced tab.
4. Make sure that the Local Info category is selected in the Category box.
Figure 2-1:
The

Sites dialog
box keeps a

35
Chapter 2: Setting Up a Web Site with Dreamweaver

5. In the Site Name text box, type a name for your site.
You can call your site whatever you like; this name is only used for you
to keep track of your sites. Many people work on more than one site in
Dreamweaver so the program includes a way to name and keep track of
them. After you name it here, the name appears as an option on the
drop-down list in the Files panel. You use this list to select the site you
want to work on when you open Dreamweaver. In the example shown in
Figure 2-2, I named the new site I created “Your Dream Site.”
6. Click the Browse button (it resembles a file folder) next to the Local
Root Folder text box to locate the folder on your hard drive that con-
tains your Web site.
If you’re working on a new site, create a new folder and designate that as
the location of your site in Dreamweaver. If you’re working an existing
site, select the folder that contains the files for that site.
7. If Refresh Local File List Automatically isn’t already selected, click to
place a check mark in the box next to this option if you want
Dreamweaver to automatically update the list of all the new pages you
add to your site.
This feature helps Dreamweaver work more efficiently by speeding the
process of tracking and identifying files in your site.
Figure 2-2:
The Site
Definition
dialog box
enables you

a new or

36
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

8. Specify the Default Images folder by entering the location or using the
Browse button to locate it.
You do not have to identify an images folder, but it’s another way
Dreamweaver helps keep track of things for you. If you store images in
more than one folder, you can leave this box blank. If you’re setting up a
new site, you can create a new folder inside your site folder and identify
that as your images folder, even if it is empty. (You find more information
about images in Chapter 5.)
9. Type the URL of your Web site in the HTTP Address text box.
The HTTP Address is the URL, or Web address, that your site will have
when published on a Web server. If you do not yet know the Web
address for your site or you do not plan to publish it on a Web server,
you can leave this box blank. Include the http:// at the beginning, and
a / at the end.
10. Check the Use Case-Sensitive Link Checking box.
Unless you know for sure that you don’t have to worry about the case of
your filenames, have Dreamweaver help you enforce the case sensitivity
of your site’s links. (See Chapter 3 for more on file naming.)
11. Check the Enable Cache option.
Dreamweaver creates a local cache of your site to quickly reference the
location of files in your site. The local cache speeds up many of the site-
management features of the program and takes only a few seconds to
create. 
12. Click OK to close the Site Definition dialog box.
If you haven’t checked the Enable Cache option, a message box appears
asking whether you want to create a cache for the site. Figure 2-2 shows
what the Site Definition dialog box looks like when all the areas in the
Local Info section are filled in.
Setting up Web server access for FTP
To make your life simpler, Dreamweaver incorporates FTP capability so that
you can easily upload your pages to a Web server. This feature also enables
Dreamweaver to help you keep track of changes you make to files on your
hard drive and to ensure that they match the files on your Web server.
You enter information about the Web server where your site will be published
on the Remote Info page of the Site Definition dialog box. You access this page
by selecting Remote Info in the Category box on the left side of the Site Defini-
tion dialog box. The Remote Info page opens on the right side of the box, as
shown in Figure 2-3.
37
Chapter 2: Setting Up a Web Site with Dreamweaver

You can find several options in the Remote Info section on the Access drop-
down list. In the following section, you find instructions on how to set up FTP
access, which is the second choice on the drop-down list. If you aren’t going
to publish your site on a server, choose None from the drop-down list and go
on to the next section. If you’re going to send your site to a server located on
your local network, choose Local/Network; then use the Browse button to
specify that server’s location on your network. The other options — WebDAV,
RDS, and Microsoft Visual SourceSafe — are advanced options that you don’t
need to worry about if you’re working on a site you’ll host on a commercial
service provider. (You can find more about working with these advanced
options in Chapters 13, 14, and 15.) 
The most common way to publish a Web site after you develop it is to use
FTP to send the site to a remote server, such as those offered by commercial
Internet service providers. If that is how you’re going to publish your site,
follow the upcoming steps, and you’ll be all set when you’re ready to publish
your Web site.
If you don’t have your server information, or you’re anxious to start building
your site on your own hard drive first, you can skip this part of the setup
process and come back to it when you’re ready to publish your site.
Figure 2-3:
The Site
Definition
dialog box

information

38
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

You need the following information to set up the FTP option in Dreamweaver.
If you’re using a remote server, such as an Internet service provider, ask your
provider for the following information:
 FTP host name
 Path for the Web directory
 FTP login
 FTP password
Choose FTP from the Access drop-down list in the Remote Info page of the
Site Definition dialog box (refer to Figure 2-3), and follow these steps:
1. In the FTP Host text box, type the hostname of your Web server.
It should look something like ftp.host.com or shell.host.com or
ftp.domain.com, depending on your server. (In my example, I used
ftp.yourdreamsite.com.)
2. In the Host Directory text box, type the directory on the remote site
in which documents visible to the public are stored (also known as
the site root).
It should look something like public/html/ or www/public/docs/.
Again, this depends on your server.
3. In the Login and Password text boxes, type the login name and pass-
word required to gain access to your Web server. If you check the
Save box, Dreamweaver stores the information and automatically sup-
plies it to the server when you connect to the remote site.
This is your unique login and password information that provides you
access to your server. 
Click the Test button to make sure that you’ve entered everything cor-
rectly. If there are no problems, Dreamweaver responds with a box saying
Dreamweaver connected to your Web server successfully.
4. Put a check mark in the Use Passive FTP or Use Firewall options only
if your service provider or site administrator instructs you to do so.
If you aren’t on a network but you do use a commercial service provider,
you should not need to check either option.
5. Click OK to save your Web Server Info settings and close the Site
Definition dialog box.
If you want to continue reviewing the settings in other categories, choose
Testing Server, Design Notes, Site Map Layout, File View Columns, or Con-
tribute from the Category box on the left side of the screen. (You can find
more information on these categories in Chapter 4.)

Downloading an existing Web site
If you want to work on an existing Web site and
you don’t already have a copy of it on your local
computer’s hard drive, you can use Dream-
weaver to download any or all the files in the
site so that you can edit the existing pages, add
new pages, or use any of Dreamweaver’s other
features to check links and manage the site’s
further development. The first step is to get a
copy of the site onto your computer by down-
loading it from the server.
To download an existing Web site, follow these
steps:
1. Create a new folder on your computer to
store the existing site.
2. Specify this folder as the local root folder
for the site with the Dreamweaver site
setup features.
Check out the section “Defining a site,” ear-
lier in this chapter, if you’re not sure how to
do this.
3. Set up the Remote Info dialog box.
I explain how to do this in the “Setting up
Web server access for FTP” section, earlier
in this chapter.
4. Connect to the remote site by clicking the
Connects to Remote Host button, which
looks like the ends of two cables, in the
Files panel.
5. Click the Get Files button, which looks like
a down arrow, to download the entire site
to your local drive.
Sometimes your Web host has files on the
remote server that you don’t need to down-
load. If you want to download only specific
files or folders from the site, select those files
or folders in the Remote Site pane of the Files
panel, and click the Get Files button. Dream-
weaver automatically duplicates some or all
the remote site’s structure, meaning the fold-
ers in the site but not all the files within them,
and places the downloaded files in the cor-
rect part of the site hierarchy. Re-creating
the folder structure on your local computer
is important because Dreamweaver needs
to know the location of the files as they
relate to other parts of the site in order to set
links properly. The safest option is to down-
load the entire site; but if you are working on
a really large Web project, downloading a
part and duplicating the structure enables
you to work on a section of the site without
downloading all of it.
If you are working on only one page or sec-
tion of a site, you should generally choose
to include dependent files, meaning any
files linked from those pages, to ensure that
links set properly when you make changes.
6. After you download the site or specific
files or folders, you can edit them as you do
any other file in Dreamweaver.

Creating New Pages
Every Web site begins with a single page. Visitors are first greeted by the
front page — or home page — of your site, and that’s usually a good place to
start building. Dreamweaver makes building a home page easy: When the pro-
gram opens, you see a Start Screen with shortcuts to many handy features for
creating new pages. 
If you want to create a simple, blank Web page, choose HTML from the Create
New list in the middle row (see Figure 2-4). If you are creating a dynamic site,
you may choose ColdFusion, PHP, or one of the ASP options. (If you don’t
even know what those options mean, you probably won’t need to use them,
but you can find some information about these advanced options in Chapters
13, 14, and 15.)
Get in the habit of saving new Web pages into your main Web site folder as
soon as you create them, even though they are still blank. As you create links
or add images to your pages, Dreamweaver needs to be able to identify the
location of your page, and it can’t do that until you save the page.

The Start
Screen

a list of
shortcuts to

files or open

41
Chapter 2: Setting Up a Web Site with Dreamweaver

If the Start Screen is not visible because you have an existing page already
open or you’ve opted not to show it, follow these steps to create a new page:
1. Choose File➪New. 
2. Select Basic Page from the Category list. 
3. Select HTML from the Basic Page list.
4. Choose File➪Save to save your page.
You find many other options in the Dreamweaver New Document window,
including a wide range of predesigned templates. For now, don’t worry
about all those. In this chapter, you start off by creating a simple blank
page. You find instructions for working with templates in Chapter 4.
Make sure you add a page title to each of your pages. You can add a page title
by changing the text in the Title box on the Document toolbar. By default,
Dreamweaver inserts the words Untitled Page into the Title box, but you
can put any text you want in this box. The page title doesn’t appear in the
body of your Web page, but it’s important because this text appears at the
top of the browser window, usually just to the right of the name of the
browser. This text also appears in a user’s list of Favorites or Bookmarks
when that user bookmarks your site.
Naming Web Pages
When you save Web pages, images, and other files in your site, you need to
be careful what you name them and you need to include an extension at the
end to identify the file type (such as .html for HTML files or .gif for GIF
images). Dreamweaver automatically adds the extension to the end of HTML
files, but you can change preferences to use either .html or .htm. In theory,
these extensions are interchangeable, but some servers read only .html so
that’s the safer bet. 
Filenames in Web sites get incorporated into links and links are easier to
manage when they don’t include spaces or special characters. For example you
shouldn’t name a Web page with an apostrophe, such as cat’s page.html. If
you want to separate words, use the underscore (_) or the hyphen (-). For
example, cat-page.html is a fine filename. Numbers are fine and capital let-
ters don’t really matter, as long as the filename and the link match, which
Dreamweaver takes care of for you when you create links (just be careful if you
ever create a link in the HTML code). 
One of the most confusing and important filename rules in Web design is that
the main page (or the front page) of your Web site must be called index.html.
That’s because most servers are set up to serve the index.html page first.
(Although some servers also serve other filenames, such as home.html, or
default.asp on dynamic sites, most prioritize and serve index.html before
42
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

all others.) If you want to ensure that your visitors see the right page when
their browsers arrive at your Web site, make sure the front page of your site
is named index.html. After that, you can name your files anything you like,
as long as they don’t include special characters or spaces.
Designing your first page
Many people are pleasantly surprised by how easily you can create a basic
Web page in Dreamweaver.
If you’re ready to plunge right in, create a page and click to insert your cursor
at the top of the blank page (see the earlier section “Creating New Pages” if
you need to start from the beginning). Type some text on the page, anything
you like; you just need something to get started. If you’re having trouble
being creative today, try typing My husband David is so cool. (Okay, so
I’m guilty of trying to win cheap points with my husband; but trust me, this is
a great trick if you want your spouse, partner, or other significant person in
your life to be interested when you show off your first Web page. Simply
enter your special person’s name in place of mine and you’re on your way to
creating a site he or she is sure to appreciate.) 
Although you may be tempted to use the basic formatting options I cover in
this chapter, if you’re doing a lot of formatting on a site, you can save consid-
erable time using Cascading Style Sheets instead. With CSS you can define
styles for things such as headlines, and apply multiple formatting options all
at once. You can also change styles and alter the formatting everywhere it’s
applied. Chapter 8 covers CSS in detail.
43
Chapter 2: Setting Up a Web Site with Dreamweaver
Creating multiple pages to set links
Creating a new page to start a Web site may
seem obvious, but consider this: You may want
to create a bunch of new pages before you get
too far in your development, and you may even
want to start organizing the new pages in sub-
directories before you have anything on them.
Doing so enables you to organize the structure
of your site before you start setting links. After
all, you can’t link to a page that doesn’t exist. If
you plan to have five links on your front page to
other pages in your site, go ahead and create
those other pages, even if you don’t put any-
thing on them yet.
For example, say you’re creating a site for your
department at a big company. You’re likely to
want a few main pages, such as a page about
your staff, another about what you do, and a
third with general information and resources. At
this initial stage, you could create four pages —
one for the front page of the site and three
others for each of the subsections. With these
initial pages in place, you benefit from having an
early plan for organizing the site, and you can
start setting links among the main pages right
away. See Chapter 3 for more tips about Web
site planning and organization.

Creating a headline
Most Web pages have some kind of headline at the top of the page. To make
your headline bold, centered, and a large font size, follow these steps:
1. Highlight the text you want to format.
2. In the Properties inspector at the bottom of the page, select the B icon
to make the selected text bold.
The heading becomes bold. 
3. In the Properties inspector at the bottom of the page, select the 
center icon.
The text automatically centers. 
4. In the Properties inspector, use the Size drop-down list and select 36.
The text changes to font size 36, and you have a headline at the top of
your page that looks something like the headline shown in Figure 2-5. 
In general, I find the Properties inspector the easiest way to apply basic format-
ting, but some people prefer using the drop-down lists from the Text menu bar.
Both achieve the same results with the exception that Dreamweaver features
font sizes in the Properties inspector (listed as sizes 9 through 36 and xx-small
through xx-large) but offers only the capability to increase or decrease font size
from the Text menu.
You can collapse the panels on the right side of the work area by clicking the
small tab on the side of the panel set. In the following figures, I collapsed the
panels in the figures in the rest of this chapter to create more room in the
Workspace.
44
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 
Inserting text from another program
If you have text in another program, such as
Microsoft Word or Excel, you can copy and
paste that text into your Dreamweaver page and
even keep the formatting. The Edit menu has
two paste options: Paste and Paste Special. If
you use the simple Paste option, the content you
paste loses any formatting and appears on your
page as plain text. If you choose Paste Special,
you have several options that enable you to
maintain some or all the formatting applied to
the text in the program you copied it from. Just
click to select the radio button that corresponds
to the formatting you want to preserve, and
Dreamweaver automatically applies that for-
matting to the text as it is inserted into your
page.

Indenting text
Type a little more text after your headline text. (I added a few nice things
about meeting and marrying my husband — call me sentimental if you must.)
A single sentence is all you need, but you can add as much as text as you like.
To indent that text, follow these steps:
1. Highlight the text you want to indent.
2. Choose Text➪Indent.
The text automatically indents. Alternatively, you can use the Text
Indent and Text Outdent icons in the Properties inspector.
If you want to continue adding text and you don’t want to indent it, choose
Text➪Outdent to transition back to plain text mode without the indent. You
can also use the small Indent and Outdent icons located at the bottom of the
Properties inspector, just to the left of the Target field.
If you just want to indent a short paragraph or two, the Indent option is ideal.
If, however, you want to create the effect of a narrower column of text on a
page, you may find that putting your text in an HTML table is a better option
because you can better control the width of the column. You can find infor-
mation about creating HTML tables in Chapter 6. You can also achieve similar
results using layers, which Chapter 9 covers.

Chapter 2: Setting Up a Web Site with Dreamweaver

Changing fonts and text sizes
You can change font and text sizes for the entire page or for selections of
text. You find instructions on making global changes in the following section
“Changing Page Properties.” To change the font face and font size for a
selected section of text, follow these steps:
1. Highlight the text you want to change.
2. In the Properties inspector at the bottom of the work area, select a
collection of fonts from the Font drop-down list.
The selected text changes to the font you selected.
You can also choose the Edit Font list option and use any font, but beware
that the font you apply displays on your visitor’s computer only if that
font is on the hard drive. (See sidebar, “Why so many fonts?” for more
about how this works.
3. In the Properties inspector at the bottom of the work area, specify the
size you want your text from the Size drop-down list.
Font sizes in HTML are different from the font sizes you may be used to
using in a word processing or image program. Your size options are
more limited, and you have the added choices of small, x-small, and so
on. The numbered font sizes work much like those you may be used to,
but the options specified by words like small, medium, or large display
according to the settings of a user’s browser. In general, using the num-
bered sizes gives you more predictable results.
You find many more text formatting options in the Properties inspector, 
Text menu, and Text Insert bar. Go ahead, experiment a little; you can always
undo your formatting choices or change them again if you don’t like the way
they look.
Adding images
Now for the fun part. Adding an image to your Web page may seem almost
magical at first because it is so simple with Dreamweaver. The challenge with
Web graphics is not adding them to your pages, but creating good-looking
images that load quickly in your viewer’s browser. You need another pro-
gram, such as Photoshop or Fireworks, to create, convert, and edit images.
Dreamweaver just lets you place the images on your page. 
For more information on finding and creating images, as well as keeping file
sizes small, see Chapter 5. For now, I assume that you have a GIF or JPEG
image file ready, and that you want to insert your image into your page. The
46
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

two most common image formats you can use on your Web page are GIF and
JPEG (which is often shortened to JPG). You can use any image on your Web
site, as long as it’s in GIF or JPEG format.
If you don’t have an image handy and want one to practice the following exer-
cise with, you can download a free JPEG from my Web site at www.Digital
Family.com/free (you find instructions for downloading images in Chapter 5).
Most browsers also support BMP, but most designers never use it because
BMP files don’t optimize as well. PNG is also an accepted image format on the
Web, but Web designers rarely use it because Internet Explorer for Windows
has not supported PNG fully. Unless you have a compelling reason to use one
of these formats, you’ll do well to stick with JPEG and GIF.
You need to do two important things before inserting an image on a Web
page: Save the page and ensure the image is in the proper folder. Saving your
page in your Web site’s folder on your hard drive is important because
Dreamweaver can’t properly set the link to your image until it identifies the
relative locations of the page and the image.
47
Chapter 2: Setting Up a Web Site with Dreamweaver
Why so many fonts?
Although you can specify any font you want for
text on your Web pages, you don’t have com-
plete control over how that font appears on your
visitor’s computer. That’s because the font can
only display if your visitor has the font on his or
her hard drive. To help ensure your text appears
as you intend, Dreamweaver offers collections
of similar fonts, such as Arial, Helvetica, sans-
serif, or Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif. 
Here’s how it works. When you apply a collec-
tion of fonts like these, the browser displays the
formatted text in the first font available on that
list. For example, if you choose the font collec-
tion that starts with Georgia and your visitors
don’t have Georgia, the text displays in Times
New Roman; if they don’t have that font, it dis-
plays in Times; and if they don’t even have
Times, then the browser looks for another serif
font. (In case you’re not familiar with font terms,
serif is used to describe fonts such as Times
that have those little curly things on the edges of
letters; sans serif means no curly things, which
is what you get with a font such as Arial.)
You can create your own font collections by
selecting the Edit Font List option. The collection
of fonts included in Dreamweaver represents
some of the most common fonts and thus the ones
most likely to appear on any user’s computer.
The only way to ensure that text appears in the
font you want is to create the text as a graphic
in a program such as Photoshop or Fireworks
and then insert the graphic with the text into
your page. That’s not a bad option for special
text, such as banners or logos; but it’s usually
not a good option for all your text because
graphics take longer to download than text and
harder to update later.

For this same reason, you need to make sure that the image file is in your
main Web site folder (the folder you identified in the site setup process at the
beginning of this chapter). Many designers create a folder called images so
they can keep all their image files in one place. If you are working on a very
large site, you may want an images folder within each of the main folders of
the site. An important thing to remember is that if you move the page or
image to another folder after you place the image on your page, you risk
breaking the link between the page and the image, and an ugly broken image
icon appears when you view your page in a browser. 
If you move files or folders in the Dreamweaver Files panel, it keeps the links
up to date, but if you move them outside of Dreamweaver, the links break. If
for some reason you do end up breaking an image link, simply click the
broken image icon that appears in its place, and use the Browse button in the
Properties inspector to find the image and replace it on your page. 
Okay, assuming you’ve saved your page and the image you want to link is
saved within your main Web site folder, you’re ready to follow these steps to
place an image on your Web page:
1. Click the Image icon located on the Common Insert bar at the top of
the work area and choose Image from the drop-down list. (Hint: The
icon looks like a small tree.) 
The Image dialog box opens.
2. Click the Select button.
The Select Image Source dialog box opens, displaying files and folders
on your hard drive.
3. Navigate to the folder that has the image you want to insert.
4. Double-click to select the image you want.
The image automatically appears on your Web page.
If you haven’t already saved your page, a warning box appears to tell
you that Dreamweaver cannot properly set the link to the image until
you save the page. You see this message because Dreamweaver needs to
know the location of the HTML page relative to the image to create the
link. If you see this box, you have two options. You can click Cancel, save
your page by choosing File➪Save, and then repeat the preceding steps.
Or, you can go ahead and choose the image, and after you save your file,
Dreamweaver tries to automatically update the image link.
If you’ve already saved your page, another common problem is that the
image is not located within your main Web site folder. Dreamweaver
offers you the option of creating a copy of the image in your main site
folder. Click the Yes button if you want Dreamweaver to copy the image
to your root folder (this helps ensure the image transfers to your server
correctly when you upload your site to your server).
48
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

5. Click the image on your Web page to display the image options in the
Properties inspector at the bottom of the page.
Use the Properties inspector to specify image attributes, such as align-
ment, horizontal, and vertical spacing, and alternative text. (The image
properties are visible in the Properties inspector in Figure 2-6.)
With an image selected, the Properties inspector enables you to specify
many attributes for an image. Table 2-1 describes those attributes. If you
don’t see all the attributes listed in the table on your screen, click the
triangle in the bottom-right corner of the Properties inspector to reveal
all the image options.
Although you can resize an image in Dreamweaver by clicking and dragging
on the edge of the image or by changing the Height and Width values in the
Properties inspector, I don’t recommend you change an image size this way.
Changing the height and width in the Properties inspector won’t actually
change the size of the image, just the way it displays on the page. That’s a
problem for two reasons. First, using this option to make an image look
bigger often leads to the image looking distorted; second, using this option to
make an image look smaller requires your visitor to download a larger file
than necessary.

Chapter 2: Setting Up a Web Site with Dreamweaver

You’re almost always better off using Dreamweaver’s new auto resizing and
cropping functions or using an image editor to change the physical size of an
image. Because this is such a common thing to do, Dreamweaver includes a
few shortcuts that incorporate Fireworks image-editing capabilities and
enable you to edit an image in tandem with Dreamweaver. To edit an image in
Fireworks from within Dreamweaver, click to select the image and then click
the Fireworks icon (the yellow circle labeled FW in the Properties inspector)
to open the image in Fireworks. Edit the image in Fireworks and when you
save it, your changes are reflected in Dreamweaver. 
See Chapter 5 for more on working with images in Dreamweaver, such as the
built-in cropping tool and image map features. You can find instructions for
working with Fireworks in Chapter 10.

Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

Setting Links
Dreamweaver is truly a dream when setting links. The most important thing
to keep in mind is that a link is essentially an address (URL) that tells a
viewer’s browser what page to go to when the viewer clicks the text or image
containing the link.
Linking pages within your Web site
Linking from one page to another page in your Web site — known as a relative
or internal link — is easy. The most important thing to remember is to save
your pages in the folders that you want to keep them in before you start set-
ting links. Make sure that all your files are in the root folder, as described in
the section “Defining a site,” earlier in this chapter. Here’s how you create an
internal link:
1. In Dreamweaver, open the page on which you want to create a link.
2. Select the text or image that you want to serve as the link (meaning
the text or image that opens the new page when a user clicks it).
Click and drag to highlight text or click once to select an image.
53
Chapter 2: Setting Up a Web Site with Dreamweaver
Setting relative versus absolute links
If the page you want to link to is within your Web
site, you want to create a relative, or internal
link, that includes the path that describes how to
get from the current page to the linked page. A
relative link doesn’t need to include the domain
name of the server. Here’s an example of what
the code would look like if I created a relative
link to the books page on my own Web site:
<A HREF=”books/index.html”>Janine’s
Books</A>
If you link to a page on a different Web site, you
want to create an absolute, or external, link. An
absolute link does include the full Internet
address of the other site. Here’s an example of
what the code would look like behind an
absolute link if you created a link from your site
to the books page on my site:
<A
HREF=”http://www.jcwarner.com/b
ooks/index.html”>Janine’s
Books</A>
If all that HREF code stuff looks like Greek to
you, don’t worry. The following section shows
you how Dreamweaver allows you to set links
without even knowing what the code means.

3. Click the Browse button to the right of the Link text box in the
Properties inspector.
The Select File dialog box opens.
4. Click the filename to select the page that you want your image or text to
link to, and then click the OK button (Windows) or Choose button (Mac).
The link is automatically set and the dialog box closes. If you haven’t
already saved your page, a message box opens, explaining that you can
create a relative link only after you save the page. Always save the page
you’re working on before you set links. Note that to test your links, you
have to view your page in a browser, covered in the “Previewing Your
Page in a Browser,” section later in this chapter.
If the page is part of a frameset, use the Target field in the Properties
inspector to specify which frame the linked page opens into. (You find
out more about setting links in frames in Chapter 7.)
Setting links to named 
anchors within a page
If you like to create really long pages, using anchor links to break up naviga-
tion within the page is a good idea. A named anchor link, often called a jump
link, enables you to set a link to a specific part of a Web page. You can use a
named anchor to link from an image or text string on one page to another
place on the same page, or to link from one page to a specific part of a differ-
ent page. To create a named anchor link, you first insert a named anchor in
the place that you want to link to, and then use that anchor to direct the
browser to that specific part of the page when a viewer follows the link.
Suppose that you want to set a link from the word Convertible at the top of a
page to a section lower on the page that starts with the headline Convertible
Sports Cars. You first insert a named anchor at the Convertible Sports Cars head-
line. Then you link the word Convertible from the top of the page to that anchor.
To insert a named anchor and set a link to it, follow these steps:
1. Open the page on which you want to insert the named anchor.
2. Place your cursor next to the word or image that you want to link to
on the page.
You don’t need to select the word or image; you just need a reference
point that displays when the link is selected. For this example, I placed
the cursor to the left of the headline Convertible Sports Cars.
54
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

3. Choose Insert➪Named Anchor.
The Insert Named Anchor dialog box appears.
4. Enter a name for the anchor.
You can name anchors anything you want (as long as you don’t use
spaces or special characters). Just make sure that you use a different
name for each anchor on the same page. Then be sure that you remem-
ber what you called the anchor, because you have to type the anchor
name to set the link. (Unlike other Web design programs, Dreamweaver
doesn’t automatically enter the anchor name.) In this example, I chose
convertible as the anchor name because it’s easy for me to remember.
5. Click OK.
The dialog box closes, and a small anchor icon appears on the page
where you inserted the anchor name. You can move an anchor name by
clicking the anchor icon and dragging it to another location on the page.
If you’re curious about what this named anchor looks like in HTML,
here’s the code that appears before the headline in my example:
<A NAME=”convertible”></A>
6. To set a link to the named anchor location, select the text or image
that you want to link from.
You can link to a named anchor from anywhere else on the same page or
from another page. In my example, I linked from the word Convertible
that appears at the top of the page to the anchor I made next to the
headline.
7. In the Properties inspector, type the pound sign (#) followed by the
anchor name.
You can also select the text and drag a line from the Point to File icon
(next to the Link text box) to the anchor icon. The anchor name automat-
ically appears in the Link box, saving you from typing the name again.
In my example, I typed #convertible in the Link text box. The HTML
code for this line looks like this:
<A HREF=”#convertible”>Convertible</A>
If you want to link to an anchor named convertible on another page with
the filename coolcars.html, you type coolcars.html#convertible in
the Link text box.
When you create a text link, Dreamweaver includes a handy little drop-down
list beside the Link box, listing the most recent links you’ve created. To set a
link to the same page or Web site, just select it from the drop-down list.
Unfortunately, if you’re creating a link from an image, that handy drop-down
list is not available and you have to set the link by entering the URL manually
or using the Browser button to locate the page you want to link to.
55
Chapter 2: Setting Up a Web Site with Dreamweaver

Linking to pages outside your Web site
Linking to a page on another Web site — called an external link — is even
easier than linking to an internal link. All you need is the URL of the page to
which you want to link, and you’re most of the way there.
To create an external link, follow these steps:
1. In Dreamweaver, open the page from which you want to link.
2. Select the text or image that you want to act as a link.
3. In the Link text box in the Properties inspector, type the URL of the
page you want your text or image to link to.
The link is automatically set. (In the example in Figure 2-7, I created a link
to my site about family-oriented Web sites at www.digitalfamily.com.)
Although in most browsers, you don’t have to type the http:// at the begin-
ning of a Web site address to get to a site, you must always use the full URL,
including the http://, when you create an external link in HTML. Otherwise,
the browser can’t find the correct external site address and the visitor proba-
bly end ups on an error page. 
Setting a link to an e-mail address
Another common link option goes to an e-mail address. Visitors can send you
messages easily with e-mail links. I always recommend that you invite visitors
to contact you because they can point out mistakes in your site and give you
valuable feedback about how you can further develop your site.
Setting a link to an e-mail address is just as easy as setting a link to another
Web page. Before you start, you need to know the e-mail address to which
you want to link. The only other thing you need to know is that e-mail links
Figure 2-7:
Link text or
an image to
another
Web site. 
56
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

must begin with the code mailto: (no //). Here’s an example of the full line
of code behind an e-mail link:
<A HREF=”mailto:janine@jcwarner.com”>Send a message to
Janine</A>
When visitors to your Web site click an e-mail link, their browsers automati-
cally launch their associated e-mail programs and create a blank e-mail mes-
sage to the specified e-mail address. This is a cool trick, but it can be discon-
certing to your users if they don’t expect it to happen. That’s why I always
try to notify users when I use e-mail links by labeling them so that link clearly
goes to an e-mail address and not to another Web page.
To create an e-mail link in Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
1. In Dreamweaver, open the page on which you want to create an e-mail
link and insert your cursor where you want the link.
2. If you want to link a text block, highlight the text that you want to act
as the link.
3. Click the Email Link icon on the Common Insert bar at the top of the
screen. (It looks like a small envelope).
The Email Link dialog box opens. If you selected text before choosing
the Email Link icon, that text is automatically entered into the Text box
in the Email Link dialog box.
4. Enter or edit the text you want to represent the link on the page in the
Text box, and then enter the e-mail address (without mailto:) in the
Email box. 
The e-mail link is automatically set, and any text you added or edited
appears on the page. 
If you want to create a mailto link using a graphic, you can use the Properties
inspector. Click to select the image you want to link, and then type mailto:
followed by the e-mail address in the Link text area. Make sure you don’t add
any spaces between mailto: and the address. It should look like this:
mailto:name@domain.com.
Changing Page Properties
You can change many individual elements on a page in the Properties inspec-
tor, but if you want to make changes that affect the entire page, such as alter-
ing link or text colors, you need the Page Properties dialog box. Notice in
57
Chapter 2: Setting Up a Web Site with Dreamweaver

Figure 2-8 that the Page Properties dialog box also has a Category list and
that each of these sections reveals different page options. Some of these
options are covered in other parts of the book, such as the Tracing Image fea-
ture (Chapter 4), and the Background Image feature (Chapter 5). For now, to
keep things simple, this section focuses only on changing the background
and text colors available from the Appearance category, shown in Figure 2-8,
and the options in the Links category shown in Figure 2-9.
You can make global changes in the Page Properties dialog box, but you can
override those options using the individual formatting options within
Dreamweaver, which take precedence. For example, you could make all your
text purple in the Page Properties dialog box and then change the color of
some of your text to red using the Text Color swatch box in the Properties
dialog box.
To change the background and text colors on a page, follow these steps:
1. Choose Modify➪Page Properties.
The Appearance category of the Page Properties dialog box appears, as
shown in Figure 2-8.
2. Specify the fonts you want for the text on your page from the Page
Font drop-down list.
If you don’t specify a font, your text appears in the font specified in your
user’s browser, which is usually Times.

58
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

3. Click the B or I to the right of the Page Font drop-down list if you want
all the text on your page to appear bold or italic.
If you select one of these options, all your text appears bold or italic
unless you specify other formatting options using the individual text 
formatting options in Dreamweaver.
4. Specify the font size you want for the text on your page with the Size
drop-down list.
Again, you can override these settings by changing the text size using
the individual formatting options in Dreamweaver. 
5. Click the Text Color swatch box to reveal the color palette. Choose
any color you like. 
The color you select fills the color swatch box, but will not change the
text color on your page until you click the Apply or OK button. 
6. Click the Background Color swatch box to reveal the color palette.
Choose any color you like.
The color you selected fills the color swatch box. The color does not fill
the background until you click the Apply or OK button. 
7. Click the Browse button next to Background Image box if you want to
insert a graphic or photograph into the background of your page.
When you insert a background image it automatically repeats or tiles
across and down the page unless you choose the no-repeat option from
the Repeat drop-down list.
8. Use the margin options at the bottom of the dialog box to change the
left, right, top, or bottom margins of your page.
9. Click the Apply button to see how the colors look on your page. Click
OK to finish and close the Page Properties dialog box.
When you change the background, text, or link colors make sure the colors
look good together and that your text is still readable. As a general rule, a
light background color works best with a dark text color and vice versa.
To change the link color and underline options, follow these steps:
1. Choose Modify➪Page Properties.
The Page Properties dialog box appears.
2. Select the Links option from the Category list.
The Links page opens, as shown in Figure 2-9.
59
Chapter 2: Setting Up a Web Site with Dreamweaver

3. Specify the fonts you want for the links on your page from the Link
Font drop-down list.
If you don’t specify a font, your links appear in the font specified for the
general text of your document, or if that’s not set, the font specified in
your user’s browser, which is usually Times. 
4. Click the B or I to the right of the Links Font drop-down list if you
want all the links on your page to appear bold or italic.
If you select one of these options, all your links appear bold or italic
unless you specify other formatting options using the individual format-
ting options in Dreamweaver.
5. Specify the font size you want for the links on your page from the Size
drop-down list.
Again, you can override these settings by changing the text size using
the individual formatting options in Dreamweaver. 
6. Click the Link Color swatch box to reveal the color palette. Choose
any color you like.
The color you selected is applied to links on your page. Notice that there
are four link color options: 
Link: Specify the color a link appears if a user hasn’t visited its
destination page. 
Visited Links: This color is used for links pointing to pages that a
visitor has already visited.
Rollover Links: A link changes to this color when a user rolls a
cursor over the link (also known as hovering).
Active Link: A link changes to this color briefly while a user is
clicking it.

60
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

7. Specify if you want your links underlined from the Underline drop-
down list. 
By default, all links on a Web page appear underlined in a browser, but
many designers find that distracting and opt to turn off underlining by
selecting Never Underline. You can also choose Show Underline Only on
Rollover to make the underline appear when users moves their cursors
over the link, or Hide Underline on Rollover to make the underline disap-
pear when users moves their cursors over a link.
8. Click the Apply button to see how the colors look on your page. Click
OK to finish and close the Page Properties dialog box.
Adding Meta Tags for Search Engines
If you’ve heard of Meta tags, you probably associate them with search engines,
and you’d be right. Meta tags are used for a variety of things, but the most
common is to provide special text that doesn’t appear on your page, but does
get read by crawlers, bots, and other programs that scour the Web cataloging
and ranking Web pages for sites such as Yahoo!, Google, and AltaVista.
Search engines read two common Meta tags — keyword tags and description
tags. The first enables site designers to include a list of keywords they would
like to be matched to in a search engine. Unfortunately, Meta keywords have
been so abused and used to mislead visitors that most search engines no
longer give them any weight when ranking pages. At least one search engine,
Inktomi, is still using Meta keywords at the time of this writing, and you cer-
tainly won’t hurt your ranking by using them, but they don’t offer the benefits
they once did.
The Meta description tag, however, is still widely used and is definitely worth
your time. This tag is designed to let you include a written description of your
Web site and is often used by search engines as the brief description that
appears in search results pages. If you don’t include your own text in a Meta
description tag, most search engines use the first several words that appear
on your front page; but depending on your design, the first few words may not
be the best description of your site — they’re just as likely to be your site’s
top navigation. Indeed, if you’ve ever wondered why the descriptions of some
Web sites seem so random or disjointed in search engines, that’s why.
To make sure your site looks good in search engine results, follow these steps
to use the Meta description tag:
1. Open the page on which you want to add your Meta description.
You can use Meta descriptions on any or all the pages on your Web site
(some search engines link directly to internal pages on your site if they
61
Chapter 2: Setting Up a Web Site with Dreamweaver

match a search), but the most important thing is to add a description to
the main page of your site.
2. Switch to the HTML Insert bar by selecting HTML from the Insert Bar
drop-down list, as shown in Figure 2-10.
If you have set the Insert bar to display as tabs, click the HTML tab to
open it.
3. Click the small arrow next to the Head icon and choose Description.
The Description dialog box opens.
4. Enter the text you want for your page description in the Description
field in the Description dialog box.
Don’t use any HTML in this box.
5. Click OK.
The description text you entered is inserted into the HTML code.
If you want to add keywords, repeat Steps 1 through 5, selecting the
Keywords option from the Head icon drop-down list in Step 3.

Previewing Your Page in a Browser
Although Dreamweaver displays Web pages much like a Web browser, not all
of the interactive features you can add to a Web page function from
Dreamweaver’s work area. For example, links won’t work in Dreamweaver. To
test your links and verify that your page is displaying the way you intended,
you need to preview your work in a Web browser. 
The simplest way to preview your work is to save the page you are working
on and then click the Preview/Debug in Browser icon located at the top right
of the Workspace (it looks like a small globe).
When you install Dreamweaver, it automatically finds a browser on your com-
puter and sets it up so that when you click this button, you launch the browser.
If you want to test your work in more than one browser, you can add more
options to the list by choosing Edit➪Preferences and then choosing Preview 
in Browser from the Category list (on a Mac, you choose Dreamweaver➪
Preferences). Use the plus sign at the top of the screen to add any browsers on
your hard drive to the Browser list.
Putting Your Web Site Online
In the section “Setting Up a New or Existing Site,” earlier in this chapter, I show
you how to set up a site and enter the address, login name, and password for
your server. In this section, I show you how to put pages on your server and
retrieve them by using the built-in FTP capabilities of Dreamweaver.
To transfer files between your hard drive and a remote server, follow these
steps:
1. Make sure you defined your site, as described in the “Setting Up a
New or Existing Site” section in the beginning of this chapter and
make sure that that the site you set up is open and displayed in the
Files panel. You can open an existing site by choosing Window➪Files
and then selecting the site.
If you do this properly, the files and folders of your site become visible
on the Files tab of the Files panel on the right side of the work area. (See
Figure 2-11.)
63
Chapter 2: Setting Up a Web Site with Dreamweaver

2. Click the Connects to Remote Host button in the top left of the Files
panel (it looks like a small, blue electrical plug).
If you’re not already connected to the Internet, the Connects to Remote
Host button starts your dialup connection. If you have trouble connecting
this way, try establishing your Internet connection as you usually do to
check e-mail or surf the Web; then return to Dreamweaver and click the
Connects to Remote Host button after establishing your Internet connec-
tion. When your computer is online, Dreamweaver should have no trouble
establishing an FTP connection with your host server automatically.
If you still have trouble establishing a connection to your Web server,
refer to the section, “Setting up Web server access for FTP,” earlier in
this chapter and make sure that you specified the server information
correctly. If you still have trouble, contact your service provider or site
administrator to ensure you have all the correct information for con-
necting to your server. Getting all this information set up correctly the
first time can be tricky, and each service provider is different. The good
news is that, once you get this right, Dreamweaver saves your settings
so it connects automatically the next time.
After you establish the connection, the directories on your server
appear in the Files panel. You can move between views in this panel by
Figure 2-11:
The Files tab
of the Files
panel
features a
row of
buttons
across the
top that
control FTP
functions.
64
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

choosing from the drop-down list at the top right (refer to Figure 2-11).
The main options are Local View, which displays files on your local hard
drive, and Remote View, which displays files on the server. 
3. To upload a file (transfer a file from your hard drive to your Web
server), select the file from the Local View panel (which shows the
files on your hard drive) and click the Put Files icon (the up arrow) in
the Files panel.
The files automatically copy to your server when you transfer them. You
can select multiple files or folders to be transferred simultaneously. 
After you upload files to you server, test your work by using a Web
browser to view them online. Sometimes things that look and work fine
on your computer (such as links) won’t work on the server.
4. To download files or folders (transfer files or folders from your Web
server to your hard drive), select the files or folders from the Remote
View panel, (which shows the files on your server) and click the Get
Files button (the down arrow) in the Files panel.
The files automatically copy to your hard drive when you transfer them.
Beware that when you copy files to or from your server, the file you’re
transferring overwrites the files that are already at the destination.
Dreamweaver notifies you about the overwriting if it notices you’re
replacing a new file with an old one, but it isn’t always able to correctly
assess the proper time differences. When the transfer is complete, you
can open the files on your hard drive.
You can see both the remote and local views simultaneously by clicking the
Expand/Collapse button on the far right side of the top of the Files panel. To col-
lapse this Site dialog box, click the same Expand/Collapse button a second time.
The arrows with the check mark and the little lock at the top of the Files
panel are for the Check In/Check Out feature, which enables you to keep
track of who is working on a site and prevent more than one person making
changes to the same page. Chapter 4 explains this feature.
If you’re not happy with the FTP capabilities in Dreamweaver, you can use a
dedicated FTP program, such as Fetch for the Macintosh or WS_FTP for
Windows. You can download these shareware programs from www.shareware.
com or www.download.com.
Synchronizing Local and Remote Sites
One of the most valuable features in Dreamweaver’s FTP options is the capa-
bility to automatically synchronize the files on your hard drive with the files
on your server. This is cool because it helps you keep track of which pages
you’ve edited and ensure that they have been updated on the server. This
65
Chapter 2: Setting Up a Web Site with Dreamweaver

may not matter much to you the first time you upload your site, or if you only
have a few pages in your site, but if you have a large site and you make fre-
quent updates, this feature is a wonderful way to make sure all the changes
that you make get to your server. Dreamweaver also confirms which files are
updated after you complete the synchronization.
Follow these steps to synchronize your Web site:
1. Select the name of the site you want to work on in the Files panel
drop-down list.
If you haven’t already defined your site, you first need to follow the step-
by-step instructions in the “Defining a site” section earlier in this chapter.
2. Click the Connects to Remote Host button to log on to your remote site.
3. Click the Expand/Collapse button at the top on the far-right side of the
Files panel.
The Site dialog box displays both the remote and local views of the site,
as shown in Figure 2-12. (To collapse this dialog box, click the same
Expand/Collapse button a second time.)
Figure 2-12:
The
expanded
Site dialog
box lets
you view
both remote
and local
files at the
same time.
66
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

4. From the menu bar, choose Site➪Synchronize Sitewide.
The Synchronize Files dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 2-13.
5. Choose whether to synchronize the Entire Site or Selected Files Only
from the Synchronize drop-down list.
6. From the Direction drop-down list, choose which option you want to
use to copy the files:
• Put Newer Files to Remote: This option copies the most recently
modified files from your local site to the remote site. Click the
Delete Remote Files Not On Local Drive box if you want those files
removed from your Web site.
• Get Newer Files from Remote: This option copies the most
recently modified files from your remote site to the local site. Click
the Delete Local Files Not On Remote Server box if you want to
remove those files from your local copy.
• Get and Put Newer Files: This option updates both the local and
remote sites with the most recent versions of all the files.
7. Make sure the Delete Remote files Not On Local Drive box is
unchecked.
Be careful of this feature. As a general rule, I recommend you leave it
unchecked because you may have folders and files on the server, such
as log files, that do not exist on your hard drive, and you don’t want to
delete them inadvertently.
8. Click the Preview button.
The Site FTP dialog box displays the files that are about to be changed.
Now you have the option to verify the files you want to delete, put, and
get. If you don’t want Dreamweaver to alter a file, deselect it from the
Site FTP dialog box now or forever live with the consequences.
Figure 2-13:
The Syn-
chronize
Files dialog
box enables
you to
replace or
delete files.
67
Chapter 2: Setting Up a Web Site with Dreamweaver

9. Click OK.
All approved changes are automatically made, and Dreamweaver
updates the Site FTP dialog box with the status.
10. When the synchronization finishes, you can choose to save or not
save the verification information to a local file.
I recommend you choose to save the verification information as it can
be handy if you want to review your changes after synchronization is
complete.
Be very careful of the Delete Remote Files Not on Local Drive option, espe-
cially if you have special administrative pages, such as stats files, which are
often added to your server space by your service provider to track traffic on
your site. 
Cloaking Options
The Dreamweaver Cloaking option enables you to exclude folders or files from
all site operations, meaning they won’t be uploaded to the live site when you’re
synchronizing or batching files back and forth. This feature is handy if you
have sections of a site that you want to save but don’t want visible to your
viewers. For example, if you have a special holiday folder that you don’t want
visible during the rest of the year, you can use the Cloaking feature to save it
locally, with the assurance that no one can accidentally publish the files with
Dreamweaver until you uncloak them and publish them in December.
To use the Cloaking feature, follow these steps:
1. On the Cloaking page of the Site Definition dialog box, select the
Enable Cloaking box as shown in Figure 2-14.
2. If you want to cloak files of a certain type, select the Cloak Files
Ending With box and enter the extension(s) in the text field.
For example, if you want to cloak all your original Photoshop files so
they don’t upload and take up space on your server, enter the extension
.psd. If you want to cloak more than one file type, separate each file
extension with a space. Do not use a comma or other delimiter.
3. Click OK to close the Site Definition dialog box and then click the
Done button in the Define Sites dialog box to close it.
Files matching the extensions specified, if any, are now cloaked. If you
want to manually cloak specific folders, continue to Step 4.
68
Part I: Fulfilling Your Dreams 

4. On the Files tab of the Files panel, select the folders you want to cloak.
You can’t cloak individual files, for reasons known only to the
Dreamweaver programmers.
5. Right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac) and select Cloaking➪
Cloak from the shortcut menu.
To uncloak files or folders, repeat Steps 4 and 5 and select Uncloak from the
shortcut menu. You can also use these steps to uncloak all the files in your
current site, disable cloaking in the site, and change the cloaking settings.
If you disable cloaking for all files, any manual cloaking choices you’ve made
are lost, even if you enable cloaking again later.

O
ne of the most common mistakes new Web designers make is plunging
into developing a site without thinking through all their goals, priorities,
budget, and design options. The instinct is to simply start creating pages,
throw them all into one big directory, and then string stuff together with
links. Then, when designers finally test the site out on an audience, they’re
often surprised when users say the site is hard to navigate and they can’t find
what they want.
Do yourself a favor and save yourself some grief by planning ahead. By
having a plan, you also stand a much better chance of creating an attractive
Web site that’s easy to maintain and update. In this chapter, you discover
many of the common planning issues of Web design. You also find out how
Dreamweaver is designed to help manage a team of developers with features
such as Design Notes and integrated e-mail. You also discover Dreamweaver’s
file management features, which make it easy to move files and folders
around within the structure of your Web site without breaking links. If you do
find yourself in the unfortunate predicament of trying to fix broken links,
Dreamweaver makes that task easier, too. And, if you like knowing all the
details, you may appreciate Dreamweaver’s many report features, which
automatically analyze and evaluate many aspects of your Web site.

Visualizing Your Site
Before you get too far into building Web pages, take some time to plan your
site and think about its structure and organization. Begin thinking about the
following questions:
 What do you want to accomplish with your Web site? (What are your
goals and objectives?)
 Who is your target audience?
 Who will be working on your site? How many developers do you have to
manage?
 How will you create or collect the text and images you need for your site?
 How will you organize the files in your site?
 Will you include multimedia files, such as Flash or RealAudio?
 Will you want interactive features, such as a feedback form or chat room?
 What other software will you need for specialized features (for example,
Macromedia Flash for animations)?
 What kind of navigation system will you have for your site (that is, how
can you make navigating through your Web site easy for visitors)?
 How will you accommodate growth and further development of the site?
With at least a basic plan for your site, you’re in a better position to take
advantage of the site-management features discussed in this chapter. Taking
the time to get clear on your goals and objectives is time well spent and can
save you lots of grief later. Set the tone for successful Web development from
the beginning and make sure you spend your precious time, money, and
energy on the elements and features that best serve your audience and help
you reach your goals.
Preparing for Development
One of the first things I like to do when I’m working on a new site with a
group or company is hold a brainstorming session with a few people who
understand the goals for the Web site. The purpose of this session is to come
up with proposed sections and features for the site. A good brainstorming
session is a nonjudgmental free-for-all — a chance for everyone involved to
make all the suggestions that they can think of, whether realistic or not.
Not discrediting ideas at the brainstorming stage is important. Often an unre-
alistic idea leads to a great idea that no one may have thought of otherwise.
And if you stifle one person’s creative ideas too quickly, that person may feel
less inclined to voice other ideas in the future.
74
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

After the brainstorming session, you have a long list of possible features to
develop into your site. Your challenge is to edit that list down to the best and
most realistic ideas and then plan your course of development to ensure that
these ideas all work well together when you’re done.
Developing a New Site
In a nutshell, building a Web site involves creating individual pages and linking
them to other pages. You need to have a home page (often called the front page)
that links to pages representing different sections of the site. Those pages, in
turn, can link to subsections that can then lead to additional subsections. A big
part of Web site planning is determining how to divide your site into sections
and deciding how pages link to one another. Dreamweaver makes creating pages
and setting links easy, but how you organize the pages is up to you.
If you’re new to this, you may think you don’t need to worry much about how
your Web site will grow and develop. Think again. All good Web sites grow,
and the bigger they get, the harder they are to manage. Planning the path of
growth for your Web site before you begin can make a tremendous difference
later. Neglecting to think about growth is probably one of the most common
mistakes among new designers. This becomes even more serious when more
than one person is working on the same site. Without a clearly established
site organization and some common conventions for tasks such as naming
files, confusion reigns.
Managing your site’s structure
Managing the structure of a Web site has two sides: the side that users see,
which depends on how you set up links, and the behind-the-scenes side, which
depends on how you organize files and folders.
What the user sees
The side that the user sees is all about navigation. When users arrive at your
home page, where do you direct them from there? How do they move from
one page to another in your site? A good Web site is designed so that users
navigate easily and intuitively and can make a beeline to the information
most relevant to them. As you plan, make sure that users can
 Access key information easily from more than one place in the site.
 Move back and forth between pages and sections.
 Return to main pages and subsections in one step.
Setting links is easy in Dreamweaver; the challenge is to make sure that
they’re easy for visitors to follow.

Chapter 3: Planning and Maintaining a Web Site

What you see
The second side to managing your Web site structure happens behind the
scenes (where your users can’t see the information, but you want some kind
of organizational system to remember what’s what). Before you get too far
into building your site with Dreamweaver, spend some time thinking about
the management issues involved in keeping track of all the files you create for
your site. Files are all the images, HTML pages, animations, sound files, and
anything else you put in your Web site. Once your Web site grows past a
handful of pages, organizing them in separate folders or directories is best.
Many Web developers get 20 or 30 pages into a growing Web site and then real-
ize that having all their files in one folder is confusing. To make matters worse, if
you start moving things into new folders, you have to change all the links. Not
realizing this, some people start organizing files outside of Dreamweaver, only to
discover that they have broken links. Fortunately, Dreamweaver includes site-
management tools that automatically adjust links when you move pages or
create new folders from within the Files panel. Still, starting out with a good plan
is better than having to clean up the structure later.
Before you build those first few pages, think about where you’re likely to add
content in the future (you always will!). For example, you may start with one
page that lists all your staff; but after they see how cool it is, staff members may
want to develop their own pages. In that case, you may want a separate folder
dedicated to staff pages. Similarly, if you provide information for a sales team or
create an online catalog, you may want a separate folder for each product.
As you add new sections, such as the staff or product pages I mention here,
it’s a good practice to create new subfolders to store their respective files.
Creating subfolders also makes managing a site that’s built by multiple
people easier. If each subsection has a separate folder, then each developer
can better manage his or her own files.
Naming your site’s files
As you create files and folders, you have to name them; and the more consis-
tent you are about those names, the easier it is for you and anyone else work-
ing on your site to keep track of what’s in them as the site grows.
For example, say your Web site is a newsletter that includes articles about
the happenings in your town. Simple names like fire.html and truck.html
may make sense to you this week because you’re familiar with the top sto-
ries. But six months from now, if you look for that article on the six-car-pileup
that happened on Main Street, you may not remember that you called it
76
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

truck.html. Adding dates to the end of filenames can help you identify the
files that you may need months — or even years — down the road. Remember
that you can’t use spaces, but you can use the underscore. A good filename
may be fire2006_08_12.html or truck2006_08_19.html; using dates
helps you remember that you added these articles in August of 2006.
Another option is to create a folder for each new update and name it with a
date. For example, a folder named stories2006_08 can contain all the stories
from the August 2006 issue. Then you can put truck.html and any other sto-
ries from that issue in the stories2006_08 folder, and you can find them by
date as well as by filename.
As you develop a filenaming system, talk to other people who may work on
the site and make sure you create a system that makes sense to everyone and
is easy to explain if a new person joins the team. Don’t be afraid to give files a
slightly longer, more descriptive name. Whatever you do, don’t name files
randomly and throw them all in one directory. You should also consider doc-
umenting your naming system. Printing a list of all the filenames in your site
can also provide a handy reference if you’re looking for a particular file.
Make sure your files work on your Web server. Dreamweaver lets you call
your files any name that works on your operating system, even something
like don’t forget this is the photo the boss likes.htm, but your
Web server may use a different operating system that’s more restrictive.
Many servers on the Web are run on UNIX machines that are case-sensitive —
so stick to lowercase for filenames and extensions. Also, keep your URLs
simple and easy to type by avoiding using spaces, apostrophes, or other spe-
cial characters, except for the underscore (_) or hyphen (-). If you use file-
names that your Web server can’t read, then your site won’t work until you
rename all those files. 
77
Chapter 3: Planning and Maintaining a Web Site
Under construction? No hard hats here!
All good Web sites are under construction —
always. It’s the nature of the Web. But build your
site in such a way that you can add pages when
they’re ready instead of putting up placehold-
ers. Don’t greet your viewers with a guy in a
yellow hat who seems to say, “You clicked this
link for no good reason. Come back another day,
and maybe we’ll have something for you to
see.” Instead of creating “Under Construction”
placeholders, create directory structures that
make adding new pages later easy. You can let
readers know that new things are coming 
by putting notices on pages that already have
content — a message like “Come here next
Thursday for a link to something even cooler” is
a great idea. But never make users click a link
and wait for a page to load, only to find that noth-
ing but a guy with a hard hat is waiting for them.

78

Finding files by their addresses
If you’re not sure where you saved a file or what
you called it, but you can get to it with your
browser, you can determine the filename and
location by looking at the URL in the browser’s
address bar. Each folder in a Web site is included
in the address to a page within that folder. Folder
names are separated by the forward slash /, and
each filename can be distinguished because it
includes an extension. For example, the address
to the page displayed in the figure tells me that
the file is named dwfd.html and that it is
located in a folder called books.
A few examples of good filenames are mugshot_jim.jpg, logo_128_x_240.
gif, or deckchair.html. Bad filenames would include spaces and special
characters. These filenames would not work well on a Web site: Jim’sMugShot.
jpg, Logo.gif, or deck chair.HTML. Although coming up with names that
work and that everyone else on your site development team will remember
can take a little more time, it’s worth the effort in the long run. Now where
did I save that file about organizing images. . . .

Organizing images
Many HTML teachers and consultants suggest that you place all your images
in a single folder at the top level of the directory structure and name it images.
You may also find that other HTML authoring tools place all your images in
one folder by default. Dreamweaver doesn’t require an images folder, but it
does encourage you to identify a main images folder when you set up your
site (for more on site setup, see Chapter 2).
The advantage of keeping all your images in one folder is that you only have
one place to look for them. However, if all your images are in one place, you’ll
likely end up with a long list of image files, making it harder to keep track of
which image is which. When you want to change an image later, sorting
through this list can be arduous work.
A good alternative is to store your images in multiple images folders and keep
them within subfolders with related HTML files. For example, keep all your staff
photos for your staff pages in an images folder within a staff subfolder. If you
have images that link throughout the site — a logo, for example — you may
want to keep those images in an images folder at the top level of your directory
structure. This way, the images are easy to find from any folder in the site.
Dreamweaver makes no distinction between a folder called images and a
folder called hot-stuff, or any other name for that matter. You can name your
folders whatever you like, even goofy_pictures, just make sure you remember
what you called them so you can find them again later.
79
Chapter 3: Planning and Maintaining a Web Site
Similarly, you can identify the name and location
of any image you are viewing on a Web page. If
you’re using Internet Explorer, place your cursor
over the image and right-click (Windows) and
then choose Properties from the drop-down list.
The Properties dialog box includes the specific
URL of the image, which has the name and folder
(path). In this example, the image is named
tips.gif and it’s stored in the images folder. If
you’re using the Safari browser on a Mac, it
works a little differently. Control+click an image
and choose Open Image in New Window from
the drop-down list. In the new window, the image
URL appears in the location bar.

Handling links
As you develop your site, the links only become more complicated to manage
and easier to break. Fortunately, Dreamweaver includes a variety of tools that
help you keep links in good working order.
Changing and moving files without breaking links
You can use the Files panel to rename and rearrange files and folders, as well
as create new folders, all with drag-and-drop ease. You need to define your
site for this to work (see Chapter 2).
To rename or rearrange files, follow these steps:
1. Select the site name from the drop-down list at the top of the Files
panel and choose the site you want to work on from the list. 
When you select a site, the folders and files of that site display in the
Files panel on the right side of the Dreamweaver work area.
2. Use the plus (+) and minus (–) signs to open and close folders in the
Files panel.
3. In the Files panel, select the file or folder that you want to change
(move and/or rename):
To move the selected file: Drag that file or folder anywhere in the panel.
For example, you can move a file into a folder, and Dreamweaver auto-
matically changes all the related links.
This panel works just like the Explorer window on a PC or the Finder on
a Mac, except that Dreamweaver tracks and fixes links when you move
files through the Files panel. By contrast, if you move or rename site files
or folders in the Finder or Explorer, you break the links in existing Web
pages. In Dreamweaver, when you move a linked file into a new folder,
the Update Files dialog box appears with a list of links that need to be
updated, as shown in Figure 3-1. To adjust the links, choose Update. If
you choose Don’t Update, any links to or from that file are left as they
are, and likely won’t work any more.
To rename a selected file: Click the selected file, and after the cursor
appears at the end of the filename, type your new filename or edit the
existing name. When you finish, press Enter (Return on a Mac). Again
you’re prompted to update any links affected by the filename change.
Choose Update to adjust the links.
80
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

Making global changes to links
If you want to globally change a link to point at a new URL or to some other
page on your site, you can use the Change Link Sitewide option to enter the
new URL and change every reference automatically. You can use this option
to change any kind of link, including mailto, ftp, and script links. For example,
if the e-mail address that you list at the bottom of every page on your site
changes, you can use this feature to fix it automatically — a real timesaver.
You can also use this feature when you want a string of text to link to a differ-
ent file than it currently does. For example, you can change every instance of
the words Enter this month’s contest to link to /contest/january.htm
instead of /contest/december.htm throughout your Web site.
To change all links from one page on your site to another using the Change
Link Sitewide feature, follow these steps:
1. Make sure the site you want to work on is displayed in the Files panel.
(See Chapter 2 for more on this).
2. From the menu, choose Site➪Change Link Sitewide.
The Change Link Sitewide dialog box appears (see Figure 3-2).
3. Enter the old address and the new address you want to change it to,
or click the Browse buttons to identify files where you want to change
the links. 
4. Click OK.
Dreamweaver updates any documents that include the specified links.
These changes occur only on the local version of your site on your hard drive
and are reflected on your live site until you upload them to your server. To
automatically reconcile these changes, use the Dreamweaver Synchronize
Files option described in Chapter 2.

Chapter 3: Planning and Maintaining a Web Site

Finding and Fixing Broken Links
If you’re trying to rein in a chaotic Web site, or if you just want to check a site
for broken links, you’ll be pleased to discover the Check Links feature. You
can use Check Links to verify the links in a single file or an entire Web site,
and you can use it to automatically fix all the referring links at once.
Here’s an example of what Check Links can do. Assume that someone on your
team (because you would never do such a thing yourself) changed the name
of a file from new.htm to old.htm without using the Dreamweaver automatic
link update features to fix the corresponding links. Maybe this person changed
the name using another program or simply renamed it in the Finder on the
Mac or in Explorer in Windows. Changing the filename was easy, but what
this person may not have realized is that if he or she didn’t change the links
to the file when the file was renamed, the links are now broken.
If only one page links to the file that your clueless teammate changed, fixing
the broken link isn’t such a big deal. As long as you remember what file the
page links from, you can simply open that page and use the Properties
inspector to reset the link the same way you created the link in the first
place. (You can find out all the basics of link creation in Chapter 2.)
But many times, a single page in a Web site is linked to many other pages.
When that’s the case, fixing all the link references can be time-consuming,
and forgetting some of them is all too easy. That’s why the Check Links fea-
ture is so helpful. First, it serves as a diagnostic tool that identifies broken
links throughout the site (so you don’t have to second-guess where someone
may have changed a filename or moved a file). Then it serves as a global fix-it
tool. You can use the Check Links dialog box to identify the page a broken
link should go to, and Dreamweaver automatically fixes all links referring to
that page. The following section walks you through this very cool process.
If you are working on a dynamic, database-driven site or if your site was
altered with programming that was done outside of Dreamweaver, the Check

82
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

Links feature may not work properly. This feature works best for sites with
static HTML pages.
Checking for broken links
To check a site for broken links, follow these steps:
1. Select the site name from the drop-down list at the top of the Files
panel and choose the site you want to work on from the list.
Link checking works only for sites listed in the Dreamweaver Site dialog
box. For more information about the Site dialog box and how to set up a
new site or import an existing one, see Chapter 2.
2. From the menu, choose Site➪Check Links Sitewide.
The Link Checker tab opens in the Results panel at the bottom of the
page, just under the Properties inspector, as shown in Figure 3-3. The
tab displays a list of internal and external links. The tab also lists any
pages, images, or other items not linked from any other page in the site
(Dreamweaver calls these orphans). Unused images can waste space on
your server so this list is handy if you want to clean up old images or
other elements you no longer use on the site.
Most service providers limit the amount of space on your server and
charge extra if you exceed that limit. Deleting unused files helps you
save valuable server space, especially if they are image or multimedia
files. But remember, just because you delete them from your hard drive
doesn’t mean they are deleted off the server. Make sure you remove
them from the Remote Site window in the Files panel as well as the Local
Site panel. (For more on using FTP and synchronization to update or
delete files on your server, see Chapter 2.)
If you find broken links, the next section, “Fixing broken links,” shows you
how Dreamweaver automatically updates multiple link references to make
fixing them fast and easy.
Fixing broken links
Broken links are one of the most problematic errors a Web designer can
make. After you identify a broken link in your site, you should fix it immedi-
ately. Nothing turns off visitors faster than clicking a link and getting a File
Not Found error page (also known as a 404 error because that’s the official
Web error code associated with the message viewers usually see if they click
a broken link). Fortunately, Dreamweaver makes fixing broken links simple by
providing quick access to files with broken links and automating the process
of fixing multiple links to the same file.
83
Chapter 3: Planning and Maintaining a Web Site

After using the Link Checker feature described in the preceding section to
identify broken links, follow these steps to use the Results panel to fix them:
1. With the Results panel open at the bottom of the page, double-click a
filename that Dreamweaver identified as a broken link.
The page and its corresponding Properties inspector opens. The Results
panel remains visible.
2. Select the broken link or image on the open page.
In Figure 3-4, a broken image was selected and is being fixed by using the
Properties inspector to find the correct image name.
3. In the Properties inspector, click the folder icon to the right of the Src
text box to identify the correct image file.
The Select Image Source dialog box appears. You can type the correct
filename and path in the text box or browse to find the image.
You fix links to pages just as you fix links to images, except you type the
name of the correct file into the Link text box or click the folder icon
next to it to find the file in your site folder.
4. Click the filename and the Select button; then click OK.
The link automatically changes to reflect the new filename and location.
If you replace an image, the image file reappears on the page.

If the link that you correct appears in multiple pages, Dreamweaver prompts
you with a dialog box asking whether you want to fix the remaining broken
link references to the file. Click the Yes button to automatically correct all
other references. Click the No button to leave other files unchanged.
Testing Your Work with the 
Site Reporting Feature
Before you put your site online for the world to see, checking your work using
the Dreamweaver Site Reporting feature is a good idea. You can create a vari-
ety of reports, and even customize them, to identify problems with external
links, redundant and empty tags, untitled documents, and missing Alt text.
You can easily miss things — especially when you work on a tight deadline —
and what you miss can cause real problems for your viewers if you leave mis-
takes unfixed.
Before Dreamweaver added this great new feature, finding these kinds of mis-
takes was a tedious and time-consuming task. Now you can run a report that
identifies these errors for you and use Dreamweaver to fix mistakes across
your entire site automatically.

Chapter 3: Planning and Maintaining a Web Site

Follow these steps to produce a Site Report of your entire Web site:
1. Select the site name from the drop-down list at the top of the Files
panel and choose the site you want to work on from the list.
See Chapter 2 for step-by-step instructions for defining your site if you
haven’t done so already.
2. Make sure all your open documents are saved by choosing File➪
Save All.
3. From the Site menu, choose Site➪Reports.
The Reports dialog box appears (see Figure 3-5).
4. From the Report On drop-down list, choose Entire Current Local Site.
You can also choose to check only a single page by opening the page in
Dreamweaver and then choosing Current Document from the Report On
drop-down list. You can also run a report on selected files or on a partic-
ular folder. If you choose Selected Files, you must have already selected
the pages you want to check in the Files panel.
5. Select the type of report you want by putting check marks next to the
report names in the Select Reports section.
Table 3-1 describes the kind of report you get with each option. You can
select as many reports as you want.
The Workflow options in the Select Reports section are available only if
you already enabled Check In/Out in the Remote Info section of the Site
Definition dialog box and selected Maintain Design Notes in the Design
Notes section of the Site Definition dialog box’s Advanced tab. You can
read more about the Site Definition dialog box in Chapter 2 and more
about Design Notes and the Check in/Check Out feature in Chapter 4.

6. Click the Run button to create the report(s).
If you haven’t already done so, you may be prompted to save your file,
define your site, or select a folder (see Chapter 2 for more information
on defining a site in Dreamweaver).
The Results panel opens (see Figure 3-6 displaying a list of problems
found on a site). You can sort the list by different categories (filename,
line number, or description) by clicking the corresponding column head-
ings. If you run several reports at the same time, you can keep all the
results tabs open at the same time.
7. Double-click any item in the Results panel to open the corresponding
file in the Document window.
You can also right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac) on any line of
the report and choose More Info from the drop-down list to find addi-
tional details about the specific error or condition.
8. Use the Properties inspector or other Dreamweaver feature to fix the
identified problem and then save the file.
Your changes aren’t applied to your live site until you update your
server. Use the Synchronize feature, described in Chapter 2, to update
all your changes at once.

Produces a list of filenames that don’t have a title.
The title tag is easy to forget because it does not dis-

the text that appears at the very top of the browser
window and is also the text that appears in the
Favorites list when someone saves your page in his
or her browser. And if that’s not enough reason to
have a descriptive title, a good title tag is one key to
getting good placement in many search engines as
well.

trive for consistency in all your designs — except when you’re trying 
to be unpredictable. A little surprise here and there can keep your Web
site lively. But, generally, most Web sites work best and are easiest to navigate
when they follow a consistent design theme. Case in point: Most readers take
for granted that books don’t change their design from page to page, and 
newspapers don’t change headline fonts and logos every day. Books and
newspapers want to make life easier for their readers, and consistency is 
one of the primary tools for making sure readers find publications familiar.
Dreamweaver offers several features to help you develop and maintain a 
consistent look and feel across your site, whether you’re working on a Web
site by yourself or you’re coordinating a team of developers.
In this chapter, you discover three of my favorite Dreamweaver features —
templates, Library items, and the Tracing Image feature. Find out how they
combine to make your design work faster and easier to manage. This chapter
also introduces you to Design Notes, the Check In/Out feature, the History
panel, and the Quick Tag Editor — tools that you can use for managing a
team of designers, retracing your steps in Dreamweaver, and tweaking HTML
tags respectively.
Templating Your Type
Many Web design programs boast about their HTML templates. Often what
they really mean is the program includes some ready-made page designs.
Dreamweaver takes this concept a few leaps further by providing template

design features that enable you to create a predesigned page and specify
which sections can and can’t be altered. This is a valuable feature if you work
with a team of people with varying skill levels, or if you have to create dozens
of pages with the same basic layout. For example, if you’re building a site for
a real-estate company and you want to let the employees update the sales
listings without messing up the page design, a template with locked regions
can be an ideal way to allow sales staff to add new information without acci-
dentally breaking anything.
Templates are best used when you’re creating a number of pages that share
the same characteristics, such as the same background color, column design,
or image arrangement. For example, if you’re creating a Web site for a bed-
and-breakfast inn, such as the Inn on Tomales Bay featured in the examples in
this chapter, you might create a template for all the pages where you want to
show off the rooms in the Inn. In that case, you might create a room template
design with a spot for a photo, descriptive text, and forward and back arrows
so that visitors could easily move through the pages for all the rooms. As you
create each new page, you would start with the template, changing only the
photo, descriptive text, and links. Templates can save tons of time and help
ensure that page designs are more consistent.
Dreamweaver’s template feature has an additional functionality that enables
you to make global changes to your site by changing just the template file.
Here’s how it works. If you create a series of pages with the same template,
and then decide you want to alter the template design, the changes you make
to the original template can automatically be applied to any or all the files
created from the template. For example, if you need to change the logo for
your bed-and-breakfast on all your pages, you can simply replace the logo 
on the original template and, using the automated update feature, apply that
change to all the pages created with that template. This feature can be a huge
timesaver when you need to make changes to several pages at once. 
Dreamweaver 8 includes a wealth of ready-to-use templates; with this ver-
sion, you even find Starter Pages, which include prewritten text to help you
get started with common sites features, such as calendars and product
pages. Templates, starter pages, and many other predesigned components in
Dreamweaver give you a choice of many page layouts, cascading style sheet
designs, framesets, and table-based layouts that can help you create a Web
site quickly.
Creating Predesigned Pages with
Dreamweaver’s Design Files
Dreamweaver comes with a great collection of predesigned pages you can
use to create Web sites with Cascading Style Sheets, frames, and complex
page designs. Macromedia calls these design files, but they are essentially
90
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

templates — predesigned pages you can customize with your own content.
Using a template, or design file, to create a new page is similar to creating any
other page in Dreamweaver with the added advantage that much of the work
is already done for you. 
Dreamweaver’s design files do not include all the most advanced features 
of Dreamweaver templates, such as the capability to make global changes,
unless you first save the files as custom templates (instructions for that 
are in the following section).
Among Dreamweaver’s design files, you can find the following:
 Framesets: These page designs are specific to HTML frames, which
enable you to display multiple pages on the screen at once. Chapter 7
has instructions for working with frames and frame templates.
 Page Designs (CSS): These files use Cascading Style Sheets to control
layout and design.
 Starter Pages: These page designs include written content to give you a
head start as you create common sections in a Web site, such as a calen-
dar or product page.
 Page Designs: These are most useful as inner page designs around
which you can place your standard header, footer, or navigation, and
they use standard CSS formatting and tables to control layout and
design.
In addition to the design files included in Dreamweaver, you can create
custom templates. Step-by-step instructions are in the “Creating Your Own
Templates” section later in this chapter. 
To use one of Dreamweaver’s design files to create a page, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New.
Alternatively, you can choose any of the options from the Create From
Samples section on the Dreamweaver Start page.
2. Choose a design file from any of the four collections available on the
General tab: Framesets, Page Designs (CSS), Starter Pages, or Page
Designs.
Dreamweaver’s design files for the selected collection display in the New
Document window. In the example shown in Figure 4-1, I chose the Page
Designs from the Category list and then selected the Image: Slide Show
from the Page Designs list.
3. From the list of page designs in the middle of the New Document
window, click to display a preview of a template.
91
Chapter 4: Coordinating Your Design Work

4. Choose whether you’re creating a document or a template, and click
the corresponding radio button from the bottom right of the New
Document window.
5. With the design file selected, click Create to create a new page.
A new page is created from the design file and opens in the main work
area.
6. Choose File➪Save to save the page before you make any changes.
Saving your pages before adding images or setting links is important.
Make sure you save the new page within the main folder of the Web site
you are creating. 
If you have not already completed the setup process for this site, see
Chapter 2 to take care of this important preliminary step.
7. Click to select any text area, image, link, or other element on the page
and replace it with your own images or text to customize the design.
In the example shown in Figure 4-2, I’ve replaced the blank image in 
the middle of the page with an image from the Inn on Tomales Bay and
replaced the title and caption text. Creating additional pages with this
same design file would allow me to easily create a slide show of images
from this bed-and-breakfast inn.
8. Continue to edit the page, replacing images and filler text (Dream-
weaver uses Latin as filler text), setting links, and making any other
alterations or additions to the page.
9. When you are done, use File➪Save to save your changes.

You can edit or replace anything in a Dreamweaver design file, and even alter
the design to better fit your site.
Creating Your Own Templates
Creating a template is as easy as creating any other file in Dreamweaver. You
can start by creating an HTML page as you would any other page (or modify-
ing an existing page as you would edit any other page). The main difference 
is that when you save the file you save it as a template and the file is stored
in a special Templates folder, which Dreamweaver automatically creates in
the main folder for your Web site. Templates must be kept in this common
folder for the automated features in Dreamweaver to work properly. 
The template features work only if you define your Web site in Dreamweaver.
If you haven’t gone through the setup process to define your site yet, refer to
Chapter 2.
Custom templates created in Dreamweaver have locked (noneditable) regions
and unlocked (editable) regions. Use editable regions for content that changes,
such as product descriptions or events in a calendar. Use locked regions for
static, unchanging content, such as a logo or site navigation elements.
Figure 4-2:
You can 
edit a page
created
from a
Dream-

design file
much like
you would
edit any
other page.
93
Chapter 4: Coordinating Your Design Work

For example, if you’re publishing an online magazine, the navigation options
may not change from page to page, but the titles and stories do. To indicate
the style and location of an article or headline, you can define placeholder
text (an editable region, with all the size and font attributes already speci-
fied). When you’re ready to add a new feature, you simply select the place-
holder text and either paste in a story or type over the selected area. You do
the same thing to create a placeholder for an image.
While you’re editing the template itself, you can make changes to any part of
the file, be it the editable or locked regions. While editing a document made
from a template, however, you can make changes only to the editable regions
of the document. If you go back and change a template after creating it,
Dreamweaver gives you the option of having those changes updated in all the
pages you created with that template.
You can create both editable regions and editable attributes in a Dreamweaver
template. An editable region can be changed in files created from the tem-
plate — you alter text, replace images, and even add tables, images, text, and
so on. Editable attributes relate only to specific elements in a template. For
example, you may want to make the attributes of an image editable to allow
the alignment to be changed from left to right.
In a new template, all elements are locked by default except for two parts of
the document head section, which is indicated by the <HEAD> </HEAD> tags.
These tags enable you to change the title in any page created from a tem-
plate, or to insert JavaScript if you use behaviors on the page. For the tem-
plate to be of much use for building new pages, you must make areas in the
body of the page editable as well. Remember that you can always go back to
the template later to alter the design, make more areas editable, or lock areas
so they can’t be changed. 
Creating a new custom template
To create a template that you can use to create new pages, follow these steps:
1. In the Files panel on the right side of the work area, click the Assets
tab and then click the Templates icon (see Figure 4-3).
The Templates panel opens. You don’t have to have the Templates panel
open to create a new template, but having it handy when you’re working
on templates is good because it provides a list of available templates as
well as easy access to template editing and organizational functions.

3. From the Category list in the of the New Document window, choose
Template Page.
The template options become visible in the Template Page list in the
middle of the New Document window.
4. Choose HTML Template.
You can choose from a variety of template options, including templates
for ASP (Active Server Pages), ColdFusion, and PHP, all of which are
used for creating dynamic sites, like those shown in Chapters 13, 14, 
and 15.
5. Click the Create button.
A new blank template is created and opens in the main work area, and
the New Document dialog box closes.
6. Choose File➪Save and name the template.
The new template is added to the Assets panel (refer to Figure 4-3).
7. You can now edit this page as you edit any other HTML page, inserting
images, text, tables, and so on.
8. Choose Modify➪Page Properties to specify background, text, link
colors, and other options that apply to the entire page.
This works just like any other Dreamweaver document.
9. To create an editable region, select the content you want to affect,
right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac), and choose Templates➪
New Editable Region (as shown in Figure 4-5).
The New Editable Region dialog box opens. 
10. Give the new region a name. I recommend something that identifies
the kind of content it is, such as headline or photo_caption.
The region you define as editable becomes an area that can be changed
in any page created with the template. You can have multiple editable
regions in one template, such as a photo that is an editable region and a
photo caption that is a separate editable region. Areas that you don’t
mark as editable become locked and can be changed only if you modify
the template itself.
11. Click OK.
The editable region is enclosed in a highlighted area with a tab at the
top left, indicating the name of the region.
12. When you finish designing the page, choose File➪Save to save your
template.
You can make an entire table or an individual table cell editable, and you can
make entire rows editable. (For more about creating HTML tables, see
Chapter 6.) 
96
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

Saving any page as a template
Sometimes you get partway through creating a page before you realize you’re
likely to want more pages like it and you should create a template so you don’t
have to re-create the same page design multiple times. Similarly, you may have
a page that someone else created that you want to turn into a template. No
matter where the original page comes from, creating a template from an exist-
ing page is even easier than creating a new template from scratch.
To save a page as a template, follow these steps:
1. Open the page that you want to turn into a template.
Choose File➪Open and browse to find your file. Or, open the site in the
Files panel and double-click the file to open it.
2. Choose File➪Save As Template.
The Save As Template dialog box appears (see Figure 4-6).
3. Select a site from the Site drop-down list.
The menu lists all the sites that you have defined in Dreamweaver. If
you’re working on a new site or haven’t yet defined your site, Chapter 2
shows you how to define your site. 
Figure 4-5:
You can
modify any
area of a
template to
make it
editable. 
97
Chapter 4: Coordinating Your Design Work

You can use the Save As Template option to save a page as a template
into any defined site, which makes it easy to save a page design from
one site as a template for another site.
4. In the Save As text box, type a name for the template.
In the example shown in Figure 4-6, I named the template guests.
5. Click the Save button.
Notice that the file now has the .dwt extension, indicating that it’s a
template. You can now make changes to this template the same way 
you edit any other template.
6. Decide if you want to update links or not.
Because your original file was probably saved in a different directory
from the templates, Dreamweaver offers to update all your links and
keep them pointing to the correct destination. Unless you have a spe-
cific reason not to allow Dreamweaver to take care of the links for you,
click Yes.
7. Make any changes that you want and choose File➪Save to save the
page. 
Follow the steps in the earlier section, “Creating a new custom template,”
to create editable regions. Follow the steps in the next exercise to create
editable attributes.
Making attributes editable
To create editable attributes in a template, follow these steps:
1. In any Dreamweaver template, select an item you want to have an
editable attribute.
In the example shown in Figure 4-7, I selected a section of text, and I am
in the process of making text attributes editable. 
Figure 4-6:
You can
view all the
templates in
any defined
site in the
Save As
Template
dialog box. 
98
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

2. Choose Modify➪Templates➪Make Attribute Editable, as shown in
Figure 4-7.
The Editable Tag Attributes dialog box appears, shown in Figure 4-8.
3. From the Attribute drop-down list, choose the attribute you want to be
editable.
If the attribute doesn’t exist yet, click the Add button.
Figure 4-8:

99
Chapter 4: Coordinating Your Design Work

4. Click to place a check mark in the Make Attribute Editable box and fill
in the Label, Type, and Default options.
The attribute options vary depending on whether you select an image,
text, or other element on the page. With these options, you can control
whether or not an image can be changed and what specific attributes of
the image tag may be altered when the template is used.
5. Click OK.
Using custom templates
After you create your own custom templates, you’ll want to put them to use.
You can use templates to create or modify all the pages in your Web site or
use templates for specific sections. For example, in a site such as the Inn on
Tomales Bay site, you could create one template for the pages that feature
each of the rooms and another template for a slide show of photos from
guests. Using a template to create a new page is similar to creating any other
HTML page.
To use a template to create a page, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New.
The New Document window opens.
2. Select the Templates tab at the top of the New Document window.
The New from Template dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-9, display-
ing all the templates from the sites you have defined in Dreamweaver.
3. From the Templates For list on the left, choose the site that contains a
template you want to use.
The templates in the selected site appear in the middle of the dialog box.
4. Select the template you want to use from the Site list in the middle of
the dialog box.
A preview of the selected template displays in the right side of the dialog
box. In the example shown in Figure 4-9, I selected the Rooms template
from the Inn on Tomales Bay Web site.
5. Click the Create button.
A new page is created from the template and displays in the main work
area.
6. Edit any of the regions of the page that are editable using
Dreamweaver’s regular editing features.

Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

Making Global Changes with Templates
One of the greatest advantages of using templates is that you can automati-
cally apply changes to all the pages created with a template by altering the
original template. For example, suppose you want to make a change to the
layout of all your slide show pages after you’ve created a slide show using
Dreamweaver’s slide show template. First, you would open the slide show
template, make the edits you want to the overall page design, and when you
save the template, you can opt to automatically update all the pages created
with that template. If you’re making changes to many pages at once this can
be a real timesaver. You can also choose to leave all the pages previously cre-
ated with the template unchanged and to have only new pages created with
the template reflect the changes.
To change a template and automatically update all the files in your site that
use that template, follow these steps:
1. Open an existing template.
2. Use Dreamweaver’s editing features to make any changes you want to
the template.
3. Choose File➪Save.
The Update Template Files dialog box appears, shown in Figure 4-10.
Figure 4-9:
The New
from
Template
dialog box
lets you
create a
new
document
from any
defined site.
101
Chapter 4: Coordinating Your Design Work

4. Click the Update button to modify all the pages listed in the Update
Template Files dialog box. 
Dreamweaver automatically changes all the pages listed in the Update
Template Files dialog box to reflect the changes you made to the template.
Choose the Don’t Update button to leave these pages unchanged.
If you’re not sure what template was used to create a page, you can open the
template while you have the page open, make changes to the template, and
update all the pages created with it by following these steps:
1. Open a document that uses the template that you want to change.
2. Choose Modify➪Templates➪Open Attached Template as shown in
Figure 4-11.
The template opens.
3. Use Dreamweaver’s regular editing functions to modify the template
as you would edit any page or template.
For example, to modify the template’s page properties, choose Modify➪
Page Properties.
4. Choose File➪Save.
The Update Template Files dialog box appears (refer to Figure 4-10).
5. Click the Update button to modify all the pages listed in the Update
Template Files dialog box. Click the Don’t Update button to leave
these pages unchanged.
If you chose Update, Dreamweaver automatically changes all the pages
listed in the Update Template Files dialog box.
Figure 4-10:
You can
update all
the files
created with
a template
from the
Update
Template
Files dialog
box.
102
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

You can also apply changes to a template using the Update Pages option. 
To do so, you have to first open the template, and then make and save your
changes without applying those changes to pages created with the template.
Then anytime later, you can choose Modify➪Templates➪Update Pages to
apply the update.
Attaching and Detaching Templates
You can apply a template to an existing page by attaching it, and you can
remove a template from a page by detaching it. When you apply a template 
to an existing document, the content in the template is added to the content
already in the document. If a template is already applied to the page, Dream-
weaver attempts to match editable areas that have the same name in both
templates and to insert the contents from the editable regions of the page
into the editable regions in the new template. This happens automatically if
all region names are the same.
Remove or detach a template from a page if you want to ensure that changes
to the original template don’t affect the page created with the template.
Detaching a template also unlocks all regions of a page, making it completely
editable.
Figure 4-11:
You can
open an
attached
template
and auto-
matically
apply the
changes to
the pages
created
from that
template.
103
Chapter 4: Coordinating Your Design Work

You can apply a template to an existing page by using any one of the follow-
ing techniques:
 Choose Modify➪Templates➪Apply Template to Page and then double-
click the name of a template to apply it to the page.
 Drag the template from the Template panel into the Document window.
If the editable regions don’t match up, Dreamweaver asks you to match up
inconsistent region names in a dialog box. After the region conflicts are
resolved, click OK. 
You can detach a template, or remove the template association from a file, by
selecting Modify➪Templates➪Detach from Template. This action makes the
file fully editable again, but any future changes you make to the template will
not be reflected on the detached page.
Reusing Elements with 
the Library Feature
The Library feature is not a common feature in other Web design programs,
so the concept may be new to you even if you’ve been developing Web sites
for a while. The more experience you have with this feature, however, the
more likely you are to appreciate its value and the time you can save using
library items.
The Dreamweaver Library feature automates the process of inserting and
updating elements that appear on multiple pages in a Web site. You can save
any element as a Library item — for example, a logo or a row of images that
serve as a site’s navigation, or even a table with images and links. After you
save it in the library, you can insert any item or collection of items into any
page from the Library with drag-and-drop ease. And, if you ever need to
change a Library item (by adding or changing a link, for example), you simply
edit the stored Library item and Dreamweaver automatically updates the
Library item on any or all the pages where it appears throughout the site. 
A Library item is a snippet of code that can contain image references and
links. Like templates, Library items are a great way to share the work of your
best designers with less experienced ones. For example, one designer can
create a logo and another the navigation elements, and then these can be
placed in the Library and made available to the entire team. You have more
flexibility with Library items than templates because they are elements you
can place anywhere on any page, even multiple times. Libraries are not
shared among sites, however, so each site you define must have its own col-
lection of elements in its Library.
104
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

You can save any element from the body of a document as a Library item.
That includes text, tables, forms, images, Java applets, and even multimedia
files. Library items can also contain behaviors, but special requirements exist
for editing the behaviors in Library items. (For more on behaviors, see
Chapter 9.)
Library items cannot contain their own style sheets because the code for
styles can only appear as part of the Head area of an HTML file. (For more 
on style sheets, see Chapter 8.) 
Creating and using Library items
The following sections show you the steps for creating a Library item, adding
one to a page, and editing and updating a Library item across multiple pages.
For these steps to work properly, you must do them in sequential order. Before
creating or using Library items, you must first define a site or open an existing
site. If you’re not sure how to do this, see Chapter 2.
Creating your Library item within an existing page works well because you
can see how the item looks before you add it to the Library. You can, of
course, edit an item after it’s in the Library, but it may not look just as it will
on a Web page. For example, Library items don’t include <BODY> tags when
they are saved in the Library, so link colors display as default blue when
viewed in the library, even if the link colors have been changed to purple in
all the pages in a site.
Creating a Library item
To create a Library item that you can use on multiple pages on your site,
follow these steps:
1. Open any existing file that has images, text, or other elements on the
page that you want to save as a Library item.
Alternatively, you can create a new page and insert only the element you
want to save to the library.
2. From this page, select an element or collection of elements that you
want to save as a Library item, such as the row of images used for
your site navigation.
3. Choose Modify➪Library➪Add Object to Library.
The Assets tab of the Files panel opens and displays the Library. Your
new Library item displays as “Untitled.”
105
Chapter 4: Coordinating Your Design Work

4. Name the element as you would name any file in the Finder on a Mac
or in Explorer on a PC.
When you name a Library item, you automatically save it to the Library.
You can then easily apply the item to any new or existing page in your
site. The Library section of the Assets panel lists all Library items, as
shown in Figure 4-12.
Adding a Library item to a page
You can easily add elements from the Library to your pages by simply drag-
ging them from the Assets panel to the page. When you add a Library item to
a page, the content is inserted into the document and a relationship is estab-
lished between the content on the page and the item in the library. This is
important as it enables you to edit the Library item later and apply the
changes to all pages where the item appears, but it also means that you can
not edit the item on the page where it is inserted. You must edit Library items
from within the Library, as you see in the following section.
To add a Library item to a page, follow these steps:
1. Create a new document in Dreamweaver or open any existing file.
2. From the Files panel, choose the Assets tab and then select the
Library icon.
Figure 4-12:
The Assets
panel
displays all

106
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

The Library opens in the Assets panel (refer to Figure 4-12).
3. Drag an item from the Library to the Document window.
Alternatively, you can select an item in the Library and click the Insert
button.
The item automatically appears on the page. After you insert a Library
item on a page, you can use any of Dreamweaver’s formatting features to
position it on the page.
Highlighting Library items
Library items are highlighted to distinguish them from other elements on a
page. You can customize the highlight color for Library items and show or
hide the highlight color in the Preferences dialog box.
To change or hide Library highlighting, follow these steps:
1. Choose Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver➪Preferences
(Mac).
The Preferences dialog box appears.
2. Select Highlighting from the Category section on the left.
3. Click the color box to select a color for Library items. Check the Show
box to display the Library highlight color on your pages. 
Leave the box blank if you don’t want to display the highlight color.
4. Click OK to close the Preferences dialog box.
Making global changes with Library items
One of the biggest timesaving advantages of the Dreamweaver Library feature
is that you can make changes to Library items and automatically apply those
changes to any or all the pages where the Library item appears. 
To edit a Library item, follow these steps:
1. From the Files panel, choose the Assets tab and then select the Library
icon.
The Library opens in the Assets panel (refer to Figure 4-12).
2. Double-click any item listed in the Library to open it.
Dreamweaver opens a new window where you can edit the Library item.
Because the Library item is just a snippet of code, it won’t have a
<BODY> tag in which to specify background, link, or text colors. Don’t
worry over this — the Library item acquires the right settings from the
tags on the page where you insert it.
107
Chapter 4: Coordinating Your Design Work

3. Make any changes you want to the Library item as you would edit any
element in Dreamweaver.
For example, you can change a link, edit the wording of text, change the
font or size, and even add images, text, or other elements.
4. Choose File➪Save to save changes to the original item. 
The Update Library Items dialog box opens, displaying a list of all pages
where the Library item appears.
5. Click the Update button to apply the changes you made to the Library
item on all the listed pages. If you don’t wish to apply the changes to
the pages where the Library item appears, choose the Don’t Update
button.
The Update Pages dialog box appears and shows the progress of the
updating. You can stop the update from this dialog box, if necessary.
If you want to create a new Library item based on an existing one without
altering the original, follow Steps 1 through 3, and in place of Step 4, choose
File➪Save As and give the item a new name.
Editing one instance of a Library item
If you want to alter a Library item on a specific page where you have inserted
it, or if you want to make changes to just a couple of pages, you can override
the automated Library feature by detaching it, or breaking the link between
the original in the Library and the item inserted into the page.
After you break a connection, you can no longer update that page’s Library
item automatically.
To make a Library item editable, follow these steps:
1. Open any file that contains a Library item and select the Library item.
The Properties inspector displays the Library item options shown in
Figure 4-13.
2. Click the Detach from Original button.
A warning message appears, letting you know that if you proceed with
detaching the Library item from the original, you can no longer update
this occurrence of it when the original is edited.
3. Click OK to detach the Library item.

Using a Tracing Image 
to Guide Your Layout
The Macromedia Tracing Image feature is unique in the world of Web design
tools, although the concept dates back to the earliest days of design. The
Tracing Image feature enables you to use a graphic as a guide to your page
design, much like an artist who creates a sketch and then paints the final pic-
ture over the sketch.
The Tracing Image feature is ideal for people who like to first create a design
in a program such as Photoshop or Fireworks and then model their Web page
after it. By using the Tracing Image feature, you can insert an image into the
background of your page for the purpose of tracing over it. Then you can
position layers or create table cells on top of the tracing image, which makes
exactly re-creating your design in HTML easier. You can use JPG, GIF, or PNG
images as tracing images, and you can create them in any graphics applica-
tion that supports these formats.
Although the tracing image appears in the background of a page, it doesn’t
take the place of a background image and will not display in a browser.

Chapter 4: Coordinating Your Design Work

To add a tracing image to your page, follow these steps:
1. Create a new page or open any existing page in Dreamweaver.
2. Choose Modify➪Page Properties.
The Page Properties dialog box opens, as shown in Figure 4-14.
3. Select Tracing Image from the Category list on the left of the dialog box.
The Tracing Image options display on the right. 
4. Click the Browse button to locate the image you want to use as a trac-
ing image.
The Select Image Source dialog box appears.
5. Click the image you want to trace from.
6. Click OK.
7. Set the opacity for the tracing image with the Transparency slider.
Lowering the transparency level causes the tracing image to appear
faded, which makes distinguishing between the tracing image and con-
tent on the page easy. You can set the transparency level to suit your
preferences, but somewhere around 50 percent seems to work well with
most images.
8. Click OK.
A tracing image appears in the Document window, as shown in 
Figure 4-15.

 Show: Hides the tracing image if you want to check your work without it
being visible but don’t want to remove it.
 Align with Selection: Enables you to automatically line up the tracing
image with a selected element on a page.
 Adjust Position: Enables you to use the arrow keys or enter X, Y coordi-
nates to control the position of the tracing image behind the page.
 Reset Position: Resets the tracing image to 0, 0 on the X, Y coordinates.
 Load: Enables you to add or replace a tracing image.
Making the Most of Dreamweaver’s 
Site-Management Features
In Chapter 2, I introduce you to Dreamweaver’s Manage Sites dialog box and
some of the options in the Site Definition dialog box, such as the Local Info
dialog box where you do the initial site setup for any Web site. In the following
Figure 4-15:
When you

weaver, you

more
precisely.

Chapter 4: Coordinating Your Design Work

sections, I explain the rest of the options available from the Site Definition
dialog box. If you’re the only person working on a Web site, you don’t need the
features described in the next three sections.
Using a Testing Server
The Testing Server option enables you to specify a development server, a
necessary step if you are creating a Web site using the Dreamweaver features
with a database. You find more information about how to do this in Chapters
13, 14, and 15. If you’re not creating a site using a database or a programming
language (for example PHP or ASP), you don’t need to make any changes to
this dialog box. 
Using Check In/Out
The Check In/Out feature is designed to keep people from overwriting each
other’s work when more than one person contributes to the same Web site 
(a valuable feature if you want to keep peace on your Web design team). When
a person working on the Web site checks out a file, other developers working
on the site are unable to make changes to that page. When you check out a
file, you see a green check mark next to the filename in the Files panel. If some-
one else checks out a file, you see a red check mark next to the file name.
To use the Check In/Out feature, check the Enable File Check In and Check Out
option at the bottom of the Remote Info dialog box. The dialog box expands to
expose other options. If you want files checked out whenever they are opened,
check the Check Out Files When Opening option (see Figure 4-16).
112

Keeping the peace with version control
Version control systems enable you to better
manage changes and prevent different team
members from overwriting each other’s work. If
you already use these programs, you’ll be glad
to know that you can integrate both Visual
SourceSafe and systems that use the Web
DAV protocol with Dreamweaver. This way, you
can take advantage of the Dreamweaver site-
management features and still protect your
code-development process. If you don’t know
about these programs, visit the Microsoft site
(http://msdn.microsoft.com/ssafe/)
to find out more about Visual SourceSafe. 

Using this feature, you can track which files a particular person is working
on. But if you want to use this tracking mechanism, check the Check Out Files
When Opening option and then fill in the name you want associated with the
files (presumably your name or nickname if you prefer) in the Check Out
Name field and then include your e-mail address in the Email Address field.
(The Email Address field is needed for Dreamweaver’s integration with e-mail,
which facilitates communication among developers on a site. See the next
section for more information about integrated e-mail.)
Staying in touch with integrated e-mail
Dreamweaver features integrated e-mail as another handy tool for collabora-
tive Web design when you use the Dreamweaver Check In/Out tool (described
in the previous section). In conjunction with the e-mail program you already
use, integrated e-mail gives you easy access to the e-mail addresses of other
members of your team when you need them.
When you work on a site with a team of people, finding that someone else 
has already checked out the page you want to work on is common. Until that
Figure 4-16:

In/Out

Chapter 4: Coordinating Your Design Work

person checks the file back in, doing the work you need to do to the page is
impossible. In the Dreamweaver Site Definition dialog box, each developer
types his or her e-mail address with the Check In/Check Out feature. Then,
when you find that someone else has the page you need, you can easily fire
off an e-mail telling that person to check it back in so you can work on it, 
just by clicking that person’s name in the Files window. (Bribes can be more
effective than threats, especially when you offer chocolate.)
Developers on your team can use the following steps to associate their e-mail
addresses with their version of Dreamweaver as part of the Check In/Check
Out setup:
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites.
The Manage Sites dialog box opens.
2. Select the site you want to work on and then click the Edit button.
The Site Definition dialog box opens.
3. Click the Advanced tab.
4. In the Category list at the left, choose Remote Info.
The Remote Info page appears (refer to Figure 4-16).
5. Select the Enable File Check In and Check Out check box.
6. Select the Check Out Files When Opening check box.
7. Enter your name in the Check Out Name text box. 
Nicknames are okay as long as everyone on the team knows your silly
name.
8. Enter your e-mail address in the Email Address text box.
9. Click OK to save your changes. Click the Done button in the Manage
Sites dialog box.
The Manage Sites dialog box closes.
Using Design Notes
If you sometimes forget the details of your work or neglect to tell your 
colleagues important things about the Web site you’re all working on, 
the Dreamweaver Design Notes feature may save you some grief.
Design Notes are ideal if you want to hide sensitive information from visitors,
such as pricing structures or creative strategies, but make it available to
members of your development team. Information saved as a Design Note in
Dreamweaver can travel with any HTML file or image, even if the file transfers
from one Web site to another or from Fireworks to Dreamweaver.
114
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

Essentially, Design Notes enable you to record information (such as a mes-
sage to another designer on your team) and associate it with a file or folder.
Design Notes work a lot like the comment tag (HTML code that enables you to
embed text in a page that won’t display in a browser) but with a bit more pri-
vacy. Unlike the comment tag, which is embedded directly in the HTML code
of a page (and can be seen if someone views the source code behind a page
on the Web), Design Notes are never visible to your visitors. The only way for
a visitor to view Design Notes is to deliberately type the path to your notes
subdirectory and view the notes files directly. You can even explicitly block
this from being allowed, but only if you have administrative access to your
server. To be even more secure, you can keep the notes on your hard drive
and prevent them from ever being uploaded to your server — though, of
course, your team members won’t see your witty remarks.
To access the Design Notes page, choose Design Notes in the Category list in
the Site Definition dialog box (see Figure 4-17). The settings on this page
enable you to control how Dreamweaver uses Design Notes:
 Maintain Design Notes: Select this option to ensure that the Design Note
remains attached to the file when you upload, copy, or move it.
 Upload Design Notes for Sharing: Choose this option to include Design
Notes when you send files to the server via FTP.
 Clean Up: This button enables you to delete Design Notes no longer
associated with files or folders in your site.
When you create graphics in Macromedia Fireworks, you can save a Design
Note for each image file that is also available in Dreamweaver. To use this
integrated feature, create a Design Note in Fireworks and associate it with the
image. Then when you save the Fireworks image to your local Web site folder,
the Design Note goes with it. When you open the file in Dreamweaver, the
Design Note displays when you right-click the image (Control+click on the
Mac). This feature is a great way for graphic designers to communicate with
other members of the Web development team.
To activate the Design Notes feature, follow these steps:
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites.
The Manage Sites dialog box opens.
2. Select the site you want to work on and then click the Edit button.
The Site Definition dialog box opens.
3. Select the Advanced tab.
4. In the Category list at the left, choose Design Notes.
The Design Notes page appears (refer to Figure 4-17).
115
Chapter 4: Coordinating Your Design Work

5. Select the Maintain Design Notes option.
With this option selected, whenever you copy, move, rename, or delete a
file, the associated Design Notes file is also copied, moved, renamed, or
deleted with it.
6. If you want your Design Notes to be sent with your files when they are
uploaded to your server, select the Upload Design Notes for Sharing
option.
If you’re making notes only to yourself and don’t want them to be associ-
ated with the page when you upload it to the server, deselect this option
and Design Notes is maintained locally but not uploaded with your file.
7. Click OK in the Site Definition dialog box; then click the Done button
in the Manage Sites dialog box.
The Manage Sites dialog box closes.
To add Design Notes to a document, follow these steps:
1. Open the file you want to add a Design Note to and choose File➪
Design Notes.
The Design Notes dialog box opens (see Figure 4-18). You need to have a
file checked out to add or modify a Design Note, but not to read a note.
Figure 4-17:
The Design
Notes page
lets you
include

116

2. Choose the status of the document from the Status drop-down list box.
Your options are Draft, Revision 1, Revision 2, Revision 3, Alpha, Beta,
Final, and Needs Attention. You can choose any status, and you should
set a policy with your design team about what each status means and
how you use these options to manage your development.
3. Type your comments in the Notes text box.
4. Click the Insert Date icon (icon of a calendar page just above the
Notes text box) if you want to insert the current local date.
The current date is inserted automatically.
You can also select the Show When File Is Open check box. If this box is
selected, the Design Notes displays whenever the file is opened so that it
can’t be missed.
5. Click the All Info tab in the Design Notes dialog box.
On the All Info tab, you can add other information that may be useful to
developers of your site. For example, you can name a key designer (in
the Name field) and define the value as the name of that person or the
priority of the project (in the Value field). You also may define a field for
a client or type of file that you commonly use.
6. Click the plus (+) button to add a new information item; click the
minus (–) button to remove a selected item.
7. Click OK to save the notes.
The notes you entered are saved to a subfolder named notes in the same
location as the current file. The filename is the document’s filename, plus
the extension .mno. For example, if the filename is art.htm, the associ-
ated Design Notes file is named art.htm.mno. Design Notes are indicated
in Site View by a small yellow icon that looks like a cartoon bubble.

Chapter 4: Coordinating Your Design Work

Activating Site Map Layout
If you have trouble keeping track of all the files in your Web site and how they
link to one another, you’re not alone. As Web sites get larger and larger, this
task becomes increasingly daunting. That’s why Dreamweaver includes a Site
Map Layout feature — to help you keep track of the structure and hierarchy
of your site. This is not a Site Map like those you often see on Web sites that
links to the main pages of a site. The Dreamweaver Site Map Layout is never
visible to your visitors; it’s a site-management feature designed to help you
visually manage the files and folders in your site. 
To create a site map from the Site Map Layout page, follow these steps:
1. Choose Site➪Manage Sites.
The Manage Sites dialog box opens.
2. Select the name of the site you want to work on.
3. Click the Edit button. 
The Site Definition box opens.
4. Make sure the Advanced tab at the top of the Site Definition dialog
box is selected and the Advanced options are visible.
5. Select the Site Map Layout option from the Category list at the left of
the Site Definition dialog box. 
The Site Map Layout options display in the right side of the Site
Definition dialog box, as shown in Figure 4-19.
6. Click the Browse button (the icon that resembles a file folder) next to
the Home Page text box and browse to find the main folder of your
Web site. Note, if you already filled out the Local Info page for your
site, this field is already filled in.
This text box specifies the location of the home page of the Web site and
the main site folder. This information is essential because it shows
Dreamweaver where the Web site begins and ends. 
7. Specify the number of columns you want to display per row in the 
site map.
If you’re not sure what you want for these settings, start with the default
value of 200. You can always come back and change these settings later
if you don’t like the spacing of the icons in your site map.
8. In the Column Width text box, set the width of the site map’s columns
in pixels.
Again, start with the default 125 if you’re not sure how wide you want
this to display.
118
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

9. In the Icon Labels section, click to put a check mark in the box next to
File Names or Page Titles to specify if you want the filename or the
page title as the label for each page in the site map.
You can manually edit the displayed filename or page title after you gen-
erate the site map.
10. In the Options section, you can choose to hide certain files, meaning
that they won’t be visible in the Site Map window.
If you select the Display Files Marked as Hidden option, files you have
marked as hidden display in italic in the site map.
If you select the Display Dependent Files option, all dependent files in
the site’s hierarchy display. A dependent file is an image or other non-
HTML content that the browser loads when loading the main page.
11. Click OK.
The Site Map is automatically generated.
12. To view the Site Map, open the Files panel on the right side of the
screen and select Map View from the drop-down list in the top-right
corner (see Figure 4-20).
The Site Map displays in the Files panel using icons to represent each
file and link in the site.

Using the File View Columns option
You can use the File View Columns category in the Site Definition dialog box
(see Figure 4-21) to customize how file and folder options display in the
expanded Files panel. This can be useful for sorting or grouping files in novel
ways, for example, by adding a section, department, season, or version
column. You can customize File View Columns in the following ways: 
 You can add up to 10 new columns by clicking the small plus sign at the
top of the dialog box and entering the name, association, and alignment
of each new column.
 You can reorder or realign the order that columns display in by selecting
the name of the column and then clicking the up or down arrows in the
top right of the dialog to move it up or down the list.
 You can hide any columns except the filename column by selecting the
column name and clicking to remove the check mark in the Show box.

 You can designate which (if any) columns are shared with other develop-
ers who have access to the site by selecting the column name and click-
ing to remove the check mark in the Enable Column Sharing box.
 You can delete any of the custom columns (you can not delete default
columns) by selecting the column name and clicking on the minus sign
at the top of the dialog box.
 You can rename custom columns as you would edit a filename.
 You can associate Design Notes with custom columns by selecting the
column name and using the drop-down list next to Design Notes.
Enabling Contribute features
Macromedia Contribute is a program that was created so that people who
don’t know much about Web design can easily contribute to a Web site. Think
of Contribute as sort of a Dreamweaver Light, except that it doesn’t work 
very well as a stand-alone program. Contribute was designed to work on sites
designed in Dreamweaver, and a number of features have been carefully inte-
grated to make that collaboration work smoothly. If you’re working with other
developers of a site who use Contribute, make sure you check the box next to
Enable Contribute Compatibility in the Contribute category of the Site
Definition dialog box.

Chapter 4: Coordinating Your Design Work

Remembering Your History
You can keep track of what you’re doing and even replay your steps with the
History panel. The History panel also lets you undo one or more steps and
create commands to automate repetitive tasks.
To open the History panel, shown in Figure 4-22, choose Window➪History. As
soon as you open a file, the History panel starts automatically recording your
actions as you do work in Dreamweaver. You can’t rearrange the order of
steps in the History panel, but you can copy them, replay them, and undo
them. Don’t think of the History panel as an arbitrary collection of com-
mands; think of it as a way to view the steps you’ve performed, in the order
in which you performed them. This is a great way to let Dreamweaver do
your work for you if you have to repeat the same steps over and over again.
It’s also a lifesaver if you make a major mistake and want to go back one or
more steps in your development work.
Here’s a rundown of how you can put the History panel to use:
 To copy steps you already executed: Use the Copy Steps option as a
quick way to automate steps you want to repeat. You can even select
steps individually, in case you want to replay some (but not all) your
actions exactly as you did them.
 To replay any or all the steps displayed in the History panel: Highlight
the steps you want to replay and click the Replay button in the bottom
of the History panel.
 To undo the results of the replayed steps: Choose Edit➪Undo Replay
Steps.
 To apply steps to a specific element on a page: Highlight that element
in the Document window before selecting and replaying the steps. For
example, if you want to apply bold and italic formatting to just a few
words on a page, you can replay the steps that applied bold and italics
to selected text.
Figure 4-22:
The History
panel keeps
track of
what you
do, making

repeating
any or all
your steps
easy.
122
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

You can also set the number of steps displayed in the History panel by choos-
ing Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver➪Preferences (Mac) and
selecting General from the Category list on the left. The default is 50 steps,
more than enough for most users. The higher the number, the more memory
the History panel uses.
Using the Quick Tag Editor
If you’re one of those developers who likes to work in the Dreamweaver
WYSIWYG editing environment but still wants to look at the HTML tags 
once in a while, you’ll love the Quick Tag Editor.
The Quick Tag Editor, as the name implies, lets you quickly access HTML tags
and enables you to modify, add, or remove an HTML tag without opening the
HTML Source window. That means that while you’re in the middle of working
on a page in Design view, you can view the HTML tag you are working on
without switching over to Code view. You can use the Quick Tag Editor to
insert HTML, edit an existing tag, or wrap new tags around a selected text
block or other element.
The Quick Tag Editor opens in one of three modes — Edit, Insert, or Wrap —
depending on what you selected on the page before you launched the editor.
Use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+T (Windows) or Ô+T (Macintosh) to change
modes while the Quick Tag Editor is open.
You can enter or edit tags in the Quick Tag Editor just as you would in 
Code view, without having to switch back and forth between Code view 
and Design view.
123
Chapter 4: Coordinating Your Design Work
Repeating your steps with Recorded Commands
You can automate repeat tasks using Dream-
weaver’s Recorded Commands feature, avail-
able from the Commands menu. Simply start the
record option, execute any series of actions in
Dreamweaver, stop, and save them. Then you
just replay the recording to repeat the actions
automatically. 
To use the Recorded Commands option, choose
Commands➪Start Recording and then carefully
execute a series of steps that you want to be
able to repeat. When you complete the steps
you want to record, choose Commands➪Stop
Recording and name the command to save it. To
play the actions back, choose Commands➪Play
Recorded Command and select your new com-
mand. Then kick back and watch the action, or
better yet, take a break and get out of your
office for a change.

To enter or edit tags in the Quick Tag Editor, follow these steps:
1. With the document you want to edit open, select an element or text
block.
If you want to add new code, simply click anywhere in the file without
selecting text or an element.
2. Choose Modify➪Quick Tag Editor.
You can also press Ctrl+T (Windows) or Ô+T (Macintosh).
The Quick Tag Editor opens in the mode that is most appropriate for
your selection, as shown in Figure 4-23. For example, if you click an
image or formatted text, it displays the current tag so that you can edit
it. If you don’t select anything, or if you select unformatted text, the
Quick Tag Editor opens with nothing in it, and you can enter the code
you want to add. Press Ctrl+T (Ô+T) to switch to another mode.
If you want to edit an existing tag, go to Step 3. If you want to add a new
tag, skip to Step 4.
3. If you selected an element formatted with multiple HTML tags or a tag
with multiple attributes, press Tab to move from one tag, attribute
name, or attribute value to the next. Press Shift+Tab to move back to
the previous one.
Figure 4-23:
You can
view and
edit HTML
tags in the

124
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

If you aren’t sure about a tag or attribute, pause for a couple of seconds
and a drop-down list appears automatically, offering you a list of all the
tags or attributes available for the element you are editing. If this Hints
list doesn’t appear, choose Edit➪Preferences➪Code Hints (Windows) or
Dreamweaver➪Preferences➪Code Hints (Mac) and make sure that the
Enable Code Hints option is selected.
4. To add a new tag or attribute, simply type the code into the Quick Tag
Editor.
You can use the Tab and arrow keys to move the cursor where you want
to add code. You can keep the Quick Tag Editor open and continue to
edit and add attribute names and values as long as you like.
5. To close the Quick Tag Editor and apply all your changes, press Enter
(Windows) or Return (Mac).

Adding Graphics
In This Chapter
 Creating images
 Using royalty-free images
 Choosing a graphics program
 Keeping file sizes small
 Image editing in Dreamweaver
 Using image maps
N
o matter how great the writing may be on your Web site, the graphics
always get people’s attention first. And the key to making a good first
impression is to use images that look great, download quickly, and are appro-
priate to your Web site.
If you’re familiar with using a graphics-editing program to create graphics,
you’re a step ahead. If not, you find pointers throughout this chapter, and you
discover how to find preexisting graphics to use on your Web site. You also
find out how to bring graphics into Dreamweaver and how to edit them with-
out leaving the Web design environment. To help you get the most out of the
images for your site, you find information about choosing an image-editing
program and keeping image file sizes small.
If your images are ready and you want to dive into placing them on your
pages, jump ahead to the “Inserting Images on Your Pages” section and find
out how to place and align images, create image maps, and set a background
image in Dreamweaver. You also discover some of Dreamweaver’s newest fea-
tures, which enable you to crop images and even adjust contrast and bright-
ness without ever launching an external image-editing program.
Getting Great Graphics
You want your Web graphics to look good, but where do you get them? If you
have some design talent, you can create your own images with Photoshop,
Fireworks, or any other image program (you find descriptions of the most

popular programs in the section “Creating your own images,” later in this
chapter). If you’re not an artist, you may be better off gathering images from
clip art collections (libraries of ready-to-use image files) and using royalty-free
or stock photography, as described in this section. If you have a scanner, you
can also scan in existing photographs or logos.
To create textures for backgrounds and buttons on your site, try scanning
fabrics, handmade papers, and other textured objects. You can scan anything
you can put against the glass of your scanner, even medals, coins, and other
things you may have around the house or office. (Just be careful not to
scratch the delicate glass on the scanner.)
Dreamweaver doesn’t have any image-creation capabilities of its own, and
only limited editing tools, so you need to use an image-editing program such
as Photoshop to create or edit images. If you bought Macromedia Studio,
you’re in luck because it includes Fireworks (a great image editor for Web
graphics). No matter what program you use to create and edit your images,
you can set Dreamweaver’s preferences to launch that program when you
choose to edit an image from within Dreamweaver. If you have Macromedia
Studio, the association is automatically set when you install the program. If
you want to use a different image editor, choose File➪Preferences, choose
the Category File Types/Editors, and use the Browse button to add your soft-
ware program.
Buying royalty-free clip 
art and photographs
If you don’t want the hassle of creating your own images (or if you lack the
artistic talent), you may be happy to find many sources of clip art available.
Royalty-free images, which include clip art and photographs, are generally
sold for a one-time fee that grants you all or most of the rights to use the
image. (Read the agreement that comes with any art you purchase to make
sure that you don’t miss any exclusions or exceptions. For example, you may
have to pay extra to use an image for commercial purposes.) You can find a
wide range of CD-ROMs and Web sites full of clip art, photographs, and even
animations that you can use on your Web site. (Speaking of animations, nowa-
days, you can even find Web sites that sell Flash files, animations, buttons,
and other artistic elements that you can edit and integrate into your Web site.
For more info on how to add multimedia to your Web site, see Chapter 12.)
Many professional designers buy clip art images and then alter them in an
image program — such as Macromedia Fireworks, Adobe Illustrator, or Adobe
Photoshop — to tailor them for a specific project or to make the image more
distinct. 
128
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

Here are some clip art suppliers:
 Getty Images, Inc. (www.gettyimages.com): Getty Images is the largest
supplier of royalty-free digital imagery on the Web, specializing in pho-
tographs and illustrations of a wide variety of subjects, including film
footage. Pay for images and footage as you go.
 Stockbyte (www.stockbyte.com): Stockbyte is a great source for inter-
national royalty-free photos. You can purchase photographs in a variety
of qualities, as you need them.
 Photos.com (www.photos.com): Photos.com is a subscription-based 
service for royalty-free stock photography and photo objects. A 1- to 
12-month subscription gives you unlimited access and use of its 
collection.
 iStockphoto.com (www.istockphoto.com): An innovative variation of
the fee-for-use model, iStockphoto lets you trade your own photographs
for stock images.
 Web Promotion (www.webpromotion.com): A great source for animated
GIFs and other Web graphics. Artwork on this site is free provided you
create a link back to Web Promotion on your Web site, or you can buy
the artwork for a small fee.
 Fonts.com (www.fonts.com): If you’re looking to enhance your font col-
lection, which is a good idea if you want to create distinctive Web graph-
ics with text, you can preview and purchase a huge number of fonts at
Fonts.com. You can search this site by font name or using descriptive
keywords. Keywords help if you need a specific font but don’t know its
name.
Creating your own images
The best way to get original images is to create your own. If you’re not graphi-
cally talented or inclined, consider hiring someone who can create images for
you. If you want to create your own images for use in Dreamweaver, Fireworks
is a good program to start with because it’s tightly integrated with Dream-
weaver and has a similar interface.
The last few years have seen a tremendous advancement in the features and
capabilities of specialized Web graphics programs as well as increased compe-
tition between application vendors. In the future, expect even more changes
because two of the biggest competitors — Adobe and Macromedia — are
working on merging into one company and both Fireworks and Photoshop
may change as a result). Most professional designers strongly prefer Adobe

Photoshop, although I have to say I’ve been quite impressed with Photoshop
Elements, which is a “light” version, but offers many of the same features for a
fraction of the cost. (If you’re designing images for print, you need Photoshop;
but for the Web, Elements is a surprisingly complete, low-cost alternative.) For
vector-based graphics (a good choice for illustrations), Adobe Illustrator is
the favorite.
The following is a list of the most popular image-editing programs on the
market today. Unless otherwise indicated, all the following image programs
are available for both Mac and Windows:
 Macromedia Fireworks (www.macromedia.com/software/fireworks):
Fireworks was one of the very first image-editing programs designed
specifically to create and edit Web graphics. Fireworks gives you every-
thing you need to create, edit, and output the best-looking Web graphics,
all in one well-designed product. Besides sharing a common interface with
Dreamweaver, Fireworks also integrates extremely well with Dreamweaver
to speed up and simplify the process of building a Web site. In Chapter 11,
you discover some of the special features of Fireworks and Dreamweaver
that help you to work with these two programs.
 Adobe Photoshop (www.adobe.com/products): Adobe calls Photoshop
the “camera of the mind.” This is unquestionably the most popular
image-editing program on the market and a widely used standard among
graphics professionals. With Photoshop, you can create original artwork,
correct color in photographs, retouch photographs, scan images, and do
much more. Photoshop has a wealth of powerful painting and selection
tools in addition to special effects and filters to create images that go
beyond what you can capture on film or create with other illustration
programs. And Photoshop includes everything you need for creating and
editing Web graphics.
 Adobe Photoshop Elements (www.adobe.com/products): If you’re not
designing images for print use, and you don’t need all the bells and whis-
tles offered in the full-blown version of Photoshop, Photoshop Elements
is a remarkably powerful program — for about a sixth of the cost of
Photoshop. Elements is especially well suited for Web graphics output
and is easier to learn than Photoshop.
 Adobe Illustrator (www.adobe.com/products): Illustrator is one of the
industry standards for creating vector-based graphics, ideally suited for
illustrations. Adobe integrates all its design programs so you can drag
and drop illustrations that you create in Illustrator right into other Adobe
programs, such as Photoshop or InDesign. Illustrator also comes with an
export feature that enables you to export your illustrations in GIF or JPEG
format with a browser-friendly palette of colors so that your illustrations
look great on the Web.

 CorelDRAW Essentials (www.corel.com): Another competitor in the
graphics market, CorelDRAW offers features and capabilities similar to
those of Adobe Photoshop for a fraction of the price. The Essentials pack-
age comes with CorelDRAW and Corel PHOTO-PAINT and includes a gener-
ous clip art and royalty-free photography collection. For less than the cost
of Photoshop, you can get the complete CorelDRAW Graphics Suite.
 Paint Shop Pro (www.corel.com): Also by Corel, Paint Shop Pro is a full-
featured painting and image-manipulation program available only for
Windows. Paint Shop Pro is similar to Photoshop, but on a more limited
scale because it doesn’t offer the same range of effects, tools, and filters.
However, it costs less than Photoshop and may be a good starter pro-
gram for novice image-makers.
 Macromedia Freehand (www.macromedia.com/software/freehand):
Macromedia Freehand is an illustration program used widely both on
the Web and in print. Freehand has many excellent Web features, includ-
ing support for Web file formats such as GIF, PNG, and JPEG, as well as
vector formats such as Flash (.SWF) and Shockwave FreeHand (.FHC).
Thirty-day trial versions are available for free on the Macromedia Web
site.
 MicroFrontier Color It! (www.microfrontier.com): This low-cost, easy-
to-use graphics program is available only for the Macintosh and is a
great tool for beginners, as well as those on a tight budget. Although it’s
much more limited than many of the other programs in this list, it pro-
vides enough features to create basic banners and buttons for a small
business Web site. A demo version is available for free from the
MicroFrontier Web site.
Understanding the Basics 
of Web Graphics
Because having a basic understanding of graphics formats and how they
work on the Web is so important, the following sections give you an overview
of what you need to know about graphics as you create them or place them
on your pages.
The most important thing to keep in mind when placing images on a Web
page is that you want to optimize your images to keep your file sizes as 
small as possible. You may ask, “How small is small?” In fact, this is one of 
the most common questions people ask about Web graphics. The answer is
largely subjective — remember that the larger your graphics files are, the
131
Chapter 5: Adding Graphics

longer people have to wait for them to download before they can see them.
You may have the most beautiful picture of Mount Fuji on the front page of
your Web site, but if it takes forever to download, most people aren’t going 
to be patient enough to wait to see it. Also remember that when you build
pages with multiple graphics, you have to consider the cumulative download
time of all the graphics on the page. So smaller is definitely better. 
Most Web pros consider anything from about 75K to 150K a good maximum
cumulative size for all the elements on a given page. With the increasing pop-
ularity of DSL and cable modems, many Web sites are starting to become a
bit more graphics-heavy. However, anything over 150K is pushing the limits,
especially if you expect people with dialup modems (56K and under) to stick
around long enough to view your pages. 
To make determining the total file size of the images on your page easy,
Dreamweaver includes this information in the status bar of the current
Document window, as shown in Figure 5-1. This number indicates the total
file size of all the images and HTML on your page as well as the expected
download time at a given connection speed. (You can set your own connec-
tion speed by choosing Edit➪Preferences➪Status Bar➪Connection Speed. On
a Mac, choose Dreamweaver➪Preferences➪Status Bar➪Connection Speed).
Achieving small file sizes requires using compression techniques and color
reduction — tasks that you can achieve using any of the graphics programs
mentioned in the preceding section. Whatever program you use, you should
understand that you can reduce image sizes to varying degrees and that the
challenge is to find the best balance between small file size and good image
quality. If you really want to find out the best ways to create graphics for the
Web, read Web Design For Dummies by Lisa Lopuck (Wiley Publishing, Inc.). 
It has a fantastic section on designing Web graphics.

Use GIFs for animations and transparency
GIF is the most widely accepted Web file format
that can have transparent pixels to create a
transparency effect. (The PNG format does
also, but its support is spotty.) GIFs can also
have multiple frames, so you can create small,
animated loops with this format. Animated ads
on the Web, generally referred to as banners,
are sometimes made in GIF.
Designers frequently create a GIF that just con-
sists of words because it allows them to use
nonstandard fonts with perfect anti-aliasing and
whatever colors and effects they want without
worrying about whether the end user has the
font installed. GIF is the ideal format for this
because it offers more control over color com-
pression, whereas JPEG compression can
make the small lines and curves in text fuzzy. 

One of the most common questions about images for the Web concerns when
you use GIF and when you use JPEG. The simple answer:
Use
For
GIF
Line art (such as one- or two-color logos), simple drawings,
animations, images with a transparent background, and basi-
cally any image that has no gradients or blends
JPEG
Colorful, complex images (such as photographs), images con-
taining gradients or color blends, and so on
That said, sometimes the best thing to do is just experiment with both for-
mats and see which yields the best results. In time, you’ll get a knack for
which is the best format to use, depending on the type of image you’re 
working with.

Inserting Images on Your Pages
Dreamweaver makes placing images on your Web pages easy. 
Before inserting any images into your page, saving your page is important.
After you save, Dreamweaver knows the directory location of the page and
can then properly create the image links.
To place an image on a Web page, follow these steps:
1. Open an existing page or choose File➪New to create a new page.
You can create a basic HTML page or any of the template or other options
available in the New Document dialog box. With the exception of the
dynamic page options (covered in Chapters 13, 14, and 15), the insert
image options work the same no matter what kind of page you create.
2. Make sure you save your page before inserting an image by choosing
File➪Save and saving it to your main site folder. 
3. Click the Insert Image icon on the Common Insert bar at the top of the
work area (the icon looks like a small tree) and choose Image from the
drop-down list.
The Select Image Source dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-2.
4. In the Select Image Source dialog box, browse to locate the image you
want to insert.
Alternatively, you can insert images simply by choosing Insert➪Image,
which also brings up the Select Image Source dialog box, or by dragging
Figure 5-2:
You can

preview the
image you
want to
place in the

dialog box.
134

and dropping image files from the Files panel right onto your
Dreamweaver document.
Dreamweaver only lets you insert images in valid Web graphics file for-
mats, such as GIF or JPEG. 
5. Double-click the image to insert it or click once and then click OK.
The image automatically appears on your page.
When you insert an image file onto a page, you create a link from the page to
the image, much as you do when you create a link from one page to another.
As a result, if your images and the pages they are linked to are not in the
same relative location on your hard drive as they are on your server, you
break the links and your images do not appear on your pages (instead you
get that ugly broken GIF image). The best way to make sure your images and
files stay where they’re supposed to in relation to one another is to save
them all in one main site folder and identify that folder using Dreamweaver’s
Site Setup features covered in Chapter 2. 
135
Chapter 5: Adding Graphics
How an image appears on a Web page
The HTML tag that you use to place images on a
Web page is similar to the link tag that you use to
create hyperlinks between pages. Both tags
instruct the browser where to find something. In
the case of the link tag, the path to the linked
page instructs the browser where to find another
URL. In the case of an image tag, the path in the
tag instructs the browser to find a GIF or JPEG
image file. The path describes the location of the
image in relation to the page on which it appears.
For example, images/baby.gif is a path that
instructs a browser to look for an image file
called baby.gif in the images directory. This
path also implies that the images directory is in
the same directory as the HTML file containing
the link. Whenever you see a forward slash in
HTML, it signifies a directory (or folder) that con-
tains other files or folders.
Trying to determine the path can get a little com-
plicated. Fortunately, Dreamweaver sets the
path for you, but you need to take care of two
important steps before Dreamweaver can do
this properly:
1. Save your page.
When you save a page, Dreamweaver auto-
matically remembers the exact location of
the page in relation to the image. Saving the
file is essential because the path always
indicates the location of an image relative to
the page containing the link (this is called a
relative link). If you forget to save your file
beforehand, Dreamweaver always prompts
you to save the file before completing the
link. If you don’t save the file, Dreamweaver
inserts an absolute link that references the
image’s location on your hard drive, but this
link isn’t valid on any other machine or when
you upload your Web site. An absolute link
to your hard drive works on your machine,
but not on your Web server — or any other
machine, for that matter.
2. Define your site and identify your main
Web site folder using the Site Setup fea-
tures covered in Chapter 2.

Aligning Images on a Page
After you place an image on your Web page, you may want to center or align
it so that text can wrap around it. In the following two sections — “Centering
an image” and “Aligning an image with text wrapping” — you find out the
steps to accomplish both these goals.
Centering an image
To center an image on a page, follow these steps:
1. Click to select the image that you want to center.
The Properties inspector changes to display the image properties.
2. From the icons for alignment options in the Properties inspector,
shown in Figure 5-3, click the Align Center icon.
The image automatically moves to the center of the page. 
Aligning an image with text wrapping
To align an image to the right of a page and wrap text around it on the left,
follow these steps:
1. Insert the image immediately to the left of the first line of the text (see
Figure 5-4).
The easiest way to do this is to place the cursor just before the first
letter of text; then choose Insert➪Image.
Don’t put spaces or line breaks between the image and the text.

2. Click to select the image.
The Properties inspector changes to display the image attribute options.
3. In the Properties inspector, choose Right from the Align drop-down
list.
The image aligns to the right and the text automatically wraps around it,
as shown in Figure 5-5.
To align the image to the left of the page with text wrapping around on the
left, follow Steps 1 and 2, and then in Step 3, choose Left from the Align drop-
down list instead of Right.
To prevent text from running up against an image, click the image, find V and H
spacing on the Properties inspector, and enter the amount of space you want
(the space is measured in pixels). Five to ten pixels is usually enough to add
space around the image and prevent the text from bumping up against its edge.
If you want to add space to only one side of an image, it’s a bit more work, but
you can more precisely control spacing with CSS (covered in Chapter 8). You
can also use an image-editing program to add a transparent border to the edge
of a GIF or add a few pixels that match the background to a JPEG.

Chapter 5: Adding Graphics

Creating complex designs with images
The alignment options available in HTML enable you to align your images
vertically or horizontally, but you can’t do both at once. Also, the alignment
options don’t really enable you to position images in relation to one another
or in relation to text with much precision. For example, if you try to center an
image that is positioned up against a text block, the text gets centered, too.
One way to get around this limitation is to create HTML tables and then com-
bine and merge cells in the table to control positioning. See Chapter 6 to find
out how you can make table borders invisible and use them to create com-
plex layouts. You can also use layers (Chapter 9) and Cascading Style Sheets
to position elements on a page (Chapter 8).
Image Editing in Dreamweaver
New features in Dreamweaver enable you to do minor image editing inside
Dreamweaver without opening Fireworks or any other graphics-editing pro-
gram. These tools are available from the Properties inspector when an image
is selected (see Figure 5-6). 
Figure 5-5:
The Align
drop-down
list in the
Properties
panel aligns

138
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

You also find two buttons that enable you to use Macromedia Fireworks to
edit images. The Edit button launches Fireworks and opens the selected image
in the main window of the program, which makes using all the Fireworks edit-
ing features easy. Macromedia’s careful integration of these programs means
that when you save changes to the image in Fireworks, they are reflected in
the page in Dreamweaver. A new button, just to the right of the Edit button, is
designed to make optimizing an image fast and easy, which makes download-
ing faster. Chapter 10 covers both the Edit and Optimize in Fireworks features
in greater detail.
Before you get carried away editing your images, remember that Dreamweaver
is primarily a Web-page creation application and not really designed to edit
graphics. Although these tools can be useful, they shouldn’t take the place of
doing serious work on your graphics in an actual graphics application, such as
Fireworks or Photoshop.
When you do use the tools for cropping, adjusting brightness and contrast,
and sharpening an image, beware that you are changing the actual image (not
just a copy of it). Make sure you’re happy with these changes before you save
the page you’re working on. You can use the undo feature in Dreamweaver to
revert back several steps, but after you save the page, you can’t undo changes
to an image. To protect your original image, considering saving a copy before
editing it.
Cropping an image
Essentially, cropping an image is trimming it. To crop a graphic or photo,
follow these steps:
1. In the Document window, select the image you’d like to crop by click-
ing it.
The Properties inspector changes to display the image’s properties.

2. From the Edit icons, click the Crop tool.
A dialog box appears warning you that cropping changes the original
image.
Don’t make the change if you’re concerned about needing to keep the
entire image available. If you’re concerned, the best thing to do may be
to make a copy of the image and apply your cropping to the copy.
3. Click OK.
A dotted line with handlebars appears in the image.
4. Outline the area of the image you want to keep with the handlebars. 
Any part of the image that is darkened, as shown in Figure 5-7, is deleted
when the crop completes.
5. Double-click inside the box, or press Enter (Return on a Mac).
The image is cropped.
You can undo cropping by choosing Edit➪Undo, but remember that, after you
save the page, changes permanently apply to the image and cannot be undone.

Adjusting brightness and contrast
Adjusting an image’s brightness allows you to change the overall amount of
light in an image. Contrast controls the difference between the light and dark
areas of an image. To adjust brightness and contrast, follow these steps:
1. In the Document window, select the image you want to alter.
The Properties inspector shows the image properties.
2. From the Edit tools, click the Brightness and Contrast icon (a circle
with light and dark halves).
A dialog box appears, indicating that changes you make are made to the
original file.
3. Click OK.
The Brightness/Contrast dialog box appears.
4. Adjust the brightness and contrast settings of the image with the 
sliders.
Make sure to select the Preview check box if you want to see how the
changes affect the image as you move the sliders around.
5. Click OK.
The settings take effect permanently when you save the page.
Sharpening an image
When you apply sharpening to an image, you increase the distinction
between areas of color. The effect can be one of increased definition to the
shapes and lines in an image. To sharpen an image, follow these steps:
1. In the Document window, select the image you want to sharpen.
The Properties inspector shows the image properties.
2. From the Edit tools, click the Sharpen icon (a blue cone).
A dialog box appears, indicating that your change is made to the original
file.
3. Click OK.
The Sharpen dialog box appears.
4. Adjust the sharpness of the image with the slider.
Make sure you select the Preview check box if you want to see how the
changes affect the image as you move the slider.

5. Click OK.
The image is sharpened and changes are made permanently when you
save changes to the page.
Using the Transparent GIF Trick
You may find it strange that I suggest you place an invisible image on a Web
page, but that’s exactly what I show you how to do in this section. A small,
transparent GIF is a powerful element in Web page design because you can
use it to control the exact position of other elements on a page. You’ll notice
that some other programs, such as Fireworks, also utilize transparent GIFs to
force page elements into place more precisely. In Fireworks, transparent GIFs
are automatically generated, and you can often recognize them because they
use names such as transparent.gif, clear.gif, or spacer.gif.
Regardless of the name, they all perform the same function. 
To create your own transparent GIF, simply create a new document in any
image editor with the background set to Transparent. Then don’t add any-
thing to the image before saving it as a GIF with the Transparent option
selected. The result is an image that is invisible, but very useful for spacing
purposes.
If you don’t want to create your own transparent GIF or you just want to prac-
tice the following steps, you can download a free transparent GIF from my
Web site at www.DigitalFamily.com/free (just look at the bottom of the
page for the image that doesn’t appear to be there, but is displayed under 
the Transparent GIFs headline and outlined so you can find it).
Some Web designers recommend that you create a single-pixel graphic for this
purpose, but I find that a 10 x 10-pixel image works best because it’s easier to
select after you place it on your page in Dreamweaver. Remember, even if the
clear GIF is 10 x 10 pixels, you change the height and width to any size because
HTML enables you to specify any height and width for an image regardless of
its actual size. Thus, you can alter the image attributes for height and width to
adjust your transparent GIF to be larger or smaller depending on how much
space you want between other visible elements on your page.
Dreamweaver makes using the transparent GIF trick easy because you have
easy access to the height and width attributes in the Properties inspector.
You may also need to specify the alignment of the image to achieve the
desired effect.
142
Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

To use a transparent GIF between images, text, or other elements on a page,
follow these steps:
1. Click to insert your cursor wherever you want the transparent GIF 
on your page — between two images or within a block of text, for
example.
2. Choose File➪Insert and browse to select your transparent GIF.
3. Click OK.
The transparent GIF is inserted on your page and automatically selected.
4. With your transparent GIF still selected, alter the height and width
(the H and W fields in the Properties inspector) until it is the size of
the space you want to create.
The transparent GIF automatically adjusts to the height and width 
specified.
When you select a transparent GIF you can see the outline of the image while
it’s selected. Notice that as soon as you deselect the image, it becomes invisi-
ble in Dreamweaver. You can always reselect it by clicking in the area until the
cursor highlights it. Just beware that selecting it can be tricky because it’s not
visible, especially if you make it very small. For this reason, I recommend
resizing the GIF as soon as you place it on the page while it’s still highlighted.
Creating a Background
Background images can bring life to a Web page by adding color and fullness.
Used cleverly, a background image helps create the illusion that the entire
page is one large image while still downloading quickly and efficiently. The
trick is to use a small background image that creates a dramatic effect when
it tiles (repeats) across and down the page (see Figure 5-8).
Background images are often called tiles, because they repeat like tiles across
a kitchen floor. However, if you use a long, narrow image as a background or a
large image that’s small in file size, you can create many effects beyond a
repeating tile.
Beware that certain backgrounds (such as the one shown in Figure 5-9) can
make reading text that’s placed on top of them hard. Choose your back-
ground images carefully and make sure your background and your text has
plenty of contrast — reading on a computer screen is hard enough.

Part II: Looking Like a Million (Even on a Budget) 

As you work with backgrounds, you may find another use for a transparent
GIF. If you place a graphic on top of a patterned background, you end up with
a rectangular area around the graphic that obscures the patterned back-
ground, as shown in Figure 5-10. To allow the background to be visible
around, say, a headline, you can create your headline graphic on top of a
color similar to the dominant color used in the background. When you save
the GIF, set that color to be transparent. Placed on the page, the headline
looks as if it’s floating on top of the pattern (see Figure 5-11).
You may find that you need to change the color of text to make it stand out
better against a background. Notice that in Figure 5-10 the black text looks
good against the white background of the GIF, but after I made the GIF trans-
parent, I saw that white text was easier to read against the dark green back-
ground pattern and changed the text color accordingly.
To insert a background image on a Web page, follow these steps:
1. Choose Modify➪Page Properties.
The Page Properties dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 5-12.
2. Click Appearance from the Category list on the left.

When you insert an image in your Web site, you want to make sure that
the image is in the same relative location on your hard drive as it is on
your server. If you plan to use your background tile throughout your
site, you may want to store it in a common images folder where you can
easily link to the image from any page in your site. See Chapter 3 for
details on organizing image files.
5. Double-click the filename of your background image to select it.
The Select Image Source dialog box disappears.
6. Click OK in the Page Properties dialog box to finish.
Note that if you click the Apply button, you see the effect of the back-
ground tile being applied to the page, but the Page Properties dialog box
stays open.
If you don’t want a background image to tile, choose the No-Repeat option
from the Repeat drop-down list in the Page Properties dialog box and the
image appears only in the top-right of the document.
Creating Image Maps
Image maps are popular on the Web because they enable you to create hot
spots in an image and link them to different URLs. A common use of an image
map is a geographic map, such as a map of the United States, that links to dif-
ferent locations, depending on the section of the map selected. For example,
if you have a national bank and want customers to find a local branch or ATM
machine easily, you can create hot spots on an image map of the United
States and then link each hot spot to a page listing banks in that geographic
location. Dreamweaver makes creating image maps easy by providing a set of
simple drawing tools that enable you to create hot spots and set their corre-
sponding links.
To create an image map, follow these steps:
1. Place the image you want to use as an image map on your page.
2. Select the image.
The image properties display in the Properties inspector.
3. To draw your hot spot, choose a shape tool from the Image Map tools
in the lower-left of the Properties inspector (see Figure 5-13).
147
Chapter 5: Adding Graphics

The shape tools include a rectangle, a circle, and an irregular polygon
that allow you to draw regions on your images, called hot spots, each
with a specific link.
4. With the shape tool selected, click and drag over an area of the image
that you want to make hot (link to another page). Here’s how the dif-
ferent hot spot tools work:
• Rectangle: As you click and drag, a light blue highlight appears
around the region that you’re making hot; this highlighted area
indicates the active region. If you need to reposition the hot area,
select the Pointer Hotspot Tool (black arrow) from the lower-left
corner of the Properties inspector and then select and move the
region to the location you want. You can also resize it by clicking
and dragging any of the corners.
• Circle: The circle tool works much like the rectangle tool — just
click and drag. To resize a circle hot spot, select the Pointer
Hotspot Tool, and click and drag one of the small square boxes 
on its edges.
• Polygon: The polygon tool functions a little bit differently; to make
a polygon selection (such as one of the state of California in a U.S.

map), you click the tool once for each point of the polygon shape
you want to draw. The shape automatically connects the points as
you click. When you’re done, switch to another map tool or click
outside the image. You can change the size of the polygon or move
any of its points by using the Pointer Hotspot Tool.
5. To link a selected hot area, click the Folder icon next to the Link text
box (at the top of the Properties inspector).
The Select File dialog box opens.
6. Browse to find the HTML file that you want to link to the hot spot on
your image.
7. Double-click the file to which you want to link.
The hot spot links to the selected page and the Select File dialog box
automatically closes. You can also type the path directly in the Link text
box if you know it, so you don’t have to find it on your hard drive.
8. To add more hot spots, choose an image and a shape tool, and repeat
Steps 4 through 7.
9. To give your image map a name, type a name in the Map text field,
just above the shape tools.
Giving your map (and all the hot spots it includes) a name helps to dis-
tinguish it in the event that you have multiple image maps on the same
page. You can call the map anything you want, with the exception that
you can’t include spaces or special punctuation.
When you finish, you see all your image map hot spots indicated by a
light blue highlight.
At any time, you can go back and edit the image map by clicking and high-
lighting the blue region on your image and dragging the edges to resize the
hot spot or by entering a new URL to change the link.

o create the most advanced designs in HTML, you
need to use tables, frames, Cascading Style Sheets
(CSS), or layers. This part introduces you to all of these
design options and helps you decide which features offer
the best options for your Web site. If you choose tables,
Chapter 6 walks you through the steps to create tables for
data and design. It also covers nested tables, merged
cells, and so much more. Chapter 7 covers how to divide a
page with frames, when this option is warranted, and how
to target links so your pages work as you intend. In
Chapter 8, you discover the power and design control that
can only be achieved with CSS. As CSS becomes increas-
ingly well supported on the Web, designers are  taking the
leap and enjoying the rewards. In version Dreamweaver 8,
Macromedia has worked hard to give you the best tools to
use these advanced design features.

any people find the limitations of basic HTML frustrating. Professional
designers get especially annoyed when they discover that they don’t
have the design control they’re used to in print — they can’t align elements
as precisely as they want, can’t layer images so they overlap, or can’t adjust
the line spacing in text.  
Although more recent developments in CSS and layers provide far better
design control than the early days of HTML, you still can’t do everything you
can do in print. Worse yet, you risk losing some of your audience when you
use the latest CSS and layer options because, as you discover in the sidebar
“Choosing between tables and layers,” not everyone on the Internet uses the
latest browser. 
For this reason, HTML tables have long been the most common way to work
around these limitations because using tables make it possible to create com-
plex designs without sacrificing audience. That’s changing as more and more
people are equipped with browsers that can handle CSS and layers, but today
many people still use tables to do Web-page design. 
This chapter helps you appreciate how tables work for layout and what you
can do with them that you can’t do with basic HTML formatting. If you have
ever used a desktop publishing program, such as QuarkXPress or Adobe
InDesign, you have probably used text and image boxes to lay out pages.
Layers work almost exactly like text boxes in a page-design program — tables
achieve a similar effect, but with a little more effort. With tables, you place
images and text in table cells and, by merging and splitting cells, you can

create almost any page design you could want. For example, you can use a
table to align two columns of text side by side with a headline across the top
like the format you might see in a newspaper. Because you can make the bor-
ders of a table invisible, you can prevent the table itself from displaying. You
still don’t get the design control you’re used to in a desktop publishing pro-
gram, but with a little ingenuity, you can create complex page designs despite
the limitations.
This chapter is designed to show you how to create HTML tables for every-
thing from columnar data to complex page designs. Tables are a bit compli-
cated to create and not as precise as you might like them to be, but Dream-
weaver has a number of tools that make creating tables easier.
Creating Tables in Layout Mode
Tables are made up of three basic elements: rows, columns, and cells. If you
have ever worked with a spreadsheet program, you’re probably familiar with
what tables are all about. Tables in HTML differ from spreadsheet tables mainly
in that they’re used for more complex alignment of data, which requires lots of
merging and splitting cells. Back in the days when you had to design Web pages
in raw HTML code by hand, even simple tables were difficult to create. The
code behind an HTML table is a complex series of <TR> and <TD> tags that 
indicate table rows and table data cells. Figuring out how to type those tags
so that they create a series of little boxes on a Web page was never an intu-
itive process. If you wanted to merge or split cells to create rows or columns
with varying amount of cells, you faced a truly complex challenge.
Thank the cybergods that you have Dreamweaver to make this process easy.
Using Dreamweaver, you can modify both the appearance and the structure
of a table by simply clicking and dragging its edges. You can add any type of
content to a cell, such as images, text, and multimedia files — even a smaller
table. Using the Properties inspector, you can easily merge and split cells,
add color to the background or border, and change the vertical and horizon-
tal alignment of elements within a cell. And, you can easily alter your table if
you change your mind about how you want the table to look after you have
built it.
The easiest way to work with tables in Dreamweaver is to switch to Layout
mode and use the special Layout Cell and Layout Table tools described in the
following steps. With these tools, available only in Layout mode, Dreamweaver
makes table creation much more intuitive. You can even switch between the
two modes, Standard and Layout, to take advantage of all Dreamweaver’s
table features. 
154
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

Layout mode provides a special view of your page elements designed to
assist in the construction and editing of tables. In this mode, you can draw
cells anywhere on a page and then drag the edges of a table to change its
size. Figures 6-1 and 6-2 show the same table in Layout mode and Standard
mode. You can tell the difference in modes by the way the table displays in
Dreamweaver or by checking the Layout Mode and Standard Mode icons on
the Layout Insert bar at the top of the work area.
155
Chapter 6: Coming to the HTML Table
Choosing between tables and layers 
More and more pages on the Web are designed
with layers, and you can expect to see that
trend continue. As Internet users upgrade their
browsers and newer browsers support layers
better and better, their advantages are quickly
outweighing the limitations.
Layers are much easier to control than tables,
especially in Dreamweaver where you can
simply click and drag to place them wherever you
want on a page. You can put any element in a
layer, including images, text, and multimedia files.
You can even stack layers on top of each other,
and you get down-to-the-pixel design control,
which is far better than what you get with tables.
So why doesn’t everyone use layers? Because
if your visitors use older browsers (Netscape or
Internet Explorer 4.0 and earlier) layers won’t
display in their browsers, meaning any text or
images you place in a layer do not appear as
you intended. Even newer browsers aren’t
always consistent about how they display
layers, so some of your visitors may have unpre-
dictable results, such as elements where you
didn’t intend them or misalignment of text and
images. Thus, what you gain in design control
with layers, you may lose twice over for some-
one using an old browser. For this reason, some
designers still prefer tables, and they continue
to be an important design tool on the Web.
Ultimately, you have to base your decision on
whether to use layers or tables on what you know
about your audience. Depending on your server,
you may be able to check the log statistics and
see what versions of browsers your visitors use
(your service provider or system administrator
may be able to give you this information). On
many major sites, less than 3 percent of visitors
are still using browser versions older than 4.0; but
your audience may be different, and you have to
decide what percentage of visitors you’re willing
to give up to gain the advantage of using layers.
If your goal is to have decent design control and
the most universally recognized Web pages,
tables are your safest option. If your goal is to
design the most advanced site possible, then
you should move on to CSS and layers, covered
in Chapters 8 and 9. If you want the best of both
worlds, design a page that uses both layers and
tables to achieve the greatest design control yet
still have a page that degrades gracefully for
older browsers.
You have one other option in Dreamweaver. You
can create your page design using layers and
then use Dreamweaver’s automated Layers to
Tables conversion option to create a second set
of pages with tables. Then you can add a behav-
ior (also covered in Chapter 9) to your site that
determines what browser version each of your
visitors is using and directs each one to the
appropriate page. This is a pretty cool trick, but
you should know that the conversion process is
not a perfect science (because you can do
things with layers that you can’t do with tables),
and you add a lot more work to your site devel-
opment and maintenance.

Part III: Advancing Your Site 

These steps show how to create a table in Layout mode with a long cell
across the top and two smaller cells below it (like the table shown in Figures
6-1 and 6-2):
1. Create a new HTML page (or open an existing page).
To create a new page, choose File➪New and then select Blank Page from
the Category list and HTML from the Basic Page list.
2. Switch to Layout mode by choosing View➪Table Mode➪Layout Mode.
The Table layout options become visible on the Layout Insert bar at the
top of the screen, as shown in Figures 6-1 and 6-2.
You can also switch to Layout mode using the Layout Insert bar, avail-
able from the Insert bar drop-down list at the top of the screen.
When you switch to Layout mode, you may see a message describing
how to use the Layout Table and Layout Cell buttons when you first
select this option. The message has some useful tips, but if you click the
Don’t Show Me This Message Again check box, you can avoid seeing it
the next time. Click OK to close it.
3. Click the Draw Layout Cell button, located on the Layout Insert bar.
The cursor changes to a crosshair when you move the mouse over the
document area, indicating that you’re ready to draw a table cell.
4. With the mouse pointer on the document, click and drag to draw a
rectangular shape anywhere on the page for your first table cell (see
Figure 6-3).
The cell is drawn, and its surrounding table structure is automatically
generated. A grid representing the table structure and other table cells
appears.
5. Draw another cell anywhere on the page by clicking the same Draw
Layout Cell button again and then clicking and dragging to create the
new cell.
Again, other cells are automatically generated to position the new cell
where you have drawn it. You can draw as many new cells as you want.
To continue drawing cells without having to go back each time and re-
select the Draw Layout Cell tool, press the Ctrl key (Ô on Mac) while
you draw cells to retain the tool.
6. Click to select any of the cells on the page and enter text, an image, or
any other element.
You can enter anything in a table cell that you can enter on a Web page.
157
Chapter 6: Coming to the HTML Table

7. Click to select the border of any cell and drag to move it to a new
location. To resize a cell, click one of the small boxes at the corners or
middle of each table side and drag to enlarge or reduce the cell.
Depending on where you started drawing table cells, Dreamweaver may
create table cells around the cells you created to maintain their posi-
tions on the page. For example, in the table shown in Figure 6-3,
although I have one new cell, Dreamweaver fills in the gaps by automati-
cally creating more cells. 
A table’s default position is the upper-left corner of a page, so in order to
maintain the position of the cell I drew, Dreamweaver had to create addi-
tional cells to the top and left of the cell. 
HTML doesn’t allow you to place things anywhere on a page unless you
use table cells (or layers) to control their placement. Empty cells that
Dreamweaver creates to fill space in a table merely act as spacer cells
and don’t display in the browser as long as the table border is set to 0. 
In this way, a table creates the illusion that page elements can be posi-
tioned independently on any part of the page.

Part III: Advancing Your Site 

Designers often wonder how wide to make a table. My best advice is to
design your pages for an 800 x 600 screen resolution because that’s the most
common size in use on the Web (believe it or not, a lot of people still have
only 15-inch monitors). If you’re creating a table that you want to cover the
entire display area, a safe bet is to make your table 740 to 760 pixels wide and
center it in the middle of the page. That leaves a little room on each side to
prevent sideways scrollbars from appearing.
Editing Tables in Layout Mode
One wonderful advantage of working with tables in Layout mode is that you
can use the layout grid to edit, move, and resize any of the rows, columns,
and cells in the table. This capability enables you to use the grid as a true
design guide for creating any kind of layout you want.
Tables are much easier to edit in Layout mode because you can click and
drag to create cells wherever you want on the page and Dreamweaver auto-
matically fills in the rest of the table needed to position the cells for you. That
means you don’t have to manually create spacer cells or do lots of merging or
splitting to get cells where you want them on a page. This feature is still not
as precise as layers, but it comes close.
You also have the flexibility to create nested tables (tables drawn within
tables) for even more control over your layout. To create a nested table,
simply click the Draw Layout Table button (available on the Layout Insert bar
at the top of the work area) and begin drawing a new table inside an existing
table cell. For more information on nested tables, see the section “Using
nested tables: Tables within tables,” later in this chapter.
159
Chapter 6: Coming to the HTML Table
Using Expanded Table mode to select sells
A third option for table editing is Expanded Table
mode. To access this view, choose View➪Table
Mode➪Expanded Tables Mode. This view makes
selecting inside and around tables easier (with-
out this option, it can be tricky to select specific
cells within a table, especially if you’re not really
adept with your mouse). If you’re in a hurry or
working on lots of cells, this view makes it a lot
easier to select and adjust table elements.

Changing Table Options 
in Standard Mode
Layout mode works best for creating and editing the overall structure of your
table. When you’re ready to start editing the contents of the table and its indi-
vidual cells, you may prefer Standard mode because the Properties inspector
provides more editing options in this mode. Using Layout mode, you can
change some table attributes, but by using Standard mode, you can change
all HTML table attributes, including the number of rows and columns as well
as height, width, border size, and spacing.
When you select a table or cell, the attributes display in the Properties inspec-
tor, at the bottom of the work area. Click the border of any table to select it,
and the Properties inspector displays the table options shown in Figure 6-4.
To view all the options, click the expander arrow in the lower-right corner of
the Properties inspector.
If you’re having trouble selecting the table (sometimes selecting the entire
table and not just an individual cell is tricky), simply place your cursor any-
where inside the table and choose Modify➪Table➪Select Table.
The Properties inspector gives you access to the following table options for
customizing the appearance of your table:
 Table Id: Provides a text area where you can enter a name or table.
 Rows: Displays the number of rows in the table. You can alter the size 
of the table by changing the number. Be careful, though: If you enter a
smaller number, Dreamweaver deletes the bottom rows — contents 
and all.
Figure 6-4:

inspector

160
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

 Columns: Displays the number of columns in the table. You can alter 
the size of the table by changing the number. Again, if you enter a
smaller number, Dreamweaver deletes the columns on the right side 
of the table — contents and all.
 W (Width): Displays the width of the table. You can alter the width by
changing the number. You can specify the width as a percentage or a
value in pixels. Values expressed as a percentage increase or decrease
the table’s size relative to the size of the user’s browser window.
 H (Height): Displays the height of the table. You can alter the height by
changing the number. You can specify the height as a percentage or a
value in pixels. Values expressed as a percentage increase or decrease
the table’s size relative to the size of the user’s browser window. This
table attribute is recognized only by version 4.0 browsers and above.
Table dimensions expressed as a percentage enable you to create a table
that changes in size as the browser window is resized. For example, if
you want a table to always take up 75 percent of the browser window, no
matter how big the user’s monitor or display area, set the size as a per-
centage. If you want a table to always be the same size — that is, to
remain the same size regardless of the browser window size — choose
pixels rather than percentages for your table dimensions.
 CellPad: Specifies the space between the contents of a cell and its
border.
 CellSpace: Specifies the space between table cells.
 Align: Controls the alignment of the table. Options are left, right, and
center.
 Border: Controls the size of the border around the table. The larger the
number, the thicker the border. If you want the border to be invisible,
set the border to 0. 
 Class: Provides easy access to style sheet options. (See Chapter 9 for
more on CSS.)
 Clear and Convert: The icons in the lower-left area of the Properties
inspector (click the expander arrow in the lower-right corner to view
them) provide these formatting options:
• Clear Row Heights and Clear Column Widths enable you to
remove all height and width values at one time.
• Convert Table Heights to Pixels and Convert Table Heights to
Percents, and Convert Table Widths to Pixels and Convert Table
Widths to Percents enable you to automatically change Height and
Width settings from percentages to pixels. Pixels specify a fixed
width; a percent setting means the browser automatically adjusts
the specified percentage of the browser display area.
161
Chapter 6: Coming to the HTML Table

 Bg Color: Controls the background color. Click the color square next to
this label to open the color palette. Click to select a color from the box
or click the color wheel at the top-right corner to choose any color. Also
note that when you click the color square, the cursor changes to an eye-
dropper, enabling you to pick up a color by clicking anywhere on the
page. You can apply this option to a single cell by placing your cursor in
a particular cell before specifying the color or to the entire table by
selecting the table. 
 Bg Image: Enables you to select a background image. Specify the file-
name or click the folder icon to locate the image. You can apply this
option to a single cell or to the entire table. Note that because many
older browsers don’t support background images in single cells, the
image may not display for all viewers.
 Brdr Color: Controls the border color of the entire table. Click the color
square next to this label and select a color from the box that appears, or
use the color wheel at the top-right corner to choose any color. Also
note that when you click the color square, the cursor changes to an eye-
dropper, enabling you to pick up a color by clicking anywhere on the
page. 
You can also apply formatting options and change the attributes of any ele-
ments, such as text, images, and multimedia files, that you have placed
within a table cell. To do so, click to select the element and then use the
options in the Properties inspector to make any desired changes, just as you
would if the element were not in a table cell.
Merging and splitting table cells
Sometimes, the easiest way to modify the number of cells in a table is to
merge cells (combine two or more cells into one) or split cells (split one cell
into two or more rows or columns). Using this technique, you can vary the
space in table sections and customize their structures. For example, you may
want a long cell space across the top of your table for a banner and then mul-
tiple cells underneath it so that you can control the spacing between columns
of text or images. The following two sets of steps show you how to merge and
split cells in a table.
You can merge and split cells only in Standard mode.
To merge cells, create a new HTML page and follow these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪Table and create a table with four rows and four
columns, a 75 percent width, and a border of 1. Skip header and
accessibility. Click OK, and the table appears on the page.
2. Highlight two or more adjacent cells by clicking and dragging the
mouse from the first cell to the last.
162
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

You can merge only cells that are adjacent to one another and in the
same row or column.
3. Click the Merge Selected Cells icon in the lower-left region of the
Properties inspector to merge the selected cells into a single cell.
The cells are merged into a single cell by using the Colspan or Rowspan
attributes. These HTML attributes make a single cell merge with adja-
cent cells by spanning extra rows or columns in the table.
To split a cell, follow these steps:
1. Click to place the cursor inside the cell you want to split.
2. Click the Split Selected Cell icon in the lower-left region of the
Properties inspector.
The Split Cell dialog box appears.
3. Select Rows or Columns in the dialog box, depending on how you
want to divide the cell.
You can split a cell into however many new rows or columns you want.
4. Type the number of rows or columns you want to create.
The selected cell is split into the number of rows or columns you entered.
Controlling cell options
In addition to changing table options, you can control options for individual
cells within a table. When you select a cell, which you do by clicking the
cursor anywhere inside the cell area, the Properties inspector changes to dis-
play the individual properties for that cell (see Figure 6-5). The Properties
inspector is where you find the controls to merge and split cells, as well as to
change the alignment of the contents of a particular cell.
163
Chapter 6: Coming to the HTML Table
Make sure the table fits the contents
Be aware that table cells automatically adjust
to accommodate whatever you insert into them.
For example, if you create a cell that is 100
pixels wide and then insert a 300-pixel-wide
image, the table cell has to adjust to fit the
image. This can cause problems if the overall
size of the table is not set large enough to
accommodate all the objects within the table
cells. As you build your tables, be aware of the
size of the images and multimedia files you are
inserting into cells or you may have unpre-
dictable results. For example, if you set a table
to a total width of 400 pixels and then insert 600
pixels worth of images, the table may not dis-
play the same in all browsers. 

You can also change multiple cells at the same time. For example, suppose
that you want to have some, but not all, the cells in your table take on a cer-
tain color background and style of text. You can apply the same properties to
multiple cells by selecting more than one cell at a time. To select adjacent
cells, press the Shift key while clicking to select cells. To select multiple cells
that are not adjacent, press the Ctrl key (the Ô key on the Mac) and click
each cell you want to select. Any properties you change in the Properties
inspector apply to all selected cells.
If you’re having trouble selecting an individual cell because it contains an
image, click the image and then use either the ←or →key on your keyboard
to move the cursor and deselect the image, which activates the Properties
inspector and displays the options for that cell.
When one or more cells are selected (they have to be adjacent for this to
work), the top half of the Properties inspector controls the formatting of text
and URLs within the table cells. The lower half of the Properties inspector
provides these table cell attribute options (refer to Figure 6-5):
 Merge Cells: Merges two or more cells. To merge cells, you must first
select two or more cells by clicking and dragging or by pressing either
the Shift or Ctrl key while selecting multiple cells.
 Split Cells: Splits one cell into two. When you select this option, a dialog
box lets you specify whether you want to split the row (you split the cell
horizontally) or the column (you split the cell vertically). You can then
specify the number of columns or rows, which controls how many times
the cell divides. Note that you can apply the Split Cell option to only one
cell at a time.

 Horz: Controls the horizontal alignment of the cell contents.
 Vert: Controls the vertical alignment of the cell contents.
 W: Controls the width of the cell.
 H: Controls the height of the cell.
 No Wrap: Prevents word wrapping within the cell. The cell widens to
accommodate all text as you type or paste it into a cell. (Normally, the
excess text just moves down to the next line and increases the height 
of the cell.)
 Header: Formats a cell’s contents by using a Header style, which makes
the text bold and centered by default.
 Bg (Image): Allows you to specify a background image for the cell.
 Bg (Color): Allows you to specify a background color for the cell.
 Brdr (Color): Allows you to change the border color of the cell.
Formatting tables with color schemes
One of the best reasons for using tables is to present lots of data in a clear
and structured way. Tables accomplish this task because the use of rows and
columns allows the reader to follow along easily when lots of data is repre-
sented. One way to make your data even more presentable and attractive is
to colorize the rows and columns in the table. In the preceding section, you
find out how to change the attributes of individual cells. This section explains
how to use the Format Table feature to select predefined table formats with
color schemes designed to enhance your presentation. Professional design-
ers created these color schemes, so you can be sure that they look good on
your Web page.
To use the Format Table feature, open an existing document or create a new
HTML page, insert a simple table of any size, and follow these steps:
1. Select an existing table in the document.
2. Make sure that you’re in Standard mode. (Choose View➪Table Mode➪
Standard Mode.)
3. Choose Commands➪Format Table.
The Format Table dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-6.
4. Select one of the schemes by scrolling the list or modify any of the
parameters to create your own scheme.
5. Click OK.
The color scheme applies to the table.
165
Chapter 6: Coming to the HTML Table

You can also modify any of the attributes in the Format Table dialog box to
create your own color schemes.
Using low-contrast color schemes in tables is considered the most effective
way to present content. (Just look at the Intuit Quicken software, E-Trade,
and Amazon for examples of real-life illustrations.) High-contrast colors in
tables are usually reserved for site menus and submenus or other elements
you want to call more attention to.
Formatting multiple columns in a table
When you’re working with lots of cells in a table, you may want to format
multiple cells in the same way. Dreamweaver makes that task easy, whether
you want to align numbers, make the headings bold, or change the color
scheme. But before you start planning how to line up all your numbers per-
fectly, be aware that you don’t have as much control in HTML as you have in
a program such as Excel, where you can align numbers to the decimal point.
You can, however, align the content of columns to the left, right, or center.
Thus, if you use the same number of digits after the decimal point in all your
numbers, you can get them to line up. For example, if one price is $12.99 and
another is $14, express it as $14.00; then, when you right-align, the numbers
line up properly. (If your columns are still not lining up the way you want
them to, consider using a monospace font, which lines up better.)

The steps in this section explain how to create a table in Standard mode and
align all the data cells to the right so that the numbers or other content align
consistently. You can also use these steps to align the contents of table cells
to the left or center and to apply other formatting options, such as bold or
italic. In these steps, I insert the data into the table after I create the table in
Dreamweaver.
If you want to import data from a table you have created in a program 
such as Word or Excel, see the section, “Importing Table Data from Other
Programs,” later in this chapter. If you’re working with a table that already
has data in it and just want to format or align the cells, go directly to Step 7.
If you’re starting from scratch, create a new, blank HTML page and follow
these steps from the beginning:
1. Make sure that you’re in Standard mode. (Choose View➪Table Mode➪
Standard Mode.)
2. Click to place the cursor where you want to create a table.
In Standard mode, tables are automatically created in the top, left area 
of the page, unless you insert them after other content. If you want a
columnar table somewhere else on the page, consider creating a table 
in Layout mode as described earlier in the chapter and then inserting 
a nested table inside a cell for your columnar data.
3. Click the Insert Table icon on the Insert bar.
Alternatively, you can choose Insert➪Table. The Insert Table dialog box
appears.
4. In the appropriate boxes, type the number of columns and rows you
want to include in your table.
Remember you can always add or remove cells later using the Properties
inspector.
5. Specify the width, border, cell padding, and cell spacing; then click OK.
The table automatically appears on the page.
6. Click to place the cursor in a cell, and then type the data you want in
that cell. Repeat for each cell.
Alternatively, you can use Edit➪Paste Special to insert columnar data
from another program, such as Excel.
7. Select the column or row for which you want to change the alignment.
Place the cursor in the first cell in the column or row you want to align;
then click and drag your mouse to highlight the other columns or rows
that you want to change.
167
Chapter 6: Coming to the HTML Table

8. Right-click (Windows) or Ctrl+click (Mac) in any cell in the highlighted
column or row.
A pop-up menu appears, as shown in Figure 6-7. Alternatively, you can
use the Properties inspector to change selected items.
9. From the pop-up menu, choose Align and then choose Left, Center,
Right, or Justify from the submenu.
This option enables you to change the alignment of all highlighted cells
in the column or row at one time. If you’re working with financial data,
choose Align➪Right, which produces the best alignment for numbers.
You can also apply other formatting options, such as bold or italic, to
selected cells and their contents by choosing the option from the pop-
up menu or the Properties inspector.
If you want to format one cell in a column or row differently from the others,
click to place the cursor in just that cell and then click one of the formatting
options in the Properties inspector. You can also choose to align multiple
cells that aren’t contiguous (they don’t touch each other) by pressing and
holding the Ctrl key in Windows while you click the cells you want to select.
On the Mac, you press and hold the Command key (Ô) while you click to
select particular cells. Any options you change on the pop-up menu or in the
Table Properties inspector apply to all selected cells.

Sorting Table Data
When you’re working with lots of columnar data, you want to be able to sort
that data, just as you do in a spreadsheet program, such as Excel. In this
newest version of Dreamweaver, you can now sort data even after it’s format-
ted in HTML (something you couldn’t easily do before). You still don’t have
as many options as you do in Excel. For example, you can’t sort different
rows individually, but you can sort an entire table based on any row you
specify.
To use the Sort Table Data feature, create a new, blank HTML page, add a
table with several rows and columns, and add some content (I explain how 
in the preceding section). You may also open an existing page with a table 
of columnar data. Then, follow these steps:
1. Select the table you want to sort.
Place the cursor in any cell of the table you want to sort.
2. Make sure that you’re in Standard mode. (Choose View➪Table Mode➪
Standard Mode.)
3. Choose Commands➪Sort Table.
The Sort Table dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-8.
Figure 6-8:

169
Chapter 6: Coming to the HTML Table

4. Specify which column you want to sort by; then, choose Alphabetically
or Numerically, and Ascending or Descending.
You can set up one or two sorts to happen simultaneously and opt
whether to include the first row and whether to keep the TR (Table Row)
attributes with a sorted row.
5. Click OK.
The selected cells are sorted, just like they are in a program such as
Microsoft Excel. (Pretty cool, huh?)
Importing Table Data from 
Other Programs
Manually converting financial data or other spreadsheet information can be
tedious. Fortunately, Dreamweaver includes a special feature that enables you
to insert table data created in other applications, such as Microsoft Word or
Excel. To use this feature, the table data must be saved from the other program
in a delimited format, which means that the columns of data are separated by
either tabs, commas, colons, semicolons, or another type of delimiter. Most
spreadsheet and database applications, as well as Microsoft Word, enable you
to save data in a delimited format, often called CSV because that’s the file
extension they’re given. Consult the documentation for the application you’re
using to find out how. After the data is saved in a delimited format, you can
import it into Dreamweaver.
To import table data into Dreamweaver after it has been saved in a delimited
format in its native application, create a new, blank HTML page and follow
these steps:
1. Choose File➪Import➪Tabular Data or choose Insert➪Table Objects➪
Import Tabular Data.
The Import Tabular Data dialog box appears (see Figure 6-9).
2. In the Import Tabular Data text box, type the name of the file you
want to import or use the Browse button to locate the file.
3. From the Delimiter drop-down list, select the delimiter format you
used when you saved your file in the other application.
The delimiter options are Tab, Comma, Semicolon, Colon, and Other. You
should have made this choice when you exported the data from the orig-
inal program in which you created it, such as Excel. If you don’t remem-
ber what you chose, you can always go back and do it again. You must
select the correct option in order for your data to import correctly.
170
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

4. Select the table width.
If you choose Fit to Data, Dreamweaver automatically creates the table
to fit the data being imported. If you choose Set, you must specify a per-
cent or pixel size.
5. Specify the cell padding and cell spacing only if you want extra space
around the data in the table to be created.
6. Choose an option from the Format Top Row option only if you want to
format the data in the top row of the table. 
Your options are bold, italic, or bold italic.
7. Specify the border size. 
The default is 1, which puts a small border around the table. Choose 0 if
you don’t want the border to be visible. Choose a larger number if you
want a thicker border.
8. Click OK to automatically create a table with the imported data.
Dreamweaver also enables you to export data from a table into a delimited
format. This capability is useful if you want to export data from a Web page
so that you can import it into another program, such as Word or Excel, or
into a database program, such as FileMaker or Access. To export data from
Dreamweaver, place the cursor anywhere in the table and choose File➪
Export➪Table. In the Export Table dialog box, choose from the options on
the Delimiter drop-down list (you can choose Tab, Space, Comma, Semicolon,
or Colon). From the Line Breaks drop-down list, specify the operating system
(you can choose Windows, Mac, or Unix).
Using Tables for Spacing and Alignment
As you get more adept at creating Web pages, you may find that HTML tables
are a crucial part of creating almost any design that requires more than basic
Figure 6-9:

weaver

such as

Chapter 6: Coming to the HTML Table

alignment of elements on a page. Using tables, you can get around many of
the limitations of basic HTML and accomplish some of these design feats:
 Evenly spaced graphical bullets (little GIF files that can take the place of
bullets) next to text
 Text boxes and fields properly aligned in a form
 Images placed wherever you want them on a page
 Columns of text that don’t span an entire page
 Myriad intricate layouts that are impossible to accomplish without using
tables or layers (for more on layers, see Chapter 9)
In the rest of this chapter, I show you how to use tables to create a variety of
page designs, including a few of the ones I just listed.
When you use a table for design control, turn off the border so that it’s not
visible in the design. You do that by typing 0 (zero) in the Border text box in
the Properties inspector with the table selected.
Using tables to design forms
Creating text boxes and drop-down lists for HTML forms is easy in Dream-
weaver, but if you want all the fields to line up well, you may want to use
tables to help with the formatting. In Chapter 12, you find step-by-step
instructions for creating a variety of forms; for now, I assume that you have
already created a form and want to align the text boxes evenly. I use a simple
form with just a few questions as an example, but you can use this technique
to align any form elements.
To use a table to align form elements, such as text boxes, evenly on your
page, follow these steps:
1. Open a page that has an HTML form on it (or create a new HTML
form).
See Chapter 13 to find out how to create HTML forms.
2. Click to place the cursor where you want to start formatting your
form.
3. Choose Insert➪Table.
The Insert Table dialog box appears.
4. Type the number of columns and rows you want in your table.
I set the table to three rows and two columns.
172
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

5. Set the width to whatever is most appropriate for your design and
click OK.
Remember, up to 760 pixels is a good width if you are designing for an
800 by 600 screen resolution, which many designers consider the best
size to reach the most users. 
6. Enter 0 for the border.
When you set the border to 0, the edges of your table change from solid
lines to dotted lines so that you can still see where the borders are while
you’re working in Dreamweaver. When you view the page in a browser,
as shown in Figure 6-10, the border of the table is invisible.
7. Click OK.
The table automatically appears on the page. 
8. You need to copy the data from your form into the table. Using the Cut
and Paste commands from the Edit menu, cut the text preceding the
form’s first text field and paste it into the cell in the upper-left corner
of the table.
Alternatively, you can select the text and then click and drag it into each
table cell.
In my example in Figure 6-11, I cut the words Who are you? and pasted
them into the first table cell.
Figure 6-10:
When the
form fields
in the table

they line up
evenly; with

173
Chapter 6: Coming to the HTML Table

9. Select the first text field (the empty box where users type their
responses) and copy and paste (or click and drag) the field into the
desired cell of the table.
10. Repeat Steps 8 and 9 until you have moved all form elements into
table cells.
11. Click the vertical column divider line between the first and second
columns and drag it to the left or right to create the alignment you
want for your form.
Aligning a navigation bar
A common element on Web pages is a navigation bar, a row of images or text
with links to the main sections of a Web site. Navigation bars are usually
placed at the top, bottom, or side of a page, where users can easily access
them but where they’re out of the way of the main content of the page.
Designers sometimes use HTML frames (see Chapter 7) to insert a navigation
bar, but most prefer using tables or layers (covered in Chapter 9).

In the last example in the preceding section, you see how to create a table in
Standard mode by using the regular table tools. In this section, you discover
how to use Layout mode to build a table, similar to the way you do at the
beginning of this chapter. You can use either mode for creating the table fea-
tured in this section, but I find Layout mode is easier to use because you can
simply drag cells into place instead of having to calculate where to merge and
split cells to create such a complex design. To use Layout mode to create a
table that positions a navigation bar across the top of a Web page, like the
one featured in Figure 6-12, follow these steps:
1. Switch to Layout mode by choosing Layout from the drop-down list on
the Insert bar and clicking the Layout icon, or choose View➪Table
Mode➪Layout Mode.
The table layout options become visible on the Layout Insert bar.
2. Select the Draw Layout Table button from the Layout Insert bar, and
create a table by clicking in the upper-left region of the display area
and dragging to fill the entire page.
3. Click the Draw Layout Cell button on the Layout Insert bar to select
the tool for drawing table cells.
Visualizing how you want your table to look is helpful before you start
drawing cells in the next step. The structure is dictated by the shape
and size of your navigation bar and other elements that need to be on
the page. (Figure 6-12 shows an example of a common design with the
navigation bar across the top of the page, just below a banner with the
site’s logo.)
4. Click and drag your mouse on the page to draw the size and shape of
each of the cells you need to contain your navigation bar and other
page elements.
Figure 6-12 shows a page that was created using multiple tables. Notice
that the table that holds the navigation elements includes a separate cell
for each graphic in the navigation row.
175
Chapter 6: Coming to the HTML Table
Vertical alignment solves common problem
If you’re having trouble getting the contents of
adjacent cells to line up with each other, setting
Vertical alignment to Top may solve your prob-
lem. A common frustration when you’re building
tables is that you have two or more rows side by
side with text in one and images in the another
and you want the top of the image and the top of
the text to line up. Often they don’t because they
are different lengths, and the table is trying to
adjust the contents to best use the space within
their respective cells. The solution is simple:
Select all the cells you want to align, and in the
Properties inspector, change Vertical alignment
to Top. Seemingly like magic, all the content
jumps right to the top of the cells and lines up
perfectly. This is such a common problem, I rou-
tinely set the Vertical alignment of table cells to
Top. 

To continue drawing cells without having to go back each time and re-
select the Draw Layout Cell tool, press the Ctrl key (Ô on Mac) to retain
the tool while you draw cells.
5. When you’re done creating all the cells you want in the table, click
the Standard Mode icon on the Layout Insert bar to return to
Standard mode.
6. Click to place the cursor in the table cell in which you want to insert 
a navigation bar image and choose Insert➪Image. Use the Browse
button to locate the image you want to insert into the table cell.
7. Double-click the filename of the image.
The image automatically appears in the table cell. Repeat this step to
insert multiple images.
As you can see in Figure 6-12, you can insert a series of images to create
a row of buttons that runs across the top of the page. Similarly, you can
create a table to hold images that run down the right or left side of a
page. You can also use text in place of images by simply entering the text
you want in each of the table cells.
8. Select the table and make sure that the Border option is set to 0 in the
Properties inspector.
This step makes your table invisible so that the border doesn’t display
in a browser.

Using nested tables: Tables within tables
Placing tables within tables, called nested tables, can help you create extremely
complex designs. You create nested tables by inserting a table within a cell of
another table. In the days when you had to write your own code, this task was
daunting. Dreamweaver now makes nesting tables easy, enabling you to create
complex designs without ever looking at the HTML code.
The best Web designs communicate the information to your audience in the
most elegant and understandable way and are easy to download. To make
sure that your designs don’t get too messy, remember these guidelines:
 A table within a table within a table is nested three levels deep. Anything
more than that gets hairy.
 Pages that use nested tables take longer to download because browsers
have to interpret each table individually before rendering the page. For
some designs, the slightly longer download time is worth it, but in most
cases you’re better off adding or merging cells in one table, as I explain
in the section “Merging and splitting table cells,” earlier in this chapter.
One situation that makes a nested table worth the added download time
is when you want to place a table of financial or other data in the midst
of a complex page design.
To place a table inside another table, follow these steps:
1. Click to place the cursor where you want to create the first table.
2. Choose Insert➪Table.
The Insert Table dialog box appears.
3. Type the number of columns and rows you need for your design.
4. Set the Width option to whatever is appropriate for your design and
click OK.
The table is automatically sized to the width you set.
5. Click to place the cursor in the cell in which you want to place the
second table.
6. Repeat Steps 2 through 4, specifying the number of columns and rows
you want and the width of the table.
The new table appears inside the cell of the first table.
7. Type the information that you want in the nested table cells as you
would enter content in any other table.

Framing Your Pages
In This Chapter
 Introducing HTML frames
 Creating frame pages
 Knowing when not to use frames
 Setting targets and links
N
o one wants to be “framed,” whether that means being falsely accused
of something you didn’t do or trapped in the HTML frameset of a Web
site with no escape. Appreciating not only the best way to create frames, but
also the best way to use them to enhance site navigation is important if you
don’t want to leave your visitors feeling stuck in your pages.
Many experienced Web designers say you should never use frames. I take a
more open approach — I don’t recommend frames, but I think you should
decide for yourself. Besides, I can think of a few instances when frames come
in quite handy, such as when you want to bring in content from another Web
site and still maintain your own navigation and logo. Of course, you should
do this only with permission from the other site (see the sidebar later in this
chapter, “Resist using frames when you link to other people’s Web sites”).
To help you make the most of this HTML design feature, this chapter not only
covers how to build HTML framesets in Dreamweaver, but also discusses
when frames are most useful and when you should avoid them. Frames add a
wide range of design possibilities, but they can also create confusing naviga-
tion systems and can be very frustrating to viewers. As you go through this
chapter, consider not only how to create frames, but also whether they are
really the best solution for your Web site project.
Appreciating HTML Frames
Frames add innovative navigation control because they enable you to display
multiple HTML pages in one browser window and control the contents of
each framed area individually. Web developers commonly use frames to

create a design with two or more sections within one browser window. Each
section consists of a different HTML page, and you can place links in one sec-
tion that, when selected, display information in another page in a different
section within the same browser window.
Web pages that use frames, such as the one shown in Figure 7-1, are split into
separate sections — or individual frames. All the frames together make up a
frameset. Behind the scenes, each frame of the frameset is a separate HTML
file, which makes a page with frames a little complicated to create, even with
Dreamweaver. If you choose to create your frame files in a text editor, you
have to juggle multiple pages, working on each frame one at a time, and you
can see what you create only when you preview your work in a browser. The
visual editor in Dreamweaver makes creating frames a lot easier because you
can view all the HTML files that make up the frameset at the same time and
can edit them while they display in the way in which they appear in a
browser.
As a navigational feature, frames enable you to keep some information 
constant, while changing other information in the same browser window. 
For example, you can keep a list of links visible in one frame and display 
the information each link brings up in another frame, as the site shown in
Figure 7-1 does.

Part III: Advancing Your Site 

You can create as many frames as you want within a browser window.
Unfortunately, some people overuse them and create designs that are so
complex and broken up that they’re neither aesthetically appealing nor easily
navigable. Putting too many frames on one page can also make a site hard to
read because the individual windows are too small. This has led many Web
surfers to passionately hate frames. And some sites that rushed to implement
frames when they were first introduced have since either abandoned frames
or minimized their use.
Here’s a list of guidelines to follow when using frames:
 Don’t use frames just for the sake of using frames. If you have a com-
pelling reason to use frames, then create an elegant and easy-to-follow
frameset. But don’t do it just because Dreamweaver makes creating
them relatively easy.
 Limit the use of frames and keep files small. Remember that each
frame you create represents another HTML file. Thus, a frameset with
three frames requires a browser to fetch and display four Web pages,
and that may dramatically increase download time.
 Turn off frame borders. Browsers that support frames also support the
capability to turn off the border that divides frames in a frameset. If you
turn the borders off, your pages look cleaner. Frame borders, shown in
Figure 7-1, are thick and an ugly gray in color, and they can break up a
nice design. You can change the color in the Properties inspector, but 
I still recommend that you only use them when you feel that they’re
absolutely necessary. I show you how to turn off frame borders in the
“Changing Frame Properties” section toward the end of this chapter.
 Don’t use frames when you can use CSS or tables instead. Tables are
easier to create than frames and provide a more elegant solution to your
design needs because they’re less intrusive to the design. I include lots
of information on creating tables in Chapter 6, and you find coverage of
CSS — an increasingly popular design option — in Chapter 8.
 Don’t place frames within frames. The windows get too darned small 
to be useful for much of anything, and the screen looks horribly compli-
cated. You can also run into problems when your framed site links to
another site that’s displayed in your frameset. The sidebar “Resist using
frames when you link to other people’s Web sites” later in this chapter
provides many more reasons to limit using frames inside of frames.
 Put in alternate <NOFRAMES> content. The number of users surfing the
Web with browsers that don’t support frames becomes smaller every
day. Still, showing them something other than a blank page is a good
idea. I usually put in a line that says, “This site uses frames and requires
a frames-capable browser to view.” <NOFRAMES> content can also be
read by search engines, which may otherwise fail to catalog the content
within framed pages.
181
Chapter 7: Framing Your Pages

Understanding How Frames Work
Frames are a bit complicated, but Dreamweaver helps make the whole process
somewhat easier. When you create a Web page with frames in Dreamweaver,
you need to remember that each frame area is a separate HTML file, and
Dreamweaver saves each frame area as a separate page. You also want to keep
track of which file displays in which of the frames so that you can aim links
properly.
Figure 7-2 shows a simple frameset example with three frames, each contain-
ing a different HTML page and different text (Page 1, Page 2, and Page 3) so
that I can clearly refer to them in the following numbered steps.
In addition to the files that display in each frame, you need to create a separate
HTML file to generate the frameset. This page doesn’t have a <BODY> tag, but 
it describes the frames and instructs the browser how and where to display
them. This gets a little complicated, but don’t worry: Dreamweaver creates the
frameset HTML file for you. I just want to give you a general understanding of
all the files that you’re creating so that the following steps make more sense.
To help you understand how this works, take a look at the example in Figure
7-2. In this document, you see three frames, each displaying a different HTML
page. The fourth HTML file that makes up the frame page contains the other
frames but doesn’t show up in the browser. This file is the frameset file, and it
describes how the frames display, whether they are on the left or the right
side of the page, the top or bottom, and how large they are. The frameset file
also contains other information, such as the name of each frame, which is
used to specify which frame a link opens into or targets. You find out more
about linking frames in the “Setting Targets and Links in Frames” section later
in this chapter.
Creating a frame in Dreamweaver
When you create a frame page in Dreamweaver, realizing that the file you are
starting with is the frameset file is important — the file doesn’t show up in 
the browser but merely instructs the browser how to display the rest of the
frames and which pages to use as content for each frame. When you edit 
the content of any of the frames in the frameset, you do not actually edit the
frameset file, but the files that populate the framed regions within the frame-
set. Normally you have to edit the files separately, but Dreamweaver makes
designing with frames easier by letting you edit the content of each frame in
the context of the frameset as it looks in a browser. If you can grasp this con-
cept, you’ve come a long way toward understanding how frames work and
how to use Dreamweaver to create and edit them. If it hasn’t sunk in yet, 
read on and it will.
182
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

Creating a frame by using the Split Frame command
You can create frames in two ways in Dreamweaver. The first way is achieved
by splitting a single HTML file into two sections, which then become individ-
ual frames. When you do that, Dreamweaver automatically generates an unti-
tled page with the <FRAMESET> tag and then additional untitled pages display
in each of the frames within the frameset. Suddenly, you’re managing several
pages, not just one. This concept is important to understand because you
have to save and name each of these pages as a separate file, even though
Dreamweaver makes you think you’re working on only one page that’s broken
into sections.
Always save your HTML files first before inserting anything into them; how-
ever, the opposite is true when you work with frame files in Dreamweaver.
Wait until after you create all the frames in your frameset and then save them
one at a time; otherwise, tracking your files gets a bit too complicated and
confusing. I explain more in the section, “Saving files in a frameset,” later in
this chapter; but first, you create a simple framed page.
To create a simple frameset in Dreamweaver, such as the one shown in 
Figure 7-2, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New.
The New Document window opens, as shown in Figure 7-3.
Figure 7-2:

2. Choose Framesets from the Category list, and then select the Fixed
Top, Nested Left option from the Framesets list.
3. Click the Create button.
The frameset automatically appears.
4. Click and drag any of the bars dividing the frames to adjust the size of
the frame area.
5. To edit each section of the frameset, click inside the frame that you
want to work on and edit it like any other HTML page.
Remember, always save your files before setting links or inserting
images and other files.
You can type text, insert images, create tables, and add any other fea-
tures just as you do to any other page.
To save your files, continue with the instructions in the section “Saving
files in a frameset,” later in this chapter.
Creating a frame by using the Frames icon on the Layout Insert bar
Another way to create frames is with the Frames icon (which has a drop-down
list), shown at the top of Figure 7-4. The Layout Insert bar (available by select-
ing Layout Bar from the drop-down list at the top of the work area) includes
the Frames icon, which displays several predefined frames sets from a drop-
down list. You can create a frameset in Dreamweaver simply by selecting any
Figure 7-3:
Dreamweav-
er includes

predefined

of these options from the Frames drop-down list. Figure 7-4 shows the Layout
Insert bar with the Frames icon selected and an option applied to a new docu-
ment from the drop-down list. 
To create a framed page using the Frames icon on the Layout Insert bar,
follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪New➪Basic Page to create a new page.
2. From the Layout Insert bar, click the Frames icon and select the
design that most closely approximates the type of frameset you want
to build from the drop-down list (refer to Figure 7-4).
Don’t worry if it isn’t exactly the design you want; you can alter it later. 
3. Modify the frameset as needed.
You can further modify your frameset by clicking and dragging the bor-
ders of the frames to resize them.
You can also split frames by choosing Modify➪Frameset and then choos-
ing to split the frame left, right, up, or down.
To save your files, continue with the instructions in the next section “Saving
files in a frameset.”

Chapter 7: Framing Your Pages

Saving files in a frameset
As I mention earlier, you shouldn’t save your frameset file until after you add
all your frames; otherwise, keeping track of your files gets very complicated.
Remember, frames in HTML consist of at least two HTML files, even if it
appears as if you are only working on one file. 
When you are ready to save, Dreamweaver gives you multiple save options
for saving all the files. You can either save everything all at once, or you can
save each frame and frameset individually. The example in the previous sec-
tion, “Creating a frame in Dreamweaver,” is composed of four separate HTML
files, and each needs to be named and saved to your hard drive. To save all
the files in the frames document you create, follow these steps:
1. Choose File➪Save All.
The Save As dialog box appears, asking you to name the file and 
designate a folder to save it in. This is the first of several Save As dialog
boxes you see (how many depends on how many frames your document
contains).
2. Enter a name for the file.
Dreamweaver suggests a name, but you can choose your own. The first
file you save represents the frameset file (the file that holds all the other
frames in place). You can tell this by looking at the Dreamweaver Docu-
ment window behind the Save As dialog box: The entire document has a
thick dotted highlight around it representing the frameset.
3. Browse your hard drive to locate the desired folder for the HTML files
and click the Save button.
The first frameset file saves, and a new Save As dialog box appears for the
next one. For each frameset file, you need a distinct name. I like names
such as frame1.html, frame2.html, or leftframe.html, rightframe.
html. It doesn’t matter too much, but such names can help you distin-
guish the frame files later. After you save all the frames, the Save As dialog
box disappears.
Carefully name the files that you save in a way that helps you keep them
in order and know which is which. Notice that as you are prompted to
save each file, Dreamweaver indicates which frame area it is by high-
lighting it with a dark border on-screen behind the dialog box. You may
find your task easier by choosing filenames that make sense and that
help you to identify which area they represent. 
After you save and name your documents the first time, choosing Save All
saves any and all the files in your frameset without prompting you separately
for each frame. Choosing Save All is a good way to make sure that all the
pages in your frameset save whenever you edit a frames-based document.
186
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

Sometimes, you may not want to save all the files at once. To save an individ-
ual frame displayed in a frameset without saving all the other frames, place
your cursor in any of the frames and choose File➪Save Frame just as you
save any other individual page. Dreamweaver saves only the file for the frame
in which your cursor is located.
To save only the page that defines the frameset, make sure the entire frame-
set is selected (you can do this by clicking in the upper-most left corner 
of the Workspace), and then choose File➪Save Frameset. If you have not
selected the entire frameset, the Save Frameset option doesn’t appear on 
the File menu. Remember: This page doesn’t display in any of the frames; 
it simply defines the entire display area, specifying which of the other pages
displays in each frame, as well as the position and size of the frames.
As you continue to work on your frame page, remember that whenever you
make a change in one of the content frames, you edit content in a different file
from the one you started with (the frameset file). You may get confused as to
which file you need to save when working in this manner. Don’t worry — this
is what confuses a lot of people about using frames in Dreamweaver. When
you edit the content in one of the frames, make sure that your cursor is still
in that frame when you choose File➪Save Frame so that you save the page
187
Chapter 7: Framing Your Pages
Resist using frames when you link 
to other people’s Web sites
I understand that most people don’t want to lose
viewers to another site when they create a link,
but that’s the nature of the Web. If your site is
designed well, you shouldn’t have to worry
about losing people. Instead, you should show
them around your informative site and then
politely help guide them to other resources they
may find of interest — and let them go. If you
link to another site and target that link within
your frames, you keep users captive and usu-
ally leave them annoyed with you for taking up
valuable browser space and making it harder to
navigate the site they’ve followed your link to
visit. By displaying content from other sites
within one or more of the frames in your site,
you risk doing yourself far more harm than good.
If you insist on using frames when you link to
another site, do so discretely by placing a small,
narrow frame across the bottom of the screen or
the left side — not a wide band across the top,
and certainly not more than one frame that still
contains information from your site. Not only is
this rude and ugly, but some people have been
sued by sites who charged that using frames
when they linked misled visitors into thinking the
content belonged to them when it didn’t. 
Another reason not to use frames when you link
to someone else’s site is that other sites use
frames, too. If you link a site that uses frames
into a site that uses frames, you quickly create
a mess of frames within frames that makes nav-
igation confusing at best. Not everyone knows
you can get out of frames by right-clicking a link
in Windows or clicking and holding a link on a
Mac and choosing Open Frame in Separate
Window. Now that you know this trick, at least
you can get out of a framed situation if you ever
find yourself trapped in one.

that corresponds to the frame you are working on. To be safe, you can always
choose File➪Save All Frames in order to save all changes to all files in the
frameset, including the frameset file itself. The Save All command is also
useful when you make changes to several of the frames and want to save all
the changes with just one command.
Setting Targets and Links in Frames
One of the best features of frames is that you can change the contents of
each frame separately within the Web browser. This feature opens a wide
range of design possibilities that improves navigation for your site. One very
common way to use a frameset is to create a frame that displays a list of links
to various pages of your site and then opens those links into another frame
on the same page. This technique makes keeping a list of links constantly vis-
ible possible and makes navigation a lot simpler and more intuitive.
Setting links from a file in one frame so that the pages they link to open in
another frame is like linking from one page to another, and that’s essentially
what you’re doing. What makes linking within a frameset distinctive is that, 
in addition to indicating which page you want to open with the link, you 
have to specify which frame section it targets (opens into).
But before you can set those links, you need to do a few things: First, you 
need to create some other pages that you can link to (if you haven’t done so
already). Creating new pages is easy. Choose File➪New ➪HTML Page to create
additional pages and then save them individually. If your pages already exist,
you’re more than halfway there; it’s just a matter of linking to those pages.
The other thing you have to do before you can set links is to name each
frame so that you can specify where the linked file loads. If you don’t, the
page just replaces the frameset altogether when someone clicks the link, 
and this defeats the purpose of using frames in the first place.
Naming frames
Naming a frame is different from naming the file that the frame represents.
You find out how to name the files in the previous section “Saving files in a
frameset;” you do that just as you name any other file you save. The frame
name is like a nickname that allows you to distinguish your frames from one
another on a page and refer to them individually — this becomes important
when you set links and want to target a link to open in a particular area of 
the frameset. The filename is the actual name of the HTML file for the frame.
The frame name is the nickname that you refer to when you want to set links.
188
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

You can see the names of your frames in the Frames panel, shown in Figure
7-5. If you’re happy with the names that Dreamweaver automatically assigned
to your frames, you can skip the following steps. If you want to change the
names of the frames in your frameset or assign your own name as you create
a new frame, follow these steps:
1. Open an existing frameset or create a new one.
See the “Creating a frame in Dreamweaver” section, earlier in this chap-
ter, if you don’t know how to create a frameset.
2. Choose Window➪Frames to open the Frames panel at the right of the
work area.
The Frames panel opens, as shown in Figure 7-5.
The Frames panel is a miniature representation of the frames on your
page that enables you to select different frames by clicking within the
panel.
3. Click to place your cursor in the area of the Frames panel that corre-
sponds to the frame that you want to name.
As displayed in Figure 7-5, you can see that I selected the top frame. You
can click to select any of the frames in the panel.

189
Chapter 7: Framing Your Pages

The Properties inspector displays the properties for that particular
frame. You can make any changes to the frame’s properties by altering
the properties in the Properties inspector after selecting the frame. You
can also select the entire frameset by clicking the border around all the
frames in the Frames panel. The Frames panel allows you to select only
one frame or frameset at a time.
4. In the Frame Name text box on the left side of the Properties inspec-
tor, type a name for the frame.
Dreamweaver assigns names automatically when you save the files in 
a frameset. In the example shown in Figure 7-5, Dreamweaver assigned
the names topFrame, mainFrame, and leftFrame. You can leave these
names as is or change them to anything else in the Properties inspector
(just don’t use spaces or special characters in the names). 
In the example, I changed the topFrame to bannerFrame. You should
name your frames in a way that makes sense to you and helps you
remember what they are so you can better target them (which you can
find info on in the “Setting links to a target frame” section that follows).
5. Choose File➪Save Frameset to save the frameset page after changing
any of the names.
The frameset is the file you don’t see in the display area that describes
the other frames and contains information such as frame names. 
Remember, you can save any individual frame by placing your cursor 
in the frame and choosing File➪Save, or you can save all the files in 
your frameset (including the frameset page) by choosing File➪Save 
All Frames. Refer to the “Saving files in a frameset” section, earlier in 
this chapter, for more information on saving frames. 
Now that you identified or changed the names of your frames, you’re ready to
start setting links that target frames. Don’t close these files yet — you want to
use them to follow the steps in the next section to set links.
I like to save my work on a regular basis so that I never lose more than a few
minutes of work if my system crashes or the power goes out. Beware, how-
ever, that when you work with frames, you need to save all your pages to
save your work. You can save each page separately by choosing File➪Save
Frame to save only the frame that the cursor is currently located in. To save
all your pages at once, simply choose File➪Save All to save all the pages in
the frameset.
Setting links to a target frame
Setting links in a frameset requires some preliminary work. If you jumped to
this section without creating a frameset or naming your frames, you may
want to refer to the sections earlier in this chapter. If you already have a
190
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

frameset, have named the frames, and just want to find out how to set links,
this section is where you want to be. 
Setting links in a frameset is like setting any other links between pages,
except that you need to specify the target frame, meaning the frame where
the linked page will display when a user clicks on the link. For example, if you
want a link in the left frame to control what’s in the main frame, you need to
specify the main frame as the target in the link. If you don’t specify a target,
the link opens in the same frame the link is in. Because the most common
reason to use frames is to keep navigation links in one frame and open their
corresponding pages in another, you probably want to target a frame when
you set a link.
If this seems confusing, don’t fret. After you try the following steps, it should
become clear how targets work in framesets:
1. Open an existing frame set or create a new frameset.
In Figure 7-6, you see that I am using the Scenes from the Southwest Web
site, which I created to use as an example in this chapter.
2. Highlight the text or click to select the image you want to serve as the
link.
In my example, I selected Sedona Sights. Note that this works the same
whether you are creating a link with text or an image.
Figure 7-6:
Use targets
to specify
where a link
opens in a
frameset.
191
Chapter 7: Framing Your Pages

3. In the Properties inspector, enter any URL in the Link text box or use
the Browse button to select the page you want to link to.
In my example, I used the Browse button to set a link to the file named
Sedona-sights.html. 
4. From the Target drop-down list in the Properties inspector, choose the
name of the frame that you want the link to open into.
In my example, I selected the mainFrame frame as the target. You should
choose the name that corresponds to the frame where you want your
linked page to open. Notice that Dreamweaver conveniently lists all the
frames you named in your document in the Target drop-down list, which
I have open in Figure 7-6.
The result, as shown in Figure 7-7, is that when the frameset displays in
a browser and a user clicks the graphic that says Sedona Sights in the
left frame, the page named sedona-sights.html displays in the main
frame area. 
You can’t test your links until you preview your work in a browser, and
you have to save your work before you preview it.

Comparing target options
You have many options when you target links in a frameset. As shown in the
preceding section, “Setting links to a target frame,” you can specify that a
linked page open in another frame within your frameset. But in addition, you
can set linked pages to open in the same frame as the page with the link, to
open a completely new page with no frames, and even to open a second
browser window and display the page without affecting the original framed
design. Table 7-1 provides a list of target options and what they mean. You
can find all these options in the Target drop-down list of the Properties
inspector.
The Target drop-down list in the Properties inspector is activated only when
you select a linked image or section of text. There must be a link in the Link
field of the Properties inspector before you can set a target.
Table 7-1
Understanding Frame Target Options
Target Name
Action
_blank
Opens the linked document into a fresh new browser
window.
_parent
Opens the linked document into the parent frameset of the
page that has the link. (The parent is the frameset or
frame that contains the frame with the link.)
_self
Opens the linked document in the same frame as the origi-
nal link, replacing the current content of the frame. This is
the default option and usually does not need to be specified.
_top
Opens the linked document into the outermost frameset,
replacing the entire contents of the browser window.
Changing Frame Properties
As you get more sophisticated in using frames, you may want to further
refine your frames by changing properties, which enables you to turn off
frame borders, change the frame or border colors, limit scrolling, and so on.
To access these options in Dreamweaver, choose Window➪Frames, click
inside the Frames panel in the area that corresponds to the frame that you
want to change, and then use the Properties inspector to access the options 
I describe in the following four sections. Figure 7-8 shows the Properties
inspector as it appears when you select a frameset in the Frames panel.
193
Chapter 7: Framing Your Pages

If you don’t see the margin height and width options, make sure that you
click the expander arrow in the bottom-right corner of the Properties inspec-
tor. Clicking this arrow causes all available properties to display for the
selected item.
Changing frame borders
I think the best thing that you can do with a frame border is to turn it off. 
You can turn the borders off for your site by choosing No from the Borders
drop-down list in the Properties inspector for either the frameset or any of
the individual frames in the frameset. Your other options include Yes, which
forces the borders to be visible, and Default, which usually means Yes. In
case of individual frames, however, the Default option inherits the settings 
for the parent frameset.
You can make global border settings by using the Properties inspector and
applying the settings to the frameset. To select the frameset so that its prop-
erties are visible in the inspector, click the border that encloses the frameset
in the Frames panel. Figure 7-8 shows a frameset selected in the Frames panel
and its corresponding properties displayed in the Properties inspector.
Figure 7-8:

Part III: Advancing Your Site 

If you choose to keep your borders visible, you may want to customize the
color by clicking the Border Color square in the Properties inspector and
then choosing a color from the color palette.
If you select a specific border, the Properties inspector also enables you to
specify the border width. Simply enter a value in pixels in the Border Width
text field to change the width of the selected border.
Frame border colors are not well supported by all browsers and may not dis-
play as you intend. Most designers simply turn off frame borders, but if you
do keep them make sure that your design still looks okay if the borders are
thick and grey, which is the default. Many browsers, including recent ones,
don’t display a different border color.
Changing frame sizes
The easiest way to change the size of a frame is to select the border and drag
it until the frame is the size that you want. When you select the border, the
Properties inspector displays the size of the frame, enabling you to change
the size in pixels or as a percentage of the display area by entering a number
in the Row or Column text boxes. If you specify 0 width for your frame bor-
ders, you may not see them on the page in order to drag and resize them. If
this is the case, you can view the borders by choosing View➪Visual Aids➪
Frame Borders, and Dreamweaver indicates the borders with a thin gray line
that you can easily select.
Changing scrolling and resizing options
Scrolling options control whether a viewer can scroll up and down or left and
right in a frame area. As shown in Figure 7-9, the scrolling options for frames
are Yes, No, Auto, and Default. As a general rule, I recommend leaving the
Scroll option set to Auto because a visitor’s browser can then turn scrolling
on if necessary. That is, if the viewer’s display area is too small to see all the
contents of the frame, the frame becomes scrollable. If all the contents fit
within the visible boundaries, the scroll arrows don’t display.
If you set this option to Yes, the scroll arrows are visible whether they’re
needed or not. If you set it to No, they won’t be visible, even if that means
your viewer can’t see all the contents of the frame — a sometimes dangerous
proposition because there’s no easy way to scroll. Default leaves it up to the
browser. In most browsers, the Default option results in the same display as
the Auto option, but Default yields unpredictable results. As a general rule,
using Auto is best so the scroll bar is visible only if needed.
195
Chapter 7: Framing Your Pages

Also notice the No Resize option in Figure 7-9. If you place a check mark in
this box, a visitor to your site can’t change the size of the frames. If you leave
this box unchecked, your user can select the border and drag it to make the
frame area smaller or larger, just as you can when you develop your frames in
Dreamweaver. Generally, I like to give viewers control, but I often check the
No Resize option because I want to ensure that my viewers don’t alter the
design, especially because some viewers may do so accidentally.
Setting margin height and width
The Margin Width and Margin Height options enable you to specify the amount
of margin space around a frame. Normally in a browser window, a small margin
is visible between the edge of the window and any content, such as images or
text. That’s why you can’t normally place an image on your page flush against
the edge of the browser. With frames, though, you can actually control the size
of the margin or even eliminate the margin altogether. 
I generally recommend that you set the margin to at least two pixels and
make the margin larger if you want to create more space around your con-
tent. If you want to get rid of the margin altogether, set it to zero and any
images or text in the frame appears flush against the edge of the frame or
browser window if the frame touches the edge of the browser. If the frame
touches another frame, you can use this technique to create the impression
of seamless images across frames.

Cascading Style Sheets
In This Chapter
 Appreciating Cascading Style Sheets
 Implementing CSS in Dreamweaver
 Handling external style sheets
 Making use of CSS in templates
T
he biggest boon for Web designers in recent years is the advent of
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a way to extend HTML and give yourself
greater style control over every part of your page. CSS is especially useful for
formatting the look of frequently used elements, like headlines and subheads,
that you use again and again in your pages. For example, if you want all main
headlines to be Arial, bold, and centered, you can create a single style with
those options and apply only that style rather than all three individual HTML
tags. You can then create style sheets that work simultaneously across multi-
ple pages or your entire site.
Cascading Style Sheets also enable you to lay out your pages — and they’re
much more powerful than using tables to position elements. CSS is rapidly
becoming the preferred method of designing pages. Forward-thinking design-
ers find the power of CSS more than pays back the learning curve required to
get started.
If you haven’t jumped on the CSS bandwagon yet, this chapter is designed 
to help you appreciate the benefits and introduce you to these timesaving
features so that you can begin using CSS in your page designs right away.
Macromedia believes strongly in CSS and has added new features to Dream-
weaver 8 that make accessing and understanding style sheets easier.
In this chapter, you see how Cascading Style Sheets work and how they’re
implemented in Dreamweaver. You’re also introduced to the most advanced
CSS capabilities, and you gain a glimpse into the future of Web design. In
Chapter 9, you find more detailed instructions about using CSS and layers 
to control page layout.

Checking Browser Compatibility
Although CSS has been around for a while, many designers have resisted
using it because early browsers (such as Netscape and Internet Explorer 4.0)
poorly implemented it. That’s all changing now that most of the users of the
Internet have upgraded to more advanced browsers and these modern
browsers are doing an increasingly good job of rendering CSS pages. The
newest versions of Firefox, Netscape, Internet Explorer, Safari, and Opera all
offer very good (though. at times. inconsistent and incomplete) support for
CSS. To help you watch out for inconsistencies, Dreamweaver offers several
features designed to help manage browser differences (the end of Chapter 9
covers these features).
Unless you need to reach the widest possible audience and expect that some
viewers may be using ancient browsers, such as Netscape 4 and earlier, you
shouldn’t have to worry much about browsers that can’t render CSS. Even in
cases where you do need to reach those archaic holdouts, CSS is designed to
degrade gracefully: You may lose your fancy formatting, but at least viewers
can still see your content. (The exception is layers, as described in Chapter 9,
which older browsers don’t always display.)
You do need to worry about browsers that interpret and understand CSS 
differently. For example, you find significant differences between how the
increasingly popular Mozilla Firefox browser and Microsoft Internet Explorer
implement CSS. Be sure to include enough time for testing in all the browsers
you expect your visitors to use so that you can clear up any problems before
publishing your pages on your site.
Appreciating Cascading Style Sheets
The concept of style sheets has been around long before the Web. Word pro-
cessing programs, such as Microsoft Word, have long used style sheets to
control text formatting. Using style sheets in a word processor, for example,
you could create specific style definitions — such as Heading, Body, and
Footer — and apply those styles to sections of text. The timesaving benefits
of this approach are enormous because you need to define complex styles
only once and then can apply them with a single click anywhere in your docu-
ment. The concept is exactly the same with Web documents and Cascading
Style Sheets.
The most powerful aspect of CSS, as you see in the section “Using External
Style Sheets,” is its capability to make global style changes across an entire
Web site. Suppose that one fine day you decide that all your headlines should
be purple rather than blue. If you weren’t using CSS, changing all your head-
lines would be a huge undertaking — a matter of opening every Web page in
your site and making changes to the font tags around your headlines. With
198
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

CSS, you can simply open the style sheet and make changes to the style that
controls all the headlines. Save the style sheet, and voila! Your headlines are
now all automatically purple. If you ever have to redesign your site (and
believe me, every good site goes through periodic redesigns), you can save
hours or even days of work if you have created your design with CSS.
Benefits of CSS
CSS is a continually developing technology with a remarkably broad scope,
and not all its capabilities are included in Dreamweaver 8. Nonetheless, you
gain many, many advantages by using CSS in Dreamweaver. The following 
partial list shows some of what you can do:
 Designate specific fonts.
 Define font sizes based on percentages, pixels, picas, points, inches, mil-
limeters, and other precise measurements.
 Set bold, italic, and underline properties.
 Set text color and background color for text blocks and other objects.
 Change link colors and remove link underlining.
 Create mouseover effects on links.
 Indent and justify text.
 Transform text into upper-, lower-, and mixed-case.
 Create customized bullets.
 Control margins and borders around text.
 Redefine how existing HTML tags display.
 Precisely position elements on a page.
 Add borders to blocks of text and images.
 Flow text around images and other text.
199
Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets
Are style sheets making you crazy?
If you choose to format text or other elements on
your pages without using style sheets, you may
be frustrated with some of Dreamweaver’s auto-
mated style sheet features, which try to create
style sheets for you and can alter styles when
you apply formatting manually. Don’t fret, you can
turn off these automated CSS features in
Dreamweaver by choosing Edit➪Preferences,
and then unchecking the Use CSS instead of
HTML Tags option in the General panel.

Looking at the code behind CSS
A Cascading Style Sheet is basically a list of rules defining the behavior of an
HTML document. HTML already contains a bunch of rules about the behavior
of different tags, but without CSS, you can’t alter those rules — they’re kind
of like the grammar rules in a language.
CSS, however, enables you to create your own rules and override the rules 
of HTML, which are quite limited in terms of page design. These new rules
determine how a browser displays certain page elements. Imagine if you
could invent a bunch of new words and grammar rules for the English lan-
guage. Now imagine that everyone else could do that too. Communication
could get confusing pretty quickly, right?
What keeps the communication from breaking down with CSS is that every
time you invent new rules, you include the equivalent of a dictionary entry
and grammar guide that goes along with each document. This is the style
sheet.
CSS styles reside in the <HEAD> area of an HTML page if they apply to only
that page, or in a separate file if you create an external CSS that applies to
multiple pages. A style sheet consists of lines of code that are grouped into
rules. A style sheet can contain any number of rules, and each rule contains 
a selector and a declaration block composed of one or more properties and 
a corresponding value. If this stuff is starting to sound a little confusing, 
don’t worry. You find step-by-step directions later in this chapter, and Dream-
weaver hides most of the technical stuff behind the scenes (unless you like to
look at the code).
To give you an idea of what CSS looks like, Figure 8-1 illustrates the various
components of a style sheet.
200
Part III: Advancing Your Site 
Using CSS with templates
Templates, as described in Chapter 4, are ideally
suited for use with CSS because they’re geared
toward a collaborative work environment. With
Dreamweaver, you can use both internal and
external styles sheets in a template. In fact, using
external style sheets makes a great deal of sense
when using templates because the formatting of
the page is separated from its content. To save a
page with CSS info as a template, just choose
File➪Save As Template. Any template you create
that contains internal styles or links to external
styles automatically updates whenever its style
sheet changes.
With templates, both the link code at the head
of the page and any internal styles are locked
regions by default. Users are prevented from
editing the style sheet definitions, but they have
an ideal way to manage the look and feel of a
site via formatting specifications that cannot be
modified from a document that uses a template.

After looking over Figure 8-1, you may be thinking that CSS looks kind of 
complicated. Well, to be perfectly honest, it is. In fact, I want you to know
that you can’t read only this chapter on CSS and become proficient enough 
to write your own CSS code. Even experienced Web designers face a steep
learning curve in becoming proficient with CSS. What I can tell you in this
chapter is how Dreamweaver handles CSS so that you can implement it
quickly and easily. 
This chapter gives you the introduction you need to use style sheets effec-
tively, but if you really want to learn all the details of style sheets, I suggest
that you explore some other, more complete resources on CSS, such as CSS
Web Design For Dummies, by Richard Mansfield (published by Wiley
Publishing, Inc.).
If you happen to know some CSS already, and you’re advanced enough to be
able to hand-code CSS, Dreamweaver includes a cool feature named Code
Hints. Code Hints offer autocomplete options for filling in code that speed up
the manual coding process. Code Hints work only in Code view and activate
as you type new CSS declarations. You can also force the list of Code Hints to
appear by pressing Ctrl+spacebar (or Ô+spacebar on the Mac).

Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

“So what’s all this about cascading?”
The term cascading refers to the way in which conflicts in CSS rules are
resolved. Because styles can be attached to documents in multiple ways, and
the properties can be invoked in multiple ways, the browser must interpret
these style rules in a certain order. This hierarchical order works in kind of a
top-down fashion, in much the same way water cascades over rocks as it
flows down a stream.
The benefits of this cascading process become apparent when you define
multiple style choices in your style sheet. Cascading Style Sheets enable 
you to define a variety of presentation possibilities that are rendered in the
browser. CSS is set up this way to help compensate for the many variables
that affect how pages display on the Web, such as differences among com-
puter platforms, screen resolutions, and browser versions. When you define
the design of your page by creating CSS rules, items first in the list receive
lower priority. As the browser cascades down the list, the later rules receive
greater priority, so that a style rule very close to a page element usually takes
precedence over a rule in an external style sheet. This concept becomes
clearer as you become more familiar with how CSS operates. (You find out
what happens when you apply conflicting styles in the section “Conflicting
styles,” later in this chapter.)
Advanced capabilities of CSS
When designers are introduced to CSS, they often get excited about the 
capability to control and format text in ways that were never possible with
straight HTML. But the CSS fun doesn’t stop there! Besides helping you to
format your text, CSS also encompasses a host of other geeky techniques 
that enable you to control the layout and appearance of page elements. CSS
forms the basis of layers (which you can read more about in Chapter 9), 
even though you wouldn’t know it without looking closely at the code on
your page. Layers are an advanced CSS implementation that enable you to
precisely position objects on your page, stack them one on top of the other,
and even add interactivity to elements. Interactive effects with layers can 
be programmed by using DHTML (Dynamic HTML) and JavaScript to create
complex animations and transitions on your pages.
Chapter 9 covers Cascading Style Sheets and Dynamic HTML in greater detail.
Dynamic HTML is made possible through scripting languages that use the
Document Object Model to create dynamic effects and global styles. Think of
Cascading Style Sheets as HTML on steroids. Think of Dynamic HTML as
HTML on rocket fuel.

Working with the CSS Panel
The CSS panel has two panes when in the All mode: All Rules and Properties.
The All Rules pane shows all the styles defined for the page you have open,
whether the styles are internal or contained in an external style sheet. If you
select one of the page’s styles, its properties are shown in the Properties
pane, where you can easily add, edit, and remove existing styles (see 
Figure 8-2). 
When you first open this panel, you need to click the plus sign (+) (or triangle
on the Mac) that is next to the <STYLE> tag in the CSS panel to see the styles
associated with the page. (If you don’t see a style tag or any styles, no styles
are associated with the page.)
Click the Current button to show the Current mode. Use the Current mode to
see only the style of an item currently selected in your open document. This
mode has three panes: Summary for Selection, Rules, and Properties (see
Figure 8-3). In the Summary for Selection pane, you see the rules currently
defined for this style. In the Rules pane, you see all the rules that influence
the currently selected element; this pane is exceptionally useful when you
have created a complicated layout. In the third pane, you can edit, add, or
delete properties of the current rule.

Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

On the left-hand side of the panel, you see the Show Category View, Show List
View, and Show Only Set Properties icons. These apply to the Properties
panel in both the Current and All modes. Here’s how to use these:
 Show Category View: In the category view of the Properties view,
Dreamweaver displays all the properties available to use for a rule, 
organized by the category to which they belong. For example, all 
the font properties are grouped into a Font category.
 Show List View: In the list view, Dreamweaver displays all the properties
available to use for a rule, organized alphabetically.
 Show Only Set Properties: When you define a new rule, you set certain
properties, but of course you can set many more. In this view,
Dreamweaver displays only those properties you defined for this rule.
The second set of icons, on the bottom-right of the CSS panel, includes icons
that are useful no matter what mode the panel is in. From left to right, these
icons represent Attach Style Sheet, New CSS Rule, Edit Style Sheet, and Delete
CSS Rule (this one resembles a trash can). The easiest way to start a new
style sheet is to create a new style. Click the second icon on the bottom left
(New CSS Rule) of the CSS panel.

When you click the New CSS Rule icon, the New CSS Rule dialog box opens, as
shown in Figure 8-4, and displays the following options:
 Name: Although the first field in this box is Name, when you first bring it
up, its title changes, depending on which CSS type you select by using
the three radio buttons in the Selector Type area. Read the description
for each of the CSS types in the following bullets to see how to fill out
the Name field.
 Selector Type: These three radio button options allow you to define the
type of style you want to create:
• Class enables you to define a new style that you can apply to any
section on a page by using the Class attribute. When you select
this option, you must also fill in the name of the class in the Name
field above it. All custom style names must begin with a period (.),
which Dreamweaver automatically inserts as you name the style.
• Tag enables you to create a style that adds to or changes the for-
matting associated with an existing HTML tag. When you select this
option, the Name field asks for a tag name. Clicking the Tag drop-
down list allows you to select from a huge list of HTML tags (the
default one is the <BODY> tag). For more information on this option,
see the section, “Redefining HTML tags,” later in this chapter.
• Advanced enables you to define other types of styles, which usu-
ally consist of a kind of hybrid that combines a custom style with 
a specific HTML tag. The most common of these are the a: styles,
which apply only to the <A> tag and enable you to do tasks such 
as change the color of a link when the mouse hovers over it. When
you select this option, the Selector field asks for the selector name.
Choices in the pop-up list are a:active, a:hover, a:link, and a:visited.
 Define In: This option lets you choose whether your style sheet exists
within the current document or in a separate file. When you select a new
style sheet file, you’re creating an external style sheet. If you select This
Document Only, you’re creating an internal style sheet, in which defined
styles are available only for the page you’re working on.
Figure 8-4:

dialog box.
205
Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

After you click OK in the New CSS Rule dialog box, another dialog box appears
in which you define the different rules for the style. I explain the CSS Rule
Definition dialog box in the “Defining CSS Rules” section, later in this chapter.
Creating Style Sheets in Dreamweaver
When you start creating and using Cascading Style Sheets, you use one of the
most complex and advanced Dreamweaver features. Consequently, creating
style sheets takes a little more time to grasp than does applying basic HTML
tags and modifying their attributes. Still, Dreamweaver makes defining style
sheets much easier than writing them by hand — a task much closer to writ-
ing programming code than to creating HTML tags.
To help you get the hang of using Dreamweaver to create style sheets, you
find detailed descriptions of all the panels and dialog boxes that define CSS
rules throughout this chapter. If you want to understand every option or
have a particular question about an option as you create your style sheets,
refer to the “Working with the CSS Panel” section.
Choosing the right style
You can create two types of style sheets with CSS and Dreamweaver: internal
and external. An internal style sheet stores its rules within the HTML code of a
page and applies only to that page. An external style is a text file you create
and store outside your HTML page. You can then reference it as a link within
as many HTML documents as you like. In this way, you can apply style sheets
to an entire Web site or to any page that links to the external style sheet,
which also means that you can have many different pages referencing the
same style sheet. You create these two kinds of style sheets in almost the
same way, as you see later in this chapter.
You can also define three different kinds of CSS styles to use in either an
internal or external style sheet: 
 Classes: A class is a completely new set of formatting attributes you can
apply to any text selection. Don’t worry much about the technical terms
because I get into them in more detail as you read on. For now, just know
that when you define a class, you give it a name, and then you use that
name to apply the style to any element on the page. By creating a class
you make up your own HTML tag with formatting rules you can define
yourself.
206
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

 Tags: You can change how existing HTML tags are rendered by the
browser; in this case, you’re overriding the existing rules or adding addi-
tional formatting to an existing rule. For example, you could redefine the
H2 heading tag by specifying that the tag also applies the font face Arial
and the color blue. When you alter an existing tag, you change the way
all instances of that HTML tag manifest throughout your page — or
throughout your Web site.
 Advanced: This third kind of style relates to specific, preexisting attrib-
utes of tags that can be modified with CSS. In Dreamweaver, you can use
these advanced styles to change attributes of the <A> tag and to alter
the appearance of sets of links on your page, depending on what is going
on around them. This is especially useful when you have links displayed
on different background colors making the default link colors inappro-
priate. A CSS selector of this kind is also referred to as a pseudoclass
because it’s a combination of the two preceding styles.
Creating a new style
In this section, you jump right into steps for creating and applying styles in
Dreamweaver. In this section, you define a style for headlines using CSS. If
you want to create a style for another element, follow these same steps and
change the specific attributes as needed.
You can leave attributes unspecified if you don’t want to use them. If you
don’t specify them, the browser uses its own default. For example, if you
don’t specify a font, the browser uses the default page font specified by 
the user in the browser preferences.
To define a new style, create a new document or open an existing HTML file,
and follow these steps:
1. Choose Text➪CSS Styles➪New.
The New CSS Rule dialog box appears. The new style is automatically
named .unnamed1.
2. In the Name text box, type a new name for the style.
Dreamweaver gives you a default name that begins with a period (.)
because class names must always begin with a period. You can name the
style anything you want as long as you don’t use spaces or punctuation.
Dreamweaver adds the initial period to the class name if you omit it.
Because you’re creating a headline style, I suggest you name this new
style .headline.
207
Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

This structure can be a little confusing because when you apply the
style to an element on your page, the period (.) is not visible; it’s only
needed when you create the style.
3. In the Selector Type category, make sure that the button next to Class
is selected.
4. In the Define In area, select This Document Only to create an internal
style sheet.
An internal style sheet affects only the current page, not a group of
HTML pages — you can find more details on this later in this chapter.
5. Click OK.
The CSS Rule Definition dialog box opens.
6. For the Font choice, select a font set from the drop-down list or enter
the name of a font in the Font field.
To use fonts that aren’t in the drop-down list, choose the Edit Font List
option from the drop-down list to create new font options.
You generally should use a font set that specifies three or more fonts
rather than just specify a single font in the font choices. A browser can
only display a font if the font is installed on the user’s computer. If a user
doesn’t have the font, the browser searches for the next font in the list
you specified. If you only specify one font and the user doesn’t have it,
the browser’s default font is used to display the text. By specifying multi-
ple fonts, you have a better chance that your text displays close to the
way you intend.
7. From the Size drop-down list, choose the size you want for your 
headline.
Large headlines commonly appear at 24 or 36 points. Notice that you can
also specify sizes in pixels, picas, mm, and several other measurements.
Using precise CSS measurement units, such as pixels and points, for text
is much more consistent across computer platforms than using HTML
sizes, such as 1, 2, and 3. Still, because of the different screen resolu-
tions between Macs and PCs, you don’t achieve perfect size consistency
between the two platforms, although you get much closer than by using
HTML size formatting. Always check your designs on multiple platforms
and multiple browsers if exact text formatting and appearance are criti-
cal. (See Chapter 9 for more on the Dreamweaver features for checking
browser compatibility.)
8. From the Style drop-down list, choose a font style.
Each of these settings is optional. You can leave any or all the fields
blank.
9. From the Weight drop-down list, choose Bold to make your headline
thicker and darker.
208
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

10. Ignore Variant and Case because these attributes aren’t well sup-
ported by current browsers.
11. Click the color well and choose a color for the headline.
Sticking to the default color swatches in the color well is certainly the
quickest way to choose a color, but you can also create custom colors
by clicking the icon that looks like a rainbow-colored globe in the upper-
right corner of the color well and selecting a color from the System
Color Picker.
12. Click OK when you finish.
Notice in Figure 8-5 that your new headline style is added to the list of
styles in the CSS panel. If the style doesn’t appear, click the plus sign (+)
(or triangle on the Mac) next to the <STYLE> tag to reveal the rules in
the current style.
After you create a style sheet and add rules to it, you can apply the styles to
any Web page or selected text block using several different methods. See the
next section for details.
Although the most common use of style sheets is text formatting, you can
create styles for any element on a page. For example, you could create a style
for images that controls alignment and other attributes.

Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

Applying styles in Dreamweaver
Defining custom styles in Dreamweaver is the time-consuming part. Applying
them after you defined them is the timesaving part. Applying them is easy:
You simply select the text, or other element, you want to affect and choose
the predefined style you want to apply to it.
To apply a style in Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
1. Highlight the text, or other element, in an open document to which
you want to apply a style.
2. In the Properties inspector, click the Style pop-up menu to reveal the
list of styles associated with the document and select the one you
want.
Notice that Dreamweaver allows you to preview the style when you select
it with this method, as shown in Figure 8-6. After you choose a style, the
selected text changes in the Document window (see Figure 8-7).
Figure 8-6:
Selecting 
a style 
with the
Properties
inspector.
210
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

Another way to apply a style to a highlighted text selection is by choosing the
name of the style from the menu you see when you choose Text➪CSS Styles
or right-click (Control+click on the Mac) the selected text and then choose
the style from the resulting pop-up menu. The method you choose depends
on your own personal preferences. I like to use the Properties inspector
because it’s the only method that allows you to preview the way the style
appears before applying it.
When you apply a style at the code level, Dreamweaver generally adds a class
attribute to the tag surrounding the text to which you apply the style. This
class attribute is tied to the style you defined and causes the selected text to
take on the properties of the style. For example, if you have a section of text
that looks like this in Code view before attaching a style:
<P>This is my headline</p>
Dreamweaver adds a class attribute to the <P> tag, which associates it to the
.headline class. The resulting code looks like this:
<P class=”headline”>This is my headline</P>
Figure 8-7:
After
applying the
.headline
style to 
the page.
211
Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

In cases where no preexisting tags enclose the text, Dreamweaver adds the
<SPAN> tag, which acts as a container for the style. A selection of text that
starts out like this in Code view:
This is my headline
ends up like this after applying the style:
<SPAN class=”headline”>This is my headline</SPAN>
Removing styles in Dreamweaver
To remove a style from a selected text block, choose the None option from
the Style drop-down list in the Properties inspector (as shown in Figure 8-8)
or choose Text➪CSS Styles. It’s really that simple.

Redefining HTML tags
When you create a custom style, as I explain in the preceding section, you
start a completely new style with its own, unique name, containing various
rules that you define by using the CSS Rule Definitions options covered in the
“Creating a new style” section, earlier in this chapter. When you redefine an
HTML tag, however, you begin with an existing HTML tag — such as <B>
(bold), <PRE> (for unformatted text), or <TABLE> (table) — and change the
attributes associated with this specific tag. In this case, you don’t need to
apply the style because the style applies at the time you use the HTML tag,
affecting all content that falls inside the tag. This distinction between creat-
ing a new class and redefining an existing tag is an important one.
You may ask “Why would I need such a feature?” or “What’s the best scenario
in which to use it?” In the preceding section, you find out how to create a new
style class that you can selectively apply to any block of text on your page. In
the case of redefined HTML tags, the new attributes apply to all instances of
that tag. This feature can be quite powerful if used correctly, but it does
require a little knowledge about HTML tags and how they work.
For example, every HTML page has a <BODY> tag. If you know that you want
all the text on your page to appear in a specific font, you can redefine the
<BODY> tag to inherit a specific font, and that saves you the time of having to
apply a class to all body text. Because of the cascading nature of style sheets,
you can still apply class styles to individual selections of text falling within
the <BODY> tag that can further modify or even override the attributes ini-
tially defined for this tag.
To redefine an HTML tag, follow these steps:
1. Create a new CSS rule.
You have several ways to call up the New Rule Style dialog box. Try
clicking the New CSS Rule button in the lower-right portion of the CSS
panel to call it up.
2. In the Selector Type category in the New CSS Rule dialog box, select
the Tag option.
Notice that when you select the Tag option, the name of the Name text
box at the top changes to Tag.
3. Click the Tag pop-up menu to reveal a comprehensive list of HTML
tags and choose the tag you want from this list (see Figure 8-9).
If you’re unsure of the meaning of any of these HTML tags, consult the
Reference panel, available by choosing Window➪Reference.
4. Select the This Document Only option in the Define In field to create
an internal style sheet. 
213
Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

5. Click the OK button, and then use the CSS style definition categories
to define the new tag style.
Be aware that when you redefine an existing HTML tag, any text you have
already formatted with that tag changes to reflect the new definition.
A good use of the Redefine HTML tag feature is to create style definitions for
HTML header tags, such as H1, H2, and H3. This way, you can exercise greater
control over the appearance of these headers and easily apply them by
choosing Text➪Paragraph Format. Using header tags also has an added bene-
fit because search engines often give higher priority to keywords that appear
in the H1 to H6 header tags.
Working with CSS selectors
The third type of style is the CSS selector. Dreamweaver refers to it as an
advanced selector. CSS selectors allows you to affect various predefined
attributes of a given HTML element or affect elements according to how they
are placed in a document or positioned relative to other elements. The most
common use of this type of style according to Dreamweaver is in conjunction
with the <A> anchor tag: You can use it to change the appearance of links on
your page. In HTML, the <BODY> tag already has certain attributes associated
Figure 8-9:
The
Redefine
HTML Tag
option gives
you a list of
all HTML
tags you
can redefine
using CSS.
214
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

with it — such as link, visited, active, and hover — that affect the appearance
of all hypertext links in the document. Using a CSS selector style allows you
to access these attributes and change their qualities. For example, you can
remove underlines from links and create mouseover effects using styles, as
you can see in the next two sections.
Eliminating underlines from links
One of the most commonly used CSS techniques involves disabling the under-
line attribute of the anchor tag, <A>, so that hypertext links are no longer
underlined in the browser. Many Web designers like to remove the underline
because they think that it detracts from the design, and they consider under-
lined links old-fashioned. Instead, they use other, more modern ways of dis-
playing links using CSS selector styles. This technique works in almost all
modern Web browsers, including Netscape 4.0 and higher.
To disable underlining for hypertext links, follow these steps:
1. Choose Text➪CSS Styles➪New (or click the New CSS Rule button in
the CSS panel).
The New CSS Rule dialog box appears.
2. Select the Advanced option in the Selector Type area.
3. Choose a:link from the Selector pop-up menu.
4. In the Define In area, select This Document Only.
5. Click OK.
The CSS Rule Definition dialog box opens.
6. Make sure that the Type category is selected; then, check the None
option in the Decoration area, as shown in Figure 8-10.
7. Click OK to apply the changes.
After you click OK, active links are no longer underlined on the page when
they display in a browser (as long as it’s 4.0 or higher). Try creating a link on
the page in Design mode, and you see that the link is no longer underlined.
The link takes on the default blue color for hyperlinks, however, so that you
know that it’s still a link. If you want to change the blue color, you can use the
CSS style definitions to change the color for the a:link selector.
Adding a little interactivity
To make your links interactive, you can further modify the <A> tag by adding
an effect that underlines the link only when a viewer hovers the mouse over
it. That way, your viewer instantly receives feedback that the link is indeed a
hyperlink.
215
Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

To display an underline when users mouseover a link:
1. Choose Text➪CSS Styles➪New (or click the New CSS Rule button in
the CSS panel).
The New CSS Rule dialog box appears.
2. Select the Advanced option in the Selector Type area.
3. Choose a:hover from the Selector pop-up menu.
4. In the Define In area, select This Document Only.
5. Click OK.
The CSS Rule Definition dialog box opens.
6. Make sure that the Type category is selected and check the Underline
option in the Decoration section.
7. Click OK to apply the changes and then save your document.
To preview the effects of the style changes you just made, you need to view
the page in a Web browser because some interactive effects don’t show up in

Part III: Advancing Your Site 

Dreamweaver Design view. Take a look at how your links now appear and
how they interact with the user. This cool effect is much simpler to create
than a rollover behavior. Try experimenting with different style sheet rules
on the different anchor selectors to achieve exciting results. 
For example, you can also cause the link, when it’s moused over, to become
bold rather than underlined or to change color. You can also apply any other
CSS effect you can think of to enhance the appearance of your links. You can
modify a:visited links to change the attributes of visited links and a:active
links to change the attributes of links while they’re being clicked. Remember
that any styles you create in this way affect all links on your page unless you
specifically apply a different class style to the individual link that overrides
the selector style.
Dreamweaver features a quick way to alter the appearance of links in the
Page Properties dialog box (see Figure 8-11). When you use this option,
Dreamweaver automatically generates the CSS code to alter your link display.
You don’t have as much control with this option (you can change many more
aspects of your link display if you set up the CSS yourself); but for quickly
modifying link behavior (especially if all you want to do is get rid of underlin-
ing), this shortcut is a good one. Simply choose Modify➪Page Properties and
make your changes in the Links category. Later, you can add additional prop-
erties via the regular CSS tools.

Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

Conflicting styles
Be careful when you apply more than one style to the same element (some-
thing that’s easier to do than you may realize). This advice holds true for CSS
styles as well as style attributes applied via HTML, such as font-styling prop-
erties. The styles may conflict, and because browsers aren’t all consistent in
the way in which they display styles, the results can be inconsistent and
undesirable.
For the most part, Netscape and Internet Explorer display all attributes
applied to an element, even if they’re from different style rules, as long as the
styles don’t conflict. If they do conflict, browsers prioritize styles depending
on how the styles have been defined and the order in which they appear. The
method for determining this priority is what cascading is all about.
Here’s an example to help you get the idea. You define a custom style named
.headline with red text that’s not bolded, and you apply it to a block of text
on the page. Then you decide that you want that text to be bold, so you apply
the bold tag independently by selecting it from the Properties inspector. You
have now used two different types of styles. Because they don’t conflict, all of
them take effect, and your text becomes bold and red. If, however, you apply
another color to the same block of text — blue, for example — using the
Properties inspector, you have a conflict.
Understanding how browsers handle these conflicts is important. The basic
guideline is that CSS rules get the highest priority, followed by HTML presen-
tation attributes (for example, align, color, face, and bgcolor), followed by the
browser default settings (font type and font size, for example). CSS rules
always get the highest priority in any scenario, and internal style sheets get
priority over external style sheets.
When two CSS styles conflict, priority is determined through the order of cas-
cade. Although this concept can get complex, one guideline to follow is that
the style that was listed most recently usually has priority. But instead of
bending your brain to figure out how rules cascade, you generally should
avoid creating styles that conflict. Either go back and redefine an existing
style, apply regular HTML tags individually, or create a new style. Remember
that you can use the Duplicate option by right-clicking (Control+click on a
Mac) a style in the CSS panel to create a new style with the attributes of one
that already exists, and then make minor alterations. (For more on editing
existing styles, see the following section.)
In cases where you do end up with conflicting styles, the best practice is to
view your page in a Web browser to see how the style looks to the user.
Although Dreamweaver 8 has greatly improved its rendering of CSS,
Dreamweaver still doesn’t always replicate the browser display perfectly.

Editing an existing style
You can change the attributes of any style after you have created it by editing
its style definitions. This capability is a major advantage of Cascading Style
Sheets: You can make global changes to a page or even to an entire Web site
by changing a style you applied to multiple elements through the use of an
external style sheet. Be aware, however, that everything you defined with
that style changes when you make your edit.
Remember that you can also create new styles by duplicating an existing
style and then altering it. Then, you can apply that new style without affect-
ing elements that are already formatted on your pages with the original ver-
sion of the style.
To edit an existing style, follow these steps:
1. Click the CSS button in the Properties inspector.
The CSS panel comes up.
2. Click the All button to list all the styles in effect on the page you have
open. 
3. Select from the list of styles the style you want to change. 
Dreamweaver displays the style definition in the Properties pane.
4. Click the value of the attribute you want to edit and select or type
your change.
The style sheet updates as soon as you make the edit. At the same time,
all elements you defined with that style automatically change.
Duplicating a style with a new name (style-disabled) and deleting the original
one is a quick way to disable an unwanted style without losing the code. This
way, you don’t have to re-create it if you ever want it back.
You can undo your edit by pressing Ctrl+Z (Windows) or Ô+Z (on a Mac), or
by choosing Edit➪Undo Set Attribute before doing anything else.
Defining CSS Rules
When you choose to make a new style and select one of the three style
options in the New CSS Rule dialog box, the CSS Rule Definition dialog box
opens. It’s where you decide how you want your style to look by selecting 
219
Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

the attribute options, which in CSS are referred to as rules. This dialog box
includes eight categories, each with multiple options you can use to define
various rules to apply as part of your CSS declaration. In this section, I dis-
cuss each of these eight categories.
You don’t have to make selections for all options in each category. In fact,
usually you only select a few properties from one category. Any options you
leave blank remain as the browser’s default. For example, if you don’t specify
a text color, the text displays as black or whatever the default color is.
Note: Some options in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box aren’t supported by
all current browsers and are included for future compatibility. Some CSS prop-
erties aren’t displayed here. Don’t be frustrated by options in these categories
that Dreamweaver doesn’t display. If they aren’t included in Dreamweaver, 
it’s because they’re fairly esoteric, advanced, or one of those properties that
just isn’t well-supported across current browsers. The good news is that
Macromedia is looking ahead and building these options into Dreamweaver 
so that they’re ready whenever these features are supported. Keep an eye on
the Macromedia Web site, at www.macromedia.com, and the Macromedia CSS
information site at www.macromedia.com/devnet/dreamweaver/css.html
for changes and updates to Dreamweaver, as well as for news about changing
standards and support for these CSS features. Always preview your work in
your target browser(s) to make sure the properties you set are properly 
supported.
The Type category
After you name your style and specify the fields described in the “Creating a
new style” section earlier in this chapter, click OK and the CSS Rule Definition
dialog box appears (see Figure 8-12).

Part III: Advancing Your Site 

When you choose Type from the Category list, the Type options are visible,
and you have these formatting options:
 Font: Specifies a font, font family, or series of families. You can add fonts
to the list by choosing Edit Font List from the drop-down list.
 Size: Defines the size of the text. You can choose a specific numeric size,
and the pop-up menu to the right of this field allows you to choose the
unit of measurement. You can also select from a list of relative values
(xx-small, x-small, and so on) that the browser interprets in relation to
other textual elements on the page.
 Style: Enables you to choose whether the text appears as normal, italic,
or oblique. (Italic and oblique are rarely different in a Web browser, so
stick with italic unless you have a specific reason not to.)
 Line Height: Enables you to specify the height of a line on which the text
is placed (graphic designers usually call it leading).
 Decoration: Enables you to specify whether text is underlined, overlined
(the line appears over the text rather than under it), or displayed with a
strikethrough. You can also choose Blink, which makes the text flash on
and off, or None, which removes all decorative effects.
Use the Decoration options sparingly, if at all. Links are automatically
underlined, so if you underline text that isn’t a link, you risk confusing
viewers. Overlined and strikethrough text can be hard to read. Use these
options only if they enhance your design. And, by all means, resist the
blink option; it’s distracting and can make the screen difficult to read.
(Overline and blink don’t display in the Document window; you must
preview your page in a Web browser to see these effects.)
 Weight: Enables you to control how bold the text displays by using a
specific or relative boldness option.
 Variant: Enables you to select a variation of the font, such as small 
caps. Unfortunately, this attribute isn’t yet supported by most browsers;
for example, if you specify small caps the text may simply display in 
all caps.
 Case: Enables you to globally change the case of selected words, making
them all uppercase or lowercase or with initial caps. 
 Color: Defines the color of the text. You can use the color well (the
square icon) to open a Web-safe color palette in which you can select
predefined colors or create custom colors.
After you select the Type options for your style sheet, click OK to save the
settings.

Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

The Background category
The Background category in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box (see 
Figure 8-13) enables you to specify a background color or image for a style 
that you can then apply to a block of text or an area of your Web page.
You can choose from these options:
 Background Color: Specifies the background color of an element, such
as a table. You can use the color well (the square icon) to open a Web-
safe color palette in which you can select predefined colors or create
custom colors.
 Background Image: Enables you to select a background image as part of
the style definition. Click the Browse button to select the image.
 Repeat: Determines how and whether the background image tiles across
and down the page. In all cases, the image is cropped if it doesn’t fit
behind the element.
The Repeat options are
• No Repeat: The background displays once at the beginning of the
element.
• Repeat: The background image repeats vertically and horizontally
behind the element.
• Repeat-x: The background repeats horizontally, but not vertically,
behind the element.
• Repeat-y: The background repeats vertically, but not horizontally,
behind the element.
Figure 8-13:
The
Background
category in
the CSS
Rule
Definition
dialog box.
222
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

 Attachment: This property determines how the background behaves
when the page is scrolled.
• Fixed: The background remains glued to one place in the viewing
area and does not scroll out of sight even when the Web page is
scrolled.
• Scroll: The background scrolls along with the Web page. This is the
default behavior for backgrounds.
 Horizontal Position: Allows you to align the image left, center, or right,
or to set a numeric value to determine the horizontal placement of the
background. You can use horizontal positioning only when the back-
ground doesn’t repeat.
 Vertical Position: Allows you to align the image top, center, or bottom,
or to set a numeric value to determine the vertical placement of the
background. You can use vertical positioning only when the background
doesn’t repeat.
The Block category
The Block category (see Figure 8-14) defines spacing and alignment settings
for tags and attributes.
You can choose from these options:
 Word Spacing: Defines the amount of white space inserted between
words in points, millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm), picas, inches,
pixels, ems, and exs.
Figure 8-14:
The Block
category in
the CSS
Rule
Definition
dialog box.
223
Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

 Letter Spacing: Defines the amount of white space inserted between let-
ters in points, millimeters (mm), centimeters (cm), picas, inches, pixels,
ems, and exs.
 Vertical Alignment: This property aligns inline elements like text and
images in relation to the elements that surround them. Note that you
may have to preview the page in a browser to see these effects. Your
options are baseline, sub, super, top, text-top, middle, bottom, text-
bottom, or you can set a numeric value.
 Text Align: Left, right, center, or justify your text.
 Text Indent: Specifies how far the first line of text is indented. Negative
numbers are allowed if you want the first line to stick out.
 Whitespace: This property tells the browser how to handle line breaks
and spaces within a block of text. Your options are Normal, Pre (for pre-
formatted), and Nowrap.
 Display: Indicates how to render an element in the browser. You can
hide an element by choosing None.
The Box category
The Box category (see Figure 8-15) defines settings for tags and attributes
that control the placement and appearance of elements on the page.
You can think of all HTML elements (even tags such as <A>) as boxes in terms
of CSS layout. You can use the Box category properties to set positioning and
spacing issues for these boxes:
Figure 8-15:
The Box
category in
the CSS
Rule
Definition

224
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

 Width, Height: Enable you to specify a width and height that you can
use in styles you apply to images, layers, or any other element that can
have its dimensions specified. You can use pixels, points, inches, 
centimeters, millimeters, picas, ems, exs, or percentages for your 
measurements.
 Float: Enables you to align a boxed element to the left or right so that
other elements, such as text, wrap around it.
 Clear: Prevents floating content from overlapping an area to the left 
or right, or to both sides. (This option doesn’t currently display in
Dreamweaver.)
 Padding: Sets the amount of space around an element to its edge. You
can set padding separately for the top, right, bottom, and left. Padding is
measured in pixels, points, inches, centimeters, millimeters, picas, ems,
exs, and percentages.
 Margin: Sets the amount of space between the edge of an element and
other elements on the page. You can set the margin separately for the
top, right, bottom, and left. Padding is measured in pixels, points,
inches, centimeters, millimeters, picas, ems, exs, and percentages.
For more on using the Box category for layout, see Chapter 9.
The Border category
The Border category defines settings — such as width, color, and style — 
for the borders of box elements on a page. Your options are Style, Width, 
and Color (see Figure 8-16). Many borders are not reproduced properly in
Dreamweaver; use your browser to preview the results.
Figure 8-16:
The Border

the CSS
Rule
Definition

225
Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

The List category
The List category defines settings, such as bullet size and type, for list tags.
You can specify whether bullets are disc, circle, square, decimal, lower-
roman, upper-roman, upper alpha, lower alpha, or none. If you want to use a
custom bullet, you can use the Browse button to locate an image to be used
as the bullet. You can control the location of the list bullet in relation to the
list item (see Figure 8-17).
The Positioning category
The Positioning category (see Figure 8-18) enables you to precisely position
elements on a page. This style uses the tag specified for defining layers in the
Layer preferences. The default in Dreamweaver for layers is the <DIV> tag.
You can change it by editing the Layer preferences. The <DIV> tag is the most
commonly supported, however, so you should try to stick with it. See Chap-
ter 9 for more on layer preferences.
To understand how positioning works, it’s important to know that positioning
is done relative to something else, like another element on the page or the
browser window. How you set up positioning to work depends on where your
element is on the page, and what other elements it may be inside. Here are
the Positioning options:
 Type: Enables you to specify the position of a layer as absolute, relative,
or static:
• Absolute: This positioning uses the top and left coordinates
entered in the Placement text boxes to control the position of the
layer relative to the upper-left corner of the Web page or to the ele-
ment that contains this element.
Figure 8-17:
The List
category in
the CSS
Rule
Definition
dialog box.
226
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

• Relative: This positioning uses a position relative to the point you
insert it into the page.
• Static: This positioning keeps the layer in the place where you
insert it on the page relative to the browser window. Scrolling the
window doesn’t have an effect on a static element, so be careful
not to place it over other information. 
 Visibility: Enables you to control whether the browser displays the ele-
ment. You can use this feature, combined with a scripting language, such
as JavaScript, to dynamically change the display of layers. Visibility is
used to create a number of effects on a page because you can control
when something is seen or not seen. For example, you can cause an ele-
ment to appear on a page only when a user clicks a button, and then
make it disappear when the button is clicked again.
The default is to inherit the original element’s visibility value:
• Inherit: The layer has the visibility of the element in which it is
contained.
• Visible: The layer is displayed. 
• Hidden: The layer isn’t displayed.
 Width, Height: Enables you to specify a width and height that you can
use in styles you apply to images, layers, or any other element that 
can have its dimensions specified. You can use pixels, points, inches,
centimeters, millimeters, picas, ems, exs, or percentages for your 
measurements.
 Z-Index: Controls the position of the layer on the Z coordinate, which is
how it stacks in relation to other elements on the page. Higher-numbered
layers overlap lower-numbered layers.
 Overflow: Tells the browser how to display the contents of a layer if the
layer doesn’t contain the entire contents. (This option does not cur-
rently display in the Dreamweaver Workspace.)
Figure 8-18:
The
Positioning
category in
the CSS
Rule
Definition
dialog box.
227
Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

• Visible: Forces the layer to increase in size to display all its con-
tents. The layer expands downward and to the right.
• Hidden: Cuts off the contents of the layer that don’t fit. This
option doesn’t provide any scroll bars.
• Scroll: Adds scroll bars to the layer regardless of whether the con-
tents exceed the layer’s size.
• Auto: Makes scroll bars appear only when the layer’s contents
exceed its boundaries. (This feature does not currently display in
the Dreamweaver Workspace.)
 Placement: Defines the size and location of an element layer within its
containing element. For example, you can set the right edge of the ele-
ment to line up with the right edge of the element that contains it. The
default values are measured in pixels, but you can also use pc (picas), pt
(points), in (inches), mm (millimeters), cm (centimeters), or % (percent-
age of the parent’s value).
 Clip: When the content of an element overflows the space allotted and
you set the Overflow property to scroll or auto, you can set the clip set-
tings to specify which part of the layer is visible by controlling which
part of the layer is cropped if it doesn’t fit in the display area.
The Extensions category
Extensions (see Figure 8-19) include filters and cursor options:
 Pagebreak: Inserts a point in a page where a printer sees a page break.
This option allows you to control the way the document is printed.
 Cursor: Defines the type of cursor that appears when a user moves the
cursor over an element.
Figure 8-19:

Extensions
category in
the CSS
Rule

228

 Filter: Enables you to apply to elements special effects such as drop
shadows, motion blurs, and many others. These are only visible in
Microsoft Internet Explorer.
Using External Style Sheets
The first part of this chapter focuses on using CSS only in the context of 
internal style sheets. Internal style sheet information is stored in the HTML
code of the document you’re working on and applies to only the current 
document. If you want to create styles you can share among documents, 
you need to use external style sheets. External style sheets enable you to
create styles you can apply to pages throughout a Web site by storing the
style sheet information in a separate text page that can be linked to from 
any HTML document.
External style sheets (also called linked style sheets) are where you can real-
ize the greatest timesavings with CSS. You can define styles for common for-
matting options used throughout an entire site, such as headlines, captions,
and even images, which makes applying multiple formatting options to ele-
ments fast and easy. Big news- and magazine-type Web sites often use exter-
nal style sheets because they need to follow a consistent look and feel
throughout the site, even when many people are working on the same site.
Typing styles to HTML tags via an external style sheet is a foolproof way of
making sure that everyone creating content for your Web site ends up with
pages that look the same. Using external style sheets also makes global
changes easier because when you change the external style sheet, you glob-
ally change every element to which you applied the style throughout the site.
Creating an external style sheet
You create external style sheets almost exactly the same way you create
internal style sheets, except that external style sheets need to be saved as
separate files. When you use Dreamweaver to create an external style sheet,
Dreamweaver automatically links the style sheet to the page you’re working
on. You can then link it to any other Web page in which you want to apply the
style definitions.
To create an external style sheet, follow these steps:
1. Choose Text➪CSS Styles➪New.
The New CSS Rule dialog box appears.
2. Select from the Selector Type category the type of style you want to
create.
Remember that you have three options: Class, Tag, or Advanced.
229
Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

3. Fill out the Name field, or select an option from the Tag or Selector
fields, depending on which selector type you chose in Step 2.
4. In the Define In area, select (New Style Sheet File).
5. Click OK.
The Save Style Sheet File As dialog box opens.
6. Select a location in which to save the style sheet file and click Save.
Name the file and be sure to use a .css extension to identify your file
as a style sheet.
Dreamweaver automatically adds the .css; just make sure you don’t
delete it.
7. Click Save.
The CSS Rule Definition dialog box opens.
8. Define the new style rule specifying all formatting options you want
applied with the new style.
9. Click OK to save the new style and close the dialog box.
Your new style is saved to your external style sheet and made available
to link to any of the files in your Web site. 
Linking to an external style sheet
After you set up an external style sheet, you may want to link it to additional
Web pages. Begin by opening the page to which you want to attach the style
sheet, and follow these steps:
1. Choose Window➪CSS Styles.
The CSS panel appears.
2. Click the Attach Style Sheet icon in the CSS panel (the first button in
the lower-right area).
The Attach External Style Sheet dialog box appears (shown in Figure 8-20),
prompting you to select the location of the external style sheet. You can
type the URL if it’s a remote file on the Web like this line:
http://www.mycompany.com/CSS/mystyle.css
or use the Browse button to locate a file inside your site folder and
Dreamweaver automatically sets the link for you.
Notice that two options are available for linking to an external style
sheet: Link and Import. Attaching a style sheet by linking it is the pure
HTML way to handle attachment; importing is intended to allow one
style sheet to call another.
230
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

The Media drop-down list allows you to select a scenario for which to
use the style sheet. For example, if you’ve created a style sheet that for-
mats your page correctly for PDA display, select the Handheld option on
this menu.
3. After you select the external style sheet, click the OK button.
The dialog box disappears, and the external CSS file automatically links
to your page. Any styles you have defined in the external style sheet
now appear in the CSS panel, and any redefined HTML styles or CSS
selectors are automatically applied to the page. Because you have estab-
lished a link on this page to the external style sheet, the styles in the
external style sheet always appear in the CSS panel whenever you open
this file (see Figure 8-21).
Figure 8-21:

Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

4. To apply a style on your page, select the text to which you want to
apply the style and apply the style in the same way you would with an
internal style sheet.
For more on applying styles, see the section “Applying styles in
Dreamweaver,” earlier in this chapter.
Editing an external style sheet
You edit linked external style sheets exactly the same way as you edit inter-
nal style sheets using the CSS panel, which lists all styles in the document,
whether they’re internal or external. Use the Properties pane of the CSS panel
to directly edit the rules for each style. Any changes you make to the external
style sheet are automatically made, even though it’s a separate document 
(as long as the style sheet exists locally on the computer). If you try to edit 
a remote CSS file from a linked page in Dreamweaver, you can’t because
Dreamweaver doesn’t have edit privileges for the file. 
If you want to edit a remote CSS file, you have to download the file to your
hard drive before you can open it in Dreamweaver. In Dreamweaver, you can
open .css files by either double-clicking them or choosing File➪Open, both
of which open the style sheet in Code view. Code view is the only view avail-
able for CSS files because they’re text files and have no layout components.
When you view an external style sheet this way, you can still use the CSS
panel to edit the style sheet, even if the style sheet isn’t linked to an HTML
page. Be sure to save it when you finish editing it! Of course, if you prefer, you
can also edit the code by hand directly in Code view. Figure 8-22 shows an
example of a style sheet opened directly in Dreamweaver. Notice that the CSS
panel displays all relevant style information and gives you access to the CSS
editing tools.
When you finish editing an external style sheet, you need to upload it to your
server before the styles apply to pages on your live Web site.
Applying ready-made external style sheets
Macromedia includes a bunch of sample style sheets for you to use to create
new pages in your Web site. These come in the form of external styles sheets
that have been created with some popular styles in mind to help you get better
acquainted with style sheets and give you a jump-start in designing with them.
You can either use these styles as is or modify them to suit your needs.
232
Part III: Advancing Your Site 

To access the sample style sheets provided by Macromedia, follow these steps:
1. File➪New.
The New Document dialog box opens (see Figure 8-23).
2. Select CSS Style Sheets from the Category list to display the list of CSS
files, and try clicking any of the sample styles that are listed.
Notice that a preview of how the style appears displays on the right side
of the dialog box when you click any of the sample styles.
3. Select a style you like and click Create.
A new, untitled style sheet in Code view opens.
4. To save the style sheet, choose File➪Save (or Save As) and save it in
the site directory where you plan to use it. 
You can also modify the rules before saving the file if you want to cus-
tomize your style sheet. If you do this, be sure to choose Save As instead
of Save so that you don’t overwrite the sample file.

Chapter 8: Cascading Style Sheets

Using Design Time Style Sheets
After you become savvy about using style sheets, you’ll find that working
with external style sheets affords the most power because you can link to
them from multiple pages in your site rather than have to create a new inter-
nal style sheet for each page in your site. You also have the added advantage
that you can easily alter your styles in just one place if you need to make
changes after styles are applied. Even better, you can create multiple external
style sheets as part of the design process and use a Dreamweaver feature
called Design Time Style Sheets to switch back and forth between them as
you work on your document.
One benefit of the Design Time Style Sheets feature is that you can view how
different external style sheets affect your page without having to link to them.
This feature is a great way to quickly switch back and forth between style
sheets in a document and explore various what-if scenarios with the style
sheets you create before you apply them. You may begin to like this feature
because you can play around with and explore the full power of CSS.
After you decide that you like a particular style sheet, you can apply it to
your page as you do any other style sheet. (See the section, “Applying Styles
in Dreamweaver,” earlier in this chapter for how to apply a style.)

Part III: Advancing Your Site 

Design Time Style Sheets affect only the appearance of styles in Dream-
weaver. Because they’re not real links, they show up only at runtime when a
Dreamweaver document is open. Design Time Style Sheet info is also stored
in a Design Note file. If you want to preserve your Design Time Style Sheet
info, be sure that you don’t delete the corresponding Design Note file.
To set up Design Time Style sheets, follow these steps:
1. Choose Text➪CSS Styles➪Design-Time.
The Design Time Style Sheets dialog box appears (see Figure 8-24).
2. To work with a specific style sheet, click the Add Item (+) button
above the Show Only at Design Time field.
The Select File dialog box appears, and you can select a CSS file.
Remember that CSS files usually end with a .css extension. You can 
also add multiple CSS files by clicking the Add button again to add a 
new CSS file.
3. To hide a specific style sheet, click the Add Item (+) button above the
Hide at Design Time field and select from the Select File dialog box
the style you want to hide.
4. To delete a listed style sheet from either category, select the style
sheet and click the Remove Item (-) button to delete it.

the design control of layers. You discover how Macromedia

A
s the Web and those of us who use it mature in our experience and tech-
nical prowess, using complex HTML features, such as CSS layouts and
Dynamic HTML, is becoming more common. Two powerful Dreamweaver fea-
tures make creating advanced HTML and DHTML possible: layers and behav-
iors. Brace yourself, you’re getting into some of the most complex Dreamweaver
Web-design features in this chapter, but I think you’ll find the power and pre-
cision of these options well worth the effort. 
This chapter starts off by introducing Dreamweaver’s Layers features, which
enable precise positioning of text, images, and other elements on a page,
using the <DIV> tag and CSS layouts. You also find step-by-step instructions
for creating your own CSS layouts (a complex, but infinitely customizable
way to create page layouts).
The rest of this chapter explains how to implement DHTML into your Web pages
by applying behaviors to elements on your pages. Doing so allows you to add
some of the most advanced design features and interactivity to your Web pages.
Working with Layers
Layers permit precise positioning of elements on an HTML page. Think of a
layer as a container for other elements, such as images, text, tables, and even

other layers. You can put this container anywhere on an HTML page, and
even stack these containers on top of each other.
Using layers, you can position text blocks and images exactly where you want
them on a page by placing them in a <DIV> tag and then specifying the layer’s
distance from the top and left sides of a page, or from another layer. This
complexity and control is sorely missing from standard HTML. One of the
greatest limitations of HTML is its inability to stack elements on top of each
other. With layers, a positioning option called the Z index adds this capabil-
ity, which allows you to layer text, images, and other elements.
Because a layer is a container, you can manipulate everything in it as a unit,
such as moving a layer on top of another layer or making the entire layer visi-
ble or invisible.
Remember that pre-algebra teacher who was addicted to transparencies and
the overhead projector? Layers work similarly to those transparencies: You
can move layers around to position elements exactly where you want them,
use the layers to overlap elements on a page, or turn the layers on and off to
control visibility. If you’re new to layers, you may want to check out the fol-
lowing sections and experiment a little with creating layers, adding images
and other elements, and moving layers around.
Creating layers
To create a layer, follow these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪Layout Objects➪Layer.
A box representing an empty layer appears at the top of the page out-
lined in blue (see Figure 9-1).
Alternatively, you can click the Draw Layer button in the Layout Insert bar
and then click and drag to create a new layer anywhere in the work area.
240
Part IV: Making It Cool 
Layer not <LAYER>
The term layers can be confusing. Several years
ago there was an actual <LAYER> HTML tag.
However, it never became part of the HTML
standard. In fact, today it’s completely obsolete.
Nonetheless, you may find tutorials and refer-
ences to the <LAYER> tag.
Don’t confuse the HTML tag with Dreamweaver
layers, which are actually just absolutely posi-
tioned <DIV> tags controlled by CSS styles.

2. Click anywhere along the outline of the layer box to select it.
When you hold the mouse over the outline of the layer, the cursor turns
to a four-pointed arrow (or a hand on the Macintosh). You also see eight
tiny, square handles around the perimeter of the box.
3. Click and drag any of the handles to resize the layer.
Adding elements, resizing, 
and repositioning layers
To make a layer useful, you have to put something inside it. You can place
pretty much anything within a layer that you can place in a document. To add
images or text to a layer, follow these steps:
1. Click to insert your cursor inside the layer.
A blinking cursor appears inside the layer box.
2. Choose Insert➪Image.
The Select Image Source dialog box appears.

3. Click the filename of the image you want to insert.
4. Click OK.
The Image Tag Accessibility Attributes dialog box opens.
If you don’t want this box to open each time you insert an image, you
can change the accessibility attributes by choosing Edit➪Preferences
(Windows) or Dreamweaver➪Preferences (Mac).
5. Fill in the Alternate text and Long description fields and click OK.
The image appears inside the layer.
6. Select the image and use the Properties inspector to make any format-
ting changes to it.
Formatting images inside layers works the same way as on a regular HTML
page. For example, using the Align Center icon centers the image in the
layer. Find more information about formatting images in Chapter 5.
7. Click inside the layer again to insert your cursor and enter some text
(see Figure 9-2).

8. Highlight the text and format it by using the text-formatting options in
the Properties inspector or by choosing formatting options from the
Text menu. Or, use the Style drop-down list in the Properties inspec-
tor to apply or define a style.
Formatting text inside layers is just like formatting text inside a regular
Dreamweaver document. You can read more about formatting text in
Chapter 2.
9. Click the tab that appears in the upper-left area of the layer or any-
where along the border to select the layer.
You know that you have successfully selected the layer when you see
the selection handles, the little black squares that appear at the corners
and in the middle of each side.
10. Click any handle and drag to resize the layer.
As a general rule, always size a layer so that its contents just fit within its
boundaries. Positioning the layer on the page is then easier.
Rather than drag to resize, you can type new measurements for the
width (W) and height (H) directly into the Properties inspector (refer to
Figure 9-2). The Properties inspector displays these options only when
the layer is selected.
11. To move a layer, click and drag the little tab (which appears in the
upper-left area of the layer when it’s selected).
Because layers use exact, or absolute, positioning, you can move them to
any precise location on a page, and they display in that exact location in
browsers that support layers, such as Netscape Navigator 4 and Internet
Explorer 4 and later.
The Properties inspector also displays the Layer coordinates when the
layer is selected: L (for left), T (for top). In addition to using the click-
and-drag method to move a layer, you can change a layer’s position by
entering a number in the position boxes, L (number of pixels from the
left edge of the page), and T (number of pixels from the top of the page).
12. Name your layer by typing a name in the Layer ID text box in the
upper-left corner of the Properties inspector.
When you create a new layer, Dreamweaver automatically names your
layers for you, starting with Layer1, Layer2, and so on. You should change
the name to something more descriptive, especially if you’re working with
lots of layers on a page. Keeping track of them by name makes them much
easier to manage. Remember that you must select the layer first in order
for its properties to appear in the Properties inspector.
243
Chapter 9: Advanced HTML: CSS Layouts, DHTML, and Behaviors

Stacking layers and changing visibility
A powerful feature of layers is their maneuverability: You can stack them on
top of each other and make them visible or invisible. Later in this chapter, in
the “Working with Behaviors” section, you find out how to use these features
in combination with behaviors to create rollovers and other effects. To stack
layers, simply drag one layer on top of another. Unlike images, layers give
you complete layout control on the page by including the capability to over-
lap one another. To overlap images, simply place each image within a sepa-
rate layer and then move one layer so that it overlaps the other. To let you
control which layer is on top, Dreamweaver provides two ways of changing
the order of stacking: the Z index, available in the Properties inspector, and
the Layers panel (see Figure 9-3), which you can access by choosing
Window➪Layers.
To stack layers and change their order and visibility, follow these steps:
1. Open a page that has two or more layers on it.
2. Select the layer by clicking anywhere on the border outline of the
layer.
Figure 9-3:
The Layers
panel

visibility and

244
Part IV: Making It Cool 

3. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel.
The Layers panel lists any layers that appear on your page. If you’re famil-
iar with layers in Adobe Photoshop or Macromedia Fireworks, you may
find some similarities here, such as the eye icon to control layer visibility
and the capability to drag layers around in the panel to reposition them.
4. Reorder the stacking of the layers by changing the Z-Index number of
the layers in the Properties inspector.
You can also change the Z-Index number in the Layers panel. The lowest
number is the bottommost layer. To change the number, simply click to
select it and type the new number.
You can rename a layer by double-clicking the name in the Layers panel
to select it and then typing a new name.
5. Click the eye icon to the left of any layer in the Layers panel to turn
the layer visibility on or off (refer to Figure 9-3).
If no eye appears, the visibility is set to default, which usually means on,
except in the case of nested layers. (You can find out about nested
layers in the next section.) If the eye is open, the layer is visible on the
screen and in the browser. If the eye is closed, the layer is invisible; it’s
still there — it just isn’t displayed on-screen or in the browser.
If you want to prevent any of your layers from overlapping, check the
Prevent Overlaps check box in the Layers panel.
Nesting layers: One happy family
Another way to position layers on a page is by nesting them. A nested layer is
essentially a layer that’s invisibly tied to another layer and maintains a kind of
parent-child relationship with the first layer. The child layer uses the upper-
left corner of the parent layer as its orientation point for positioning rather
than the upper-left corner of the browser window because it’s nested within
the parent layer. Even if the layers are on different areas of the page, they still
retain this parent-child relationship. When you move the first layer around on
the page, the nested layer moves along with it. You can also think of this sce-
nario as an owner walking his dog on a leash — where the owner goes, the
dog has to follow, even though the dog can still move independently of its
owner within the confines of the length of the leash.
If you were to nest another layer into the child layer, that would then make
the child layer both a parent and a child. The new layer then uses the upper-
left corner of its parent layer as its orientation point. The first layer in the
nested chain still retains control over all the child layers, so they all move
when the parent moves.
Nested layers can be a great way to keep chunks of your layout working
together as you move them around the page. Rather than try to keep track of
245
Chapter 9: Advanced HTML: CSS Layouts, DHTML, and Behaviors

loads of different layers and move each one individually, you can group them
into more easily manageable family units. Furthermore, you can make a whole
family visible or invisible by clicking the eye icon of the parent layer in the
Layers panel if the child layer’s visibility has been set to default (no eye icon
in the Layers panel). When the child layer’s visibility is set to default, it inher-
its the visibility of its parent layer. As you experiment with layers and start
using lots of them on your page, understanding inheritance becomes essen-
tial. Be aware, though, that when a child layer is set to either visible (eye icon
on) or invisible (eye icon off) in the Layers panel, it’s unaffected by the visi-
bility setting of its parent layer.
To create a nested layer, follow these steps:
1. Choose Insert➪Layout Objects➪Layer.
A box representing the layer appears at the top of the page. Dreamweaver
automatically names the layer Layer1.
2. Place the cursor inside the first layer, and choose Insert➪Layout
Objects➪Layer to create a second layer inside the first.
3. Position the second layer anywhere on the page by dragging the small
tab in the upper-left corner of the layer box or clicking and dragging
anywhere on the layer’s border.
Visually, nested layers don’t need to reside inside their parent layers; they
can be placed anywhere else on the page or be stacked on top of each
other.
4. Choose Window➪Layers to open the Layers panel, if it isn’t already
open.
The Layers panel opens.
In the Layers panel, you see that a nested layer displays underneath and
slightly indented from its parent, and a line shows their relationship (see
Figure 9-4).

Setting layer options
Like other HTML elements, layers have many attributes you can set.
Dreamweaver makes these options available in the Properties inspector
whenever you select a layer.
This list describes the layer options and what they control:
 Layer ID: You can type your own descriptive name on this drop-down
list in the upper-left corner of the Properties inspector. If you don’t name
a layer, Dreamweaver names it for you. Use only standard alphanumeric
characters for a layer name (don’t use special characters, such as
spaces, hyphens, slashes, or periods).
 L (Left): This value specifies the distance of the layer from the left side
of the page or parent layer. Dreamweaver automatically enters a pixel
value when you create or move a layer by dragging and dropping it. You
can also enter a numeric value in pixels or percents (positive or nega-
tive) to control the positioning.
 T (Top): This value specifies the distance of the layer from the top of the
page or parent layer. Dreamweaver automatically enters a pixel value
when you create or move a layer by dragging and dropping. You can also
enter a numeric value in pixels or percents (positive or negative) to con-
trol the positioning.
 W (Width): Dreamweaver automatically specifies the width when you
create a layer on a page. You also have the option of entering a numeric
value to specify the width. You can change the px (pixels) default mea-
surement to any of the following: pc (picas), pt (points), in (inches), mm
(millimeters), cm (centimeters), or % (percentage of the page or parent
layer’s width). Don’t put any spaces between the number and the mea-
surement abbreviation.
 H (Height): Dreamweaver automatically specifies the height when you
create a layer on a page. You also have the option of entering a numeric
value to specify the height. You can change the default measurement of
px (pixels) to any of the following: pc (picas), pt (points), in (inches),
mm (millimeters), cm (centimeters), or % (percentage of the page or
parent layer’s height). Don’t put any spaces between the number and
the measurement abbreviation.
 Z-Index: This option determines the position of a layer in relation to
other layers when layers are stacked. Higher-numbered layers appear on
top of lower-numbered layers, and values can be positive or negative.
 Vis: This visibility setting controls whether a layer is visible or invisible.
You can modify this setting with a scripting language, such as JavaScript,
to dynamically change the display of layers.
247
Chapter 9: Advanced HTML: CSS Layouts, DHTML, and Behaviors

You can choose from these visibility options:
• Default: The default option in most browsers is the same visibility
property as the parent’s value. If there is no parent layer, the
default state is visible.
• Inherit: This option always uses the visibility property of the
layer’s parent.
• Visible: This option always displays the layer, regardless of the
parent’s value.
• Hidden: This option always makes the layer transparent (invisi-
ble), regardless of the parent’s value. Even when it’s hidden, all the
content on a layer downloads when the page is viewed in the
browser. You can dynamically control visibility by using the
JavaScript behaviors covered in “Working with Behaviors” later in
this chapter.
 Bg Image: With this option, you can select a background image for the
layer in the same way that you would select a background image for a
Web page. Click the folder icon to select an image or enter the name and
path in the text box.
 Bg Color: Use this option to set a background color for a layer. Clicking
the color square opens the color palette. If you want the layer background
to be transparent, leave Bg Color blank.
 Overflow: These options determine how the contents of a layer display
if they exceed the size of the layer. 
You can choose from these Overflow options:
• Visible: If the layer has too much content, this option lets the con-
tent spill out over the edges of the layer — though this effect may
not perform as expected in certain browsers. Making sure that con-
tent won’t escape the confines of a layer is usually the best. Be
sure to preview the results in the browser to make sure you get the
effect you want.
• Hidden: Clips off the edges of content that doesn’t fit within the
specified size of a layer. Be careful with this option; it doesn’t pro-
vide any scroll bars.
• Scroll: Adds scroll bars to the sides of a layer regardless of
whether its contents exceed the layer’s size.
• Auto: Displays scroll bars only if the layer’s contents don’t fit
within the layer’s boundaries.
 Clip: This option controls which sections of the contents of a layer are
cropped if the layer isn’t large enough to display all its contents. You
should specify the distance from the L (Left), T (Top), R (Right), and B
(Bottom). You have to specify clips in pixels, or choose the Auto value.

Converting tables to layers: Precise 
positioning for older Web pages
If you want to achieve precise pixel-perfect positioning of elements on a Web
page, layers are the easiest way to do it. You can achieve precision at a level
impossible to obtain using regular HTML. Unfortunately, this wasn’t always
true. Back in the bad old days of browser versions 4.0 and earlier, layers were
only wishful thinking.
So what happens if you want to work with a Web page created at that time, or
better yet, bring that page into the world of CSS? If you’re in this situation,
you’re sure to be pleased to find that Dreamweaver has a tool for you. Using
this feature, you can convert a layout created years ago using older tech-
niques into an HTML page that uses layers. 
To convert a page that uses tables to one that uses layers and maintains 
the same page layout, choose Modify➪Convert➪Tables to Layers. Dreamweaver
rebuilds the page using layers you can easily reposition with pixel-level 
precision.
You can go in the other direction, too, and convert layers into tables. Choose
Modify➪Convert➪Layers to Tables, and the layers convert to a table structure
that mimics the layers’ positioning and uses table cells to control placement. 
The Dreamweaver Layers to Table conversion feature isn’t perfect because
you can do things with layers that you can’t do with tables. For example, you
can’t convert a page that contains nested or overlapping layers. Some design-
ers use the Layers to Table conversion feature to create multiple pages and
then direct visitors to the most appropriate design for their browsers, even if
they have to alter the table version to make it look okay without all the
DHTML features. Just make sure to use the Save As feature to save your con-
verted page with a new name so that you have both versions.
Using CSS for Page Layout
Besides using CSS to format text, you can control visual formatting and lay
out pages using the positioning features of CSS. Complex CSS layouts are
becoming an increasingly popular alternative to complicated table layouts.
Today’s savvy Web designers are taking the time to learn how to make the
most of CSS so that they can reap the benefits: quick design edits today, and
faster Web site redesigns down the line. Should you abandon table layouts in
favor of CSS? There’s not a right or wrong answer here. Tables are still a valid
layout technique, but they are harder to edit and update down the line. At the
249
Chapter 9: Advanced HTML: CSS Layouts, DHTML, and Behaviors

same time, remember that developing a really powerful CSS structure takes
time and experience, not to mention a lot of testing in the browsers you
expect your Web site visitors to use. 
Take a look at examples of CSS-designed Web pages as you begin to explore
the world of CSS for layout. Get started by visiting a site maintained by CSS
guru Eric Meyer (www.meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge). You should also visit
the CSS Zen Garden (www.csszengarden.com), a collaborative project that
repurposes the same HTML code with CSS designs created by graphic design-
ers. On these sites, you find lots of examples of CSS-designed pages and gen-
eral tips about using CSS. 
To use CSS for page layout, explore the Block, Border, and Positioning cate-
gories in the CSS Rule Definition dialog box, described in Chapter 8. Before
you move on to these more complex topics, make sure you’re familiar with
the basic ones covered in Chapter 8.
The Box model
The key to understanding the way CSS works with page layout is to think in
terms of the Box model. The Box model asserts that any element tag in an
HTML document is handled by CSS as a container box. When you define a
CSS rule and apply it to your page, you’re creating a box on the page, not too
unlike a cell in a table. This box acts as a container for your content and has
attributes such as margin, border, and padding, for example. 
Although you can use any CSS element for page layout purposes, the <DIV>
tag is used most often to create page layouts. <DIV> stands for division, and
these tags are quite simply containers that hold other content — in other
words, to make a division on the page. Any content on a page that is sur-
rounded by an opening and closing < DIV> tag becomes an object (also
referred to as a box or layer) with properties such as border, margin, height,
and width that you can manipulate using CSS.
Inline elements flow with text and don’t contain begin and end lines. For
example, the <B> and <IMG> tags are inline elements. You can place these ele-
ments one after another, and a new line break doesn’t appear between each
element. They simply flow with the text.
In contrast, a block element is one that interrupts the flow of the page, creat-
ing a box or block around which other page elements align. Some regular
HTML tags are block elements, like the <P> tag, which creates a line break
before and after it is used and doesn’t allow anything to display alongside it.
Using the <DIV> tag to create your block elements is handy, and that’s, in
fact, what it’s intended to do.
Dreamweaver layers, discussed earlier in this chapter, are CSS block elements
that have had absolute positioning attributes applied to them.
250
Part IV: Making It Cool 

Using classes and ID selectors
You can implement CSS styles in one of three ways:
 Define certain attributes for an HTML tag. Anytime the tag is used,
those attributes are applied.
 Create a custom style with a unique name. Apply the style to any exist-
ing element in the Web page by the addition of the Class attribute.
Use the <SPAN> tag on its own to apply a style:
<SPAN CLASS=”HEADLINE”>Headline text</SPAN>
Or, apply the style to an existing HTML tag:
<P CLASS=”HEADLINE”>Headline text</P>
 Define certain attributes that are only used once in a Web page. For
example, when you create a copyright footer at the bottom of the page,
its unique style is applied using the ID attribute.
You can apply the ID attribute to any tag, but it’s frequently used with
the <DIV> tag:
<DIV ID=”COPYRIGHT”>Copyright 2005</DIV>
Creating a CSS Layout
In this section, you find out how to create a custom CSS layout. This is more
complicated than using Dreamweaver’s layers option, but it provides you
complete control. 
In this section, you work with the <DIV> tag to create a sample layout. As you
begin to master this technique, you’re well on your way to designing any kind
of CSS page layout. Figure 9-5 shows a Web page with CSS layout. 
Starting with content
To get started, you need to start a new page and put some text on the page:
1. Start a new document by choosing File➪New.
The New Document window opens.
2. Select Basic Page from the Category list and HTML from the Basic
Page list. Click the Create button.
Your new document opens in the Document window.
251
Chapter 9: Advanced HTML: CSS Layouts, DHTML, and Behaviors

3. Type an identifying phrase at the top of your document. Press Enter
(or Return) once to start a new paragraph.
In my example (refer to Figure 9-5), I typed “Logo would be here”. 
4. Repeat Step 3 as many times as you need.
In my example (refer to Figure 9-5), I created two more blocks of text
reading “Left-hand column” and “Main column.” 
5. Choose File➪Save and save your document.
Creating and applying CSS rules
After you have boilerplate text in your template, you must create the styles
that build and control the layout and apply them to the text. 
Follow these steps to set up the bounding box shown as a dashed line (refer
to Figure 9-1):
1. Click and drag to select all the text in your document.
2. Choose Insert➪Layout Objects➪Div Tag. 
The Insert Div Tag dialog box opens (see Figure 9-6).

The New CSS Rule dialog box opens (see Figure 9-7).
4. Select the Advanced radio button.
5. Type a name in the Selector field.
You can enter any name in the Selector field to identify the selector
you’re creating; just make sure you don’t use spaces or special charac-
ters and always include the # sign, which is the way you indicate an ID
selector in CSS.
In my example, I used #wrapper as my name.
6. Choose the This Document Only radio button, and click OK.
The CSS Rule Definition dialog box opens.
7. Select the Box category and choose the following settings (see

The style is created and visible in the CSS panel, and it is applied to 
the text.
Congratulations! You have a reasonably complex CSS layout in front of you.
Now you need to understand a couple of strategies that are at work here:
 The Float attribute aligns an element in a Web page to the left or right
and flows other elements around it. Text wraps to the right of an ele-
ment floated left, just as it does when you use the Align attribute with
the <IMG> tag. To make your layout resemble Figure 9-5 exactly, use the
Enter (or Return) key to add space below the first line of text and then
type some additional text.
 By creating a <DIV> tag that contains the two smaller columns and set-
ting the Padding attribute, you create the effect of white space between
the borders and the content in the <DIV> tag.
You can experiment using this layout by adding text and other HTML, not to
mention other CSS styles. A <DIV> tag can contain any content you put into a
Web page, so get creative!
Although this layout method may seem complicated, it is incredibly powerful
and loads quickly in a browser because little actual HTML code is generated.
This style of layout relies on positioning the block elements in relation to
each other, influenced by any margin and padding settings you choose. (Take
a peek at the Code view to see just how little code was generated.)
All about DHTML
Dynamic HTML (DHTML) has received so much hype and attention that you
would think you could do anything with it, including your laundry. Well,
DHTML isn’t quite powerful enough to take over your domestic duties, but it
257
Chapter 9: Advanced HTML: CSS Layouts, DHTML, and Behaviors

does add a range of functionality to a Web page that has been impossible
with HTML alone. In fact, DHTML is kind of like HTML on steroids. DHTML is
really about using advanced scripting techniques to create dynamic content,
which is impossible with HTML alone. Dynamic content means that you can
create and alter page content after the page has been loaded in a browser.
JavaScript has been used by designers to add dynamic effects to Web pages
for a while, but with DHTML you can affect the attributes of HTML tags,
which means that you can create many more kinds of effects and make them
happen more quickly.
The biggest drawback of DHTML is the same as you find with any reasonably
complex Web technology: Because browsers aren’t consistent about support,
some cool things you can do with DHTML don’t work in all browsers. Testing
in all the browsers you think your Web site visitors might use is important.
However, Dreamweaver includes features to make it easier than ever to
design pages that work in various browsers.
DHTML is, however, much more complicated to write than regular old HTML.
Even HTML frames, which are complex by many Web design standards, look
relatively simple when compared to JavaScript and the kind of code you have
to write in order to create DHTML. This area is where Dreamweaver shines:
Macromedia has implemented a series of tools that let you create DHTML
effects without having to be a JavaScript programmer.
Working with Behaviors
Some of the coolest features used on the Web today are created by using
Dreamweaver behaviors, which use a scripting language called JavaScript.
These behaviors are really just built-in scripts — some of which use DHTML
and some of which don’t — that provide an easy way to add interactivity to
your Web pages. You can apply behaviors to many elements on an HTML page
and even to the entire page itself. Writing JavaScript is more complex than
writing HTML code, but not as difficult as writing in a programming language
such as C, C++, or Java. (No, Java and JavaScript are not the same. Read
Chapter 11 for more on Java applets and how they differ from JavaScript.)
Dreamweaver takes all the difficulty out of writing JavaScript behaviors by
giving you an easy and intuitive interface that doesn’t require you to ever
touch the complicated code behind the scenes.
Using the behaviors options, you can make images change when viewers pass
their cursors over them (a rollover), or make a layer draggable by the person
viewing the Web page. Combining the power of behaviors with layers opens
up a range of tricks that look great on a page and load quickly.
Consider this slightly corny example: If you tickle someone, that person
laughs. Dreamweaver would call the tickling an event and the laughter an
action. The combination is a Dreamweaver behavior. 
258
Part IV: Making It Cool 

You may already be familiar with the rollover behavior, when one image is
switched for another. In a rollover, putting your mouse over an image is the
event. The action is the switching of the original image for another. Rollovers
are especially common in navigation; mousing over a navigation button causes
it to be highlighted. You can use behaviors to affect text, images, and — you
guessed it — layers.
If you have always wanted to add cool interactive features, such as making
something flash or pop up when users move their cursors over an image or
click a link, you’re going to love the behavior feature in Dreamweaver. To fully
appreciate what Dreamweaver can do for you, you may want to switch to
Code view after attaching a behavior, just to see the complex code required
to create behaviors. If you don’t like what you see, don’t worry: Go back to
Design view and you can continue to let Dreamweaver take care of the code
for you (I just wanted you to see how lucky you are that Dreamweaver takes
care of all that for you).
When you use behaviors in Dreamweaver, you use dialog boxes to set up
interactive effects. You can attach behaviors to a page, a link, an image, or
almost any other element on a page by simply selecting the element and
choosing the behavior you want from the Behaviors tab in the Tag panel.
The following sections show you how to use behaviors to open a new window
or create a rollover. At least 20 behaviors are built into Dreamweaver so I
can’t cover all of them here, but after you see how to apply a couple of them,
you should have the idea of how to use the rest. After you have the idea,
spend a little time experimenting with behaviors so you get an idea of all the
cool things you can do with them.
Using a behavior to open 
a new browser window
You can use behaviors in Dreamweaver to create many interactive features,
such as opening a new browser window when someone clicks a link. This is a
great way to make supplemental information available without losing the
original page a visitor was viewing. Although the following steps provide
instructions for a specific behavior, you can use these steps to apply any
other behavior to a selected image or other element.
To add a behavior to a selected image (or any other element) on a page,
follow these steps:
1. Select an image on a page by clicking it.
You can select any image, text, or layer on a page and apply a behavior
to it the same way.
259
Chapter 9: Advanced HTML: CSS Layouts, DHTML, and Behaviors

To attach a behavior to the entire page, click the <BODY> tag in the tag
selector on the far-left side of the status bar, at the bottom of the
Document window.
2. Create a link for the image or text you are working with. 
Most actions, such as a browser opening or an image rollover, occur
because the user clicks or moves a mouse over the text or image that
triggers the event. For the user to know this is possible, be sure to make
the text or image a link, so that the user’s mouse cursor changes, giving
him the clue to click. 
Don’t worry if you don’t want the behavior to actually be a link that
opens a new Web page when clicked; you can “trick” the browser into
making the element appear to be a link:
• Type javascript:void(0); in the Link box in the Properties inspector
for the text, image, or layer you’re working with. This code makes
the element a link, but means that the browser doesn’t open a new
Web page when the link is clicked. This trick only works for users
who have not disabled Javascript in their browsers.
• Enter the number sign (#) in the Link box in the Properties inspector.
The browser reloads the same page instead of going to a new one. 
3. Choose Window➪Behaviors to open the Behaviors panel.
4. Click the plus sign (+) and choose the behavior you want from the
pop-up menu.
You can choose any behavior listed on the pop-up menu. In Figure 9-11, I
selected the Open Browser Window behavior.
A dialog box opens specific to that behavior where you can specify the
properties for the selected behavior. 
If a behavior is grayed out, that means it can’t be associated with the
element you have selected. For example, the Drag Layer behavior can
only be applied to a layer so it’s grayed out if you’ve selected an image
or text.
5. Specify the parameter options to control how you want the behavior
to work.
The Open Browser Window behavior creates an action so that when
someone clicks the image to which you applied this behavior, a new
browser window opens. This dialog box enables you to set the proper-
ties to specify how the new browser window displays. (For example, you
can restrict the size of the new browser window, like the one shown in
Figure 9-12.)
In the example shown in Figure 9-12, the URL to Display field is where
you enter the address of the page you want to open in the new browser
window. Setting a window width and height gives you the capability to
specify the size of the new window. You can also decide which attributes
that window should have. Check the box next to Navigation Toolbar,
260
Part IV: Making It Cool 

Location Toolbar, Status Bar, Menu Bar, Scrollbars As Needed, or Resize
Handles, if you want the new browser window to include any of these
features. Finally, you can name the new window, which is important if
you want to target that same window and load additional pages into it.
6. After you specify the parameters for the behavior, click OK.
The dialog box closes, and the new behavior now appears in the
Behaviors panel.

ling the

Chapter 9: Advanced HTML: CSS Layouts, DHTML, and Behaviors

7. To change the event that triggers your behavior, select the current
event from the left side of the Behaviors panel.
The Events drop-down list opens, from which you can select various
events to trigger the behavior.
The most commonly used event is the onClick event, which in this case
would cause the new browser window to open when a user clicks the
image. For more information about events and what each one accom-
plishes, see the section “Choosing the best event for a behavior” later in
this chapter.
8. To test the action, choose File➪Preview in Browser, and then select
the browser in which you want to test your work.
Whatever browser you choose opens the page so that you can see how
it really looks in that browser. Click the image to test whether a new
browser window opens (see Figure 9-13).
If you’re using behaviors, try to avoid starting your filenames with a number
or using a slash mark, which is never a good idea for a filename but is partic-
ularly problematic when applying behaviors (more so with JavaScript than
with Dreamweaver). Your safest option is to avoid using slashes anywhere in
the name or numbers at the beginning of a filename (you can use numbers
anywhere else in the name).

Part IV: Making It Cool 

Adding a rollover image behavior 
Rollover images are now some of the most commonly used interactive ele-
ments on Web sites. With rollovers, you can swap one image with another
when the mouse passes over it, giving users visible feedback as they interact
with your site. You have surely seen this effect used on Web site navigation
menus. Again, I include this example because it’s a common behavior, but
you can follow these same steps to apply many other behaviors in
Dreamweaver.
Because rollover images are so popular on the Internet, Dreamweaver includes
a special rollover option. To create a rollover using that feature, choose Insert➪
Image Objects➪Rollover Image and enter the names of the two images in the
dialog box. However, using the Behavior dialog box to create a rollover effect
gives you more options about how the rollover images display and what a
user must do to trigger the effect.
To create a rollover (swapping) image in Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
1. Click to place your cursor on the page where you want the rollover to
appear.
Rollover effects require at least two images: one for the initial state and
one for the rollover state. You probably should make a special set of
images to use with your rollover behavior. They both should be the
same dimensions, or else you get some strange scaling effects.
2. Choose Insert➪Image Objects➪Rollover Image to open the Insert
Rollover Image dialog box.
The Insert Rollover Image dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 9-14.
263
Chapter 9: Advanced HTML: CSS Layouts, DHTML, and Behaviors
Adding new behaviors to Dreamweaver
If you know how to write JavaScript, you can
add your own behaviors to the list of choices in
Dreamweaver. You can also find new behaviors
created by Macromedia and by other develop-
ers, many of which you can download for free
and then add to Dreamweaver. You can also
purchase a range of extensions. You can find
instructions for creating and adding new
actions in the Dreamweaver Exchange section
of the Macromedia site at www.macromedia.
com/exchange/dreamweaver.
To go to this site and try out new behaviors, click
the plus sign (+) in the Behaviors panel and
choose the Get More Behaviors option at 
the bottom of the pop-up menu. This action
launches your default Web browser and con-
nects you to the Dreamweaver Exchange sec-
tion of the Macromedia Web site if you’re online.

3. Name your image in the Image Name field of the dialog box.
For you to be able to apply a behavior to an element, such as an image,
the element must have a name so that the behavior script can reference
it. Names also enable you to swap images other than the one you’re
pointing at by using their names as a reference ID. The name can be the
same as the filename, but can also simply be descriptive.
4. Specify the first image you want visible in the Original Image text box.
(Use the Browse button to easily locate the image.)
5. Enter the image you want to have visible when visitors move their
cursors over the first image in the Rollover Image text box. (Use the
Browse button to easily locate the image.)
6. Check the Preload Rollover Image check box if you want the image to
load into the browser’s cache even before it becomes visible to a visitor.
If you don’t choose to do this step, the image is downloaded when a visi-
tor puts the mouse over the original image. This option should almost
always be turned on.
7. In the When Clicked, Go To URL section, enter a URL or browse to
locate another page on your site that you want to link to.
If you don’t specify a URL, Dreamweaver automatically inserts the #
(anchor tag reference).
8. Click OK.
The images are automatically set up as a rollover.
9. Click the globe icon at the top of the page to preview your work in a
browser where you can test to make sure that the rollover works.
Figure 9-14:

dialog box,

images.

Part IV: Making It Cool 

Choosing the best event for a behavior
Events, in interactive Web-speak, are things a user does as she interacts with
your Web page. Clicking an image is an event, as is loading a page in the
browser or pressing a key on the keyboard. You can probably think of many
more. Different browser versions support different events (the more recent the
browser version, the more events are available), and you can select the types
of browsers you want to support. To see the list of available behaviors for spe-
cific browsers, click the plus (+) sign in the Behaviors panel, choose Show
Events For, and select the type of browsers your users use. You should always
provide support for as many browsers and browser versions as possible.
Likewise, some events are available only for certain kinds of objects in your
page. This list describes some of the more commonly used events, ones that
the majority of Web users can experience (using Netscape Navigator and
Internet Explorer 4.0 and later):
 onAbort: Triggered when the user stops the browser from completely
loading an image (for example, when the user clicks the browser’s Stop
button while an image is loading).
 onBlur: Triggered when the specified element stops being the focus of
user interaction. For example, when a user clicks outside a text field
after clicking in the text field, the browser generates an onBlur event for
the text field. onBlur is the opposite of onFocus.
 onChange: Triggered when the user changes a value on the page, such
as choosing an option from a pop-up menu, or when the user changes
the value of a text field and then clicks elsewhere on the page.
 onClick: Triggered when the user clicks an element, such as a link,
button, or image.
 onDblClick: Triggered when the user double-clicks the specified element.
 onError: Triggered when a browser error occurs while a page or image
is loading. This event can be caused, for example, when an image or URL
can’t be found on the server.
 onFocus: Triggered when the specified element becomes the focus of
user interaction. For example, clicking in or tabbing to a text field of a
form generates an onFocus event.
 onKeyDown: Triggered as soon as the user presses any key on the key-
board. (The user doesn’t have to release the key for this event to be 
generated.)
265
Chapter 9: Advanced HTML: CSS Layouts, DHTML, and Behaviors

 onKeyPress: Triggered when the user presses and releases any key on
the keyboard; this event is like a combination of the onKeyDown and
onKeyUp events.
 onKeyUp: Triggered when the user releases a key on the keyboard after
pressing it.
 onLoad: Triggered when an image or the entire page finishes loading.
 onMouseDown: Triggered when the user presses the mouse button. (The
user doesn’t have to release the mouse button to generate this event.) 
 onMouseMove: Triggered when the user moves the mouse while pointing
to the specified element and the pointer doesn’t move away from the
element (stays within its boundaries).
 onMouseOut: Triggered when the pointer moves off the specified ele-
ment (usually a link).
 onMouseOver: Triggered when the mouse pointer moves over the speci-
fied element. Opposite of onMouseOut.
 onMouseUp: Triggered when a mouse button that has been pressed is
released.
 onMove: Triggered when a window or frame is moved.
 onReset: Triggered when a form is reset to its default values, usually by
clicking the Reset button.
 onResize: Triggered when the user resizes the browser window or a
frame.
 onScroll: Triggered when the user scrolls up or down in the browser.
 onSelect: Triggered when the user selects text in a text field by high-
lighting it with the cursor.
 onSubmit: Triggered when the user submits a form, usually by clicking
the Submit button.
 onUnload: Triggered when the user leaves the page, either by clicking to
another page or by closing the browser window.
Attaching multiple behaviors
You can attach multiple behaviors to the same element on a page (as long as
they don’t conflict, of course). For example, you can attach one action that is
triggered when users click an image and another when they move their cur-
sors over the image. You can also trigger the same action by using multiple
events. For example, you can play the same sound when a user triggers any
number of events. 
266
Part IV: Making It Cool 

To attach additional behaviors to an element, click the plus sign again in the
Behaviors panel and select another option from the pop-up menu. Repeat
this process as many times as you want.
Editing a behavior
You can always go back and edit a behavior after you create it. You can
choose a different event to trigger the behavior, choose a different action, or
remove behaviors. You can also change parameters you have specified.
To edit a behavior, follow these steps:
1. Select an object with a behavior attached.
2. Choose Window➪Behaviors to open the Behaviors panel.
Here are some options you can choose in the Behaviors panel:
• Change a triggering event: Choose a different event from the
Events drop-down list in the Behaviors panel.
• Remove a behavior: Click the action in the Behaviors panel to
select it and then click the minus sign at the top of the pane. The
behavior disappears.
• Change parameters for an action: Double-click the gear icon next to
the action and change the parameters in the dialog box that opens.
• Change the order of actions when multiple actions are set: Select
an action and then click the Move Event Value Up or Move Event
Value Down buttons to move it to a different position in the list of
actions.
Ensuring That Your Pages 
Work in Older Browsers
You may love all the Dreamweaver features described in this chapter because
they make creating dynamic, interactive elements for your Web pages easy.
However, don’t forget that older browsers may have trouble handling some of
the more advanced features you can create. As each day passes, older browsers
are less of an issue because fewer people are using them, although browser
support is certainly still a problem. Even newer browsers don’t support all
DHTML in quite the same way.
267
Chapter 9: Advanced HTML: CSS Layouts, DHTML, and Behaviors

Figuring out which browser to target when you start working with behaviors
can be frustrating. One solution (besides not using behaviors) is creating two
versions of pages that use behaviors and adding a Check Browser behavior
that can redirect visitors to the page that works best for them.
The Check Browser action is implemented from the Behaviors panel. This
action automatically sends users to different URLs depending on the version
of browsers they’re using, so you can create a fancy version of your site for
new browsers and a simpler version for older browsers. Because this action
even allows you to send Netscape and Internet Explorer users to different URLs,
you can design different pages for each browser’s capabilities, as shown in
Figure 9-15. Here’s the best way to use this action: Select the <BODY> tag by
using the HTML tag selector on the document’s status bar, and then choose
the Check Browser action in the Behaviors panel (click the plus sign to
access the list of actions).
Applying this behavior to your page causes a browser-detect script to deter-
mine the type of browser your visitor uses when the page first loads. After
the page loads, the visitor is either directed to a different URL based on that
detection or kept on the same page. For example, you can send all visitors
using Netscape 4.0 and older to one page in your site and users of Internet
Explorer 5.0 to another page. To ensure that users of the oldest browsers see
the simple page rather than try to interpret fancy code, you should insert this
behavior in the basic version of the page and then redirect newer browsers to
the alternative fancy pages. The only problem with this solution, of course, is
that you have to create more than one site — one for older browsers and one
or more for the newer browsers — and that can turn into lots more work. 
If you have an audience that is using some of the less common browsers —
like Safari or Opera — this solution may not work for you. Remember that
testing your pages in the browser you think your site’s visitors use is the only
way to be sure you create pages that work for them.

Part IV: Making It Cool 

Using Extensions and the 
Extension Manager
Extensions let you easily add new features to Dreamweaver by simply down-
loading them from a Web site or creating your own new extensions, which
you can share with others. Extensions are similar to behaviors except that
they’re even more powerful.
For example, you can use extensions to add a list of all the state zip codes or
country codes to your page, instantly embed QuickTime movies and other mul-
timedia files, or connect to back-end databases with a simple menu command.
The idea behind extensions is that anyone with a little bit of scripting ability
can create new ways to customize Dreamweaver and share his creations with
the Dreamweaver community. The place to find out more about extensions 
and to download them (mostly for free) is the Macromedia Exchange for
Dreamweaver site at www.macromedia.com/exchange/dreamweaver.
After you log into Macromedia Exchange (membership is free), you’re wel-
come to download and install any of the scores of extensions — their number
grows every day as developers continually create new ones. You can search
for extensions by category or simply browse the ever-growing list.
To install an extension, download it first from the Macromedia Exchange site
or any other source (many sites now have free extensions on the Web) and
then use the Extension Manager, a utility included in Dreamweaver, to install
the new extension. Extensions you download from the site are saved as files
on your computer with an .mxp extension. The Extension Manager makes
installing and removing these files in Dreamweaver a breeze.
269
Chapter 9: Advanced HTML: CSS Layouts, DHTML, and Behaviors
Extending Dreamweaver with 
the Extension Manager
One of the reasons Dreamweaver is so popular
is because you can customize the program so
extensively using the Extension Manager.
Dreamweaver has hooks throughout the pro-
gram where you can add your own extensions.
You can download a wide array of extensions
from www.Macromedia.com and many others
created by third-party developers.
Search the Web and you can find extensions for
blogging, for photo galleries, for obscure pro-
gramming languages, for Flickr.com, and more.
You also find slideshow behaviors and tem-
plates for all manner of sites.

To run the Extension Manager and install an extension, follow these steps:
1. Choose Help➪Manage Extensions.
The utility launches.
2. Choose File➪Install Extension in the Extension Manager; then browse
your drive to select the new extension.
After the installation is complete, you see brief instructions on how to
use the extension.
3. Unless the instructions require you to restart Dreamweaver, simply
switch to Dreamweaver, and you’re ready to use your new extension.
Converting to XHTML and Beyond
The Dreamweaver Convert feature enables you to convert an HTML page into
one of several flavors of XHTML, as well as some variations on the HTML
standard. The eXtensible Markup Language is increasingly important on the
Web, and if you work with XML, you may appreciate that Dreamweaver is
supporting XML development.
XML isn’t a markup language — it’s a meta-markup language you can use to
store and organize data so that you can tailor it to meet a broad range of
needs. XML is a subset of SGML, but it retains much more of the power of
SGML than HTML did, while still being streamlined enough to be efficient on
the Web. Because XML doesn’t have a fixed set of tags and elements, XML
enables developers to define the elements they need and apply those ele-
ments where they need them. That’s what the X in XML is all about: It’s
eXtensible. You can adapt it to fit your content, whether you’re a stockbroker,
publisher, or astronomer.
XML is built on a solid foundation of rules and standards, and it’s officially
endorsed by the W3C (World Wide Consortium — the Internet police), so it
has the potential to solve many of the problems caused by conflicting stan-
dards in other formatting options now available. The rules dictate such cru-
cial issues as where tags appear, which names are legal, and which attributes
can be attached to which elements. These strict standards make it possible
to develop XML parsers that can handle any XML document without limiting
the ultimate flexibility of the kind of content or how it’s displayed. The XML
standards also feature rules for syntax and link checking, comparing docu-
ment models, and datatyping, as well as checking to see whether a document
is well formed and valid. And, XML uses Unicode as its standard character
set, so it supports the broadest range of languages, special characters, and
symbols, including Arabic, Chinese, and Russian.
270
Part IV: Making It Cool 

One of the most significant differences between XHTML and HTML is that
XHTML can be used to describe the type of content, and not just focus on spe-
cific formatting for a Web browser. That enables content to be stored and
shared in a way that makes publishing in multiple formatting styles easy. For
example, rather than describe a headline as font size 5, Helvetica, bold, you
can simply describe the headline as a headline. XML then allows you to apply
a style sheet (or multiple style sheets) to that content so that the headline and
body can be formatted on the fly. You do this with Cascading Style Sheets and
the XML Extensible Style Sheets. The separation of the formatting from the
content description is what enables the same content to be sent efficiently to
a wide range of partners, each of whom can apply its own formatting or to a
broad range of viewing devices, such as Web browsers, handheld devices, and
cell phones, which require different formatting.
If you want to know more about XML, consider reading XML For Dummies, 4th
Edition, by Ed Tittel (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
If you are coding for a particular level of XML- or HTML-compliance, you can
set Dreamweaver to create every new document in that format by setting the
New Document preferences. Choose Edit➪Preferences and look for the New
Document category.

Roundtrip Integration: Fireworks
and Dreamweaver
In This Chapter
 Fireworks as an image-editing program
 Using other image editors besides Fireworks
 Optimizing graphics without leaving Dreamweaver
 Inserting and editing Fireworks HTML
I
n this chapter, you discover some of the special features that make
Dreamweaver work so well with Fireworks, the Macromedia image-creation
and -editing program. Fireworks, specially designed for developing images for
the Web, is a great complement to Dreamweaver. Much of the information in
this chapter also applies, however, to other image-editing programs, such as
Adobe Photoshop.
If you don’t have Fireworks, you can download the free, 30-day trial from
www.macromedia.com/fireworks/. Because Dreamweaver offers very lim-
ited graphics capabilities, you need Fireworks (or programs like it — see the
list of options in Chapter 5) to create images from scratch or to edit existing
images and prepare them for use on the Web.
Fireworks was one of the first image-editing programs designed specifically
for the special needs of the Web, and it’s ideally suited to creating images for
use on the Internet. Using Fireworks, you can automate your workflow, opti-
mize graphics (compress and prepare them for Web use), and create sophisti-
cated animations, fancy rollovers (images that change when you hover the
mouse pointer over them), and special effects in a fraction of the time these
tasks used to take. Fireworks can even generate HTML and create Web pages
all by itself! More important for you, Fireworks integrates especially well with
Dreamweaver, enabling roundtrip graphics editing back and forth between
the two programs. Normally, when you work with Dreamweaver and another

graphics editor, it takes many steps between creating images and getting
them into a Web page — one of the most time-consuming parts of building
and maintaining a Web site. Roundtrip graphics editing gives you lots of short-
cuts, making the trips back and forth between the two programs much
quicker and easier.
Dreamweaver to Fireworks: 
Image Editing
Suppose that a client suddenly wants the logo on a Web page to be a different
color. Normally, you have to launch an image-editing program, track down the
logo, open it, edit it, save it, switch back to Dreamweaver, and then import
the logo again to your page. Using the special integration features between
Dreamweaver and Fireworks, though, greatly simplifies the entire process —
a few clicks of the mouse can replace all those other time-consuming tasks.
This section show you how to select an image in Dreamweaver, automatically
open the image in Fireworks, edit the image, and update it back in Dreamweaver
with just a few mouse clicks.
To launch Fireworks directly from Dreamweaver and edit an existing image,
follow these steps:
1. In an open document, select a GIF or JPEG image you want to edit.
2. In the Properties inspector, click the Edit in Fireworks button, as
shown in Figure 10-1.
The Find Source dialog box appears, asking whether you want to use an
existing document as the source of the file you selected.
Figure 10-1:
The
Properties
inspector
displays an

button (look

when you
select an

274
Part IV: Making It Cool 

3. Click one of the options in the Find Source dialog box:
Yes: Select a different file from the optimized image file on your
page. For example, you can select the original file from which you
exported the optimized Web version of the graphical image on
your page. It may be a PNG file or a Photoshop file, for example.
(For more on PNG files, see the “PNG: Portable Network Graphics
files” sidebar, later in this chapter.)
No: Opens the GIF or JPEG that you selected in Dreamweaver and
are using on the Web page.
Because the GIF or JPEG image used on your Web page was probably
optimized earlier for Web use, editing it again often degrades the image
quality. Going back to the original, pre-optimized version of the graphi-
cal image gives you the option to start again from scratch. Keep in mind
that each time a GIF or JPEG is saved, it gets compressed and loses some
data and quality. If you need to make an additional edit, using the original
image and saving a new GIF or JPEG produces a better-looking file.
After clicking the Yes or No button, the image document opens in
Fireworks.
4. Make the edits you need to make to the image within Fireworks.
You can edit the image by using any of the tools in Fireworks, or change
the optimization settings for the file in the Optimize panel.
5. When you finish editing the image, click the Done button in the upper-
left corner of the Fireworks Document window (see Figure 10-2).

275
Chapter 10: Roundtrip Integration: Fireworks and Dreamweaver

Dreamweaver becomes the active window and the image automatically
updates on the page, reflecting recent edits without requiring any other
action on your part, other than saving the document.
After you click the Done button in Fireworks, you can’t undo any
changes you make to the image files by choosing the Undo command.
The changes are permanent.
Using an Image Editor 
Other Than Fireworks
When you click the Edit in Fireworks button in the Properties inspector (see
Step 2 in the preceding section), Dreamweaver tries to launch Fireworks as
its default editing application. But what if you don’t use Fireworks or don’t
own a copy? Fear not: You can achieve a somewhat less-automated workflow
with almost any other graphics editor. You just need to change your prefer-
ences in Dreamweaver to specify which program you prefer to use instead of
Fireworks.

PNG: Portable Network Graphics files
Fireworks uses the PNG (Portable Network
Graphics) format as its native file format. PNG
is similar to the PSD format, used by Adobe
Photoshop, in that it retains the highest possi-
ble quality for the graphical image without suf-
fering any of the degradation in image quality
that usually occurs with a GIF or JPEG. The
Portable Network Graphics format was created
long before Fireworks. The PNG format is one of
the few formats, in addition to GIF and JPEG,
that a Web browser can display. Because the
PNG format allows for the many extra features
that Fireworks offers, Macromedia chose it as
the native format for Fireworks.
The PNG file format was originally created as 
a potential replacement for the GIF format
because PNGs offered far greater image qual-
ity, compression levels, and numerous other
features lacking in GIFs. PNG files offer a multi-
tude of improvements over GIFs, including res-
olution up to 48 bits (as opposed to 8 bits in GIF),
better compression, built-in gamma correction
(the capability to adjust to the different bright-
ness levels between PC and Mac monitors), and
greater levels of transparency.
So, why are we all still using the GIF format?
Although PNG files represent a marked
improvement over GIF files, many of its most
useful features simply aren’t well supported by
some browsers.
For more information about PNG files, take a
look at the PNG home page at www.libpng.
org/pub/png/ or the W3C PNG page at
www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG.

To designate a different application as the Dreamweaver external image
editor, follow these steps:
1. On the Dreamweaver menu bar, choose Edit➪Preferences (Windows)
or Dreamweaver➪Preferences (Mac) and select the File Types/Editors
category.
The Preferences dialog box for File Types/Editors appears, as shown in
Figure 10-3.
2. Select an image format from the Extensions list.
For each file format, you can specify one or more external editors, in
addition to a primary editor.
3. In the Editors list on the right, click the plus sign (+) to add an editor
for all your image files in the specified format.
The Select External Editor dialog box appears, asking you to find the
program to assign as the editor for this file type.
4. Browse your drive until you locate the graphics application you want
to assign; then click the Open button.
After you click the Open button, the application appears in the list of
image editors on the right.
5. Click the Make Primary button to make it your primary editor. 
You can add as many editors to the list as you want, but you can assign
only one primary editor for each file type.

277
Chapter 10: Roundtrip Integration: Fireworks and Dreamweaver

6. Repeat Steps 2 through 5 for any other graphics extensions you want
to assign to other graphics editors.
7. Click OK.
Clicking the Edit button opens the assigned application. You can also select
an alternative image-editing application when you right-click the image and
open the Edit With menu.
Although you can use graphics applications other than Fireworks, none
except Fireworks includes the Done button, which updates the image in
Dreamweaver. If you use another application, you need to save the edited
graphical image and import the image into Dreamweaver again manually.
Dreamweaver to Fireworks: 
Optimizing an Image
Suppose that the logo on your page looks fine, but is taking too long to 
download and needs to be compressed a bit more. The latest version of
Dreamweaver puts immediate access to the Fireworks Optimize dialog box
in the Properties inspector.
To optimize an image in Fireworks from within Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
1. Select the image in Dreamweaver.
2. Click the Optimize in Fireworks button in the Properties inspector
(see Figure 10-4).
278
Part IV: Making It Cool 
Adobe Photoshop and ImageReady
Although Fireworks does the whole roundtrip
thing with Dreamweaver and using Fireworks
rather than another image editor makes more
sense, many Web designers use Adobe
Photoshop and its integrated Web application,
Adobe ImageReady.
Because Photoshop and ImageReady can do
many of the same functions as Fireworks (image
slicing, optimization, rollovers, and animation),
many designers reason: “Why spend time find-
ing out how to use a new program and figuring
out how to do what I already know how to do
(and perhaps, do well) in another program?”
Seamless integration with Dreamweaver is cer-
tainly a big benefit, and Fireworks is less expen-
sive than Photoshop. However, both are
excellent programs, and the choice is up to you.

The Find Source dialog box appears, asking whether you want to use an
existing document as the source of the file you selected.
The default setting for this command is for Dreamweaver to ask about
source files each time you launch Fireworks. You can change this setting
by choosing Always Use Source PNG or Never Use Source PNG from the
Fireworks Source Files drop-down list in the same dialog box.
3. Click the Yes or No button in the Find Source dialog box:
Yes: Allows you to select a different file from the optimized image
file on your page, such as the original file from which you exported
the optimized Web version of the graphical image used on your page.
No: Opens the file used on your Web page and displays the opti-
mization dialog box within Fireworks.
Whichever option you click, the image opens in the Fireworks Optimize
dialog box.
4. Apply new optimization settings on the Options tab of the Fireworks
Optimize dialog box (see Figure 10-5).
You can change the number of colors in the file or change its quality set-
tings to achieve a smaller file size and then preview the changes within
the Fireworks preview panel. You can also crop the image, but you can’t
make any other image edits in this window.
5. Click the Update button.
The file automatically updates in Dreamweaver with the changes you
just applied. If you selected a PNG file to edit (you clicked the Yes button
in the Find Source dialog box), the original PNG file isn’t altered — only
the optimized GIF or JPEG file is. If you cropped your image first, click
the Reset Size button.
After you click the Update button in Fireworks, you cannot undo any
changes you make to the image files by choosing the Undo command.
The changes are permanent.
Figure 10-4:

279
Chapter 10: Roundtrip Integration: Fireworks and Dreamweaver

The coolest Fireworks optimization feature by far has to be the Optimize to
Size Wizard. Click the button with a vise icon on it at the bottom of the
Options tab and type the target file size. Then the wizard tries to compress
the file enough to achieve the size you specify; the image usually suffers a
decrease in quality or in the number of colors used. Although the settings
usually require a bit more tweaking after you run this command, the wizard
does a great job of doing the groundwork.
Inserting Fireworks HTML
One of the niftiest Fireworks features is that you can automatically generate
HTML files when you’re cutting up images for your Web designs. This feature
works well for slicing large graphics into pieces and generating tables to hold
the pieces together. For example, you can use Fireworks to create a navigation
bar, and then slice that bar to create a separate graphic for each navigation
item. The only question is, after you generate this HTML code from Fireworks,
how do you get it to your Dreamweaver page? Because Fireworks generates an
HTML page, you can simply open that page in Dreamweaver, of course. But if
you want to put that HTML directly into an existing Web page, you can easily
insert the HTML and its associated images with just the click of a button.
To insert a Fireworks-generated table with sliced images into a Dreamweaver
document, follow these steps (I assume in this example that you know how to
Figure 10-5:

use Fireworks to slice up images and generate HTML tables and that you
have already exported an HTML file from within Fireworks):
1. With a document open and the cursor placed at the point where you
want to place the HTML, choose Insert➪Image Objects➪Fireworks HTML.
The Insert Fireworks HTML dialog box appears (see Figure 10-6).
2. Click the Browse button to select the HTML file to import; click OK
when you locate it.
Dreamweaver inserts the table and its associated images from the
Fireworks document into Dreamweaver (see Figure 10-7).

Editing Fireworks HTML
After you insert Fireworks HTML into Dreamweaver, some special options
become available in the Properties inspector, allowing you to easily edit the
images and their associated code in Fireworks. If you refer to Figure 10-7, you
see that the Properties inspector adds a few items that appear only when you
insert a Fireworks HTML table. One item is an indicator of the source PNG file
for the images, and the other is an Edit button, which lets you edit the table
in Fireworks.
To edit an existing Fireworks table in Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
1. Select the table in the Dreamweaver document.
Fireworks-generated HTML imported into Dreamweaver becomes an
object with special attributes that display in the Properties inspector
when you select the object (refer to Figure 10-7).
2. Click the Edit in Fireworks button in the Properties inspector to
launch Fireworks.
You’re asked to find the original PNG file corresponding to the inserted
HTML and images if Fireworks can’t find it automatically. After you
locate the PNG file, the image appears within a Fireworks Document
window.
3. Make any edits or adjustments to the Fireworks document.
4. Click the Done button in the upper-left corner of the Fireworks
Document window (see Figure 10-8).
The HTML code and graphics regenerate and automatically update in

Showing Off with Multimedia
In This Chapter
 Understanding multimedia
 Creating Flash buttons and text within Dreamweaver
 Adding Flash movie files
 Working with sound and video files
 Getting familiar with Java and ActiveX controls
 Using other multimedia file types
N
ow that more than 30 percent of Internet users have DSL lines, cable
modems, or even faster connections, multimedia has become an impor-
tant part of many Web sites. Those of us who have become spoiled with
CD-ROMs and music videos are often less than satisfied with flat, text-based
Web sites. 
Not all Web sites warrant multimedia; if your goal is to provide information in
the fastest way possible to the broadest audience, text is still the best option.
But if you want to provide a richer experience for your users, to show rather
than just tell, or to entertain as well as inform, adding sound, video, and ani-
mation is the way to go. 
Although you can’t use Dreamweaver to create audio or video files, in this
chapter you find out how to use Dreamweaver to add a wide range of multi-
media file types to your Web pages so your visitors can view them. I also
include a primer of the various kinds of multimedia options.
The most complicated aspects of working with multimedia on the Web are
choosing the best format and editing multimedia files in sound, video, or
other multimedia-editing programs. As you see in this chapter, adding multi-
media files to your pages once they’re created is relatively easy (similar to
adding image files or creating links, but with more options controlling how
and when they play).

Understanding Multimedia Players
When you add sound, video, or any other kind of multimedia to a Web site,
you should know that your visitors may need a special player (sometimes
with an associated plug-in) to play or view your files.
Players are small programs that work alone or in cooperation with a Web
browser to add support for non-browser functions, such as playing sound,
video, and animation files. Some of these programs come with plug-ins, which
are small applications that can plug into a browser and extend its capabilities.
Some of the best-known multimedia players and plug-ins include the Flash
Player, Windows Media Player, Real Networks RealPlayer, and Apple
QuickTime. Some have become so popular that they are built into the latest
browsers or operating systems. 
The problem is that if your visitors don’t have the player required to view
your multimedia file, they have to download and install it; otherwise they see
some sort of broken icon that represents the content on your site and not
your cool multimedia file. Many visitors are scared off by the idea of down-
loading something new off the Internet, others are just plain annoyed by the
requirement, and some really can’t do it at all (for example, many companies
make it impossible for employees to download and install software for secu-
rity reasons). 
286
Part IV: Making It Cool 
Creating warnings for multimedia files
Because multimedia files require special play-
ers, it’s a good idea to include a warning mes-
sage any time you add video, audio, or other
multimedia files to your Web site. The message
should include an explanation of the type of file
you’re using, the size of the file, how long it may
take to download, and what kind of player is
required to view it.
You may want to include a warning, such as one
of the following examples, with a video file:
To play this video file, click the above image.
The video clip is 30 seconds long and shows
our cool widget in action. If you’re using a
modem connection, the video may take a
minute or two to download and play. If the
video does not appear to be playing or if you
receive an error message, you may not have
the necessary software to play the video.
To play this 30-second video file, click the
image. Using a modem, the video takes
about 90 seconds to download. If the video
does not play, you may need to install
Windows Media Player, free for Macintosh
and Windows.

You can use Dreamweaver to place any of these multimedia file types in your
Web pages, but it’s up to you to choose the format that’s best for your audience.
You can find literally hundreds of plug-ins available for Web pages. Some have
become very common, such as those used for playing sound and video.
Others are more obscure, such as specialized plug-ins that display three-
dimensional worlds and 360-degree images. 
Don’t risk losing your viewers unless you have a compelling reason. You
should never make your visitors download a special plug-in just to see your
logo spinning around, for example. Unless you’re offering something of value,
such as an interactive game or a three-dimensional map for example, you
probably should avoid any multimedia options that require special plug-ins. 
Working with Macromedia Flash 
Flash has clearly emerged as the favorite technology for creating animations
and a wide variety of interactive features on the Web. You can even integrate
sound and video into Flash, making it a common choice for combining formats.
One of the things that makes Flash so popular, so flexible, and so fast on the
Internet, is that it uses vector graphics. That means the graphics in Flash are
based on mathematical descriptions instead of thousands of dots, and those
equations take up far less space than bitmapped animations do. And, because
vector graphics provide a description of something instead of a physical 
representation, they can be scaled up or down in size without affecting the
image quality or the size of the file that’s downloaded. This capability to
scale makes Flash ideally suited for the many different monitor sizes used by
Web viewers, as well as the tiny displays on cell phones and other hand-held
devices. You can even project Flash graphics on a wall or movie screen with-
out losing quality, although any photographs or video files integrated into a
Flash file may lose quality at higher resolutions.
Flash files use the file extension .swf, and you can insert them into any Web
page. In the following sections you find out more about adding Flash files,
buttons, and text to your Web site. If want to know how to create Flash files,
check out Macromedia Flash 8 For Dummies, by Gurdy Leete and Ellen
Finkelstein (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
On the downside, Flash may or may not print as you would hope and may
cause accessibility problems for the disabled. It’s also usually more work to
update, and may not be read by search engines as they crawl your site. But if
you’ve got the talent, the time, and the staff, it’s definitely one of the coolest
ways to build a Web site.
287
Chapter 11: Showing Off with Multimedia

Adding Flash Buttons and 
Text with Dreamweaver
Dreamweaver features the capability to create and edit simple Flash files
from within Dreamweaver and includes predesigned Flash options you can
add to your pages, even if you don’t have Macromedia Flash. Though you
can’t create complex Flash animations with Dreamweaver, these built-in fea-
tures enable you to create graphical text objects and cool Flash buttons.
Dreamweaver has a large library of existing Flash objects that you can use.
Even better, because the Macromedia Flash Objects architecture is extensi-
ble, you can download new Flash styles from the Macromedia Exchange Web
site by clicking the Get More Styles button in the Insert Flash Button dialog
box. Clicking this button launches your Web browser and connects you to the
Macromedia Exchange site, where you can download more buttons (you
must have a live Internet connection). See Chapter 15 for more details on
Macromedia Exchange.
Creating Flash text with Dreamweaver
With the Flash text object, you can create and insert a Flash (.swf) text movie
into your document. Flash text movies enable you to utilize a vector-based
text graphic in the font of your choice. (Vector-based means that the images
are made up of coded instructions to draw specific geometric shapes.) The
great advantage to using Flash text is that you can use any fonts you want
without worrying about whether your audience have the same fonts on their
computers. You can also set a rollover effect without the need to create sepa-
rate images, and the size of the text can scale up or down without any effect
on image quality or file size.
To insert a Flash text object, follow these steps:
1. Open any existing page in Dreamweaver, or create and save a new
document.
You must save the document before inserting a Flash text object.
2. Select Common from the Insert bar, if it isn’t already selected.
3. From the Media drop-down list on the Common Insert bar, choose
Flash Text, as shown in Figure 11-1.
Or you can choose Insert➪Media➪Flash Text.
The Insert Flash Text dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-2.

4. Select the options, including font, style, size, color, alignment, and
background color:
• Font and Font size: Select any font you have available on your hard
drive and specify the size in which you want it to display. The size
of the font determines the size of the box around the Flash text. To
see the text previewed in your font of choice, check the Show Font
box. Use the formatting options below the Font box to specify the
alignment of the text and if it should display in bold or italic.
• Color: This option indicates the color of the text.
• Rollover Color: This option indicates the color that the text
changes to when the user rolls the mouse over the text. 
• Link, Target: Use the Link box to specify the page or file that opens
when the viewer clicks the link, and Target to specify where the
linked page opens.
• Bg Color (background color): If you make this option the same as
the background color of the Web page on which you’re placing the
text, the text appears to float on the page. If you specify a different
color, a box appears around the text filled with this color. If you
don’t specify a color, the background is white, not transparent.
• Save As: Because you’re creating a Flash file when you use this
option, you need to name the new file. Always save the file with the
.swf extension. Use the Browse button (the small folder icon) to
specify where you want to save the Flash file on your hard drive.
5. Click OK.
You can also click the Apply button to preview the Flash text in your
Dreamweaver document before clicking OK.
The dialog box closes and the Flash text is inserted on the page. To edit
the text again or change any of the options, double-click the Flash text to
open the dialog box.
Creating Flash buttons with Dreamweaver
Even more exciting than Flash text are Flash buttons. Flash buttons are pre-
designed graphics that you can customize and use as interactive buttons on
your Web sites. Like Flash text, Flash buttons are made up of vector graphics,
and you can scale and resize them without any degradation in quality. 
To insert a Flash button, follow these steps:
290
Part IV: Making It Cool 

1. Open any existing page in Dreamweaver, or create and save a new
document.
You must save the document before inserting a Flash button.
2. Select Common from the Insert bar, if it isn’t already selected.
3. From the Media drop-down list on the Common Insert bar, choose
Flash Button.
Or choose Insert➪Media➪Flash Button.
The Insert Flash Button dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 11-3.
4. In the Style field, scroll to select the type of button you want to use.
The selected button displays in the Sample field at the top of the 
dialog box.
5. Customize your button by entering the text you want to display on the
button, selecting a font, and so on.
Enter the text you want to use in the Button Text field or leave it blank if
you don’t want any text on the button. Select the other text options,
including font, style, size, color, and alignment.
Select the link, target, and background colors in the appropriate fields, if
you want the button to serve as a link.

291
Chapter 11: Showing Off with Multimedia

Because you are creating a Flash file when you use this option, you need
to name the new file. Always save the file with the .swf extension. Use
the Browse button (the small folder icon) to specify where you want to
save the Flash file on your hard drive.
6. When you’re done setting the options, click OK to insert the button.
You can also click the Apply button to preview the button in your
Dreamweaver document before clicking OK.
The dialog box closes, and the button is inserted on the page. To edit
the button again or change any of the options, double-click the button to
open the dialog box.
Preview the button in a browser to see any rollover effects built into the
Flash file, or select it and click Play in the Properties inspector.
Inserting Flash files
Flash files, often called Flash movies even when they don’t include video, are
also easy to insert into a Web page using Dreamweaver, but you need a pro-
gram such as Macromedia Flash to create them first. In this section, I assume
you have a completed Flash file (an animation or other Flash movie), and you
want to add it to your Web page.
Because Macromedia released the Flash file format as an open standard, you
can create Flash files with a variety of vector-editing programs, including
Adobe Illustrator, which has an Export to SWF option. 
You link to a Flash file much as you do an image, but because Flash can do so
much more than a still image, you have a variety of settings and options to
control how your Flash file plays. 
Before you start, make sure to save the Flash file you want to insert in the
main folder for your Web site. I recommend creating a multimedia folder in
your main Web site folder for audio and other multimedia files, just as most
designers create an image folder for image files.
To add a Flash file to a Web site, open an existing page, or create a new docu-
ment and save the file, and then follow these steps:
1. Click to insert the cursor where you want the Flash file to display on
your Web page.
2. Select Common from the Insert bar, if it isn’t already selected.
3. From the Media drop-down list on the Common Insert bar, choose Flash.
You can also choose Insert➪Media➪Flash. 
The Select File dialog box appears.
292
Part IV: Making It Cool 

4. Browse your drive to locate the Flash file that you want to insert in
your page. Click to select the file.
5. Click OK.
After you click OK, the dialog box closes and the code is inserted into
your document.
Dreamweaver displays Flash as a gray box the size of the Flash file. To play
the file, click to select it and then click the green Play button on the right side
of the Properties inspector (shown in the upcoming Figure 11-4). Your Flash
file should also play when you preview the page in a browser.
Setting options for Flash
Like most HTML tags, the tags that link Flash and other multimedia files to
Web pages have attributes, which define how a file plays within a browser,
controlling such actions as whether an animation plays automatically when a
page is loaded or if a visitor must click a link for the animation to begin.
Dreamweaver automatically sets some of these options, such as the height
and width of the Flash file, and you may want to specify some of the others. 
If you don’t see all the options in the Properties inspector, click the expander
arrow in the lower-right corner to display the more advanced options.
You can set these Flash options in the Properties inspector, shown in 
Figure 11-4:
 Name field: Use the text field in the upper-left corner of the Properties
inspector, just to the right of the F icon, if you want to type a name for
your file. You can leave this field blank or name the file whatever you
want. Dreamweaver doesn’t apply a name if you leave the field blank.
You only have to provide a name for scripting.
 W (Width): Use this option to specify the width of the file. The file is
measured in pixels.
 H (Height): Use this option to specify the height of the file. The file is
measured in pixels.
 File: Dreamweaver automatically fills in this field when you insert a
Flash file with the filename and path. You risk breaking the link to your
flash file if you alter this field.
 Edit: Click this button to open a Flash file with the Macromedia Flash
program, where you can edit it. Note that you can only edit the source
Flash file. After saving Flash files for Web use with the .swf extension,
you can’t edit them again.
 Src (Source): This text field enables you to identify the source file you
used to create the .swf file inserted into a page. After this option is set,
293
Chapter 11: Showing Off with Multimedia

clicking the Edit button automatically opens the source file in Flash and
provides a Done button to integrate changes back into Dreamweaver.
Because the programs are integrated, any changes you make in Flash
automatically reflect in Dreamweaver when you use this option.
 Reset Size: You can change the display size of a Flash file by clicking a
corner and dragging it. Clicking this button reverts the Flash file to its
original size. Unlike images, video, and many other file types, you can
resize Flash files without affecting image quality or proportion because
they are vector based.
 Class: Use the drop-down list to apply any style sheets defined for the
document. 
 Loop: Checking this box causes the Flash file to repeat (or loop). If you
don’t check this box, the Flash movie stops after it reaches the last frame.
 Autoplay: Checking this box causes the Flash movie to play as soon as it
downloads to the viewer’s computer. If you don’t check this box, what-
ever option you have set within the Flash file itself (such as onMouseOver
or onMouseDown) is required to start the movie. You can also apply a
behavior elsewhere in the document to start play (Chapter 9 covers
Dreamweaver behaviors).
 V Space (Vertical Space): If you want blank space above or below the
file, enter the number of pixels.
 H Space (Horizontal Space): If you want blank space on either side of
the file, enter the number of pixels.
 Quality: This option enables you to prioritize the anti-aliasing options of
your images versus the speed of playback. Anti-aliasing, which makes
your files appear smoother, can slow down the rendering of each frame
because the computer must first smooth the edges. The Quality parame-
ter enables you to regulate how much the process is slowed down by let-
ting you set priorities based on the importance of appearance versus
playback speed.
You can choose from these Quality options:
• Low: Anti-aliasing is never used. Playback speed has priority over
appearance.
• High: Anti-aliasing is always used. Appearance has priority over
playback speed.
• Auto High: With this somewhat more sophisticated option, playback
is set to begin with anti-aliasing turned on. However, if the frame rate
supported by the user’s computer drops too low, anti-aliasing auto-
matically turns off to improve playback speed. This option empha-
sizes playback speed and appearance equally at first but sacrifices
appearance for the sake of playback speed, if necessary.
• Auto Low: Playback begins with anti-aliasing turned off. If the Flash
player detects that the processor can handle it, anti-aliasing is
294
Part IV: Making It Cool 

turned on. Use this option to emphasize speed at first but improve
appearance whenever possible.
 Scale: Specify this option only if you change the file’s original Height and
Width size settings. The Scale parameter enables you to define how the
Flash movie displays within those settings.
The following options in the Scale drop-down list enable you to set pref-
erences for how a scaled Flash movie displays within the window:
• Default (Show All): This option enables the entire movie to display
in the specified area. The width and height proportions of the origi-
nal movie are maintained and no distortion occurs, but borders
may appear on two sides of the movie to fill the space.
• No Border: This option enables you to scale a Flash movie to fill a
specified area. No borders show up, and the original aspect ratio is
maintained, but some cropping may occur.
• Exact Fit: The Flash movie is exactly the width and height that are
set, but the original aspect ratio may not be maintained, and the
movie may look squished.
 Align: This option controls the alignment of the file on the page. This
setting works the same for plug-in files as for images.

Working with Video on the Web
As bandwidth has grown on the Web, the use of video files has grown more
dramatically than almost any other multimedia file type. Adding a video file
to a Web page is relatively easy; the hard part is choosing the right format
and optimizing your video so it downloads quickly and still looks good.
Optimizing video is beyond the scope of this book, but I do include some gen-
eral information about different video file types to help you make more
informed decisions about the kind of video files you add to your pages with
Dreamweaver.
You can save video in a number of video formats. Unfortunately, no single
video format works for everyone on the Web. That’s because you need a video
player to view video on the Web and not everyone has a player, let alone one
that plays all video formats. These days, most new computers come with pre-
installed video and audio players that play the most common file formats. If
you use a Windows computer, you probably have Windows Media Player on
your computer. If you use a Mac, you probably have QuickTime. Both video
players can handle multiple video formats, so anyone with a relatively new
computer can likely view video in common formats.

Part IV: Making It Cool 

If your visitors don’t have the player that they need to view your video files,
you can instruct them on how to download a player. Most multimedia players
are free and relatively easy to install. That’s why I recommend that you make
it a habit to include instructions for downloading the best player for the
video whenever you add a video file to your Web pages. See the earlier side-
bar “Creating warnings for multimedia files” for a couple examples.
You can set a video file to play automatically when visitors open a page
(assuming they have the right player), but I recommend that you require your
visitors to click a link or make some other action before you start playing a
video. I like to give visitors an idea of what to expect so they know it’s worth
the wait before they find they are in the middle of downloading a big video file.
(You find instructions for linking to and embedding video in the section later
in this chapter called, “Adding Multimedia Files to Your Web Page.”)
Beware that many people surf the Web in their offices, in libraries, and in
other locations where unexpected sound can be jarring, disruptive, or worse.
Always give people a warning before you play video or audio and always give
them a way to turn it off quickly when necessary if you want your visitors to
come back and watch more.
Comparing popular video formats
How do you know which format to use? According to many Web designers,
the most widely supported option for video these days is Windows Media.
Most PC computers come with the Windows Media player preinstalled, and a
version is available for Mac users as well. Other Web designers prefer

Streaming media plays faster
Windows Media, RealMedia, and QuickTime
are the most popular formats in large part
because they support streaming. To stream mul-
timedia means to play a file while it’s down-
loading from the server. This is valuable
because video and audio files can take a long
time to download.
Here’s how streaming works. When you click a
link to a video file, your computer begins to
download it from the server. The server calcu-
lates how much of the file to send and which
particular parts of the file you’re requesting (if
you’re listening to the middle of a radio show, for
example). If you’re using a player that supports
streaming, the video or audio file begins to play
as soon as the enough of it downloads suc-
cessfully to assure an uninterrupted experience.
If you don’t use streaming, the entire file must
download before playing. Although it can take
the same amount of time to download the entire
file, streaming can greatly reduce the time your
visitor needs to start viewing a video online.

RealMedia and RealAudio formats from RealNetworks because they say these
formats provide better streaming and quality options. The biggest challenge
with RealMedia is that it requires special software on the Web server. (Check
with your Internet hosting service for rates and support.) QuickTime is
another popular format, especially among Mac users, and you can get video
down to the smallest file sizes without losing quality.
You can convert video from one file format to another relatively easily using
most video-editing programs. For example, you can open a video in AVI
format in a program such as Adobe Premier Elements (a good video editor
for beginners) and then choose File➪Export to convert it to any dozen for-
matting and compression options. For example, you could convert an AVI file
to the Windows Media format with the compression setting for a 56K modem
or into the QuickTime format with the compression setting for a cable
modem. Editing video can get complicated, but converting a video file is rela-
tively easy once you understand the conversion options. (For more video
software options, see the “Comparing video-editing programs” sidebar.)
The following sections provide a brief description of the most common digi-
tal video formats.
Windows Media Video
Defined by Microsoft and popular on the PC, this video format supports
streaming and plays with Windows Media Player as well as many other popu-
lar players.
 File extension: .wmv, asx
 Web site: www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia
RealVideo
RealNetworks designed this file format to play in RealPlayer (available for
Mac and PC). RealMedia provides optimization well suited to low-speed and
high-speed connections, but requires special software on your Web server for
streaming.
 File extension: .rm, rv
 Web site: www.real.com
MPEG
Pronounced em-peg, video in the MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) format
can be optimized to download much faster than formats with similar quality,
such as AVI. MPEGs can play on most video players, including Windows
Media Player, RealPlayer, and dedicated MPEG players.
 File extension: .mpeg, mpg
 Web site: www.mpeg.org
298
Part IV: Making It Cool 

QuickTime
Based on the MPEG standard, Apple developed QuickTime. The QuickTime
player is built into the Macintosh operating system and is used by most Mac
programs that include video or animation. QuickTime is a great format for
video on the Web and supports streaming, but it’s used primarily by those
who favor Macs (although QuickTime files can be viewed on Windows com-
puters as well).
 File extension: .qt, mov
 Web site: www.quicktime.com
AVI
Created by Microsoft, AVI (Audio Video Interleave) is one the most common
video formats on Windows computers and can play on most common video
players. AVI is fine if you’re viewing video on a CD or on your hard drive
where the file doesn’t have to download, but these files are generally too big
to use on the Internet. If your files are in AVI, you should convert them to one
of the other formats before adding them to your Web site. Otherwise, you
force your visitors to download unnecessarily large video files.
 File extension: .avi
 Web site: No one site about AVI exists, but you can find information if
you search for AVI at www.microsoft.com.
Working with Audio on the Web
Audio works much like video on the Web. You can link to a sound file or you
can embed the file into your page, and either way, your visitors need to have
the right player to hear it. You find instructions for both in the following sec-
tion “Adding Multimedia Files to Your Web Page.”
The following sections provide a brief description of the most common digi-
tal audio formats:
MP3
By far the most successful audio compression format, MP3 comes from the
same family as MPEG and supports streaming audio. Most music you can
download from the Internet is in MP3 format, and it is clearly the first choice
of most Web developers.

Comparing video-editing programs
Anyone who’s had to sit through someone else’s
amateur home movies knows why video editing
software is so crucial. Too many blurry, shaky
images, stomach-wrenching zooms, and abrupt
pans, and you find yourself clutching the arms
of your chair and hoping you don’t have to sit
through much more.
Even professionals fall prey to these common
mistakes, which is why most pros shoot at
about a 20:1 ratio — that is, they expect to have
to shoot 20 minutes of tape to capture 1 usable
minute of video. Be kind to your audience and
do what the pros do — ruthlessly cut your video
down to only the very best moments, and
arrange segments so that they have a logical
beginning, middle, and end.
Every program listed in this chapter lets you
perform basic editing and cutting as well as
create fade-ins. The programs also support the
addition of special features, such as opening
titles, voiceovers, and music tracks. As you go
up the price scale, you add features for creat-
ing special effects, slow motion, fast motion,
and even filters that can make your video look
like a scratchy sepia-toned 1920s-era silent
movie.
The following are some of the most popular
video editing programs on the market today:
 Adobe Premiere: This high-end video-
editing program is comparable to the
Hollywood standard, Final Cut Pro, but it’s
not quite as expensive and it works on a PC.
To use this program effectively, you need a
very fast computer, gigabytes of available
hard drive space, and a lot of free time.
 Adobe Premiere Elements: This new “lite”
version of Adobe Premier is much better
suited to a home user. It costs about $600
less (retailing for about $100) and the menus
and options are much simpler to learn.
Unless you’ve managed to get your mitts on
a $30,000 high-definition video camera,
Premiere Elements is more than enough for
your needs.
 Pinnacle Studio Plus: This program is
aimed at the “prosumer” market, meaning
it’s designed for people who have some
familiarity with shooting and editing video
and want a lot of features but aren’t profes-
sionals and don’t have a company expense
account to cover their costs. Studio Plus
does the basics, capturing video and allow-
ing you to cut and paste scenes, dub audio,
and create titles. It also includes some spe-
cial effects (such as slow motion, burring,
and stretching an image) and even a blue
screen feature, which lets you film against
a blue background and then combine video
files to create movies of things that aren’t
possible, such as your hamster dunking a
basketball as skillfully as Michael Jordan.
 Ulead VideoStudio Pro: “Lite” versions of
Ulead’s products are often bundled with
capture cards or other hardware and pro-
vide basic video-editing features. Ulead
also produces MediaStudio, which is an
audio program. You can add plug-ins that
enable VideoStudio to work with high-
definition video and do basic retouching of
the images.
 iMovie: Part of the Apple iLife suite and an
excellent video-editing program, iMovie is
available only for the Macintosh. Many
Macs now come with iLife already installed,
so if you have a newer Mac you prob-
ably already have this editing program.
Acclaimed for its intuitive interface, iMovie
is fully integrated with the rest of iLife, which
includes iPhoto, and works seamlessly with
Mac’s DVD and CD creation software.

Windows Audio
Microsoft’s Windows Audio format supports streaming and can play with
Windows Media Player, as well as many other popular players. It also offers
digital rights management functionality.
 File extension: .wma
 Web site: www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia
RealAudio
RealNetworks designed this streaming file format it plays in RealPlayer (avail-
able for Mac and PC). RealAudio is especially popular among radio stations
and entertainment sites.
 File extension: .ra
 Web site: www.real.com
Ogg Vorbis
One of the newest audio formats on the Web, Ogg Vorbis is an open source
format and is not patented. According to developers, it is constantly being
improved by programmers who volunteer to work on it, but you may not get
much direct support for this file type. Ogg Vorbis is the only audio format for
the Web that offers surround sound for those who have multiple speakers.
 File extension: .ogg
 Web site: www.vorbis.com
WAV
This file format is popular in digital media because it offers the highest sound
quality possible. But audio files in this format are often too big for use on the
Web, averaging 10MB for a minute of audio (in comparison, an MP3 file that is
five times longer can be less than one-third the size). Although WAV files are
commonly used on the Internet because of their nearly universal compatibil-
ity, I recommend that you convert WAV files (especially for long audio clips)
to one of the other audio formats.
 File extension: .wav
 Web site: No official Web site exists for WAV files, but you can find some
documentation at www.microsoft.com if you search for WAV.

Chapter 11: Showing Off with Multimedia

Adding Multimedia Files 
to Your Web Page 
Because you need a player, or plug-in, to play multimedia files, you use
Dreamweaver’s plug-in options to embed audio, video, and other multimedia
files into a Web page. You also have the option of linking to an audio or video
file. (Dreamweaver offers more sophisticated options for inserting Flash files,
covered earlier in this chapter.)
Embedding a file
When you embed a file into a Web page, it can automatically begin to play
when the page loads (as long as your visitor has the necessary player). 
To use Dreamweaver to embed a video or audio file into a Web page, follow
these steps:
1. Click to insert the cursor where you want the file to display on your
Web page.
If you’re inserting a sound file, the play, pause, and stop controls display
wherever you insert the file.
2. Select Common from the Insert bar, if it isn’t already selected.
3. From the Media drop-down list on the Common Insert bar, choose
Plugin. (The icon looks like a puzzle piece.)
You can also choose Insert➪Media➪Plugin.
The Select File dialog box appears.
4. Browse your drive to locate the sound or video file you want inserted
in your page and click to select it.
5. Click OK.
The dialog box closes, and the file is automatically inserted on the page.
You see a small icon that represents the file (the icon looks like a puzzle
piece).
6. Click the icon to open the file options in the Properties inspector.
The options for the file you have embedded appear in the Properties
inspector.
302
Part IV: Making It Cool 

7. Click the Preview button (the icon that looks like a globe at the top of
the work area) to open the page in a browser where you can best test
your multimedia file. 
Dreamweaver launches your specified Web browser and displays the
page. If you have the necessary player and you have the file set to auto-
play, your file automatically displays when the page launches.
Linking to a file
Many people like to have multimedia files, such as video, pop up in a new
browser window. To do this, create an HTML file and embed your multimedia
file in it. Then use the Open Browser Window behavior in Dreamweaver to
create a pop-up window that displays your multimedia page. For more on
how to work with Dreamweaver behaviors, see Chapter 9.
To use Dreamweaver to link to a video, audio, or other multimedia file, follow
these steps:
1. Click to select the text, image, or other element you want to use to
create a link. 
This works just like creating a link to another page.
If you’re linking to a video file, a good trick is to take a single still image
from the video and insert that into your Web page. Then create a link
from that image to the video file.
2. In the Properties inspector at the bottom of the page, click the Browse
button just to the right of the link field.
The Browse button looks like a small file folder.
3. Browse your hard drive to find the video or audio file you want to
link to.
As with any other file you link to, make sure you’ve saved your audio or
video files into your main Web site folder.
4. Click to select the file you want to link to.
5. Click OK.
The dialog box closes, and the link is automatically created.
6. Click the Preview button (the icon that looks like a globe at the top of
the work area) to open the page in a browser where you can test the
link to your multimedia file. 
Dreamweaver launches your specified Web browser and displays the
page. If you have the necessary player, the file downloads, your player
launches, and then your file automatically plays.

Setting options for multimedia files
When you select an embedded multimedia file, such as a sound or video file,
the Properties inspector displays the options for the file, as shown in Figure
11-5. The following describes those options:
 Name text field: Use the text field in the upper-left corner of the Properties
inspector, just to the right of the plug-in icon, if you want to type a name
for your plug-in file. You can leave this field blank or provide any name you
want. Dreamweaver doesn’t provide a name if you leave this field blank.
This name identifies the file only for scripting purposes.
 W (Width): Specify the measurement of the file in pixels.
 H (Height): Specify the measurement of the file in pixels.
For most plug-ins, the height and width tags are required, but
Dreamweaver doesn’t automatically insert them. Instead, you need to
note the size of the file in the program used to create it, or take a best
guess and preview your file in a browser to ensure it displays properly. If
you’re adding a sound file, the height and width specify the size of the
control buttons.
 Source: This option specifies the name and path to the file. You can type
a filename or click the folder icon to browse for the file. This field is
automatically filled in when you embed the file.
 Plg URL: This option enables you to provide a URL where viewers can
download the plug-in if they don’t already have it.
 Align: This option enables you to specify how the element aligns on the
page. Alignment works just as it does for images.

 Play button: Click the green Play button to preview the media file. The
media plug-in must be installed in Dreamweaver (in the Configuration/
Plugins folder) for it to preview in Dreamweaver.
 V Space (Vertical Space): If you want blank space above and below the
plug-in, enter the number of pixels you want.
 H Space (Horizontal Space): If you want blank space on either side of
the plug-in, enter the number of pixels you want, or use a percentage to
specify a portion of the browser window’s width.
 Border: This option specifies the width of the border around the file
when it is displayed.
 Parameters: Click this button to access a dialog box in which you can
enter additional parameters specific to the type of multimedia file you
inserted.
Working with Java
Java is a programming language, similar to Basic, C, or C++, that you can use
to create programs that run on a computer. What makes Java special is that it
can run on any computer system and can display within a browser. 
If you create a program in another programming language, you usually have
to create one version for the Macintosh, another for the PC, and a third for
Unix. But Java, created by Sun Microsystems, is platform-independent so that
developers can use it to create almost any kind of program — even complex
programs, such as sophisticated games or even a word processing program —
that work on any type of computer without the user having to customize the
code for each platform. 
Another advantage of Java is that these programs (often called applets) can
run within a Web browser, allowing the program to interact with different ele-
ments of the page or with other pages on the Web. This capability has made
Java quite popular on the Internet because it provides a way to add sophisti-
cated capabilities to Web pages irrespective of the operating system the Web
browser is running on. You can embed Java applets in Web pages, you can
use Java to generate entire Web pages, or you can run Java applications sepa-
rately after they download.

Inserting Java applets
To insert a Java applet in your Web page, follow these steps:
1. Click to insert the cursor where you want the applet to display on
your Web page.
2. Select Common from the Insert bar, if it isn’t already selected.
3. From the Media drop-down list on the Common Insert bar, choose
Applet (the icon looks like a little coffee cup).
Alternatively, you can choose Insert➪Media➪Applet.
The Select File dialog box appears.
4. Use the Browse button to locate the Java applet file you want to insert
on the page.
5. Click to highlight the filename, and then click OK to close the dialog box.
Dreamweaver doesn’t display applets in the Dreamweaver work area.
Instead, you see an icon that represents the applet. To view the applet
on your Web page (the only way to see the applet in action), preview the
page in a browser, such as Navigator 4.0 and later or Internet Explorer
4.0 and later, that supports applets.
6. Select the Applet icon to open the Properties inspector.
You can set many options in the Properties inspector. If you want to
know more about these options, read on.

Part IV: Making It Cool 
JavaScript is not Java
JavaScript, a scripting language that many
people often confuse with Java, has little in
common with Java other than its name and
some syntactic similarities in the way the lan-
guage works. JavaScript is much simpler than
Java with far fewer capabilities. Unlike Java,
you can write JavaScript directly into HTML
code to create interactive features. You can’t
use it, however, to create standalone applets
and programs, as you can use Java. You don’t
get the complex functionality of Java, but
JavaScript is much easier to use and doesn’t
require a plug-in.
JavaScript is often used in combination with
other multimedia elements on a page, such as
images or sound files, to add greater levels 
of interactivity. Dynamic HTML also uses
JavaScript and is covered in Chapters 8 and 9.
In those chapters, you can read about how to
use Dreamweaver to apply behaviors and other
features using JavaScript with HTML.

Setting Java parameters and other options
Like other file formats that require plug-ins or advanced browser support,
Java applets come with the following options (see Figure 11-6):
 Applet Name: Use this field in the upper-left corner if you want to type a
name for your applet. Dreamweaver doesn’t apply a name if you leave
this field blank. This name identifies the applet for scripting.
 W (Width): This option specifies the width of the applet. You can set the
measurement in pixels or as a percentage of the browser window’s width.
 H (Height): This option specifies the height of the applet. You can set the
measurement in pixels or as a percentage of the browser window’s height.
 Code: Dreamweaver automatically enters the code when you insert the
file. Code specifies the content file of the applet. You can type your own
filename or click the folder icon to choose a file.
 Base: Automatically entered when you insert the file, Base identifies the
folder that contains the applet. Most browsers aren’t set up for auto-
matic install, so you can type your own directory name. This folder is
necessary for applets consisting of multiple files. 
 Align: This option determines how the object aligns on the page.
Alignment works just as it does for images.
 Alt: This option enables you to specify an alternative file, such as an image,
that displays if the viewer’s browser doesn’t support Java. That way, the
user doesn’t see just a broken file icon. If you type text in this field, the
viewer sees this text; Dreamweaver writes it into the code by using the Alt
attribute of the <APPLET> tag. If you use the folder icon to select an image,
the viewer sees an image; Dreamweaver automatically inserts an <IMG> tag
within the <APPLET> and </APPLET> tags of the applet.

 Parameters: Click this button to access a dialog box in which you can
enter additional parameters for the applet.
 Class: Use this drop-down list to access style sheets created with CSS.
You can find lots more information in Java 2 For Dummies, by Barry Burd

Using ActiveX Objects and Controls
Microsoft ActiveX objects and controls are reusable components similar to
miniature applications that can act like browser plug-ins. Because they work
only in Internet Explorer on the Windows platform, they’re useful for only
certain audiences. As a result, no clear standard for identifying ActiveX
objects and controls exists. Still, Dreamweaver supports using ActiveX and
provides some flexibility so that you can set the parameters for the ActiveX
control you use, if you decide to use them.
 Name text field: Use the text field in the upper-left corner of the Properties
inspector, just to the right of the ActiveX icon, if you want to type a
name for your ActiveX object. You can leave this field blank or name it
whatever you want. Dreamweaver doesn’t provide a name if you leave it
blank. This name identifies the ActiveX object only for scripting purposes.
 W (Width): You can specify the measurement of an ActiveX object in
pixels or as a percentage of the browser window’s width.
 H (Height): You can specify the measurement of an ActiveX object in
pixels or as a percentage of the browser window’s height.
 ClassID: The browser uses the ClassID to identify the ActiveX control.
You can type any value or choose any of these options from the drop-
down list: RealPlayer, Shockwave for Director, and Shockwave for Flash.
 Embed: Checking this box tells Dreamweaver to add an <EMBED> tag
within the <OBJECT> tag. The <EMBED> tag activates a Netscape plug-in
equivalent, if available, and makes your pages more accessible to
Navigator users. Dreamweaver automatically sets the values you have
entered for ActiveX properties to the <EMBED> tag for any equivalent
Netscape plug-in.
308
Part IV: Making It Cool 

 Src: This option identifies the file that’s associated with the <EMBED> tag
and used by a Netscape plug-in. You must check the Embed box for this
field to become active.
 Align: This option specifies how the object aligns on the page. Alignment
works just as it does for images.
 Parameters: Click this button to access a dialog box in which you can
enter additional parameters for the ActiveX controls.
 V Space (Vertical Space): If you want blank space above or below the
object, enter the number of pixels you want.
 H Space (Horizontal Space): If you want blank space on either side of
the object, enter the number of pixels you want.
 Base: This option enables you to specify a URL for the ActiveX control
so that Internet Explorer can automatically download the control if it’s
not installed on the user’s system.
 ID: This option identifies an optional ActiveX ID parameter. Consult the
documentation for the ActiveX control you’re using to find out which
parameters to use.
 Data: This option enables you to specify a data file for the ActiveX con-
trol to load.
 Alt Img: This option enables you to link an image that displays if the
browser doesn’t support the <OBJECT> tag.

Forms Follow Function
In This Chapter
 Discovering what forms can do
 Creating forms
 Making forms work
 Integrating forms into dynamic sites
T
he most powerful and interactive Web sites rely on HTML forms to collect
data from users. Whether HTML forms appear as simple text boxes that
provide quick access to search engines or as long registration forms that col-
lect valuable consumer information from visitors, forms are a crucial element
of interactivity.
To understand how Web forms work, think of the elements that make up a 
job application on paper. You can fill in your address in little rectangles and
check off boxes. You can reproduce these traditional information-gathering
elements from paper forms in HTML with equivalent tags that enable site visi-
tors to submit information to your Web server for processing and storage.
Some of the elements you can create include check boxes, radio buttons, and
editable text boxes with different characteristics. 
However, to collect the information from a Web form after a visitor fills it out,
a CGI program of some sort needs to reside on your server. Creating or
installing such a program requires programming skills that go beyond HTML
and generally beyond the scope of this book. In this chapter, you find out
how to create all the form elements, but you have to work with a programmer
or check with your system administrator to find out what kinds of scripts
may be available on your server if you want to process the data collected in
the form.
You also need to create forms if you want to build a dynamic site using
Dreamweaver’s most advanced features, which Chapters 13, 14, and 15 cover.
In this chapter, you find out how to create the HTML forms in Dreamweaver. 
Whether you want to create a simple guest book or a complicated online shop-
ping cart system, you need to know how to set up the text areas, radio buttons,

and drop-down lists that make up an HTML form. Fortunately, Dreamweaver
makes creating forms easy by including a special Forms Insert bar at the top of
the screen to provide quick access to common form elements.

Common Gateway Interface (CGI) scripts are
programs written in a programming language
such as Perl, Java, C++, ASP, or PHP. They work
in tandem with your Web server to process the
data submitted by a user. Think of CGI scripts as
the engine behind an HTML form and many
other automated features on a Web site. These
scripts are much more complex to create than
HTML pages, and these languages take much
longer to figure out than HTML. CGI scripts
reside and run on the server and are usually
triggered by an action a user takes, such as
clicking the Submit button on an HTML form.
A common scenario with a script may go like this:
1. A user loads a page, such as a guest book,
fills out the HTML form, and clicks the
Submit button.
2. The browser gathers all the data from the
form and sends it to the Web server in a
standard format.
3. The Web server takes the incoming data and
hands it off to the CGI script, which unpacks
the data and does something with it, such as
places the data in an e-mail message, and
sends the message to a specified e-mail
address, or adds the data to a database.
4. The CGI script sends instructions or a block
of HTML back to the browser via the Web
server to report on the outcome of the
script, such as a Thank You page.
In Dreamweaver, you can easily create HTML
forms and the Submit buttons that go with them
(you can even use the code editor in Dream-
weaver to write CGI and other scripts), but you
have to know a programming language in order
to do so. If you know Perl, PHP, or ASP, writing
most simple CGI scripts isn’t that hard. But if you
don’t know one of these programming lan-
guages, you’re probably better off hiring some-
one else to do it for you or downloading
ready-made scripts from the Web. If you search
the Web for CGI scripts, you can find that many
programmers write them and give them away
for free. Be aware, however, that when you
download a program, you run the risk of creat-
ing a security risk for your server (so look for
trustworthy scripts with good reviews and sup-
port). You also have to install any scripts you get
on your server and almost always have to alter
the programming code at least a little to tailor
them to work with your unique system. You may
also need to contact your Internet service
provider (ISP) to help you load the script on the
server because many commercial service
providers don’t give you access to do it yourself.
Many ISPs make basic CGI scripts (such as
guest-book forms and simple shopping cart sys-
tems) available to customers as part of mem-
bership. These scripts would be tested and
supported at least minimally by the ISP. You may
find changing ISPs worth the hassle if your ISP
doesn’t now offer the scripts you want. Most
ISPs that offer CGI scripts provide instructions
for using them on their Web sites. These
instructions include the location of the script on
the server. You must include this information in
your HTML form so that the Submit button trig-
gers the proper script. You can find more infor-
mation about setting your HTML form to work
with a script in the section, “Creating HTML
Forms,” later in this chapter.

Appreciating What HTML Forms 
Can Do for You
Forms follow function, to paraphrase the old saying. On the Web, functions
require forms because forms are an integral part of interactive features. By
using forms, Web designers can collect information from users — information
that they can then use in a variety of ways. Forms are commonly used to
create shopping cart systems, guest books, contact forms, search engines,
chat rooms, and discussion areas.
Creating HTML Forms
The basic elements of HTML forms — radio buttons, check boxes, and text
areas, for example — are easy to create with Dreamweaver, as I demonstrate
in this main section. Remember that your form doesn’t work unless it links to
a script. Although Dreamweaver doesn’t provide any scripts, it does make
linking your HTML forms to a script or database easy. You need to know
where the script resides on the server to set this link. The name and location
of the script depend on your server, but for the purposes of showing you how
to link to a script with Dreamweaver, assume that the script you need to link
to is named guestbook.pl (the .pl indicates that the script was written in
Perl) and that the script is on the server in a folder named cgi-bin (a common
name for the folder that holds these kinds of scripts).
313
Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function
Setting up secure commerce systems
Shopping cart systems use HTML forms to col-
lect data from visitors, such as the number of
widgets they want to buy and the address to
deliver the widgets. You can sell millions of wid-
gets over the Internet, but if you want to do it
profitably, you have to set up a secure transac-
tion system to process the orders and confirm
payment information.
Most shopping cart systems on the Internet link
to a secure transaction system. These systems
are usually connected to a financial verification
system that can immediately verify a credit card
to approve or deny a charge and transfer funds
to the appropriate bank account (yes, that
should be your bank account) for the amount of
the transaction. To make this process easier for
businesses, many ISPs now offer complete e-
commerce solutions, designed to help you coor-
dinate all these requirements. Check the Web
site of your Internet service provider to find out
more. E-commerce systems are available also
at Yahoo! (http://store.yahoo.com/) and
at Costco (www.costco.com), in the Business
Services section. To find out more about how
secure transactions work and how to set up
your own system, visit www.verisign.com.

The following steps walk you through linking any form to this sample script. To
use these steps with a different script, simply change the name of the script
and the name of the directory location to reflect your system. Start with an
open page — either a new page or one to which you want to add a form:
1. Choose Insert➪Form➪Form.
You can also click the Form icon on the Forms Insert bar, as shown at
the top of Figure 12-1. The Forms Insert bar displays all the common
form elements.
An empty form container is created in your document and is displayed
as a rectangle outlined by a red dotted line, like the one shown in the
Document area of the figure. This dotted line is used by Dreamweaver to
indicate that an area is defined as a form in the HTML code.
You can control the display of invisible elements, such as form contain-
ers, by choosing Edit➪Preferences (Windows) or Dreamweaver➪
Preferences (Mac) and in the Invisible category, checking or unchecking
the Form Delimiter box.
2. Click the red outline to select the form and display the form options
in the Properties inspector (refer to the bottom of Figure 12-1).
Figure 12-1:

3. Type a name in the Form Name text box.
You can choose any name for this field as long as you don’t use spaces,
special characters, or punctuation. Scripting languages, such as
JavaScript, use the name to identify the form.
4. Type the directory name and the name of the script in the Action 
text box.
Using the sample script I describe earlier, you can type /cgi-bin/
guestbook.pl to specify the path to the Perl script in the cgi-bin folder.
You can use the Browse button in the Properties inspector to set this
link only if you have a copy of the script on your computer in the same
relative location in which it resides on the server. If you’re not the pro-
grammer, or you don’t know much about the script, you probably have
to ask your system administrator or Internet service provider for this
information. (ISPs that offer scripts for Web clients often include instruc-
tions with this information on their Web sites.)
Notice that the path to the script I include in the example starts with a
forward slash, indicating that the cgi-bin folder resides at the root level
on the site. You could also use the full URL, starting with http://.
5. In the Properties inspector, use the Method drop-down list box to
choose Default, Get, or Post (refer to Figure 12-1).
The Get and Post options control how the form works. The option you
use depends on the kind of CGI script you use on your server. Get this
information from your system administrator, programmer, or Internet
service provider.
These are just the preliminary steps you need to create a form. When you
establish the boundaries of a form, as represented by the dotted red line that
appears after Step 1, Dreamweaver creates the code that goes in the back-
ground of your form and enables it to interact with a script on your server.
The rest of this chapter shows you how to add various form elements, such
as text boxes, radio buttons, and drop-down list boxes.
You can use CSS get rid of the auto margin spacing around a form. Chapter 8
covers Cascading Style Sheets.
Comparing radio buttons and check boxes
Radio buttons and check boxes make filling in a form easy for viewers of your
site. Rather than make users type a word, such as yes or no, you can provide
radio buttons and check boxes so that users can simply click boxes or buttons.
315
Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function

What’s the difference between radio buttons and check boxes? Radio buttons
enable users to select only one option from a group. Thus, radio buttons are
good for either/or options or situations in which you want users to make only
one selection. Check boxes, on the other hand, enable users to make multiple
choices, so they’re good for “choose all that apply” situations when users can
make multiple choices, or for approval situations: “Check this box if . . .”
Creating radio buttons
To create radio buttons on a form, follow these steps:
1. Click your form to select it.
If you haven’t yet created a form, follow the steps in the section “Creating
HTML Forms,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Click the Radio Button icon on the Forms Insert bar.
You can also choose Insert➪Form➪Radio Button. Either way, a radio
button appears inside the form’s perimeter.
3. Repeat Step 2 until you have the number of radio buttons you want.
4. Select one of the radio buttons on the form to reveal the radio button’s
properties in the Properties inspector, as shown in Figure 12-2.
5. Type a name in the Radio Button text box.
All radio buttons in a group should have the exact same name so that
the browser associates them with one another and prevents users from
being able to select more than one. If you want users to be able to
Figure 12-2:

316
Part IV: Making It Cool 

choose more than one item from a list, use check boxes, as described in
the following section.
6. Type a name in the Checked Value text box.
Each radio button in a group should have a different Checked Value
name so that the CGI script can distinguish them. Naming them for the
thing they represent is usually best — yes when the choice is yes and no
when it’s no. If you’re asking users about their favorite ice cream flavors,
for example, use as values the flavor each button represents. This name
is usually included in the data you get back when the form is processed
and returned to you (it can be returned in an e-mail message or sent
directly to a database). How the data is returned depends on the CGI
script or other programming used to process the form. If you’re looking
at the data later, interpreting it is easier if the name is something that
makes sense to you.
7. Choose Checked or Unchecked next to Initial State.
These two buttons determine whether the radio button on your form
appears already selected when the Web page loads. Choose Checked if
you want to preselect a choice. You should only set one radio button
option to be preselected and remember the user can always override
this setting by choosing another radio button.
8. Select the other radio buttons (from the Forms Insert bar) one by one
and repeat Steps 5 through 7 to specify the properties in the Properties
inspector for each one.
If your form is complete, jump ahead to the “Finishing off your form with
Submit and Reset buttons” section, later in this chapter. 
Creating check boxes
To create check boxes, follow these steps:
1. Click your form to select it.
If you haven’t yet created a form, follow the steps in the section “Creating
HTML Forms,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Click the Check Box icon on the Forms Insert bar.
You can also choose Insert➪Form➪Check Box.
3. Repeat Step 2 to place as many check boxes as you want.
4. Select one of the check boxes on your form to reveal the check box
properties in the Properties inspector, as shown in Figure 12-3.
317
Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function

5. Type a name in the Checkbox text box.
You should use a distinct name for each check box because users can
select more than one check box and you want to ensure that the infor-
mation submitted is properly associated with each individual check box.
6. Type a name in the Checked Value text box.
Each check box in a group should have a different Checked Value name
so that the CGI script can distinguish them. Naming them for the thing
they represent is usually best. As with radio buttons, the Checked Value
is usually included in the data you get back when the form is processed
and returned to you. If you’re looking at the data later, interpreting it is
easier if the name is something that makes sense to you.
7. Choose Checked or Unchecked next to Initial State.
This option determines whether the check box appears already selected
when the Web page loads. Choose Checked if you want to preselect a
choice. A user can always override this preselection by clicking the text
box again to deselect it.
8. Select the other check boxes (from the Forms Insert bar) one by one
and repeat Steps 5 through 7 to set the properties in the Properties
inspector for each one.
If your form is complete, jump ahead to the “Finishing off your form with
Submit and Reset buttons” section, later in this chapter.
Adding text fields and text areas
When you want users to enter text, such as a name, e-mail address, or com-
ment, you need to use a text field. To insert text fields, follow these steps:

318
Part IV: Making It Cool 

1. Click the form to select it.
If you haven’t yet created a form, follow the steps in the section,
“Creating HTML Forms,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Click the Text Field icon on the Forms Insert bar.
You can also choose Insert➪Form➪Text Field. A text field box appears.
3. On the form, click to place your cursor next to the first text field and
type a question or other text prompt.
For example, you may want to type Address: next to a text box where
you want a user to enter an address.
4. Select the text field on your form to reveal the Text Field properties in
the Properties inspector, as shown in Figure 12-4.
5. Type a name in the TextField text box.
Each text area on a form should have a different text field name so that the
CGI script can distinguish them. Naming them for the thing they represent
is usually best. In Figure 12-4, you can see that I named the Address option
Address. Many scripts return this name next to the contents of the text
field a visitor enters at your Web site. If you’re looking at the data later, you
can more easily interpret it if the name corresponds to the choice.
6. In the Char Width box, type the number of characters you want to be
visible in the field.
This setting determines the width of the text field that appears on the
page. Determine the size by the amount of information you expect users
to enter.
7. Type the maximum number of characters you want to allow in the
Max Chars box.
If you leave this field blank, users can type as many characters as they
choose. I usually limit the number of characters only if I want to main-
tain consistency in the data. For example, I like to limit the State field to
Figure 12-4:
Use the Text
Field option
to create
form fields
in which
users can
enter one or
more lines
of text.
319
Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function

a two-character abbreviation. Again, you determine the size to make it
by the amount of information you expect users to enter.
You can set the Char Width field to be longer or shorter than the Max
Chars field. You can choose to make them different if you want to main-
tain a certain display area because it looks better in the design, but you
want to enable users to add more information if they choose to. That
way, if users type more characters than can display in the area, the text
scrolls so that users can still see the end of the text they’re typing.
8. Next to Type, click to select the button next to Single Line, Multi Line,
or Password:
• Choose Single Line if you want to create a one-line text box, such
as the kind I created for the Name and Address fields shown in
Figure 12-4.
• Choose Multi Line if you want to give users space to enter text.
(Note that if you choose Multi Line, you also need to specify the
number of lines you want the text area to cover by typing a
number in the Num Lines field, which appears as an option when
you choose Multi Line.)
• Specify Wrap to control how the user’s data displays if he exceeds
the length of the text field. Selecting Off or Default prevents the
user’s text from wrapping to the next line. 
• Choose Password if you’re asking users to enter data that they might
not want to display on-screen. This type of field causes entered data
to appear as asterisks and disables copying from the field.
9. In the Init Val text box, type any text you want to display when the
form loads.
For example, you can include the words Add comments here on the
form in the text field under Comments. Users can delete the Init Value
text or leave it and add more text to it.
10. Select the other text areas one by one and repeat Steps 5 through 9 to
set the properties in the Properties inspector for each one.
If your form is complete, jump ahead to the “Finishing off your form with
Submit and Reset buttons” section, later in this chapter.
Firefox, Netscape, Safari, and Microsoft Internet Explorer don’t display text
fields in forms equally. The differences vary depending on the version of the
browser, but the general result is that a text field displays with different dimen-
sions in one browser than in another. Slight differences exist with color, scroll
bars, and shape in the case of check boxes. Unfortunately, this problem has no
perfect solution, but you should test all your forms in all browsers and create
designs that look okay even when the text fields display differently.
320
Part IV: Making It Cool 

Creating drop-down lists
When you want to give users a multiple-choice option but don’t want to take
up lots of space on the page, drop-down lists are an ideal solution. To create
a drop-down list using Dreamweaver, follow these steps:
1. Click your form to select it.
If you haven’t yet created a form, follow the steps in the section “Creating
HTML Forms,” earlier in this chapter.
2. Click the List/Menu icon on the Forms Insert bar.
You can also choose Insert➪Form➪List/Menu. A drop-down list appears.
3. Click to place your cursor next to the List field and enter a question or
other text prompt.
In Figure 12-5, I use the example What is your favorite sport?.
4. Select the field that represents the list on your page to reveal the List/
Menu properties in the Properties inspector, as shown at the bottom
of Figure 12-5.
Figure 12-5:
The
List/Menu
option
enables you
to create 
a drop-
down list of
options that

321
Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function

5. Type a name in the List/Menu text box.
Each list or menu on a form should have a different name so that you
can differentiate the lists when you sort out the data.
6. Next to Type, choose Menu or List.
This step determines whether this form element is a drop-down menu or
a scrollable list. If you choose List, you can specify the height and con-
trol how many items are shown at a time. You can also specify whether a
user can select more than one item. If you choose Menu, these options
aren’t available.
7. Click the List Values button in the upper-right of the Properties
inspector.
The List Values dialog box opens (see Figure 12-6), and you can enter the
choices you want to make available. Click the plus sign (+) to add an
item label; then type the label text you want in the text box that appears
in the dialog box. Item labels display on the menu or list on the Web
page in the order in which you enter them. Use the minus sign (–) to
delete a selected option. Press the Tab key to move the cursor to the
Value side of the dialog box, where you can enter a value. Values are
optional, but if present, they are sent to the server instead of the label
text. This provides a way of including information that you don’t want to
display on the drop-down menu. For example, if you enter football as a
label on the left, you can enter American as a value on the right to dis-
tinguish American football from soccer, which is often called football in
other parts of the world. If you don’t enter a value, the label is used as
the submitted data when the form is processed.
8. Click OK to close the dialog box.
If your form is complete, jump ahead to “Finishing off your form with Submit
and Reset buttons,” section later in this chapter.
Unless you have a CGI script or other program connected to this form, it isn’t
executed, even if you have created the form itself correctly.
Figure 12-6:

322
Part IV: Making It Cool 

Finishing off your form with 
Submit and Reset buttons
For your users to be able to send their completed forms to you, you need to
create a Submit button, which, when clicked, tells the user’s browser to send
the form to the CGI script that processes the form. You may also want to add
a Reset button, which enables users to erase any information they have
entered if they want to start over. 
Many developers don’t use the Reset button because they find it confusing
and because visitors can always leave a page before hitting the Submit
button if they choose not to complete a form. 
These buttons are easy to create in Dreamweaver. To create a button, follow
these steps:
1. Click your form to select it.
If you haven’t yet created a form, check out the steps in the section
“Creating HTML Forms,” earlier in this chapter. I suggest that you also
enter a few fields, such as radio buttons or text fields. There’s not much
point in having a Submit button if you don’t collect any data that needs
to be submitted.
2. Click the Button icon on the Forms Insert bar.
You can also choose Insert➪Form➪Button.
A Submit button appears, and the Form Properties inspector changes to
reveal button properties. You can change it to a Reset button or other
kind of button by altering the attributes in the Properties inspector, as
shown in the remaining steps.
3. Select the button you just added to display the button properties in
the Properties inspector, as shown in Figure 12-7.
Figure 12-7:
Submit and
Reset
buttons

323
Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function

4. Click either the Submit Form or Reset Form button next to Action.
A Submit button invokes an action, such as sending user information to
an e-mail address. A Reset button returns the page to the way it was
when the page loaded. There is also a None option, which creates a
button that doesn’t do anything.
5. In the Label text box, type the text you want to display on the button.
You can type any text you want for the label, such as Search, Go, Clear,
or Delete.
There you have it! Now that you know how to use Dreamweaver to create the
basic elements of HTML forms, you can develop more intricate forms for
your Web site. Remember: None of these forms works without a CGI script or
other program behind it to execute when the user enters the information.
Using jump menus
Many designers use jump menus as navigational elements because they can
provide a list of links in a drop-down list without taking up lots of room on a
Web page. You can also use a jump menu to launch an application or start an
animation sequence.
To create a jump menu, follow these steps:
1. Click your form to select it.
If you haven’t yet created a form, follow the steps in the section
“Creating HTML Forms,” earlier in this chapter. Note that you don’t need
a Submit button to make a jump menu work, although adding one may
make the action step clear to users.
2. Click the Jump Menu icon on the Forms Insert bar.
You can also choose Insert➪Form➪Jump Menu.
The Insert Jump Menu dialog box opens.
3. In the Text field, under Menu Items, type the name you want to dis-
play in the drop-down list.
Click the plus sign (+) to add more items. As you type items in the Text
field, they display in the Menu Items list, as shown in Figure 12-8.
4. Use the Browse button to locate the page you want to link to or enter
the URL for the page in the When Selected, Go to URL field.
You can link to a local file or enter any URL to link to a page on another
Web site, and you can use the Browse button to specify the URL you
want to link to.
324
Part IV: Making It Cool 

5. Use the Open URLs In field to specify a target if you’re using frames.
If you’re not using frames, the default is Main Window. Then, when the
user selects an option, the new page replaces the page he is viewing.
6. Use the Menu Name field if you want to enter a unique identifier for
this menu.
This option can be useful if you have multiple jump menus on a page.
You can use any name you want, but you can’t use spaces, special char-
acters, or punctuation.
7. Use the Insert Go Button After Menu option if you want to force users
to click a button to activate the selection.
If you don’t add a Go button, the linked page loads automatically as soon
as the user makes a selection. The Go button is really just a Submit
button — it’s just usually labeled a Go button on a jump menu.
Choosing other form options 
in Dreamweaver
As though all the features I describe earlier in this chapter aren’t enough,
Dreamweaver includes a few specialized form options for facilitating interac-
tivity, adding images, and even adding hidden fields. You can use each of
these options:
 File Field icon: Enables you to add a Browse button to a form so that
users can upload files from their local computers to your server. The
button enables users to upload images or text files, but it works only if
your server is set up to handle this kind of upload from a browser. Check
with your system administrator if you’re not sure.

325
Chapter 12: Forms Follow Function

A File field is useful if you’re creating a system like the one at the online
service at www.MyEvent.com. It has a “Build your own Web site” system
that enables anyone to create an individual site without needing a pro-
gram like Dreamweaver. Many Web sites now provide this service to
users. The sites are generally template-based systems that walk readers
through a series of forms where they choose designs and enter text that
they want to appear on their Web pages. Most people want to be able to
add more than just text to their sites — they want to add their own
images, such as logos and photos. That’s where a File field becomes nec-
essary. By using this form option, you can enable readers to browse
their own hard drives for a file and then automatically upload it to your
server, where it can be linked to their pages.
The complex File Field feature requires a sophisticated CGI script and
special server access to work. If you aren’t a programmer, you may need
assistance to use this option on your site.
 Image Field icon: Makes adding an image to your form simple and easy.
You can use images to create more attractive or interesting buttons.
 Hidden Field icon: Inserts data that isn’t displayed to users but can be
used by a script or other application that processes the form. Most
scripts have a few hidden fields that are necessary for full functionality.
Making your forms look good
The best way to get your form fields to line up nicely is to use an HTML table.
You may want to use a table to align a form by putting all your text in one row
of cells and all your text fields in an adjacent row. You may also want to place
all your radio buttons in the cells on the left and the text they correspond to
in the cells on the right. (Chapter 6 shows you how to create HTML tables
and how to use them to align information in your forms.) You can also use
images and table border to make tables look better.

Working with
Dynamic Content

In this part . . .
T
he most sophisticated and technically complicated Web
sites are created using databases to dynamically gener-
ate Web pages, ideal for content-heavy Web sites. Although
creating a Web site with these advanced features is far more
complex than what you find in earlier parts of this book, the
rewards can be worth the trouble. In this part, you discover
the benefits of creating a dynamic site, find out how to work
with a database on the Web, and follow step-by-step instruc-
tions to build a simple database-driven site.

Chapter 13
Building a Dynamic Web Site:
Getting Started
In This Chapter
 Defining a dynamic Web site
 Going over the basic terminology
 Setting up a Data Source Name
T
he most sophisticated Web sites on the Internet, such as Amazon.com or
CNN.com, were created using complex programming and databases.
Combining a database that records information about users with the capabil-
ity to generate pages automatically is what enables Amazon to greet you by
name when you return to its site, track your orders as you buy books, and
even make recommendations based on your previous purchases. 
Static Web sites, which you can build using the instructions in Chapter 12,
work well for many Web sites (including my own at www.JCWarner.com). But
for anyone creating a really large, content-heavy site, such as a magazine or
newspaper Web site, or large e-commerce sites where you need to track
inventory and want users to be able to search through products, dynamic
Web sites are a better choice.
Before you even start down this path, let me warn you of two things. First,
creating a database-driven Web site is far, far more complex than creating the
kinds of Web sites described in the earlier chapters of this book. And second,
the most sophisticated sites on the Web, such as Amazon and CNN, use
highly customized systems that require teams of very experienced program-
mers to create (and are far beyond what you can do with Dreamweaver’s
dynamic site features).
That said, Dreamweaver does include basic database development features
that you can use to create dynamic Web sites. In this chapter and the two
that follow, you find an introduction to these features and instructions for
creating a basic, database-driven site.

A description of the more advanced Dreamweaver database features is beyond
the scope of this Dummies book. If you want to use Dreamweaver’s most
advanced database features, you find more information in Dreamweaver MX
2004 Bible, written by Joseph Lowery (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
This chapter begins by introducing you to what a dynamic Web site and a
database are and the many ways in which, through a dynamic Web site, you
can display and edit information contained within a database. You also dis-
cover what you need to have in place in order to create a dynamic Web site.
In Chapters 14 and 15, you find step-by-step directions for creating various
dynamic features on a real-world Web site.
Understanding the Dynamic Web Site
A dynamic Web site is usually connected to a database, which delivers differ-
ent data to each Web site visitor based on his or her requests. Many dynamic
Web sites also have Web pages that permit an administrator or a site visitor
to make changes to the information that is displayed through a series of
simple steps without ever leaving the Web browser. A good example of a
dynamic Web site is a search engine. You type what you want to find into a
search field and when you submit your request, you get instant results with
information that is relevant (ideally, anyway!) to your search request. 
If you want to add just a simple search engine to a Web site, see Chapter 17
for tips about using Google’s free search engine features on any Web site.
A dynamic Web site has many advantages besides the capability to create a
site-wide search. Suppose that you have a Web site where you sell 657 differ-
ent kinds of candy. On a static Web site, you would have to create 657 pages,
one for each candy product. With a database-driven site, you create just one
page that contains special code to describe where to display the product
name, image, description, and any other pertinent information on the page.
Then you enter all your product information into a database (if it’s not in one
already), and the special code in the page design communicates with the
database, collecting each product’s information and creating a page on the fly
for each product as visitors request that product.
Not only can this kind of system save lots of time (because you don’t have to
create all those individual pages), dynamic Web sites also enable you to make
changes and updates with less effort. And you can even display the same
product information in multiple page designs, in different combinations, and
even on different sites with much less effort.
These sites are usually set up so that the Web site can be administered
through a Web browser, allowing staff with little or no technical skills to
easily add or remove products and make changes to existing products. They
330
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

simply enter or edit information in a form using a Web browser and click
Submit, and they can make changes to the database. Once updated, that new
information appears instantly the next time a product page is loaded for a
visitor. 
Usually, you would limit the capability to make these changes to a few people
on your staff. You don’t necessarily want your customers making price
changes or altering product descriptions, but you may want your sales staff
to be able to easily make changes, even when they’re out in the field. You can
control this situation by setting up different levels of password access to
your site. That way, customers can search for certain information, and staff
members with special access and the right passwords can search for even
more information and make changes to it. The system you use to do both
these tasks is essentially the same, but you set up different levels of access to
make it all work this way.
Beware, however, that before a non-technical staff person can easily make
changes and updates to a dynamic site, someone who is technically savvy
has to do a significant amount of setup work to create the dynamic system.
Again, this kind of Web site system only makes sense if you’re creating a very
large, complex, and data-rich Web site. A programmer could spend much
more time setting up even a simple database site than it takes to create quite
a few static Web pages. 
Talking the Talk: Key Concepts
If you’re sure that you want to create a dynamic Web site and that the basic
database features in Dreamweaver are up to the task for you, then read on. You
can do some very cool things with a database-driven site, even if you’re not
creating the next Amazon. Before jumping into your first dynamic Web site,
however, the following pages are designed to help you become familiar with a
few key concepts that play an integral role in dynamic Web site development.
Exploring a database
A database is a collection of information compiled in one or more tables. Each
table has multiple fields (also called columns) and individual records in rows.
What? Okay, picture a mail-order catalog, such as Pottery Barn. (Indulge me —
it’s my favorite.)
The catalog itself is the database. It contains a collection of information about
various products. Each product is a record in the database. In this case, all
particular products have an item number, price, and a color — and each of
those is a field. A record in a database consists of one complete set of all
331
Chapter 13: Building a Dynamic Web Site: Getting Started

fields in a table. Taking it a step further, within the catalog, the various prod-
ucts are organized in categories often because they have something in common
(furniture, rugs, bedding, wall décor). Each category is a table — a grouping
of various records from a database that have something in common.
This type of table isn’t the same kind discussed in Chapter 6, where you find
out how HTML tables are used to format information, much as you would use
a spreadsheet program, such as Excel. Database tables aren’t used for format-
ting; they’re for grouping and organizing content.
How it works on the Web
Databases on the Web work in much the same way. Suppose that you go to
www.penpal.net to find a new pen pal. If you’re a registered member, you
can search by location, gender, and age: Starting on the search page, you can
click the Search by Country link. On the next page, you can choose France
and click the Search button. The following page lets you choose age range,
and the next page lets you choose gender. You might choose Ages 21-29, and
on the last page you can choose a specific age and gender, a 25-year-old male
for example. After you click male, a list of potential pen pals who match your
requirements appears right before your eyes (see Figure 13-1).
Figure 13-1:
The
Penpal.net
results
page.
332
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

When you submit your criteria, some specific code on that page matched
your information with information in a database that lists other people look-
ing for a pen pal. It looked through every record (individual person), trying to
find records (pen pals) with fields that match your request. If you want, you
could also list yourself as a potential pen pal for others to find you by enter-
ing your information and adding it to the database directly from your Web
browser!
Database applications
Various applications are made specifically for creating and managing data,
including Microsoft Access, SQL Server, MySQL, FoxPro, and Oracle. Novices
most commonly use Access to create small databases (MDB files). Access is
also commonly used to communicate visually with bigger databases, such as
Microsoft SQL Server.
I created the examples in this book in Microsoft Access 2000 running with the
Windows XP Professional operating system. If you want to dig deeper into 
the world of databases, consider purchasing Database Development For
Dummies and SQL For Dummies, both written by Allen G. Taylor; Access 2003
For Dummies, written by John Kaufeld; or Oracle8i For Dummies, written by
Carol McCullough-Dieter (all published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.).
Plugging in the data
Now that you have the database basics covered, you need to provide a way
for the Web site and the database to communicate. In the next section, I show
you how to set up a Web server and an application server step-by-step so
that you can get started.
Setting up the Web server
While working with Web sites that are static (the content is entered by hand
and isn’t permanently altered by, or customized for, the person viewing the
site), you may be used to previewing pages directly from your local hard
drive. It’s not that simple when the content is dynamic because Dreamweaver
adds some special code that the server needs to process before the content
is published to the viewer. Having a Web server is crucial when you’re work-
ing with a dynamic Web site, because you need to test your work along the
way to make sure that you get the results you’re shooting for.
333
Chapter 13: Building a Dynamic Web Site: Getting Started

A Web server is both a piece of computer hardware on which a Web site is
stored and the software on that system that provides the server functionality.
In this case, the Web server I’m referring to is the software installed on a
system, not an actual computer chip in a large beige case.
Server Technologies Supported 
by Dreamweaver
Dreamweaver supports these five server technologies (described in detail in
the following sections):
 Active Server Pages (ASP)
 ASP.NET
 ColdFusion
 JavaServer Pages (JSP)
 PHP (which stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor — a recursive
acronym, for you wordsmiths)
The examples in this book use ASP in Microsoft Windows. In essence, all five
work toward the same outcome: dynamic content on a Web page or Web site.
They all provide the capability to generate HTML dynamically. Using server-
side code, they can display information from a database and create HTML
based on whether certain criteria are met or specified by a particular user. I
selected ASP and Microsoft Windows for this book because ASP is one of the
most common and relatively easy-to-use server software options.
To recommend one technology over the other really wouldn’t be fair because
they all offer similar functionality with slight variations in speed and effi-
ciency. The most marketable language is ASP because of its widely used and
mature features. If you dream of becoming a highly paid programmer, you
can’t go wrong with this one.
Check out these other titles, all published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.: Active
Server Pages For Dummies, by Bill Hatfield; ASP.NET For Dummies, by Bill
Hatfield; JavaServer Pages For Dummies, by MacCormac Rinehart; ColdFusion
MX For Dummies, by John Paul Ashenfelter; and PHP 5 For Dummies, by Janet
Valade.
The following sections provide more detail on each of these scripting languages.
334
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

ASP
ASP is a server technology that comes, at no additional cost, built into
Windows 2003 Server, Windows 2000, Windows XP Professional, and it can be
easily installed into Windows 98 and NT. Used in conjunction with Microsoft
IIS or Personal Web Server, ASP isn’t a stand-alone programming language
because much of the code you write for ASP pages is in VB Script or JavaScript.
You can check out www.4guysfromrolla.com to find out more about ASP in
what more closely resembles plain English.
ASP.NET
ASP.NET is a relatively new server technology. It’s not a revision of ASP 3.0; in
fact, it’s almost a complete overhaul of it. This latest installment of ASP isn’t
what 3.0 was to 2.0 — Microsoft has done more than add new tags. The lan-
guage is more similar to traditional programming languages, such as C++,
where code is compiled. This arrangement suggests that applications written
in ASP.NET can run faster than anything now available because Web servers
work more efficiently with less coding overhead. However, ASP.NET isn’t as
verbose as ASP 3.0, so it’s much harder for novice programmers to read.
ASP.NET is a Microsoft technology, and you can find more information at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/asp.net/. You can also find more about
ASP.NET from http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/.
JavaServerPages (JSP)
JSP is from Sun Microsystems. Because its dynamic code is based on Java,
you can run the pages from non-Microsoft Web servers. You can use JSP on
Allaire JRun Server and IBM WebSphere. Using JSP, you can create and keep
the dynamic code separated from the HTML pages (by using JavaBeans), or
you can embed the JSP code into the page. Unless you’re a hard-core pro-
grammer, however, this language isn’t for you. JSP is horribly complex.
ColdFusion MX
ColdFusion MX, owned by Macromedia, uses its own server and scripting lan-
guage. ColdFusion is probably the easiest language to figure out; and it offers
built-in XML processing and custom tags that also allow you to separate
dynamic code from HTML, which makes it similar to JSP. Like JSP, it’s also
ultimately based on Java.
335
Chapter 13: Building a Dynamic Web Site: Getting Started

PHP
PHP was originally native to Unix-based servers. However, you can now
download Windows binaries from www.php.net to run Apache (a server soft-
ware typically used with PHP) from any version of Windows as well as IIS on
NT, 2000, XP Professional, and 2003 Server. You can even configure PHP to
run on Personal Web Server (although it’s rather tricky). The PHP scripting
language is based on C, Perl, and Java. You can get more functionality with
PHP right out of the box than you can with ASP. For example, virtually every
ASP add-on that’s on sale at www.serverobjects.com comes built-in stan-
dard or is available for free from PHP.net.
Making the Data Connection
To set up a Web server, you need server software. A Web server, sometimes
called an HTTP server, responds to requests from a Web browser by serving
up Web pages based on those requests.
You also need to set up an application server, which helps the Web server to
process specially marked Web pages. When the browser requests one of
these pages, the Web server hands the page off to the application server,
which processes it before sending the page to the browser.
I use ASP specifically for the examples in this section because it’s much easier
to set up than any of the other technologies. Assuming that you’re rather new
at this task, I wouldn’t want to throw you into the deep end (not yet, anyway).
In order to use ASP, the server choices are Microsoft IIS or Personal Web Server
(PWS). Either one of these servers works as both a Web server and an applica-
tion server. PWS runs with Windows 98 or Windows NT, and you can install it
from your Windows CD. If you have Windows 2000 Server, Windows NT 4, or
Windows XP Professional, IIS is part of the package. If you can’t find your CD,
you can always download IIS or PWS for free from the Microsoft Web site.
At this point, if you’re running Windows 95, Windows 98 SE, or Windows NT,
make sure that you have PWS installed. If you’re running Windows 2000 or
Windows XP Professional, IIS is already in your system, and all you have to
do is make sure that it’s started.
If you’re running Windows 2000 or Windows XP Professional and IIS isn’t
enabled, you can install it by choosing Control Panel➪Add/Remove Programs➪
Add/Remove Windows Components. When the Windows Components screen
appears, scroll down the list and make sure that a check mark appears next
to the Internet Information Server option.
336
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

IIS doesn’t work on Windows XP Home Edition. You must upgrade to
Windows XP Professional to use it.
To download and install Microsoft Personal Web Server, go to www.microsoft.
com/downloads/ and search for option pack. Click the Windows NT 4.0
Option Pack option. If you’re using Windows 98, choose Windows 95 from the
list of operating systems — it’s the same file — and follow the downloading
instructions.
Setting up a DSN
A Data Source Name, or DSN, is basically a name associated with your data-
base that helps you to keep your connection with the database intact even if
the database changes to a new location.
Although you don’t need a DSN to connect to a database using Dreamweaver,
a DSN is the easiest way to get your dynamic Dreamweaver site to work.
To follow along with the steps in this section, you need an existing Microsoft
Access database file, and you need to make sure that your Access Database
Driver is installed. Follow these steps to ensure that it’s already there and to
create the DSN:
1. In Windows XP Professional, choose Start➪Programs➪Administrative
Tools➪Data Sources (ODBC).
You see the ODBC Data Source Administrator dialog box (see Figure 13-2).
On the first tab (User DSN), you see MS Access Database and Microsoft
Access Driver (*mdb) on one line.
Figure 13-2:
The ODBC
Data Source
Administra-
tor dialog
box.
337
Chapter 13: Building a Dynamic Web Site: Getting Started

2. Click the System DSN tab.
You see a list of database connections.
3. Click Add.
A list of drivers appears (see Figure 13-3).
4. Select Microsoft Access Driver and then click Finish.
The ODBC Microsoft Access Setup dialog box appears (see Figure 13-4).
5. Enter a name for your database in the Data Source Name text box. 
You don’t have to type something in the Description box, but you can
if you want.
Because the examples later in the chapter have to do with contacts, I
assume that your database is called contacts.mdb and that you type
myContacts as the Data Source Name. But you can call it whatever you
want, as long as you remember what you called it.

6. Click Select.
The Select Database dialog box appears.
7. Find the database you want to use and click OK.
As you can see, the path to the database is now listed in the Database
area in the ODBC Microsoft Access Setup dialog box.
8. You can click the Advanced button to fill out authorization informa-
tion if your database requires a username and password. Otherwise,
don’t worry about it.
9. Click OK in the ODBC Microsoft Access Setup dialog box to close it;
then click OK to close the ODBC Data Source Administrator dialog box.
Setting up Dreamweaver for Windows
Creating the data connection in Dreamweaver takes a few quick steps. You
should start by setting up your site’s local information and remote site infor-
mation, which Chapter 2 explains in detail. Check out that chapter to get
reacquainted if you’re not already comfortable with this process.
In this example, I assume that you’re running IIS (or PWS) on the same machine
you run Dreamweaver on, so I show you how to set up a local connection.
If your IIS or PWS is enabled, when you go to your browser and type http://
localhost in the address bar, you see a page confirming that your Web server
is up and running.
To get started, follow these steps:
1. Create a new ASP Javascript page by choosing File➪New.
The New Document dialog box opens (see Figure 13-5).
2. Click Dynamic Page in the Category list.
3. Click ASP JavaScript and then click Create.
You have to have a document open to do anything with the Application
panel. 
4. Click the Application panel to expand it and click the Databases tab
(see Figure 13-6).
You can open the Databases tab by choosing Window➪Databases from
the Dreamweaver main menu.
339
Chapter 13: Building a Dynamic Web Site: Getting Started

5. Click the plus sign (+) and select Data Source Name (DSN) from the list.
You see the Data Source Name dialog box, as shown in Figure 13-7.
Figure 13-6:
The
Databases
tab.
Figure 13-5:
New
Document
dialog box.
340
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

6. Enter the name for the new connection.
For example, type myContacts.
7. Select your database from the list of DSNs. Make sure you indicate
that Dreamweaver should connect using local DSN.
If the name of your connection is myContacts, then you select the
myContacts database.
If you want to use a remote application server, make sure, of course, that
you indicate that Dreamweaver should connect using DSN on the testing
server.
8. Click the Test button.
You see a pop-up message letting you know that the connection was
made successfully, and you see your database listed on the Databases
tab (see Figure 13-8).
In the Files panel, you also see on your local drive a Connections folder,
which contains an ASP file with the connection information for this data-
base. Dreamweaver automatically references this file on any page you
create that uses this database connection, saving you from having to
insert it every time.
The ASP files in the Connections folder store necessary information that
makes your page work correctly with the database. Upload this folder when
you upload your site files to the application server.
If your connection fails, check your DSN again, and check the URL prefix for
the application server. You can also check the Dreamweaver Help Index for
other troubleshooting tips. 
Now you’re ready to build a dynamic Web site. In Chapters 14 and 15, I get
into more details so that you can put these great Dreamweaver features to
use on your site right away.

Chapter 13: Building a Dynamic Web Site: Getting Started

Setting up Dreamweaver for Mac users
Setting up a data connection on a Mac is a little more complicated because
you can’t run one of Dreamweaver’s support Web servers or application
servers locally, unless you’re running OS X; you must connect to a remote
server. Ideally, you can connect your Mac to an NT server with permission to
browse the Mac, and after you’re networked, make the data connection.
Dreamweaver includes information in its help files that specifically covers
this process for Mac users.
OS X users can alternatively download Apache’s HTTP server from http://
httpd.apache.org/. However, anyone using OS 9 and earlier is out of luck.

I
f you’ve never used the dynamic development capabilities of Dream-
weaver, you’ll want to get familiar with the windows and inspectors cov-
ered in the beginning of this chapter before you start creating your first
project. In the rest of this chapter, you find out how these elements work
together to create a Web site full of dynamic features. 
For the purposes of illustration, all the figures and steps in this chapter are
based on an example site with a contact management system that features
information for various people — names, addresses, and pictures. If your site
features another kind of data, such as product descriptions or articles, don’t
worry — these steps show you how to use Dreamweaver to create any kind
of dynamic site. You can apply the info in this chapter to your own data to
create any kind of dynamic Web site.
Make sure your application server is running and, because this chapter
assumes that you’re using Internet Information Server or Peer Web Services
for Windows, make sure that you save all the pages as ASP pages (filename.
asp) so that the server parses the code correctly. For a quick reminder on
how to set up the application server, refer to Chapter 13.
Exploring the Panel
In Dreamweaver, the most fundamental elements of creating a dynamic Web
site are in the Application panel, which includes the Databases, Bindings,
Components, and Server Behaviors panels. In this section, I introduce you to
these panels, which help you create your dynamic site.

The Databases panel
The Databases panel lets you look at the databases on your application
server without creating a recordset. In the Databases panel, you can view
your entire database structure within Dreamweaver — tables, fields, views,
and stored procedures — without needing to use separate database software.
You can find the Databases panel by choosing Window➪Databases on the
main menu.
You can create a Data Source Name (DSN) or a custom connection string by
clicking the plus (+) sign in the Databases panel (shown in Figure 14-1). To
see how you can create a Data Source Name using the Databases panel, refer
to Chapter 13.
Figure 14-1:
The
Databases
panel.
344
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

The Bindings panel
The Bindings panel enables you to add and remove dynamic content data
sources from your document. The number and kinds of available data
sources can vary depending on whether you use ASP, JSP, or any other server
technology (see Chapter 13 for a refresher on servers if you need to). A data
source is where you get information to use on your dynamic Web page. An
example of a data source is a recordset from a database, which you further
explore in the next few sections of this chapter.
If you don’t see the Bindings panel, you can open it by choosing Window➪
Bindings on the main menu.
With the Bindings panel, you can access data sources in several ways. You
can find out what data source objects you have available by clicking the plus
(+) sign in the Bindings panel to get the Add Bindings pop-up menu (see
Figure 14-2).
The Add Bindings pop-up menu includes
 Recordset (Query): A recordset stores data from your database for use on
a page or set of pages. I explain recordsets in more detail in this chapter.
 Command (Stored Procedure): Commands, or stored procedures, are
reusable database items that contain SQL code and are commonly used
to modify a database (insert, update, or delete records). 
 Request Variable: Commonly used wherever a search is involved, a
Request Variable carries information from one page to another. When you
use a form to submit data to another page, a request variable is created.
 Session Variable: Session variables store and display information for the
duration of a user’s session (or visit). A different session is created on
the server for each user and is kept in use either for a set period of time
or until a specific action on the site terminates the session (such as a
logging out).
 Application Variable: Application variables store and display informa-
tion that must be present for all users and is constant throughout the
lifetime of an application. These types of variables are commonly used
for page counters or date and time counters. Application variables are
available only for ASP and ColdFusion pages, not for PHP and JSP.
 Get More Data Sources: Use this option to open Dreamweaver Exchange
in your browser. You can use Exchange to download extensions for
Dreamweaver. For more information about extensions, see Chapter 15.
345
Chapter 14: Bringing Data into the Mix

The Server Behaviors panel
Server behaviors are server-side scripts that perform some type of action.
Through the Server Behaviors panel, you can add server-side scripts to your
pages, such as user authentication and record navigation, which you can
read more about in this chapter and Chapter 15. Server behaviors available
to you vary depending on the server technology you use.
You can get to the Server Behaviors panel by choosing Window➪Server
Behaviors on the Dreamweaver main menu.
You can view the available server behaviors by clicking the plus (+) sign in
the Server Behaviors panel to get the Server Behaviors pop-up menu (see
Figure 14-3). 
The Server Behaviors pop-up menu includes
 Recordset (Query): A recordset stores data from your database for use on
a page or set of pages. I explain recordsets in more detail in this chapter.
 Command (Stored Procedure): Stored procedures are reusable data-
base items that contain SQL code and are commonly used to modify a
database (insert, update, or delete records).

Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

 Repeat Region: This server object displays multiple records on a page.
Repeat Region is most commonly used on HTML tables or HTML table
rows. You can see more about this behavior later in this chapter.
 Recordset Paging: If you have to display a large number of records, and
want them to display a page at a time, this set of behaviors allows you to
navigate from page to page or from record to record.
 Show Region: With this set of server behaviors, you can show or hide
record navigation based on the records displayed. For instance, if you
have Next and Previous links on the bottom of every page and your user
is on the first page or first record of the recordset, you can set a behav-
ior to display only the Next link. The same goes if the user is on the last
page or record — you can set it to hide the Next link and display only
the Previous link.
 Dynamic Text: The Dynamic Text option allows you to display informa-
tion from your recordset anywhere on the page.
 Go to Detail Page: Using this behavior, you can link each record in your
repeated region to a detail page for that particular record. The behavior
also tells the detail page which record’s information to display. 
 Go to Related Page: You can use this behavior to link a particular
dynamic page to another page that contains related information, passing
the parameters of the first page to the related page.
 Insert Record: Use this behavior on a page to add new records to a data-
base via a Web browser.
 Update Record: Use this behavior on a page to update existing records
in a database via a Web browser.
 Delete Record: Use this behavior on a page to permanently delete a
record from a database via a Web browser.
 Dynamic Form Elements: This set of server behaviors turns text fields,
list/menu fields, radio buttons, or check boxes into dynamic form ele-
ments, which you can set to retrieve and display particular information
from a recordset.
 User Authentication: The User Authentication set of behaviors allows
you to log in a user, log out a user, check a username against the infor-
mation in your database, and restrict access to a page.
 XSL Transformation: EXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations
(XSLT) is a language that displays XML data on a Web page after trans-
forming it into HTML. 
 Edit Server Behaviors: Use this option to customize or remove existing
server behaviors. Unless you are very comfortable with coding or SQL, I
advise you not to mess with this option. (If you’re curious about SQL,
see SQL For Dummies, 5th Edition, by Allen G. Taylor, published by Wiley
Publishing, Inc.)
347
Chapter 14: Bringing Data into the Mix

 New Server Behavior: Use this option to create new server behaviors
and add them to the list of existing behaviors. Again, this option is for
the more advanced users who are comfortable with coding.
 Get More Server Behaviors: Use this option to open Dreamweaver
Exchange in your browser. You can use Exchange to download exten-
sions for Dreamweaver. For more information about extensions, see
Chapter 15.
The Components panel
Components are reusable bits of code that you can create and insert directly
into your pages. With Dreamweaver, you can create components for JSP, Cold
Fusion, and ASP.NET pages to consume Web services, display information, or
any other use that you can imagine.

Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

Creating a Recordset
The recordset holds data from your database for use on a page or set of pages
by creating a query. A query gathers information from a database to be used
on a page, selecting only the records matching the fields and conditions you
select for the particular query. The queries for a recordset are built with SQL
(Structured Query Language), but you don’t need to know SQL in order to get
the job done. Dreamweaver writes it all for you. 
With your recordset in place, you can display information from your database
in various ways.
Before you can create a recordset, you must first connect to a database.
Chapter 13 goes over this in more detail.
To define a recordset in Dreamweaver:
1. Open the ASP page that will use the recordset.
2. In the Bindings panel, click the plus sign and select Recordset
(Query).
You see the Recordset dialog box, as shown in Figure 14-4.
3. Enter a name for your recordset in the Name box. 
Usually, adding the letters rs to the beginning of the name is recom-
mended to distinguish it as a recordset in your code, but it isn’t neces-
sary. I used rsContacts in Figure 14-4.

4. Select your connection from the Connection drop-down list.
This list includes any data connections defined from the Databases
panel. Chapter 13 explains how to create a connection.
5. Choose a database table to collect the data for your recordset from
the Table drop-down list.
You can select all the columns or only specific columns of data to be 
displayed.
6. (Optional) If you want the available information to show only records
that meet specific criteria, select a filter from the Filter area. 
7. If you want the displayed records to sort in ascending or descending
order, specify it in the Sort menu by selecting the field by which you
want the records sorted (Name, Phone Number, and so on). 
If you want to tweak the results further and you feel comfortable work-
ing with SQL, you can click the Advanced button to edit the SQL state-
ment directly.
8. To test the connection to the database, click the Test button.
You can find the Databases panel by choosing Window➪Databases on
the main menu. To create more complicated recordsets, click the
Advanced button and you can create SQL statements directly.
If the test is successful, you see a window with the data in the recordset
(similar to Figure 14-5).

9. Click OK to close the Test screen.
10. Click OK to complete the Recordset dialog box.
The Bindings panel shows the recordset (see Figure 14-6). You can
expand it by clicking the plus sign next to the recordset.
Using a Recordset on Your Page
After you create a recordset, you can place the information on your page as
you want. For this section, I made a basic list of all the contacts in the data-
base, with a name, e-mail address, phone number, and Web site URL.
I already built a page with a table showing the appropriate number of cells for
all the dynamic text that I’m inserting (see Figure 14-7). 
After you set up the document the way you want it, you can drag and drop
each data source to its appropriate spot on the page by following these steps:
1. From the Bindings panel, select your first data source and drag it onto
your page, dropping it where you want it to go. 
The name of the dynamic text appears inside curly brackets. You can
now format this piece of text any way you want, treating it like normal
HTML text (see Figure 14-8).

2. Test the result by clicking the LiveData button.
The first record of your database appears in place of the dynamic text
code (see Figure 14-9). To show more than the first record, you need to
define and repeat a region.
Repeating a Region
You probably want to show more than one record at a time on a page that’s
supposed to list all your contacts. You can do this by applying a server
behavior to your region.
A region is any area of a page that displays information from a database on
your page. After you define your region, you can apply a Repeat Region
server behavior, which causes that area to be written to the page over and
over, displaying every record, or as many as you tell it to, in the database
defined by your recordset until all records display. Repeat Region is most
commonly used on HTML tables or table rows.

To add a Repeat Region server behavior to your page:

2. Click the Server Behaviors panel, click the plus (+) sign, and select
Repeat Region from the menu that appears.
The Repeat Region dialog box appears (see Figure 14-10).
3. Select the number of records that you want to show on the page and
then click OK.

Adding a Dynamic Image
Whenever you have a dynamic Web site, images are usually involved,
whether it is a catalog Web site or a news archive. You can bind an image to a
recordset in various easy ways so that your images change depending on the
other parts of the page that are bound to the same recordset. Before you
bind the image, though, you need to take a few preliminary steps:
1. Make sure that you have a field for each record in your database that
lists the actual path of the image for that record. 
For example, if your images reside in a folder called images, one level
above your dynamic page, you enter the following in the image field in
your database: images/imagename.gif, remembering to replace the 
imagename.gif part with the actual filename for each image. 
2. Upload your image folder to the server.
This step is necessary if you want to preview the page with images in
LiveData view.
3. Place a placeholder image in the spot where you want an image to
appear for all the records. 
You can use any of the images in your image folder as a placeholder, or
choose Insert➪Image Object➪Image Placeholder to use the built-in
image placeholder. 
You can find out more about inserting images in Chapter 2.
Binding the Image
After you insert the placeholder image, you can bind images two easy ways —
with the Bindings panel or the Properties inspector.
Follow these steps to bind images using the Bindings panel:
1. Select your placeholder image in the open document.
2. Click the plus (+) sign to expand your recordset. (If you’re using a
Mac, click the triangle.)
3. Select the field in your recordset that contains the name of the 
image file.
4. Click the Bind button at the bottom of the Bindings panel (see 
Figure 14-12).
355
Chapter 14: Bringing Data into the Mix

Follow these steps to bind images using the Properties inspector:
1. Click your placeholder image in the open document to select it.
2. Click the Browse button in the Properties inspector next to the
Src box.
The Select Image Source dialog box appears (see Figure 14-13).
3. In the Select File Name From section (at the top), select the Data
Sources option. 
4. Select the field that contains your image information.
5. Click OK.
The image changes to a tree with a lightning bolt along its side.

Adding Navigation to a Dynamic Page
If your database contains many records, you may opt to show only a small
number of records per page, so that you don’t overwhelm the user. The
Dreamweaver Server Behaviors panel allows you to add navigation to your
pages so that you can move forward or backward through records.
Define your Repeat Region, which I explain how to do earlier in this chapter,
and make sure that you do not select a value large enough to show all
records. You can add button images or text links at the bottom of the page to
indicate some kind of navigation, such as Previous Page and Next Page links.
With the buttons in place, you can activate them by using the Server
Behaviors panel.
For example, to add the navigation movements for the Next and Previous 
buttons:
1. Select the Previous Page button you added in the Document window.
2. Open the Server Behaviors panel.
You can open the Server Behaviors panel by choosing Window➪Server
Behaviors on the main menu.
3. Click the plus (+) sign and select Recordset Paging from the menu 
(see Figure 14-15).
Figure 14-15:
Select
Recordset
Paging and
choose the
appropriate
navigation
movement.
358
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

4. From the submenu, choose the appropriate navigation movement
(Move to Next Record or Move to Previous Record).
The Move to Record dialog box appears, and in most cases, you can just
click OK because the defaults are right.
5. Follow Steps 1 through 4 for the Next button.
6. Choose File➪Preview in Browser and select the browser you set up as
your default preview browser.
You can now page through your records.
That’s a pretty nifty trick. But did you notice that on the first page, the Previous
Page button or link still appears, even though there is no previous page? Not to
worry — a server behavior tells the navigation button when to show up.
1. Click the Previous Page button in the Document window to select it.
2. Click the plus (+) sign in the Server Behaviors panel, and select Show
Region from the menu (see Figure 14-16).
3. If you are working with the Previous Page button, select Show Region
If Not First Record. If you are working with the Next Page button,
select Show Region If Not Last Record.
The Show Region dialog box appears. Usually the selected recordset is
correct, so just click OK.
Figure 14-16:
Select
Show
Region and
make the
appropriate
selection

submenu.
359
Chapter 14: Bringing Data into the Mix

4. Preview in your browser by clicking the Preview in Browser button
on the Document toolbar.
Notice that now when you’re on the first page of records, the Previous
Page button does not show, and when you’re on the last page, the 
Next Page button does not show.
Now that you know how to add navigation to your recordsets, you can get
really fancy and add buttons to go to the first or last record. So if you have, say,
100 pages of records, you can jump from page 1 to page 100 without having to
click Previous Page or Next Page through countless other pages of records. The
server behaviors for those two are Move to Record➪Move to First Record and
Move to Record➪Move to Last Record. It’s pretty useful stuff to know.
Creating a Master-Detail Page Set
A very common way to display information on a Web site is to show a list of
records, such as a list of contacts, with a link to each individual record for
more detailed information.
A master page displays a list of records and a link for each record. When a
user clicks a particular link, a detail page appears with more information
about that record. There are two types of master pages. The first type is a list
of records determined by you. Users can’t alter the list of records on this page;
they can only click to view more information about those records displayed.
The second type is a dynamically created master page. A good example of
this type of master page is a search results page that appears when a user
performs a search for specific records.
A detail page is the page that displays when a user clicks a particular link
from a master page. This page can either display more information about a
record (such as an online catalog), or it can be set up for administrative pur-
poses, such as updating or deleting a record.
Creating a Master-Detail page requires just a few clicks of the mouse. Using
the functions described earlier in this chapter, create a page that lists all your
contacts. This is your master page. Next, create the page you use as the
detail page. Now you’re ready to create the Master-Detail Page Set:
1. Open the page you created to be the master page and choose Insert➪
Application Objects➪Master Detail Page Set.
The Insert Master-Detail Page Set dialog box opens (see Figure 14-17).
The top part of the dialog box is for defining the properties of the
master page. The bottom part is for defining the detail page.
360
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

2. Select the recordset from the drop-down list that you use for your
master page.
3. Next to Master Page Fields, use the plus (+) and minus (–) signs to 
add or remove fields that you want or don’t want to display on the
master page.
4. Select the field from which you want to provide a link to the detail
page for each record.
For example, if you list a bunch of contacts, you can use the contact’s
name as the link to the detail.
5. In the Pass Unique Key drop-down list, usually the default is correct; if
it is not, select the unique identifier that you want to pass on to the
detail page.
6. Select the number of records you want to show at one time on the
master page.
Showing only a partial listing is okay because you can add navigation to
view more records.
7. Type the filename for the detail page in the Detail Page Name text box
or click the Browse button to search for the file.
Figure 14-17:
The Insert
Master-
Detail 
Page Set
dialog box.
361
Chapter 14: Bringing Data into the Mix

8. Just as with the Master Page section, use the plus and minus signs to
add or remove fields that you want or don’t want to show on the
detail page.
9. Click OK.
Dreamweaver automatically adds all the necessary recordset information and
SQL code for you to begin using your Master-Detail Page Set. Everything from
navigation to record status is in there. 
After you create the master and detail pages, you may want to rearrange and
format the fields in a way that is more aesthetic because Dreamweaver just
plops the stuff onto the pages, which looks really generic. For example, you
can change the column labels to read in a friendlier way. You can also format
the font, color, and size, add padding to the table cells, and change the order
of the columns.

Using Forms to Manage 
Your Dynamic Web Site
In This Chapter

 Creating a search page
 Editing a database
 Finding out the basic elements of e-commerce
D
ynamic Web sites let you do a lot more than provide content and prod-
uct listings to your Web site visitors. You can use Dreamweaver to
create various types of forms that serve many useful purposes. Some exam-
ples include a login page so that users can register to use your Web site, a
search page so that users can search your Web site for specific information, a
shopping cart system for e-commerce, or a data entry form to safely allow
non-technical data-entry personnel to easily edit the content of a Web site.
Establishing User Authentication
One of the good things about a dynamic Web site is that you can retain a lot
more control over it, from who can view it and how much a user can view, to
who can edit it and how much that person can edit. You can also assign dif-
ferent users different levels of access depending on criteria that you deter-
mine. For example, you may have an employee directory online that all
employees can use to look up departmental information, titles, and phone
extensions. However, if that directory also contains every employee’s home
phone number and home address, you wouldn’t want the entire company to
have access to everyone’s personal information, right? The Dreamweaver User
Authentication Server Behavior enables you to create different levels of access
that restrict the kind of information a user can see; so you can make things
such as personal information something only certain people may access.

Creating a login page
In the first exercise for this chapter, you create a user login form that checks
information against a database. I use a sample database of employees that
contains the following fields:
 Employee number
 Password
 Last name
 First name
 Department
 Title
 Access level
If you want to use a prebuilt database, I have provided a sample database
called employees.mdb on my Web site at www.digitalfamily.com/dwd. 
I created it using Microsoft Access 2000.
After you have a database in place, create a page that contains a form with
the following fields: a Username text box, a Password text box, and a Submit
button. Refer to Chapter 12 for more details on how to create a form. Next,
create a Data Source Name (DSN), database connection, and recordset that
contains your employee number, last name, first name, password, depart-
ment, title, and access level. Check out Chapters 13 and 14 if you need a
quick review on this stuff.
Now that you have everything in place, you’re ready to add user authentica-
tion to your form. These steps walk you through the setup for user authenti-
cation on a company’s employee directory. I use the employee number as the
username.
1. Select the form and click the plus sign (+) in the Server Behaviors
panel (see Figure 15-1).
Selecting a form in Dreamweaver can be a little bit tricky sometimes. A
quick way to select the entire form is to click anywhere inside the form
and then select the word form from the status bar at the bottom of the
Dreamweaver window. This selects the entire form.
2. From the menu, select User Authentication and select Log In User
from the submenu that appears.
The Log In User dialog box appears (see Figure 15-2).
364
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

3. In the Get Input From Form field, enter the form name.
Naming forms is good practice, especially if you have a page with multi-
ple forms. Naming your forms makes each one easier to identify within
the code.

In User
dialog box.
Figure 15-1:

cation menu

365
Chapter 15: Using Forms to Manage Your Dynamic Web Site

4. Enter the name of the appropriate text box from your form in the
Username Field and Password Field boxes.
In my example, the username field is called user, and the password field
is called pass.
5. From the Validate Using Connection and Table drop-down lists, make
the appropriate selections.
Select the connection and table that corresponds to your user database.
For example, if you’re using the sample employees.mdb table, you’d use
the Employees connection and the employees table.
6. From the Username Column and Password Column drop-down lists,
select the fields in your database that are used to verify the username
and password provided by the user at login.
Because I use the employee number as the username, I selected that
field as my Username Column, but if you have a specific username field
in your database you select that one instead.
At the time of this writing, Dreamweaver expects the username field to
be a text field. If you decide to use a field such as an employee number,
make sure that it is defined as a text field in the database or the page
won’t work.
7. Enter the name of the page where users are redirected if the login 
succeeds.
If you want to use this as a generic page for logins, then check the 
Go to Previous URL box as well. That way, after a user tries to access 
a restricted page and is sent to this login page, the user is sent back 
to the restricted page after entering the correct username and pass-
word. Find out more about restricted pages in the following section,
“Restricting access to pages.”
In my example, the page is directory.asp, which is the actual
employee directory listing.
8. Enter the name of the page where users are redirected if the login fails.
You can direct them to the same login page, or you can create a sec-
ondary login page that looks like the first one but contains an error 
message saying something like That username and/or password is
incorrect. Please try again.
9. Select Restrict Access Based on Username and Password.
If you want to further control access for users with a certain access level
(say, Manager or Employee), you can define that in this area as well. The
effect is that only the users in the database whose access level matches
366
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

what you specify are taken to the login success page. The rest are redi-
rected to the login failed page.
10. Click OK.
You can now preview this page in your browser and test the form by entering
a username and password from your database.
Restricting access to pages
When you have a page you want to restrict (such as a user detail page) and a
login page, you are ready to go. In the following steps, I assume that the name
of the page that you want to restrict access to is directory.asp, that the
name of your login page is user_auth.asp, and the Go To Previous URL
option is defined for the login page (see the previous section, “Creating a
login page,” for more information).
To restrict access to a Web page, follow these steps:
1. Open employeeDirectory.asp or whichever page you want to restrict.
2. In the Server Behaviors panel, click the plus sign and choose User
Authentication➪Restrict Access to Page from the menu.
The Restrict Access to Page dialog box opens (see Figure 15-3).
You can open the Server Behaviors panel by choosing Window➪Server
Behaviors from the main menu.
3. Select Restrict Based on Username and Password.
4. Type the name of your login page in the If Access Denied, Go To box. 
I used user_auth.asp. When users try to access this page directly,
they’re sent to user_auth.asp to log in before they can see this page.

The Restrict
Access 
to Page
dialog box.

Chapter 15: Using Forms to Manage Your Dynamic Web Site

5. Click OK.
6. Press F12 to preview the page in your default browser.
Instead of the Employee Directory page, you see the user login page.
Type a valid username and password to view the Employee Directory.
Securing Sensitive Information 
on Your Web Site
You can take security measures that help make your sensitive information
more secure on the Web (some steps are for more advanced users):
 Carefully choose the passwords you use. Especially choose carefully
for your FTP, database, and the admin login area of your Web site. Too
often people use common words, names, and number combinations as
passwords that are easy for hackers to figure out. An effective password
consists of mixed letters and numbers — the more random the better —
and is also a mix of upper- and lowercase letters whenever possible.
 Protect your development machine. Many Web site break-ins are inside
jobs, where someone from within the company itself obtains the sensi-
tive information because he or she has access to the Web site files. If
your development machine is on a network and you must grant access
to it, grant only restricted access.
 On your Web server, turn Directory Browsing off. Do this so folders
without an index page don’t display everything that’s in them. If you’re
not the administrator for your Web server or don’t know how to do this,
ask a technical support representative at your hosting company to
either walk you through it or do it for you. It’s a fairly simple step.
 Pages that require authentication, such as directory.asp from the
previous example, should have code on that page that kicks out users
who didn’t log in to get to that page. This way if someone happens to
access the file without using the login page, they are sent elsewhere (see
“Restricting access to pages,” earlier in the chapter). One of the easiest
ways to do this is with a cookie — of the ASP variety, not chocolate chip!
In fact, this is how Dreamweaver’s Server Behaviors does it behind the
scenes. You can find out more about cookies and ASP in Beginning Active
Server Pages 3.0 by David Buser, et al. (published by Wrox Press).
 Don’t use an Access database for a serious Web site. Not only is it slow,
but stealing the info is simple because it’s typically a single file. Even if a
malicious person doesn’t know SQL, he or she may be able to find the
368
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

Access file and read it off your Web server. If you are using an Access
database, make sure it is stored in a folder outside the root folder of
your Web site. 
 Keep your database on a dedicated machine, away from direct Internet
access. You can buff up database security by allowing only your Web
server to access that machine through a local network infrastructure. 
 Use SSL technology to encrypt sensitive information sent back and
forth from the server. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a form of encryp-
tion, developed originally by Netscape, used by Web servers and Web
browsers to exchange sensitive information. You can find more about
encryption and SSL at http://computer.howstuffworks.com/
encryption.htm.
 Don’t copy and paste complex snippets of code that you found on the
Web unless you absolutely trust the source and checked out all the
stops. Some hackers look for sites running this type of widely used code,
and those who know its specific vulnerabilities can easily gain access to
your machine. 
Please keep in mind that the Dreamweaver Login Authentication can be a
pretty basic method of restricting access to a page if you follow only the basic
steps outlined in this book. An amateur hacker can quite possibly find your
database, figure out passwords, or bypass the login page altogether to get to
the information he or she wants. If you’re building a site that contains sensi-
tive information and you are not very familiar with Web site security, consider
hiring a consultant to advise you. At the very least, read up on the subject so
you can get a better understanding of the security risks you may encounter.
Web Security, Privacy and Commerce by Simson Garfinkel (published by
O’Reilly & Associates) provides a very thorough look into the subject.
Searching for Database Records
With Dreamweaver, you can create a form to search for records on your data-
base using specific criteria. This is pretty useful if you have a large database.
You don’t want to make your users read through pages and pages of listings,
whether they are employee records, or products, or anything else. Providing
a search form allows your users to quickly find the information they want.
In this section, you discover a simple way to implement a database search on
your dynamic Web site.
369
Chapter 15: Using Forms to Manage Your Dynamic Web Site

Setting up the search page
The search page is the simplest part to set up. All you need is a form with an
action that goes to the results page, a form text field, and a Submit button:
1. Create a new page that contains a form with the fields you want your
users to search.
Check out Chapter 12 to go over forms in more detail. 
I use an employee directory database, so my text field is Lname, which
allows my users to search by employee last names.
2. In the Action field in the Properties inspector, enter the name of the
results page. 
See the next section to find out how to create this page.
My result page is called search_results.asp.
3. Save this page.
Setting up the results page
The results page is a little bit more complex than the search page. The search
actually takes place on this page, behind the scenes on the server, and what
you see is only the result of that search. The text field that you determine in
the search page is referred to as the form variable in the results page. The
information you enter in this form is passed on to the results page in order
for the search to take place.
1. Create a new page that contains a table with a column for each field
you want to show in the results. 
2. Create a connection and a recordset for this page using the database
or table from which you want to bring in the results. 
See Chapters 13 and 14 if you need more detailed information on how to
do this.
3. In the Recordset dialog box (see Figure 15-4), select the appropriate
connection and table.
4. Next to Filter drop-down list, select the column that corresponds with
the field with which you want your users to search. 
5. In the drop-down list directly below the Filter drop-down list, select
Form Variable, and then enter the name of the text field element from
your search form in the text box next to it.
370
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

6. In the Sort field, select the field by which you want to sort your results. 
7. Click OK.
8. Drag each field from your recordset in the Bindings panel to the appro-
priate column on the table in your results page. (See Figure 15-5.) 
Chapter 13 shows you how to drag and drop fields.

371
Chapter 15: Using Forms to Manage Your Dynamic Web Site

9. Transfer your pages to the server and open your search page in a
browser. Try searching for one of the entries in your database. The
search finds the entry and lists it in your search results page, showing
every field you requested on the results page.
I searched for Hodges, and Figure 15-6 shows my search results. 
If you want to return more than one matching row, you need to define a
region and use the Repeat Region server behavior. You can find out more
about this in Chapter 14.
That’s it. Painless, right? This is a database search in its simplest form. The
more advanced your understanding of Dreamweaver and the SQL language
gets, the more complex you can make your search forms. Users with a basic
understanding of SQL can enhance this page to search using multiple criteria,
filter out search results, sort by various fields, and even display only certain
results depending on the access level of the person performing the search.

Using forms is also an easy way to perform data-entry tasks on a database
without having to open the database application. In fact, the person perform-
ing those tasks doesn’t even need to know how a database works in order to
use the form. All the work is done right in the browser window. Through the
form, a user can add, update, or delete a record from the database.

Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

Say a manager wants to add a new employee and update some information in
an employee directory for various employees who just received promotions.
Using Dreamweaver, you can create a user-friendly interface where this man-
ager can go to his browser, log in, and make those changes to the database.
He can save his changes right there in his browser and view the updated
information instantly, all without ever having to open a database application
(such as Access).
You can secure content management pages (such as those discussed in this
section) from the public by using the authentication features of Dreamweaver
covered at the beginning of this chapter.
Adding a record to your database
A record in a database (a row) consists of a complete set of all the fields in
the database.
In this section, you use a form to add a record to a database. Before starting,
you must create a new dynamic page and connect it to the database you’re
editing. If you need to refresh your memory on how to do this, see Chapter 13.
After you create your page, you’re ready to use the Dreamweaver Record
Insertion Form Wizard Application Object. In one easy step, this Application
Object Wizard creates a script that allows you to add a record to a database.
It also creates the form with which you make the addition.
An application object lets you create a more complex function in one easy step.
Follow these steps to add a record using a form:
1. Open your new page and place the cursor where you want the form 
to start.
2. Choose Insert➪Application Objects➪Insert Record➪Record Insertion
Form Wizard.
The Record Insertion Form dialog box opens (see Figure 15-7).
3. Select the appropriate database connection, select the appropriate
table from that database, and then enter the name of the page the
user is redirected to after the new addition is made.
4. In the Form Fields section of the dialog box, verify that all the fields
display. 
In the Label column, you can change the actual name of the column by
clicking a field from the list and editing the Label text. You can also
373
Chapter 15: Using Forms to Manage Your Dynamic Web Site

determine what kind of form field (text, radio button, select menu) and
what type of formatting (numeric, text, and so on) is used for each field.
If any field has a default value, you can define that in this dialog box 
as well.
If your database table has an auto-number field (a field that the database
automatically numbers sequentially for each record), you cannot submit
data for that field; it needs to be removed from the Form Fields area.
5. Click OK.
You can now test your page (see Figure 15-8). Simply upload the page to your
server, open it in your browser, and enter all the information for a new record.
Click the Insert Record button. Your new record shows up in the database.
Upload the Connections folder when you upload your site files to the appli-
cation server; otherwise, you get an ASP Include File Not Found error
message.
When you create the database connection (refer to Chapter 13), a Connec-
tions folder is added to your site on the local drive. The ASP files in the
Connections folder store necessary information that makes your page work
correctly with the database. This type of file is typically called an include file
because its content is referenced by the code in another page. Dreamweaver
automatically includes the content of this file on any page you create that
uses this database connection.
Figure 15-7:

Insertion
Form 
dialog box.

Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

Updating a record via a browser
To edit or update a record from a database, you first need to create a search
form to search for the record you want to update, or a master page list where
you can pick out the record. After you find the record, the Update Record
form appears, which is where you perform the actual update.
Follow these steps to update an existing record:
1. On a new page, create a simple search form with a text field element
and a Submit button.
See the “Searching for Database Records” section, earlier in this chapter,
if you need a refresher on creating search forms.
2. Select the text field on your page, and in the Properties inspector,
replace textfield with a more descriptive name. For example,
mysearch.
This name helps differentiate one text field from another on a page that
contains multiple fields.
3. Create a recordset, and filter by the field that you use as your search
criteria.
I used Employee Number (EmpNo) as my search criteria.
Figure 15-8:
The Record
Insertion
Form in
action.
375
Chapter 15: Using Forms to Manage Your Dynamic Web Site

4. From the drop-down list directly below the Filter list, select Form
Variable. Next to Form Variable, type the name of the text field from
your search form. In my case, I typed mysearch.
5. Click OK.
6. Choose Insert➪Application Objects➪Update Record➪Record Update
Form Wizard.
The Update Record dialog box opens (see Figure 15-9).
7. Select the appropriate connection and table.
8. In the After Updating, Go To text box, enter the name of the page you
want to show after the update is made.
I use employeeDirectory.asp, which is my default employee directory
page.
9. In the Form Elements box, make sure that the field labels are correct,
or rename them to what you want to display on the update form. You
can rename them later on your page by selecting and replacing the
text for each field directly on your page. 
10. Click OK.
A new form appears on your page. You can format the look of the form
(font, color, and so on) to make it match the rest of your site.
11. Select the Server Behaviors panel and click the plus sign (+). From the
menu, choose Show Region➪Show Region If Recordset Is Not Empty.
This last step ensures that you don’t get an error if no recordset
matches the criteria you enter into the search field.
Your Update form is now complete (see Figure 15-10).
Figure 15-9:
The Update
Record
dialog box.
376
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

You can test the new page by previewing it in your browser. Enter a value that
you know exists in that field in your database and click the Submit button.
The Record Update form is now populated with the information for that
record. You can now make any changes to that record and click the Update
Record button to save the changes to the database. The next time you view
that record online, the changes appear (see Figure 15-11).

Chapter 15: Using Forms to Manage Your Dynamic Web Site

E-Commerce Basics
Most people who want a Web site are certain about one thing: They want to
make money from it. The era of the brochure site is no more, my friends.
People hawk everything from fine china to soil from the Holy Land on the
Internet (I kid you not about that one). E-commerce helps bring together
shoppers and sellers on the Internet.
In the rest of this chapter, I tell you more about what an e-commerce Web site
is and what you need to have in place in order to create a fully functional 
e-commerce site. However, if you’re looking for information on how to create
an e-commerce site right out of the box with Dreamweaver, stop here. It’s not
going to happen. I don’t know why the powers that be over at Macromedia
haven’t included this feature yet. To be quite frank, I think this is really one 
of the only major flaws I can find with Dreamweaver. You can create an 
e-commerce Web site using Dreamweaver, but it requires an extension, 
which I go into in just a moment.
What puts the e-commerce into 
an e-commerce Web site?
An e-commerce Web site, in a nutshell, is a Web site that accepts real-time
payments for goods and services. For example, if you’re looking for a weight
loss supplement you can go to www.MetabolicNutrition.com, browse
offerings in its weight loss product line, and have one shipped to you
overnight. 
Not all e-commerce Web sites are the same — many companies have built
customized tools to aid users in the shopping process. For example, Meta-
bolic Nutrition also allows you to store your shipping information so that 
you don’t have to enter it every time you order. It also has a virtual personal
assistant that recommends products based on your health, age, diet, and
lifestyle. 
The cost of an e-commerce Web site is significantly more than the cost of
building a regular Web site because you have to figure in several third-party
costs. Here’s a quick run-down of the minimal (traditional) e-commerce
requirements:
 A shopping cart: A shopping cart is a series of scripts and applications
that displays items from your database, allows users to pick and choose
which ones they want, and then collects payment and shipping informa-
tion. Some Web-hosting accounts come with shopping carts included. A
popular one is Miva Merchant (www.miva.com). Various Dreamweaver
shopping cart extensions are also worth looking into. For example, PDG
378
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

Software (www.pdgsoft.com) offers a Dreamweaver extension that pro-
vides full integration with PDG’s shopping cart with a price tag of about
$400 for a lifetime license.
 A merchant account: This is literally an account with a bank or a finan-
cial institution that allows you to accept credit cards from your clients.
Many merchant account providers also offer payment gateways and vir-
tual terminals as a suite, which can save you money and time. Costs and
transactions fees vary, as service providers set their own prices. Online
Data Corp (www.onlinedatacorp.com) is a good one. 
 A payment gateway and virtual terminal: A payment gateway is what
ties your shopping cart to your merchant account. A virtual terminal is
like an electronic bookkeeper and cash register in one — you can view
your Web site transactions, issue refunds, and manage orders. The two
most popular packages are the VeriSign PayFlow Pro and PayFlow Link
(www.verisign.com). 
 A secure site certificate: This encrypts information between your Web
site and the client’s computer to protect the information from being
stolen as you make your purchase online. This is commonly referred to
as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. Verisign and Thawte’s 128-bit
certificates are popular picks. If you’re on a shared Web-hosting account,
you may be able to share the server’s certificate to save money; how-
ever, this is often regarded as unprofessional, because the security cer-
tificate doesn’t display your company name on it — shoppers who
check it see your Web-hosting company’s name instead.
The definition of what a traditional e-commerce Web site is continues to
change as new technologies and application service providers emerge.
Services such as Yahoo! Stores allow you to create a site without purchasing
any of the previously mentioned items. PayPal.com offers all-inclusive 
e-commerce services with free shopping cart tools.
Premade shopping carts and e-commerce systems save you time and money
up front, and buying one is the fastest way to get a business online. The down-
side of using a premade shopping cart is that you often can’t make it look like
an integral part of your Web site, meaning that you usually have limited control
over the graphical elements on shopping-cart–driven pages. Also, most shop-
ping carts use their own databases and give you limited access to the code
(because a lot of it may be compiled CGI, which Dreamweaver can’t read), so
you may run into brick walls when trying to build new features that you didn’t
buy out of the box.
Considering the investment and risk, many companies prefer to hire a profes-
sional programming team to create a system from scratch that looks and
functions exactly how they want it to. Amazon.com, for example, has spent
millions on its system to make it the incredibly smart and easy-to-use system
it is today. But you don’t have to break the bank — many very successful
custom-built e-commerce Web sites are created for less than the cost of a
used ’94 Toyota Camry.

Extending Dreamweaver 
one feature at a time
At last count, a few minutes ago, Dreamweaver has 109 e-commerce-related
extensions on the Macromedia Web site, from stand-alone shopping carts to a
PayPal extension that allows shoppers to pay you via PayPal directly from
your Web site.
However, e-commerce is just the proverbial ol’ tip of the iceberg when extend-
ing Dreamweaver. At the Macromedia Exchange Web site, you can download
an extension for just about any functionality your Web site can have.
You can add extensions to Dreamweaver two ways. The first is by going
directly to the Web site at www.macromedia.com/cfusion/exchange/
index.cfm?view=sn120. 
The other way to access Macromedia Exchange is through Dreamweaver
itself. You must be connected to the Internet in order for this to work. This
can be done from various points within the application: 
 From the Insert menu: Choose Insert➪Get More Objects
 From the Commands menu: Choose Commands➪Get More Commands
 From the Help menu: Choose Help➪Dreamweaver Exchange
 From the Server Behaviors panel: Click the plus sign (+) and then select
Get More Server Behaviors
 From the Bindings panel: Click the plus sign (+) and then select Get
More Data Sources
 From the Behaviors panel: Click the plus sign (+) and then select Get
More Behaviors
 From the Insert Flash Button dialog box: Click the Get More Styles button
 From the New Document window: Click the Get More Content button
When you are on Macromedia Exchange, if this is your first time there, you
must register before downloading any extensions. Also, you need to make
sure that your Extension Manager (which comes with Dreamweaver) is
installed and running.
If you register and have the Extension Manager on your system, you can
search for extensions and download them to your system. You can also
choose to download the extensions (.mxp files) onto your computer and install
380
Part V: Working with Dynamic Content 

them using the manager, or you can choose to install them on the spot, which
downloads and installs the extension from the Web without saving the instal-
lation file on your hard drive.
You can run the Extension Manager for installing an extension in various
ways. In Dreamweaver, you can choose Commands➪Manage Extensions. You
must have a document open. In Windows, you can go to Start➪Programs➪
Macromedia➪Macromedia Extension Manager. You can also launch it by
double-clicking an .mxp file in Explorer. On a Mac, you can run the Extension
Manager by going to Help➪Manage Extensions.
When you open Extension Manager, you see all the extensions you installed
on your system. To view the description for any of these extensions, simply
click it once, and any pertinent information displays in the lower pane of the
Extension Manager window.
Ready to add some extensions? Choose File➪Install Extension and follow the
simple prompts to have your new extension up and running in no time.
Uninstalling is just as simple: Choose File➪Remove Extension, and voilà!

D
reamweaver has become the clear choice of professional Web designers
and is the program behind many of the best-designed sites on the Web.
Many of the sites featured in this chapter take advantage of the latest Web
technologies, integrating Dynamic HTML, Flash, and more to create vivid 
animations and powerful interactivity. 
The sites featured in this chapter provide an excellent overview of what you
can do with Dreamweaver — and they’re all great examples of what’s possi-
ble on the Web today. Review the descriptions of these sites to discover what
tools the designers used and how they made these great Web sites. Then
spend some time online, visiting each site to appreciate the full impact of
their design, navigation, and other features.

The Growing Digital Family
www.digitalfamily.com
With the help of my friends at www.grupow.com, I created the Digital Family
Web site, shown in Figure 16-1, for my book, Creating Family Web Sites For
Dummies (published by Wiley Publishing, Inc.). This site is designed for
anyone who wants to create a Web site for a wedding, new baby, reunion, or
any of the seemingly unlimited number of personal uses that have become
popular on the Internet.
DigitalFamily.com is an example of how many authors, like myself, are creating
Web sites to complement their books and provide updated information
between revisions. It should be no surprise that I used Dreamweaver to create
my newest Web site, relying heavily on the table layout features to create the
page designs and the template features to make adding pages fast and easy, as
well as to maintain a consistent design theme throughout the site. 
You discover how to design templates in Chapter 4 and how to use the
Layout features to create tables in Chapter 6.

The Hum of World Journalism
www.worldhum.com
The World Hum Web site is an online travel magazine that focuses on destina-
tion journalism, offering tips on where to go, where to stay, and what to do.
World Hum is run by editors Jim Benning and Michael Yessis. In 2005, World
Hum began to work with Web design company Hop Studios to bring the site
up to date, adding many of the bells and whistles of modern Web design: an
RSS feed, a blog, a mailing list, search, CSS-powered design, comments, and
contextual ads.
Behind a powerful content management system sits a set of templates and
style sheets developed using Dreamweaver. In particular, the designers relied
on Dreamweaver’s style sheet capabilities to create a design that looks and
feels the same from browser to browser, computer to computer.
The result is a Web site that is easily updated by its editors, who rely on the
stability of the underlying code so that they can spend time thinking about
where to take their readers next. (Chapter 4 covers Dreamweaver’s template
features.)
Listen to the Tracks at UnSound
www.unsoundtracks.com
Musician and composer Stefan Girardet’s work has been featured in film and
on television. When he decided to put up a Web site showcasing his work,
Stefan turned to Web design company Hop Studios with a challenge: create a
Web site design as organic and abstract as his music.
If the design wasn’t a challenge, Stefan’s ideas about handling the playback of
his music were! The UnSound Tracks Web site, shown in Figure 16-2, includes
a sample library (in MP3 format) of Stefan’s musical compositions. 
Stefan wanted visitors to the Web site to be able to sample his work without
having to load hundreds of Web pages or get lost in a confusing navigational
structure. 
Hop Studios addressed the challenge by developing a way to integrate music
directly into the page using layers and JavaScript programming. The site’s
complex code was made easier by using Dreamweaver’s built-in tools for han-
dling layers and behaviors that together give the user a seamless listening
experience. (Find out how you can do similar tricks in Chapter 9.)

Friends of Washoe
www.friendsofwashoe.org 
www.cwu.edu/~cwuchci
The Chimpanzee and Human Communication Institute runs a sanctuary for
some very special chimpanzees in central Washington. Washoe and her
family use American Sign Language to communicate with each other and 
with humans. Washoe is the first non-human animal to use sign language 
with humans.
The institute runs two Web sites, one at www.friendsofwashoe.org (shown
in Figure 16-3) for the public and for students interested in learning about the
chimps. The second, which focuses on its academic research and opportuni-
ties, is at www.cwu.edu/~cwuchci. Keeping the two sites updated is a chal-
lenge met with equanimity by Institute staff using Dreamweaver, along with 
a few graphics programs.
Dreamweaver’s Check In/Check Out feature helps keep staff members 
from overwriting each other’s work. Their Web design team appreciated
Dreamweaver’s site-management features when redesigning these sites in
2004, and they all use Library items to keep the navigation bars updated and
in sync. (You find instructions for using Dreamweaver’s site-management fea-
tures, such as Check In/Check Out and Library items in Chapter 4.)

Alliance Environmental Group, Inc.
www.alliance-enviro.com
Alliance Environmental Group is an environmental contractor that specializes
in commercial and residential air duct cleaning and demolition. Alliance also
specializes in the safe removal of asbestos, lead paint, and other hazardous
materials. Alliance is known for taking on big projects. When a home that 
was being fumigated exploded after a gas line was left open, Alliance staff
responded quickly, repairing and cleaning up damage to 115 homes. 
When Joe Mclean, president of Alliance Environmental Group, commissioned
a redesign from Web design company Hop Studios, he wanted to get the twin
messages of reliability and safety across to his customers by showcasing
actual projects and customer testimonials.
Together with Alliance staff, Hop Studios reworked the site’s user interface
(shown in Figure 16-4) and organizational structure, looking for ways to
implement consistent elements and timesaving features. Dreamweaver’s
Library items and templates were especially helpful, and a powerful and 
carefully crafted style sheet keeps design and formatting consistent.

The Alliance staff updates the Web site using Macromedia Contribute, which
works in concert with Dreamweaver to ensure smooth updates, revision
saves, and consistent pages. (You find out how to create templates that work
in Dreamweaver and Contribute in Chapter 4, and how to design style sheets
in Chapter 8.)
Film Radar
www.filmradar.com/
Living in Hollywood is wonderful for a film fanatic, but the choice of movies
in cinema’s capital city can be overwhelming. Film Radar, shown in Figure
16-5, offers a guide to the best of the more interesting, obscure, specialty, and
independent films screening in Los Angeles. Editor Karie Bible maintains the
complex calendars and reviews as a one-woman-band using Dreamweaver.
She needed a site that was — above all — reliable, with code optimized to
handle nearly constant updating. Web design company Hop Studios turned to
Dreamweaver to build code that could meet those demands after it was inte-
grated into a complex underlying publishing system.

For example, the complex HTML tables that make up the navigation would
have been almost impossible to create by hand — Dreamweaver made the
layout a snap. For the dynamic pages of the calendar, mockups were created
in Dreamweaver, and then given to the programmer to have appropriate pro-
gramming code inserted. (Chapter 6 covers creating tables in Dreamweaver.)
Cartooning in Marin
www.klemieux.com/
Kathryn LeMieux is an award-winning cartoonist and fine art painter. Over
the years her work for the Point Reyes Light newspaper in Western Marin
County has won numerous California Newspaper Publisher Awards. Besides
Feral West, she is one of the SIX CHIX, and contributes to that nationally syn-
dicated comic strip. If you study the work on her Web site, you’ll also dis-
cover that she is very fond of cows.
When Kathryn wanted to create a Web site for her comics and artwork, she
turned to Sheila Castelli at DigitalCottage.com. Sheila used Photoshop CS and
Dreamweaver to convert Kathryn’s creative page designs into a user-friendly
Web site shown in Figure 16-6. Because she’s an artist and cartoonist, this site
is filled with big, colorful images.

A Quiet Retreat
www.blackheroninn.com
The Black Heron Inn, shown in Figure 16-7, was created by professional Web
designer Sheila Castelli (www.DigitalCottage.com). Sheila’s goal was to
create a clean, elegant design that prominently featured the views and archi-
tecture of this lovely bed and breakfast in Northern California. To capture the
large windows that look out at the rolling hills of Point Reyes, Sheila opti-
mized the photos on this site and set them off with a simple design, using
tables to keep everything in place.
You can find more about image formats, optimization, and aligning text and
images in Chapter 5. For tips and tricks that help you use tables to create

Dreamweaver, the Professional’s Choice
www.hopstudios.com/
Dreamweaver is the clear choice of most professional Web designers these
days, including those at Hop Studios, a Web design company in Vancouver
owned and managed by one of the contributors to this book, Susannah
Gardner.
Although Dreamweaver is great for the kinds of large, complex sites Susannah
often creates for clients, you can also use it for sites with a bent for simplic-
ity, such as her own company site shown in Figure 16-8. 
Susannah chose Dreamweaver because she wanted the site to be quick load-
ing, easy to navigate, and fun to use. Using Dreamweaver as the primary pro-
duction tool has allowed the designers at Hop Studios to focus their energy
on making a site that shows off their skills and talents, without taking too
much time away from their clients. (You find design tips in Chapter 17 and
timesaving tips for getting the most out of Dreamweaver in Chapter 18.)

Yours Truly
www.JCWarner.com/
I would love to take credit for the design of my own Web site (see Figure 16-9),
but the truth is that my talented friend, Ivonne Berkowitz, came up with the
design. I did build the site myself based on her design, and of course, I use
Dreamweaver’s great features to update and maintain it regularly. I’ve more
than mastered the development of a Web site, but when it came time to make
sure my site looked good, I turned to an expert, someone who was doing noth-
ing but design work fulltime. 
As the Web has gotten more complex, and the design standards higher, most
good Web sites require a team of experts. Don’t expect to be able to do every-
thing yourself — seek out professional designers, programmers, writers, and
editors when you need them to produce the best site possible. (And don’t
overlook your personal contacts. My mother, Malinda McCain, edits my site.
She’s a professional, too, with her own copy editing business, which you can
find more about at www.sharewords.com/copyedit.)

Ten Web Site Ideas You Can Use
In This Chapter
 Designing for your audience
 Making your Web site easy to read
 Appreciating good design practices
 Preparing for the unexpected 
 Backing it up
A
ll good Web sites grow and evolve. If you start with a strong design and
pay close attention to some basic rules about interface, navigation, and
style, you have a better foundation to build on. The following design ideas
can help you create a compelling Web site that grows gracefully.
Design for Your Audience
No matter how technically sophisticated a Web site is or how great the writ-
ing, most people notice the design first. Make sure that you leave plenty of
time and budget to develop an appropriate and attractive design for your Web
site. The right design is one that best suits your audience — that may or may
not mean lots of fancy graphics and animations.
Think about who you want to attract to your Web site before you develop the
design. A gaming Web site geared toward teenagers should look very different
from a Web site with gardening tips or an online banking site for adults.
Review other sites designed for your target market. Consider your audience’s
time constraints and attention span, and, most important, consider your
audience’s goals. If you design your site to provide information to busy busi-
nesspeople, you want fast-loading pages with few graphics and little or no
animation. If you design your site for entertainment, your audience may be
willing to wait a little longer for animation and other interactive features.

Add Search Features with Google
If you’re looking for an easy way to add a search engine to your Web site, con-
sider using Google’s AdSense service. This feature is tied into Google’s adver-
tising model and can even help you bring in more revenue if you have enough
traffic on your site.
Google’s search tools enable you to add a Web search section to your site,
with a site search option that lets visitors choose to search the pages of 
your site. The program is free to use, but does require an application and
approval. Google claim it’s for businesses of all sizes, so even if you’re rela-
tively small, you may benefit from this service.
Visit www.google.com/services/websearch.html to find out more about
paid search services, or visit www.google.com/searchcode.html for an
easier option that doesn’t give financial credit.
Use PDFs When They’re Warranted
Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF) has become increasingly popular
on the Internet, and with good reason. Now that Acrobat Reader is widely dis-
tributed and even built into more recent browser versions, you can assume
that most of your audience can read files in PDF.
Unfortunately, like many popular technologies, PDF has been overused and,
dare I say, become a trick for people who don’t want to take the time to
design their pages in HTML. PDF is best used for files that you want to make
easy to download in their entirety to be saved on someone’s hard drive, as
well as documents that you want to print exactly as they were designed.
However, PDF is not as fast as HTML, not as easy to browse and navigate, and
the text is not searched by most search engines, making it harder for people
to find your words. By all means, use PDF when it’s warranted — it’s a great
option — but don’t use it when HTML pages would be more accessible.
Indeed, the best designers often provide both options to visitors, offering a
text file in PDF that is easy to download or print and another version of the
same content in HTML that is easy to browse or read online.
Let Visitors Enlarge Your Type
Although it is possible with CSS styles to disable a Web browser’s capability
to override your font size choices, please don’t. Many of your visitors have
adjusted their own systems to enlarge the text on Web sites because they
398
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

can’t read the small type that young Web designers prefer. Respect your
elders (and anyone else who prefers larger type), and don’t restrict their 
ability to resize the words on your pages — especially if you actually want
them to read it. 
If you really want to make it easy on your visitor’s eyes, format your text with
tags and options that use relative sizes, such as the Header tags (H1, H2, and
so on) and use percents or the small, medium, and large font sizes instead of
absolute pixels. 
Accessible Designs
As you design your site, keep in mind that viewers come to your pages with a
variety of computers, operating systems, and monitors. Ensure that your site is
accessible to all your potential viewers by testing your pages on a variety of
systems. If you want to attract a large audience to your site, you need to ensure
that it looks good on a broad range of systems. A design that looks great in
Firefox or Safari may be unreadable in Internet Explorer 3.0. And many people
still use old browsers because they haven’t bothered — or don’t know how —
to download new versions.
Accessible design on the Web also includes pages that can be read (actually,
converted to synthesized speech) by special browsers used by the blind.
Using the Alt attribute in your image tags is a simple way to ensure that all
visitors can get the information they need. The Alt attribute specifies a text
alternative that displays if the image doesn’t appear. It’s inserted into an
image tag like this:
<IMG SRC=”CAT.GIF” ALT=”A picture of a black and white cat.”>
Dreamweaver has many features designed to ensure you design your site
with accessibility in mind. For example, in Preferences you can specify that
you want accessibility alerts, which prompt you for <ALT> tags and other
HTML design options that ensure your site displays well for all visitors.
Create a Consistent Design
Most Web sites work best and are easiest to navigate when they follow a con-
sistent design. Case in point: Most readers take for granted that books don’t
change their design from page to page, and that newspapers don’t change
headline fonts and logos from day to day. Consistency is one of the primary
tools used in books and newspapers to make it easy for readers to distin-
guish different elements and follow a story or theme.
399
Chapter 17: Ten Web Site Ideas You Can Use

As you lay out your Web page, keep related items close to one another and be
consistent about how you design similar content elements. You want your
viewers to instantly understand which pieces of information are related to
each other. Distinguish different kinds of information by their
 Design
 Location
 Prominence
This type of organization makes following information visually much easier.
Make sure that similar elements follow the same design parameters, such as
type style, banner size, and page background color. Give elements of similar
importance the same weight on a page. If you use too many different ele-
ments on a page or on the same Web site, you can confuse your viewers.
To ensure a consistent style, define a set of colors, shapes, or other elements
that you use throughout the site. Choose two or three fonts for your Web site
and use those consistently as well. Using too many fonts makes your pages
less appealing and harder to read.
Strive for consistency in your designs — except when you’re trying to be
unpredictable. A little surprise here and there can keep your Web site alive.
Follow the Three Clicks Rule
The Three Clicks Rule states that no important piece of information should
ever be more than three clicks away from anywhere else on your Web site.
The most important information should be even closer at hand. Some infor-
mation, such as contact information, should never be more than one click
away. You can make finding information easy for viewers by creating a site
map (as I explain in the next section) and a navigation bar — a set of links 
to all the main sections on your site.
Map It Out
As your site gets larger, providing easy access to all the information on your
Web site may get harder and harder. A great solution is to provide a site map,
which is an outline or a diagram that illustrates the hierarchy and content of
your site and includes links to the most important pages in the site.
The site map can get complicated and busy if you have a lot of pages and
links, so it’s usually best to create a site map in outline form. Don’t put lots of
400
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

graphics in your site map — it should be functional above all else. A site map
doesn’t have to look pretty; it has to allow your visitors to quickly get to any
page on the site.
Be Prepared for Fast Updates
The Web provides a powerful vehicle for businesses and nonprofit organiza-
tions to present their side of any story and get the word out quickly when
tragic events, bad press, and other crises arise. 
But don’t wait for an emergency to find out if you’re prepared to add new
information to your Web site quickly, and don’t fool yourself into thinking
that just because you don’t manage a daily Internet newspaper you don’t
have to worry about speedy updates. 
With a little planning and key systems set up in advance, you can be prepared
for events that require timely information — whether an international crisis
stops air travel, a flood closes your nonprofit, or an embarrassing event
makes your CEO cringe and demand that the real story be told as soon as
possible. 
Most organizations develop Web sites that are updated on a weekly, monthly,
or even annual basis. More sophisticated sites may link to databases that
track inventory or update product listings in real time, but even high-end
sites are often ill-prepared to update special information quickly. 
Here are a few precautions you can take to be prepared for timely updates on
your site:
 Make sure you can send new information to your Web site quickly.
Many Web sites are designed with testing systems that safeguard against
careless mistakes, but these systems can add hours, or even days, to the
time it takes to add new information to your Web site. Work with your
technical staff or consultants to make sure you can update your site
quickly if necessary. This may require creating a new section you can
update independently from the rest of the site or override the regular
update system.
 Make updating important sections of your site easy.
Consider building or buying a content management system that uses
Web-based forms to post new information to your site. Such a system
can be designed to change or add information to a Web page as easily as
filling out an online order form. You need an experienced programmer to
develop a form-based update system. Many Web consultants offer this
kind of service for a reasonable fee. For example, this method works if
you are a real estate agent and need to change listings or if you have a
401
Chapter 17: Ten Web Site Ideas You Can Use

calendar of events. Include password protection so that you control
access to the form. As an added advantage, a form enables you to make
updates from any computer connected to the Internet. So you can
update your Web site, even if you can’t get back into your office.
 Identify and train key staff to update the site.
With the right systems in place, you do not need to have much technical
experience to make simple updates to a site, but your staff needs some
instruction and regular reminders. Make sure you also develop a schedule
for retraining to ensure that no one forgets emergency procedures. Your
most serious emergency could happen tomorrow or may not happen for
years to come — you never know — but being prepared pays off in the
end.
Back It Up
Make sure you have a system in place to back up your Web site. Always keep a
copy of all the files that are on your server in a separate location and update it
regularly to make sure you have the latest version of your site backed up at all
times. Even the best Internet service providers sometimes have technical
problems, so you should keep a backup of your site where you have easy
access to it and can get it back online quickly if something does happen to
delete any or all the files you have on the server.
Also keep a backup of your original source files, such as Photoshop images.
For example, when you develop images for the Web, you usually start in a
program such as Photoshop, creating a high-resolution image that may
include layers and other elements. Before the image goes on your Web site,
those layers get flattened and the image gets compressed or reduced and
converted into a GIF or JPEG. If you ever want to go back and alter that image
in the future, you’ll want the original source file before it was compressed
and the layers were flattened. Whether you create your own images or you
hire a professional designer, make sure you develop a system for saving all
these original elements when they are created.

W
ith each new version, Dreamweaver gets even better, which makes
creating Web sites faster and easier. As I put this book together, I 
collected tips and tricks and gathered them into this handy list. Take a
moment to check out these tips, and you’re sure to save time developing
your Web site. 
Splitting the View
If you like to switch back and forth between the HTML source code and
Design view in Dreamweaver, you’ll appreciate the option to split the window
so that you can view both the source code and the page design at the same
time. To split the window, choose View➪Code and Design or click the Show
Code and Design Views button, located just under the Insert bar at the top of
the Workspace.
With Dreamweaver 8, the source code has better color coding and tagging fea-
tures, similar to those in the HTML editor HomeSite. Notice as you’re working
that if you select an image, text, or other element on a page in Design view, it
is automatically highlighted in Code view, a great feature that makes it easier
to find your place in the raw code. (You can find more on Dreamweaver’s
interface options in Chapter 1.)

Inserting Content with Formatting
Dreamweaver 8 gives you more options than ever for maintaining formatting
when you copy and paste text from another program. You can change the
default for how Dreamweaver handles formatting when you choose Edit➪
Paste and alter the Preferences in the Copy/Paste Category. And, you can
choose Edit➪Paste Special to have all the options available each time you
paste in new content. Here are your four options:
 Text only: Dreamweaver strips any formatting and inserts plain text.
 Text with structure: Dreamweaver includes paragraphs, lists, tables,
and other structural formatting options.
 Text with structure plus basic formatting: Dreamweaver includes struc-
tural formatting as well as basic formatting, such as bold and italic.
 Text with structure plus full formatting: In addition to the previous
options, Dreamweaver includes formatting created by style sheets in
programs such as Microsoft Word.
Getting a Head Start on Your Designs
Dreamweaver 8 features many predesigned templates, as well as Starter Pages,
which not only include topic-based designs, they actually include text. You may
need to edit the text to meet your needs, but if you’re creating a common site
feature, such as a calendar or product listings, the general text already in place
gives you a head start. 
When you create a new file in Dreamweaver (such as by choosing File➪New),
the New Document window offers you many ways to create a predesigned
page, including the following:
 Dynamic Template pages: Choose the Template Page category to open a
list of templates for dynamic Web site developing, including ASP Java-
Script, VBScript, .Net C#, .Net VB, ColdFusion, HTML SSI, HTML, JSP, 
and PhP. Note that these formats require programming beyond the 
basic features of Dreamweaver and are designed for use with advanced,
database-driven types of Web sites. You find more about these options
in Chapters 13, 14, and 15.
 Layout Designs for Frames: Choose Framesets to open a collection of
predesigned framesets. Because these templates can save you so much
time, they’re a “must use” feature if you’re creating a site that uses
frames.
 CSS-Designed Pages: Choose the Page Designs (CSS) category to open a
list of page templates created using Cascading Style Sheets.
404
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

 Predesigned Pages with Text: Choose Starter Pages to open a list of
common page designs that include content you can easily adapt for a
wide variety of Web sites.
 Regular Template Designs: Choose Page Designs to open a list of basic
HTML templates. Although they may seem simple by comparison, these
are well-designed pages that can help you get a static Web site up and
running with a lot less effort than creating it from scratch.
Tabling Your Designs
HTML tables still offer one of the most popular ways to create complex Web
designs. Although getting tables just the way you want them can be challeng-
ing, Dreamweaver makes creating tables easier with its visual design features.
In Layout mode, you can draw table cells on a page, drag them into place,
and even group cells in nested tables — without ever worrying about how
many rows and cells you need to create to make the table work. 
Choose View➪Table Mode➪Layout Mode (or click the Layout button on the
Layout Insert bar) to access Dreamweaver’s special Layout environment. If you
do want to do more standard table editing, such as merging or splitting cells,
make sure to switch back to Standard mode. You can find cell and table options
in the Properties dialog box when you select a table or cell in Standard mode,
but not when you are in Layout mode. For more information about using
Layout mode and working with HTML tables, check out Chapter 6.
Designing in a Flash
Flash rocks! The Macromedia vector-based design and animation program,
Flash, is one of the coolest programs on the Web today because it makes creat-
ing fast-loading images and animations that dynamically adjust to fit any screen
size possible. Now that the Flash plug-in is built into most current browsers,
Flash has become a standard, and Dreamweaver has made adding a variety of
common Flash features easier than ever — even if you don’t own Flash.
In Dreamweaver 8, you can find premade Flash buttons, Flash text, Flash
paper, and Flash movies available from the Common Insert bar by choosing
one from the Media drop-down list. And then use Dreamweaver’s integrated
tools to customize the button, text, or other Flash element you’ve selected.
You can even use Flash to create your own customized buttons, text, or other
Flash files and add them to the list of available buttons for easy access within
Dreamweaver.
You can add Flash text by choosing Insert➪Media➪Flash. For more on these
integrated Flash features, turn to Chapter 11.
405
Chapter 18: Ten Timesaving Dreamweaver Tips

Making Fireworks Work 
with Your Images
The Dreamweaver integration with Fireworks, Macromedia’s Web image pro-
gram, makes editing images while you work in Dreamweaver easy. Need to
change the text on a button or create a new banner? Just click the Edit button
in the Properties inspector to launch Fireworks. Any changes you make to an
image automatically appear in Dreamweaver. If you always use another image
program, such as Photoshop, this level of integration should at least get you
to consider using Fireworks. It can save you a ton of time in your design
work, especially when your pesky colleagues and clients are always asking
for last minute changes. For more on using Fireworks and Dreamweaver in
tandem, check out Chapter 10.
Finding Functional Fonts
Designers get so excited when they find out that they can use any font on a
Web page. But, in reality, your viewers must still have the font on their com-
puters for it to display. The more common the font, the more likely it is to dis-
play the way you intend. If you want to use a more unusual font, go for it —
just be sure that you also include alternatives. The Dreamweaver Font List
already includes collections of common fonts, and you can always create
your own Font List by choosing Text➪Font➪Edit Font List.
And here’s another tip: Windows is by far the most common operating system
that people use to browse the Net. To ensure the best — and fastest — results
for the majority of your users, list a Windows font first.
In an effort to make text easier to read on the Web, Adobe and Microsoft have
both created fonts especially suited to computer screens. To find out more,
visit their Web sites at www.adobe.com and www.microsoft.com respec-
tively and search for Web fonts.
Differentiating DHTML for All Browsers
If you like pushing the technical limits of what works on the Web, don’t over-
look Dreamweaver’s Convert option. This feature automatically converts
your complex page designs that work only in 4.0 and later browsers into
alternative pages that display in 3.0 browsers. The feature converts the CSS
and DHTML tags into regular HTML style tags by converting CSS formatting
into HTML formatting tags and re-creating layers into HTML Tables.
406
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

To convert CSS and other features on a page, choose Modify➪Convert➪
Layers to Tables. Beware that HTML is not capable of the complex designs
you can create using DHTML, so your converted pages may not look as much
like the original as you would like. For example, the conversion can’t do jus-
tice to a layer that moves across the screen in a static table cell. Chapter 9
walks you through the process in detail. The conversion isn’t a perfect sci-
ence, but it is a relatively easy way to ensure your pages are at least pre-
sentable in older browsers.
I’ve heard too many good designers say that users should upgrade their
browsers and that they don’t care about users who are so lame they’re still
using an old version of AOL. Here’s a word of caution: It only takes one really
important viewer to get you in trouble for not doing multibrowser designs.
Beware that one of the most likely people to be using an older browser is the
president of the company who is traveling with his laptop that has a browser
he’s never upgraded because he only uses it from hotel rooms on the road.
Don’t take the risk that your paying clients, your boss, or worse yet, your
investors, are the ones with the old browsers. Make sure your designs work
well for everyone — it’s the sign of a truly high-end Web designer. For more
on Dreamweaver’s Convert feature, read Chapter 9.
Directing Your Viewers
Creating multiple pages is the most fail-safe solution for making sure that all
your viewers are happy when you use cutting-edge page designs filled with
DHTML and CSS. That means you create two or more sets of pages: one that
uses the latest features and one that uses older, more universally supported
HTML tags. But how do you ensure that viewers get to the right pages? Use
the Check Browser behavior.
The Check Browser behavior is written in JavaScript and determines the
browser type that each viewer who lands on your site uses. The behavior
then directs users to the page design best suited to their browser versions.
To use this feature, choose Window➪Behaviors to open the Behaviors panel.
You can also find this panel by opening the Tag panel and choosing the
Behaviors tab.
Select the plus sign (+) to open the drop-down list of options on the Behaviors
tab and choose the Check Browser option. In the Check Browser dialog box,
specify what browser versions should be directed to what pages on your site.
When users arrive at your site, they’re automatically directed to the pages of
your choice, based on the browser types and versions that you specify. For
more on this and other behaviors, read Chapter 9.

Keeping Frequently Used Items Handy
Ever wished you could keep all your favorite Dreamweaver features in one
convenient place? Now you can with the Favorites tab.
When you launch Dreamweaver, the Common tab is visible at the top of the
Workspace. Click the arrow to the right of it, and you find a drop-down list
with several options, including Layout, Forms, and HTML. At the bottom of
that list is the newest addition of Macromedia, the Favorites bar.
Select the Favorites bar and you can customize it with all your favorite objects;
just right-click (or Control+click) choose Customize Favorites. Use this bar as a
convenient way to keep all your favorite features handy. You can even change it
for special projects that require a series of steps or elements.
