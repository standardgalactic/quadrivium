Introduction
In the beginnirg, our ancient ancestors created artwork
and text, pictographs and hieroglyphics, and each
created work was an original.
With the invention of the printing press, mass
production of copies of any original work became
possible. Creativity exploded worldwide. As costs
came down, the ability ofpeople to share artandprinted
communication created a virtual torrent of knowledge
and information.
It is always the creativity of individuals-inventors,
innovators and visionaries-that leads the way.
The invention of radio and television created
instantaneous mass communication. Each broadcast
meant that anyone with a receiver would receive a
simultaneous copy of the original work. Recording
devices allowed copies to be literally frozen in time,
for later playback.
In 1958, Jack St. Clair Kilby invented the integrated
electronic circuit, or microchip. His invention paved
the way for the miniaturrzation of computers and the
birth of the Internet. Once again, another creative
individual influenced and changed the world.

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anyone
And so it was with the invention of the popular
personal computer or PC. The Apple computer, one
popular example, was born in I 97 5. TWo teenagers in
California were largely responsible for its success.
The Apple was designed by Steve Wozniak to
demonstrate 
to his local computer club, and when a store
ordered 50 oftheffi, he and his friend Steve Jobs, began
production. The Apple II and its clones revolutioni zed
the lives of millions of people throughout the United
States and Canada.
The low price of PCs brought them within reach of
highly creative and talented young people in their teens
and twenties. For the first time, the power previously
available only to multinational corporations and
governments was suddenly available to the public.
Apple computer clubs swept the continent. Here, in
monthly meetings, computer enthusiasts 
could meet to
excitedly discuss new ideas and try out new experiments
and programs.
Still, one thing was missing. And thatmissing something
created a truly formidable challenge.
These avid computer club enthusiasts and other PC
users wanted to go far beyond their local clubs and
neighborhoods. They wanted nothing less than to be
able to communicate 
globally, and exchange ideas with
other young people all over the world.

Introduction
To do this, they needed to cross language and
geographical barriers, and political boundaries. It also
had to be free, or almost free. How on earth could all
these creative people-potentially millions of people
scattered around the globe-share information and
communicate with each other?
A large part of the answer came during a remarkable
four-year period from l99l to 1994. A visionary
scientist named Tim Berners-Lee, working in Geneva,
Switzerland, created a shared information space which
allowed communication among a group of research
scientists. These scientists needed the ability to retrieve
information regardless of the variety of computer
platforms that were in use at the time.
Berners-Lee's real intent, however, even in his first
proposal in 1989, went far beyond the needs of the
physicists he worked with. He envisioned nothing less
than a worldwide communication system for public
use. And from 1995 onwards" the World Wide Web
literally skyrocketed in populartty.
True, there were many Internet protocols being
developed as early as the late 1960s, particularly by
the U.S. military, and small nets were being used at an
early date. It was the public's demand, however, that
exploded the Internet into the real global phenomenon
it has now become.

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
Today, the distinction has become blurred between the
Internet and the WorldWide Web (www). In this book I
will often use the words interchangeably, 
but generally
speaking, the word Internet will always include the
World Wide Web.
The idea of retrieving information was paramount for
the scientists in Switzerland when the World Wide
Web was born, and it is still paramount. Remember
this: everything that we call human history is simply
what individuals have done, whether they acted alone
or in a group. And retrieving information about
individuals, precisely and aceurately, is what this
book is all about.
The Internet opened up tremendous resources that are
extending deep within all fields of knowledge. The
most remote details from the ancient past are coming
alive at an unbelievable rate. New discoveries in the
present are being added as they occur. Timelines
become blurred: the first partofthis sentence 
is alre ady
in the past.
New information is accumulating at a stupendous
rate. It cannot be fathomed by any one person. It is
unprecedented. 
Nobody, not even governments, can
stay on top of it.
Every day hundreds of millions of new facts become
available. Those who delve too deeply into the

Introduction
information world find themselves speaking of a new
disease - information overload.
This book is designed to provide you with the specific
techniques that allow you to find and identify almost
any individual, whether that person lived a hundred
years dgo, a thousand years dgo, or even if that person
is alive and living in our world today. This book will
also provide you with the tools you need for navigation
as the Internet unfolds.
You will also be sharing a vision of where the
information highway is headirg, what type of traffic it
will have in the future and whv.
To clearly see that future vision, we must flrst explore
some unknown ancient history about ourselves.
This ancient history is quite well hidden. It is unknown
to the vast majority of people in the world today. That,
however, is all about to change.
11

Our Hidden History
Homo Sapiens at Dawn
The birth of modern man begins many thousands of
years ago. Scholarly ancient history books along with
recent archaeological 
discoveries have told us far more
today than what was known just one generation ago. It
is for certain, however, that our beginnings are rooted
in small tribal groups or clans.
The members of these tribes are truly our ancient
ancestors. 
If they did not exist. then we would not exist
today.
Recent discoveries are making it clear, however,
that if we do not relearn some basic truths about our
ancient past, our civilization today will most likely
collapse-not in some distant future like some have
imagined-but perhaps within our lifetime. If society
and governments incur great errors, it will be partly
because we forgot where we came from.
Many historians have studied the differences between
ancient tribes. Emphasizing differences is only half the
story, however, and focusing just on differences alone
may be misleading.
After all, if you focus just on the differences between
you and your own siblings, without understanding
l 3

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
the similarities and common elements, it might result
in a fight. If we focus on differences only between
nations, but without understandin 
E, Lt could-and has
in countless instances-led to war and destruction.
Instead of differences, let us look at the similarities
between all of the ancient tribes, and see if we can pick
up some new understanding. 
Remember: many of these
tribes developed seemingly unknown to each other,
on several continents. And yet there were three major
similarities between all of them. It is the similarities
that provide important and crucial clues about our own
nature, charucteristics and origin.
1 .
Kinship
A11 early tribes were charactertzedby a strong energy-
bond we call kinship. Each member of the tribe felt
a strong sense of belonging. They shared a powerful
family feeling. This bond created a strong rapport and
affinity between each member of the tribe. They knew
how they were all related to each other. They understood
this on very deep levels and felt that relationship
emotionally. It was a constant.
2. 
A Common Ancestor
Early tribes all carrie4 from generation to generation,
the verbal story of a common ancestor. The common
ancestor was seen as the tribe's founder, head or chief.
T4

Our Hidden Hlstorv
He was viewed as the ancestor 
from whom they had all
descended. 
This shared belief strengthened 
the kinship
feeling among every member of the tribe and provided
a sense of purpose and value to the very existence of
the tribe itself. Every man, woman and child felt this
force: they had a common ancestor.r
3. 
Shared Religious Beliefs
Shared religious beliefs, regardless 
ofwhat other groups
believed, acted as a unifying force, and strengthened
the feeling of oneness among each member of the tribe.
It also helped to ensure the probability and protection
of their descendants.
The Rise of the Nation-State
As tribes grew larger and larger through the centuries,
they would encounter other tribes, and if friendly
enough they might coexist and engage in trade, or even
form alliances against an invading tribe that appeared
to be a common threat. Some encounters, however,
were more like clashes, and the differences in beliefs
and symbols spawned a multitude of rivalries, conflicts
and wars.
Those thatprevailed in wars, whether by physical might
or intelligence, formed what we call nation-states. 
This
led to formation of countries and nations, usually led
by monarchs, demigods, emperors or dictators. The
l 5

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
important thing to remember about this development is
that the oneness or family feeling that previously was
a common characteristic of each tribe was gradually
displaced within this new framework of society. The
feeling of kinship declined as nation-states continued
to move aggressively up through the hallways of time
and into the fufure, eventually reaching what we now
call our lifetime.
Now we have arrived in our present world. Countless
conflicts are going on around the world. We sense many
threats to our future existence. Yet these impending
threats are mixed in with the hopes of the majority of
people who wish for a more peaceful life in the future,
along with reasonable 
prosperity.
It is during this time, in just slightly more than a decade,
that the Internet has flourished. Like any new tool or
invention, it has the potential for great harm, or great
benefit. It really depends on how it is used.
The Internet is part of the new media along with
television and a plethora of electronic gadgets.
The media forms our new community. The
electronic village is our hometown. 
. We
know celebrities but they don't know us.
The new community is not a reciprocal
neighborhood like earlier ones. These
vicarious relations help create a new kind of
1 6

Our Hidden Hlsrctr-t
loneliness-the loneliness of people whose
relationships are with personae instead of
persons.2
The Discovery of Ebla
Ebla is typical ofthe archaeological 
discoveries 
that keep
changing our previous concepts about early civilization
and bring a wealth of new information to light.
For 15 years archaeologists 
had been digging in the
mounds of an ancient civrhzatton on the plain of Syria.
The dig took place between ancient Egypt and the
Mesopotamian empire.
Then, in 1968, the archives of an ancient city-state
were unearthed revealing 15,000 clay tablets covered
in an unknown cuneiform writing. At first, none of the
experts were able to translate the writing, even though
there are almost 7,000 known living languages in the
world today.3
A little later, the archaeologists made yet another
fortunate discovery. They found a unique set of tablets
within the archive that showed the unknown Eblamite
words along with the equivalent words in Sumerian.
By good fortune, Sumerian was a language that was
understood by language experts. Suddenly they had
the key to understanding this unknown language.
t 7

Findin g Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
Incidentally, these translation tablets formed the oldest
dictionary or lexicon ever discovered on our planet.
Armed with the key to deciphering the Eblamite
tablets, the experts began the unprecedented task of
translation. No archaeologists had ever encountered
15,000 clay tablets that required translation.
In the words of Dr. Giovanni Pettinato, an expert in
ancient languages who had participated in the Italian
Archaeological Mission in Syria,
All the other texts of this period recovered
to date do not total a fourth of those from
Ebla.a
A remarkably clear view of daily life in ancient Ebla
began to unfold. The records being translated cover
trade, commerce and the historical chronicles of
this ancient empire. The details include over 5,000
geographical 
place-names. 
In essence, 
Ebla is rewriting
much of history in that part of the ancient world.
Among thousands of people recorded in the tablets is
the name of Davi{ which has never been found in such
ancient texts except the Bible. The large number of
genealogical 
references include the names ofAbraham,
Esau, Saul and a King Ebrium, who was believed by
some scholars to be Eber, the great-great-grandson 
of
1 8

Our Hidden Hlstory
Noah. Ebla's scribes had even kept track of the names
of the people just traveling through their country.
In the Old Testament of the Bible, the Book of
Deuteronomy refers to Abraham's grandfather as being
a Syrian. These discoveries have excited and mystified
scholars of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and have
left historians thinking anew about the formative years
of ancient civ thzation.
Although the discovery of Ebla is fascinating, it is just
one of a multitude of other discoveries coming to light
all over the world. Some recent discoveries are nothing
short of astonishing.
For example, more than 400,000 fragments of scrolls,
books andpapyrus were found in a 30-foot deep city dump
near Oxyrhynchus, an ancient provincial capital in Egypt
that dates from Roman times. Some of these fragments
are more than 2,000 years old. Another large deposit of
fragments from an ancient library has also been found
in Herculaneum. The fragments are covered with grime,
soot and ash-the result of volcanoes and fires.
Now, thanks to NASA technology and innovative
scientists, enhanced multispectral imaging allows
researchers to see through multiple layers of these
fragments, even black upon black layers, to actually see
the original writing clear enough to read reconstruct
and recreate as modern images.
1 9

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
Texts from these two cities now being translated
include property records, New Testament epistles,
early Islamic writings and fragments of lost plays by
Euripides, Sophocles, and unknown works by the most
famous classical writers and poets of antiquity.i Only
20 years ago many historians would have thought such
scientific achievements 
were utterly impossible.
Many of the missing pieces of our true and ancient
history are now coming to light. The shape of history
is altering so quickly and on such a large scale that
the authors of our history books arc hard-pressed to
stay abreast of the changes that follow each new major
discovery.
Let me put it this way: the new revelations of science and
archaeology require constant updating of our textbooks
if we are to live in an aware and educated societv.
'/
The Discoverv of Cousinhood
Consider this opening phrase of a poem published in
1670 by John Wilmot:
The world appears like a great family.6
Later, in 1839, William Blackstone published a classic
work entitled Commentary on the Laws of England.T In
his research, he had noted that we all have a surprising
number of ancestors.
20

Our Hidden Hlstorv
For example, you have two parents, different from each
other, or you would not exist.
It would seem logical to assume that your two parents
each had two parents also, and therefore you have four
grandparents. And you might further assume that your
four grandparents each had two parents, and so on.
Your ancestors seemingly double with each generation
as you go back in time. And although this may seem
very logical and correct, it is actually not true! In fact,
it's impossible. You can prove it to yourself in a few
minutes.
Take a calculator and keep doubling your ancestors
every 28 years or so (an average generation) and before
you can get back to 2000 years &go, your ancestors
outnumber the total world population at that time! And
remember: we're not talking about anyone else - just
your ancestors! The truth is, human history is loaded
with cousins marrying cousins, far beyond what most
people would ever imagine.
Mathematicians, genealogists and other scientists
have examined this apparent enigma and have come
to one conclusion: many of your ancestors knowingly
or unknowingly married their cousins. This resulted in
a reduction in the number of ancestors from the usual
rate of expansion.
21

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
Genealogists 
call this phenomenon pedigree collapse.
Pedigree collapse appears to have first been mentioned
in a paper by Robert C. Gunderson.s 
It means that our
ancient family trees are much smaller than we used
to believe. As well, these repeated marriages between
related cousins are far more plentiful in the past than
we ever imagined. Parts of our ancestral family tree
had branches that were expanding at a normal rate
while other branches were contracting by comparison.
Certain individuals may show up in your family tree
more than once. Acknowledging these events is the
only way to reconcile world population with the fact
that we each have two parents.e
In a more extreme example, the marrrage of a brother
and sister has quite a dramatic effect. This happened in
some royal families, for instance. When a brother and
sister marry, then there are only the same two people
as parents for both of them in the previous generation,
not four.
Often, because of religious and cultural beliefs, known
sexual liaisons between certain individuals with their
cousins were kept quiet and were closely guarded
secrets. Genetic evidence is changing all that.
Far more children were born out of wedlock than our
parents and grandparents ever would have believed.
In fact, many of our parents and grandparents simply
22

Our Hidden Hlstory
wouldn't want to believe that this happened so
often. This is understandable. 
After all, there was no
convincing evidence of this reality until recently.
A term I particularly dislike is the word illegitimate
when applied to children. Any child born into this
world is as legitimate as any other chil{ and the use of
the term illegitimate is of ill intent and demeaning and
should never be used.
It would be more approprrate to refer to the activities
of a parent of the child as engaging in illegitimate
activities, contravening their vows or disrespecting
social norms, but the child is not guilty of anything.
Today, DNA evidence and the human genome project
have led to much closer linkage and cooperation
between two very complementary sciences: genealogy
and genetics.
While scientists may continue to argue about the exact
and final degree of relationship, it is evident to them
that everyone in the world is related. The relationship
between us all is very clear:
We are all cousins
Many scientists now estimate that no person in the
world could be further apartfrom you than 50th cousin.
other scientists believe that nobody else in the world
- t 1
z )

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
today could be any further apart from you than 32nd
cousin. But they all agree on one thing: that we are
cousins.
You may ask, "Does this include all of the various races
besides my own?" The answer is an emphatic yes. Yes,
it includes all so-called races. No exceptions.
Even remote tribes are not really being discovered for
the first time. They are only being rediscovered a very
long time after they were separated from other ancient
tribes. In more ancient times they had ancestors in
common to us all. And the latest evidence still indicates
the origin of our species took place in Afric a and spread
out from there to other continents.
The most remote tribes are part of the overall human
gene pool. In their ancient history they were inter-
mingled with other tribes and had common ancestors
with them before being cut off through exploration,
nafural catastrophes or other events.
When you hear news about a remote tribe being
discovere{ remember they represent those more
distant 32nd or 50th cousins. They are cousins greatly
removed by degree, but nevertheless 
they are still our
cousins.

note, another author, Alex
to say on the subject of
The political implications of this great
kindred are quite exciting. If all of us
could be made aware of our multiple inter-
relatedness, 
if the same sort of altruism that
usually exists among close kin could prevail
through the entire humanpopulation . . . [our]
differences . . . would seem secondary."
It is evident as we look at today's world that the
knowledge about our ancient kinship feelings and
our beginnings are unknown to the vast majority of
people.
It is also evident that most people are unaware of
the vast wealth of names of people and places being
unearthed in ancient archives every yeaL
Many of the tribes existing today pass along vast
genealogies 
of their ancestors orally. They are recited
aloud from the eldest to the youngest. Now these
genealogies are being recorded and documented by
the younger generations. This is all possible with
25

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
modern tape, CD and DVD recording devices and
with video cameras.
Vast archives in the Vatican contain details about
millions of people who lived during past centuries.
They wait for their reawakening to be acknowledged
in the world of digital data. Other religious institutions
have contributions to make as well. We're waiting for
them too.
However, the biggest unknown fact is still this: all
of the people who ever lived in the past, along with
everyone alive today, are cousins.
The factthatthese things are unknownproduces 
the exact
opposite effect of what was true of our ancestors who
lived in those ancient tribes: most of us don't feel any
kinship feelings with people of different nationalities.
Most of us only feel kinship for a very few of our
own nationality. We have lost that kinship feeling, that
oneness feeling, that should exist within mankind.
As a result of this lack of knowledge, we are obviously
paying the consequences 
right now. The consequences
are wars, genocide, starvation, disease, murder and
other atrocities. In truth, our ignorance is working
against the probability of our own future existence.
Are we not aware of the 2,000-year-old expression,
A house divided against itself cannot stand?1r
26

Our Hidden Hlstorv-
What Creates Prejudice?
If you think about the fact those millions of ancestors
lead precisely and directly down through the centuries
to you, you may begin to change some of your built-in
assumptions. 
Try to imagine for just a few minutes the
range and kinds of people your ancestry includes.
Your ancestors include criminals, nobility, royalty and
scoundrels ofevery kind. Remove just one ofthem from
your ancestry and the you that is you right no% would
not even exist. Give that reahzation a few minutes of
your time. Refresh your memory screen.
Genealogical Bridges
Anthony Wagner is well known for his essays in
the genealogical interpretation of history. In his
scholarly book, Pedigree and Progress, he explains
how occurrences that took place centuries ago are
now emerging as major genealogical landmarks when
viewed from today's vantage point:
In the year 1265 a nephew of Kubla Khan,
Emperor of China, married the half-sister of
a Byzantine Emperor, who in 1279 married
the sister-in-law of a nephew of St. Louis,
King of France, and of Eleanor of Provence,
Queen of England.ra
27

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
This meant that 700 years ago a genealogical bridge
was connected across the continents ofEurope andAsia
in less than 15 years, and through only eight people.
This is just one example of the countless thousands
of genealogical bridges creating interlinkage between
races, nations and countries throughout the course of
human history. Every living person today is the result
of common ancestry and genealogical bridges.
I remember vividly an incident that occurred when I
was invited to speak to a group of students in a school
in Ontario.
While talking about cousinhood I noted that these
young children were absolutely fascinated. Then,
during recess, one of the teachers asked me to come
outside to the schoolyard where the children were
playing. She told me how one of the girls that had
been in my class had run out to all of her friends and
blurted out excitedly: "Did you know we're cousins?"
They all clustered around and were still talking about
it excitedly when I arrived.
I began to wonder at that point, "What if all children,
in every country were actually taught this when they
were young?" I think the change would be enormous,
and when these children reached university dga, they
might take their professors and leaders to task for not
understanding how this really changes everything.
28

Our Hidden Hlstorv
Could world wars develop if everyone had a kinship
feeling for all ethnic groups? Wouldn't we instead rely
far more on understanding, 
reasoning, negotiation and
real diplomacy?
Keep these discoveries in mind as we progress.
As the full implications of these discoveries are
assimilate{ our basic and fundamental ideas about
ourselves and our relationships with each other must
change.
Our educational institutions, by definition, should be
the early transmitters of these new perspectives, but
not by boring and repetitive lecturing. Instead:
Teaching is now understood as mafure
assistance to youthful learning, or self-
teaching. 
. The teacher becomes a part
of the learning group, sharing his greater
maturity and knowledge, but seeking out
ways of assisting others to learn rather than
going through an empty ritual of forced
feeding.ls
With the essence of this chapter in mind we will now
step into the Internet world and lock-in on the single
most important search technique we need to find the
proverbial needle in the haystack.

The Internet Unfolds
When the Internet began, it is important to know that
there was an immediate need for convergence. 
By this
statement, I mean that text alone, without diagrams,
images, pictures and photos, wasn't enough.
Several centuries dgo, the brilliant educator Comenius
created a breakthrough in teaching and wrote a
revolutionary book entitled Orbis Pictus (Pictured
World). It was the first picture-book or illustrated
manual of instruction for the young. It was published
at Nuremberg, Germany in 1657 .
Comenius, with the instinct of a great
teacher, felt that to give words without things
(pictures) to the pupil was not simply to
retard his progress, but to lay the foundation
of vague and inaccutate conceptions.r
Another educator, Pestalozzr, ventured further by
trying to have the actual object in front of the child
learning the word-and from these two educators
"flowed the excellent custom of giving object lessons
in infant schools".2
Object lessons and show and tell sessions 
are still used
today in virtually every school. These techniques are

tried tested and proven to more clearly communicate
ideas, topics and personal experiences.
And so it was that the Internet also needed, right from
the beginning, a convergence of images, pictures, and
text to bring about a clear understanding through this
new communication medium.
At first, websites sprang up more or less helter-skelter
and confusion abounded. one of the main challenges
was how to find the website that actually had the
information you were looking for.
This led to the natural need for massive indexes to the
data held on various websites. Ideally, these indexes
would guide researchers 
to the right place where they
might find the proverbial needle in a haystack.
If you know the history of nonfiction books to any
degree, one of the most basic requirements is an
index, especially when complex terminology is used
throughout the book.
Remember: a noun is the name of a person, place
or thing. Histori cally, our libraries always had card
catalogs in the past, and many still do.
These card catalogs were essentially indexes to the
book titles and subjects in a collection, and of course,
the authors had to be indexed by name as well. And
34

The Internet Unfolds
books about geographical regions, different languages
or from different countries had to be specified and
grouped together.
What happened in the history of books is very similar,
in part, to what has happened-and is continuing to
happen 
the Internet.
If we look at the history of books themselves, certain
kinds of books were really indexes with data attached.
Some of the major ones are:
Dictionaries
Lexicons
Encyclopedias
Bibliographies
Concordances
Directories
The Internet has many advantages 
over books, however,
because once books were reproduced digitally,
computer programs could be written to cross-reference
information in ways never before possible with books
in libraries.
On the Internet you can search many encyclopedias
for free. One of the best free encyclopedia websites
will even let you participate in creating this marvelous
resource. Take a look at the following website available
in 10 different languages:
35

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
http:llwikipedia.org
Every word written in a book or on a website could be
partofan index, and cross-referencing 
and sophisticated
crisscross indexing became the major centerpiece of
what are now known as search engines.
In 1962 the visionary Marshall Mcluhan stated:
When millions ofbooks can be compressed 
in
a match-box space, it is not the book merely,
but the library that becomes portable.3
In the near future, most libraries will expand to
become virtual libraries on the Internet. At first,
catalogs will go online, and then their older and
rarest books along with high-demand books. once
the data on the pages ofthese books has been digitally
converte4 then it can be shared globally. Best of all,
this can be provided to anyone at very low cost, and
in many instances for free.
In the future, our descendants 
will likely have library
buildings filled with physical books in their pioneer
villages, showing future citizens what life was like
during the early 2000s !
More and more libraries are being transported onto
the Internet to become virtual libraries. These virtual
libraries are indeed portable, whether the data covers a
36

The Internet Unfolds
dozenbooks or a million volumes. Books that were rare
and locked in climate controlled glass display cabinets
in the past, will be available to anyone, anywhere and
at anytime they wish.
One choice for users will be to view scanned images
(photographed pages) of books showing them as they
were originally. Many researchers need to see the
original work and form. This is particularly useful for
rare books, artwork, maps and illustrations.
Another choice will be viewing the digital data that
provides the user with the informational content, but
not the original appearance 
or form. These are digital
books.
Digital books are highly useful for many reasons, such
as changing the font type and size and republishing a
book that is in the public domain (not under copyright
protection). Many older books were in very tiny type
sizes, making them difficult to read. Now such works
can be available in very large easy to read fonts.
In the Western Hemisphere, Johannes Gutenberg
invented the printing press with removable metal or
wooden letters in I 436. China had already been printing
on a press using moveable hardened clay letters since
1041, although printing in China had begun long before
that, during the 800s.
37

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
Then, in the 1960s, along came offset printing or
instant printing, using photo-typesetting, and a new
revolution was born.
Suddenly a photograph could be made of a rare
work of art, and that photograph could be impressed
electronically on a metal or paper plate. Thousands of
copies could be produced automatically and instantly
without the need of any typesetting.
Many collectors of rare original artworks and maps
panicked at first, because they were afraid that if
someone took a picture of their rare masterpiece, the
value would be diminished.
Some purists felt that since early offset printing was
inferior in quality compared to the original artwork, it
would cheapen everything. They were all wrong.
Suppose you were a stamp collector, for example,
and you possessed 
a very rare stamp worth $100,000.
Someone could take a beautiful, high-resolution digital
photo of that stamp and the photo might be worth a
few dollars, but it is the original stamp that is worth
the $ 100,000.
Offset printing, by producing prints and copies of rare
art, cteated two marvelous benefits for both collectors
of rare art and the public at large.
38

The Internet Unfolds
First, everyone, even the poor and middle classes, could
afford a copy of a rare piece of art, and appreciate and
enjoy it in their own home.
Second" as millions of people shared the appreciation
and beauty of rare art, the value ofthe originals actually
went up. As more new people acquired wealth for the
first time, they had a new awareness 
of greatart through
seeing prints and pictures of it. Owning an original was
highly desired especially by the nouveau riche. Today,
investing in original works of art is a huge field and
prices continue to escalate over time.
Once again, the old marketing truths of supply and
demand were working, but in a new way.
It is important to reahze that nobody told the public to
buy this great reproduced art. People just looked at the
prints and were internally motivated within themselves
to acquire a copy or print. Just the exposure to art itself
motivated the public to buy.
Stores selling prints were simply displaying what was
avarlable, but not dictating what the public should like.
Observant storeowners quickly became aware of what
the public wanted.
I think one of the great errors of our time is marketing
people who try to dictate or limit the choice of the
public through strident advertising and controlled
39

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
distribution. Just show us everything avarlable, and we
will choose what we like. It's just the way it really is.
The Information Highway
The time we live in has often been called the
Information Age and we are truly witnessing nothing
less than an information revolution. While there is an
overwhelming explosion of data worldwide, wisdom
is needed to find our way through this overwhelming
morass of data. We need to hone in on our specific
objectives and goals without getting totally lost in a
never-ending and expanding universe of data.
Careful search techniques can locate information
minutes that may have taken many decades to find
the past.
For the most part, governments are rightly avoiding
direct taxation of Internet users. The invention and use
of the Internet was always premised upon it belonging
to the people. Nevertheless, governments are very
tempted to tax, especially in countries where the level
of greed of those in control rises above the people's
primary needs and rights.
When radio was first invented, the government stepped
in and required everyone who wanted to own a radio
receiver to purchase a license from the government.
Just listening to a radio in your home in the 1920s
m
in
40

The Internet Unfolds
required a radio license. A little experience with the
public reaction to licensing led government officials to
drop the idea very quickly decades ago.
Incidentally, speaking of radio, did you know that
many elements of the Internet came from the hobby of
amateur radio or ham radio? This fraternity of people
talked on short-wave radio to others in every country
of the world long before the Internet was invented.
They created and coined the word "net" where people
clustered together on the air to discuss popular topics
in a unique and invisible information space.
It was ham radio operators who created and operated
the first radio and television broadcast stations.
They assisted people to make free telephone calls
between countries even as early as the 1950s, using
phone patches, an elementary forerunner of VoiP
technology today.
If we look back now to the information highway, we
see that the highway is the actual infrastructure of the
Internet itself.
Picture in your mind a complex web of millions
of highways with turnpikes, intersections or hubs.
Websites are like tourist attractrons along the way.
There are stores, businesses, 
services, libraries, malls
and thousands of other travel stops en route. You can
4 1

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
tour or be a sightseer, or you can go instantly to any
destination.
The big difference between the Internet versus cars on
a highway is that you can move along the information
highway to your destination at almost the speed of
light: 186,000 miles per second. And gas prices aren't
going up!
It's not just information, it's instant information.
Distant websites on the far side of the planet seem to
be as close as websites next door to us, and as faster
Internet access speeds prevail, these huge distances
and faster speeds seem to merge or collapse, and they
soon become meaningless.
In our minds, whether we are conscious of it or not, we
experience time and space disappearing, or becoming
the same thing.
This merging of time and space can actuall5r create a
growing psychological challenge for children raised
from birth in the first Internet-only generation in
history.
If young children are dominated by only the Internet
and games, ttcanbecome increasingly difficult forthem
to clearly distinguish between the invisible Internet
world and the real three-dimensional 
world where their
physical bodies live and breathe and where they must
42

The Internet Unfolds
learn to interchange and socialize with other children.
This is a new and vital challenge for our educational
systems and social scientists.
Let's look at the builders of the information highways.
Building this immense highway system requires a
huge investment by many large and small corporations.
Why are they spending so much money? You need to
know. It is the power of our needs that really dictates
what is happening. This is the single biggest clue to
understanding how the Internet will develop in the
future.
Billions of dollars have being spent so far on building
the information highway. Why? That enormous amount
of money is being invested because the investors expect
trillions of dollars will be made in the future from its
existence. That is, of course, only if those investors
make the right choices. And who determines the right
choices? We do!
No planners build highways unless they assume from
the beginning that there will be a lot of future traffic.
Traffic on the Internet consists of digital bytes and
bits, whether it is emails, video, audio, games, movies,
search engine queries or anything else. It's all just one
thing: traffic.
The benefit for us? Wise members of the public can get
huge benefits for no cost or very little cost, by doing
A 1

some careful thinking and a little research on their
own. Let's start right now.
Search Engines
Whether you are searching for someone in the past,
or someone living today, the first essential tool on the
Internet is a search engine. Everybody knows about
them, but the majority doesn't really know the best
way to use them.
When Internet novices first locate a search engine, the
majority of them just type in a word or phrase, click
enter and wait. That is often a great waste of time and
can bring frustration and despair. Let's understand
what these search engines are and how they work.
Search engines are websites that contain powerful
programs called databases. A 
database stores
information in such away that any piece of information
can be quickly retrieved through an elaborate system
of indexes and related links.
Database websites can be contained on a single
computer (a server) or on alarge number of computers
(server farms).
These powerful servers take in your request for
information, search their internal database indexes, and
serve back the results of your search request. Ebay and
44

The Internet Unfolds
Amazon, for example, use huge numbers of servers or
server farms to handle auctions or sell books, videos
and all kinds of other products.
Search engines began in the 1990s. Many of the early
search engines were created as university research
projects. Many students and university researchers
had the foresight to see our future needs and they also
had the knowledge and creativity to write programs to
meet those needs.
Major search engines today such as www.google.
com ean handle millions of transactions in less than a
second for people requesting information at the very
same moment from all over the globe. It is no wonder
that when Google went public in 2005 it was the largest
public offering of its kind and raised $2.7 billion dollars
from the public and institutional investors.
Currently Google has billions of web pages in its index,
and it is constantly growing.
Google has big plans for the future and their researchers
and developers have already turned out new resources
that are highly useful, as well as beta or test versions
of new databases and programs they are working on.
You can stay on top of their research work by going to
http : I llabs.google. 
com
45

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
When you search on most search engines, they currently
show the flrst 10 or more websites matching what
you seek-but-the first l0 are often those websites
that have the most links to them from other websites.
Usually the flrst links are sponsored links that pay the
search engine owner for positioning near the top.
These first results may contain what you're looking
for, but if not, there are ways around this to locate a
site you may wish to find. The website you seek may
purposely not have many links from other websites, or
they might not be able to afford to pay Google for high
ranking as a sponsor or advertiser.
Some current search engines are:
www.google.com
www.yahoo.com
www.c4.com
www.altavista.com
www.lycos.com
www.ask.com
www.dogpile.com
www.hotbot.com
www.clusty.com
www.msn.com
www.kartoo.com

www. scholar. 
google. com
www.findarticles.com
www. newspaperarchive. 
com
Some search engines require memberships. Some
search engines search several other search engines,
which can save time especially if the subject you are
researching is relatively rare.
It is important to reahze that search engines do not
search genealogy databases, 
or any other databases
that require memberships and passwords.
In fact, there are some websites that have no home
pages at all, and contain databases known only to a
select group of people. Most of these are not included
in search engine results. These kinds of websites
arc part of what has been called the dark Internet or
hidden Internet. It's likely that much more data may
be within the hidden Internet than the visible Internet
we're already familiar with.a
In general, powerful databases 
are structured in such a
way that they can only be used by members possessing
valid usernames and passwords.
4l

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anyw,hen
So, even if a membership database 
contains millions or
billions of names, you cannot determine what names
are in there unless you are at that website. Sometimes
you can carry out a free or limited search without being
a member.
This is why websites containing databases should be
visited and utilized if they cover the people and time
periods you seek. A search engine can find the home
page of these websites, but you must click on the link
provided by the search engine to go there and check it
out. That's part of researching.
There are very useful websites that list the many
different types of search engines available. Some of
these specialrze rn various subject fields of endeavor.
Check out www.allsearchengines.com. Another
website that compares search engines is:
www. s e archengine showdown. c om
The main point to note is this: search engines differ
from what was previously possible with printed books
in the past, because they multiply amillionfold the ways
of finding out information about anyone, anywhere, at
any time period in the past and present.
A logical question might be, "How do search engines
gather up such vast amounts of information?" Do they
employ an army of people indexing information for
them? Not at all!

The Internet Unfolds
Computer programmers create digital robots-known
as robots or crawlers-that roam around the World
Wide Web visiting every website they can to index the
home page and other pages on websites where they are
not blocked.
Every moment of every day these crawlers are tapping
into new and old websites to gather up information.
The crawlers convey the newly found datato the home
website, where it is integrated into the ocean of data
that's already there. The ocean just grows and grows.
At the search engine's home, every word is indexed
except for words like "the","and", etc. In other words,
they are primarily looking at nouns, the names of
people, places and things.
Search engines churn out their data in a similar form
to concordances. 
That is, if you are searching for a
particular person, place, or thing, search results will
usually provide you with the name of the subject you
seek within a sentence or two taken from a website
source.
This way you have the word within the context of a
sentence. This triggers your mind to select the most
likely source for the information you seek, even when
many sources come up in the search.
49

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
Usually the most relevant results come up first, but as
mentioned above, some search engines and directories
will show or highlight their paid advertisers first, along
with heavily linked websites.
This often means that cluttered websites having links
to, or ads for, many other websites may show up with
higher priority than the website that you may wish to
find. However, many websites prefer not to clutter up
their sites with a lot of links and ads. A lot of clutter
looks unsightly and unprofessional.
When I began using the Internet, I remember looking up
the word genealogy on a search engine, and I was truly
astounded to see there were over 10,000 responses. 
I
was astounded because in the early 1990s genealogy
wasn't exactly a household word.
Today, when I search for the word genealogy on a
popular search engine, I get almost 80 million hits or
responses! Initially, on the surface, that might seem
wonderful, but in fact, it reveals a huge new problem
facing researchers. 
Who can look through 80 million
responses? 
Instead of too few facts, suddenly there are
too many facts to go through!
Search Engine Techniques
I mentioned earlier that beginners often go to a
search engine, type in a name and wait for the results.
50

The Internet Llnfblds
Sometimes even people using the Internet a lot do little
more than just type in what they're looking for. That is
most often a big mistake.
For example, I went to Googlet and entered my name,
Noel Elliot.I got back almost two million results.
However, as soon as I put quotation marks around my
name, "I{oel Elliot," I got back about 3,500 results.
Quotation marks are widely used by search engines to
mean the results must be precisely the words or phrase
between the quotation marks.
I got almost two million results on the first search
because the search engine-if I just enter Noel Elliot-
will look for Noel Elliot but it will also look for any
website page that mentions Noel and Elliot even if they
are widely separated in an article.
So remember this: if the name you are searching for
is rare or uncommon, then using quotation marks will
bring back comparatively few entries.
However, this doesn't work very well for common
names. For example, if I choose the name"John Smith"
within quotation marks, I get over five million results.
However, if I add a middle name, "Joltn Maynard
Smith," I get less than 75,000 results. It turns out that
5 l

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
someone famous had that name. But if I add the name
Elliot as the middle name and search on "John Elliot
Smith," then I get only 74 results. Obviously this name
is not as famous. Experiment, experiment!
Here's another angle. I tried entering my name without
quotation marks plus the word genealogy and Canada,
like this: I{oel Elliot genealogy Canada. I got 14,600
results. Even that is a lot better than the two million
results I got when entering my name without the words
genealogy and Canada.
One more step: if I enter "Noel Elliot" genealogy
Canada, I get only five results. This is just a small
sampler of how you can narrow down the results of
a search.
A little ingenuity, thought and experimentation will
convert a beginner to at least an amateur in a very short
time. In today's worl d, a search engine is the primary
resource for every kind of research.
This simply means that search techniques have to be
constantly refined in order to precisely find the person
you are searching for.
I strongly recommend that when you visit a search
engine website, take the time to click on advanced
search. Examine all the options very carefully and you
will be richly rewarded.
52

The Internet Unfolds
You will be pleasantly surprised what search engine
administrators have orgafirzed to refine your search
immeasurably. Search engine operators spend a lot of
time and energy to try and clearly illustrate what is
now possible.
One last trick that you find very handy is to specify a
range of years. For example, if I search "JohnSmith"
born 1617...1618I 
get only 122 results. 
So, even with
a popular name like John Smith, the search can be
narrowed down b naming the year(s) of probable birth,
marrrage or death. When you specify a range of years
such as 1 617 ...1621 the search will bring back results
only within that speciflc range.

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
In general, professional genealogists 
have up to 21 ways
around a genealogy block in the mid to late 1800s.
Familiarity and the study of surnames and given names
by onomatologists provide us with reference books
that often provide a breakthrough in tracing names that
have changed over time. These reference books belong
on the shelf of every serious genealogist.
Criminals
Others immigrating into NorthAmerica were criminals,
intent on doing anything they could to create an alias
or false surname. This might work well until the
time of marriage, since that particular record usually
required the parents' names of the bride and groom,
and required witnesses who provided their names and
addresses. Often people trying to hide their identity
would give some correct names, or parts of names, on
such a document.
There are several other ways of tracing these purposely
changed names that are very sophisticated. These
techniques are known primarily to highly innovative
genealogists and private investigators versed in an
intense process of elimination and other methods, some
of which may occasionally extend into gray areas.
A very few generations later, however, descendants
of criminals might run into serious health problems
60

Finding People in the Past
if they cannot get a medical history of their ancestors
to assist them in their own medical diagnoses. This
means that one result of hiding your identity is that
your descendants' 
lives could be at risk.
Fortunately, DNA and the genetic sciences are
advancing to the place where even those who do not
know their family ancestry can be assisted and more
so with each passing year.
Is Singapore Ahead of North America?
In the year 2000, Singapore became the first country
in the world to conduct their entire population census
on the Internet.
Think of the great savings and efficiency over door-to-
door enumerations and all the paperwork and voter-
machine problems.
Every crtrzenin Canada has a Social Insurance Number
(SIN) and every citizen in the U.S. has a Social
Security Number (SSN). Computers love to crunch
numbers and they can do it instantly. What on earth
are we waiting for? Maybe our governments should
be humble enough to inquire from Singapore about
their methodologies.
Anotherpleasant surprise on my trip to Singapore was the
way in which they kept new or changed phone numbers
61

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
instantly up-to-date. A screen on your telephone stayed
up-to-date as a directory for the whole country.
This makes we wonder: How many trees do we cut
down every year to produce telephone books? And we
have to wait a year to get a new replacement for our
current books. And the beat goes on. Waste of time.
Waste of money. Waste of natural resources.
And think about all those trucks that are loaded down
with heavy telephone books, bound in huge groups and
dropped off at apaftment buildings, condos, businesses
and homes by a small army of people hired to deliver
them.
Let's consult with Singapore!
Genealogists to the Rescue
Genealogy is classified two different ways-first, the
"-ogy" ending tells us it is a science of something-
and that something is genus, or generations, or human
genesis.
Genealogy is the science of identifying an individual,
in relationship to other family members. It uses the
evidence generated by direct family connection of
siblings, parents and so on.
62

Finding People in the Past
As mentioned earlier, the science part of genealogy is
becoming more closely linked with another science,
genetics-the science where the chromosomes and the
DNA molecule are being unraveled and accelerated.
In the great classification of things, genealogy is not
only classified as a science on its own, it is also seen as
an auxiliary branch of history. Genealogy provides the
skeleton of family history. It is important to keep this
duality-genealogy and history-clear in your mind"
even though we will deal primarily with the science of
genealogy in this book.
Genealogy has to do with a lot of investigative
techniques, the outcome of which should provide
documentary evidence. These source documents
and findings provide a picture of a series of sharp
occurrences between the cradle and the grave, and
associations 
with close family kin.
A very large percentage of biographies begin with
details about the grandparents and parents , and other
family members, otherwise we would not understand
the background the challenges, and the kind of
environment the subject was raised in during their
formative years.
Genealogy is always a search for truth. It separates
family mythology and family fiction (and sometimes
over-inflated egos) from the reality of events as they
63

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
really occurred. In this sense, genealogy is refreshing,
for it teaches us that every family has ups and downs
during the many generations that take place over a long
period of time.
The person who really spotted and predicted the
popularity of genealogy in the future, was L6on
Roy, an archivist who worked in the Archives of the
Province of Qu6bec, Canada.a
The records of French Canadians are among the best
in the world if not the very best. In Qu6bec, genealogy
is often more than just a hobby or pastime-it is a
passion.
Some of the largest family reunions in the world take
place in Qu6bec. It has been stated with authority
that the greatest national treasure of Qu6bec is their
genealogical heritage. Their records are simply the
best of any state or province in North Amerrca.
This is particularly fortunate for many American
families in New England, New York, Michigan and
all the northern border States who descended from
the French. It is very common to trace such families
back into the 1600s and beyond with relative ease,
since links are most often provided to ancestors in the
ancestral villages and parishes in France.
64

Finding People in the Past
Since the French have spread out into every province
in Canada, it is also fortunate for Canadians who have
some French ancestry, including the M6tis and the
Acadians.
Remember the Roots television series craze that swept
North America and then Austraha? More people
watched the television mini-series than watched man's
first step on the moon.
Years later the Roots television production was selected
by the Chinese government to be their New Year's
special program, and it was seen on national television
across China.
I tried to imagine the likelihood of the story of a black
man's ancestry from Africa, &s told by a descendant
generations later in the United States, being used as an
example and inspiration for the people in China. Since
it was for the Chinese New Year, perhaps it was chosen
by the government to motivate the people of China to
view their future with optimism. I think it worked!
Anyway, during the Roots publicity, the fascinating
thing to me, and mentioned in a greatmany magazines
in the 1970s, was that all the so-called experts didn't
see it coming. The public's interest in genealogy had
been growing uphill in strength and numbers every
year since 1960, but the experts didn't even see it
happening as any kind of significant event.
65

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
All along, I kept thinking: Here is a hobby that is
growing dynamically. Millions of people are strongly
interested and excited. Nobody told the public to
get interested in this hobby, no government told the
people to do it, no advertisements 
told the public to get
interested in tracing your family tree.
This is very important! Why? Simply because it shows
that this phenomenon was a natural inborn need rising
to the surface in people's lives at this particular time
in history. It was all part of a search for identity and
meaning in a society that was in danger of becoming
rootless. It was some kind of natural response to the
times we were living in and the conditions we felt
around us.
And yet, it remained seemingly undetected for decades,
even by the so-called social scientists.
The only people who really knew it was happening
were those who were working in archives, because
each year they needed more money and time to meet
the swelling demand for information. For example, in
their annual reports year after year, the Nova Scotia
Archives referred to the huge backlog of mail, and
asked other archivists how they coped with the rising
tide of requests.
Genealogical societies
were beneficiaries of
many historical societies
rising public interest in
and
this
66

Finding People in the Past
genealogy. Word of mouth played alarge role until the
media caught on. The ongoing interest in genealogy
led to a swelling of the ranks among genealogical and
historical societies. More and more clubs and familv
associations sprang up.
Each genealogy group had a library of helpful books,
or used the local history collection of their public
library. More and more books were being published"
especially in the awakening period from the 1960s
to the 1990s. Printed indexes to census records, birth
records, baptismal records, tax records, voters' lists,
immigration lists, crty, town, township and county
histories, sprang up everywhere.
Avid genealogists 
and historians came out in droves to
genealogical society meetings. Societies held fairs and
other meetings, drawing the public. Later, in these huge
annual events, people crowded around the publication
displays searching for books of interest.
In my mind, the most valuable indexes combine many
indexes from different types of sources, in different
periods of time, into one massive alphabetical index.
For example, in 1984, The Genealogical Research
Library produced a three-volume set of books titled
People of Ontario 1600-1900. It had been derived
from a large number of publications and historical
property maps, and thus Ontario was the first province
67

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
to have an index combining a multitude of sources into
one large index. It had been produced using the Apple
II computer, machine-language prograffis, a disk
operating system and a library of 5" floppy diskettes.
By the 1990s after upgrading the indexing programs
and training scores of indexers, the library published
12 volumes, which covered all of Can ada for three
centuries of time, 1600- 1900.
By the year 2000, the data in those books and new
indexing had reached the place where even 84 huge
volumes wouldn't contain all the dat a, andso the library
decided to begin development of a major database
engine for their website, www.grl.com.
Here's a personal way I can truly illustrate the huge
advantage of the Internet over a library of genealogy
books.
Let's compare the previous printing of the 12 books
in the 1990s, with the Internet databank which came
online in 2003.
The original 12 volume set of books published in the
1990s cost over $1000 to purchase. 
They held details
of about two million ancestors.
Today, just ten years after those books were published,
for a very few dollars, anyone can join the library
68

Finding People in the Past
at www.grl.com and search 2I million records. Add
to that one million source document images that are
available as well. These images can be downloaded
for free by members. And then add to that, several
thousand antique maps of every country in the world.
The maps are also avarlable to members.
The cost has dropped to a tiny fraction of the cost of
the 12 volumes, while the amount of data available
has increased dramatically on the Internet. Plus source
images and maps. Additionally, a search on the Internet
takes a fractton of a secon il far faster than you can open
a book and even begin to look.
Two Major Commercial Databases in the U.S.
In the U.S., there are two huge genealogy websites that
are commercial in nature, namely, www.ancestry.com
and www.genealogy.com. 
Both of these are databases
owned by The Generations Network (previous known
as www.myfamily.com). Both databases charge for
most of their services on a database by database
basis or by specific collections. Examine the content
carefully to discern which database you need before
paying any money. I advise people the same way about
the database at www.grl.com.
It is always sensible to see if you can find what you need
for free, before paying to search a fee-based website.
Ultimately, you may indeed find that some fee-based
69

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
sites are highly useful for finding what you're looking
for and there are often many benefits to membership.
Most fee-based websites keep people employed who
are excellent indexers-and they can be fired if their
error-rate is not kept at a minimum. Other websites
may have volunteer indexers providing the data, only
to discover they have a mixture of correct and incorrect
data. There are good indexers and there are indexers
that are not so good.
In summdry, there are advantages and disadvantages
of fee-based as well as free websites. so the onus is on
you to search carefully.
Cyndi's List
For the record, a popular website for locating
genealogical websites has traditionally been Cyndi's
List at www.cyndislist.com. While I still use this
website, personally I liked the older layout this site had
a few years ago. For ffie, I found the old listings quicker
and easier to use than the current layout. However, that
said, it is still the #1 index to genealogy sites and it is a
primary resource and many researchers 
use it.
The largest database 
in the world, however, is absolutely
free to search. And that database-surprisingly to most
newcomers-is contained in two Mormon church
websites, as follows:
70

Finding People in the Past
www.familysearch.org
http : I I prlot fami lys e arch. or gl r ecords e arch/start. html#
If you are searching for your ancestors I suggest you
start with the free searches. 
If you are unsuccessful, 
then
try the cornmercial searches, 
especially if they give you
a free search or trial period to see what they have.
There are thousands of free databases. 
We have listed
a few thousand of them in the Worldwide website
Directory at the end of this book. For example, most
state and provincial archives have a website where more
and more material is becoming searchable. 
They range
drastic ally in the amount of information available.
About the world's Largest Free Genealogy Website
As mentione4 the single largest sources of free
genealogical 
records in the world is foun datthe Monnon
church websites mentioned above. As more records are
indexed around the world, they are moved into the free
online databas 
e at www.familysearch.org.
Interestingly, this huge website and search engine is
operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints or Mormons as they are popularly called. I
myself am not a Mormon, but they have made a huge
impact on genealogical research globally. Again, the
Mormon website at www.familysearch.org 
is the single
most important website on our planet for finding free
genealogical information.
7T

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
The genealogy data includes the famous IGI
or International Genealogy Index, which is a
tremendous resource for genealogy for a large
number of countries.
Let me get the legal niceties covered here: this website
is owned by The Corporation of the President of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Inc. The
website's copyright ownership is vested in Intellectual
Reserve, Inc., and the International Genealogy Index
is a trademark owned by Intellectual Reserve, Inc.
The IGI lists millions of births, christenings, 
baptisms
and marrrages in countries around the world. Since a
great many of these records are obtained from parish
registers, the IGI is very valuable because in such
cases, these are records of primary evidence.
The Mormon IGI is particularly strong in certain
countries including the United States, England Wales,
Scotland Mexico, Ireland Germany, Austria, Canada
and Russia.
The IGI records that were used to produce the indexed
database were all microfilmed originally. These
microfilms of scanned documents are stored in massive
vaults in the mountains near Salt Lake City, Utah,
within atomic bomb proof facilities containing a fresh
water supply in the event of a catastrophe or war.
72

Finding People in the Past
For the Mormons themselves, 
the acquiring and storage
of these records is a necessity for church work by their
members. You might notice thatthe IGI index is devoid
of death records and cemetery records, and that's
because of certain beliefs held by Mormons. When
it comes to birth, baptism, christening and marriage
records, however, they are loaded.
The Mormons also maintain their internationally
famous Family History Library in Salt Lake City. This
facility is a place not only used by researchers 
in the
U.S., but by visiting researchers and scholars from
many other countries as well.
The Mormon website also has another set of free
records that are indispensable if you are searching
for people who lived during the 1800s or early 1900s
in England, Wales, Scotland the United States and
Canada. These are the every-name indexes to federal
censuses. They've had very popular census records
indexed for many years now, specifically:
1881 census of England Wales, and Scotland
1880 census of the U.S.A. (all states)
1881 census of Canada (all provinces)
The 1881 censuses mention every family member,
household by househol{ who was alive in those years.
They include the name of every man, woman and
child. Their ages are given, along with birthplaces,
- at 3

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
occupations, marrtal status and many other important
facts as well. Every month more census records for
various years are being added country by country.
In the Worldwide Website Directory included in this
book, I have also listed many other websites providing
various census years for different countries, some as
early as the 1600s and others as recent as 1945.
This book is not meant to be a training manual for
genealogists. 
A discussion of tax lists, school censuses,
assessment 
rolls, cemetery records, burial records, wills
and a plethora of other kinds of records is beyond the
scope of this book. However, the Worldwide Website
Directory will link you to these kinds of records and
much, much more.
I will, however, discuss two particular areas here that
are more specific to Internet searching. Let's discuss
that old standby newspapers, and kick it up a notch
or two.
Newspapers
One of the sources for births, marriages and deaths-
as well as millions of articles and social columns that
might mention the people you seek-are newspapers.
Newspapers were being printed long before vital
records of births, maffrages and deaths were being
t4

Finding People in the Past
collected by 
governments. Some newspapers
published extensive genealogies 
of families who were
early settlers.
The Yarmouth Herald, for example, located in Nova
Scotia, published vast genealogies of New England
families that had branches of the familv who came to
Canada.
The collected genealogies from the Yarmouth Herald
were eventually published between the years 1896
and 1901 . These comprehensive 
genealogies 
included
detailed listings of families, generation by generation,
often beginning in the 1600s and ending in the late
1800s. These newspaper genealogies were compiled
into a massive book and published in 1993.s This
book contains invaluable genealogical data for those
seeking ancestors in the New England states as well
as in Nova Scotia. The descendants 
of these families
today are scattered throughout many other regions of
the U.S. and Canada, and probably in a great many
other countries as well.
In the Worldwide Website Directory you will find
newspaper websites for about 200 different countries.
You can investi gate these on your own as well.
You will find almost every country listed and the
principal newspapers, 
along with links to connect you
directly to the particular newspaper you seek. Many of
75

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
the newspapers 
have email addresses 
included in these
listings.
If you are searching for a lost relative and you know
they lived in a certain crty, why not write a letter to the
editor? It's free, and thousands of people have found
missing family links by taking this simple step. Today
you can contact editors by email, avoiding the cost of
postage, envelope and a drive to the post office.
Digital Newspapers and Indexes
Wouldn't it be nice if you
name ever mentioned in a
year period? Or a century?
could search for anyone's
newspaper over a 40 or 50
It's here alreadv!
Several groups around the world are scanning old
newspapers and using highly sophisticated OCR
(optical character recognition) software to convert
old newspapers into digital data. Once dtgrtrzed other
software creates indexes on any noun mentioned.
This is a researcher's 
dream come true, or at least it's
becoming more true with each passing month.
One of the first companies that caught my attention
near the beginning of newspaper drgttrzation was Cold
North Wnd, Inc., and I have followed their progress
with great anticipation.
76

Finding People in the Past
Their website is at www.paperofrecord.com. They
have drgittzed well over 2l mlllion newspaper pages at
the time of writing. Newspapers in many countries are
being dtgrtrzed. This is necessarily a pay site, but well
worth the money if you see newspapers 
in their list that
you need to search.
Another website, www.newspaperarchive.com, 
claims
to have 993.6 million articles covering 77 | cities,
over a 240 year period, and 2,97 5 titles, as of the time
of writing. I searched on a rare name to sample the
index and got several hundred hits. Again, this is a
subscription site.
Also of particular interest to genealogists 
is the website
http : //www. geneal ogybank. com/gbnlC
At the time of writing www.genealogybank.com 
had
125 million articles, from more than 500,000 issues
of about 2,500 historical U.S. newspapers. These
newspapers were originally published between 1690
and 1980.
They also have the texts online for searching I 1,700
books prior to the year 1900, and I 5 1 ,000 reports, as
well as other lists and documents spanning the years
1789 to 1980. Their website constantly lists newly-
added newspapers and I am impressed with the speed
at which more content is being digittzed and added to
their website.

PERSI - The World's Largest Periodical Index
PERSI, The Periodical Source Index, with more than
1.8 million index entries, is the largest subject index
to genealogical and historical periodical articles in

Library in Fort Wayne, Indiana. This library was
originally known as the Fort Wayne Public Library.
It covers more than 5,000 periodicals written in English
and French (Canada) since the year 1800, although the
articles cover the 1700s to the present.

Introducing the Lost Genealogies
Did you know that there are millions of ancestors in a
very specific collection of books that have never been
indexed?
79

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
Are you aware that many of the libraries and archives
you've probably visited in the past actually have these
books available?You may not have seen them, however,
because they are not in the genealogy collection.
Although researchers may work nearby, comparatively
few of them have delved into this other collection of
books.
This other collection of books contains invaluable
records. Families are recorded generation by generation.
Many of these genealogies start around the late 1800s
and go as far back in time as 1,000 years ago.
Therefore, I have singled out this overlooked collection
of books and I refer to them as the Lost Genealogies. 
If
I were to use the old dictionary meaning of "fabulous,"
it would really apply here. These genealogies are truly
fabulous.
The purpose of the next chapter is to reveal these Lost
Genealogies and to show you why they are the single
most unused source of genealogic 
al data in the world
today.

The Lost Genealogies
Heraldry, Coats ofArms, and Crests
Coats of arms and crests originated many centuries
ago before the general public could read and write.
They were popular throughout Europe, the British Isles
(United Kingdom) and Japan.
Knights and soldiers in battle, often wearing suits of
armor, with their face helmets closed" did not have a
clear view of who was who in the midst of fighting,
and a split second hesitation could mean the difference
between life and death. Certain garments worn over
the armor, and specific symbols emblazoned on their
shields were the fastest way to distinguish between one
of their own or the enemy. They could recognize color
patterns and designs easily, even if they were unable to
read or write.
The coats of arms were generally issued by a central
legal authority in each country, and were usually
reserved for people of noble families and royalty.
In England for example, even today the College of
Arms continues to grant arms to those who are deemed
worthy. The design involves complicated mixes of
symbols, colors and replications of animal furs and
metals, all with certain meanings and characteristics.
83

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anyone
Today you will see coats of anns for cities, provinces,
states and countries and are often part of official seals.
It is important to knoW however,thatthere is generally
no such thing as a coat of arms or crest for a surname.
Coats of arms were granted to individuals, So having
the same surname as someone in the past that had a
coat of arms does not meorr you are a direct descendant
of that person.
Heraldry merchants can be found at fairs, malls, and
even on the Internet. They may show you a picture of
a coat of arms with your surname below it. Beware of
this, unless you know-with genealogical evidence-
that you are a direct descendant of the original person
to whom such arms were granted. Save your money.
Why then, does legitimate heraldry play such an
important part in genealogical research? Applicants
for coats of arms had to attach genealogical evidence
as documentation, which had to be verified as part of
the registration of arms. In some cases the coat of arms
came with extensive genealogy-or at the very least a
brief family history-that's why it is so important.
Such genealogies will trace the ancestry of European
families back into the 1300s and sometimes 
even earlier
than that. It is the most neglected area of genealogical
research.
84

The Lost Genealogies
Genealogies 
attached to coats of arms bridge huge gaps
that are missing in written records. These genealogies
had to be accepted by the authorities granting arms. The
authorities had professional experts who thoroughly
examined all genealogical 
evidence. It was very serious
business.
Remember that although these arms were originally
for noble families, the genealogies 
would nevertheless
often include people that were not of the nobility
themselves, including those who were distantly related
in some way. Many of these marvelous genealogies
would often encompass 
time periods where genealogical
records were either missing or had been destroyed.
More than 250,000 people were awarded coats of arms
in the past. Imagine the genealogies 
and family histories
and the connectivity that would be included among such
a large number ofpeople. I daresay thatmillions ofpeople
would fall under one huge genealogical umbrella.
As more heraldic genealogies are discovered, more
pieces are added to this global jigsaw puzzle that is
truly gigantic in size.
As usual, the pessimists will say most records can
never be found, whereas optimists and realists can say
truthfully that with each passing year, a virtual torrent
of new information is emerging and sometimes it
originates from the most unlikely places.
85

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anyone
How far it will evolve in years to come is anybody's
guess, but it will - without any doubt - continue to
grow larger and larger as we move into the future
where vast storehouses 
of information and knowledge
will reside at our fingertips.
It is also possible that genetics will be able to be
combined with what you know of your family tree, to
actually extend your genealogy - by person if not by
name - back far enough to connect in with ancestors
from centuries ago. Still skeptical? Visit the many
websites involved in DNA sampling. Here are just a
few of many that may surprise you:
www. smgf. org/index j spx
www. ybase . org/de fault. asp
The oldest original books combining heraldry and
genealogy were all painstakingly made by hand. In
a few cases just one original is made. In other cases,
copies were made one by one for a limited number of
patrons, libraries or archives.
The Genealogical Research Library has copied many
of these handwritten books and once the genealogies
are completely indexed, they will make them available.
Once agarn, what was once available only to the
privileged few in the past will be available to everyone,
at little or no cost.
86

The Lost Genealogies
As these books of heraldry with attached genealogies
are assembled together and added to the growing
genealogical databases, the skeptics who predicted
huge gaps would always remain will be proven wrong
once again.
The rest of this chapter contains a few samples of
heraldic designs and the genealogies associated
with them.
I trust that these images 
and copies 
are worth
thousands of words, so I will let them speak for
themselves. These are very real examples of The Lost
Genealogies.

Finding People in
the Present
Dead or Alive?
There is a myriad of reasons why you might want to
locate someone that you believe is living somewhere
in North America. This section will cover techniques
for finding people living in the present, both here and
in many other countries.
If the person you seek was living in the U.S., then
before going through a sequence of searches to find
him or her in the present, you should first check to
see if that person has died recently. For example, you
may be trying to locate an old friend that you went to
school with when you were a child.
The Social Security Death Index (SSDI) is maintained
in the U.S. Social Securitv Administration's Death
Master File.
The names include anyone who had a Social Security
Number (SSN) and whose death was reported to Social
SecurityAdministration, 
and ifbenefits were payable to
the surviving spouse. It contains applications beginning
at the end of I 936, although the vast majority ofrecords
are for those who died between 1965 and the present.
It is updated annually.
1 1 5

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anyw,hen
Currently, my personal favorite free source of this
index is maintained at www.newenglandancestors.org.
updated to 2005, the ssDI contains the names of about
75 million people. The exact address for the SSDI is:
http : I I www.newenglandancestors 
.orgl database_
search/ssdi.asp
If you find the person you seek, you can also order
a copy of their original SSN application form. That
application usually shows the full name (and in the
case of women, their maiden name), place of birth,
date of birth, their address at the time of application,
color, the names of parents including the maiden name
of the mother, and the signature of the applicant. The
signature is very important for comparing to wills,
deeds and other important documents the deceased
may have signed.
Once you locate data in the SSDI, you can then
order a copy of the Application for a Social
Security Number (SS-5). To request a copy of a
SS-5 form, you must send a letter to the Social
Security Administration (pursuant to the Freedom
of InformationAct) with the details of the individual
in question. Your letter must include: the name of
the individual, the social security number, date and
place of death and reason the information is wanted
(family history is an acceptable reason). You will
1 1 6

Finding People in the Present
need to inquire what the charge is-fees have been
rising. Send your letter to:
Social Security Administration
Freedom of Information Officer
4-H-8 Annex Building
6401 Security Blvd.
Baltimore. MD 21235
One last search you might want to do, however, before
searching for a living person, is to check out www.
interment.net for cemetery listings, especially if you
know the likely state or a tri-state area where he or she
might have died.
Once you have carried out the SSDI search, if you do
not find a record indicating death and benefits, then
it is quite possible that the person you are seeking is
actually alive today. In that case, the following section
will prove most useful. Finding an old friend from
years tgo, or finding a long-lost relative, can be a very
exciting experience.
U.S. - Searching for a Living Person
A recent and very powerful search used by
governments, lawyers, businesses, 
professional skip
tracers and individu.als is available at
www.zabasearch.com
lt7

Finding An))one, Anywhere, Anywhen
Free search results will often include the last several
addresses 
of an individual. In many cases it often reveals
the birthyear, month or date so you can use a process of
elimination to zero in on the person you seek.
Another bonus-search results will often include
telephone numbers (don't be surprised to see both
listed and unlisted numbers).
Zabasearch claims that this free public information
is collected from phone listings, court records, real
property records, subscriptions etc. In other words,
they claim that their sources are publicly available
government records and commercial sources.
For those with an investigative trait, zabasearch offers
a background check for a fee, which may provide a lot
of information about an individual.
Once you have the street address in Zabasearch, you
can go to www.terraserver.com 
for a satellite image of
the area. To get driving instructions and road maps, go
to the popular www.mapquest.com. 
This is also a very
useful website if you are vacationing anywhere in the
U.S. and Canada.
New and impressive technology will soon be available
from www.pictometry.com. 
They will be able to provide
images of buildings and homes in 3D technology with
45-degree angle photography. 
A sample is avarlable on
1 1 8

Finding People in the Present
the website. It will provide excellent visualizatron for
91 1 emergency calls as well as an unlimited number of
other uses.
Althou gh zaba means free, this search may not be free
in the near future. I would not be surprised to see an
annual subscription fee or minimum annual purchase
of one background check per year, for example - time
will tell. At the time of writing this website search is
in beta or testing mode and is free unless you want a
background search.

More than a decade ago, white and yellow page listings
began appearing on the Internet. Today, it is relatively
easy to acquire mailing addresses and telephone
numbers along with postal or zip codes.
Telephone Directories Worldwide
Websites that cover white and yellow pages in the U.S.
or Canada or both include:
1 1 9

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
www.whitepages.com
http : //www. superpage 
s. com/? SRC-insp
www.411.com
www.switchboard.com
In England and the UK, check out www. l92.com
which as well as directories, has an amazing set of
electoral rolls covering the years 2002 to 2008. These
even allow investigators to verify the ages of people
in some years. I'm certain that these kinds of searches
will be in strong demand in the future in many other
countries.
To locate telephone directories in other countries, I
will first assume you have read the section on search
engines. If so, then the easiest way is to use a search
engine and enter white pages Sweden, for example. In
some countries, what we call white pages (in North
Americ a) are actually known as yellow pages in some
other countries, so the alternative technique is to enter
into a search engine yellow pages followed by the
name of the country. Experiment with naming a large
city rather than a country if you have no success.
Contacting people by telephone is not all that expensive
compared to years 4go, and costs have been coming
down thanks to websites like www.magtcjack.com and
wwwjaxtr.com. Remember too that people having the
same surname and living in the same area as the person
you seek may know the person you're looking for. I've
t20

Finding People in the Present
used white page searches effectively many times over
the past two decades. Often this search has located the
person I was seeking after all other search techniques
had failed.
What ,f yo, don't lcnow the surname?
Believe it or not, there is a way of searching for someone
if you don't have a surnaffie, or if you have forgotten
the surname. It is a simple three-step process that is
easy once you know how!
(1.) Go to www.intelius.com and select a state, enter
the first name and if you know the initial for the middle
name enter it also. The more information you can
supply, the better. Also, & rare or unusual given name
will produce a manageable list of search results.
(2.) Search. The results can then be examined. You will
see a list of people with the first names and initials you
provided, along with their acfual surnames. You may
recognrze the surname if you have forgoffen it, but even if
you don't, you have a list of possible names to check out.
And how do you check them out? Copy the list or print it
out on a sheet of paper, and proceed to the next step.
(3.) Go to www.41 I .com and enter the full name details
you now have, and the state. The search results usually
provide you with the fulI address and telephone number
in most instances.
r2l

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
If you find who you are looking for, you can call them
to ensure you have the right person and not someone
else who just happens to have the same name as the
person you seek. Don't ever make assumptions about
this. Once you think you have found the right person,
you can go back to www.intelius.com and order a
background search to see if you have a match (former
addresses, 
etc.).
This search technique works well at the time of writing,
but may not be available in the future. The future is
uncertain, however, so there may acfually be several
ways of carrying out this type of search.
Searching for the Living: Worldwide
Another way of finding someone living today is to use
quotation marks around the person's name (include
their middle name or initial if you have it) in a search
engine. Search engine techniques are outlined in a
previous chapter. This is a very powerful search, global
in its scope, and should never be overlooked. Also, use
the advanced features in the search engine to narrow
your search even more. If you don't use the advanced
features you are not doing the best job of searching.
Your next step would be to check newspapers. The
chapter, Finding People in the Past, ends with a careful
outline of how to locate newspapers in any country, and
more importantly, how to search digital newspapers
r22

Finding People in the Present
online. Since many of the newspapers are indexed by
every name, up to the present date, you can search for
a living person, either today (literally), or during the
last decade, for example.
Digital newspapers 
with digital indexes to every name
mentioned therein are a very new type of resource
that will have a profound effect on all researchers and
biographers in the near future. While many genealogists
are using them already, chances are the number of
people using this technique will grow rapidly. Many
people alive today, including those who might be called
hermits or obscure crttzens by others, can be located in
this manner.
Dead or Alive in Canada
Zabasearch does not currently extend into Canada, but
one website that caters to companies as clients to carry
out background checks, credit reports and criminal
records is www.backcheck.net.
In Canada, nothing similar to the SSDI exists for
public access yet, but there are excellent indexes to
cemeteries, the most notable of which are the OCFA5
and OCFA6 (Ontario Cemetery Finding Aid) and the
BCCFA (British Columbia Cemetery Finding Aid).
Ontario is the most populated province and the OCEA5
and OCFA6 are indexes to people buried in Ontario.
123

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
One major disadvantage is that it does not include the
date or year of burial. While this is a serious missing
piece of data, this search does provide a great benefit to
persons who had either uncommon surnames or given
names. Also, if you know the county where an ancestor
might be burie4 this search is very helpful. The city of
Toronto is not covered very well in the OCFA search,
but Mt. Pleasant Cemetery and its associated 
cemeteries
have very complete computertzed records on site.
The OCFA search has the names of more than three
million people. To search, go to:
www. i slandnet. com/oc fa
The BCCFA is similar, but it does contain dates. It is
very valuable for locating burials in British Columbia.
This is a free search of the burial records of 344,000
people, and is available from:
www. i s landnet. com/b c c fa
The Alberta Genealogical Society has been indexing
cemeteries throughout the province and will do limited
searches for a $2 fee at the time of writing. Check for
updates at:
http : I I ab gensoc. 
calnameindex.html
124

Finding People in the Present
New Brunswick has more than 217,000 cemetery
records available. They are loc ated at:
http : I I ar chtve s . gnb . cal APP S A{B C emeteri e s/
D e fault. aspx? L-EN&PageLo ad-Form
Genealogical Societies
In each province, genealogical societies and their
branches have indexed many of the cemeteries in their
district or county, often with full extracts and dates.
The advantage is that you usually find the person you
seek along with other family members mentioned on
the gravestone or on a cluster of family stones.
Large Libraries
If you live in Can ada, then sizeable regional libraries,
provincial libraries, and provincial archives have
extensive collections of other useful documents.
As well-and always worthy ofnote-the Metropolitan
Toronto Reference Library (MTRL) is Canada's largest
public reference library. It has an excellent collection
of records covering many provinces, and tnfact, many
countries.

Their catalog of holdings as well the holdings of all
other Toronto Public Libraries can be accessed at:

Also in Toronto, the North York Public Library has a
very large collection of genealogical books and films
covering most of Canada. They can be reached at:

And now, let's step into the future together.
r26

The Future Internet
Where is the Internet headed in the future?
I provided an answer to this years d5o, in the first
edition of this book, and the answer remains so simple
that it is almost elusive to the experts.
If you can speak with a child or if you can think for a
moment like a teenager, the answer is plainly evident.
If you ask a child when he would like to hear his favorite
song he will say right now. If you needed to know the
population of a country for a paper you are writing, you
want it now. This idea of the instant world has led us to
calling young people The Now Generation.
What we want is now.
If you extrapolate that and look at the World Wide Web
and picture it as the source of instant everythirg, then
you will see where the web is going. Some corporations
and governments may arrive struggling, kicking and
screamirg, but they will be inevitably dragged along
by the people towards the eventual outcome: Instant
information, instant media, the past and the present-
all available, now.
Already television cable companies have responded to
this public pressure - you and your family may want
t27

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
to watch a certain movie at 6 p.m., stop the movie for
supper at 7 p.m., start it up agarn at 8 p.m. and put it
on pause while you get a snack, take a break, or when
you want to create your own intermission.
In this case, the media is bending to your timetable and
needs, instead of forcing you to bend to an artificial
timetable that is not related to, nor cognrzant of, your
personal needs.
People don't want to build their lives around the me dra,
they want the media to be responsive to their desires at the
very moment they want it. And it is already headed in that
direction. Convergence 
will escalate into new territory.
If it is cheap enough or freely included in a monthly
service fee, the public will respond. Google learned
this early, as well as other websites, large and small.
The Internet has proved this time and time again,
and created many millionaires simply because they
caught sight of what the people wanted, and they met
these needs.
All music, all motionpictures, all history, all geography,
all education, all art, all music, all art forms, all
knowledg., will be wanted on that instant basis. That
is the ultimate goal of the future Internet.
If a teacher is world famous because students find
him or her to be one of the best, then why shouldn't
a million people be able to tune in to that inspiring
128

The Future Internet
teacher and repeat the lesson or speed it up, based on
their own progress? Why shouldn't they learn at their
own speed and still be able to gather in groups and
forums and socialize with others?
This is the most probable desired future, and we are
moving rapidly in that direction.
In the 1980s, I was told that a patent of a new invention
in Europe would take an average of five years before
U.S. researchers 
became aware of it. This was called
the technology gap.Now that five-year gap is almost
instantaneous.
Several thousand years z3o, the prophet Daniel
predicted that the day would come when
.. .knowledge would cover the earth as the
waves cover the sea.
In 1947 and agarn in a reprinted edition in 1960, Philip
Wylie, in his book, An Essay on Morals. stated,
American or Russian, Chinaman, Jup,
Hindu, or Briton - we are all on this same
planet which has become boat-sized (all) of
a sudden.r
In 1 962,Marshall Mcluhan, in his book, The Gutenberg
Galaxy, wrote about a global electronic village where
he envisioned a shared information space-an invisible
129

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
place where space and time were no longer barriers to
acquiring knowledge.2
That time is now, and for better rather than worse, the
personal computer and the Internet may eventually
become the communicative glue that helps to link
mankind into a fabric of oneness, creating a new
bond of kinship that would include all races, cultures,
sciences and religions.

T-he Wbrldwide
Website 
Directory
The balance of this book contains a directory of several
thousand websites, located in more than 250 countries,
states and provinces. To create this directory, over
25,000 websites were visited and examined.
If you spend just a few minutes reading the instructions
below, and you will be searching like a professional in
minutes.
( 1) First, select the country, or religious group, or ethnic
group you wish to research, and you are on your way. If
you have (or can borrow) a scanner with OCR capability,
you can scan your chosen list, and then change the
scanned image into digital text. That's the key.
(2) Then, copy your digital list of websites into an
email. Then, at the very end of each website link, press
the enter button on your keyboard and you should
instantly create a hyperlink. Continue down the list
changing each website address into a link.
(3) Then, send the email to yourself. When it arrives,
you can then click on any link and travel instantly to
the selected website. Another way to accomplish the
same thing would be to copy the web links you created
1 3 1

Finding Anyone, Anywhere, Anywhen
in your email, into a Word document instead, for easy
reference.
As you know, websites URLs can change, so over
time from this publication date there will be some
updating required to keep things current in the website
directory.
Please note that the directory will be regularly updated
through membership in www.grl.com or you can use
search engines to add additional websites suitable for
your own personal objectives.
Meanwhile, whoever you are looking for, I wish you
good hunting!
