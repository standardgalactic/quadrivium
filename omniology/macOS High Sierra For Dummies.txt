Introduction      1
Introduction
Y
ou made the right choice twice: macOS High Sierra (version 10.13) and this 
book. Take a deep breath and get ready to have a rollicking good time. That’s 
right. This is a computer book, but it’s fun. What a concept! Whether you’re 
brand spanking new to the Mac or a grizzled Mac vet, I guarantee that reading 
this book to discover the ins and outs of macOS High Sierra will make everything 
easier. The publisher couldn’t say as much on the cover if it weren’t true!
About This Book
This book’s roots lie with my international best seller Macintosh System 7.5 For 
Dummies, an award-winning book so good that long-deceased Mac clone-maker 
Power Computing gave away a copy with every Mac clone it sold. macOS High Sierra 
For Dummies is the latest revision and has been, once again, completely updated 
to include all the tasty goodness in macOS High Sierra. In other words, this edi-
tion combines all the old, familiar features of dozens of previous editions — but 
is once again updated to reflect the latest and greatest offering from Apple as well 
as feedback from readers.
Why write a For Dummies book about High Sierra? Well, High Sierra is a big, some-
what complicated personal-computer operating system. So, I made macOS High 
Sierra For Dummies a not-so-big, not-too-complicated book that shows you what 
High Sierra is all about without boring you to tears, confusing you, or poking you 
with sharp objects.
In fact, I think you’ll be so darned comfortable that I wanted the title to be macOS 
High Sierra Made Easy, but the publishers wouldn’t let me. Apparently, we Dummies 
authors have to follow some rules, and using Dummies in this book’s title is one 
of them.
And speaking of dummies — remember, that’s just a word. I don’t think you’re 
a dummy at all — quite the opposite! My second choice for this book’s title was 
macOS High Sierra For People Smart Enough to Know They Need This Book, but you can 
just imagine what Wiley thought of that.

The book is chock-full of information and advice, explaining everything you need 
to know about macOS High Sierra in language you can understand — along with 
timesaving tips, tricks, techniques, and step-by-step instructions, all served up 
in generous quantities.
Another rule we Dummies authors must follow is that our books cannot exceed a 
certain number of pages. (Brevity is the soul of wit, and all that.) So, while I wish 
I could have included some things that didn’t fit, I feel confident you’ll find what 
you need to know about macOS High Sierra in this book.
Still, a few things bear further looking into, such as these:
»
» Information about many of the applications (programs) that come with 
macOS High Sierra: An installation of macOS High Sierra includes roughly 
50 applications, mostly located in the Applications and Utilities folders. I’d love 
to walk you through each one of them, but that would have required a book a 
whole lot bigger, heavier, and more expensive than this one.
I brief you on the handful of bundled applications essential to using macOS 
High Sierra and keep the focus there — namely, Calendar, Contacts, 
Messages, Mail, Safari, Siri, TextEdit, and the like — as well as several impor-
tant utilities you may need to know how to use someday.
»
» Information about Microsoft Office, Apple lifestyle and productivity apps 
(iMovie, Numbers, Pages, and so on), Adobe Photoshop, Quicken, and 
other third-party applications: Okay, if all the gory details of all the bundled 
(read: free) macOS High Sierra applications don’t fit here, I think you’ll under-
stand why digging into third-party applications that cost extra was out of the 
question.
»
» Information about programming for the Mac: This book is about using 
macOS High Sierra, not writing code for it. Dozens of books — most of which 
are two or three times the size of this book — cover programming on the Mac; 
this one doesn’t.
Within this book, you may note that some web addresses break across two lines 
of text. If you’re reading this book in print and want to visit one of these web 
pages, simply key in the web address exactly as it’s noted in the text, pretending 
as though the line break doesn’t exist. If you’re reading this as an e-book, you’ve 
got it easy — just click the web address to be taken directly to the web page.

Foolish Assumptions
Although I know what happens when you make assumptions, I’ve made a few 
anyway.
First, I assume that you, gentle reader, know nothing about using macOS  — 
beyond knowing what a Mac is, that you want to use macOS, that you want to 
understand macOS without having to digest an incomprehensible technical man-
ual, and that you made the right choice by selecting this particular book. And so 
I do my best to explain each new concept in full and loving detail. Maybe that’s 
foolish, but . . . that’s how I roll.
Oh, and I also assume that you can read. If you can’t, ignore this paragraph.
Icons Used in This Book
Little pictures (icons) appear off to the left side of the text throughout this book. 
Consider these icons miniature road signs, telling you a little something extra 
about the topic at hand. Here’s what the different icons look like and what they 
all mean.
Look for Tip icons to find the juiciest morsels: shortcuts, tips, and undocumented 
secrets about High Sierra. Try them all; impress your friends!
When you see this icon, it means that this particular morsel is something that I 
think you should memorize (or at least write on your shirt cuff).
Put on your propeller-beanie hat and pocket protector; these parts include the 
truly geeky stuff. It’s certainly not required reading, but it must be interesting or 
informative, or I wouldn’t have wasted your time with it.
Read these notes very, very, very carefully. (Did I say very?) Warning icons flag 
important cautionary information. The author and publisher won’t be respon-
sible if your Mac explodes or spews flaming parts because you ignored a Warning 
icon. Just kidding. Macs don’t explode or spew (with the exception of a few choice 
PowerBook 5300s, which won’t run High Sierra anyway). But I got your attention, 
didn’t I?
Well, now, what could this icon possibly be about? Named by famous editorial 
consultant Mr. Obvious, this icon highlights all things new and different in macOS 
High Sierra.

Where to Go from Here
The first few chapters of this book are where I describe the basic things that you 
need to understand to operate your Mac effectively. If you’re new to Macs and 
macOS High Sierra, start there.
macOS High Sierra is only slightly different from previous Mac operating sys-
tems, and the first part of the book presents concepts so basic that if you’ve been 
using a Mac for long, you might think you know it all — and okay, you might 
know most of it. But remember that not-so-old-timers need a solid foundation, 
too. So here’s my advice: Skim through stuff you already know and you’ll get to 
the better stuff sooner.
I would love to hear how this book worked for you. So please send me your 
thoughts, platitudes, likes and dislikes, and any other comments. Did this book 
work for you? What did you like? What didn’t you like? What questions were 
unanswered? Did you want to know more (or less) about something? Tell me! I 
have received more than 100 suggestions about previous editions, many of which 
are incorporated here. So please (please!) keep up the good work! Email me at 
HighSierraForDummies@boblevitus.com. I appreciate your feedback, and I try to 
respond to all reasonably polite email within a few days.
So what are you waiting for? Go! Enjoy the book!

ongratulate yourself on choosing macOS High Sierra 10.13, the 14th release of 
the venerable operating system (OS) formerly known as OS X. Congratulate 
yourself for scoring more than just an OS upgrade. See, macOS High Sierra 
includes a few new features that make using your Mac even easier, plus hundreds 
of tweaks to help you do more work in less time.
In this chapter, I start at the very beginning and talk about macOS in mostly 
abstract terms; then I move on to explain what you need to know to use macOS 
High Sierra successfully.
If you’ve been using macOS (formerly OS X) for a while, most of the information 
in this chapter may seem hauntingly familiar; a number of features that I describe 
haven’t changed in years. But if you decide to skip this chapter because you think 
you have all the new stuff figured out, I assure you that you’ll miss at least a

couple of things that Apple didn’t bother to tell you (as if you read every word in 
macOS Help — the only user manual Apple provides — anyway!).
Tantalized? Let’s rock.
Gnawing to the Core of macOS
The operating system (that is, the OS part of macOS) is what makes your Mac 
a Mac. Without it, your Mac is nothing but a pile of silicon and circuits — no 
smarter than a toaster.
“So what does an operating system do?” you ask. Good question. The short answer 
is that an OS controls the basic and most important functions of your computer. In 
the case of macOS and your Mac, the operating system
»
» Manages memory
»
» Controls how windows, icons, and menus work
»
» Keeps track of files
»
» Manages networking and security
»
» Does housekeeping (No kidding!)
Other forms of software, such as word processors and web browsers, rely on the 
OS to create and maintain the environment in which they work their magic. When 
you create a memo, for example, the word processor provides the tools for you to 
type and format the information and save it in a file. In the background, the OS 
is the muscle for the word processor, performing the following crucial functions:
»
» Providing the mechanism for drawing and moving the onscreen window in 
which you write the memo
»
» Keeping track of the file when you save it
»
» Helping the word processor create drop-down menus and dialogs for you to 
interact with
»
» Communicating with other programs
»
» And much, much more (stuff that only geeks could care about)
So, armed with a little background in operating systems, take a gander at the next 
section before you do anything else with your Mac.

CHAPTER 1  macOS High Sierra 101 (Prerequisites: None)     9
One last thing: As I mention in this book’s Introduction (I’m repeating it here in 
case you normally don’t read introductions), macOS High Sierra comes with more 
than 50 applications in its Applications folder. Although I’d love to tell you all 
about each and every one, I have only so many pages at my disposal.
THE MAC ADVANTAGE
Most of the world’s personal computers use Microsoft Windows (although more and 
more people are switching to the Mac). But you’re among the lucky few to have a com-
puter with an OS that’s intuitive, easy to use, and (dare I say?) fun. If you don’t believe 
me, try using Windows for a day or two. Go ahead. You probably won’t suffer any perma-
nent damage. In fact, you’ll really begin to appreciate how good you have it. Feel free to 
hug your Mac. Or give it a peck on the mouse or trackpad.
As someone once told me, “Claiming that macOS is inferior to Windows because more 
people use Windows is like saying that all other restaurants serve food that’s inferior to 
McDonald’s.”
We might be a minority, but Mac users have the best, most stable, most modern all-
purpose operating system in the world, and here’s why: Unix, on which macOS is based, 
is widely regarded as the best industrial-strength operating system on the planet. For 
now, just know that being based on Unix means that a Mac running macOS will crash 
less often than an older (pre-OS X) Mac or most Windows machines, which means less 
downtime. Being Unix-based also means getting far fewer viruses and encounters with 
malicious software. But perhaps the biggest advantage macOS has is that when an appli-
cation crashes, it doesn’t crash your entire computer, and you don’t have to restart the 
computer to continue working.
By the way, since the advent of Intel-powered Macs more than a decade ago, you can 
run Windows natively also on any Mac powered by an Intel processor, as I describe in 
Chapter 20. Note that the opposite isn’t true: You can run Windows on your Mac if you 
care to, but you cannot run macOS on a Dell or HP or any other computer not made by 
Apple (at least not without serious hacking, which is technically illegal anyway).
And don’t let that Unix or Windows stuff scare you. It’s there if you want it, but if you 
don’t want it or don’t care (like most users), you’ll rarely even know it’s there. In fact, 
you’ll rarely (if ever) see the word Unix or Windows again in this book. As far as you’re 
concerned, Unix under the hood means your Mac will just run and run and run without 
crashing and crashing and crashing. As for Windows, your Mac can run it if you need it; 
otherwise, it’s just another checklist item on the list of reasons Macs are better than PCs.

10     PART 1  macOS Basics
A Safety Net for the Absolute Beginner 
(or Any User)
In the following sections, I deal with the stuff that macOS Help doesn’t cover — 
or doesn’t cover in nearly enough detail. If you’re a first-time Mac user, please, 
please read this section of the book carefully; it could save your life. Okay, okay, 
perhaps I’m being overly dramatic. What I mean to say is that reading this section 
could save your Mac or your sanity. Even if you’re an experienced Mac user, you 
may want to read this section. Chances are you’ll see at least a few things you’ve 
forgotten that will come in handy now that you’ve been reminded of them.
Turning the dang thing on
Okay. This is the big moment — turning on your Mac! Gaze at it longingly first, 
and say something cheesy, such as, “You’re the most awesome computer I’ve ever 
known.” If that doesn’t turn on your Mac (and it probably won’t), read on.
Apple, in its infinite wisdom, has manufactured Macs with power buttons on 
every conceivable surface: on the front, side, and back of the computer itself, and 
even on the keyboard and monitor.
So if you don’t know how to turn on your Mac, don’t feel bad; just look in the 
manual or booklet that came with your Mac. It’s at least one thing that the docu-
mentation always covers.
You don’t have that little booklet? Most Macs have the power button in the upper-
right corner of the keyboard (notebooks) or at the back of the screen (iMacs); it 
usually looks like the little circle thingy you see in the margin.
Don’t bother choosing Help ➪ Mac Help, which opens the Help Viewer program. 
It can’t tell you where the switch is. Although the Help program is good for find-
ing out a lot of things, the location of the power button isn’t among them. If you 
haven’t found the switch and turned on the Mac, of course, you can’t access Help 
anyway. (D’oh!)
Launch the iBooks app and search the iBooks Store for the name of your Mac plus 
the word Essentials (for example, “MacBook Essentials,” “iMac Essentials,” or 
“MacBook Pro Essentials”). Click the Only Show Free Titles check box near the 
upper-right corner of the iBooks window, and grab the free Essentials e-book 
with your Mac’s name, by Apple. At around 100 pages, this booklet isn’t in any 
way comprehensive, but it does include information you won’t find elsewhere, 
including where to find the power button on your particular Mac.

CHAPTER 1  macOS High Sierra 101 (Prerequisites: None)     11
What you should see on startup
When you finally do turn on your Mac, you set 
in motion a sophisticated and complex series of 
events that culminates in the loading of macOS 
and the appearance of the macOS desktop. After 
a small bit of whirring, buzzing, and flashing 
(meaning that the OS is loading), macOS first 
tests all your hardware  — slots, ports, disks, 
random access memory (RAM), and so on. If 
everything passes, you hear a pleasing musi-
cal tone and see the tasteful whitish Apple 
logo in the middle of your screen, as shown in 
Figure 1-1.
Here are the things that you might see when you 
power-up your Mac:
»
» Login screen: You might or might not see the macOS login screen, where you 
enter your name and password. If you do, press Return after you type your 
name and password, and away you go.
If you don’t want to type your name and password every time you start or 
restart your Mac (or even if you do), check out Chapter 20 for the scoop on 
how to turn the login screen on or off.
You should turn off the login screen only if you’re confident you’ll be the 
only one touching the machine. With the login screen disabled, your Mac 
and everything in it is completely available to anyone, which is usually not a 
good thing.
Either way, the desktop soon materializes before your eyes. If you haven’t 
customized, configured, or tinkered with your desktop, it should look pretty 
much like Figure 1-2. Now is a good time to take a moment for positive 
thoughts about the person who convinced you that you wanted a Mac. That 
person was right!
»
» Blue/black/gray screen of death: If any of your hardware fails when it’s 
tested, you may see a blue, black, or gray screen.
Some older Macs played the sound of a horrible car wreck instead of the 
chimes, complete with crying tires and busting glass. It was exceptionally 
unnerving, which might be why Apple doesn’t use it anymore.
The fact that something went wrong is no reflection on your prowess as a Mac 
user. Something is broken, and your Mac may need repairs. If this is happen-
ing to you right now, check out Chapter 20 to try to get your Mac well again.
FIGURE 1-1: 
This is what you’ll see if every-
thing is fine and dandy when 
you turn on your Mac.

12     PART 1  macOS Basics
If your computer is under warranty, set up a Genius Bar appointment at your 
nearest Apple Store or dial 1-800-SOS-APPL, and a customer service person 
can tell you what to do. Before you do anything, though, skip ahead to 
Chapter 23. It’s entirely possible that one of the suggestions there will get 
you back on track without your having to spend even a moment on hold.
»
» Prohibitory sign or flashing question mark in a folder: Most users eventu-
ally encounter the prohibitory sign or flashing question mark in a folder (as 
shown in the margin). These icons mean that your Mac can’t find a startup 
disk, hard drive, network server, or DVD-ROM containing a valid Mac operating 
system. See Chapter 23 for ways to ease your Mac’s ills.
»
» Kernel panic: You may occasionally see a block of text in several languages, 
including English, as shown in Figure 1-3. This means that your Mac has 
experienced a kernel panic, the most severe type of system crash. If you 
restart your Mac and see either message again, look in Chapter 23 for a 
myriad of possible cures for all kinds of ailments, including this one.

If this is what 
you’re seeing, 
things are

not fine and 
dandy.

CHAPTER 1  macOS High Sierra 101 (Prerequisites: None)     13
How do you know which version of the macOS your computer has? Simple:
1.	 Choose About This Mac from the  menu (the menu with the  symbol in 
the top-left corner of the menu bar).
A window pops up on your screen, as shown in Figure 1-4. The version you’re 
running appears just below macOS near the top of the window. Version 10.13 
is the release we know as High Sierra.
If you’re curious or just want to impress your friends, OS X version 10.12 
was known as Sierra; 10.11 was El Capitan; 10.10 was Yosemite; 10.9 was 
Mavericks; 10.8 was Mountain Lion; 10.7 was Lion; 10.6 was Snow Leopard; 
10.5 was Leopard; 10.4 was Tiger; 10.3 was Panther; 10.2 was Jaguar; 10.1 was 
Puma; and 10.0 was Cheetah.
2.	 (Optional) Click the Displays, Storage, Support, or Service tabs to see 
additional details about your Mac.
3.	 Click the System Report button to launch the System Information 
application and see even more details.
The System Information app shows you even more about your Mac, including 
bus speed, number of processors, caches, installed memory, networking, 
storage devices, and much more. You can find more about this useful program 
in Chapter 22.
Shutting down properly
Turning off the power without shutting down your Mac properly is one of the 
worst things you can do to your poor Mac. Shutting down your Mac improperly 
can really screw up your hard or solid-state drive, scramble the contents of your 
most important files, or both.
FIGURE 1-4: 
See which  
version of 
macOS you’re 
running.

14     PART 1  macOS Basics
If a thunderstorm is rumbling nearby, or you’re unfortunate enough to have roll-
ing blackouts where you live, you may really want to shut down your Mac and 
unplug it from the wall. (See the next section, where I briefly discuss lightning 
and your Mac.) If it’s a laptop, you can just disconnect it from its charging cable 
and continue using it if you like.
To turn off your Mac, always use the Shut Down command from the 
 menu or 
shut down in one of these kind and gentle ways:
»
» Press the power button for approximately two seconds and then click the 
Shut Down button in the Are You Sure You Want to Shut Down Your 
Computer Now? dialog.
»
» On keyboards that don’t have a power key, press Control+Eject instead, and 
then click the Shut Down button that appears in the Are You Sure You Want to 
Shut Down Your Computer Now? dialog.
You can use a handy keyboard shortcut when the Shut Down button (or any 
button, for that matter) is highlighted in blue and pulsating slightly. Pressing 
the Return key is the same as clicking whichever button is highlighted.
ETERNALLY YOURS . . . NOW
macOS is designed so that you never have to shut it down. You can configure it to sleep 
after a specified period of inactivity. (See Chapter 20 for more info on Energy Saver.) If 
you do so, your Mac will consume very little electricity when it’s sleeping and will usually 
be ready to use (when you press any key or click the mouse) in a few seconds. On the 
other hand, if you’re not going to be using your Mac for a few days, you might want to 
shut it down anyway.
Note: If you leave your Mac on constantly, and you’re gone when a lightning storm or 
rolling blackout hits, your Mac might get hit by a power surge or worse. So be sure you 
have adequate protection — say, a decent surge protector designed for computers — if 
you decide to leave your Mac on and unattended for long periods. See the section “A few 
things you should definitely not do with your Mac,” elsewhere in this chapter, for more 
info on lightning and your Mac. Often as not, I leave it on when I’m on the road so that I 
can access it from my laptop via remote screen sharing. So, because macOS is designed 
to run 24/7, I don’t shut it down at night unless the night happens to be dark and stormy.
One last thing: If your Mac is a laptop and will be enclosed in a bag or briefcase for more 
than a few hours, turn it off. Otherwise, it could overheat — even in Sleep mode.

CHAPTER 1  macOS High Sierra 101 (Prerequisites: None)     15
The Are You Sure You Want to Shut Down Your Computer Now? dialog sports a 
check box option: Reopen Windows When Logging Back In. If you select this check 
box, your Mac will start back up with the same windows (and applications) that 
were open when you shut down or restarted. I think that’s pretty darn sweet, but 
you can clear the check box and disable this option if that’s not what you want!
Most Mac users have been forced to shut down improperly more than once without 
anything horrible happening, of course — but don’t be lulled into a false sense of 
security. Break the rules one time too many (or under the wrong circumstances), 
and your most important files could be toast. The only time you should turn off 
your Mac without shutting down properly is when your screen is completely fro-
zen or when your system crashed due to a kernel panic and you’ve already tried 
everything else. (See Chapter 23 for a list of those “everything elses.”) A stubborn 
crash doesn’t happen often — and less often under macOS (formerly OS X) than 
ever before — but when it does, forcing your Mac to turn off and then back on 
might be the only solution.
A few things you should definitely not do 
with your Mac
In this section, I cover the bad stuff that can happen to your computer if you 
do the wrong things with it. If something bad has already happened to you . . . . 
I know, I’m beginning to sound like a broken record, but see Chapter 23.
»
» Don’t unplug your Mac when it’s turned on. Very bad things can happen, 
such as having your OS break. See the preceding section, where I discuss 
shutting down your system properly.
Note that this warning doesn’t apply to laptops as long as their battery is at 
least partially charged. As long as there’s enough juice in the battery to power 
your Mac, you can connect and disconnect its power adapter to your heart’s 
content.
»
» Don’t use your Mac when lightning is near. Here’s a simple life equation 
for you: Mac + lightning = dead Mac. ’Nuff said. Oh, and don’t place much 
faith in inexpensive surge protectors. A good jolt of lightning will fry the 
surge protector and everything plugged into it, including computers, 
modems, printers, and hubs. Some surge protectors can withstand most 
lightning strikes, but those warriors aren’t the cheapies that you buy at your 
local computer emporium. Unplugging your Mac from the wall during 
electrical storms is safer and less expensive. (Don’t forget to unplug your 
external modem, network hubs, printers, and other hardware that plugs into 
the wall as well; lightning can fry them, too.)

16     PART 1  macOS Basics
For laptops, disconnect the power adapter and all other cables because 
whatever those cables are connected to could fry — and fry your laptop 
right along with it. After you do that, you can use your laptop during a storm 
if you care to. Just make sure that it’s 100 percent wireless and cableless 
when you do.
»
» Don’t jostle, bump, shake, kick, throw, dribble, or punt your Mac, 
especially while it’s running. Many older Macs contain a hard drive that 
spins at 5,200 revolutions per minute (rpm) or more. A jolt to a hard drive 
while it’s reading or writing a file can cause the head to crash into the disk, 
which can render many — or all — files on it unrecoverable. Ouch!
Don’t think you’re exempt if your Mac uses a solid-state drive with no moving 
parts. A good bump to your Mac could damage other components. Treat your 
Mac like it’s a carton of eggs, and you’ll never be sorry.
»
» Don’t forget to back up your data! If the files on your hard drive mean 
anything to you, you must back up. Not maybe. Must. Even if your most 
important file is your last saved game of Bejeweled, you still need to back up 
your files. Fortunately, High Sierra includes an awesome backup utility called 
Time Machine. (Unfortunately, you need either an external hard drive or an 
Apple Time Capsule device to take advantage of it.) So I beg you: Please read 
Chapter 21 now, and find out how to back up before something horrible 
happens to your valuable data!
I strongly recommend that you read Chapter 21 sooner rather than later — 
preferably before you do any significant work on your Mac. Dr. Mac says, 
“There are only two kinds of Mac users: Those who have lost data and those 
who will.” Which kind do you want to be?
»
» Don’t kiss your monitor while wearing stuff on your lips. For obvious 
reasons! Use a clean, soft microfiber cloth and OmniCleanz display cleaning 
solution (I love the stuff, made by RadTech; www.radtech.us) to clean your 
display.
Definitely do not use household window cleaners or paper towels. Either one 
can harm your display. Use a soft clean cloth (preferably microfiber), and if 
you’re going to use a cleaner, make sure it’s specifically designed not to harm 
computer displays. Finally, spray the cleaner on the cloth, not on the screen.
Point-and-click boot camp
Are you new to the Mac? Just figuring out how to move the mouse around? Now 
is a good time to go over some fundamental stuff that you need to know for just 
about everything you’ll be doing on the Mac. Spend a few minutes reading this 

CHAPTER 1  macOS High Sierra 101 (Prerequisites: None)     17
section, and soon you’ll be clicking, double-clicking, pressing, and pointing all 
over the place. If you think you have the whole mousing thing pretty much figured 
out, feel free to skip this section. I’ll catch you on the other side.
Still with me? Good. Now for some basic terminology:
»
» Point: Before you can click or press anything, you have to point to it. Place 
your hand on your mouse, and move it so that the cursor arrow is over the 
object you want — such as on top of an icon or a button.
If you’re using a trackpad, slide your finger lightly across the pad until the 
cursor arrow is over the object you want.
»
» Click: Also called single click. Use your index finger to push the mouse button 
(or the left mouse button if your mouse has more than one) all the way down 
and then let go so that the button (usually) produces a satisfying clicking 
sound. (If you have one of the optical Apple Pro mice, you push the whole 
thing down to click.) Use a single click to highlight an icon, press a button, or 
activate a check box or window.
In other words, first you point and then you click — point and click, in com-
puter lingo.
If you’re using a trackpad, press down on it to click.
»
» Double-click: Click twice in rapid succession. With a little practice, you can 
perfect this technique in no time. Use a double-click to open a folder or to 
launch a file or application.
Trackpad users: Press down on the pad two times in rapid succession.
»
» Control-click: Hold down the Control key while single-clicking. (Also called 
secondary-click or right-click.)
Trackpad users can either hold down the Control key while pressing down on 
the pad with one finger, or tap the trackpad with two fingers without holding 
down the Control key.
If tapping your trackpad with two fingers didn’t bring up the little menu, check 
your Trackpad System Preferences pane (see Chapter 5).
Control-clicking — the same as right-clicking on a Windows system — displays 
a menu (called a contextual or shortcut menu). In fact, if you’re blessed with a 
two-or-more-button mouse (such as the Apple Magic Mouse), you can right-
click and avoid having to hold down the Control key. (You may have to enable 
this feature in the Mouse System Preferences pane.)
»
» Drag: Dragging something usually means you have to click it first and hold 
down the mouse or trackpad button. Then you move the mouse on your desk 

18     PART 1  macOS Basics
or mouse pad (or your finger on the trackpad) so that the cursor and what-
ever you select moves across the screen. The combination of holding down 
the button and dragging the mouse is usually referred to as clicking and 
dragging.
»
» Wiggle (or jiggle): This welcome improvement, introduced in El Capitan 
(and terrific if I do say so myself) is awesome when you lose track of the 
pointer on your screen. Just wiggle your mouse back and forth (or jiggle 
your finger back and forth on the trackpad) for a few seconds and the 
pointer will magically get much bigger, making it easier to see on the 
screen. And, of course, when you stop wiggling or jiggling, the pointer 
returns to its normal size.
»
» Choosing an item from a menu: To get to macOS menu commands, you 
must first open a menu and then choose the option you want. Point at the 
name of the menu you want with your cursor, press the mouse button, 
and then drag downward until you select the command you want. When 
the command is highlighted, finish selecting by letting go of the mouse 
button.
If you’re a longtime Mac user, you probably hold down the mouse button the 
whole time between clicking the name of the menu and selecting the command 
you want. You can still do it that way, but you can also click the menu name to 
open it, release the mouse button, point at the item you want to select, and then 
click again. In other words, macOS menus stay open after you click their names, 
even if you’re not holding down the mouse button. After you click a menu’s name 
to open it, you can even type the first letter (or letters) of the item to select it and 
then execute that item by pressing the spacebar or the Return key. Furthermore, 
menus remain open until you click something else.
Go ahead and give it a try . . . I’ll wait.
The terms given in the preceding list apply to all Mac laptop, desktop, and tower 
systems. If you use a MacBook, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, or Apple Magic Track-
pad, however, you’ll want to add to your lexicon a few more terms — such as tap, 
swipe, rotate, pinch, and spread. You can read all about them in Chapters 2 and 11.
Not Just a Beatles Movie:  
Help and the Help Menu
One of the best features of all Macs is the excellent built-in help, and macOS High 
Sierra doesn’t cheat you on that legacy: This system has online help in abundance. 

CHAPTER 1  macOS High Sierra 101 (Prerequisites: None)     19
When you have a question about how to do something, Help Center is the first 
place you should visit (after this book, of course).
Clicking the Help menu reveals the search field at the top of the menu and the Mac 
Help and New to Mac items. Choosing Mac Help opens the Mac Help window, as 
shown in Figure 1-5; choosing New to Mac launches Safari and displays a tour of 
macOS High Sierra.
Although the keyboard shortcut for Help no long appears on the Help menu, the 
same shortcut as always, Shift+⌘  +?, still opens Help.
You can browse Help by clicking a topic in the Table of Contents and then clicking 
a subtopic. If you don’t see the Table of Contents, click the Table of Contents but-
ton, labeled in Figure 1-5.
To search Mac Help, simply type a word or phrase in either search field — the 
one in the Help menu itself or the one near the top of the Help window on the 
right side — and then press Return. In a few seconds, your Mac provides one or 
more articles to read, which (theoretically) are related to your question. Usually. 
If you type menus and press Return, for example, you get the nine results shown 
in Figure 1-6.
As long as your Mac is connected to the Internet, search results include articles 
from the Apple online support database.
FIGURE 1-5: 
Mac Help is 
nothing if not 
helpful.

20     PART 1  macOS Basics
Although you don’t have to be connected to the Internet to use Mac Help, you do 
need an Internet connection to get the most out of it. (Chapter 12 can help you set 
up an Internet connection, if you don’t have one.) That’s because macOS installs 
only certain help articles on your hard drive. If you ask a question that those 
articles don’t answer, Mac Help connects to the Apple website and downloads the 
answer (assuming that you have an active Internet connection). These answers 
appear when you click Show All near the bottom of Figure 1-6. Click one of these 
entries, and Help Viewer retrieves the text over the Internet. This is sometimes 
inconvenient but also quite smart, because Apple can update the Help system at 
any time without requiring any action from you.
Furthermore, after you ask a question and Mac Help has grabbed the answer from 
the Apple website, the answer remains on your hard drive forever. If you ask for 
it again — even at a later date — your computer won’t have to download it from 
the Apple website again.
Click Search the Web for More Results (at the bottom of Figure 1-6) to launch 
Safari and perform a web search for the phrase you typed.
macOS also has a cool feature I like to call automatic visual help cues. Here’s how 
they work:
1.	 In the Help menu’s search field, type a word or phrase.
2.	 Select any item that has a menu icon to its left (such as the items with 
Trash in their names in Figure 1-7).
The automatic visual cue — an arrow — appears, pointing at that command in 
the appropriate menu.

Finally, don’t forget that most apps have their own Help systems, so if you want 
general help with your Mac, you need to first click the Finder icon in the dock, 
click the desktop, or use the app-switching shortcut ⌘  +Tab to activate Finder. 
Only then can you choose Mac Help from the Finder’s Help menu.

CHAPTER 2  Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My!)     23
Desktop and Windows 
and Menus (Oh My!)
T
his chapter introduces important features of macOS, starting with the first 
things you see when you log in: Finder and its desktop. After a quick look 
around the desktop, you get a look into two of its most useful features: 
windows and menus.
Windows are (and have always been) an integral part of Mac computing. Windows 
in Finder (or, as a PC user would say, “on the desktop”) show you the contents of 
the hard drive, optical drive, flash (thumb) drive, network drive, disk image, and 
folder icons. Windows in applications do many things. The point is that windows 
are part of what makes your Mac a Mac; knowing how they work — and how to 
use them — is essential.
Menus are another quintessential part of the Mac experience. The latter part of 
this chapter starts you out with a few menu basics. As needed, I direct you to other 
parts of the book for greater detail. So relax and don’t worry. By the end of this 
chapter, you’ll be ready to work with windows and menus in any application that 
uses them (and most applications, games excluded, do).

Touring Finder and Its Desktop
Finder is the program that creates the desktop, keeps track of your files and fold-
ers, and is always running. Just about everything you do on your Mac begins and 
ends with Finder. It’s where you manage files, store documents, launch programs, 
and much more. If you ever expect to master your Mac, the first step is to master 
Finder and desktop. (The default High Sierra Finder and desktop appear in the 
preceding chapter.)
Finder is the center of your macOS experience, so before I go any further, here’s a 
quick description of its most prominent features:
»
» Desktop: The desktop is the area behind the windows and the dock. In macOS 
10.13, the default desktop picture again honors its namesake, showing a 
portion of the High Sierra Nevada mountain range.
It’s also where your hard drive icon (ordinarily) lives, although if you bought 
a new Mac with High Sierra preinstalled, there won’t be any icons on the 
desktop.
If you don’t see your disk icon(s), and you’re old-school like me and prefer to 
always see disk icons on your desktop, never fear — you learn how to enable 
this behavior in Chapter 4.
The desktop isn’t a window, yet it acts like one. Like a folder window or a disk 
window, the desktop can contain icons. But unlike most windows, which 
require a bit of navigation to get to, the desktop is always there behind any 
open windows, making it a great place for icons you use a lot, such as oft-used 
folders, applications, or documents.
Some folks use the terms desktop and Finder interchangeably to refer to the 
total Mac environment you see after you log in — the icons, windows, menus, 
and all that other cool stuff. Just to make things confusing, the background 
you see on your screen — the picture behind your hard drive icon and your 
open windows — is also called the desktop. In this book, I refer to the applica-
tion you use when the desktop is showing as Finder. When I say desktop, I’m 
talking about the picture background behind your windows and the dock, 
which you can use as a storage place for icons if you like.
To make things even more confusing, the desktop is a full-screen representa-
tion of the icons in the Desktop folder inside your Home folder. Don’t panic. 
The desktop metaphor used by High Sierra will become crystal clear in 
upcoming pages and chapters.
»
» Dock: The dock is Finder’s main navigation shortcut tool. It makes getting to 
frequently used icons easy, even when you have a screen full of windows. Like 
the desktop, the dock is a great place for the folders, applications, and specific 

CHAPTER 2  Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My!)     25
documents you use most. Besides putting your frequently used icons at your 
fingertips, it’s extremely customizable; read more about it in Chapter 3.
»
» Icons: Icons are the little pictures you see in your windows and even on 
your desktop. Icons represent the things you work with on your Mac, such 
as applications (programs), documents, folders, utilities, and more.
»
» Windows: Opening most icons (by double-clicking them) makes a window 
appear. Windows in Finder show you the contents of hard drive and folder 
icons; windows in applications usually show the contents of documents. In 
the sections that follow, you can find the full scoop on High Sierra windows.
»
» Menus: Menus let you choose to do things, such as create new folders; 
duplicate files; and cut, copy, or paste text. I introduce menu basics later in 
this chapter in the “Menu Basics” section; you find details about working with 
menus for specific tasks throughout this book.
Whereas this chapter offers a basic introduction to Finder and desktop, Chapter 6 
explains in detail how to navigate and manage your files in Finder. But before 
you start using Finder, it helps to know the basics of working with windows and 
menus; if these Mac features are new to you, I suggest that you read this entire 
chapter now and pay special attention to Chapter 6 later.
Anatomy of a Window
Windows are a ubiquitous part of using a Mac. When you open a folder, you see  
a window. When you write a letter, the document that you’re working on appears 
in a window. When you browse the Internet, web pages appear in a window . . .  
and so on.
For the most part, windows are windows from program to program. You’ll proba-
bly notice that some programs (Adobe Photoshop or Microsoft Word, for example) 
take liberties with windows by adding features such as custom toolbars or textual 
information (such as zoom percentage or file size) around the edges of the docu-
ment window and in toolbars.
Don’t let it bug you; that extra fluff is just window dressing (pun intended). Main-
taining the window metaphor, many information windows display different kinds 
of information in different panes, or discrete sections within the window.
When you finish this chapter, which focuses exclusively on macOS Finder  
windows, you’ll know how to use most windows in most applications.

26     PART 1  macOS Basics
And so, without further ado, the following list gives you a look at the main fea-
tures of a typical Finder window (as shown in Figure 2-1). I discuss these features 
in greater detail in later sections of this chapter.
If your windows don’t look exactly like the one shown in Figure 2-1, don’t be con-
cerned. You can make your windows look and feel any way you like. As I explain 
later in the “Working with Windows” section, moving and resizing windows are 
easy tasks.
Meanwhile, here’s what you see on the toolbar (clockwise from top left):
»
» Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons: Shut ’em, shrink ’em, and grow ’em.
»
» View buttons: Choose among four exciting views of your window: Icon, List, 
Column, and Cover Flow. Find out more about views in Chapter 4.
»
» Arrange menu: Click this little doohickey to arrange this window’s icons by 
Name, Kind, Application, Date Modified, Date Created, Date Last Opened, 
Date Added, Size, or Tags. Or, of course, by None, which is the default.
»
» Action menu: This button is really a pop-up menu of commands you can 
apply to currently selected items in the Finder window or on the desktop. 
FIGURE 2-1:

window in 
macOS High 
Sierra.

CHAPTER 2  Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My!)     27
(These are generally the same commands you’d see in the Contextual menu if 
you right-clicked or Control-clicked the same items.)
»
» Window title: Shows the name of the window (hsbob in Figure 2-1).
⌘  -click (or Control-click) the window title to see a pop-up menu with the 
complete path to this folder (try it). This tip applies to most windows you’ll 
encounter, not just Finder windows. So ⌘  - or Control-click a window’s title (a 
right-click or two-fingered tap on a trackpad will work, too), and you’ll usually 
see the path to its enclosing folder on your disk.
You can also choose to have the path displayed at the bottom of every Finder 
window by choosing View ➪ Show Path Bar.
»
» Share menu: Another button that’s actually a menu. Click it to share selected 
files or folders via email, Messages, AirDrop, or Notes.
»
» Tags menu: Yet another button/menu; click it to assign a tag to the selected 
files or folders.
»
» Search field: Type a string of characters here, and macOS High Sierra digs 
into your system to find items that match by filename or document contents 
(yes, words within documents).
»
» Scroll bars: Use the scroll bars for moving around a window.
»
» Sidebar: Frequently used items live here.
»
» Forward and Back buttons: These buttons take you to the next or previous 
folder, respectively, displayed in this particular window.
If you’re familiar with web browsers, the Forward and Back buttons in Finder 
work the same way. The first time you open a window, neither button is 
active. But as you navigate from folder to folder, these buttons remember 
your breadcrumb trail so you can quickly traverse backward or forward, 
window by window. You can even navigate this way from the keyboard by 
using the shortcuts ⌘  +[ for Back and ⌘  +] for Forward.
The Forward and Back buttons remember only the other folders you’ve visited 
that appear in that open window. If you’ve set a Finder preference so that a 
folder always opens in a new window — or if you forced a folder to open in a 
new window, which I describe in a bit — the Forward and Back buttons won’t 
work. You have to use the modern, macOS-style window option, which uses a 
single window, or the buttons are useless.
Top o’ the window to ya!
Take a gander at the top of a window — any window. You see three buttons in the 
top-left corner and the name of the window in the top center. The three buttons 

28     PART 1  macOS Basics
(called gumdrop buttons by some folks because they look like, well, gumdrops) 
are officially known as Close, Minimize, and Zoom, and their colors (red, yellow, 
and green, respectively, unless you’ve switched to the Graphite appearance in the 
General System Preferences pane as described in Chapter 5) pop off the screen. 
Here’s what they do:
»
» Close (red): Click this button to close the window.
»
» Minimize (yellow): Click this button to minimize the window. Clicking 
Minimize appears to close the window, but instead of making it disappear, 
Minimize adds an icon for the window to the right side of the dock.
See the section about minimizing windows into application icons in Chapter 3 
if a document icon doesn’t appear in your dock when you minimize the 
document’s window.
To view the window again, click the dock icon for the window that you mini-
mized. If the window happens to be a QuickTime movie, the movie audio 
continues to play and a tiny still image from the video appears as its icon in 
the dock. (I discuss the dock in detail in Chapter 3.)
»
» Zoom (green): Click a window’s green Zoom button, and the window expands 
to cover the whole screen, including the menu bar.
If you prefer the old behavior, where a window zoomed to the largest size it 
could but didn’t cover the full screen, hold down the Option key when you 
click the green button.
To shrink the window back to its previous dimensions, slide the cursor up to 
the very top of the screen, wait for the menu bar to appear, and then click the 
green Zoom button.
Another way to escape from a full-screen window, at least in Finder, is to press 
the Esc key on your keyboard. Sadly, this trick doesn’t work with all apps, 
though it’s quite useful in apps that support it (most Apple apps and many 
others) as well as in Finder.
If you prefer the old behavior, where a window zoomed to a larger size but 
didn’t cover the full screen, hold down the Option key when you click the 
green button.
El Capitan (OS X 10.11) introduced a feature called Split View to the green 
gumdrop button. To see Split View in action, press the green button for a 
moment (that is, perform the first half of a click but don’t release the button 
yet). Half the screen turns light blue. Without releasing the mouse button, drag 
to the left or right; the blue tint moves to the left or right side of the screen. 
Release the mouse button and the window fills the blue half of the screen. The 
other half of the screen displays miniature versions of all open windows. 

CHAPTER 2  Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My!)     29
Hover the cursor over a miniature window to see its name; click a miniature 
window and it fills that half of the screen.
To work in Split View, click either window to activate it and do what you have 
to do. To activate the other window, click it. To exit Split View, do one of the 
following:
•	 Press Esc.
•	 Move the pointer to the top of the screen; when the buttons (for both 
windows) reappear, click any button.
•	 Quit either application.
My colleague at The Mac Observer, John Martellaro, called Split View silly, but 
I’m not so sure. I use it for certain tasks (assuming I remember that it’s hiding 
under the green gumdrop button).
A scroll new world
Yet another way to see more of what’s in a window or pane is to scroll through 
it. Scroll bars appear at the bottom and right sides of any window or pane that 
contains more stuff  — icons, text, pixels, or whatever  — than you can see in 
the window. Figure 2-2, for example, shows two instances of the same window: 
Dragging the scroll bar on the right side of the smaller window would reveal the 
icons above and below the six that are currently visible. Dragging the scroll bar on 
the bottom of the smaller window would reveal items to the left and right of the 
six that are currently visible.
FIGURE 2-2: 
The same 
window twice; 
in the front 
window, you 
use the scroll 
bars to see the 
hidden icons 
that are visible 
in the back 
window.

30     PART 1  macOS Basics
Simply click and drag a scroll bar to move it up or down or side to side.
If your scroll bars don’t look exactly like the ones in Figure  2-2 or work as 
described in the following list, don’t worry. These are System Preferences you can 
configure to your heart’s desire, as you discover in Chapter 5.
Here are some ways you can scroll in a window:
»
» Click a scroll bar and drag. The content of the window scrolls proportionally 
to how far you drag the scroll bar.
»
» Click in the scroll bar area but don’t click the scroll bar itself. The 
window scrolls either one page up (if you click above the scroll bar) or down 
(if you click below the scroll bar). You can change a setting in your General 
System Preferences pane to cause the window to scroll proportionally to 
where you click.
For what it’s worth, the Page Up and Page Down keys on your keyboard 
function the same way as clicking the white scroll area (the vertical scroll 
bar only) in Finder and many applications. These keys don’t work in every 
program, though, so don’t become too dependent on them. Also, if you 
purchased a mouse, a trackball, or another pointing device that has a scroll 
wheel, you can scroll vertically in the active (front) window with the scroll 
wheel or press and hold down the Shift key to scroll horizontally. Alas, this 
horizontal scrolling-with-the-Shift-key works in Finder windows but not in all 
applications. For example, it works in the Apple TextEdit application, but not 
in Microsoft Word.
»
» Use the keyboard. In Finder, first click an icon in the window and then use 
the arrow keys to move up, down, left, or right. Using an arrow key selects the 
next icon in the direction it indicates — and automatically scrolls the window, 
if necessary. In other programs, you might or might not be able to use the 
keyboard to scroll. The best advice I can give you is to try it — either it will 
work or it won’t.
»
» Use a two-finger swipe (on a trackpad). If you have a notebook with a 
trackpad or use a Magic Trackpad or Magic Mouse, just move the arrow 
cursor over the window and then swipe the trackpad with two fingers to 
scroll.
(Hyper)active windows
To work within a window, the window must be active. The active window is always 
the frontmost window, and inactive windows always appear behind the active 
window. Only one window can be active at a time. To make a window active, click 

CHAPTER 2  Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My!)     31
it anywhere — in the middle, on the title bar, or on a scroll bar. It doesn’t matter 
where; just click anywhere to activate it.
The exceptions are the Close, Minimize, and Zoom buttons on inactive windows, 
which always do what they do, regardless of whether a window is active or inactive.
Look at Figure 2-3 for an example of an active window in front of an inactive  
window (the Applications window and the Utilities window, respectively).
The following is a list of the major visual cues that distinguish active from inac-
tive windows:
»
» The active window’s title bar: By default, the Close, Minimize, and Zoom 
buttons are bright red, yellow, and green, respectively. If you chose the Graphite 
Appearance in the General System Preferences pane, they’ll be dark gray; the 
inactive windows’ buttons are light gray regardless of Appearance settings.
This is a nice visual cue. Colored items are active, and gray ones are inactive. 
Better still, if you move your mouse cursor over an inactive window’s gum-
drop buttons, they light up in their usual colors so you can close, minimize, or 
zoom an inactive window without first clicking it to making it active. Neat!
»
» The active window’s toolbar: Toolbar buttons are darker and more distinc-
tive; the inactive window’s toolbar buttons are light gray and more subdued.
»
» The active window’s drop shadow: Notice how the active window has a 
more prominent shadow? This tricks your eye into thinking the active window 
is in front of the inactive one.
FIGURE 2-3:

window 
in front of 
an inactive 
window.

32     PART 1  macOS Basics
One last thing: If you’re wondering how to resize a window, just hover the cursor 
over a window’s edge or corner or over the dividing line between two panes in the 
same window (such as the sidebar and the main area of Finder windows). A help-
ful little arrow appears as a visual cue that you can now drag the edge, corner, or 
dividing line to resize the window or pane.
Dialog Dealie-Boppers
Dialogs are special windows that pop up over the active window. You generally see 
them when you select a menu item that ends in an ellipsis ( . . . ).
Dialogs can contain a number of standard Mac features (I call them dealie- 
boppers), such as radio buttons, pop-up menus, tabs, text-entry fields, and check 
boxes. You see these features again and again in dialogs. Take a moment to look at 
each of these dealie-boppers in Figure 2-4.
»
» Radio buttons: Radio buttons are so named because, like the buttons on your 
car radio (if you have a very old car), only one at a time can be active. (When 
they’re active, they appear to be pushed in, just like the old radio buttons.) 
Radio buttons always appear in a group of two or more; when you select one, 
all the others are automatically deselected.
Here’s a nifty and undocumented shortcut: You can usually select check boxes 
and radio buttons by clicking their names (instead of the buttons or boxes).
»
» Tabs: When a dialog contains more information than can fit in a single window, 
the info may be divided among panes denoted by tabs. In Figure 2-4, the New 
Document tab is selected on the left, and the Open and Save tab is selected on 
the right.
»
» Pop-up menus: These menus are appropriately named because they pop up 
when you click them. In Figure 2-4, the Styling menu has been clicked and is 
popped up; the other pop-up menus — Opening Files, Saving Files, Document 
Type, and Encoding (mostly obscured by the popped-up Styling menu) — are 
unclicked and unpopped.
You can always recognize a pop-up menu because it appears in a slightly 
rounded rectangle and has a double-ended arrow symbol (or a pair of 
triangles, if you like) on the right.
Have you figured out yet what radio buttons, tabs, and pop-up menus have in 
common? Hint: All three enable you to make a single selection from a group of 
options. (Well, okay, that was more of an answer than a hint.)

CHAPTER 2  Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My!)     33
»
» Text-entry fields: In text-entry fields, you type text (including numbers) from 
the keyboard. In Figure 2-4, the Width, Height, Author, Organization, and 
Copyright options are text-entry fields.
»
» Check boxes: The last dealie-bopper that you see frequently is the check box. 
In a group of check boxes, you can select as many options as you like. Check 
boxes are selected when they contain a check mark, and they’re deselected 
when they’re empty, as shown in Figure 2-4.
I couldn’t find a dialog or window that included all the aforementioned dealie-
boppers as well as the one other dealie-bopper you should become familiar with, 
the disclosure triangle. If you see a triangle in a dialog or sheet, try clicking it. If 
it’s a disclosure triangle, it will reveal additional options (or its contents if it’s a 
folder in Finder’s List view, as you see in Chapter 6).
Some applications have tri-state check boxes (and no, I’m not talking geography 
here). These special check boxes are empty when nothing in the group is selected, 
sport an X when everything in the group is selected, and sport a minus sign (–) 
when some items in the group are selected and some are not.
FIGURE 2-4: 
This window 
offers most of 
the dealie-
boppers you’re 
ever likely to 
encounter.

34     PART 1  macOS Basics
Working with Windows
In the following sections, I give you a closer look at windows themselves: how 
you move them, size them, and use them. And although High Sierra windows are 
similar to windows you’ve used in other versions of macOS (and even, dare I say 
it, Windows), you may just discover a new wrinkle or two.
If you’re relatively new to the Mac, you may want to read this section while sitting 
at your computer, trying the techniques as you read them. Most people find it eas-
ier to remember something they’ve read if they actually do it. If you’ve been using 
your Mac for a while, you’ve probably figured out how windows work by now.
Opening and closing windows
To start peering into windows on your Mac, first you need to know how to open 
and close them. When you’re working in Finder, you can choose the following 
commands from the File menu. Note that you’ll probably find similar commands 
on the File menu of programs other than Finder.
You’ll use many of these commands frequently, so it would behoove you to mem-
orize the keyboard shortcuts. If you’re not sure how keyboard shortcuts work, 
check out “Using keyboard shortcut commands,” later in this chapter.
»
» New Finder Window (⌘  +N): Opens a new Finder window. In other pro-
grams, ⌘  +N might open a new document, project, or whatever that program 
helps you create.
»
» Open (⌘  +O): Opens the selected item, be it an icon, a window, or a folder.
»
» Close Window (⌘ +W): Closes the active window. If no windows are open or if 
no window is selected, the Close Window command appears grayed and can’t 
be chosen. Or if you prefer, you can close a window by clicking the red Close 
button in the top-left corner.
If you hold down the Option key with the File menu open, the Close Window 
command changes to Close All. This useful command enables you to close all 
open Finder windows. But it shows up only when you press the Option key or 
use its keyboard shortcut (⌘  +Option+W); otherwise, it remains hidden.
Note that several other commands in the File menu transmogrify when you 
press the Option key. It would be off topic to get into them here, but here’s a 
tip: Press the Option key, and browse all Finder menus. At least a dozen useful 
commands appear only when the Option key is pressed. Press it early and 
often for hidden (often time-saving) commands.

CHAPTER 2  Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My!)     35
Resizing windows and window panes
If you want to see more (or less) of what’s in a window, just hover the pointer over 
any edge or corner and drag. When the cursor turns into a little double-headed 
arrow, as shown in Figure 2-5, click and drag to resize the window.
Note that I’ve put arrow cursors on all sides and corners of the window in Figure 2-5. 
That’s for illustration purposes; in real life you’ll only see one at a time.
Display windows, like those in Finder, frequently consist of multiple panes. If you 
look at Figure 2-5, the line divides the sidebar to the left of it and the contents of 
the window to the right. When your mouse pointer hovers over the resizing area of 
this bar, the cursor changes to a vertical bar (or it could be horizontal if the panes 
are one above the other) with little arrows pointing out of both sides, as shown in 
the margin.
When you see this cursor, you can click and drag anywhere in the dividing line 
that separates the sidebar from the rest of the window. Doing so resizes the two 
panes relative to each other; one gets larger and one gets smaller.
Moving windows
To move a window, click anywhere in a window’s gray title bar or toolbar (except 
on a button, menu, or search field) and drag the window to wherever you want 
it. The window moves wherever you move the mouse, stopping dead in its tracks 
when you release the mouse button.
If you can’t find the cursor on the screen, wiggle your finger on the trackpad or 
jiggle the mouse. In High Sierra, these movements magnify the pointer to make it 
easier to find onscreen.

pointer over

edge; when

headed arrow

Shuffling windows
I’ve already spent plenty of pages giving you the scoop on how to work with  
windows. But wait. There’s more! The commands on the Window menu provide 
tools you can use to manage your windows.
Here is a brief look at each of the items on the Window menu. (And if you’re unfa-
miliar with menus and keyboard shortcuts, you find out how they work later in 
this chapter.)
»
» Minimize (⌘  +M): Use this command to minimize the active Finder window 
to the dock and unclutter your desktop. It’s the same as clicking the yellow 
gumdrop button.
»
» Zoom: This command does the same thing as the green gumdrop button. If 
you’ve forgotten what the green gumdrop does already, just turn back a few 
pages to the “Top o’ the window to ya!” section and read it again.
»
» Cycle through Windows (⌘  +`): Each time you choose this command or use 
the keyboard shortcut for it, a different window becomes active. So if you 
have three windows — call ’em Window 1, Window 2, and Window 3 — and 
you’re using Window 1, this command deactivates Window 1 and activates 
Window 2. If you choose it again, the command deactivates Window 2 and 
activates Window 3. Choose it one more time, and it deactivates Window 3 
and reactivates Window 1.
The next four commands in the Window menu help you manage High Sierra 
Finder window tabs (which were introduced in OS X 10.9 Mavericks). If you’re a 
fan of tabbed browsing (à la Safari), you’ll love tabs in a Finder window.
Tabs let you view multiple folders or disks or both in a single window, with each 
folder or disk in its own tab, as shown in Figure 2-6.
Tabbed windows are an ingenious way to cram a lot of information into a little 
space. I’ve tried a number of third-party utilities that purported to provide tabbed 
Finder windows, but I’ve never found one that’s reliable and robust enough to 
continue using. This one, on the other hand, just works.
High Sierra, like its predecessor, includes system-wide tabbed windows, which 
should work in almost every application that uses windows. The cool part is the 
app doesn’t have to be updated in any way — High Sierra grafts tabbed windows 
onto almost every app that displays multiple windows, as shown in Figure 2-7.

The remaining commands in the Window menu are as follows:
»
» Show Previous Tab (Control+Shift+Tab): Each time you choose this com-
mand or use its keyboard shortcut, the previous tab — the one to its left, 
unless it’s the leftmost tab — becomes active. For example, in Figure 2-6, 
Documents is the active tab. Use this command, and Applications becomes 
the active tab. Use it a third time, and Downloads becomes active. Because 
Downloads is the leftmost tab, if you use this command yet again, it wraps 
around and Documents becomes the active tab again.
»
» Show Next Tab (Control+Tab): Same as Show Previous Tab except in 
reverse. Instead of showing the previous tab (the one to the left), this com-
mand shows the next tab (the one to the right). Use this command three 
times in a row (refer to the order shown in Figure 2-6), and you see the 
Downloads tab, then the Applications tab, and finally the Documents 
tab again.
»
» Move Tab to New Window (no keyboard shortcut): Does just what it says; 
it moves the active tab into a new window of its own.
»
» Merge All Windows (no keyboard shortcut): Combines all open windows 
and tabs in one window.
You can click a tab and drag it left or right to change the order. You can also 
drag and drop a tab from one Finder window to another. The trick is to click 
directly on a tab and drag it onto the tabs in the target window. If you release it 
anywhere else, the tab will be displayed in a new window.
One more thing: In High Sierra, all these commands and keyboard shortcuts 
appear in most apps that display windows.
»
» Bring All to Front (no keyboard shortcut): Windows from different applica-
tions can interleave. For example, you can have (from front to back) a Finder 
window, a Microsoft Word window, an Adobe Photoshop window, another 
Microsoft Word window, and another Finder window. In this example, choosing 
Bring All to Front while Finder is the active application enables you to have both 
Finder windows move in front of those belonging to Word and Photoshop.
If you want to bring all the windows belonging to Finder (or any other 
program, for that matter) to the front at the same time, you can also click the 
appropriate dock icon (Finder, in this case).
If you hold down the Option key when you click the Window menu, Minimize 
Window changes to Minimize All, and the Zoom command changes to Zoom All.
»
» Other items: The remaining items on the Window menu — if any — are the 
names of all currently open Finder windows. Click a window’s name to bring it 
to the front.

CHAPTER 2  Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My!)     39
Menu Basics
Mac menus are often referred to as pull-down menus. To check out the macOS 
menus, click the Finder button on the dock to activate Finder and then look at 
the top of your screen. From left to right, you see the Apple menu ( ), the Finder 
menu, and six other menus. To use an macOS menu, click its name to make the 
menu appear and then pull (drag) down to select a menu item. Piece of cake!
Note that menus stay down after you click their names, and stay open until you 
either select an item or click outside the menu’s boundaries.
The ever-changing menu bar
Before you start working with macOS menus, you really, really should know this: 
Menu items can change unexpectedly. Why? Well, the menus you see on the menu 
bar at the top of the screen always reflect the program that’s active at the time. 
When you switch from Finder to a particular program — or from one program 
to another — the menus change immediately to match whatever program you 
switched to.
Figure 2-8 shows the menu bars for Finder, Preview, and TextEdit applications.
An easy way to tell which program is active is to look at the application menu — 
it’s the leftmost menu with a name, just to the right of the  menu. When you’re in 
Finder, of course, the application menu reads Finder. But if you switch to another 
program (by clicking its icon on the dock or by clicking any window associated 
with the program) or launch a new program, that menu changes to the name of 
the active program.
When you have an application open, the commands on the menu change, too — 
but just a little bit. What makes this cool is that you have access to some stan-
dard application menu items whether you’re running Mail or Safari. For example, 
most (but not all) applications have Cut, Copy, and Paste commands in their Edit 
menus, and Open, Save, and Print commands in their File menus. You can find 
much more about commands for applications in Part 3, which explains how appli-
cations that come with macOS High Sierra can help you get things done.
FIGURE 2-8: 
Menu bars

reflect the active 
application.

40     PART 1  macOS Basics
Contextual menus: They’re  
sooo contextual!
Contextual menus (also called shortcut menus) list commands that apply only to the 
item that is currently selected. Contextual menus might be available in windows, 
on icons, and in most places on the desktop.
To see whether a contextual menu is available, either hold down the Control key 
and click — which you can call a Control-click to sound cool to your Mac friends — 
or, for those with two or more buttons on their mice, right-click. Finally, most Mac 
laptops (as well as the Magic Trackpad and the Magic Mouse) let you click the 
trackpad using two fingers to simulate a right-click or a Control-click.
If this doesn’t work for you, launch System Preferences and click the Trackpad 
icon. Click the Point & Click tab and make sure that Click with Two Fingers is 
selected and also that the Secondary Click check box is enabled.
Another reason the contextual menu might not appear is that it is available 
only if any of its commands make sense for the item that you Control-click or  
right-click. That’s why people call ’em contextual! They’re specific to the current 
context, which is whatever is selected or Control-clicked.
Figure 2-9, left, shows the contextual menu that appears when you Control-click 
(or right-click) a document icon. Figure 2-9, right, shows the contextual menu 
you see when you Control-click the desktop.
Contextual menus are also available in most applications. Open your favorite app 
and try Control-clicking to find out whether those menus are there. In most cases, 
using a contextual menu is a quick way to avoid going to the menu bar to choose a 
command. In some programs — such as iMovie and iTunes — contextual menus 
are the only way to access some commands.
FIGURE 2-9: 
Only relevant 
items appear 
in a contextual 
menu.

CHAPTER 2  Desktop and Windows and Menus (Oh My!)     41
To make the Finder-related contextual menus available to users who didn’t have 
the foresight to purchase this book, Apple added the Actions button (shown in the 
margin) to the toolbar. As a result, people who don’t know about Control-clicking 
or right-clicking (or have only one free hand) can access most contextual menu 
commands by clicking the Actions button and displaying its context-sensitive 
menu of shortcuts. You, on the other hand, gentle reader, know how to get at 
these commands without having to run your mouse all the way up to the Actions 
button in the toolbar. Plus, a handful of commands appear in the Control-click/
right-click contextual menu but don’t appear in the Actions button/menu.
Get in the habit of Control-clicking (or right-clicking or two-finger clicking) 
items on your screen. Before you know it, using contextual menus will become 
second nature to you.
Recognizing disabled options
Menu items that appear in black on a menu are currently available. Menu items 
that aren’t currently available are grayed out, to indicate that they’re disabled for 
the time being. You can’t select a disabled menu item.
In Figure 2-10, the File menu on the left is pulled down while nothing is selected 
in Finder; this is why many of the menu items are disabled (in gray). These items 
are disabled because an item (such as a window or an icon) must be selected for 
you to use one of these menu items. For example, the Show Original command is 
grayed out because it works only if the selected item is an alias. On the right side 
of Figure 2-10, I selected a document before I pulled down the menu; note that 
many of the formerly disabled commands are enabled when an icon is selected. 
(The Show Original command is still grayed out because the selected icon is not 
an alias.)
FIGURE 2-10:

with nothing 
selected (left) 
and with a 
document icon 
selected (right);

items are

42     PART 1  macOS Basics
Finally, note that items that end in an ellipsis ( . . . ), such as the Tags command 
in Figure 2-10, will open a dialog with additional options.
Navigating submenus
Some menu items have more menus attached to them, and these are called sub-
menus, which are menus that are subordinate to a menu item. If a menu has a 
black triangle to the right of its name, it has a submenu.
To use a submenu, click a menu name once (to drop the menu down) and then 
slide your cursor down to any item with a black triangle. When the item is high-
lighted, move your mouse to the right just slightly. The submenu should pop out 
of the original menu’s item, as shown in Figure 2-11.
Under the Apple menu tree
On the far-left side of the menu bar sits a little 
, which displays a menu when 
clicked. No matter what application is active, the  menu is always available in the 
top-left corner of your menu bar.
The menu bar is always available, even with apps that hide it in full-screen mode. 
To make it reappear, move the pointer to the top of the screen, wait a second or 
two, and watch the menu bar magically reappear.
From top to bottom, the 
 menu gives you a number of options, including the 
following:
FIGURE 2-11:

menu’s

» About This Mac: Choose this item to see what version of macOS you’re 
running, what kind of Mac and processor you’re using, how much memory 
your Mac has, the name of your startup disk, and much more. The window 
sports multiple tabs across the top of the window — Overview, Displays, 
Storage, and so on.
Click System Report on the Overview tab to launch the Apple System Information 
utility; there, you can find out more than you’ll probably ever want or need to 
know about your Mac’s hardware and software.
Click Software Update on the Overview tab to have your Mac check with the 
mothership (Apple) to see whether any updates are available for macOS, its 
included applications, third-party applications purchased at the Mac App 
Store, other Apple-branded applications (such as GarageBand, Final Cut Pro, 
Pages), or even Apple-branded peripheral devices, such as the iPod or iPhone.
»
» System Preferences: Choose this item to open the System Preferences 
window (which I discuss further in Chapter 5 and elsewhere).
»
» App Store: Choose this item to launch the Mac App Store.
»
» Recent Items: This option lets you quickly access applications, documents, 
and servers you’ve used recently, as shown previously in Figure 2-11.
»
» Force Quit: Use this option only in emergencies. What’s an emergency? Use it 
when an application becomes recalcitrant or otherwise misbehaves or refuses 
to quit when you say Quit.
Memorize the keyboard shortcut for Force Quit (⌘  +Option+Esc). Sometimes 
a program gets so badly hosed that you can’t click anywhere and other 
keyboard shortcuts won’t do anything at all. It doesn’t happen often, nor does 
it happen to everyone. If it should happen to you, calmly press the magic key 
combo you memorized (⌘  +Option+Esc), and the Force Quit Applications 
dialog (usually) appears. Click the name of the program that’s acting up and 
then click the Force Quit button or press the Return key to make the balky 
application stop balking.
The reason Force Quit should be used only in an emergency is that if you use 
it on an application that’s working fine and have any unsaved documents, your 
work since the last time you saved the file will be blown away.
Or not. The Auto Save and Versions features, which first appeared in Lion, are 
still the default for Apple’s own applications. You read more about these 
features in Chapter 6; if the app you’re using supports Auto Save features, you 
shouldn’t lose any (or at least not much) of your work regardless of when you 
last saved.

44     PART 1  macOS Basics

» Shut Down options: These four commands do exactly what their names 
imply:
•	 Sleep: Puts your Mac into an energy-efficient state of suspended animation. 
See the section about Energy Saver in Chapter 20 for details on the Energy 
Saver System Preferences pane and sleeping.
•	 Restart: Quits all open programs and restarts your Mac. It’s quite polite 
about this task, asking if you want to save any unsaved changes in open 
documents before complying.
•	 Shut Down: Turns off your Mac. Refer to Chapter 1 for details.
•	 Log Out: Quits all open programs and logs you out. Again, your Mac will 
be ever so polite, asking if you want to save unsaved changes in open 
documents before complying. When it’s done, the login screen appears.
Using keyboard shortcut commands
Most menu items, or at least the most common ones, have keyboard shortcuts to 
help you quickly navigate your Mac without having to haggle so much with the 
mouse. Using these key combinations activates menu items without using the 
mouse; to use them, you press the Command (⌘  ) key and then press another key 
(or keys) without releasing the ⌘   key. Memorize the shortcuts that you use often.
Learn how to change keyboard shortcuts and even how to create ones of your own 
in Chapter 5.
Some people refer to the Command key as the Apple key. That’s because on many 
keyboards that key has both the pretzel-like Command key symbol (⌘  ) and an 
Apple logo ( ) on it. To avoid confusion, I always refer to ⌘   as the Command key.

CHAPTER 3  What’s Up, Dock?     45
What’s Up, Dock?
T
 
he dock appears at the bottom of your screen by default, providing quick 
access to your most often-used applications, documents, and folders.
Many users prefer to have the dock located on the left or right side of the screen 
instead of at the bottom. You see how to relocate your dock (and more) in the 
coming pages.
Folder icons on the dock are stacks, and they display a fan, grid, or list of their 
contents when clicked. Other icons on the dock open an application or document 
with one click.
The dock is your friend. It’s a great place to put files, folders, and apps you use a 
lot so that they’re always just a click away.
A dock icon is merely a pointer (also known as an alias or a shortcut) to applica-
tions, documents, and folders stored on your hard drive. So, you can add and 
remove icons from your dock (as you discover shortly) without affecting the actual 
applications, documents, and folders. So don’t be shy about adding or removing 
items from your dock to make it more useful.

46     PART 1  macOS Basics
A Quick Introduction to Your Dock
Take a minute to look at the row of icons at the bottom of your display. That row, 
gentle reader, is the dock (shown in Figure 3-1), and those individual pictures are 
known as icons (which I discuss in greater detail momentarily).
Icons in the dock and Launchpad (see Chapter 8) are odd ducks; you activate them 
with a single click. Most other Finder icons are selected (highlighted) when you 
single-click and opened only when you double-click them. So dock icons (and 
their Launchpad brethren) are kind of like links on a web page; you need only a 
single click to open them.
Here’s the rundown on what happens when you click dock icons:
»
» If it’s an application icon, the application opens and becomes active. If the 
application is already open, it becomes active, which brings it and all its 
windows to the front.
»
» If it’s a document icon, that document opens in its appropriate application, 
which becomes the active application. If that application is already open, it 
becomes the active application with this document in the front.
»
» If it’s a folder icon or disk icon, a stack, fan, or grid with its contents appears 
so you can choose an item. If you choose Show in Finder from this menu, the 
folder’s window opens in Finder.
If the item is open already when you click its dock icon, it becomes active.
The default icons of the dock
By default, the dock contains a number of commonly used macOS applications, 
and you can also store your own applications, files, or folders there. (I show you 
how to do that in the “Adding dock icons” section, later in this chapter.)
But first, look at the items you find in a standard macOS High Sierra dock. If they 
aren’t familiar to you, they certainly will be as you get to know High Sierra.
FIGURE 3-1: 
The dock and 
all its default 
icons.

CHAPTER 3  What’s Up, Dock?     47
I admit that I can’t do justice to all the programs that come with macOS High 
Sierra that aren’t, strictly speaking, part of the operating system (OS). Alas, some 
of the programs in the default dock are ones you won’t be seeing much more 
of. But I’d hate to leave you wondering what all those icons in the dock are, so 
Table 3-1 gives you a brief description of each default dock icon (moving from 
left to right onscreen). If additional coverage of an item appears elsewhere in the 
book, the table tells you where.

To get a quick look at the name of a dock icon, just move (hover) your pointer over 
any item in the dock. Like magic, that item’s name appears above it (like Safari on 
the left side of Figure 3-4 later in this chapter).
It’s likely that your dock won’t look exactly like the one shown in Figure 3-1. If you 
added icons to your dock before you upgraded to High Sierra, for example, you’ll 
see those icons. If you have Apple apps such as iMovie, GarageBand, Pages, Num-
bers, or Keynote installed, or you get a new Mac with High Sierra preinstalled,

you may see their icons in your dock. And if you’ve ever deleted one of the default 
icons shown in Figure 3-1 from your dock, it won’t come back when you install 
High Sierra.
If you don’t understand what I just said or want to make your dock look exactly 
like the one shown in Figure 3-1, I have good news: You find out how to do that 
and much more before the end of this chapter.
Also, if you see a question mark instead of an icon in the dock, the file (applica-
tion, document, or folder) it represents has been deleted.
Trash talkin’
The Trash is a special container where you put the icons you no longer want to 
hang around on your hard drive(s). Got four copies of a document named Letter to 
the Editor re: Bird Waste Issue on your hard drive? Drag three of them to the Trash. 
Tired of tripping over old PDF and DMG files you’ve downloaded but no longer 
need? Drag them to the Trash, too.
To put something in the Trash, just drag its icon onto the Trash icon in the dock 
and it will move into the Trash. As with other icons, when the Trash icon is high-
lighted you know that you’ve connected with the Trash while dragging. And as 
with other dock icons, the Trash icon’s name appears when you move the cursor 
over the icon.
Two other ways to put items into the Trash are to select the items you want to 
dispose of and then choose File ➪ Move to Trash or press ⌘  +Delete (⌘  +Backspace 
on some keyboards).
If you accidentally move something to the Trash and want it back right now, you 
can magically put it back where it came from — but only if the next thing you do 
is choose Edit ➪ Undo or press ⌘  +Z.
In High Sierra (as in Sierra, El Capitan, and Yosemite), Finder usually remembers 
more than one action for Undo and can often undo the last few things you did in 
Finder. That’s the good news. The bad news is that it redoes things in reverse 
order, so don’t wait too long. If you perform several other file-related activities in 
Finder, you’ll have to Undo all those actions before you can Undo your accidental 
Move to Trash.
In other words, as soon as you create or rename a folder, move a file from one 
place to another, drag a different file to the Trash, create an alias, or almost any-
thing that affects a file or folder, choosing Edit ➪ Undo or pressing ⌘  +Z will undo 
that action first.

50     PART 1  macOS Basics
You’ll find that some Finder actions — most of the items in the View menu, for 
example — don’t affect Undo. So if you drag a file to the Trash and then switch 
views (see Chapter 4), Undo will still un-trash the file.
Even if you do something and can’t use Undo, files you drag to the Trash aren’t 
deleted immediately. You know how the garbage in the can on the street curb sits 
there until the sanitation engineers come by and pick it up each Thursday? High 
Sierra’s Trash works the same way, but without the smell. Items sit in the Trash, 
waiting for a sanitation engineer (you) to come along and empty it.
So, if you miss the window of opportunity to use the Undo command, don’t worry; 
you can still retrieve the file from the Trash:
»
» To open the Trash and see what’s in there, just click its icon on the dock.  
A Finder window called Trash opens, showing you the files it contains (namely, 
files and folders put in the Trash since the last time it was emptied).
»
» To retrieve an item that’s already in the Trash, drag it back out, either onto 
the desktop or back into the folder where it belongs.
Or use the secret keyboard shortcut: Select the item(s) in the Trash that you 
want to retrieve and press ⌘  +Delete. This technique has the added benefit 
of magically transporting the files or folders you select from the Trash back 
into the folder from which they came. And, unlike Undo, the secret keyboard 
shortcut will work on a file or folder at any time, or at least until the next time 
you empty the Trash. Try it — it’s sweet.
And if that doesn’t work, you can right-click or Control-click a file and choose 
Put Back from the contextual menu.
»
» To empty the Trash, choose Finder ➪ Empty Trash or press Shift+⌘  +Delete. 
If the Trash window is open and files are in the Trash, you see an Empty 
button just below its toolbar on the right. Clicking the button, of course, also 
empties the Trash.
You can also empty the Trash from the dock by positioning the pointer on the 
Trash icon and right-clicking (or Control-clicking) the Trash icon. The Empty 
Trash menu item pops up like magic. Move the pointer over Empty Trash to select 
it and then release the mouse button.
Think twice before you invoke the Empty Trash command. After you empty the 
Trash, the files that it contained are pretty much gone forever, or at least gone 
from your hard drive. There is no Undo for Empty Trash. So my advice is: Before 
you get too bold, read Chapter 21, and back up your hard drive at least once (sev-
eral times is better). After you get proficient at backups, chances improve greatly 
that even though the files are technically gone forever from your hard drive, you 
can get them back if you really want to (from your backups).

CHAPTER 3  What’s Up, Dock?     51
The Trash icon shows you when it has files waiting for you there; as in real life, 
Trash that contains files or folders looks like it’s full of crumpled paper (see 
upcoming Figure  3-2). Conversely, when your Trash is empty, the Trash icon 
looks, well, empty (refer to Figure 3-1).
Finally, although you can’t open a file that’s in the Trash, you can select it and 
use Quick Look (shortcut: ⌘  +Y) to see its contents before you decide to use Empty 
Trash and permanently delete it.
And that’s pretty much all there is to know about the Trash.
Opening application menus on the dock
Single-clicking an application icon on the dock launches that application — or, if 
the application is already open, switches you to that application and brings for-
ward all open windows in that application.
But application icons on the dock — such as Calendar, Safari, and iTunes — also 
hide menus containing some handy commands. (Folder icons in the dock have a 
different but no less handy menu, which I discuss in a moment.)
You can make menus for applications on the dock appear in two ways:
»
» Press and continue to hold down the mouse button.
»
» Right-click or Control-click.
If you use a trackpad or a Magic Mouse, a two-finger tap should do the trick.
Do any of the preceding and you’ll 
see the Options menu for the icon you 
clicked, as shown in Figure 3-2.
From the top (in Figure 3-2):
»
» Remove from Dock: Removes 
that application’s icon from the 
dock (waiting until after you quit 
the application if it’s running). If an 
application is running and its icon 
isn’t already in the dock, you’ll see 
Add to Dock rather than Remove 
from Dock.
FIGURE 3-2: 
The Options menu for an application icon  
(Mac App Store) on the dock.

52     PART 1  macOS Basics
»
» Open at Login: Launches this application automatically every time you log in 
to this user account. This is handy for apps you want to keep running all the 
time, such as Mail or Safari.
»
» Show in Finder: Opens the enclosing folder (in this instance, that would be 
the Applications folder) and selects the application’s icon.
And finally, choosing Open launches the application.
So there you have it: That’s the default Options menu for applications, which is 
what you’ll see for most applications when they aren’t open.
One last thing: When you right-click/Control-click the dock icon for an appli-
cation that’s currently running (look for the little dot below its icon), you may 
see different menus, like the ones shown in Figure 3-3 (clockwise from top left: 
Safari, Preview, System Preferences, TextEdit, and iTunes).
As you can see, some open applications provide useful program-specific com-
mands or options.
iTunes has one of my favorite dock menus, letting me control my music from the 
dock with options such as Play/Pause, Next or Previous Track, Repeat, and Shuffle.

CHAPTER 3  What’s Up, Dock?     53
Other programs, including Preview and Safari in Figure 3-3, offer you a list of 
open windows with a check mark to indicate the active window.
Finally, the items above the list of open windows for TextEdit (a bunch of chapters 
for this book in Figure 3-3) are recently used documents.
Reading dock icon body language
As you use the dock or when you’re just doing regular stuff on your Mac, the dock 
icons like to communicate with you. They can’t talk, so they have a few moves and 
symbols that indicate things you might want to know. Table 3-2 clarifies what’s 
up with your dock icons.
Opening files  
from the dock
One useful function of the dock is that 
you can use it to open the applica-
tion associated with that icon quickly 
and easily. The following tips explain 
several handy ways to open what you 
need from the dock:
»
» You can drag a document icon onto an application’s dock icon. If the 
application knows how to handle that type of document, its dock icon is 
TABLE 3-2	
What Dock Icons Are Telling You
Icon Movement or Symbol
What It Means
The icon moves up and out of its place in the dock 
for a moment, as shown on the right of Figure 3-4.
You single-clicked a dock icon, and it’s letting you 
know that you activated it.
The icon does a little bouncy dance when that 
program is open but isn’t active (that is, the menu 
bar isn’t showing, and it isn’t the frontmost program).
The program desires your attention; give its icon a 
click to find out what it wants.
A dot appears below its dock icon, as shown below 
both Safari icons in Figure 3-4.
This application is open.
An icon that isn’t ordinarily in the dock magically 
appears.
You see a temporary dock icon for every program 
that’s currently open until you quit that application. 
The icon appears because you’ve opened something. 
When you quit, its icon magically disappears.
FIGURE 3-4: 
The Safari dock icon at rest (left) and caught 
doing the bouncy dance (right).

highlighted, and the document opens in that application. If the application 
can’t handle that particular type of document, the dock icon isn’t highlighted, 
and you can’t drop the document onto it.
I’m getting ahead of myself here, but if the application can’t handle a docu-
ment, try opening the document this way: Select the document icon and 
choose File ➪ Open With, or right-click/Control-click the document icon and 
use the Open With menu to choose the application you want to open the 
document with. And if you hold down the Option key, the Open With com-
mand changes to Always Open With, which enables you to change the default 
application for this document permanently.
»
» You can find the original icon of any item you see in the dock by choos-
ing Show in Finder from its dock menu. This trick opens the window 
containing the item’s actual icon and thoughtfully selects that icon for you.
Customizing Your Dock
The dock is a convenient way to get at oft-used icons. By default, the dock comes 
stocked with icons that Apple thinks you’ll need most frequently (refer to Table 3-1),  
but you can customize it to contain any icons that you choose, as you discover in 
the following sections. You also find out how to resize the dock to fit your new set 
of icons and how to tell dock icons what your preferences are.
Adding dock icons
You can customize your dock with favorite applications, a document you update 
daily, or maybe a folder containing your favorite recipes. Use the dock for any-
thing you need quick access to.
Adding an application, file, or folder to the dock is as easy as 1-2-3:
1.	 Open a Finder window that contains an application, a document file, or a 
folder you use frequently.
You can also drag an icon — including a hard drive icon — from the desktop or 
any Finder window.
2.	 Click the item you want to add to the dock.
As shown in Figure 3-5, I chose the TextEdit application. (It’s highlighted.) I use 
TextEdit all the time to type and edit quick text notes, so having its icon on the 
dock is convenient for me.

CHAPTER 3  What’s Up, Dock?     55
3.	 Drag the icon out of the Finder window and onto the dock.
The icons to the left and right of the new icon magically part to make room for 
it. Note that the dock item isn’t the actual item. That item remains wherever 
it was — in a window or on the desktop. The icon you see in the dock is a 
shortcut that opens the item. I briefly mentioned aliases (known as shortcuts in 
the Windows world) earlier, but the icon on the dock is actually an alias of the 
icon you dragged onto the dock.
Furthermore, when you remove an icon from the dock, as you find out how 
to do in a moment, you aren’t removing the actual application, document, or 
folder. You’re removing only its shortcut from the dock.
Folder, disk, document, and URL icons must sit on the right side of the divider 
line in the dock; application icons must sit on the left side of it. Why does the 
dock force these rules upon you? I suppose that someone at Apple thinks this 
is what’s best for you. Who knows? But that’s the rule: apps on the left; folders, 
disks, documents, and URLs on the right.
As long as you follow the rule, you can add several items to either side of the 
divider line at the same time by selecting them all and dragging the group to that 
side of the dock. You can delete only one icon at a time from the dock, however.
Adding a URL to the dock works slightly differently. Here’s a quick way to add a 
URL to the dock:
1.	 Open Safari, and go to the page with a URL that you want to save in the 
dock.
2.	 Click the small icon that you find to the left of the URL in the address bar 
and drag it to the right side of the dividing line in the dock.
3.	 Release the mouse button when the icon is right where you want it.
The icons in the dock slide over and make room for your URL, as shown in 
Figure 3-6. From now on, when you click the URL icon that you moved to your 
dock, Safari opens to that page.
FIGURE 3-5: 
Adding an icon 
to the dock 
is as easy as 
1-2-3. Just drag 
the icon onto 
the dock.

56     PART 1  macOS Basics
If you open an icon that normally doesn’t appear in the dock, and you want to keep 
its temporary icon in the dock permanently, you have two ways to tell it to stick 
around after you quit the program:
»
» Control-click (or click and hold down) and choose Keep in Dock from the menu 
that pops up.
»
» Drag the icon (for an application that’s currently open) off and then back to 
the dock (or to a different position in the dock) without letting go of the mouse 
button.
Removing an icon from the dock
Removing an item from the dock is as easy as 1-2-3 but without the 3:
1.	 Drag its icon off the dock and onto the 
desktop.
2.	 When you see the Remove bubble (see 
Figure 3-7), release the icon (mouse button).
3.	 There is no Step 3.
You can also choose Remove from Dock in the 
item’s dock menu to get it out of your dock, but 
this way is way more fun.
You can’t remove the icon of a program that’s cur-
rently running from the dock by dragging it. Either 
wait until you quit the program or choose Remove 
from Dock in its dock menu.
FIGURE 3-6: 
Drag the 
icon from 
the address 
bar (top) to 
the right side 
of the dock 
(middle). The 
URL appears 
as a dock icon 
(bottom).
FIGURE 3-7: 
To remove an icon, drag it off 
the dock until it says Remove.

CHAPTER 3  What’s Up, Dock?     57
Also, note that by moving an icon off the dock, you aren’t moving, deleting, or 
copying the item itself; you’re just removing its icon from the dock. The item is 
unchanged. The icon is sort of like a library catalog card: Just because you remove 
the card from the card catalog doesn’t mean that the book is gone from the library.
The dock in OS X releases prior to Mountain Lion included icons for the Docu-
ments and Applications folders. The dock in Mountain Lion, Yosemite, Sierra, and 
High Sierra does not, at least not by default, show those folders. I mention it only 
because having those folders on the dock is convenient, and you should consider 
adding them to your dock if they aren’t already there.
On the other hand, for those with Macs that once ran OS X 10.7 (Lion) or earlier 
versions and have since been upgraded to High Sierra, your Documents and Appli-
cations folders should still be on your High Sierra dock unless you removed them 
at some point.
Resizing the dock
If the default size of the dock bugs you, you can make the dock smaller and save 
yourself a lot of screen real estate. This space comes in especially handy when you 
add your own stuff to the dock.
To shrink or enlarge the dock (and its icons) without opening the Dock Prefer-
ences window, follow these steps:
1.	 Make the Sizer appear by moving your cursor over the divider line that 
you find between apps and documents near the right side of the dock.
2.	 Drag the Sizer down to make the dock smaller, holding down the mouse 
button until you find the size you like.
The more you drag this control down, the smaller the dock gets.
3.	 To enlarge the dock again, just drag the Sizer back up.
Bam! Big dock! You can enlarge the dock until it fills your screen from side 
to side.
What should you put on your dock?
Put things on the dock that you need quick access to and that you use often, or 
add items that aren’t quickly available from menus or a Finder window’s sidebar. 
If you like using the dock better than the Finder window’s sidebar (for example), 
add your Documents, Movies, Pictures, Music, or even your Home folder or hard 
drive to the dock.

58     PART 1  macOS Basics
I suggest adding these items to your dock:
»
» A word-processing application: Most people use word-processing software 
more than any other applications. Just drag the icon for yours to the left side 
of the dock, and you’re good to go.
If you don’t have a word processor such as Microsoft Word or Apple Pages 
already, give TextEdit a try. It’s in every macOS Applications folder, and it’s 
more powerful than you expect from a freebie.
»
» A project folder: You know — the folder that contains all the documents for 
your thesis, or all the notes for the biggest project you have at work, or your 
massive recipe collection . . . whatever. If you add that folder to the dock, you 
can access it more quickly than if you have to open several folders to find it.
»
» A special utility or application: The Preview application is an essential part 
of my work because I receive a lot of different image files every day. You may 
also want to add Internet-enabled programs you use (such as Skype, Spotify, 
and Twitter), your favorite graphics applications (such as Adobe Photoshop or 
Photoshop Elements), or the game you play every afternoon when you think 
the boss isn’t watching.
»
» Your favorite URLs: Save links to sites that you visit every day — the ones 
you use in your job, your favorite Mac news sites, or your personalized page 
from an Internet service provider (ISP). Sure, you can make one of these pages 
your browser’s start page or bookmark it, but the dock lets you add one or 
more additional URLs. (Refer to the “Adding dock icons” section, earlier in this 
chapter, for details.)
You can add several URL icons to the dock, but bear in mind that the dock and 
its icons shrink to accommodate added icons, which makes them harder to 
see. Perhaps the best idea — if you want easy access to several URLs — is to 
create a folder full of URLs and put that folder on the dock. Then you can just 
press and hold your cursor on the folder (or Control-click the folder) to pop up 
a menu with all your URLs.
Even though you can make the dock smaller, you’re still limited to one row of 
icons. The smaller you make the dock, the larger the crowd of icons you can 
amass. You have to determine for yourself what’s best for you: having lots of icons 
available in the dock (even though they might be difficult to see because they’re so 
tiny) or having less clutter but fewer icons on your dock.
Figure 3-8 shows my dock, customized to my liking. Note that it’s been split in 
half for this figure, to make it easier for you to discern the individual icons.

CHAPTER 3  What’s Up, Dock?     59
After you figure out which programs you use and don’t use, it’s a good idea to 
relieve overcrowding by removing the ones you never (or rarely) use from the 
dock.
Setting your dock preferences
You can change a few things about the dock to make it look and behave just the 
way you want it to. First, I cover global preferences that apply to the dock itself. 
After that, I discuss some preferences that apply only to folder and disk icons in 
the dock.
Global dock preferences
To change global dock preferences, choose  ➪ System Preferences and then click 
the dock icon. The System Preferences application opens to the Dock pane (see 
Figure 3-9).
You can open the Dock System Preferences pane also by right-clicking or Control-
clicking the dock resizer and choosing Dock Preferences from the shortcut menu.
Now you can adjust your dock with the following preferences:
»
» Size: Note the slider bar here. Move this slider to the right (larger) or left (smaller) 
to adjust the size of the dock in your Finder. As you move the slider, watch the 
dock change size. (Now, there’s a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon!)

60     PART 1  macOS Basics
As you add items to the dock, the icons — and the dock itself — shrink to 
accommodate the new ones.
»
» Magnification: This slider controls how big icons grow when you pass the 
arrow cursor over them. Or you can deselect this check box to turn off 
magnification entirely.
»
» Position on Screen: Choose one of these three radio buttons to attach the 
dock to the left side, the right side, or the bottom of your screen (the default). 
I prefer it on the bottom, but you should probably try all three before you 
decide.
»
» Minimize Windows Using: From this handy pop-up menu (PC users would 
call it a drop-down list, but what the heck; there’s no gravity in a computer 
screen anyway), choose the animation that you see when you click a window’s 
Minimize (yellow by default) button. The Genie Effect is the default, but the 
Scale Effect seems a bit faster to me.
Want to amaze your friends? Surreptitiously hold down the Shift key when 
you click the Minimize button or the dock icon of a minimized window to 
make the animation effect play in super slow motion.
»
» Double-Click a Window’s Title Bar to Minimize (or Zoom): If you select this 
option, double-clicking anywhere in a window’s title bar minimizes (or zooms) 
the window.
This option achieves the same result as clicking the (usually) yellow button in a 
window’s upper-left corner. The difference is that the Minimize button is a tiny 
target and way over on the upper-left side of the window, whereas the title 
bar — the gray area with the window’s title (Dock in Figure 3-9) — makes a 
huge target the width of the window.
»
» Prefer Tabs When Opening Documents: This option opens the second 
document and all subsequent documents as tabs in the first document 
instead of opening them as individual windows.
»
» Minimize Windows into Application Icon: If you select this option, when 
you minimize a window by clicking its yellow gumdrop button, you won’t see 
a separate dock icon for that window.
If this option isn’t selected, each window you minimize gets its own personal 
icon on the right side of your dock.
»
» Animate Opening Applications: macOS animates (bounces) dock icons when 
you click them to open an item. If you don’t like the animation, deselect (that 
is, uncheck) this check box, and the bouncing ceases evermore.
»
» Automatically Hide and Show the Dock: Don’t like the dock? Maybe you want 
to free the screen real estate on your monitor? Then choose the Automatically 
Hide and Show the Dock check box; after that, the dock displays itself only when 

CHAPTER 3  What’s Up, Dock?     61
you move the cursor to the bottom of the screen where the dock would 
ordinarily appear. It’s like magic! (Okay, it’s like Windows that way, but I hate 
to admit it.)
If the dock isn’t visible, deselect the Automatically Hide and Show the Dock 
check box to bring back the dock. The option remains turned off unless 
you change it by selecting the Automatically Hide and Show the Dock check 
box. Choose    ➪ Dock ➪ Turn Hiding On (or use its keyboard shortcut 
⌘  +Option+D).
The keyboard shortcut ⌘  +Option+D is a toggle, so it reverses the state of this 
option each time you use it.
»
» Show Indicators for Open Applications: Select this option if you want all 
open applications to display a little black indicator dot below their dock, like 
the Finder icon in Figure 3-1. This program is open, whereas the others — the 
ones without black dots — are not. If you disable this option (although I can’t 
imagine why you’d ever want to), none of your dock icons will ever display an 
indicator dot.
Folder and disk dock icon menu preferences
If you click a folder or disk icon in the dock, its contents are displayed in a fan, 
grid, or list menu, as shown in Figure 3-10.
FIGURE 3-10: 
My Documents 
folder’s dock 
menu as a fan, 
list, and grid.

62     PART 1  macOS Basics
If you right-click or Control-click 
a folder or disk icon in the dock, its 
Options menu appears, as shown in 
Figure 3-11.
Here are the choices on the Options 
menu:
»
» Sort By determines the order in 
which items in the folder or drive 
appear when you click its dock icon.
»
» Display As determines what the 
dock icon for a folder or drive 
looks like. If you choose Stack, the 
icon takes on the appearance of 
the last item moved into the folder or drive. If you choose Folder, the dock 
icon looks like a folder, as does the Documents folder icon in Figure 3-11.
»
» View Contents As lets you choose Fan, Grid, or List as the menu type for the 
folder or drive.
The default is Automatic, which is to say that the dock tries to choose the 
menu for you. I much prefer choosing the menu I consider most appropriate 
for a particular folder or drive. I like list menus best, especially for folders or 
drives with a lot of subfolders. As you can see in Figure 3-10, the list menu is 
the only one that lets you see and access folders inside folders (and subfolders 
inside other subfolders). For folders with images, I like the grid menu because 
it displays easily discernible icons for the folder or drive’s contents. The fan 
menu is fantastic (ha!) when the folder or drive contains only a few items.
»
» The Options submenu contains the following items:
•	 Remove from Dock removes the icon from the dock.
•	 Show in Finder opens the window containing the item and selects the item. 
So, for example, in Figures 3-10 and 3-11, my Home folder would open, 
and the Documents folder inside it would be selected.
The dock is your friend. Now that you know how it works, make it work the way 
you want it to. Put those programs and folders you use most in the dock, and 
you’ll save yourself a significant amount of time and effort.

Delving Deeper into 
Finder and Its Desktop
O
n your Mac, Finder is your starting point — the centerpiece of your Mac 
experience, if you will — and it’s always available. In Finder windows or 
the desktop, you can double-click your way to your favorite application, 
your documents, or your folders. So, in this chapter, I show you how to get the 
most from the macOS High Sierra Finder and its desktop.
Introducing Finder and Its Minions: 
The Desktop and Icons
The Finder is a special application unlike any other. Its most significant differ-
ence from other applications is that it launches automatically when you log in, 
is always running in the background, and doesn’t include a Quit command. The 
desktop is a special part of Finder unlike any other. Finally, icons and windows are 
the units of currency used by Finder and the desktop.

66     PART 2  How Stuff Works
Before I tackle any deep thoughts — such as what Finder does or what the desktop 
is — I start with a quick overview of some of the icons you’re likely to encounter 
as you get to know Finder and the desktop.
Introducing the desktop
The desktop is the backdrop for Finder — everything you see behind the dock and 
any open windows. The desktop is always available and is where you can usually 
find your hard drive icon(s).
Explaining the Finder and desktop will be a whole lot easier with a picture for 
reference, so take a gander at Figure 4-1, which is a glorious depiction of a typical 
macOS High Sierra Finder.
FIGURE 4-1: 
A typical Finder 
and desktop.

CHAPTER 4  Delving Deeper into Finder and Its Desktop     67
If you’re not familiar with Finder and its desktop, here are a few tips that will 
come in handy as you become familiar with the icons that hang out there:
»
» Icons on the desktop behave the same as icons in a window. You move 
them and copy them just as you would icons in a window. The only difference 
is that icons on the desktop aren’t in a window. Because they’re on the desktop, 
they’re more convenient to use.
»
» The first icon you need to get to know is the icon for your startup disk  
(a hard drive or SSD; see Figure 4-2). You used to be able to find it on the 
top-right side of the desktop, as it is in Figure 4-1. Yours probably has the 
name Macintosh HD unless you’ve already renamed it. (I renamed my hard 
drive High Sierra SSD in Figure 4-2; see the section on renaming icons in 
Chapter 6 if you’d like to rename your own hard drive.) You can see how 
selected and deselected hard drive icons look in Figure 4-2, too.
High Sierra doesn’t display the startup disk’s icon on the desktop by default. 
So, if you don’t see your startup (boot) disk’s icon on the desktop but you’d like 
to, select the check box for hard drives in Finder Preferences as described in 
the “Setting Finder preferences” section, later in this chapter.
»
» Other disc or hard drive icons appear on the desktop by default. When 
you insert a CD or DVD or connect an external hard drive or a thumb drive, 
the disc or drive icon does appear on the desktop near the top-right corner. 
This feature is enabled by default; if yours isn’t 
enabled, just open Finder Preferences and select 
its check box as described later in the chapter.
»
» You can move an item to the desktop so you 
can find it right away. Simply click its icon in any 
window and then, without releasing the mouse 
button, drag it out of the window and onto the 
desktop. Then release the mouse button. This 
will move it from wherever it was to the desktop.
If you drag an item from an external volume to the desktop (or any location on 
your startup disk for that matter), the item is copied, not moved. Put another way, 
the item is moved if it’s on the same disk or volume, or copied if it’s on any other 
disk or volume.
Volume is the generic term for any storage container — a hard drive, solid-state 
drive, CD, DVD, disk image, or remote disk — that appears in the sidebar’s Devices 
section.
FIGURE 4-2: 
Unselected (left) and selected 
(right) hard-drive icons.

68     PART 2  How Stuff Works
At the bottom of the Finder window in Figure 4-1 are two optional bars. The lower 
of the two is called the status bar; it tells you how many items are in each window 
and, if any are selected, how many you’ve selected out of the total, as well as how 
much space is available on the hard drive containing this window. And just above 
the status bar is the path bar, which shows the path from the top level of your hard 
drive to the selected file (which is Sample File.jpg in Figure 4-1). You can show 
or hide the status bar by choosing View ➪ Hide/Show Status Bar and show or hide 
the path bar by choosing View ➪ Hide/Show Path Bar. Finally, when the toolbar is 
hidden (see the next section, “Bellying up to the toolbar”), the status bar moves 
to the top of the window (the path bar remains at the bottom of the window no 
matter what).
Bellying up to the toolbar
In addition to the sidebar (introduced in Chapter 2) and some good old-fashioned 
double-clicking, the macOS Finder window offers additional navigation aids on 
the toolbar — namely, the Back and Forward buttons, as well as the extra-helpful 
view buttons. You can find other handy features on the Go menu, discussed a little 
later in this chapter.
In case you didn’t know, the toolbar is the light gray band (see Figure 4-3) at the 
top of Finder windows, which (among other things) displays the window’s name. 
On the toolbar you’ll find buttons to navigate quickly and act on selected icons.
To activate a toolbar button, click it once.
You say you don’t want to see the toolbar at the top of the window? Okay! Just 
choose View ➪ Hide Toolbar or use its keyboard shortcut (⌘  +Option+T), and it’s 
gone. (If only life were always so easy!) Want it back? Choose View ➪ Show Tool-
bar or use the same keyboard shortcut: ⌘  +Option+T.
Alas, hiding the toolbar also hides the useful sidebar. If only you could choose to 
hide them independently. . . . I find this fact annoying because I use the sidebar a 
lot but don’t use the toolbar much. To make matters worse, View ➪ Hide Sidebar 
(shortcut: ⌘  +Option+S) lets you hide the sidebar without hiding the toolbar. It’s 
been like this for a long time, and for whatever reason, you still can’t hide the 
toolbar while keeping the sidebar visible! Boo. Hiss.
FIGURE 4-3: 
A Finder  
window’s 
default toolbar.

CHAPTER 4  Delving Deeper into Finder and Its Desktop     69
When you hide the toolbar, opening a folder spawns a new Finder window. The 
default, which is probably what you’re used to, is for folders to open in place, dis-
playing their contents in the current window.
The toolbar’s default buttons are shown in Figure 4-3.
One last thing: If you customized your toolbar by choosing View ➪ Customize 
Toolbar, yours won’t look exactly like Figure 4-3.
Here is the lowdown on the toolbar’s default buttons, from left to right:
»
» Forward and Back buttons: Clicking the Forward and Back buttons displays 
the folders that you’ve viewed in this window in sequential order. It’s a lot like 
using a web browser.
Here’s an example of how the Back button works. Say you’re in your Home 
folder; you click the Favorites button, and a split-second later, you realize that 
you actually need something in the Home folder. Just a quick click of the Back 
button and — poof! — you’re back Home. As for the Forward button, well, it 
moves you in the opposite direction, through folders that you’ve visited in 
this window. Play around with them both; you’ll find them invaluable. The 
keyboard shortcuts ⌘  +[ for Back and ⌘  +] for Forward are even more useful 
(in my opinion) than the buttons.
»
» View buttons: The four view buttons change the way that the window displays 
its contents.
You have four ways to view a window: Icon, List, Column, and Cover Flow. Some 
people like columns, some like icons, and others love lists or flows. To each her 
own. Play with the four Finder views to see which one works best for you. For 
what it’s worth, I usually prefer Column view with a dash of List view thrown in 
when I need a folder’s contents sorted by creation date or size. And the Cover 
Flow view is great for folders with documents because you can see the contents 
of many document types right in the window, as I explain shortly.
Don’t forget that each view also has a handy keyboard shortcut: ⌘  +1 for Icon 
view, ⌘  +2 for List view, ⌘  +3 for Column view, and ⌘  +4 for Cover Flow view. 
(Views are so useful you’ll find an entire section devoted to them later in this 
chapter.)
»
» Arrange: Click this button to see a pop-up menu with options for displaying 
this window’s contents, as shown in Figure 4-4, which also shows the View 
menu’s Arrange By submenu. Note that unlike the pop-up version, it displays 
useful keyboard shortcuts next to most commands. I use them often, and you 
should, too! Read more about Arrange By in “What’s on the (View) menu?” 
later in this chapter.

70     PART 2  How Stuff Works
In Figure 4-4, I am selecting Date Last Opened, and my Documents folder will 
reflect that choice when I release the mouse button.
One last thing: The Arrange By menu works in all four views.
»
» Action: Click this button to see a pop-up menu of all the context-sensitive 
actions you can perform on selected icons, as shown in Figure 4-5.
If you see angle brackets (>>) at the right edge of the toolbar, as shown in 
Figure 4-5, at least one toolbar item is not visible (the Edit Tags button and the 
search box in Figure 4-5). Click the angle brackets to select a hidden item. Or 
expand the window enough to display all the items in the toolbar.
»
» Share: Click here to share the selected items with others. A pop-up menu lets 
you choose to share via Mail, Messages, or AirDrop for all files and folders, 
with Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr also appearing if the selected item is an 
image (.jpeg, .jpg, .tiff, .tif, .png, and so on).
High Sierra’s extensible architecture lets you add other services (such as 
Vimeo or LinkedIn) and apps (such as iPhoto and Aperture) to your Share 
menu. To manage these extensions, choose More from the Share pop-up 
menu. Alternatively, you can launch the System Preferences application, click 
the Extensions icon, and then click the Share Menu item on the left side of the 
window.
»
» Tags: Click here to assign one or more colored tags to selected items. You 
find out more about tags and tagging in the “Customizing Finder Windows” 
section, later in this chapter.
»
» Search: The toolbar’s search box is a nifty way to search for files or folders. 
Just type a word (or even just a few letters), and in a few seconds, the window 
fills with a list of files that match. You can also start a search by choosing 
File ➪ Find (shortcut: ⌘  +F). You find out about searching in Chapter 8.

Figuring out what an icon is
What’s an icon? Glad you asked. Each Finder icon represents an item or a con-
tainer on your hard drive. Containers — hard drives, USB thumb drives, folders, 
CDs, DVDs, shared network volumes, and so on — can contain a virtually unlim-
ited number of application files, document files, and folders.
Icons on the dock and the sidebar of Finder windows are not the same as the 
Finder icons I describe in this chapter. They’re simply convenient pointers to 
actual Finder icons. Technically, dock and sidebar icons are aliases. (If you don’t 
yet know what an alias is, you’re going to find out long before the thrilling con-
clusion of this chapter.)
Anyway, working with icons is easy:
»
» Single-click to select.
»
» Double-click to open.
»
» Click and drag to move.
»
» Release mouse button to drop.
But enough talk. It’s time to see what these puppies look like.

72     PART 2  How Stuff Works
Identifying your Finder icons in the wild
Although icons all work the same, they come in different kinds, shapes, and sizes. 
When you’ve been around the Mac for a while, you develop a sixth sense about 
icons and can guess what an unfamiliar icon contains just by looking at it.
Here are the major icon types:
»
» Application icons are programs — the software you use to accomplish tasks 
on your Mac. Mail, Safari, and Calendar are applications. So are Microsoft 
Word and Adobe Photoshop.
Application icons come in a variety of shapes. For example, application icons 
are often square-ish, diamond-shaped, rectangular, or just oddly shaped. The 
first row of icons in Figure 4-6 displays application icons of various shapes.
»
» Document icons are files created by applications. Letters created with 
TextEdit are documents. This chapter began life as a document created in 
Microsoft Word. And spreadsheet, PDF, video, image, and song files are all 
documents.
Document icons are often reminiscent of a piece of paper, as shown in the 
second row of icons in Figure 4-6.
If your document icons are generic, like the first three icons in the second row 
of Figure 4-6, but you’d prefer icons that reflect their contents, like the last 
three icons in the second row of Figure 4-6, open View Options or use the  
⌘  +J shortcut, and then select the Show Icon Preview check box (see 
Chapter 24 for additional details about View Options).
FIGURE 4-6: 
Icons come in 
many shapes 
and designs.

CHAPTER 4  Delving Deeper into Finder and Its Desktop     73
»
» Folder and disk icons are the Mac’s organizational containers. You can put 
icons — and the applications or documents they stand for — in folders or 
disks. You can put folders in disks or in other folders, but you can’t put a disk 
inside another disk.
Folders look like, well, manila folders (what a concept) and can contain just 
about any other icon. You use folders to organize your files and applications 
on your hard drive. You can have as many folders as you want, so don’t be 
afraid to create new ones. The thought behind the whole folders thing is 
pretty obvious: If your hard drive is a filing cabinet, folders are its drawers and 
folders (duh!). The third row in Figure 4-6 shows some typical folder icons.
And while disks behave pretty much like folders, their icons often look like 
disks, as shown in the last row in Figure 4-6.
»
» Alias icons are wonderful — no, make that fabulous — organizational tools.  
I like aliases so much that they get an entire section to themselves.
If you’re looking for details about how to organize your icons in folders, move 
them around, delete them, and so on, hang in there. Chapter 6 is about organizing 
and managing files and folders.
Aliases Are Awesome!
An alias is a tiny file that automatically opens the file, folder, disk, or network vol-
ume that it represents. Although an alias is technically an icon, it’s different from 
other icons; it actually does nothing but open a different icon when you double-
click. Put another way, aliases are organizational tools that let you store an icon in 
more than one place without creating multiple copies of the file.
An alias is very different from a duplicated file. For example, the iTunes applica-
tion uses around 95 megabytes (MB) of hard drive space. If I were to duplicate 
iTunes, I’d have two files on my hard drive, each requiring around 95MB of disk 
space.
An alias of iTunes, on the other hand, looks just like the original iTunes icon and 
opens iTunes when you double-click it but uses a mere 736 bytes (4K) of hard 
drive space — a tiny fraction of its parent icon’s size. So try placing aliases of 
programs and files you use most often in convenient places such as the desktop or 
a folder in your Home folder.

74     PART 2  How Stuff Works
Why else do I think that aliases are so great? Well, they open any file or folder (or 
application) on any hard drive from anywhere else on any hard drive — which is 
a very good trick. But there are other reasons why I think aliases are awesome:
»
» Convenience: Aliases enable you to make items appear to be in more than 
one place, which on many occasions is exactly what you want to do. For 
example, keep an alias of your word-processing program on your desktop and 
another in your Documents folder for quick access. Aliases enable you to 
open your word processor right away without having to navigate into the 
depths of your Applications folder every time you need it.
While you’re at it, you might want to put an icon for your word processor in 
both the dock and the sidebar to make it even easier to open your word 
processor without a lot of clicking.
»
» Flexibility and organization: You can create aliases and store them any-
where on your hard drive to represent the same document in several 
different folders.
»
» Integrity: Some programs must remain in the same folder as their supporting 
files and folders. These programs won’t function properly unless they’re in the 
same folder as their dictionaries, thesauruses, data files (for games), templates, 
and so on. Thus, you can’t put the actual icons for such programs on the 
desktop without impairing their functionality. An alias lets you access a 
program like that from anywhere on your hard drive. (And it’s probably best 
to leave all your apps in the Applications folder, where they belong.)
I admit I’m somewhat old-school when it comes to organizing my files in the 
proper folders (see Chapter 6), but High Sierra’s speedy Spotlight search mecha-
nism along with tools such as Launchpad and Mission Control (all, not coinciden-
tally, discussed in Chapter 8), as well as the sidebar’s All My Files item, let you 
find pretty much any file on your disk in seconds.
Creating aliases
When you create an alias, its icon 
looks the same as the original icon 
it represents, but the suffix alias is 
tacked onto its name, and a tiny arrow 
called a badge (as shown in the mar-
gin) appears in the bottom-left corner 
of its icon. Figure 4-7 shows an alias 
and its parent icon  — the icon that 
opens if you double-click the alias.
FIGURE 4-7: 
An alias (right) and its parent.

CHAPTER 4  Delving Deeper into Finder and Its Desktop     75
To create an alias for an icon, do one of the following:
»
» Click the parent icon and choose File ➪ Make Alias.
»
» Click the parent icon and press ⌘  +L.
»
» Click the parent icon and use the Action menu’s Make Alias command (in the 
toolbar of all Finder windows).
»
» Click an icon while holding down the Control key (or right-click it or tap it with 
two fingers on a trackpad) and then choose the Make Alias command from 
the contextual menu that appears. (You can explore contextual menus — 
which are very cool — in Chapter 2.)
»
» Click any file or folder, press and hold down ⌘  +Option, and then drag the file 
or folder while continuing to hold down ⌘  +Option. Presto! An alias appears 
where you release the mouse button.
When I first create a file, I save it in its proper folder inside the Documents folder 
in my Home folder. If it’s a document that I plan to work on for more than a day or 
two (such as a magazine article or book chapter), I make an alias of the document 
(or folder) and plop it on my desktop. After I finish the article or chapter and sub-
mit it to an editor, I trash the alias, leaving the original file safe and sound, filed 
away in its proper folder, and leaving my desktop clean and uncluttered.
Deleting aliases
This is a short section because deleting an alias is such an easy chore. To delete an 
alias, simply drag it onto the Trash icon on the dock. That’s it! You can also Control-
click it and choose Move to Trash from the contextual menu that appears (right-
click or Control-click or two-finger tap), or select the icon and press ⌘  +Delete.
Deleting an alias does not delete the parent item. (If you want to delete the parent 
item, you have to go hunt it down and kill it yourself.)
Hunting down an alias’s parent
Suppose that you create an alias of a file, and later you want to delete both the 
alias and its parent file, but you can’t find the parent file. What do you do? Well, 
you can use Finder’s Find function to find it (try saying that three times real fast), 
but here are four faster ways to find the parent icon of an alias:
»
» Select the alias icon and choose File ➪ Show Original.
»
» Select the alias icon and press ⌘  +R.

76     PART 2  How Stuff Works
»
» Select the alias icon and use the Action menu’s Show Original command.
»
» Control-click (or right-click or two-fingered tap on a trackpad) the alias icon 
and choose Show Original from the contextual menu.
Any of these methods opens the window containing the parent document with its 
icon preselected for your convenience.
The View(s) from a Window
Views are part of what makes your Mac feel like your Mac. High Sierra offers four 
views so you can select the best one for any occasion. Some people like one view 
so much that they rarely (or never) use others. Other people, like me, memorize 
the keyboard shortcuts to switch views instantly without reaching for the mouse. 
Try ’em all, and use the one(s) you prefer.
Moving through folders fast in Column view
Column view is a darn handy way to quickly look through a lot of folders at once, 
and it’s especially useful when those folders are filled with graphics files. The 
Column view is my favorite way to display windows in Finder.
To display a window in Column view, shown in Figure 4-8, click the Column view 
button on the toolbar (as shown in the margin), choose View ➪ As Columns from 
Finder’s menu bar, or press ⌘  +3.
FIGURE 4-8: 
A Finder  
window in 
Column view.

CHAPTER 4  Delving Deeper into Finder and Its Desktop     77
Here’s how I clicked around in Column view to see the list of folders and files you 
see in Figure 4-8:
1.	 When I clicked the Documents icon in the sidebar, its contents appeared in the 
column to the right.
2.	 When I clicked the Templates folder in this column, its contents appeared in 
the second column.
3.	 When I clicked BDay Card Template.psd in the third column, the contents of that 
file appeared in the fourth column along with information about the file (its 
size is 44.8MB, it was created on December 2, 2011 at 8:57AM, it was modified 
on October 20, 2014, and so on).
The fourth column is displaying a Preview, a feature available in all views by 
choosing View ➪ Show/Hide Preview.
Here are some helpful tips when you’re poking around Column view:
»
» You can have as many columns in a Column view window as your screen 
can handle. Just drag any edge or corner of the window to enlarge it so new 
columns have room to open. You can also click the green Zoom (Maximize) 
button to make the window fill the screen. (Hint: To get out of full-screen 
mode, press Esc or move your cursor to the top of the screen and click the 
green Zoom button that appears near the top-left corner.)
If you Option-click the green Zoom button, the window will expand just 
enough to display all columns with content in them.
»
» You can use the little grabber handles at the bottom of every column to 
resize the column width.
You’ll see the grabber handles shown in Figure 4-8 only if you’ve selected 
Always Show Scroll Bars in the General System Preferences pane. If you select 
either of the other options, Automatically or When Scrolling, the grabber 
handles disappear. The funny thing is, everything works the same either way. 
So if you don’t see the grabber handles and would like to, open System 
Preferences, select the General icon, and then select Always Show Scroll Bars. 
If you don’t see grabber handles, click and drag the thin dividing line between 
the columns to achieve the same result.
To be specific:
•	 If you drag a handle left or right, the column to its left resizes.
•	 If you hold down the Option key when you drag, all columns resize at the 
same time.

78     PART 2  How Stuff Works
•	 If you double-click one of these little handles, the column to its left expands 
to the Right Size, which is the width of the widest item in the column.
•	 Right- or Control-click any grabber handle to display a pop-up menu with 
three options: Right Size This Column, Right Size All Columns Individually, 
and Right Size All Columns Equally.
»
» The preview column displays information about the highlighted item to 
its left, but only if that item isn’t a folder or disk. Why? Well, if it were a 
folder or disk, its contents would be in this column.
For many items, the picture you see in the preview column is an enlarged view 
of the file’s icon. You only see a preview (as shown in Figure 4-8) when the 
selected item is saved in a format that Quick Look (which you discover in 
Chapter 8) can interpret (which is to say, most image file formats, including 
TIFF, JPEG, PNG, GIF, and PDF to name a few, as well as many other file 
formats, including Microsoft Word and Pages).
If you don’t like having the preview displayed in Column view (but want it to 
remain in all other views), choose View ➪ Show View Options and deselect the 
check box for Show Preview Column. You can do the same for any other view, 
or turn the preview off in all views by choosing View ➪ Hide Preview.
Perusing in Icon view
Icon view is a free-form view that allows you to move your icons around within a 
window to your heart’s content. Refer to Figure 4-5 to see icons in my Documents 
folder displayed in Icon view.
To display a window in Icon view, click the Icon view button in the toolbar (shown 
in the margin), choose View ➪ As Icons from Finder’s menu bar, or press ⌘  +1.
The best part of Icon view, at least in my humble opinion, is the Icon Size slider 
in the lower-right corner of Icon view windows (or in the top-right corner if the 
sidebar and toolbar are hidden).
Listless? Try touring folders in List view
Now I come to my second-favorite view, List view (shown in Figure 4-9). I like it 
so much because of the little triangles to the left of each folder, known as disclo-
sure triangles, which let you see the contents of a folder without actually opening it. 
This view also allows you to select items from multiple folders at once and move 
or copy items between folders in a single window. Finally, it’s the view used to 
present Spotlight search results.

CHAPTER 4  Delving Deeper into Finder and Its Desktop     79
To display a window in List view, click the List view button on the toolbar (shown 
in the margin), choose View ➪ As List from the Finder menu bar, or press ⌘  +2.
When you’re in List view, the following tips can help you breeze through your 
folders to find what you’re looking for:
»
» To disclose a folder’s contents, click the triangle to its left or, if it’s 
selected, press the right-arrow key. Figure 4-9 shows the result of either 
clicking the triangle to the left of the Correspondence folder or selecting 
(highlighting) the Correspondence folder and pressing the right-arrow key.
I pressed Option+→ in Figure 4-9, so all of the Correspondence folder’s 
subfolders (the Old Correspondence folder in this case) also expanded. And 
if the Old Correspondence folder (or any other folder in the Correspondence 
folder) had subfolders, they too would have been expanded.
To close an open folder, click the triangle again or press left-arrow. To close all 
open folders in a List view window, choose Edit ➪ Select All (or press ⌘  +A) 
and then press Option+←.
»
» Click the column header to sort items in List view. Note the little triangle 
at the right edge of the selected column (the Name column in Figure 4-9). 
That’s the column’s sorting indicator. If the triangle points upward, as it does 
in Figure 4-9, the items in the corresponding column are sorted in alphabetical 
order; if you click the header (Name) again, the triangle will flip over to point 
downward and the items will be listed in the opposite (reverse alphabetical) 
order. This behavior is true for all columns in List view windows.
»
» You can change the order in which columns appear in a window. To do so, 
press and hold down on a column’s name, and then drag it to the left or right 
until it’s where you want it. Release the mouse button, and the column moves.
FIGURE 4-9: 
A window in 
List view.

80     PART 2  How Stuff Works
The exception (isn’t there always an exception?) is that the Name column 
always appears first in List view windows; you can move all other columns 
about at will. In fact, you can even hide and show columns other than Name 
if you like using the View Options window.
It’s even easier to hide or show columns by right- or Control-clicking anywhere 
on any column header (as shown on the right side of Figure 4-9). Column 
names with check marks are displayed; column names that are unchecked 
are hidden.
You can fine-tune all four views and the desktop by using the View Options 
window. Just choose View ➪ Show View Options or press ⌘  +J. The options 
you see apply to the active window or the desktop. Click the Use as Defaults 
button to apply these options to all windows in that view (that is, Icon, List, 
Column, or Cover Flow).
»
» To widen or shrink a column, hover the cursor over the dividing line 
between that column and drag left or right. When your cursor is over the 
dividing line in the header, it changes to a double-headed resizer, as shown in 
the margin.
You gotta go with the flow
If you’re familiar with the Cover Flow feature in iTunes, you’re already familiar 
with Finder’s Cover Flow view.
To display a window in Cover Flow view, click the Cover Flow view button on the 
toolbar (shown in the margin), choose View ➪ As Cover Flow from Finder’s menu 
bar, or press ⌘  +4. Figure 4-10 shows Cover Flow view.
FIGURE 4-10: 
A window in 
Cover Flow 
mode.

CHAPTER 4  Delving Deeper into Finder and Its Desktop     81
Cover Flow view has two cool features:
»
» The item selected in the list (z Alaska 2017 4.jpg in Figure 4-10) appears in a 
preview in the top part of the window.
»
» You can flip through the previews by clicking the images to the left or right of 
the current preview image or by sliding the scroll bar (above the Date Modified, 
Size, and Kind columns in Figure 4-10) to the left or right.
What’s next on the (View) menu?
The Finder View menu offers several commands in addition to the four views. 
These commands might help you peruse your icons more easily:
»
» Clean Up: Choose this command to align icons to an invisible grid; you use it 
to keep your windows and desktop neat and tidy. (If you like this invisible grid, 
don’t forget that you can turn it on or off for the desktop and individual 
windows by using View Options.) Clean Up is available only in Icon view or 
when no windows are active. If no windows are active, the command instead 
cleans up your desktop. (To deactivate all open windows, just click anywhere 
on the desktop or close all open windows.)
If any icons are selected (highlighted) when you pull down the View menu, you 
see Clean Up Selection rather than Clean Up. If you choose this command, it 
moves only the icons that are currently selected.
»
» Clean Up By: This command combines the tidiness of the Clean Up command 
with the organizational yumminess of the Arrange By command, which I 
mention earlier in this chapter and discuss in more detail shortly.
This command sorts the icons by your choice of criteria, namely:
•	 Name (shortcut: ⌘  +Option+1)
•	 Kind (shortcut: ⌘  +Option+2)
•	 Date Modified (shortcut: ⌘  +Option+5)
•	 Date Created (strangely, there’s no shortcut for this command)
•	 Size (shortcut: ⌘  +Option+6)
•	 Tags (shortcut: ⌘  +Option+7)
Clean Up By is similar to the Arrange By command, but unlike Arrange By, 
Clean Up By is a one-time affair. After you’ve used it, you can once again move 
icons around and reorganize them any way you like.

82     PART 2  How Stuff Works
»
» Arrange By: This command rearranges the icons in the active window in your 
choice from among nine ways, which happen to be the same nine options 
(ten, if you count None) in the Arrange By pop-up menu (shown earlier in 
Figure 4-4).
Note that when the desktop is active, this command is named Sort By; open a 
window in Icon view and it changes back to Arrange By. Seems weird, but it’s 
true.
Unlike Clean Up By, which is a one-shot command, Arrange By is persistent 
and will continue to reorganize your icons automatically. In other words, you 
can’t move icons around manually in an arranged window.
One last thing: The Clean Up and Clean Up By commands are available only 
for windows viewed as icons. The Arrange By command is available in all four 
views and remains in effect if you switch to a different view or close the 
window. To stop Finder from arranging icons in a window, choose None from 
either the View  ➪  Arrange By submenu or the toolbar’s Arrange pop-up 
menu, or use the keyboard shortcut, ⌘  +Control+0.
If you’re like me, you’ve taken great pains to place icons carefully in specific 
places on your desktop. If so, the Clean Up By and Arrange By/Sort By commands 
will mess up your perfectly arranged desktop icons. And alas, cleaning up your 
desktop is still not something macOS lets you undo.
Finder on the Menu
Finder’s menu bar is packed with useful goodies; in the following sections, I look 
at those that pertain specifically to using Finder.
The actual Finder menu
Here are a few of the main items you can find on the Finder menu:
»
» About Finder: Choose this command to find out which version of Finder is 
running on your Mac. This menu item isn’t particularly useful — or at least not 
for very long. But when a different application is running, the About Finder 
item becomes About application name and usually gives information about 
the program’s version number, the developers, and any other tidbits that 
those developers decide to throw in. Sometimes these tidbits are useful, 
sometimes they’re interesting, and sometimes they’re both.

CHAPTER 4  Delving Deeper into Finder and Its Desktop     83
»
» Preferences: Use the choices here to control how Finder looks and acts. Find 
out the details in the “Setting Finder preferences” section, later in this chapter.
»
» Services: One of the cool features of OS X applications is the accessibility of 
Services. If nothing is selected in Finder, the Services menu is empty, as shown 
in the top panel of Figure 4-11. When an icon or icons are selected, you can 
choose from four Services, as shown in the middle panel of Figure 4-11. 
Finally, if a word or words are selected, you have five different options, as 
shown in bottom pane of Figure 4-11.
In other words, the items you see in the Services menu are context-sensitive, 
so what you see in yours will depend on what you have selected. If you look in 
the Services menu and don’t find anything interesting, try selecting something 
else and looking again; you might be pleasantly surprised.
Choose the last item in the menu, Services Preferences, and you can enable 
dozens of useful Services that aren’t available by default.
»
» Hide Finder (⌘  +H): Use this command when Finder windows are open and 
are distracting you. Choosing it makes Finder inactive (another program 
becomes active) and hides any open Finder windows. To make Finder visible 
again, either choose Show All from the application’s self-named menu (the 
one that bears the name of the active application, such as Finder, TextEdit, or 
System Preferences) or click the Finder icon, shown in the margin here, on the 
dock.
The advantage to hiding Finder — rather than closing or minimizing all your 
windows to get a clean screen — is that you don’t have to open them all again 
when you’re ready to get the windows back. Instead, just choose Show All (to 
see all windows in all apps) or click the Finder button on the dock to see all 
Finder windows.
»
» Hide Others (Option+⌘  +H): This command hides all windows associated 
with all running programs except the active program. It appears in most 
applications’ self-named menus and is good for hiding distractions so you can 
focus on one thing: the unhidden application.
Another easy way to hide all open applications and windows while activating 
Finder is to hold down the ⌘   and Option keys and click the Finder icon on the 
dock. This technique works with whatever application is active, not just Finder. 
So if you’re surfing the web and decide you want to see only Safari’s windows 
on your screen, ⌘  +Option-click the Safari button on the dock, and it will 
happen instantly.
»
» Show All: Use this command as the antidote to both of the Hide commands. 
Choose this, and nothing is hidden anymore.

84     PART 2  How Stuff Works
Note that all three of these commands require that at least one application be 
running in addition to Finder. Put another way, when Finder is the only app 
running, these three commands are grayed out and unavailable.
You can achieve much the same effect as all this hide-and-show jazz with 
Mission Control, which I discuss in Chapter 8.
Finally, if you noticed that Finder menu’s Empty Trash command isn’t mentioned 
here, that’s because it gets detailed coverage in Chapter 6.

Like a road map: The current  
folder’s pop-up menu
In the center of the window’s title bar is the name of the folder that you’re view-
ing in this window: the highlighted folder. You know that already. What you might 
not know is that it offers a hidden road map to this folder from the top level. The 
following steps explain how it works:
1.	 ⌘  -click or Control-click the folder’s name in the title bar.
A pop-up menu appears, with the current folder (Desktop in Figure 4-12) at 
the top.
2.	 Select any folder in the menu, and it becomes the highlighted folder in 
the current window. Release the mouse button, and that folder’s 
contents are displayed.
As shown in Figure 4-12, the contents of the Desktop folder — four files — are 
displayed in the window. If I release the mouse button, the contents of the 
highlighted folder (hsbob) will appear, replacing the contents of the Desktop 
folder.
3.	 After jumping to a new folder, you can click the Back button.
Hey, you’re right back where you were before you touched that pop-up menu!
Don’t forget that you can display the path bar near the bottom of the window (it’s 
showing in Figures 4-9, 4-10, and 4-12) by choosing View ➪ Show Path Bar. Then 
you can double-click any folder displayed in the path bar to open it. This last trick 
works not only on Finder windows but also with the title bar of most document 
windows (Word, Photoshop, and so on), showing you the path to the folder con-
taining the document you’re working on.

Going places with the Go menu
The Go menu is chock-full of shortcuts. The items on this menu take you to places 
on your Mac — many of the same places you can go with the Finder window’s 
toolbar — and a few other places.
The following list gives you a brief look at the items on the Go menu:
»
» Back (⌘  +[): Use this menu option to return to the last open Finder window. 
It’s equivalent to the Back button on the Finder toolbar, in case you have the 
toolbar hidden.
»
» Forward (⌘  +]): This command is the opposite of using the Back command, 
moving you forward through every folder you open. Remember that if you 
haven’t gone back, you can’t go forward.
»
» Enclosing Folder (⌘  +↑): This command tells the Finder window to display the 
folder where the currently selected item is located.
»
» All My Files (Shift+⌘  +F): This command shows you all your document files at 
once.
This is a good time to use the Arrange pop-up menu to sort these files into 
some semblance of order.
»
» Documents (Shift+⌘  +O): You’ll probably use this command often because 
the Documents folder is a great place to save documents you create.
»
» Desktop (Shift+⌘  +D): Use this command to display the Desktop folder, 
which contains the same icons as the desktop you see behind open windows.
»
» Downloads (Option+⌘  +L): This opens your Downloads folder, which is 
where files you download in Safari, save as attachments in Mail, or receive via 
AirDrop (explained shortly) are saved by default.
»
» Home (Shift+⌘  +H): Use this command to have the Finder window display 
your Home folder (which is named with your short name).
»
» Computer (Shift+⌘  +C): This command tells the Finder window to display the 
Computer level, showing your network and all your disks.
»
» AirDrop (Shift+⌘  +R): AirDrop lets you share files wirelessly with anyone 
around you. No setup or special settings are required. Just click the AirDrop 
icon in the Finder sidebar, use this menu item, or use the keyboard shortcut, 
and your Mac automatically discovers other people nearby who are using 
AirDrop. Bear in mind that not all Macs capable of running High Sierra support 
AirDrop. Note: If your Mac is 2009 vintage (or older), AirDrop might not work.
AirDrop now works between Macs and late-model iDevices running iOS 8. 
Which late model devices, you ask? AirDrop in High Sierra supports file 

CHAPTER 4  Delving Deeper into Finder and Its Desktop     87
sharing with the iPhone 5 and later, fourth-gen and later iPads, all iPad Minis, 
and fifth-gen and later iPod touches.
»
» Network (Shift+⌘  +K): This command displays whatever is accessible on 
your network in the Finder window.
»
» iCloud Drive (Shift+⌘  +I): This command opens a window that displays the 
contents of your iCloud drive (which you read more about in Chapter 6).
»
» Applications (Shift+⌘  +A): This command displays your Applications folder, 
the usual storehouse for all the programs that came with your Mac (and the 
most likely place to find the programs you install).
»
» Utilities (Shift+⌘  +U): This command gets you to the Utilities folder inside 
the Applications folder in one fell swoop. The Utilities folder is the repository of 
such useful items as Disk Utility (which lets you erase, format, verify, and repair 
disks) and Disk Copy (which you use to create and mount disk-image files). 
»
» Recent Folders: Use this submenu to quickly go back to a folder that you 
recently visited. Every time you open a folder, OS X creates an alias to it and 
stores it in the Recent Folders folder. You can open any of these aliases from 
the Recent Folders command on the Go menu.
»
» Go to Folder (Shift+⌘  +G): This command summons the Go to the Folder 
dialog, shown in Figure 4-13. Look at your desktop. Maybe it’s cluttered with 
lots of windows, or maybe it’s empty. Either way, suppose you’re several clicks 
away from a folder that you want to open. If you know the path from your 
hard drive to that folder, you can type the path to the folder in the Go to the 
Folder text box — separating folder names with forward slashes (/) — and 
then click Go to move (relatively) quickly to the folder you need.
The first character you type must also be a forward slash, as shown in 
Figure 4-13, unless you’re going to a subfolder of the current window (Books-
Fiction in Figure 4-13).
This particular dialog is a tad clairvoyant in that it tries to guess which folder 
you mean by the first letter or two that you type. For example, in Figure 4-13, 
I typed the letter A and paused, and the window guessed that I wanted 
Applications. Then I pressed the right-arrow key to accept the guess and 
typed /U, and the window guessed the rest (tilities) and filled it in for me.
»
» Connect to Server (⌘  +K): If your Mac is connected to a network or to the 
Internet, use this command to reach those remote resources.
One last thing: If you’re looking for the Library folder inside your Home folder, 
which used to appear in the Go menu (before OS X 10.7 Lion), it’s now hidden for 
your protection (as I explain in Chapter 6). To reveal it, hold down the Option key 
before you open the Go menu.

88     PART 2  How Stuff Works
Customizing Finder Windows
The Finder is outrageously handy. It not only gives you convenient access to mul-
tiple windows but also offers ways to tweak what you see until you get what works 
best for you. So whereas earlier sections in this chapter explain what Finder is and 
how it works, the following sections ask, “How would you like it to be?”
Adding folders to the sidebar
Adding any file or folder you like to the sidebar is easy. All you need to do is select 
the file or folder you want to add and choose File ➪ Add to Sidebar from the menu 
bar (or use its shortcut ⌘  +Control+T ). You can now use the item anytime you like 
by clicking it in the sidebar of any Finder window. Better still, you can move files 
or folders into folders in the sidebar by dragging them onto the folder’s sidebar 
icon.
You can add folders (but not files) to the sidebar by dragging them onto the 
sidebar.
Be careful not to drag a folder onto another folder or it will be moved into that 
folder instead of being added to the sidebar. You’ll see a little line above or below 
existing folders in the sidebar; that shows you where this folder will appear if you 
release the mouse button. If a folder in the sidebar is highlighted and you don’t 
see the little line, releasing the mouse button will not add the folder to the sidebar, 
but will move it into the highlighted folder.
FIGURE 4-13: 
Go to a folder 
by typing its 
path.

CHAPTER 4  Delving Deeper into Finder and Its Desktop     89
To remove an item from the sidebar, right- or Control-click the item and choose 
Remove from Sidebar. Or drag the item off the sidebar and release the mouse but-
ton when the little x-in-a-circle appears.
Setting Finder preferences
You can find Finder and Desktop preferences by choosing Finder ➪ Preferences. In 
the Finder Preferences window that appears, click the icons in the toolbar to select 
one of the four Finder Preferences panes: General, Tags, Sidebar, and Advanced, 
all of which are shown in Figure 4-14.
General pane
In the General pane, you find the following options:
»
» Show These Items on the Desktop check boxes: Select or deselect these 
check boxes to choose whether icons for hard drives; external disks; CDs, 
DVDs, and iPods; and connected servers appear on the desktop. macOS High 
Sierra deselects all four options by default. If you don’t want disk icons 
cluttering your beautiful desktop, deselect (clear) these check boxes as shown 
FIGURE 4-14: 
Set Finder  
preferences 
here.

90     PART 2  How Stuff Works
in Figure 4-14. When they’re deselected, you can still work with hard drives, 
CDs, DVDs, and other types of disks. You just have to open a Finder window 
and select the disk or disc you want in the sidebar.
»
» New Finder Windows Show: Here, you can choose whether opening a new 
Finder window displays All My Files, your Home folder (which is my prefer-
ence), the Documents or Desktop folders, or any other disk or folder. (All My 
Files is the default.)
»
» Open Folders in Tabs Instead of New Windows check box: Selecting this 
check box spawns a new tab in the current window when you press ⌘   and 
double-click a folder or disk.
If you don’t enable it, ⌘  +double-clicking a folder or disk icon opens it in a new 
window.
The default behavior is for folders to open in place when you double-click 
(open) them, which prevents window clutter. If you want a new window or tab 
instead, press ⌘   before you double-click. This forces the folder to open in a 
new window or tab (depending on whether the box is checked or not). Between 
this feature and Column view, I rarely need more than two windows onscreen, 
and I get by most of the time with a single window with multiple tabs.
Tags pane
The Tags pane is where you manage your tags, which appear in Finder’s File 
menu, the right- or Control-click shortcut menu, the sidebar, and the toolbar. You 
can see a file or folder’s tags in Finder windows, Get Info windows and inspec-
tors, and applications’ Open and Save dialogs and sheets, and you can use them as 
criteria for searches and smart folders.
A sheet is nothing more than a dialog that is attached to a document window’s 
title bar and can’t be moved. Some apps use sheets, other apps use dialogs, but 
either way you’ll see the same options.
»
» To rename a tag, click its name and type a new one.
»
» To change a tag’s color, click the colored circle to the left of its name and 
choose a different color.
»
» Select the boxes for tags that you want to appear in the sidebar and toolbar, 
as shown in Figure 4-15. (These are the selections made in the Finder 
Preferences pane on the left in Figure 4-15.)
To see your deselected tags in the sidebar or toolbar, click All Tags in (Sidebar) or 
Show All (toolbar).

CHAPTER 4  Delving Deeper into Finder and Its Desktop     91
Now, here’s how to use ’em. To assign tags to icons, first select the icon(s) and 
then follow these steps:
1.	 Choose File ➪ Tags and click one or more of the colored dots in the Tags 
section.
2.	 Right- or Control-click and click one or more of the colored dots in the 
Tags section of the shortcut menu.
3.	 Click the Tags button on the toolbar and click one or more tags.
Here are a few more handy tricks with tags:
»
» To create a custom tag on the fly: Right- or Control-click an item, choose 
Tags, type a label for the new tag, and then press Return.
»
» To untag an item: Right- or Control-click the item, choose Tags, select the tag 
you want to remove, and then press Delete.
»
» To remove every instance of a tag from every file and folder on your 
disk: Right- or Control-click the tag in the Tags pane of Finder Preferences, 
and then choose Delete Tag. Don’t worry. Deleting a tag won’t delete the 
items; it just removes that tag from every item.
Click the tags in your sidebar to see every file on all connected hard drives with 
that tag.
Sidebar pane
The Sidebar pane lets you choose which items are displayed in the sidebar. Select 
the check box to display the item; deselect the check box to not display it.
FIGURE 4-15: 
Selecting the 
check boxes 
for these five 
tags displays 
them in the 
sidebar and in

Tags button.

92     PART 2  How Stuff Works
Advanced pane
The Advanced pane is just big enough to offer the following check boxes and a 
pop-up menu:
»
» Show All Filename Extensions check box (off by default): Tells Finder to 
display the little two-, three-, four-, or more character filename suffixes (such 
as .doc in summary.doc) that make your Mac’s file lists look more like those of 
a Linux (or Windows) user. The Finder hides those from you by default, but if 
you want to be able to see them in Finder when you open or save files, you 
need to turn on this option.
»
» Show Warning Before Changing an Extension check box (on by default): 
Allows you to turn off the nagging dialog that appears if you attempt to 
change the two-, three-, four-, or more character file extension.
»
» Show Warning Before Removing from iCloud Drive (on by default): Does 
what it says — warns you before you remove a file or folder from your iCloud 
drive.
»
» Show Warning Before Emptying the Trash check box (on by default): 
Allows you to turn off the nagging dialog telling you how many items are in 
the Trash and asking whether you really want to delete them.
»
» Remove Items from the Trash After 30 Days check box (off by default): 
This option does exactly what it says: It automatically deletes any item in the 
Trash for more than 30 days. Think of it as automatic emptying of the Trash 
for items that have been there 30 days or longer.
»
» Keep Folders on Top when Sorting by Name (off by default): This one sorts 
folders and then files in windows sorted by Name. I love it and encourage you 
to enable it and give it a try.
»
» When Performing a Search pop-up menu: Lets you choose the default 
search location when you initiate a search as described earlier in this chapter. 
Your choices are Search This Mac (the default), Search the Current Folder, and 
Use the Previous Search Scope.
Digging for Icon Data in the Info Window
Every icon has an Info window that gives you  — big surprise!  — information 
about that icon and enables you to choose which other users (if any) you want to 
have the privilege of using this icon. (I discuss sharing files and privileges in detail 
in Chapter 15.) The Info window is also where you can lock an icon so that it can’t 
be renamed or dragged to the Trash.

CHAPTER 4  Delving Deeper into Finder and Its Desktop     93
To see an icon’s Info window, click the icon and choose File ➪ Get Info (or press 
⌘  +I). The Info window for that icon appears. Figure 4-16 shows the Info window 
for an image (a .jpg file named Kiss me).
Documents, folders, and disks each have slightly different Info windows. In this 
section, I give you highlights on the type of information and options that you 
can find.
FIGURE 4-16: 
A typical Info 
window for an 
image (a .jpg 
file named  
Kiss me).

94     PART 2  How Stuff Works
The gray triangles reveal what information for an icon is available in this particu-
lar Info window. The sections that you see for most icons include the following:
»
» Add Tags: Click in this field to add tags to this item.
»
» General: For information of the general kind, such as
•	 Kind: What kind of file this is — an application, document, disk, folder, and 
so on
•	 Size: How much hard drive space this file uses
•	 Where: The path to the folder that contains this file
•	 Created: The date and time this file was created
•	 Modified: The date and time this file was last modified (that is, saved)
Six other check boxes may or may not appear in the General section of a 
particular Info window. Here’s the scoop on this sextet of optional options:
•	 Version: Copyright information and the file’s version number
•	 Open in 32-Bit Mode (check box): Most late-model Macs can take advantage 
of High Sierra’s high-performance 64-bit processing mode. But not all 
applications are designed to take advantage of this mode, so sometimes 
programs that should run in 64-bit mode don’t run properly. If an applica-
tion doesn’t work properly — it often quits unexpectedly, freezes, or 
refuses to launch at all — try selecting this check box. It couldn’t hurt.
This option is available only for applications designed to run in both modes; 
if you don’t see this check box, the program you’re using can run in only 
one mode.
•	 Shared Folder (check box): Designates the folder as Shared, so other users 
are allowed to see and use its contents. You find out all about sharing in 
Chapter 15.
•	 Stationery Pad (check box): This one appears only in the Info window of 
document icons. If you select it, the file becomes a template. When you 
open a Stationery Pad document, a copy of its contents appears in a new 
Untitled document that you would typically save with a descriptive name.
•	 Locked (check box): If this box is selected, you receive the following warning 
if you try to put the item in the Trash: This Item Is Locked. Do You Want to 
Move It to the Trash Anyway? Your options are Stop and Continue. If you 
continue, the item goes into the Trash as usual. Then, when you try to 
empty the Trash, you receive another warning: There Are Some Locked Items 
in the Trash. Do You Want to Remove All the Items, Including the Locked Ones, 
or Just the Unlocked Ones? Your choices this time are Cancel, Remove 
Unlocked Items, and Remove All Items. If you choose to Remove All Items, 

CHAPTER 4  Delving Deeper into Finder and Its Desktop     95
the locked item(s) is/are deleted. If you choose Remove Unlocked Items, 
the locked item(s) remain(s) in the Trash, and you receive the There Are 
Some Locked Items warning again the next time you try to empty it.
To remove the locked item from the Trash, click the Trash icon in the dock 
and drag the locked item out of the Trash and into a folder or onto the 
desktop.
•	 Prevent App Nap (check box): macOS can tell when an app is completely 
hidden behind other windows. If an app isn’t currently doing something — 
playing music, downloading files, or checking your email, for example — 
App Nap conserves valuable battery life on laptops by slowing the app 
down. As soon as you activate the app again, it shifts back to full speed 
instantly.
•	 While App Nap can reduce CPU energy use by up to 23 percent, it may 
interfere with some programs’ operation. If it does, try enabling this 
check box.
»
» More Info: When the file was created, modified, and last opened (documents 
only).
»
» Name & Extension: Tells the full name, including the (possibly hidden) 
extension.
»
» Comments: Provides a field in which you can type your own comments about 
this icon for Spotlight to use in its searches.
I talk about searching a little earlier in this chapter and discuss Spotlight 
searches in greater detail in Chapter 8.
»
» Preview: When you select a document icon, the menu offers a Preview option 
that you use to see a glimpse of what’s in that document. You can also see this 
preview when you select a document icon in Column view; it magically 
appears in the rightmost column. If you select a QuickTime movie or sound, 
you can play your selection right there in the preview pane without launching 
a separate application. And when you select most pictures, you see a preview 
of the actual picture (me in Kiss makeup on Halloween in Figure 4-16).
»
» Sharing & Permissions: Governs which users have access to this icon and 
how much access they are allowed. (See Chapter 15 for more about access 
privileges.)
If you press the Option key before you pull down Finder’s File menu, the Get Info 
command changes to Show Inspector (alternatively, press ⌘  +Option+I). The Get 
Info Inspector window looks and acts almost exactly like Get Info windows with 
two whopping exceptions:

96     PART 2  How Stuff Works
»
» Inspector displays info for only the currently selected icon. If you click a 
different icon, Inspector instantly displays the info for the icon you clicked. 
That means you can Get Info on lots of icons in a row using the arrow keys or 
by pressing Tab or Shift+Tab. Try it — it’s cool.
»
» Cumulative info is displayed if multiple icons are selected. In other words, 
if more than one icon is selected, Inspector displays the total size for all the 
selected files or folders or both.
And that’s about it for icons, which are among the most fundamental parts of 
what makes your Mac a Mac (and not a toaster or an Xbox).

CHAPTER 5  Having It Your Way     97
Having It Your Way
E
veryone works a bit differently, and everyone likes to use the Mac in a par-
ticular way. In this chapter, you find out how to tweak various options so 
everything is just the way you like it. The first things many people like to do 
are set their background and screen saver to something more interesting. You can 
begin with that stuff, but keep in mind that you can do much more.
You can change the colors in windows, the standard font, and more if you like. Your 
Mac lets you choose how onscreen elements behave and how your hardware —  
such as the keyboard, mouse, and any wireless Bluetooth gadgets — interacts with 
your Mac.
Introducing System Preferences
You should start by becoming familiar with System Preferences, which lives in the 
Applications folder and appears on the Apple ( ) menu and in the dock.
The following steps explain how to move around the System Preferences window, 
no matter what you’re trying to tweak:

98     PART 2  How Stuff Works
1.	 Open the System Preferences window, shown in Figure 5-1.
You can open System Preferences in at least four ways:
•	 Double-click the System Preferences icon in your Applications folder.
•	 Choose   ➪ System Preferences.
•	 Click the System Preferences icon in Launchpad.
•	 Click the System Preferences icon on your dock.
2.	 Click any of the icons in the System Preferences window.
The contents of the window change to reflect the options for whichever icon 
you click. When this happens, I call the window a pane. So, for example, when 
you click the General icon in the System Preferences window, the icons 
disappear and are replaced by the General preference pane.
When you finish working with System Preferences panes, you should (of 
course) quit by choosing System Preferences ➪ Quit System Preferences 
(shortcut: ⌘  +Q).
Not every app quits when you close its last open window, but System 
Preferences does, so closing its (only) window also quits the app.
3.	 Click the Show All button in the toolbar to exit the pane and return to the 
icons in the System Preferences window.
You can accomplish the same thing by choosing View ➪ Show All Preferences, 
or by pressing ⌘  +L; both return you to the window with icons for all of your 
System Preferences panes.
Alternatively, you can choose a different preference pane right from the View 
menu or the dock icon menu, both shown in Figure 5-2.
FIGURE 5-1: 
System Prefer-
ences is where 
you change 
many High 
Sierra options.

CHAPTER 5  Having It Your Way     99
If you right- or Control-click the System Preferences icon on the dock (or just 
press and hold down for a couple of seconds), a menu pops up listing all 
available preference panes. The cool part is that this works even if the System 
Preferences window isn’t open. When you know which pane you need, this 
shortcut is often the fastest way to get to it.
Last but not least, note that you can navigate to the next or previous pane 
you’ve viewed with the Back and Forward buttons beside the red and yellow 
gumdrops (shortcuts ⌘  +[ and ⌘  +], respectively). Back and Forward com-
mands also appear on the View menu.
One last general tip before you work with an actual preference pane: You can get 
rid of the categories altogether and display the icons in alphabetical order. As 
a bonus, it makes the System Preferences window roughly 25 percent smaller 
onscreen. To switch to alphabetical view, choose View ➪ Organize Alphabetically. 
The categories disappear, the window shrinks, and the icons are alphabetized, 
as shown in Figure 5-2. To switch from alphabetical view back to category view, 
choose View ➪ Organize by Categories.
High Sierra lets you hide little-used System Preferences pane icons. To manage 
icons, choose View ➪ Customize, and a little check box appears next to each icon. 
Deselect the box if you want to hide the icon; select the box to make the icon 
reappear.
Click Done when you’re finished selecting and deselecting.

Putting a Picture on the Desktop
Figure 5-3 shows my desktop with a portrait of my dog Zeke painted by talented 
artist Jeanne Illenye. (Refer to the default desktop background in Figure 5-2.)
Here’s how you can change your desktop picture:
1.	 From the desktop, choose  ➪ System Preferences.
Or right- or Control-click the desktop, choose Change Desktop Background 
from the contextual menu, and skip to Step 3.
The System Preferences window appears.
2.	 Click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon.
When the Desktop & Screen Saver pane appears, click the Desktop tab (if it’s 
not selected already, as it is in Figure 5-3).
3.	 Click a folder in the column on the left, and then click a picture in the 
area on the right.
In Figure 5-3, I clicked a picture called Zeke Vizsla, one of the items in the 
Pictures folder inside my Home folder.
FIGURE 5-3: 
My beautified

CHAPTER 5  Having It Your Way     101
You have at least three other ways to change your desktop picture:
»
» Drag a picture file from the Finder onto the image well (the little rectangular 
picture to the left of the picture’s name, as shown in Figure 5-3).
»
» Click the Desktop tab in the Desktop & Screen Saver System Preferences pane 
and then click the + button at the bottom of the list on the left. Choose a 
folder in the standard Open File sheet and that folder appears in the list; you 
can use any picture files it contains for your desktop picture.
»
» Click the disclosure triangle next to Photos in the column on the left side of 
the Desktop & Screen Saver Preferences pane and choose from pictures 
stored in your Photos (or iPhoto or Aperture) libraries.
Although I love having a beautiful desktop picture, I use a light gray or white 
desktop (click Solid Colors in the list, and then click the light gray or white color 
swatch) for most of the figures in this book so you can see fine details.
If you need a color other than the 16 hues displayed in the Desktop & Screen Saver 
System Preferences pane, click the Custom Color button. When the Color Picker 
window appears, either click a color to choose it or click the eyedropper icon and 
then click any color displayed on your screen to select and use that color.
Setting Up a Screen Saver
macOS comes with several screen-saver modules, and many more are available for 
free (search for macOS Screen Saver). To set up your screen saver, follow these steps:
1.	 Open System Preferences, click the Desktop & Screen Saver icon, and 
then click the Screen Saver tab to see the options shown in Figure 5-4.
2.	 In the Screen Savers column on the left side of the pane, choose a screen 
saver that interests you.
Scroll down to see all the available Slideshows and Screen Savers.
If you can’t decide, scroll to the bottom of the screen savers list and choose 
Random to have your Mac choose a different screen saver at random each 
time the screen saver kicks in.
3.	 (Optional) To see what the chosen module looks like in action, click the 
Preview image on the right.
A little Preview button appears on the image when you hover your cursor over 
it to remind you how to see a preview. Nice touch!
Press any key or click anywhere to end the test.

4.	 After you choose a screen saver, select the number of minutes you want 
the Mac to wait before activating the screen saver from the Start After 
pop-up menu.
5.	 Select the Show with Clock check box to display a digital clock along with 
the screen saver.
6.	 (Optional) Click the Hot Corners button to choose which corner of your 
screen activates the screen saver and which disables it.
If you enable this option, when you move your cursor to the chosen corner of 
the screen, you activate or disable the screen saver until you move the cursor 
elsewhere. Note that hot corners are optional and are turned off by default.
7.	 When you’re done, close the Desktop & Screen Saver pane.
You can require a password to wake your Mac from sleep or a screen saver. To do 
so, follow these steps:
1.	 From the main System Preferences screen, click the Security & Privacy 
icon.
The Security & Privacy System Preferences pane appears.

Putting Widgets on the Dashboard
The dashboard offers a way-cool set of widgets, Apple’s name for the mini- 
applications that live inside the Dashboard layer. You see, the dashboard takes 
over your screen when you invoke it (as shown in Figure 5-5) by opening it (it’s 
in the Applications folder) or pressing its keyboard shortcut: F12 (or Fn+F12). 
In Figure 5-5, the dashboard is shown with its four default widgets: Calculator, 
Weather, World Clock, and Calendar.
Widgets are small, single-function applications that work only within the dash-
board. Some widgets, such as Contacts and Calendar, talk to applications on your 
Mac. Other widgets — such as Flight Tracker, Stocks, Movies, and Weather — 
gather information for you via the Internet.
The following tips can help you work with widgets:
»
» Each time you invoke the dashboard, widgets that were open the last time 
you used it will be on your screen.
»
» To close an open widget, click the minus sign in a circle in the lower-left 
corner of the screen and then click the encircled X in the top-left corner of the 
widget you want to close. Alternatively, you can press the Option key and 
hover the cursor over a widget to reveal its encircled X; click the X to close the 
widget.
»
» To configure most widgets, move your cursor over the bottom-right corner 
of a widget and click the little i that appears (as it does with the Weather 
widget in Figure 5-5). The widget then flips around so you can see its backside, 
FIGURE 5-5: 
The dashboard 
lives in its own 
overlay layer 
in front of your 
desktop.

104     PART 2  How Stuff Works
where the configuration options reside. For example, the Weather widget 
gives you choices that include City, State, or Zip Code, Fahrenheit or Celsius, 
and whether to include lows in the six-day forecast (as shown in Figure 5-5), 
and the Clock widget allows you to choose your region and city.
When you finish configuring a widget, click the Done button, which is usually 
(but not always) in the bottom-right corner; doing so flips the widget around 
again.
Not all widgets can be configured. For example, the Calendar and Calculator 
widgets have no options to configure. If a little i doesn’t appear when you 
hover the pointer over the bottom-right corner of a widget (or hover while 
pressing the Option key), that widget has no options to configure.
»
» To move a widget around on your screen, click almost anywhere on the 
widget and then drag it to the appropriate location.
To access widgets other than the four on your screen by default, click the 
Open button (the large encircled plus sign shown earlier in the bottom-left 
corner of Figure 5-5) to open the Widget Selection Screen, which displays your 
currently available widgets.
Widget Selection Screen may sound like a mouthful, but its former moniker, 
The Widget Bar, made it sound like some trendy watering hole downtown.
»
» To add a widget from the Widget Selection Screen to your dashboard, 
click the widget on the Widget Selection Screen.
»
» To manage your widgets on the Widget Selection Screen, click the Manage 
Widgets button (the large encircled minus sign visible in the bottom-left 
corner of Figure 5-5), and all your widgets will begin to wiggle on the screen. If 
you have an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, you’ll recognize this wiggling as the 
rearrange-the-icons dance.
»
» To download additional widgets, click the More Widgets (at the bottom of 
the Widget Selection Screen) to launch your web browser and show you 
additional widgets you can download from the Apple website.
»
» To close the Widget Selection Screen, click anywhere on the gray 
background or click the Open button again.
»
» To uninstall a third-party widget that you no longer want, merely open 
the Widget Selection Screen and click the red minus sign next to its name. 
Your Mac politely asks whether you want to move this widget to the Trash. 
You do.
Finally, to close your Dashboard (if you’re not displaying widgets as overlays), 
press the same key you pressed to open the dashboard (F12 or fn+F12), press the 
Esc key, or click the Close Dashboard button (the encircled angle bracket at the 
bottom-right corner of the screen).

CHAPTER 5  Having It Your Way     105
Think of your dashboard widgets as being handy-yet-potent mini-programs 
available at any time with a keystroke or click. Widgets are just so danged cool 
that I want to give you a quick look at a couple I consider particularly useful. Read 
on for details.
Translation
The Translation widget, shown in 
Figure
5-6, could be a lifesaver. 
You’ve been able to do this trick on 
the web for a while, but you can also 
do it right on your dashboard. This 
widget translates words from one 
language to another. It offers more 
than a dozen language choices — 
including French, German, Spanish, 
Russian, Dutch, and Chinese — and 
can translate in either direction. I love 
the Translation widget so much that 
sometimes it hurts.
It’s fun at parties, too. Try this: Type a paragraph or two of your purplest prose 
into Translation. Now translate back and forth to any language a few times. Howl 
when prose written as “It was a dark and stormy night when our heroine met her 
untimely demise” turns into something like “It was one night dark and stormy 
where our heroin met an ugly transfer.” It doesn’t get much better than this, 
folks. Alternatively, you could use iTranslate or Google Translate, both free trans-
lation apps, on your iPhone or iPad.
Flight Tracker
Flight Tracker can find flights on most airlines and report the flight’s status in 
real time — a terrific timesaver when you have to meet a flight.
When you have to meet someone’s flight, this widget can be convenient. Just open 
the dashboard every few minutes, and you know exactly what the flight’s status 
is at that moment.
This is a good tip for harried air travelers: You can open more than one instance 
of a widget. So if you’re trying to track more than one flight, or you want to know 
the weather or time in more than one city, just click the appropriate widget on the 
Widget Selection Screen, and another instance of it appears.
FIGURE 5-6: 
The Translation widget is incredibly useful when 
you travel abroad.

Giving Buttons, Menus, and  
Windows a Makeover
Computers don’t care about appearances, but if you want your Mac to look a bit 
more festive (or, for that matter, businesslike), you have options in the General 
pane (see Figure  5-7) at your disposal. To open this pane, choose  ➪ System 
Preferences, and then click the General icon.
First up are the general appearance options:
»
» Appearance pop-up menu: Use this menu to choose different appearances 
and change the overall look of buttons, such as the three Close, Minimize, and 
Zoom buttons in the top-left corner of most windows.
Apple, however, in its infinite wisdom, provides only two choices: Blue or 
Graphite.
»
» Use Dark Menu Bar and Dock check box: This option will darken your menu 
bar and dock, as shown in Figure 5-7.
»
» Automatically Hide and Show the Menu Bar check box: This option hides 
and displays the menu bar automatically; to make it reappear, move your 
cursor to the top of the screen (just as you would if the app were in full-screen 
mode).
FIGURE 5-7: 
The General 
pane.

CHAPTER 5  Having It Your Way     107
»
» Highlight Color pop-up menu: From here, you can choose the color that text 
is surrounded by when you choose it in a document or select an icon. This 
time, Apple isn’t so restrictive: You have eight highlight colors you can choose, 
plus Other, which brings up a color picker from which you can choose almost 
any color.
I’m partial to yellow, which makes selections look like they’ve been run over by 
a yellow highlighter.
»
» Sidebar Icon Size pop-up menu: Choose Small, Medium, or Large for icons in 
your Finder sidebar.
The next area in the General pane enables you to set the behavior of scroll bars 
and title bars:
»
» Show Scroll Bars radio buttons: These buttons let you choose when you want 
to see scroll bars on windows. Your choices are Automatically Based on Mouse 
or Trackpad, When Scrolling, or Always. I prefer Always; your mileage may vary.
»
» Click in the Scroll Bar To radio buttons: These buttons give you the option 
of moving your view of a window up or down by a page (the default) or to the 
position in the document roughly proportionate to where you clicked in the 
scroll bar. I prefer jumping to the spot that’s clicked.
An easy way to try these options is to open a Finder window and place it side 
by side with the General pane, as shown in Figure 5-8, reducing the size of the 
window if necessary to make scroll bars appear. Select an option, observe  
the behavior of the scroll bars, and then select a different option and observe 
again.
The Jump to the Spot That’s Clicked option is handy for navigating long 
documents. And don’t forget — the Page Down key does the same thing as 
choosing the Jump to the Next Page choice, so you lose nothing by choosing 
Jump to the Spot That’s Clicked.
It would be even nicer if all third-party apps supported this feature, but 
some — including Microsoft Office 2011 (but not Office 2016, which finally 
behaves properly with respect to your scroll bar setting) — don’t behave 
properly no matter what you choose for this setting.
Use the Default Web Browser drop-down menu to choose (what else?) your default 
browser. Unless you’ve installed another web browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, 
Safari will be the only option.

108     PART 2  How Stuff Works
The first two items in the next section are a pair of check boxes:
»
» Ask to Keep Changes when Closing Documents: High Sierra can save 
versions of your documents automatically and without any action on your 
part. So when you quit an application or close a document, your changes can 
be saved automatically. If you want to be able to close documents without 
having to manually save your changes, enable this option.
»
» Close Windows when Quitting an Application: Your Mac’s default behavior 
is to reopen documents and windows that were open when you quit that app. 
When you launch the app again, all the windows and documents magically 
reappear right where you left them. So enable this option to have your apps 
open to a clean slate, without reopening documents or windows from the 
previous session.
These last two items may not work as expected with older third-party applica-
tions. As a rule, the longer it’s been since a program’s last update, the more likely 
it is that the app will ignore these two settings.
The next item in this section of the General pane is Recent Items. It controls the 
number of recent items that are remembered and displayed in your 
  ➪  Recent 
Items submenu. The default is 10, but I like having access to more than 10 appli-
cations and documents in my Recent Items submenu, so I crank mine up to 30, as 
shown in Figure 5-8.
The final area offers a single option for how fonts look: The Use LCD Font Smooth-
ing when Available check box, which makes text look better on most flat-screen 
FIGURE 5-8: 
Here’s how I 
try different 
scroll bar 
settings.

CHAPTER 5  Having It Your Way     109
displays. Unless your monitor is a very old tube-type (CRT) display or you’re a 
photographer or an artist who insists on a CRT for its color accuracy, you probably 
want to select this check box.
Adjusting the Keyboard, Mouse,  
Trackpad, and Other Hardware
No one uses the keyboard, mouse, or trackpad in the same way. Some folks 
don’t use a mouse at all. (You might not even use the keyboard if you use voice- 
recognition software or other devices, as I explain in Chapter 20.) If you’re using 
macOS on a notebook, you have a trackpad, that little surface where you move your 
finger around to control the cursor. Or perhaps you have a Bluetooth-enabled 
keyboard and mouse so you can hook them up wirelessly. Regardless of what you 
have, you should give some thought to customizing the way it works so it feels 
just right for you.
The Keyboard, Mouse, and Trackpad System Preferences panes offer several tabs 
that enable you to modify the behavior of your keyboard, mouse, and track-
pad so  it feels just right for you. The first thing to do is open the Keyboard  
System Preferences pane by choosing   ➪ System Preferences and clicking the 
Keyboard icon.
Keyboard
The Keyboard System Preferences pane has five tabs: Keyboard, Text, Shortcuts, 
Input Sources, and Dictation.
Keyboard tab
On the Keyboard tab, you can adjust your settings in the following ways:
»
» Drag the Key Repeat slider to set how fast a key repeats when you hold it 
down. This feature comes into play when (for example) you hold down the 
hyphen (–) key to make a line or the asterisk (*) key to make a divider.
»
» Drag the Delay Until Repeat slider to set how long you have to hold down a 
key before it starts repeating.

110     PART 2  How Stuff Works
If you have a notebook Mac (such as a MacBook, MacBook Pro, or MacBook Air), 
you also see one or more of these additional features:
»
» Adjust Keyboard Brightness in Low Light: This check box turns your 
laptop’s ambient keyboard lighting on and off.
»
» Turn Keyboard Backlight Off After (Choose 5, 10, or 30 seconds, or 1 or 
5 minutes from the drop-down menu): This option lets you determine how 
long the keyboard backlighting remains on when your computer isn’t in use.
Of course, if your MacBook doesn’t have ambient keyboard lighting, you don’t 
see the last two items.
Ambient keyboard lighting is a cool feature, but it reduces battery life. My 
recommendation is to use it only when you really need it.
»
» Show Keyboard and Emoji Viewers in the Menu Bar: This check box adds a 
new menu for opening either of these useful windows, as shown in Figure 5-9.
Click any character (smiley faces in Figure 5-9) to insert it in your document; 
click the little icons at the bottom of the window to view additional screens full 
of characters.
Some people prefer the look the Character Viewer had prior to Mavericks 
(OS X 10.9). While both looks offer the same old characters you know and 
love, the presentation has changed. Never fear. If you prefer the old look and 
feel, scroll to the top of the window and click the little Character Viewer icon to 
the right of the search field (shown in the margin). This transforms the 
Character Viewer back to its pre-Mavericks look, as shown in Figure 5-10.
To return the window to its other state, just click the little icon again.

Click the Action menu (the little gear near the upper-left corner) and choose 
Customize List to enable additional character categories, including Braille 
Patterns, Dingbats, Musical Symbols, and Sign/Standard Symbols.
»
» Use All F1, F2 Keys as Standard Function Keys: If this check box is selected, 
the F keys at the top of your keyboard control the active software application.
To use the special hardware features printed on each F key (display bright-
ness, screen mirroring, sound volume, mute, and so on), you have to press the 
Fn (Function) key before pressing the F key. If the check box is left deselected, 
you have to press the Fn key if you want to use the F keys with a software 
application. Got it? Good.
Finally, these keys may not work if you use a third-party keyboard (one not 
manufactured by Apple).
»
» Set Up Bluetooth Keyboard button: This button launches the Bluetooth 
assistant and walks you through pairing and setup as described in Chapter 15.
»
» Modifier Keys button: With this button, you can change the action performed 
by the Caps Lock, Control, Option, and Command keys. This option is particu-
larly useful if you use a non-Apple keyboard, although it works just fine on 
Apple keyboards, too.
I’m always engaging the Caps Lock key accidentally with my overactive left pinky, 
so I set my Caps Lock key to perform No Action. Now I never type half a sentence 
in ALL CAPS BECAUSE I ACCIDENTALLY PRESSED THE CAPS LOCK KEY.

Text tab
The Text tab is one of my favorite features in all of Macdom ’cause it saves me 
countless keystrokes every day. Not because it’s the tab with the Correct Spelling 
Automatically check box. Enable it (if it’s not already enabled) and be done. Spell-
ing correction is good, but the reason I love the Text tab so much is because it lets 
me create shortcuts to replace short phrases with longer ones.

It’s a handy trick, indeed. Plus, a preview pops up just below your typing so you 
can accept the replacement by pressing the spacebar or reject it by clicking the 
little X or pressing Esc.
To create your own shortcuts, click the little plus sign near the bottom-left corner 
of the window. Type the short phrase in the Replace field, click in the With field or 
press Tab, and then type the replacement phrase. You can see what happens when 
I type blc in the TextEdit window in the foreground of Figure 5-11.

Although it’s not obvious, you can create multiline substitutions. Just hold down 
Option and press Return to start a new line of text.
Shortcuts tab
If you really hate to use your mouse or if your mouse is broken, keyboard short-
cuts can be handy. I tend to use them more on my laptop because I really don’t 
like using the built-in-touch-mouse thing (technically, it’s a trackpad, and I talk 
more about it in the next section).
I introduce some commonly used keyboard shortcuts in Chapter 2. You probably 
don’t want to mess with those, but you can assign other commands you use often 
to just about any key combination you like. By creating your own keyboard short-
cuts, you can have whatever commands you need literally at your fingertips.
Not only can you add, delete, or change keyboard shortcuts for many operating 
system functions (such as taking a picture of the screen or using the keyboard to 
choose menu and dock items), but you can also add, delete, and change keyboard 
shortcuts for your applications.
To begin, choose the Shortcuts tab in the Keyboard System Preferences pane. Now 
you can do any or all of the following:
»
» To change a shortcut: First, click the appropriate application, preference, or 
feature in the left column. Next, double-click the shortcut you want to change 
on the right side of the right column (for example, F3 or ⌘  +G). The old 
shortcut becomes highlighted; when it does, press the new shortcut keys you 
want to use.
»
» To add a new shortcut: Click the + button. Choose the appropriate applica-
tion from the Application pop-up menu, type the exact name of the menu 
command you want to add in the Menu Title field, and then type the shortcut 
you want to assign to that command in the Keyboard Shortcut field. If the 
shortcut you press is in use by another application or preference, a yellow 
triangular caution symbol appears next to it. It really is that simple.
»
» To delete a shortcut: Choose it and then click the – button.
The Shortcuts tab also offers options for changing the tab order. The Full Key-
board Access radio buttons control what happens when you press the Tab key in 
a window or dialog:
»
» If you choose the Text Boxes and Lists Only radio button, the Tab key moves 
the cursor from one text box to the next or from one list item to the next item 
(usually alphabetically).

114     PART 2  How Stuff Works
»
» If you choose the All Controls radio button, you can avoid using the mouse for 
the most part, if that’s your preference.
When All Controls is selected, the Tab key moves the focus from one item to 
the next in a window or dialog. So (for example) every time you press the Tab 
key in an Open File dialog or sheet, the focus moves — say, from the sidebar 
to the file list to the Cancel button to the icon view button. Each item is 
highlighted to show it’s selected, and you can activate the highlighted item 
from the keyboard by pressing the spacebar.
You can toggle this setting by pressing Control+F7. And if you don’t care for 
Control+F7 as its shortcut, you can change it by clicking Keyboard in the left 
column, double-clicking the Change the Way Tab Moves Focus item in the 
right column, and then pressing the new shortcut.
Input Sources tab
The Input Sources tab is where you can choose to display one or more foreign 
language keyboards in the Input menu.
The Input menu and the Keyboard and Character Viewer menu are one and the 
same. If you add one or more foreign keyboards, the icon in your menu bar 
changes from the rather tame icon shown in Figure 5-10 to the flag of the selected 
keyboard (that’s the Dutch flag in the margin, by the way).
Last but not least, the Dictation tab will be covered in Chapter 20; if you want to 
dictate to your Mac, you might want to read that section sooner rather than later.
Mouse
The Mouse System Preferences pane is where you set your mouse tracking speed, 
scrolling speed, and double-click delays.
If you use a notebook or an Apple Magic Trackpad, you’ll use the System Prefer-
ences pane named Trackpad instead. I tell you more about it in the upcoming 
­section, “Trackpad (notebooks and desktops with a Magic Trackpad).”
The first item in this pane is a check box titled Scroll Direction: Natural. If scroll-
ing or navigating in windows feels backward to you, try deselecting this box.
Moving right along, here are the features you’ll find in the Mouse System Prefer-
ences pane (if you have a mouse connected):

CHAPTER 5  Having It Your Way     115
»
» Move the Tracking Speed slider to change the relationship between hand 
movement of the mouse and cursor movement onscreen. This slider works just 
like the slider for trackpads, as I explain in the upcoming section on trackpads.
»
» The Double-Click Speed setting determines how close together two clicks 
must be for the Mac to interpret them as a double-click and not as two 
separate clicks. Move the slider arrow to the leftmost setting, Very Slow, for 
the slowest. The rightmost position, Fast, is the fastest setting. I prefer the 
setting one tick shy of Fast.
»
» If your mouse has a scroll ball or scroll wheel, you also see a Scrolling Speed 
slider, which lets you adjust how fast the contents of a window scroll when 
you use the scroll wheel or ball.
»
» If your mouse has more than one button, you see a pair of Primary Mouse 
Button radio buttons. These let you choose which button — left or right — you 
use to make your primary (regular) click. Conversely, the other mouse button 
(the one you didn’t choose) becomes your secondary (Control or right) click.
Many lefties like to change this setting. Set the primary button as the right 
button, and you can click with the index finger of your left hand.
Being right-handed, I’ve chosen the defaults in Figure 5-12, so the left button is 
the primary click and the right button is the secondary (right or Control) click.
Changes in the Mouse System Preferences pane take place immediately, so you 
should definitely play around a little and see what settings feel best for you.
Bluetooth
Bluetooth is a technology that lets you make wireless connections between your 
Mac and devices such as Bluetooth mice and phones. Most Macs manufactured in 
the past few years have Bluetooth built in; some older models don’t.
FIGURE 5-12: 
The Mouse 
System

116     PART 2  How Stuff Works
You configure Bluetooth devices you want to use with your Mac elsewhere in the 
Bluetooth System Preferences pane (as I describe in Chapters 15 and 20).
If your Mac has Bluetooth built in, the Bluetooth tab shows you the battery level 
of your Bluetooth mouse or keyboard. It also offers a check box to add a Bluetooth 
status menu to your menu bar and a check box to let Bluetooth devices wake your 
computer from sleep.
Trackpad (notebooks and desktops  
with a Magic Trackpad)
If you use a notebook Mac — a MacBook, MacBook Air, or MacBook Pro — or a 
desktop Mac with a Magic Trackpad 2, you’ll have an additional System Prefer-
ences pane called Trackpad. This pane lets you configure tracking and clicking 
speed as well as the gesturing behavior of your Mac’s built-in trackpad.
If you’re looking for a replacement for your mouse, consider Apple’s $129 Magic 
Trackpad 2. This nifty wireless device can be used with any Mac or PC that has 
Bluetooth. It’s also the biggest glass Multi-Touch trackpad yet, nearly 80 percent 
larger than the MacBook Pro built-in trackpad. Yes, you can use the Magic Track-
pad 2 with your MacBook Pro, and yes, that does mean you’ll have dual trackpads.
I am trying to become more of a trackpad believer and make better use of the 
iPhone-like gestures available on my Mac. I have both a Magic Trackpad and a 
mouse on my desk and grab whichever is appropriate at the moment.
The Trackpad System Preferences pane has three tabs — Point & Click, Scroll & 
Zoom, and More Gestures — as shown in Figure 5-13.
FIGURE 5-13: 
The Trackpad 
System 
Preferences 
pane offers 
controls for 
one-finger and 
multi-finger 
gestures.

CHAPTER 5  Having It Your Way     117
If you have an older notebook with the older-style trackpad, you may not see 
all the controls in Figure 5-13. (For what it’s worth, a Magic Trackpad 2 would 
cure it.)
All three tabs work the same way as the Point & Click tab shown in Figure 5-13.  
To enable or disable a feature, select its check box. To see how a feature works, 
just move your cursor over it (you don’t even have to click), and a movie demon-
strates that gesture on the right side of the window. In Figure 5-13, I’m pointing 
to the Secondary Click feature on the left; how it works is demonstrated in the 
movie playing on the right. Pretty cool, don’t you think?
You need to know a couple of other things about the Trackpad System Preferences 
pane before you move on:
»
» If you see a little v to the right of a feature’s description (Click with Two Fingers 
in Figure 5-13), a drop-down menu is available; click near the v to display the 
options for that feature.
»
» The Tracking Speed slider lets you change the relationship between finger 
movement on the trackpad and cursor movement onscreen. A faster tracking-
speed setting (moving the slider to the right) sends your cursor flying across 
the screen with a mere flick of the finger; slower tracking-speed settings 
(moving the slider to the left) make the cursor crawl across in seemingly slow 
motion, even when your finger is flying. Set this setting as fast as you can 
stand it — I like the fastest speed. Try it: You might like it.
Styling Your Sound
Out of the box, macOS High Sierra comes with a preset collection of beeps and 
controls. From the Sound System Preferences pane, however, you can change the 
way your Mac plays and records sound by changing settings on each of its three 
tabs: Sound Effects, Output, and Input.
Three items appear at the bottom of the Sound Effects pane, no matter which of 
the three tabs is active:
»
» To make your Mac’s volume louder or softer, use the Output Volume slider. 
You can also change or mute the volume with the designated volume and 
mute keys found on most Apple keyboards.
»
» Select the Mute check box to turn off all sound.

118     PART 2  How Stuff Works
»
» Select the Show Volume in Menu Bar check box to add a volume control menu 
to your menu bar.
A shortcut to the Sound System Preferences pane is to press Option while pressing 
any of the volume keys (usually the F11 and F12 keys on newer laptops and key-
boards and F4 and F5 keys on older ones).
Changing sound effects
On the Sound Effects tab, choose an alert (beep) sound by clicking its name; set its 
volume by using the Alert Volume slider control.
You can also specify the output device through which sound effects play (if you 
have more than one device) by choosing it from the Play Sound Effects Through 
pop-up menu.
The Play User Interface Sound Effects check box turns on sound effects for actions, 
such as dragging a file to the Trash. The Play Feedback when Volume Is Changed 
check box tells your Mac to beep once for each key press to increase or decrease 
volume.
Choosing output and input options
If you have more than one sound-output device (in addition to the built-in  
speakers), you can choose it on the Outputs tab. The Balance slider makes one 
stereo speaker — left or right — louder than the other.
If you have more than one sound-input device (in addition to the built-in micro-
phone on many Macs or an iSight camera, which contains its own mic), you can 
choose it on the Inputs tab. The Input Volume slider controls the Input Level (how 
loud input from that device will be), which is displayed as a row of blue dots. If the 
dots light up all the way to the right side, your input volume is too loud. Ideally, 
the input level should light up with about three-fourths of the little blue dots — 
and no more.
Some input sources (microphones) don’t let you adjust their level in the Sound 
System Preferences pane.

The Care and Feeding 
of Files and Folders
T
his could be the most important chapter in this book. If you don’t under-
stand how to open and save files by using the Open dialog and Save sheets 
or how to use the file and folder system, you’ll have a heck of a time getting 
the hang of your Mac.
A sheet is nothing more than a dialog that is attached to a document window’s title 
bar and can’t be moved. Some apps use sheets, other apps use dialogs, but either 
way you’ll see the same options.
This chapter is a tonic for finding the file or folder you want. Knowing where your 
files are is something every Mac user should grok (fully understand). Hang with 
me and pay attention; everything will soon become crystal clear.
Later in the chapter, I look at using Open dialogs and Save sheets within applica-
tions to find files and folders. You see them only after you launch a program and 
use that program’s File menu to open or save a file. (For more on launching appli-
cations, read the parts of Chapter 4 about icons; for more on creating and opening 
documents, see the documentation or Help file for the program you’re using.)

A Quick Primer on Finding Files
Before we even look at organizing your files, let’s look at the problem organizing 
files and folders can solve. Ask any longtime Mac user; the old lament is common: 
“Well, I saved the file, but I don’t know where I saved it.” It happens all the time 
with new users (and occasionally with long-time users like my wife). If they don’t 
master these essential techniques, they often become confused about where files 
are located on their hard drives. Sure, the sidebar has an item called All My Files 
that displays all your files, and Spotlight can find files in milliseconds — but if 
you have thousands or tens of thousands of files, both can be more of a curse than 
a blessing.
All My Files (in the sidebar of Finder windows) is a fast and easy way to find a file 
or folder (although the sheer number of files it displays may overwhelm you, no 
matter how you sort or arrange them).
All My Files is especially handy when you know you either created or worked on 
the file recently. Just use List view sorted or arranged by Date Last Opened, and 
the most recently used files will be at or near the top of the list.
And Chapter 8 is chock-full of tools and tips for finding files and folders when you 
misplace them. Furthermore, although you can often find files or folders by using 
Spotlight, you have to remember enough details about the file or its contents for 
Spotlight to find it.
At the end of the day, all the aforementioned techniques are useful and good to 
know, but take it from me: It’s often faster and easier if you know exactly where 
a file or folder is than to hunt for it.
Spotlight (covered in Chapter 8) is macOS’s built-in search mechanism. It’s avail-
able just about everywhere you look in High Sierra: The magnifying glass on the 
menu bar, the toolbar of Finder windows, and Open dialogs and Save sheets. The 
point is, if you can’t find a file or folder manually as described in the rest of this 
chapter, try Spotlight.
Understanding the macOS 
Folder Structure
Start by looking at the folder structure of a typical macOS installation. Open a Finder 
window and click the icon for your hard drive (typically called Macintosh HD)  

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     121
in the sidebar. You should now see at least four folders: Applications, Library, 
System, and Users. In the Users folder, each user with an account on this Mac (see 
Chapter 15 for the skinny on users and accounts) has his or her own set of folders 
containing documents, preferences, and other information that belongs to that 
user and account.
If you’re the sole person who accesses your Mac, you probably have only one user. 
Regardless, the folder structure that macOS uses is the same whether you have 
one user or dozens.
In the Users folder, you find your 
personal Home folder (which bears 
your account name), along with a 
Shared folder, where you can put files 
you want to share with other users. 
All these files are stored in a nested 
folder structure that’s a bit tricky to 
understand at first. This structure 
makes more sense after you spend a 
little time with it and figure out some 
basic concepts.
If you display the path bar (at the 
bottom of your windows; choose 
View ➪ Show Path Bar), it’ll start to 
make sense much sooner.
Take a look at Figure 6-1; you can see 
how these main folders are related to 
one another. In the sections that fol-
low, you look at each of these fold-
ers in more depth and find out more 
about what’s nested inside each one.
Understanding nested folders
Folders within other folders are often called nested folders. To get a feel for the 
way nested folders work in macOS, check out the example of nested folders on my 
desktop in Figure 6-2.
FIGURE 6-1: 
A bird’s-eye view of key folders on your Mac.

122     PART 2  How Stuff Works
You can see the following in Figure 6-2:
»
» The Desktop is the top-level folder in this example; all other folders and files 
you see reside in the Desktop folder.
»
» Folder 1 is inside the Desktop folder, which is one level deep.
»
» Folder 2 is inside Folder 1, which is one level deeper than Folder 1, or two 
levels deep.
»
» Folder 3 is inside Folder 2 and is three levels deep.
»
» The two files inside Folder 3 are four levels deep.
If the preceding list makes sense to you, you’re golden. What’s important here is 
that you can visualize the path to Folder 3. That is, to get to files inside Folder 3, 
you open Folder 1 and then open Folder 2 to be able to open Folder 3. Understand-
ing this concept is important to understanding the relationships between files and 
folders. Keep reviewing this section, and eventually, the concept will click. You’ll 
slap yourself in the head and say, “Now I get it!”

going four 
levels deep.

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     123
From the top: The Computer folder
I start with the Computer folder, which is the top level of the folder hierarchy. 
The Computer folder shows all the storage devices (hard drives, CD- or DVD-
ROM, USB flash drive, and so forth) connected to your Mac. The following steps 
show how you can start at the Computer folder and drill down through the folder 
structure:
1.	 Choose Go ➪ Computer or press Shift+⌘  +C.
Now you’re at the Computer folder. In Figure 6-1, the Computer folder is 
called High Sierra MacBook Air (look in the title bar), and it contains a solid-
state Drive icon (High Sierra SSD), a Network icon, from which you can access 
servers or other computers on your local network, and a Remote Disc icon 
(because DVD or CD Sharing is enabled in the Sharing System Preferences 
pane on my other Mac).
If that seems mysterious, read Chapter 15 for the scoop on sharing files (and 
more) with other users.
You might have more or fewer icons in your Computer folder than you see in 
Figure 6-1, depending on how many disks you have mounted.
You might also find a Computer icon in your sidebar. If not and you’d like to 
have Computer in your sidebar, choose Finder ➪ Preferences, click the Sidebar 
tab at the top, and then select the check box for your computer.
You can change a Mac’s name (High Sierra MacBook Air in Figure 6-1) by 
opening the Sharing System Preferences pane (see Chapter 15) and changing 
the computer’s name in the Computer Name field.
2.	 Double-click the icon for the drive that holds your macOS stuff.
Technically, this drive is called your boot drive. In Figure 6-1, that drive is called 
High Sierra SSD. I have no idea what yours is called, of course; if you haven’t 
changed it, it’s probably called Macintosh HD.
3.	 Check out the folders you find there.
You should see at least four folders, unless you’ve added some. (If you installed 
the Xcode programming tools, for example, you have more.) In the next few 
sections, I walk you through what you can find in each one.
Peeking into the Applications folder
You can access the Applications folder, located at the root level of your boot drive 
(the one with macOS installed on it), by clicking the Applications icon in the side-
bar, by choosing it in the Go menu, or by pressing Shift+⌘  +A. In this folder, you 

124     PART 2  How Stuff Works
find applications and utilities that Apple includes with macOS. Most users of a 
Mac have access to all the items in the Applications folder, with the exception of 
managed accounts or accounts with Parental Controls, as discussed in Chapter 15.
Visiting the Library folders
The Library folder, at the root level of your macOS hard drive, is like a public 
library; it stores items available to everyone who logs into any account on this Mac.
There are actually three or more Library folders on your hard drive:
»
» At the root level of your macOS disk
»
» In the root-level System folder
»
» One in each user’s Home folder
In High Sierra, your Home/Library folder is hidden from view to protect you from 
yourself. Never fear: You’ll discover the secret to making it visible if you need it in 
the “Your personal Library card” section later in this chapter.
Now, here’s the scoop on your various Library folders:
»
» Public Library: You find a bunch of folders inside the Library folder at the 
root level (the public Library folder). Most of them contain files that you never 
need to open, move, or delete.
By and large, the public Library subfolder that gets the most use is the Fonts 
folder, which houses many of the fonts installed on the Mac.
»
» System Library: This is the nerve center of your Mac. In other words, you 
should never have to touch this particular Library folder.
Leave the /System/Library folder alone. Don’t move, remove, or rename it, or 
do anything within it.
»
» Library in each user’s Home folder: This is where macOS stores configura-
tion and preferences files for each user account.
The location of each of these libraries is illustrated in Figure 6-3.
If your Mac is set up for multiple users, only users with administrator (admin) 
privileges can put stuff in the public (root-level) Library folder. (For more infor-
mation on admin privileges, check out Chapter 15.)

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     125
Let it be: The System folder
The System folder contains the files that macOS needs to start up and keep 
working.
Leave the System folder alone. Don’t move, remove, or rename it or anything 
within it. It’s part of the nerve center of your Mac.
So now you can forget everything outside your Home folder because with few 
exceptions, that’s where all your stuff will reside.
There’s no place like Home
Your Home folder is inside the Users folder. When the user logs on to this Mac, the 
contents of her Home folder appear whenever she chooses Go ➪ Home, or uses the 
keyboard shortcut Shift+⌘  +H.
FIGURE 6-3: 
A guide to 
which Library 
folder is which.

126     PART 2  How Stuff Works
Your Home folder is the most important folder for you as a user — or at least the 
one where you stash most of your files. I strongly recommend that you store all 
the files you create in subfolders within your Home folder — preferably, in sub-
folders in your Home/Documents folder. The advantage of doing so is that your 
Home/Documents folder is easy to find, and many programs use it as the default 
folder for opening or saving a file.
When you open your Home folder, you see a Finder window with a little house icon 
and your short username in the title bar. Seeing your short username in the title 
bar tells you that you’re in your Home folder. Every user has a Home folder named 
after his or her short username (as specified in the Users & Groups System Prefer-
ences pane). If you refer to Figure 6-1, you’ll see that my Home folder contains 
seven subfolders  — Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Movies, Music, Pictures, 
and Public — and that my Home folder is named hsbob — the short name I used 
when I first set up my Mac.
If your Mac has more than one user, you can see their Home folders in the Users 
folder (for example, standard in Figure 6-1), but macOS prevents you from open-
ing files from or saving files to other users’ Home folders.
By default, your Home folder has several folders inside it created by macOS. The 
following four are the most important:
»
» Desktop: If you put items (files, folders, applications, or aliases) on the 
desktop, they’re actually stored in the Desktop folder.
»
» Documents: This is the place to put all the documents (letters, spreadsheets, 
recipes, and novels) that you create.
»
» Library: As I mention earlier in this chapter, this Library folder is invisible in 
macOS High Sierra; I show you how to deal with that shortly. Rest assured that 
even though it’s hidden, it’s still one of the most important folders in your 
Home folder, containing Preferences (files containing the settings you create 
in System Preferences and individual applications’ preferences), fonts 
available only to you (as described earlier in this chapter), and other stuff that 
you — and only you — expect to use.
»
» Public: If others on your local area network (LAN) use file sharing to connect 
with your Mac, they can’t see or use the files or folders in your Home folder 
(unless you explicitly share them), but they can share files you store in your 
Home folder’s Public folder. (Read more about file sharing and Public folders 
in Chapter 15.)

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     127
You can create more folders, if you like. In fact, every folder that you ever create 
(at least every one you create on this particular hard drive or volume) should be 
within your Home folder. I explain more about creating folders and subfolders and 
organizing your stuff inside them later in this chapter.
The following are a few more tidbits to keep in mind as you dig around your Home 
folder:
»
» If you decide that you don’t want an item on the desktop anymore, delete it by 
dragging its icon from the Desktop folder to the Trash or by dragging its icon 
from the desktop itself to the Trash. Both techniques yield the same effect: 
The file is in the Trash, where it remains until you empty the Trash. Or if you 
don’t want it on the desktop anymore but don’t want to get rid of it either, you 
can drag it from the desktop into any other folder you like.
»
» The other four folders that you should see in your Home folder are 
Downloads, Movies, Music, and Pictures. All these folders are empty until you 
(or a program such as iTunes, GarageBand, Photos, or iMovie, which create 
files inside these folders automatically the first time you launch them) put 
something in them.
Your personal library card
The invisible Library subfolder of your Home folder is the repository of everything 
that macOS needs to customize your Mac to your tastes. If you want to add some-
thing to a Library folder, it’s usually best to add it to your Home/Library folder. 
You won’t spend much time (if any) adding things to the Library folder or moving 
them around within it, and that’s probably why it’s now hidden from sight. Still,  
I think it’s a good idea for you to know what’s in your Home/Library.
Earlier in this chapter I mention the public Library folder (refer to Figure 6-3), 
which is used to specify preferences for all users on this Mac. This Library folder, 
however, is all about you and your stuff.
Be cautious with all Library folders. macOS is persnickety about how the folders 
and files within it are organized. As I discuss earlier in the chapter, you can safely 
add items to and remove items from most public or Home/Library folders, but 
leave the folders themselves alone. If you remove or rename the wrong folder, you 
could render macOS inoperable. It’s like the old joke about the guy who said to the 
doctor, “It hurts when I do that,” and the doctor replies, “Then don’t do that.”

128     PART 2  How Stuff Works
To find your hidden Home/Library folder, do this:
1.	 Hold down the Option key on your keyboard and click the Go menu.
The (formerly) invisible Library folder appears in the Go menu as long as the 
Option key is pressed.
2.	 Select Library and release the mouse button.
You should see several folders in the Home/Library folder; the exact number 
depends on the software that you install on your Mac. You probably have folders 
called Mail, Safari, Logs, and Preferences, for example.
If you don’t want to do this dance every time you open your Home/Library folder, 
select your Home folder in Finder and choose View ➪ Show View Options (or press 
⌘  +J). Enable the Show Library Folder check box and your Home Library will be 
visible evermore (or at least until you deselect the check box).
Some of the most important standard folders in the Library folder include the 
following:
»
» Application Support: Some applications store their support files here; others 
store theirs in the main (root-level) public Library folder.
»
» Fonts: This folder is empty until you install your own fonts here. The easiest 
way to install a font is to double-click its icon and let the Font Book utility 
handle it for you, as described in Chapter 18. But I’d be remiss if I didn’t also 
mention how to install a font manually:
•	 To install a font that only you can use: Drag the font file’s icon to the Fonts 
folder in your Home/Library. The font is available only to this user account 
(because other users can’t use fonts stored in your Home/Library folder).
•	 To install a font for all users of this Mac: Drag the font file’s icon into the 
Fonts folder in the public Library folder — the one at root level that you see 
when you open your hard drive’s icon.
It might not be a great idea to add too many fonts for all users because the 
Fonts menu will become long and unwieldy.
»
» Preferences: The files here hold the information about whichever things you 
customize in macOS or in the applications you run. Whenever you change a 
system or application preference, that info is saved to a file in the Preferences 
folder.
Don’t mess with the Preferences folder! You should never need to open or use 
this folder unless something bad happens — say, you suspect that a particular 
preferences file has become corrupted (that is, damaged). My advice is to just 
forget that you know about this folder and let it do its job. If you don’t know why 

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     129
you’re doing something to a folder (other than the Fonts folder) in your Home/
Library, don’t do it. There must be some good reasons why Apple decided to 
hide the Home/Library folder in macOS High Sierra, and I’m sure that one of 
them is to keep you (or me) from accidentally screwing something up.
Saving Your Document Before It’s Too Late
If you have a feel for the macOS folder structure, you can get down to the impor-
tant stuff — namely, how to save documents and where to save them. You can 
create as many documents as you want, using one program or dozens of ’em, but 
all could be lost if you don’t save the files (or versions of the files) to a storage 
device such as your startup drive, external hard drive, USB thumb drive (a.k.a. USB 
flash drive), or solid-state drive (SSD). Another option is to save documents in 
iCloud, so they’re available on all your Apple devices all the time without syncing 
or doing much of anything beyond saving the file.
When you save a file, you’re committing a copy to a drive, whether it’s a drive con-
nected directly to your Mac, one available over a local area network, a ­removable 
disc such as a USB thumb drive or portable hard or solid-state drive, or even a 
drive on a cloud-based server somewhere else, such as iCloud.
Speaking of iCloud, you’ll be hearing a lot more about it — and especially the 
iCloud Drive feature — later in this chapter after you get the hang of saving and 
opening files from drives or discs.
macOS’s Resume feature automatically reopens all windows that were onscreen 
when you quit the app. So, when you launch the app again, all the windows are 
reopened in the same position onscreen as when you quit. Best of all, Resume 
seems to work with most (but not all) third-party apps.
Individual programs have offered Auto Save before, but it’s baked into macOS. Auto 
Save automatically saves versions (which you learn more about shortly) of your 
work as you work, when you pause, and every five minutes, whether you need it 
or not.
Versions are awesome. Every time you Save or Auto Save, a new version of the 
document is created. For as long as we’ve had Macs, we’ve saved unique versions 
of our files, creating and managing them with the Save As command or by dupli-
cating and renaming them in Finder. Now macOS takes over version control for 
you by automatically saving versions, as described in the preceding paragraph.

130     PART 2  How Stuff Works
The big advantage is that rather than ending up with a separate file on your 
hard drive each time you Save As or duplicate and rename a file, Versions saves 
them all in the same document icon. To access a previous version, select Choose 
File ➪ Revert To ➪ Browse All Versions or choose Enter Time Machine from the 
Time Machine icon on the menu bar while the document is active onscreen. (See 
Chapter 21 for more on Time Machine.)
That’s the good news, but there’s also bad news. Although Auto Save and Versions 
are built right into macOS, third-party apps require a software update before they 
can take advantage of these features. So please don’t get too comfortable with 
Auto Save and Versions until you’re sure that your applications take advantage of 
these features. Even six or seven years after the debut of these features in macOS, 
many third-party apps still rely on the old-school Save and Save As commands for 
versioning. And, if these features aren’t in a third-party app by now, I wouldn’t 
hold my breath waiting for their appearance.
The bottom line is that if the app you’re using doesn’t have Auto Save and ­Versions, 
macOS takes no responsibility for saving files and saving versions of files; it’s all 
up to you.
In the following sections, I show you how to save your masterpieces. Prevent 
unnecessary pain in your life by developing good saving habits. I recommend that 
you save your work (or save a version in apps that support versions)
»
» Every few minutes
»
» Before you switch to another program
»
» Before you print a document
»
» Before you stand up
The keyboard shortcut for Save in almost every Mac program is ⌘  +S, and it works 
with Auto Save and Versions as well as with Save and Save As. Memorize it. See it 
in your dreams. Train your finger muscles to do it unconsciously. Use it (the key-
board shortcut) or lose it (your unsaved work).
If you don’t heed this advice  — and then the program you’re using crashes 
while switching programs, printing, or sitting idle (the three likeliest times for 
a crash) — you may lose everything you did since your last save or saved ver-
sion. The fact that a program crash doesn’t bring down the entire system or force 
a restart is small consolation when you’ve lost everything you’ve typed, drawn, 
copied, pasted, or whatever since the last time you saved or saved a version.

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     131
Stepping through a basic save
This section walks you through the steps you use the first time you save a docu-
ment. The process is the same whether your app supports Auto Save and Versions 
or not. It’s only after the initial save that Auto Save and Versions come into play.
DOES IT HAVE AUTO SAVE  
AND VERSIONS OR NOT?
It can be hard to discern at a glance whether an app uses the Auto Save and Versions 
features introduced with OS X Lion.
The first way to discern if an app supports Auto Save and Versions is whether the app 
has a Save As or Duplicate command in its File menu. Programs with a Save As com-
mand are old-school and don’t support the new Auto Save and Versions features. 
Programs with a Duplicate command have usually been updated with support for Auto 
Save and Versions. (Interestingly, the shortcut for Duplicate and Save As is almost always 
the same: ⌘  +Shift+S.)
The next way is to discern whether the app has Rename and Move To commands in its 
File menu. If it doesn’t, it’s old-school; if it does, it’s Auto Save- and Versions-savvy.
The easiest way to tell, however, is to look at the title bar of a document. If it displays 
a little V to the right of the document’s name when you hover your cursor over it (as 
shown on top of the figure here) and a pop-up window appears if you click the triangle 
(as shown on the bottom of the figure), the app supports Auto Save and Versions. (You 
read more about the options in the pop-up window later in this chapter.)
One last thing: Everything I’ve said so far in this chapter applies to every app that saves 
files, with or without Auto Save and Versions. But I’d be remiss if I didn’t reiterate that 
saving a file with Auto Save and Versions has one additional effect: It creates a new ver-
sion of the file that you can access with Time Machine. To obtain that kind of functional-
ity in apps without Auto Save and Versions, you’ll need to use Save As to create a new 
version of the file periodically.

132     PART 2  How Stuff Works
In a few sections of this book, I ask you not only to read the instructions while 
sitting in front of your Mac but also to perform each step of the instructions as 
described. This section is one of them. If you read it and follow along, I can pretty 
much guarantee that it’ll make sense. If you read it somewhere other than at your 
Mac, it could be a mite confusing.
Saving a file works pretty much the same way in any application you use to cre-
ate documents. For this example, I use the macOS word-processing application, 
TextEdit, but the process will be similar in Microsoft Word, Adobe Photoshop, 
Apple Keynote, or any other application.
If you’re going to follow along as I recommend, please launch the TextEdit pro-
gram now (it’s in your Applications folder), click the New Document button or 
choose File ➪ New, and type a few words on the Untitled page that appears after 
you launch it.
Now that we’re both on the same page (literally and figuratively), here’s how 
saving a file works. When you choose to save a file for the first time (choose 
File ➪ Save or press ⌘  +S), a Save sheet appears in front of the document that 
you’re saving, as shown in Figure 6-4. I call this a basic Save sheet (as opposed to 
an expanded Save sheet, which I get to in a moment):
1.	 In the Save As field, type a name for your file.
When a Save sheet appears for the first time, the Save As field is active and 
displays the name of the document. The document name (usually Untitled) is 
selected; when you begin typing, the name disappears and is replaced by the 
name you type.
FIGURE 6-4: 
A basic Save 
sheet looks a 
lot like this.

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     133
2.	 If the Where pop-up menu lists the location where you want to save your 
file, choose that location and proceed to Step 5. If not, click the disclosure 
button (labeled in Figure 6-4).
You can choose from a short list of folders and volumes listed in the basic Save 
sheet’s Where pop-up menu (which are the same devices and favorites you see 
in the sidebar of Finder windows). Or, if you click the disclosure button on the 
right of the Save As field, the sheet expands so that you can navigate folders 
just as you do in Finder: by opening them to see their contents.
If you click the Save button shown on the left in Figure 6-4, your file will be 
saved to iCloud Drive, Apple’s free online storage service (which you discover 
later in this chapter). Or you can choose another location from the Where 
menu, as shown on the right in Figure 6-4.
If you switch to expanded view by clicking the disclosure button, a standard 
Save sheet appears so you can save your file in any folder you like.
Note that the Where menu in the expanded Save sheet on the right in 
Figure 6-5 doesn’t have Favorites, but instead displays the path to the folder 
the file will be saved in (Documents). I think that the Where menu should be 
the same in both basic and expanded Save sheets, as it was before macOS 10.5 
Leopard. It seems more confusing to have the contents of this menu change 
based on whether the Save sheet is expanded or not. I’ve called it to your 
attention so it won’t confuse you.
For what it’s worth, Favorites are still available in an expanded Save sheet, but 
instead of being in the Where menu, they’re in the sidebar.
Switch between the basic and expanded Save sheets a few times by clicking 
the disclosure button. Make sure that you see and understand the difference 
between what you see in the Where menu in a basic Save sheet and what you 
see in the Where menu in an expanded Save sheet. All the steps that follow 
assume you’re using the expanded Save sheet.

134     PART 2  How Stuff Works
3.	 To make it easier to find the folder you want to save your file into, choose 
among views by clicking the Icon, List, or Column view button.
The buttons look like their counterparts in Finder windows. In Icon view, you 
double-click a folder to open it. List view offers disclosure triangles for folders 
and drives, so single-click the disclosure triangles of folders to see their 
contents. In Column view, you click an item on the left to see its contents on 
the right, just as you do in a column-view Finder window.
You can also use the Forward and Back buttons or the sidebar, both available 
only in an expanded Save dialog, to conveniently navigate your drive. Many of 
these navigation aids work just like the ones in Finder; see Chapter 4 for more 
details. You can enlarge the Save sheet to see more the same way you enlarge 
a Finder window: Drag an edge or corner of the sheet.
If you can’t find the folder in which you want to save your document, type the 
folder name in the search box. It works just like the search box in a Finder 
window, as described in Chapters 4 and 8. You don’t even have to press 
Return; the Save sheet updates itself to show you only items that match the 
characters as you typed them.
4.	 Select the folder where you want to save your file in the Where pop-up 
menu or the sidebar.
5.	 If you want to create a new subfolder of the selected folder to save your 
file in, click the New Folder button, give the new folder a name, and then 
save your file in it.
In Figure 6-6, I selected an existing folder named Novels. You can tell that it’s 
selected because its name is displayed in the Where menu and highlighted 
below that in the first column.
The selected folder is where your file will be saved.
The keyboard shortcut for New Folder is Shift+⌘  +N, regardless of whether 
you’re in a Save sheet or Finder. If I want to create a folder inside the Novels 
folder in Figure 6-6, I could click the New Folder button or press the shortcut.
6.	 In the File Format pop-up menu (hidden in Figure 6-4), make sure the 
format selected is the one you want.
If you want to turn off the display of file extensions (such as .rtf, .pdf, and .txt) 
in Save sheets, select the Hide Extension check box. Note that this option isn’t 
available in the Basic save sheet; it’s available only when the Save sheet is 
expanded.
Double-check the Where pop-up menu one last time to make sure that the 
correct folder is selected.

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     135
7.	 Click the Save button to save the file to the active folder.
If you click Save, the file appears in the folder you selected. If you change your 
mind about saving this file, clicking Cancel dismisses the Save sheet without 
saving anything anywhere. In other words, the Cancel button returns things to 
the way they were before you displayed the Save sheet.
After you save a file for the first time, choosing File  ➪  Save or pressing ⌘  +S won’t 
bring up a Save sheet. Instead, what happens next depends on whether the app 
supports macOS’s Auto Save and Versions. If the app doesn’t support Auto Save 
and Versions, Save and its shortcut (⌘  +S) merely resave your document in the 
same location and with the same name. If you want to save a unique version with 
a different name, you have to choose the Save As command and save the file under 
a new name.
If the app does support Auto Save and Versions, however, the upcoming section, 
“Save As versus Duplicate: Different names for the same result,” explains how 
things work.
When you use apps that don’t support Auto Save and Versions, I beg you to get 
into the habit of pressing ⌘  +S often. It can’t hurt — and just might save your 
bacon someday.
One last thing: In Figures 6-4, 6-5, and 6-6, I used the Save sheet for TextEdit  
as an example. In programs other than TextEdit, the Save sheet might contain 
additional options, fewer options, or different options, and therefore might look 
slightly different. The File Format menu, for example, is a feature specific to 
TextEdit; it might not appear in other applications’ Save sheets. Don’t worry. The 
Save sheet always works the same way, no matter what options it offers.

136     PART 2  How Stuff Works
Save As versus Duplicate: Different names 
for the same result
The two commands File ➪ Duplicate and File ➪ Save As serve the same purpose 
and achieve the same result. The difference is that you’ll find File ➪ Duplicate in 
apps that support Versions and Auto Save, and File ➪ Save As in apps that don’t. 
They’re different names for achieving the same result: saving a file that’s already 
been saved with a different name.
Before I get into the details, you may be wondering why you would want to save an 
existing file with a different name. So here’s a good (albeit kind of rude) example: 
Suppose that you have two cousins, Kate and Nancy. You write Kate a long, chatty 
letter and save this document with the name Letter to Kate. Later, you decide that 
you want to send almost the same letter to Nancy, but you want to change a few 
things. So you change the part about your date last night and replace all references 
to Kate’s husband, Kevin, with references to Nancy’s husband, Norman. (Aren’t 
computers grand?)
So you make all these changes in Letter to Kate, but you haven’t resaved this 
document yet — and although the document on your screen is actually a letter 
to Nancy, its filename is still Letter to Kate. Think of what would happen if you 
were to save it now without using the Save As feature: Letter to Kate reflects the 
changes that you just made. (The stuff in the letter meant for Kate is blown away, 
replaced by the stuff that you just wrote to Nancy.) Thus the filename Letter to 
Kate is inaccurate. Even worse, you no longer have a copy of the original letter you 
sent to Kate! The solution? Just use Save As or Duplicate to rename this file Letter 
to Nancy by choosing File ➪ Save As or File ➪ Duplicate.
If you opt for Save As: A Save sheet appears, in which you can type a different file-
name in the Save As field. You can also navigate to another folder, if you like, and 
save the newly named version of the file there. Now you have two distinct files: 
Letter to Kate and Letter to Nancy. Both contain the stuff they should, but both 
started life from the same file.
If you choose Duplicate: The title bar of the document becomes editable so you 
can change its name without even seeing a Save sheet. (Refer to the figure in the 
earlier sidebar, “Does it have Auto Save and Versions or not?”) By default it has 
the same name as the original with the word copy appended. Change its name or 
don’t, and then press Return, and the duplicated file will be saved in the same 
folder as the original. Or, if you want to save the newly renamed file in a different 
location, choose File ➪ Move To or click the little V to the right of the document’s 
name, and select a different location in the Where menu.

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     137
Now that you understand what Save As or Duplicate are all about, here’s an easier 
way to get the same result: Before you start, duplicate the document in Finder 
(choose File ➪ Duplicate or press ⌘  +D). Rename the copy and open it. This way, 
when you have finished making changes, you don’t have to remember to choose 
Save As; you can just perform your habitual Save. This approach also protects you 
from accidentally saving part of the letter to Nancy without changing the file’s 
name first (which you’re likely to do if you’re following my advice about saving 
often). So when you decide that you’re going to reuse a document, choose Save As 
(or duplicate and rename the file) before you begin working on it, just to be safe.
For those who, like yours truly, prefer to use Save As, just press the Option key 
before you click the File menu and Duplicate magically transmogrifies into Save 
As. Sweet!
Versions gives you the benefits of Save As without any action on your part, but 
many programs still lack support for Auto Save and Versions as of this writing. 
And, in fact, some Apple apps, as well as most third-party apps, still use the 
Save As technique, and I expect that to be the status quo for quite some time. But 
because most of Apple’s offerings (TextEdit, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, and more) 
use Auto Save and Versions, I’d be remiss if I glossed over Apple’s newer way of 
doing things.
One last thing: If the app you’re using supports Versions, it creates a snapshot 
called a version automatically as you work, when you pause, every five minutes, 
and every time you choose File ➪ Save (⌘  +S). Choose File ➪ Revert To ➪ Browse 
All Versions or click the Time Machine icon in the dock while the document is 
active onscreen. (See Chapter 21 for more on Time Machine.) Either way, Time 
Machine displays versions of the document side-by-side, as shown in Figure 6-7.
Just so you know, Figure 6-7 is the Time Machine backup utility displaying the 
various versions.

138     PART 2  How Stuff Works
Open, Sez Me
You can open any icon in Finder — whether it’s a file or a folder — in at least 
six ways. (Okay, there are at least seven ways, but one of them belongs to aliases, 
which I discuss in great detail back in Chapter 4.) Anyway, here are the ways:
»
» Click the icon once to select it and choose File  ➪ Open.
»
» Double-click the icon.
If the icon doesn’t open, you double-clicked too slowly. You can test (and 
adjust) your mouse’s sensitivity to double-click speed in the Mouse (or 
Trackpad) System Preferences pane, which you can access by launching the 
System Preferences application (from the Applications folder, the dock, or 
the   menu) and then clicking the Mouse (or Trackpad) icon.
»
» Select the icon and then press either ⌘  +O or ⌘  +↓.
»
» Right-click or Control-click it and then choose Open from the contextual menu.
»
» If the icon is a document, drag it onto the application icon (or the dock icon of 
an application) that can open that type of document.
»
» If the icon is a document, right-click or Control-click it and choose an applica-
tion from the Open With submenu of the contextual menu.
You can also open any document icon from within an application, of course. Here’s 
how that works:
1.	 Just launch your favorite program, and choose File ➪ Open (or press ⌘  +O, 
which works in most Mac programs).
An Open dialog appears, like the one shown in Figure 6-8.
FIGURE 6-8: 
The Open 
dialog using 
Column view.

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     139
When you use a program’s Open dialog, only files that the program knows how 
to open appear enabled (in black rather than light gray) in the file list. In effect, 
the program filters out the files it can’t open, so you barely see them in the 
Open dialog. This method of selectively displaying certain items in Open 
dialogs is a feature of most applications. Therefore, when you’re using TextEdit, 
its Open dialog dims all files it can’t open, like the iBooks Author application in 
the Novels folder in Figure 6-8. Pretty neat, eh?
For what it’s worth, TextEdit can open text, Rich Text Format, Microsoft Word, 
Microsoft Excel, and some picture files.
2.	 In the dialog, simply navigate to the file you want to open (using the 
same techniques you use in a Save sheet).
Click a favorite folder in the sidebar or use Spotlight (see Chapter 8) if you can’t 
remember where the file resides.
3.	 Select your file and click the Open button.
For what it’s worth, some applications allow you to select multiple files in their 
Open dialogs by holding down either Shift (for contiguous selections) or ⌘   (for 
noncontiguous selections). If you need to open several files, it’s worth a try; the 
worst thing that could happen is that it won’t work and you’ll have to open the 
items one at a time.
Some programs, including Microsoft Word and Adobe Photoshop, have a Show 
or Format menu in their Open dialogs. This menu lets you specify the type(s) of 
files you want to see as available in the Open dialog. You can often open a file that 
appears dimmed by choosing All Documents from the Show or Format menu (in 
those applications with Open dialogs that offer such a menu).
With drag-and-drop
Mac drag-and-drop is usually all about dragging text and graphics from one place 
to another. But there’s another angle to drag-and-drop — one that has to do with 
files and icons.
You can open a document by dragging its icon onto the icon of the proper appli-
cation. You can open a document created with Microsoft Word, for example, by 
dragging the document icon onto the Microsoft Word application icon in the 
Applications folder, an alias of the Word icon, or Word’s dock icon. The Word icon 
highlights, and the document launches. Usually, of course, it’s easier to double-
click a document’s icon to open it; the proper application opens automatically 
when you do — or at least, it does most of the time. Which reminds me . . . .

140     PART 2  How Stuff Works
With a Quick Look
The Quick Look window, shown in Figure 6-9, shows you the contents of many 
types of files.
To use the Quick Look command to peek at the contents of most files in Open 
dialogs, right-click or Control-click the file and choose Quick Look, or use its 
easy-to-remember shortcut: Press the spacebar or ⌘  +Y. Whichever way, you’ll 
soon see the contents of that file in a floating window without launching another 
application.
Chapter 8 contains more information about Quick Look.
When your Mac can’t open a file
If you try to open a file, but macOS can’t find a program to open that file, macOS 
prompts you with an alert window. I tried to open a very old (1993) file created on 
a long-defunct Psion Series 3 handheld PDA (a file so old that most of you have 
probably never seen the .wrd file extension), shown in Figure 6-10.
FIGURE 6-9:

Look window

FIGURE 6-10:

application.

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     141
Click Cancel to abort the attempt to open the file, or click the Choose Application 
or Search App Store button to select another application to open this file.
If you click the Choose Application button, a dialog appears (conveniently opened 
to your Applications folder). Applications that macOS doesn’t think can be used to 
open the file are dimmed. For a wider choice of applications, choose All Applica-
tions (instead of Recommended Applications) from the Enable pop-up menu.
You can’t open every file with every program. If you try to open an MP3 (audio) 
file with Microsoft Excel (a spreadsheet), for example, it just won’t work; you get 
an error message or a screen full of gibberish. Sometimes, you just have to keep 
trying until you find the right program; at other times, you don’t have a program 
that can open the file.
When in doubt, use a search engine to read about the file extension. You’ll usually 
find out more than you need to know about what application(s) create files with 
that extension.
With the application of your choice
I don’t know about you, but people send me files all the time that were created 
by applications I don’t use . . . or at least that I don’t use for that document type. 
macOS lets you specify the application in which you want to open a document in 
the future when you double-click it. More than that, you can specify that you want 
all documents of that type to open with the specified application. “Where is this 
magic bullet hidden?” you ask. Right there in the file’s Info window.
Assigning a file type to an application
Suppose that you want all .jpg files that usually open in Preview to open instead 
in Pixelmator, a more capable third-party image-editing program. Here’s what 
to do:
1.	 Click one of the files in Finder.
2.	 Choose File  ➪  Get Info (⌘  +I).
Or right-click, Control-click, or tap with two fingers on the file and then select 
Get Info from the contextual shortcut menu.
3.	 In the Info window, click the gray triangle to disclose the Open With pane.
4.	 From the pop-up menu, choose an application that macOS believes will 
open this document type.
In Figure 6-11, I’m choosing Pixelmator. Now Pixelmator opens when I open 
this file (instead of the default application, Preview).

142     PART 2  How Stuff Works
5.	 (Optional) If you click the Change All button at the bottom of the Open 
With pane, as shown in Figure 6-11, you make Pixelmator the new default 
application for all .jpg files that would otherwise be opened in Preview.
Notice the handy alert that appears when you click the Change All button and 
how nicely it explains what will happen if you click Continue.
Opening a file with an application  
other than the default
Here’s one more technique that works great when you want to open a document 
with a program other than its default. Just drag the file onto the application’s icon 
or alias icon or dock icon, and presto — the file opens in the application.
If I were to double-click an MP3 file, for example, the file usually would open in 
iTunes (and, by default, would be copied into my iTunes library). But I frequently 
want to audition (listen to) MP3 files with QuickTime Player, so they’re not auto-
matically added to my iTunes Music library. Dragging the MP3 file onto Quick-
Time Player’s icon in the Applications folder or its dock icon (if it’s on the dock) 
solves this conundrum quickly and easily.
FIGURE 6-11: 
Changing the 
application

document.

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     143
If the icon doesn’t highlight and you release the mouse button anyway, the file 
ends up in the same folder as the application with the icon that didn’t highlight. If 
that happens, just choose Edit ➪ Undo (or press ⌘  +Z), and the mislaid file magi-
cally returns to where it was before you dropped it. Just remember — don’t do 
anything else after you drop the file, or Undo might not work. If Undo doesn’t 
work, you must move the file back to 
its original location manually.
Only applications that might be able 
to open the file should highlight 
when you drag the file on them. That 
doesn’t mean the document will be 
usable — just that the application can 
open it. Suffice it to say that macOS 
is usually smart enough to figure out 
which applications on your hard drive 
can open what documents — and to 
offer you a choice.
One last thing: If all you want to do is 
open a file with an application other 
than its default (and not change any-
thing for the future), the techniques  
I just described work fine, but an even 
easier way is to right-click the file and 
choose another app from the contex-
tual menu, as shown in Figure 6-12.
You can also change the default application to open this file by pressing Option 
after you right-click the file, and the Open With command will magically trans-
form into Always Open With. Alas, you can’t change the default application for all 
files of this type (.jpg in Figures 6-11 and 6-12); for that, you’ll have to visit the 
Info window.
Organizing Your Stuff in Folders
I won’t pretend to be able to organize your Mac for you. Organizing your files 
is as personal as your taste in music; you develop your own style with the Mac. 
But after you know how to open and save documents when you’re using applica-
tions, these sections provide food for thought — some ideas about how I orga-
nize things — and some suggestions that can make organization easier for you, 
regardless of how you choose to do it.
FIGURE 6-12: 
To open a file with an app other than its default, 
right-click and choose the app you desire.

144     PART 2  How Stuff Works
The upcoming sections look at the difference between a file and a folder; show 
you how to set up nested folders; and cover how some special folder features 
work. After you have a good handle on these things, you’ll almost certainly be a 
savvier — and better organized — macOS user.
Files versus folders
When I speak of a file, I’m talking about what’s connected to any icon except a 
folder or disk icon. A file can be a document, an application, an alias of a file or an 
application, a dictionary, a font, or any other icon that isn’t a folder or disk. The 
main distinction is that you can’t put something in most file icons.
The exceptions are icons that represent macOS packages. A package is an icon 
that acts like a file but isn’t. Examples of icons that are really packages include 
many software installers and applications, as well as documents saved by some 
programs (such as Keynote, GarageBand, Pages, or TextEdit files saved in its 
.rtfd format). When you open an icon that represents a package in the usual way 
(double-click, choose File ➪ Open, press ⌘  +O, and so on), the program or docu-
ment opens. If you want to see the contents of an icon that represents a package, 
right-click or Control-click the icon and choose Show Package Contents from the 
contextual menu. If you see an item by that name, you know that the icon is a 
package; if you don’t see Show Package Contents on the contextual menu, the icon 
represents a file, not a package.
When I talk about folders, I’m talking about things that work like manila folders in 
the real world. Their icons look like folders, like the one in the margin to the left; 
they can contain files or other folders, called subfolders. You can put any icon — 
any file or folder — inside a folder.
Here’s an exception: If you try to put a disk icon in a folder, all you get is an alias 
to the disk unless you hold down the Option key. Remember that you can’t put a 
disk icon in a folder that exists on the disk itself. In other words, you can copy 
a disk icon only to a different disk; you can never copy a disk icon to a folder that 
resides on that disk. For more about aliases, flip to Chapter 4.
File icons can look like practically anything. If the icon doesn’t look like a folder, 
package, or one of the numerous disk icons, you can be pretty sure that it’s a file.
Organizing your stuff with subfolders
As I mention earlier in this chapter, you can put folders inside other folders to 
organize your icons. A folder nested inside another folder is a subfolder.

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     145
You can create subfolders according to whatever system makes sense to you — but 
why reinvent the wheel? Here are some organizational topic ideas and naming 
examples for subfolders:
»
» By type of document: Word-Processing Documents, Spreadsheet 
Documents, Graphics Documents
»
» By date: Documents May–June, Documents Spring 2017
»
» By content: Memos, Outgoing Letters, Expense Reports
»
» By project: Project X, Project Y, Project Z
When you notice your folders swelling and starting to get messy (that is, filling 
with tons of files), subdivide them again by using a combination of these methods 
that makes sense to you. Suppose that you start by subdividing your Documents 
folder into multiple subfolders. Later, when those folders begin to get full, you can 
subdivide them even further, as shown in Figure 6-13.
My point (yes, I do have one!): Allow your folder structure to be organic, growing 
as you need it to grow. Let it happen. Don’t let any single folder get so full that 
it’s a hassle to deal with. Create new subfolders when things start to get crowded.  
(I explain how to create folders in the next section.)
If you want to monkey around with some subfolders, a good place to start is the 
Documents folder, which is inside your Home folder (that is, the Documents folder 
is a subfolder of your Home folder).
If you use a particular folder a great deal, put it in your dock, or make an alias 
of it and move the alias from the Documents folder to your Home folder or to 
your desktop (for more info on aliases, see Chapter 4) to make the folder easier 
FIGURE 6-13:

and after

ing the Novels

folders with 
subfolders.

146     PART 2  How Stuff Works
to access. Or drag the folder (or its alias) to the sidebar, so it’s always available, 
including in Open dialogs and Save sheets. If you write a lot of letters, keep an 
alias to your Correspondence folder in your Home folder, on the dock, on your 
desktop, or in the sidebar for quick access. (By the way, there’s no reason why 
you can’t have a folder appear in all four places, if you like. That’s what aliases 
are for, right?)
If you create your own subfolders in the Documents folder, you can click that 
folder on the dock to reveal them, as shown in Figure 6-14. I show you how to 
customize the dock in Chapter 3.
It’s even more convenient if you choose to view the Documents folder as a list, as 
described in Chapter 3 and shown in Figure 6-14.
Creating new folders
So you think that Apple has already given you enough folders? Can’t imagine why 
you’d need more? Think of creating new folders the same way you’d think of 
labeling a new folder at work for a specific project. New folders help you keep your 
files organized, enabling you to reorganize them just the way you want. Creating 
folders is quite simple.
To create a new folder, just follow these steps:
1.	 Decide which window you want the new folder to appear in — and then 
make sure that window is active.
If you want to create a new folder right on the desktop, make sure that no 
window is active or that you’re working in your Home/Desktop folder window. 
You can make a window active by clicking it, and you can make the desktop 
active if you have windows onscreen by clicking the desktop itself.
FIGURE 6-14: 
It’s super- 
convenient 
to have your 
Documents 
folder on the 
dock.

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     147
2.	 Choose File ➪ New Folder (or press Shift+⌘  +N).
A new, untitled folder appears in the active window with its name box already 
highlighted, ready for you to type a new name for it.
3.	 Type a name for your folder.
If you accidentally click anywhere before you type a name for the folder, the 
name box is no longer highlighted. To highlight it again, select the icon 
(single-click it) and press Return once. Now you can type its new name.
Give your folders relevant names. Folders with nebulous titles like sfdghb 
or Stuff or Untitled won’t make it any easier to find something six months 
from now.
For folders and files that you might share with users of non-Mac computers, 
here’s the rule for maximum compatibility: Use no punctuation and no 
Option-key characters in the folder name. Periods, slashes, backslashes, and 
colons in particular can be reserved for use by other operating systems. When 
I say Option-key characters, I’m talking about special-purpose ones, such as ™ 
(Option+2), ® (Option+R), ¢ (Option+4), and even © (Option+G).
Navigating with spring-loaded folders
A spring-loaded folder pops open when you drag something onto it without releas-
ing the mouse button. Spring-loaded folders work with all folder or disk icons 
in all views and in the sidebar. Because you just got the short course on folders, 
subfolders, and various ways to organize your stuff, you’re ready for your intro-
duction to one of my favorite ways to get around my disks, folders, and subfolders.
Here’s how spring-loaded folders work:
1.	 Select any icon except a disk icon.
The folder highlights to indicate that it’s selected.
2.	 Drag the selected icon onto any folder or disk icon — but don’t release 
the mouse button.
I call this hovering because you’re doing just that: hovering the cursor over a 
folder or disk icon without releasing the button.
In a second or two, the highlighted folder or disk flashes twice and then springs 
open, right under the cursor.
Press the spacebar to make the folder spring open immediately.

148     PART 2  How Stuff Works
3.	 After the folder springs open, perform any of these handy operations:
•	 Continue to traverse your folder structure this way. Subfolders continue to 
pop open until you release the mouse button.
•	 If you release the mouse button, the icon you’ve been dragging is dropped 
into the active folder at the time. That window remains open — but all the 
windows you traversed clean up after themselves by closing automatically, 
leaving your window clean and uncluttered.
•	 If you want to cancel a spring-loaded folder, drag the cursor away from the 
folder icon or outside the boundaries of the sprung window. The folder 
pops shut.
After you get used to spring-loaded folders, you’ll wonder how you ever got along 
without them. They work in all four views, and they work with icons in the sidebar 
or dock. Give ’em a try, and you’ll be hooked.
Smart folders
As the late Steve Jobs was fond of saying near the end of his keynotes, “There is 
one more thing,” and when it comes to folders, that one last thing is the smart 
folder.
A smart folder lets you save search criteria and have them work in the background 
to display the results in real time. In other words, a smart folder is updated con-
tinuously, so it displays all the files on your computer that match the search cri-
teria at the moment.
So, for example, I create a smart folder that gathers all files with Dr. Mac in their 
name that were created after 1/1/2017, as shown in Figure 6-15. Or you can create a 
smart folder that displays graphics files, but only the ones bigger (or smaller) than 
a specified file size. Then all those files appear in one convenient smart folder.
FIGURE 6-15: 
A smart folder 
that displays 
files that meet 
certain criteria.

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     149
The possibilities are endless. Because smart folders use alias-like technology to 
display items, the actual files reside in only one location: the folder where you 
originally put them. True to their name, smart folders don’t gather the files them-
selves in a separate place; rather, they gather aliases of files, leaving the originals 
right where you stashed them. Neat!
Also, because Spotlight (discussed in Chapter 8) is built deep into the bowels of the 
macOS file system and kernel, smart folders are updated in real time and so are 
always current, even after you add or delete files on your hard drive since creating 
the smart folder.
Smart folders are so useful that Apple provides five ways to create one. The fol-
lowing steps show you how:
1.	 Start your smart folder by using any of the following methods:
•	 Choose File ➪ New Smart Folder.
•	 Press ⌘  +Option+N.
•	 Choose File ➪ Find.
•	 Press ⌘  +F.
•	 Type at least one character in the search box of a Finder window.
If you have All My Files selected in the sidebar, you can’t use the last method, 
because All My Files is a smart folder itself — one with a weird icon, but a smart 
folder nonetheless.
2.	 Refine the criteria for your search by clicking the + button to add a 
criterion or the – button to delete one.
3.	 When you’re satisfied and ready to gather your criteria into a smart 
folder, click the Save button below the search box.
A sheet drops down.
4.	 Choose where you want to save your folder.
Although the Save sheet is displayed, you can add the smart folder to the 
sidebar by selecting the Add to Sidebar check box.
5.	 When you’re finished editing criteria, click the Save button to save the 
folder with its criteria.
After you create your smart folder, you can save it anywhere on any hard drive and 
use it like any other folder.

150     PART 2  How Stuff Works
If you want to change the criteria for a smart folder you created, right-click or 
Control-click the smart folder in the sidebar and choose Show Search Criteria.
When you’re finished changing the criteria, click the Save button to resave your 
folder. Don’t worry — if you try to close a smart folder that you modify without 
saving your changes, macOS politely asks whether you want to save this smart 
folder and warns that if you don’t save, the changes you made will be lost. You 
may be asked whether you want to replace the previous smart folder of the same 
name; usually, you do.
Smart folders (with the exception of the sidebar’s All My Files, which has its own 
weird little icon) display a little gear in their center, making them easy to tell apart 
from regular folders.
Smart folders can save you a lot of time and effort, so if you haven’t played with 
them much (or at all) yet, be sure to give ’em a try.
Shuffling Files and Folders
Sometimes, keeping files and folders organized means moving them from one 
place to another. At other times, you want to copy them, rename them, or com-
press them to send to a friend. These sections explain all those things and more.
All the techniques that I discuss in the following sections work at least as well for 
windows that use List, Column, or Cover Flow view as they do for windows that 
use Icon view. I use Icon view in the figures in this section only because it’s the 
best view for pictures to show you what’s going on. For what it’s worth, I find 
moving and copying files much easier in windows that use List or Column view.
Moving files and folders
You can move files and folders around within a window to your heart’s content —  
as long as that window is set to Icon view. Just click and drag any icon to its new loca-
tion in the window. If the icons won’t move, make sure View ➪ Arrange By is set 
to None.
Some people spend hours arranging icons in a window until they’re just so. But 
because using Icon view wastes so much screen space, I avoid using icons in a 
window.

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     151
You can’t move icons around in a window that is displayed in List, Column, or 
Cover Flow view, which makes total sense when you think about it. (Well, you can 
move them to put them in a different folder in List, Column, or Cover Flow view, 
but that’s not moving them around, really.) And you can’t move icons around in a 
window under the spell of the Arrange By command.
As you probably expect from Apple by now, you 
have choices for how you move one file or folder 
into another folder. You can use these techniques 
to move any icon (folder, document, alias, or pro-
gram icon) into folders or onto other disks:
»
» Drag an icon onto a folder icon. Drag the icon 
for one folder (or file) onto the icon for another 
folder (or disk) and then release when the second 
icon is highlighted, as shown in Figure 6-16, top. 
The first folder will then be inside the second 
folder. Put another way, the first folder is now a 
subfolder of the second folder. This technique 
works regardless of whether the second folder’s 
window is open.
»
» Drag an icon into an open folder’s window. 
Drag the icon for one folder (or file) into the open 
window for a second folder (or disk), and then 
release it when the second folder’s window is 
highlighted in yellow, as shown in Figure 6-16 
(bottom).
If you want to move an item from one disk to another disk, you can’t use the pre-
ceding tricks. Your item is copied, not moved. If you want to move a file or folder 
from one disk to another, you have to hold down the ⌘   key when you drag an icon 
from one disk to another. The little Copying Files window even changes to read 
Moving Files. Nice touch, eh?
Selecting multiple icons
Sometimes you want to move or copy several items into a single folder. The pro-
cess is pretty much the same as it is when you copy one file or folder: That is, you 
just drag the icon to where you want it and drop it there. But you need to select all 
the items you want before you can drag them en masse to their destination.
If you want to move all the files in a particular folder, simply choose Edit ➪ Select 
All or press ⌘  +A. This command selects all icons in the active window, regardless 
FIGURE 6-16: 
Two ways of putting one folder 
into another.

152     PART 2  How Stuff Works
of whether you can see them onscreen. If no window is active, choosing Select All 
selects every icon on the desktop.
But what if you want to select only some of the files in the active window or on the 
desktop? Here’s the most convenient method:
1.	 To select more than one icon in a folder, do one of the following:
•	 Click once in the folder window (don’t click any one icon), and drag your 
mouse (or keypad) while continuing to hold down the mouse button. You 
see an outline of a box around the icons while you drag, and all icons 
within or touching the box become highlighted (see Figure 6-17).
•	 Click one icon and hold down the Shift key while you click others. As long as 
you hold down the Shift key, each new icon that you click is added to the 
selection. To deselect an icon, click it a second time while still holding down 
the Shift key.
•	 Click one icon and hold down the ⌘   key while you click others. The difference 
between using the Shift and ⌘   keys is that the ⌘   key doesn’t select 
everything between it and the first item selected when your window is in 
List, Cover Flow, or Column view. In Icon view, it really doesn’t make much 
difference.
To deselect an icon, click it while still holding down the ⌘   key.
2.	 After you select the icons, click one of them (clicking anywhere else 
deselects the icons) and drag them to the location where you want to 
move them (or Option-drag to copy them).
FIGURE 6-17:

than one icon 
by clicking and 
dragging with 
your mouse (or 
trackpad).

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     153
Be careful with multiple selections, especially when you drag icons to the Trash. 
You can easily — and accidentally — select more than one icon, so watch out that 
you don’t accidentally put the wrong icon in the Trash by not paying close atten-
tion. (I detail how the Trash icon works later in this chapter.)
Playing the icon name game:  
Renaming icons
Icon, icon, bo-bicon, banana-fanna fo-ficon. Betcha can change the name of any 
old icon! Well, that’s not entirely true . . . .
If an icon is locked or busy (the application is currently open), or if you don’t 
have the owner’s permission to rename that icon (see Chapter 15 for details about 
permissions), you can’t rename it. Similarly, you should never rename certain 
reserved icons (such as the Library, System, and Desktop folders).
To rename an icon, you can either click the icon’s name directly (don’t click the 
icon itself because that selects the icon) or click the icon and press Return once.
Either way, the icon’s name is selected and sur-
rounded with a box, and you can type a new name, 
as shown in Figure  6-18. In addition, the cursor 
changes from a pointer to a text-editing I-beam. 
An I-beam cursor is the Mac’s way of telling you 
that you can type now. At this point, if you click the 
I-beam cursor anywhere in the name box, you can 
edit the icon’s original name. If you don’t click the 
I-beam cursor in the name box but just begin typ-
ing, the icon’s original name is replaced by what 
you type.
If you’ve never changed an icon’s name, give it a try. And don’t forget: If you click 
the icon itself, the icon is selected, and you won’t be able to change its name. If 
you do accidentally select the icon, just press Return once to edit the name of the 
icon. Yosemite was the first version of macOS to allow you to rename more than 
one file at a time, and High Sierra continues the tradition. To rename a group of 
files, first select them all, and then right-click anywhere in your selection and 
choose Rename x Items (where x is the number of files selected) from the pop-up 
menu. A sheet appears with options for adding or replacing text in the existing 
filename, or creating a custom format with indexes, counters, and dates before or 
after whatever new filename you choose.
FIGURE 6-18: 
Change an icon’s name by typing 
over the old one.

154     PART 2  How Stuff Works
I use a more powerful third-party app called Better Rename ($19.99 in the Mac 
App Store), primarily because I’ve been using it for years and it has useful options 
that High Sierra’s new batch-renaming feature doesn’t offer. On the other hand, 
High Sierra’s new batch-renaming feature is pretty good and all that many people 
will ever need. For those who wish it were a little more robust or powerful, Better 
Rename is just what the doctor ordered.
One last thing: If you have two or more icons you want to move to a new folder, 
select the items and choose File ➪ New Folder with Selection, press ⌘  +Control+N, 
or right-click or Control-click one of the selected items and choose New Folder 
with Selection. All three techniques will create a new folder, move the selected 
icons into it, and select the name of the new folder (which will be New Folder with 
Items) so you can type its new name immediately.
Compressing files
If you’re going to send files as an email enclosure, creating a compressed archive 
of the files first and sending the archive instead of the originals usually saves you 
time sending the files and saves the recipient time downloading them. To create 
this compressed archive, simply select the file(s) or folder(s) and then choose 
File ➪ Compress. The name of the document or folder you’re compressing appears 
after the word Compress in the menu, so if you were compressing a file called 
Foo.doc, the File menu command would read Compress Foo.doc. This creates a 
compressed .zip file out of your selection. The compressed file is smaller than 
the original — sometimes by quite a bit. Double-click a compressed (.zip) file to 
decompress it.
Getting rid of icons
To get rid of an icon — any icon — merely drag it onto the Trash icon in your 
dock.
Trashing an alias gets rid of only the alias, not the parent file. But trashing a 
document, a folder, or an application icon puts it in the Trash, where it will be 
deleted permanently the next time you empty the Trash. The Finder menu offers 
a couple of commands that help you manage the Trash:
»
» Finder ➪ Empty Trash: This command deletes all items in the Trash from 
your hard drive, period.

CHAPTER 6  The Care and Feeding of Files and Folders     155
I’ll probably say this more than once: Use this command with a modicum of 
caution. After a file is dragged into the Trash and the Trash is emptied, the file 
is gone, gone, gone unless you have a Time Machine or other backup. (Okay, 
maybe ProSoft Engineering’s Data Rescue or some other third-party utility can 
bring it back, but I wouldn’t bet the farm on it.)
If you put something in the Trash by accident, you can almost always return it 
from whence it came: Just click the Trash icon in the dock to open its window, 
right- or Control-click the icon you want to return, and choose Put Back in the 
shortcut menu.
You can also invoke the magical Undo command by choosing Edit ➪ Undo or by 
pressing ⌘  +Z. The accidentally trashed file returns to its original location. Usu-
ally. Unfortunately, Undo doesn’t work every time — and it remembers only the 
very last action that you performed when it does work — so don’t rely on it too 
much. (The right- or Control-click trick, however, works every time.)
The Incredible iCloud Drive
iCloud has been around in various forms for years, but iCloud Drive is the current 
incarnation for taking advantage of Apple’s remote storage service.
iCloud Drive stores files of any type in iCloud. It’s built into High Sierra and works 
like any other folder on your Mac. In other words, you can drag documents of any 
type into it, organize them with folders and tags (see Chapter 4) if you care to, and 
find them with Spotlight (see Chapter 8).
The best part is that the files are available not only on your Mac but also on your 
iPhone, iPad, or Windows PC as well. That’s the good news. The bad news is that if 
you need more than 5GB of storage space, it’s going to cost you. You get up to 5GB 
at no cost; if you need more it’s 99 cents per month for 50GB, $2.99 per month 
for 200GB, or $9.99 per month for 2TB.
Not that long ago, iCloud was much more expensive: $40 per year for 25GB, or 
$100 per year for 55GB. Compare that to the current pricing of $12 per year for 
50GB or $36 per year for 200GB. Kudos to Apple for making iCloud Drive not just 
convenient but also (more) affordable.
On the other hand, it would be nice if it were even more affordable (hint, hint).

156     PART 2  How Stuff Works
Although iCloud Drive should be enabled by default, if yours isn’t (you don’t see 
it in the sidebar), launch System Preferences (  ➪ System Preferences), click the 
iCloud icon, and then enable the check box for iCloud Drive.
If you still don’t see it in your sidebar, open Finder Preferences (Finder ➪ Finder 
Preferences), click the sidebar icon, and then enable the check box to Show iCloud 
Drive in the sidebar.
In High Sierra you can choose to store the contents of your desktop and Docu-
ments folders in iCloud rather than on your startup disk. The upside is that files 
in those folders are available to all of your Macs (assuming you have more than 
one) and via the iCloud website. The downside is that you have to have Internet 
access to use those files.
If storing your Desktop and Documents folders in the cloud appeals to you, click 
the Options button next to iCloud Drive in the iCloud System Preferences Pane and 
enable the check box for Desktop & Documents Folders.

CHAPTER 7  Comprehending the macOS Clipboard     157
Comprehending the 
macOS Clipboard
B
efore you start copying files, let me introduce you to the Clipboard. The 
Clipboard is a holding area for the last thing that you cut or copied. That cop-
ied item can be text, a picture, a portion of a picture, an object in a ­drawing 
program, a column of numbers in a spreadsheet, any icon (except a drive), or just 
about anything else that can be selected. In other words, the Clipboard is your 
Mac’s temporary storage area.
Introducing the Clipboard
Most of the time, the Clipboard works quietly in the background, but if you want 
to know what it currently contains, the Clipboard will reveal itself if you choose 
Edit  ➪  Show Clipboard.
This command summons the Clipboard window, shown in Figure  7-1, which 
­displays the type of item (such as text, an image, or sound) on the Clipboard, as 
well as either the item itself or a message letting you know that the item on the 
Clipboard can’t be displayed.

Sierra’s Clipboard
»

Clipboard
»
» Pasting files and folders with the 
Clipboard
»
» Introducing High Sierra’s Universal 
Clipboard

158     PART 2  How Stuff Works
As a storage area, the Clipboard’s contents are temporary. Very temporary. When 
you cut or copy an item, that item remains on the Clipboard only until you cut or 
copy something else, logout, restart, or crash. When you cut or copy something 
else, the new item replaces the Clipboard’s contents, and the newcomer remains 
on the Clipboard until you cut or copy something else (or logout, restart, or crash). 
And so it goes.
Whatever is on the Clipboard heads straight for oblivion if you crash, lose power, 
log out, or shut down your Mac, so don’t count on it too heavily or for too long.
The Clipboard commands on the Edit menu are enabled only when they can be 
used. If the selected item can be cut or copied, the Cut and Copy commands in 
the Edit menu are enabled (black). If the selected item can’t be cut or copied, the 
commands are unavailable and are dimmed (gray). If the Clipboard is empty or 
the current document can’t accept what’s on the Clipboard, the Paste command 
is dimmed. Finally, when nothing is selected, the Cut, Copy, and Clear commands 
are dimmed.
If you don’t see the Show Clipboard command in the Edit menu, chances are, an 
application other than Finder is active. Just activate Finder first and you’ll see the 
Show Clipboard command in its Edit menu.
One more thing: Icons can’t be cut; they can only be copied (and pasted). So when 
an icon is selected, the Cut command is always gray.
Copying Files and Folders
One way to copy icons from one place to another is to use the Clipboard. When 
a file or folder icon is selected, choose Edit  ➪  Copy (or use its shortcut, ⌘  +C) to 
copy the selected icon to the Clipboard. Note that this doesn’t delete the selected 
item; it just makes a copy of it on the Clipboard. To paste the copied icon in another 
location, navigate to that other location and then choose Edit  ➪  Paste (or use its 
shortcut, ⌘  +V).
FIGURE 7-1: 
The Show 
Clipboard 
command 
displays 
whatever is on 
the Clipboard 
(if it can).

CHAPTER 7  Comprehending the macOS Clipboard     159
Other methods of copying icons from one place to another include these:
»
» Drag an icon from one folder icon onto another folder icon while holding 
down the Option key. Release the mouse button and Option key when the 
second folder is highlighted. This technique works regardless of whether the 
second folder’s window is open.
If you don’t hold down the Option key, you move the icon to a new location 
rather than copy it, as I explain a little later in this section.
When you copy something by dragging and dropping it with the Option key 
held down, the cursor changes to include a little plus sign (+) next to the 
arrow, as shown in the margin. Neat!
»
» Drag an icon into an open window for another folder while holding down 
the Option key. Drag the icon for the file or folder that you want to copy into 
the open window for a second folder (or other hard drive or removable 
media, such as a USB flash drive).
»
» Choose File  ➪  Duplicate (⌘  +D) or right-click or Control-click the file or 
folder that you want to duplicate; then choose Duplicate from the 
contextual menu that appears. This makes a copy of the selected icon, adds 
the word copy to its name, and then places the copy in the same window as 
the original icon. You can use the Duplicate command on any icon except a 
disk icon.
You can’t duplicate an entire disk onto itself. But you can copy an entire disk 
(call it Disk 1) to any other actual, physical, separate disk (call it Disk 2) as long 
as Disk 2 has enough space available. Just hold down Option and drag Disk 1 
onto Disk 2’s icon. The contents of Disk 1 are copied to Disk 2 and appear on 
Disk 2 in a folder named Disk 1.
If Disk 1 is a startup disk (macOS has been installed on the disk and it can start your 
Mac), Disk 2 will contain the same files but will not be a bootable startup disk 
(that is, it can’t start a Mac). Also, some files may not be copied properly due to 
macOS permissions issues (see Chapter 15 for the story on permissions).
You can cut an icon’s name, but you can’t cut the icon itself; you may only copy an 
icon. To achieve the effect of cutting an icon, select the icon, copy it to the Clip-
board, paste it in its new location, and then move the original icon to the Trash.
If you’re wondering why anyone would ever want to copy a file, trust me: Some-
day, you will. Suppose that you have a file called Long Letter to Mom in a folder 
called Old Correspondence. You figure that Mom has forgotten that letter by now, 
and you want to send it again. But before you do, you want to change the date and 

160     PART 2  How Stuff Works
delete the reference to Clarence, her pit bull, who is no longer with us. So now you 
need to put a copy of Long Letter to Mom in your Current Correspondence folder. 
This technique yields the same result as making a copy of a file by using Save As, 
which I describe in Chapter 6.
When you copy a file, it’s wise to change the name of the copied file after you 
paste it. See, having more than one file on your hard drive with the same name 
isn’t such a good idea, even if the files are in different folders. Trust me — having 
12 files all named Expense Report or 15 files named Doctor Mac Consulting Invoice is 
confusing no matter how well organized your folder structure is.
Add distinguishing words or dates to the names of files and folders you copy, such 
as Expense Report Q3 2016 or Doctor Mac Consulting Invoice 4-4-2016.
You can have lots of files with the same name on the same disk (although, as I men-
tion earlier, it’s probably not a good idea). But your Mac won’t let you have more 
than one file with the same name and extension (.txt, .jpg, .doc) in the same folder.
Pasting from the Clipboard
As I mention earlier in this chapter, to place the icon that’s on the Clipboard 
someplace new, click where you want the item to go, and choose Edit  ➪  Paste or 
use the keyboard shortcut ⌘  +V to paste what you’ve copied or cut.
Pasting doesn’t purge the contents of the Clipboard. In fact, an item stays on the 
Clipboard until you cut, copy, restart, shut down, log out, or crash. This means 
that you can paste the same item over and over and over again, which can come 
in pretty handy at times.
Almost all programs have an Edit menu and use the Macintosh Clipboard, which 
means you can usually cut or copy something from a document in one program 
and paste it into a document in another program. Usually.
High Sierra’s Universal Clipboard
Introduced in macOS Sierra, the Universal Clipboard lets you copy or cut an item 
on one device (say, your Mac), and then paste it on another device (say, your 
iPhone or iPad). Because it performs this magic using iCloud, the requirements 
are as follows:

CHAPTER 7  Comprehending the macOS Clipboard     161
»
» Wi-Fi and Bluetooth must both be enabled.
»
» Both devices must have Handoff enabled. (It’s in System 
Preferences  ➪  General on your Mac and Settings  ➪  General  ➪  Handoff & 
Suggested Apps on your iOS device.)
»
» Both devices must be logged into the same iCloud account.
»
» The devices must be within a few feet of each other.
When these conditions are met, Universal Clipboard just works. If you cut or  
copy something on one device, you can paste it on another device for approxi-
mately two minutes after you cut or copy it; after a couple of minutes, however, 
all bets are off.
If it doesn’t work for you, check the Apple website (www.apple.com/osx/ 
continuity) to make sure both devices meet the system requirements. If both 
are supported and you still can’t make it work, try turning off Handoff on both 
devices, wait a minute or two, and then turn it back on. You might also try logging 
out of iCloud on both devices, restarting them, and then logging back into iCloud 
on both. Finally, some older Macs have issues with Continuity features such as 
Handoff and Universal Clipboard even though they meet the specifications.

CHAPTER 8  Four Terrific Timesaving Tools     165
Four Terrific 
Timesaving Tools
I
n this chapter, I show you the ins and outs of four terrific timesaving tools: 
Quick Look, Spotlight, Mission Control, and Launchpad. Each is designed to 
let you use your Mac better, faster, and more elegantly. Yes, you can use your 
mouse and click your way to any file or folder on any drive, but these features are 
built into High Sierra for your convenience.
At the risk of repeating myself, Apple frequently provides more than one way 
to accomplish a task in macOS, so there’s duplication and overlap among and 
between the tools in this chapter and tools I discuss elsewhere in this book. Don’t 
worry. Take what you need, and leave the rest. Most users love Quick Look, but 
some never use it. Some people love Spotlight; others rarely invoke it. Mission 
Control is amazingly helpful, especially on laptops with small screens, but quite a 
few users don’t care for it at all.
My advice: Try all the tools and techniques in this chapter at least a few times 
before you decide whether you want or need them.

With a Quick Look
The Quick Look command displays the contents of the selected file in a floating 
window. The key point is that you can see what’s in a file without double-clicking 
(to open) it and without launching any application. This feature is handy when 
you want to peek at the contents of a file without having to open it.
To take a Quick Look yourself, select an icon and do any of the following:
»
» Choose File  ➪  Quick Look.
»
» Right-click or Control-click the file’s icon and choose Quick Look from its 
contextual menu.
»
» Choose Quick Look from the Action button/menu on the toolbar.
»
» Use one of its two keyboard shortcuts: ⌘  +Y or the easiest shortcut ever, 
spacebar.
One of my favorite ways to use Quick Look is with a folder full of images, such as 
the one shown in Figure 8-1.
FIGURE 8-1: 
The Quick Look 
window (left) 
displaying an 
image from 
one of the 
selected icons 
in a folder full 
of pictures.

CHAPTER 8  Four Terrific Timesaving Tools     167
The cool part is that while the Quick Look window is open, you can select different 
icons in the Finder window and quickly peek at their contents in the Quick Look 
window.
The bad news is that although Quick Look works with many types of files  —  
Microsoft Office, Apple iWork, plain-text, PDF, TIFF, GIF, JPEG, PNG, and most 
types of audio and video files  — it doesn’t work with all files. You’ll know it 
doesn’t work if Quick Look shows you a big document, folder, or application icon 
instead of the contents of that file.
If you select multiple items before you invoke Quick Look, as I did in Figure 8-1, 
three buttons appear at the top of the Quick Look window near the left side: Next, 
Previous, and Index Sheet. With these controls, you can view all selected items at 
the same time as an index sheet, as shown in Figure 8-2, or view them one at a time 
by clicking the Next or Previous buttons.
The blue outline around the image at the bottom right indicates that the pointer 
is hovering over that image; if I were to click, that image would fill the window, 
and the icons shown at the top of the Quick Look window in Figure 8-1 would 
reappear.

Share and share alike with the Share menu
If you use an Apple iDevice, you’re surely familiar with the rectangular button 
with an arrow escaping from it, as shown in the margin and in Figure 8-1. That’s 
the Share menu, and it has as many as seven options (depending on the type of 
file you selected):
»
» Mail: Launches the Mail app and attaches the selected file to a blank mes-
sage, ready for you to address and send.
»
» Messages: Launches the Messages app and puts the selected file in an 
outgoing message, ready for you to address and send. You become well 
acquainted with the Messages app in Chapter 14.
»
» AirDrop: Sends the selected file to other Mac users or iDevice users. As long 
as you’re on the same Wi-Fi network, your file transfer takes but a single click 
(or a single tap on iDevices).
»
» Notes: Sends the selected file to the Notes app, where you can add it to an 
existing note or create a note for it. (You discover the Notes app in Chapter 9.)
»
» Twitter: Tweets the selected file to your Twitter account. Note that this option 
appears only when you select an image file. If you don’t see it when you click 
your Share button, you probably selected a PDF or other type of file that can’t 
be uploaded to Twitter.
»
» Facebook: Posts the selected file to your Facebook account. Note that this 
option appears only when you select an image file. If you don’t see it when 
you click your Share button, you probably selected a PDF or other type of file 
that can’t be uploaded to Facebook.
»
» Flickr: Posts the selected file to Flickr, a popular photo-sharing site. Note that 
this option appears only when you select an image file. If you don’t see it 
when you click your Share button, you probably selected a PDF or other type 
of file that can’t be uploaded to Flickr.
»
» Add to Photos: Adds the selected item to the All Photos album in the Photos 
app.
»
» More: High Sierra’s extensible architecture lets you add other services (such 
as Vimeo or LinkedIn) and apps (such as iPhoto and Aperture) to your Share 
menu. To manage these extensions, choose More from the Share menu. 
Alternatively, you can launch the System Preferences application, click the 
Extensions icon, and then click the Share Menu item on the left side of the 
window.

Slide into Slideshow (full-screen) mode
Quick Look really shines in its Slideshow (full-screen) mode, which you can start 
with any of these techniques:
»
» Hold down Option and choose File  ➪  Slideshow.
»
» Press ⌘  +Option+Y.
»
» If your file is already open in the Quick Look window, click the full-screen 
button, as labeled in Figure 8-1 and shown here in the margin.
When you’re in Slideshow mode, a completely different set of controls appears 
onscreen automatically, as shown in Figure 8-3.
The Slideshow controls disappear after a few seconds of inactivity; if you don’t see 
them when you need them, just move the pointer, and they’ll magically reappear.
To exit Slideshow (full-screen) mode, press Esc or click the Exit Full Screen but-
ton to return to the Quick Look window or the Close Quick Look button to both exit 
Slideshow mode and quit Quick Look.
When you’re finished with the Quick Look window, click the X button in the  
top-left corner (refer to Figure  8-1). If you’re in full-screen mode, click the  
X button in the control bar, as shown in Figure 8-3, or press ⌘  +Y, which works 
in either mode.
Spotlight on Finding Files  
and Folders Faster
Even if you follow every single bit of advice provided in this chapter, a time will 
come when you won’t be able to find a file or folder even though you know for cer-
tain that it’s right there on your hard drive. Somewhere. Fortunately, High Sierra 
FIGURE 8-3:

mode.

170     PART 3  Getting Things Done
includes a fabulous technology called Spotlight, which can help you find almost 
anything on any mounted disk in seconds. Spotlight can search for
»
» Files
»
» Folders
»
» Text inside documents
»
» Files and folders by their metadata (creation date, modification date, kind, 
size, and so on)
Spotlight finds what you’re looking for and then organizes its results logically, all 
in the blink of an eye (on most Macs).
Spotlight is both a technology and a feature. The technology is pervasive through-
out High Sierra, and is the underlying power behind the search boxes in many 
Apple applications and utilities such as Mail, Contacts, System Preferences, and 
Finder. You can also use it by clicking the Spotlight menu — the little magnifying 
glass at the right end of the menu bar. Finally, you can reuse Spotlight searches 
in the future by turning them into smart folders (which I explain in Chapter 6).
Finding files and folders has never been faster or easier than it is in High Sierra. So 
in the following sections, I look at the two separate but related ways that Spotlight 
helps you find files, folders, and even text inside document files and on the web: 
the search box in the toolbar of Finder windows and the main Spotlight menu.
Using the search box in Finder windows
With its power provided by Spotlight, this definitely isn’t your father’s search box.
The following steps walk you through all the features:
1.	 Choose File  ➪  Find or press ⌘  +F to move the pointer to the search box of 
the active window.
If you want to search in a specific folder, open that folder before pressing ⌘  +F.
If no windows are open, the desktop window will open with the pointer in its 
search box.
2.	 In the search box, type a single character.
I typed the letter a, and the window starts displaying the results, as shown in 
Figure 8-4.

CHAPTER 8  Four Terrific Timesaving Tools     171
At the same time, a menu drops down below your pointer to offer search 
suggestions, such as Filenames and Kinds as shown in Figure 8-4, as well as 
others such as Dates, Sent By, or Downloaded From (not shown). Select an 
item from the menu to narrow the scope of your search. Or type additional 
characters: The more you type, the fewer matches and suggestions you’ll see.
Spotlight’s default behavior is to search files’ contents if it can (and it can search 
the text inside files created by many popular applications).
Third-party Spotlight plug-ins are available that let you search the contents of 
file types not supported by High Sierra, including old WordPerfect and 
QuarkXPress files and many others. Search the Internet for Spotlight plug-ins, 
and you’ll find plug-ins for dozens of popular apps.
If you know all or part of the file’s name, you can limit your search to filenames 
(that is, exclude text in files and search only for files by name). Just choose 
Name Matches: (it’s a in Figure 8-4) from the drop-down menu.
3.	 When you find the file or folder, you can open any item in the window by 
double-clicking it.
Keep these points in mind when you perform a search:
»
» You have a choice of where to search. This Mac is selected in Figure 8-5.
»
» You can choose additional search criteria — such as the kind (folder  
in Figure 8-5) and the date the file was created (Within Last 60 Days in 
Figure 8-5) — as well as other attributes, including Modification Date,  
Creation Date, Keywords, Label, File Contents, and File Size.
»
» To add another criterion, simply click the + button on the right side of the 
window.
»
» To save a search for reuse in the future, click the Save button on the right side 
of the window.
FIGURE 8-4: 
Type one 
character in 
the search box, 
and the magic 
begins.

172     PART 3  Getting Things Done
Try choosing different options from the window’s Arrange menu — Name, Kind, 
Date Last Opened, and so on — to see the search results presented in different 
ways.
So there you have it — fast searches made easy in Finder. But you can access the 
power of Spotlight in many ways, and the search box in the toolbar of Finder win-
dows is merely one of them.
Using the Spotlight menu and window
Another way to search for files and folders is to use the Spotlight menu itself — 
the magnifying-glass icon at the far-right end of your menu bar. Click the icon to 
open the Spotlight search box, and then type a character, word, or series of words 
in the search box to find an item. Spotlight floats elegantly in the middle of your 
screen, as shown in Figure 8-6.
Check out the scrollable previews, and how they’re culled not only from your hard 
drive but also from Wikipedia, Bing, Maps, and other sources.
FIGURE 8-5:

entire Mac or a 
specific folder 
(and its sub-
folders) and

your search 
using one or 
more criteria.
FIGURE 8-6: 
This is 
Spotlight in 
High Sierra.

CHAPTER 8  Four Terrific Timesaving Tools     173
Also note that a preview appears to the right of the selected item (a video about the 
High Sierras in Figure 8-6), a nice touch.
Memorize and use the super-convenient and easy-to-remember keyboard short-
cut for opening the Spotlight search box, which is ⌘  +spacebar by default. If you 
don’t find ⌘  +spacebar appealing as a shortcut, you can change it to whatever you 
like in the Spotlight System Preferences pane.
Spotlight is more than just a menu and a search box; it also uses a technology  
that’s pervasive throughout macOS and apps, including (but certainly not ­limited 
to) Mail and Contacts. The reason why it’s so spectacularly speedy is that it indexes 
your files when your Mac is idle. The upshot is that Spotlight knows file locations 
and contents soon after a file is created or modified.
One last thing: The search field in Finder windows finds items only on your hard 
drive. To include results from the Internet, you have to use the Spotlight floating 
window via its menu icon or keyboard shortcut.
The bottom line is that regardless of which method you choose to invoke it — the 
search box in a Finder window or the new floating Spotlight window — using 
Spotlight saves you time and effort.
Blast Off with Mission Control
Mission Control shows you big icons representing all open applications includ-
ing full-screen apps, or all open document windows for the active application, 
presenting them in an organized and unified view. Before you see how it works, 
look at Figure 8-7, which shows the Mission Control System Preferences pane, 
where you turn specific Mission Control features on and off and assign keyboard 
or mouse shortcuts to them.
The Mission Control pane: It’s painless
The top part of the pane contains four check boxes: Automatically Rearrange 
Spaces Based on Most Recent Use; When Switching to an Application, Switch to 
a Space with Open Windows for the Application; Group Windows by Application; 
and Displays Have Separate Spaces. If you’ve read Chapter 5, you know what the 
dashboard is all about. But because I haven’t introduced you to Spaces yet (but will 
shortly), for now just know that these check boxes do what you think they’ll do. 
You should experiment with the settings, turning them on and off, to see which 
way you prefer them.

174     PART 3  Getting Things Done
You can choose to display the dashboard as an overlay (the default, as shown in 
Chapter 5) or as a Space (which you’ll understand shortly). You can also choose Off 
if you never want to see the dashboard.
Moving right along, most of this pane handles keyboard and mouse shortcuts for 
Mission Control. The eight pop-up menus — four each for keyboard and mouse 
shortcuts — let you specify the trigger for each of the four Mission Control fea-
tures with a keystroke or mouse button. The default keyboard shortcuts appear in 
upcoming text, but yours may differ; to change them, click the appropriate pop-
up menu and make a new selection.
Hold down the ⌘  , Option, Control, and/or Shift keys when you choose an item 
from any of the eight shortcut menus to add modifier keys to the shortcuts you 
create. So, for example, if you were to hold down ⌘  +Shift when you select F11 from 
a pop-up menu, the keyboard shortcut for that feature would be ⌘  +Shift+F11. Or if 
you were to hold down Shift when you select Middle Mouse Button from a pop-up 
menu, you’d have to hold down Shift and click the middle mouse button to invoke 
the command.
Finally, most Apple keyboards made since April 2007 also include dedicated Mis-
sion Control and dashboard shortcut keys (F3 and F4, respectively). If you see a 
tiny picture that looks like the Mission Control icon (shown in the margin) on your 
F3 key or that looks like the Dashboard icon on your F4 key, you can use them in 
addition to the other shortcuts discussed in this section.
A picture is worth a thousand words, so check out Figures 8-8 and 8-9 as you read 
about each feature.

»
» To see Mission Control, which displays all open windows in all open applica-
tions, as shown in Figure 8-8, press Control+↑ (up arrow).
»
» To see all open windows belonging to the current application (TextEdit in 
Figure 8-9), press Control+↓ (down arrow).
»
» If you hover your cursor over a window on a Mission Control screen, a blue 
border appears around the item you’re hovering over (a TextEdit document in 
Figure 8-8 and Chapter 06 in Figure 8-9). If you then press the spacebar, you’ll 
see a preview of the window’s contents, which is especially helpful when a 
window is partially obscured by another window.
»
» To hide all open windows so you can see icons on the desktop, press F11 or 
Fn+F11.
»
» To summon forth the dashboard (which displays your widgets, as I explain in 
Chapter 5), press F12 (or Fn+F12). Or if your F4 key has a Dashboard icon 
printed on it, press F4.
Note that when you’re using Mission Control, windows appear as reduced-size 
thumbnails. Identifying information — either the program or window name — 
appears below the mini-window, making it easier to discern what each item con-
tains. When you click any of these small windows, Mission Control deactivates, 
and the window you clicked becomes the active window.
FIGURE 8-8:

176     PART 3  Getting Things Done
One last thing: If you use a trackpad, check out the More Gestures tab in the Track-
pad System Preferences pane, where you can enable a three- or four-fingered 
swipe upward to invoke Mission Control.
Hot corners!
In the bottom-left corner of the Mission Control System Preferences pane is a Hot 
Corners button, which lets you designate any or all of the corners of your screen as 
hot spots to trigger Mission Control, the dashboard, Launchpad, Screen Saver, or 
Display Sleep. Click the menu for a corner, and select the feature you want associ-
ated with that corner. Then, whenever you move your pointer onto that corner and 
leave it there for a second or two, the feature executes.
Hot corners have been part of Mac OS since time immemorial and are still as use-
ful as ever. For example, I like to set the top-right corner to start my screen saver 
and the bottom-right corner to disable it.
Mission Control is enabled by default, but you can disable any or all of its features 
by turning off its trigger: Just choose the minus sign from a pop-up menu instead 
of a keyboard shortcut.

Mission Control’s Spaces from  
30,000 feet (an overview)
If Mission Control lets you manage your windows in real time, its spaces let you 
manage windows by organizing them in groups called desktops, and switch from 
desktop to desktop with a keystroke or trackpad gesture.
In earlier versions of macOS, these desktops were called spaces. Mission Control, 
improbably, uses the words spaces and desktops interchangeably, so as you see 
in Figure 8-10, my three spaces are named Desktop 1, Desktop 2, and Desktop 3.  
I think it’s dumb, and I’m going to continue to call a space a space regardless of 
what Mission Control labels them (because calling them desktops would be even 
more confusing).
Think of a space as being a single screen, set up just the way you like it, with its 
windows arranged just the way you like them. When you use spaces, only two 
kinds of windows are shown in the space you’re using: windows from applications 
associated with the active space and windows from applications launched while 
that space is active.
By the way, apps running in full-screen mode are automatically considered a 
space, which bears the name of the app rather than Desktop x.
If you find yourself spending too much time moving and resizing windows 
onscreen, consider setting up spaces for specific tasks. You might have one space 
dedicated to a specific project, another for web surfing, and a third for email, each 
with all its windows arranged just the way you like them.
FIGURE 8-10: 
Mission 
Control 
showing off the 
dashboard and 
three spaces 
(Desktops 1, 2, 
and 3).

178     PART 3  Getting Things Done
Take, for example, the three spaces shown in Figure 8-10. I have one for web surf-
ing (Desktop 1), one for Mail (Desktop 2), and one for working in Finder (Desktop 
3), each with its windows arranged exactly as I like ’em.
Moving right along, you manage your spaces with Mission Control, which pro-
vides an overview of what’s running on your Mac, including all your spaces, the 
dashboard, and all open windows. In a nutshell, this dynamic duo makes it easier 
than ever to manage and maintain the mélange of Finder and application windows 
that conspire to clutter and eventually consume your screen.
To see spaces in action, press the Mission Control key (Control+↑ by default). If 
you have a trackpad, you can also swipe upward using three fingers to see Mission 
Control, which will look something like Figure 8-10 based on the three spaces just 
described. If you don’t see the thumbnail pictures above the names Dashboard and 
Desktop, hover your cursor over them and the thumbnails will appear like magic.
Note that you won’t see a dashboard space in Mission Control unless you’ve 
selected As Space from the Dashboard pop-up menu in the Mission Control  
System Preferences pane.
To add a new space, first enter Mission Control; then move the pointer to the top-
right corner of the screen and click the Add (+) button. Note that if you have your 
dock on the right side of the screen, you have to move your pointer to the top-left 
corner for the + to appear.
You can use this technique to add as many spaces as you like. When you’re fin-
ished using Mission Control, you can
»
» Click a space at the top of the screen to switch to it.
or
»
» Press the Mission Control key, press the Esc key, or swipe upward with three 
or four fingers to return to the space you were using when you entered 
Mission Control.
The three-finger gesture requires a Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, or laptop with 
a buttonless trackpad.
If you’re using a notebook Mac, I implore you to learn to use gestures with Mis-
sion Control. Visit the Trackpad System Preferences pane’s More Gestures tab and 
make sure you’ve enabled three- or four-finger swipes. I love swiping between 
Mission Control spaces like the ones in Figure  8-10. Swipe, and I’ve got Mail; 
swipe again, and I’ve got Safari; swipe again, and I have Finder. Try it — I think 
you’ll like swiping to switch spaces (desktops) as much as I do.

CHAPTER 8  Four Terrific Timesaving Tools     179
One last thing: macOS High Sierra takes full advantage of multiple displays no 
matter how many displays are connected to your Mac. So, for example, you can 
work in Finder’s desktop on one display and use a full screen app on another. And 
finally, each display has its own exclusive set of Mission Control spaces associated 
with it.
You can drag and drop spaces from one display to another. Try it — it’s way cool!
Getting around in space(s)
The preceding section shows you one way to move from one space to another — 
enter Mission Control, and click the space you want to use. You can also navigate 
spaces in the following ways:
»
» Press the Control key and ← (left-arrow key) or → (right-arrow key) to move to 
the previous or next space.
»
» Swipe left or right with three fingers to move to the next or previous space.
You can enable or disable these keyboard shortcuts in the Shortcuts tab of the 
Keyboard System Preferences pane.
There will be times when you want to move a window from one space to another. 
To do so:
»
» Drag a window to the top of the screen; when Mission Control appears, drag it 
onto a different space (desktop).
»
» Press and hold down the mouse button on the window you want to move 
while pressing the Control key and the
•	 Left-arrow key (←) to move the window to the space on the left of the 
current space
•	 Right-arrow key (→) to move the window to the space on the right of the 
current space
or
»
» Start in the space that has the window you want to move. Enter Mission 
Control, drag the window from the middle part of the screen onto the space 
you want to move it to at the top of the screen, and then release the mouse 
button.

180     PART 3  Getting Things Done
Finally, should you want to delete one or more spaces, simply enter Mission Con-
trol, and move the pointer over the space. A Delete button — an X that should look 
familiar if you use the dashboard or an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch — appears in 
its top-left corner, as shown for Desktop 3 in Figure 8-10. Click it to delete that 
space.
Deleting a space doesn’t delete or quit any applications or close any documents. 
Applications and windows in a deleted space move to the space called desktop (the 
one without a numeric suffix).
The bottom line is that spaces can be particularly useful for those with a smaller 
display. And it can be even more useful for users with more than one display.
Using Mission Control can be an acquired taste, so even if you have a small screen 
or multiple screens, you may not care for it at first. My advice: Try it for a while, 
and if you decide that you hate it, turn its triggers off (by selecting the minus sign) 
and be done with it.
Launchpad: The Place for Applications
Launchpad presents all the applications in your Applications folder in a view that 
looks like the home screen of any iOS device (that is, iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch). 
In fact, if you use one of these devices, I suspect that you could skip everything 
that follows about Launchpad, because it works almost exactly like the home 
screen on an iPhone or other iDevice.
Click the Launchpad dock icon (shown in the margin). It fills your screen with big, 
beautiful application icons, as shown in Figure 8-11.
I changed my desktop picture from plain gray to the default High Sierra picture for 
Figure 8-11. The photo is actually in focus; the nifty blur effect happens only when 
Launchpad is active. Sure, it’s just eye candy, but it’s elegant eye candy.
If your Launchpad has more than one page of apps, you can press ⌘  + left-arrow 
(←) or right-arrow (→) to move to the previous or next page or click and flick left 
or right. Trackpad users can also use a three-finger swipe left or right to move 
from page to page.
To launch an app, just click its icon. In a heartbeat, Launchpad disappears, and the 
app replaces it on your screen.

CHAPTER 8  Four Terrific Timesaving Tools     181
Launchpad is configurable, just like home screens on iDevices. As you’re about to 
see, you can rearrange app icons on a page, move them from one page to another, 
organize them in folders, and delete them. Say it all together now: “Just like on 
iDevices.”
For those who are unfamiliar with iOS or devices that run it, here’s how these 
things work on your Mac:
»
» To find an app: Type the first few characters of its name in the search box at 
the top of the screen.
»
» To rearrange app icons: Click and drag the app to its new location.
»
» To move apps to the next or previous page: Click and drag the app to the 
left or right edge of the screen. When the next page of apps appears, drag the 
app to its new location on that page.
»
» To add an app to your dock: Click and drag the app onto the left side of the 
dock.
»
» To create a folder for apps: Drag one app’s icon on top of another app’s icon 
to create a folder (such as Other in Figure 8-11).
»
» To add an app to a folder: Drag the app onto that folder to add it.
»
» To move an app out of a folder: Click the folder to open it and drag the app 
out of the folder.
»
» To change a folder’s name: Click to open the folder, click the current name, 
and then type a new name.
FIGURE 8-11:

182     PART 3  Getting Things Done
»
» To uninstall apps: Click an app’s icon, but don’t release the mouse button 
until all the icons begin to wiggle. Apps that can be uninstalled display a Delete 
button (X); click to uninstall the app.
»
» To stop the wiggling: Press Esc.
If an icon doesn’t have a Delete button, it’s installed with macOS High Sierra and 
can’t be uninstalled.
And last but not least, some items in the Applications and Utilities folders on your 
startup disk will be found in a folder named Other in Launchpad. Why? Which 
apps and for what reason? Who knows?

Organizing Your Life
W
hen you install macOS High Sierra, the folks at Apple generously 
include applications that can help simplify and organize your everyday 
affairs — Calendar, Reminders, and Notes (to name three you discover 
in this chapter).
In fact, macOS High Sierra comes with a folder full of applications — software you 
can use to do everything from surfing the Internet to capturing an image of your 
Mac’s screen to playing QuickTime movies to performing numeric calculations.
Technically, most of these applications aren’t even part of macOS. Rather, the vast 
majority of them are what are known as bundled apps — programs that come with 
the operating system but are unrelated to its function. Readers (bless them) tend 
to complain when I skip bundled applications, so I mention almost all of them in 
this book.
But in this chapter, you get a look at only the applications that help you organize 
your everyday life — appointments, to-do items, notes to yourself — and how to 
keep them in sync with the various iDevices you may attach to and detach from 
your Mac.

The applications discussed in this chapter are stored in (where else?) the Applica-
tions folder, which you can get to in four ways:
»
» Click the Applications folder in the sidebar of any Finder window.
»
» Choose Go  ➪  Applications from Finder.
»
» Press ⌘  +Shift+A in Finder.
»
» Click the Launchpad icon on the dock to see all the applications installed on 
this Mac (refer to Chapter 8).
Other bundled apps you might be especially interested in include Safari  
(Chapter  12), Contacts (Chapter  13), Mail (Chapter  14), iTunes (Chapter  16), a 
whole handful of multimedia applications that enable you to play video and more 
on your Mac, including Preview, which lets you view and annotate PDF and other 
image files (Chapter 17), and TextEdit (Chapter 18).
Keeping Track with Calendar
Calendar is a wonderful program that provides multiple appointment calendars 
with alerts. More precisely, you can have multiple color-coded calendars; several 
types of visual, audible, and emailed alerts; repeating events; and more. You can 
publish your calendar(s) on the web for others to view (which requires an iCloud 
account or other WebDAV server), and you can subscribe to calendars published 
by other Calendar users.
I love Calendar and keep it open most of the time on my Macs. In the sections that 
follow, I share some of the features I find most useful.
Navigating Calendar views
Calendar lets you display the main Calendar window just the way you like it:
»
» You can view your calendar by the day, week, month, or year. Figure 9-1 
shows a weekly view. To select a view, click the Day, Week, Month, or Year 
button at the top.
»
» To move back or forward, click the arrow buttons on either side of the Today 
button (upper right). You see the previous or next week in Week view, 
yesterday or tomorrow in day view, and so on.
»
» To go to today’s date, click the Today button.

CHAPTER 9  Organizing Your Life     185
»
» To add a new calendar, choose File ➪ New Calendar or use its keyboard 
shortcut, Command + Option + N.
You can find all these items, most of which have shortcuts, in the Calendar appli-
cation’s View menu, as shown in Figure 9-2. This menu offers almost total control 
of what you see and how you navigate.
If you want to master Calendar, it would behoove you to spend some time experi-
menting with these views and with their navigation commands and options.
Creating calendars
If you refer to Figure 9-1, you see a list of my calendars in the top-left corner: 
Bob’s Appointments, Family, Bob’s Teaching Schedule, Bob’s Deadlines, Bob’s 
Travel, and so on. The check boxes turn the visibility of a calendar on (selected) 
and off (deselected).
To create a calendar in Calendar, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose File  ➪  New Calendar.
If you have more than one account enabled in Calendar  ➪  Preferences  ➪   
Accounts or the Internet Accounts System Preferences pane, choose File  ➪   
New Calendar  ➪  iCloud (or whichever account you want to use for this calendar).
A new calendar named Untitled is created and added to the appropriate 
account in the sidebar.

2.	 To give your calendar a name, select Untitled and type a new name.
3.	 (Optional) To color-code the entries for this calendar, right-click or 
Control-click it in the sidebar to select a color from its shortcut menu.
In my humble opinion, Custom Color is the coolest choice because it lets you 
select from thousands of colors — including the lovely shade of fuchsia I use 
for my Bob’s Appointments calendar.
If you have an iCloud account, you can publish your calendars and invite others to 
subscribe to them by right- or Control-clicking the iCloud calendar in the list and 
choosing Share Calendar. The invitees receive an email asking them to subscribe 
to your calendar. This is what my family does. Each of us maintains and publishes 
his or her own calendar and subscribes to everyone else’s. That way, we can all see 
at a glance who’s doing what and when they’re doing it. This is by far the slickest 
solution we’ve found.
Deleting a calendar
To delete a calendar, select it in the list and press ⌘  +Delete. An alert will appear 
to ask if you’re sure.
This alert has a useful button, Merge, which provides an opportunity to merge the 
calendar with another rather than just blowing it (and all the events it contains) away.
FIGURE 9-2: 
The Calendar 
application’s 
View menu.

CHAPTER 9  Organizing Your Life     187
Click Merge to select another calendar to merge this one with, click Delete to 
delete it, or click Cancel to do neither. Note that you can’t merge calendars you 
subscribe to such as Found in Apps, Birthdays, US Holidays, and others—you can 
only turn them off.
When you delete a calendar, all the events and reminder items in that calendar 
are also deleted. Although you can undo a deleted calendar (choose Edit  ➪  Undo or 
press ⌘  +Z), you must do so before you quit Calendar. If you quit Calendar without 
undoing a calendar deletion, everything on that calendar (or calendars) will be 
gone forever (unless, of course, you have Time Machine or another backup, as I 
explain in Chapter 21).
If you sync your calendars with iCloud or another cloud-based service, the calen-
dar will be deleted from all your devices.
Creating and managing events
The heart of Calendar is the event. To create a new one, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose File  ➪  New Event, press ⌘  +N, double-click a date on the calendar 
in any view, or drag up or down anywhere on a date in Week or Day view.
If you double-click or click and drag on the day of the event, you can skip Step 
2, and you don’t need to specify the date in Step 3.
Alternatively, try the Create Quick Event (+) button. It’s smart enough to 
interpret commands like “Family Movie 7–10PM Thursday” and create a new 
event on the proper day and time, as shown in Figure 9-3.
2.	 If the event doesn’t appear in the proper place, just click it and drag it 
wherever you like.
3.	 To edit an event, select it and choose Edit  ➪  Edit Event, press ⌘  +E, or 
double-click it to open its event bubble, as shown in Figure 9-3.
All the items can be edited. For example, click the date or time to change it. The 
other items — Repeat, Travel Time, and Alerts — are pop-up menus. The Alert 
menu is popped up in Figure 9-3. The fuchsia square in the upper-right corner 
of the event bubble is also a pop-up menu, which lets you select a different 
calendar for this event.
The Travel Time item lets you add travel time to and from an event (and blocks 
out that time on your calendar) while preserving the event’s start and end times.
4.	 When you’re satisfied with all of the event’s items, press Return or click 
anywhere outside the event bubble.

188     PART 3  Getting Things Done
If you prefer working in a little window rather than the event bubble, check out 
the Edit  ➪  Show Inspector command (⌘  +Option+I), which displays the selected 
event in a window. Click a different event on a calendar, and that event’s info 
instantly fills the Inspector window. Try it; you might like it.
What’s the difference between the Get Info and Inspector windows? The Inspector 
window changes contextually and displays information about the currently selected 
event. Get Info windows, on the other hand, display info for a specific event. Put 
another way, a Get Info window displays the info for a specific event, and you can 
have as many Get Info windows on the screen as you like. There’s only one Inspec-
tor window, though, and it displays info for whichever event is currently selected.
Inviting others to attend an event
To invite other people to your event, 
open Contacts or the Calendar Address 
Panel (Window  ➪  Address Panel or 
⌘  +Option+A) and drag the contacts 
onto the event in Calendar. Alterna-
tively, you can type the first few letters 
of the name in the Invitees field, and 
names that match magically appear. In 
Figure 9-4, I typed the letters Stan L,  
and Calendar offered me a choice of 
my two contacts with names that start 
with Stan L — Stan LeVitus and Stan 
Lee. Sweet! (If you’re unfamiliar with 
Contacts, flip to Chapter 14 for details.)
After you add one or more invitees, 
click the Send button to invite them to the event. If the invitees have a compatible 
calendar application (Calendar, its predecessor iCal, Microsoft Outlook, and most 
calendar programs on most platforms), they can open the enclosure (included with 
your invitation email), which adds the event to Calendar with Accept, Decline, and 
Maybe buttons. All they have to do is click the appropriate button, and you receive 
FIGURE 9-3:

(upper left) and

(lower right) 
for this three-
hour event on 
my Appoint-
ment calendar.
FIGURE 9-4: 
Invite people to your event.

CHAPTER 9  Organizing Your Life     189
an email informing you of their decision along with an enclosure that adds their 
response to the event in Calendar. Nice, eh?
It doesn’t always work with some third-party mail programs, but the majority of 
people use either Apple Mail or Microsoft Outlook, which both do the right thing 
with Calendar invitations.
If the invitee doesn’t have a compatible calendar app (or doesn’t open the enclo-
sure that was included with the email invitation), he or she has to respond the 
old-fashioned way: by replying to your email or calling you on the telephone.
Setting an alert
What’s the point of putting an event on your calendar if you forget it? If you set an 
alert, Calendar won’t let you forget. To set an alert, click None (just to the right of 
the word alert) in the Event info window or Inspector, as I did in Figure 9-3. A menu 
appears; choose a time for the alert from the menu or choose Custom for more options. 
I find the custom Email alerts so useful that I use them for almost every event I create.
You can have as many alerts as you like for each event. When you add the first alert 
to an event, a +-in-a-circle will appear to its right when you hover the cursor over 
the alert pop-up menu; click the + to create a second (or third or fifteenth) alert.
To remove an alert, click the pop-up menu to the right of the word alert and 
choose None from the pop-up menu.
You can choose separate default alerts for Events, All Day Events, and Birthdays in  
Calendar Preferences. Choose Calendar  ➪  Preferences or press ⌘  +, (type the 
comma), and then click the Alerts tab at the top of the window.
All the features mentioned so far are wonderful, but my favorite Calendar feature is 
the alert. I rarely miss an important event anymore; Calendar reminds me of them 
with time to spare. Better still, I sync events and alerts among my Mac and iPhone 
and iPad. I can create an event or alert, and within a few minutes — through the 
magic of iCloud — it appears on the other devices, as shown in Figure 9-5.
FIGURE 9-5:

Mac (left) and 
iPhone (right).

190     PART 3  Getting Things Done
Reminders: Protection Against Forgetting
Reminders will be familiar to anyone with an iDevice because it bears more than a 
passing resemblance to the iOS Reminders app.
Reminders help you stay organized. Unlike an event, a reminder item isn’t neces-
sarily associated with a particular day or time (although it can be). Furthermore, 
reminders can be location-based, which is handier on an iDevice than a Mac, but a 
great feature if you have such a device. Finally, reminders can have a priority level 
of low, medium, high, or none.
If you have an iDevice and sync with iCloud, Microsoft Exchange, or Office 365, 
your reminders will appear simultaneously on all your Apple devices  — other 
Macs, iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches — which means you should never miss a 
reminder. Just set a reminder on your Mac or any iDevice, and you’ll never forget 
anything.
Getting started with Reminders
Before you create or manage your own reminders, you should know a couple of 
things, starting with the concept of lists. Reminders includes a list called Remind-
ers by default. You can delete or rename it if you like, and you can create additional 
lists if you care to by choosing File  ➪  New List, pressing ⌘  +L, or clicking the plus 
button at the bottom of the window.
I like to have a bunch of lists with names like Sooner, Later, Out and About, and 
so on. And Reminders creates a section for completed items at the top of the list 
when you click the circle before each reminder’s name to indicate a task is done, 
like A completed reminder and Another completed reminder in Figure 9-6.
In other words, when you select the box for an item, the item is moved to that 
list’s Completed list.
FIGURE 9-6: 
When a list (To 
Do – Sooner) is 
selected in the 
List sidebar, its 
reminders are 
displayed on 
the right.

CHAPTER 9  Organizing Your Life     191
Here are more helpful techniques for working with lists:
»
» To rename a list: Right- or Control-click the list, choose Rename from the 
contextual menu, type the new name, and press Return when you’re done. Or 
select the list, press Return, type the new name, and then press Return again 
when you’re done.
»
» To display a list in a separate window: Double-click the list name; right- or 
Control-click the list, and choose Open List in New Window from the contex-
tual menu; choose Window  ➪  Open in New Window; or press ⌘  +Return.
»
» To show or hide the little calendar: Choose View  ➪  Show/Hide Calendar or 
press ⌘  +Option+K.
»
» To show or hide the List sidebar: Choose View  ➪  Show/Hide Sidebar or 
press ⌘  +Option+S.
You don’t have to have more than one list. You don’t even have to change the default 
list name (Reminders). That being said, I like having Reminders organized into sep-
arate To-Do lists. The point is that you can make a bunch of lists or dump everything 
into a single list; just use lists to organize your reminders so they make sense to you.
To do or not to do: Setting reminders
The preceding sections tell you pretty much everything about reminders except how to 
create one, so it’s time to find out how to create a reminder. It couldn’t be easier: Just 
choose File  ➪  New Reminder; press ⌘  +N; click the plus button in the top-right corner 
of the Reminders window; or click the first blank line in any list and begin typing.
Ah, but there’s much more to a reminder (see Figure 9-7). Reminders can
»
» Remind you at a specific time on a specific date.
»
» Repeatedly remind you at a specified interval.
»
» Remind you at a specific location (great for iPhone and cellular iPad owners).
The first time you try to use At a Location, your Mac will present a dialog ask-
ing whether you want to Enable Location Services to Allow “Reminders” to Use 
Your Current Location. If you agree, you’re done. If you disagree and don’t want 
to enable Location Services for the Reminder app, just click the Cancel button. 
Finally, if you want to enable Location Services at a later date, open the Security 
& Privacy System Preferences pane and click the Privacy tab. Click the lock and 
provide your password if necessary, then click Location Services in the list on the 
left, make sure the Enable Location Services check box is enabled, and then enable 
the check box for Reminders. Close the System Preferences app and you’re done.

192     PART 3  Getting Things Done
If you have an iPhone, location-based reminders are awesome. Give them a try, 
and I’m sure you’ll be as hooked as I am.
And reminders can also have a priority and notes. To access these features, you 
need to Show Info for the reminder by choosing View  ➪  Show Info; pressing ⌘  +I; 
clicking the little i that appears on the right side of the reminder (hover your cur-
sor over the right side of the reminder if you don’t see it); or double-click a blank 
spot on the reminder.
Finally, to reorder reminders in a list, click a blank spot on any reminder, drag it 
up or down, and drop it into its new position.
Everything You Need to Know  
about Notification Center
The item on the right in Figure 9-8 should look familiar to those of you who use 
an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch — it’s the Mac version of Notification Center.
Notification Center manages and displays alerts from apps that support it. You can 
make it appear regardless of what application is currently active by clicking its 
menu bar icon (shown in the margin) or swiping from the very right edge of the 
trackpad to the left with two fingers.
You manage notifications in the Notifications System Preferences pane. Choose 
  ➪  System Preferences or click the System Preferences icon in the dock and then 
click the Notifications icon.
FIGURE 9-7: 
Reminders are 
indeed handy.

CHAPTER 9  Organizing Your Life     193
Or click the little gear at the bottom-right of Notification Center, which is a short-
cut that opens the Notifications Preferences pane instantly.
In the Notification Center System Preferences pane, you’ll find all the apps on 
your hard drive that support the Notification Center protocol in a list on the left. 
To specify settings for an app, click it in the list. After you select an app, here’s 
what you can do:
»
» To have an app’s notifications not appear in Notification Center: Deselect 
the Show in Notification Center check box, or drag the app down to the Not in 
Notification Center section of the list.
»
» To change how apps are sorted in Notification Center: Choose Manually 
or By Time from the Sort Notification Center pop-up menu. Choose Manually 
if you prefer to arrange the order the apps appear in Notification Center by 
dragging them up or down (my preference); choose By Time to sort them with 
the most recent ones at the top.
»
» To specify the alert style for the app: Your choices are Banners, Alerts, or 
None. Alerts stay onscreen until you dismiss them; Banners appear in the 
upper-right corner of the screen below the Notification Center icon and fade 
away a few seconds after they appear.
»
» To see the number of new notifications for the app on its dock icon: 
Select the Badge App Icon check box.

»
» To hear a sound when receiving notifications: Select the Play Sound when 
Receiving Notifications check box.
»
» To specify the number of recent items that Notification Center displays 
for the app: Click the Show in Notification Center pop-up menu and choose 1, 
5, 10, or 20 recent items.
One more item in the Notifications System Preferences pane is worth mentioning: 
the Do Not Disturb button, at the top of the list of apps. Click it to temporarily 
silence alerts and banners during the specified hours. Or temporarily enable Do 
Not Disturb: Option-click the Notification Center icon on the menu bar, which 
turns gray to indicate that alerts and banners are suspended. Option-click the 
Notification Center icon again to disable Do Not Disturb.
The Today tab (refer to Figure 9-8, right) is sweet, offering a helpful list of upcoming 
events, reminders, weather, stock prices, and other information you may find useful.
To manage what you see in the Today tab, click the Edit button at the very bottom. 
The Today panel slides to the left to reveal a list of additional items that you can add 
to your Today panel, as shown in Figure 9-9. While these items are visible, you can 
change the order of items in the Today tab by dragging them up or down in the list.
FIGURE 9-9:

CHAPTER 9  Organizing Your Life     195
Before you leave Edit mode, you might want to check out third-party items (wid-
gets) for your Notification Center by clicking the App Store button at the bottom. 
When you’re happy with your Today tab, click the Done button.
Now, here’s a quick rundown of ways you can use Notification Center:
»
» To respond to a notification: Click the banner or alert before it disappears. 
Or open Notification Center, click the Notifications tab, and then click the 
notification to launch its app.
If you hover the pointer over banners, you may see additional options such as 
the ability to reply to an email or 
message without launching Mail or 
Messages. Give it a try!
»
» To repeat a notification in nine 
minutes: Click its Snooze button.
»
» To close all notifications for an 
app: Hover the pointer over the 
right side of the app’s name in the 
Notifications tab, and click the little 
x when it appears, as shown in 
Figure 9-10.
Use Notes for Making Notes
Notes is an electronic notepad for your Mac. A note is a convenient place to jot 
quick notes, recipes, phone numbers, or whatever. Some notes are shown in 
Figure 9-11.
To create a new note, choose File  ➪  New Note; press ⌘  +N; or click the button 
with the little square and pencil in the toolbar.
Notes is supremely flexible; here are just a few things you can do:
»
» Double-click a note to open it in its own window so you can drag it around 
onscreen by its title bar.
After opening a note in its own window, if you want the note to float in front 
of other windows so it’s always visible, choose Window  ➪  Float on Top.
FIGURE 9-10: 
Click the x to close all notifications for the app.

196     PART 3  Getting Things Done
»
» Change text to any font, color, size, and style by selecting it and using the 
myriad of tools in the Format menu.
»
» Search for a word or phrase in any note by typing your query in the search 
box.
»
» Create bulleted, numbered, or dashed lists by selecting the text and 
choosing Format  ➪  Font  ➪  Lists. (Ingredients is a bulleted list, and Directions 
is a numbered list in Figure 9-11.)
»
» Create folders (Notes and More Notes in Figure 9-11) to organize your notes 
by choosing File  ➪  New Folder, pressing ⌘  +Shift+N, or clicking the New 
Folder button at the bottom of the Folder list.
FIGURE 9-11: 
Notes is for 
making notes 
on your Mac.

CHAPTER 9  Organizing Your Life     197
The Notes window must be selected to create a folder. If a note in a window is 
active, the New Folder command will be unavailable. So click the main Notes 
window if the New Folder command is grayed out. Or click the New Note 
button in the toolbar, which is enabled even when working with a note in a 
separate window.
Folders in the Notes application are exclusive to Notes. In other words, the 
folders described in the following bullets aren’t folders in Finder. You won’t 
find them on your hard drive; they live only in the Notes app (and iCloud or 
other Internet accounts if you’ve enabled them). And also remember that 
folders are optional. If you don’t have a ton of notes, keeping them all in a 
single folder and using the search box to filter them may work for you.
»
» Show or hide the Folders list by choosing View  ➪  Show/Hide Folders or 
clicking the Show/Hide Folders button in the toolbar.
»
» Show only notes in a folder by clicking the folder name in the Folders list, or 
click All iCloud to see all your notes.
»
» Automatically sync notes with your iDevice by using iCloud or other 
Internet Accounts by choosing Notes  ➪  Accounts, which will open the 
Internet Accounts System Preferences pane; then click the appropriate 
Internet account — such as Office 365 or Gmail — and enable its check box to 
sync Notes.
»
» Send the contents of a note via the Mail or Messages app by choosing 
File  ➪  Share or clicking the Share icon.
»
» Print a note by choosing File  ➪  Print or pressing ⌘  +P.
Whatever you type in a note is saved automatically as you type it, so Notes has no 
Save, Save As, or Duplicate commands.
Moving right along, here are more useful features in Notes:
»
» You can drag and drop photos, PDFs, videos, and other files into any note.
»
» The Attachments browser displays every external file you’ve dragged into 
every note in a single place, making it easier to find things. Choose 
View ➪ Show/Hide Attachments Browser, use its keyboard shortcut 
Command+1, or click the Attachments button in the toolbar to see this feature 
in action.
»
» Use the Share menu in apps such as Safari and Maps to add content to Notes.
»
» You can add checklists (in addition to bulleted, numbered, and dashed lists), 
as shown in the to-do list in the middle of Figure 9-11, by clicking the Checklist 
button in the toolbar, by choosing Format  ➪  Checklist, or by using the 
shortcut ⌘  +Shift+L.

198     PART 3  Getting Things Done
And here are three new features in High Sierra:
»
» You can add a table to any note by choosing Format ➪ Table, by using its 
keyboard shortcut, Command+Option+T, or by clicking the Table button in 
the toolbar.
»
» You can format text as a title, 
heading, or body by choosing 
Format ➪ Title, Heading, or Body  
or using their keyboard  
shortcuts Command+Shift+T, 
Command+Shift+H,  
or Command+Shift+B, respectively, 
as shown in Figure 9-12.
»
» Notes appear in the list in chrono-
logical order with the most recently 
created note on top. You can now pin a note to the top of the list, where it 
remains until you unpin it. Select a note and choose File ➪ Pin Note (or Unpin 
Note), or right- or Control-click the note in the list and choose Pin Note (or 
Unpin Note).
You can also share your notes with others and allow them to edit them. Here’s 
how it works: Click the Add People button in the toolbar and choose how you’d like 
to send your invitation: Mail, Messages, Twitter, Facebook, AirDrop, or LinkedIn.
If the person you invite is also running High Sierra, she’ll see the note in her copy 
of Notes; if she’s running any other operating system, the note will open in the 
iCloud website for editing. When she’s done, you’ll see her edits in Notes on your 
Mac within a few minutes.
Other Notes goodies include a spell checker, spoken notes, text substitutions (such 
as smart quotes and smart dashes), and transformations (such as Make Upper or 
Lowercase). You can find all these options on the Edit menu.
You now know everything you need to know to use and enjoy High Sierra’s Notes 
app!

CHAPTER 10  Siri-ously!     199
Siri-ously!
I
f you aren’t familiar with Siri, Apple’s intelligent digital assistant, you will be 
soon. Though Siri made her first appearance on the iPhone 4s back in 2011 
and has appeared on iPads, iPod touches, and even Apple TVs, it made its first 
appearance on the Mac last year in macOS Sierra.
Siri was designed to help you get things done using your voice, and the new Mac 
incarnation does it with aplomb. High Sierra’s rendition of Siri offers new capa-
bilities designed specifically for your Mac, which means you can search for infor-
mation, find files, send messages, and much, much more using only your voice.
Better still, High Sierra’s Siri is optimized to work well with your Mac’s built-in 
microphone, so you have everything you need to start using it.
What Siri Can Do for You
Before we get to the “how,” let’s look at what, exactly, Siri can do for you. Here’s 
a short list of some cool things you can ask Siri to do:
»
» “Open the Microsoft Word document I worked on yesterday.”
»
» “Remind me to take the pizza out of the oven in 14 minutes.”
»
» “Add a meeting to my calendar at 11 a.m. tomorrow with Dr. Spock.”

»
» “Call Jacob LeVitus with FaceTime.”
»
» “Play songs by The Beatles.” This one works only if you have songs by The 
Beatles in your iTunes Library or subscribe to Apple Music, of course.
»
» “Call me ‘Your Highness.’” Replace "Your Highness” with, “Sir,” “Madam,” or 
anything else you like; Siri will refer to you by that name forevermore.
»
» “Who am I?” If you forget who you 
are, Siri will remind you, as shown 
in Figure 10-1.
»
» “Call my wife on her cellphone.”
»
» “What song is this?” If you’ve ever 
used Shazam to identify songs, Siri 
uses its technology. So, like the 
Shazam app, it can identify millions 
of songs after a brief listen.
»
» “Send a message to Lisa to 
reschedule dinner tomorrow.”
»
» “Find an ATM near here.”
»
» “Send an email to Jack Black 
that says, ‘You rock.’”
»
» “Show me pictures I took in 
Florence Italy” or “Show me all 
the pictures I took on 
Thanksgiving.”
»
» “What is the Dow at?”
»
» “Send a tweet: ‘Going on 
vacation. Smiley-face.’” Siri will 
replace “Smiley-face” with a 
smiley-face emoji in the tweet.
»
» “I need directions to House of Blues.”
»
» “Who was the 19th president of the United States?”
»
» “How many calories are in a blueberry muffin?”
»
» “Wake me up at 8:30 in the morning.”
»
» “Who is pitching for the Yankees tonight?”
»
» “Who won the Academy Award for Best Actor in 2003?”
»
» “What is trending on Twitter?”
FIGURE 10-1: 
Siri knows who I am and what to call me.

CHAPTER 10  Siri-ously!     201
Tap the little question mark in a circle in the lower-left corner of Siri’s speech 
bubbles to see even more things you can ask.
Siri is relatively intelligent and understands many things in context. So, for 
example, if you ask, “Will I need an umbrella this weekend?” Siri will grok that 
you’re looking for a weather forecast. Siri is also smart about using your personal 
information, so you can say, “Remind me to call Mom at 8 p.m.” When the time 
comes, Siri will offer a list of your mom’s phone numbers. And if Siri can’t deter-
mine who “Mom” is, she’ll ask you — and then, in the future, Siri will remember 
your mother.
You can also ask things such as, “What’s the traffic like around here?” or “Where 
can I get cheap gas around here?” Siri knows where, precisely, “here” is based on 
your Mac’s current location.
Now that you’ve had a glimpse of the kinds of things Siri will do for you, let’s dive 
in and take a look at how to actually use Siri.
Working with Siri
You can summon Siri in three easy ways: Click its dock or menu bar icon (shown 
in the margin), or use its keyboard shortcut: Press and hold down ⌘  +spacebar.
If you pressed and held down ⌘  +spacebar and Spotlight appeared instead of Siri, 
you didn’t press and hold down long enough. Keep both keys pressed for two or 
three seconds and Siri will be at your beck and call. Pressing and releasing them 
any faster summons Spotlight, not Siri.
Moving right along, when you’ve summoned Siri, a bubble will appear near the 
top-right corner of your screen, and Siri asks its favorite question: “What can  
I help you with?” as shown in Figure 10-2.
FIGURE 10-2: 
Speak now  
or Siri will  
bug you . . . .

202     PART 3  Getting Things Done
At this juncture, you need to start talking to your Mac. If you don’t, or if Siri can’t 
hear or understand you, a bubble asks you to clarify your intentions, as shown in 
Figure 10-3.
Tap the little question mark in a circle in the lower-left corner of Siri’s speech 
bubbles to see a list of more things you can ask.
That’s really all there is to it. Just remember two things: how to invoke Siri, and 
how to ask it a question or give it a command. That’s all. Well, that’s all except for 
one last thing: how to customize Siri to your liking.
Making Siri Your Own
Using Siri couldn’t be easier: You summon it, ask or tell it to do something, and 
then wait for that something to be done. But you can invoke several tweaks that 
can help make Siri sound and behave the way you prefer.
You manage Siri in its System Preferences pane (  ➪ System Preferences ➪ Siri), 
as shown in Figure 10-4.
FIGURE 10-3: 
If Siri doesn’t 
hear you or 
understand 
what you  
said, you’ll  
see something 
like this.

CHAPTER 10  Siri-ously!     203
You can’t change much, but here’s what you can customize and how to do it:
»
» Enable Talk to Siri check box: Deselect the box to disable Siri (it’s selected/
enabled by default).
»
» Keyboard Shortcut menu: If you don’t care for the default ⌘  +spacebar 
keyboard shortcut, this menu lets you change it to anything you like.
»
» Mic Input menu: Lets you specify a microphone other than your Mac’s 
internal one.
»
» Language menu: Use this menu to select the language Siri will speak and 
understand from a long list — including nine varieties of English; four varieties 
each of Chinese, French, and Spanish; and dozens of others.
Siri is known to have difficulty understanding people with distinct accents. If it 
has trouble understanding you, look in the Languages menu for a different 
version of the language. It couldn’t hurt, and it might just help.
»
» Siri Voice menu: Select the gender and nationality of your Siri. You can 
choose American (male or female), Australian (female or male), British (male 
or female), or Irish or South African (female only).
»
» Voice Feedback radio buttons: These buttons allow you to enable or disable 
voice feedback. Do you want to hear Siri’s dulcet tones? Click the On button. 
Do you prefer Siri keep its mouth shut? If so, click the Off button.
»
» Show Siri in Menu Bar check box: This option does what you’d expect — it 
allows you to disable Siri’s menu bar icon, which is enabled by default.
And that’s pretty much all you need to know to use and customize Siri in High 
Sierra.
I’d like to mention two more things before we move on:
»
» Siri requires an active Internet connection. If you aren’t connected to the 
Internet, you can’t use Siri.
»
» Although I mentioned that Siri isn’t great with heavily accented voices, I forgot 
to tell you that it’s just as bad at recognizing your words when your environ-
ment is noisy. If Siri misunderstands you frequently and changing languages 
didn’t help, try moving your face closer to your Mac and speaking in the 
direction of its microphone. Or try using a headset or other higher-quality 
microphone, which will almost certainly help.

Maps Are Where It’s At
T
he Maps application should look familiar to anyone who uses iOS devices, 
which have sported a Maps app since time immemorial. If you know how 
to use the Maps app on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, you already know 
most of what you need to know to use Maps on your Mac.
As for the rest of you — the ones without iOS devices — I’ll have you up to speed 
RealSoonNow™.
Finding your current location with Maps
I’ll start with something supremely simple yet extremely useful: determining 
your current location. At the risk of sounding like a self-help guru, here’s how to 
find yourself. Launch the Maps application from the dock, Launchpad, or Appli-
cations folder, and then click the Current Location button, which is a little black 
arrowhead (shown in the margin) and found to the left of the search field or Enter 
an Address field.
Your location is indicated by a blue dot. I clicked the arrowhead in the toolbar, and 
the blue dot displayed my location, as shown in Figure 11-1.

206     PART 3  Getting Things Done
If you tap or drag the map, your Mac continues to update your location but won’t 
recenter the blue marker — meaning that the blue dot can scroll (or zoom) off the 
screen. If that happens, click the Current Location button again to center the map 
on your current location again.
Of course, this and many other Maps features rely on an active Internet connec-
tion; if you’re not connected, Maps may not be able to help you.
Finding a person, place, or thing
To find a person, place, or thing with Maps, choose Edit ➪ Find, press ⌘  +F, or 
click in the search field in the center of the toolbar where it says, “Where do you 
want to go?” and type what you’re looking for. You can search for addresses, zip 
codes, intersections, towns, landmarks, and businesses by category and by name, 
or combinations, such as New York, NY 10022, pizza 60645, or Texas State Capitol.
If the letters you type match names stored in your Mac (or iDevice) Contacts app 
(see Chapter 13), the matching contacts appear in a list below the search field. 
Click a name to see a map of that contact’s location. The Maps app is smart about 
it, too, displaying only the names of contacts that have a street address.
If you don’t find a match in the list, press Return, and with any luck, a map will 
appear within a few seconds. If you search for a single location, it’s marked with a  
single pushpin. If you search for a category (BBQ Lockhart TX, for example), you see 
multiple pushpins, one for each matching location (BBQ joints in Lockhart, TX), 
as shown in Figure 11-2.
FIGURE 11-1: 
I am here.

CHAPTER 11  Maps Are Where It’s At     207
You can search for all sorts of things, including intersections, neighborhoods, land-
marks, restaurants, and businesses. Furthermore, you can combine several items, 
such as pizza and a zip code. The Maps app is adept at interpreting search terms and 
finding the right place. After you use the app a few times, you’ll be as addicted as I am.
To find out more, click a name in the list below the search field or click a pin.  
A little flag with the name of the location (Black’s Barbecue in Figure 11-2) appears. 
Click the i on the right side of a flag, and a window with information about the 
location appears, as shown in Figure 11-3.
This handy little info window sometimes contains reviews or photos or both (the 
one in Figure 11-3 has both), so you may have to scroll down to read reviews or 
see photos (as shown on the right). I’ll get to the four buttons at the bottom of the 
window shortly, but first take a look at how to navigate your Maps.

Views, zooms, and pans
The preceding section talks about how to find just about anything with Maps, and 
the following section shows ways to use what you find. But before doing that, 
I want to take a little detour and explore how you can work with Maps.
Two views are available — map or satellite — and both are available in 3D. You can 
choose a view by clicking one of the two tabs on the toolbar. Refer to Figure 11-1 
for map view and Figure 11-2 for a satellite view. Finally, check out Figure 11-4 for 
a satellite map in 3D.
3D maps aren’t available in every area. It appears that the more populated the 
area, the more likely it is available in 3D.
Speaking of which, here’s the scoop on 3D maps:
»
» To switch to a 3D map: Click the 3D button (shown in the margin), choose 
View ➪ 3D Map, or press ⌘  +0. You may have to zoom in for the map to 
appear in 3D.
»
» To zoom in: Choose View ➪ Zoom In or press ⌘  ++ (plus sign). If you have a 
trackpad, you can also expand (spread two fingers) to zoom in (just like on an 
iPhone).
»
» To zoom out: Choose View ➪ Zoom Out or press ⌘  +– (minus sign). If you 
have a trackpad, you can also pinch to zoom out (just like on an iPhone).
If you have a scroll-wheel mouse, you can use the wheel to zoom in and out.
»
» To scroll: Hold down the mouse or trackpad button and drag left, right, up, or 
down. If you have a trackpad, you can drag using two fingers.

CHAPTER 11  Maps Are Where It’s At     209
If you click and then fling your mouse in any direction (or flick with two fingers 
on a trackpad), you’ll “fly over” the ground below. It’s not particularly useful, 
but it looks cool.
»
» To adjust the camera angle or rotate the map: Press the Option key before 
you click and drag on the map.
»
» To scroll: Click and drag up, down, left, or right. If you have a trackpad, you 
can also drag two fingers in any direction to scroll.
Maps and Contacts
Maps and Contacts (see Chapter 13) go together like peanut butter and jelly. For 
example, if you want to see a map of a contact’s street address, type a few letters 
of the contact’s name in the search field and click the name in the list that auto-
matically appears.
If you’re in the Contacts app, it’s even easier: Hover your pointer over a street address 
and click the little blue icon that appears to its right, as shown in Figure 11-5. Maps 
will then open with a pin at the address.
After you find a location by typing an address in Maps, you can add that location to 
one of your contacts. Or you can create a new contact with a location you’ve found. 
To do either, click the location’s pushpin on the map and then click the little i to 
the right of the location’s name (Black’s Barbecue in Figure 11-2) to display its 
Info sheet, as shown in Figure 11-4.
FIGURE 11-5: 
Click the 
little blue icon 
to see this 
address in 
Maps.

210     PART 3  Getting Things Done
Now click the Create New Contact button on the Info sheet.
You can also get driving directions from most locations, including a contact’s 
address, to most other locations, including another contact’s address. You see 
how to do that in the “Smart map tricks” section, later in the chapter.
Finally, if you click in the search field and then click Favorites in the drop-down 
menu that appears, you’ll see your contacts and groups in a sidebar on the left. 
Click All Contacts or any group to see the contacts it contains.
Timesaving map tools: Favorites,  
Recents, and Contacts
The Maps app offers three tools that can save you from having to type the same 
locations over and over. All three are in the Favorites sheet, which appears when 
you click in the search field and then click Favorites in the drop-down list.
On the left side of the Favorites window is a list offering Favorites, Recents, and 
All Contacts; the following sections give you the lowdown on these useful options.
Apple is inconsistent. In Mavericks, favorites were called bookmarks; in Yosemite 
and Sierra, favorites are called favorites most of the time and bookmarks some of 
the time. Bottom line: A favorite is a bookmark, and a bookmark is a favorite. I’m 
going to go with favorites for the remainder of the chapter, but remember that a 
favorite is the same as a bookmark as far as Maps is concerned.
Favorites
Favorites in the Maps app, like favorites in Safari, lets you return to a location 
without typing a single character. To make a location a favorite, click the little i in 
a circle to the right of the location’s name or description to display the Info screen 
for that location. Then click the Add to Favorites button at the top of the Info sheet. 
It’s the little heart button, as shown in Figure 11-3 and in the margin.
You can also drop a pin (a kind of temporary favorite) anywhere on the map by 
clicking and holding down the mouse button for a couple of seconds. Or right-
click and choose Drop Pin from the menu.
After you drop a pin, you can click and drag it anywhere on the map. When the pin 
is where you want it, lift your finger off the mouse button or trackpad to drop the 
pin. To bookmark this location, click the little i to the right of the banner on the 
pin to open the Info sheet; click the Add to Favorites button to add the bookmark.

CHAPTER 11  Maps Are Where It’s At     211
After you add a favorite, you can recall it at any time. To do so, click in the search 
field, and click Favorites at the top of the sheet that appears. Then click the desired 
item in the list that appears.
The first items you should add as favorites are your home address and work 
address. You use these addresses all the time with Maps, so you might as well add 
them now to avoid typing them over and over.
To manage your favorites, first click the Edit button in the lower-right corner of 
the Favorites sheet. Then you can do the following:
»
» To move a favorite up or down in the Favorites list: Click and drag the 
favorite upward to move it higher in the list or downward to move it lower 
in the list.
»
» To delete a favorite from the Favorites list: Click the tiny x-in-a-circle to the 
right of its name.
When you’re finished using the Favorites list, click anywhere on the map or type 
in the search field to dismiss it.
Recents
The Maps app automatically remembers every location you’ve searched for in its 
Recents list (unless you’ve cleared it, as described next). Click in the search field, 
and then click Favorites in the sheet that appears below it. Click Recents to see 
your recent searches; click the item’s name to see it on the map.
To clear the Recents list, click the Clear Recents button at the bottom of the list. 
Sadly, removing a single entry is not possible; clearing the Recents list is an  
all-or-nothing deal.
When you’re finished using the Recents list, click anywhere on the map or type in 
the search field to dismiss it.
Contacts
To see a map of a contact’s location, click in the search field and then click Favor-
ites in the sheet that appears below it. Click All Contacts (or any group name) in 
the sidebar on the left and then click the contact’s name to see it on the map.
When you’re finished using the Favorites list, click anywhere on the map or type 
in the search field to dismiss it.

212     PART 3  Getting Things Done
Smart map tricks
The Maps app has more tricks up its sleeve. This section lists a few nifty features 
you may find useful.
Get route maps and driving directions
You can get route maps and driving directions to any location from any other 
location in a couple of ways:
»
» If a pushpin is already on the screen: Click the little i to the right of the 
item’s name to display the item’s Info sheet, and then click its Directions 
button (upper-left) to open the Directions sidebar.
»
» When you’re looking at a map screen: Click the Directions button on the 
toolbar. The Directions sidebar appears with Start and End fields at the top. 
Type the start and end points or select them from your Favorites, Recents, or 
Contacts if you prefer (by typing the first few letters and choosing it from the 
list that appears). If you want to swap the starting and ending locations, click 
the little swirly arrow button to the right of the Start and End fields.
If you need to change the start or end location, click the little x-in-a-circle to the 
right of its name and try again.
When the start and end locations are correct, press Return or Tab, and step- 
by-step directions appear in the sidebar on the left side of the Maps window, as 
shown in Figure 11-6.
Maps will often suggest several routes. The number of suggestions appears at the 
top of the list of directions (it’s 3 of 3 in Figure 11-6). The alternate routes are 
shown on the map in lighter blue, and cartoon balloons that tell you how long it 
will take. Click a cartoon balloon or light blue alternate route to see step-by-step 
directions for it, or cycle through the options using the left- or right-arrow key.
The selected route appears in dark blue; alternate routes appear in a lighter shade 
of blue.
Click a blue line or cartoon balloon to select a route, as in Figure 11-6, where Route 3 
is selected.
You can print your directions (File ➪ Print or ⌘  +P); export them as a PDF 
(File ➪ Export as PDF); or share them (File ➪ Share).

CHAPTER 11  Maps Are Where It’s At     213
When you’re finished with the step-by-step directions, click the Directions but-
ton to close the Directions sidebar.
Get walking directions
For step-by-step directions for walking, click the Walk button below the Start and 
End fields. Walking directions generally look a lot like driving directions except 
for your travel time.
Get directions for public transportation
High Sierra’s Maps app offers directions for using public transportation in more 
cities than ever. That’s the good news. The bad news is that unless you live in a 
relatively large city, it may be a while (and possibly a long while, depending on the 
size of your city) before such directions are available for your hometown.
As far as I can tell, public transit directions work the same as driving directions; 
specify your start and end points and Maps suggests several routes via public 
transit.
If you zoom in far enough you can see the entrances to transportation facilities 
such as train stations, as shown in Figure 11-7.

Get traffic info in real time
You can find out the traffic conditions for whatever map you’re viewing by choos-
ing View ➪ Show Traffic or clicking the Show drop-down menu lower-left on the 
map and choosing Show Traffic. When you do this, major roadways are color-
coded to inform you of the current traffic speed, as shown in Figure 11-8.
FIGURE 11-7: 
Zoom in 
far enough 
and you can 
even see the 
entrances.
FIGURE 11-8:

traffic is

kind of slowly 
(a kind of

orange), or 
nice and fast 
(no yellowish

CHAPTER 11  Maps Are Where It’s At     215
Reverse this process to hide traffic.
Here’s the key to those colors:
»
» Orange: 25 to 50 miles per hour
»
» Red: Under 25 miles per hour
»
» No color: No data available at this time
Traffic info isn’t available in every location, but the only way to find out is to give 
it a try. If color codes don’t appear, assume that traffic information doesn’t work 
for that particular location.
Tiny blue arrows on most one-way streets indicate the direction of traffic flow; 
the arrows may be too tiny to discern in Figure 11-8.
Fly over cool landmarks with 3D flyover tours
Certain cities and landmarks offer very cool 3D flyover tours when displayed in 
the satellite view. To try them, first click Satellite in the upper-right corner of 
the Maps window and then search for a city or landmark by name. Press Return; 
if a 3D flyover tour is available for that city or landmark, a bubble appears at the 
bottom of the map, as shown in Figure 11-9. Click the Start button to watch the 
flyover tour.
FIGURE 11-9: 
Click Start to 
watch the 3D 
flyover tour of

216     PART 3  Getting Things Done
Do more on the Info sheet
If a location has a little i to the right of its name, you can click it to see the loca-
tion’s Info screen.
As I explain earlier in this chapter, you can get directions to or from that location, 
add the location to your favorites or contacts, or create a new contact from it. But 
you can do three more things with a location from its Info screen:
»
» Click the phone number to call it.
»
» Click the email address to launch the Mail app and send an email to it.
»
» Click the URL to launch Safari and view its website.
And that, my friends, should be all you need to know to get you anywhere you 
want to go with Maps.

T
hese days, networking online is easier than finding a log to fall off: You 
simply use the Internet to connect your Mac to a wealth of information 
residing on computers around the world. Luckily for you, macOS High 
Sierra has the best and most comprehensive Internet tools ever shipped with a 
Mac operating system.
macOS offers built-in Internet connectivity right out of the box. macOS High 
Sierra comes with the following:
»
» Apple’s Safari web browser, which you use to navigate the web, download 
remote files, and more.
»
» The FaceTime app for video chats with other Mac or iDevice users.
»
» The Messages app, used for instant messaging and live online chatting (text). 
Messages works with other Messages users and people using Google, Yahoo!, 
AOL, Jabber (an open-source chatting protocol), or Bonjour (which discovers 
other users on your local area network). It also includes audio and video 
chatting, screen sharing, and file transfers.
»
» The Mail application (for email).
In this chapter and the two that follow, I cover the top things most people use the 
Internet for: surfing the web and video and audio chatting. You discover Safari 
and FaceTime in this chapter, Contacts in Chapter 13, and Mail and Messages in 
Chapter 14.

220     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
But before I can talk about any of those things, I first have to walk you through 
configuring your Internet connection, given that none of these apps work well 
without it. The good news is that after you finish making the connection, you can 
play with your Internet-enabled applications to your heart’s content.
Getting Connected to the Internet
Before you can use (or surf) the Internet, you need to connect to the Internet. If 
you’re a typical home user, you need three things to surf the Internet:
»
» A connection to the Internet, such as a cable modem, digital subscriber line 
(DSL) modem, or a satellite Internet service (referred to generically as your 
Internet box).
If you use technology other than DSL, cable, or satellite to connect your 
computer to the Internet, your network administrator (the person you run to 
at work when something goes wrong with your computer) or ISP might have 
to help you set up your Mac because setting up those other configurations is 
(sigh) beyond the scope of this book.
»
» An account with an ISP (Internet service provider), such as AT&T or Comcast.
The technical reviewer for previous editions of this book reminded me that 
these days, that’s not necessarily true. All you really need is free Wi-Fi, which 
is available almost everywhere — in stores, restaurants, parks, libraries, and 
other places — and a free email account from Apple’s iCloud, Microsoft’s 
Outlook.com, Google’s Gmail, or Yahoo! Mail.
»
» A Mac, preferably one running macOS 10.13 High Sierra.
You might need to tweak a few settings, as I explain in the upcoming section 
“Plugging in your Internet-connection settings.”
After you set up each of these components, you can launch and use Safari, Mail, 
Messages, and any other Internet applications.
Your Internet service provider and you
You may have to select a company to provide you access to the Internet: an ISP. The 
prices and services that ISPs offer vary, often from minute to minute. Keep the 
following in mind when choosing an ISP:

CHAPTER 12  (Inter)Networking     221
»
» If your connection comes from a cable or telephone company, your ISP is 
probably that company. In effect, the choice of ISP is pretty much made for 
you when you decide on cable or DSL service.
»
» Broadband access to the Internet starts at around $25 or $30 per month. 
If your service provider asks for considerably more than that, find out why.
Higher-throughput packages for cable and DSL connections might run you 
twice that, but they may not be available in your area. To wit: The only Internet 
package available from AT&T at my address in Austin, Texas, today is $40/month 
for speeds up to 50Mbps and 1TB of data. Check with your ISP for details.
Because most Mac users like things to be easy, macOS includes a cool feature in its 
Setup Assistant to help you find and configure an account with an ISP. When you 
installed macOS High Sierra (assuming that you did and that it didn’t come pre-
installed on your Mac), Setup Assistant may have asked you a bunch of questions 
about your Internet connection and set up everything for you.
If you didn’t have an Internet connection (an ISP) at that time, you may need to 
configure the Network System Preferences pane yourself. Chances are you’ll be 
good to go as soon as you connect the cable, but in the event it doesn’t just work, 
these settings could be something you’ll have to hash out with your ISP.
If you have questions or problems not answered by this book, your ISP should be 
able to assist you. And if your ISP can’t help, it’s probably time to try a different ISP.
Plugging in your Internet-connection  
settings
If you didn’t set up your Internet connection when you installed macOS, you need 
to open System Preferences (from the Applications folder, the dock, Launchpad, 
or the  menu) and click the Network icon. The Network pane offers options for 
connecting your Mac to the Internet or to a network. Setting up your Internet 
connection in the Network System Preferences pane is beyond the purview of 
this book, so the easiest way to do it is to search for network setup in Mac Help 
(Help ➪ Search).
If you’re part of a large office network, check with your system administrator 
before you change anything in this pane. If you ignore this advice, you run the risk 
of losing your network connection completely.
If your Mac asks you a question you can’t answer during setup, ask your ISP or 
network administrator for the answer. I can’t possibly tell you how in this book 
because there are just too many possible configurations, and each depends on 
your particular ISP and service.

222     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
That said, here’s a brief rundown on the most common things you may need to 
know to set up a network connection:
»
» TCP/IP: TCP/IP is the language of the Internet. You may be asked to specify 
things such as your IP address, domain name servers, and search domains.
»
» PPP or PPPoE: These acronyms stand for Point-to-Point Protocol and Point-to- 
Point Protocol over Ethernet. Which one you see depends on what service 
you’re using to connect. Older analog modems use PPP; some cable and DSL 
modems use PPPoE.
»
» Proxies: If you’re on a large network or your Mac is behind a firewall, you may 
need to specify one or more proxy servers. If so, your network administrator 
or ISP can help you with configuration. (Most home users will never need to 
touch this tab.) Some ISPs require you to specify proxy servers; if you need to 
do so, ask your ISP what to do.
If you use your Mac in more than one place, you can set up a separate configuration 
for each location and choose it from the Location menu. A location, in this context, 
consists of all settings in all items in the Network System Preferences pane.
My technical editor reminds me that you probably don’t need to create separate 
locations these days. My MacBook Pro just works. I may have to choose a Wi-Fi 
network and provide a password the first time I visit a hotel, cafe, or office; after 
that, my Mac remembers everything so the next time I’m at that hotel, cafe, or 
office, it just works.
After you have this entire pane configured the way that you like, follow these steps 
to create separate locations:
1.	 Pull down the Location menu and choose Edit Locations.
2.	 Click the + button at the bottom of the Locations list.
A new, untitled Location appears in the list.
3.	 Type a descriptive name for the new location, such as AirPort at 
Starbucks or Ethernet at Joe’s Office.
4.	 Click Done, and then click Apply.
From now on, you can change all your network settings at the same time by 
choosing the appropriate location from the Location pop-up menu.
If, on the other hand, your Mac has a single network or Internet connection (as 
most home users have), just leave the Location menu set to Automatic and be done 
with it.

CHAPTER 12  (Inter)Networking     223
And while this may be beyond the purview of this book, I’d like to remind you to 
use only wireless networks that you know and trust, especially in public places 
such as hotels and airports and consider using a virtual private network (VPN) 
when you’re out and about.
Also look for https (not http) at the beginning of URLs to ensure secure wireless 
traffic.
Browsing the Web with Safari
With your Internet connection set up, you’re ready to browse the web. In the fol-
lowing sections, I concentrate on browsing the web with Safari because it’s the 
web browser installed with macOS High Sierra.
If you don’t care for Safari, check out Firefox or Chrome, which are both free 
browsers and have features you won’t find in Safari. It never hurts to have a spare 
in case Safari has issues with a particular website.
To begin, just open your web browser. No problem. As usual, there’s more than 
one way. You can launch Safari by any of these methods:
»
» Single-click the Safari icon on the dock or Launchpad (look for the big blue 
compass that looks like a stopwatch, as shown in the margin).
»
» Double-click the Safari icon in your Applications folder.
»
» Single-click a URL link in an email, an iMessage, or a document.
»
» Double-click a URL link document (a .webloc file) in Finder.
The first time you launch Safari, you see a generic Favorites page, as shown in 
Figure 12-1. In the sections that follow, I show you the highlights of using Safari, 
starting at the top of its window.
FIGURE 12-1: 
Safari first 
displays 
a generic 
Favorites page.

224     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
Note that if you’re upgrading from an earlier version of macOS, Safari will open to 
the same page it opened to before you upgraded.
You can choose what appears in new Safari windows and tabs by choosing 
Safari ➪ Preferences and clicking the General tab at the top of the Preferences 
window.
Owning your toolbar
The Safari toolbar, at the top of every Safari window, consists of a narrow row 
of buttons and the Search or Enter Website Name field, and they do pretty much 
what their names imply. From left to right, these buttons are as follows:
»
» Back/Forward: When you open a page and move to a second page (or third 
or fourth), the Back button takes you to previously visited pages. Remember 
that you need to go back before the Forward button will work.
»
» Show/Hide Sidebar: Click this button to see your favorites or Reading list in 
the sidebar; click it again to hide the sidebar.
»
» Search or Enter Website Name: This field, to the right of the Show Sidebar 
button, is where you type web addresses, or URLs (Uniform Resource 
Locators) that you want to visit. Just type one, and press Return to surf to 
that site.
To the right of the Search or Enter Website Name field are two more buttons. 
Keep reading.
»
» Share: When you find a page of interest or a page you know you’ll want to 
remember, click this button (which is actually a drop-down menu) to tell Safari 
to remember it for you in High Sierra’s cool Reading list or as a bookmark — 
two topics I explore further a little later in this chapter. Or send a link to it via 
Mail or Messages, both covered in Chapter 14, or post it on Facebook or tweet 
it on Twitter.
»
» Show/Hide All Tabs: Click the Show/Hide All Tabs button to see previews of all 
your open tabs (which you learn about shortly). If you have other Macs or 
iDevices, you’ll also see the open tabs in this copy of Safari on other devices 
that have Safari enabled in iCloud. This feature is so handy you can also find it 
in the View menu, where you’ll also spy its handy keyboard shortcut, ⌘  +Shift+\.
»
» Create a New Tab (+): Click the plus button to create a tab.
Safari in High Sierra (and Sierra and El Capitan before it) offers pinned 
tabs, which persist in the tab bar until you unpin them. To pin a tab, choose  
Window ➪ Pin Tab or right- or Control-click the tab and choose Pin Tab from the 

CHAPTER 12  (Inter)Networking     225
contextual menu. To unpin a tab you’ve pinned previously, reverse the process 
and choose Window ➪ Unpin Tab or right- or Control-click the pinned tab and 
choose Unpin Tab.
But wait — there’s more. To add other useful buttons to your toolbar, choose 
View ➪ Customize Toolbar (or right-click anywhere on the toolbar and choose 
Customize Toolbar from the contextual menu). The Customize Toolbar sheet 
drops down, and you can drag items into or out of the toolbar to create a custom 
set of buttons. In Figure 12-2, for example, I added six new buttons to my toolbar 
(left to right): Top Sites, Favorites Bar, AutoFill, Zoom In/Out, Mail, and Print.
Many third-party browser extensions install buttons in the toolbar as well.
Below the Search or Enter Website Name field is the Favorites bar, which is popu-
lated by default with buttons for web pages that Apple thinks you might enjoy, 
including Apple, Yahoo!, Google Maps, YouTube, and Wikipedia.
If you don’t see your Favorites bar, choose View ➪ Show Favorites Bar or press 
⌘  +Shift+B.
I’ve replaced all the default buttons on my Safari Favorites bar with folders that 
are drop-down menus, as denoted by the little chevron after their names, as 
shown in Figure 12-3.
Adding bookmarks to and deleting bookmarks from the Favorites bar (and side-
bar) is described in the next section.
One last thing: Favorites and bookmarks are not exactly the same in High Sierra. 
Favorites is a folder of bookmarks that appear in the Favorites bar and Favorites page.
FIGURE 12-2: 
The Customize 
Toolbar 
sheet and my 
customized 
toolbar.

226     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
Not all bookmarks are Favorites, but all Favorites are bookmarks. Which makes 
total sense when you think about it.
And perhaps to confuse matters even further, you can change what you see in the 
Favorites page (but not the Favorites bar) via a setting in the Preferences General 
pane. It can be a trifle confusing at first, but you’ll get used to it.
Using the Safari sidebar
Click the Sidebar button on the toolbar to show or hide the Safari sidebar, which 
has two tabs — Bookmarks and Reading List— which I explore in this section.
Bookmarking your favorite pages
When you find a web page you want to remember and return to, you bookmark it. 
Here’s how it works:
1.	 Choose Bookmarks ➪ Add Bookmark, press ⌘   + D, or click the Share 
button and choose Add Bookmark.
2.	 Choose where to store the bookmark from the pop-up menu, as shown in 
Figure 12-4.
By default, Safari puts them in the Favorites folder.
FIGURE 12-3: 
All the buttons 
in my Favorites 
bar are actually 
drop-down 
menus.

CHAPTER 12  (Inter)Networking     227
3.	 Rename the bookmark or use the name provided by Safari.
I accepted the name Safari suggested, so now this page will appear in the 
Favorites bar as Working Smarter for Mac Users.
4.	 (Optional) Add a brief description if you like.
I typed “my website!”
5.	 Click the Add button to save the bookmark.
Finding your bookmarks in the sidebar
To return to a bookmarked page, click it in the Favorites bar, choose Bookmarks ➪ Show 
Bookmarks, press ⌘  +Option+B, or click the Show Sidebar button (shown in margin) 
to see all your bookmarks in the sidebar, as shown in Figure 12-5.
If you add the bookmark to the Favorites folder (as shown), it automatically 
appears in the Favorites bar. If you add the bookmark outside the Favorites folder 
in the sidebar, it will not appear in the Favorites bar but will be available at the 
bottom of the Bookmarks menu and in the Bookmarks sidebar.
FIGURE 12-4: 
Creating a 
bookmark.
FIGURE 12-5: 
The sidebar in 
all its glory.

228     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
Open bookmarked pages in the sidebar by clicking them once. View the contents 
of a folder (such as Favorites, RBS, Learn, WSMbiz, and WSMsocial in Figure 12-5) 
by single-clicking the folder name in the list. Figure 12-5 shows, in particular, the 
contents of the Favorites bar folder with the contents of the WSMsocial subfolder 
expanded.
To organize your Bookmarks window or place bookmarks on the toolbar or Book-
marks menu, move bookmarks by dragging them. You can place bookmarks and 
folders of bookmarks on the Safari Favorites bar or in the Bookmarks menu by 
dragging them to the appropriate folder. If you drag a folder of bookmarks to the 
Favorites folder (or directly onto the Favorites bar itself), the result is a drop-
down menu, as shown in Figure 12-3, earlier in this chapter.
To delete a bookmark, right- or Control+click it and choose Delete.
⌘  +click a folder in the Bookmarks window or Favorites bar to simultaneously 
open all the bookmarks it contains.
While we’re on the subject of favorites, you’ve probably noticed this handy behav-
ior by now, but it’s worth mentioning: When you click in the empty Search or 
Enter Website Name field, a sheet drops down, displaying your favorites. The sheet 
is replaced by a list of search results and suggestions as soon as you type the first 
character. Understandably, the sheet doesn’t appear if the current page is Favor-
ites or Top Sites. But it’s a convenient feature I’d be remiss not to mention.
Last but not least, one of my favorite Safari features (introduced in El Capitan) is 
the little blue speaker icon that appears on the right side of the Search or Enter 
Website Name field if audio is playing on any page. Click the speaker and Safari 
will go silent even if the audio is coming from an inactive tab or a hidden window. 
Thanks, Apple; we needed that.
Safari now blocks audio and video from playing automatically by default. If you 
want to enable it for all sites or specific sites, choose Safari ➪ Preferences, click 
the Websites tab, and then click Auto-Play in the sidebar on the left.
Website-specific settings
You can enable or disable Auto-Play another way — with High Sierra’s new  
website-specific settings. To access them, choose Safari ➪ Settings for This 
Website. Or right- or Control-click the site’s URL in the Enter Website Name field 
and choose Settings for This Website.
In addition to the aforementioned auto-play, other website-specific options you 
can set follow:

CHAPTER 12  (Inter)Networking     229
»
» Use Reader view when available.
»
» Enable/disable content blockers.
»
» Set page zoom.
»
» Ask permission to use the camera, microphone, or your location.
What’s on your Reading list?
The Reading list serves as a repository for pages or links you want to read but 
don’t want to read right now. It’s a lot like a bookmark but easier to create on the 
fly, which makes the Reading list perfect for sites or links you don’t need to keep 
forever (that’s what bookmarks are for).
To see your Reading list, click the Show Sidebar icon and then click the Reading 
List tab (shown in the margin).
To add the page you’re viewing to your Reading list, hover your cursor over the left 
side of the Search or Enter Website Name field and then click the + that appears, as 
shown in Figure 12-6. (You can also use the keyboard shortcut ⌘  +Shift+D or click 
the Share button and choose Add to Reading List from its menu.)
To add a link to your Reading list without visiting the page, just press the Shift 
key before you click a link. It’s fast and easy, and it works even if the sidebar is 
closed. Or you can right- or Control-click the link and choose Add to Reading List 
from the contextual menu.
Right-click any item in your Reading list for additional options, as shown in 
Figure 12-6.
FIGURE 12-6: 
Adding the 
current page 
to the Reading 
List.

230     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
To delete an item from the Reading list, right- or Control-click the item and 
then choose Remove Item. To remove all items from the Reading list, right- or  
Control-click any item and then choose Clear All Items.
If you have other Macs or iDevices, you can sync your Reading list among your 
devices by enabling Safari in the iCloud System Preferences pane.
Using the terrific Top Sites page
The Top Sites page has quickly become one of my favorite Safari features. It dis-
plays a selection of sites you visit frequently, as shown in Figure 12-7.
To see Top Sites, choose Bookmarks  ➪  Show Top Sites, or click the Top Sites 
button (shown in the margin), which is on the left edge of my Favorites bar 
(View ➪ Show Favorites Bar) and also on my customized toolbar (both shown in 
Figure 12-7).
As you surf the web, Safari learns your favorite sites and replaces the sites on the 
Top Sites page with the ones you visit most.
FIGURE 12-7: 
Top Sites 
displays your 
favorite sites.

CHAPTER 12  (Inter)Networking     231
Here are a few more things you can do with Top Sites:
»
» Delete a site you don’t want on your Top Sites page. Click the little X in its 
top-left corner (refer to Figure 12-7).
»
» Pin a site to your Top Sites page to make it remain one of your Top Sites, 
even if you don’t visit that page for a while. Click the pushpin in its top-left 
corner so it turns blue, as shown in Figure 12-7.
»
» Change the number and size of the sites shown. Choose Safari ➪ Preferences, 
click the General tab at the top, and then choose 12 sites (shown in Figure 12-7), 
or 6 or 24 (not shown) from the Top Sites Shows pop-up menu.
Searching with Google
Looking for something on the Internet? Check out Google, the fantastic search 
engine that’s totally integrated with Safari to help you hunt down just about any-
thing on the Internet in no time.
Don’t care for Google? Choose Safari ➪ Preferences, click the Search tab, and 
choose a different one, as long as you prefer Yahoo!, Bing, or DuckDuckGo (a 
privacy-friendly search engine that unlike Google doesn’t track your searches or 
collect information about your search habits).
In this section, you discover how to use Google to search the Internet and find 
almost anything, as well as how to get help with Google when all else fails.
To search the Internet with Google, follow these steps:
1.	 In the Search or Enter Website Name field, type the beginning of a word 
or phrase.
As you type, Safari offers a list of suggestions and recent searches, as shown in 
Figure 12-8. Note that I had typed only vizsla pi when Safari offered this list.
2.	 Click one of the list items; finish typing the word or phrase, or use the 
arrow keys to select a list item; and then press Return to start the search.
Google almost immediately offers your search results, as shown in Figure 12-8.
3.	 Click one of the result links.
Links appear in blue and are underlined. You’re taken instantly to that 
particular page.

232     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
If the fish you catch on your first try aren’t what you want, use different bait:
»
» If a particular result isn’t just what you’re looking for: Click the Back 
button, and try another result link.
»
» If Google offers too many results that aren’t just right:
a.	 Click the Settings link near the top of the results page and choose Advanced 
Search.
Advanced searches refine your search with a multitude of options, some 
of which are shown in Figure 12-9. I am refining my search for pictures of 
Vizsla dogs that are cute or puppies and not ugly, senior, or old.
b.	 Click the Advanced Search button (not visible in Figure 12-9).
A refined results page quickly appears. As before, click a result link to visit 
that page. If it’s not just what you’re looking for, click the Back button, and 
try a different result link.
By the way, the little double-chevron icons on the right side of the toolbar and 
Favorites bar in Figures 12-9 (and shown in the margin) indicate that the window 
is too narrow to display all the tools or bookmarks. Click the chevron, and a menu 
shows you the previously hidden choices, as shown in Figure 12-9. In this figure, 
the toolbar overflow menu (not shown) would display the hidden toolbar icons; 
the Favorites bar overflow menu (shown) displays the four hidden items (three 
bookmark folders and a bookmark).
That’s pretty much all you need to know to have a great time searching the web 
with Google.
FIGURE 12-8: 
A Google 
search for 
pictures of 
Vizsla dogs.

CHAPTER 12  (Inter)Networking     233
Checking out Help Center
Safari has a lot more features, and I could write an entire chapter about using 
Safari, but one of the rules we Dummies authors must follow is that our books 
can’t run 1,000 pages.
So I’m going to give you the next best thing: Open Help Center (by choosing 
Help ➪ Safari Help). A special Safari Help window appears; you can search for any 
Safari-related topic or solution to any Safari-related problem right there.
Audio and Video Calls with FaceTime
In the beginning, FaceTime brought video calling to the iPhone 4. It was iPhone 
4-to-iPhone 4 only and required Wi-Fi (not cellular 3G or 4G). Still, it was pretty 
cool and worked quite well. Not surprisingly, it soon spread to the second- and 
later-generation iPads, the iPod touch, and in macOS Snow Leopard on the Mac 
as well.
If you haven’t read about Messages yet (see Chapter 14), one of its features is 
video chat. Alas, Messages can video chat only with folks on Macs or PCs, but 
FaceTime lets you do video chat with other Mac users as well as users of iPhone 4 
or later, as well as iPad and iPod touch users.
FIGURE 12-9: 
Running 
a Google 
advanced 
search.

234     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
In addition to its aforementioned video-chat-with-iDevices prowess, FaceTime 
works beautifully for Mac-to-Mac video calls. And, because it’s a single-purpose 
application, many users (including my mom) find it easier and less intimidating 
to set up and use than Messages or Skype.
By the way, there’s no Windows version of FaceTime at the moment, so you’ll 
have to use Messages (or third-party software such as Skype or web apps such as 
Google Hangouts) to have cross-platform video chats.
A feature introduced in Yosemite lets you use your Mac to make and receive phone 
calls on your iPhone with the FaceTime app. You’ll find the details at https://
support.apple.com/kb/PH21870?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US.
For now, to get started, launch FaceTime from your Applications folder, Launch-
pad, or dock. The main (only) FaceTime window appears, as shown in Figure 12-10.
The right side of the window shows what your Mac’s camera is seeing (which 
happens to be me in Figure 12-10).
I clicked the camera icon next to my wife’s name to initiate a call from my Mac to 
my wife’s iPhone (or Mac). She was in the yard, so she answered on her iPhone; 
what we each saw is shown in Figure 12-11.
FIGURE 12-10: 
The FaceTime 
window, ready 
to make a call.

CHAPTER 12  (Inter)Networking     235
FaceTime uses Contacts (covered in Chapter 13), so if you have friends or family 
who have an iPhone 4 or later, iPad 2 or later, iPad mini, iPod touch (fourth gen-
eration or later), or a Mac, just type their name in the field in the top-left corner, 
and then right- or Control-click on their name in the results list, as shown for 
Lisa LeVitus in Figure 12-10.

Dealing with People
I
n this chapter and the next, you discover a quartet of programs that work beau-
tifully together and make managing your contacts, email, and messages (chats) 
a breeze. You’re about to find out how these eponymous programs — Contacts 
in this chapter, and Mail and Messages in Chapter 14 — work, and how to use 
them individually and as a team.
I cover a lot of material in not a lot of space in these two chapters, so if you want to 
find out something about Contacts, Mail, or Messages that I don’t cover, remem-
ber the capable assistance you can find in Help ➪ Contacts Help (or Mail Help, or 
Messages Help).
Collecting Your Contacts
Contacts stores and manages information about your family, friends, compa-
nies, and any other entity you want to keep in touch with. It works seamlessly 
with the Mail, Messages, and Maps applications, enabling you to quickly look 
up phone numbers or email addresses when you’re ready to communicate with 
someone.
Chapter 13
IN THIS CHAPTER

» Collecting your contacts
»
» Managing your contacts
»
» Syncing your contacts with other 
devices

238     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
In fact, Contacts works with several applications, both on and beyond your Mac, 
including the following:
»
» Use it with FaceTime (covered in Chapter 12) to video chat with friends 
and family.
»
» Use it with Calendar (covered in Chapter 9) to display your contacts by 
choosing Window ➪ Address Panel or by pressing ⌘  +Option+A. You can 
then drag any person in your contacts from the Address Panel to any date 
and time on the calendar, and a special meeting event is created automati-
cally by Calendar. The event even has a Send Invitation button; if you click it, 
it launches Mail and sends the person an invitation to this meeting. Very 
cool stuff.
»
» The Contacts application can also work with any other application whose 
programmers choose to make the connection or with any device that’s 
compatible with Contacts. For example, BusyContacts ($49.99 in the Mac 
App Store) exchanges data with Contacts seamlessly, so changes made in 
Contacts appear in BusyContacts (and vice versa) almost immediately.
»
» Contacts is available also in most programs that have a Share button or 
menu so you can share with your contacts via whichever method is appro-
priate, usually their phone number, email, or iCloud.com or Me.com address 
(for an iMessage).
»
» If you use iCloud, you can choose to sync contacts with devices that include 
(but are not limited to) other Macs, iPhones, iPads, and iPod touches. And you 
can also sync contacts via Google, Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Office 365, 
or any combination.
In the following sections, you find out the best ways to fill Contacts with your own 
contacts and how to keep those contacts organized.
Adding contacts
Follow these steps to create an entry in Contacts:
1.	 Launch the Contacts application by double-clicking its icon in the 
Applications folder, clicking its dock icon, or clicking its Launchpad icon.
The Contacts window appears. The first time you open Contacts, you see two 
cards: Apple Computer and the one with whatever personal identification 
information you supplied when you created your account.

CHAPTER 13  Dealing with People     239
2.	 To create an entry, click the + button at the bottom of the Contact card 
and choose New Contact from the drop-down menu.
An untitled address card appears. The First name text field is initially selected. 
(It’s highlighted in Figure 13-1.)
3.	 In the First text field, type the person’s first name.
Here, I type Bob.
4.	 Press Tab.
Your cursor should now be in the Last text field.
You can always move from one field to the next by pressing Tab. In fact, this 
shortcut works in almost all Mac programs with fields. (Move to the previous 
field by pressing Shift+Tab.)
5.	 Type the last name for the person you’re adding to your Contacts.
Here, I type LeVitus. Continue this process, filling in the rest of the fields shown 
in Figure 13-2.
6.	 When you’ve finished entering information, click the Done button to exit 
editing mode.
The contact I created with this step appears in Figure 13-2.
FIGURE 13-1: 
A new address 
card in 
Contacts.

240     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
The little triangles (actually up and down arrows) between the labels and their 
content fields in Figure 13-2 are pop-up menus that offer alternative labels for 
the field. For example, if you were to click the arrows next to the word Child, 
you would be able to choose Father, Parent, Brother, Sister, and so on to 
replace the label Child.
To add more info about any Contacts entry, click the name in the list on the left 
(Bob LeVitus in Figure 13-2). Click the Edit button at the bottom of the Contacts 
window, and make your changes.
Repeat these steps for everyone you want to keep in touch with.
Importing contacts from other programs
If your contacts are on another Mac or an iDevice, or stored by Google or Microsoft, 
you won’t need to import your contacts. Just enable the appropriate account in the 
Internet Accounts System Preferences pane, and enable syncing for contacts.
Those who have contacts in another program (such as FileMaker Pro or ACT) might 
be able to import them into Contacts. Contacts can import contacts in vCard, LDIF, 
or text file format.
The first thing is to export the data from the other program in one of these formats.
I always export the file to the desktop, so that the file is easy to find in the next 
step.
FIGURE 13-2: 
My address 
card displayed 
in the Contacts 
window.

CHAPTER 13  Dealing with People     241
Choose File ➪ Import, select the exported data file in the Open File dialog, and 
then click the Open button.
Creating a basic group
Now let me explain how to organize your contacts into groups. Why would you 
want to organize your contacts into groups? The main reason, at least for me, 
is practical: I can send email with a single click to everyone in a group that I’ve 
defined. For example, when it’s time to send out a press release, I can simply 
send it to my Press/PR group, shooting the email off to all 50 people I have in that 
group. And when I want to send an email to all the parents of kids on my son’s 
indoor football team, I merely address it to my Flag Football Parents group, and 
all 12 families in that group receive it.
Here’s how to create a group and add contacts to it:
1.	 Launch the Contacts application by double-clicking its icon in the 
Applications folder or clicking its dock icon.
2.	 Create the new group by choosing File ➪ New Group, pressing ⌘  +Shift+N, 
or clicking the + button at the bottom of the window.
An untitled Group appears in the Group column with Untitled Group  
highlighted.
3.	 Type a descriptive name for this group and then press Return.
I named mine Family.
4.	 Click All Contacts on the left side of the window to show all your contacts 
on the right side.
5.	 Click the contacts you want in the group from the contacts list.
Hold down the ⌘   key as you select contacts if you want to select more than 
one contact.
You can use the search field (the magnifying glass icon) at the top of the 
window to find a contact or contacts, and then drag them onto the group to 
add them, which is what I did in Figure 13-3.
6.	 Drag the selected contact names onto the group, as shown in Figure 13-3.
Contacts considerately displays the number of contacts you’re dragging, which 
happens to be five in this instance.

242     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
Another way to create a group is to select contacts by clicking, ⌘  -clicking, or 
Shift-clicking contacts and then choosing File ➪ New Group from Selection.
Setting up a smart group  
(based on contact criteria)
A second type of group — a smart group — might be even more useful to you 
because it gathers contacts in your Contacts based on criteria you specify. For 
example, say I create a group that automatically selects Apple staff members who 
have email addresses that end in @apple.com.
The big advantage of using a smart group instead of a regular group is that when 
I add, say, a new Apple contact, that contact automatically becomes a member of 
the Apple smart group with no further action on my part. And if you delete a card 
or modify it so the contact no longer matches the smart group criteria, the contact 
is removed from the group automatically.
To create a smart group, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose File ➪ New Smart Group or press ⌘  +Option+N.
A Smart Group sheet appears in front of the Contacts window, as shown in 
Figure 13-4.
FIGURE 13-3: 
Adding five 
contacts to the 
Family group.

CHAPTER 13  Dealing with People     243
2.	 Give the Smart Group a name.
I named mine @Apple.com.
3.	 Select the appropriate items from the menus: Any, Company, Contains, 
Email, and so on.
In Figure 13-4, I created a smart group that includes any contact that contains 
Apple in the Company field or @apple.com in any email field.
4.	 When you’re happy with the criteria specified, click OK.
Deleting a group or smart group
To delete a group or a smart group from your Contacts, click to select it, and then 
press Delete or choose Edit ➪ Delete Group.
The view is lovely
The Contacts View menu has but three options:
»
» Show/Hide Groups (⌘  +1): Choose Show/Hide Groups to hide or show the 
leftmost column (where you see iCloud and Smart Groups in Figure 13-3).
Note that you’ll see On My Mac in this column (instead of iCloud) if you haven’t 
enabled iCloud syncing.
»
» Show/Hide Last Import (⌘  +Option+L): Choose Show/Hide Last Import to 
show or hide the Last Import Smart Group that Apple kindly provided for you.
»
» Enter Full Screen (⌘  +Control+F): Does just what you’d expect, filling your 
screen with the Contacts window. To exit Full Screen, press ⌘  +Control+F 
again, press the Esc key, or move the pointer to the top of the screen and click 
the red gumdrop button.

Sync + Contacts = your contacts  
everywhere
If you’re not syncing contacts with iCloud, Google, or Microsoft Exchange/Office 
360 (I discuss syncing calendars and reminders with iCloud in Chapter 9; you’re 
on your own with Google or Microsoft), your contacts will be stored locally on your 
hard drive. iCloud, Google, and Microsoft users, on the other hand, can choose to 
store their contacts locally or in iCloud, Google’s cloud, or Microsoft’s cloud. The 
difference is if you store your contacts in the cloud, you can sync all your devices 
so they all display the same information. In other words, if you add a contact to 
your iPhone, you’ll see it on your Mac in the Contacts app within a few minutes. 
Conversely, if you add a contact on your Mac, within a few minutes, it magically 
appears in the Contacts app on your iDevice.
Here is how to enable iCloud for Contacts:
1.	 Choose Contacts ➪ Preferences or press ⌘  +, (include the comma).
The Contacts Preferences window appears.
2.	 Click the Accounts icon at the top of the window.
The Accounts pane appears.
3.	 Click the + button near the bottom of the window.
The Choose a Contacts Account Provider sheet appears.
4.	 Click the iCloud (or Exchange or Google or other) button and then click 
Continue.
5.	 Type the name you want to use for this account, your username, and 
your password, and then click the Sign In (iCloud) or Set Up (other 
services) button.
The Use With sheet appears for the selected service with the Contacts check 
box already selected.
6.	 Click Add Account.
If you previously enabled iCloud for Contacts, reenabling it is even easier: 
Choose Contacts ➪ Preferences (⌘  +,), click the Accounts icon at the top of the 
window, click iCloud in the list on the left, and then select the Enable This 
Account check box.
You enable syncing with Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, and other services the 
same way — click the + button at the bottom of the column on the left, and 
then click the service name (Google, Microsoft, and so on) on the right. Then 
provide your username and password, and click Set Up. Piece of cake.

CHAPTER 13  Dealing with People     245
If you’ve enabled any social media accounts in the Internet Accounts System Pref-
erences pane, they appear in the list on the left in Contacts. So don’t be surprised 
when you see unfamiliar names in your Contacts application  — they’re likely 
to be contacts pulled in from Facebook, LinkedIn, Google, and the like. Choose  
Contacts ➪ Accounts to disable them if they bother you.
If you use iCloud, there’s no reason to store contacts locally, that is, On My Mac. 
And, in fact, if you use iCloud, you won’t even see an On My Mac section in the 
Groups list. My advice is that if you do see both sections (On My Mac and iCloud) 
in the Groups list, copy the contacts stored in On My Mac to iCloud by clicking All 
on My Mac in the Groups list, selecting all its contacts (Edit ➪ Select All or ⌘  +A), 
and dragging them onto the iCloud group. Now click the iCloud group and con-
firm that the contacts you just dragged are visible, and then delete the contacts 
in the On My Mac group (select all contacts and then choose Edit ➪ Delete Cards). 
Finally, click iCloud and look for duplicate contacts by choosing Card ➪ Look for 
Duplicates. If any duplicates are found, you’re invited to either delete one (if 
they’re the same) or merge them (if one is different).

Communicating with 
Mail and Messages
Y
ou can see how to use Contacts and Maps to find people and places in 
Chapters 13 and 11, respectively. In this chapter, I take a look at two more 
terrific programs — Mail and Messages — that work with Contacts to make 
managing your email and messages (chats) a breeze.
Sending and Receiving Email with Mail
I cover a lot of material in not a lot of space in this chapter, so if there’s something 
you want to find out about Mail or Messages that I don’t cover, don’t forget about 
the wonderful assistance you can find in Help  ➪  Mail Help (or Messages Help).
Mail is a program for sending, receiving, and organizing your email. Mail is fast 
and easy to use, too. Click the Mail icon on the dock or Launchpad or double-click 
the Mail icon in the Applications folder to launch Mail. The Mail icon looks like a 
canceled postage stamp, as shown in the margin.
You can use other applications to read email. Mozilla (Thunderbird) and AOL, for 
example, have their own mail readers, as does Microsoft Office (Outlook). And 
services such as Google’s Gmail and Apple’s iCloud (to name a couple) offer a

web-based interface you can use in a pinch. You can continue to use any or all 
of these options for your email if you like, but when you’re using your Mac, the 
easiest and best mail reader around (meaning the best one on your hard drive by 
default) is almost certainly Mail. And of course, you can’t beat the price; it’s free!
The following sections, in some cases, offer you starting points. Even so, you 
should find everything perfectly straightforward. If you run into a question that 
the following sections don’t answer, remember that you can always call upon the 
assistance of Help (Help ➪ Mail Help).
Setting up Mail
If this is your first time launching Mail, you need to set up your email account(s) 
before you can proceed. A set of Choose a Mail Account Provider screens appears 
automatically. Just follow the instructions on each screen, fill in the fields as 
requested, and keep clicking the Continue button until you’re finished.
If you don’t know what to type in one or more of these fields, contact your ISP 
(Internet service provider) or mail provider for assistance.
After you set up one or more email accounts, you see a Welcome message ask-
ing whether you’d like to see what’s new in Mail. If you click Yes, Help Viewer 
launches and shows you the What’s New in Mail page; the Mail main window, 
which looks like Figure 14-1, appears in the background. Or if you click No, the 
Mail main window appears as the active window immediately.
FIGURE 14-1: 
The main 
window 
in Mail.

CHAPTER 14  Communicating with Mail and Messages     249
The Mail main window is called a viewer window or message viewer window. You 
can have more than one of them on your screen, if you like; just choose File ➪ New 
Viewer Window or press ⌘  +Option+N.
A quick overview of the toolbar
Before you go any further, look at Figure 14-2, which shows the nine handy but-
tons and a search field on the viewer window’s toolbar by default.
»
» Get Mail: Checks for new email.
»
» New Message: Creates a new, blank email message.
»
» Archive: Archives selected message or messages.
»
» Delete: Deletes selected message or messages.
To select more than one message in the list, hold down the ⌘   key when you 
click the second and subsequent messages.
»
» Junk: Marks the selected message or messages as junk mail. Mail has built-in 
junk-mail filtering that can be enabled or disabled in Mail Preferences. 
(Choose Mail ➪ Preferences and click the Junk Mail icon on the toolbar.) If you 
receive a piece of spam (junk mail), select it and click this button to help train 
the Mail junk-mail filter. If a selected message has been marked as junk mail, 
the button changes to read Not Junk.
For more info on junk-mail filtering, click the question mark button in the Junk 
Mail pane of the Mail Preferences window.
»
» Reply: Creates a reply to the sender only.
FIGURE 14-2:

250     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
»
» Reply All: Creates a reply to the sender and everyone who was sent the 
original message.
»
» Forward: Creates a copy of this message you can send to someone other 
than the sender or other recipients.
»
» Flag/Unflag: From this drop-down menu, you can mark or unmark one or 
more messages with any of seven colored flags. The selected message in 
Figure 14-3, for example, is flagged in green.
Finally, the search field on the toolbar finds a word or phrase in any item stored 
in Mail. When you begin typing, a drop-down menu appears (refer to Figure 14-2) 
so you can narrow the search to people or subjects matching your search phrase. 
I searched for items with high sierra in all mailboxes, which reveals 285 items. 
You can also click the buttons on the Favorites bar to limit your search to specific 
mailboxes —Inbox, Sent, and Flagged in Figure 14-2.
If you see little numbers next to the mailbox buttons on the Favorites bar (or side-
bar), they indicate the number of unread messages in that mailbox. A message is 
considered read after you click it.
Searching in Mail should be familiar because it works the same way as searching 
in Finder. So, for example, if you want to save a search as a smart mailbox (Mail’s 
version of a smart folder in Finder), you click the Save button (hidden by the drop-
down menu in Figure 14-2).
Mail populates the Favorites bar with mailboxes it expects you to use often, namely 
Inbox, Sent, and Flagged, as shown in Figure 14-3. Add your own mailboxes by 
dragging them from the Mailbox pane to the Favorites bar.
FIGURE 14-3:

CHAPTER 14  Communicating with Mail and Messages     251
One last thing: My Mavericks For Dummies tech editor, the late Dennis Cohen, 
urged me to at least mention Classic layout, which puts the message list above 
the content as shown in Figure 14-3 instead of next to the content as shown in 
Figures 14-1 and 14-2.
If you prefer the old-school view, here’s how to make the change:
1.	 Choose Mail ➪ Preferences.
2.	 Click the Viewing tab (icon) at the top of the window.
3.	 Select the Use Classic Layout check box.
4.	 Click the Close button (the red gumdrop) or press ⌘  +W to close the 
Preferences window.
If you decide you liked it better the other way, just go back and clear the Use Clas-
sic Layout check box.
Composing a new message
Here’s how to create an email message:
1.	 Choose File ➪ New Message, click the New Message button on the toolbar, 
or press ⌘  +N.
A new window appears. This is where you compose your email message, as 
shown in Figure 14-4.
FIGURE 14-4: 
Composing an 
email message.

252     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
2.	 Click in the To field, and type someone’s email address.
Use my address (HighSierra4Dummies@boblevitus.com) if you don’t know 
anyone else to send mail to.
If the recipient is in your Contacts (as Barrington the Bellhop and Barrintown 
Avenue Saloon are in mine), just type a few letters, and Mail’s intelligent 
autocomplete function matches it up with Contacts. So, for example, in 
Figure 14-4, I typed the letters b-a-r-r-i-n, and a list of people in my Contacts 
with barrin in their names — namely, Barrintown Avenue Saloon and 
Barrington the Bellhop — appeared. I can select a name by clicking it and 
typing an additional letter or letters to narrow the search (typing g would 
leave only Barrington the Bellhop; typing t would leave only Barrintown 
Avenue Saloon), or by using the arrow keys and pressing Return.
3.	 Press the Tab key twice and type a subject for this message in the Subject 
text field.
I typed Isn’t Autocomplete Awesome? in Figure 14-4.
4.	 Click in the main message portion of the window, and type your message 
there.
I typed Your message here . . . in Figure 14-4.
5.	 When you’re finished writing your message, click the Send button to send 
the email immediately, or close it to save it in the Drafts mailbox so you 
can work on it later.
If you save your message to the Drafts mailbox (perhaps so you can write more 
later on), you can send it when you’re ready by opening the Drafts mailbox, 
double-clicking the message, and then clicking the Send button.
Just for the record, here’s what the buttons in the toolbar in Figure 14-4 are all 
about:
»
» Send: Duh. Sends the message.
»
» Header Fields: This drop-down menu lets you add header fields — BCC, 
Reply-To, and Priority — to this message.
If you want a BCC or Reply-To field in every new message you create, choose 
View ➪ BCC Address Field or View ➪ Reply-To Field (or use their keyboard 
shortcuts: ⌘  +Option+B and ⌘  +Option+R, respectively).
»
» Reply to Sender: Lets you reply to the sender directly from the message 
window. It’s inactive in Figure 14-4 because this is a new message and there is 
no sender to reply to.

CHAPTER 14  Communicating with Mail and Messages     253
»
» Attach: Opens a standard Open File sheet so you can choose a file or files to 
enclose with this message. To enclose multiple files, hold down the ⌘   key 
while you click each file you want to enclose.
If the recipients of this message use Windows, you probably want to click the 
Options button and select the Send Windows-Friendly Attachments check box, 
which appears at the bottom of the Open File sheet (if it’s not already 
selected).
I recommend that you select it even if you don’t think you have Windows-
using recipients because there’s no downside for Mac or iOS users.
»
» Include Attachments from Original Message: This button includes any files 
that were attached to the message you’re replying to. It’s inactive in Figure 14-3 
because this is a new message, not a reply.
»
» Format Toolbar: Shows or hides the Format toolbar, which is displayed 
(between the toolbar and the To field) in Figure 14-4.
»
» Photo Browser: Opens the Photo Browser panel, which displays the images 
in your photo library and lets you drag and drop them into a mail message.
»
» Show/Hide Stationery: Opens a sheet with a selection of stationery you can 
use for your email message. (You find out more about this feature in the 
upcoming section, “Working with stationery.”)
Sending email from the Contacts app
You don’t even have to open the Contacts app to send an email to a contact or 
group contained in your Contacts. In the preceding section, you see how Mail finds 
contacts (or groups) for you without launching Contacts. But if you already have 
Contacts open, the following technique for sending email to a contact or group is 
probably most convenient.
To create a blank email message to a contact, click and hold down on the field 
label next to the desired email address, and choose Send Email from the pop-
up menu that appears, as shown for the Other label in Figure 14-5. Or move the 
pointer over an email address and then click the blue envelope icon that appears 
to the right of its name, as shown for my Home address in Figure 14-5.
The Mail program becomes active, and a blank email message addressed to the 
selected contact appears on your screen. Just type your email as you normally 
would.

254     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
As you can see in Figure 14-5, in addition to sending an email, the pop-up menu 
next to email addresses lets you do the following:
»
» Send an email.
»
» Send an iMessage (see the “Communicating with Messages” section, later in 
this chapter).
»
» Send your vCard (see the following Tip) to this email address.
»
» Search for this email address in documents on your Mac using Spotlight (see 
Chapter 8).
The information for each contact can be sent to others in an industry-standard 
file format known as a vCard (virtual business card). Choosing Send My Card 
works the same as Send Email, but instead of starting with a totally blank email 
message, the message starts with your vCard enclosed. When the recipient opens 
the vCard file, all your contact information will be added to his or her Contacts (or 
other contact manager in Windows).
Working with stationery
I find stationery for email dorky, but if you think it’s the greatest thing since 
sliced kittens, here are some tips for working with it. First, to use it, click the 
Show Stationery button in a New Message window (refer to Figure 14-4).
FIGURE 14-5: 
Sending email 
to a contact 
is as easy as 
clicking.

CHAPTER 14  Communicating with Mail and Messages     255
I’m a Luddite when it comes to email. When I started using email a long, long time 
ago, it was considered bad form to add anything but text to an email message. It 
was generally agreed that email messages should include only what was necessary 
to convey the information and nothing more. That’s why all these froufrou flow-
ers and borders irritate me and why I find them a waste of bandwidth. So please 
do me a favor: If you decide to send me an email message, please don’t use goofy 
stationery. End rant.
Here are some tips to help you have more fun with stationery:
»
» Adding favorites: If you find you’re using a particular stationery template a lot, 
you can add it to the Favorites category to make it easier to use. To do so, merely 
click the appropriate category in the list on the left (Birthday, Announcements, 
Photos, Stationery, and Sentiments in Figure 14-6); then click the stationery you 
want to make a favorite and drag it onto the word Favorites in the list on the left. 
When Favorites is highlighted, drop the stationery, and — presto — that piece of 
stationery will appear when you click Favorites evermore.
»
» Replacing pictures: You can replace any picture in any stationery with a 
picture of your own. Just drag a picture — from Photo Browser 
(Window ➪ Photo Browser) or Finder — onto any picture in any piece of 
stationery. I’ve replaced the boilerplate text and all three of the dorky pictures 
in the Air Mail stationery, as shown in Figure 14-6.
FIGURE 14-6: 
Drag and drop 
your own 
pictures in 
stationery.

256     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
»
» Greeking out: You can change the Greek/pseudo-Latin text that appears in all 
the stationery by selecting it, deleting it, and typing whatever text you want to 
appear. You have to do it only once; the text you type in any stationery 
appears in all other stationeries. That also means that once you add pictures 
or text to any stationery, you can click any other stationery to see how it looks 
with that text and pictures.
»
» Removing stationery: If you decide you don’t want to use stationery with a 
message after you’ve applied it, click the Stationery category and choose the 
Original stationery, which changes your message back to an unadorned page 
with just the text and images you added.
Checking your mail
How do you check and open your mail? Easy. Just click the Get Mail button at the 
top of the main Mail window (refer to Figure 14-2) or press ⌘  +Shift+N.
»
» To read a new message, select it. Its contents appear in the Message 
Content pane.
»
» To delete a selected message, click the Delete button on the toolbar or press 
Delete (or Backspace) on your keyboard.
You can delete a message in one other way if you have a trackpad. Swipe with 
two fingers from right to left a little bit and the Trash button appears. Now 
you can click the Trash button or continue your swipe to the left a bit farther. 
Either way, the message will disappear into Mail’s Trash folder.
»
» To retrieve a message you accidentally deleted, click Trash on the left and 
drag the message to the Inbox or another mailbox.
»
» To configure Mail to send and check for your mail every x minutes, 
choose Mail ➪ Preferences and click the General icon at the top of the 
window. Click the Check for New Mail pop-up menu and make a selection — 
every 1, 5, 15, 30, or 60 minutes. The default is to automatically check for new 
mail every 5 minutes, so if you don’t want Mail to check automatically, choose 
Manually instead.
»
» To add a sender to Contacts: When someone who isn’t already in your 
Contacts sends you an email message, simply choose Message ➪ Add Sender 
to Contacts.
Adding a sender to your Contacts has an additional benefit: It guards mes-
sages from that person against being mistaken for junk mail. If a sender 
appears in your Contacts, his or her messages will never be mistakenly 
marked as junk mail. In other words, your Contacts is a white list for the spam 
filter. See the next section in this chapter for how to deal with spam.

CHAPTER 14  Communicating with Mail and Messages     257
When you receive an email containing details for an event, such as a flight or a 
dinner reservation, or even an invitation that says something like, Let’s have a 
beer at 6, a smart suggestion appears between the message’s header and body, 
so you can add the event to Calendar with just a click if you so desire. And, if you 
exchange email with people who are not in your Contacts, Mail lets you add them 
with a single click.
Dealing with spam
Speaking of junk mail . . . . Although email is a wonderful thing, some people 
out there try to spoil it. They are spammers, and they’re lowlifes who share their 
lists among themselves — and before you know it, your email inbox is flooded 
with get-rich-quick schemes, advertisements for pornographic websites and chat 
rooms, pills and powders that claim to perform miracles, and plenty of the more 
traditional buy-this-now junk mail.
Fortunately, Mail comes with a pretty darn good junk mail filter that analyzes 
incoming message subjects, senders, and contents to determine which ones are 
likely to contain bulk or junk mail. When you open Mail for the first time, it’s run-
ning in its training mode, which is how Mail learns to differentiate between what 
it considers junk mail and what you consider junk mail; all it needs is your input. 
Mail identifies messages it thinks are junk, but if you disagree with its decisions, 
here’s what you do:
»
» Click the Not Junk button in the brown bar for any message that isn’t junk mail.
»
» Conversely, if a piece of junk mail slips past Mail’s filters and ends up in the 
Inbox, select the message and click the Junk button on the Mail window 
toolbar.
After a few days (or weeks, depending on your mail volume), Mail should be get-
ting it right almost all the time. When you reach that point, choose Move It to the 
Junk Mailbox on the Junk Mail tab of Mail’s Preferences dialog. Now Mail starts 
moving junk mail automatically out of your Inbox and into a Junk mailbox, where 
you can scan the items quickly and trash them when you’re ready.
If you prefer to use your email provider or third-party spam filters, you can turn 
off junk mail processing in Mail by disabling it on the Junk Mail tab of Mail’s 
Preferences dialog.

258     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
Mailboxes smart and plain
After reading mail, you can either delete it or file it in a mailbox. The follow-
ing sections take a closer look at the two types of mailboxes you have at your  
disposal — plain and smart.
Plain old mailboxes
Plain mailboxes are just like folders in Finder; you create them and name them, 
and they’re empty until you put something in them. They even look like folders in 
the Mailboxes sidebar in Mail. You use mailboxes to organize any messages you 
want to save.
Here are two ways to create a plain mailbox:
»
» Choose Mailbox ➪ New Mailbox.
»
» Right-click or Control-click in the Mailboxes sidebar and choose New Mailbox 
from the shortcut menu.
Whichever way you choose, the next thing that happens is that a sheet drops down 
with a Location pop-up menu and a field for you to type the name you want to 
give this mailbox. Choose On My Mac from the Location menu to store your filed 
messages locally, on your hard drive; or choose iCloud or another email provider 
to store filed messages remotely, on the mail server.
Choosing iCloud or your email provider means messages you move to that mailbox 
will be stored remotely. If you access your email from more than one device, I rec-
ommend you create all your mailboxes on the email server so they’ll be available 
to you no matter where you are or what device you’re using to check your mail.
Finally, name the mailbox anything you like and click OK, and the mailbox is cre-
ated in the Mailboxes sidebar.
If you right- or Control-click a mailbox and choose New Mailbox, the Location 
menu in the sheet will show the name of the mailbox you clicked. So, if you were 
to click OK now, the new mailbox would be a sub-mailbox of the mailbox you 
clicked. Sub-mailboxes — mailboxes inside other mailboxes — are a useful feature 
if you care to further subdivide your message storage system.
In Figure 14-7, the MyArchive mailbox has four sub-mailboxes: Geek Cruises, Old 
Consulting, Old Travel, and Other.

CHAPTER 14  Communicating with Mail and Messages     259
Note how the top of the window tells you that four mailboxes are selected, with 
724 messages displayed. That happens to be the total number of messages in the 
highlighted mailboxes. Coincidence? I think not.
You can also drag and drop a mailbox or mailboxes from the top level of the list 
(For Dummies Books, Holding, Informal Classes, Moving|Selling, and so on in 
Figure 14-7) into another mailbox to make them sub-mailboxes. If you drag a 
mailbox into a sub-mailbox, it becomes a sub-sub-mailbox. And so on.
To delete a mailbox, do one of the following:
»
» Click it to select it and then choose Mailbox ➪ Delete Mailbox.
»
» Right-click or Control-click the mailbox, and choose Delete Mailbox.
Intelligent smart mailboxes
A smart mailbox is Mail’s version of Finder’s smart folder. In a nutshell, smart 
mailboxes are mailboxes that display the results of a search. The messages you 
see in a smart mailbox are virtual; they aren’t really in the smart mailbox itself. 
Instead, the smart mailbox displays a list of messages stored in other mailboxes 
that match whatever criteria you defined for that smart mailbox. Like smart fold-
ers in Finder, smart mailboxes are updated automatically when new messages 
that meet the criteria are received.
FIGURE 14-7: 
This mailbox 
is divided  
into four  
sub-mailboxes.

260     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
To create a smart mailbox:
»
» Choose Mailbox ➪ New Smart Mailbox.
»
» Click the +-in-a-circle on the right side of the Smart Mailboxes header in the 
Mailboxes sidebar (visible in Figure 14-8).
Whichever method you choose, a sheet drops down with a field for the smart 
mailbox’s name, plus some pop-up menus, buttons, and check boxes, as shown 
in Figure 14-8. This smart mailbox gathers messages with the words High Sierra 
in either the body or subject.
Name your smart mailbox, determine its criteria (by using the pop-up menus, 
plus and minus buttons, and check boxes), and then click OK. The smart mailbox 
appears in the Mailboxes sidebar with a little gear to denote that it’s smart. You 
can see the Smart High Sierra smart mailbox highlighted on the left in Figure 14-8.  
Note that it has a gear to its left (plain mailboxes don’t).
I use a smart mailbox that holds every mail message to or from my wife and chil-
dren in one place. And I use another to see all my Dummies email in a single place. 
Since they don’t use up any additional disk space, smart mailboxes are a great way 
to organize mail, automatically making it easier to find a message with no effort 
on your part (after you set them up).
Changing your preferences
Mail’s preferences (Mail ➪ Preferences or ⌘  +,) are more than you might expect 
from the name. The Mail Preferences window is the control center for Mail, where 
you can do the following
»
» Create and delete email accounts.
»
» Determine which fonts and colors are used for your messages.
FIGURE 14-8: 
Set criteria 
for a smart 
mailbox.

CHAPTER 14  Communicating with Mail and Messages     261
»
» Decide whether to download and save attachments (such as pictures).
»
» Decide whether to send formatted mail or plain text.
»
» Decide whether to turn on the spell checker. The default is to check 
spelling as you type, which many people (myself included) find annoying.
»
» Decide whether to have an automatic signature appended to your 
messages.
»
» Establish rules to process mail that you receive.
The first five items are up to you to decide. The last two are the most impor-
tant features of the Preferences window — namely, automatically adding your 
signature(s) to outgoing messages and inbound-mail processing rules.
Sign here, please
If you’re like me, you’d rather not type your entire signature every time you send 
an email message, and you don’t have to with Mail. If you create canned signa-
tures, you can use them in outgoing messages without typing a single character.
Here’s how it works:
1.	 Choose Mail ➪ Preferences or press ⌘  +, (comma).
2.	 In the Preferences dialog’s toolbar, click the Signatures icon.
3.	 In the left column, click the name of the mail account for which you want 
to create this signature.
I clicked iCloud in Figure 14-9.
FIGURE 14-9:

4.	 To create a new, blank signature, click the little + sign at the bottom of 
the middle column.
5.	 Type a descriptive name for this signature to replace the default name 
Signature #1.
The new default name in Figure 14-9 is BL Long.
6.	 In the right column, type the signature exactly as you want it to appear 
in outgoing messages.
I typed Regards, Bob “Dr. Mac” LeVitus -- Houston Chronicle, and so on in 
Figure 14-9.
7.	 Drag the name you assigned this signature (BL Long in Figure 14-9) to the 
mail account you’re using it with (iCloud in Figure 14-9).
If you have more than one signature, you can select the one you want to use as the 
default: Choose the account in the column on the left, and then choose the signa-
ture from the Choose Signature pop-up menu.
If you have more than one signature, another cool thing happens. The Signature 
pop-up menu appears in a new message, as shown in Figure 14-10, so you can 
choose a signature.
Mail rules rule
If you really want to tap the power of Mail, you need to set rules. With some cool 
rules, you can automatically tag messages with a color; file them in a specific 
mailbox; reply to, forward, or redirect the messages automatically (handy when 
you’re going to be away for a while); automatically reply to messages; and kill-file 
messages (just delete them without even bothering to look at them — what better 
fate for mail from people you hate?).
FIGURE 14-10: 
This menu 
shows all your 
signatures.

CHAPTER 14  Communicating with Mail and Messages     263
There’s no way I can do rules justice in a page or so, but here’s a quick look at how 
to create one. In broad terms, you create a condition and then an action. In this 
example, I create a filter named Message From LeVitus, with the action to sound 
a blow alert, as shown in Figure 14-11.
Here are the steps:
1.	 Choose Mail ➪ Preferences.
2.	 Click the Rules icon on the toolbar of the Preferences dialog.
3.	 Click the Add Rule button.
4.	 In the Description field, type a description.
I typed Message From LeVitus.
5.	 Click the first pop-up menu (which says Any in Figure 14-11) to determine 
when to apply this rule.
The options are Any or All. I chose Any, which is the default. Note that my 
choice in this menu doesn’t matter for this rule, which only has one condition.
6.	 Click the first pop-up menu in the Conditions section (From in Figure 14-11) 
to define the condition.
I chose From in Figure 14-11 but there are myriad other options, including Date 
Sent, Date Received, Sender Is or Isn’t in My Contacts, and Sender Is or Isn’t a 
Member of a Group. I implore you to explore them at your leisure.
7.	 Click the second pop-up menu in the Conditions section (Contains in 
Figure 14-11) and make a selection.
Your choices are Contains, Does Not Contain, Begins With, Ends With, or Is 
Equal To.
FIGURE 14-11: 
Setting a rule.

264     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
8.	In the field on the right side of the Conditions section, type a word or 
phrase.
I typed LeVitus, so my condition reads: From Contains LeVitus.
9.	Click the first pop-up menu in the Action section (Play Sound in 
Figure 14-11).
Look at your options in this pop-up menu (too numerous to mention) and 
choose one.
10.	Click the second pop-up menu in the Action section (Blow in Figure 14-11) 
to specify the sound you’ll hear when this action is triggered.
11.	Click OK.
Mail asks whether you want to apply your rule(s) to the selected mailboxes.
12.	Choose Apply if you want Mail to run this rule on the selected mailboxes, 
or choose Don’t Apply if you don’t.
And that’s how you build a rule. From this point forward, every time you get a 
message from someone named LeVitus, you hear the Blow sound.
Note the little + (plus) and – (minus) buttons to the right of each condition and 
action. Use the + button to add more conditions or actions and the – button to 
delete a condition or action. If you have multiple conditions, you can choose Any 
or All from the pop-up menu above them, which executes this rule when either 
any condition is met or all conditions are met. All the actions you create are always 
executed when this rule is triggered.
Take a (Quick) look and (Slide) show me  
some photos
One last cool feature, and you’re finished with Mail. That cool feature is Quick 
Look, which includes a slick Slideshow option. If you press and hold down on 
the button with the paper clip (shown in Figure 14-12) and choose Quick Look 
from the resulting drop-down menu, a new window appears showing one of the 
enclosed pictures, as shown lower right in Figure 14-12.
If you don’t see a paperclip, hover your cursor over the line between the message 
header and the message body and the paper clip will magically appear. Or click 
the image in the message body so it is highlighted, and then press the spacebar.
To close the Quick Look window, click the little X in its top-left corner or press 
the spacebar.

CHAPTER 14  Communicating with Mail and Messages     265
Markup and Mail Drop
Last but not by any means least, two Mail features that were introduced in  
Yosemite: Markup and Mail Drop.
Markup
Markup lets you annotate images or PDF documents. When you’re composing a 
message that has an image or a PDF you’ve attached or dragged in, hover the 
pointer over the picture and a little chevron (v) appears in its upper-right corner. 
Click it and choose Markup, as shown in Figure 14-13.
FIGURE 14-12: 
Using Quick 
Look.
FIGURE 14-13: 
Open the 
image in the 
Markup editor.

266     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
The image opens in a window in front of the message, as shown in Figure 14-14.
The tools at the top of the Markup editor are, from left to right: freehand pen, 
shapes, text, line thickness, line color, fill color, and text formatting. Click the one 
you want to use and draw or type your annotations. When you’re done, click Done.
Note that your annotations are saved in a copy of the image, not the original.
Markup strikes me as a solution looking for a problem to solve. I don’t get it. If 
I want to annotate an image or PDF, I fire up Preview (see Chapter 17) and use 
its annotation tools. The Markup editor is some weird kind of window that has 
no scroll bars and no way to resize it. Try it — you can move the entire window 
around, but that’s about it. Worse, there’s no way to zoom in or out. Preview, on 
the other hand, has the same tool set and much more, in a resizable window with 
zoom in and out commands at my fingertips. Needless to say, I don’t think much 
of Markup and don’t use it very much.
Mail Drop
Mail Drop, on the other hand, is an elegant solution for large email attach-
ments. If you enclose files or a folder full of files in a message and Mail thinks the 
enclosure(s) might be too big to send via email, an alert appears when you try to 
send the message. A picture is worth a thousand words, so check out my alert in 
Figure 14-15.
FIGURE 14-14: 
The Markup 
editor and 
some markup 
(the text and 
circle).

CHAPTER 14  Communicating with Mail and Messages     267
If I opt for Try Sending in Email, Mail will go ahead and try to send my message 
even though it has a total file size of 105.6 MB. Chances are pretty good, though, 
that the mail server I send the message through will bounce it back to me for 
being too large. But if I choose Use Mail Drop, which uses iCloud, the enclosure’s 
size can be huge and the message still won’t bounce. If I go this route, the recipi-
ent will receive a link to download the files from iCloud, as shown on the right in 
Figure 14-15.
Mail Drop should be enabled by default. If it’s not, choose Mail ➪ Preferences and 
click the Accounts icon at the top of the window. Then click the Advanced tab and 
enable the Send Large Attachments Mail Drop check box.
Communicating with Messages
Instant messaging (IM) and chat rooms enable interactive communication among 
users all over the world. Messages gives you immediate access to all the other users 
of AIM, Jabber, Google Talk, and iCloud. All you need are their screen names, and 
you’re set to go. You can even join any AOL chat room just by choosing File ➪ Go 
to Chat Room. To get started, launch Messages from your Applications folder, 
Launchpad, or the dock.
What the heck is an iMessage?
iMessage is Apple’s inter-device messaging protocol. That means you can send 
unlimited iMessages to anyone with an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch running iOS  
5 (or later) or a Mac running Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) or later.
Think of it as MMS messaging, similar to what you find on smartphones, but 
you can send and receive messages from your Mac. Better still, an iMessage can 
include photos, audio recordings, videos, locations, and contacts in addition, of 
course, to text. And if you have more than one iOS device or Mac, iMessage keeps 
all your conversations going across all of them. You can also get delivery receipts 
FIGURE 14-15: 
Choose Mail 
Drop in the 
alert box (left), 
and your 
recipient sees 
this (right).

268     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
letting you know your messages went through. You’ll know it’s been read, too, if 
your friend has enabled read receipts.
If you have an iPhone 4 or newer, the Continuity feature allows all SMS and MMS 
text messages you send and receive on your iPhone via your wireless carrier’s 
messaging system to appear also in the Messages app on your Mac, iPad, and 
iPod touch almost simultaneously — even if the person you’re messaging doesn’t 
have an iPhone. Better yet, you can reply from whichever device is closest to you, 
regardless of what kind of cellphone the person has. You can also start a new 
iMessage by clicking a phone number in Safari, Contacts, or Calendar.
Chit-chatting with Messages
Your chats can be one to one, or they can be group bull sessions. Messages is inte-
grated with Contacts, so you don’t have to enter your buddies’ information twice. 
It also communicates directly with the Mail application. Here’s all the essential 
info you need to get started:
»
» To start a text chat, open Messages, select a buddy in your buddy list, and 
choose Buddies ➪ Start New Chat. If you don’t see your Buddies List, choose 
Window ➪ Buddies or press ⌘  +1.
In Figure 14-16, I sent the first message to my wife from Messages on my Mac. 
She replied from her iPhone. In a chat, each participant’s text appears in a 
different color; my words are in blue bubbles with white text; hers are in gray 
bubbles with black text.
FIGURE 14-16: 
A chat 
between my 
wife and me.

CHAPTER 14  Communicating with Mail and Messages     269
»
» To start a group text chat, hold down the ⌘   key, click each person in your 
buddy list that you want to include, and then click the A button at the bottom 
of the buddy list. Or type multiple names in the To field. In a group text chat, 
everyone sees every message from every participant.
Click Details at the top right, and you can use your iPhone (if it’s nearby) to call 
someone by clicking the phone icon next to the person’s name. You can also 
choose Do Not Disturb for this conversation to mute notifications for this 
conversation only, which is great if one or more participants is a serial texter. 
Finally, click Leave This Conversation if you want to, well, leave this conversa-
tion permanently.
»
» To attach a picture to a person in your Contacts (as I have for myself on 
both Macs), copy a picture of the person to the Clipboard in your favorite 
graphics application (Preview, for example). Now open Contacts, and display 
the card for the person you want to add a picture to. Click the empty picture 
box at the top of the card, and paste the picture from the Clipboard. You 
should now see that picture on the Contacts card and also when you chat in 
Messages with the person. Neat!
If you already attached a picture to a contact in Contacts, that picture will 
appear automatically when you chat.
»
» To transfer a file or files, just drag the icon(s) to the text field (where you 
type your messages), and then press Return. The file zips across the ether. 
This is a convenient way to share photos or documents without resorting to 
file sharing or email.
When you drag an image file onto the Messages window’s message box, you 
see an oversize semitransparent preview, letting you know you’re sure you’re 
sending the right image and not something totally embarrassing. Way to go, 
macOS High Sierra.
You could also choose Buddies ➪ Send File or press ⌘  +Option+F and then 
select the file(s) from a standard Open File sheet, but the drag-and-drop 
method is faster and easier.
»
» To send a voice message, click the microphone icon on the right of the text 
field where you type your messages and begin talking. When you’re finished, 
click the red Record button and then click Cancel or Send.
»
» To send an email from Messages, just select a buddy in the Messages buddy 
list and choose Buddies ➪ Send Email (or press ⌘  +Option+E). Mail launches (if 
it’s not already open) and addresses a new message to the selected buddy, 
ready for you to begin typing.


CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     271
Sharing Your Mac 
and Liking It
H
ave you ever wanted to grab a file from your Mac while you were halfway 
around the world or even around the corner or in the next room? If so,  
I have good news for you: It’s not difficult with macOS (believe it or not) 
even though computer networking in general has a well-deserved reputation for 
being complicated and nerve-wracking. The truth is that you won’t encounter 
anything scary or complicated about sharing files, folders, and disks (and print-
ers, for that matter) among computers as long as the computers are Macs. And 
even if some of the computers are running Windows, macOS High Sierra even 
makes that (almost) painless.
Your Macintosh includes everything that you need to share files and printers, 
except the printers and the cables (and maybe a router). So here’s the deal: You 
supply the hardware, and this chapter supplies the rest. And when you’ve finished 
hooking it all up, you can take a rest.

272     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
The first sections of this chapter provide an overview and tell you everything you 
need to know to set up new user accounts and share files successfully. I don’t 
show you how to actually share a file, folder, or disk until the “Connecting to a 
Shared Disk or Folder on a Remote Mac” section, later in this chapter. Trust me, 
there’s a method to my madness. If you try to share files without doing all the 
required prep work, the whole mess becomes confusing and complicated pretty 
fast — kind of like networking PCs.
One last thing: If you’re the only one who uses your Mac, you don’t intend to 
share it or its files with anyone else, and you never intend to access your Mac from 
another computer in a different location, you can safely skip this chapter.
Introducing Networks and  
File Sharing
High Sierra’s file sharing enables you to use files, folders, and disks from other 
Macs on a network — including the Internet — as easily as though they were on 
your own local hard drive. If you have more than one computer, file sharing is a 
blessing.
Before diving in and sharing, allow me to introduce a few necessary terms:
»
» Network: For the purposes of this chapter, a network is two or more Macs 
connected by Ethernet cables, wireless networking (Apple refers to this as 
AirPort or Wi-Fi), or FireWire cables (rarely seen anymore).
»
» Ethernet: This network protocol and cabling scheme lets you connect two or 
more computers so they can share files, disks, printers, or whatever.
»
» Ethernet port: This is where you plug an Ethernet cable into your Mac (as 
long as your Mac has one — not all Macs do.
Be careful to match the cable to its specific jack. On your Mac and printer, the 
Ethernet ports look a lot like a phone jack, and the connectors on each end of 
an Ethernet cable look a lot like phone cable connectors — but they aren’t the 
same. Ethernet cables are typically thicker, and the connectors (RJ-45 connec-
tors) are a bit larger than the RJ-11 connectors that you use with telephones. 
(See examples of both types of ports in the margin.) Standard phone cables fit 
(very loosely) into Ethernet ports, but you shouldn’t try that, either; they’ll 

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     273
probably fall out with the slightest vibration. It’s unlikely that such a mistake 
will cause damage, but it won’t work and will be frustrating.
If your Mac didn’t include an Ethernet port but you’d like one, you can find 
Thunderbolt and USB adapters that will let you have your cake (and Ethernet 
port) and eat it too (plug it into a Thunderbolt or USB port).
»
» Local devices: Such devices are connected directly to your computers, such 
as hard or optical drives. Your internal hard drive, for example, is a local 
device.
»
» Remote devices: You access (share) these devices over the network. The hard 
drive of a computer in the next room, for example, is a remote device.
»
» Protocols: These are the languages that networks speak. When you read or 
hear about networks, you’re likely to hear the words Bonjour, Ethernet, SMB, 
and TCP/IP bandied about with great regularity. These are all protocols. 
Macs can speak several different protocols, but every device (Mac or printer) 
on a network needs to speak the same protocol at the same time to 
communicate.
Support for the TCP/IP protocol is built into every Mac, and macOS High Sierra 
includes all the software you need to set up a TCP/IP network. The hardware 
you provide consists of Ethernet cables and a hub (if you have more than two 
computers) or an AirPort or other Wi-Fi base station. Here, I’m using hub 
generically; its more powerful networking cousins, switches and routers, also 
work for this purpose.
By the way, in addition to providing wireless networking, the AirPort Extreme 
wireless base stations — as well as the Time Capsule device — are all members of 
the router class of devices. Time Capsule is a pretty cool deal: It combines a wireless 
base station, a three-port Ethernet router, and a big hard drive that can be shared 
by all computers on the network and also used as a Time Machine backup disk.
Portrait of home office networking
A typical Mac home office network consists of two Macintoshes, an AirPort 
Extreme wireless base station (or other type of Ethernet hub, switch, or router), 
and a network printer. Check out Figure 15-1 to see the configuration of a simple 
network. In the figure, the black lines between the devices are Ethernet cables; the 
rectangular device with those cables going into it is an Ethernet hub, a router, an 
AirPort Extreme base station, or a Time Capsule. (I tell you more about cables and 
such devices in the section “Three ways to build a network,” later in this chapter.) 
You need enough Ethernet cable to run among all your devices.

274     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
With the setup shown in Figure 15-1, either Mac can use the other Mac’s files, and 
both Macs can print to the same printer. If you have a broadband Internet connec-
tion, you can also connect the cable or DSL modem to the hub/switch/router so all 
Mac users on the network can share the Internet connection.
A network can — and often does — have dozens or hundreds of users. Whether 
your network has 2 nodes (machines) or 2,000, the principles and techniques in 
this chapter apply.
Three ways to build a network
In this chapter, I assume you’re working on a small network, the kind typically 
found in a home or small business. If you’re part of a megamonstrous corporate 
network, and you have questions about your particular network, talk to the PIC 
(person in charge, also known as your network administrator). In other words, if 
you’re trying to build a meganetwork, you’re going to need a book a lot thicker 
and harder to understand than this one.
The following list gives you three common ways to build a modern small home or 
office network:
»
» Wi-Fi: All Macs come equipped with Wi-Fi; if you have an AirPort or AirPort 
Extreme base station, a Time Capsule, or any other Wi-Fi router, you don’t 
need cables at all.
For what it’s worth, you could also use most third-party Wi-Fi routers, but if 
you go that route, you’re on your own.
FIGURE 15-1: 
Two Macs and 
a printer make 
up a simple 
Mac network.

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     275
FILE SHARING MADE EASY WITH AIRDROP
Perhaps all you want to do is share an occasional file (not necessarily a printer or a home 
Internet connection or a folder of music files or pictures). In that case, check out AirDrop 
(available on Macs built in the past few years), which uses Bonjour, Apple’s proprietary 
zero-configuration network protocol. It’s a big part of the secret sauce in macOS that 
makes Mac networking so simple.
Here’s how it works: If two devices (and this includes all Macs running macOS 10.2 Jaguar 
or later) speak Bonjour, you don’t have to do any configuration other than, possibly, 
turning on the sharing capability, as I explain in “Setting Up File Sharing,” later in this 
chapter. Bonjour queries the other available networked devices to see what services 
they support and then configures the connections for you automatically. Sweet!
It gets even better if you’re using macOS 10.7 Lion or later, because you can use the nifty 
sharing feature called AirDrop. It appears in your Finder window sidebar and locates all 
other AirDrop-capable Macs on your local wireless network.
And it’s better still if you’re using macOS 10.10 Yosemite or later, because in these ver-
sions, AirDrop can also locate and share files with AirDrop-capable iPhones, iPads, and 
iPod touches. Sweeter!
The only caveats are that AirDrop is Wi-Fi only, and users must enable AirDrop from 
Control Center on iDevices or by selecting it in the sidebar on a Mac’s Finder window.  
On a Mac, you see AirDrop in the Finder window, as shown in the figure here.
(continued)

276     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
Just plug in the base station, and Macs can communicate with one another. If 
you use an Ethernet printer (connected to your Mac by Ethernet cable), you 
have to connect it to the base station before you can print from your wireless 
Macs. Both the base station and printer have Ethernet ports, so you can use 
an Ethernet cable (more about that in a minute) to make the connection.
Recent vintage AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule devices from Apple include 
a USB port so you can connect any printer via USB and share it wirelessly 
(rather than having to use a more expensive Ethernet-equipped networkable 
printer).
Although this setup is more expensive than connecting everything with 
Ethernet cables and a cheap hub or router, it’s also more flexible because you 
can move your devices anywhere. (Well, almost anywhere; you’re limited to a 
maximum of 150 to 200 feet from each base station, and that’s assuming that 
nothing is in the way to block your signal. Your mileage may vary.) That said, 
Ethernet is usually significantly faster than Wi-Fi.
I’ve been using wireless printers for years. If you have a Wi-Fi network 
available, many inexpensive printers (and expensive ones, too) now offer 
wireless printing, which means you can stash your printer in a closet or 
another room if you care to.
»
» Traditional Ethernet: Most modern Macs have an Ethernet port, with the 
exception of the MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro with Retina 
display. To connect Ethernet-equipped Macs to a wired network, you need 
Ethernet cables for each Mac and a little device called a hub, switch, or router. 
This device is like the center of a wheel; the wires coming out of it are the 
spokes.
A typical Ethernet router includes two to eight Ethernet ports. You plug the 
router into an electrical outlet and then connect Ethernet cables from each of 
your Macs and printers (from their Ethernet ports) to the router. Voilà —  
instant network. These gadgets are pretty cheap, starting at around $30; 
cables start at a few bucks, increasing in price with the length and quality.
To send a file (or multiple files and/or folders) to the other Mac or iDevice, just drag it 
onto the other Mac’s or iDevice’s icon as shown. AirDrop displays a dialog on the other 
Mac asking whether the user wants to accept delivery; if so, the items are transferred 
immediately to the Downloads folder on the Mac. If you’re sending to an iDevice, its user 
gets an alert asking whether to accept the file, and then is asked what app to open it in 
using a familiar Share sheetlike interface.
When you close the AirDrop window, you’re no longer visible to other AirDrop users.
(continued)

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     277
»
» Small Ethernet: If you have only two devices to network (two Macs, or a Mac 
and an Ethernet printer, in most cases), you can use an Ethernet cable to 
connect them directly to each other via the Ethernet ports. You can purchase 
an Ethernet cable at your local electronics store. Plug one end of the Ethernet 
cable into one device and the other end into the other device.
If you use an Apple AirPort Extreme base station or Time Capsule, you may not 
need a hub, switch, or router because these devices incorporate small routers with 
three Ethernet ports. Either one is all you need unless you have more than three 
Ethernet devices to connect. If that’s the case, you’ll need to add a hub, switch, 
or router with additional Ethernet ports to accommodate them all (in addition to 
your AirPort or Time Capsule).
If you have a cable modem or digital subscriber line (DSL) as your Internet con-
nection, you might need a router or switch instead of a (cheaper-but-going-out- 
of-fashion) hub. Routers and switches are similar to hubs but cost more and have 
additional features that you may or may not need. Your ISP can tell you whether 
you need one.
Setting Up File Sharing
Before you get into the nitty-gritty of sharing files, you must complete a few 
housekeeping tasks, such as enabling the appropriate type of file sharing. Follow 
these steps to do so:
1.	 Choose   ➪  System Preferences and then click the Sharing icon.
The Sharing System Preferences pane appears. The first word of the long 
username of the first admin account created on this computer appears in the 
Computer Name field by default, followed by the type of Mac (for example, 
Robert LeVitus’ MacBook Pro).
2.	 If you want to change the name of your computer from whatever High 
Sierra decided to call it to something more personal, do that now in the 
Computer Name text field at the top of the Sharing pane.
In Figure 15-2, you can see that I renamed mine High Sierra MacBook Air. You 
can name yours anything you like.
3.	 Enable the check box for File Sharing, as shown in Figure 15-2.
Now other users on your network can access files and folders on your 
computer, as you see later in this chapter.

278     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
By default, only one folder in your Home folder is shared, and that folder is 
your Public folder. If you want to access files or folders on this computer while 
you’re using another computer on the network, you can so long as you first 
provide your username and password. Everyone else on the network can see 
only your Public folder.
These are the safest settings. Unless you have good reason to tinker with 
them, you should probably not change anything here. That said, if you feel you 
must change these settings, you find out how to do so in the next section of 
this chapter.
4.	 (Optional) If you want remote users to upload and download files to and 
from this computer, click the Options button and then select either or 
both of the Share Files and Folders Using AFP or SMB check boxes.
Doing so gives users on the Internet but not on your local area network (LAN) 
some alternatives to file sharing: an Apple File Protocol (AFP) or a client 
program that uses Server Message Block (Samba, or SMB).
If you want to enable Windows or Linux users — or users of other operating 
systems — to share files with you, the SMB check box must be selected.
Select the On check box (in the leftmost column) for each account you want to 
enable to use these protocols to access your Mac, providing the password 
when prompted.
5.	 Click the Done button when you’re done, and then proceed to the 
following section to continue setting up your network.

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     279
Access and Permissions: Who Can Do What
After you set up file sharing (as I explain in the preceding section), your next step 
on the path to sharing files on a network is telling your Mac who is allowed to see 
and access specific folders. Fortunately, this happens to be what I cover in the 
following sections.
Users and groups and guests
Mac file sharing (and indeed, macOS as well) is based on the concept of users. You 
can share items — such as drives or folders — with no users, one user, or many 
users, depending on your needs.
Before you can understand how file sharing works, you need to grok the terminol-
ogy. So here are brief descriptions of users, administrators, groups, and guests:
»
» Users: People who share folders and drives (or your Mac) are users. A user’s 
access to items on your local hard drive is entirely at your discretion. You can 
configure your Mac so only you can access its folders and drives, or so only 
one other person or group — or everyone — can share its folders and drives.
When you first set up your Mac, you created your first user. This user automati-
cally has administrative powers, such as adding more users, changing prefer-
ences, and having the clearance to see all folders on the hard drive.
For the purposes of this book, I assume that some users for whom you create 
identities will be not folks who sit at your Mac but those who connect to it only from 
remote locations when they need to give or get files. But you could allow such a 
user to use the same name and password to log in while sitting at your desk.
For most intents and purposes, a remote user and a local user are the same. 
Here’s why: After you create an account for a user, that user can log in to your 
Mac while sitting in your chair in your office, from anywhere on your local area 
network via Ethernet, or from anywhere in the world via the Internet if you 
give the person an administrator, a standard, or a managed account.
»
» Administrative users: Although a complete discussion of the special 
permissions that a user with administrator permissions has on a Mac running 
macOS is far beyond the scope of this book, note two important things:
•	 The first user created (usually when you install macOS for the first time) is 
automatically granted administrator (admin) powers.
•	 Only an administrator account can create new users, delete some (but not 
all) files from folders that aren’t in his or her Home folder, lock and unlock 
System Preferences panes, and do a bunch of other stuff. If you try 

280     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
something and it doesn’t work, make sure you’re logged in as an adminis-
trator or can provide an administrator username and password when 
prompted.
You can give any user administrator permissions by selecting that user’s 
account in the Users & Groups System Preferences pane and selecting the 
Allow User to Administer This Computer check box. You can select this check 
box when you’re creating the user account or anytime thereafter.
»
» Groups: Groups are Unix-level designations for privilege consolidation. For 
example, there are groups named Staff and Everyone (as well as a bunch of 
others). A user can be a member of multiple groups. For example, your main 
account is in the Staff, Admin, and Everyone groups (and others, too). Don’t 
worry — you find out more about groups shortly.
»
» Guests: Two kinds of guests exist. The first kind lets your friends log into your 
Mac while sitting at your desk without user accounts or passwords. But they 
have no access to your data. When they log out, all information and files in the 
guest user account’s Home folder are deleted automatically.
If you want this kind of guest user account, you need to enable the account in 
the Users & Groups System Preferences pane. To do so, click Guest User 
account in the list of accounts on the left and select the Allow Guests to Log In 
to This Computer check box.
The second kind of guest is people who access Public folders on your Mac via 
file sharing over your LAN or the Internet. They don’t need usernames or 
passwords. If they’re on your LAN, they can see and use your Public folder(s), 
unless you or the Public folder’s owner has altered the permissions. If they’re 
on the Internet and know your IP address, they can see and use your Public 
folder(s) if you don’t have a firewall blocking such access. Public folders are all 
that guests can access, luckily. You don’t have to do anything to enable this 
type of guest user account.
Creating users
Before users can share folders and drives (or have their own accounts on your 
computer, for that matter), they must have an account on your Mac. You can cre-
ate two different kinds of accounts for them — a user account or a sharing only 
account.
»
» When you create a user account for a person (I call that person and account 
User 1), the account has its own Home folder (called — what else? — User 1), 
which is filled with User 1’s files. Nobody but User 1 can access files in this 
Home folder unless, of course, User 1 has provided someone the account 
name and password.

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     281
»
» When you create a sharing only account for a person (I call that person and 
account Sharing 1), the person using that account doesn’t have a Home folder 
and can’t access other users’ Home folders. Sharing 1 can access only the 
Public folders inside all the Home folders on that Mac.
You can create a new user account only in the Users & Groups System Preferences 
pane. You can create a new sharing only account in either the Users & Groups or 
Sharing System Preferences panes.
Anyone can remotely access files or folders in your Public folder(s) over a LAN or 
the Internet. But if you want them to be able to access folders or files other than 
those in the Public folder(s) on your Mac, they need either a user account or a 
sharing only account.
When you add (create) a user, you need to tell your Mac who this person is. This 
is also the time to set passwords and administrative powers for this new user. 
Here’s the drill:
1.	 Choose  ➪  System Preferences (or click the System Preferences icon on 
the dock), click the Users & Groups icon, and then make sure that the 
Password tab is selected.
The Users & Groups System Preferences pane appears. In this pane (shown in 
Figure 15-3), you can see the name of the first user (High Sierra Bob) and the 
administrative control that this user is allowed.
The first user created (usually at the same time you installed macOS or turned 
on a brand-new Mac) always has administrator permissions. This is why the 
Allow User to Administer This Computer check box is selected but the option is 
dimmed in Figure 15-3. (The first user created is always an admin.)
FIGURE 15-3: 
The Users & 
Groups System 
Preferences 
pane is where 
you manage 
user accounts 
on this Mac.

282     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
2.	 Click the + button below the list of users.
A sheet appears in which you enter the new user’s information.
If the + button is dimmed, here’s how you get it functioning: Click the lock (at 
bottom left), supply an administrator name and password in the resulting 
dialog, and then click OK.
3.	 Choose Standard from the New Account menu.
4.	 In the Full Name text box, type the full name of a user you want to add.
In the Account Name text box, your Mac inserts a suggested account name 
(formerly known as the short name). Check out Figure 15-4 to see both.
In Figure 15-4, I added Steve Wozniak as a user, typing his full name in the 
Full Name field. You don’t really need to type the user’s full name, but I do 
so in this example to show you the difference between a full name and an 
account name.
5.	 Press the Tab key to move to the next field.
macOS suggests an abbreviated version of the name in the Account 
Name field.
Because he’s not the only Steve who matters around here, I changed the 
account name suggested by macOS (stevewozniak) to TheWoz, which is 
shorter. (In other words, I typed TheWoz in the Account Name field, replac-
ing the suggested stevewozniak.) The name of each user’s folder (in the 
Users folder) is taken from the account name that you enter when you 
create a user.
FIGURE 15-4: 
Name the new 
user, and your 
Mac suggests 
a shortened 
name and 
password.

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     283
Users can connect to your Mac (or log in from their own Macs, for that matter) 
by using the account name, rather than having to type their full names. The 
account name is also used in environments in which usernames can’t have 
spaces and are limited to eight or fewer characters. Although macOS High 
Sierra allows longer usernames (but no spaces), you might be better off 
keeping your account name shorter than eight characters, just in case.
6.	Tab to the Password field and enter an initial password for this user.
The small, square button with the key to the right of the Password field, when 
clicked, displays the Password Assistant. You can use the Password Assistant, 
as seen below the New Account sheet in Figure 15-4, to help generate a 
password that should be fairly easy for the user to remember (choose 
Memorable from the Password Assistant’s Type pop-up menu) but hard for a 
cracking program to guess (or meet other requirements).
To make your password even harder to guess or crack, choose Random or 
FIPS-181–compliant from the Password Assistant’s Type pop-up menu. It will 
also make it harder for you to remember, so make sure you either memorize it 
or store it in a safe place.
7.	Press the Tab key to move your pointer to the Verify text field.
8.	In the Verify text box, type the password again to verify it.
9.	(Optional) To help remember a password, type something in the 
Password Hint text box to jog the user’s memory.
If a user forgets her password and asks for a hint, the text that you type in the 
Password Hint field pops up, ideally causing the user to exclaim, “Oh, 
yeah . . . now I remember!” A password hint should be something simple 
enough to jog the user’s memory but not so simple that an unauthorized 
person can guess. Perhaps something like “Your first teddy bear’s name 
backward” would be a good hint. And, of course, you should never include the 
password in the hint.
10.	Click the Create User button to create the account.
The sheet disappears, and the new user now appears in the Users & Groups 
System Preferences pane’s Users list.
11.	(Optional) Click the account picture and choose a different one.
macOS suggests a picture from its default collection for each account, but you 
can select a different one from the sheet that appears when you click the 
account picture. Or choose Camera in the sheet and take a photo with an 
attached or built-in camera (such as iSight).

284     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
Changing a user
Circumstances might dictate that you need to change a user’s identity, password, 
or accessibility, or perhaps delete a user. Follow these steps to change a user’s 
name, password, or account type:
1.	 Choose  ➪  System Preferences (or click the System Preferences icon on 
the dock or Launchpad).
The System Preferences window appears.
2.	 In the System Preferences window, click the Users & Groups icon.
The Users & Groups System Preferences pane appears.
If the lock icon at the bottom of the window is locked, you have to click it and 
provide an administrator password before you can proceed.
3.	 Select the user’s name in the accounts list.
The information for that person appears.
4.	 Make your changes by selecting the existing username and replacing the 
old with new text or a different setting.
•	 If you want to change the password, click the Reset Password button and 
make your changes in the sheet that appears.
•	 To change the picture or other capabilities, click the Picture, Login Options, 
Allow User to Administer This Computer (to enable or disable administra-
tor privileges), or Enable Parental Control check box (more on this in a 
moment) and make the appropriate changes.
To change a user, you must be logged in using an account that has 
administrator powers.
5.	 Quit the System Preferences application or choose a different System 
Preferences pane.
Your changes are saved when you leave the Users & Groups pane.
Removing a user
To delete a user — in effect, to deny that user access to your Mac — select the user 
you want to delete in the list of accounts and click the – (minus sign) button. A 
sheet appears, offering three choices:
»
» Save the Home Folder in a Disk Image saves a disk image of the user’s 
Home folder in a folder named Deleted Users (which it creates inside the 
Users folder).

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     285
» Don’t Change the Home Folder removes the user from the Users & Groups 
System Preferences pane and login screen but leaves that user’s Home folder 
in the Users folder. (Deleted) is appended to the folder’s name, so if I had 
selected this option in the previous example, Steve Wozniak’s Home folder 
would be renamed Steve (Deleted).
» Delete the Home Folder does what it says. You have the option of a secure 
erase (the contents get overwritten multiple times) if you select this option.
Be certain you really want to kiss that Home folder goodbye, because after 
you delete it there’s no way to get it back.
To remove a user from your Mac, you must be logged in using an account that 
has administrator permissions. And you can’t remove the first user ever created 
on this Mac.
Limiting a user’s capabilities
Sometimes — especially with younger children, computerphobic family members, 
or employees in a small business — you want to limit what users can access. For 
example, you might want to make certain programs off-limits.
Here’s how to enable Parental Controls in the Users & Groups System Preferences 
pane:
1.
Choose ➪  System Preferences (or click the System Preferences icon on 
the dock).
The System Preferences window appears.
2.
In the System Preferences window, click the Users & Groups icon.
The Users & Groups Preferences pane appears.
3.
Click the user’s name to select it, select the Enable Parental Controls 
check box, and then click the Open Parental Controls button.
Note that clicking the Open Parental Controls button without first selecting the 
Enable Parental Controls check box puts you in the Parental Controls System 
Preferences pane with a button front and center for you to click to turn on 
Parental Controls. So either select the check box as instructed or click the 
Enable Parental Controls button here.
To change any of these items, you must be logged in using an account that has 
administrator powers, and the account you’re modifying can’t have administra-
tor powers.
The Parental Controls System Preferences pane for that person appears with 
six tabs: Apps, Web, Stores, Time (shown in Figure 15-5), Privacy, and Other.

286     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
4.	 Set the controls in each of the six tabs.
•	 Apps: Determine whether the user is restricted to a very limited and 
simplified Finder interface and which applications the user may access. 
Also set whether the user can modify the dock and whether Mail commu-
nicants are limited to a specified list. This option also lets you notify 
someone (usually yourself) by email if the user tries to exchange email with 
a contact who is not in the approved list. You can also disallow joining 
Game Center multiplayer games or adding Game Center friends.
•	 Web: Control access to websites.
•	 Stores: Control access to iTunes and iBooks Stores, including age-based 
restrictions for movies, TV shows, and apps.
•	 Time: Set time limits for weekdays and weekends and prevent access to 
this computer during specified hours on school nights and weekends.
The School Nights option doesn’t account for holidays or vacations and such.
•	 Privacy: Determine whether third-party apps can access Contacts, Calendar, 
Reminder, and other data.
•	 Other: Determine whether profanity is hidden during Dictionary access, 
control whether the user can add or remove printers or modify printer 
settings, prevent (or allow) burning CDs and DVDs in Finder, and control 
whether the user is allowed to change his password.
You can also disable Dictation and prevent the user from modifying the dock.
5.	 Quit the System Preferences application or choose a different System 
Preferences pane.
Your changes are saved when you leave the Parental Controls pane.
FIGURE 15-5: 
You can 
control an 
account’s 
access in six 
categories (the 
Time tab is 
shown here).

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     287
A quicker way to set or change Parental Controls for an existing account is to click 
the Parental Controls icon in the System Preferences application (instead of Users &  
Groups). Note that enabling Parental Controls on an account will disable its 
administrator access (if it has administrator access).
Last but not least, you can apply Parental Controls to the guest user account.
To turn off Parental Controls for a managed account, navigate to the Parental 
Controls System Preferences pane, select the account in the list on the left, click 
the Action menu (gear icon) at the bottom of the list, and choose Turn Off Parental 
Controls for <username>.
If you want to apply the same Parental Controls settings to more than one user, 
set them as just described for the first user and then select that account in the 
Accounts list in Parental Controls, click the Action menu, and choose Copy Set-
tings. Then select the user for whom you want to have the same settings, click the 
Action menu, and choose Paste Settings.
And one last thing: Although they’re called Parental Controls, you can use them 
with adults, too. For example, it’s often useful to restrict access to certain features 
on your guest user account. Just a thought.
macOS knows best: Folders shared  
by default
When you add users in the Users & Groups System Preferences pane as I describe 
earlier, macOS automatically does two things behind the scenes to facilitate file 
sharing: It creates a set of folders, and it makes some of them available for sharing.
Each time you add a managed, standard, or administrator user, macOS creates a 
Home folder hierarchy for that user on the Mac. The user can create more folders 
(if necessary) and also add, remove, or move anything inside these folders. Even 
if you create a user account solely to allow him or her to exchange files with you, 
your Mac automatically creates a Home folder for that user. Unless you, as the 
owner of your Mac, give permission, the user can’t see inside or use folders out-
side the Home folder (which has the user’s name), with only three exceptions: the 
Shared folder in the Users folder, the top level of other user account folders; the 
Public folders in every user’s folder; and the Shared folder within the Users folder. 
A description of the latter follows:
»
» Public: A Public folder is located inside each user’s folder. That folder is set up 
to be accessible (shared) by any user who can log in to the Mac. Furthermore, 
any user can log in (as a guest) and copy things out of this folder as long as 

288     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
she knows your Mac’s IP address, even if she doesn’t have an account on this 
Mac at all. Files put into the Public folder can be opened or copied freely.
It’s not hard for someone to obtain your IP address. For example, when you 
visit most web pages, your IP address is saved to that site’s log file. So be 
careful what you put in your Public folder. Protecting your data is also a fine 
reason to employ a firewall. High Sierra has an excellent software implemen-
tation available via the Firewall tab in Security & Privacy System Preferences 
(see Chapter 21), and most routers (for example, AirPort Extreme) include a 
hardware firewall.
Inside each user’s Public folder is a Drop Box folder. As the name implies, this 
folder is where others can drop a file or folder for you. Only the owner can 
open the Drop Box to see what’s inside — or to move or copy the files that are 
in it. Imagine a street-corner mailbox: After you drop your letter in, it’s gone, 
and you can’t get it back out.
A popular cloud-based storage service is called Dropbox. The Drop Box folder 
in your Public folder has nothing to do with that Dropbox service beyond 
having a similar name.
»
» Shared: In addition to a Public folder for each user, macOS creates one 
Shared folder on every Mac for all users of this Mac. The Shared folder isn’t 
available to guests, but it is available to all users who have an account on this 
Mac. You find the Shared folder within the Users folder (the same folder 
where you find folders for each user). The Shared folder is the right place to 
put stuff that everyone with an account on this Mac might want to use. (Check 
out my introduction to the Mac OS High Sierra folder structure in Chapter 6.)
Sharing a folder or disk by  
setting permissions
As you might expect, permissions control who can use a given folder or any disk 
(or partition) other than the startup disk.
Why can’t you share the startup disk? Because macOS won’t let you. Why not? 
Because the startup disk contains the operating system and other stuff that 
nobody else should have access to.
Throughout the rest of this chapter, whenever I talk about sharing a folder, I also 
mean sharing disks and disk partitions other than your startup disk (which, when you 
think of it, are nothing more than big folders anyway). Why am I telling you this? 
Because it’s awkward to keep typing a folder or any disk (or partition) other than your 
startup disk. So anything that I say about sharing a folder also applies to sharing 
any disk (or partition) other than your startup disk. Got it?

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     289
You can set permissions for
»
» The folder’s owner
»
» A subset of all the people who have accounts on the Mac (a group)
»
» People who have the Mac’s address, whether they have an account or not 
(guests)
To help you get a better handle on these relationships, a closer look at permis-
sions, owners, and groups is coming right up.
Contemplating permissions
When you consider who can use which folders, three distinct kinds of users exist 
on the network. I describe each of them in this section. Then, in the “Useful set-
tings for permissions” section, later in this chapter, I show you how to share fold-
ers with each type of user. Here’s a quick introduction to the different user types:
»
» Owner: The owner of a folder or disk can change the permissions to that 
folder or disk at any time. The name you enter when you log in to your 
Mac — or the name of your Home folder — is the default owner of Shared 
folders and drives on that machine. Ownership can be given away (more on 
that in the “Useful settings for permissions” section, later in this chapter). Even 
if you own the Mac, you can’t change permissions for a folder on it that 
belongs to another user (unless you get Unix-y and do so as root). The owner 
must be logged in to change permissions on his folders.
macOS is the owner of many folders outside the Users folder. If macOS owns 
it, you can see that “system” is its owner if you select the folder and choose 
File  ➪  Get Info (or press ⌘  +I).
Folders that aren’t in the User directories generally belong to system; it’s 
almost always a bad idea to change the permissions on any folder owned by 
system.
If you must change permissions on a file or folder, select its icon and choose 
File  ➪  Get Info (⌘  +I) and then change the settings in the Sharing & 
Permissions section at the bottom of the resulting Get Info window. I urge you 
not to change permission settings if you’re not absolutely sure of what you’re 
doing and why. And by all means think twice before deciding to apply changes 
to all the items in a folder or disk; change permissions on the contents of the 
wrong folder and you could end up with a mess.
»
» Group: In Unix systems, all users belong to one or more groups. The group 
that includes everyone who has an account with administrator permissions on 
your Mac is called Admin. Everyone in the Admin group has access to Shared 

290     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
and Public folders over the network, as well as to any folder that the Admin 
group has been granted access to by the folder’s owner.
For the purpose of assigning permissions, you can create your own groups 
the same way you create a user account: Open the Users & Groups System 
Preferences pane, click the little plus sign, choose Group from the New 
Account pop-up menu, type the name of the group, and then click the Create 
Group button.
The group appears in the list of users on the left, and eligible accounts appear 
with check boxes on the right, as shown in Figure 15-6.
»
» Everyone: This category is an easy way to set permissions for everyone with 
an account on your Mac at the same time. Unlike the Admin group, which 
includes only users with administrative permissions, this one includes, well, 
everyone (everyone with an account on this Mac, that is).
If you want people without an account on this Mac to have access to a file or 
folder, that file or folder needs to go in your Public folder, where the people 
you want to see it can log in as guests.
Sharing a folder
Suppose you have a folder you want to share, but it has slightly different rules 
than those set up for the Public folder, for the Drop Box folder in the Public folder, 
or for your personal folders. These rules are permissions, and they tell you how 
much access someone has to your stuff.
Actually, the rules governing Shared and Public folders are permissions, too, but 
they’re set up for you when macOS is installed.
FIGURE 15-6: 
This group, 
The Outsid-
ers, contains 
the Bobcat 
and Miss Kitty 
accounts.

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     291
I suggest that you share only those folders located in your Home folder (or a folder 
within it). Because of the way Unix works, the Unix permissions of the enclosing 
folder can prevent access to a folder for which you do have permissions. Trust me, 
if you share only the folders in your Home folder, you’ll never go wrong. If you 
don’t take this advice, you could wind up having folders that other users can’t 
access, even though you gave them the appropriate permissions.
By the way, you can set permissions for folders in your Public folder (like the Drop 
Box folder) that are different from those for the rest of the parent folder.
I said this before, but it bears repeating: Whenever I talk about sharing a folder,  
I also mean sharing disks — and disk partitions other than your startup disk (which 
you just can’t share, period). So don’t forget that anything I say about sharing a 
folder also applies to sharing any disk (or partition) other than your startup disk. 
Although you can’t explicitly share your startup disk, anyone with administrator 
access can mount it for sharing from across the network (or Internet).
To share a folder with another user, follow these steps:
1.	 Choose   ➪  System Preferences (or click the System Preferences icon on 
the dock).
The System Preferences window appears.
2.	 In the System Preferences window, click the Sharing icon.
The Sharing System Preferences pane appears.
3.	 Click File Sharing in the list of services on the left.
The lists of shared folders and their users appear on the right, as shown 
in Figure 15-7.
FIGURE 15-7: 
Changing the 
privileges of 
the Recipes 
folder for 
the group 
­Everyone.

292     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
4.	 Click the + (plus) button under the Shared Folders list or drag the folder 
from Finder onto the Shared Folders list to add the folder you want to 
share (Recipes in Figure 15-7).
If you select the Shared Folder check box in a folder’s Get Info window, that 
folder already appears in the list of Shared Folders, so you won’t have to 
bother with Step 4.
Alas, although selecting the Shared Folder check box in a folder’s Get Info 
window causes it to appear in the Sharing System Preferences pane’s Shared 
Folders list, you still have to complete the steps that follow to assign that 
folder’s users and privileges.
5.	 Click the + (plus) button under the Users column to add a user or group if 
the user or group you want isn’t already showing in the Users column.
6.	 Click the double-headed arrow to the right of a user or group name and 
change its privileges.
I’m changing the permission for Everyone from Read Only to Read & Write 
(refer to Figure 15-7). You can choose among three types of access (in addition 
to no access) for each user or group, as shown in Table 15-1. If you’re the 
folder’s owner (or have administrator access), you can click the padlock icon 
and change the owner or group or both for the file or folder.
Useful settings for permissions
The following sections show you some of the most common ways that you can 
combine permissions for a folder. You’ll probably find one option that fits the way 
you work and the people you want to share with.
TABLE 15-1	
Privileges
Permission
What It Allows
Read and write
A user with read and write access can see, add, delete, move, and edit files just as 
though they were stored on her own computer.
Read only
A read only user can see and use files that are stored in a Shared folder but can’t add, 
delete, move, or edit them.
Write only (Drop 
Box)
Users can add files to this folder but can’t see what’s in it. The user must have read 
access to the folder containing a write only folder.
No access
With no permissions, a user can neither see nor use your Shared folders or drives.

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     293
Owner permissions  — High Sierra 
Bob (single silhouette) in the example 
in Figure  15-8  — must be at least as 
expansive as Group permissions (double 
silhouette; Staff in Figure  15-8), and 
Group permissions must be at least as 
expansive as Everyone’s permissions 
(triple 
silhouette; 
Everyone 
in 
Figure  15-8). So to set the Everyone 
privilege to read and write, the Group 
and Owner privileges must also be set to read and write.
In the following examples, I show how to set permissions in the Sharing System 
Preferences pane. Another way to set permissions is by selecting an icon in Finder 
and choosing File  ➪  Get Info (⌘  +I) and then changing the settings in the Shar-
ing & Permissions section at the bottom of the resulting Get Info window. The 
two methods are pretty much interchangeable, so you can use whichever is more 
convenient:
»
» Allow everyone access: In Figure 15-8, I configure settings that allow 
everyone on a network to access the Bob’s Downloads folder. Everyone can 
open, read, and change the contents of this Shared folder. Do this by choosing 
Read & Write for Others from the pop-up menu to the right of the user’s name 
in the Sharing System Preferences pane or the folder’s Get Info window.
»
» Allow nobody but yourself 
access: The settings shown in 
Figure 15-9 reflect appropriate 
settings that allow owner-only 
access to the Bob’s Downloads 
folder. No one but me can see or 
use the contents of this folder. 
Members of the Staff group can 
drop files and folders into this

others to deposit files and folders without giving them access: A drop box”). 
Use the pop-up menus to choose Write Only (Drop Box) as the Staff privilege 
and No Access as the Everyone privilege.

however, only the owner can make 
changes to files in this folder.
»
» One more privilege: The Apply to Enclosed Items button (click the gear at the 
bottom of the Sharing and Permissions section of Get Info windows in Finder) 
does exactly what its name implies. This feature (which is available only in Get 
Info windows and doesn’t appear in the Sharing System Preferences pane) is a 
fast way to assign the same permissions to many subfolders at the same time. 
After you set permissions for the enclosing folder the way you like them, click 
this button to give these same permissions to all folders inside it.
Be careful — there is no Undo for this action.
What is true of Get Info windows is also true of their Inspector window variant. 
Show Inspector replaces Get Info on the File menu when the Option key is pressed 
(also Option+⌘  +I).
Unsharing a folder
To unshare a folder that you own, change the permissions for every user and 
group to No Access. When you do, nobody but you has access to that folder. If 
you’re not sure how to do this, see the “Sharing a folder” and “Useful settings for 
permissions” sections, earlier in this chapter.

Allow access for the Staff group and the folder’s 
owner.

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     295
Connecting to a Shared Disk or  
Folder on a Remote Mac
After you set up sharing and assign permissions, you can access folders remotely 
from another computer. (Just make sure first that you have the correct adminis-
trative permissions to it.)
File sharing must be activated on the Mac where the shared files/folders reside; 
it doesn’t have to be activated on the Mac that’s accessing the files/folders. When 
file sharing is turned off, you can still use that Mac to access a remote Shared 
folder on another machine as long as its owner has granted you enough permis-
sions and has file sharing enabled. If file sharing is turned off on your Mac, others 
won’t be able to access your folders, even if you’ve assigned permissions to them 
previously.
If you’re going to share files, and you leave your Mac on and unattended for a long 
time, logging out before you leave it is a very good idea. This prevents anyone who 
just walks up to your Mac from seeing your files, email, applications, or anything 
else that’s yours — unless you’ve given that person a user account that has per-
missions for your files. If you don’t want to log out, at least consider requiring 
that your password be entered when waking from sleep or dismissing the screen 
saver (General tab of Security & Privacy System Preferences).
Move along now and see how to access your Home folder from a remote Mac — a 
supercool feature that’s bound to get more popular as the Internet continues to 
mature.
The following steps assume that you have an account on the remote Mac, which 
means you have your own Home folder on that Mac.
To connect to a Shared folder on a Mac other than the one you’re currently on, 
follow these steps:
1.	 Make sure that you’re already set up as a user on the computer that you 
want to log in to (LisaMBP in Figure 15-12 ).
If you need to know how to create a new user, see the “Creating users” section, 
earlier in the chapter.
2.	 On the computer that you’re logging in from (my MacBook Air in this 
example), click the Show button to show the Shared section in the 
sidebar if it’s not already displayed.
The button says Hide in Figure 15-12 because the shared section is displayed.

296     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
All available shared servers appear. (Two are visible in the sidebar in Figure 15-12 —  
MacBook The Knife XIII and LisaMBP.)
Note that you might also see shared resources such as wireless printers (my 
Epson ET-4550 in the figure) or network storage devices (such as my Airport 
Time Capsule) in the Shared section of the sidebar.
3.	 Click the name of the remote Mac (LisaMBP) that you want to access in 
the sidebar.
At this point, you’re connected to the remote Mac as a guest, as shown in 
Figure 15-12.
4.	 Click the Connect As button.
The Connect dialog appears. The 
name of the person logged in 
and using this Mac automatically 
appears in the Name field 
(my account name, bobl, in 
Figure 15-13).
If that’s not your username on the 
Mac you’re trying to access, type 
the username in the Name field.
If you select the Remember This 
Password in My Keychain check 
box in the Connect dialog, macOS remembers your password for you the next 
time you connect to this server. Sweet!
FIGURE 15-12: 
I am connected 
to LisaMBP as 
a guest.
FIGURE 15-13: 
The Connect dialog needs my password.

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     297
5.	 Select the Guest radio button if you don’t have an account on the remote 
computer and then click Connect; if you’re logging in as a user, skip to 
Step 6.
Pressing ⌘  +G is the same as selecting the Guest radio button, and pressing 
⌘  +R is the same as selecting the Registered User radio button.
6.	 Type your password and click the Connect button.
After you connect as a registered user, you see your Home folder (bobl in 
Figure 15-14) and everyone else’s Public folders.
File sharing must be active on LisaMBP (the Mac I’m accessing remotely in the 
example). If file sharing weren’t active on LisaMBP, its name wouldn’t appear in 
the Shared section of the sidebar, and I wouldn’t be able to connect to it. But 
file sharing doesn’t have to be active on the computer you’re using (my 
MacBook Pro in this example) to give you access to the remote computer and 
make this trick work.
When you access your Home folder on a remote Mac as I did in this example, 
you see an icon with the short name of your Home folder on that Mac (bobl in 
Figure 15-15) on the desktop of the Mac you’re using (unless you’ve deselected 
Connected Servers in Finder’s General Preferences pane, under Show These 
Items on the Desktop).
FIGURE 15-14:

298     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
7.	 When you finish using the remote Mac, disconnect by using one of these 
methods:
•	 Drag the shared-volume icon (bobl in Figure 15-15) to the Eject icon on the 
dock.
•	 Right-click or Control-click the shared volume icon and choose Eject from 
the contextual menu that appears.
•	 Select the shared volume icon and choose File  ➪  Eject.
•	 Select the shared volume icon and press ⌘  +E.
•	 In a Finder window sidebar, click the little Eject symbol to the right of the 
remote computer’s name (LisaMBP in Figure 15-15).
When a disk or volume is selected (highlighted), the Trash icon turns into a 
little arrow, which represents eject. Nice touch, eh?
•	 If you’ve finished working for the day, and you don’t leave your Mac on 
24/7 (as most folks do), choose   ➪  Shut Down or Log Out. Shutting down 
or logging out automatically disconnects you from shared disks or folders. 
(Shut Down also turns off your Mac.)
Changing Your Password
You can change your password at any time. Changing your password is a good 
idea if you’re concerned about security — for example, if there’s a chance your 
password has been discovered by someone else.
FIGURE 15-15: 
Accessing my 
Home folder

remotely.

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     299
You can change the password for your account on your own Mac, or you can 
change the password you use to connect to your account on a remote Mac. I show 
you how to do both in the following sections.
Changing your account password  
on your Mac
To change the password on your own Mac, just follow these steps:
1.	Choose  ➪  System Preferences, or double-click its icon in your 
Applications folder and click the Users & Groups icon.
The Users & Groups System Preferences pane appears.
2.	In the list on the left, select your account.
Your account information appears in the area on the right.
3.	Click the Change Password button.
If you aren’t using your iCloud password, a dialog appears and asks:
Would you like to change the password for “High Sierra Bob,” or begin 
using your iCloud password to log in and unlock this Mac? You will only 
need to remember one password if you use your iCloud password to log 
in to this Mac.
Your choices are Use iCloud Password, Cancel, or Change Password.
4.	Click Change Password.
A sheet drops down.
5.	In the Old Password field, type your current password.
This demonstrates that you are who you’re supposed to be, not someone who 
just walked up to your unattended Mac.
6.	In the New Password field, type your new password.
7.	In the Verify field, retype your new password.
8.	(Optional but recommended) In the Password Hint field, type a hint.
9.	Click the Change Password button.
Assuming that you entered your old password correctly, the sheet disappears.
10.	Close the System Preferences window.

300     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
Changing the password of any account 
but your own on your Mac
To change a password on your own Mac, just follow these steps:
1.	 Choose  ➪  System Preferences or double-click its icon in your 
Applications folder and click the Users & Groups icon.
The Users & Groups System Preferences pane appears.
You may have to click the lock (at bottom left), supply an administrator name 
and password in the resulting dialog, and then click OK before you can 
proceed.
2.	 In the list on the left, select the account for which you want to change 
the password.
The account information appears in the area on the right.
3.	 Click the Reset Password button.
A sheet drops down.
4.	 In the New Password field, type the new password.
5.	 In the Verify field, retype the new password.
6.	 (Optional but recommended) In the Password Hint field, type a hint.
7.	 Click the Reset Password button.
8.	 Close the System Preferences window.
Changing the password for your account 
on someone else’s Mac
When you log in to a remote Mac, you can change your own password if you like. 
Follow these steps to do so:
1.	 Log in to the remote computer on which you want to change your 
password.
See the “Connecting to a Shared Disk or Folder on a Remote Mac” section, 
earlier in this chapter, if you don’t know how to log in to a remote computer.
The Connect dialog appears.
2.	 In the Connect dialog, type your username, if it’s not already there.
3.	 Click the Change Password button in the bottom-left corner of the dialog.
A sheet for changing your password appears.

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     301
4.	 In the Old Password field, type your current password.
5.	 In the New Password and Verify fields, type your new password.
You can use the Password Assistant (the little key to the right of the New 
Password text box) to help you generate a secure password.
6.	 Click the Change Password button.
Your password is changed, and you return to the Connect dialog.
7.	 (Optional) Type your new password and click Connect to log in to the 
other Mac.
You can skip this step by clicking the Cancel button in the Connect dialog if you 
don’t need to use anything on the remote Mac at this time. Your password is 
still changed, and you need to use the new password the next time you log in 
to this Mac.
8.	 Select the Add Password to Keychain check box in the Connect dialog to 
store your passwords in a single place on the Mac.
This way, you don’t have to retype them each time you access a Mac or other 
remote resource. (Read more about the Keychain in Chapter 22.)
More Types of Sharing
Several more types of sharing exist, and I’d like to at least mention a few in pass-
ing. All are found in (where else?) the Sharing System Preferences pane, which 
you can find by launching the System Preferences application (from the Applica-
tions folder,  menu, or dock) and clicking the Sharing icon.
Sharing a screen
Here’s the sharing that I consider the coolest. Screen Sharing lets you control 
another Mac on your network from your Mac. In essence, you see the other Mac’s 
screen on your Mac — and control it using your mouse and keyboard.
To set up Screen Sharing on the Mac you want to control remotely, follow these 
steps:
1.	 Open the Sharing System Preferences pane by launching the System 
Preferences application (from the Applications folder, the  menu, 
Launchpad, or the dock) and clicking the Sharing icon.
2.	 In the list of services on the left, select the check box for Screen Sharing.

302     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
3.	 Select either the All Users or Only These Users radio button.
4.	 If you opt for Only These Users, click the + (plus sign) button and add the 
user or users you want to allow to control this Mac remotely.
Note that the Staff group is included by default.
To take control of your Mac from another Mac, follow these steps:
1.	 If the Shared section of the sidebar isn’t displayed, click the now-you-see- 
it-now-you-don’t Show tag to the right of Shared.
All available servers appear.
2.	 Click the name of the remote Mac you want to control.
3.	 Click the Share Screen button.
Depending on whether you selected the All Users or Only These Users radio 
button, you may have to enter your name and password, and then click the 
Connect button.
A window with the name of the remote Mac in its title bar appears. In it, you 
see the screen of the Mac you’re looking to control remotely.
4.	 Go ahead and click something.
Pull down a menu or open a folder. Isn’t that cool? You’re controlling a Mac 
across the room or in another room with your mouse and keyboard!
Sharing the Internet
If your Mac has an Internet connection and another Mac nearby doesn’t, you can 
enable Internet Sharing, and the other Mac can share your Internet connection. 
The following steps show you how:
1.	 Open the Sharing System Preferences pane by launching the System 
Preferences application (from the Applications folder, the  menu, 
Launchpad, or the dock) and clicking the Sharing icon.
2.	 In the list of services on the left, select the Internet Sharing check box.
3.	 In the Share Your Connection From pop-up menu, choose the connection 
you want to share.
Your choices are Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, FireWire, Ethernet, or Thunderbolt.

CHAPTER 15  Sharing Your Mac and Liking It     303
4.	 Select the check boxes next to connections other computers will use: 
Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or Built-In FireWire.
Figure 15-16 shows Internet Sharing configured to share my Ethernet Internet 
connection with other Macs and iDevices over Wi-Fi.
5.	 (Optional) Click the Wi-Fi Options button to name, select a wireless 
channel for, enable encryption for, and/or set a password for your shared 
network.
That’s all there is to it.
And yet more ways to share
A few more cool ways to share your Mac follow:
»
» DVD or CD Sharing: When you select this option, remote users can access 
CDs and DVDs in your Mac’s optical drive(s). You can select to have High Sierra 
notify you and request permission when a remote user makes such a request. 
This feature is especially handy if you have two or more Macs, and one doesn’t 
have an optical drive.
»
» Printer Sharing: If you turn on Printer Sharing in the Sharing System 
Preferences pane, other people on your LAN can use any printer connected to 
your computer.

304     PART 4  Getting Along with Others
»
» Scanner Sharing: Analogous to Printer Sharing, Scanner Sharing allows 
others on your local network to use scanners connected to your Mac.
»
» Bluetooth Sharing: If you have a Bluetooth mobile phone or PDA and your 
Mac has Bluetooth, you can configure many of the default behaviors for 
transferring files to and from your Mac. A picture is worth a thousand words, 
so Figure 15-17 shows all the things Bluetooth Sharing lets you configure.

CHAPTER 16  The Musical Mac     307
The Musical Mac
A 
long time ago, before the iPod and the iTunes Store were even born, 
iTunes was a program that stored, managed, and played your MP3 music 
files. Over the ensuing years, it has grown into much more. In fact, many 
(including yours truly) feel it has grown into a bloated monstrosity barely resem-
bling the iTunes we knew and loved.
In High Sierra, iTunes continues to manage much more than music. And if you use 
devices such as an iPod, Apple TV, iPad, or iPhone, iTunes is also the application 
you use to manage (sync) your music, as well as videos, TV shows, podcasts, iOS 
apps, and more.
In other words, the anachronistically named iTunes is what you use to manage 
audio, video, and iOS app files on your hard drive. If you have an iDevice or Apple 
TV, it’s what you use to sync files. Oh yeah, and it’s still a music player.
Entire books have been dedicated to iTunes. (I once wrote one called The Little 
iTunes Book, which is now out of print.) The best I can do in this chapter is show 
you the handful of things you really need to know.
Before you can look at iTunes, you need to know a few things about the new Apple 
Music and not-so-new iTunes Match subscription services, because what you’ll 
see in iTunes is different for those who subscribe to one or both.

Apple Music and iTunes Match Rock!
iTunes Match and Apple Music are a pair of subscription music services offered 
by Apple.
iTunes Match is the older of the two, designed to let you store all your music in 
iCloud so you can stream songs to any Mac, PC, or iDevice. iTunes Match performs 
its magic by first determining which songs in your iTunes library are already avail-
able in the iTunes iCloud library. Because Apple’s vast iCloud repository contains 
tens of millions of songs, chances are that most of your music is already there. 
Then iTunes proceeds to upload a copy of every song it can’t match (which is much 
faster than uploading your entire Music library). The result is that you can stream 
any song in your iTunes library on any of your Macs, PCs, or iDevices, regardless 
of whether the song file has been downloaded to the device. As a bonus, all the 
music iTunes matches plays back from iCloud at 256Kbps AAC DRM-free quality 
even if your original copy was lower quality. (You can even download higher-
quality versions of those songs to replace your lower bit-rate copies.)
Subscribers can store up to 100,000 songs in iCloud, and songs you purchased 
from the iTunes Store don’t count. Only tracks or albums you specify are stored 
locally on your devices, saving tons of precious storage space.
At just $24.99 a year, iTunes Match is a bargain. But Apple Music, introduced in 
early 2015, may be a better (albeit more expensive) option. For $9.99 a month (or 
$14.99 a month for you and up to five family members), an Apple Music subscrip-
tion provides instant access to more than 30 million songs on all your devices. 
Whatever you want to hear is usually just a few clicks away. And because you’re 
running macOS High Sierra, you can ask Siri to play whatever you want to hear on 
your Mac, as well as on your iPhone and other iDevices.
It would behoove you to make a complete backup of your iTunes library before 
enabling either iTunes Match or Apple Music, just in case. There were reports 
early in their existence that enabling one or both scrambled the data in some 
users’ iTunes libraries.
Both subscription services require Internet access (of course), but as long as 
you’re connected you can have your entire Music library (iTunes Match) or access 
to a library of over 30 million songs (Apple Music) on your Mac, iPhone, or other 
device. You’ll never have to worry about filling up your device’s storage space with 
your music.

CHAPTER 16  The Musical Mac     309
And here’s a tip for subscribers to either service (one I learned the hard way): 
Before you travel on a plane or ship, remember to tap the iCloud download but-
ton next to any songs, albums, and playlists you want to listen to when Internet 
access isn’t available.
You’re entirely welcome.
Introducing iTunes
iTunes is the Swiss Army knife of multimedia software. After all, what other pro-
gram lets you play audio CDs; create (burn) your own audio or MP3 CDs; listen to 
MP3, AIFF, AAC, WAV, Audible.com, and several other types of audio files; view 
album cover art; enjoy pretty visual displays in time to the music; view and man-
age TV shows, movies, and other video files; manage media for iPods (or other 
MP3 players), Apple TVs, iPads, and iPhones; and listen to iTunes radio or Apple 
Music? And (deep breath) on top of all that, it’s your interface to the iTunes Store, 
the world’s leading (legitimate) source of downloadable music and video content. 
(Whew!)
To open iTunes, click its icon on the dock or double-click its icon in the Applica-
tions folder. If this is your first time opening iTunes, a Welcome screen appears, 
offering a quick tour (also available from the iTunes Help menu) and letting you 
share details about your library if you want. After you click Agree or No Thanks, 
the main iTunes window appears, as shown in Figure 16-1. The important items 
are labeled, but I encourage you to click anything and everything you see on the 
screen — you won’t break anything.
Perhaps the most important thing on the screen is the Category drop-down menu 
near the upper-left corner —Music, Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, and so on in 
Figure 16-1 — which acts as a filter for the various types of media in your iTunes 
Media library.
To the right of the Category drop-down menu are tabs for the selected category 
(Music in Figure 16-1): Library, For You, Browse, Radio, and Store. Click a tab to 
see its contents. To play a song (or other media such as a movie, TV show, or pod-
cast) in any tab, double-click it or single-click (to select it) and then press Return 
or the spacebar.
The spacebar is the Play/Pause shortcut for all media in iTunes.

310     PART 5  Getting Creative
Things work pretty much the same for the other categories. Double-click a movie, 
TV show, podcast, or whatever to watch or listen to it; use the Fast Forward/Play 
Next, Play/Pause, and Rewind/Play Previous controls to manage playback.
I’d like you to take note of a few other interface items before we move on to doing 
stuff in iTunes:
»
» You can use the more manageable MiniPlayer (on the left in Figure 16-2) by 
clicking the MiniPlayer button (labeled in Figure 16-1), choosing 
Window  ➪  MiniPlayer, or pressing ⌘  +Option+M.
The main window remains onscreen along with the MiniPlayer. You can close 
the window if you like and leave only the MiniPlayer onscreen, or keep ’em 
both on your screen if you prefer.
To close the MiniPlayer, click the little x in its upper-left corner.
Finally, you can toggle between the main window and the MiniPlayer by 
choosing Window  ➪  Switch To/From MiniPlayer, or use the shortcut 
⌘  +Shift+M.
FIGURE 16-1: 
Dissecting 
the iTunes 
interface.

CHAPTER 16  The Musical Mac     311
Although the MiniPlayer works in any category, it’s most useful for listening to 
audio — music, podcasts, and audiobooks.
»
» iTunes offers a ten-band graphic equalizer that can make your music (or 
video) sound significantly better. Just choose Window  ➪  Equalizer or use the 
shortcut ⌘  +Option+E to invoke it onscreen. You can see the equalizer on the 
right in Figure 16-2.
»
» Don’t miss iTunes Visualizer, which offers a groovy light show that dances in 
time to the music (see Figure 16-3). You turn it on by choosing View  ➪  Show 
Visualizer or pressing ⌘  +T. If you like the default Visualizer, also check out 
Classic iTunes Visualizer, which you’ll find in the Visualizer submenu. Search 
the web for iTunes Visualizer to find even more.
When you get sick of Visualizer (as you surely will), just choose View  ➪  Hide 
Visualizer or press ⌘  +T again to make it disappear.
Try this: Choose View  ➪  Full Screen or press ⌘  +Control+F while Visualizer is 
running, and it takes over your entire screen. Click anywhere on the screen to 
bring the iTunes window back.

Working with Media
iTunes is, first and foremost, a media manager and player, so the next thing  
I examine is how to get your favorite media into iTunes. Of course, you can acquire 
media a number of ways, depending on the type of media and where the files 
reside. For example, you can add song or video files that you download from web-
sites or receive as enclosures in email messages. Or you can add songs by ripping 
audio CDs. You can buy music, movies, TV shows, and audiobooks at the iTunes 
Store (and, to be fair, from many other online vendors, including www.amazon.com  
and www.audible.com). You can subscribe to free podcasts at the iTunes Store 
(and from most podcasts’ websites as well). You can buy apps for your iDevices, 
and you can listen to all sorts of music on the Internet radio stations included with 
iTunes. Finally, Apple Music subscribers can listen to pretty much any song they 
can think of.
To use the iTunes Store, Internet radio, or Apple Music, you must be connected to 
the Internet.
In the following sections, you discover the various ways to add media — songs, 
movies, videos, and podcasts — to your iTunes library, followed by a quick course 
in listening to iTunes Internet radio stations.
Adding songs
You can add songs from pretty much any source, and how you add a song to 
iTunes depends on where that song comes from. Here are the most common ways 
people add their songs:
»
» Add a song file (such as an MP3 or AAC file) from your hard drive. Drag 
the document into the iTunes window, as shown in Figure 16-4, drag the 
document onto the iTunes dock icon, or choose File  ➪  Add to Library (⌘  +O) 
and choose the file in the Open File dialog. In all three cases, the file is added 
to your iTunes Music library.
»
» Add songs from a store-bought or homemade audio CD. Insert the CD, and 
iTunes will launch itself and offer a dialog asking whether you want to import 
the CD into your iTunes library. Click the Yes button, and the songs on that CD 
are added to your iTunes Music library. If you don’t see a dialog when you 
insert an audio CD, you can import the songs on that CD, anyway. Just select 
the CD by clicking the CD button that appears to the right of the Apps category 
button when a CD is mounted and then clicking the Import CD button right 
below the search field.

CHAPTER 16  The Musical Mac     313
If your computer is connected to the Internet, iTunes magically looks up the 
song title, artist name, album name, song length, and genre for every song on 
the CD. Note that this works only for store-bought CDs containing somewhat 
popular music — and that iTunes might not be able to find information about 
an obscure CD by an even more obscure band, even if the disc is store-
bought. And in most cases it can’t look up information for homemade 
(home-burned) audio CDs. Finally, it sometimes gets things wrong.

» Buy your songs from the iTunes Store. Click the iTunes Store tab to visit the 
iTunes Store. From the home page, you can either click a link or type the song 
title, album title, artist name, keyword, or phrase in the search field, and then 
press Return to start the search. When you find an item that interests you, 
you can double-click any song to listen to a 30-second preview (or the entire 
song if you’re an Apple Music subscriber) or click the Buy Song or Buy Album 
button to purchase the song or album, as shown in Figure 16-5.
»
» Buy your songs from other online vendors, such as Amazon. Amazon 
(www.amazon.com) has a huge downloadable music store on the web. Its MP3 
Downloads section has more than a million songs, with more added every 
day. The prices at Amazon are often lower than the prices for the same music 
at the iTunes Store.
The first time you make a purchase from the iTunes Store, you have to create an 
Apple account, if you don’t already have one. To do so, just click the Account but-
ton, and then click the Create New Account button in the Sign In dialog. After your 
account is established, future purchases require just one or two clicks.

Adding movies and TV shows
To add a video file (such as MOV or MP4) from your hard drive, drag the file to 
the iTunes window (refer to Figure 16-4), drag the file to the iTunes dock icon, or 
choose File  ➪  Add to Library (⌘  +O) and choose the file in the Open File dialog. In 
all cases, the file is added to your iTunes Movie library.
You can also buy movies, TV shows, and other video content from the iTunes 
Store. Shopping for video is almost the same as shopping for music. Here are the 
steps:
1.	 Select Movie or TV from the Category drop-down menu and then click the 
iTunes Store tab.
2.	 Either click a link on the content pane or type in the search field.
You can search for a movie title, a music video name, an actor or direc-
tor name, or another keyword or phrase; then press Return to start the  
search.

CHAPTER 16  The Musical Mac     315
3.	 When you find a video item that interests you, double-click it to see a 
preview or click the Buy button to purchase the episode or video.
Speaking of movies, don’t forget to check out the picture-in-picture option, 
introduced in macOS Sierra. It works with most video content stored in iTunes, 
as well as videos on many websites. Just look for the little picture-in-picture 
icon (shown in the margin) at the bottom of the video player and click it to 
make your video float above all other pictures, as shown in Figure 16-6.
If you don’t see a picture-in-picture icon on a video player, try right- or Control-
clicking the video. If it supports picture-in-picture, you’ll see it in the pop-up 
menu.
Adding podcasts
Podcasts are like radio or television shows, except when you subscribe to them, 
you can listen to or watch them (using iTunes or your iPod, iPad, or iPhone) at any 
time you like. Thousands of podcasts are available and many (or most) are free. To 
find podcasts, follow these steps:
1.	 Select Podcasts from the Category drop-down menu.
Select Edit Menu if Podcasts doesn’t appear in the menu.
2.	 Click the iTunes Store tab.
3.	 Click a link in the content pane or type a keyword or phrase in the 
search field.

4.	 When you find a podcast that appeals to you, do one of the following:
•	 Double-click it to listen to a preview.
•	 Click the Get button to download the current episode of that podcast.
•	 Click the Subscribe button to receive all future episodes of that podcast 
automatically.
Figure 16-7 shows all these things for the Mac Geek Gab audio podcast from 
The Mac Observer.
For more information on most podcasts, just click the little i button on the right 
side of the description field, as shown in Figure 16-7.
Subscribing to a podcast is a cool deal. You can configure how often iTunes checks 
for new episodes (hourly, daily, weekly, or manually) and what to do when new 
episodes become available (download the most recent one, download all episodes, 
or do nothing) and how many episodes to keep in your iTunes library (all, all 
unplayed, or a specific number between 2 and 10). To specify these settings, click 
a podcast you’ve subscribed to on the Library or Unplayed tab, click the little gear 
icon, and choose Podcast Settings from the shortcut menu.
When you start listening to a subscribed podcast on your Mac in iTunes and switch 
to an iDevice, the podcast will pick up where it left off on your Mac. Or at least 
that’s what’s supposed to happen — and it usually does.

Learning from iTunes U
Want to learn something for free? Select iTunes U in the Category drop-down 
menu (if you don’t see it, select Edit Menu and enable its check box). Click the 
iTunes Store tab and choose from tens of thousands of free audio and video 
courses, including a good number produced by hundreds of colleges and universi-
ties, including Harvard, Oxford, and Stanford.
You download or subscribe to a course the same way you download or subscribe to 
a podcast. Check it out the next time you’re in the iTunes Store. It’s a great way to 
learn something new for free.
Listening to iTunes Radio
Streaming audio is delivered over the Internet in real time. Think of streaming 
audio as being just like radio but using the Internet rather than the airwaves as 
its delivery medium.
To listen to iTunes Radio, with dozens of stations curated by Apple’s music 
experts, select Music in the Category drop-down menu and then click the Radio 
tab. The first thing you see, at the top of the screen, are three links: Featured, 
Beats 1, and Stations. Beats 1 is the live radio station from Apple, which is on the 
air worldwide 24 hours a day, 7 days a week offering world-class programming, 
interviews, and music. To listen to Beats 1, click the Beats 1 link near the top of the 
window and then click Play.
If Beats 1 isn’t your cup of tea, click the Stations link to see additional radio sta-
tions organized as follows:
»
» Recently Played: These are stations that — you guessed it — you’ve played 
recently. Tap one to listen to it now.
»
» Featured Stations: This handful of stations was handpicked for your 
enjoyment by the nice folks at Apple. Tap one to listen to it.
»
» Genres: These stations are organized by genre, with stations as subgenres. 
Tap a subgenre to listen to it.
iTunes also offers more than 100 Internet radio stations that aren’t curated by 
Apple. To see and listen to these stations, select Internet Radio from the Catego-
ries drop-down menu. (If Internet Radio doesn’t appear in the Category drop-
down menu, select Edit Menu and enable its check box.)
And that, friends, is pretty much all you need to know to use and enjoy radio sta-
tions in iTunes.

All about Playlists
Playlists are a big deal in iTunes; they let you manage otherwise unmanageable 
amounts of media, such as the nearly 20,000 songs in my iTunes library. Playlists 
let you create subsets of a large collection, so it’s easier to enjoy exactly the kind 
of music you want in iTunes or on your iDevices.
To play with your playlists, click the Music icon near the top left and then click the 
Playlists tab near the top center.
iTunes offers two types of playlists:
»
» Regular playlists, which contain the songs (or videos, podcasts, or radio 
stations) that you specify by dragging them to the playlist.
»
» Smart playlists, which select songs from your library based on criteria you 
specify. Furthermore, smart playlists are updated automatically if you add 
new items to your library that meet the criteria.
All playlists appear in the sidebar on the left side of the iTunes window.
If you’re an Apple Music subscriber, you can use songs from your personal iTunes 
library, as well as the more than 30 million songs available to Apple Music sub-
scribers in your playlists.
Creating a regular playlist
To create a regular playlist, follow these steps:
1.	 Select Music from the Category drop-down menu.
If you have existing playlists, they appear in the sidebar, as shown in  
Figure 16-8.
2.	 Choose File  ➪  New  ➪  Playlist, or press ⌘  +N.
A new playlist named Playlist appears in the sidebar.
3.	 (Optional) The playlist’s name, Playlist, is selected and ready to be edited, 
so you might want to rename it something meaningful by typing a new 
name for it.
I typed “A Shiny New Playlist!” in Figure 16-8.
If you decide not to name it your playlist now, you can double-click it and type a 
new name anytime.

CHAPTER 16  The Musical Mac     319
4.	 To add a song or songs to a playlist:
a.	 Click the Edit Playlist button. A list of all your songs appears on the left.
b.	 Drag the song or songs to the playlist on the right. The faint blue line shown on 
the playlist (see Figure 16-8) indicates where the song or songs will appear 
when you release the mouse button.
The song is added to that playlist. Note that adding a song to a playlist doesn’t 
remove it from the library. And if you delete a song from a playlist, the song 
isn’t deleted from your library. And if you delete a playlist from the sidebar, the 
songs it contains aren’t deleted from your library. In other words, think of 
songs in playlists as being aliases of songs in your library.
5.	 When you’ve finished adding songs, click the Done button.
6.	 To listen to the songs in a playlist, click it in the sidebar to select it, 
and then click Play.
If you don’t want to drag songs to your playlist one by one, there’s an easy way 
to do it in one fell swoop. First, ⌘  -click all the songs you want to include in the 
playlist. Then choose File  ➪  New  ➪  Playlist from Selection or use the keyboard 
shortcut, ⌘  +Shift+N.
You can also use the ⌘  -click technique to select and then drag a batch of songs 
onto an existing playlist.
The three columns above the list of songs in Figure 16-8 (27 Genres, 1,439 Artists, 
and 2,860 Albums) are Column Browser, which is hidden by default in High Sierra. 
If you’re not seeing Column Browser but would like to, choose View  ➪  Column 
Browser  ➪  Show Column Browser or use the shortcut ⌘  +B. The Column Browser 
FIGURE 16-8: 
Adding songs

as dragging 
them onto the 
playlist.

320     PART 5  Getting Creative
menu item also allows you to choose the columns that appear; the shortcut, alas, 
merely shows or hides Column Browser.
Working with smart playlists
To create a smart playlist that builds a list based on criteria and updates itself auto-
matically, follow these steps:
1.	 Select Music from the Category drop-down menu.
If you have existing playlists, they appear in the sidebar, as shown in  
Figure 16-9.
2.	 Choose File  ➪  New Smart Playlist (⌘  +Option+N).
The Smart Playlist dialog appears, as shown in Figure 16-9.
3.	 Use the pop-up menus to select the criteria that will build your smart 
playlist and click the + button(s) (far right) to add more criteria.
4.	 Click OK when you’re done.
The playlist appears alongside your other playlists in the sidebar. You can tell 
it’s a smart playlist by the gear on its icon. To modify the criteria of a smart 
playlist after it’s been created, right-click (or Control-click) the smart playlist and 
choose Edit Smart Playlist to reopen the dialog.
I use smart playlists for many things. I have one that gathers Beatles songs and 
songs by individual Beatles; another for songs in my library that have never been 
played; and one that gathers all Doctor Mac & His All GarageBand Band’s hits in 
one playlist. Try ’em — you’ll like ’em.
FIGURE 16-9: 
Specify the 
criteria for 
your smart 
playlist.

CHAPTER 16  The Musical Mac     321
Burning a playlist to CD
Another use for playlists is for burning audio CDs you can listen to on almost any 
audio CD player. The only trick is to make sure the total playing time of the songs 
in the playlist is less than the capacity of the blank CD you’re using, which is usu-
ally 74 to 80 minutes. Don’t forget to account for the gap between tracks, which 
is two seconds by default. When you have all the songs you want on your CD on 
the playlist, choose File  ➪  Burn Playlist to Disc. The Burn Settings dialog appears.
Note that although the default type of disc iTunes burns is an audio CD, it can also 
burn two other types — MP3 CDs or data CDs (and DVDs):
»
» MP3 CD is a special format that can be played in many CD audio players and 
set-top DVD players. The cool thing about an MP3 CD is that rather than 
holding a mere 74 to 80 minutes of music, it can hold more than 100 songs! 
The uncool thing about MP3 CDs is that many older audio CD players won’t 
play them.
»
» A data CD or DVD is nothing more than a disc formatted to be read and 
mounted by any computer, Mac or Windows.
If you click the Burn button now, you’ll get an audio CD. To burn an MP3 CD or 
Data CD or DVD, select the appropriate radio button in the Burn Settings dialog.
When you’re satisfied, click the Burn button. In a few minutes, you’ll have an 
audio CD that contains all the songs on the playlist — and plays the songs in the 
order in which they appeared on the playlist (unless, of course, you elected to burn 
a data CD or DVD).
Looking at the Genius playlist
I’d like to draw your attention to one more playlist: Genius.
Who is Genius?
Genius is actually more of a “what”: an iTunes feature that lets you find new 
music — in your iTunes library or the iTunes Store — that’s related to a song of 
your choosing. Or, as the Genius splash screen you see when you turn on Genius 
puts it: “Genius makes playlists and mixes from songs in your library that go 
great together. And the Genius selects music from the iTunes Store that you don’t 
already have.” To get started, choose Account  ➪  Turn On Genius, if you haven’t 
done so already. When you finish reading, the Genius splash screen appears; click 
the Turn On Genius button in the bottom-right corner.

322     PART 5  Getting Creative
If you’re concerned about your privacy, you should know that turning on Genius 
sends information about your iTunes library to Apple. There’s a Learn More but-
ton on the What Is Genius screen if you want to (d’oh!) learn more about it.
To use Genius, you must (for some unknown reason) have an iTunes Store account, 
even though the information Genius sends to Apple about your iTunes library is 
stored anonymously. No purchase is required, but I still think it’s a dumb require-
ment. However, that’s the way it works, so take it or leave it.
Assuming you take it, sign in to your iTunes Store account if you have one (or cre-
ate one if you don’t). After agreeing to the Genius terms of service, Genius gathers 
info about your iTunes library, sends the info to Apple, and then (finally) delivers 
your results. When all of this is done, you can create Genius playlists and peruse 
Genius suggestions.
How? Glad you asked! Select at least one song (or a bunch of songs) in your library 
or a playlist and then choose File  ➪  New  ➪  Create Genius Playlist. After a bit 
of cogitation, iTunes presents you with a Genius playlist based on the song you 
clicked, as shown in Figure 16-10.
Or try a Genius shuffle, which is an instant Genius playlist without the playlist. 
Select a song and then choose Controls  ➪  Genius Shuffle (or press Option+spacebar) 
and a selection of songs that go great together will play. To see the songs selected 
by Genius, just click the Up Next button in the toolbar (and shown in the margin).
FIGURE 16-10: 
Genius 
suggests 
songs that go 
nicely with 
the song the 
suggestions 
are based on.

CHAPTER 16  The Musical Mac     323
Finally, try Genius suggestions to discover songs you might enjoy based on a song 
you select. To see your options, click the ellipses (. . .) next to any song and choose 
Genius Suggestions, as shown in Figure 16-10.
By the way, if you’re not a fan of Led Zeppelin and classic British rock, let me 
assure you that most of the songs in the Thank You (live: BBC Sessions) Genius 
playlist and Genius suggestions in Figure 16-10 do, mostly, “go great together.”
That being said, the tech editor of previous editions of this book, the late Dennis 
R. Cohen, said Genius was not so hot with classical music or comedy. And I’ve 
noticed that it works better with big names than lesser-known indie artists.
Even so, it’s free. So if you don’t have issues with all the legal mumbo jumbo, the 
iTunes Store account, or sending information about your iTunes library to Apple, 
give Genius a try.
One last thing: If you’re new to iTunes, may I suggest exploring the excellent 
iTunes Quick Tour, which you’ll find in the Help menu along with other excellent 
Help resources.


CHAPTER 17  The Multimedia Mac     325
The Multimedia Mac
M
edia content is more than just music (the topic of Chapter 16), and your 
Mac is ready, willing, and able to handle almost any type of media (with 
any type of content) you can throw at it. Which is why, in addition to the 
aforementioned iTunes, macOS High Sierra includes applications for viewing and 
working with media (such as DVD movie discs and QuickTime movie files) as well 
as graphics in a variety of file formats (including PDF, TIFF, and JPEG).
In this chapter, you look at some bundled applications you can use to work with 
such media — namely QuickTime Player, iBooks, Photo Booth, and Preview — 
followed by a brief section about importing your own media (photos and videos) 
into your Mac and the Image Capture app.
Playing Movies and Music  
in QuickTime Player
QuickTime is Apple’s technology for digital media creation, delivery, and playback. 
It’s used in a myriad of ways by programs such as Apple’s iMovie, by websites such 
as YouTube (www.youtube.com), and in training videos delivered on CD or DVD.

QuickTime Player is the macOS application that lets you view QuickTime movies 
as well as streaming audio and video, QuickTime VR (Virtual Reality), and many 
types of audio files as well. The quickest way to launch it is by double-clicking its 
icon in the Applications folder. It is also the default application for most Quick-
Time movie document files.
I say most QuickTime movies because some will open QuickTime Player, and oth-
ers will open iTunes. To change the app that opens for a particular movie, right- 
or Control-click its icon in Finder and choose the application you prefer from the 
Open With submenu. However, this action opens the file with that program only 
this one time. To make the change permanent, press Option, and the Open With 
command becomes the Always Open With command.
To play a QuickTime movie, merely double-click its icon, and QuickTime Player 
(or iTunes) launches itself.
Using QuickTime Player couldn’t be easier. All its important controls are available 
right in the player window, as shown in Figure 17-1.
Here are a few more QuickTime Player features you might find useful:
»
» The Movie Inspector window (Window  ➪  Show/Hide Movie Inspector or 
⌘  +I) provides a lot of useful information about the current movie, such as its 
location on your hard drive and the file format, frames per second, file size, 
and duration.
»
» The Trim control (Edit  ➪  Trim or ⌘  +T) lets you delete frames from the 
beginning and end of a movie.
»
» The Share Menu lets you send your movies to others via the Mail or 
Messages apps or via AirDrop, or upload them to YouTube, Vimeo, Flickr, 
Facebook, and other similar sites.

See Chapter 20 for details about High Sierra’s cool AirPlay Mirroring option, which

iBooks on the Mac
Don’t be surprised if you have to answer this question from an inquisitive child 
someday: “Is it true, Grandpa, that people once read books on paper?”
Don’t get me wrong; I still love physical books as much as anyone and think they’ll 
be around a lot longer than you or I. But I also recognize the real-world benefits 
that e-books have over paper ones including (but not limited to) the following:
»
» Lose some weight. When you travel, you can cart around a bunch of e-books 
on your MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, iPad, or iPhone without breaking your 
back. To the avid bookworm, this potentially changes the dynamic in the way 
you read. Because you can carry so many books wherever you go, you can 
read whatever type of book strikes your fancy at the moment, kind of like 
listening to a song that fits your current mood. You have no obligation to read 
a book from start to finish before opening a new bestseller just because that 
happens to be the one book in your bag. In other words, weight constraints 
are out the window.
»
» Feel like reading a trashy novel? Go for it. Rather immerse yourself in classic 
literature? Go for that. You might read a textbook, cookbook, or biography. Or 
gaze in wonder at an illustrated beauty. What’s more, you can switch among 
the various titles and styles of books at will before finishing any single title.
»
» Enjoy flexible fonts and type sizes. With e-books — or as Apple calls ’em, 
iBooks — you can change the text size and fonts on the fly, which is quite 
useful for people with less than 20/20 vision.
»
» Get the meaning of a word on the spot. No more searching for a physical 
dictionary. You can look up an unfamiliar word on the spot.
»
» Search with ease. Need to do research on a particular subject? Enter a 
search term to find each and every mention of the subject in the book you’re 
reading.
»
» Read in the dark. Your Mac has a high-resolution backlit display so that you 
can read without a lamp nearby, which is useful in bed when your partner is 
trying to sleep.

328     PART 5  Getting Creative
»
» See all the artwork in color. Indeed, you’re making no visual sacrifices 
anymore, unlike in early releases of iBooks, because this one lets you 
experience (within certain limits of your hardware) stunning artwork that was 
once the exclusive province of big, expensive coffee-table books. (It’s also 
awesome for reading colorful children’s books and comics.)
Everything that follows will make more sense if you have at least one iBook in 
your library. So the first thing to do is stock your virtual library with an iBook from 
the app’s built-in iBooks Store. Don’t worry. This won’t cost you a penny unless 
you want it to — the store is chock-full of free books! (For more on creating an 
Apple account, turn to Chapter 16.)
So without further ado, here’s how to acquire some iBooks.
Buying iBooks
First things first. The iBooks app needs to be running, so launch it by one of these 
routes:
»
» Single-click its dock icon.
»
» Double-click its icon in the Applications folder.
»
» Single-click its icon in Launchpad.
If this is your first time launching iBooks, click the Get Started button.
The iCloud for Books screen, which is a new option in High Sierra, lets you store 
your entire iBooks library in iCloud if you like. Click Use iCloud or Not Now.
Next, click the iBooks Store button in the upper-left corner of the iBooks window, 
which is the Library button in Figure 17-2 (because I already clicked it).
If you’ve purchased iBooks with iTunes, they should appear automatically in your 
iBooks library. If you don’t see them in iBooks, choose File  ➪  Move Books from 
iTunes, and wait a minute or two.
You can look for iBooks in many ways. At the top of the iBooks window are five 
tabs that represent different ways of browsing for iBooks. Click a tab — Featured, 
Top Charts, NYTimes, Categories, or Top Authors — to browse its iBooks.
Of course, you can also search for a book or an author; just type a word or two 
in the search field near the upper-right corner of the iBooks window and press 
Return.

CHAPTER 17  The Multimedia Mac     329
When you see a book or ad that interests you, click it, and details will fill the screen, 
as shown in Figure 17-3 for the previous edition (and former title) of this book.
Click the Buy Book button to buy a book or click the Get button to “buy” a free 
book.
Most books offer a free sample, or a chapter or chapters that you can download for 
free. Click the Get Sample button, and a sample will appear in your iBooks library 
within a few minutes.
One last thing: The little arrows to the right of the Library button are Forward and 
Back buttons (⌘  +[ and ⌘  +], respectively), which work just like the Forward and 
Back buttons in Finder, Safari, and iTunes Store. Click the one on the left to return 
to the previous screen; click the one on the right to move to the next screen.

When you finish shopping, click the Library button in the upper-left corner of the 
iBooks window to return to your iBooks library.
Shopping for books without Apple
iBooks can also handle books you acquire elsewhere, and it supports a technical 
standard called ePub, which is a format that offers hundreds of thousands of free 
and public domain books on the web. You can import such files into iBooks, so 
you don’t ever have to shop (or only shop) in the iBooks Store. The only possible 
gotcha is that the ePub titles must be DRM-free, which means free of any digital 
rights restrictions.
You can find ePub titles at numerous cyberspace destinations:
»
» Baen: www.baen.com
»
» Feedbooks: www.feedbooks.com
»
» Google Play: Not all the books here are free, and Google has a downloadable 
app. http://play.google.com/store/books
»
» Project Gutenberg: www.gutenberg.us
»
» Smashwords: www.smashwords.com
To import an ePub title, download the file to your Mac, fire up iBooks, and then 
do one of the following:
»
» Choose File  ➪  Add to Library, select the ePub file, and click Add.
»
» Drag the ePub file into your iBooks library.
Before I move on to reading iBooks, I feel obliged to mention that between the free 
books in the iBooks Store and ePub books available from the sites in the preced-
ing list and elsewhere, tons of great books out there are free and tons more are 
good, pretty good, or okay (and free). The point is that you can read a lot without 
spending a dime.
You can’t add books made for the Amazon Kindle to iBooks, not even ones that are 
DRM-free. You have to download the free Kindle app from the Mac App Store if 
you want to read Kindle books.
You can add PDF files to iBooks; it works the same as adding an ePub title. After 
they’re imported, they appear in the PDF section of your iBooks library.

Reading iBooks
To start reading a book, double-click it, and it leaps off the shelf. At the same time, 
it opens to either the beginning of the book or the place where you left off, even if 
you left off reading on another device — an iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, or another 
Mac. iBooks uses your Apple ID to save your virtual place in your virtual book and 
syncs it among your devices (as long as the devices have Internet access).
Figure 17-4 shows two pages of text from a typical iBook.
You have to move your cursor to the top of the window before the buttons will 
appear.
Now, here’s how to read an iBook:

» To make/delete a bookmark: Although iBooks kindly returns you to the last 
page you were reading when you closed a book (on any device), you may want 
to bookmark a specific page so you can easily return to it. To do so, just click 
the Bookmarks button near the upper-right corner of the iBooks window. A 
red ribbon appears, signifying that a bookmark is in place. Click the red ribbon 
to remove the bookmark.

the font style you want to switch to.
Your choices at this time are Original (the default), Athelas, Charter, Georgia, 
Iowan, Palatino, San Francisco, Seravek, and Times New Roman. I don’t 
necessarily expect you to know what these look like just by the font names. 
Fortunately, you get to examine the change right before your eyes. A check 
mark indicates the currently selected font style.

may not be quite like having Mom or Dad read you to sleep, but it can be a 
potential godsend for people with impaired vision. To listen instead of 
reading, do the following:
a.	 Click at the spot where you want to begin from or select the text you want 
to hear.

CHAPTER 17  The Multimedia Mac     333
You’re the Star with Photo Booth
The Photo Booth application provides all the fun of an old-time (or new-time) 
photo booth, like the ones you sometimes see in malls or stores. It lets you shoot 
one photo, shoot a burst of four photos in a row, or shoot a movie using your 
Mac’s built-in camera. If yours is one of the rare Macs with no built-in camera 
(such as the Mac mini) or you own a USB or FireWire webcam better than the 
built-in model, you’ll be pleased to hear that most USB and FireWire webcams 
work with Photo Booth right out of the box with no drivers or other software nec-
essary. Just launch Photo Booth and look in the Camera menu, where all compat-
ible cameras appear.
If you have only one camera available  — mine is called FaceTime HD Camera 
(Built-In)  — it’s selected automatically, so you shouldn’t have to even bother 
with the Camera menu.
Photo Booth couldn’t be easier to use. Start by clicking one of the three buttons in 
the lower-left corner of the Photo Booth window — Burst (of four photos), Single 
Photo (selected in Figure 17-5), or Movie — and then click the big, red camera 
button to take a picture, as shown in Figure 17-5.
Before you shoot, you may want to explore the five pages of special effects — 
Sepia Tone, Color Pencil, Pop Art, and dozens more — by clicking the Effects but-
ton (lower right) and then clicking the particular effect you want to try. If you like 
it, click the big, red camera button and shoot a picture, pictures, or video; if you 
FIGURE 17-5: 
Photo Booth

a picture of 
yours truly.

334     PART 5  Getting Creative
don’t, click the Effects button again and click another effect. Or if you prefer to 
shoot with no effects, click the Normal effect in the center of all the Effects pages.
Photo Booth includes a feature called Screen Flash, which uses your computer 
display as a camera flash by turning the screen all-white as it shoots the photo. 
If your screen isn’t flashing when you shoot, look in the Camera menu and make 
sure that the Enable Screen Flash command has a check mark. Finally, Screen 
Flash is (understandably) disabled when you’re shooting movies.
After you shoot, your pictures or movies drop into the tray at the bottom of the 
window (there’s one photo in Figure 17-5). You can then select one or more pho-
tos in the tray and then do any of the following:
»
» Delete them by pressing the Delete or Backspace key.
»
» Share them by clicking the Share button, which replaces the Effects button 
when one or more photos are selected in the tray.
»
» Export them as JPEG files by choosing File  ➪  Export.
»
» Print them by choosing File  ➪  Print or pressing ⌘  +P.
»
» Drag them from the tray to the desktop, a folder, an email, or an iMessage, 
where they appear as JPEG files; or drag them onto an image editor icon such 
as Photos (on the dock or in the Applications folder). Note that they’re not 
automatically saved in your Photos library or elsewhere, so if you don’t drag 
them somewhere, they exist only in the tray of the Photo Booth app.
So that’s the scoop on Photo Booth. It’s fun and easy, and if you have a camera  
(as most of you do), you should definitely launch Photo Booth and give it a try.
If you have kids who are old enough to trust with a Mac, Photo Booth and its 
effects will entertain them for hours (or, more likely, for a few minutes).
Viewing and Converting Images  
and PDFs in Preview
You use Preview to open, view, and print PDFs as well as most graphics files (TIFF, 
JPEG, PICT, and so on). PDF files are formatted documents that can include text 
and images. User manuals, books, and the like are often distributed as PDF files. 
You can’t edit the existing text in a PDF file with Preview, but you can leaf through 
its pages, annotate and mark it up, and print it. You can often select text and 

CHAPTER 17  The Multimedia Mac     335
graphics in a PDF file, copy them to the Clipboard (⌘  +C), and paste (⌘  +V) them 
into documents in other applications. It’s also the application that pops open 
when you click the Preview button in the Print dialog, as I describe in Chapter 19.
Actually, that’s not entirely true. You can edit one certain type of PDF file: a form 
that has blank fields. Preview allows you to fill in the blanks and then resave 
the document. And although it’s technically not editing, you can annotate a PDF 
document by using the Annotate tools on the toolbar.
One of the most useful things Preview can do is change the file format of a graphic 
file. For example, say you’re signing up for a website and want to add a picture to 
your profile. The website requires pictures in the JPEG file format, but the picture 
file on your hard drive that you’d like to use is in the TIFF file format. Preview can 
handle the conversion for you:
1.	 Double-click the TIFF file to open it with Preview.
If another program (such as Adobe Photoshop) opens instead of Preview, drag 
the TIFF document onto the Preview icon or launch Preview and choose 
File  ➪  Open (⌘  +O) to open the TIFF file.
2.	 Choose File  ➪  Export.
3.	 Choose the appropriate file format — such as JPEG — from the Format 
pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 17-6.
FIGURE 17-6: 
Preview

to convert a 
graphic file 
from one 
format to 
another.

336     PART 5  Getting Creative
4.	 (Optional) If you want to make sure you don’t confuse your original 
image with the one in the new format, change the name of your file in 
the Export As field.
5.	 (Optional) Add a tag or tags if you like.
6.	 Click Save.
As you can see in Figure 17-6, Preview lets you convert any file it can open to any 
of the following file formats: JPEG, JPEG-2000, OpenEXR, PDF, PNG, and TIFF.
You’ll probably never need to convert a file to most of these formats, but it’s nice 
to know that you can if you need to.
Almost every macOS program with a Print command allows you to save your doc-
ument as a PDF file. Just click and hold down on the PDF button (found in all Print 
dialogs) and choose Save as PDF. Then, should you ever need to convert that PDF 
file to a different file format, you can do so by using the preceding steps.
Importing Media
Chances are good that you’ll want to import pictures or video from your digital 
camera or DV camcorder someday. This is where I show you how easy it is to 
get your digital photos into your Mac and help you get started with digital video 
(which is a bit more complex).
In the sections that follow, I focus on applications that are a part of macOS.
Downloading photos from a camera
This is the Mac I’m talking about, so of course getting pictures from your digi-
tal camera onto your hard drive is a simple task. Here’s how to do it using High 
Sierra’s Image Capture app:
1.	 Turn on your digital camera, and set it to review or playback mode.
This step may not be necessary for some cameras. It is for my old Olympus but 
isn’t for my Nikon Coolpix P1.
2.	 Connect the camera to your Mac with its USB cable or insert its SD card into 
a USB card reader or the built-in SD card reader on some Mac models.
At this point, Image Capture may launch automatically. If you have iPhoto or 
Photos, it may launch instead.

CHAPTER 17  The Multimedia Mac     337
If the wrong one opens when you connect your camera, you can change that 
behavior in Image Capture’s Device Settings pane. How do you know which is 
the right one? Well, Image Capture does only one thing — import photos from 
an external device to a folder on your Mac. The Photos app is a full-service 
photography studio in a single app. It not only imports photos to its own library 
but also offers myriad features for managing, organizing, and editing your 
images. For simplicity’s sake, I use Image Capture in this example; the process 
is similar for Photos.
Launch Image Capture (in your Applications folder) if it didn’t launch when 
you connected your camera. Now choose the application you prefer for 
photo management from the Connecting This Camera Opens pop-up menu. 
(It says Image Capture in Figure 17-7; other options could include iPhoto, 
Aperture, Photoshop, Photoshop Elements, Adobe Bridge, or whatever 
photo-management app you have installed on your hard drive.)
If your camera isn’t selected in the Devices section of the sidebar, select it now.
3.	 From the Image Capture window, you can click either Import All to 
download all the photos in your camera or Import to import only the 
selected photos.
•	 To choose contiguous photos, click the first photo you want to download, 
press Shift, and then click the last photo you want to download.
•	 To choose noncontiguous photos, press ⌘   and click each photo you want to 
download. Either way, the names of the selected files are highlighted to 
indicate which photos will be downloaded when you click the Import 
button (the figure third from the right in the second row).
In Figure 17-7, the Import To pop-up menu is set to the Desktop folder (the default 
is your Pictures folder). If you were to click the Import or Import All button now, 
Image Capture would download the photos in your camera to your desktop.
If you want to delete selected photos from your camera after they’re downloaded 
to your hard drive, select the photos you want to delete, and click the Delete 
Selected button (a red circle with a slash through it). To delete all photos after you 
import them, select the Delete after Import check box.
If a disk icon (EOS_DIGITAL in Figure  17-7, but frequently named NO NAME) 
appears in the Devices section of the sidebar when you plug in your camera, you 
have to eject that disk by clicking the Eject Disk icon next to its name in the Image 
Capture window (or by ejecting it in Finder in the usual way) before you discon-
nect your camera; otherwise, you could lose or damage files in your camera. So 
try to remember. If you don’t, Image Capture scolds you with the scary warning 
notification shown in Figure 17-8.

338     PART 5  Getting Creative
When you connect a camera or an 
iDevice to your Mac, it appears in the 
Devices section of Image Capture, just 
like a camera or camcorder. Which 
makes total sense if you think about 
it, because they are (among other 
things) cameras and camcorders.
And before we leave Image Capture, 
I’d be remiss not to mention that you 
can use it also to control many third-party scanners and multifunction printer 
scanners. If they’re available in the Printers & Scanners System Preferences pane 
and you’ve enabled Printer Sharing in the Sharing System Preferences pane, 
they’ll appear in the Shared section of Image Capture’s sidebar.
If you want a different app (or no app at all) to launch when you connect this 
camera or iDevice to your Mac, check out the tip in Step 2.

to open Image 
Capture when 
I connect this 
camera.

CHAPTER 17  The Multimedia Mac     339
Downloading DV video from a camcorder
Getting video from a DV camcorder to your hard drive is almost as easy as import-
ing photos from your digital camera. It’s beyond the scope of this book to explain 
how to download video, considering the myriad of video-recording devices avail-
able, but here are a few general tips to get you started.
iMovie works well for downloading video from miniDV and HD camcorders that 
include output via FireWire or USB2 or USB3.
If you do plan to use iMovie, don’t forget about the built-in Help system 
(⌘  +Shift+/). Here, you find extensive assistance with downloading footage and 
more.
Never insert a mini-DVD into a slot-loading optical drive like the ones in many 
Macs shipped before 2013. If your camcorder records on mini-DVDs, you’ll need 
to spring for a tray-loading external optical drive.
One last thing: Some video cameras may require you to install driver software 
before your Mac can “see” them. Check your camera’s manual for details.

Words and Letters
A
s I discuss in previous chapters, your Mac is well equipped for creating and 
managing media — music, movies, and photos — but it is also ready to 
handle more common tasks, such as typing a letter or composing an essay. 
I think it’s fair to say that the TextEdit application we’re about to explore is all the 
word processor many users will ever need for casual everyday writing.
If you need more control over your pages than TextEdit provides, try Pages from 
Apple, a powerful word processor and page layout program, which is free in the 
Mac App Store and also available online (also free) at www.icloud.com.
Furthermore, macOS comes with a wide variety of fonts (sometimes called type-
faces) plus a handy little app called Font Book for managing those fonts. Fonts 
allow you to change how text looks on the screen and the printed page.
In this chapter, you look at the macOS text composition and text-editing 
program — TextEdit — and then explore fonts and how to manage them.
Processing Words with TextEdit
TextEdit is a word processor and text editor that you can use to write letters, 
scribble notes, open Read Me files, and much more. It’s not as sophisticated as 
Microsoft Word or Apple’s Pages, but you can use it for many word-processing 
and text-editing tasks.

342     PART 5  Getting Creative
TextEdit is capable of performing a respectable amount of text formatting, and it 
can even check your spelling and read text to you in a natural-sounding (if some-
what creepy) voice.
TextEdit supports images, too. Just copy an image from another program and 
paste it into a TextEdit document. Or drag and drop an image into a TextEdit 
document from many applications or Finder.
TextEdit can even open Microsoft Word documents (.doc and .docx files), which is 
fabulous if you don’t happen to have a copy of Microsoft Word on your hard drive. 
It can also open .rtf, .odt, .htm, .html, and .txt files, should you need to view a 
document saved in any of these popular file formats.
Like all apps included with High Sierra, you find TextEdit in the Applications 
folder at the root level on your hard drive.
The dock doesn’t have a TextEdit icon preinstalled, but if you like TextEdit, use it 
regularly, or would just like to have it on your dock, either drag its icon from the 
Applications folder to anyplace on the left side of the dock or launch it, right- or 
Control-click its dock icon, and then choose Options  ➪  Keep in Dock.
Creating and composing a document
You’ll get the most from the rest of this chapter if you have TextEdit open. So if 
it’s not already open, open TextEdit now.
When you launch TextEdit, it presents an Open File dialog (see Chapter 6). So, if 
you’re following along at home, you should now have an Open File dialog on your 
screen. Click the New Document button in the lower-left corner, and an Untitled 
document appears. Let its default (and ambiguous) name — Untitled — be a mes-
sage to you that before you begin working on this document you should probably 
give it a name and save it to your hard drive or iCloud Drive. To do so now, choose 
File  ➪  Save or press ⌘  +S. (If you’re new to macOS Save sheets, flip to Chapter 6 
for details.)
As you work with the document, it’s a good idea to save it every few minutes, just 
in case. After you name a file, all you need to do to save its current state is choose 
File  ➪  Save or press ⌘  +S.
TextEdit uses new-style version support and auto-save features, so your work is 
saved automatically on the fly. However, don’t be lulled into a false sense of secu-
rity; many third-party apps that come from sources other than the Mac App Store 
don’t support this feature. (Chapter 6 has the lowdown on versions and saving.)

CHAPTER 18  Words and Letters     343
It’s a good idea to choose File  ➪  Save or use its shortcut, ⌘  +S, every so often 
regardless of whether the app supports versions and auto-save. Better safe than 
sorry.
Now begin typing your text. When you type text in a word processor, here are 
three tips for processing words properly:
»
» Press the Return key only when you want to start a new paragraph. You 
don’t need to press Return at the end of a line of text; the program automati-
cally wraps your text to the next line, keeping things neat and tidy.
»
» Type a single space after the punctuation mark at the end of a sentence, 
regardless of what your typing teacher might have told you. Word 
processors and typewriters aren’t the same. With a typewriter, you want 
two spaces at the end of a sentence; with a word processor, you don’t. 
(Typewriters use fixed-width fonts; computers mostly use fonts with variable 
widths. If you put two spaces at the end of a sentence in a computer-
generated document, the gap looks too wide.) Trust me on this one.
»
» Limit most documents to a maximum of two different fonts. macOS 
offers you a wide selection of fonts, but that doesn’t mean you should use 
them all in one document.
To put special characters in your TextEdit document, choose Edit  ➪  Emoji & 
Symbols (⌘  +Control+spacebar). This command opens the Character palette, from 
which you can choose characters such as mathematical symbols, arrows, orna-
ments, stars, accented Latin characters, emoji (such as smiley faces), and so on. 
To insert a character, make sure your cursor is in the document where you want 
(the insertion point), and then double-click the character in the palette.
Working with text
TextEdit operates on the “select, then operate” principle, as do most Mac 
programs, including Finder. Before you can affect (style, or format) text in your 
document — that is, change font face, style, size, margins, and so on — you need 
to select the text you want formatted.
You can use several methods to select text in a document:
»
» Select a word. Double-click the word.
»
» Select a paragraph. Triple-click a word in that paragraph.

344     PART 5  Getting Creative
»
» Select a chunk. Click anywhere in the document, hold down the Shift key, 
and then click again somewhere else in the document. Everything between 
the two clicks will be selected.
»
» Extend the selection. Click anywhere in the document, hold down the Shift 
key, and use the keyboard arrow keys to extend the selection. You can also 
click, hold down the mouse button, and drag to select text; release the mouse 
button when you’ve finished selecting.
»
» Select all text in the document. Choose Edit  ➪  Select All or use the 
shortcut ⌘  +A.
Figure 18-1 shows some selected text. You can tell that it’s selected because it is 
highlighted in blue.
Give all these methods of selecting text a try, decide which ones feel most com-
fortable, and then memorize them for future use.
Rather than bore you with a rundown of what the buttons on the TextEdit toolbar 
do, just hover the cursor over any item to display its tooltip, as I’ve done for the 
Line and Paragraph Spacing drop-down menu in Figure 18-1.
After your text is selected, you can format it. For example, you can use the Format 
menu’s Font submenu to choose Bold, Italic, Outline, or Underline (among oth-
ers), as shown in Figure 18-2. I opted for bold in Figure 18-2, and you can see in 
the figure how the selected sentence is now bold.
FIGURE 18-1: 
The third 
sentence in the 
first paragraph 
is selected.

CHAPTER 18  Words and Letters     345
Another way to apply the Bold style to the text in Figure 18-2 is by clicking the B 
(for Bold) button on the toolbar. Note that the toolbar and ruler won’t be visible if 
you’re working on a plain text (.txt) document. So if you choose Format  ➪  Make 
Plain Text (⌘  +Shift+T) while working on any document, the toolbar and ruler 
disappear.
The same idea applies to tabs and margins. In Figure 18-3, I dragged the left and 
right margin markers in one inch. Notice that the selected text is now indented by 
one inch from the left and right margins.
Select some text in your document, and try all the items in the Format menu’s 
Font and Text submenus. As you see, you have a great deal of control over the way 
your words appear on the screen. And because TextEdit, like most Mac software, 
is WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), when you print the document (by 
choosing File  ➪  Print), the printed version should look exactly like the version 
you see on the screen. For help with printing, see Chapter 19.
The View menu is your friend. Choose View  ➪  Actual Size or use its shortcut 
(⌘  +0) to see your document just as it will print. Use the View menu’s Zoom In 
and Zoom Out commands or their shortcuts — ⌘  +Shift+. (period) and ⌘  +Shift+, 
(comma) — to make everything larger or smaller.
FIGURE 18-2: 
Only the

commands.

346     PART 5  Getting Creative
Before you print your masterpiece, however, you may want to check your spelling 
and grammar — something that TextEdit makes extremely simple. Merely choose 
Edit  ➪  Spelling and Grammar  ➪  Check Document Now or press ⌘  +; (semicolon). 
TextEdit highlights and underlines what it perceives to be mistakes in your docu-
ment. Right-click (or Control-click) to bring up a menu with correction choices, 
as shown in Figure 18-4.

CHAPTER 18  Words and Letters     347
Don’t put too much faith in the High Sierra spelling and grammar checker. It’s 
good, but it’s not perfect and no substitute for a good proofreading.
Adding graphics to documents
Last but not least, you have a couple of ways to add pictures to a TextEdit docu-
ment. The first works as follows:
1.	 Copy an image in another program — Preview, Safari, or whatever.
2.	 Put the pointer where you want the picture to appear in your TextEdit 
document.
3.	 Choose Edit  ➪  Paste.
The image magically appears on the page.
Or you can drag an image from Finder (or another application such as Safari or 
Mail) to a TextEdit document, as I did in Figure 18-5.
Note that you can’t wrap text around images in TextEdit. So if you drag an image 
to the middle of a sentence by accident, you’ll have text before and after the image 
but a huge gap on either side. To fix it, click and drag the image between para-
graphs. (You may find it necessary to add an extra Return between paragraphs to 
get the image where you want it.)

Font Mania
You can jazz up your documents — or make them a little more serious — with dif-
ferent fonts. To a computer user, font means typeface — what the text characters 
look like. Although professional typographers will scream at my generalization, 
I’ll go with that definition for now.
Tens of thousands of different fonts are available for the Mac. You don’t want 
to use the same font for both a garage-sale flyer and a résumé, right? Luckily 
for you, macOS comes with hundreds of fonts. Some are pretty predictable, such 
as Times New Roman, but macOS gives you some artsy ones, too, such as Brush 
Script.
If you really get into fonts, you can buy single fonts and font collections anywhere 
you can buy software. Plenty of shareware and public domain fonts are also avail-
able from online services and user groups. Some people have thousands of fonts. 
(Maybe they need to get out more.) To see how to manage extra fonts you collect, 
check out the upcoming section, “Managing your fonts with Font Book.”
The preinstalled fonts live in two different folders, both called Fonts. One is in 
the Library folder at the root level on your hard drive; the other is in the Library 
subfolder within the System folder.
macOS actually has four Font folders. A third one, also called Fonts, is in the (hid-
den) Library folder in your Home directory. The upcoming section explains the 
subtle distinctions among those three locations.
The fourth one is in the Network/Library folder, and you see it only when you’re 
connected to a NetBoot network server.
Types of fonts
You can find many font formats with names such as OpenType, Mac TrueType, 
Windows TrueType, PostScript Type 1, bitmap, and dfont. No problem — macOS 
supports them all.
The only font format I know that macOS doesn’t support is PostScript Type 3.
All you really need to know is that pretty much any font you buy or download will 
probably work with High Sierra.

CHAPTER 18  Words and Letters     349
Managing your fonts with Font Book
Font Book lets you view your installed fonts, install new fonts, group your fonts 
into collections, and enable and disable installed fonts. As usual, you find the Font 
Book application in the Applications folder at the root level on your hard drive.
The easiest way to install a new font is to double-click it in Finder. Font Book 
opens and displays the font. Click the Install Font button to install the font.
Other ways you can install new fonts are to choose File  ➪  Add Fonts or press 
⌘  +O. A standard Open dialog allows you to select a font or fonts to be installed.
Note that, by default, new fonts are installed in your Home folder’s Fonts folder, 
which is inside your invisible Library folder (Users/Home/Library/Fonts). You 
can change the default installation location in Font Book’s Preferences (Font 
Book  ➪  Preferences or ⌘  +, [comma]).
To view a font or font family, click its name in the Font list. Click the disclosure 
triangle before the name of a font to see all the variants that are installed.
To change the size of the viewed font, click the triangle next to the font size (40, 
in Figure 18-6) in the top-right corner of the Font Book window and choose a new 
size from the drop-down list that appears, or type a different number where the 
number 40 appears in Figure 18-6, or move the size slider — the white dot with a 
blue line below it near the right edge of the window — up or down.

To disable a font so it no longer appears on any applications’ Font menus, choose 
Edit  ➪  Disable or click the Disable button (the check mark in a square on the 
toolbar).
To enable a previously disabled font, choose Edit  ➪  Enable or click the Enable 
button (same as the Disable button).
Font Book looks out for your best interests; it won’t allow you to disable or delete 
any fonts required by High Sierra — including (but not limited to) Lucida Grande, 
Helvetica, and Helvetica Neue.
Installing fonts manually
To install a new font manually, drag its icon into one of the two Fonts folders that 
you have access to. Why might you want to install them manually? If you install a 
font via the double-click-and-use-Font Book method, the font will be installed in 
your Home/Library/Fonts folder, and available only to you.
If you want other users to be able to access the new font, drag the font’s icon to 
the Fonts subfolder inside the Library folder, which is at the root level of your hard 
drive. This Fonts folder offers universal access. Or, if you usually want to install 
fonts for everyone, change the Default Install Location in Font Book Preferences 
(Font Book  ➪  Preferences or ⌘  +, [comma]).
The Fonts folder in the Library inside the System folder is reserved for macOS and 
can’t be modified easily. If you try to remove a font from it — or add one, for that 
matter — you first have to authenticate yourself as an administrator. Do yourself 
a favor and never remove fonts from /System/Library/Fonts. You can really screw 
up your High Sierra operating system if you remove the wrong font, so don’t 
go messing with the fonts in folders unless you know what you’re doing. Your 
best bet is to always use Font Book, which prevents you from doing anything bad 
to fonts.
One last thing: Try to refrain from installing more fonts than you’ll use. ­Having 
tons of installed fonts can slow down some apps and make the Font menu 
long and unmanageable. Install only the fonts you need — your Mac will thank 
you for it.

The Fail-Safe Guide 
to Printing
W
hen you want to get what’s on your screen onto paper, printing under 
High Sierra should be as simple as pressing the keyboard shortcut ⌘  +P 
and pressing Return. Happily, that’s usually just how easy printing 
something is. Unfortunately, when it isn’t just that easy, printing can turn into a 
raging nightmare. If you configure your printer and printing software properly, 
however, printing is generally a simple affair forever more.
In this chapter, I scare away the bogeymen to help you avoid any printing night-
mares. I walk you through the entire process as though you just unpacked a new 
printer and plugged it in.

Before Diving In . . .
Before I even start talking about hooking up printers, you need to know a few 
essential things. So here’s a little list that tells you just what those things are:
»
» Read the documentation that came with your printer. Hundreds of 
different printer makes and models are available for the Mac, so if I contradict 
something in your printer manual, follow your manual’s instructions first. If 
that effort doesn’t work, try the techniques in this chapter.
»
» The Print and Page Setup sheets differ slightly (or even greatly) from 
program to program and from printer to printer. Although the examples I 
show you in this chapter are representative of what you’ll probably encounter, 
you might come across sheets that look a bit different. For example, the Print 
and Page Setup sheets for Microsoft Word include choices that I don’t cover in 
this chapter (such as Even or Odd Pages Only, Print Hidden Text, and Print 
Selection Only). If you see commands in your Print or Page Setup sheet that 
I don’t explain here, they’re specific to that application; look in its documenta-
tion for an explanation. Similarly, many graphics-related apps — such as 
Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop — have added their own Print dialog, which 
appears before the High Sierra print sheet with list boxes, radio buttons, and 
other controls, to the point where you might not even recognize them as 
Print dialogs.
»
» Don’t forget about Help. Of course, it’s built into High Sierra and better than 
ever, but many third-party programs support this excellent Apple technology, 
which can be the fastest way to figure out a feature that has you stumped. So 
don’t forget to check out the Help menu before you panic. (I cover the Help 
menu in Chapter 1.)
Ready: Connecting and 
Adding Your Printer
Before you can even think about printing something, you have to connect a printer 
to your Mac and tell High Sierra that the printer exists.
If you have a printer and are able to print documents already, you can skip ahead 
to the “Set: Setting Up Your Document with Page Setup” section. The info between 
here and there pertains only to setting up a new printer — one that still has its 
manual.

CHAPTER 19  Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing     353
Connecting your printer
Once again, I must remind you that you could connect your Mac to thousands of 
printer models, and each one is a little different from the next. In other words, 
if what you’re about to read doesn’t work with the printer you’re trying to con-
nect, RTFM (Read the Fine Manual). It should tell you how to load your ink or 
toner cartridges, and anything else you might need to know to set up your printer 
successfully.
That said, here are some very general steps to connect a printer to your Mac:
1.	 Connect the printer to your Mac with the cable snugly attached at both 
ends (printer and Mac).
For your printer to work, you have to somehow connect it to a data source. For 
what it’s worth, connecting with a cable is usually more reliable than connect-
ing wirelessly.
2.	 Plug the printer’s AC power cord into a power outlet. (Ignore this step if 
your printer supports wireless printing and you intend to print only 
wirelessly.)
Yup, I mean the regular kind of outlet in the wall; on a power strip; or, best of 
all, on a UPS (uninterruptible power supply). Some printers require you to plug 
one end of the AC power cord into the printer; others have the AC power cord 
attached permanently. The point is that your printer won’t work if it’s not 
connected to a power source.
3.	 Turn on your printer.
Look in the manual if you can’t find the power switch.
Setting up a printer for the first time
After you connect your computer and printer, provide a power source for your 
printer, and install the software for your printer, you’re ready . . . to configure 
your Mac. You have to do that so your Mac and your printer can talk to each other.
Many, if not all, of the steps involving the Printers & Scanners System Prefer-
ences pane require that your printer be turned on and warmed up (that is, already 
through its diagnostics and start-up cycle) beforehand. So before doing anything 
else, make sure your printer is turned on, warmed up, and connected to your Mac.
The first time you connect your printer, you may see an alert asking whether you 
want to download and install software for your printer.

354     PART 5  Getting Creative
You do, so click the Install button. At this point, you may see a License Agreement 
window. If so, click the Agree button to proceed. (You may click Disagree if you 
want, but that halts the installation process.)
If you connect a new printer and don’t see an alert, don’t worry; just follow the 
upcoming instructions.
After clicking the Install and Agree buttons, a Software Update window may 
appear and tell you it’s finding software. If it does, just leave it alone; it disap-
pears after a minute or two. Don’t click the Stop button unless you want to abort 
the installation.
Here are the steps to set up a printer for the first time:
1.	 Launch System Preferences, click the Printers & Scanners icon, and then 
click your printer’s name in the Printers list on the left side of the 
window.
You can open System Preferences from the  menu, or launch it from the 
Applications folder, dock, or Launchpad.
High Sierra is a pretty smart cat; it should have already recognized your printer 
at this point. If so, your printer’s name appears in the Printers list of the 
Printers & Scanners System Preferences pane, as shown on the left in 
Figure 19-1. The new printer I’m setting up in Figure 19-1 (having already 
downloaded and installed its software) is an Epson ET-4550 Series.
•	 If your printer isn’t in the list at this point: Click the + button at the bottom of 
the Printers list, and then select it from the list in the Add dialog that 
appears (the right image in Figure 19-1), and then click the Add button.
•	 If you still can’t see your printer in the Add dialog: You probably need to install 
(or reinstall) its driver software manually, by downloading the latest driver 
software from your printer manufacturer’s website. See the nearby sidebar 
“Go for a driver” for more on drivers.
You can’t proceed until the Printers & Scanners System Preferences pane 
recognizes your printer. So install that driver if necessary and then proceed 
onward.
2.	 In the Default Printer pop-up menu, choose the printer you want selected 
by default when you print documents (Last Printer Used is selected in 
Figure 19-1).

CHAPTER 19  Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing     355
3.	 In the Default Paper Size menu, select the default paper size you want to 
use with this printer (usually US Letter, if you live in the United States).
That’s all there is to it. Close System Preferences, and you’re ready to print 
your first document! Before you do, however, make sure you have the 
document set up to look just the way you want it to look printed. Read 
through “Set: Setting Up Your Document with Page Setup” later in this chapter 
for more info.
FIGURE 19-1:

printer that 
High Sierra 
recognizes 
here — Epson 
ET-4550 
Series — is 
displayed on 
the left side 
of the System 
Preferences 
window.
GO FOR A DRIVER
Apple includes a library of printer drivers with High Sierra, which covers most popular 
printer brands and models. These drivers are installed by default. High Sierra also checks 
to see whether a newer driver is available — for every driver in its library — and if it finds 
one, it offers to download and install the new driver (as described earlier in this chapter).
If High Sierra can’t find a driver for your printer, you need to manually install the appro-
priate printer drivers before your printer will appear in the Printers list in the Printers & 
Scanners System Preferences pane. So go download the driver from the manufacturer’s 
website, install it, and get ready to print.
One more thing: Many printer manufacturers periodically introduce new drivers with 
enhanced functionality. So if there a CD was in the box with your printer, I’d be willing to 
bet the driver on it is out of date. My advice is to ignore the CD and let High Sierra take 
care of installing or updating your printer driver if possible. And if for some reason High 
Sierra can’t manage it (which is rare), download the most recent version from the ven-
dor’s website rather than installing the (probably outdated) version on the CD that came 
with the printer.

356     PART 5  Getting Creative
One last thing: Printer sharing
If you want to share a printer that’s connected directly to your Mac (with others 
on your local area wired or wireless network), select it in the Printers list on the 
left side of the Printers & Scanners System Preferences pane, and then select the 
Share This Printer on the Network check box.
To fine-tune your shared printer, click the Sharing Preferences button on the 
right, and the Sharing System Preferences pane (which I discuss in detail in 
Chapter 15) replaces the Printers & Scanners pane. Make sure the check box next 
to Printer Sharing is enabled.
By default, printer sharing is available to everyone. If you want to limit it to spe-
cific users, click the + button below the Users section of the Sharing System Pref-
erences pane and add them by user name.
Finally, the printer is unavailable unless your Mac is up and running.
Set: Setting Up Your Document  
with Page Setup
After you set up your printer, the hard part is over. You should be able to print 
a document quickly and easily — right? Not so fast, bucko. Read here how the 
features in the Page Setup sheet can help you solve most basic printing problems.
Many programs have a Page Setup command on their File menu. Note that some 
programs use the name Page Setup, and others use Print Setup. (Print Setup is the 
quaint, old term, more popular in the 1980s’ System 6 era and in today’s Windows 
than on today’s Macs.) Either way, this is the sheet where you can choose your 
target printer, paper size, page orientation, and scale (as shown in Figure 19-2).
Become familiar with Page Setup. You might not need to use it right this second, 
but it’s a good friend to know. Even though some apps offer some of these Page 
Setup settings in their Print sheets, Page Setup is the only place you find these 
options in many programs.
Users of network printers might see slightly different versions of the Print and 
Page Setup sheets. The differences should be minor enough not to matter.

CHAPTER 19  Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing     357
Click the little question mark in the bottom-left corner of the Page Setup or Print 
sheets at any time for additional help. If you do, Page Setup or Printing help opens 
immediately in Help Center. (Okay, maybe not immediately, but Help Center in 
High Sierra is faster than Help Viewer in, say, Mountain Lion or Mavericks.)
The options in the Page Setup sheet are as follows:
»
» Format For: In this pop-up menu, you find the name of all recognized 
printers. If you have several printers configured, you can choose any of them 
from this menu.
This menu usually defaults to Any Printer, which is the least-effective setting. 
Unless the printer you want to use appears here, you may not get full 
functionality when you print.
»
» Paper Size: Use this pop-up menu to choose the type of paper currently in 
the paper tray of your printer or to choose the size of the paper that you want 
to feed manually. The dimensions of the paper that you can choose appear 
below its name.
Page Setup sheet settings (including Paper Size) remain in effect until you 
change them. For example, when you print an envelope, don’t forget to 
change back to Letter before trying to print on letter-size paper again.
»
» Orientation: Choose among options here to tell your printer whether the 
page you want to print should be portrait-oriented (like a letter, longer than it 
is wide) or landscape-oriented (sideways, wider than it is long).
»
» Scale: To print your page at a larger or smaller size, change this option to a 
larger or smaller percentage.
FIGURE 19-2: 
The Page 
Setup sheet in 
the TextEdit 
application.

358     PART 5  Getting Creative
All these options remain in effect until you choose a different option.
Some programs offer additional Page Setup choices. If your program offers them, 
they usually appear in the Settings pop-up menu in the Page Setup sheet. (Adobe 
Photoshop and Microsoft Word have them; TextEdit doesn’t.)
Print: Printing with the Print Sheet
After you connect and configure your printer and set up how you want your docu-
ment to print, you come to the final steps before that joyous moment when your 
printed page pops out of the printer. Navigating the Print sheet is the last thing 
standing between you and your output.
Although most Print sheets that you see look like the figures I show here, others 
may differ slightly (or, occasionally, greatly). The features in the Print sheet are a 
function of the program with which you’re printing. Many programs choose to use 
the standard-issue Apple sheet, but not all do. If I don’t explain a certain feature 
in this chapter, chances are good that the feature is specific to the application 
or printer you’re using (in which case, the documentation for that program or 
printer should offer an explanation).
Printing a document
If everything has gone well so far, the actual act of printing a document is simple. 
Just follow the steps here, and in a few minutes, pages should start popping out 
of your printer like magic. (In the sections that follow, I talk about some print 
options that you’ll probably need someday.)
1.	 Open a document that you want to print.
2.	 Choose File  ➪  Print (or press ⌘  +P).
You see the basic Print sheet, as shown in Figure 19-3.
3.	 Click Print.
4.	 Wait a moment for the network to tell the printer what to do, and then 
walk over to your printer to get your document.

CHAPTER 19  Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing     359
Choosing File  ➪  Print (⌘  +P) won’t work for you if any one of the following is true 
for the software you’re using:
»
» The Print command is on a different menu.
»
» There is no Print command. (Hey, it could happen! For example, Finder has no 
Print command.)
»
» The Print keyboard shortcut is something other than ⌘  +P.
If any of the preceding is true for a program you’re using, you just have to wing 
it. Look in all the menus and check out the product’s documentation to try to get 
a handle on the Print command for that pesky program.
Choosing among different printers
Just as you can in the Page Setup sheet, you can choose which printer you want to 
use from the Printer pop-up menu of the Print sheet.
You can choose only among the printers you added via the Printers & Scanners 
System Preferences pane, as I describe earlier in this chapter in the section I lov-
ingly call “Setting up a printer for the first time.” This includes printers con-
nected to wireless base stations and routers, as well as Wi-Fi–enabled printers. 
After they’re set up, Macs (and other devices) within range can print to these 
printers wirelessly.
FIGURE 19-3: 
Your basic 
Print sheet.

360     PART 5  Getting Creative
Choosing custom settings
By default, the Print sheet is displayed with its details hidden. As such, just four 
menus are available: Printer, Presets, Pages, and PDF. To reveal the rest of the 
Print options, click the Show Details button near the bottom of the Print sheet. 
An expanded Print sheet with all the details you’re likely to need, as shown in 
Figure 19-4, replaces the more streamlined version shown earlier in Figure 19-3.
Click in any of the fields and press the Tab key. Your cursor jumps to the next 
text field; likewise, press Shift+Tab to jump to the previous field. By the way, this 
shortcut works in almost any program, window, dialog, or web page that has text 
fields.
In addition to the drop-down Printer menu, your expanded Print sheet offers the 
following options:
»
» Presets: This menu lets you manage and save print settings, as described in 
the “Saving custom settings” section later in this chapter.
»
» Copies: In this text field, set how many copies you want to print. The Print 
sheet defaults to one copy (1) in most applications, so you probably see the 
numeral 1 in the Copies field when the Print sheet appears. Assuming that’s 
the case, don’t do anything if you want to print only one copy. If you want to 
print more than one copy of your document, highlight the 1 that appears in 
the Copies field and replace it, typing the number of copies you want.
FIGURE 19-4: 
Your expanded 
Print sheet.

CHAPTER 19  Publish or Perish: The Fail-Safe Guide to Printing     361
»
» Pages: Here, you find two radio buttons: All and From. The default behavior is 
to print your entire document, so the All option is preselected. But if you want 
to print only a specific page or range of pages, select the From radio button 
and type the desired page numbers in the From and To text fields.
Suppose that you print a 10-page document and only then notice a typo on 
Page 2. After you correct your error, you don’t have to reprint the whole 
document — you can reprint only the page with the correction. Reprint only 
Page 2 by typing 2 in both the From and To fields. You can type any valid 
range of pages (um, you can’t print page 20 if your document is only 15 pages 
long) in the From and To fields.
»
» Paper Size: Use options in this pop-up menu to choose the type of paper 
currently in your printer’s paper tray, or to choose the size of the paper that 
you want to feed manually. The dimensions of the paper appear below its 
name.
Yeah, this setting is also in Page Setup. The difference is that the settings here 
(in the Print sheet) apply only to this document, whereas the settings in Page 
Setup are the default for all documents and remain in effect until you change 
them in Page Setup. This can be handy when, for example, you print an 
envelope. If you change the paper size setting for the envelope document, you 
don’t have to remember to change it back to Letter in Page Setup.
»
» Orientation: Yeah (again), this setting is also in Page Setup. And once again, 
the choice you make in Page Setup is the default for all pages you print. Keep 
in mind that the setting you choose here (in the Print sheet) applies only to 
this document. Choose among options here to tell your printer whether the 
page you want to print should be portrait or landscape oriented.
The following list describes the features you can find in the unlabeled menu found 
in the expanded Print sheet (the one that says TextEdit in Figure 19-4). In addition 
to TextEdit, Layout, and other options I cover in a moment, your pop-up menu 
may offer options such as Media & Quality, Color Options, Special Effects, and 
Borderless Printing. (Whether you have these options depends on your printer 
model and its driver as well as the application from which you’re printing.) Check 
out these options if you have ’em; they usually offer useful features:
»
» TextEdit: The only TextEdit-specific options, as shown in Figure 19-4, are two 
check boxes. One governs whether to print a header and footer for this 
document; the other lets you choose to rewrap the contents of the document 
to fit the page.
You can see the results of clicking these check boxes in the proxy image of 
your document on the left half of the sheet.

362     PART 5  Getting Creative
»
» Layout: Choose Layout to set the number of pages per printed sheet, the layout 
direction, and whether you prefer a border. Here are your options for Layout:
•	 Pages per Sheet: Choose preset numbers from this pop-up menu to set the 
number of pages that you want to print on each sheet.
Pages appear onscreen smaller than full size if you use this option.
•	 Layout Direction: Choose one of the four buttons that govern the way pages 
are laid out on the printed page.
•	 Border: Your choices from this pop-up menu are None, Single Hairline, 
Single Thin Line, Double Hairline, and Double Thin Line.
•	 Two-Sided: If your printer supports two-sided (known as duplex) printing, 
the three radio buttons allow you to specify whether you’re going to use 
two-sided printing — and if so, whether you’ll be binding (or stapling) along 
the long or short edge of the paper or creating a booklet.
Two check boxes — Reverse Page Orientation and Flip Horizontally — do just 
what they say if you enable them.
»
» Paper Handling: Choose Paper Handling if you want to reverse the order in 
which your pages print or to print only the odd- or even-numbered pages. You 
can also specify whether the document’s paper size is to be used (in which 
case, you might have lines that break across pages) or whether the output 
should be scaled to fit the chosen paper size.
»
» Cover Page: Choose Cover Page to add a cover page.
»
» Paper Type/Quality: Choose Paper Type/Quality to specify the type of paper 
in your printer and the print quality you desire. The choices are Draft, Normal, 
or Best when you print from TextEdit; other apps may offer other options.
»
» Supply Levels: Choose Supply Levels to see the current ink levels for your printer.
Saving custom settings
After you customize your printer settings just the way you like them, you can save 
them for future use. Just click the Presets pop-up menu, choose Save Current Set-
tings as Preset, and then provide a name for this preset. From then on, the preset 
name appears as an option in the Presets pop-up menu. Just choose your saved 
preset before you print any document, and all the individual settings associated 
with that preset are restored.
To manage your presets, choose Show Presets from the Print sheet’s Presets pop-
up menu. This nifty feature displays a list of your presets and their settings and 
allows you to delete, duplicate, or rename (by double-clicking their current name) 
your presets.

Preview and PDF Options
To see a preview of what your printed page will look like, choose Open PDF in 
Preview from the PDF pop-up menu in the bottom-left corner of the expanded 
Print sheet. When you do so, you see the page or pages that you’re about to print 
displayed by the Preview application, as shown in Figure 19-5.
As you probably know, High Sierra can save any printable document as a PDF file. 
To do so, choose Save As PDF in the PDF pop-up menu in every print dialog or 
sheet.
If you have any doubt about the way a document will look when you print it, check 
out Preview first. When you’re happy with the document preview, just choose 
File  ➪  Print, press ⌘  +P, or click the Print button at the bottom of the Preview 
window. Or click the Cancel button to return to your application and make changes 
to the document.
Preview works with the Preview application. With the Preview feature, you can do 
cool things like these:
»
» See all the pages in your document the way they’ll be printed, one by one.
»
» Zoom in or out to get a different perspective on what you’re about to send to 
the printer (pretty cool!).
»
» Rotate the picture 90 degrees to the left or right.
FIGURE 19-5:

364     PART 5  Getting Creative
»
» Insert (via drag and drop), delete, or reorder pages in Preview’s sidebar.
»
» Spot errors before you print something. A little up-front inspection can save 
you paper, ink or toner, and frustration.
Click the Show/Hide Edit Toolbar button (shown in the margin) to reveal a small 
toolbar with several useful tools, as shown in Figure 19-5.
Check out the Preview program’s View menu, where you’ll find (among other 
things), four useful views: Content Only, Thumbnails (shown in Figure  19-5), 
Table of Contents, and Contact Sheet, as well as the zoom commands and more.
Also check out Preview’s toolbar, from which you can add or delete buttons by 
choosing View  ➪  Customize Toolbar.
And speaking of tools, don’t miss the selections in the Tools menu, which let 
you rotate pages, move forward or backward (through multipage documents), and 
unleash the awesomeness of Magnifier, shown in Figure 19-6.
The Magnifier tool is so very darn cool that it has a rare single-key keyboard 
shortcut. That key is the ` (the grave accent, which shares a key with the tilde); 
press it to show or hide Magnifier.
One last thing: High Sierra includes the capability to fax a document right from 
the Print sheet, but it requires a compatible device with a compatible fax modem 
driver. To find out whether your device is compatible, connect the device to your 
Mac and attempt to add it as a fax modem in the Printers & Scanners System 
Preferences pane.

Features for the Way 
You Work
T
his chapter delves into some macOS High Sierra features that might very 
well improve the ways you interact with your computer. Unlike the more 
mainstream applications, System Preferences panes, and utilities that I dis-
cuss in Part 1 — Desktop, Finder, Screen Saver, Appearance, Keyboard, Trackpad, 
Mouse, and such — the items in this chapter are a little more esoteric. In other 
words, you don’t have to use any of the technologies I’m about to show you. That 
said, many of these items can make you more productive and can make using your 
Mac even better. So I’d like to believe that at least some of you will want to use at 
least a few of the cool features I’m about to introduce.
Talking and Listening to Your Mac
Your primary methods for interacting with your Mac are typing and reading text. 
But there’s another way you can commune with your faithful computer: voice.

Whether you know it or not, your Mac has a lot of speech savvy up its sleeve 
(er . . . up its processors?) and can talk to you as well as listen. Believe it or not, it 
can type the words you speak and obey your spoken commands. And most of you 
already have a microphone built into your Mac unless your Mac happens to be a 
Mac mini or a Mac Pro, which require an external microphone to hear you speak.
In the following sections, you discover how to make your Mac do that and more.
Keyboard System Preferences pane: 
You talk and your Mac types
Many users don’t realize that dictation is available in macOS and has been for 
years. In this section, you find out how to harness its power.
First, make sure Dictation is enabled in the Keyboard System Preferences pane’s 
Dictation tab; if it’s set to Off, click the On button.
Dictation requires an Internet connection unless you enable the Use Enhanced 
Dictation check box in the Keyboard System Preferences pane. Otherwise, when 
you dictate text, what you say is sent to Apple’s servers to convert it to text. If 
you enable Use Enhanced Dictation, you can use Dictation without an Internet 
connection after your Mac downloads the necessary files to your Mac. That’s the 
good news. The bad news is that the necessary files are pretty big  — a 1.2GB 
download that could take an hour or more depending on the speed of your network 
connection.
Other information, such as your contacts, may also be sent to Apple over the Inter-
net to help your Mac understand what you’re saying. If that makes you uncom-
fortable, you probably shouldn’t use the Dictation feature without first selecting 
the Use Enhanced Dictation check box.
After it’s enabled, with or without the Enhanced option, Dictation couldn’t be 
easier to use. First, click where you want your words to appear in a document, 
dialog, web form, or whatever, and then choose Edit  ➪  Start Dictation, or press 
the Fn key twice in rapid succession.
If your keyboard doesn’t have an Fn key, click the Shortcut pop-up menu in the 
Keyboard System Preferences pane to change the shortcut to one that works with 
your keyboard.
When you start Dictation, a little microphone icon appears. The white filling indi-
cates the level (relative loudness) of your voice. Try to keep the white near the 
middle — not too high and not too low, as shown in Figure 20-1.

CHAPTER 20  Features for the Way You Work     369
When you see the microphone icon, start speaking. 
After you dictate a few sentences, click Done and 
let your Mac catch up. When the words appear, you 
can start Dictation again. Repeat as necessary.
It might not be a bad idea to save your document 
after you speak a few sentences or paragraphs; if 
you don’t, the words you dictated since your last 
Save will be lost if the app or your Mac crashes.
You can insert punctuation by speaking its name, such as “period” or “comma.” 
You can also perform simple formatting by saying “new line” or “new paragraph” 
to add space between lines.
Here are a few more tips to help you get the best results when you dictate:
»
» Speak in a normal voice at a moderate volume level. Try to keep the white 
in the microphone icon about half-full (or half-empty if you’re a pessimist).
»
» Avoid background noise. If you expect to use dictation in a noisy environ-
ment or a room with a lot of ambient echo, you should consider using a 
headset microphone.
The headset that comes with iPhones and iPod touches is compatible with 
many Mac models.
»
» Be sure the microphone is not obstructed. Check your Mac’s User Guide for 
the location of your built-in microphone (if you have one).
»
» Be sure the input volume of an external microphone is sufficient. If 
you’re using an external microphone and the white meter doesn’t respond to 
your voice, select the microphone in the drop-down menu beneath the 
microphone in the Dictation tab of the Keyboard System Preferences pane.
Commanding your Mac by voice
Speech Recognition enables your Mac to recognize and respond to human speech. 
The only thing you need to use it is a microphone, which most of you have built 
right into your Mac (unless it’s a Mac Mini or Mac Pro as noted previously).
Speech Recognition lets you issue verbal commands such as “Get my mail!” to 
your Mac and have it actually get your email. You can also create AppleScripts and 
trigger them by voice.

370     PART 6  Care and Feeding
An AppleScript is a series of commands, using the AppleScript language, that tells 
the computer (and some applications) what to do. You find out a bit more about 
AppleScript later in this chapter.
In versions of macOS before Yosemite, you had to explicitly turn on Speech Recog-
nition; in High Sierra, if you’ve enabled Dictation, you can use speech commands 
to instruct your Mac.
To see a list of commands your Mac will understand if you speak them, open the 
Keyboard System Preferences pane, click the Dictation tab, and enable Enhanced 
Dictation. Now, open the Accessibility System Preferences pane, click Dictation 
in the list on the left, and then click the Dictation Commands button. A sheet 
appears, in which you can enable or disable the available dictation commands, as 
shown in Figure 20-2.
If you have a laptop or an iMac, you may get better results from just about any 
third-party microphone or headset with a microphone. The mic built into your 
Mac works okay, but it’s not great. To select a third-party microphone, first con-
nect the mic to your Mac. Then open the Sound System Preferences pane and 
select it from the list of sound input devices in the Input tab. Below the list is 
an input volume control (not available with some third-party mics) and a level 
meter, as shown in Figure 20-3. Adjust the Input Volume so that most of the dots 
in the Input Level meter darken (11 of 15 in Figure 20-3).
Speech Recognition is the same as Dictation; enable Dictation as I show you earlier 
in this section, and you’re good to go. To give it a try, press Fn twice (or what-
ever shortcut you set earlier) and speak one of the items from the list of Dictation 
Commands, such as “Open TextEdit.” If the command is recognized, it will appear 
in text above the microphone icon, as shown in Figure 20-4.

This technology is clever and kind of fun, but it can also be some-
what frustrating when it doesn’t recognize what you say, which is 
far too often, if you ask me. And it requires a decent microphone 
even though the mic built into most Macs works okay. The bottom 
line is that I’ve never been able to get Speech Recognition to work 
well enough to continue using it beyond a few minutes at best. Still, 
it’s kind of cool (and it’s a freebie), and I’ve heard more than one 
user profess love for it. Which is why it’s included here.
Listening to your Mac read for you
The camera pans back. A voice tells you what you’ve just seen. And 
suddenly it all makes sense. Return with me now to those thrilling 
days of the off-camera narrator . . . . Wouldn’t it be nice if your Mac had a narrator 
to provide a blow-by-blow account of what’s happening on your screen?
Or, your eyes are tired from a long day staring at the monitor, but you still have 
a lengthy document to read. Wouldn’t it be sweet if you could sit back, close your 
eyes, and let your Mac read the document to you in a (somewhat) natural voice? 
The good news is that both are possible with macOS High Sierra: the first scenario 
with VoiceOver, and the second with Text to Speech.
VoiceOver
High Sierra’s VoiceOver technology is designed primarily for the visually impaired, 
but you might find it useful even if your vision is 20/20. VoiceOver not only reads 
what’s on the screen to you but also integrates with your keyboard so you can 
navigate around the screen until you hear the item you’re looking for. When 
you’re there, you can use Keyboard Access to select list items, select check boxes 
FIGURE 20-3:

Recognition.

and radio buttons, move scroll bars and sliders, resize windows, and so on — all 
with just a simple key press or two.
To check it out, launch the System Preferences application (from Launchpad, the 
Applications folder, the  menu, or the dock), click the Accessibility icon and then 
click VoiceOver or press ⌘  +Fn+F5 on MacBook models and most Apple keyboards 
(or try ⌘  +F5).
After VoiceOver is enabled, you can turn it on and off in the Accessibility System 
Preferences pane or by pressing ⌘  +Fn+F5 or ⌘  +F5.
While VoiceOver is on, your Mac talks to you about what is on your screen. For 
example, if you click the desktop, your Mac might say something along the lines 
of “Application, Finder; Column View; selected folder, Desktop, contains 8 items.” 
It’s quite slick. Here’s another example: When you click a menu or item on a 
menu, you hear its name spoken at once, and when you close a menu, you hear 
the words “Closing menu.” You even hear the spoken feedback in the Print, Open, 
and Save (and other) dialogs.
VoiceOver is kind of cool (talking alerts are fun), but having dialogs actually 
produce spoken text becomes annoying fast for most folks who aren’t visually 
impaired. (Those who are visually impaired, however, rave about VoiceOver and 
say it lets them do things they couldn’t easily do in the past.) In any case, I urge 
you to check it out. You might like it and find times when you want your Mac to 
narrate the action onscreen for you.
The VoiceOver Utility
The VoiceOver Utility lets you specify almost every possible option the VoiceOver 
technology uses. You can adjust its verbosity; specify how it deals with your mouse 
and keyboard; change its voice, rate, pitch, and/or volume; and more.
You can open the VoiceOver Utility by clicking the Open VoiceOver Utility button in 
the Accessibility System Preferences pane or in the usual way: by double-clicking 
its icon (which you find in your Utilities folder).
Of course, you might get the machines-are-taking-over willies when your  
Mac starts to talk to you or make sounds — but if you give it a try, it could change 
your mind.
I wish I had the space to explain further, but I don’t. That’s the bad news. The 
good news is that VoiceOver Help is extensive and clear, and it helps you harness 
all the power of VoiceOver and the VoiceOver Utility.

CHAPTER 20  Features for the Way You Work     373
Text to Speech
The second way your Mac can speak to you is via Text to Speech, which converts 
onscreen text to spoken words. If you’ve used Text to Speech in earlier versions of 
macOS, you’ll find that it’s pretty much unchanged.
Why might you need Text to Speech? Because sometimes hearing is better than 
reading. For example, I sometimes use Text to Speech to read aloud to me a col-
umn or page I’ve written before I submit it. If something doesn’t sound quite 
right, I give it another polish before sending it off to my editor.
You can configure this feature in the Accessibility System Preferences pane:
1.	 Open System Preferences (from Launchpad or the Applications folder, 
dock, or  menu), click the Accessibility icon, and then click Speech in the 
list on the left.
2.	 In the System Voice pop-up menu, choose one of the voices to set the 
voice your Mac uses when it reads to you.
3.	 Click the Play button to hear a sample of the voice you selected.
4.	 Use the Speaking Rate slider to speed up or slow down the voice.
5.	 Click the Play button to hear the voice at its new speed.
I really like Alex, who says, “Most people recognize me by my voice.” My second 
favorite is Fred, who sounds like the Talking Moose and says, “I sure like being 
inside this fancy computer.”
6.	 (Optional) If you want to make your Mac speak the text in alert boxes 
and dialogs, select the Enable Announcements check box.
You might hear such alerts as “The application Microsoft Word has quit 
unexpectedly” or “Paper out or not loaded correctly.”
7.	 (Optional) Click the Options button to choose the voice and phrase used 
to announce your alerts — “Alert,” “Attention,” “Yo, dude,” and the 
like — when alerting you.
You can also set the delay between the time the alert appears and when it’s 
spoken to you.
8.	 (Optional) To create a hot key to speak selected text, select the Speak 
Selected Text When the Key Is Pressed check box.
The default keyboard shortcut is Option+Esc, but you can assign any key 
combo you like by clicking the Change Key button.

374     PART 6  Care and Feeding
Now, to use Text to Speech to read text to you, copy the text to the Clipboard, 
launch any app that supports it (I usually choose TextEdit or Pages), paste the 
text into the empty untitled document, click where you want your Mac to begin 
reading to you, and then choose Edit  ➪  Speech  ➪  Start Speaking. To make it stop, 
choose Edit  ➪  Speech  ➪  Stop Speaking.
Another great place Text to Speech is available is in the Safari web browser. It 
works the same as TextEdit but you don’t have to paste — just select the text you 
want to hear and choose Edit  ➪  Speech  ➪  Start Speaking.
If you don’t care for the sound of the default voice, choose a different one in the 
Accessibility System Preferences pane. First click Speech in the list on the left, 
and then choose a new voice from the System Voice drop-down menu or choose 
Customize to download additional voices.
Automatic Automation
macOS High Sierra offers a pair of technologies — AppleScript and Automator — 
that makes it easy to automate repetitive actions on your Mac.
AppleScript is “programming for the rest of us.” It can record and play back things 
that you do (if the application was written to allow the recording, such as Finder), 
such as opening an application or clicking a button. You can use it to record a 
script for tasks that you often perform, and then have your Mac perform those 
tasks for you later. You can write your own AppleScripts, use those that come with 
your Mac, or download still others from the web.
Automator is “programming without writing code.” With Automator, you string 
together prefabricated activities (actions) to automate repetitive or scheduled 
tasks. How cool is that?
Automation isn’t for everyone. Some users can’t live without it; others could go 
their whole lives without ever automating anything. So the following sections are 
designed to help you figure out how much  — or how little  — you care about 
AppleScript and Automator.
Script Editor app: Write and edit 
AppleScripts
Describing AppleScript to a Mac beginner is a bit like three blind men describing 
an elephant. One man might describe it as the Mac’s built-in automation tool. 

CHAPTER 20  Features for the Way You Work     375
Another might describe it as an interesting but often-overlooked piece of enabling 
technology. The third might liken it to a cassette recorder, recording and play-
ing back your actions at the keyboard. A fourth (if there were a fourth in the 
story) would assure you that it looked like computer code written in a high-level 
language.
They would all be correct. AppleScript, a built-in Mac automation tool, is a little- 
known (at least until recently) enabling technology that works like a cassette 
recorder for programs that support AppleScript recording. And scripts do look 
like computer programs. (Could that be because they are computer programs? 
Hmm . . . .)
If you’re the kind of person who likes to automate as many things as possible, 
you might just love AppleScript because it’s a simple programming language you 
can use to create programs that give instructions to your Mac and the applications 
running on your Mac. For example, you can create an AppleScript that launches 
Mail, checks for new messages, and then quits Mail. The script could even trans-
fer your mail to a folder of your choice. Then there’s Automator, which includes a 
whole lot of preprogrammed actions that make a task like the one just described 
even easier.
I call AppleScript a time-and-effort enhancer. If you just spend the time and 
effort it takes to understand it, using AppleScript can save you oodles of time and 
effort down the road. Therein lies the rub. This stuff is far from simple; entire 
books have been written on the subject. So it’s far beyond the purview of macOS 
High Sierra For Dummies. Still, it’s worth finding out about if you’d like to script 
repetitive actions for future use. To get you started, here are a few quick tips:
»
» Script Editor (in the Utilities folder in the Applications folder) is the 
application you use to view and edit AppleScripts. Although more 
information on Script Editor is beyond the scope of this book, it’s a lot of fun. 
And the cool thing is that you can create many AppleScripts without knowing a 
thing about programming. Just record a series of actions you want to repeat 
and use Script Editor to save what you recorded as a script. If you save your 
script as an application (by choosing Format  ➪  Application in the Save sheet), 
you can run that script by double-clicking its icon.
»
» You can put frequently used AppleScripts in the dock or on your desktop 
for easy access.
»
» Many AppleScripts are designed for use in the toolbar of Finder win-
dows, where you can drag and drop items onto them quickly and easily.
»
» Scripts can enhance your use of many apps including iTunes, iPhoto, and 
Finder, to name a few.

376     PART 6  Care and Feeding
»
» Apple provides a script menu extra that you can install on your menu 
bar in the Script Editor’s Preferences window, along with a number of  
free scripts to automate common tasks (in the Scripts folder in the root-level 
Library, or choose Open Example Scripts Folder from the Script Editor’s  
Help menu).
»
» If the concept of scripting intrigues you, I suggest that you explore the 
examples in the Scripts folder (in the root-level Library or choose Open 
Example Scripts from the Script Editor’s Help menu). Rummage through 
this folder and when you find a script that looks interesting, double-click it to 
launch the Script Editor program, where you can examine it more closely.
Automator app: Automate almost anything
Automator does just what you’d expect: It enables you to automate many common 
tasks on your Mac. If it sounds a little like AppleScript to you (which I discuss in 
the preceding section), you’re not mistaken; the two have a common goal. But this 
tool is a lot simpler to use, albeit somewhat less flexible, than AppleScript.
For example, in AppleScript, you can have conditionals (“if this is true, do that; 
otherwise do something else”), but Automator is purely sequential (“take this, do 
that, then do the next thing, and then . . .”).
The big difference is that conditionals allow AppleScripts to take actions involv-
ing decision-making and iteration (“while this is true, do these things”); Automator 
workflows can’t make decisions or iterate.
The upsides to Automator are that you don’t have to know anything about pro-
gramming, and you don’t have to type any archaic code. Instead, if you under-
stand the process you want to automate, you can just drag and drop Automator’s 
prefab actions into place and build a workflow (Automator’s name for a series of 
actions).
You do need to know one thing about programming (or computers), though: Com-
puters are stupid! You heard me right — even my top-of-the-line MacBook Pro is 
dumb as a post. Computers do only what you tell them to do even though they can 
do it faster and more precisely than you can. But all computers run on the GIGO 
principle (Garbage In, Garbage Out), so if your instructions are flawed, you’re 
almost certain to get flawed results.
When you launch the Automator application, click the New Document button and 
the window and sheet shown in Figure 20-5 appear. Choose one of the starting 
points if you want Automator to assist you in constructing a new workflow; or, 
choose Workflow to start building a workflow from scratch.

CHAPTER 20  Features for the Way You Work     377
I’m going to choose Service for the sake of this demonstration (you’ll see why in 
a second). When I select Service and click the Choose button, I see the window 
shown in Figure 20-6.
The Library pane on the far left contains all the applications Automator knows 
about that have Actions defined for them. Select an application in the top part 
of the Library window, and its related actions appear below it. When you select 
an action, the pane at the bottom of the Library window (Text to Audio File in 
Figure  20-6) explains what that Action does, what input it expects, and what 
FIGURE 20-5:

FIGURE 20-6:

text that I

378     PART 6  Care and Feeding
result it produces. Just drag Actions from the Action list into the window on the 
right to build your workflow.
This particular Service, which took me less than five minutes of trial and error to 
perfect, is quite useful. First, I select text from any source — a web page, Micro-
soft Word document, email message, or whatever. Then I choose Services from 
the Application menu or right- or Control-click and select my newly created Text 
to Audio Service from the Services menu. My Automator workflow then converts 
the selected text into an audio file and saves it to the desktop. Then, I can have it 
read to me in iTunes at home or on my iPhone or iPad in the car, on a plane, or 
just about anywhere. Sweet!
Automator is a very useful addition to macOS; it’s deep, powerful, and expand-
able, yet relatively easy to use and master. Do yourself a favor, and spend some 
time experimenting with ways Automator can save you time and keystrokes. You 
won’t regret it.
For additional information about AppleScript, Automator, Services, and much 
more, visit www.macosxautomation.com.
A Few More Useful Goodies
Even more neat and useful technologies are built into High Sierra, but I’m run-
ning out of space. So here are, at least in my humble opinion, the best of the rest.
App Store app: The place to buy Mac apps
The App Store app is the macOS software version of the iTunes Store for media 
and iOS apps. Here, you’ll find applications of all types — Business, Entertain-
ment, Graphics, Productivity, Social Networking, and more — at prices that start 
at zero (free).
Just about everything I tell you in Chapter 16 about the iTunes Store could be said 
for the App Store. It looks and works the same, and it uses the same credit card 
you have on file at the iTunes Store.
If you see a little number on the App Store icon in your dock, it means that a 
number of your apps have updates available. Launch the App Store app and click 
the Updates tab to see the apps with updates awaiting them. Even if you don’t see 
a little number in the App Store’s dock icon, it wouldn’t hurt to launch the App 
Store every once in a while to check for updates manually, as the little number 
sometimes fails to appear in the App Store dock icon.

CHAPTER 20  Features for the Way You Work     379
Accessibility System Preferences pane: 
Make your Mac more accessible
If you’ve read the chapter to this point, you got a brief glimpse of the Accessibility 
System Preferences pane when I discussed commanding your Mac by voice. But 
this System Preferences pane is mostly designed for users with disabilities or who 
have difficulty handling the keyboard, mouse, or trackpad.
Select the Show Accessibility Status in Menu Bar check box at the bottom of  
the window on the left to see the status of all Accessibility Preferences in your 
menu bar.
The pane has five sections listed on the left — General, Vision, Media, Hearing, 
and Interacting — each of which has one or more subsections.
The Vision section’s Display subsection lets you alter the behavior of the screen 
display. Select the Use Grayscale check box to desaturate your screen into a gray-
scale display (so it looks kind of like a black-and-white TV). Enable the Invert 
Colors option to reverse what you’d see onscreen. For example in the real world 
you know what the Accessibility System Preferences pane looks like; Figure 20-7 
is what it looks like onscreen with Invert Colors enabled.
Enable the Shake Mouse Pointer to Locate check box and the pointer will grow 
much larger and easier to see when you wiggle the mouse back and forth quickly 
a couple of times.
The Vision section’s Zoom subsection is where you can turn on a terrific fea-
ture called hardware zoom, which lets you make things on your screen bigger by 
FIGURE 20-7: 
The

System 
Preferences 
pane with its 
colors inverted.

380     PART 6  Care and Feeding
zooming in on them. To control it by keyboard, select the Use Keyboard Short-
cuts to Zoom check box. Then you can toggle it on and off with the shortcut 
⌘  +Option+8 and zoom in and out using the shortcuts ⌘  +Option+= (equal sign) 
and ⌘  +Option+– (hyphen), respectively. Finally, the More Options button lets you 
specify minimum and maximum zoom levels, display a preview rectangle when 
zoomed out, and toggle image smoothing on or off.
Try this feature even if you’re not disabled or challenged in any way; it’s actually 
a great feature for everyone.
You looked at the Vision section’s VoiceOver subsection earlier in the chapter.
I leave it to you, gentle reader, to explore the remaining sections and subsections 
of the Accessibility System Preferences pane at your leisure. Until then, you might 
find the following useful:
»
» If you want the screen to flash whenever an alert sound occurs, 
choose Audio.
»
» To treat a sequence of modifier keys as a key combination, choose 
Keyboard and then enable Sticky Keys.
In other words, you don’t have to simultaneously hold down ⌘   while pressing 
another key. For example, with Sticky Keys enabled, you can do a standard 
keyboard shortcut by pressing ⌘  , releasing it, and then pressing the other 
key. You can select check boxes to tell you (with a beep and/or an onscreen 
display) what modifier keys have been pressed.
As useful as Sticky Keys can be, they’re really awkward in applications like 
Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and other applications that toggle a tool’s 
state when you press a modifier key. So if you’re a big Photoshop user, you 
probably don’t want Sticky Keys enabled.
»
» To adjust the delay between a keypress and its activation, choose 
Keyboard and then enable Slow Keys.
Energy Saver System Preferences pane: 
For energy conservation and sleep
All Macs are Energy Star–compliant (and have been for years), allowing you to 
preset your machine to turn itself off at a specific time or after a specified idle 
period. To manage your Mac’s energy-saving features, open the Energy Saver 
System Preferences pane by choosing 
  ➪  System Preferences and clicking the 
Energy Saver icon.

CHAPTER 20  Features for the Way You Work     381
If you have a notebook computer, you have two mostly identical tabs — Battery 
and Power Adapter — in your Energy Saver System Preferences pane. The Battery 
tab controls your notebook Mac’s behavior when it’s running on battery power 
(not plugged in); the Power Adapter tab controls its behavior when it is plugged in.
If you have a desktop Mac, you won’t have tabs, but you do have most of the same 
controls, including a pair of sliders that control sleep times for your computer 
and display. To enable Computer or Display sleep, move the appropriate slider to 
the desired amount of time. You can choose any number between 1 minute and  
3 hours or turn off either type of sleep entirely by moving its slider all the way to 
the right, to Never.
Setting the display to sleep is handy if you want your Mac to keep doing what it’s 
doing but you don’t need to use the monitor. And if you’re a notebook user, Dis-
play Sleep will save you battery power.
To wake up your Mac from its sleep, merely move your mouse or press any key. 
Sometimes moving the mouse or a finger on the trackpad won’t wake a sleeping 
Mac, but a keystroke will. So try both (or all three) before you give up.
Below the Sleep sliders are some check boxes for other useful energy settings, 
such as the following:
»
» Put the Hard Disk(s) to Sleep When Possible: Enabling this option forces 
your hard drive to sleep after a few minutes of inactivity. It’s not a particularly 
useful feature on a desktop Mac, but if you have a laptop, letting your hard 
drive sleep when it’s idle will save you some battery power.
»
» Wake for Wi-Fi Network Access: Enable this option if you want your Mac to 
wake up automatically for Wi-Fi network access.
If you have a laptop, you’ll have some additional options, including
»
» Slightly Dim the Display While on Battery Power (Battery tab): The display 
dims slightly and uses less power when running on the battery.
»
» Enable Power Nap while on Battery Power (Battery tab): This option 
allows your Mac to check for new email, calendar, and other iCloud updates 
while it’s sleeping.
»
» Enable Power Nap While Plugged into a Power Adapter (Power Adapter 
tab): This option allows your Mac to back up to Time Machine as well as check 
for new email, calendar, and other iCloud updates while it’s sleeping.

382     PART 6  Care and Feeding
»
» Prevent Computer from Sleeping Automatically When the Display Is Off 
(Power Adapter tab): Prevents sleep when the lid is closed and the display 
is off.
»
» Show Battery Status in the Menu Bar: This option adds a little battery-
status indicator icon and menu.
Finally, to start up, shut down, or put your Mac to sleep at a predetermined time, 
click the Schedule button and then select the appropriate check box and choose 
the appropriate options from the pop-up menus.
Bluetooth System Preferences pane: 
Where Bluetooth lives
Bluetooth is wireless networking for low-bandwidth peripherals, including mice, 
keyboards, and mobile phones. If your Mac has Bluetooth built in or is equipped 
with a USB Bluetooth adapter, you can synchronize wirelessly with phones and 
Palm devices, print wirelessly to Bluetooth printers, and use Bluetooth headsets, 
mice, and keyboards.
To manage your Mac’s Bluetooth features, open the Bluetooth System Preferences 
pane by choosing   ➪  System Preferences and clicking the Bluetooth icon.
Ink System Preferences pane: Visible 
to pen-input tablet users only
Ink is the macOS built-in handwriting-recognition engine. Sadly, it works only if 
a third-party drawing tablet with a stylus is connected. Even more sadly, “tablet” 
in this sense doesn’t include your iPad (at least not so far . . .).
To write instead of typing, enable Ink in this pane and you’ll be able to handwrite 
anywhere your Mac accepts typing with the keyboard.
To manage your Mac’s Ink features, open the Ink System Preferences pane by 
choosing   ➪  System Preferences and clicking the Ink icon.
The Ink pane is one you see only if you have one of the pen-input drawing tablets 
that Ink supports connected to your Mac. Most of the supported drawing tablets 
come from Wacom (www.wacom.com), with prices starting under $100 for a small 
wireless stylus and drawing tablet.

Automatic Login in the Users & Groups 
System Preferences pane: Don’t bother 
with the login screen
Some users don’t care for the fact that macOS High Sierra is a multiuser operating 
system and dislike having to log in when they start up their Mac. For those users, 
here’s a way to disable the login screen:
1.	 Open the Users & Groups System Preferences pane, select yourself in the 
list of users, and click the Login Options button below the list.
Click the lock and provide your password first, if necessary.
2.	 Choose the account you want to be logged in to automatically from the 
Automatic Login pop-up menu.
To disable the logging-in requirement, you have to be an administrator, and 
you may need to unlock the Users & Groups System Preferences pane.
When you disable logging in, you also affect all the preferences set by other people 
who use your Mac unless they log out of your account and log into theirs. (Yikes.) 
So if your Desktop pattern, keyboard settings, and so forth are different from 
those of someone else who uses your Mac, those preferences won’t be properly 
reflected unless each of you has a separate, individual login account. Even if you’re 
not worried about security, consider keeping logging in enabled if any other users 
have accounts on your machine, or if you don’t want just anyone to be able to turn 
on your Mac and see your personal stuff.
Note that only one account is allowed to use auto-login. If another user wants to 
use this Mac, you need to choose   ➪  Log Out, press ⌘  +Shift+Q, or have Fast User 
Switching enabled. And if you’ve disabled automatic login in the Security System 
Preferences pane, you can’t enable it here.
Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac
macOS Sierra was the first release that lets you unlock your Mac by merely wear-
ing your Apple Watch. To turn it on, enable the Allow Your Apple Watch to Unlock 
Your Mac check box in the Security & Privacy System Preferences pane’s General 
tab. Then just walk up to your Mac while wearing your unlocked Apple Watch, and 
you’ll be automatically logged into your user account in a jiffy.
I use it a million times a day and it is sweet!
One last thing: If you don’t see the Allow Your Apple Watch to Unlock Your Mac 
check box in the Security & Privacy System Preferences pane’s General tab, your 
Mac may be too old to support this feature.

Boot Camp Assistant app: Run Windows 
on your Mac . . . really
Boot Camp is High Sierra’s built-in technology that allows you to run Microsoft 
Windows 10 and (on some Mac models) Windows 7 or 8 on High Sierra–capable 
Macs. If your Mac meets the following requirements, you can run Windows on 
your Mac (if you so desire):
»
» An High Sierra–capable Mac (of course)
»
» A hard drive that isn’t already partitioned
»
» (Optional) A printer (for printing the instructions)
It’s optional ‘cause you could just email them to yourself . . . .
»
» A full install copy of Microsoft Windows 7 or newer (Windows 8 Home 
Premium, Professional, or Ultimate edition or Windows 10)
You really do need a full retail copy of Windows: one that was purchased in a retail 
box. If your copy of Windows came with your PC, you probably can’t install it in 
Boot Camp.
To install Windows on your Mac, here are the basic steps:
1.	 Launch the Boot Camp Assistant application, which is in your Utilities folder.
This step creates a partition on your hard drive for your Windows installation.
2.	 Install Windows on the new partition.
From now on, you can hold down Option during startup and choose to start up 
from either the macOS High Sierra disk partition or the new Windows partition.
If running Windows on your Mac appeals to you, you may want to check out Par-
allels Desktop (around $80) or VirtualBox (free). Both programs allow you to run 
Windows — even older versions like XP and Vista — as well as Linux on your 
Mac without partitioning your hard drive or restarting every time you want to use 
Windows. In fact, you can run Mac and Windows programs simultaneously with 
these products.
One last thing: Apple has a special Boot Camp support page on the web at http://
www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/.
AirPlay mirroring
I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the AirPlay Mirroring feature, even though 
most of you won’t be able to use it without first buying an Apple TV.

CHAPTER 20  Features for the Way You Work     385
With AirPlay Mirroring, you can stream whatever is on your Mac (or iOS device) 
screen wirelessly to your HDTV with a connected Apple TV.
Apple TV couldn’t be easier to use. If it’s on the same network as your Mac, an 
option for AirPlay Mirroring will appear in the Displays System Preferences pane. 
Just enable AirPlay Mirroring, and what is on your Mac screen will appear on your 
HDTV screen almost instantaneously.
Enable Show Mirroring Options in the Menu Bar 
When Available in the Displays System Preferences 
pane, and a handy menu, shown in Figure  20-8, 
lets you switch AirPlay Mirroring on and off with-
out the bother of first opening the Displays System 
Preferences pane.
The bad news is that many older Macs — including 
my wife’s six-year-old MacBook Pro — don’t sup-
port mirroring to an Apple TV.
Handoff
I’d be remiss if I didn’t at least mention the Handoff feature, which lets you start 
working on a document, an email, or a message on any Apple device and pick up 
where you left off on another device. To enable it, open System Preferences, click 
the General icon, and enable the check box to Allow Handoff between This Mac 
and Your iCloud Devices.
Now make sure that you’re signed into iCloud with the same Apple ID on your Mac 
and iOS device(s) and that Bluetooth is enabled on all devices.
Handoff works with Apple apps, including Mail, 
Safari, Maps, Messages, Reminders, Calendar, 
Contacts, Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, as well 
as a handful of third-party apps. When another 
Handoff-enabled device is nearby and using one of 
these apps, you’ll see an icon floating on the far-
left side of the dock, as shown in Figure 20-9.
If I click the Messages dock icon, Messages (on my 
Mac) displays the same message or reply that’s on 
my iPhone.

Safety First: Backups and 
Other Security Issues
A
lthough Macs are generally reliable beasts (especially Macs running macOS), 
someday your hard drive (or SSD) will die. I promise. They all do someday. 
And if you don’t back up your drive (or at least back up any files that you can’t 
afford to lose) before that day comes, chances are good those files are gone forever.
In other words, you absolutely, positively, without question must back up your files 
if you don’t want to risk losing them. Just as you adopt the Shut Down command 
and make it a habit before turning off your machine, you must remember to back up 
important files on your hard drive to another disk or device — and back them up often.
How often is often? That depends on you. How much work can you afford to lose? 
If your answer is that losing everything you did yesterday would put you out of 
business, you need to back up hourly or perhaps even continuously. If you would 
lose only a few unimportant documents if your hard drive died today, you can 
probably back up less frequently.
Following the comprehensive coverage of backup options, I explain the possible 
threat to your data from viruses and other icky things, as well as how you can 
protect against them.

Finally, I cover what you can do to keep other people from looking at your stuff.
One last thing: If you turn on FileVault (described later in this chapter) and forget 
both your login password and your master password, your data is lost forever. 
Really. Not even DriveSavers or Apple can recover it, so don’t forget those pass-
words, okay?
Backing Up Is (Not) Hard to Do
You can back up your hard drive in basically three ways: the super-painless way 
with High Sierra’s excellent Time Machine, the ugly way using the brute-force 
method, or the comprehensive way with specialized third-party backup and disk-
cloning software. Read on and find out more about all three.
Backing up with High Sierra’s excellent 
Time Machine
Time Machine is a most excellent backup system that was introduced with macOS 
Leopard — and has only become better. I say it’s a system because it consists of 
two parts: the Time Machine System Preferences pane, shown in Figure 21-1, and 
the Time Machine application, shown in Figure 21-2.
To use Time Machine to back up your data automatically, the first thing you need 
is another hard drive that’s larger than your startup disk. The hard drive can be an 
external FireWire, USB 2 or USB 3, or Thunderbolt hard drive, an SSD (if you can 
D’OH!
And if you do see them again, my friend, it will be only after paying someone such as 
DriveSavers Data Recovery Service. And even if you pay, there’s no guarantee of success.
DriveSavers is the premier recoverer of lost data on hard drives. The people there under-
stand Mac hard drives quite well, do excellent work, and can often recover stuff that 
nobody else could. (Ask the producers of The Simpsons about the almost-lost episodes.) 
Understandably, DriveSavers charges accordingly.
If you aren’t going to back up your data, here are the phone numbers for DriveSavers: 
800-440-1904 toll-free and 415-382-2000. You’ll probably need them someday (along 
with a bucketful of cash) if you refuse to believe that you must back up and back up often.

CHAPTER 21  Safety First: Backups and Other Security Issues     389
afford to use a solid-state drive for backups), or even another internal hard drive, 
if your Mac is a Mac mini or an older Mac Pro.
Another option is Apple Time Capsule, which is a device that combines an AirPort 
Extreme wireless base station with a large hard drive so you can automatically 
back up one or more Macs over a wired or wireless network.
Moving right along, the first time a 
new disk suitable for use with Time 
Machine is connected to your Mac, 
a dialog pops up and asks whether 
you want to use that disk to back 
up with Time Machine, as shown in 
Figure 21-3.
FIGURE 21-1:

FIGURE 21-3: 
What you see when you plug in a new disk  
suitable for use with Time Machine.

390     PART 6  Care and Feeding
If you say yes, the Time Machine System Preferences pane opens automatically, 
showing the new disk already chosen as the backup disk.
If that doesn’t happen or you want to use an already connected hard drive with 
Time Machine, open the Time Machine System Preferences pane and click the 
big On/Off switch to On. Now click the Select Disk button and select the hard 
drive you want to use for your backups. Mine is called Time Machine Disk 2017 in 
Figure 21-1.
The only other consideration is this: If you have other hard drives connected to 
your Mac, you should click the Options button to reveal the Exclude These Items 
from Backups list, which tells Time Machine which volumes (disks) or folders not 
to back up. To add a volume or folder to this exclusion list, click the little + button; 
to remove a volume from the list, select the volume and then click the – button.
The Options sheet also has a check box for notifying you when old backups are 
deleted; select it if you want to be notified. And if your Mac is a laptop, a second 
check box governs whether Time Machine backs up your Mac when it’s on battery 
power.
For the record, Time Machine stores your backups for the following lengths of 
time:
»
» Hourly backups for the past 24 hours
»
» Daily backups for the past month
»
» Weekly backups until your backup disk is full
When your backup disk gets full, the oldest backups on it are deleted and replaced 
by the newest.
That’s why you should always buy the biggest drive you can afford to use as your 
backup disk; otherwise Time Machine will be deleting backups all the time rather 
than archiving them for future use.
When does Time Machine run? Glad you asked! It runs approximately once per 
hour. If it gets stuck and forgets to run for any reason, use the Backup Now com-
mand in the Time Machine menu to get it going again.
If you enable and set up Time Machine as I just described, you’ll never forget to 
back up your stuff, so just do it.

CHAPTER 21  Safety First: Backups and Other Security Issues     391
What does Time Machine back up?
Time Machine backs up your entire hard drive the first time it runs and then backs up 
files and folders that have been modified since your last backup. That’s what backup 
systems do. But Time Machine does more — it also backs up things such as contacts 
in your Contacts, pictures in your Photos library, events in your calendars, and emails 
in your Mail, not to mention its support of versions and locking. About the only thing 
Time Machine doesn’t back up is the content of Home folders other than your own.
Those features — sweet ones, indeed — make Time Machine unlike any other 
backup system.
How do I restore a file (or a contact,  
a photo, an event, and so on)?
To restore a file or any other information, follow these steps:
1.	 Launch the appropriate program — the one that contains the informa-
tion you want to restore.
If you want to restore a file, that program is Finder, which (as you know) is 
always running. So to restore an individual file, you don’t need to launch 
anything; just switch to Finder if it’s not the active application. But to restore a 
contact, a photo, an email message, or an event, for example, you need to 
launch Contacts, Photos, Mail, or Calendar, respectively.
2.	 With the appropriate application running (or the appropriate Finder 
window open), launch the Time Machine application, as shown in 
Figure 21-2.
If you selected the Show Time Machine in Menu Bar check box in the Time 
Machine System Preferences pane (as shown in Figure 21-1), you can choose 
Enter Time Machine from the Time Machine menu (also shown in Figure 21-1).
It will be easier to restore a file in Finder if the folder that the file is in (or was in) 
is the active folder (that is, open and frontmost) when you launch the Time 
Machine application. Otherwise, you have to navigate to the appropriate folder 
before you can perform Step 3.
3.	 Click one of the bars with dates near the lower-right corner of the screen 
or click the big Forward or Back arrow on the right of the Documents 
window in Figure 21-2 to choose the backup you want to restore from 
(Yesterday at 6:59 PM in Figure 21-2).
4.	 Select the file, folder, Contacts contact, Photos photo, email message, or 
Calendar event you want to restore.
5.	 Click the Restore button below the window.

392     PART 6  Care and Feeding
If the file, folder, Contacts contact, 
Photos photo, email message, or Cal-
endar event exists in the same loca-
tion today, Time Machine politely 
inquires as to your wishes, as shown 
in Figure 21-4.
Don’t forget that you can use the 
search field in the Documents window, as shown in Figure 21-2, to find files or 
folders in Time Machine.
Backing up by using the manual,  
brute-force method
If you’re too cheap to buy a second hard drive, the most rudimentary way to back 
up is to do it manually. You accomplish this by dragging said files a few at a time 
to another volume — usually a DVD-R, DVD-RW, or USB flash drive. (If you use 
an optical disc, don’t forget to actually burn the disc; merely dragging those files 
onto the optical disc icon won’t do the trick.) By using this method, you’re making 
a copy of each file that you want to protect.
Yuck! If doing a manual backup sounds pretty awful, trust me — it is. This method 
can take a long, long time, you can’t really tell whether you copied every file that 
needs to be backed up, and you can’t really copy only the files that have been 
modified since your last backup. Almost nobody in his right mind sticks with this 
method for long.
Note that optical media is slow and costly and USB flash drives are not much 
better. It would behoove you to spend a few more dollars and purchase a higher-
capacity device such as an external hard drive. But if you do, why wouldn’t you use 
it with Time Machine and forget about the inefficient brute-force method?
Of course, if you’re careful to save files only in your Documents folder, as I suggest 
several times in this book, you can probably get away with backing up only that. 
Or if you save files in other folders within your Home folder or have any files in 
your Movies, Music, Pictures, or Sites folders (which often contain files you didn’t 
specifically save in those folders, such as your Photos pictures and iTunes songs), 
you should probably consider backing up your entire Home folder.
As you read in the following section, backing up your Home folder is even easier if 
you use special backup software.
FIGURE 21-4: 
Time Machine asks what to do with the file 
you’re restoring.

CHAPTER 21  Safety First: Backups and Other Security Issues     393
Backing up by using commercial  
backup software
Another way to back up your files is with a third-party backup program. Backup 
software automates the task of backing up, remembering what’s on each backup 
disc (if your backup uses more than one disc), and backing up only files that have 
been modified since your last backup.
Furthermore, you can instruct your backup software to back up only a certain 
folder (Home or Documents) and to ignore the hundreds of megabytes of stuff 
that make up macOS, all of which you can easily reinstall from your recovery disk 
or the Mac App Store.
Your first backup with commercial software might take anywhere from a few min-
utes to several hours and use one or more optical discs (CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, 
DVD-RW, magneto-optical disc) or non-optical media (such as another hard drive 
or any kind of tape). Subsequent backups, incremental backups in backup software 
parlance, should take only a few minutes.
If you do incremental backups with optical discs, be sure to label and number all 
the discs you use during that operation. Your backup software may prompt you 
with a message such as Please insert backup disk 7. If you haven’t labeled your media 
clearly, you could have a problem figuring out which disc is disc 7 or which disc 7 
belongs to that particular backup set.
One of the best things about good backup software is that you can set it up to 
automate your backups and perform them even if you forget. And although Time 
Machine is a step in the right direction and might be sufficient for your needs, it’s 
not good enough for me. I use a total of five hard drives for backups.
Why You Need Two Sets of Backups
You’re a good soldier. You listened to Dr. Mac and you back up regularly. You think 
you’re immune to file loss or damage.
Now picture yourself in the following scenario:
»
» You leave the office one day for lunch. When you return, you discover that 
your office has been burglarized, struck by lightning, flooded, burned to the 
ground, or buried in earthquake rubble — take your pick.

394     PART 6  Care and Feeding
»
» Alas, although you did have a backup, the backup disk was right next to your 
Mac, which means it was either stolen or destroyed along with your Mac and 
everything else.
This scenario is totally unlikely — but it could happen, and it does demonstrate 
why you need multiple backups. If you have several sets of backup disks, and don’t 
keep them all in the same room as your Mac, chances are pretty good that one of 
the sets will work even if the others are lost, stolen, or destroyed.
Non-Backup Security Concerns
As you probably surmised by now, backing up your files is critical unless you 
don’t mind losing all your data someday. And although backing up is by far your 
most important security concern, several other things could imperil your data — 
things such as viruses or other types of malware, including worms, spyware, and 
intruder attacks. That’s the bad news. The good news is that all those things are 
far more likely to affect Windows users than Mac users. In fact, I’d venture to say 
that viruses, worms, malware, spyware, and intruder attacks are rarer than hens’ 
teeth for Mac users.
That said, here are a few precautions Mac users should consider, just in case.
About viruses and other malware
A computer virus is a nasty little piece of computer code that replicates and spreads 
from disk to disk. A virus could cause your Mac to misbehave; some viruses can 
destroy files or erase disks with no warning.
Malware (short for malicious software) is software that’s hostile, intrusive,  
annoying, or disruptive. Malware is often designed to gain unauthorized access 
to your computer or collect personal data (including passwords) without your 
knowledge or both.
The difference between a virus and other types of malware is that malware doesn’t 
spread by itself. It relies upon trickery, mimicry, and social engineering to induce 
unsuspecting users to open a malicious file or install a malicious program. So a 
virus is a type of malware, but not all malware is viral.
You don’t hear much about viruses on the Mac because there have been few  
(if any) since the dawn of the Mac operating system (so many big cats and Califor-
nia landmarks ago). Almost all viruses are specific to an operating system — Mac 

CHAPTER 21  Safety First: Backups and Other Security Issues     395
viruses won’t affect Windows users, Windows viruses won’t affect Mac users, 
and so forth. And the vast majority of known viruses affect only (you guessed it) 
Windows.
The one real exception here is a “gift” from the wonderful world of Microsoft 
Office (Word and Excel, for example) users: the dreaded macro viruses that are 
spread with Word and Excel documents containing macros written in the Micro-
soft VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) language. But you’re safe even from those 
if you practice safe computing as I describe (although you can unknowingly pass 
them along to Windows users).
Much of the viral activity affecting the Mac operating system involved various 
Windows macro viruses. Sadly, a very real threat known as Flashback appeared 
in early 2012. It exploited a security flaw in Java and stealthily installed itself on 
Macs. Soon after its discovery, Apple issued software updates for the Mac operat-
ing system that removed the malware and corrected the security flaw. Numerous 
similar instances have occurred since then, but in every case Apple has patched 
the operating system before many (or any) users were affected (or infected).
By default, your Mac automatically checks for software updates every week, but 
you can change that setting in the Software Update System Preferences pane. Click 
the Check Now button to run Software Update manually and check for the latest 
updates. The moral of the story is that it’s usually a good idea to install Apple 
updates sooner rather than later.
Although few truly viral Mac operating system threats have been spotted in the 
wild so far, most malware is spread via social engineering, which is easy to protect 
yourself against; here’s how:
»
» In Safari Preferences, Disable Open Safe Files after Downloading.
»
» If a suspicious alert or window appears on your screen, Force Quit your web 
browser (  ➪  Force Quit or ⌘  +Option+Esc) immediately.
»
» If the macOS Installer launches for no apparent reason, do not click Continue! 
Don’t install the software, and for heaven’s sake, don’t type your administrator 
password.
»
» And by all means read the section on High Sierra’s Gatekeeper later in this 
chapter for details on the three different levels of protection it can offer.
»
» Don’t run any installer — the kind built into macOS or the third-party  
kind — unless you’re absolutely certain that it came from a trusted source.
»
» Don’t use credit or debit cards with unfamiliar vendors or nonsecure websites. 
(For example, if you don’t see https instead of http, or you don’t see a little 
lock icon in the address field of your browser, the site may not be secure.)

396     PART 6  Care and Feeding
If you use disks that have been inserted into other computers, you need some 
form of virus-detection software. If you download and use files from web and  
File Transfer Protocol (FTP) sites on the Internet, you need some form of virus 
detection as well.
You don’t have too much to worry about if
»
» You download files only from commercial online services, such as AOL, CNET, 
or MacUpdate, which are all conscientious about malware.
»
» You buy software only from the Apple Mac App Store.
»
» You use only commercial software, and never download files from websites 
with strange names.
You should definitely worry about malicious infection if
»
» An unsavory friend told you about a website called Dan’sDenOfPiratedIllegalSt
olenBootlegSoftware.com, and you actually visited it.
»
» You swap disks or USB thumb drives with friends regularly.
»
» You shuttle disks or USB thumb drives back and forth to other Macs.
»
» You use your disks or USB thumb drives at public computers, photo-printing 
machines, or other computers likely to have had exposure to many disks.
»
» You download files from various and sundry places on the Internet, even  
ones that don’t sound as slimy as Dan’sDenOfPiratedIllegalStolenBootlegSoft
ware.com.
»
» You receive email with attachments (and open them). Note that you can 
receive malicious software in messages that look like they’re from people you 
know and trust. It’s called spoofing and it’s easily accomplished, so think 
carefully before opening an attachment and contact the sender if you have 
any doubt about the message’s authenticity.
If you’re at risk, do yourself a favor and buy a commercial antivirus program. I’m 
not quite ready to install antivirus software myself; I find that they are obtrusive 
and slow my Mac.
If you decide to do as I do and not as I just suggested, I urge you to visit some 
of or all the websites in Chapter 25 regularly. If nothing else, you’ll get advance 
warning the next time a particularly heinous piece of Mac malware is on the loose. 
I don’t know about you, but I’ll wait until then to reassess my position on this 
antivirus conundrum.

CHAPTER 21  Safety First: Backups and Other Security Issues     397
Firewall: Yea or nay?
According to the macOS built-in Oxford American Dictionary, a firewall is
Part of a computer system or network that is designed to block unauthorized 
access while permitting outward communication.
Using a firewall protects your computer from malicious users on other networks 
or the Internet and keeps them from gaining access to your Mac.
Unlike older versions of Windows, macOS is difficult to crack. There have been few 
(if any) reports of outsiders gaining access to Mac computers running macOS. One 
reason might be that macOS has a built-in firewall. That’s the good news. The 
bad news is that the firewall is disabled by default, so you’ll need to activate it if 
you want to be protected against unauthorized network access to your computer.
If you use a router with its own firewall (and the router’s firewall is enabled), do 
not also activate the High Sierra firewall. Running multiple firewalls can cause seri-
ous network issues.
To activate macOS’s firewall, follow these steps:
1.	 Open the System Preferences application (from the Applications folder,  
 menu, Launchpad, or dock).
2.	 Click the Security & Privacy icon and then click the Firewall tab.
If the lock in the bottom-left corner of the Security & Privacy pane is locked  
(as it should be), click it, and provide your administrator account name and 
password.
The default setting is Allow All Incoming Connections, which is the least-secure 
option.
3.	 To turn on the firewall, if it’s not already running, click the Turn On 
Firewall button.
4.	 To configure your firewall’s settings, click the Firewall Options button.
5.	 For the highest level of protection, select the Block All Incoming 
Connections check box.
6.	 Click OK.
Alas, you probably won’t want to keep this setting for long because you won’t be 
able to use awesome macOS features such as Messages and file, screen, printer, 
and music sharing, to name a few. If (or when) it becomes desirable to allow cer-
tain incoming connections from outside computers, enable them in the Sharing 
System Preferences pane.

398     PART 6  Care and Feeding
The only other issue you’re likely to face is when a particular application needs 
you to allow outside connections to it to function. How would you know? Check 
the user manual, Read Me file, or application Help. Or you might see an error  
message that the program can’t connect to the Internet. Don’t worry  — if a 
­program requires you to open your firewall, you can almost certainly find some 
information in one (or more) of these places.
The solution is to click the little + button on the left below the list of rules in the 
Firewall Options window. A standard Open File sheet drops down over the win-
dow; select the appropriate program and click the Add button. Your firewall will 
then allow incoming connections to that particular application evermore.
Selecting the Automatically Allow Signed Software to Receive Incoming Connec-
tions check box will solve some, albeit not all, incoming connection problems by 
allowing any program that has a trusted certificate filed with Apple to receive 
incoming connections without a trip to the Sharing System Preferences pane.
Install recommended software updates
I mention this earlier in a short tip, but it bears repeating: By default, your Mac 
checks with the mothership (Apple) once per week to look for any new or updated 
software. If there is, your Mac informs you that a new software update is available 
and asks whether you’d like to install it. In almost all cases, you do. Apple issues 
software updates to fix newly discovered security concerns, to fix serious bugs 
in macOS, or to fix bugs in or add functionality to Apple applications. You should 
update your Apple apps and system software regularly.
You can perform this check manually by opening the App Store app and displaying 
its Updates tab. If any updates are available, you’ll see them here.
Use the App Store System Preferences pane to disable automatic checking 
­completely, or instruct your Mac to automatically download and install updates, 
or both.
Once in a blue moon, a software update has an unintended side effect; while fix-
ing one problem, it introduces a different problem. This doesn’t happen very  
often because Apple is careful, but if you want to be safe, don’t install a soft-
ware update until you visit Macworld (www.macworld.com), The Mac Observer  
(www.macobserver.com), or another authoritative site and look at what they have 
to say about the update you have in mind. If there are widespread issues with a 
particular software update, sites like these will have the most comprehensive cov-
erage (and possible work-arounds).

CHAPTER 21  Safety First: Backups and Other Security Issues     399
Apps need updates, too. So make a habit of launching the Mac App Store  
application now and then, clicking the Updates tab, and then updating any apps 
that require it.
Many third-party programs, including Microsoft Office and most Adobe products, 
use their own update-checking mechanism. Check and make sure that you have 
yours enabled. Many third-party apps offer a Check for Updates option in the Help 
(or other) menu or as a preference in their Preferences window.
One last thing: If you see a little number on the App Store icon in the dock,  
you have that many updates waiting. Launch the Mac App Store, and click the 
Updates tab.
Protecting Your Data from Prying Eyes
The last kind of security I look at in this chapter is protecting your files from other 
users on your local area network (LAN) and users with physical access to your 
Mac. If you don’t want anyone messing with your files, check out the security 
measures in the following sections.
Blocking or limiting connections
The first thing you may want to do is open the Sharing System Preferences pane 
by launching the System Preferences application (from the Applications folder,  
menu, or dock) and clicking the Sharing icon. Nobody can access your Mac over 
the network if all the services in the Sharing pane are disabled and your firewall 
is set to Block All Incoming Connections. See the section “Firewall: Yea or nay?” 
earlier in this chapter, for details on these settings.
Locking down files with FileVault
If you absolutely, positively don’t ever want anyone to be able to access the files 
in your Home folder without your permission, use FileVault. This app allows you 
to encrypt your entire disk and protect it with the latest government-approved 
encryption standard: Advanced Encryption Standard with 128-bit keys (AES-128).
When you turn on FileVault, you’re asked to set a master password for the com-
puter. After you do, you or any other administrator can use that master password 
if you forget your regular account login password.

400     PART 6  Care and Feeding
I said it at the beginning of the chapter but it bears repeating: If you turn on File­
Vault and forget both your login password and your master password, you can’t 
log in to your account — and your data is lost forever. Really. Not even DriveSav-
ers has a hope of recovering it. So don’t forget these passwords, okay?
FileVault is useful primarily if you store sensitive information on your Mac. If 
you’re logged out of your user account and other people access to your Mac, there 
is no way they can access your data. Period.
Because FileVault encrypts your entire hard drive, some tasks that normally access 
your disk might be prevented. For one thing, some backup programs (not Time 
Machine, of course) choke if FileVault is enabled. Also, if you’re not logged in to 
your user account, other users can’t access your Shared folder(s).
Because FileVault is always encrypting and decrypting files, it can slow older Macs 
a tiny bit when you add or save new files, and it can take extra time before it lets 
you log out, restart, or shut down. If your Mac is less than three years old, you’ll 
probably notice little or no delay from enabling FileVault.
To turn on FileVault, follow these steps:
1.	 Open the Security & Privacy System Preferences pane.
2.	 Click the FileVault tab.
3.	 To enable FileVault, click the Turn on FileVault button.
To turn off FileVault, click the Turn Off FileVault button.
One last thing: You have the option of encrypting Time Machine backups as well 
as iTunes backups of your iDevices. Just enable the appropriate check box in the 
Time Machine System Preferences pane or iTunes Summary pane for your iDevice.
Setting other options for security
The General tab of the Security & Privacy System Preferences pane offers several 
more options that can help keep your data safe. They are as follows:
»
» Change Password: Click this button to change the password for your 
user account.
»
» Require Password after Sleep or Screen Saver Begins: Enable this option if 
you want your Mac to lock itself up and require a password after the screen 
saver kicks in or it goes to sleep. It can become a pain in the butt, having to 
type your password all the time. But if you have nosy co-workers, family 

CHAPTER 21  Safety First: Backups and Other Security Issues     401
members, or other individuals you’d like to keep from rooting around in your 
stuff, you should probably enable this option.
When enabled, this option offers a pop-up menu that lets you specify how 
long after sleep or screen saver this password protection should kick in. The 
options range from immediately to four hours.
»
» Show a Message When the Screen Is Locked: Type the message you want 
on your screen when it’s locked in this text entry box.
»
» Allow Apps Downloaded From: Last, but certainly not least (at least with 
regard to the General tab), are two options that can help protect you from 
downloading and running malicious software by limiting the applications your 
Mac can run.
In case you were wondering, Apple calls this feature Gatekeeper, though that 
name doesn’t appear in the System Preferences pane.
You have two mutually exclusive options — App Store and App Store and 
Identified Developers. Select the radio button next to the level of protection 
you desire, and the other option is automatically deselected.
Here’s what they do:
•	 App Store: This option allows you to run only apps you download from the 
Mac App Store. It’s the safest and most restrictive setting.
•	 App Store and Identified Developers: Apple offers a Developer ID program to 
certified members of the Mac Developers Program. Apple gives them a 
unique Developer ID, which allows Gatekeeper to verify that their app is 
not known malware and that it hasn’t been tampered with. If an app 
doesn’t have a Developer ID associated with it, Gatekeeper can let you 
know before you install it.
This choice is probably the best for most users. It allows third-party apps 
from Apple-vetted vendors, including Microsoft, Adobe, and thousands 
more. It’s a lot less restrictive than the Mac App Store option and a lot safer 
than choosing Anywhere.
Finally, the Privacy tab of the Security & Privacy System Preferences pane has 
several potentially useful options:
»
» To Enable or Disable Location Services: Click Location Services on the left, 
and you’ll see a list of apps that are allowed to use your computer’s current 
location. Select or deselect these apps to enable or disable, respectively, their 
use of Location Services.
»
» To Enable or Disable Other Apps Access to your Contacts, Calendars, and 
Reminders: Click Contacts, Calendars, or Reminders in the list on the left and 

402     PART 6  Care and Feeding
apps with access to their contents will appear on the right. Select or deselect 
the check box for each app to enable or disable, respectively, its permission to 
access Contacts, Calendars, or Reminders.
»
» To Enable or Disable Apps That Have Requested Access to Facebook: Click 
Facebook in the list on the left and apps with access to Facebook will appear 
on the right. Select or deselect the check box for each app to enable or 
disable, respectively, its permission to access Facebook.
»
» To Enable or Disable Apps Allowed to Control Your Computer: Click 
Accessibility in the list on the left, and apps allowed to control your computer 
appear on the right. Select or deselect the check box for each app to enable or 
disable, respectively, its permission to control your computer.
»
» To Automatically Send Anonymous Diagnostic & Usage Data to Apple: 
Click Diagnostics and Usage in the list on the left and then select the Send 
Diagnostic & Usage Data to Apple check box. This sends details of system 
crashes, apps that quit unexpectedly, freezes, or kernel panics (anonymously) 
to the mothership in Cupertino (Apple’s world HQ), where engineers pore over 
the data and issue software updates to eliminate the bugs. For bonus points, 
send crash reports to app developers, too, by enabling the Share Crash Data 
with App Developers check box as well.
Finally, remember the following:
»
» Don’t share your passwords.
»
» Don’t store passwords in insecure locations (such as on sticky notes on your 
monitor).
»
» Don’t log in to suspicious or insecure wireless networks.
»
» Don’t visit suspicious websites or open suspicious emails.
»
» If you have any question about authenticity, just don’t click!
And that’s all you really need to know about security and privacy (or at least 
enough to make you dangerous).

CHAPTER 22  Utility Chest     403
Utility Chest
m
acOS High Sierra comes with a plethora of useful utilities that make 
using your computer more pleasant or make you more productive when 
you use your computer or both. In this chapter, I give you a glimpse of 
the ones that aren’t covered elsewhere in this book.
The first item, Calculator, is in your Applications folder; all the other items in 
this chapter are in your Utilities folder, inside your Applications folder (or use the 
Utilities folder’s keyboard shortcut, ⌘  +Shift+U).
Calculator
Need to do some quick math? The Calculator application gives you a simple  
calculator with all the basic number-crunching functions found in a pocket  
calculator. To use it, you can either click the keys with the mouse or type numbers 
and operators (math symbols such as +, –, and =) using the number keys on your 
keyboard (or numeric keypad, if you have one). Calculator also offers a paper tape 
(Window  ➪  Show Paper Tape) to track your computations — and, if you want, 
provide a printed record. It can even speak numbers aloud (Speech  ➪  Speak But-
ton Pressed and Speech  ➪  Speak Result).
Check out Calculator in Figure 22-1.

404     PART 6  Care and Feeding
In my humble opinion, the most useful feature in Calculator (after Paper Tape) is 
the Convert menu — more specifically, the currency-conversion feature. It checks 
the Internet for the current exchange rate before calculating the conversion for 
you. That’s very cool.
Beyond that, Calculator has three modes: Basic, Scientific, and Programmer. Basic 
is the default, and you access the other two modes as follows:
»
» Pressing ⌘  +2 (View  ➪  Scientific) turns the formerly anemic calculator into a 
powerful scientific calculator.
»
» Choosing View  ➪  Programmer (⌘  +3) turns Calculator into the programmer’s 
friend, letting you display your data in binary, octal, hexadecimal, ASCII, and 
Unicode. It also performs programming operations, such as shifts and byte 
swaps. (If you’re a programmer, you know what all that means; if you aren’t, it 
really doesn’t matter.)
Activity Monitor
In Unix, the underlying operating system that powers macOS, applications and 
other things going on behind the scenes are called processes. Each application and 
the operating system itself can run a number of processes at the same time.
In Figure 22-2, you see 288 different processes running, most of them behind 
the scenes. Note that when this screen shot was taken, I had half a dozen or more 
programs running, including Finder, Safari, and Activity Monitor itself.
To display the two CPU monitor windows on the right side of the Activity Monitor 
window as shown in Figure 22-2, choose Window  ➪  CPU Usage (⌘  +2) and CPU 
History (⌘  +3).
FIGURE 22-1: 
Calculator 
(left), Convert 
menu (middle), 
and Paper 
Tape (right).

CHAPTER 22  Utility Chest     405
You also select what appears in the Activity Monitor’s dock icon — CPU Usage, 
CPU History, Network Usage (shown in Figure 22-2), Disk Activity, or the Activity 
Monitor icon — by choosing View  ➪  Dock Icon. All but the Activity Monitor icon 
appear live, meaning that they update every few seconds to reflect the current 
state of affairs.
Note that you can’t display CPU Usage or CPU History in a window and in the dock 
icon at the same time — those two items can be displayed in the dock or a win-
dow, but not both.
To choose how often these updates occur, choose View  ➪  Update Frequency.
Setting Activity Monitor to update more frequently causes it to use more CPU 
cycles, which can decrease overall performance slightly.
Finally, the bottom portion of the Activity Monitor window displays information 
for the active tab. Select the CPU, Memory, Energy, Disk, or Network, and the 
middle and bottom portions of the Activity Monitor window change to reflect that 
selection.
Because all Macs that can run High Sierra have at least a dual-core processor, 
you’ll see at least two, and possibly four or more, CPUs displayed in Activity Mon-
itor: one for each core.

Monitor 
window, two

406     PART 6  Care and Feeding
Geeks and troubleshooters (and even you) can use Activity Monitor to identify 
what processes are running, which user owns the process, and how much CPU 
capacity and memory the process is using. You can even use this feature to quit or 
force-quit a process that you think might be causing problems for you.
Messing around in Activity Monitor isn’t a good idea for most users. If you’re hav-
ing problems with an application or with macOS, try quitting open applications, 
force-quitting applications (press ⌘  +Option+Esc — the Mac three-finger salute), 
or logging out and then logging back in again before you start mucking around 
with killing processes.
Disk Utility
If you’re having problems with your hard drive or need to make changes to it, Disk 
Utility is a good place to start. Start by clicking a disk or volume in the column on 
the left and then click one of the buttons on the toolbar as described in the fol-
lowing sections.
First Aid button
If you suspect that something’s not quite right with your startup disk (or any 
other disk connected to your Mac), the First Aid button in Disk Utility should be 
among your first stops. Use First Aid to verify and (if necessary) repair an ail-
ing drive. To use it, select a volume icon in the list on the left and then click the 
First Aid button in the upper-left corner of the Disk Utility window. A sheet asks 
if you’d like to run First Aid on the selected disk; click Run to do it or Cancel to 
dismiss the sheet. When it’s finished, you’ll get information about any problems 
that the software finds.
If First Aid doesn’t find any problems, you can go on your merry way, secure in the 
knowledge that your Mac is A-okay. If First Aid turns up a problem that it can’t 
fix, it will advise you what to do next.
You can’t use Disk Utility First Aid to fix a CD or DVD, nor can you use it to fix most 
disk image files. These types of disks are read-only and can’t be altered.

CHAPTER 22  Utility Chest     407
Partition button
Use the Partition button to create disk partitions (multiple volumes on a sin-
gle disk). macOS treats each partition as a separate disk. The Partition button is 
enabled only when an eligible item is selected in the column on the left.
Be careful here. Although some adjustments can be made to partitions without loss of 
data, not all adjustments can. You’ll be warned if what you’re about to do will perma-
nently erase your data, but I thought I’d give you fair warning first. And, of course, 
you should always have a backup (see Chapter 21) before mucking with your disk.
Erase button
Use Erase to format (completely erase) any disk except the current startup disk.
When you format a disk, you erase all information on it permanently. Formatting 
can’t be undone — so unless you’re absolutely sure this is what you want, don’t do it. 
Unless you have no use for whatever’s currently on the disk, make a complete backup 
of the disk before you format it. If the data is critical, you should have at least two 
(or even three) known-to-be-valid backup copies of that disk before you reformat.
Mount/Unmount button
A drive can be connected but not available to your Mac. For example, when you 
eject a hard drive or SSD, it’s still connected to the computer but doesn’t appear in 
Finder. This is called an unmounted disk.
OF PARTITIONS AND VOLUMES
Partitioning a drive lets you create multiple volumes. A volume is a storage space that 
(from the Mac’s point of view) looks and acts just like a hard drive. A partition is simply a 
designated volume on a drive, completely separate from all other partitions (volumes). 
You can create any number of partitions, but it’s a good idea to limit yourself to no more 
than a small handful.
By the same token, it’s absolutely not necessary to use partitions unless you’re running 
Boot Camp (see Chapter 20). Many users never partition a hard drive and get along just 
fine. If you do choose to partition, you should probably limit the number of partitions 
you create. An iMac with a 1TB drive will do just fine as shipped (with a single partition); 
there’s no need to create more.

408     PART 6  Care and Feeding
The Mount/Unmount button lets you dismount (eject) or mount a connected disk 
or partition on a disk. For reasons that should be obvious, you can’t eject the disk 
from which you booted.
Info button
Click the Info button to see myriad technical details about the selected disk, 
including its size, capacity, and free and used space. One last thing: You find out 
more about Disk Utility (mostly how to use it for troubleshooting) in Chapter 23.
Grab
Want to take a picture of your screen? You can use Grab to take a picture of all or part 
of the screen and save that file for printing or sending (say, to all your screaming 
fans who want to see your desktop pattern or how you’ve organized your windows).
And guess what? Universal keyboard shortcuts let you create a picture of your 
entire screen (⌘  +Shift+3) or just a portion of it (⌘  +Shift+4) even when Grab isn’t 
running.
Grab’s best feature is its capability to do a timed screen capture. Like those cam-
eras that let you start the timer and then run to get into the shot, Grab gives you 
ten seconds to bring the window you want to the front, pull down a menu, and get 
the cursor out of the way or whatever you need to do to get the screen just right.
Grab’s default behavior is to not display a cursor. If you want to show a cursor 
in your screen shots, choose Grab  ➪  Preferences and then select a pointer from 
the ten choices in the Preferences window. To have no cursor, click the topmost, 
leftmost item, which is an empty box that indicates no cursor.
Grapher
Grapher is a venerable piece of eye candy that shows off your CPU’s computational 
power. A quick, visual math instructor, Grapher can graph equations in two or 
three dimensions and speaks hexadecimal, octal, base ten (decimal), and binary 
to boot. You can even graph curves, surfaces, inequalities, differential equations, 
discrete series, and vector and scalar fields . . . whatever that means. (I found all 
that information in Apple Help.) I have no clue how to use it, but the examples are 
pretty (see Figure 22-3).

CHAPTER 22  Utility Chest     409
Keychain Access
A keychain is a way to consolidate your passwords — the one you use to log in to 
your Mac, your email password, and passwords required by any websites. Keychain 
Access is the application you use to manage those passwords.
Here’s how it works: You use a single password to unlock your keychain (which 
holds your various passwords), and then you don’t have to remember all your other 
passwords. Rest assured that your passwords are secure because only a user who 
has your keychain password can reach the other password-protected applications.
The Keychain Access utility is particularly cool if you have multiple email accounts 
and each one has a different password. Just add them all to your keychain, and you 
can get all your mail at the same time with one password.
A special master keychain called the Login Keychain is created automatically for 
every macOS High Sierra user and unlocked automatically when you log into your 
account.
Here’s how to add passwords to your login keychain:
»
» To add passwords for applications: If the application supports the keychain, 
the first time you log in with your username and password, a dialog will ask if 
you want to add this login to the keychain. Click Yes.
FIGURE 22-3: 
Grapher’s 
Implicit & 
Explicit Curves 
example.

410     PART 6  Care and Feeding
How do you know which programs support the Keychain Access utility? You 
don’t, until you’re prompted to save your password in a keychain in that Open 
dialog, connect window, or so forth. If a program supports Keychain Access, it 
offers a check box for it in the user ID/password dialog or window.
If that doesn’t happen the first time you provide your password, the program 
doesn’t support macOS keychains and you’re out of luck. You can add the 
account details manually (see the next bullet), but they won’t be provided 
automatically when the app requests them — you’ll have to open Keychain 
Access to look them up. The upside is that your passwords are secure as long 
as they’re stored in a keychain.
If you select the User Names and Passwords check box on the AutoFill tab of 
Safari’s Preferences window (Safari  ➪  Preferences or ⌘  +, [comma]), you don’t 
have to add sites, accounts, or passwords manually. Instead, the first time you 
visit a site that requires an account name and a password, Safari asks whether 
you would like to save your password, and then it does so.
»
» To add a website (or other) password to a keychain manually: If your 
login credentials aren’t being filled in automatically for a website, you can add 
them manually using the Keychain Access application. Just click the little + 
(plus) button at the bottom of the main window and type (or copy and paste) 
the URL of the page in the Keychain Item Name text field. Then type your 
username in the Account Name field and your password in the Password 
field, as shown in Figure 22-4. (If you’re adding a password for something 
other than a website, type a descriptive name in the Keychain Item Name field 
rather than a URL.)
FIGURE 22-4: 
Add a URL to 
the keychain 
manually by 
using Keychain 
Access.

CHAPTER 22  Utility Chest     411
Click the little key to the right of the password field to use the Password Assistant 
window, which can help you select a memorable high-quality password.
To use the new URL password, use Safari to open the URL. If the account name 
and password aren’t filled in for you automatically, choose Edit  ➪  AutoFill Form 
(⌘  +Shift+A) and they will be.
iCloud Keychain syncing is a great feature that makes keychains even better. Turn 
it on (System Preferences  ➪  iCloud), and your Safari passwords will be securely 
synced to (and from) all your Apple devices, including iPhones and iPads.
Just remember that this makes all your passwords available on all your devices. 
That’s handy, but if any of your devices aren’t secured with passwords or pass-
codes or are shared with others, all your passwords could be at risk. Just think 
about it before you enable iCloud Keychain.
Migration Assistant
Migration Assistant is pretty much a one-trick pony, but that pony is a prizewin-
ner. You use Migration Assistant to transfer your account and other user informa-
tion from another Mac, another volume on the current Mac, or a Time Machine 
backup. You need to authenticate as an administrator to use it, but it’s a pretty 
handy way to transfer an entire account without having to re-create your prefer-
ences and other settings. When you first installed High Sierra (or when you booted 
your nice, new High Sierra–based Mac for the first time), the setup utility asked 
you whether you wanted to transfer your information from another Mac. If you 
answered in the affirmative, it ran Migration Assistant.
It’s not just for new High Sierra installs. You can launch this one-trick-pony any-
time to transfer all or some user accounts, applications, settings, and files from 
another Mac, PC, or Time Machine backup to this one. You can use it also after 
replacing a hard drive or reinstalling macOS. Last but not least, Migration Assis-
tant can import user accounts, applications, settings, and files from Windows PCs 
as well as from Macs.
System Information
System Information (the App Formerly Known as System Profiler) is a little pro-
gram that is launched when you click the System Report button in the About This 
Mac window (    ➪  About This Mac). It provides information about your Mac. 

412     PART 6  Care and Feeding
(What a concept!) If you’re curious about arcane questions such as what processor 
your Mac has or what devices are stashed inside it or are connected to it, give this 
baby a try. Click various items in the Contents list on the left side of the window, 
and information about the item appears on the right side of the window. Feel free 
to poke around this little puppy as much as you like; it’s benign and can’t hurt 
anything.
If you ever have occasion to call for technical support for your Mac, software, or 
peripherals, you’re probably going to be asked to provide information from Sys-
tem Information, so don’t get rid of it just because you don’t care about this kind 
of stuff.
Terminal
macOS is based on Unix. If you need proof — or if you actually want to operate 
your Mac as the Unix machine that it is — Terminal is the place to start.
Because Unix is a command line–based operating system, you use Terminal to 
type your commands. You can issue commands that show a directory listing, copy 
and move files, search for filenames or contents, or establish or change pass-
words. In short, if you know what you’re doing, you can do everything on the 
command line that you can do in macOS. For most folks, that’s not a desirable 
alternative to the windows and icons of the Finder window. But take my word for 
it; true geeks who are also Mac lovers get all misty-eyed about the combination of 
a command line and a graphical user interface.
You can wreak havoc upon your poor operating system with Terminal. You can 
harm your High Sierra in many ways that just aren’t possible using mere windows 
and icons and clicks. Before you type a single command in Terminal, think seriously 
about what I just said. And if you’re not 100 percent certain about the command you 
just typed, don’t even think about pressing Return.

CHAPTER 23  Troubleshooting macOS     413
Troubleshooting macOS
A
s a bleeding-edge Mac enthusiast and consultant with more than a quarter 
century of Mac experience, I’ve seen more than my share of Mac troubles. 
Over those years, I’ve developed an arsenal of mostly surefire tips and 
tricks that I believe can resolve more than 90 percent of Mac issues without a trip 
to the repair shop.
Alas, if your hardware is dead, then, sadly, neither you nor I can do anything 
about it because it is now a job for your friendly Mac repairman — and your fat 
checkbook or high-limit credit card. But if your hardware is okay, you have a 
fighting chance of using the suggestions in this chapter to get your machine up 
and running.
About Startup Disks and Booting
Although you usually see a stylish Apple logo when you turn on your computer, 
once in a blue moon, you may instead see a solid blue screen, a solid gray screen, 
a solid black screen, or something else entirely, as described in the next section.
The point is that your Mac isn’t starting up as it should. When this happens, it 
usually indicates that something bad has happened to your Mac. Sometimes, a 
hardware component has bitten the dust; other times, macOS itself has somehow 
been damaged.

Storage

414     PART 6  Care and Feeding
Rest assured that these occurrences are uncommon — many Macs and Mac users 
go an entire lifetime without ever having an issue. But if you ever have a Mac that 
won’t boot, don’t despair. Before you declare your Mac terminally ill or worse, try 
out the advice in this chapter.
Finally, I use the term hard disk generically throughout the chapter to refer to hard 
disks (mechanical with spinning platters) or solid-state disks (electronic with no 
moving parts).
Finding or creating a startup disk
First things first: When I talk about booting, I mean using a particular disk or disk 
partition as your startup disk.
Because High Sierra (like Sierra, Yosemite, and Mavericks before it) is available 
only in the Mac App Store and can no longer be purchased on a (bootable) DVD, the 
macOS Installer creates a bootable partition named Recovery HD when you first 
install High Sierra on a disk.
I recommend that you also make a bootable Recovery disk (in addition to the one 
High Sierra should have created) or a clone of your Mac startup disk. If not, it’s 
something you may wish you had done if your Mac starts acting wonky.
Explaining how to create a bootable recovery disk or clone is beyond the purview 
of this book, but I hope you’ll take it upon yourself to search the Internet and 
figure out how to make one. The Recovery HD partition is a good concept, but if 
your hard disk dies, the Recovery HD partition generally dies with it — which is 
why I strongly recommend making a bootable clone of your startup disk as soon as pos-
sible, just in case.
Remember: You can’t boot from a Time Machine backup.
I use Carbon Copy Cloner (www.bombich.com), a $39.99 app that lets you cre-
ate a clone of your boot disk with a minimum of fuss. Or you can try Super-
Duper! (shareware from www.shirt-pocket.com); just add a hard disk as large as 
or larger than your boot disk, and you’ll be good to go with any of these options.
They call it a prohibitory sign for a reason
When you turn on your Mac, the first thing it does (after the hardware tests) 
is check for a startup disk that has a viable copy of macOS on it. If your  
system doesn’t find such a disk on your internal hard drive, it begins looking  
elsewhere — on a FireWire, Thunderbolt, or Universal Serial Bus (USB) disk, a 
thumb drive, or a DVD.

CHAPTER 23  Troubleshooting macOS     415
At this point, your Mac usually finds your internal hard drive (or SSD), which con-
tains your operating system, and the startup process continues on its merry way 
with the subtle Apple logo and all the rest. If your Mac can’t find your hard drive 
(or doesn’t find on it what it needs to boot macOS), you encounter the dreaded 
prohibitory sign. Think of the prohibitory sign as your Mac’s way of saying, 
“Please provide me a startup disk.”
If you have more than one startup disk attached to your Mac, as many users do, 
you can choose which one your Mac boots from in the Startup Disk System Pref-
erences pane or by pressing and holding down the Option key when you start up 
your Mac.
If Apple can figure out a way to put a prohibitory sign on the screen, why the heck 
can’t the software engineers find a way to put the words I need a startup disk on the 
screen as well? The curtness of these icons is one of my pet peeves about the Mac. 
I know — you’re clever and smart (because, of course, you’re smart enough to be 
reading macOS High Sierra For Dummies), so you know that a prohibitory sign means 
you should insert a startup disk. But what about everyone else?
If you encounter any of the warning icons shown in Figure 23-1, go through the 
steps I outline later in this chapter. You can try different options, such as using 
Disk Utility’s First Aid, zapping the parameter RAM (PRAM), and performing a 
Safe boot. Try them in the order listed, starting with Step 1. Then, if one doesn’t 
work, move on to the next.
FIGURE 23-1: 
Any of these 
means it’s 
troubleshooting 
time.

Recovering with Recovery HD
If you see a prohibitory sign (top left in Figure 23-1), spinning-disc cursor (top 
right), or kernel panic alert (the text in other languages that appears below the 
other two images) that doesn’t go away when you start up your Mac, the first 
thing to do is attempt to repair hidden damage to your hard drive with the Disk 
Utility program’s First Aid feature.
Step 1: Run First Aid
In most cases, the first logical troubleshooting step is to use the First Aid option 
in the Disk Utility application.
Every drive has several strangely named components, such as B-trees, extent 
files, catalog files, and other creatively named invisible files. They’re all involved 
in managing the data on your drives. Disk Utility’s First Aid feature checks all 
those files and repairs the damaged ones.
1.	 Launch the Disk Utility application (in Applications  ➪ Utilities).
2.	 Click the icon for your boot hard drive, to the left of the Disk Utility 
window.
Your boot drive is the one with macOS and your Home folder on it; mine is 
called High Sierra SSD.
3.	 Click the First Aid button in the toolbar.
A sheet drops down, asking if you’d like to run First Aid on that disk.
4.	 Click the Run button.
Your Mac whirs and hums for a few minutes, and a sheet eventually drops 
down.
5.	 (Optional) Click Details to see (mostly unintelligible) details of what First 
Aid has done to your disk.
6.	 Click the Done button.
7.	 Quit Disk Utility.
Choose Disk Utility  ➪  Quit Disk Utility, press ⌘  +Q, or click the red Close 
Window gumdrop button.
If First Aid finds damage that it can’t fix, a commercial disk-recovery tool, such as 
Prosoft’s excellent Drive Genius or Alsoft’s also excellent DiskWarrior, may be able 
to repair the damage. And even if First Aid gave your Mac a clean bill of health, you 
may want to run a third-party utility anyway, just to have a second opinion.

CHAPTER 23  Troubleshooting macOS     417
Make sure you’re running a current version; older versions may not be compatible 
with macOS High Sierra and could make things worse.
If everything checks out with First Aid but you still get the prohibitory sign  
after you restart, proceed to the next section to try a dance called booting into 
Safe mode.
Step 2: Safe boot into Safe mode
Booting your Mac in Safe mode may help you resolve your startup issue by  
not loading nonessential (and non–macOS) software at boot time. You do it by 
holding down the Shift key during startup.
If your Mac is set up so you don’t have to log in, keep pressing the Shift key 
during startup until Finder loads completely. If you do log in to your Mac, type 
your password as usual — but before clicking the Log In button, press the Shift 
key again and hold it down until Finder loads completely.
You know you held the Shift key long enough if your Login Items don’t load 
(assuming that you have Login Items; you can designate them in the Users & 
Groups System Preferences pane, although some programs create them for you).
Booting in Safe mode does three things to help you with troubleshooting:
»
» It forces a directory check of the startup (boot) volume.
»
» It loads only required kernel extensions (some of the items in /System/Library/
Extensions).
»
» It runs only Apple-installed essential startup items (some of the items in /
Library/StartupItems and /System/Library/StartupItems). Note that the 
Startup Items in the Library folders are different from the Login Items in the 
Users & Groups System Preferences pane. Startup Items run at boot time 
before the login window even appears; Login Items don’t run until after you 
log into your user account.
Taken together, these changes often work around issues caused by software or 
directory damage on the startup volume.
Some features may not work in Safe mode. Among them are DVD Player, capturing 
video (in iMovie or other video-editing software), using AirPort, and using some 
audio input or output devices. Use Safe mode only when you need to troubleshoot 
a startup issue.

418     PART 6  Care and Feeding
If your Mac boots in Safe mode, you may be able to determine what’s causing the 
issue by moving the contents of your Preferences folder (in Home/Library, which 
you can make visible by pressing the Option key when opening the Go menu) to 
the desktop temporarily or by disabling Login Items (in the Users & Groups Sys-
tem Preferences pane). If either of these things resolves the issue, you can put 
preferences files back in Home/Library/Preferences a few at a time, or you can 
reenable login items one at a time until you figure out which preferences file or 
login item is causing your problems. If your Mac still has problems, see the fol-
lowing section.
Step 3: Zapping the PRAM/NVRAM
Sometimes your parameter RAM (PRAM) or non-volatile RAM (NVRAM) becomes 
scrambled and needs to be reset. Both of these are small pieces of memory that 
aren’t erased or forgotten when you shut down. They keep track of things such as 
the following:
»
» Time zone setting
»
» Startup volume choice
»
» Speaker volume
»
» Any recent kernel panic information
»
» DVD region setting
To reset (a process often called zapping) your PRAM/NVRAM, restart your Mac 
and press ⌘  +Option+P+R (that’s four keys  — good luck; it’s okay to use your 
nose) until your Mac restarts itself. It’s kind of like a hiccup. You might see the 
spinning-disc pointer for a minute or two while your Mac thinks about it . . . then 
the icon disappears, and your Mac chimes again and restarts. Most power users 
believe you should zap it more than once, letting it chime two, three, or even four 
times before releasing the keys and allowing the startup process to proceed.
Now restart your Mac without holding down any keys. If the PRAM/NVRAM zap 
didn’t fix your Mac, move on to the section “Step 4: Reinstalling macOS.”
Your chosen startup disk, time zone, and sound volume may be reset to their 
default values when you zap your PRAM.  So after zapping, open the System  
Preferences application to reselect your usual startup disk and time zone, and set 
the sound volume the way you like it if necessary.

CHAPTER 23  Troubleshooting macOS     419
Step 4: Reinstalling macOS
I present the procedure to reinstall the system software as a second-to-last resort 
when your Mac won’t boot correctly because it takes the longest and is the biggest 
hassle. Apple has a nifty technical note on reinstallation at https://support.
apple.com/en-us/HT204904. Follow the instructions, taking care not to erase 
your disk before you reinstall macOS.
Step 5: Things to try before taking  
your Mac in for repair
To get your Mac up and running again, you can try any of the following:
»
» Call the tech-support hotline. Before you drag it down to the shop, try 
calling 1-800-SOS-APPL, the Apple Tech Support hotline. The service represen-
tatives there may be able to suggest something else that you can try. If your 
Mac is still under warranty, it’s even free.
»
» Ask a local user group for help. Another thing you might consider is 
contacting your local Mac user group. You can find a group of Mac users near 
you by visiting Apple’s User Group web pages at www.apple.com/
usergroups.
»
» Check whether you have RAM issues. Here’s a common problem: If you 
have problems immediately after installing RAM — or any new hardware, for 
that matter — double-check that the RAM chips are properly seated in their 
sockets.
Don’t forget to shut down your Mac first. With the power off and your Mac 
unplugged, remove and reinsert the RAM chips to make sure they’re seated 
properly.
If you still have problems, remove the RAM chips temporarily and see whether 
the problem still exists.
Follow the installation instructions that came with the RAM chips or the ones 
in the booklet that came with your Mac.
First discharge any static spark, either by using an antistatic strap (available 
from most RAM sellers) or by touching an appropriate surface (such as the 
power-supply case inside your Mac) before you handle RAM chips.

420     PART 6  Care and Feeding
Some new Macs, notably some MacBook and MacBook Air models, don’t have 
upgradeable RAM. So before you open your Mac, check online to see whether its 
RAM is upgradeable.
If none of my suggestions works for you, and you’re still seeing anything you 
shouldn’t when you start up your Mac, you have big trouble. You could have any 
one of the following problems:
»
» Your hard drive is dead.
»
» You have some other type of hardware failure.
»
» All your startup disks are defective (unlikely).
The bottom line: If you still can’t start up normally after trying all the cures I list 
in this chapter, you almost certainly need to have your Mac serviced by a qualified 
technician.
If Your Mac Crashes at Startup
Startup crashes are another bad thing that can happen to your Mac. These crashes 
can be more of a hassle to resolve than prohibitory sign problems, but they are 
rarely fatal.
You know that a crash has happened when you see a Quit Unexpectedly dialog, a 
frozen cursor, a frozen screen, or any other disabling event. A startup crash hap-
pens when your system shows a crash symptom any time between the moment 
you flick the power key or switch (or restarting) and the moment you have full 
use of the desktop.
Try all the steps in the previous sections before you panic. The easiest way to 
fix startup crashes (in most cases) is to just reinstall macOS from the  
Recovery HD partition. Apple details this procedure at great length online, at 
https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204904. If you’re still unsuccessful after 
that point, read the “Step 5: Things to try before taking your Mac in for repair” 
section.

CHAPTER 23  Troubleshooting macOS     421
Optimizing Storage
macOS Sierra introduced a new feature called Optimized Storage, which provides 
assistance when your startup disk gets close to being full.
Here’s why it’s in the troubleshooting chapter, in case you’re wondering: Your 
Mac will slow to a crawl when your startup disk gets close to full. If your startup 
disk is more than 90 percent filled, you’ll begin to experience slowness and jerki-
ness. And as the drive approaches 100 percent fullness, things grow even slower 
and jerkier.
Optimized Storage aims to help you out as your disk fills up by scanning for dupli-
cates, old email attachments, and downloads so you can delete them or move them 
to the cloud. But you should read what follows even if your disk isn’t approaching 
fullness right now, because Optimized Storage offers several options that may 
keep your disk from ever getting too full.
To check it out, choose   ➪  About This Mac, click the Storage tab at the top of the 
window, and then click the Details button for your startup disk.
Optimized Storage includes four tools, as shown in Figure 23-2:
»
» Store in iCloud: Store all your files in iCloud to save space, keeping only 
recently opened files on your Mac when storage space is needed.
This option could be convenient, but it’s going to chew through your 5GB of 
free iCloud storage in no time. With additional iCloud storage currently selling 
for $2.99 a month (200GB) or $9.99 a month (1TB), it could be costly as well as 
convenient.
»
» Optimize Storage: Remove from your Mac movies and TV shows you’ve 
already watched.
»
» Erase Trash Automatically: Automatically empty files that have been in the 
Trash for 30 days.
»
» Reduce Clutter: Review and delete older documents, which are broken down 
by category — Applications, Documents, iBooks, and so on — along the left 
side of the window.

422     PART 6  Care and Feeding
The bottom line is that you don’t want your startup disk anywhere close to 100 
percent full, and High Sierra’s new Optimized Storage features provide four useful 
ways for you to stay on top of and avert trouble before it even occurs.
FIGURE 23-2: 
If your disk is 
getting full, 
use one or 
more of these 
Optimized 
Storage tools.

Use Those Keyboard Shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts (see Table 24-1 for a nice little list of the most useful ones) 
can make navigating your Mac a much faster experience compared with con-
stantly using the mouse, offering these benefits:
»
» If you use keyboard shortcuts, your hands stay focused on the keyboard, 
reducing the amount of time that you remove your hand from the keyboard 
to fiddle with the mouse or trackpad.

»
» If you memorize keyboard shortcuts with your head, your fingers will memo-
rize them, too.
»
» The more keyboard shortcuts you use, the faster you can do what you’re 
doing.
Trust me when I say that using the keyboard shortcuts for commands you use 
often can save you a ton of effort and hours upon hours of time.
Make a list of keyboard shortcuts you want to memorize, and tape it to your  
monitor or where you’ll see it all the time when using your Mac. (Heck, make a 
photocopy of Table 24-1!)
Improve Your Typing Skills
One way to make your Mac seem faster is to make your fingers move faster. The 
quicker you finish a task, the quicker you’re on to something else. Keyboard 
shortcuts are nifty tools, and improving your typing speed and accuracy will save 
you time, plus you’ll get stuff done faster if you’re not always looking down at the 
keys when you type. As your typing skills improve, you also spend less time cor-
recting errors or editing your work.
The speed and accuracy that you gain have a bonus: When you’re a decent touch 
typist, your fingers fly even faster when you use those nifty keyboard shortcuts.  
(I list a gaggle of these in the preceding section, in Table 24-1.)
An easy way to improve your keyboarding skills is by using a typing tutor program 
such as Ten Thumbs Typing Tutor ($25.95 at www.tenthumbstypingtutor.com), a 
typing instruction website such as Typing Test (free at www.typingtest.com), or 
any of the myriad typing-instruction apps you’ll find in the Mac App Store (search 
for typing).
Resolution: It’s Not Just for  
New Year’s Day Anymore
A setting that you can change to potentially improve your Mac’s performance is 
the resolution of your monitor. Most modern monitors and video cards (or onboard 
video circuitry, depending on which Mac model you use) can display multiple 
degrees of screen resolution. You change your monitor’s display resolution in the 

428     PART 7  The Part of Tens
Displays System Preferences pane. First, click the Display tab and then click the 
Scaled button, which makes a list of resolutions appear, as shown in Figure 24-1. 
Select the resolution you want to try from the list below the Scaled button.
You see much more at native resolution, but everything is much bigger at lower 
resolutions, as shown in Figure 24-2.
Here’s the deal on display resolution: The first number is the number of pixels 
(color dots) that run horizontally, and the second number is the number of lines 
running vertically. It used to be that fewer pixels refreshed faster. But with LCD 
and LED (flat-panel) monitors and notebooks, this usually isn’t true — or if it is 
true, it’s almost unnoticeable. Furthermore, because you can see more onscreen 
at higher resolutions, a higher resolution reduces the amount of scrolling that 
you have to do and lets you have more open windows on the screen. Finally, the 
highest resolution is almost always the native resolution of that display, which 
means it will usually look the sharpest. So you could just as easily say that higher 
resolutions can speed up your Mac experience as well.

On the other hand, if you can’t discern icons in toolbars and other program com-
ponents, using a lower resolution may actually enhance your work speed.
Choose a resolution based on what looks best and works best for you. That said, 
if your Mac seems slow at its current resolution, try a lower resolution, and see 
whether it feels faster. And if you have a Retina display, try all available resolu-
tions to see which you prefer. The highest resolution on a Retina display will 
make everything on the screen appear very, very small, which may or may not be 
desirable.
A Mac with a View — and Preferences, Too
The type of icon display and the desktop background that you choose affect how 
quickly your screen updates in Finder. You can set and change these choices in the 
View Options window. From Finder, choose View  ➪  Show View Options (or use the 
keyboard shortcut ⌘  +J).
The View Options window, like your old friend the contextual menu, is . . . well, 
contextual: Depending on what’s active when you choose it from the View menu, 
you see one of five similar versions (shown in Figure  24-3). Clockwise from 
upper-left, the figure shows the options for the active window (Applications) in 
Icon view, List view, Column view, Cover Flow view, and the view options for the 
desktop.
A handful of settings can affect the speed of your Mac or your ability to see what 
you want quickly:
»
» Icon Size: The smaller the icon, the faster the screen updates, especially if the 
folder has many graphic files with thumbnails (those little icon pictures that 
represent the big picture the file contains).
In the Icon view of the View Options window, moving the Icon Size slider to the 
left makes icons smaller and faster; moving it to the right makes them bigger 
and slower. In List view, select one of the two Icon Size radio buttons to 
choose smaller (faster) or larger (slower) icons. The difference is greater if you 
have a slower Mac.
»
» Calculate All Sizes: If windows in List view take a while to populate after you 
open them, try deselecting the Calculate All Sizes check box in the View 
Options window for List view. If you activate this option, Finder calculates the 
size of every folder of every open window in List view and displays that 
number in the Size column. At least to me, the screen feels as though it 
redraws faster with this feature turned off.

430     PART 7  The Part of Tens
If you want to know the size of a folder, just click it and choose File  ➪  Get Info 
(or use the keyboard shortcut, ⌘  +I).
»
» Show Columns: When it comes to speed, don’t worry about the Show 
Columns check boxes in the View Options window for List view — Date 
Modified, Date Created, Size, Kind, Version, and Comments. The effect of 
these items on screen updating is small these days, so your choice should be 
made according to the specific information you want to see in Finder win-
dows, not on whether choosing them slows your Mac.
FIGURE 24-3: 
Your choices

CHAPTER 24  Ten (or So) Ways to Speed Up Your Mac Experience     431
The Use as Defaults buttons at the bottom of the Icon, List, and Cover Flow View 
Options windows set the default appearance for all Finder windows of that type. 
If you don’t click the Use as Defaults button, any changes you make apply only to 
the active window (Applications in Figure 24-3). Note that Column view windows 
and the desktop don’t have a Use as Defaults button; in both cases, any changes 
you make automatically become the defaults.
Get a New, Faster Model
Apple keeps putting out faster and faster Macs at lower and lower prices, and 
all Macs except the bottom-of-the-line Mac mini now ship with at least 8GB of 
RAM. Although 4GB is officially enough RAM to run High Sierra, if you like to keep 
a few apps running all the time, it’s not enough to run it at its best.
Check out the latest iMacs and Mac minis — they’re excellent values. Or if you 
crave portability, MacBook, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro models are rocking 
good computers and have never been less expensive. You might even consider 
a used Mac that’s faster than yours. eBay (www.ebay.com) has hundreds of used 
Macs up for auction at any given time. Shopping on eBay might just get you a 
better Mac at an outstanding price. Or try Craigslist (www.craigslist.org) if you 
prefer to see and touch the Mac before you commit. Give it a try!
Another excellent option is to visit the Apple website’s refurbished and clear-
ance section. You can frequently save hundreds of dollars by purchasing a slightly 
used Mac that has been refurbished to factory specifications by Apple. Another 
advantage to Apple refurbs is that they come with an Apple warranty. If you’re 
on a tight budget, definitely check it out (http://store.apple.com/us/browse/
home/specialdeals).
I always buy refurbished products when I can. In fact, I can’t remember the last 
time I bought an Apple product for its list price when I could get a refurbished one 
for significantly less.
You Can Never Have Too Much RAM!
You get a lot of bang for your buck when you upgrade your Mac’s RAM. Get an 
additional 2GB, 4GB, or even 8GB; you can never have too much. Your Mac will run 
better with at least 8GB of RAM, which will cost you less than $100 in most cases 
and can be installed by anyone. Yes, anyone — the instructions are right there 

432     PART 7  The Part of Tens
in your User Guide booklet, or you can find them at the Apple Technical Support 
pages (www.apple.com/support; search for RAM upgrade and your Mac model).
Unless, that is, you own a certain late-model MacBook, MacBook Air, or iMac. 
These models are exceedingly difficult to open, and Apple frowns upon users 
opening the MacBook Air. Plus, some of these models have RAM soldered to the 
motherboard and can’t be upgraded. You might want to opt for the services of an 
authorized, certified Mac cracker-opener to perform your MacBook Air or iMac 
RAM upgrade (if yours is upgradeable). The bottom line is that it’s best to order 
your Mac with as much RAM as you can in the first place.
Get an Accelerated Graphics Card
An accelerated graphics card is designed to speed up one thing: the screen update 
rate. These cards are extremely popular with graphic arts professionals and with 
gamers. Accelerated graphics cards blast pixels onto your screen at amazing 
speeds. And because the macOS Quartz Extreme imaging architecture hands off 
part of its load to the processor on an accelerated graphics card, it might make 
your Mac’s other tasks faster because it does some of the work that your Mac’s 
main processor (CPU) used to do. That’s the good news.
The bad news is that you can use a graphics accelerator only if your Mac has an 
accelerated PCI slot or Thunderbolt connection for it, which is where you install 
these suckers. Only pre-2012 Mac Pro models are equipped with accelerated PCI 
slots. And although the current Mac Pro includes a pair of powerful GPUs (graph-
ics processing units), they aren’t upgradeable. There are no Macs in production as 
of this writing with internal PCI slots, but you’ll still be able to add an accelerated 
graphics or other PCI cards to most Mac models using external devices connected 
via Thunderbolt.
I’ve included this topic to get you to at least consider ordering your next Mac with 
an upgraded video subsystem. Many Macs today are available with two levels of 
video subsystem; consider ordering the higher-performance model. Put it this 
way — if you’re thinking about upgrading the video in your current Mac, you’ll 
probably be happier if your next one has the fastest video you can afford.
Visit www.macworld.com for information on the various graphics cards available 
and how they compare. Cards start at around $100 and go up from there. And 
remember, the older your Mac, the greater the performance boost you’ll see.

CHAPTER 24  Ten (or So) Ways to Speed Up Your Mac Experience     433
Get a Solid-State Drive (SSD)
The latest and greatest storage device is a solid-state drive (SSD). It uses flash 
memory in place of a mechanical hard drive’s spinning platters, which means, 
among other things, that it has no moving parts. Another benefit is that an SSD 
performs most operations at up to twice the speed of mechanical drives.
The bad news is that an SSD is more 
expensive — three or more times the 
price per gigabyte — of a mechanical 
hard drive or a hybrid drive with the 
same capacity.
That said, most users report that it’s 
the best money they ever spent on an 
upgrade. I put the biggest one I could 
afford (1TB) in my MacBook Pro and 
I’ll never go back to booting from a 
hard disk.
Honestly, folks, if you’re only going to do one thing to make your old Mac faster, 
this is what you should do: Replace your hard drive with an SSD. Your old Mac will 
do everything faster.
If you can’t afford a big enough SSD, hybrid drives these days have near-SSD spec-
ifications, higher capacities than SSDs, and much lower prices. SSDs are always 
going to be faster, but if you can’t swing one, a hybrid is your second best bet.
Get a New Hybrid Drive
Depending on the age of your Mac, a bigger, faster hybrid drive could provide a 
substantial speedup. Because you have a Mac with an Intel processor (’cause Macs 
with older PowerPC processors can’t run High Sierra), the internal hard drive that 
came with your Mac probably rotates at 5400 RPM, like most Apple hard disks. 
That makes it among the slowest disks money can buy.
But unless you also need more storage space, a new hybrid drive is probably not 
the best way to spend your bucks. An SSD will give you much better performance 
at a much higher cost.

434     PART 7  The Part of Tens
On the other hand, if you have an older model, a faster (and larger) hybrid drive — 
whether FireWire, USB 3, or Thunderbolt — could be just the ticket. USB 3 and 
Thunderbolt are the fastest busses (data pathways) you can use for external devices 
on most modern Macs.
USB 3 and Thunderbolt (and, to a lesser extent, FireWire) are the state of the art 
in connecting devices that need fast transfer speeds. All three connect devices that 
require high-speed communication with your Mac — hard drives, CD burners, 
scanners, camcorders, and such. FireWire is often the fastest bus that an older 
Mac will support natively.
The most recent Mac models that had FireWire used the type called FireWire 800, 
which has a different type of connector than does FireWire 400, which was avail-
able on older Macs. If you get a device that has only FireWire 400, and your Mac 
has only FireWire 800 (or vice versa), everything will work as long as you get a 
FireWire 400–to–FireWire 800 adapter cable, available at the Apple Store and 
many other places.
Thunderbolt, which is available on Mac models introduced since 2012, is the fast-
est bus around by far. That said, there are still relatively few Thunderbolt periph-
erals at this writing. Furthermore, the Thunderbolt devices that are out there are 
somewhat more expensive than their USB 3 counterparts. Although Thunderbolt 
shows tons of promise for the future, at present, Thunderbolt hard drives are 
more expensive than either FireWire or USB 3 drives.
And just to confuse things, all new Macs since 2014 use USB 3 (Universal Serial 
Bus 3), which is many times faster than the previous generations of USB (and 
FireWire).
If you’re buying an external USB drive, get one with USB 3. It isn’t much more 
expensive than a USB 2 drive these days and is speedy on Macs with USB 3 ports. 
If your Mac doesn’t have USB 3, you should get a USB 3 drive anyway. It’ll run at 
the same speed as a USB 2 drive on your current Mac — and will run a lot faster 
on your new Mac when you upgrade.
If you’re not sure what generation of USB your Mac has, choose   ➪  About This 
Mac, click the System Report button to launch the System Information applica-
tion, and then click USB in the hardware list on the left.

CHAPTER 24  Ten (or So) Ways to Speed Up Your Mac Experience     435
The good news is that whatever connection you choose for your new disk — USB 
2, USB 3, Thunderbolt, FireWire 400 or 800 — you can usually just plug it in and 
start using it. Unless the disk is preformatted for a PC and requires reformatting, 
there’s nothing more you have to do!
The new MacBook (not the MacBook Pro or MacBook Air; this is the newest model, 
which is just called a MacBook) has USB 3, and also has a new USB port known as 
a USB-C port.
The USB-C port, which is the only type of port on the MacBook (and it has only 
one), is used for recharging as well as connecting peripherals. Because the port is 
incompatible with every other type of USB cable ever made, you’ll need a USB-C 
adapter (or USB-C hub or dock) to connect most of your old USB devices to your 
new MacBook.

Ten Great Websites  
for Mac Freaks
A
s much as I would love to think that this book tells you everything you 
need to know about using your Mac, I know better. You have a lot more 
to discover about using your Mac, and new tools and products come out 
every single day.
The best way to gather more information than you could ever possibly soak up 
about all things Mac is to hop onto the web. There you can find news, freeware and 
shareware (try-before-you-buy software) to download, troubleshooting sites, tons 
of news and information about your new favorite OS, and lots of places to shop.
The sites in this chapter are the best, most chock-full-o’-stuff places on the web 
for Mac users. By the time you finish checking out these websites, you’ll know so 
much about your Mac and macOS High Sierra that you’ll feel like your brain is in 
danger of exploding. On the other hand, you might just feel a whole lot smarter. 
Happy surfing!
The Mac Observer
www.macobserver.com
The Mac Observer gives you Apple news, views, reviews, and much more.
Chapter 25

438     PART 7  The Part of Tens
Disclosure: I write a weekly column for The Mac Observer. But I loved The Mac 
Observer long before I wrote a word for it. Its best feature is that it offers insight-
ful opinion pieces in addition to the usual Apple news and product reviews. In my 
humble opinion, the quality and depth of the writing by the TMO staff is superior 
to most other sites covering the Apple beat.
Macworld
www.macworld.com
Although the print publication ceased to exist years ago, this site still describes 
itself as: “Your best source for all things Apple.” And it’s still mostly true. Mac-
world is perhaps the best and most comprehensive source of product information 
for Apple products. It’s especially strong for reviews of Mac, iPhone, and iPad 
products. For example, when you want to know which inkjet printer or digital 
camera is the best in its price class, Macworld can almost certainly offer guidance, 
feature comparison charts, and real-world test results. And you won’t merely find 
product information here — you’ll find it accompanied by expert opinions and 
professional editing and fact checking.
Put another way, I trust the writers and editors at Macworld more than I trust 
the writers and editors of many other Mac-oriented websites. Any other Mac-
oriented sites, that is, except the others in this chapter.
TidBITS
http://tidbits.com
TidBITS is an online newsletter and website with the motto: “Apple News for the 
Rest of Us since 1990.” With some of the most insightful and detailed writing on 
the web, TidBITS is another must-read for me. I always look forward to reading 
the latest issue (which comes out every Monday) as well as articles posted regu-
larly throughout the week.
Disclosure: I have known the proprietors of TidBITS, Adam and Tonya Engst, since 
the 1980s and consider them friends. That said, they’ve prospered and grown 

CHAPTER 25  Ten Great Websites for Mac Freaks     439
for nearly 25 years (check out TidBITS’s inexpensive and excellent Take Control 
series of e-books) because Adam, Tonya, and all TidBITS contributors are still as 
passionate about sharing information about Apple products and services as they 
were in 1990.
I recommend subscribing to the email newsletter so that you get a new issue every 
Monday, like I do. But even if you don’t choose to subscribe, you should check out 
the site; TidBITS is one of my all-time faves.
AppleWorld.Today
www.appleworld.today
For the latest in Mac news, updated every single day, check out AppleWorld.
Today, which arose from the ashes of The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW) after 
its untimely demise. With an excellent staff of Apple newshounds, this site keeps 
you on the bleeding edge of Mac news — including software updates, virus alerts, 
and Apple happenings. It also offers extensive and unbiased reviews of many 
products soon after their release.
I consider AppleWorld.Today essential for keeping up with what’s new and cool 
for your Mac — and I have since its inception in 2014.
Download.com
http://download.cnet.com/mac
For free software or shareware, check out the CNET Download site’s Mac  
Downloads section. It’s one of the best sites in the world for software to use with 
High Sierra (or any version of macOS, for that matter). It’s also terrific for getting 
the latest version of any kind of software: commercial, shareware, and/or free-
ware. Download.com is a virtual treasure-trove of software and updates, and it’s 
worth visiting even when you aren’t looking for anything in particular.
I love this site and try to visit it several times a week. (I know  — I should  
get a life.)

Alltop
http://mac.alltop.com
Alltop aggregates news from a variety of websites you select and serves them up in 
an appealing format that allows you to scan a large number of headlines and sum-
maries from a wide variety of sources in a very short time. This is a case where a 
picture is worth 1,000 words, as shown in Figure 25-1.
Figure 25-1 shows the custom Alltop page I created at http://my.alltop.com/
levitus so I could scan the headlines of my favorite websites quickly and easily. 
My cursor is hovering over an item in The Mac Observer (note that the item is red 
and all others are black).
Also note the little summary-in-a-box to the item’s right, which appears only 
when you hover the cursor over that story. That’s Alltop’s killer feature, at least 
in my humble opinion.
FIGURE 25-1: 
Hover the

CHAPTER 25  Ten Great Websites for Mac Freaks     441
You can build your own customized Alltop page at http://my.alltop.com.
By the way, Alltop isn’t just for Mac news. There are Alltop pages for a plethora of 
subjects, including the following:
»
» Marketing: http://marketing.alltop.com
»
» Science: http://science.alltop.com
»
» Gadgets: http://gadgets.alltop.com
»
» Filmmaking: http://filmmaking.alltop.com
And literally hundreds more. Alltop has become one of my favorite places to keep 
track of what’s going on in technology today.
Apple Support
www.apple.com/support
Do you have a technical question about any version of Mac OS or any Apple  
product — including macOS High Sierra? March your question right over to the 
Apple Support page, where you can find searchable archives of tech notes, soft-
ware update information, and documentation. The Support pages are especially 
useful if you need info about your old Mac; Apple archives all its info here. Choose 
among a preset list of topics or products, and type a keyword to research. You’re 
rewarded with a list of helpful documents. Clicking any one of these entries 
(they’re all links) takes you right to the info you seek. The site even has tools that 
can help narrow your search.
The site also offers a section with user discussions of Apple-related topics. 
Although not officially sanctioned or monitored by Apple, it’s often the best place 
to gain insights, especially on slightly esoteric or obscure issues not covered in 
other sections of the site.
Other World Computing
www.macsales.com
Other World Computing has become the go to place for Mac peripherals and it’s 
my first stop when I need RAM, hard drives, SSDs, optical drives, video cards, 

442     PART 7  The Part of Tens
processor upgrades, cables, discs, or anything else you can think of. If it enhances 
your Mac, Other World Computing probably has it at a reasonable price. And, if it’s 
memory or internal storage, this site includes a pretty good illustrated installation 
manual and (often) installation video.
Because of its inexpensive and reliable delivery and a solid guarantee of every 
item, you can’t go wrong buying from OWC. I’d say I buy at least half my storage 
devices and most of my RAM from these guys, and I trust them more than most 
of the others.
EveryMac.com
www.everymac.com
The author of this site claims that it’s “the complete guide to every Mac, iPod, 
iPhone, iPad, and Mac clone in the world, with technical, configuration, and pric-
ing info.”
You can’t argue with that (unless you’ve done a staggering amount of research). 
Check out the Forum and Q&A sections (recently updated for High Sierra) for 
answers to Mac-related questions.
dealmac
www.dealmac.com
Shopping for Mac stuff? Go to dealmac (see Figure 25-2) first to find out about sale 
prices, rebates, and other bargain opportunities on upgrades, software, peripher-
als, and more.
“How to go broke saving money,” this site boasts, and if you’re a bargain hunter, 
it’s not far from the truth. Check out the deals in Figure 25-2 and tell me you 
wouldn’t consider most (if not all) of those prices a bargain.

About the Author
Bob LeVitus, often referred to as “Dr. Mac,” has written or co-written more than 
80 popular computer books, with millions of copies sold worldwide, including 
iPhone For Dummies, iPad For Dummies, and versions of OS X For Dummies and macOS 
For Dummies covering every cat- and California locale–named operating system 
Apple has ever released, all for John Wiley & Sons, Inc., of course.
Bob has penned the popular Dr. Mac column for the Houston Chronicle since 1996 
and the Dr. Mac’s Rants & Raves column for the Mac Observer for almost as long. 
He has also written thousands of articles, reviews, and columns for dozens of 
newspapers and magazines over the past 30 years. His achievements have been 
documented in major media around the world, and yes, that was him juggling a 
keyboard in USA Today many years ago!
Bob is known for his Apple expertise, trademark humorous style, and ability to 
translate techie jargon into usable and fun advice for regular folks. He is a prolific 
public speaker, presenting more than 100 Macworld Expo training sessions in the 
United States and abroad, Macworld keynote addresses in three countries, and 
Macintosh training seminars in many U.S. cities. (He also won the Macworld Expo 
MacJeopardy World Championship three times before retiring his crown.)
From 1986 to 1989 Bob served as Editor-in-Chief of the first desktop-published 
Mac magazine, The MACazine; from 1989 to 1997, he was a contributing editor/
columnist for MacUser magazine, writing the Help Folder, Beating the System, 
Personal Best, and Game Room columns at various times.
Bob’s latest venture is Working Smarter for Mac Users, a website, blog, e-book, online 
training, and consultancy aimed at helping Mac users become more productive. 
He’d love for you to check it out at www.workingsmarterformacusers.com.
Prior to giving his life over to computers, Bob worked in advertising at Kresser/
Craig/D.I.K., a Los Angeles advertising agency and marketing consultancy, and 
its subsidiary, L & J Research. He holds a B.S. in marketing from California State 
University.
Dedication
For the eighty-something-th time (I’ve lost count), this book is dedicated to the 
love of my life, my wife and best friend for over 35 years, Lisa LeVitus, who has 
taught me pretty much everything I know about pretty much everything I know 
aside from technology. You still rock my world, honey!

And, again for the umpteenth time, this book is also dedicated to my adult-dren 
(grown up children), Allison and Jacob, who love their Apple gadgets almost as 
much as I love them (the kids, of course, not the gadgets).
Author’s Acknowledgments
A tip of the hat to super-agent, Carole “Swifty” Jelen, who has represented me for 
as long as I’ve been writing books — almost 25 years — and is still the world’s 
greatest literary agent.
Special thanks to everyone at Apple who helped me turn this book around in record 
time — I couldn’t have done it without you. And super, extra-special thanks to 
Keri Walker—after 25 years of working with her, she’s still the nicest PR person 
I’ve ever worked with.
Big-time thanks to the gang at Wiley: Steve “Firefighter” Hayes; my superb edi-
tor, Susan Pink; my terrific tech editor, Ryan Williams; my invaluable proofreader, 
Debbye Butler, and everyone else at Wiley who put their heart and soul into get-
ting this book to you.
Thanks also to my family and friends for putting up with my cranky demeanor 
during my all-too-lengthy hibernation sessions during this book’s gestation.
Super-special thanks to Saccone’s Pizza, almost any local craft-brewed IPA, The 
Noble Sandwich, J. Mueller Meat Company, Hops & Grain’s The One They Call Zoe, 
Black’s Barbecue, and Torchy’s Tacos, for sustenance during the writing process.
And last but certainly not least, thanks to you, gentle reader, for buying this book.
