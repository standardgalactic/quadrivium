Introduction
W
hen you’re a grammarian, people react to you in 
interesting — and sometimes downright strange — 
ways. An elderly man once asked me about something that 
had puzzled him for eight decades: Why did his church, 
St. Paul’s, include an apostrophe in its name? My nephew 
recently called to inquire whether his company’s sign in 
Times Square should include a semicolon. (I said no, though 
the notion of a two-story-tall neon semicolon was tempting.) 
Lots of people become tongue-tied, sure that I’ll judge their 
choice of who or whom. (They worry needlessly, because I 
consider myself off-duty when I’m not teaching or writing.)
Though you may aspire to be something other than a gram-
marian, knowing how to use proper grammar is always an 
advantage — especially in the workplace. Most jobs that pro-
vide you with a desk (and many jobs that don’t!) demand that 
you know how to communicate in both speech and writing.
If you haven’t yet reached the workplace, now’s the best time 
to master good grammar. No matter what subject you’re study-
ing, teachers favor proper English. Also, the SAT includes a 
writing section that’s heavy on grammar and, ironically, light 
on writing.
In this book, I show you the tricks of the grammar trade, the 
strategies that help you make the right decision when you’re 
facing such grammatical dilemmas as the choice between I 
and me or was and were. I explain what you need to do in 
such situations, and I also tell you why a particular word is 
correct or incorrect. You don’t have to memorize a list of 
meaningless rules (with the exception of some points from 
the punctuation chapter) because when you understand the 
reason for a particular choice, you’ll pick the correct word 
automatically.

About This Book
I concentrate on what English teachers call the common 
errors. You don’t have to read this book in order, and you 
don’t have to read the whole thing. Just browse through the 
table of contents and look for things that you often get wrong. 
Or start with Chapter 1, which outlines the usage issues voted 
“most likely to succeed” — in giving you a headache. When 
you recognize something that nags you every time you write, 
jump to the chapter where I explain how to handle it like 
a pro.
Conventions Used in This Book
When I introduce a term or concept that may be unfamiliar to 
you, I italicize it so you know I’m aware that jargon is at hand. 
I quickly follow it up with an explanation or definition so you 
can continue on with the topic.
Foolish Assumptions
I assume that you already speak English to some extent and 
that you want to speak it — and write it — better. I also 
assume that you’re a busy person with better things to do 
than worry about pronouns. This book is for you if you want
 
✓ Better grades
 
✓ Skill in communicating exactly what you mean
 
✓ A higher-paying or higher-status job
 
✓ Speech and writing that presents you as an educated, 
intelligent person
 
✓ A good score on the SAT I Writing or the ACT exam
 
✓ Polished skills in English as a second language

Icons Used in This Book
In the left margins of this book, you find the following four 
icons, each of which highlights a particular type of material:
 
This icon points out a nugget of information you’ll want to 
recall later, so make room for it in your mental filing cabinet.
 
Are you hoping to spend some time behind ivy-covered walls? 
To put it another way: Are you aiming for college? If so, you 
should pay special attention to the information next to this 
icon, because college-admissions testers love this material.
 
Wherever you see this icon, you’ll find helpful strategies for 
understanding sentence structure or choosing the correct word.
 
Not every grammar trick has a built-in trap, but some do. This 
icon tells you how to avoid common mistakes.
Where to Go from Here
Need some pointers on how to improve your writing — fast? 
Jump to Chapter 11. Want to refresh your memory regarding 
punctuation regulations? Head straight for Chapter 7. Not sure 
where to begin? Chapter 1 can help.
I truly don’t mind where you start — just allow me one last 
word before you do. Actually, two last words: Trust yourself. 
You already know a lot. If you’re a native speaker, you’ve com-
municated in English all your life, including the years before 
you set foot in school and saw your first textbook. If English 
is an acquired language for you, you’ve probably already 
absorbed a fair amount of vocabulary and grammar, even if 
you don’t know the technical terms.
I’m just here to help you refine what you know and get past 
any grammar gremlins that haunt you. So if the word grammar 
usually makes you sweat, wipe your brow and remember that 
nothing in this book is too difficult for you to master.


Chapter 1
Grasping Grammar 
Nitty-Gritty
In This Chapter
▶ Defining what grammar means
▶ Identifying the problems grammar can solve
▶ Bringing grammar into the real world
I
’m well aware that you’ve been studying grammar in one 
form or another for a lot of years. You may have been in 
first or second grade when a teacher introduced the notion 
that different words in a sentence do different things: Some 
words name people, animals, and objects, for example, and 
other words indicate what those people, animals, and objects 
are doing.
If you were blessed with brilliant, enlightened teachers, your 
experience with grammar has led you to understand not only 
how to use it but also why it’s essential. However, because 
you’re holding this book in your hands, I suspect that may not 
have been the case. More likely, you were blessed with caring, 
dedicated teachers who followed a pattern of instruction 
handed down to them from teachers past. That pattern likely 
focused on memorizing parts of speech and diagramming 
sentences. And here you are, years later, trying to recall what 
indirect objects are and why you should care.
In this chapter, I explain how I approach the study of gram-
mar in this book. A clue: I honestly don’t care whether you 
can identify an indirect object (a part of speech I describe in 
Chapter 4). I do, however, care a great deal about your ability 
to construct a complete sentence that communicates informa-
tion clearly and meets the needs of your audience.

Grammar: What It Is!
In the Middle Ages (a few years before I went to school), 
grammar meant the study of Latin, the language of choice for 
educated people. In fact, grammar was so closely associated 
with Latin that the word referred to any kind of learning. This 
meaning of grammar shows up when people of grandparent age 
talk about their grammar school, not their elementary school. 
The term grammar school is a leftover from the old days.
These days, grammar is the study of language — specifically, 
how words are put together. Because of obsessive English teach-
ers and their rules, grammar also means a set of standards that 
you have to follow in order to speak and write better. However, 
the definition of better changes according to your situation, your 
purpose, and your audience. (I discuss this subject more in the 
final section of this chapter, as well as in Chapter 11, where I 
offer tips on how to become a better writer.)
Actually, several different types of grammar exist, including his-
torical (how language has changed through the centuries) and 
comparative (how languages differ from or resemble each other). 
In this book, I deal with only two types of grammar — the two 
you need to know in order to improve your speech and writing:
 
✓ Descriptive grammar: This type of grammar gives names 
to the parts of speech and parts of a sentence. When you 
learn descriptive grammar, you understand what every 
word is (its part of speech) and what every word does 
(its function in the sentence).
 
 Knowing some grammar terms can help you understand 
why a particular word or phrase is correct or incorrect, 
so I sprinkle descriptive grammar terms throughout this 
book. However, you don’t need to be able to explain the 
difference between a participle and a gerund to use them 
correctly. My main purpose is to show you how to put 
words together in appropriate ways so you can write 
a school assignment, a report for work, or any other 
formal communication effectively. That’s why descriptive 
grammar plays second fiddle in this book to the type I 
describe in the next bullet.

 Chapter 1: Grasping Grammar Nitty-Gritty

✓ Functional grammar: The bulk of this book is devoted to 
functional grammar, which shows you how words behave 
when they’re doing their jobs properly. Functional gram-
mar guides you to the right expression — the one that 
fits what you’re trying to say — by ensuring that the sen-
tence is put together correctly. When you’re agonizing 
over whether to say I or me, you’re solving a problem of 
functional grammar.
So here’s the formula for success: A little descriptive grammar 
plus a lot of functional grammar equals better grammar overall.
The Big Ideas of Grammar
When you get right down to it, the study of grammar is the 
study of three key issues: choosing the right words to get 
your point across to a reader or listener, putting those words 
in the right order, and (when you’re writing) inserting the cor-
rect punctuation marks (commas, apostrophes, and so on) 
in the correct places. In this section, I explain why each issue 
matters so much.
Making the right word choices
This issue is an umbrella that covers many grammar gremlins. 
Four of the biggest are selecting verb forms that match the 
subjects in your sentence, using the right pronouns, decid-
ing between adjectives and adverbs, and choosing wisely 
between two (or more) words that sound similar or seem to 
be interchangeable (but aren’t).
Creating subject-verb harmony
Say you’re writing a sentence that describes what three 
people are doing:
Ralph, Lulu, and Stan is skipping through the woods.
Do you detect a problem? Even if you can’t put your finger on 
what’s wrong, you probably realize that something about this 
sentence doesn’t sound right. That “something” is the verb is, 
which doesn’t get along with Ralph, Lulu, and Stan.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
8
In grammatical terms, what you have here is a subject-verb dis-
agreement. The subject of a sentence is the noun (person, place, 
thing, or idea) that is doing or being something. The verb is the 
part of the sentence that explains what the subject is doing.
To make the multiple (or plural) subjects in this sentence play 
nice with the verb, you must change is to are:
Ralph, Lulu, and Stan are skipping through the woods.
Subject-verb agreement can get complicated sometimes, and 
I devote Chapter 2 to refreshing your memory about how 
to identify subjects and verbs and how to create harmony 
between them.
Selecting pronouns
Allow me to tell you a riveting story:
My brother and me went to the store yesterday to look 
for some new dish towels. We looked in every department 
but couldn’t find it anywhere. We asked a salesman for 
help, but they couldn’t answer our question.
Aside from “riveting” being an out-and-out lie, can you figure 
out what’s wrong with this story? This example contains three 
grammatical errors, all of which are problems with pronoun 
selection.
 
A pronoun is a word that substitutes for a noun, and figuring 
out which pronoun to use in a sentence can sometimes be 
truly challenging. Choosing incorrectly can offend your 
reader’s ear and also create confusion.
To correct this story, you need to make the following changes 
(shown in italics):
My brother and I went to the store yesterday to look for 
some new dish towels. We looked in every department 
but couldn’t find them anywhere. We asked a salesman for 
help, but he couldn’t answer our question.
Not sure why you need I instead of me or he instead of they? 
Chapter 3 offers a detailed discussion of how to make good 
pronoun choices; be sure to check it out.

Describing nouns and verbs with the right words
The reason you’re reading this chapter is because you want 
to write good, right? Actually, no. What you really want to do 
is to write well. The grammatical explanation is that good is 
always an adjective: a word used to describe nouns. Well, on 
the other hand, is usually an adverb: a word that describes a 
verb or modifies an adjective. But even if you never memorize 
the grammatical reason, you must know when to use good and 
when to use well.
Likewise, you need to know when to use an adjective versus 
when to use an adverb. Luckily, Chapter 6 provides all the 
details, so you’ll never again feel bad (as opposed to badly) 
about your writing.
Choosing between similar words
If you’re going to write well, your word choices have to be 
correct. In some cases, you choose among several words 
that sound alike. In others, you choose between two words 
that most people (incorrectly) believe to be interchangeable. 
Sometimes the choices are tricky, but if you spend some time 
reading Chapter 9, I can help.
Arranging words for optimal 
understanding
In this book, I commit a particular grammatical sin that 
wouldn’t be acceptable in a more formal type of writing: I 
write fragments, which are incomplete sentences. Like this 
one. And this one.
The opposite of a fragment is a run-on sentence: one that 
keeps going long after it should have stopped. For example, 
I create a run-on if I use a comma to try to join two complete 
sentences, I should use a semicolon or a conjunction (such as 
and, or, or but) instead. (That was intentional, mind you. I do 
have my certified grammarian’s license.)
Fragments and run-ons are two problems writers grapple with 
when trying to create complete sentences. Other problems 
can be a bit tougher to identify, such as combining ideas of 
unequal importance in ways that make them seem equal. 
Consider an example:

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
10
First idea: I tripped and broke my leg.
Second idea: I was chewing gum.
Combination: I tripped and broke my leg, and I was 
chewing gum.
Technically, the combined sentence is okay. But are you 
really helping the reader understand what happened here? 
Just by changing and to a different connecting word, you can 
clarify what happened. For example:
I tripped and broke my leg while I was chewing gum.
I tripped and broke my leg because I was chewing gum.
I devote Chapter 4 to a thorough discussion of how to create 
complete sentences that provide the reader with an appropri-
ate amount of information arranged in a helpful way.
Chapter 5 tackles still more issues related to word arrangement, 
such as making sentences parallel. Take a look at a sentence that 
isn’t parallel:
My goal is to study economics, Arabic, and impress 
my boss.
What you’re saying is that you plan to study three things, the 
third being “impress my boss.” Huh? By making the sentence 
parallel, you clarify for your reader what you actually mean:
My goal is to study economics, learn Arabic, and impress 
my boss.
By adding learn, you start each of the three items in your list 
with a verb, which makes the sentence parallel.
Chapter 5 deals with several other word arrangement issues as 
well, with the goal of helping you create clear, consistent writing.
Pinpointing punctuation
Its a real shame, when you write a perfectly fine sentence; 
and mess it up with ‘improper’ punctuation.

 Chapter 1: Grasping Grammar Nitty-Gritty 11
 
We all need occasional reminders about how to use punctua-
tion marks. So many rules exist, and not all of them make 
logical sense. Your job is not to argue the logic; it’s to apply 
the rules to every sentence you write. If you don’t, your boss, 
teacher, or other authority figure is likely to dismiss your writ-
ten observations because he or she won’t be able to look past 
the errors to discover your brilliance.
To impress someone with your writing, you simply must know 
the punctuation rules and use punctuation marks correctly. 
That’s why I suggest getting very cozy with Chapter 7. After all,
It’s a real shame when you write a perfectly fine sentence 
and mess it up with improper punctuation.
Oh, and if you ever get confused about when to use capital 
letters and when to stick with lowercase, be sure to check out 
Chapter 8.
Putting Grammar to Work 
in the Real World
The grammar lessons in this book are useless if they don’t 
stick with you when you sit down to write. I strongly sug-
gest keeping this book handy as a reference whenever you’re 
working on an assignment or report; I don’t expect you to 
memorize every punctuation or capitalization rule.
However, I work hard to bring the lessons in this book to life 
for you by providing lots of examples. The goal is for your 
“ear” — the part of your brain that can tell whether something 
you’ve written sounds right or wrong — to get lots of practice 
identifying common problems.
You can improve your grammar ear in lots of easy ways every 
day. Chapter 12 offers ten simple suggestions that range from 
reading good books, newspapers, and magazines to listening 
to news radio programs and watching quality TV shows in 
which the characters use proper English. (Think the History 
Channel, for example — not so much The Sopranos.)

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
12
The more you read and listen, the easier you’ll be able to 
identify situations in which formal (or standard) English is 
required and situations in which you can relax the rules a bit. 
In Chapter 11, I explain the differences between formal and 
conversational English and note that just about any important 
communication requires formal English.
 
You may have the impression, for example, that you can relax 
the grammar rules when you’re writing an e-mail or a text 
message. But as I explain in Chapter 11, the medium convey-
ing your message isn’t the deciding factor; your audience is. 
Who is going to read your e-mail or text message? Your best 
friend? Break as many grammar rules as you want. Your boss 
or teacher? Keep it formal. Even if you suspect that the indi-
vidual won’t mind a conversational tone, you don’t want to 
risk a miscommunication, and you don’t want a grammatically 
lax e-mail to be forwarded. Save yourself any potential embar-
rassment or hassle: Keep it formal.
Chapter 11 offers lots of other suggestions for improving your 
writing as well, including choosing juicy verbs and eliminating 
repetition. But in the end, the only way to improve your writing 
is to write. Reading a book — even one as astute and inspiring as 
this one — can take you only so far. Practice is essential, so dedi-
cate a small amount of time every day to improving your speech 
and writing. Before long, you may start noticing billboards, store 
signs, and even newspaper headlines with grammatical errors. 
At that point, you’ll be ready to apply for your official grammar-
ian’s license, too. (Calm down, now — your heart may not be 
able to handle this much excitement.)

Chapter 2
Making Peace between 
Subjects and Verbs
In This Chapter
▶ Sorting out the different kinds of verbs
▶ Finding the subject of a sentence
▶ Getting subjects and verbs to agree
▶ Considering some tricky subject-verb scenarios
I
n every sentence, you find two key pieces of information: 
an action or a state of being, and the someone or some-
thing that is doing that action or experiencing that state of 
being. The acting or being part is expressed by a verb. The 
someone or something part is represented by a subject.
You probably have lots of experience finding subjects and 
verbs; that task begins in early elementary school and doesn’t 
let up until you’re holding a diploma. That’s why I don’t go 
into great depth explaining what subjects and verbs are in 
this chapter; I just offer some rapid reminders.
I then move on to making subjects and verbs agree with each 
other. That task is a bit more difficult, and the presence of 
certain subjects and verbs makes it even more challeng-
ing. I cover the trickiest types of subject/verb pairings here 
because I assume they’re likely the reason you’re cozying up 
with this chapter.
If your subjects and verbs have disagreed in the past, fear not: 
This chapter can help you get them working in harmony.

Getting Reacquainted 
with Verbs
All sentences contain verbs — words that express action or a 
state of being. Verbs come in all shapes and sizes. In this sec-
tion, I remind you how to distinguish between linking and action 
verbs and how to sort helping verbs from main verbs. I also 
touch on compound verbs and some tricky verb imposters: 
infinitives.
Linking verbs: The giant equal sign
Linking verbs are also called being verbs because they express 
states of being: what is, will be, or was. Here’s where math 
intersects with English: Linking verbs are like giant equal 
signs plopped into the middle of your sentence. For example, 
you can think of the sentence
Ralph’s uncle is a cannibal with a taste for finger food.
as
Ralph’s uncle = a cannibal with a taste for finger food.
Or, in shortened form,
Ralph’s uncle = a cannibal.
The word is links two ideas and says that they’re the same. 
Thus, is is a linking verb. Here are more linking verbs:
Lulu will be angry when she hears about the missing 
bronze tooth. (Lulu = angry; will be is a linking verb.)
Stan was the last surfer to leave the water when the tidal 
wave approached. (Stan = the last surfer; was is a linking 
verb.)
Edgar has been depressed ever since the fall of the House 
of Usher. (Edgar = depressed; has been is a linking verb.)

 Chapter 2: Making Peace between Subjects and Verbs 15
You may have noticed that all the linking verbs in the sample 
sentences are forms of the verb to be. That’s not always the 
case, though. Check out these examples of other linking verbs:
With his foot-long fingernails and sly smile, Big Foot 
seemed threatening. (Big Foot = threatening; seemed is a 
linking verb.)
A jail sentence for the unauthorized use of a comma 
appears harsh. (jail sentence = harsh; appears is a linking 
verb in this sentence.)
The penalty for making a grammar error remains severe. 
(penalty = severe; remains is a linking verb in this sentence.)
Loch Ness stays silent whenever monsters are mentioned. 
(Loch Ness = silent; stays is a linking verb in this sentence.)
Seemed, appears, remains, and stays are similar to forms of the 
verb to be in that they express states of being. They simply 
add shades of meaning to the basic concept.
 
Sensory verbs — verbs that express information you receive 
through sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch — may also be 
linking verbs:
Two minutes after shaving, Ralph’s double chin feels 
scratchy. (Ralph’s double chin = scratchy; feels is a linking 
verb.)
The 10-year-old lasagna in your refrigerator smells dis-
gusting. (lasagna = disgusting; smells is a linking verb.)
 
Verbs that refer to the five senses are linking verbs only if 
they act as an equal sign in the sentence. If they don’t equate 
two ideas, they aren’t linking verbs. In the preceding example 
sentence about Ralph’s double chin, feels is a linking verb. 
Here’s a different sentence with the same verb:
With her delicate fingers, Lulu feels Ralph’s chin.
In this sentence, feels is not a linking verb because you’re not 
saying that
Lulu = chin.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
16
Instead, you’re saying that Lulu doesn’t believe that Ralph 
shaved, so she goes stubble hunting. In this case, feels is an 
action verb (which I explain next).
 
Bottom line: Any verb that figuratively places an equal sign in 
the sentence is a linking verb.
Action verbs: The go-getters
Linking verbs are important, but unless you’re in some sort 
of hippie commune left over from the ’60s, you just can’t sit 
around being all the time. You have to do something. Here’s 
where action verbs come into the picture. Everything that is 
not being is action, at least in the verb world. Unlike the giant 
equal sign associated with linking verbs, something happens 
with an action verb:
Drew slapped the offending pig right on the snout. 
(Slapped is an action verb.)
Fred will steal third base as soon as his sneezing fit ends. 
(Will steal and ends are action verbs.)
According to the teacher, Roger has shot at least 16 spit-
balls in the last ten minutes. (Has shot is an action verb.)
 
Don’t let the name action fool you. Some action verbs aren’t 
particularly energetic: think, sit, stay, have, sleep, and dream 
are examples. Think of the definition this way: If the verb is 
not a giant equal sign (a linking verb), it’s an action verb.
Helping verbs: The do-gooders
Some of the verbs I identify in this chapter are single words, 
and others are made up of two or more words. The extra words 
are called helping verbs. They don’t take out the trash or dust 
the living room, but they do help the main verb express mean-
ing, usually by changing the time, or tense, of the action.
Here are some sentences with helping verbs:
Alice will have sung five arias from that opera by the time 
her recorder runs out of tape. (In will have sung, sung is 
the main verb; will and have are helping verbs. Later in 
the sentence, runs is a main verb without a helping verb.)

 Chapter 2: Making Peace between Subjects and Verbs 17
Larry should have refused to play the part of the villain, 
but his ego simply would not be denied. (In should have 
refused, refused is the main verb; should and have are help-
ing verbs. In would be denied, denied is the main verb; 
would and be are helping verbs.)
Distinguishing between helping verbs and main verbs isn’t 
particularly important, as long as you get the whole thing when 
you’re identifying the verb in a sentence. If you find only part of 
the verb, you may confuse action verbs with linking verbs.
 
To decide whether you have an action verb or a linking verb, 
look at the main verb, not at the helping verbs. If the main 
verb expresses action, the whole verb is action, even if one of 
the helpers is a form of to be. For example,
is going
has been painted
should be strangled
are all action verbs, not linking verbs, because going, painted, 
and strangled express action.
Doubling your money: 
Compound verbs
You can pair a single subject in a sentence with two (or more) 
verbs. For example:
Justin’s ex-girlfriend burped and cried after the contest.
You have two actions (burped, cried) and one person doing 
both (ex-girlfriend).
In grammatical terms, these double verbs are called com-
pound verbs. Here are two more examples:
George snatched the atomic secret and quickly stashed it 
in his navel. (snatched, stashed = verbs)
Ella ranted for hours about Larry’s refusal to hold an 
engagement party and then crept home. (ranted, crept = 
verbs)

Infinitives: Verb imposters
You may hear English teachers say “the verb to sweep” or 
some such expression. In fact, in this chapter I refer to “the 
verb to be.” But to be is not actually a verb; it’s an infini-
tive. An infinitive is to + a verb. Other examples of infinitives 
include to laugh, to sing, to burp, to write, and to think.
 
The most important thing to know about infinitives is this: 
When you need to find the verb of a sentence, don’t choose an 
infinitive as your answer. If you do, you’ll miss the real verb or 
verbs in the sentence. Other than that, forget about infinitives!
 
Okay, you can’t forget about infinitives completely. Here’s 
something else you should know about infinitives in formal 
English: Don’t split them in half. For example, you commonly 
see sentences like the following:
Matt vowed to really study if he ever got the chance to 
take the flight instructor exam again.
This example is common, but incorrect. Grammatically, to 
study is a unit — one infinitive. You’re not supposed to sepa-
rate its two halves. Now that you know this rule, read the 
newspaper. Everybody splits infinitives, even the grayest, 
dullest papers with no comics whatsoever. So you have two 
choices: You can split infinitives all you want, or you can 
follow the rule and feel totally superior to the professional 
journalists. The choice is yours.
Identifying Subjects
All sentences contain verbs — words that express action or a 
state of being. But you can’t have an action in a vacuum. You 
can’t have a naked, solitary state of being, either. Someone or 
something must also be present in the sentence — the who or 
what that you’re talking about in relation to the action or state of 
being that the verb expresses. This someone or something doing 
the action or experiencing the state of being is the subject.
A someone is a person, of course, and a something must be a 
thing, place, or idea. That means the subject is usually a noun, 
because a noun is a person, place, thing, or idea. I say usually 

 Chapter 2: Making Peace between Subjects and Verbs 19
because sometimes the subject is a pronoun — a word that 
substitutes for a noun (such as he, they, or it). For details on 
pronouns, check out Chapter 3.
Subjects aren’t always as straightforward as they seem. In the 
following sections, I explain some of the finer points of sub-
jects, including how to find the subject when it appears to be 
missing or in hiding.
Getting two for the price of one: 
Compound subjects
Earlier in the chapter I explain that you can have compound 
verbs — two or more verbs in a sentence that connect with 
a single subject. Well, guess what? You can also have two or 
more subjects that connect with one verb. The multiple sub-
jects are called compound subjects. Here’s an example:
Dorothy and Justin went home in defeat.
The sentence features one action (went) and two people 
(Dorothy, Justin) doing the action. You have two subjects.
Here are two more examples:
Lola and Lulu ganged up on George yesterday. (Lola, Lulu = 
subjects)
The omelet and fries revolted Stella. (omelet, fries = 
subjects)
Figuring out you-understood
“Cross on the green, not in between.”
“Eat your vegetables.”
“Don’t leave your chewing gum on the bedpost overnight.”
What do these sentences have in common? Yes, they’re all 
nagging comments you’ve heard all your life. More to the 
point, they’re all commands. The verbs give orders: cross, eat, 
don’t leave. So where’s the subject in these sentences?

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
20
If you know that the verbs are cross, eat, and don’t leave, your 
next step is to figure out who is doing the crossing, eating, 
and not leaving. Who is it? Uh . . .
This question appears to have no answer, but appearances 
can be deceiving. The answer is you. You cross on the green. 
You eat your vegetables. You don’t leave your chewing gum 
on the bedpost overnight. What’s that you say? You is not in 
the sentence? True. You is not written, but it’s implied. And 
when your mom says, “Eat your vegetables,” you understand 
that she means you.
Grammarians say that the subject in this type of sentence is 
you-understood. The subject is you, even though you isn’t in 
the sentence (and even though you don’t intend to eat any 
lima beans).
Finding subjects when 
words are missing
In the never-ending human quest to save time, words are 
often chopped out of sentences. The assumption is that the 
sentence is still understandable because the listener or reader 
supplies the missing piece. (Not a bad assumption, as long 
as you understand what you can chop and what you need to 
leave alone.) Check out these examples:
If caught, Roger will probably deny everything.
Lulu snored when dreaming of little sheep.
Do you understand what these sentences mean? Here they are 
again, with the missing words inserted and italicized:
If he is caught, Roger will probably deny everything.
Lulu snored when she was dreaming of little sheep.
In both cases, the subject and part of the verb are missing 
in the subordinate clauses of these sentences. (In Chapter 
4, I explain that subordinate clauses can’t stand on their own 
as complete sentences. “If he is caught” and “when she was 
dreaming of little sheep” are the subordinate clauses in these 
examples.) In cases like this, the reader fills in the missing 
information.

 Chapter 2: Making Peace between Subjects and Verbs 21
 
You need to remember only one rule for these sentences: The 
missing subject must be the same as the subject that is pres-
ent. In other words, if your sentence lacks more information, 
the reader or listener will assume that you’re talking about 
the same person or thing in both parts of the sentence. Here’s 
an example:
Wrong: If caught, his mother assumes that Roger will 
deny everything.
Unintended meaning: Roger’s mother is the evildoer.
A sentence like this may be most easily corrected by stating 
the subject in both parts of the sentence:
Correction: If Roger is caught, his mother assumes that 
he’ll deny everything.
Grappling with unusual 
word order
Most of the sentences you encounter are in the normal 
subject-verb order, which is (gasp) subject-verb. In other 
words, the subject usually comes before the verb. However, not 
every sentence follows that order. Sometimes a subject hides 
out at the end of the sentence or in some other weird place. 
(Hey, even a subject needs a change of scenery sometimes.)
 
No matter where the subject is hiding, you can find it by 
asking yourself the same question that always applies: Who or 
what is doing the action (or experiencing the state of being) in 
the sentence?
Try this example:
Up the avenue and around the park trudged Godzilla on 
his way to tea with the Loch Ness Monster.
What’s the verb in the sentence? Trudged — it’s the action. 
Who or what trudged? Godzilla did, so Godzilla is the subject. 
(I’ll let you decide whether Godzilla is a who or a what.)
If you were answering by word order, you’d say park. But the 
park did not trudge; Godzilla trudged. Pay attention to meaning, 
not to placement in the sentence, and you can’t go wrong.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
22
Searching for the subject 
in questions
Does everyone love grammar? Don’t answer that! I started this 
section with that sentence not to check your attitude toward 
grammar (I’d rather not know) but to illustrate the subject’s 
favorite location in a question. You form most questions in 
English by adding a helping verb — do, does, will, can, should, 
and so forth — to a main verb. The subject is generally tucked 
between the helping verb and the main verb, but you don’t 
have to bother remembering that fascinating bit of trivia.
To locate the subject in a question, simply ask the same ques-
tion you’d ask with any other sentence: Who or what is doing 
the action (or experiencing the state of being)? In the example 
of “Does everyone love grammar?” the verb is does love. Who is 
doing that action? The answer is everyone — that’s your subject.
 
When you’re identifying the subject of a question, the ques-
tions you ask yourself may sound a little odd. Why? Because 
in a question, the subject usually isn’t located in front of the 
verb. But if you ignore the awkwardness of the phrasing and 
concentrate on meaning, you can easily — and correctly — 
identify the subject of a question.
Tossing fake subjects aside
Someone comes up to you and says, “Here is one million dol-
lars.” What’s the first question that comes into your mind? I 
know, good grammarian that you are, that your question is, 
“What’s the subject of that sentence?” Well, try to answer 
your question in the usual way, by first identifying the verb. 
What’s the action or state of being in this sentence? The 
answer: is. Okay, so who or what is?
What did you say? Here is? Wrong. Here can’t be a subject. 
Neither can there. Both of these words are fake subjects. (Here 
and there are adverbs, not nouns. See Chapter 6 for more on 
adverbs.) What’s the real answer to the question “What is”? 
One million dollars. Here and there are fill-ins, or place markers; 
they aren’t what you’re talking about. One million dollars — 
that’s what you’re talking about!

 Chapter 2: Making Peace between Subjects and Verbs 23
Give Peace a Chance: Making 
Subjects and Verbs Agree
Hollywood filmmakers and about a million songwriters have 
tried to convince people that opposites attract. Grammarians 
have clearly not gotten that message! The English language 
prefers matching pairs: singular with singular and plural with 
plural. Matching, in grammar terminology, is called agreement.
In this section, I show you how to make subjects and verbs 
agree. I first offer some easy examples of matching singular 
subjects with singular verbs and plural subjects with plural 
verbs. I then show you what happens when you’re dealing 
with verbs that aren’t exactly straightforward. And finally, I 
highlight some special cases — treacherous nouns and pro-
nouns that are often mismatched.
 
By the way, subject-verb agreement travels so often to the 
SAT Writing and ACT English tests that it should earn fre-
quent flyer miles. Test-takers, take note!
No mixing allowed: 
Singles and plurals
You must always pair singular subjects with singular verbs 
and plural subjects with plural verbs. Check out these 
examples:
The ugly duckling hates the mirrored room. (duckling = 
singular subject; hates = singular verb)
The plastic elf is still sitting on the store shelf. (elf = singu-
lar subject; is sitting = singular verb)
Hedge clippers are always a thoughtful gift. (clippers = 
plural subject; are = plural verb)
We plan to redecorate next summer. (we = plural subject; 
plan = plural verb)

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
24
 
How do you know whether a subject-verb pair should be singu-
lar or plural? Focus on the subject first. Determine the number 
of subjects performing the action of the sentence. If the subject 
is singular, the verb must be singular; if the subject is plural, 
the verb must be plural. You then find a verb that matches — a 
task that, as I explain next, isn’t always simple.
Verbs that change and 
verbs that don’t
If you’re a native speaker of English, your ear helps you cor-
rectly match singular and plural subjects to their verbs most 
of the time. But even if English isn’t your first language, you 
probably pair up lots of subjects and verbs correctly. That’s 
because most verb tenses use the same form for both singular 
and plural verbs.
Note that I don’t delve into an explanation of verb tenses here; 
frankly, you don’t need to know how to label a verb tense in 
order to use it. I refer to the labels in case doing so helps jog a 
distant memory, but if it doesn’t, just focus on the examples.
Following are some examples of the verb to snore in various 
tenses that use the same form for both singular and plural 
subjects:
Larry snored constantly, but his cousins snored only 
occasionally.
Ella will snore if she eats cheese before bedtime, but 
her bridesmaids will snore only after a meal containing 
sardines.
Cedric had snored long before his tonsils were removed. 
His pet tigers had snored nightly before Cedric upgraded 
their diet.
By the time this chapter is over, Lola will have snored for 
at least an hour, and her friends will have snored for an 
even longer period.
Unfortunately, not all verbs (in all tenses) stay the same when 
you shift from a singular subject to a plural subject. (If that were 
the case, we grammarians wouldn’t be such a hot commodity.)

 Chapter 2: Making Peace between Subjects and Verbs 25
 
With regular verbs in the present tense, the difference 
between the singular and plural forms is often just one letter. 
The singular verb ends in s and the plural form doesn’t. Here 
are some examples:
Singular
Plural
the tiger bites
the tigers bite
Lulu rides
they ride
she screams
the boys scream
Loch Ness burps
both burp
 
Verbs that end in -ing (called progressive tense, in case you’re 
curious) can cause singular/plural problems. They rely on 
the verb to be, a grammatical weirdo that changes drastically 
depending on its subject. Just be sure to match the subject of 
the sentence to the correct form of the verb to be. Check out 
these examples of -ing forms of the verb to bite:
 
✓ Singular present: I am biting, you are biting, Dracula is 
biting, no one is biting.
 
✓ Plural present: We are biting, you are biting, the tigers 
are biting, they are biting.
 
✓ Singular past: I was biting, you were biting, Dracula was 
biting, no one was biting.
 
✓ Plural past: We were biting, you were biting, the tigers 
were biting, both were biting.
Some lovely verb tenses called the present perfect and the 
future perfect contain forms of the verb to have. Match the sub-
ject of the sentence to the correct form of to have, and you’ll 
be good to go:
 
✓ Present perfect: I have bitten, I have been biting, you have 
bitten, you have been biting, Dracula has bitten, Lola has 
been biting, we have bitten, we have been biting, the tigers 
have bitten, the tigers have been biting.
 
✓ Future perfect: I will have bitten, I will have been biting, 
you will have bitten, you will have been biting, Dracula

bitten, we will have been biting, the tigers will have bitten, 
the tigers will have been biting.

As the examples in this section demonstrate, the word you 
is both singular and plural. I can say, “You are crazy” to my 
neighbor when he claims that bacon is low in fat. I can also 
say, “You are crazy” to all those people who think Martians 
constructed the pyramids. In either case, I use the plural form 
of the verb (are). The fact that you is both singular and plural 
may be responsible for the popularity of such terms as you all, 
y’all, youse (very big in New York City), you guys (ditto), and 
you people. These terms are colorful but not correct in formal 
English. Because you use you for both singular and plural sub-
jects, you make the meaning clear with context clues:
Today you must all wear clothes to the Introduction to 
Nudism class because the heat is broken.
“I must have you and only you!” cried Larry to his soon-to-
be sixth wife.
Dealing with negative statements
You form some present-tense negative statements by adding 
do or does, along with the word not, to a main verb. The not 
squeezes itself between the helper (do or does) and the main 
verb. Remember that does is always singular. The helping verb 
do may be paired with the singular subjects I and you, and it’s 
also used with all plural subjects. Here are some examples:
Larry does not drive a sports car, because he wants to 
project a wholesome image.
The killer bees do not chase Roger, because they are 
afraid of him.
I do not want to learn anything else about verbs ever 
again.
You do not dance like that in this club!
To form past-tense negative statements, the helping verb did 
is all you need for both singular and plural subjects:
Roger did not dance all night.
Lola and Lulu did not send a package of killer bees to 
Roger.

 Chapter 2: Making Peace between Subjects and Verbs 27
Negative statements in the future tense are easy as well. The 
helping verbs shall and will are the same for both singular and 
plural:
Roger will not write a thank-you note to Lola.
The killer bees will not shy away from Larry.
Cutting through distractions
Subjects and their verbs are like parents and babies on a 
stroll through the park; they always travel together. A pass-
erby cooing at a baby may catch the kid’s attention, but 
ultimately, the passerby is a distraction — irrelevant to the 
essential parent-child bond. The sentence world has lots of 
passersby that show up, slip between a subject and its verb, 
and distract you.
 
When you’re trying to make your subjects and verbs agree, 
the best strategy is to identify distractions and then cross 
them out (at least mentally) to get to the bare bones of the 
sentence: the subject-verb pair.
 
The most common distractions, but not the only ones, are 
prepositional phrases. A prepositional phrase contains a preposi-
tion (on, to, for, by, and so on) and an object of the preposition (a 
noun or pronoun). These phrases may contain some descriptive 
words as well. Other distractions may be clauses or participles. 
(For more information on prepositional phrases, see Chapter 10. 
I cover clauses and participles in Chapter 4.)
In the following sentences, I added some camouflage. The dis-
tractions (not all prepositional phrases) are italicized.
The accountant with 10,000 clients and only two assistants 
works way too hard. (accountant = subject; works = verb)
In this sentence, accountant is the singular subject. If you pay 
attention to the prepositional phrase, you may incorrectly focus 
on clients and assistants as the subject — both plural words.
The FBI agent, fascinated by my last three tax returns, is 
ruining my vacation plans. (agent = subject; is ruining = 
verb)

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
28
By ignoring the distracting phrase about my tax returns in this 
sentence, you can easily pick out the singular subject-verb pair.
The deductions, not the tax rate, are a problem. (deduc-
tions = subject; are = verb)
In this sentence, deductions is the plural subject. If you let 
yourself be distracted, you may incorrectly match your verb 
to rate, which is singular.
 
Ignore all distracting phrases and find the true subject-verb 
pair. Also, if any IRS employees are reading this book, please 
ignore my tax returns.
Coming to an Agreement 
with Difficult Subjects
Every family has at least one “difficult” relative — the one 
nobody wants to sit with on Thanksgiving. In this respect, 
English grammar resembles a family. Sadly, you can’t dump 
your crazy relatives, nor can you ignore the difficult subject-
verb scenarios I describe here.
Spotting five little pronouns 
that break the rules
In the preceding section I told you to ignore prepositional 
phrases when trying to make your subjects and verbs agree. 
Now I must confess that this rule has one small exception — 
well, five small exceptions. Five pronouns — five little words 
that just have to stir up trouble — change from singular to 
plural according to the prepositional phrases that follow 
them. The five troublemaking pronouns are
 
✓ All
 
✓ Any
 
✓ Most

 Chapter 2: Making Peace between Subjects and Verbs 29
 
✓ None
 
✓ Some
 
A good way to remember these five important words is with 
this nonsense sentence:
Alice’s aunt makes nice salads. (Alice’s = all, aunt = any, 
makes = most, nice = none, salads = some)
Here are these pronouns with some prepositional phrases and 
verbs. Notice how the prepositional phrase affects the verb 
number.
Singular
Plural
all the pie is
all the shoes are
any of the information is
any of the magazines are
most of the city is
most of the pencils are
none of the pollution is
none of the toenails are
some of the speech is
some of the politicians are
 
See the pattern? For these five words, the prepositional 
phrase is the determining factor. If the phrase refers to a 
plural idea, the verb is plural. If the phrase refers to a singular 
idea, the verb is singular.
Finding problems here and there
As I note earlier in the chapter, sentences that begin with here 
or there can trip up your efforts to work with subjects and 
verbs. (See the section “Tossing fake subjects aside.”) In the 
following examples, the subject-verb pairs are italicized:
Here is the baby parakeet that just bumped his head on 
the window.
There are no flying schools for birds.
 
As you see, the words here and there aren’t italicized. These 
words are never subjects! The true subject in this type of 
sentence comes after the verb, so that’s where you look when 
you’re making a subject-verb match.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
30
Meeting the ones, the things, 
and the bodies
The Ones, the Things, and the Bodies are families of pronouns 
that delight in mischief-making. They can be deceptive when 
you’re trying to match them with verbs. (Pairing them with 
other pronouns can cause some trouble too; I address that 
topic in Chapter 3.) Take a peek at the family tree:
The Ones: one, everyone, someone, anyone, no one
The Things: everything, something, anything, nothing
The Bodies: everybody, somebody, anybody, nobody
These pronouns are always singular, even if they’re sur-
rounded by prepositional phrases that express plurals. You 
must match these pronouns with singular verbs. Take a look 
at these examples:
So everybody is happy because no one has caused any 
trouble, and anything goes.
Anyone in the pool of candidates for dogcatcher speaks 
better than Lulu.
One of the million reasons to hate you is your tendency to 
split infinitives.
Not one out of a million spies creates as much distraction 
as George.
Two other pronouns are also a pain when the issue is subject/
verb agreement. Each and every are very powerful words; 
they’re strong enough to change any subject following them 
into a singular idea. Consider these examples:
Each shoe and sock is in need of mending, but Larry 
refuses to pick up a needle and thread.
Every dress and skirt in that store is on sale, and Lulu is in 
a spending mood.

 Chapter 2: Making Peace between Subjects and Verbs 31
Do these sentences look wrong to you? Granted, they 
appear to have plural subjects: two things (shoe and sock) 
in sentence one, and another two things (dress and skirt) in 
sentence two. But when each or every is placed in front of a 
group, you take the items in the group one at a time. In the 
first sample sentence, the subject consists of one shoe, one 
sock, another shoe, another sock, and so on. Therefore, the 
sentence needs a singular verb to match the singular subject. 
Ditto for the dress and skirt reference in the second example.
Figuring out either and neither
Two more pain-in-the-pick-your-body-part pronouns are 
either and neither when they’re without their partners or and 
nor. When they’re alone, either and neither are always singu-
lar, even if you insert a huge group (or just a group of two) 
between them and their verbs. Hence,
Either of the two armies is strong enough to take over the 
entire planet.
Neither of the football captains has shown any willingness 
to accept Lola as quarterback.
Because the sample sentences are about armies and captains, 
you may be tempted to choose plural verbs. Resist the temp-
tation! No matter what the sentence says, if the subject is 
either or neither, singular is the correct way to go.
However, when either and neither appear with their best buds, 
or and nor, two things happen. First, either and neither turn into 
conjunctions (joining words). Second, if they’re joining two sub-
jects, the subject that’s closer to the verb determines whether 
the verb is singular or plural. Yes, that’s right! This is a grammar 
problem you can solve with a ruler. Check out these examples:
Either Ella or her bridesmaids have eaten the icing on the 
cake. (bridesmaids = closest subject, a plural; have eaten = 
plural verb)
Neither the waiters nor Larry is planning to eat the left-
overs. (Larry = closest subject, a singular; is planning = 
singular verb)

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
32
Most sentences that are questions have helping verbs, and 
the helpers are the part of the verb that changes. Never fear: 
This is still grammar by ruler. The subject closest to the part 
of the verb that changes governs the singular/plural decision. 
Take a look at these examples:
Does either Ella or her cousins want antacids? (Ella = 
subject closest to the helping verb does; Ella = singular 
subject; does want = singular verb)
Do neither her cousins nor Ella know how to cook? (cousins 
= subject closest to the helping verb do; cousins = plural 
subject; do know = plural verb)

Pronoun Usage

P
ronouns are words that substitute for nouns. Even 
though they’re useful, pronouns can also be pesky 
because English has many different types of pronouns, each 
governed by its own set of rules. In this chapter I concentrate 
on how to avoid the most common errors associated with this 
part of speech.
Playing Matchmaker with 
Pronouns and Nouns
To make the right pronoun choices, first take a close look at 
how pronouns are paired with nouns. A pronoun’s meaning 
can vary from sentence to sentence. Think of pronouns as 
the ultimate substitute teachers: One day they’re solving qua-
dratic equations, and the next they’re doing push-ups in the 
gym. Such versatility comes from the fact that pronouns don’t 
have identities of their own; instead, they stand in for nouns. 
In a few situations, pronouns even stand in for other pro-
nouns. I discuss pronoun-pronoun pairs later in this chapter.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
34
To choose the appropriate pronoun, you must consider the 
word that the pronoun is replacing, which is called the pro-
noun’s antecedent.
Identifying the pronoun-antecedent pair is really a matter of 
reading comprehension. If the sentence (or in some cases, 
the paragraph) doesn’t make the pronoun-antecedent connec-
tion clear, the writing is faulty. Time to edit! But in most cases 
the meaning of the pronoun leaps off the page. Take a look at 
some examples:
Hal stated his goals clearly: He wanted to take over the 
world. (The pronouns his and he refer to the noun Hal.)
The lion with a thorn in her paw decided to wear sneakers 
the next time she went for a walk in the jungle. (The pro-
nouns her and she refer to the noun lion.)
Our cause is just! Down with sugarless gum! We demand 
that all bubble gum be loaded with sugar! (The pronouns 
our and we refer to the speakers, who aren’t named.)
Larry, who types five or six words a minute, is writing a new 
encyclopedia. (The pronoun who refers to the noun Larry.)
Ameba and I demand that the microscope be cleaned 
before we begin the exam. (The pronoun I refers to the 
speaker. The pronoun we refers to Ameba and I.)
 
When analyzing a sentence, you seldom find a noun that’s 
been replaced by the pronouns I and we. The pronoun I 
always refers to the speaker, and we refers to the speaker and 
someone else.
Similarly, the pronoun it sometimes has no antecedent:
It is raining.
It is obvious that Sylvia has not won the card-flipping 
contest.
In these sentences, it is just a place-filler.
 
Sometimes the meaning of the pronoun is explained in a previ-
ous sentence:
Ted’s ice cream cone is cracked. I don’t want it. (The pro-
noun it refers to the noun cone.)

 Chapter 3: Perfecting Your Pronoun Usage 35
Selecting Singular or 
Plural Pronouns
All pronouns are either singular or plural. Singular pronouns 
replace singular nouns, which are those that name one 
person, place, thing, or idea. Plural pronouns replace plural 
nouns — those that name more than one person, place, thing, 
or idea. (Grammar terminology has flair, doesn’t it?) A few 
pronouns replace other pronouns; in those situations, sin-
gular pronouns replace other singular pronouns, and plurals 
replace plurals. You need to understand pronoun number — 
singulars and plurals — before you place them in sentences. 
Look at Table 3-1 for a list of the singular and plural pronouns 
you’ll encounter most often.
Table 3-1 
Common Singular and 
 
Plural Pronouns

me

Notice that some of the pronouns in Table 3-1 do double duty; 
they take the place of both singular and plural nouns or pro-
nouns. Lest you think this double duty makes your life easier, 
flip to Chapter 2 for the ins and outs of matching singular and 
plural subjects with their verbs.

Letting your ear be your guide
Most of the time, choosing between singular and plural pro-
nouns is easy. You’re not likely to say
Gordon tried to pick up the ski poles, but it was too heavy.
That’s because ski poles (plural) and it (singular) don’t match. 
Instead, you say
Gordon tried to pick up the ski poles, but they were too 
heavy.
Matching ski poles with they should please your ear.
 
If you’re learning English as a second language, your ear for the 
language is still in training. Put it on an exercise regimen of at 
least an hour a day of careful listening. A radio station or a TV 
show in which reasonably educated people are speaking will 
help you to train your ear (see Chapter 12 for ideas). You’ll soon 
become comfortable hearing and choosing the proper pronouns.
Treating companies 
as singular nouns
 
Company and business names sometimes sound plural — for 
example, Saks, Lord and Taylor, and AT&T. However, a com-
pany is just one company and is, therefore, a singular noun. 
When you refer to the company, use the singular pronoun 
it or its, not the plural pronouns they or their. Take a look at 
these sentences, in which the singular pronouns are italicized:
Dombey and Sons often sends its employees on business 
trips.
It is offering a free vacation in the Caribbean to all its clerks.
 
If a singular pronoun sounds strange, you may adjust the sen-
tence to refer to the employees. Sometimes you cut the pro-
noun entirely. Here’s an example:
Strange: I returned the sweater to Sheldon & Daughters 
Department Store, and it offered me a refund.

 Chapter 3: Perfecting Your Pronoun Usage 37
Better-sounding but wrong: I returned the sweater to 
Sheldon & Daughters Department Store, and they offered 
me a refund.
Better-sounding and right: I returned the sweater to 
Sheldon & Daughters Department Store, and the sales rep-
resentative offered me a refund.
Steering clear of “person” 
problems
Two nouns — people and person — often confuse writers. 
People is plural and pairs with plural pronouns:
The people who scratched their names on the screen will 
be penalized.
Person is singular, as is any pronoun referring to person:
The person who left his or her chewing gum on the com-
puter screen is in big trouble.
 
If you’re writing a sentence similar to the preceding example, 
you may be tempted to match their with person. Resist the 
temptation. In Grammar World, singular and plural don’t 
mingle, at least not legally.
Many people fall into this trap because they think “his or her” 
is cumbersome but they’re afraid to choose just “his” or just 
“her.” Later in the chapter, in the section “Avoiding Sexist 
Pronouns,” I explain your options for making a word choice in 
this situation that won’t earn you the label “sexist.”
Getting Possessive with 
Your Pronouns
Possessive pronouns — those all-important words that indi-
cate who owns what — also have singular and plural forms. 
You need to keep them straight. Table 3-2 helps you identify 
each type.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
38

The stickiest issues with possessive pronouns center around 
four pairs of words: your/you’re, their/they’re, whose/who’s, 
and its/it’s. Because creating the possessive form of a noun 
involves adding an apostrophe plus s to the end of the word 
(think the lion’s paw or the cat’s meow), many people assume 
that their possessive pronouns should contain apostrophes 
as well. As I detail in Chapter 9, that assumption will get 
you in serious trouble. Using you’re, they’re, who’s, or it’s as 
possessive pronouns is just plain wrong (and can cause fits 
among us grammatical types).
Keeping Your Pronouns 
and Antecedents Close
One way to lose a reader is to let your pronouns wander far 
from the words they refer to — their antecedents. To avoid 
confusion, keep a pronoun and its antecedent near each 
other. Often, but not always, they appear in the same sen-
tence. Sometimes they’re in different sentences. Either way, 
the idea is the same: If the antecedent of the pronoun is too 
far away, the reader or listener may become confused. Check 
out this example:

 Chapter 3: Perfecting Your Pronoun Usage 39
Bernie picked up the discarded paper. Enemy ships were 
all around, and the periscope’s lenses were blurry. The 
sonar pings sounded like a Mozart sonata, and the cap-
tain’s hangnails were acting up again. Yet even in the 
midst of such troubles, Bernie was neat. It made the deck 
look messy.
It? What’s the meaning of it? You almost have to be an FBI 
decoder to find the noun partner of it (paper). Try the para-
graph again:
Enemy ships were all around, and the periscope’s lenses 
were blurry. The sonar pings sounded like a Mozart sonata, 
and the captain’s hangnails were acting up again. Yet even 
in the midst of such troubles, Bernie was neat. He picked up 
the discarded paper. It made the deck look messy.
Now the antecedent and pronoun are next to each other. 
Much better!
 
Some people believe that position alone is enough to explain 
a pronoun-antecedent pairing. It’s true that a pronoun is more 
likely to be understood if it’s placed near the word it represents. 
In fact, you should form your sentences so that the pairs are 
neighbors. However, position isn’t always enough to clarify the 
meaning of a pronoun. Standardized test writers want to know 
whether you can write clearly and express exact meaning, so 
they hit you with quite a few pronoun-antecedent problems.
The best way to clarify the meaning of a pronoun is to make 
sure that only one easily identifiable antecedent may be 
represented by each pronoun. If your sentence is about two 
females, don’t use she. Instead, provide an extra noun to clar-
ify your meaning.
Look at this sentence:
Helena told her mother that she was out of cash.
Who is out of cash? The sentence has one pronoun — she — 
and two females (Helena, her mother). She could refer to either 
of the two nouns.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
40
 
The rule here is simple: Be sure that your sentence has a 
clear, understandable pronoun-antecedent pair. If you can 
interpret the sentence in more than one way, rewrite it, using 
one or more sentences until your meaning is clear:
Helena said, “Mom, can I have your ATM card? I looked in 
the cookie jar and you’re out of cash.”
or
Helena saw that her mother was out of cash and told 
her so.
Question: What does the following sentence mean?
Alexander and his brother went to Arthur’s birthday 
party, but he didn’t have a good time.
 
A. Alexander didn’t have a good time.
 
B. Alexander’s brother didn’t have a good time.
 
C. Arthur didn’t have a good time.
Answer: Who knows? Rewrite the sentence, unless you’re talk-
ing to someone who was actually at the party and knows that 
Arthur got dumped by his girlfriend just before his chicken-
pox rash erupted and the cops arrived. If your listener knows 
all that, the sentence is fine. If not, here are a few possible 
rewrites:
Alexander and his brother went to Arthur’s birthday 
party. Arthur didn’t have a good time.
or
Arthur didn’t have a good time at his own birthday party, 
even though Alexander and his brother attended.
or
Alexander and his brother went to Arthur’s birthday 
party, but Arthur didn’t have a good time.

 Chapter 3: Perfecting Your Pronoun Usage 41
Pairing Pronouns with 
Pronoun Antecedents
Most of the time, determining whether a pronoun should be 
singular or plural is easy. Just check the noun that acts as the 
antecedent, and bingo, you’re done. But sometimes a pronoun 
takes the place of another pronoun. The pronouns being 
replaced are particularly confusing because they’re singular 
yet they look plural. In this section I tackle the hard cases, 
showing you how to handle these tricky pronouns when 
they’re antecedents. (The same pronouns sometimes cause 
problems with subject-verb agreement; see Chapter 2.)
Wrestling with everybody, 
somebody, and no one
Everybody, somebody, and no one (not to mention nothing and 
everyone): These words should be barred from the English 
language. Why? Because matching these pronouns to other pro-
nouns is a problem. If you match correctly, your choices sound 
wrong. But if you match incorrectly, you sound right. Sigh.
 
Here’s the deal. All of these pronouns are singular:
 
✓ The ones: one, everyone, someone, anyone, no one
 
✓ The things: everything, something, anything, nothing
 
✓ The bodies: everybody, somebody, anybody, nobody
These pronouns don’t sound singular. Everybody and everyone 
appear to represent a crowd. Nevertheless, you’re in singular 
territory with these pronouns. The logic (yes, logic actually 
applies) is that everyone talks about the members of a group 
one by one. You follow this logic, probably unconsciously, 
when you choose a verb. You don’t say,
Everyone are here. Let the party begin!
Instead, you say,
Everyone is here. Let the party begin!

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
42
 
Picking the correct verb comes naturally, but picking the cor-
rect pronoun doesn’t. Check out this pair:
Everyone was asked to bring their bubble gum to the 
bubble-popping contest.
Everyone was asked to bring his or her bubble gum to the 
bubble-popping contest.
Which one sounds right? The first one, I bet. Unfortunately, 
the second one is correct, formal English. The bottom line: 
When you need to refer to ones, things, or bodies in formal 
English, choose singular pronouns to match (he/she, his/her) 
and avoid using their.
Following each and every rule
Each and every time I explain this rule, someone objects. 
As with everybody, the proper use of each and every sounds 
wrong. These two pronouns are singular, and any pronouns 
that refer to each and every must also be singular. Check out 
these examples, in which I’ve italicized the pronouns referring 
to each and every:
Each of the motorcycles should have its tires checked.
Every motorcycle with leaky tires will have its inspection 
sticker removed.
Every car, truck, and motorcycle on the road must display 
its inspection sticker on the windshield.
Each of the owners must repair his or her motorcycle 
immediately.
Did you groan? Are you arguing with me? I understand. But 
I can’t change the rule, which is based on the idea that each 
and every separate the members of the group into compo-
nents. Any pronoun referring to each and every is actually 
referring to a member of the group, not to the group as a 
whole. Hence, you’re in singular territory.

 Chapter 3: Perfecting Your Pronoun Usage 43
Examining either and neither
These two pronouns sometimes share a sentence with or and 
nor. But in this section I don’t deal with either/or and neither/
nor combos. For advice on handling that sort of sentence, turn 
to Chapter 5. Here I talk about either and neither alone, when 
these pronouns — and any pronouns referring to them — are 
always singular.
In the following sentences, the pronouns that refer to either 
and neither are italicized:
Either of my daughters is willing to shave her head.
Neither of the drill sergeants wants to deal with his fear of 
bald women.
Either of the commanders must issue his or her order 
regulating hair length.
By the way, the last sentence assumes that you have a male 
and a female commander, or that you don’t know whether 
the commanders are male, female, or a mixed pair. For more 
information on avoiding sexist pronouns, check out the next 
section.
Avoiding Sexist Pronouns
In preparing to write this section, I typed “pronoun + gender” 
into a Web search engine and then clicked “search.” I wanted 
a tidbit or two from the Internet about the use of nonsexist 
language. I got more than a tidbit. In fact, I got over 7 million 
hits. I can’t believe that so many people are talking about pro-
nouns! Actually, talking is not the appropriate word. Arguing, 
warring, facing off, cursing, and a few other less polite terms 
come to mind.
Here’s the problem: For many years, the official rule was that 
masculine terms (those that refer to men) could refer to men 

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
44
only or could be universal, referring to both men and women. 
This rule is referred to as the masculine universal. For exam-
ple, in an all-female gym class the teacher would say,
Everyone must bring her gym shorts tomorrow.
and in an all-male gym class the teacher would say, 
Everyone must bring his gym shorts tomorrow.
Employing the masculine universal, in a mixed male-and-
female gym class, the teacher would say,
Everyone must bring his gym shorts tomorrow.
 
Judging by the Internet, the battles over this pronoun issue 
aren’t likely to be over in the near future. My advice? I 
think you should say he or she and his or her when gram-
mar requires such terms. The masculine universal excludes 
females and may offend your audience. However, if you’re 
writing a longer work and find my suggestion cumbersome, 
consider your audience and decide whether using he/his/him 
or she/her throughout would be acceptable.
To sum up, if you need a pronoun (or pronouns) to refer to 
both men and women, you may say,
Everyone must bring his or her gym shorts tomorrow.
or
All the students must bring their gym shorts tomorrow.
or
Bring your gym shorts tomorrow, you little creeps!
All these examples are grammatically correct and allow you to 
avoid the masculine universal.

Creating Complete Sentences 
from Complete Thoughts
In this section, I spell out the required elements for any com-
plete sentence: a subject-verb pair and a complete thought. 

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
46
Often, to achieve a complete thought, a sentence requires one 
or more complements (no, I don’t mean you must praise the 
sentence for its lovely verbs — that would be a compliment). I 
explain the four types of complements here as well.
Locating subject-verb pairs
A complete sentence has at least one subject-verb pair. If you 
can’t find a subject and a verb that belong together (a topic I 
discuss in Chapter 2), you don’t have a complete sentence.
Complete sentences may include more than one subject-verb 
pair:
Dorothy fiddled while the orchestra pit burned. (Dorothy = 
subject of the verb fiddled; orchestra pit = subject of the verb 
burned)
Not only did George swim, but he also sipped the pool 
water. (George = subject of the verb did swim; he = subject 
of the verb sipped)
As I note in Chapter 2, complete sentences may also match 
one subject with more than one verb, and vice versa:
The lizard with a British accent appeared in three com-
mercials but sang in only two. (lizard = subject of the 
verbs appeared and sang)
Alice and Archie will fight endlessly over a single bird-
seed. (Alice and Archie = subjects of the verb will fight)
In some cases, you can imply the subject of a sentence with-
out seeing it. Complete sentences that give commands may 
match an understood subject (you) with the verb:
Give me a coupon. (you-understood = subject of the 
verb give)
 
If you need a refresher on you-understood, you can find it in 
Chapter 2 as well.

 Chapter 4: Constructing a Complete Sentence 47
Not relying on context
A complete sentence must express a complete thought. Here 
are a couple examples of incomplete thoughts:
The reason I wanted a divorce was.
Because I said so.
Granted, both examples may be part of a longer conversation, 
which means that in context, these incomplete thoughts may 
express a complete thought:
Sydney: So the topic of conversation was the Rangers’ 
season opener?
Alice: No! The reason I wanted a divorce was!
and
Sydney: Why do I have to do this dumb homework?
Alice: Because I said so.
You can pull a complete thought out of these examples, but 
a conversation’s context isn’t enough to satisfy the complete 
thought/complete sentence rule. To be legal, your sentence 
must express a complete thought without considering context.
 
In deciding whether you have a complete sentence, you may 
be led astray by words that resemble questions. Consider the 
words who knits well. A complete thought? Maybe, maybe not. 
Suppose these three words form a question:
Who knits well?
This question is understandable, and its thought is complete. 
But suppose these three words form a statement:
Who knits well.
Now they don’t make sense. This incomplete sentence needs 
more words to make a complete thought.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
48
Occasionally, a complete sentence ends with an ellipsis: three 
spaced dots (. . .). Such sentences often show up in dramatic 
works to add suspense or to indicate hesitation or confusion. 
These sentences appear incomplete, but because they fulfill 
the author’s purpose, they are complete. For more on ellipses, 
see “Getting your endmarks in place” later in the chapter.
Fishing for complements
Complements are parts of a sentence that are often — but not 
always — required to create a complete thought. Four kinds 
of complements show up in sentences: direct objects, indirect 
objects, object complements, and subject complements. If 
you never learn their names, that’s fine; the following informa-
tion simply shows you the role these sentence finishers play 
in helping you create complete thoughts.
Receiving the action: Direct objects
Imagine that you throw a baseball and it crashes through 
the picture window in your living room. Your mother yells 
from the kitchen, “What’s going on?” You mutter something 
containing the word broke. (There’s the verb.) “Who broke 
something?” she demands. You concede that you did. (There’s 
the subject.) “What did you break?” You confess: the picture 
window. (There’s the complement.)
You broke the picture window!
Broke is an action verb because it tells you what hap-
pened. The action comes from the subject (you) and goes 
to an object (the window). The window receives the action 
expressed by the verb broke. Conclusion? Window is a direct 
object because it receives the action directly from the verb.
 
You can recognize direct objects more easily if you think of 
them as part of a pattern in the sentence structure: subject 
(S)-action verb (AV)-direct object (DO). This S-AV-DO pattern 
is one of the most common in the English language.

 Chapter 4: Constructing a Complete Sentence 49
A sentence can have more than one direct object. Check out 
these examples:
Al autographed posters and books for his many admirers.
Roger will eat a dozen doughnuts and a few slabs of 
cheesecake for breakfast.
And some sentences have no direct object:
Throughout the endless afternoon and into the lonely 
night, Al sighed sadly.
No one or nothing receives the sighs, so the sentence has no 
direct object. Perhaps that’s why Al is lonely.
Rare, but sometimes there: Indirect objects
Another type of complement is the indirect object. Why indi-
rect? Because the action of the verb doesn’t flow directly to it. 
(I just wrote a fragment — did you catch that?) This comple-
ment is sort of an intermediary between the action verb and 
the direct object.
Knowing that I’m on a diet, my former friend sent me six 
dozen chocolates.
The action is sent. My former friend performed the action, so 
friend is the subject. What received the action? Six dozen choc-
olates. Chocolates is the direct object; it received the action of 
the verb directly. But me also received the action, indirectly. 
Me received the sending of the boxes of chocolate. Me is the 
indirect object.
 
The sentence pattern for indirect objects is subject (S)-action 
verb (AV)-indirect object (IO)-direct object (DO). The indirect 
object always precedes the direct object. In these examples, 
the indirect objects are italicized:
Gloria will tell me the whole story tomorrow. (will tell = 
verb, Gloria = subject, and story = direct object)
Ella sent Larry a sharp message. (sent = verb, Ella = sub-
ject, and message = direct object)

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
50
 
Indirect objects don’t appear very often. When they do show 
up, they’re always in partnership with a direct object. You 
probably don’t need to worry about knowing the difference 
between direct and indirect objects (unless you’re an English 
teacher). As long as you understand that these words com-
plete the meaning of an action verb, you recognize the basic 
composition of a sentence.
No bias here: Object complements
Sometimes a direct object doesn’t get the whole job done. A 
little more information is needed (or just desired), and the 
writer doesn’t want to bother adding a new subject-verb pair. 
The solution? An object complement: an added fact about the 
direct object.
The object complement (italicized in the following sentences) 
may be a person, place, or thing. In other words, it may be a 
noun:
Gloria and others with her worldview elected Roger 
president. (elected = verb, Gloria and others = subject, 
and Roger = direct object)
Al called his dog Al-Too. (called = verb, Al = subject, and 
dog = direct object)
The object complement may also be an adjective, a word that 
describes a noun (see Chapter 6):
Nancy considered her lazy at best. (considered = verb, 
Nancy = subject, and her = direct object)
Roger called George heartless. (called = verb, Roger = 
subject, and George = direct object)
The object complement in each sample sentence gives the 
sentence an extra jolt. You know more with it than you do 
without it.
Finishing the equation: Subject complements
Subject complements are major players in sentences. A link-
ing verb (see Chapter 2) begins a word equation; it expresses 
a state of being, linking two ideas. The complement completes 
the equation. Because a complement following a linking verb 

 Chapter 4: Constructing a Complete Sentence 51
expresses something about the subject of the sentence, it’s 
called a subject complement. In each of the following sen-
tences, the first idea is the subject, and the second idea (itali-
cized) is the complement:
Nerdo is upset by the bankruptcy of the pocket-protector 
manufacturer. (Nerdo = upset)
Gloria was a cheerleader before the dog bite incident. 
(Gloria = cheerleader)
It is I, the master of the universe. (It = I)
Subject complements can take several forms. Sometimes the 
subject complement is a descriptive word (an adjective), and 
sometimes it’s a noun (person, place, thing, or idea) or a pro-
noun (a word that substitutes for a noun).
 
You can’t mix types of subject complements in the same 
sentence, completing the meaning of the same verb. Use all 
descriptions (adjectives) or all nouns and pronouns. Take a 
look at these examples:
Wrong: Gramps is grouchy and a patron of the arts.
Right: Gramps is a grouch and a patron of the arts.
Also right: Gramps is grouchy and arty.
Banning Fragments from 
Formal Writing
I use incomplete sentences, or fragments, here and there 
throughout this book, and (I hope) these incomplete sen-
tences aren’t confusing. People today are much more comfort-
able with fragments than our elderly relatives were. Chances 
are you use fragments frequently when you text or write 
e-mails. If you’re writing for an audience that doesn’t demand 
formal English, fragments that communicate their message 
clearly may work just fine.
The most common type of fragment uses the words and, or, 
but, or nor. These words are conjunctions, and as I explain 
in “Attaching Sentences Legally” later in this chapter, these 

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
52
conjunctions may combine two complete sentences (with two 
complete thoughts) into one longer sentence:
Eggworthy went to his doctor for a cholesterol check, and 
then he scrambled home.
Nowadays, more and more writers begin sentences with and, 
or, but, and nor, especially in informal writing or for dramatic 
effect. For example, the preceding sentence may be turned into
Eggworthy went to his doctor for a cholesterol check. And 
then he scrambled home.
The second sentence is now a fragment.
 
Beginning sentences with and, or, but, and nor is still not 
acceptable in formal English grammar. If you see a sentence 
beginning with one of these words in the error-recognition 
portion of a standardized test, consider it a fragment. When 
you’re writing an essay, you should also avoid fragments.
 
Another common error is to write a fragment that lacks a 
complete thought. This sort of fragment usually begins with 
a subordinate conjunction (see “Making connections with 
subordinate conjunctions” later in this chapter). Here are two 
examples of this type of sentence fragment:
As if he were king of the world.
Whether you like it or not, although I am really sorry that 
you are upset.
 
Don’t let the number of words in sentence fragments fool you. 
As these examples show, some sentence fragments are short, 
and some aren’t. Decide by meaning, not by length.
Enough Is Enough: 
Avoiding Run-ons
While fragments are becoming more acceptable in informal 
writing (as long as they don’t create confusion), run-ons are 
never okay. That’s because they always muddy your meaning 
and leave your reader gasping for breath.

 Chapter 4: Constructing a Complete Sentence 53
In this section, I show you how to avoid run-ons by properly 
punctuating the ends of your sentences. I then introduce a 
common variety of the run-on — the comma splice — and 
show some simple fixes that eradicate it.
Getting your endmarks in place
When you speak, your body language, silences, and tone act 
as punctuation marks. You wriggle your eyebrows, stop at sig-
nificant moments, and raise your tone when you ask a ques-
tion. When you write, you can’t raise an eyebrow or stop for 
a dramatic moment. No one hears your tone of voice. That’s 
why grammar uses endmarks.
 
You need endmarks to close your sentences legally. Without 
them, you create run-ons and confuse your reader. The end-
marks you use most often are the period (.), question mark 
(?), and exclamation point (!). The following examples show 
how to use these endmarks to avoid run-ons.
The period is for ordinary statements, declarations, and 
commands:
The run-on: I can’t do my homework it’s too difficult
The fix: I can’t do my homework. It’s too difficult.
The question mark is (shockingly) for questions:
The run-on: Why are you torturing me with this home-
work can’t you just leave me alone
The fix: Why are you torturing me with this homework? 
Can’t you just leave me alone?
The exclamation point adds a little drama to sentences that 
would otherwise end in periods:
The run-on: Oh, the agony of homework I’ve seen it’s 
enough to make a grown man cry
The fix: Oh, the agony of homework I’ve seen! It’s enough 
to make a grown man cry!
A fourth type of endmark — used less frequently than the 
others — is an ellipsis (. . .). The three dots signal that some-
thing has been left out of a sentence. (When missing words 

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
54
occur at the end of a sentence, you actually use four dots: 
one for the period at the end of the sentence and three for the 
missing words.) For example,
Michael choked, “I can’t do my. . . .”
 
No matter how much you fear run-ons, don’t put more than 
one endmark at the end of a sentence unless you’re trying to 
create a comic effect:
He said my cooking tasted like what?!?!?!
Fixing comma splices
A comma spice is a run-on in which a comma attempts to unite 
two complete thoughts:
Abner will clip the thorns from that rose stem, he is afraid 
of scratching himself.
Fixing a comma splice isn’t tough; you either have to allow the 
thoughts to remain separate or identify a legal way to com-
bine them. The following examples show that using a proper 
endmark (a period) after the first sentence is one option, and 
replacing the comma with a semicolon is another:
Abner will clip the thorns from that rose stem. He is afraid 
of scratching himself.
Abner will clip the thorns from that rose stem; he is afraid 
of scratching himself.
Keep reading to find out why a semicolon is stronger than a 
comma and to discover lots more ways to combine complete 
thoughts legally.
Attaching Sentences Legally
 
Standardized test-makers enjoy plopping run-on sentences 
and comma splices into paragraphs and checking whether 
you can identify the run-ons as grammatically incorrect. 
Teachers who score the writing section of the SAT also frown 
on run-ons and comma splices. The best way to avoid this 
type of grammar error is to figure out how to connect sen-
tences legally, as I detail in this section.

 Chapter 4: Constructing a Complete Sentence 55
Employing coordinate conjunctions
Coordinate conjunctions — and, but, or, nor, for, so, and yet — 
are little powerhouses that join words or longer expressions 
together. They’re strong enough to join complete sentences, 
and they may also unite all sorts of equal grammatical ele-
ments. Here they are in action, joining complete sentences:
The rain pelted Abner’s gray hair, and his green velvet 
shoes were completely ruined.
The CEO told Tanya to text the address of the restaurant to 
everyone, but Tanya had no idea where the restaurant was.
You can take a hike, or you can jump off a cliff.
Ben did not know how to shoe a horse, nor did he under-
stand equine psychology.
The townspeople lined the streets, for they had heard a 
rumor about Lady Godiva.
The coordinate conjunctions give equal emphasis to the ele-
ments they join. In the preceding sentences, the ideas on one 
side of the conjunction have no more importance than the 
ideas on the other side of the conjunction.
 
When the conjunctions and, but, or, nor, and for unite two 
complete sentences, a comma precedes the conjunction. For 
the lowdown on commas, turn to Chapter 7.
 
Some words appear to be strong enough to join sentences, 
but in reality they’re just a bunch of 98-pound weaklings. False 
joiners include however, consequently, therefore, moreover, 
also, and furthermore. Use these words to add meaning to your 
sentences but not to glue the sentences together. When you 
see these words on a standardized exam, be careful! A favorite 
test-maker trick is to plop these words into a run-on:
Run on: Levon gobbled the birdseed, consequently, 
Robbie had nothing to eat.
Corrected version #1: Levon gobbled the birdseed; con-
sequently, Robbie had nothing to eat.
Corrected version #2: Levon gobbled the birdseed. 
Consequently, Robbie had nothing to eat.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
56
Notice the semicolon in the first corrected sentence? 
Semicolons are equivalent to coordinate conjunctions. 
According to the Official Grammarian’s Rule Book (which 
doesn’t exist), semicolons can join two complete sentences 
under certain conditions. See the next section for details.
Relying on semicolons
The semicolon (;) is a funny little punctuation mark; it functions 
as a pit stop between one idea and another. It’s not as strong as 
a period, but a semicolon lets the reader take a rest — just for a 
moment. This punctuation mark is strong enough to attach one 
complete sentence to another.
I’ve seen writing manuals that proclaim, “Never use semico-
lons!” with the same intensity of feeling as, say, “Don’t blow 
up the world with that nuclear missile!” Other people can’t get 
enough of them. As far as I’m concerned, use them if you like 
them, or ignore them if you don’t.
 
If you do put a semicolon in your sentence, be sure to attach 
related ideas. Here’s an example:
Right: Grover was born in Delaware; he moved to Virginia 
when he was 4.
Wrong: I put nonfat yogurt into that soup; I like Stephen 
King’s books.
In the first example, both parts of the sentence are about 
Grover’s living arrangements. In the second, the two ideas 
are, to put it mildly, not in the same universe.
Connecting Unequal Ideas
In the average company, the boss runs the show. The boss 
has subordinates who play two important roles: They must do 
at least some work, and they must make the boss feel like the 
center of the universe. Leave the boss alone in the office, and 
everything’s fine. Leave the employees alone in the office, and 
pretty soon someone is swinging from the light fixture.
Some sentences resemble companies. The “boss” part of a 
sentence is all right by itself; it expresses a complete thought. 

 Chapter 4: Constructing a Complete Sentence 57
The “employee” can’t stand alone; it’s an incomplete thought. 
In case you’re into grammar lingo, the boss is an independent 
clause, and the employee is a dependent or subordinate clause.
 
Independent clauses are okay by themselves, but putting too 
many in a row makes your writing choppy and monotonous. 
Subordinate clauses are never okay by themselves because 
they’re sentence fragments. Together, the boss and the 
employee create more powerful sentences. Check out two 
examples:
Boss: Jack ate the bagel.
Employee: after he had picked out all the raisins.
Joining 1: Jack ate the bagel after he had picked out all 
the raisins.
Joining 2: After he had picked out all the raisins, Jack ate 
the bagel.
Boss: The book bag is in the garage.
Employee: that Larry lost
Joining: The book bag that Larry lost is in the garage.
The joined example sentences are grammatically legal 
because they contain at least one complete thought, which 
can stand on its own as a complete sentence.
Giving subordinate clauses a job
Okay, so subordinate clauses can’t stand alone. What can they 
do? They have three main purposes in life, as you see in the 
following sections.
Describing nouns and pronouns
A subordinate clause may give your listener or reader more 
information about a noun or pronoun in the sentence. Here 
are some examples, with the subordinate clause in italics:
The book that Michael wrote is on the bestseller list. (that 
Michael wrote describes the noun book.)
Anyone who knows Michael well will read the book. (who 
knows Michael well describes the pronoun anyone.)

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
58
Describing verbs, adjectives, or adverbs
Subordinate clauses can also describe verbs, adjectives, 
or adverbs. These subordinate clauses tell you how, when, 
where, or why:
We will probably find out more when the movie version 
is released. (when the movie version is released describes 
the verb will find.)
Michael is so stubborn that he may sue the government. 
(that he may sue the government describes the adverb so.)
Acting as subjects or objects inside another clause
This function is a bit more complicated: Subordinate clauses 
may do any job that a noun does in a sentence. Subordinate 
clauses sometimes act as a subject or object inside another 
clause. Here are some examples:
When the book was written is a real mystery. (When the 
book was written is the subject of the verb is.)
Michael signed copies for whoever bought at least five 
books. (whoever bought at least five books is the object of 
the preposition for.)
Finding homes for your 
subordinate clauses
Correctly placing your subordinate clauses is simple. Clauses 
acting as subjects or objects nearly always fall in the proper 
place automatically. Don’t worry about them!
Put a subordinate clause that describes a noun or pronoun near 
the word that it describes. Here are a few examples of proper 
placement of clauses that describe nouns and pronouns:
Larry’s wedding coordinator took care of every detail; he 
even baked the cakes that Larry’s guests enjoyed. (The itali-
cized clause describes the noun cakes.)
Anyone who is on a diet should stay away from Larry’s 
weddings. (The italicized clause describes the pronoun 
anyone.)

 Chapter 4: Constructing a Complete Sentence 59
If the subordinate clause describes the verb, it usually lands 
at the front or rear of the sentence:
Although Anna understood the equation, she chose to put a 
question mark on her answer sheet. (The italicized clause 
describes the verb chose.)
She wrote the question mark because she wanted to make 
a statement about the mysteries of life. (The italicized 
clause describes the verb wrote.)
Making connections with 
subordinate conjunctions
The conjunctions in the boss-employee type of sentence do 
double duty: They emphasize that one idea is more important 
than the other, and they give some information about the rela-
tionship between the two ideas. These conjunctions are called 
subordinate conjunctions. Some common subordinate conjunc-
tions are while, because, although, though, since, when, where, 
if, whether, before, until, than, as, as if, in order that, so that, 
whenever, and wherever. (Whew!)
Check out how conjunctions are used in these examples:
Sentence 1: Michael was shaving. (not a very important 
activity)
Sentence 2: The earthquake destroyed the city. (a rather 
important event)
If you join these two sentences as equals with a coordinate 
conjunction (see the earlier section “Employing coordinate 
conjunctions”), you emphasize both events:
Michael was shaving, and the earthquake destroyed 
the city.
Grammatically, the sentence is legal. Morally, this state-
ment poses a problem. Is Michael’s avoidance of five o’clock 
shadow equal in importance to an earthquake that measures 

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
60
7 on the Richter scale? Better to join these clauses as 
unequals with the help of a subordinate conjunction, making 
the main idea about the earthquake the boss:
While Michael was shaving, the earthquake destroyed 
the city.
or
The earthquake destroyed the city while Michael was 
shaving.
The while gives you time information, attaches the employee 
sentence to the boss sentence, and shows the greater impor-
tance of the earthquake. Not bad for five letters.
Here’s another:
Sentence 1: Esther must do her homework now.
Sentence 2: Mom is on the warpath.
In combining these two ideas, you have decisions to make. If 
you put them together as equals, the reader will wonder why 
you’re mentioning both statements at the same time:
Esther must do her homework now, but Mom is on the 
warpath.
This joining may mean that Mom is running around the house 
screaming at the top of her lungs. Esther finds that concen-
trating is impossible during Mom’s tantrums and won’t get 
anything done until Mom settles down with a cup of tea. 
That’s one possible meaning of this joined sentence. But why 
leave your reader guessing? Try another joining:
Esther must do her homework now because Mom is on 
the warpath.
This sentence is much clearer: Esther’s mother got a note 
from the teacher. Esther knows that if she wants to survive 
through high school graduation, she’d better get to work now. 
One more joining to check:
Mom is on the warpath because Esther must do her home-
work now.

 Chapter 4: Constructing a Complete Sentence 61
In this version, Esther’s mother has asked her daughter to 
clean the garage. She’s been asking Esther every day for the 
last two years. But Esther told her that she couldn’t clean 
up now because she had to do her homework. World War III 
erupted immediately.
Do you see the power of these joining words? These conjunc-
tions strongly influence sentence meaning.
Combining Sentences 
with Pronouns
A useful trick for combining short sentences legally is “the 
pronoun connection.” (A pronoun substitutes for a noun; see 
Chapter 3.) That, which, and who are the pronouns you use, 
and they serve as thumbtacks, attaching a subordinate or less 
important idea to the main body of the sentence.
Check out this combination:
Sentence 1: Amy read the book.
Sentence 2: The book had a thousand pictures in it.
Joining: Amy read the book that had a thousand pictures 
in it.
In the joined sentence, that takes the place of the noun book. 
You use that because the clause (had a thousand pictures in 
it) is essential to the reader’s understanding of the sentence; 
without it, the reader has no idea which book Amy read. If 
the clause were nonessential, you’d use which (preceded by a 
comma) instead, as in the following example:
Sentence 1: The paper map stuck to Wilbur’s shoe.
Sentence 2: We plan to use the map to take over the world.
Joining: The paper map, which we plan to use to take 
over the world, stuck to Wilbur’s shoe.
Readers may be thrilled to know that you’ll be using the map 
to take over the world, but even without that added informa-
tion, they still know which map you’re talking about (the 
paper one that’s stuck to Wilbur’s shoe).

When does who come into play? When the noun being 
replaced is a person:
Sentence 1: Margaret wants to hire a carpenter.
Sentence 2: The carpenter will build a new ant farm for 
her pets.
Joining: Margaret wants to hire a carpenter who will build 
a new ant farm for her pets.
Don’t Keep Your Audience 
Hanging: Removing Danglers
 
One way to foul up an otherwise complete sentence is to 
describe something that isn’t there. Two particular types of 
descriptions tend to cause as many problems as a double date 
with your ex: participles and infinitives. These descriptions 
look like verbs but don’t function as verbs.
In this section, I show you common mistakes that writers 
make with participles and infinitives. Don’t worry about the 
grammatical terms; you don’t need to know them. Just focus 
on the examples I provide for placing descriptions properly.
Dangling participles
Read this sentence:
Munching a buttered sausage, the cholesterol really 
builds up.
The sentence begins with a verb form, munching, but munch-
ing isn’t the verb in the sentence. It’s a participle: a verb form 
that describes. (The verb in the sentence is builds.) Participles 
have to describe something or someone, so munching must 
be tacked onto a muncher. Who is munching in this sentence? 
Unfortunately, no one is munching.
Descriptive verb forms that have nothing appropriate to 
describe are called danglers or dangling modifiers. To correct 
the sentence, add a muncher:

 Chapter 4: Constructing a Complete Sentence 63
Munching a buttered sausage, Eggworthy smiled and 
waved to his cardiologist.
 
In sentences beginning with a descriptive verb form, such as a 
participle, the subject must perform the action mentioned in 
the descriptive verb form. In the sample sentence, Eggworthy 
is the subject. The sentence begins with a descriptive verb 
form, munching a buttered sausage. Thus, Eggworthy is the one 
who is munching. If you want the cardiologist to munch, say
Munching a buttered sausage, the cardiologist returned 
Eggworthy’s wave.
Here’s another problematic example:
Sitting on the park bench, the soaring space shuttle 
briefly delighted the little boy.
Oh, really? The space shuttle is sitting on a bench and soaring 
at the same time? Defies the laws of physics, don’t you think? 
Try again:
Sitting on the park bench, the little boy was briefly 
delighted by the soaring space shuttle.
Now little boy is the subject, so the introductory description 
applies to him, not to the space shuttle.
 
This topic is so popular on the SAT that it deserves another 
example. Here’s a faulty sentence:
Skidding over the icy pavement, the old oak tree couldn’t 
escape the speeding sports car.
You spotted the problem, right? The tree is the subject of the 
sentence, but a tree can’t be the thing skidding over the icy 
pavement. That sort of thing happens only in Harry Potter 
movies. Now for the better version:
Skidding over the icy pavement, the speeding sports car 
slammed into the old oak tree.
Now the speeding sports car is skidding. No problem. Well, no 
grammar problem anyway.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
64
Dangling infinitives
 
Another common dangler is an infinitive (to + a verb) that 
begins a sentence.
To sew well, a strong light is necessary.
This sentence may sound correct to you, but think about the 
meaning for a moment. Who is sewing? No one, at least the 
way the sentence is now written. Moving the infinitive may 
make the sentence sound better to your ears, but the move 
doesn’t solve the problem:
A strong light is necessary to sew well.
There’s still no one sewing, so the sentence is still incorrect. 
To fix the problem, you must add a person:
To sew well, you need a strong light. (You are sewing.)
To sew well, sit near a strong light. (You is understood in 
this command sentence.)
 
An infinitive at the beginning of a sentence may be legal. 
Check out this sentence:
To sew well is Betsy’s goal.
In this sentence, to sew well isn’t a description; it’s an activity. 
In other words, to sew well is the subject in this sentence. How 
do you tell the difference between a subject and a description? 
A subject pairs with a verb (is in the example sentence) and 
answers the question who? or what? (For help finding the subject 
of a sentence, turn to Chapter 2.) A description is an add-on, con-
tributing more information about something else in the sentence.

n math class, you plot parallels on a graph. In grammar, you 
create parallel constructions. When I say parallel construc-
tions, I’m not talking about lines that look like train tracks. I’m 
talking about the need for balance in speech and writing — the 
need to create sentences that aren’t lopsided. I’m talking about 
the reason Hamlet says, “To be or not to be” instead of “Being 
or not to be.” In this chapter, I show you how to avoid everyday 
errors of parallelism — what hard-hatted grammarians call 
faulty construction.
 
If you’re of test-taking age, be aware that parallelism plays 
a starring role in the SAT but is less important on the ACT. 
Why? I have no idea. Maybe one of the SAT writers was 
mugged by an unparallel sentence during childhood.
Seeking Balance
Can you spot the problem in this sentence?
Larry wanted with all his heart to find a bride who was 
smart, beautiful, and had millions of dollars.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
66
Aside from Larry’s unrealistic matrimonial notions, the sen-
tence has another problem: It’s not parallel. Concentrate 
on the part of the sentence following the word was. Larry’s 
dream bride needed these characteristics:
 
✓ Smart
 
✓ Beautiful
 
✓ Had millions of dollars
These three descriptions don’t match. The first two are 
adjectives. The third consists of a verb (had) and an object 
(millions of dollars). (I cover adjectives in Chapter 6, verbs 
in Chapter 2, and objects in Chapter 4.) But all three descrip-
tions are doing the same job in the sentence — describing 
Larry’s dream bride. Because they’re doing the same job, they 
should match, at least in the grammatical sense. Here’s one 
revised list:
 
✓ Smart
 
✓ Beautiful
 
✓ Rich
And here’s another:
 
✓ Intelligence
 
✓ Beauty
 
✓ Millions of dollars
Both lists are fine. In the first list, all the characteristics of 
Larry’s bride are adjectives. In the second, all the character-
istics are nouns. You can use either list; just don’t take some 
elements from one and some from another. Here are the 
revised sentences:
Larry wanted with all his heart to find a bride who was 
smart, beautiful, and rich.
Larry wanted with all his heart to find a bride with intel-
ligence, beauty, and millions of dollars.

 Chapter 5: Drawing Parallels (Without the Lines) 67
 
Parallelism is especially important when you’re making a pre-
sentation or a bulleted list. If one item is a complete sentence, 
all the items should be. If you’re listing nouns, make sure every 
item is a noun. For example, see if you can spot the error here:
This year’s goals for employees of Kubla Khan, Inc. 
include the following:
 
• To visit the stately dome
 
• Rafting the sacred river Alph
 
• Locating a competent dulcimer player
Uh-oh. One item doesn’t match: to visit the stately dome. 
Here’s how the list appears to a grammarian: to visit is an 
infinitive (to + a verb), but the next two items, rafting and 
locating, are gerunds (verb forms that end in -ing and are used 
as nouns). Here are two possible corrections for the list:
 
✓ Visiting the stately dome
 
✓ Rafting the sacred river Alph
 
✓ Locating a competent dulcimer player
or
 
✓ To visit the stately dome
 
✓ To go rafting on the sacred river Alph
 
✓ To locate a competent dulcimer player
Check out another example:
Not parallel: Anna said that whenever anything went 
wrong, whenever someone let us down, or in case of 
disaster, she would “feel our pain.”
What’s wrong: The three things that Anna said are not 
parallel. Two have subject-verb combinations (anything 
went, someone let), and one (in case of disaster) does not.
Parallel: Anna said that whenever anything went wrong, 
whenever someone let us down, or whenever disaster 
struck, she would “feel our pain.”
Why it’s parallel: Now the three things that Anna said are 
all subject-verb combinations.

To avoid parallelism errors, you don’t have to know the cor-
rect grammatical terms — just listen. A parallel sentence has 
balance. A nonparallel sentence doesn’t.
Striving for Consistency
If you’ve ever ridden in a car with a stick shift, you know that 
smooth transitions are rare. If something is just a little off, the 
car bucks like a mule. The same thing is true in sentences. 
You can, at times, shift tense, voice, or person, but even the 
slightest mistake stalls your sentence. In this section, I explain 
how to avoid unnecessary shifts and how to check your sen-
tences for consistency.
Matching verb tenses
Check out this sentence with multiple verbs:
Larry begs Ella to marry him, offers her a crown and a pri-
vate room, and finally won her hand.
Now make a list of the verbs in the sentence:
 
✓ Begs
 
✓ Offers
 
✓ Won
The first two verbs are in present tense, but the third shifts into 
past tense for no valid reason. If the verbs in this sentence were 
gears in a stick shift, your car would conk out. All three verbs 
should be in present tense or past tense. Here are the corrected 
versions of the sentence:
Larry begs Ella to marry him, offers her a crown and a pri-
vate room, and finally wins her hand. (All three verbs are 
in present tense.)
or
Larry begged Ella to marry him, offered her a crown and 
a private room, and finally won her hand. (All three verbs 
are in past tense.)

 Chapter 5: Drawing Parallels (Without the Lines) 69
Sometimes in telling a story, you must shift tense because the 
story’s action requires a change in time. For example:
Betsy always practices for at least 10 hours a day, unless 
she is giving a concert. Last week she flew to Antarctica 
for a recital. When she arrived, the piano was frozen. 
Nevertheless, the show went on. Next week Betsy will 
practice 12 hours a day to make up for the time she lost 
last week.
Betsy’s story has lots of verb tenses: present (practices), 
present progressive (is giving), past (flew, arrived, was frozen, 
went, lost), and future (will practice). Each change of tense is 
justified by the information in the story.
Here’s an example of an unjustified shift in verb tense:
Wrong: Max slips on the ice and, after obsessively checking 
every inch of his skull in the mirror, decided that he had hurt 
his head.
Why it’s wrong: The first verb is in present tense. The 
sentence shifts to past tense for no reason.
Right: Max slipped on the ice and, after obsessively 
checking every inch of his skull in the mirror, decided 
that he had hurt his head.
Staying active (or passive)
The voice of a verb is either active or passive. In Chapter 11, 
I explain the difference between the two. Very briefly, a verb 
is passive if the subject of a sentence is the person or thing 
receiving an action. (For example, in The cookies were baked 
by my grandmother, the cookies receive the action of baking.) 
When the subject of a sentence is the person or thing doing the 
action, the verb is active. (For example, My grandmother baked 
these cookies conveys the same idea using an active verb.)
 
Like tense, the voice of the verbs in a sentence should be 
consistent unless there’s a good reason for a shift. Here’s a 
sentence with an unjustified shift in voice:
Larry polished the diamond engagement ring, rechecked 
the certificate of authenticity, and was crushed when his 
intended bride said no.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
70
The problem may be hard to spot, but a checklist of the verbs 
can help:
 
✓ Polished
 
✓ Rechecked
 
✓ Was crushed
 
✓ Said
The first two verbs and the last one are in active voice, but 
the third is in passive voice.
A number of changes can take care of the problem, such as:
Larry polished the diamond engagement ring, rechecked 
the certificate of authenticity, and cried like a baby when 
his intended bride said no.
or
Larry polished the diamond engagement ring and 
rechecked the certificate of authenticity. His intended 
bride crushed him with her refusal.
 
Notice that the verbs in the corrected sentences are all in 
active voice: polished, rechecked, cried, said and polished, 
rechecked, crushed. In general, active voice is better than pas-
sive. Listen to this clunker:
The diamond engagement ring was polished and the cer-
tificate of authenticity was rechecked by Larry, and Larry 
was crushed when “no” was said to him by his intended 
bride.
I don’t think so. The passive verbs create a wordy mess.
Being true to your person
Ah, loyalty. It’s one of the most celebrated virtues — in life as 
well as in grammar! Loyalty in grammar relates to what gram-
marians call person. In first person, the subject narrates the 
story; I or we acts as the subject of the sentence. In second 

 Chapter 5: Drawing Parallels (Without the Lines) 71
person, the subject is being spoken to, and you (either sin-
gular or plural) is the subject. In third person, the subject is 
being spoken about, using he, she, it, they, or any other word 
that talks about someone or something.
 
To be loyal, don’t start out a sentence talking from the point 
of view of one person and then switch to another point of 
view, unless you have a valid reason for doing so. Here’s an 
example of an unnecessary shift in person:
To celebrate his marriage, Larry gave every person in his 
kingdom the day off from work because you need to do 
something spectacular on such an important occasion.
The first part of the sentence talks about Larry, so it’s in third 
person. The second part of the sentence, which begins with 
the word because, shifts to you (second person). Making the 
correction is simple:
To celebrate his marriage, Larry gave every person in his 
kingdom the day off from work because he needs to do 
something spectacular on such an important occasion.
or
To celebrate his marriage, Larry gave every person in his 
kingdom the day off from work because everyone needs to 
do something spectacular on such an important occasion.
In the first corrected sentence, Larry is the subject of the first 
part of the sentence, and he is the subject of the second part. 
No problem — both are in third person. In the second correc-
tion, Larry is matched with everyone (a third-person pronoun).
Time for another round:
Wrong: I am going to pick up some of those coins; you 
can’t pass up a chance for free money!
Why it’s wrong: The first part of the sentence is in first 
person (I), and the second part shifts to you, the second-
person form. Why shift?
Right: I am going to pick up some of those coins; I can’t 
pass up a chance for free money!

Using Conjunction Pairs 
Correctly
Most joining words (called conjunctions) fly solo. Single con-
junctions — and, but, nor, or, because, although, since, and so 
on — join sentences or parts of sentences (see Chapter 4). 
Some joining words, however, come in pairs. Here are some of 
the most frequently used pairs:
 
✓ Not only/but also
 
✓ Either/or
 
✓ Neither/nor
 
✓ Whether/or
 
✓ Both/and
 
Some of these words show up in sentences without their 
partners. No problem! Just make sure that when they do act 
as conjunction pairs, they behave properly. Here’s the rule: 
Whatever fills in the blanks after these pairs of conjunctions 
must have the same grammatical identity. The logic here is 
that conjunctions have partners, and so do the things they 
join. You may join two nouns, two prepositional phrases — 
two whatevers! Just make sure the things that you join match. 
Check out this example:
Not only Larry but also his bride yearned for a day at the 
beach. (The conjunction pair joins two nouns, Larry and 
his bride.)
Either you or I must break the news to Larry. (The con-
junction pair joins two pronouns, you and I.)
 
Nouns and pronouns are equals when it comes to parallelism. 
Because pronouns take the place of nouns, you may mix them:
Neither Ralph nor he has brought a proper present to 
Larry’s wedding. (The conjunction pair joins a noun, 
Ralph, and a pronoun, he.)

 Chapter 5: Drawing Parallels (Without the Lines) 73
To help you spot parallelism errors in sentences with conjunc-
tion pairs, here are two mismatches and their corrections:
Not parallel: Either Lulu will go with Larry to the bachelor 
party or to the shower, but she won’t attend both.
Why it’s not parallel: The first italicized section is a 
subject-verb combination, but the second is a preposi-
tional phrase.
Parallel: Lulu will go with Larry either to the bachelor 
party or to the shower, but she won’t attend both. (Now 
you have two prepositional phrases.)
Not parallel: Both her lateness and that she was dressed in 
white leather insulted the royal couple.
Why it’s not parallel: The first italicized section is a noun, 
but the second is a subject-verb combination.
Parallel but a little repetitive: Both the fact that she was 
late and the fact that she was dressed in white leather 
insulted the royal couple. (Now the italicized sections are 
both subject-verb combinations.)
Parallel: Both her lateness and her white leather clothing 
insulted the royal couple. (Now the italicized sections are 
both nouns with a few descriptions tossed in — a more 
concise solution.)
Constructing Proper Comparisons
 
The Grammar Police will arrive, warrant in hand, if your com-
parisons aren’t parallel. Comparisons to watch out for include 
more/than, but not, and as well as.
Comparisons with these words are tricky but not impossible. 
Just be sure that the elements you’re comparing match gram-
matically. Check out these examples:
Lulu was more conservative than daring in her choice of 
clothes for Larry’s wedding.
Even so, Larry liked the way Lulu moved but not the way 
she looked.
Lulu enjoyed the ceremonial garter toss as well as the 
ritual bouquet bonfire.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
74
The italicized words in each sentence pair off nicely. In the 
first example, conservative and daring are both descriptions. 
In the second, the way Lulu moved and the way she looked are 
similar constructions (nouns described by adjective clauses, 
if you absolutely must know). And in the third example, garter 
toss and bouquet bonfire are both nouns.
Here’s an incorrect comparison and a possible correction:
Wrong: Ella assumed that she would live in a separate 
castle but not spending every hour with Larry.
Why it’s wrong: The words but not join a subject-verb 
combination and a verb form.
Right: Ella assumed that she would live in a separate castle 
but not that she would spend every hour with Larry.
Why it’s right: The sentence compares two subject-verb 
combinations.
 
How do you know how many words of the sentence are being 
joined? In other words, in the preceding sample sentences, 
how did I figure out how much to italicize? The decision 
comes from the meaning of the sentence. Forget grammar 
for a moment and put yourself into reading comprehension 
mode. Decide what you’re comparing based on the ideas in 
the sentence. Now check the two ideas being compared and 
go back into grammar mode. Do the ideas match grammati-
cally? If so, you’re fine. If not, reword your sentence.

Chapter 6
Adjectives, Adverbs, 
and Comparisons
In This Chapter
▶ Reacquainting yourself with adjectives and adverbs
▶ Knowing which one to use
▶ Placing tricky adjectives and adverbs in a sentence
▶ Making complete and clear comparisons
W
ith the right nouns (names of persons, places, things, 
or ideas) and verbs (action or being words), you 
can construct a solid foundation in a sentence. The key to 
expressing your precise thoughts is to build on that founda-
tion by adding descriptive words.
In this chapter I explain the two basic types of descriptive 
words in the English language: adjectives and adverbs. I show 
you how to identify them in sentences and how to use each 
properly. I then walk you through the process of creating 
descriptive comparisons.
Spotting Adjectives
An adjective is a descriptive word that modifies the meaning 
of a noun or a pronoun. An adjective adds information on 
number, color, type, and other qualities to your sentence. 
So when the car you’re writing about turns into a new silver 
sports car, you’re putting adjectives to work.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
76
Describing nouns and pronouns
The most common job for an adjective is describing a noun. 
Consider the adjectives poisonous, angry, and rubber in these 
sentences. Then decide which sentence you’d like to hear as 
you walk through the jungle.
There is an angry, poisonous snake on your shoulder.
There is a rubber snake on your shoulder.
In these sentences, the descriptive words certainly make a differ-
ence. Angry, poisonous, and rubber all describe snake, and these 
descriptions give you information that you’d really like to have.
Adjectives can also describe pronouns (words that substitute for 
nouns). When they’re giving you information about pronouns, 
adjectives usually appear after the pronoun they’re describing:
There’s something strange on your shoulder. (The adjec-
tive strange describes the pronoun something.)
 
A common error is to change certain nouns into adjectives. 
The word quality, for example, is a noun meaning worth, 
condition, or characteristic. Some people, especially ad writ-
ers, use quality as an adjective meaning good or luxurious. 
Grammatically, you can’t buy a quality television. You can, 
however, buy a high-quality television.
Working hand in hand 
with linking verbs
Adjectives may also follow linking verbs, in which case they 
describe the subject of the sentence. As I explain in Chapter 
2, linking verbs join two ideas, associating one with the other. 
They equate the subject with another idea.
Sometimes a linking verb joins an adjective (or a couple of 
adjectives) and a noun:
Lulu’s favorite dress is orange and purple. (The adjectives 
orange and purple describe the noun dress.)
George’s latest jazz composition sounds awful. (The 
adjective awful describes the noun composition.)

 Chapter 6: Adjectives, Adverbs, and Comparisons 77
Recognizing articles as adjectives
If you ran a computer program that sorted and counted 
every word in this book, you’d find that articles are the most 
common words. Articles — a, an, and the — occupy a branch 
on the adjective family tree:
Melanie wants the answer right away.
This statement means that Melanie wants something specific. 
She is stuck on problem 12, and her mother won’t let her 
go out until her homework is finished. She’s on the phone 
demanding the answer to number 12.
Melanie wants an answer right away.
In this case, Melanie isn’t quite so specific in her demands. 
She simply has to have a date for the prom. She asked you a 
week ago, but if you’re not going to be her escort, she’ll ask 
someone else. She’s lost patience, and she doesn’t even care 
anymore whether you go. She just wants an answer.
 
A apple? An book? A precedes words that begin with con-
sonant sounds (all the letters except a, e, i, o, and u). An 
precedes words that begin with the vowel sounds a, e, i, and 
o. The letter u is a special case. If the word sounds like you, 
choose a. If the word sounds like someone kicked you in the 
stomach — uh — choose an. Another special case is the letter 
h. If the word starts with a hard h sound, as in horse, choose 
a. If the word starts with a silent letter h, as in herb, choose 
an. Here are some examples:
an aardvark (a = vowel)
a belly (b = consonant)
a UFO (U sounds like you)
an unidentified flying object (u sounds like uh)
a helmet (hard h)
an hour (silent h)
 
Special note: Sticklers-for-rules say an historic event. The rest 
of us say a historic event.

78
Locating adjectives
 
To find adjectives, go to the words they describe — 
nouns and pronouns. Start with the noun and ask it three 
questions: How many? Which one? What kind? Consider 
this sentence:
George placed three stolen atomic secrets inside his 
cheese burrito.
You see three nouns: George, secrets, and burrito. You can’t 
find the answer to the following questions: How many 
Georges? Which George? What kind of George? Therefore, no 
adjectives describe George.
But try these three questions on secrets and burrito and you 
do come up with something: How many secrets? Answer: three. 
Three is an adjective. Which secrets? What kind of secrets? 
Answer: stolen and atomic. Stolen and atomic are adjectives. 
The same goes for burrito: What kind? Answer: cheese. Cheese 
is an adjective.
You may have noticed that his answers one of the questions. 
(Which burrito? Answer: his burrito.) His is working as an 
adjective, but his is also a pronoun. Normal people don’t 
have to worry about whether his is a pronoun or an adjective. 
Only English teachers care, and they divide into two camps: 
the adjective camp and the pronoun camp. Needless to say, 
each group feels superior to the other. (I’m a noncombatant.)
 
Keep in mind, however, that adjectives can also roam around 
a bit. Here’s an example:
George, sore and tired, pleaded with Lulu to release him 
from the headlock she had placed on him when he called 
her “fragile.”
Sore and tired tell you about George. Fragile tells you about 
her. (Well, fragile tells you what George thinks of her.) These 
descriptions come after the words they describe.

 Chapter 6: Adjectives, Adverbs, and Comparisons 79
Hunting for Adverbs
Adjectives aren’t the only descriptive words. Adverbs — 
words that modify the meaning of a verb, an adjective, or 
another adverb — are also descriptive. Check these out:
The boss furiously said no to Phil’s request for a raise.
The boss never said no to Phil’s request for a raise.
If you’re Phil, you care whether the word furiously or never is 
in the sentence. Furiously and never are adverbs. Notice how 
adverbs add meaning in these sentences:
Lola sadly sang George’s latest song. (Perhaps Lola is in a 
bad mood.)
Lola sang George’s latest song reluctantly. (Lola doesn’t 
want to sing.)
Lola sang even George’s latest song. (Lola sang everything, 
and with George’s latest, she hit the bottom of the barrel.)
Sprucing up verbs
Adverbs mostly describe verbs, giving more information 
about an action. Nearly all adverbs answer one of these four 
questions: How? When? Where? Why? To find the adverb, go 
to the verb and ask the four questions. Look at this sentence:
Ella secretly swiped Sandy’s slippers yesterday and then 
happily went home.
You note two verbs: swiped and went. Take each one separately. 
Swiped how? Answer: swiped secretly. Secretly is an adverb. Swiped 
when? Answer: swiped yesterday. Yesterday is an adverb. 
Swiped where? No answer. Swiped why? Knowing Ella, I’d say 
she stole for the fun of it, but you find no answer in the sentence.
Go on to the second verb in the sentence. Went how? Answer: 
went happily. Happily is an adverb. Went when? Answer: went 
then. Then is an adverb. Went where? Answer: went home. 
Home is an adverb. (For more about the use of home as an 
adverb, see the later “Locating adverbs” section.) Went why? 
Probably to drink champagne out of the slippers, but again, 
you find no answer in the sentence.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
80
Modifying adjectives 
and other adverbs
Adverbs also describe other descriptive words (that is, adjec-
tives and adverbs), usually making the description more or 
less intense. Here’s an example:
An extremely unhappy Larry flipped when his trust fund 
tanked.
How unhappy? Answer: extremely unhappy. Extremely is an 
adverb describing the adjective unhappy.
 
Sometimes the questions you pose to locate adjectives and 
adverbs are answered by more than one word in a sentence. 
In the preceding example sentence, if you ask, “Flipped 
when?” the answer is when his trust fund tanked. Don’t panic. 
These longer answers are just different members of the adjec-
tive and adverb families.
Now back to work. Here’s another example:
Larry’s frog croaked quite hoarsely.
This time an adverb is describing another adverb. Hoarsely is 
an adverb because it explains how the frog croaked. Quite is 
an adverb describing the adverb hoarsely.
Locating adverbs
Adverbs can be in lots of places in a sentence. To find them, 
rely on the questions how, when, where, and why, not the loca-
tion. Also consider the following guidelines:
 
✓ Many adverbs end in -ly. Strictly is an adverb, and strict 
is an adjective. Nicely is an adverb, and nice is an adjec-
tive. Generally is an adverb, and general is an adjective. 
Lovely is a . . . gotcha! You were going to say adverb, 
right? Wrong. Lovely is an adjective. (That’s why I started 
this paragraph with many, not all.)
 
✓ Some adverbs don’t end in -ly. Soon, now, home, fast, and 
many other words that don’t end in -ly are adverbs, too.

 Chapter 6: Adjectives, Adverbs, and Comparisons 81
 
✓ One of the most common adverbs, not, doesn’t end in 
-ly. Not is an adverb because it reverses the meaning of 
the verb from positive to negative. Loosely speaking, not 
answers the question how. (How are you going to the 
wedding? Oh, you’re not going!)
 
Keep in mind that a word may be an adverb in one sentence 
and something else in another sentence. For example:
Gloria went home because of that slammed door.
Home is where the heart is.
Home plate is the umpire’s favorite spot.
In the first example, home tells you where Gloria went, so 
home is an adverb. In the second example, home is a place, 
so home is a noun. In the third example, home is an adjective, 
telling you the kind of plate.
Sorting through Some 
Sticky Choices
Sometimes, deciding whether you need an adjective or an 
adverb — or identifying which one you have in a sentence — 
isn’t so easy. In this section, I introduce two pairs of tricksters: 
good/well and bad/badly. I also put you on alert that — just to 
make things truly confusing — some adjectives and adverbs 
look exactly the same.
Choosing between “good” 
and “well”
How are you doing today? Good? Well? Not sure? If you ever 
wonder whether you’re answering that simple question cor-
rectly, this section is for you.
Here’s the easy one: Good is always an adjective.
I am good.
This sentence means I have the qualities of goodness or I am in 
a good mood. (Or, the sentence is a really bad pickup line.)

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
82
Well is usually, but not always, an adverb:
I play the piano well.
In this sentence, well is an adverb. It describes how I play. In 
other words, the adverb well describes the verb play.
Where does the “not always” part come in? When you’re talk-
ing about your health, well is an adjective.
I am well.
This sentence means I am not sick. In this case, well describes 
the subject I, which means it’s an adjective.
Do you feel “bad” or “badly”?
Bad is a bad word, at least in terms of grammar. Confusing 
bad and badly is one of the most common errors. Check out 
these examples:
I felt badly.
I felt bad.
Remember the -ly test that I mention earlier in this chapter? If 
so, you know that badly is an adverb, and bad is an adjective. 
Which one should you use? Well, what are you trying to say?
In the first sentence, you went to the park with your mittens 
on. The bench had a sign on it: “Wet Paint.” The sign looked 
old, so you decided to check. You put your hand on the 
bench, but the mittens were in the way. You felt badly — that 
is, not accurately.
In the second sentence, you sat on the bench, messing up the 
back of your coat with dark green stripes. When you saw the 
stripes, you felt bad — that is, you were sad.
 
In everyday speech, you’re not likely to express much about 
feeling badly. About 99.99 percent of the time you feel bad — 
unless, of course, you’re in a good mood.

 Chapter 6: Adjectives, Adverbs, and Comparisons 83
Coping with adjectives and 
adverbs that look the same
Odd words here and there do double duty as both adjectives 
and adverbs. They look exactly the same, but they take their 
identity as adjectives or adverbs from the way that they func-
tion in the sentence. Look at these examples:
Upon seeing the stop sign, Abby stopped short. (adverb)
Abby didn’t notice the sign until the last minute because 
she is too short to see over the steering wheel. (adjective)
Lola’s advice is right: Abby shouldn’t drive. (adjective)
Abby turned right after her last-minute stop. (adverb)
Getting Picky about 
Word Placement
A few words — even, almost, nearly, only, just, and others — 
often end up in the wrong spot. If you don’t place these words 
correctly, your sentence may say something that you didn’t 
intend.
 
Standardized tests often include sentences misusing these 
adjectives and adverbs. Double-check every sentence with 
even, almost, nearly, only, and just.
Placing “even”
Even is a modifier that can land any place in a sentence — and 
change its meaning. Take a look at this example:
It’s two hours before the grand opening of the school 
show. Lulu and George have been rehearsing for weeks, 
and they know all the dances. Suddenly, George’s evil 
twin Lex “accidentally” places his foot in George’s path. 
George is down! His ankle is sprained! What will happen 
to the show?

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
84
 
✓ Possibility 1: Lulu shouts, “We can still go on! Even Lester 
knows the dances.”
 
✓ Possibility 2: Lulu shouts, “We can still go on! Lester 
even knows the dances.”
 
✓ Possibility 3: Lulu shouts, “We can still go on! Lester 
knows even the dances.”
What’s going on here? These three statements look almost the 
same, but they aren’t. Here’s what each one means:
 
✓ Possibility 1: Lulu surveys the 15 boys gathered around 
George. She knows that any one of them could step in at 
a moment’s notice. After all, the dances are easy. Even 
Lester, the clumsiest boy in the class, knows the dances.
 
✓ Possibility 2: Lulu surveys the 15 boys gathered around 
George. Most have been busy learning other parts, and 
there’s no time to teach them George’s role. Then she 
spies Lester. With a gasp, she realizes that Lester has 
been watching George every minute of rehearsal. Lester 
doesn’t have to practice; he doesn’t have to learn some-
thing new. Lester even knows the dances.
 
✓ Possibility 3: The whole group looks at Lester almost 
as soon as George hits the floor. Yes, Lester knows 
the words; he’s been reciting George’s lines for weeks 
now. Yes, Lester can sing; everyone’s heard him. But 
what about the dances? Just then, Lester begins to twirl 
around the stage. Lulu sighs with relief. Lester knows 
even the dances. The show will go on!
Even describes the words that follow it. To put it another way, 
even begins a comparison:
 
✓ Possibility 1: even Lester (as well as everyone else)
 
✓ Possibility 2: even knows (doesn’t have to learn)
 
✓ Possibility 3: even the dances (as well as the songs 
and words)
 
Put even at the beginning of the comparison implied in the 
sentence.

 Chapter 6: Adjectives, Adverbs, and Comparisons 85
Placing “almost” and “nearly”
Almost and nearly are tricky descriptions. For example:
Last night Lulu wrote for almost (or nearly) an hour and 
then went rollerblading.
Last night Lulu almost (or nearly) wrote for an hour and 
then went rollerblading.
In the first sentence, Lulu wrote for 55 minutes and then 
stopped. In the second sentence, Lulu intended to write, but 
every time she sat down at the computer, she remembered 
that she hadn’t watered the plants, called her best friend Lola, 
made a sandwich, and so forth. After an hour of wasted time 
and without one word on the screen, she grabbed her roller-
blades and left.
Almost and nearly begin the comparison. Lulu almost wrote 
(or nearly wrote), but she didn’t. Or Lulu wrote for almost an 
hour (or nearly an hour), but not for a whole hour. In decid-
ing where to put these words, add the missing ideas and see 
whether the position of the word makes sense.
Placing “only” and “just”
If only the word only were simpler to understand! If everyone 
thought about the word just for just a minute. Like the other 
tricky words in this section, only and just change the meaning 
of the sentence every time you alter their positions. Here are 
examples of only and just in action:
Only (or just) Lex went to Iceland. (No one else went.)
Lex only went to Iceland. (He didn’t do anything else.)
Lex just went to Iceland. (The ink on his passport is still 
wet. Just may mean recently.)
Lex went only (or just) to Iceland. (He skipped Antarctica.)
 
Many people place only in front of a verb and assume that it 
applies to another idea in the sentence. I often see T-shirts 
with slogans like “My dad went to NYC and only bought me 
a lousy T-shirt.” The only should be in front of a lousy T-shirt 
because the sentence implies that Dad should have bought 
more — the Empire State Building, perhaps.

Creating Comparisons
A common way to use adjectives and adverbs is to create 
comparisons between two or more things. In this section, I 
show you how to do so.
Getting the hang of regular 
comparisons
Take a close look at the comparisons in these sentences:
Roger’s smile is more evil than Michael’s, but Michael’s 
giggle sounds cuter.
Eggworthy searched for the least efficient sports utility 
vehicle, believing that global warming is less important 
than having the raciest image in town.
Betsy’s most recent symphony was less successful than her 
earlier composition.
What did you notice about the comparisons in the preceding 
sample sentences? Some of the comparisons are expressed 
by adding -er or -est, and some are expressed by adding more, 
most, less, or least to the quality that’s being compared. 
 
How do you know which is appropriate? The dictionary is the 
final authority, and you should consult one if you’re in doubt 
about a particular word. However, here are some general 
guidelines:
 
✓ You can add -er and -est to most single-syllable words. 
(One exception is fun. You don’t make anything funner or 
funnest.)
 
✓ If the word already ends in the letter e, you don’t double 
the e by adding -er or -est. Just add -r or -st.
 
✓ When the descriptive word has more than one syllable, 
you usually need to use more, most, less, and least rather 
than add -er or -est. I say “usually” because exceptions 
exist. (If you’re crazy, you can also be crazier and the 
craziest, for example.)
 
✓ -Er and -est endings aren’t usually appropriate for words 
ending in -ly.

 Chapter 6: Adjectives, Adverbs, and Comparisons 87
Table 6-1 lists some examples of how to add -er and -est to 
descriptive words to make comparison words.
Table 6-1

bear

the block
glad

When the last letter in the descriptive word is y, you must 
often change the y to i before you tack on the ending.
Table 6-2 contains even more descriptions of Lola, this time 
with more, less, most, and least added.

These two tables give you a clue about another important 
comparison characteristic. Did you notice that the second 
column is always a comparison between Lola and one other 
person or thing? The addition of -er or more or less compares 
two things. In the last column of each table, Lola is compared 
to a group with more than two members. When the group is 
larger than two, -est or most or least creates the comparison 
and identifies the extreme.
To sum up the rules:
 
✓ Use -er or more/less when comparing only two things.
 
✓ Use -est or most/least when singling out the extreme in a 
group that’s larger than two.
 
✓ Never combine two comparison methods, such as -er and 
more.
Good, better, best: Working with 
irregular comparisons
Whenever English grammar gives you a set of rules that make 
sense, you know the irregulars can’t be far behind. Not sur-
prisingly, then, you have to create a few common compari-
sons without -er, -est, more/less, or most/least.
Good, bad, well
I think of these examples as the “report card” comparisons 
because they evaluate quality. The first word in each of the 
following bullets provides a description. The second word 
shows you that description when two elements are being 
compared. The last word is for comparisons of three or more.
 
✓ Good, better, best
 
✓ Bad, worse, worst
 
✓ Well, better, best

 Chapter 6: Adjectives, Adverbs, and Comparisons 89
Time to visit good, bad, and well when they’re on the job:
Although Michael’s trumpet solo is good and Roger’s is 
better, Lulu’s is the best of all.
Lulu’s habit of picking at her tattoo is bad, but Ralph’s 
constant sneezing is worse. Eggworthy’s tendency to 
crack jokes is the worst habit of all.
Lola sings well in the shower, but Max sings better in the 
bathtub. Ralph croons best in the hot tub.
Little, many, much
These are the measuring comparisons — words that tell you 
about quantity. The first word in each of the following bul-
lets is the description, the second is used for comparisons 
between two elements, and the last word applies to compari-
sons of three-plus elements.
 
✓ Little, less, least
 
✓ Many, more, most
 
✓ Much, more, most
Check out these words in action:
Lulu likes a little grape jelly on her pizza, but Eggworthy 
prefers less exotic toppings. Of all his creations, Lulu likes 
chocolate pizza least.
Roger spies on many occasions, but he seldom uncovers 
more secrets than his brother Al. Lola is the most success-
ful spy of all.
Anna has much interest in mathematics, though she’s 
more devoted to her trumpet lessons. Of all the musical 
mathematicians I know, Anna is the most likely to succeed 
in both careers.
 
Many or much? How do you decide which word to use? 
Easy. Many precedes plurals of countable elements (many 
crickets or many shoes, for example). Much precedes words 
that express qualities that may not be counted, though these 
qualities may sometimes be measured (much noise or much 
sugar, for instance).

Error alert: Using words 
that you can’t compare
 
Is this chapter more unique than the previous chapter? No, 
definitely not. Why? Because nothing is more unique. The 
word unique means “one of a kind.” Either something is one of 
a kind or it’s not. You can’t compare something that’s unique 
to anything but itself.
Wrong: The vase that Eggworthy cracked was more 
unique than the Grecian urn.
Also wrong: The vase that Eggworthy cracked was fairly 
unique.
Wrong again: The vase that Eggworthy cracked was very 
unique.
Right: The vase that Eggworthy cracked was unique.
 
The word unique is not unique. Several other words share 
its absolute quality. One is perfect. Something is perfect or 
not perfect; nothing is very perfect or somewhat perfect. (I am 
bound, as a patriotic American, to point out one exception: 
The U.S. Constitution contains a statement of purpose citing 
the need to create “a more perfect union.”) Another absolute 
word is round. Your shape is round or not round. Your shape 
isn’t a bit round, rounder, or roundest.
Keep in mind that you can use certain adverbs with unique, 
perfect, round, and the like. For example, you can say some-
thing is nearly perfect or almost round. That’s because you can 
approach an absolute quality, comparing how close someone 
or something comes to the quality.
 
One more word causes all sorts of trouble in comparisons: 
equally. You hear the expression equally as quite frequently. 
You don’t need the as because the word equally contains the 
idea of comparison. For example:
Wrong: Roger got a lighter sentence than Lulu, but he is 
equally as guilty.
Right: Roger got a lighter sentence than Lulu, but he is 
equally guilty.

 Chapter 6: Adjectives, Adverbs, and Comparisons 91
Confusing your reader with 
incomplete comparisons
What’s wrong with this sentence?
Octavia screamed more chillingly.
The comparison is incomplete. Octavia screamed more chill-
ingly than what? Your readers are left with as many possibili-
ties as they can imagine.
Wrong: Octavia screamed more chillingly.
Right: Octavia screamed more chillingly than I did the day 
Lulu drove a truck over my toe.
Also right: Octavia screamed more chillingly than she 
ever had before.
Here’s another comparison with a fatal error. Can you spot 
the problem?
Lulu loved sky diving more than Lola.
Need a hint? Consider these possible interpretations:
Lulu loved sky diving more than Lola. Lola sobbed as she 
realized that Lulu, whom she had always considered her 
best friend, was on the way to the airport instead of on 
the way to Lola’s party.
or
Lulu loved sky diving more than Lola. Lola was fine for 
the first 409 jumps, but then her enthusiasm began to flag. 
Lulu, on the other hand, was climbing into the airplane 
eagerly, as if it were her first jump of the day.
See the problem? Lulu loved sky diving more than Lola is 
incomplete. Your reader can understand the comparison in 
two different ways. The rule here is simple: Don’t omit words 
that are necessary to the meaning of the comparison.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
92
Wrong: Lulu loved sky diving more than Lola.
Right: Lulu loved sky diving more than she loved Lola.
Also right: Lulu loved sky diving more than Lola did.
 
Are you so tired of comparisons that you’re ready to send 
this chapter to the shredder? Well, hang on a little longer as I 
explain the word so. Technically, so should be part of a pair — 
a comparison created with so and that. Lots of people use so 
alone as an expression of intensity:
Lulu’s last sky-dive was so spectacular.
The preceding sentence is fine in conversational English. In 
formal English, however, so shouldn’t be alone. Finish the 
comparison, as in this sentence:
Lulu’s last sky-dive was so spectacular that the pilot 
begged her to fly away with him.

More Rules Than the IRS: 
Using Apostrophes
For some reason, even educated people throw apostrophes 
where they don’t belong and leave them out where they’re 

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
94
needed. But from now on, you can rise above their ranks. 
That’s because in this section, I explain how to use apostro-
phes to show ownership and to combine words.
Showing possession
To show possession in French, you say:
the pen of my aunt (la plume du ma tante)
You can say the same thing in English, but English also offers 
another option: the apostrophe. You can keep the same 
meaning but shorten your phrase this way:
my aunt’s pen
In this section, I detail how to follow the apostrophe rules 
when showing possession.
Indicating ownership with singular nouns
When apostrophes show ownership with singular nouns, you 
add an apostrophe and the letter s to the owner:
Michael’s gold-filled tooth (The gold-filled tooth belongs 
to Michael.)
 
Another way to think about this rule is to see whether the 
word of expresses what you’re trying to say. With the of 
method, you note that
the sharp tooth of the crocodile = the crocodile’s sharp 
tooth
Sometimes, no clear owner appears in a phrase. Such a situa-
tion arises mostly when you’re talking about time. If you can 
insert of into the sentence, you may need an apostrophe:
a year of dental care = a year’s dental care

 Chapter 7: Polishing Your Punctuation 95
Creating plural possessives
The plurals of most English nouns already end with the letter 
s. To show ownership, add an apostrophe after the s:
many dinosaurs’ petrified teeth (The petrified teeth belong 
to a herd of dinosaurs.)
 
The of test works for plurals, too. If you can rephrase the 
expression using the word of, you may need an apostrophe:
three days of dental work = three days’ dental work
 
Remember that an apostrophe shows ownership. Don’t use 
an apostrophe when you have a plural that is not expressing 
ownership:
Wrong: Bagel’s stick to your teeth.
Right: Bagels stick to your teeth.
Irregular plural possessives
To show ownership for an irregular plural — a plural that 
doesn’t end in s — add an apostrophe and then the letter s. 
Check out these examples:
the children’s erupting teeth (The erupting teeth 
belong to the children.)
the women’s lipstick-stained teeth (The lipstick-
stained teeth belong to the women.)
Compound plural possessives
What happens when two single people own something? You 
add one or two apostrophes, depending on the type of owner-
ship. If two people own something together, as a couple, use 
only one apostrophe:
George and Martha Washington’s home (The home 
belongs to the two of them.)

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
96
If two people own things separately, as individuals, use two 
apostrophes:
George’s and Martha’s teeth (He has his set of teeth, and 
she has hers.)
Using apostrophes with proper nouns
Companies, stores, and organizations also own things, so 
these proper nouns — singular or plural — also require 
apostrophes. Put the apostrophe at the end of the name:
Microsoft’s finest operating system
McGillicuddy, Pinch, and Cinch’s finest lawsuit
Some stores have apostrophes in their names, even without a 
sense of possession:
Macy’s occupies an entire city block.
Macy’s is always written with an apostrophe, even when there’s 
no noun after the store name. Macy’s implies a shortened ver-
sion of a longer name (perhaps Macy’s Department Store).
Dealing with compound (hyphenated) words
Other special cases of possession involve compound words: 
son-in-law, mother-of-pearl, and other words with hyphens. 
The rule is simple: Put the apostrophe at the end of the word. 
Never put an apostrophe inside a word. Here are some exam-
ples of singular compound nouns:
the secretary-treasurer’s report
my mother-in-law’s teeth
The same rule applies if the hyphenated noun is plural:
the doctors-of-philosophy’s study lounge (The study lounge 
is owned by all the doctors-of-philosophy.)

 Chapter 7: Polishing Your Punctuation 97
Tackling possessive nouns that end in s
Singular nouns that end in s present special problems. My last 
name is Woods. My name is singular, because I am only one 
person. When students talk about me, they may say,
Ms. Woods’s grammar lessons can’t be beat.
or
Ms. Woods’ grammar lessons can’t be beat.
 
Both (very astute) statements are correct. The Grammar 
Police have given in on this one because while the first ver-
sion follows the rules, the second version simply sounds 
better. Both versions are acceptable, so take your pick.
Showing possession with pronouns
English supplies pronouns — words that take the place of a 
noun — for ownership. Some possessive pronouns are my, 
your, his, her, its, our, and their.
 
Here’s a crucial rule to remember: No possessive pronoun 
ever has an apostrophe. Here are two examples of possessive 
pronouns in action:
that book is yours
his call to the police
Cutting it short: Contractions
A contraction shortens a word by removing one or more let-
ters and substituting an apostrophe in the same spot. For 
example, chop wi out of I will, throw in an apostrophe, and 
you have I’ll. The resulting word is shorter and faster to say.
Table 7-1 shows a list of common contractions, including 
some irregulars. (Won’t, for example, is short for will not.)

Quoting Correctly
A quotation is a written repetition of someone else’s words — 
just one word or a whole statement or passage. Quotations 
pop up in almost all writing. In this section, I show you how 
to properly punctuate quotations, how to show your reader 
when the speaker changes, and when to use quotation marks 
around titles.

 Chapter 7: Polishing Your Punctuation 99
Punctuating your quotations
In general, the rules for quotations are simply customs: Put a 
period inside, put a period outside — what difference does it 
make to your reader? Not much. But to write proper English, 
you need to follow all the rules.
Quotations with speaker tags
A speaker tag identifies the person(s) being quoted. When the 
speaker tag comes first, put a comma after it. The period at 
the end of the sentence goes inside the quotation marks.
The gang remarked, “Lola’s candidate is a sure bet.”
When the speaker tag comes last, put a comma inside the quo-
tation marks and a period at the end of the sentence.
“I support a different candidate,” screamed Lola.
Interrupted quotations
Sometimes a speaker tag lands in the middle of a sentence:
“I think I’ll sue,” Betsy explained, “for emotional distress.”
Notice all the rules that come into play with an interrupted 
quotation: The comma is inside the quotation marks for the 
first half of the quotation, and the speaker tag is followed by 
a comma before the quotation marks. The second half of the 
quotation does not begin with a capital letter, and the period 
at the end of the sentence is inside the quotation marks.
 
When you plop a speaker tag in the middle of someone’s con-
versation, make sure that you don’t create a run-on sentence 
(see Chapter 4). Check out this set of examples:
Wrong: “When you move a piano, you must be careful,” 
squeaked Al, “I could have been killed.”
Right: “When you move a piano, you must be careful,” 
squeaked Al. “I could have been killed.”

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
100
The quoted material forms two complete sentences:
Sentence 1: When you move a piano, you must be careful.
Sentence 2: I could have been killed.
 
Quoted material doesn’t need to express a complete thought, 
so you don’t have to worry about having fragments in your 
quotations.
Quotations without speaker tags
Not all sentences with quotations include speaker tags. The 
punctuation and capitalization rules for these sentences are a 
little different. Check out this example:
When Michael said that the book “wasn’t as exciting as 
watching paint dry,” Anna threw a pie in his face.
If the quotation doesn’t have a speaker tag, don’t capitalize 
the first word of the quotation. Also, you don’t need a comma 
to separate the quotation from the rest of the sentence.
 
Quotations without speaker tags tend to be short — a few 
words rather than an entire statement. If you’re reporting a 
lengthy statement, you’re probably better off with a speaker 
tag and the complete quotation.
Quotations with question marks
Take a look at these two examples:
“How can you eat a tuna sandwich while hoisting a 
piano?” Betsy asked as she eyed his lunch.
“May I have a bite?” she queried.
The quoted words are questions. If you quote a question, put 
the question mark inside the quotation marks.
Consider a slightly different example: The piano mover 
answers Betsy, but no one can understand his words. (His 
mouth is full of tuna fish.) I wonder what he said.
Did he say, “I can’t give you a bite of my sandwich 
because I ate it all”?
Did he really declare, “It was just a piano”?

 Chapter 7: Polishing Your Punctuation 101
The quoted words in this set are not questions. However, 
each entire sentence is a question. In this situation, the ques-
tion mark goes outside the quotation marks.
For those rare occasions when both the quoted words and 
the sentence are questions, put the question mark inside the 
quotation marks:
Did the mover really ask, “Is that lady for real?”
Quotations with exclamation points
Exclamation points follow the same rules as question marks. 
In other words, if the entire sentence is an exclamation but 
the quoted words aren’t, put the exclamation point outside the 
quotation marks. If the quoted words are an exclamation, put 
the exclamation point inside the quotation marks. If both the 
sentence and the quotation are exclamations, put the excla-
mation point inside the quotation marks.
Quotations with semicolons
Every hundred years or so you may write a sentence that has 
both a quotation and a semicolon. (In Chapter 4, I explain 
semicolons.) When you do, put the semicolon outside the quo-
tation marks. Sneak a peek at this example:
Cedric said, “I can’t imagine eating anything but vending 
machine snacks”; his love of junk food was legendary.
Quotations inside quotations
Sometimes you need to place a quotation inside a quotation. 
A quotation inside another quotation gets single quotation 
marks. Consider this example:
Archie said, “Al had the nerve to tell me, ‘Your pocket 
protector is nerd-city and dumpster-ready.’”
Without any punctuation, here’s what Al said:
Your pocket protector is nerd-city and dumpster-ready.
Without any punctuation, here are all the words that Archie said:
Al had the nerve to tell me your pocket protector is nerd-
city and dumpster-ready.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
102
Al’s words are a quotation inside another quotation. So you 
enclose Al’s words in single-quotation marks, and you enclose 
Archie’s in double quotation marks.
 
Commas and periods follow the same rules in both double 
and single quotations.
Identifying speaker changes
In a conversation, people take turns speaking:
“You sat on my tuna fish sandwich,” Michael said.
“No, I didn’t,” Ella said.
“Did too,” Michael said.
“Did not!” Ella said.
Notice that every time the speaker changes, you form a 
new paragraph. This way, the conversation is easy to follow 
because the reader always knows who’s talking. Here’s 
another version of the tuna fight:
“You sat on my tuna fish sandwich,” Michael said.
“No, I didn’t,” Ella said.
“Did too.”
“Did not!”
Although the speaker tags are left out after the first exchange, 
you know who’s speaking because of the paragraph breaks.
Using quotation marks in titles
In your writing, sometimes you may need to include the title 
of a magazine, the headline of a newspaper article, and so on. 
When punctuating these titles, keep in mind these two rules:
 
✓ For smaller works or parts of a whole, put the title in 
quotation marks.
 
✓ For larger (complete) works, set the title off from the rest 
of the writing with italics or underlining.
Use quotation marks for the titles of poems, stories, essays, 
songs, chapters, magazine or newspaper articles, individual 
episodes of a TV series, or Web site pages.

 Chapter 7: Polishing Your Punctuation 103
Use italics or underlining for the titles of collections of poetry, 
stories, or essays; books, CDs, magazines, newspapers, TV 
and radio shows, plays, and entire Web sites.
Here are some examples:
 
✓ “A Thousand Excuses for Missing the Tax Deadline” 
(a newspaper article) in The Ticker Tape Journal (a 
newspaper)
 
✓ “I Got the W2 Blues” (a song title) on Me and My Taxes 
(a CD containing many songs)
 
✓ “On the Art of Deductions” (an essay) in Getting Rich and 
Staying Rich (a magazine)
 
✓ “Deductions Unlimited” (a page on a Web site) in Beat the 
IRS (the title of a Web site)
 
When a title is alone on a line — on a title page or simply 
at the top of page one of a paper — don’t use italics, quota-
tion marks, or underlining. The centering calls attention to 
the title. One exception: If part of the title is the name of 
another work, treat that part as you would any other title. For 
example, if your brilliant essay is about the magazine Happy 
Thoughts, the title page includes this line:
The Decline of the School Magazine: A Case Study of 
Happy Thoughts
Making Comma Sense
Commas are the sounds of silence — short pauses that pro-
vide signals for your reader. Stop here, they say, but not for 
too long. In this section, I guide you through the rules con-
cerning commas so you know where to put them.
Placing commas in a series
Imagine that you text a shopping list to your roommate 
Charlie, who’s shopping for your birthday party. Everything’s 
on one line.

How many things does Charlie have to buy? Perhaps two:
 
✓ Butter cookies
 
✓ Ice cream cake
Or perhaps five:
 
✓ Butter
 
✓ Cookies
 
✓ Ice
 
✓ Cream
 
✓ Cake
How does Charlie know? He doesn’t, unless you use commas. 
Charlie actually needs to buy three things: butter cookies, ice 
cream, and cake. The commas between the items are signals.
 
You need commas between each item on the list, with one 
exception. The comma in front of the word and is usually 
optional. Why? Because when you say and, you’ve already 
separated the last two items. However, if one of the items 
in your series includes an and, keep the final comma in the 
series. Here’s what I mean:
For breakfast I ate cereal, ham and eggs, and fruit.
Without the comma after eggs, your reader could get confused.
Adding information 
to your sentence
Your writing relies on nouns and verbs to get your point 
across. But you also enrich your sentences with descriptions. 
In this section I explain how to place commas so that your 
writing expresses what you mean.
Separating descriptions
Writers often string together a bunch of single-word descrip-
tions called adjectives (see Chapter 6). If you have a set of 

 Chapter 7: Polishing Your Punctuation 105
descriptions, you probably have a set of commas also. Take a 
look at the following sentences:
“What do you think of me?” Belle asked Jill.
Jill took a deep breath and said, “I think you’re a sniffling, 
smelly, pimple-tongued, frizzy-haired monster.”
Notice the commas in Jill’s answer. Four descriptions are 
listed: sniffling, smelly, pimple-tongued, and frizzy-haired. A 
comma separates each description from the next, but there’s 
no comma between the last description (frizzy-haired) and the 
word that it’s describing (monster).
 
Don’t separate numbers from other descriptions or from the 
word(s) they describe, and don’t put a comma after a number. 
Also, don’t use commas to separate other descriptions from 
words that indicate number or amount, such as many, more, 
few, and less. More descriptive words that you shouldn’t sepa-
rate from other descriptions or from the words they describe 
include other, another, this, that, these, and those. Examine 
these correctly punctuated sentences:
Sixteen smelly, stained hats were lined up on the shelf.
Many stinky, mud-splattered shoes sat on the floor.
This green, glossy lipstick belongs in her purse.
In your writing, you may create other sentences in which the 
descriptions shouldn’t be separated by commas. For example, 
sometimes a few descriptive words seem to blend into each 
other to create one larger description in which one word is 
clearly more important than the rest. The list of descriptions 
may provide two or three separate facts about the word that 
you’re describing, but the facts don’t deserve equal attention. 
Look at this example:
Jill just bought that funny little French hat.
You already know that you shouldn’t separate that from funny 
with a comma. But what about funny, little, and French? If 
you write
Jill just bought that funny, little, French hat.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
106
you’re giving equal weight to each of the three descriptions. 
Do you really want to emphasize all three qualities? Probably 
not. In fact, you’re probably not making a big deal out of the 
fact that the hat is funny and little. Instead, you’re emphasiz-
ing that the hat is French. So you don’t need to put commas 
between the other descriptions.
 
Sentences like this example require judgment calls. Use this 
rule as a guide: If the items in a description aren’t of equal 
importance, don’t separate them with commas.
Distinguishing essential information from extras
Sometimes your descriptions are longer than one word. If a 
description is essential to the meaning of the sentence, don’t 
put commas around it. If the description provides extra, non-
essential information, set it off with commas.
 
If you expect to darken little ovals with a #2 pencil, spend a 
little extra time in this section and the next, “Commas with 
appositive influence.” Both the SAT and the ACT gauge your 
knowledge of essential and nonessential commas.
Consider an example. In her quest to reform Larry’s govern-
ment, Ella made this statement:
Taxes, which are a hardship for the people, are not 
acceptable.
Lou, who is a member of Larry’s Parliament, issued the same 
statement but with no commas:
Taxes which are a hardship for the people are not 
acceptable.
Do the commas really matter? Yes. They matter a lot. Here’s 
the deal: If the description which are a hardship for the people 
is set off from the rest of the sentence by commas, the 
description is extra — not essential to the meaning of the sen-
tence. You can cross it out and the sentence still means the 
same thing. If commas don’t set off the description, however, 
the description is essential to the meaning of the sentence. 
Can you see the difference between Ella’s statement and 
Lou’s? Here’s a revised version of each statement:

 Chapter 7: Polishing Your Punctuation 107
Ella: The government should not impose taxes.
Lou: The government is against any taxes that are a hard-
ship for the people.
Lou’s proposal is much less extreme than Ella’s. Lou opposes 
only some taxes — those he believes are a burden.
 
The pronouns which and that may help you decide whether 
you need commas. That generally introduces information 
that the sentence can’t do without — essential information 
that you don’t set off with commas. The pronoun which often 
introduces nonessential information that may be surrounded 
by commas. However, these distinctions aren’t always true.
 
At the beginning of a sentence, a phrase that starts with 
“because” acts as an introductory remark and is always set off 
by a comma:
Because the tattoo was on sale, Lulu whipped out her 
credit card and rolled up her sleeve.
At the end of a sentence, the “because” statement is sometimes 
set off by commas, in which case it may be lifted out of the 
sentence without changing the meaning. Without commas, it’s 
essential to the meaning. Take a look at these two statements:
With commas: Lulu didn’t get that tattoo, because it was 
in bad taste.
Meaning: No tattoos for Lulu! The “because” information 
is extra, explaining why Lulu passed on the design.
Without commas: Lulu didn’t get that tattoo because it 
was in bad taste.
Meaning: Lulu got the tattoo, but not because it was in 
bad taste. She got it for another reason (perhaps the sale).
Commas with appositive influence
If you’re seeing double when you read a sentence, you’ve 
probably encountered an appositive. Strictly speaking, apposi-
tives aren’t descriptions, though they do give you information 
about something else in the sentence. Appositives are nouns 

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
108
or pronouns that are exactly the same as the noun or pronoun 
preceding them in the sentence. You set off some appositives 
with commas, and others you don’t.
 
Here’s the rule concerning commas and appositives: If you’re 
sure that your readers will know what you’re talking about 
before they get to the appositive, set off the appositive with 
commas. If you’re not sure your readers will know exactly 
what you’re talking about by the time they arrive at the 
appositive, you shouldn’t use commas.
Here’s an example in which Mary is the appositive of sister:
Lulu has five sisters, but her sister Mary is definitely her 
favorite.
Because Lulu has five sisters, you don’t know which sister 
is being discussed until you have the name. Mary identifies 
the sister and shouldn’t be placed between commas. Here’s 
another example:
Roger has only one sibling. His sister, Mary, doesn’t 
approve of Roger’s espionage.
Because Roger has only one sibling, the reader knows that 
he has only one sister. Thus the words his sister pinpoint the 
person being discussed in the sentence. The name is extra 
information, so you should set it off with commas.
Directly addressing someone
When writing a message to someone, you need to separate the 
person’s name from the rest of the sentence with a comma. 
Otherwise, your reader may misread the message. Look at 
two versions of a note that Michael left on a door:
Roger wants to kill Wendy. I locked him in this room.
Roger wants to kill, Wendy. I locked him in this room.
In the first sentence, Roger wants to kill one specific person; 
only Wendy needs to run for her life. In the second sentence, 
everyone is in danger. The note is intended for Wendy, but 
Roger doesn’t seem to care who he kills.

 Chapter 7: Polishing Your Punctuation 109
In grammarspeak, the second version is a direct-address sen-
tence. The writer is directing his comments to Wendy, so her 
name is cut off from the rest of the sentence with a comma. 
Direct address is also possible at the beginning or in the 
middle of a sentence:
Wendy, Roger wants to kill, so I locked him in this room.
Roger wants to kill, Wendy, so I locked him in this room.
Presenting addresses and dates
Commas are good, all-purpose separators, and they do a fine 
job on addresses and dates.
Addressing addresses
Here’s an address, the way you see it on an envelope:
Ms. Belle Planet
223 Center Street
Venus, New York 10001
If you put Belle’s address into a sentence, you have to sepa-
rate each item of the address:
Belle Planet lives at 223 Center Street, Venus, New York 
10001.
Notice that the house number and street aren’t separated by a 
comma, nor are the state and zip code.
If the sentence continues, you must separate the last item 
in the address from the rest of the sentence with another 
comma:
Belle Planet lives at 223 Center Street, Venus, New York 
10001, but is thinking of moving to Mars.
If you have just a city and a state, put a comma between them. 
If the sentence continues, place a comma after the state.
Belle Planet lives in Venus, New York, but is thinking of 
moving to Mars.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies

Punctuating dates
Confession time: The rules for placing commas in dates aren’t 
very stable these days. Also, writers from different areas (sci-
ence and literature, for example) favor different systems. In 
this section I tell you the traditional form and show you some 
possible variations. If you’re writing for business or school, 
the traditional form should get you through.
If the date is alone on a line (perhaps at the top of a letter), 
these formats are fine:
September 28, 2060 (traditional)
Sept. 28, 2060 (traditional)
28 September 2060 (modern in the United States, tradi-
tional in many other countries)
When dates appear in a sentence, the format changes depend-
ing on (a) how traditional you want to be and (b) how much 
information you want to give. Take a look at the commas — or 
the lack of commas — in these sentences:
On September 28, 2060, Lulu ate several thousand gummy 
candies. (traditional)
In October, 2060, Lulu gave up sugary snacks. (traditional)
Lulu pigs out every October 31st. (both camps)
In October 2060 Lulu suffered from severe indigestion. 
(modern)
Lulu visited a nutritionist on 20 October 2060. (modern)
Setting off introductory words
Yes, this section introduces a comma rule. Well, you probably 
know it already. Oh, I’ll explain it anyway. Okay, the rule is 
that you must separate words that aren’t part of the sentence 
but instead comment on the meaning of the sentence. In other 
words, you use commas to set off introductory words at the 
beginning of a sentence from what follows. If you omit these 
words, the sentence still means the same thing. Common 
examples include yes, no, well, oh, and okay.

 Chapter 7: Polishing Your Punctuation 111
Read these examples twice, once with the introductory words 
and once without. See how the meaning stays the same?
Yes, you are allowed to chew gumballs during class.
Well, you may consider moving on to another topic if you 
have exhausted “My Favorite Lightbulb.”
Punctuating with conjunctions
When you join two complete sentences with the conjunctions 
(joining words) and, or, but, nor, yet, so, or for, place a comma 
before the conjunction. Some examples:
Agnes robbed the bank, and then she went out for a 
hamburger.
James spies, but apart from that lapse he is not a bad 
fellow.
For more information on conjunctions and complete sentences, 
see Chapter 4.
 
Some sentences have one subject and two verbs joined by 
and, but, or, or nor. Don’t put commas between the two verbs. 
You aren’t joining two complete sentences, just two words or 
groups of words. Here’s an example:
Wrong: Ella wrote a statement for the media, and then 
screamed at her press agent for an hour.
Why it’s wrong: The sentence has one subject (Ella) 
and two verbs (wrote, screamed). You aren’t joining two 
complete sentences, so you shouldn’t place a comma 
before and.
Right: Ella wrote a statement for the media and then 
screamed at her press agent for an hour.
Mastering Dashes
Long dashes — what grammarians call em dashes — are dra-
matic. These long straight lines draw your eye and hold your 
attention. But long dashes aren’t just showoffs; they insert 

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
112
information into a sentence and introduce lists. Short dashes — 
en dashes — show a range or connect words when the word to 
or and is implied.
Long dashes
A long dash’s primary job is to tell the reader that you’ve 
jumped tracks onto a new (though related) subject, just for a 
moment. Here’s an example:
After we buy toenail clippers — the dinosaur in that 
exhibit could use a trim — we’ll go to the bakery.
The information inside the dashes is off-topic. Take it out, and 
the sentence makes sense. The material inside the dashes 
relates to the information in the rest of the sentence, but it 
acts as an interruption to the main point that you’re making.
 
The words between a pair of dashes may or may not form a 
complete sentence. Fine. However, some people use only one 
dash to tack a complete sentence onto another complete sen-
tence. Not fine! (This is an issue you may encounter on stan-
dardized tests.) Here’s what I mean:
Wrong: The curator painted the dinosaur orange — 
everyone hates the color.
Right: The curator painted the dinosaur orange — every-
one hates the color — because she wanted to “liven the 
place up.”
Also right: The curator painted the dinosaur orange; 
everyone hates the color.
The first example sentence is wrong because a dash can’t 
link two complete sentences. The second example is okay 
because a pair of dashes can surround a complete sentence 
embedded inside another complete sentence. The third exam-
ple avoids the problem by linking the two sentences 
with a semicolon.

 Chapter 7: Polishing Your Punctuation 113
Short dashes
If you master this punctuation mark, you deserve an official 
grammarian’s badge. Short dashes show a range:
From May–September, the convicts prune commas from 
literature written over the winter.
Short dashes also show up when you’re omitting the word to 
between two elements:
The New York–Philly train is always on time.
Finally, a short dash links two or more equal elements when 
and is implied:
The catcher–pitcher relationship is crucial.
 
Don’t confuse short dashes with hyphens, an even shorter 
punctuation mark that I cover in the next section.
Wielding Hyphens with Ease
You need hyphens to separate parts of compound words, to 
write certain numbers, and to create one description from two 
words. This section provides you with a guide to the care and 
feeding of the humble hyphen.
Creating compound words
Hyphens separate parts of compound words, such as ex-wife, 
pro-choice, mother-in-law, and so forth. When you write these 
words, don’t put a space before or after the hyphen.
 
The trend these days is toward using fewer punctuation 
marks. Thus, many words that used to be hyphenated com-
pounds are now written as single words. Semi-colon, for 
instance, has morphed into semicolon. The dictionary is your 
friend when you’re figuring out whether an expression is a 
compound, a single word, or two separate words.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
114
Hyphens also show up when a single word could be misunder-
stood. I once received an e-mail from a student. “I resent the 
draft,” she wrote. I spent ten minutes worrying about her feel-
ings before I realized that she sent the draft twice because the 
e-mail didn’t go through the first time. To avoid misinterpreta-
tion, she should have written re-sent.
Hyphenating numbers
Decisions about whether to write a numeral or a word are 
questions of style, not of grammar. The authority figure in 
your life — teacher, boss, whatever — will tell you what he or 
she prefers. In general, you usually represent larger numbers 
with numerals:
Roger has been arrested 683 times, counting last night.
However, on various occasions you may need to write the 
word, not the numeral. If the number falls at the beginning of 
a sentence, for example, you must use words because no sen-
tence may begin with a numeral. You may also need to write 
about a fractional amount. Here’s how to hyphenate:
 
✓ Hyphenate all numbers from twenty-one to ninety-nine.
 
✓ Hyphenate all fractions used as descriptions (three-
quarters full, for example).
 
✓ Don’t hyphenate fractions used as nouns (three quarters 
of the money; one third of all registered voters).
Connecting two-word descriptions
If two words create a single description, put a hyphen 
between them if the description comes before the word that 
it’s describing. For example:
a well-placed hyphen — BUT — the hyphen is well placed
 
Don’t hyphenate two-word descriptions if the first word ends 
in -ly:
nicely drawn rectangle
completely ridiculous grammar rule

 Chapter 7: Polishing Your Punctuation 115
Creating a Stopping Point: Colons
A colon (:) appears when a comma isn’t strong enough. In this 
section I look at the colon in a few of its natural habitats: busi-
ness letters, lists, and quotations.
Sprucing up a business letter
Colons appear in business letters after the salutation: the 
“Dear Ms. X” or “To Whom It May Concern.” The colon makes 
a business letter more formal. The opposite of a business 
letter is what English teachers call a friendly letter (even if it 
says something like “I hate you”). When you write a friendly 
letter, put a comma after the name of the person who will 
receive it.
Inserting long lists
When you insert a short list of items into a sentence, you 
don’t need a colon. When you insert a long list into a sen-
tence, however, you may use a colon to introduce it. Think of 
the colon as a gulp of air that readies the reader for a good-
sized list. The colon precedes the first item. Here’s a sentence 
that uses a colon to introduce a list:
General Parker needed quite a few things: a horse, 
an army, a suit of armor, a few million arrows, and 
a map.
 
If you put a colon in front of a list, check the part of the sen-
tence before the colon. Can it stand alone? If so, great. The 
words before the colon must form a complete thought. If not, 
don’t use a colon.
Introducing long quotations
The rule concerning colons with quotations is fairly easy. If 
the quotation is short, introduce it with a comma. If the quota-
tion is long, introduce it with a colon:

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
116
Lola stated, “I have no comment.”
Parker explained: “The media has been entirely too 
critical of my preparations for war. Despite the fact that 
I have spent the last ten years and two million gold coins 
perfecting new and improved armor, I have been told 
that I am unready to fight.”
 
When you write a paper for school, you may put some short 
quotations (up to three lines) into the text. If a quotation is 
longer than three lines, you should double-indent and single-
space the quoted material so that it looks like a separate 
block of print. Such quotations are called block quotations. 
Introduce the blocked quotation with a colon, and don’t use 
quotation marks. Here’s an example:
Flugle makes the following point about homework:
Studies show that students who have no time to rest are 
not as efficient as those who do. When a thousand teens 
were surveyed, they all indicated that sleeping, listening 
to music, talking on the phone, and watching TV were 
more valuable than schoolwork.
Colons sometimes also join one complete sentence to another. 
You may use a colon this way only when the second sentence 
explains the meaning of the first sentence, as in this example:
Lola has refused to take the job: She believes the media 
will investigate every aspect of her life.
Notice that I capitalize the first word after the colon. Some 
writers prefer lowercase for that spot. This decision is a 
matter of style, not grammar. Check with the authority figure 
in charge of your writing for his or her preference.

very teacher has at least one pet peeve. I have a good-
sized set of usage errors that set my teeth on edge. One 
is using lowercase for the personal pronoun I. It’s not that I 
have anything against lowercase letters. It’s just that I believe 
i and I should follow tradition, because, well . . . capitalization 
is all about tradition. So don’t look for logic in this chapter. All 
you find here is what’s up with capitalization rules.
Covering the Basic Rules
Fortunately, the rules for capital letters are easy. Here are the 
basics:
 
✓ Begin every sentence with a capital letter. What’s that 
you asked? What about sentences that begin with a 
numeral? Caught you! You’re not supposed to begin a 
sentence with a numeral. Ever. If you need a number in 
that spot, you have to write the word and capitalize it. 
So if you’re a star pitcher and the Yankees make an offer, 
don’t send this text:
 
 $10,000,000 per game is not enough.
 
 Instead, type one of these messages:
 
 A mere $10,000,000 per game is not enough.
 
 Ten million dollars per game is not enough.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
118
 
 Traditionally, the first letter of each line of a poem is capi-
talized, even if it isn’t the beginning of a sentence. However, 
poets enjoy trashing (sorry, I meant reinterpreting) rules. In 
poetry, anything goes — including capitalization rules.
 
✓ Capitalize I. I have no idea why the personal pronoun I 
must be capitalized, but it must. So save lowercase for 
other pronouns (he, she, us, them, and so on).
 
✓ Capitalize names. This rule applies when you’re using an 
actual name, not a category. Write about Elizabeth, not 
elizabeth, when you’re discussing the cutest baby ever 
(my granddaughter). She’s a girl, not a Girl, because girl 
is a category, not a name. Elizabeth lives in Washington, 
not washington (her state, not her State, because state is a 
general category, not a name). You also capitalize brand 
names (Sony, for example) unless the company itself uses 
lowercase letters (the iPod, for instance).
 
 When dealing with company and product names, you 
often run into unusual capitalization situations. (Think 
eBay and BlackBerry, for example.) Your best bet is to go 
to the company’s authorized Web site and see how the 
name appears there.
 
✓ Capitalize words that refer to the deity. Traditionally, 
believers capitalize all words that refer to the being they 
worship, as in this line from a famous hymn:
 
 God works in mysterious ways His wonders to 
perform.
 
 Capitalize mythological gods only when giving their names:
 
 The ancient Greeks built temples in honor of Zeus 
and other gods.
 
✓ Begin most quotations with a capital letter. When quo-
tation marks appear, so do capitals — most of the time. 
(For exceptions to this rule, turn to Chapter 7.)
That’s it for the basics. For the picky stuff, keep reading.
Capitalizing (Or Not) 
References to People
If human beings were called only by their names, life would 
be much simpler, at least in terms of capital letters. But most 

 Chapter 8: Capitalizing Correctly 119
people pick up a few titles and some relatives as they journey 
through life. In this section I tell you what to capitalize when 
you’re referring to people.
Treating a person’s titles with care
Allow me to introduce myself. I’m Ms. Woods, Chief Grammarian 
Woods, and Apostrophe-Hater-in-Chief Woods. All these titles start 
with capital letters because they’re attached to the front of my 
name. In a sense, they’ve become part of my name.
Allow me to introduce my friend Eggworthy. He’s Mr. 
Eggworthy Henhuff, director of poultry at a nearby farm. Next 
year, Director of Poultry Henhuff plans to run for state senator, 
unless he cracks under the pressure of a major campaign, in 
which case he’ll run for sheriff.
Now what’s going on with the capitals? The title Mr. is capital-
ized because it’s attached to Eggworthy’s last name. Other 
titles — state senator and sheriff — are not. In general, lower-
case titles are those not connected to a name.
Notice that Director of Poultry is capitalized when it precedes 
Eggworthy’s last name but not capitalized when it follows 
Eggworthy’s name. Director of Poultry Henhuff functions as a 
unit. If you were talking to Eggworthy, you might address him as 
Director of Poultry Henhuff. So the first Director of Poultry in this 
paragraph functions as part of the name. When the title follows 
the name, it gives the reader more information about Eggworthy, 
but it no longer acts as part of Eggworthy’s name. Hence, the 
second director of poultry in the paragraph is in lowercase.
 
No self-respecting rule allows itself to be taken for granted, 
however. You may need to capitalize very important titles, 
even when they appear without the name of the people who 
hold them. What’s very important? Definitely these:
 
✓ President of the United States
 
✓ Secretary General of the United Nations
 
✓ Chief Justice of the Supreme Court
 
✓ Prime Minister of Great Britain

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
120
 
The rules on capitalizing these titles differ depending on your 
audience and the style guide you’re following. When in doubt, 
check with your boss, editor, teacher, or other authority 
figure about how to treat important titles.
The following titles are often — but not always — lowercase 
when they appear without a name:
 
✓ ambassador
 
✓ cabinet secretary
 
✓ consul
 
✓ judge
 
✓ mayor
 
✓ representative
Nameless titles that are even lower on the importance ladder 
are strictly lowercase, such as assistant secretary, officer, and 
ensign.
 
When capitalizing a two-word title, capitalize both words 
(Chief Justice) or neither (assistant secretary). One exception 
(sigh) to the rule is for exes and elects:
 
✓ ex-President
 
✓ President-elect
Handling family relationships
It’s not true that Elizabeth’s grandma was imprisoned for 
felonious sentence structure. I know for a fact that Uncle 
Bart took the rap, although his brother Alfred tried desper-
ately to persuade Grandma to make a full confession. “My 
son deserves to do time,” said Grandma, “because he split 
an infinitive when he was little and got away with it.”
What do you notice about the family titles in the preced-
ing paragraph? Some of them are capitalized, and some are 
not. The rules for capitalizing the titles of family members 
are simple. If you’re labeling a relative, don’t capitalize. (I’m 

 Chapter 8: Capitalizing Correctly 121
talking about kinship labels here: aunt, sister, son, and so 
on.) If the titles take the place of names (as in Uncle Bart and 
Grandma), capitalize them. For example:
Lulu’s stepsister Sarah took care to pour exactly one cup of 
ink into every load of wash that Lulu did. (stepsister = label)
Sarah told Mother about the gallon of paint thinner 
that Lulu had dripped over Sarah’s favorite rose bush. 
(Mother = name)
I was surprised when my father took no action; fortu-
nately, Aunt Aggie stepped in with a pail of bleach for 
Lulu. (father = label; Aunt Aggie = name)
 
If you can substitute a real name for the reference to the 
person in the sentence, you probably need a capital letter:
Original: I told Father that he needed to shave off his 
handlebar mustache and put it on his bicycle.
Substitution: I told Jonas that he needed to shave off his 
handlebar mustache and put it on his bicycle.
In this case, the substitution sounds fine, so capitalize Father.
If the substitution sounds strange, you probably need lowercase:
Original: I told my grandmother not to shave off her 
mustache.
Substitution: I told my Mabel not to shave off her mustache.
The substitution doesn’t work because you don’t say my 
Mabel. In this example, you use lowercase for grandmother.
 
The word my and other possessive pronouns (your, his, her, our, 
their) often indicate that you should lowercase the title. (For 
more information on possessive pronouns, see Chapter 3.)
Tackling race and ethnicity
If you come from Tasmania, you’re Tasmanian. If you come 
from New York, you’re a New Yorker. (Don’t ask me about 

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
122
Connecticut; I’ve never been able to get an answer, though 
I’ve asked everyone I know from that state.) Those examples 
of capitalization are easy. But what about race and ethnicity?
Like everyone else, grammarians struggle to overcome the 
legacy of a racist society and its language. Here are some 
guidelines concerning capitalization and race:
 
✓ White and Black (or white and black) are acceptable 
descriptions, but be consistent. Don’t capitalize one and 
not the other. Always capitalize Asian because the term 
is derived from the name of a continent.
 
✓ European American, Asian American, and African 
American are all in capitals, as are other descriptions 
of origin derived from place names, such as Mexican 
American and Polish American.
Getting a Geography Lesson: 
Places, Directions, and More
This section covers capitalizing all things geographical: the 
names of places, languages, geographical features, regions, 
and directions.
Locations and languages
In general, you should capitalize the names of countries and 
languages. Of course, exceptions exist. Some common objects 
with a country or nationality as part of the name may not 
need to be capitalized; scotch whisky and venetian blinds are 
examples. But Brussels sprouts and Yorkshire terrier do require 
capitalization. Confusing? You bet. Bottom line: If you’re not 
sure whether to capitalize the geographical part of a common 
item, check the dictionary.
Capitalize locations within a country — cities or regions, for 
example — when the proper name is given: the Mississippi 
River, the Congo, or Los Angeles, for example. Is the ever part 
of the name? Usually not, even when it’s hard to imagine the 
name without it. In general, don’t capitalize the.

 Chapter 8: Capitalizing Correctly 123
When referring to geographical features instead of proper 
names, don’t capitalize: mountain, valley, gorge, or beach, for 
instance.
Directions and areas
Robbie and Levon, my parakeets, don’t migrate for the winter. 
(Instead, they sit on the window frame and squawk at their 
friends, the pigeons of New York.) If they did fly away, though, 
where would they go: south or South? It depends. The direction 
of flight is south (lowercase). The area of the country where they 
work on a tan is the South (uppercase). Got it? From New York 
City you drive west to visit the West (or the Midwest).
You often capitalize the names of other, smaller areas as well. 
Plopped in the center of New York City is Central Park, which 
the city’s West Side and East Side flank. Chicago has a South 
Side and London has Bloomsbury. Note the capital letters for 
the names of these areas.
Looking at Seasons 
and Times of Day
Loch Ness hates the summer because of all the tourists 
who try to snap pictures of what he calls “an imaginary 
monster.” He has been known to roar something about 
“winter’s peaceful mornings,” even though he never wakes 
up before 3 p.m.
After reading the preceding example, you can probably figure 
out this rule without me. Write the seasons of the year in low-
ercase, as well as the times of day.
 
Some books tell you to capitalize the abbreviations for morn-
ing and afternoon (A.M. and P.M.) and some specify lowercase 
(a.m. and p.m.). So no matter what you do, half your readers 
will think you’re right and half will think you’re wrong. Your 
best bet is to check with the authority overseeing your writ-
ing. If you’re the authority, do what you want.

Getting Schooled in 
Education Terms
As every student knows, school is complicated. So is the rule 
concerning the capitalization of school-related terms. Don’t 
capitalize subjects and subject areas (history, science, and 
physics, for example) unless the name refers to a language 
(Spanish, Latin, English, and so on). On the other hand, capi-
talize the titles of courses (Economics 101, Math for Poets, 
Paper Clips in American History, and the like).
The years in school, though interminable and incredibly 
important, are not capitalized (seventh grader, freshman, and 
sophomore, for instance).
Wrestling with Capitals in Titles
Loch Ness is hosting a party to celebrate the publication of 
his new book, I AM NOT A MONSTER. He has postponed the 
party three times because he can’t decide how to capitalize 
the title. What should he do?
 
✓ Capitalize I and Monster. I is always uppercase, and 
Monster is an important word. Also, I is the first word of 
the title, and you always capitalize the first word of a title.
 
✓ Capitalize Am. It’s a verb, and verbs are at the heart of 
the title’s meaning.
 
✓ Capitalize Not. This word changes the meaning of the 
verb and thus has an important job to do in the sentence.
 
✓ Lowercase the only word left — a. Never capitalize articles 
(a, an, and the) unless they’re the first words in the title.
The resulting book title is I Am Not a Monster.
Here’s a summary of the rules for all sorts of titles:
 
✓ Capitalize the first word in the title.
 
✓ Capitalize verbs and other important words.

 Chapter 8: Capitalizing Correctly 125
 
✓ Lowercase unimportant words: articles (a, an, the), con-
junctions (words that connect, such as and, or, and nor), 
and prepositions (of, with, by, and other words that express 
a relationship between two elements in the sentence).
 
Some grammarians capitalize long prepositions — those with 
more than four letters. Others tell you to lowercase all prepo-
sitions, even the huge ones, such as concerning and according 
to. (See Chapter 10 for a list of common prepositions.) Your 
best bet is to check with your immediate authority (editor, 
boss, teacher, and so on) to make sure that you write in the 
style to which he or she is accustomed.
 
When writing the title of a magazine or newspaper, should 
you capitalize the word the? Yes, if the is part of the official 
name, as in The New York Times. No, if the publication doesn’t 
include the in its official name, as in the Daily News.
Writing about Events and Eras
Jane entered her time machine and set the dial for the 
Middle Ages. Because of a glitch in the power supply, Jane 
ended up right in the middle of the Industrial Revolution. 
Fortunately for Jane, the Industrial Revolution did not 
involve a real war. Jane still shudders when she remem-
bers her brief stint in the Civil War. She is simply not cut 
out to be a fighter, especially not a fighter in the nine-
teenth century. On the next Fourth of July, Jane plans to fly 
the bullet-ridden flag she brought back from the Battle of 
Gettysburg.
The moral of Jane’s story? Capitalize the names of specific 
time periods and events but not general words. Hence,
 
✓ Capitals: Middle Ages, Industrial Revolution, Civil War, 
Fourth of July, Battle of Gettysburg
 
✓ Lowercase: war, nineteenth century
 
Some grammarians capitalize Nineteenth Century because they 
see it as a specific time period. Others say that you should 
lowercase numbered centuries. I prefer to lowercase the cen-
tury. However, you need to make certain that you’re even sup-
posed to spell out nineteenth in this situation; your authority 
figure or style guide may demand 19th instead.

Capitalizing Abbreviations
I often discourage abbreviations because they can confuse 
the reader and because they clash with formal writing. 
Sometimes, however, you do want to abbreviate. Here’s how 
to do so correctly:
 
✓ Capitalize abbreviations for titles, and end the abbrevia-
tion with a period. For example, Mrs. Snodgrass, Rev. 
Tawkalot, Sen. Veto, and Jeremiah Jones, Jr.
 
✓ Capitalize geographic abbreviations when they’re part of 
a proper name, and put a period at the end: Appalachian 
Mts. or Amazon R., for example.
 
✓ The United States Postal Service has devised a list of 
two-letter state abbreviations. Don’t put periods in these 
abbreviations, such as AZ (Arizona) and CO (Colorado).
 
✓ Write most measurements in lowercase, and end the 
abbreviation with a period (yds. for yards or lbs. for 
pounds). Metric abbreviations are sometimes written 
without periods (km for kilometer or g for gram).
 
Don’t confuse abbreviations with acronyms. Abbreviations 
generally chop some letters out of a single word. Acronyms 
are new words made from the first letters of each word in a 
multiword title, such as these examples:
NATO: North Atlantic Treaty Organization
OPEC: Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries
AIDS: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome
 
Want to drive your teacher crazy? Write a formal essay with 
&, w/, w/o, or b/c. These symbols are fine for your notes but 
not for your finished product. Similarly, save brb (be right 
back), lol (laugh out loud), and other texting abbreviations for 
your friends, not for authority figures.

Choosing the Right Words
In This Chapter
▶ Deciding between one word or two
▶ Knowing when you need an apostrophe — and when you don’t
▶ Choosing between similar words
▶ Leaving certain words and phrases out of your writing
T
his chapter is chock-full of grammar demons that can trip 
up even the most seasoned writers. None of the rules I 
explain here is particularly difficult to master; the problem is 
trying to keep them all in mind when you’re writing a 20-page 
report.
 
Here’s what I suggest: Try to commit as much of this informa-
tion to memory as possible, but also keep this chapter handy 
as a reference. Pull it out when you’re proofreading your work, 
and chances are you’ll catch a mistake or two that slipped 
through. (Better you than your boss or teacher, right?)
One Word or Two?
In this section, I list some common two-word phrases that 
people like to write (mistakenly) as single words. I also show 
you some pairs of words that have very different meanings 
depending on whether they’re written as two words or squeezed 
together into one.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
128
Always opting for two
 
The following words are often written as one — incorrectly! 
Always write them as two separate words:
 
✓ A lot: This one gets misspelled a lot.
 
✓ All right: It’s never all right to make this a single word.
 
✓ Each other: We can keep each other happy by writing 
this as two words.
Picking your meaning
You can write the following words as one or two words, but 
be aware that they have different meanings:
 
✓ Altogether means “extremely, entirely.”
 
✓ All together means “as one.”
Example: Daniel was altogether disgusted with the way the 
entire flock of dodo birds sang all together.
 
✓ Sometime means “at a certain point in time.”
 
✓ Some time means “a period of time.”
Example: Lex said that he would visit Lulu sometime, but not 
now because he has to spend some time in jail for murdering 
the English language.
 
✓ Someplace means “an unspecified place” and describes 
an action.
 
✓ Some place means “a place” and refers to a physical space.
Example: Lex screamed, “I have to go someplace now!” Lulu 
thinks he headed for some place near the railroad station.
 
✓ Everyday means “ordinary, common.”
 
✓ Every day means “occurring daily.”
Example: Larry loves everyday activities such as cooking, 
cleaning, and sewing. He has the palace staff perform all these 
duties every day.

 Chapter 9: Choosing the Right Words 129
 
✓ Anyway means “in any event.”
 
✓ Any way means “a way” or “some sort of way.”
Example: “Anyway,” added Roy, “I don’t think there’s any way 
to avoid jail for tax evasion.”
 
✓ Awhile means (confusingly enough) “for a while.”
 
✓ A while means “a period of time.”
Example: I think I’ll wait awhile before telling my parents I 
don’t want to get a job for a while.
Separating Possessive Pronouns 
from Contractions
The word pairs in this section sound the same but aren’t. Each 
case has one form that shows possession and another that’s a 
contraction (a combination of two words shortened by using an 
apostrophe). One case (the word there) even has a third word 
that sounds the same as the possessive and contraction forms 
but bears no relation to them whatsoever in terms of meaning.
 
Here are two rules you must commit to memory to avoid 
mistakes with these word pairs:
 
✓ No possessive pronoun ever has an apostrophe. Ever. 
(See Chapter 3 for a discussion of possessive pronouns.)
 
✓ A contraction always has an apostrophe. Always. 
(Chapter 7 gives you the lowdown on contractions.)
Its/it’s
This word pair may win the prize for causing the most confusion. 
I see it’s mistakenly used to show possession on storefronts, on 
billboards, and even in newspaper articles. (The horror!)
I understand the source of confusion here: People who use it’s 
to show possession are remembering that you add an ’s when-
ever you have a singular noun (see Chapter 7). But pronouns 
are different! As I note at the beginning of this section, no 
possessive pronoun ever has an apostrophe. Ever.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
130
 
So here’s what you need to know: Its shows possession, and 
it’s means “it is”:
The computer has exploded, and its screen is now deco-
rating the ceiling.
It’s raining cats and dogs, but I don’t see any alligators.
Your/you’re
You’re in trouble if your apostrophes are in the wrong place, 
especially when you’re writing in the second person. (The 
second person is the form that uses you, your, and yours.) 
You’re means “you are.” Your shows possession. These two 
words are not interchangeable. Some examples:
“You’re not going to eat that rotten pumpkin,” declared 
Rachel.
“Your refusal to eat the pumpkin means that you will be 
given mystery meat instead,” commented Dean.
There/their/they’re
There is a place. Their shows ownership. They’re is short for 
“they are.” Some examples:
“They’re too short,” muttered Eggworthy as he eyed the 
strips of bacon.
“Why don’t you take some longer strips from their plates,” 
suggested Lola.
“My arm is not long enough to reach over there,” sighed 
Eggworthy.
Whose/who’s
Whose shows ownership. It seldom causes any problems, 
except when it’s confused with another word: who’s. Who’s 
is a contraction that’s short for “who is.” For example:
The boy whose hat was burning was last seen running 
down the street screaming, “Who’s in charge of fire fight-
ing in this town?”

 Chapter 9: Choosing the Right Words 131
Using Words That Seem 
Interchangeable but Aren’t
This section features pairs of words that many writers 
assume mean the same thing. In each case, that assumption 
is wrong. Sometimes the distinctions may seem trivial, but 
they’re real enough to cause trouble if you make the wrong 
choice on a standardized test or in your big report to the 
boss.
Affect versus effect
Has the study of grammar affected or effected your brain? 
Usually, affect is a verb that means “to influence” and effect 
is a noun meaning “result.” Here’s how they work in a 
sentence:
Sunlight affects Ludwig’s appetite; he never eats during 
the day.
Ludmilla thinks that her vegetarian pizza will affect 
Ludwig’s dietary regimen, but I think the effect will be 
disastrous.
However, just to keep things utterly confusing, each word has 
a second usage and meaning:
 
✓ Affect may be a noun meaning “the way one relates to and 
shows emotions.” Huh? Honestly, you rarely encounter 
this usage, but here’s an example so you can recognize it 
when you do:
 
 Her brave affect couldn’t completely mask the 
terror she was actually feeling.
 
 You pronounce the noun form of affect differently from 
the verb form. With the noun form, you stress the first 
syllable, and the a sounds like it would if you were 
saying “at.”
 
✓ Effect may also act as a verb meaning “to cause a 
complete change.” However, you rarely need these 
secondary meanings.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
132
Between versus among
Between and among are two tricky prepositions that are often 
used incorrectly. To choose the appropriate preposition, 
decide how many people or things you’re talking about. If the 
answer is two, you want between, as in this sentence:
Lola was unable to choose between the biker magazine 
and Poetry for Weightlifters.
If you’re talking about more than two people or things, among 
is the appropriate word:
Lola strolled among the parked motorcycles, reading 
poetry aloud.
One exception: Treaties are made between nations, even if 
more than two countries sign:
The treaty to outlaw bubble gum was negotiated between 
Libya, the United States, Russia, and Ecuador.
Continual versus continuous
Two description pairs trespass on each other’s territory: 
continual/continually and continuous/continuously. Which pair 
should you use to express your meaning?
 
✓ Continual and continually refer to events that happen 
over and over again, but with breaks in between each 
instance. Continual (an adjective) describes nouns, and 
continually (an adverb) describes verbs.
 
✓ Continuous and continuously are used for situations 
without gaps. Continuous (an adjective) attaches to 
nouns and continuously (an adverb) to verbs.
Continuous noise is steady and uninterrupted, like the drone 
of the electric generator in your local power plant. Continual 
noise is what you hear when I go bowling. You hear silence 
(when I stare at the pins), a little noise (when the ball rolls 
down the lane), and silence again (when the ball slides into 
the gutter without hitting anything).

 Chapter 9: Choosing the Right Words 133
Here are a couple examples:
Jim screamed continuously until Lola stuffed rags in his 
mouth.
Ella’s continual attempts to impress Larry were unsuc-
cessful, including the fruit basket she sent him on Monday 
and the piranha she shipped on Tuesday.
 
By the way, this pair had a cameo appearance on a recent 
standardized test. Test-takers, refer to these examples con-
tinually so they remain in your memory continuously.
Due to versus because of
According to a rule that people ignore more and more every 
day, here’s the distinction between due to and because of:
 
✓ Due to describes nouns or pronouns. It may follow a link-
ing verb if it gives information about the subject. (See 
Chapter 2 for a discussion of linking verbs.)
 
✓ Because of is a description of an action and usually 
answers the question “why?” (I discuss action verbs in 
Chapter 2 as well.)
Here are some examples:
Lola’s mania for fashion is due to her deprived upbringing 
in an all-polyester household.
The bubble-gum gun that George fired is no longer 
being manufactured because of protests from the dental 
association.
Farther versus further
Farther refers to distance. If you need to travel farther, you 
have more miles to cover. Further doesn’t refer to distance. 
Instead, it means “additional” and is used when discussing 
time, ideas, activities, and lots more. Some examples:
Mike flew farther than anyone else who had been kicked 
by the same bull.
Al needs further work on his teeth before the studio will 
approve a five-picture deal.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
134
Lie versus lay
Whoever invented the verbs lie and lay had an evil sense of 
humor. Besides meaning “not to tell the truth,” lie also means 
“to rest or to plop yourself down, ready for a snooze” or “to 
remain.” Lay means “to put something down, to place some-
thing.” Here are some examples:
Sheila likes to lie down for an hour after lunch. Before she 
hits the couch, she lays a soft sheet over the upholstery.
Roger lies in wait behind those bushes. When unsuspect-
ing tourists lay down their picnic blankets, he swoops in 
and steals their lunches.
So far, this topic isn’t too complicated. The truly devilish 
part comes in the past tense. The past tense of lie (to rest, 
to recline, to remain) is lay. The past tense of lay (to put or 
place) is laid. Check out these examples:
Sheila lay down yesterday, but a car alarm disturbed her 
rest. She immediately went to the street and laid a carpet 
of nails in front of the offending vehicle.
Yesterday, while Roger lay in wait, a police officer laid 
a hand on Roger’s shoulder. “You are under arrest,” 
intoned the cop.
Rise versus raise
Rise means “to stand,” “to get out of bed,” or “to move to a 
higher rank” under one’s own power. Raise means “to lift 
something or someone else up” or “to bring up children or 
animals.” Check out these verbs in action:
Eggworthy rises when a poultry expert enters the room.
Eggworthy is currently an apprentice, but he hopes to rise 
to the rank of master poultry-breeder some day.
He raises roosters on his farm, delighting the neighbors 
every morning at sunrise.
When a nest is too low, Eggworthy raises it to a higher 
shelf.

 Chapter 9: Choosing the Right Words 135
Since versus because
 
Many people say being that to introduce a reason. Unfortunately, 
being that is a grammatical felony in the first degree; it’s never 
acceptable in formal English. When you’re explaining a reason 
for something, try because instead:
Wrong: Being that it was Thanksgiving, Mel bought a 
turkey.
Right: Because it was Thanksgiving, Mel bought a turkey.
You may like the sound of since in the sample sentence, and 
since is being used as a synonym for because more and more 
these days. However, grammarians prefer to use since only for 
time statements, not for reasons:
I haven’t seen the turkey since Herman took the ax out of 
the box.
Sit versus set
Sit and set are not interchangeable. Sit is what you do when 
you stop standing. Set is what you do when you place an 
object somewhere or you adjust or regulate something. Check 
out these examples:
Anna sits in front of the television, even when it’s broken.
Arthur set the ray gun to “stun” and then set it carefully on 
the shelf.
Suppose versus supposed
Check out these sample sentences:
Lola was suppose to take out the garbage, but she refused 
to do so.
George is suppose to do all kinds of things, but of course 
he never does anything he is suppose to do.
They’re both wrong. The italicized verbs represent what 
people hear but not what the speaker is actually trying to say. 
The correct verb form to use in these instances is supposed.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
136
Where does suppose come into play? When you’re musing 
about something in the present tense:
I suppose I should take out the trash before it starts 
attracting wildlife.
Whether versus if
Whether and if both connect one idea to another in a sen-
tence, but each is used in a different situation. Are you choos-
ing between two alternatives? If so, select whether (as in 
whether or not). If you’re describing a possibility, use if. Look 
at the following examples:
George isn’t sure whether he should activate the wind 
machine.
Lulu will reach the top of Mount Everest if the sunny 
weather continues.
Who versus whom
The problem with the pronouns who and whom (and whoever 
and whomever) is slightly different from the problems you 
encounter with the other words in this section. Quite simply, 
no one seems to like whom (or whomever) anymore except for 
grammar teachers, dictionary writers, and other word geeks.
When in doubt about which word to use, you may be tempted 
to always go with who because, in speech, that’s what most 
people use. But whom is still very much in vogue in formal 
English (the kind you use for homework, business reports, 
and other important documents — see Chapter 11).
Here are the rules for using who/whoever and whom/whomever:
 
✓ You use who and whoever as subjects and to complete 
the meaning of linking verbs such as is and seems.
 
✓ You use whom and whomever for all kinds of objects, 
such as direct objects, indirect objects, objects of 
prepositions, and objects of infinitives.

 Chapter 9: Choosing the Right Words 137
For information on subjects, see Chapter 2. For an explanation 
of objects, see Chapter 4.
Check out these sample sentences:
Whoever needs help from Roger is going to wait a long 
time. (Whoever is the subject.)
Who is calling Lulu at this time of night? (Who is the 
subject.)
“I don’t care whom you ask to the prom,” exclaimed 
Michael. (whom is the direct object of the verb ask.)
The trophy is for whomever she designates as the hot-dog 
eating champion. (whomever is the direct object of the 
verb designates.)
For whom are you bellowing? (whom is the object of the 
preposition for.)
 
People have led perfectly pleasant (though grammatically 
incorrect) lives without knowing the stuff in this section. 
However, the standardized test-makers consider these topics 
fair game — and big game, judging from the number of ques-
tions they ask about who and whom.
A Word and a Phrase to Avoid
Irregardless of what your friends may say, you should eliminate 
the following word and phrase from your writing completely. 
If anyone offers you advice different than that, they’re steering 
you wrong. (After you read this section, feel free to reread this 
paragraph and highlight the two errors. Then feel free to write 
a big red “F” at the top of this chapter so I’m duly chastised.)
Irregardless
 
Irregardless is a grammatical no-no. I think irregardless is popu-
lar because it’s a long word that feels good when you say it. 
Those r’s just roll right off the tongue. Sadly, irregardless is 
not a conjunction. It’s not even a word, according to the rules 
of formal English. Use regardless (not nearly so much fun to 
pronounce) or despite the fact that.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
138
Wrong: Irregardless, we are going to eat you, you turkey!
Right: Regardless, we are going to eat you, you turkey!
Also right: Despite the fact that you are a tough old bird, 
we are going to eat you, you turkey!
Different than
How many times have you heard this sentence?
Prepositions are different than other parts of speech.
Okay, never. But I bet you’ve heard (and maybe used) the 
expression different than lots of times. I hate to break the bad 
news, but I must. Different than is never correct. What you 
want is different from. The explanation behind this truth is 
fascinating if you love grammar so much that you dream 
about it at night. In a nutshell, from is a preposition and 
than isn’t. In this phrase, you need a preposition.
I’ll stop right there and spare you the fascinating details. 
Just know that you shouldn’t ever write “different than” in 
a situation that requires formal English. Here’s what you 
want instead:
Prepositions are different from other parts of speech.

▶ Avoiding preposition problems
▶ Negating double negatives
I
n this chapter, I shine the light on a trio of troublemakers 
so they’ll never trip you up again. First, I show you how to 
create plural nouns. Regular nouns are easy to pluralize, but 
some nouns come with their own set of rules. Next, I intro-
duce you to prepositions, explain how to use them, and put 
you on high alert for common problems writers encounter 
with them. Finally, I wrestle with double negatives so you 
won’t never put them in your writing no more. (That was a 
triple negative, in case you were wondering.)
Creating Noun Plurals
In Chapter 2, I introduce you to nouns, which are the subjects 
of most sentences. (Pronouns, which I examine in Chapter 3, 
can also serve as subjects.) Nouns are people, places, things, 
and ideas, and you can change most of them from singular 
to plural pretty easily. Garden-variety nouns form plurals by 
adding the letter s. Check out Table 10-1 for some examples.

Making plurals with 
hyphenated nouns
If you intend to insult your in-laws, you may as well do so with 
the correct plural form. You form the plural of hyphenated 
nouns by adding s or es to the important word, not to the add-
on. These words are all plurals:
 
✓ Mothers-in-law
 
✓ Brothers-in-law
 
✓ Vice-presidents
 
✓ Secretaries-general
 
You may hear references to “attorney generals.” But keep in 
mind that an attorney general is a lawyer, not a military offi-
cer. Therefore, attorney is the important part of this title, and 
it’s a noun. The general is a description — a reference to the 
rank of the attorney. To form a plural, you deal with the noun, 
not with the descriptive word. Therefore, you have one attor-
ney general and two or more attorneys general.
Perfecting Prepositions
How does the cliché go? Little things mean a lot? Whoever said 
that was probably talking about prepositions. These guys — 
some of which are the shortest words in the language — pack 
a punch in your sentences. Unfortunately, prepositions also 
attract mistakes. In this section I explain prepositions and show 
you how to avoid the pitfalls associated with them.
Expressing relationships
Imagine that you encounter two nouns: elephant and book. 
How many ways can you connect the two nouns to express 
different ideas? Here are just a few:
the book about the elephant
the book by the elephant
the book in front of the elephant
the book under the elephant

 Chapter 10: Tackling Other Troublemakers 143
 
The italicized words relate two nouns to each other. These 
relationship words are called prepositions. A preposition is 
any word or group of words that relates a noun or a pronoun 
to another word in the sentence.
When I was in grammar school, I had to memorize a list of 
prepositions. I was so terrified of Sister Saint Vincent, my 
seventh-grade teacher, that I made the list part of my being. 
I don’t think memorizing prepositions is worth the time, but 
a familiarity with them would be nice. Therefore, I offer this 
list of some common prepositions:
 
✓ about
 
✓ above
 
✓ according to

Eyeing the objects of 
prepositional phrases
 
Prepositions never travel alone; they’re always with one or 
more objects. A prepositional phrase consists of a preposition 
and an object. In the examples in the preceding section, the 
object of each preposition is elephant. The object of a prepo-
sition is always a noun or a pronoun, or perhaps one or two 
of each. (A pronoun is a word that takes the place of a noun, 
such as him for Eggworthy.) Here’s an example:
In the afternoon, the snow pelted Eggworthy on his little 
bald head.
This sentence has two prepositions: in and on. Afternoon is the 
object of the preposition in, and head is the object of the prepo-
sition on. Why is the object head and not little or bald? You can 
throw out a few things inside a prepositional phrase — mainly 
descriptive words. Check out these variations on the phrase of 
the elephant:
of the apologetic elephant
of the antagonizingly argumentative elephant
When you weed through the descriptions, each phrase is 
still talking about just one noun: elephant. Only nouns and 
pronouns are allowed to be objects of the preposition — not 
adjectives or adverbs (which I discuss in Chapter 6).
Identifying the objects 
of prepositions
 
All objects answer the questions whom? or what? To find the 
object of a preposition, ask whom? or what? after the preposi-
tion. For example, in this sentence you see two prepositional 
phrases:
Marilyn thought that the selection of the elephant for the 
show was quite unfair.

 Chapter 10: Tackling Other Troublemakers 145
The first preposition is of. Of what? Of the elephant. Elephant is 
the object of the preposition of. The second preposition is for. 
For what? For the show. Show is the object of the preposition for.
Paying attention to prepositions
Why bother paying attention to prepositions at all? I can think 
of a couple key reasons.
When you’re checking subject-verb pairs, you need to identify 
and then ignore the prepositional phrases. The prepositional 
phrases are distractions. If you don’t ignore them, you may 
end up matching the verb to the wrong word. (See Chapter 2 
for more information on subject-verb agreement.)
You may also find it helpful to recognize prepositional 
phrases because sometimes when you’re trying to find an 
adjective or an adverb, the answer is a prepositional phrase. 
Don’t panic. You haven’t done anything wrong. Simply know 
that a prepositional phrase may do the same job as a single-
word adjective or adverb. (See Chapter 6 for more on adjec-
tives and adverbs.)
 
A few questions in the SAT Writing and the ACT English 
tortures — sorry, I mean tests — revolve around prepositions. 
You may encounter a misused preposition (to instead of with, 
for example) or a situation in which another part of speech 
grabs a preposition’s rightful spot (different than instead of 
different from, perhaps).
Are you talking to I? Matching 
prepositions and pronouns
 
A big preposition pitfall is pronouns (see Chapter 3). Only cer-
tain pronouns (called object pronouns) can act as objects of 
prepositions. If you use the wrong pronoun as the object of a 
preposition, the grammar cops will be on your case.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
146
 
The object pronouns are me, you, him, her, it, us, them, whom, 
and whomever. Take a look at some sentences with a pronoun 
as the object of a preposition:
Among Bill, Harry, and me there is no contest. (Me is one 
of the objects of the preposition among.)
Without them, the bridge will fall out of Cedric’s mouth. 
(Them is the object of the preposition without. In case 
you’re wondering, it’s a dental bridge.)
Lester added an amendment to the bill concerning us. (Us 
is the object of the preposition concerning.)
 
One of the most common errors in the use of object pronouns 
involves the prepositional phrases between you and I and 
between you and me. Which one is correct? The phrase is 
between you and me. Between is the preposition. You and me 
are the objects of the preposition. Me is an object pronoun. I 
is a subject pronoun, so you can’t use it here.
Test your pronoun knowledge. Which sentence is correct?
 
A. According to Elton and she, the elephant’s nose is 
simply too long.
 
B. According to Elton and her, the elephant’s nose is 
simply too long.
Answer: Sentence B is correct. According to is the preposition. 
The object of the preposition is Elton and her. Her is an object 
pronoun. (She is a subject pronoun.)
Most of the tough pronoun choices involve a sentence with a 
preposition that has more than one object (Elton and her, for 
example). Your ear for grammar will probably tell you the cor-
rect pronoun when the sentence has a single pronoun object. 
You probably wouldn’t say according to she because it sounds 
funny.
 
If a sentence has a preposition with more than one object, try 
this tip: Cover one of the objects with your finger and then 
say the sentence. Does it sound right?

 Chapter 10: Tackling Other Troublemakers 147
A good part of speech to end 
a sentence with?
As I write this paragraph, global warming is increasing, the 
Pacific Ocean sports a trash pile twice the size of Texas, and 
reality TV shows are still on the air. In the midst of these truly 
troubling events, some people still walk around worrying about 
where to put a preposition. Specifically, they worry about 
whether ending a sentence with a preposition is acceptable. 
Let me illustrate the problem:
Tell me whom he spoke about.
Tell me about whom he spoke.
 
Here’s the verdict: Both sentences are correct for most 
people and even for most grammarians. However, if you’re 
writing for someone who loves to tsk-tsk about the decline of 
proper English, avoid placing a preposition at the end of 
a sentence.
Deleting Double Negatives
In some languages, the more negatives the better. In English, 
two negatives are a no-no. (By the way, no-no is not a double 
negative; it’s just slang for something that’s prohibited.) Here 
I explain some of the trickiest forms of double trouble.
If you think this is a useless grammar rule, think again. A 
double-negative mistake can completely wreck your sentence, 
because in English, two negatives make a positive.
 
The simplest way to correct double-negative errors is to 
eliminate one of the negatives. For example, instead of 
saying, “I haven’t never been to California,” say, “I haven’t 
been to California” or “I’ve never been to California.” 
Or just go to California, which will eliminate the issue 
altogether.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
148
One of the most common double negatives doesn’t look like 
one: can’t help but. Consider an example:
Eggworthy can’t help but act in that dramatic style 
because he was trained by a real ham.
The not (inside the word can’t) and the but both express nega-
tive ideas. Use one or the other — not both:
Eggworthy can’t help acting in that dramatic style because 
he was trained by a real ham.
 
Another phrase to avoid in formal English is can’t hardly. Can’t 
is short for cannot, which contains the negative not. Hardly 
is another negative word. If you combine them, you say the 
opposite of what you intend — the positive instead of the 
negative. Here’s an example:
According to Lola, Ella can’t hardly wait until her divorce 
becomes final.
What the writer thinks the sentence means: Ella is eager 
for her divorce to become final.
What the sentence actually means: Ella can wait. (The 
palace is comfy, and Larry isn’t around much.)
Right: Ella can hardly wait until her divorce becomes final.
Also right: Ella can’t wait until her divorce becomes final.

A
ll the grammar rules in the world mean nothing if no 
one wants to read what you’ve written. As a writer, you 
have multiple goals: You need to communicate with a specific 
audience in a way that’s appropriate, compelling, clear, and 
concise. This chapter offers tips for doing just that, regardless 
of whether you’re writing an e-mail, an annual report, or an 
80-page thesis.
Identifying Your Audience
Good grammar is essential, but good is tough to pin down 
because the language of choice depends on your situation. 
For instance, imagine that you’re hungry. What do you say?
Will you accompany me to the dining room?
Do you feel like getting a sandwich?
These statements illustrate two types of English: formal 
English and conversational English. Before you can choose 
which English to use, you need to know your audience.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
150
Keeping it formal
At the pickiest end of the language spectrum, formal English 
displays the fact that you have an advanced vocabulary, a 
knowledge of etiquette, and a command of standard rules of 
English usage. You may use formal English when you have 
less power, importance, and/or status than the other person 
in the conversation. Formal English shows that you’ve trot-
ted out your best behavior in his or her honor. You may also 
speak or write in formal English when you have more power, 
importance, and/or status than the other person. In that case, 
you want to impress, to create a tone of dignity, or to pro-
vide a suitable role model for someone who is still learning. 
Situations that call for formal English include
 
✓ Business letters or e-mails (from or between businesses 
as well as from individuals to businesses)
 
✓ Communications to teachers
 
✓ Homework
 
✓ Important conversations (for example, job interviews, 
college interviews, parole hearings, congressional inqui-
ries, and so on)
 
✓ Letters or e-mails to government officials
 
✓ Office memos or e-mails
 
✓ Reports
 
✓ Speeches, presentations, and oral reports
All the grammar lessons in this book deal with formal English 
because that’s where the problems are fiercest and the 
rewards for knowledge are greatest.
Knowing when conversational 
English will work
Conversational English doesn’t stray too far from your English 
class rules, but it does break some. You can relax, but not 
completely. It’s the tone of most everyday speech, especially 

 Chapter 11: Improving Your Writing 151
between equals. Conversational English is — no shock here — 
usually for conversations, but here are some writing situations 
when it’s acceptable:
 
✓ Comments in Internet chat rooms, bulletin boards, and 
so on
 
✓ Friendly letters to relatives
 
✓ Notes, e-mails, instant messages, and texts to friends
Conversational English has a breezy sound. You find more 
contractions (don’t, I’ll, would’ve, and so forth). You may also 
skip words (Got a minute? Be there soon!), especially if you’re 
writing in electronic media with a tight space requirement. 
(For more on electronic communication, see “Writing for 
Electronic Media” later in this chapter.)
In written form, conversational English relaxes the punctuation 
rules, too. Sentences run together, dashes connect all sorts of 
things, and half sentences pop up regularly. I’m using conver-
sational English to write this book because I’m pretending that 
I’m chatting with you rather than teaching grammar in a class-
room situation.
Cutting Ties with Your Computer 
Grammar Checker
Your best friend may tell you that learning correct grammar in 
the third millennium is irrelevant because computer grammar 
checkers make human knowledge obsolete. Your friend is wrong.
 
It’s comforting to think that a little green or red line will tell you 
when you’ve made an error and that a quick mouse click will 
show you the path to perfection. Comforting, but unreal. English 
has a half million words, and you can arrange those words a 
couple gazillion ways. No program can catch all your mistakes, 
and most programs identify errors that aren’t actually wrong.
Spelling is also a problem. Every time I type verbal, the com-
puter squawks. But verbal — a grammar term meaning a word 
that comes from a verb but doesn’t function as a verb — is a 
real word. (In fact, I devote a whole section to verbals later 

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
152
in this chapter.) Nor can the computer tell the difference 
between homonyms: words that sound alike but have different 
meanings and spellings. For example, if I type
Eye through the bawl at hymn, but it went threw the 
window pain instead.
the computer underlines nothing. However, I was actually 
trying to say
I threw the ball at him, but it went through the window 
pane instead.
 
The computer knows some grammar and spelling, but you 
have to know the rest.
Giving Your Writing Punch 
with Great Verbs
To engage your reader, you want to create active, energetic 
writing. The best way to do so is to choose active, energetic 
verbs. In this section, I show you how.
Staying active
Verbs can have two voices: active and passive. Take a look at 
these two examples:
“The window was broken yesterday,” reported Eggworthy, 
carefully hiding his baseball bat under the sofa.
“I broke the window yesterday,” reported Eggworthy, 
regretfully handing his baseball bat to his mother.
How do the two versions differ? Grammatically, Eggworthy’s 
statement in the first sentence focuses on the receiver of the 
action, the window, which received the action of breaking. The 
verb is passive because the subject isn’t the person or thing 
doing the action but instead the person or thing receiving the 
action. In sentence two, the verb is in active voice because the 
subject (I) performed the action (broke). When the subject is 
acting or being, the verb is active.

 Chapter 11: Improving Your Writing 153
Here are some active and passive verb examples:
Lulu gives a free-tattoo coupon to Lola. (active)
Lola is persuaded by Lulu to get a tattoo. (passive)
Roger persuades Lulu to visit the tattoo parlor too. 
(active)
Lulu is tattooed by Lola. (passive)
 
Unless you’re trying to hide something, or unless you truly 
don’t know the facts, you should make your writing as specific 
as possible. Specifics reside in active voice. Compare these 
two sentences:
The president of the Egg-Lovers’ Club was murdered 
yesterday.
Sir Francis Bacon murdered the president of the Egg-Lovers’ 
Club yesterday.
Clearly, the active-verb sentence provides more information: 
It tells you the murderer’s name. Knowing is usually better 
than not knowing, and active voice — which generally pro-
vides more facts — is usually better than passive voice.
Active voice is also better than passive because active voice 
tends to use fewer words to say the same thing. Compare the 
following sentences:
Lulu was failed by the teacher because the grammar book 
was torn up by Lulu before it was ever opened. (20 words)
The teacher failed Lulu because Lulu tore up the grammar 
book before opening it. (14 words)
If you’re writing a letter or an essay, switching from passive 
to active voice may save you one-third of your words — and 
therefore, one-third of the reader’s energy and patience.
 
Some questions on the SAT and ACT ask you to revise a sen-
tence by choosing the best of five possible versions. Fairly 
often, the correct answer changes the passive verb of the 
original to active voice.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
154
Knowing when “there is” 
a problem
In my writing class, I always ask the students to describe a 
standard school chair. Inevitably, I read sentences like these:
There is a curved seat.
There are five slats on the back.
Nothing’s wrong with these sentences. They’re grammatically 
correct, and they’re accurate. But I bet they made you yawn. 
There is and there are, as well as their cousins — there was, 
there will be, there has been, and others — are standard (and 
therefore boring) expressions. How about swapping them for 
something stronger? Here you go:
The seat curves to fit your bottom.
Five slats support your back.
 
In a writing sample for the SAT or other standardized test, 
graders watch for sophisticated usage. They want to see that 
you can manipulate language. There is/are sentences aren’t 
very sophisticated, though they can sometimes be useful. 
When you find yourself constructing a sentence this way, 
pause. Can you come up with a more interesting verb?
Recognizing that your writing 
“has” issues
If they’re overused, forms of to have can also put your reader 
to sleep faster than a sedative. Sometimes, nothing works 
better than to have, but too often, has, had, or have ends up 
in a sentence because the writer is too lazy to think of some-
thing more creative. Try changing
The chair has a shiny surface.
The slats have rounded edges as big as my finger.
to

 Chapter 11: Improving Your Writing 155
The chair shone under the fluorescent light.
The rounded edges fit my finger perfectly.
Okay, I added some information to the second set, but you 
see my point. Shone and fit are more interesting than has and 
have. Plus, after you plop in a good verb, other ideas follow, 
and the whole sentence improves.
Letting your subjects do more 
than “say” and “walk”
To say and to walk are fine, upstanding members of the verb 
community, but they don’t give you much information. Why 
say when you can declare, scream, whisper, hint, bellow, assert, 
remark or do any one of the zillions of alternatives available to 
you when you’re describing communication? For movement, 
consider stroll, saunter, plod, strut, rush, speed, zigzag, and — 
well, you get the point. Look for verbs that go beyond the basics 
and add shades of meaning to your sentence. Here are some 
before-and-after sentence sets to illustrate how more specific 
verbs pep up your sentences:
Before: Heidi said that she was tired of climbing mountains.
After: Heidi murmured that she was tired of climbing 
mountains. (Here Heidi is a bit shy or perhaps fearful.)
Another after: Heidi roared that she was tired of climbing 
mountains. (In this sentence, no one is going to mess with 
Heidi — not without a struggle!)
Before: Heidi’s hiking partner walked away from her.
After: Heidi’s hiking partner edged away from her. (The 
partner knows that Heidi is in one of her moods, and 
trouble is on the way.)
Another after: Heidi’s hiking partner stomped away from 
her. (Now the partner is angry!)
 
Your word-processing program probably has a built-in thesau-
rus: a reference work that lists synonyms for words, including 
most verbs. You can also buy a thesaurus in book form. If 
you’re looking over your writing and need some spicier verbs, 
a thesaurus can suggest some alternatives.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
156
 
But be cautious: Certain verbs may be similar but not exactly 
the same. For example, the list for stroll includes ramble and 
promenade. You may ramble (or amble, another verb on this 
list) without a fixed destination or purpose. If you promenade, 
you’re probably also in recreational mode, but this time you 
have an audience. Bottom line: Don’t insert a verb (or any 
other word) into your sentence unless you’re sure you know 
what it means.
Deleting All That’s Extra
I live in Manhattan, an island surrounded by water. My 17-story 
apartment building is tall. It was built many years ago in 1929. 
I work as a teacher in a school. I write Dummies books about 
grammar, which explain grammar to readers. I will also con-
sider jumping from the roof of my tall apartment building if I 
have to write any more boring, repetitive, say-the-same-thing-
at-least-twice sentences like these.
Okay, I believe I made my point. Sentences stuffed with filler 
sound silly and condescend to the reader. I mean, really. An 
island surrounded by water — that’s clever. What surrounds 
other islands? Bagels? My Dummies books about grammar 
explain grammar to readers. There’s a shock. I’m sure you 
thought my grammar books explained tai chi or llama-raising. 
And after I wrote repetitive, I didn’t have to tack on say-the-
same-thing-at-least-twice. One word said it all.
 Should you care about wordy, repetitive sentences? For sev-
eral reasons, you should care very much:
 
✓ If you say the same thing over and over again, your read-
ers or listeners tune you out. Why would they pay close 
attention? If they miss something, they assume you’ll go 
over the same ground again.
 
✓ Repetition wastes time, one of the most valuable com-
modities on earth. As one of my Dummies editors once 
remarked, “Say it and move on. Our readers are busy!”
 
✓ If you’re writing under pressure — a school assignment 
or a work project, perhaps — you need fewer minutes to 
accomplish your task if you don’t repeat yourself.

 Chapter 11: Improving Your Writing 157
 
✓ Concise writing sounds strong and confident. Take a look 
at this sentence:
 
 In my opinion, I think that homework should pos-
sibly be considered for banning.
 
  Compare that clunker with this sentence:
 
 Homework should be banned.
 
  Do I have to ask which version sounds more forceful? 
Version 1 fumbles around. Version 2 hits you right on 
the nose.
 
A frequent flyer on the SAT Writing and the ACT English tests 
is repetition. The test gnomes want to know that you can pare 
down your prose to its leanest state without sacrificing meaning.
Spicing Up Boring Sentences
Which paragraph sounds better?
Michael purchased a new spy camera. The camera was 
smaller than a grain of rice. Michael gave the camera to 
Lola. Lola is rather forgetful. She is especially forgetful 
now. Lola is planning a trip to Antarctica. Lola acciden-
tally mixed the camera into her rice casserole along with 
bean sprouts and orange marmalade. The camera baked 
for 45 minutes. The camera became quite tender. Michael 
unknowingly ate the camera.
Michael purchased a new spy camera that was smaller 
than a grain of rice. Michael gave the camera to Lola, who 
is rather forgetful, especially now that she is planning a 
trip to Antarctica. Accidentally mixed into Lola’s rice cas-
serole along with bean sprouts and orange marmalade, 
the camera baked for 45 minutes. Michael unknowingly 
ate the camera, which was quite tender.
I’m going to take a guess that you said the second paragraph 
is better. It’s a bit shorter (62 words instead of 69), but length 
isn’t the issue. The first paragraph is composed of short, 
choppy sentences. The second one flows. Grammatically, the 
difference between the two is simple: The second paragraph 
has more subordinate clauses and verbals than the first.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
158
 
You don’t need to know how to find or label clauses or ver-
bals. However, you should read your writing aloud from time 
to time to check how it sounds. The old saying “variety is 
the spice of life” applies to writing. Use this checklist to see 
whether your writing could use a little hot pepper:
 
✓ Do all your sentences follow the same basic pattern — 
subject-verb or subject-verb-complement?
 
✓ Have you strung a lot of short sentences together with 
and or a similar joining word?
 
✓ Are all your sentences more or less the same length?
If you answered yes to one or more of the preceding ques-
tions, a trip to the spice rack is in order. In this section, with 
a minimum of grammatical labels, I suggest some ways to add 
flavor to blah sentences.
The clause that refreshes
Have you ever seen those diet ads on late-night television? 
The before picture shows someone who has apparently eaten 
a rain forest, and the after picture displays a toothpick-thin 
body. In this section I provide some before-and-after sen-
tences. No diets are involved — just a change from boring 
to interesting. My insertions are subordinate (or dependent) 
clauses, which are italicized. (Subordinate clauses can’t stand 
on their own as complete sentences; see Chapter 4.)
Boring before version: Max sat on a tuffet. Max did not 
know that he was sitting on a tuffet. Max had never seen a 
tuffet before. He was quite comfortable. Then Ms. Muffet 
came in and caused trouble.
Exciting after version: Max, who was sitting on a tuffet, 
didn’t know what a tuffet was because he had never seen 
one before. Until Ms. Muffet came in and caused trouble, 
Max was quite comfortable.
Doesn’t the “after” paragraph sound better? It’s three words 
shorter (32 instead of 35 words), but more important than length 
is the number of sentences. The before paragraph has five, and 
the after paragraph has two. Tucking more than one idea into a 
sentence saves words and makes your writing less choppy.

 Chapter 11: Improving Your Writing 159
Verbally speaking
Verbals are verb forms that don’t act as verbs in a sentence. 
To combine ideas and make your writing more interesting, 
you can use three types of verbals:
 
✓ Gerunds: Verbs that end in –ing and act as nouns or as 
a part of a noun clause. Many of the chapter titles and 
headings in this book start with gerunds. “Improving 
Your Writing,” for example, is a noun clause that starts 
with a gerund. 
 
✓ Infinitives: The word to plus a verb, such as to be, to 
drive, and to prance. Technically, infinitives are never 
verbs, even though everyone — yours truly included — 
tends to refer to them as such.
 
✓ Participles: These critters are parts of verbs (hence their 
name) that may have endings such as –ed, –en, or (like a 
gerund) –ing. Participles describe nouns and pronouns, 
which means they act like adjectives (see Chapter 6). 
One quick example: In the sentence Ella is exhausted, the 
word exhausted is a participle. (It’s a form of the verb 
exhaust that describes Ella.)
Consider a verbal in action. Start with two run-of-the-mill 
sentences:
Betsy’s team lost its 450th game in a row. Betsy thought 
seriously about whether she should bribe the umpire.
Nothing’s wrong with these sentences. But how might you 
approach the same information differently to spice up your 
writing? Here’s one possibility:
Betsy gave bribing the umpire serious consideration when 
her team lost its 450th game in a row.
You may identify the word bribing as a verb, but look at the rest 
of the sentence. Your subject is Betsy, and your verb is gave. 
Where does that leave bribing? In this sentence, it’s a gerund.
Are verbals required elements in your writing? No, but think 
of them as one more color in your crayon box when you’re 
creating a picture. Here’s a before-and-after example:

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
160
Boring before version: Lulu smacked Larry. Larry had 
stolen the sacred toe hoop from Lulu’s parrot. The sacred 
toe hoop was discovered 100 years ago. Lulu’s parrot 
likes to sharpen his beak on it.
Exciting after version: Smacking Larry is Lulu’s way of 
telling Larry that he shouldn’t have stolen the sacred toe 
hoop from her parrot. Discovered 100 years ago, the toe 
hoop serves to sharpen the parrot’s beak.
Labels for those who care: Smacking Lulu is a gerund; 
discovered 100 years ago is a participle; to sharpen the 
parrot’s beak is an infinitive.
Writing for Electronic Media
You may send dozens (even hundreds) of electronic 
messages — whether tweets, texts, or e-mails — each day. 
Why do I bother including a section in this book on media 
that most people are already so comfortable using? Because 
most of those most people don’t spend nearly enough time 
thinking about grammar when writing electronically. In fact, 
I’d wager that most people don’t even proofread their com-
munications before hitting “send” on their computers, cell 
phones, or whatever.
 
If you’re chatting with your mom or best friend, you can be as 
lax as you’d like. But if you’re writing an e-mail or text to a boss, 
teacher, or other authority figure, you need to treat that com-
munication just as seriously as one that’s submitted on paper.
Scoping your audience
Earlier in this chapter, I explain the need to identify your audi-
ence before writing anything. You may assume you never need 
to write in formal English when your means of communication is 
a BlackBerry, but that’s not true. The medium is irrelevant when 
determining how formal your writing should be. What matters — 
as always — is your audience. Consider these guidelines:
 
✓ Focus on the identity of the person receiving the mes-
sage. If he or she is a friend who can practically read 
your mind, formal English isn’t necessary. Abbreviations 
and half-sentences are probably fine, and you don’t need 
to worry about capitalization and punctuation.

 Chapter 11: Improving Your Writing 161
 
 The less friendly the relationship, the more correct your 
language and grammar should be. If you’re writing to some-
one you’ve met only once or twice, don’t chop out letters 
or words unless you know that the recipient appreciates 
informality. Stick to the normal rules for capitalization and 
punctuation unless you’re sure that the message receiver is 
comfortable with nonstandard English.
 
✓ Consider your relative power. If you’re the boss, you make 
the rules. Your subordinates aren’t going to point out that 
you lowercased a word that should be in caps — not if they 
want to keep working for you! But if your message is going 
up the chain of command, choose formal English.
 
 Most teachers favor formal English. Follow grammar 
rules when you write to anyone in the academic world.
 
✓ Think about the impression you’re trying to make. If 
you’re writing to a potential client, formal language may 
show respect and care. On the other hand, if you’ve got 
an antsy client — the type who wants the work done 
yesterday, if not sooner — a few dropped words or char-
acters may give the impression that you’re speeding 
along on the client’s behalf, too busy for such niceties as 
commas and periods.
 
Save abbreviations such as “ttyl” (talk to you later), “lol” 
(laughing out loud), and “ctn” (can’t talk now) for your “bff” 
(best friend forever). However, some abbreviations are accept-
able in business or academic writing. For example, you may 
begin a message with “fyi” (for your information) and ask for a 
reply “asap” (as soon as possible). If the abbreviation appears 
in a dictionary, it’s probably okay unless you’re writing in an 
extremely formal situation.
Being clear and concise
No matter who the recipient is, you have to get your point 
across. The screens and keyboards of smart phones and 
hand-held devices are as tiny as low-calorie cookies, so send-
ing or reading a long letter isn’t comfortable. Plus, depending 
on the device and cost structure of your carrier, you may pay 
extra if you’re not concise. Some formats even have a charac-
ter limit. The conclusion is obvious: Make your messages as 
short as possible to avoid eye and finger fatigue.

162
 
Compressing your thoughts into the smallest space doesn’t 
get you off the hook when it comes to grammar, however. 
Remember one rule, no matter what you’re writing with, on, 
or to: Be clear!
Your reader has to understand what you mean or your mes-
sage is a failure. With that principle in mind, check out the fol-
lowing guidelines.
Dropping words
When every character counts (such as when you’re texting), 
you may at times break the “complete sentence” rule. (See 
Chapter 4 for a thorough explanation of what constitutes a 
complete sentence.) The most common cut is the subject of a 
sentence. For example, you may type
Left meeting early. No progress.
to someone who knows that despite having an early dinner 
date, you attended a session of that learned (and imaginary) 
society, Grammarians for Punctuation Reform. However, don’t 
omit a subject unless you’re absolutely sure that no confusion 
may result.
 
Articles (a, an, the) and conjunctions (words that join, such 
as and, or, and but) can often be omitted. Just be aware that 
the resulting message sounds rushed and at times strange. 
Can you imagine typing, “I went to bar”? Somehow, the makes 
a big difference.
Dropping punctuation and capital letters
Some hand-held devices automatically correct your typing 
by inserting capital letters and a period after you’ve typed 
two spaces. Others don’t. I realize that capital letters may be 
a pain to type when you’re on the go, but I’m in favor of that 
little extra effort. Ditto for periods. Yes, some people text
saw helen after the meeting
and civilization as we know it hasn’t yet crumbled. But don’t 
you like this version better?
Saw Helen after the meeting.

 Chapter 11: Improving Your Writing 163
Or
I saw Helen after the meeting.
Okay, maybe you don’t. But some people, including me, do. 
Why take a chance on offending your reader?
 
Dropping a comma or a period usually isn’t crucial. However, 
don’t skip anything that adds meaning, such as question 
marks. Take a look at these two text messages:
Dinner at 5
Dinner at 5?
Obviously, they express two different ideas. The first assumes 
attendance, and the second is an invitation.
Structuring an e-mail message
In this section, I walk you through the parts of an e-mail, 
explaining the best format to use when you’re writing to 
someone who expects good grammar.
The heading
Atop every e-mail is a little box with a heading, which includes a 
subject line — the title of your e-mail. Most people follow stan-
dard capitalization rules for the subject line (see Chapter 8). 
Whatever you do, be sure to proofread your subject line before 
sending the message. You don’t want a message with a messed-
up title being replied to, forwarded, and spread to your entire 
office.
The greeting
The message often begins with a greeting (in English-teacher 
terminology, a salutation). These are all acceptable greetings, 
complete with punctuation:
Dear Ms. Snodgrass, or Dear Ms. Snodgrass: (The one 
with the comma is less formal. Begin the message on the 
following line.)
To whom it may concern: (This one always has a colon and 
is ultra-formal. Begin the message on the following line.)

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
164
Hi, Lola. or Hi, Ms. Snodgrass. (Use these forms for 
friends and acquaintances. Begin the message right after 
the period, not on the next line.)
Some writers drop the greeting altogether. No problem, 
unless you happen to be writing to traditionalists, who prefer 
the time-honored formats.
The body
When writing your message, follow the grammar rules out-
lined in the rest of this book, matching your level of formality 
to the identity of the person you’re writing to.
The closing
If you haven’t bothered with a greeting, don’t worry about a 
closing either, unless you want to “sign” your name at the end 
of the message. If you like a big send-off, try one of these:
Best, (short for “best regards” and good for formal and 
informal e-mails)
Sincerely, (formal)
See you soon, (informal)
Hope to hear from you, (somewhere between formal and 
informal)
Regards, (formal and a little old-fashioned)
You can also close your message simply by typing your name 
(Lola or Ms. Snodgrass) or your initials (LS for “Lola Snodgrass”).
Proofreading before you send
 
Type carefully, and reread what you typed before sending the 
message. (You may also want to run spell check — just don’t rely 
on it completely.) Some people easily decode mistyped words 
as they read, but do you want to risk having your wrods — oops, 
I mean words — turn into a puzzle? And even if your reader can 
understand what you’ve written, do you really want to leave 
him with the impression that he means so little to you that you 
couldn’t bother typing 17 little words correctly for him?

Ten Ways to Improve 
Your Grammar Every Day
In This Chapter
▶ Making reading a priority
▶ Training your ear to hear proper grammar
T
his book helps you learn grammar, but it’s not the only 
way to improve your communication skills. Lots of other 
resources can also help you in your quest for perfect language. 
In this chapter, I suggest ten ways you can improve your gram-
mar just by making small changes to your daily routine.
Pick Up a Good Book
You probably won’t get far with Biker Babes and Their Turn-
ons or You’re a Butthead: The Sequel to Snot-Nose. But good 
books usually contain good writing, and if you read some, 
pretty soon your own speech and writing will improve.
 
How do you know whether a particular volume contains good 
writing? Check the reviews, ask the bookstore clerk, or read 
the comments on the book’s jacket. Classics are always a 
good choice, but you may also find modern texts, both fiction 
and nonfiction, written according to the best grammar rules.
The point is to expose your mind to proper English by reading 
a few pages every day. When you read, you hear the author’s 
voice, and you become accustomed to proper language. After 
a while, correct grammar sounds natural to you, and you 
detect nonstandard English more easily.

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
166
 
If your schedule is so hectic that you can’t find time for even 
a few pages a day, listen to books on tape when you’re in the 
car. You’ll still benefit from the exposure to good writing.
Read the Newspaper
Well, read some newspapers. Years ago I started to “pay” 
my students one point for each grammar error they found 
in print. I eventually had to rule out a couple of publications 
because it was just too easy to gather material. Opt for peri-
odicals like The New York Times, The Washington Post, or The 
Wall Street Journal instead. Read news articles with a gram-
marian’s eye, absorbing how the writer expresses an idea.
Sample Some Magazines
If all the words in the magazines you read are in bubbles above 
brightly colored drawings, you may not find complete sentences 
and proper pronoun usage. However, most published writers use 
at least the fundamentals of good grammar, and you can learn a 
lot from reading publications aimed at an educated audience.
 
How do you know whether a publication is aimed at an educated 
audience? Check the articles. If they seem to address issues that 
you associate with thoughtful readers, you’re okay. Need some 
suggestions? Check out The Atlantic Monthly, Harper’s, National 
Geographic, The New Yorker, or Vanity Fair. Reading well-written 
magazine articles gives you some models of reasonably correct 
grammar. And, as a side effect, you’ll learn something.
Delve into Strunk and White
The best book ever written on writing is The Elements of Style 
(Allyn and Bacon). This book is so tiny that it fits into your 
shirt pocket. Authors William Strunk, Jr. and E. B. White (yes, 
the fellow who wrote Charlotte’s Web and Stuart Little) tackle a 
few grammar issues and make important points about style.
 
How can such a little book become part of your daily routine? 
You’ll spend an hour reading it and a lifetime absorbing its 
lessons. Whenever you write — whether an e-mail or a 30-page 
report — ask yourself what Strunk and White would do.

 Chapter 12: Ten Ways to Improve Your Grammar Every Day 167
Surf the Web
I can’t leave this one out, though the Internet contains as 
many traps as it does guiding lights. Type grammar in a search 
engine and press enter. Sit back and prepare yourself for a 
flood of sites explaining the rules of grammar. Some sites are 
very good; some are horrible. University- or school-sponsored 
Web sites are usually a safe bet.

Review Style Manuals
What’s a style manual? It’s a publication that contains more 
grammar rules than any human being needs to know, and when 
you’re writing a paper or report, it’s your bible. Your teacher, 
boss, or other authority figure will tell you which style manual 
to follow. (If she doesn’t, you should ask.) For example, your 
teacher may ask you to follow MLA style, which means that you 
use the rules published by the Modern Language Association. 
Your boss may prefer The Chicago Manual of Style or The New 
York Times Manual of Style and Usage. Or your workplace may 
have its own internal manual of style, which trumps all others.
Confession time: I don’t expect or even want you to read a style 
manual every day. Even professional grammarians don’t like 
style manuals that much. But these resources are great to have 
on hand whenever you write something substantial because 
they tell you in detail where to put every punctuation mark ever 
invented, what to capitalize, how to address an ambassador, and 
lots of other things that you never really wanted to know. 
Watch High-Quality TV Shows
When I say to watch high-quality TV shows, I’m not talking 
about programs with audio tracks that are mostly grunts, such 
as wrestling. I’m referring to shows in which people converse. 
Programs on the nerd networks are a good bet. You know the 
shows I mean — the ones whose producers assume that the 

Grammar Essentials For Dummies 
168
audience wants to learn something. The screen has a lot of talk-
ing heads (images of commentators, not the rock band) with 
subtitles explaining why each is an expert. Pay attention to the 
words. Don’t expect to pick up the finer points of grammar on 
TV, but you can get some daily practice with the basics.
Peruse the News
News broadcasts on radio, TV, and the Internet are fine 
sources of literate (okay, semi-literate on some networks) role 
models. In just a few minutes each day, you can train your ear 
for grammar at the same time that you find out about current 
events. Just think of the advantage when you need a pick-up 
line. Instead of “Come here often?” or “What’s your sign?” you 
can mention the West’s diplomatic stance on Iran. (On second 
thought, maybe you should stick to astrology.)
Not sure where to find a good news broadcast? Try tuning 
into a local radio station that carries National Public Radio 
programming.
Download Podcasts
Though the Internet has been blamed for the death of lan-
guage by (in my opinion) hysterical, anti-technology types, 
you can find terrific material online, some of which contains 
proper English. Download audio or video podcasts on your 
favorite subjects (tennis, anyone? how about ancient Egyptian 
poetry?) and pay attention to the language — what people are 
saying and how they’re saying it. Your ear for good grammar 
will sharpen over time.
Listen to Authorities
Listen! Your teacher or boss probably says that word often, and 
you should (pause to arrange a dutiful expression) always do 
what your personal Authority Figure says. Apart from all the 
other reasons, you should listen in order to learn better gram-
mar. By speaking properly, he or she is probably giving you 
English lessons along with descriptions of the Smoot-Whatever 
Tariff Act, the projected sales figures, and so forth.
