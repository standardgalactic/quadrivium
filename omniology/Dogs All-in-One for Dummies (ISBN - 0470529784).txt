Stanley Coren is best known to the public for his popular books on dogs and 
on general psychological issues. However, within the scientifi c world, he’s 
also a highly respected scientist, a Professor of Psychology at the University 
of British Columbia, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.

His engaging writing style and his broad knowledge about the behavior of 
dogs and people have made his books The Intelligence of Dogs, Why We Love 
the Dogs We Do, What Do Dogs Know? How to Speak Dog, The Pawprints of 
History, How Dogs Think, Why Do Dogs Have Wet Noses?, and Why Does My 
Dog Do That? all bestsellers. Roger Caras, President of the ASPCA, and 
himself a best-selling author of dog books, noted, “Stanley Coren has an 
incredible gift — the ability to take the most complex matters and make it 
all seem so simple and clear.” Perhaps this is why Coren was named Writer 
of the Year by the International Positive Dog Training Association and is a 
sought-after contributor to a number of national dog and pet magazines, 
including Pets Magazine, Modern Dog, AnimalSense, Dog and Puppy Basics, 
and AKC Gazette.

dogs, and he has received awards from several major police dog organizations, 
including the California Canine Narcotic Dog Association and the British 
Columbia Police Canine Association. His work with and knowledge of dogs 
has often caught the attention of the media, and he has been the subject of 
feature articles in People Magazine, USA Today, Time Magazine, Maclean’s, 
US News & World Report, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, San Francisco 
Chronicle, Washington Post, and others. His affable manner has also made 
him a popular guest with the broadcast media, and he has been featured on 
numerous television programs, including Oprah, Larry King Live, Dateline, 
20/20, Maurie Povich, Good Morning America, Charlie Rose, and the Today 
Show. He currently hosts the national TV series Good Dog! in Canada.

Connie Isbell, the author of Rabbits For Dummies and Rabbit Adoption For

this interest in animals and nature into her work as an editor and writer for 
Audubon magazine. She has also edited countless pet books, on everything

her husband, two daughters, and an assortment of pets.

Jack and Wendy Volhard share their home with two Labrador Retrievers, 
a Landseer Newfoundland, three Standard Wirehaired Dachshunds, and one 
cat. The dogs are more or less well trained, depending on whom you ask, 
and the cat does his own thing. All are allowed on the furniture but do get off 
when told. The Volhards are true practitioners — they have obtained more 
than 50 conformation and performance titles with their dogs.
Through their classes, lectures, seminars, and training camps in the United 
States, Canada, and England, the Volhards have taught countless owners 

how to communicate more effectively with their pets. Individuals from 
almost every state and 15 countries have attended their training camps. 
Veterinarians, breeders, trainers, and dog owners like you regularly 
consult them on questions about behavior, heath, nutrition, and training. 
Internationally recognized as “trainers of trainers,” they’re also award-
winning authors, and their books have been translated into three languages. 
In addition to their work together, both Jack and Wendy are well recognized 
in the training community for their individual accomplishments.
Jack is the recipient of fi ve awards from the Dog Writers Association of 
America (DWAA) and has been an American Kennel Club obedience judge for 
30 years. He’s the author of more than 100 articles for various dog publica-
tions and the senior author of Teaching Dog Obedience Classes: The Manual for 
Instructors, known as “the bible” for trainers, and Training Your Dog: The Step-
by-Step Manual, named Best Care and Training Book for 1983 by the DWAA.
Wendy is the recipient of four awards from the DWAA. She’s the author of 
numerous articles, a regular columnist for the American Kennel Gazette, and 
the coauthor of fi ve books, including the Canine Good Citizen: Every Dog Can 
be One, named Best Care and Training Book for 1995 by the DWAA, and The 
Holistic Guide for a Healthy Dog, now in its second edition.
Wendy, whose expertise extends to helping owners gain a better understand-
ing of why their pets do what they do, developed the Canine Personality 
Proﬁ le, and her two-part series, “Drives — A New Look at an Old Concept,” 
was named Best Article for 1991 in a Specialty Magazine by the DWAA. She 
also developed the most widely used system for evaluating and selecting 
puppies, and her fi lm, Puppy Aptitude Testing, was named Best Film on Dogs 
for 1980 by the DWAA. Wendy specializes in behavior, nutrition, and alterna-
tive sources of health care for dogs, such as acupuncture and homeopathy, 
and has formulated a balanced homemade diet for dogs.
Chris Walkowicz has been deeply involved with the dog world since 1965. 
She and her husband, Ed, have raised and shown German Shepherds and 
Bearded Collies under the Walkoway banner (along with three sons and a 
daughter, under the Walkowicz banner).
Chris is an AKC dog show judge, as well as an award-winning author of dog 
books, columns, and articles. She is active in rescue, and her goal is to put 
all rescue groups out of business — by helping all dogs to fi nd loving homes. 
The best way to accomplish this is through advising prospective buyers 
how, why, when, and where to fi nd the perfect dog. Her book Choosing a 
Dog For Dummies does this, in addition to helping people determine who 
should — or shouldn’t — own a dog. And for those who are ready for the 
adventure, this book can help you determine which breed to choose.

Chris is the president of the Dog Writers Association of America. Among her 
accomplishments are DWAA Best Book, the DWAA Communicators Award, 
and the title of FIDO Woman of the Year. But more important, she says, is her 
philosophy: “If I can save just one dog’s life, my work will be worthwhile.”
M. Christine Zink, DVM, PhD got her fi rst dog, an Irish Wolfhound, the day 
she graduated from Ontario Veterinary College with her DVM. From an 
initial interest in obedience, mainly as a survival tactic, she gradually became 
fascinated with all aspects of canine performance. While competing in 
performance events throughout Canada and the United States, Chris 
recognized a signifi cant information gap. Owners and trainers wanted to 
know more about how canine structure and medical or physical conditions 
affect their dogs’ performance, and how to keep their canine teammates 
healthy and injury-free. Yet little information was available. She therefore 
wrote the award-winning Peak Performance: Coaching the Canine Athlete, a 
comprehensive guide to the dog as an athlete. Her second book, Jumping 
from A to Z: Teach Your Dog to Soar, coauthored with Julie Daniels, has 
become the gold standard for jump training.
Chris presents Coaching the Canine Athlete seminars worldwide to rave 
reviews and regularly writes for dog magazines. She is also a consultant on 
canine sports medicine, evaluating canine structure and locomotion and 
designing individualized conditioning programs for active dogs. Chris has put 
out more than 50 titles in agility, obedience, hunting, tracking, and confor-
mation on dogs of several different breeds from the Sporting, Working, and 
Hound groups. 
In her other life, Chris is a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of 
Medicine and is credited with more than 100 scientifi c publications. There 
she teaches medical and veterinary students and does AIDS research.

Introduction
W
elcome to Dogs All-in-One For Dummies! This book is just what the 
title implies: a soup-to-nuts reference on all things dog. Dog health, 
dog training — not to mention dog gear, dog grooming, dog breeds and 
breeding, even dog sports. Whether you’re looking to adopt a dog, trying to 
improve your relationship with one you have, or trying to come up with fun 
things to do with your furry pal, this book contains something for you.
No other animal has had such a long and close relationship with humans. 
Wolves started becoming domesticated some 15,000 years ago, by some 
estimates, and spread all over the world. They helped protect early human 
settlements, they were with the ancient Romans and Greeks and Egyptians 
in their glory days, and they may have even accompanied the first migration 
from Siberia across the Bering Strait into North America.
Dogs have always had jobs to do. Whether it was herding other animals, help-
ing hunters and fishermen earn their living, going to war, protecting royalty, 
keeping communities rodent free, or pulling sleds, dogs have earned their 
place in history and in the hearts of animal lovers everywhere. Thousands 
of years of breeding to do those different kinds of work have shaped the 
sometimes wildly different bodies and personalities of hundreds of breeds. 
They’ve come a long way from their gray wolf ancestors, who were attracted 
to campfires and hoping for a handout.
Nowadays dogs are mainly companions. It’s this slight discrepancy between 
what dogs think we still want them to do — what we bred them to do for so 
long — and what we actually want them to do now that is the source of much 
misunderstanding between the canine and human worlds. This book aims to 
correct some of that by helping you see things from the dog’s point of view.
About This Book
First, here’s what this book is not: It’s not a textbook, nor a long-winded his-
tory, nor a rote learning tool. Lots of those kinds of books are on the market, 
if that’s what you’re looking for. No, Dogs All-in-One For Dummies is a gen-
erous conglomeration of practical material from several For Dummies dog

Dogs All-in-One For Dummies 
books. It aims to cover the gamut, from what those funny “thumbs” are 
called (dewclaws), to picking out a crate, to the fine art of getting around 
dog-hostile rules and regulations.
Most of the material within these pages is relevant to any breed and any age 
of dog, though there are special sections for puppies, and the chapters in 
Book V cover each breed recognized by the American Kennel Club, one at a 
time.
Conventions Used in This Book
Important words are defined in italic. Key words in lists that bring important 
ideas to your attention are in bold. And all Web addresses are in monofont 
to set them apart.
Most of the time, the word dog is used to refer to any individual of the spe-
cies Canis lupus familiaris. However, among the more exclusive world of dog 
breeding and showing, a dog means the male form, and the female, to the 
delight of Bart Simpson, is called a bitch.
The names of proper, recognized breeds are capitalized.
What You’re Not to Read
There are many sidebars (in shaded gray boxes) in this book that you don’t 
really need to read to follow the chapter text. They contain extra information 
or background stories and history that you may be interested in, or not. Feel 
free to skip anything marked with the Technical Stuff icon, too.
Foolish Assumptions
Dogs All-in-One For Dummies doesn’t assume that you know anything about 
dogs to begin with. It starts from zero and builds from the ground up — and 
then keeps going and going. It contains straightforward, informal explana-
tions of processes such as choosing to adopt a dog, grooming, going to the 
vet, exercising and training, and so forth.
This book is designed for just about anyone who loves dogs or wants to know 
more about them. It is as useful for people who have never had a dog in their

 Introduction
lives as it is for those who have always had dogs. Even advanced dog lovers 
or even devotees of specific breeds will find plenty of valuable information 
in these pages, including teaching tricks, performing first aid, competing in a 
dog show, and even the magical art of breeding itself.
Regardless of your situation, experience, or motives, this book’s goal is to 
give you enough information so that, ultimately, you can enjoy and find out 
more about dogs on your own.
How This Book Is Organized
Dogs All-in-One For Dummies is sorted into six “books,” organized around gen-
eral areas of interest, so you can drill down and find what you need to know 
quickly.
Book I: Choosing and Bringing 
Home a Dog
This is probably the most important step in dog ownership, yet it’s one most 
people don’t spend nearly enough time on. The wrong choice here can and 
does haunt frustrated folks for years. Chapters 1 through 4 are devoted to 
different aspects of what to consider when picking out your new companion. 
Chapter 5 looks at the delicate process of bringing your adopted dog into 
your home. Chapter 6 helps you accessorize, discussing all that great stuff 
you see in pet stores and describing what you definitely need — and what 
you may just want to get because it’s fun. Chapter 7 gets a bit into dog psy-
chology and tries to help you understand the world from your canine room-
mate’s point of view. And Chapter 8 looks at the various laws and regulations 
society places on our four-legged friends.
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health
The chapters in this book focus on various aspects of keeping your dog 
bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. Chapter 1 gives you the scoop on dog food, 
including what kind to buy, what to avoid, and how much to feed. Chapters 2 
through 4 look at vaccinations and health issues, canine first aid, and visits to 
the veterinarian. Chapter 5 is all about one of the most important things you 
can do to make your dog’s life full and wonderful: exercise, and plenty of it. 
Chapter 6 considers special issues in caring for an aging dog. Sooner or later, 

4
Dogs All-in-One For Dummies 
all dogs head into their twilight years, which brings up painful decisions. 
Chapter 7 is for readers who are crazy enough about their breed — or just 
crazy enough, period — to attempt their own breeding program.
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next 
to Dogliness: Grooming
Your dog may be your best friend, but at the end of the day, she’s still a hairy 
animal, and something has to be done about that to maintain a certain rea-
sonable level of hygiene and, shall we say, acceptable odor and appearance. 
Chapter 1 delivers the basic of dog grooming, including the tools you need to 
get and how to use them. Chapter 2 delves into the fine art of brushing and 
bathing your furry pal. In Chapter 3, you discover how to take care of your 
dog’s eyes, nose, teeth, ears, and a place or two you might be surprised, if 
not alarmed, to find needs your attention. In the last chapter of this book, 
Chapter 4, you get to play barber.
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows
You can teach an old dog new tricks, it turns out. And you can train almost 
any dog to do a lot more than you thought, probably. First things first, though: 
housetraining in Chapter 1. Chapters 2 and 3 cover teaching your dog man-
ners and basic commands, respectively. In Chapter 4, you start to get into 
fun and fancy tricks, and Chapter 5 might be the most fun of all. If you 
haven’t seen dogs run an obstacle course, you’re really missing out. Finally, 
in Chapter 6, you step into the klieg lights and get a taste of what it takes to 
become one of those people running around a ring with a dog.
Book V: Meet the Breeds
The sheer variety of dogs in the world is truly amazing. The American 
Kennel club recognizes 192 breeds, and each of them is profiled here in these 
chapters. Dog breeds are organized into “groups,” and the chapters follow 
that organization. Hence, you find chapters on the Toy, Working, Herding, 
Hunting, Terrier, Sporting, and Non-Sporting breeds. And last but not least, 
you find a chapter on those lovable mutts, the mixed breeds, and discover 
that some mixed breeds are becoming nearly as popular as standard breeds.

 Introduction
Book VI: Resources
Finally, after you’ve come so far in your dog study, you may want to go even 
farther. A world of dog information of every conceivable kind is out there just 
waiting for you to explore. This book offers two chapters. One is a glossary 
of terms to help you interpret some of the things your vet or true dog-fanatic 
friends might say. The other is a treasure trove of dog resources to feed your 
fascination even more.
Icons Used in This Book
You’ll see five icons scattered around the margins of the text. Each icon 
points out a certain type of information about the world of dogs. They go as 
follows:
 
This icon notes something you should keep in mind. It may refer to some-
thing covered earlier in the book, or it may highlight something you ought to 
remember in the future.
 
This icon flags the boring (but sometimes helpful) stuff. Feel free to skip 
text with this icon. On the other hand, you may be interested to know extra 
details or little-known trivia about the topic at hand — in that case, by all 
means, read away.
 
Information marked with this icon usually tells you something that can come 
in really handy, saving you time, money, or heartache. Sometimes it refers to 
especially helpful ideas and advice that can enrich your canine experience.
 
This icon points out stuff you should avoid or things that may be dangerous 
to you or your dog.
 
This one flags information that’s especially for dogs under a year old.

Dogs All-in-One For Dummies 
Where to Go from Here
If you’re a true dog neophyte, you may as well start with Chapter 1 and follow 
along from there. If you don’t have a dog yet, head straight to Chapters 2 
through 5 in Book I. If you just adopted a dog and are wondering what you do 
now, head to Chapters 5 through 8 in Book I.
Otherwise, use the index and table of contents to zoom in on whatever your 
particular area of interest may be. Feel free to skip around and explore!

Book I
Choosing and 
Bringing Home a Dog

In this book . . .
P
icking out the right dog for your temperament and 
lifestyle may be the most important dog-related thing 
you ever do. The first few chapters here cover the history 
of dogs and the universe of things to consider when 
choosing your new pal. The rest of the chapters help you 
bring your adopted dog into your life, decide what your 
dog needs in terms of accessories, comprehend your 
dog’s point of view, and understand the laws that govern 
dogs in society.

Chapter 1
What Are Dogs and Why Do 
They Behave That Way?
In This Chapter
 Going back in time to see how dogs became dogs
 Seeing how evolution affects your relationship with your pooch
 Helping your dog successfully learn
 Finding out why dogs behave the way they do
You can offer your dog no greater gift than to understand her and her 
whole being. In other words, you need to walk a mile in her paws. Even 
though money can buy a lot of dog biscuits and squeaky toys — and those 
pricey obedience classes can encourage greater responsiveness to you — a 
lot more is going on behind the scenes than the simple recognition of the 
“Sit” command. This chapter begins your journey of discovering the mystery 
that is your dog. You discover the evolution of your dog and how it affects 
your relationship.
The History Behind the Beast: 
How Dogs Came to Be Dogs
The goal of this book is to help you understand your dog from her vantage 
point. It helps you to discover what it must feel like to be a dog and to under-
stand your role and capacity to shape your dog’s behavior after you’ve devel-
oped empathy for her experience.

Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Remember that your dog isn’t merely a four-footed person in a fur coat. Your 
dog isn’t a wolf in disguise either. Though some proponents of dog psychol-
ogy emphasize the common ancestry between dog and wolf, your dog is 
more than a tamed version of any of its wild descendants, be it wolf, jackal, 
fox, coyote, or dingo. Your dog and these other canine species do share a lot 
of characteristics, both in physical makeup and behavior, but humans share 
a lot of physical and behavioral characteristics with apes. Does that mean 
we’re just like other apes? Not exactly.
 
Wolves and dogs are part of the larger order Carnivora (animals that are meat 
eaters and mostly live by hunting). Even though each dog has a secondary 
classification specifying its distinctions, all are categorized by biologists as 
canines and members of the same biological family, Canidae — as are wolves, 
foxes, jackals, and coyotes.
If you were to line up all modern domesticated animals in the order in which 
they were domesticated, you would see that dogs lead the pack. In fact, dogs 
were brought into the human circle well before humans even knew how to 
grow their own food.
 
Recent evidence based on the fossil record suggests that dogs were domesti-
cated between 17,000 and 14,000 years ago, which is much earlier than sheep 
(11,000 years ago) or cats (7,000 years ago). Domestication seems to have 
occurred at different times in different places, with dogs first domesticated 
in Asia and Russia, and then separately in the Middle East, Europe, and North 
America.
In this section, we explore a little canine history.
In the beginning
From the beginning, dogs and humans naturally formed an everlasting rela-
tionship. Both species were hunters that lived and survived through a depen-
dency on a close-knit hierarchical group. The main advantage humans had 
over canines was the ability to learn and reason. However, in comparison to 
others in the animal kingdom, canines also were (and still are) intellectually 
advanced.
Even though the wild ancestors of dogs were efficient and daring pack hunt-
ers, they also scavenged when the opportunity arose. Scavenging around 
human campfires proved fruitful and was certainly less dangerous than hunt-
ing some of the larger hoofed animals that could kick and gore. When they 
were regularly presented with free meals, wolf packs weren’t above taking 
advantage of leftovers. Such leftovers were often dumped just outside the

Dog
camp or village in heaps that archeologists call middens. For the wolves, mid-
dens were a veritable buffet of free food that was being continually renewed.
What sensible wolf would rather hunt when such easy pickings were avail-
able? And perfectly happy to oblige, the humans appreciated the value of 
having another species about that would make use of their waste while simul-
taneously keeping their camp varmint and odor free.
 
Now perhaps if the relationship had just stopped there, no further domesti-
cation would have occurred. However, humans and canines share another 
important similarity — namely, both are territorial. Wild canines came 
to view the area around the camp as their territory. As a result, when a 
threatening wild animal or a marauding band of strangers came close to 
the encampment, the canines created a commotion. The noise gave enough 
warning for the inhabitants of the camp to rally some form of defense, which 
was especially useful at night. As a result of the vigilance of these canines, 
the lives of the nearby humans became much safer.
Wolves initiate domestication
The domestication of dogs wasn’t simply a matter of some Stone Age man 
finding a wolf pup and bringing it home where it would be fed, sheltered, and 
treated like a dog. It may sound surprising, but the first stages of domestica-
tion were probably initiated by the wolves themselves.
 
The only wolves that could benefit from discarded food were those that 
could comfortably coexist with humans. If a particular wolf was aggressive 
or threatening, he was simply killed by the human residents as a matter of 
safety. This process began a kind of human-enforced natural selection — the 
genetic elimination of the most destructive individuals. Animals that were 
friendlier and less fearful could stay closer to the settlement. In addition to 
the free meals, the close proximity to humans provided them protection 
from predators that preferred to avoid human contact. When these friendlier 
canines began to interbreed, they ultimately generated a race of animals that 
were much more doglike. In these new animals, the genes for tameness were 
predominant.
 
Domestication takes more than simply taming a wild animal. A tame animal 
allows a human to care for it and accepts human presence and control to 
some degree. A domesticated animal, however, is actually genetically modi-
fied. Humans exert control over its breeding patterns, which leads to an 
animal that’s drastically different in both physical appearance and behavior 
than its wild ancestors. Certainly no one would ever mistake a Pekingese or a 
bulldog for a gray wolf based on what they look like and how they act.

12
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Consider some research done by the Russian geneticist Dmitry K. Belyaev, 
who was trying to re-create the domestication of dogs. He decided not to 
use wolves because, in many areas, evidence suggests that domestic dogs 
have interbred with wolves and any dog genes would contaminate the data. 
Instead, he used another canine species: the silver fox. Also, because silver 
fox fur is prized for making expensive garments, he saw the potential for 
some economic benefits if he could domesticate these foxes and make them 
easier to raise on a farm.
The form of genetic manipulation that Belyaev used was similar to what 
occurred naturally around prehistoric villages with wild canines. He looked 
for the animals who were the tamest — the least fearful and least aggressive. 
The tamest and friendliest animals were bred with other tame and friendly 
animals, and after only six generations, noticeable differences existed 
between the tame and wild foxes. After 35 generations, this research created 
animals who looked and acted so much like dogs that they could be sold 
as pets and live in a human family. If you saw one of them walking down a 
street, you’d most likely believe that you were looking at some exotic breed 
of domestic dog.
 
What really happened to change a fox into a dog? Genetic changes aren’t 
governed by a simple process. Because of the ways that our chromosomes 
are constructed, it turns out that if you want to change one specific feature 
genetically, you often end up changing other characteristics as well. That’s 
exactly what happened when researchers began to breed foxes in a way that 
encouraged the genes associated with friendliness and tameness. It hap-
pens that these traits are linked to other genes so that selective breeding 
for tameness actually changed Belyaev’s foxes physically and behaviorally. 
The resulting genetic mix actually changed the timing and rate of physical 
Don’t try to tame a wolf
Research shows that instantaneous domes-
tication just isn’t possible. Researchers have 
often tried hand-feeding wolf puppies from 
birth and rearing them with a human family. 
The results have been far from satisfactory. In 
virtually all the scientific studies, as the wolf 
cubs matured, they became more wolflike in 
their behavior. The previously “tame” cubs, for 
instance, began to stalk and hunt farm animals, 
other house pets, and even children, growing 
ever more socially dominant and challenging 
their people for control. Even though tame wolf 
puppies can learn basic obedience commands, 
they stop responding to them when they’re 
adults and begin challenging the authority and 
status of humans. Many reports tell of suppos-
edly domesticated wolves attacking and biting 
their handlers.

and psychological development in these new “dogs” so that they physically 
appear more doglike as well.
Humans make the second move
Because the wild canines hanging around the prehistoric camps were more 
docile and friendly, some clever Stone Age person realized that if the canines 
would protect whole camps, why couldn’t one protect an individual hut? 
Protection at a personal level. Hmmm. . . . This development turned out to be 
a fortunate choice because, in the end, dogs would demonstrate other behav-
iors that would help keep early man (and his successors) alive by doing the 
following:
 
 Acting as a warrior or comrade in arms
 
 Assisting in herding flocks of animals
 
 Finding items by scent, including food, lost people, and property
 
 Participating in military actions or acting as a guard against attack
 
 Serving as a hunting partner to flush, run down, and capture game
The end result: Perpetual puppies
In truth, what the domestication process accomplished was to arrest dog 
development in a very puppylike state. In essence, domestic dogs are the 
Peter Pans of the canine world.
Neoteny refers to certain features normally found only in infants and young 
juveniles but which in certain animals persist into adulthood. In Figure 1-1, 
you can see that many physical features of an adult domestic dog resemble 
those of a wolf puppy more than those of an adult wolf. Common physical dif-
ferences between wolves and dogs come about because of neoteny. As you 
move down the arrow, you move farther away from adult characteristics and 
toward more puppylike features.
 
In terms of human relationships with dogs, the behavioral aspects of neoteny 
are most important. Dogs keep a number of puppylike behaviors that wolves 
lose as they mature. These puppy behaviors are what make dogs fine com-
panions (versus the adult canine behavior that makes wolves so difficult to 
tame). Table 1-1 offers an interesting look at what the adult wolf behavioral 
characteristics are like compared to the wolf-puppy characteristics that you 
see in dogs.

Understanding the Evolution of the 
Dog and Human Relationship
Is your dog a wolf in sheep’s clothing? Well, yes and no. Suffice it to say that 
dogs approached domestication at their own speed. There was no cosmic 
moment when some brave young child, holding a wolf pup, approached his 
father and said, “Please, Dad, can we keep it?” Instead, domestication was a 
slow evolutionary process involving a gradual progression that began with 
curious wolves who drew closer and closer to our ancestors’ campfires. 
Domestication shows the marked physical changes that characterize the 
dogs we know today. This section gives you a brief history of the evolution.

16
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
People and dogs: A parallel evolution
Our relationship with dogs began during a time when survival was our only 
focus. During this time, dogs provided personal protection and hunting 
assistance.
For eons, dogs and humans evolved in parallel. During the agricultural era, 
for example, we modified our selection process to produce dogs who would 
cull the varmint population and others who would herd livestock. As king-
doms grew, massive dog breeds were shaped by a process of manual selec-
tion to guard castles and aid wars. The selection process has continued 
throughout time, and today more than 400 different dog breeds — all devel-
oped for particular tasks — populate our globe.
Except for in a few instances, most dogs’ special talents are rarely needed. 
But don’t tell your dog that; it would be too depressing for him, because he 
thinks his abilities are still in high demand.
Which wild canines became dogs?
More than 30 different species of wild canines 
are candidates for the first animal that humans 
domesticated into a dog, but which species 
did humans actually take into their homes and 
make their closest animal companion?
DNA evidence suggests that the first wild 
canine that was domesticated was the gray 
wolf. However, other types of wolves and also 
jackals, coyotes, wild dogs, dingoes, and even 
some varieties of fox got into the mix as well. 
As a result, any one dog may have a combina-
tion of genes from all these various members 
of the canine family. Researchers know this 
fact because domestic dogs can interbreed 
with any of these species (the exception being 
some of the common fox species, such as the 
red fox, which have the wrong number of chro-
mosomes). The offspring from such matings are 
live, healthy, and fertile, which is usually taken 
as evidence that they’re all the same species 
or, according to evolutionary theory, at least 
have a relatively recent common ancestor.
This research suggests that the dog at your side 
may be some random mix of genes, descended 
from perhaps 40 percent wolf, 30 percent jackal, 
and 30 percent coyote, while another breed 
may be 60 percent wolf, 10 percent jackal, 15 
percent arctic fox, and 15 percent dingo. No 
wonder so many different breeds have so many 
different physical appearances, behavioral 
styles, and personalities.

Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing

Dog
Seeing how domestication 
shaped dogs’ personalities
 
Dogs’ devotion to people was hard wired upon domestication. The canine 
species is the only species that will look to and take direction from another 
species (humans) as if it were their own.
In Chapter 3 in Book I, you discover how to identify your dog’s temperament 
and how it shapes her understanding of the world you share. For example, 
a dominant dog assesses everyone who enters, whereas a timid dog hides 
under the table when the doorbell rings. Embracing your dog’s personality 
helps you orchestrate a training program to normalize your life together.
Unlike humans, who learn by listening, your dog is much more attuned to 
nonverbal communication — from how you hold your body (especially in 
moments of tension or stress) to where you focus your eyes. Understanding 
your dog’s concept of language can help you understand her behavior and be 
understood in kind.
 
If you consistently look at your dog, she may interpret your interest as a need 
for leadership. So remember this little jingle: The more you look at your dog, 
the less she’ll look to you.
A dog’s senses never change: Dealing 
with sensory overload
To really consider life from your dog’s perspective, you need a new nose. 
Dogs rely most heavily on their sense of smell to interpret even the most 
minor aspects of their surroundings, such as when another animal may have 
passed through or even the stress hormone of a visitor in your home.
In your dog, the sense of sight (a human’s strongest sense) is blurred and 
limited. Your dog only can recognize a limited range of colors and is more 
attuned to the motion of an object than its particulars. Dogs don’t rely on the 
recognition of fine details of objects. Rather they were born to be hunters 
with the motto, “If it moves it might be food, and I’ll chase and catch it!”
Your dog’s hearing abilities are much different than your own, and this dif-
ference can be traced to the evolution of our separate species. Humans are 
more sharply attuned to the sound of other human voices, whereas dogs 
are capable of hearing higher frequencies and fainter sounds. Because dogs 

18
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
evolved from hunters, their hearing is more attuned to the sounds that their 
potential prey might make.
Unfortunately, dogs’ sensory strengths are rarely appreciated today. An 
apartment dog is admonished each time he alerts to the sound of a footstep; 
hounds are scolded for getting into the trash; and all breeds are reprimanded 
for chasing the family cat. In our world, dogs are on sensory overload and yet 
they’re expected to ignore everything.
Influencing Your Dog’s Learning
Dogs love to learn and feel connected to group activities. So how you develop 
as a teacher and translator directly affects their enthusiasm for learning 
and, in turn, for life. Think of each lesson and highlighted word as though 
you were teaching a foreigner your language. Lift “Sit,” “Wait,” “Down,” and 
“Good” beyond mere command status; instead, make them verbal directions 
that show your dog how to act in everyday situations.
Book IV lays out all the tricks of the trade, exploring learning influences and 
emotional responses. In addition, the chapters in that part help you make 
sense of the different schools and methods of training your dog.
Keeping age in mind
Whether you have a puppy or an older dog, you can appreciate that time and 
experience will make a difference in your dog’s behavior. A young puppy, 
who’s often interpreting many of life’s nuances for the first time, watches 
your actions carefully and is influenced by how you behave. An older dog, 
however, who may have studied many human responses, may be less influ-
enced by your activities — unless, of course, they’re unusual or unexpected.
 
Chapter 5 in Book I highlights how to best acclimate your puppy and lists 
the ideal lessons to introduce at different stages. It also stresses the critical 
importance of early socialization and how encounters with various people 
and places can change your dog’s life forever.
Dogs age quickly. Even though many of their life processes mirror ours, their 
timeline accelerates at ten times our rate. By age 3, your dog is a mature 
adult, by 7 most have reached middle age, and by 10, many are heading into 
their twilight years. It’s a reality that can’t be ignored or avoided. Chapter 6 
in Book II is devoted to the care of an aging dog.

Putting commands to work
 
There’s no one approach to encouraging good behavior. Each dog is unique 
and may respond better to one technique than another. A clearly orches-
trated attempt to educate yourself and understand the different methods 
available will keep your training effort fresh and alive.
Even though a dog can recognize up to 165 different commands, or word 
cues, your goals need not be so lofty. Table 1-2 lists six example commands 
that are most useful for navigating your life together. After you have these 
directions firmly planted in your dog’s memory bank, they form the founda-
tion for controlling your dog’s behavior. Their use reassures your dog of her 
place in your family and her vital inclusion in your world.

Ain’t Misbehavin’: Examining Dog 
Behaviors and Human Responses
No matter how livid you feel when your dog disobeys you or damages prized 
possessions, you won’t influence his routines until you sit down and listen to 
his side of the story. Sure, your half-eaten pair of shoes cost $95, but to your 

20
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
dog, its enticing aroma (a perfume called “You”) was impossible to pass by. 
This section leads you through the most common frustrations, from house-
training to anxiety-driven behavior and on to aggression, in an effort to shape 
your ability to respond in a manner that your dog understands.
Why dogs act out
Just as people do, many dogs act out when they feel misunderstood, restless, 
or needy. If you walk around claiming that your dog is reacting out of spite, 
then in your mind, her every reaction will be tainted by that view — even 
though “spite” is not an emotion that dogs have. If you keep shouting “Bad 
dog!” every time your dog makes a wrong move, what option does she have?
 
Dogs, like children, are motivated by what gets attention. However, it often 
appears that dogs can’t differentiate positive attention from negative. So if an 
action gets a reaction — any reaction — it will get repeated.
Furthermore, negative attention can be misperceived as being rough play 
or confrontation. Thus, a dog who steals from the counter may feel prize 
envy when her people react uproariously. A smart dog will simply wait until 
people have left the room and then (minus competition) carry the prize off to 
a more secluded space. Chapter 2 in Book IV examines what can be done to 
address misbehavior.
Dissecting daily frustrations
You may have a real issue with some of your dog’s behaviors, but it’s unlikely 
that he’s even aware of the issues. Even though a pee-stained carpet can 
raise your blood pressure, from his point of view the carpet is just as absor-
bent as the grass, and whether his accident was motivated by need or dis-
traction, he did what came naturally.
Now, don’t get stressed. You don’t have to live with a dog who urinates on 
the carpet, jumps on company, or chews your slippers. However, recogniz-
ing that your dog’s behavior isn’t motivated by spite, vengeance, or guilt can 
ease your frustration.
 
Common complaints that dog owners have about living with their dog 
include barking, chewing, jumping, and house soiling. Each behavior, though 
disruptive and aggravating, may be a perfectly normal sign of a dog who has 
bonded well and is trying to get along within the family unit. Reorganizing his 
outlook may require some effort and intervention, but the process usually 

21

and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
takes less time and is less stressful than coping with the current frustrations 
that have become status quo.
Reality bites: Inside canine aggression
Aggression is the one behavior that warrants a red flag on any playing field. 
Though biting is sometimes perfectly understandable, dogs simply aren’t 
allowed to bite human beings (or other animals) — unless, of course, they’ve 
been trained to such ends or are legitimately defending their territory.
Dogs who bite are excluded from activities, relinquished to shelters, or euth-
anized. So before your dog shows any signs of aggression, it’s wise to under-
stand what motivates her and do what you can to prevent it. The chapters in 
Book IV cover many aspects of training.
 
No book for home use can address the needs of a dog who’s exhibiting a full-
blown aggressive response and threatening the safety of family members, 
neighbors, or other animals. Even though this book gives you the means to 
recognize the nature of your dog’s behavior and some ways to deal with it, if 
your dog has seriously bitten someone, or is really scaring you because she’s 
threatening to bite, you must seek professional advice.

 Making sure there’s room in your life for a dog
 Calculating the cost of dog ownership
 Identifying your pet-owner responsibilities
 Taking a dog for a test drive
You’re on the mark. You’re set. You’re ready to run . . . straight to the 
nearest pair of wistful puppy eyes. Whoa, there! Ever hear about those 
times when people could kick themselves? Mm-hmm. This is one of them.
If you buy a shirt that doesn’t fit, it’s no big deal. You simply return it or give it 
away. Poor magazine choices can be recycled or canceled. When you cave in 
to puppy love, though, it’s a dog of a different color. The time for making deci-
sions about whether to buy — as well as how, when, and where to do it — is 
before you look into those big brown eyes. Putting a cute pup down and walk-
ing away is downright impossible, especially after she snuggles close to you 
and licks the tip of your nose.
The wide and wonderful world of dogs boasts more than 400 breeds of 
canines. Finding a puppy seems like a simple task, but it can be overwhelm-
ing when it comes to finding just the right dog — the perfect dog — for you. 
This chapter helps you sort through the whens, wheres, and hows of finding 
a dog.
If everyone buying or breeding dogs were to strive to become responsible pet 
owners, then the people who are involved with rescues and shelters could 
turn their energies toward raising funds for veterinary research, conducting 
education seminars, or simply having more time with their own dogs.

Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
 
After getting them home, dogs must have physical care to thrive. The neces-
sities of life include shelter, coat care, fresh water, good-quality food, preven-
tion of illness, companionship, and medical treatment when needed. Over 
the centuries, human society has changed wild, self-sufficient canines into 
domesticated pets who can’t provide for themselves. True, as long as the 
large, white porcelain water bowl in the bathroom is kept flushed, all but the 
smallest dogs can find water. Oh, and yeah, occasionally a bread crust is nib-
bled beneath the baby’s chair or a steak is snarfed from the countertop. But 
other than those accidental waterings and feedings, dogs are pretty much 
dependent upon us.
Returning a pup after human and canine hearts become connected is painful 
for all involved. Similarly, disposing of a dog because you’ve satisfied a tem-
porary whim is unfair. And, last but not least, impulse decisions can lead to 
a lifetime of regret. So right now — before you buy — is the time to examine 
your lifestyle, facilities, and pocketbook. Forethought eliminates later pain 
for dogs and people. This chapter can help you decide whether you’re ready 
for the commitment. After your self-examination, you may find that a dog 
isn’t a good choice for you at all. You may find that you’d be better off with a 
cat, a fish, or a pet rock.
Considering Your Lifestyle
Before your heart is set on a new dog, you need to ask yourself the following 
questions:
 
 Is this the right time for adding a dog to my life?
 
 Am I emotionally capable of devoting a lot of time and energy to taking 
care of a living creature’s every need, from now to perhaps a dozen or 
more years down the road?
 
 Does my work schedule allow for time to take care of a dog?
 
 Is my household/neighborhood a good place for a dog to live?
 
 Who’s going to watch the pup when I go away?
Contemplate all aspects of your life, present and future. Even though you 
may not currently have small children, consider the possibility of becoming 
a parent. Also think about visitors, neighbors, or grandchildren. Everything 
involves some risk. Children can love dogs too much by hugging them too 
tightly, and they can also fall on them, pick them up in the wrong way, or 
even drop and seriously injure them, especially Toy breeds or puppies.

25
 Chapter 2: What You Need to Know Before You Choose a Dog

Dog
However, it isn’t always the dog who’s injured. Rowdy canine play can result 
in a child being knocked over or scratched. Small or timid dogs can snap if 
cornered. Herding dogs sometimes instinctively round up their charges by 
nipping at heels or behinds. Guardian breeds may take their jobs too seri-
ously, especially when “intruders,” such as visiting children, engage in rough, 
noisy play. You still can choose your ideal dog even though you have chil-
dren, but you may want to wait until they’re a few years older.
 
Scheduling a family meeting and obtaining the approval of everyone who’ll 
share the household with the pet is a good idea, even if you’ll be the main 
caretaker. The dad who grudgingly buys Junior a dog hoping to teach the 
lad responsibility will be up to his neck in doggie doo within a week. When a 
sullen teenager promises he’ll take care of the pup, you need to get real.
Some people who have grown up with pets know that a dog is a treasured 
friend. For some, it doesn’t make any difference how busy they are; they simply 
wouldn’t think of being without a dog — no matter what the obligations — any 
more than they would decide to isolate themselves from human family or 
friends. But even lifelong dog lovers need to realize that circumstances may 
change regarding finances, living quarters, or leisure time. Perhaps having a 
dog still is possible, but you must choose wisely. You pay the price, and the 
dog suffers the consequences when you make the wrong decision.
 
Don’t ever buy a dog as a surprise gift for someone. Buying a pet for an 
unsuspecting friend or relative is one of the worst ideas you can ever have — 
dumber even than getting matching his-and-hers socket wrench kits for your 
anniversary.
The Money Angle: Keeping 
Canine Expenses in Mind
Dogs truly are love that money can buy. But the expense surely doesn’t end 
with the purchase. Even a dog given to you by a puppy-burdened co-worker 
doesn’t come without expensive needs. Sure, the love and affection are free, 
but unfortunately, other life necessities are not. Even free dogs cost money.
A medium-sized dog can easily eat, chew, and barf his way through more 
than $900 a year. No skimping on generic dog food for this prince of a pup, so 
figure $300 for quality food. Dog tags average anywhere from $10 to $50. Even 
if your dog is healthy all year, his veterinarian bill can still runs $200 or more 
for exams, vaccinations, flea control, and heartworm prevention. For a dog 
who needs professional grooming, tack on at least another $150 per year. Oh, 

26
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
and do you like to go on vacation? If you don’t take the dog with you every 
time, you may have to pay someone to dogsit. If you add in the occasional 
dog walker, you can tack on another $100 a year. You like to buy fancy treats, 
right — and Frisbees, tennis balls, real bones, and elaborate dog toys and 
accessories? Add another $100. That’s without replacing the chewed base-
boards, couch cushions, and shoes. Not to mention all those training classes 
you’ll want to try. 
 
Large-sized dogs, such as Labs, Great Danes, and Mastiffs, have bigger tum-
mies to fill and more square inches to groom. They also need larger doses of 
medications and preventives as well as bigger and more expensive collars 
and housing.
 
The first year of dog ownership is often the costliest. Puppies need lots of 
supplies and preventive care to start a good life. Bowls, housing, blankets, 
brushes and combs, nail clippers, collars, and leashes all need to be on your 
list of supplies to buy. Other smart investments include training classes and 
fencing for either your yard or an exercise area.
If you’re interested in a purebred pup, also keep in mind that prices can 
be quite hefty depending on the breed and the breeder’s reputation. Dogs 
with impressive pedigrees and real show prospects are almost always more 
expensive.
Last but not least, what about you? What shape are your finances in? Are 
you starting a new business or saving for a new home? If so, you may want to 
wait a bit of time to get a pet. After all, if unexpected and unplanned expenses 
occur lifewise or dogwise, will that extra mouth to feed still be considered a 
valuable part of the family — or another albatross around your neck? Writing 
out the check to the dog breeder won’t be the last time your pup cracks open 
your checkbook or picks your pocket (sometimes literally).
Recognizing Your Responsibilities
Responsibility. You know how much you hated that word when your folks 
first lectured you about it? Well, it follows you the rest of your life. When you 
adopt a four-legged dependent and take this hairy creature into your home, 
you’re as responsible for him as much as if you’d brought him into the world. 
He deserves to be fed, housed, and given vet care for the rest of his life. A 
pup needs boundaries set for behavior, and these boundaries must be taught 
to him in a fair, humane manner — otherwise he’ll go as far out of bounds as 
any normal human teenager. The difference is that most human kids don’t 
bite when they’re out of control.

 Chapter 2: What You Need to Know Before You Choose a Dog
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
Dogs need exercise and mental stimulation to be mentally and physically 
healthy. They can’t do this by themselves, however. Even with a huge, safely 
fenced area, they won’t constantly run around and play unless someone can 
join their pack and share in the fun. They also may pick inappropriate ways 
to entertain themselves when left to their own devices — chewing the siding 
off the house, digging in the prize petunia patch, or barking at imaginary 
friends.
Some dog owners view the responsibilities of ownership as a pleasure. When 
you compare caring for a dog with some other responsibilities, such as teach-
ing a teen to drive (and actually handing over the keys), paying bills, and cov-
ering college tuition, your dog’s needs are relatively simple:
 
 Exercise
 
 Food and water
 
 Safety
 
 Shelter
 
 Training
 
 Vet care
Even though they’re simple, the items in the preceding list are essential. 
Provide these things, and you ensure that you have an appreciative, loving 
buddy for a long time to come.
 
Without these essentials, however, you not only compromise your dog’s 
health, but you also risk turning him into a creature with less than desirable 
habits, including
 
 Barking all night
 
 Biting
 
 Making the Persian rug the puppy potty
 
 Stealing food
 
 Turning the antique credenza into toothpicks
 
Before you buy a dog, be sure that you’re ready to accept the responsibilities 
of ownership — all of them. When you’re truly ready to be a dog owner, the 
rewards are many.
Besides nurturing your exciting new relationship with your new best friend, 
you’re also responsible for developing at least one more with your veterinar-
ian. Good vets (and there should be no other kind) recommend everything 

28
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
you need to do to ensure the health of your dog for many years. You can find 
more on vets in Chapter 4 in Book II. You may also have a new bond with a 
breeder. A responsible — there’s that word again — breeder always answers 
your questions, cheers you on, and shares your sorrow a dozen years down 
the road. See Chapters 3 and 4 in Book I for more information on breeders.
 
Choose vet relationships wisely. During conversations with the doctor and 
his staff, you’ll have good or bad vibes. Pay attention to them. Someone may 
have referred you to this person, but you’re the one who has to deal with him 
in person or on the phone. Follow your gut feeling; if it doesn’t feel right, walk 
away.
Keeping your dog safe
Being a good puppy or dog parent means making certain that your four-
legged friend is safe at all times. Unlike the old days when someone almost 
always was at home, many demands are placed on the time of today’s family, 
whose members are often away from the home front. Puppies are much like 
human toddlers. They’re curious, and when left to their own devices they 
will eventually provide entertainment (and danger) for themselves. This can 
mean chewing on electrical cords, visiting the kids across the highway, or 
swallowing the pork chop bones left in the trash. So it’s important to puppy-
proof your home when you’re away. See Chapter 5 in Book I for more on how 
to do this.
Exercising your pooch
No dog park? No yard? You still can give your dog exercise without jeopardiz-
ing her safety — but exercise she must! Jog with her. Enroll in agility classes. 
Get a retractable leash. These leashes extend the dog’s roaming freedom 
from 16 feet to a whopping 32 feet. However, be sure that you’re adept at 
using one and that plenty of space is open so the dog doesn’t wind the leash 
around trees or legs (painful rope burns!), or, worse, dart in front of a car. 
See Chapter 6 in Book I for more on leashes.
Providing adequate shelter
If you leave your dog outdoors for any length of time, he needs suitable shel-
ter from the sun, rain, snow, and extreme temperatures as well as a respite 
from the public eye. Every dog wants to be alone now and then. He seeks a 

29
 Chapter 2: What You Need to Know Before You Choose a Dog
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
protected place for a nap, for example. And of course fresh water must be 
available at all times, indoors and out.
Here are a few good shelter options that can keep your dog from running 
loose and possibly causing injury to himself or others:
 
 A kennel run (at least 3 x 10 feet, or larger for a big dog) with a house
 
 A crate under a deck or overhang
 
 A doggy door into a garage pen, basement, or house
 
Whatever you do, don’t ever chain a dog and leave him. A chain makes a dog 
feel vulnerable and that he must defend himself. And never use a trolley with 
a sliding attachment; these devices incite dogs to run back and forth. In fact, 
dogs can hang themselves on these contraptions (and have done so) when 
unsupervised. Neighbors are likely to take a dim view of both techniques as 
well, and then you could get an embarrassing visit from an animal protection 
agency.
 
When you can’t be around to supervise your pet, provide a safe house or 
room. The best place — especially for puppies — is a dog kennel. You can 
use either a crate indoors or a secure fenced area outdoors. Some owners 
prefer putting a pup in a kitchen, bathroom, or laundry room while they’re 
gone. Usually these areas can be shut off with a door or baby gate, have little 
to damage, and are easily cleaned when messes occur. If accessible to little 
paws or needle-sharp teeth, items still may be damaged, but at least his life 
won’t be endangered. Try putting a favorite toy — one that’s given to him 
only when he’s confined — in the area and move other items out of reach.
Taking part in training
Training classes make your dog a treasured family member and good citizen. 
In fact, the AKC has a test for all dogs — registered, purebred, or mixed — 
called the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) test. A basic training class teaches 
your dog to become a CGC. Large metropolitan areas offer many choices for 
owners who want to train their dogs. But even out in the boonies, you usu-
ally can find a club or private trainer within a half-hour’s drive. Whether you 
introduce your pooch to training classes or not, be sure to check out Book 
IV, which provides a lot of information on training your dog.
Classes are great, not only for the camaraderie but also for the socialization 
of the dog with others of all sizes and breeds. However, the private trainer 
offers a couple pluses, too. You can arrange training according to your 

30
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
schedule, and the trainer’s attention isn’t divided among a dozen students, 
enabling the trainer to focus on your needs and your dog’s quirks.
 
Puppy kindergarten offers the basics in good house manners. You usually are 
recommended to begin these classes as soon as the pup has been inoculated. 
Formal obedience training can begin any time after the dog reaches 4 months 
of age. These classes aren’t just for competition or for good citizenship. They 
can save your dog’s life. One of the more important lessons is the recall, 
in which your pup learns to come when you call her. Imagine if your dog 
escapes and runs toward a busy street — you can yell, “DOWN!” or “COME!” 
and she’ll do it!
You may have such a good time with the basics that you consider handling 
or agility classes. Usually only those people who intend to show in the 
breed ring attend handling classes. But agility training is for anyone and 
everyone — all sizes and breeds. Agility gives your dog good exercise as 
you race together through an obstacle course. Sometimes it’s difficult to tell 
who’s having a better time — the owner or the dog. Even though speed is 
necessary for top prizes, many disabled, elderly, or just plain clumsy people 
compete for the fun of it.
 
Not all training clubs or private trainers are listed in the phone book. Call 
your vet or the Better Business Bureau for a referral. Talk to other owners 
who’ve been pleased with their training experiences as well.
Remembering essential vet care
A pup needs inoculations to protect against various canine diseases, includ-
ing rabies, distemper, and parvovirus. Each year a dog needs a physical 
exam, any necessary boosters, and heartworm tests. A preventive for this 
dangerous parasite is advised in most areas as well. You also may want to 
consider flea and tick prevention. Regular vet checks help to establish a 
patient-doctor relationship that’s beneficial if an illness or injury occurs.
 
Routine intestinal parasite screenings (fecal exams) are also a good idea, par-
ticularly for pups, because they often carry parasites that are contagious to 
humans.
Testing Your Readiness: Rent-a-Dog
So you’ve just about decided to take the leap and bring a dog into your world. 
A life is involved here, though, so you want to make sure that this is the right 

31
 Chapter 2: What You Need to Know Before You Choose a Dog
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
decision for you. What can you do to make sure that you’re not making a mis-
take? Many people do a little dogsitting sometime before making the plunge 
into pet parenthood. Then they’re aware of some of the agonies of guardian-
ship (albeit temporary) as well as the many ecstasies. Thus, the answer to 
your question is: Borrow a dog.
Offer to help a neighbor who has a new puppy and can’t make it home during 
the lunch hour. You’ll be introduced to overturned water bowls and house-
training accidents. And you’ll swear that the shark from Jaws, rather than a 
10-pound pup, has you by the ankle. Pray that it’s winter so you’ll at least be 
wearing long pants as a protection against those nails when the little darling 
claws its way up your legs to lick you from ear to ear. An earsplitting yodel 
greets you as you arrive, and another mourns your departure.
Thinking about a giant breed? The puppies are so cute and cuddly! But 
babies do have a way of growing up — and fast. Dogsit a Great Pyrenees for 
the week someone’s on vacation. Mop up great goobers. Clean up elephan-
tine droppings from the yard. If you’re really brave, let the beast romp in a 
mud puddle and follow it up with a brushing and a bath. Prepare yourself for 
walks by lifting weights. Long white hair will decorate your wool suit, clog 
your drains, and keep the dog in your memory long after he has returned 
home.
 
Volunteer to provide foster care for a dog when the Humane Society is full. If 
you’re considering a particular breed, contact the rescue organization for the 
breed’s local or national clubs. Just like traumatized children, abandoned or 
abused dogs have nightmares and tortures in their pasts. And like children, 
they need love and attention now. A rescued dog will thank you with a tail 
wag and a lick, and by laying his head upon your knee.
 
After a dog enters your home, she may never leave. Even if she physically 
leaves, she takes a little piece of your heart. Corny? Maybe. Also true.
If you’ve finally decided that you want to take the plunge and introduce a 
dog into your life — perhaps one of the biggest decisions you’ll ever make — 
congratulations! Now you face numerous other choices as you work your way 
toward dog ownership. You need to think about whether you want an adult 
dog or a puppy — both have their advantages. Male or female? Pure breed 
or mixed breed? Great dogs can be found in plenty of places — through 
reputable breeders, humane societies, and breed rescue organizations, to 
name a few. But when you get to the place where you’ll choose a dog, you 
still need to know what you’re looking for in an individual dog. Chapters 3 
and 4 in Book I help you make these decisions (and many more) in narrowing 
down the choices and making sure that you get the right dog for you. And of 
course, all the chapters in Book V introduce you to the unique characteris-
tics of the various breeds.

o many adorable dogs are out there, barking and wiggling to get your 
attention. If only you could take them all home! Of course, you can’t. But 
you can pick the right dog for you by focusing on exactly what you want and 
need in a dog, and determining what kind of dog works best in your home 
and with your lifestyle. The fact that animal shelters are full of dogs is proof 
that too many people buy dogs who aren’t right for them. This chapter helps 
you make smart decisions about the issues involved in selecting a dog so that 
when you do choose yours, you’ll know you’ve considered all the factors.
Sure, you can listen to your heart, but let your brain have the final say.
Puppies Are Precious, but . . .
 
Just look at that fluffy ball of fuzz, those big innocent eyes, that madly wag-
ging tail! Many people who want to adopt a dog are hoping to adopt a puppy, 
and that’s no surprise. Puppies can be practically irresistible. Shelters have 
a much easier time placing puppies than they do older dogs. The downside, 
however, is that many of these puppies wind up back at the shelter as soon 
as they hit that difficult adolescent period — when they’re big, rambunctious, 
and particularly challenging.
Before you insist on a puppy, take a good look at your options. Sometimes 
breed, size, or temperament is more important than a dog’s age. A chubby,

round, yellow Labrador Retriever puppy may be the cutest thing you’ve 
ever seen, but how will you feel when he grows to 75 pounds of explosive 
energy and knocks favorite knickknacks off your coffee table with his big tail? 
Adopting a puppy and adopting an adult dog have distinct advantages and 
disadvantages, so consider the pros and cons of each before making a 
decision.
Pros and cons of adopting a puppy
 
They’re tiny, they’re cute, and they pull at your heartstrings with that fero-
cious little tug-of-war puppy growl. But do you really want to adopt a puppy?
The pros of puppy adoption include the following:
 
 Control over exactly when and how well the puppy is socialized and 
trained, so your puppy learns good behavior early 
 
 An opportunity for you and your puppy to bond right from the beginning
 
 A fun, playful, adorable companion
 
 Short-lived high energy that often (but not always) mellows into mature 
adolescence in one to two years
 
 A longer amount of time together than if you adopt an older dog
The cons of puppy adoption can saddle you with this stuff:
 
 A pet with behaviors you don’t like, if you fail to control exactly how 
well the puppy is socialized and trained.
 
 The chore of housetraining your puppy, a time-consuming and some-
times frustrating task. If you aren’t consistent with your training, you’ll 
have puppy puddles and piles to clean up for what seems like forever.
 
 Chewed up, well, everything. Puppies need to chew . . . a lot. You must 
provide them with appropriate items to chew and keep things they are 
not allowed to chew out of reach. If you tend to leave your expensive 
shoes on your bedroom floor, a puppy may not be right for you.
 
 A seemingly inexhaustible need for more exercise and stimulation than 
most adult dogs. Puppies, by nature, are energetic.
 
 Ill-mannered behaviors. Granted, manners are all human, and puppy 
behaviors are entirely natural. Even so, in our human world, puppies 
have no manners whatsoever. They may nip fingers, jump on people, 
bark at everything, pull on the leash, pick on other pets, dig holes in 
your yard, try to escape the fence to play with the neighbors, and keep

you up at night because they still want to play. You have to teach them 
everything.
 
 An uncertain adult appearance. If you adopt your puppy through a 
shelter or you choose a mixed breed, you can’t be sure of your puppy’s 
parents and you won’t know what the puppy will look like when it grows 
up. Many shelter puppies who look like purebreds grow up to look much 
different as adults.
 
If you have your heart set on a puppy, check out the tips for picking the per-
fect one later in this chapter.
Pros and cons of adopting an adult dog
Adult dogs can make absolutely wonderful adopted pets. After adopting a 
puppy, many people decide never to do that again and vow to adopt only 
adult dogs in the future.
Many adult dogs in shelters are well-behaved family pets who lost their 
homes through no fault of their own. Some dogs are there because their 
owners didn’t know how to manage perfectly natural dog behavior. Others 
are there because their owners got divorced, moved, or died. Others are 
there because they’re no longer the cute puppies to which their owners first 
were attracted. The most common age for dogs to be surrendered to shelters 
is in the difficult adolescent phase and early adulthood, usually between 
about 9 months and 2 years, when dogs typically develop some challenging 
behaviors backed up by a full-grown size. Instead of working on these issues 
with training and socialization, pet owners often just give up.
 
Before you decide that you want an adult dog, consider the advantages and 
disadvantages within the context of your lifestyle. An adult dog may be the 
perfect fit for you because it may already be
 
 Housetrained: Many dogs housetrain young and never forget.
 
 Finished teething: Adult dogs typically don’t chew and nip the way pup-
pies do, although exceptions do exist.
 
 Well versed in basic training: They know how to walk on a leash, obey 
basic cues like “Sit” and “Come,” and generally behave appropriately in 
the house.
 
 Well socialized: Many adult dogs are friendly and accustomed to differ-
ent kinds of people and situations.
 
 More laid back: Adult dogs aren’t quite as wild and energetic as puppies.

36
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
 
 Almost finished with adolescence: Although adolescent dogs initially 
may have high energy, they often (but not always) mellow out, espe-
cially if you provide plenty of outlets for that energy.
 
 More adaptable: Adult dogs are usually willing to bond closely with 
anyone who takes them in, feeds them, and gives them a home and some 
attention.
 
 Many people claim that adult dogs they adopted from shelters and rescue 
groups seem to know that they’ve been given a second chance. These pet 
owners say they get a strong sense of gratitude from their dogs.
 
 A quick study: Adult dogs typically learn quickly and enjoy training ses-
sions as a fun way to spend time with you. You can teach old dogs new 
tricks.
 
 More readily available: Shelters have a harder time placing adult dogs. 
Adopting one saves an animal who may otherwise never find a home.
Despite all the wonderful aspects of adult dogs, they may present their own 
challenges. Be aware of these considerations before you decide to adopt one:
 
 Behavioral problems: Resource guarding — snapping when you 
try to take away food or treats — is a common problem. Others can 
include dislike of children or displays of aggression or self-mutilation in 
response to anxiety.
 
 Bad habits that take extra training to undo: Examples include exces-
sive barking, digging in the yard, and chewing on shoes.
 
 A lengthy adjustment period because the dog was in another home for 
so long: Dogs may mourn lost loved ones or seem depressed.
 
 Difficulty bonding: Some dogs need to be taught to trust humans again.
 
 Too short a time in your life: You may have only a few more years with 
an adult dog. Larger breeds, especially, have life spans of only six to 
eight years. If your adopted Great Dane is already 4 years old, well, you 
do the math.
Dogging it indoors or out
Before you choose a dog, think about where 
you’re planning to keep him. Certain breeds 
must live indoors because they suffer in 
extreme temperatures. Others adapt to virtually 
any weather, as long as they have adequate 
shelter. 
But all dogs do better living inside with the 
family at least part of every day. Bonding is 
even easier when your pet is your shadow by 
day and your foot warmer at night.

Considering Sex and Size
Just as some shelters have a harder time finding homes for adult dogs than 
they do for puppies, many have a more difficult time finding homes for male 
dogs than they do for female dogs. Potential pet owners often say they want a 
female, a factor that sometimes is even more important to them than breed.
 
Yet males and females exhibit virtually no consistent difference in behavior. 
In some breeds, males actually make more affectionate pets, and females are 
more independent and exhibit a higher drive to work. In other breeds, males 
tend to be more aggressive and females are more laid back. But even these 
generalizations have many exceptions. And when pets are spayed or neu-
tered, these differences become even less significant.
 
Trying to predict a dog’s personality based on gender is impossible. Instead 
of merely choosing male or female, look at breed, age, grooming needs, and 
temperament. You may find that your canine soul mate is the opposite sex 
you thought you wanted.
Likewise, size isn’t always an obvious advantage or disadvantage. A lethargic 
giant may take up less space than a tiny dynamo dashing from sofa to win-
dowsill to front door and back to sofa. Given proper exercise, even bigger 
breeds can do just as well in the city as in the country.
Similarly, tiny breeds aren’t necessarily the ideal choice for a family with 
small tots. In fact, many big dogs have a reputation for being easygoing and 
patient with children. Large breeds also aren’t as likely to be injured by a 
slamming door or a toddler teething on an ear. To protect herself, a big dog 
can simply get up and move; she doesn’t need to retaliate with teeth to pro-
tect herself.
Keep in mind, of course, that a larger breed can be more difficult to manage 
simply because of mass weight. Nudging a Komondor over a car seat is a little 
harder than shoving even the most defiant toy breed.
Choosing a Pooch to Match Your Pep
As you’re thinking about what kind of dog you want, consider your own level 
of activity: Are you more like a marathon runner or a couch potato? Choose 
a dog with an energy level similar to your own so you can enjoy activities 
together.

38
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
The amount of activity a dog requires depends not on his size, but on his atti-
tude. Some of the giant breeds, for instance, are happiest when snoozing in 
the sun, whereas high-energy breeds demand vigorous daily exercise. Frisky 
dogs are more in tune with hikers than 80-year-old quilting devotees.
Whatever your hobby may be, you can find a breed of dog eager to join the 
fun. Some dogs are content to lie on the sofa; others require regular, exhaus-
tive exercise. (Also see Book V for descriptions of specific breeds’ needs.)
Factoring In Temperament
Many shelters do temperament testing on the animals they hope to offer for 
adoption. Testing gives them a clear idea of the kind of home that best suits 
the pet and enables them to separate dogs who won’t be able to thrive in a 
home because of bad temperament. Temperament testing can be as simple 
as checking a dog’s behavior with other dogs and people, giving her basic 
commands to see whether she has had previous training, and testing her 
with cats and children.
Some shelters do more intensive temperament testing that follows specific 
methods recommended by certain trainers. Ask your shelter what type of 
temperament testing it has done and whether you can read the test results.
 
Be wary of a shelter that refuses to let you read the results, because it may 
be trying to hide the fact that it doesn’t do any temperament testing. The dog 
may be perfectly adoptable, but you want to know as much as possible about 
the animal you plan to adopt.
Beware of dog
Statistics show that people, homes, and busi-
nesses with doggie doorbells are less fre-
quently victims of break-ins and attacks. Think 
about whether you want a dog who will simply 
announce visitors or one who will protect your 
home. And remember, if you’re looking for 
protection, your choice isn’t limited to large 
breeds. Dwarf or giant, dogs make a lot of 
noise — yaps, growls, and booming barks 
serve as canine alarm systems. For would-be 
burglars, shunning the dog and moving on to 
the next place is simpler than wading into an 
unknown situation. After all, little teeth can hurt 
as much as big ones.

Book I
Choosing

Dog
Evaluating a dog’s temperament is extremely important. It can spell the dif-
ference between a loving relationship with a trustworthy, trainable family pet 
and disaster in the form of injured people, angry neighbors, lawsuits, evic-
tion, and a death sentence for the dog. A pet dog with a bad temperament is 
a serious liability. Bad temperament isn’t the same as behaviors you don’t 
like, such as failing in housetraining or barking too much. Dogs with bad tem-
peraments cannot be trusted around humans or other pets because they are 
either aggressive or so painfully shy or unsocialized that their quality of life 
suffers and they can’t form healthy relationships with people. Remember, shy 
dogs often bite out of fear.
Beyond bad temperaments are variable temperaments. Some dogs are outgo-
ing; some are reserved. Some are vocal, pushy, and assertive; some are shy, 
retiring, and quiet. Temperament is akin to personality and comes in many 
different guises. Understanding a potential pet’s temperament — and your 
own — helps you choose a dog you can live with.
 
Not everyone agrees that accurately analyzing the canine temperament is 
even possible in just a few minutes or after just a few meetings. Determining 
a dog’s temperament is never quick and easy. It involves a careful process 
of observing and interacting with the animal. Some signs of bad tempera-
ment are obvious — growling, snarling, constantly quaking with fear — but 
many signs are not. Other aspects of temperament unfold slowly as the 
dog becomes more comfortable in your presence. Before you adopt a dog, 
arrange several extended visits. The more comfortable the dog is around 
you, the more her real temperament will come out.
Exploring breed temperament
Assessing the temperament of any given dog is tricky, at best. Complicating 
matters are temperaments that once were accepted as part of a dog’s breed 
but now are no longer suitable for pets. For example, working sled dogs, 
hound dogs, guardian dogs, and herding dogs needed extremely high levels 
of energy and endurance, an instinct to run long distances to track down 
game, strong territorial instincts, or instincts for nipping at heels to keep 
livestock in one place. If you’re adopting one of these dogs, you need to know 
about these breed traits.
The breed or mix of breeds in a dog has a big impact on that dog’s tempera-
ment and physical traits, such as his coat and size. Mixed breeds that have 
some sporting dog in them (like Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, 
and German Shorthaired Pointers) are relatively large and have high energy. 
Labrador Retriever mixes (see Figure 3-1) are among the most common dogs 
in animal shelters, often because people expect a placid temperament but are 
overwhelmed with the activity needs of a younger Lab or Lab mix.

Knowing a dog’s natural tendencies is an important key to matching it with 
an individual or family. You can’t expect a Border Collie to act like a couch 
potato or a Jack Russell Terrier not to bark; it simply isn’t in their nature. 
If you do, you’re just setting yourself up for failure and your dog up for 
disappointment.
Ask the shelter or rescue group for help in determining the breed or mix of 
the animal you’re thinking about adopting. Most shelters and rescue groups 
label dogs as a breed or breed mix to give you an idea of what you can 
expect. Consider this information as a guideline for helping you choose a 
dog, but remember that no test can predict or guarantee exact behavior a few 
months down the road. Some general trends in breed temperament include 
the following, but remember that many exceptions exist for every rule:
 
 Sporting breeds: Retrievers, Pointers, and Spaniels are high energy and 
need plenty of activity, but they’re generally easier than many other 
breeds to train.
 
 Large working breeds: Rottweilers, Doberman Pinschers, Great Danes, 
and Boxers tend to be territorial and protective. They need to be thor-
oughly socialized to keep them from becoming aggressive.
 
 Terriers: Jack Russell Terriers, Fox Terriers, Westies, and Schnauzers 
are high energy and bark a lot. They like to dig and jump, and can rarely 
be deterred from chasing small furry animals.
 
 Hounds: Beagles, Dachshunds, and Greyhounds follow scents or moving 
targets without regard to you, traffic, or anything else. They are indepen-
dent and can be difficult to train.

41

 Northern breeds: Siberian Huskies and Malamutes are extremely high 
energy, independent, and notoriously difficult to train. They are great 
at sports like sled pulling but can become destructive without enough 
mental and physical challenge.
 
 Toy breeds: Chihuahuas, Shih Tzu, and Maltese tend to bark a lot and 
can be prone to shyness (as a protective mechanism caused by their 
diminutive size) or aggression when they’re unsocialized or overly pro-
tected. See Figure 3-2 for an example of a toy breed mix.
 
 Herding breeds: Border Collies, Shelties, and Australian Shepherds are 
highly intelligent and trainable. They need a challenging job and plenty 
of exercise, or they can become destructive. Some herding breeds tend 
to nip at heels to keep children, other pets, or anyone else in the herd.

Understanding the basics of temperament
So how do you know what’s good or bad about a dog’s temperament?
First, observe how the dog acts in the shelter or foster home. Is she active 
or laid back? Does she seem nervous or calm? Does she follow people or 
stay closely focused on them? Or is she more concerned with doing her own 
thing, exploring independently, or relaxing as if deep in thought?

42
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Next, observe the dog as you interact with her. Is she interested in you or rel-
atively indifferent? Does she try to engage you in active play and cuddle with 
you, or does she try to avoid you? Does she readily accept petting, or does 
she shy away? Does she jump all over you, or does she stand nicely, waiting 
to see what you do next?
Observing these behaviors takes time and effort, so don’t expect to be able to 
immediately adopt a dog after your first meeting, especially if you have any 
reservations about the dog’s temperament. Spend several “get acquainted” 
sessions with the dog to gain a more accurate feel for her individual personal-
ity. If you know your dog’s breed or can guess what breeds may have contrib-
uted to her mix, you can research the typical temperaments for which each 
breed is known and compare them to the way your potential pet acts.
Although every dog has a unique personality, a few red flags can signal tem-
perament problems that can become difficult to manage in a pet situation. As 
you watch how a candidate for adoption responds to the world, look for the 
following warning signs:
 
 Extreme shyness: A dog with a good pet temperament doesn’t act fear-
ful and refuse to let you touch her. Hiding, cowering, crying, and flinch-
ing at your touch are bad signs. Extremely shy dogs may live stressful 
lives, suffer from ill health, and never really bond with their owners. 
They can also bite out of fear.
 
 Aggression: A serious temperament flaw, aggression puts many dogs 
into the unadoptable category. Signs of aggression include teeth baring, 
growling, lunging, nipping, snapping, biting, and chasing. Aggression can 
be caused by extreme fear, an overdeveloped sense of dominance, a lack 
of trust for humans, past abuse, or a congenital bad temperament.
 
 Avoid any dogs who show signs of aggression toward children or small 
pets. If you do decide to adopt a dog who shows aggressive tendencies, 
be prepared to provide plenty of targeted training with the help of a pro-
fessional who specializes in overcoming aggressive behavior problems. 
Don’t take on this type of project if you have children or if children fre-
quently visit your house.
 
 Hyperactivity: Many dogs, especially puppies and adolescents, have 
high energy and require a lot of exercise and interaction. Such an energy 
level is normal. Dogs who are truly hyperactive usually are so high 
energy that they rarely calm down and are virtually uncontrollable. They 
have a hard time focusing on you, listening to you, or interacting with 
you even after you’ve spent several hours with them. Pet owners will 
have a hard time fulfilling their exercise needs or training them.

43
 Chapter 3: Considering All the Options
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
 
 Discerning the difference between a high-energy dog and a hyperactive 
dog can be difficult at first. Some dogs are hyperactive in adolescence 
and calm down when they’re older, but you probably won’t be able 
to tell whether this situation will be true for your potential pet. Some 
breeds naturally are active, such as sporting dogs like Retrievers and 
Pointers and herding dogs like Border Collies and Shelties. Others got so 
little attention for so long that they simply are frantic to get any atten-
tion they can from you. Neither of these cases is a sign of a hyperactive 
temperament. So before you cross these dogs off your list, remember 
that many dogs just need a loving home, plenty of exercise, and some 
good old-fashioned attention.
 
These general observations can probably give you a basic sense of a dog’s 
temperament, but you also need to hear what shelter or rescue workers have 
observed about the dog you’re considering. They’ve probably interacted 
much longer and more intensively with the dog than you have and thus can 
offer you some good insights.
Go-getters, chill-outers, wait-and-seers
By observing the dog’s temperament, you can begin to get a sense of the 
dog’s personality. He may be outgoing or shy, self-confident or needy, active 
or sedentary, social or reserved. These various personality traits can help 
you determine whether you and the dog are a good match:
 
 The go-getters: These dogs are always on the move, always excited 
about the next new game, project, or travel opportunity. They relish 
the unfamiliar adventure. Go-getters love to hike, run, and play sports. 
Depending on the breed or breed combination, they enjoy engaging in 
high-energy dog sports like agility, flyball, canine freestyle, rally, dock 
jumping, earthdog, disk sports, water retrieving, tracking, and hunting 
tests. They’re active and energetic, great matches for people who lead 
active, physical, athletic lifestyles.
 
 The chill-outers: Although dogs tend to be at their most active as pup-
pies and adolescents, some individual dogs are more laid back. Like 
some people, they tend not to get riled up. Instead, they’re typically 
adaptable and easygoing, and they prefer hanging out or cuddling with 
you on the couch to going for a 5-mile run. Sure, they need exercise and 
enjoy a rousing game of fetch the same as the next pooch, but they gen-
erally are less likely to run you ragged. This canine personality is perfect 
for the more sedentary, stay-at-home type of pet owner who wants a 
companion more than a four-legged dynamo who’s bouncing off the 
walls from boredom.

44
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
 
 The wait-and-seers: These dogs like to hang back a little until they’re 
sure about what’s going on. Rather than plunging into the next new 
event, they’re more hesitant. Whether pausing until they recognize 
something familiar or waiting for the go-ahead from their keeper, these 
dogs are more reserved. They don’t typically dash up to a stranger with 
tail wagging. They may wait patiently or even stiffen and be on guard 
until they’re more sure about the new person.
 
 Guardian breeds, with their long history of serving as watchdogs to 
owner and property, especially tend to be wait-and-seers. Some toy dogs 
also react this way, perhaps out of a sense of self-preservation. (When 
you weigh 4 pounds, you have to be careful who you tangle with!) These 
cautious, reserved dogs make admirable and intelligent pets, and they’re 
excellent companions for people who can spend time with them because 
they typically bond closely to one or two people. If well socialized, they 
can be trusted to act appropriately when around people, without nip-
ping or growling when someone friendly tries to approach you or them.
 
Regardless of the dog’s personality, look for a type of pet that you can deal 
with and relate to. Just as in human relationships, some personalities mesh 
well together; others clash. The dog-human team that meshes has a strong 
foundation for building a relationship.
Thinking about Health and Longevity
Dogs, like people, are living longer. New technology, better nutrition, and 
genetic testing of parents can help increase the life span of puppies. Indoor 
living, routine vet care, and canine laws (no more dogs running loose to be 
poisoned by garbage, squashed by cars, attacked by more powerful animals, 
or shot by angry neighbors) are helping us enjoy dogs longer. Many dogs live 
a dozen years.
It may seem odd to be asking about life expectancy before you even decide 
about a pup, but you can’t change your mind after you’ve given your heart to 
a dog. Just as heart problems or high blood pressure and other diseases can 
run in family lines, certain canine problems can affect breeds or families (see 
next section). You can find a lot of information on doggie healthcare in Book 
II. Book V, on breeds, also contains some health-related information.
 
If you get your dog from a breeder, ask the ages of her oldest dogs. This infor-
mation will give you an idea of how long you can expect yours to live.
Dogs never live long enough. Whenever we lose them, it’s always too soon. 
But knowing their life expectancy prepares us better for the inevitable. As a 

45

Dog
rule, most small breeds outlive larger ones (although teeny-tiny isn’t neces-
sarily better); giants have the shortest life span. Within a breed, however, 
some lines can become canine centenarians.
Generally, old-age symptoms occur as follows:
 
 Small: Qualify as senior citizens at age 13 or 14
 
 Medium: Earn their AARC (retired canines) card at age 11
 
 Large: Usually slow down by age 10
 
 Giant: Often near retirement by age 7 or 8
Any dog can become ill or develop an anomaly, and it isn’t always predict-
able. To increase your chances of having a healthy pet, research breeds you 
like. Talk to a veterinarian about breed dispositions. Ask other owners. And 
remember that many shelter dogs can live just as long as purebreds. The 
bottom line: A knowledgeable buyer has a better chance of finding and rais-
ing a healthy pet.
Signs of a healthy dog
No matter what age, size, sex, or breed you’re looking for, the health of the 
dog you’re considering is one of the most important factors to evaluate before 
you adopt. Although many adopted dogs have minor health issues that are 
easily resolved — a skin irritation, an ear infection, or minor arthritis — 
sound health keeps basic vet bills at a minimum. If you adopt a dog with seri-
ous health problems such as chronic kidney trouble, heartworms, glaucoma, 
or heart disease, the vet bill can quickly skyrocket. Maybe you’re willing to 
take on that expense for the sake of an ailing pet, but unless you’re specifi-
cally prepared to adopt a dog with special medical needs, adopting a healthy 
dog probably is one of your top priorities.
Fortunately, most shelters and rescue groups have dogs checked by veteri-
narians and treated for any health issues before making them available for 
adoption. If you want to adopt a dog who has a minor health problem such as 
ear mites or a skin rash, you can ask the shelter to have these issues treated 
first. Generally, shelters may not have the resources for such treatment, but 
if the shelter’s vet overlooked something, it may be willing to take care of 
the treatment for you. You can expect the shelter to have records of all vac-
cinations, dewormings, pest-control measures, tests, medications, and other 
medical diagnoses or treatments that were administered during the dog’s 
stay at the shelter. In some cases, the dog’s previous owner may be another 
source of information, providing medical records or at least the name of the 
vet who previously cared for the dog.

46
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Beyond written documents, you can tell a great deal about a dog’s health just 
by looking. When you evaluate a shelter or rescue dog, look for the signs of 
bright, vibrant health described in the following sections.
Bright eyes and bushy tails
When first examining a dog, look for a few obvious signs of good health, 
including the following:
 
 Bright eyes: Eyes really do need to be bright and clear, with no cloudi-
ness or discharge. Dogs older than 5 or 6 years may have slight eye 
cloudiness caused by progressive hardening of the lenses; this cloudi-
ness appears as a barely detectible blue in the pupils and eventually 
appears gray. Lens hardening is normal for older dogs, but milky, 
opaque lenses are a sign of cataracts that cause blindness and require 
expensive surgery. Some breeds —Poodles, Shih Tzu, Maltese, and other 
white or light-colored dogs — tend to have tear stains, which are not 
usually a sign of ill health; they can even be remedied with some special 
products. However, a thick, gooey discharge and redness or irritation in 
a dog’s eyes may be a sign of an eye infection that requires medication.
 
 Tight eyelids: Eyelids should fit tightly around the eye and not hang 
loose, except in the case of loose-skinned, droopy-faced dogs like 
Bloodhounds and Bassett Hounds. Some dogs have entropion, a genetic 
condition in which the eyelid curls inward, irritating the cornea. A simi-
lar condition, called ectropion, causes the lower eyelid to curl outward, 
hanging and enabling debris to become trapped under the lid. These 
conditions are fixed with surgery, but they need to be addressed.
 
 Discharge-free noses: The dog’s nose should be free of any discharge, 
and the dog should not be wheezing or coughing. These symptoms can 
signal a respiratory infection or other problems. A cold, wet nose isn’t 
necessarily a barometer of good health — and a cold, wet, oozing nose 
is certainly not a sign of good health.
 
 Polished ivories: Take a look at those teeth. They should be white, 
clean, and mostly free of tartar buildup. If they aren’t, you need to do 
something about it. Clean teeth are important because dental bacteria 
can travel through the bloodstream, infecting the dog’s heart, causing 
heart disease, and decreasing life span. A vet can professionally clean 
teeth with a lot of tartar while the dog is under anesthesia. Generally, 
this procedure is safe, but anesthesia can be risky for some breeds and 
for older dogs (not as risky as letting periodontal disease progress). 
Dental cleaning also can get pricey.
 
 Clean, infection-free ears: Ear infections, usually caused by yeast or 
bacteria, are common in dogs, especially ones who have been wander-
ing outside for extended periods and dogs with floppy ears. Even dogs 

47
 Chapter 3: Considering All the Options
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
with short, pricked ears can get ear infections because the ears are wide 
open to the introduction of bacteria. Another common ear problem is 
ear mites. Signs that a dog has an ear infection or mites include scratch-
ing, head shaking, and pawing at the ears. Ear infections must be treated 
by a vet but usually are easy to resolve.
Skin-tastic coats
A dog’s coat — whether short, tight, smooth, long, flowing, glamorous, bris-
tly, crispy, or wiry — is her crowning glory. The condition of her coat can 
also be an important indicator of her overall health. Many health problems 
manifest in the skin and coat.
Parasites like fleas, ticks, and mange mites can result in rashes, allergic reac-
tions, and massive hair loss and sores, including red, inflamed, painful areas 
called hot spots. Parasites also can transmit serious and even fatal diseases. 
Skin infections — common in animals that are injured while wandering — can 
be caused by staph or other bacteria, or a wound that becomes infected. 
Likewise, immune system problems can cause dull coats, hair loss, and skin 
problems.
Any of the following skin-and-coat conditions can indicate a health problem 
that needs to be addressed:
 
 Patches of missing hair: Even small patches of missing hair can signal 
a skin infection that requires treatment. Large patches can indicate 
mange, caused by tiny skin mites.
 
 Signs of fleas: You may see tiny black specks — flea dirt — or the little 
brown hopping bugs themselves.
 
 Ticks: Ticks can be as tiny as pinheads or, when attached to the skin, 
can be swollen with blood to the size of acorns.
 
 Signs of mites: Mites are tiny black bugs — smaller than fleas — that 
you may not be able to see. Signs of mites include itching, ear irritation, 
red scaly patches, rashes, and hair loss. Demodex and Sarcoptic mites 
are microscopic. Cheylatella mites look like tiny white dander. You can 
see ear mites if you look closely down in the ear canal.
 
 Hot spots — red, itchy, inflamed, weeping wounds caused by exces-
sive scratching: The most common cause of hot spots is allergic reac-
tion to fleabites, food, or other environmental irritants, or an irritated 
or infected injury. Although they’re usually not serious, hot spots are 
uncomfortable for the dog and can be difficult to resolve because the 
dog will keep scratching and licking the wound.
 
 Dull, thin coat: A dull coat can signal diseased skin. Keep in mind, how-
ever, that this symptom also can be a sign of something as normal as 

48
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
a seasonal coat change or post-delivery hair loss (in some breeds, the 
female loses much of her coat after having a litter of puppies). If coat 
changes signal a serious disease, such as hypothyroidism, a veterinarian 
must treat it.
 
 Lumps or bumps in or underneath the skin: These afflictions may be 
cysts or tumors, either simple to remove or cancerous.
The rear view
Just what is under that tail? Take a look. A dog’s rear end should be clean 
and free of discharge, with no signs of irritation or infection. Dogs with 
worms sometimes have infected rears, and in some cases, tiny worms are vis-
ible around the anus. If you get a chance, take a peek at the dog’s stool (just 
don’t do it right before lunch); some worms are visible in the stool. The stool 
also should be firm. Loose, very dark, or bloody stool can signify a problem 
with worms or other intestinal conditions.
Puppies commonly are infected by parasitic worms in utero and, if not 
treated, can carry these worms into adulthood. Medication can resolve 
problems with worms. Likewise, newly admitted dogs commonly get tempo-
rary diarrhea, sometimes with mucus or blood in it, caused by the stress of 
caging, new noises, loss of family, and dietary changes. This condition usu-
ally resolves itself in the first week.
 
If you see abnormal stool in the cage, tell the staff and ask how long the dog 
has been in the shelter. If he’s been there longer than a week, ask if a parasite 
check with a microscope has been done and if the dog has been dewormed.
The great big world: How the dog interacts
A dog’s temperament is crucial in determining health. Dogs who are shy, 
hesitant, guarded, cowering, or growling and aggressive may actually be in 
pain or discomfort because of an undetected health problem. Temperament 
also is an indicator of personality (see the earlier section on temperament), 
but don’t overlook the possibility that poor health is causing any behavior 
problem you see.
Although any of the following signs can simply be related to the stress of the 
environment or the dog’s situation, these factors can look like temperament 
problems but actually indicate a health problem:
 
 Cowering or exhibiting extreme shyness, hesitation, or a reluctance to 
be touched
 
 Backing away, hiding, or avoiding people and other dogs

49

 Whining, whimpering, crying, or appearing agitated
 
 Scratching constantly
 
 Circling, pacing, panting, or displaying other nervous behavior
 
 Drooling excessively, especially accompanied by panting
 
 Growling, nipping, or showing other signs of aggression (No dog behav-
ing aggressively should be offered for adoption, so alert shelter workers 
if you notice signs of aggression.)
Picking Your Perfect Puppy
You can’t wait to get through all the paperwork. You don’t want to read the 
information you’ve been given. You just want your puppy — now. Well, you’ll 
soon have all the time in the world to make a fuss. Keep your enthusiasm in 
check just a little longer.
 
Before you bring home the puppy who’ll share your life, take a second to con-
firm that you’ve covered your bases. Be sure you’re dealing with a reputable 
source — a good shelter or a reputable breeder. You don’t want to fall in love 
with a puppy who has health and temperament problems. Before making 
your final choice, review these good-puppy criteria:
 
 Be sure you’re getting your puppy at the right age — between her 
7-week and 8-week birthdays. Some breeders, especially ones with toy 
breeds, insist on holding their puppies longer because they’re small and 
delicate. That’s fine, but only if the breeder has continued to socialize 
the puppy with people. You want a puppy who can get along with other 
dogs, but you don’t want one who’s too dog oriented to bond well with 
you. Age is not as big a concern with a shelter puppy, who has probably 
been well handled by staff and volunteers.
 
 Look for a puppy who has been raised as a pet — in the kitchen, ide-
ally. You want a puppy who has heard the normal sounds of living with 
people from the day she was born — talking, laughter, arguments, the 
TV, music, and the sound of the dishwasher. Health screenings and good 
breeding are very important, but so is socialization. Don’t buy a puppy 
from someone who has raised her in a kennel, barn, or basement. If you 
don’t know how the puppy has been raised, check out her temperament 
(see the upcoming “Puppy testing” section).
 
 Check for signs of good health. Your puppy should see a vet within 24 
hours — make a health check a condition of adoption — but you prob-
ably can spot obvious signs of disease on your own. Your puppy should 
be plump and glossy, with eyes, nose, and ears free of any discharge. 
She should seem upbeat and happy, not listless.

Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Is a Christmas puppy a good idea?
 
No. Sure, the image of a beribboned puppy and delighted children on 
Christmas morning is both endearing and enduring. But humane societies, 
trainers, veterinarians, and reputable breeders say that Christmas morning is 
just about the worst time to introduce a puppy to the family. To parents with 
camera at hand, the scene seems worth the trouble of an energetic ball of fluff 
rolling around on one of the year’s most hectic days, but it probably isn’t.
Getting a Christmas puppy is okay — if you get one before or after Christmas. 
Introducing a puppy on Christmas Day is stressful for all concerned: The 
puppy needs your attention — but so does everything else.
Even if you get your pup before or after the actual holiday, you have some 
challenges. The first may be finding the right puppy. Many shelters and 
reputable breeders don’t place puppies right before Christmas because they 
believe that the time is just too high risk. That leaves you with less-than-ideal 
sources for your pet.
And consider the problem of socializing and training a puppy in the dead of 
winter, if snow visits your corner of the universe in December. By the time 
the snow starts to melt, you could have a half-grown canine terror on your 
hands.
Giving up that Norman Rockwell moment when your children discover that St. 
Nick has answered their pleas for a puppy is difficult. But if you want a better 
chance of still having that pet as a well-loved member of the family at future 
Christmases, consider this option: Wrap a collar and leash and a dog book for 
the children and put that under the tree — promise your children that their 
puppy had to wait to be born but will be with them as soon as she can.
If you still want to get the puppy around a holiday, Easter is better for start-
ing out a puppy. Your camera works just as well then, your children will be 
just as happy, and your puppy will have a better chance of getting the atten-
tion she needs.
If you have questions, ask the seller, and make sure that you’re satisfied with 
the answers. Above all, don’t let your enthusiasm override your common 
sense. It’s hard to say no to a puppy, but sometimes you must.
Sometimes a single pup is born to a mother who died in childbirth. Should 
you avoid such a puppy? That depends on the breeder. A knowledgeable 
breeder does his best to make up for shortcomings, taking over the role of 
the mother and, later, giving the puppy exposure to other dogs. Single pup-
pies are often sent to be “adopted” by dogs with puppies close to the same 
age or are at least given the opportunity to socialize with other puppies after 
weaning.

51
 Chapter 3: Considering All the Options
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
If this socialization has been done, you need not have any qualms about 
adopting such a puppy, but continue to look for as many opportunities as 
you can to expose your puppy to other dogs as she grows up.
Working with a breeder
If you’ve found a reputable breeder, you may not have much to do when it 
comes to choosing your puppy. You’ve let the breeder know if you prefer 
a male or a female and whether you want that puppy to be more than your 
pet — you’re considering showing him, for example, or entering some other 
canine competition (more on that in Book IV, Chapter 6). Or maybe the litter 
has puppies of different colors and you have a strong preference. All these 
factors can narrow your choices dramatically (even when considering a large 
litter).
The breeder has been narrowing the choices, too. She’s talked with you 
enough to get a feel for the kind of home you offer, whether you’d be too 
demanding for a shy puppy or too easy on a bossy one. In the end, you may 
have a choice between two or three puppies — or maybe just one fills the 
bill.
This process is about give and take, of course, and you may decide to 
broaden your selection criteria a little when faced with a squirmy litter of fat, 
healthy puppies. Suddenly, a black Lab may seem perfect when before only 
a yellow one would do. The breeder, too, should be open to discussion. Just 
remember that she has a better idea of the personalities of her puppies — 
she knows her dogs, after all, and has been living with these pups for weeks. 
If she suggests that the bold puppy who’s crawling all over your son may 
not be the best bet for your family, believe her — she probably learned her 
lesson from an unhappy family in the past.
Although it’s a pretty good bet that you’ll have plenty of puppies to choose 
from in a litter of Great Danes, that may not be the case if you’re dealing with 
a toy breed, in which small litters are the norm. You may want to hedge your 
bets a little by dealing with more than one breeder. The breeder may already 
have that in mind: Good breeders are active locally and likely will know who 
else has a litter that may suit you if theirs does not. Just ask.
Puppy testing
What if you aren’t dealing with a breeder, you’re not selective about gender, 
and you couldn’t care less about your puppy’s color or markings? What if 
you’re offered the pick of any pup you want, not just from one litter, but from 
a whole shelter? How can you decide?

52
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
You test the personalities of your prospective pet. Remember that even 
though you can find a good puppy anywhere, making the most of any help 
offered is a good idea. Good breeders and good shelters test their puppies, 
and many shelters offer adoption counseling. (If you’re dealing with one that 
doesn’t, what else isn’t top rate?)
 
Puppy-testing methods vary widely, but the general purpose of testing is the 
same. The goal is to determine the following:
 
 A puppy’s level of dominance: How bossy or shy is she? Although a 
lot of people are inclined to pick the boldest pup of a litter — because 
she seems to pick them — she’s probably not the best choice for most 
homes. She may be just the ticket for someone with a great deal of 
dog-training experience who intends to compete with the dog, but for 
an average home, a less dominant dog is a better choice. Avoiding the 
shyest, least dominant puppy (“because she needs us!”) is best, too.
 
 A puppy’s level of interest in people: Some puppies are more dog 
oriented or don’t care much about anything at all. A puppy who’s not 
curious and interested in people, perhaps because of little or no social-
ization, isn’t a good prospect as a pet. You want a pup who wants to be 
with you.
 
 A puppy’s trainability: The goal here is a puppy with the ability to 
concentrate — as much as any baby can — and absorb information. 
Avoid a puppy who is so busy bouncing off the walls that she can’t give 
you even a moment’s attention.
 
Take each of the puppies you’re thinking about to a safe, secure area away 
from littermates. Observe how the puppy reacts to the change — tentative 
exploration is okay, but beware the puppy who’s so terrified that she won’t 
move. Also look for how busy a puppy is: Playfulness is fine, but full-out go-
go-go may be a little too much.
Ideally, you can compare your observations with the observations of others 
who have looked at these puppies, such as the volunteers and staff at the 
shelters or the breeder.
Try to see the litter you’re considering more than once. If all the puppies 
seem lethargic, ask the breeder if you’ve caught them just after eating. 
Puppies have two speeds, after all: completely on and completely off!
Keep in mind that the puppy who’s probably best for you — after you find 
the right breed or breed type, locate the right source, and decide between 
male and female — is “medium” in personality. She may not be the smartest 
in the litter, but she may be more interested in your point of view than the 
one who is the smartest. She’s got moxie, but not so much that she’ll drive 

53

Dog
you crazy. She’s willing to try new things — she’s no shrinking violet — but 
she’ll like the new things better if you’re with her
Although a particular breeder may always test his puppies at a particular 
age — 6 weeks, say — you may not have this luxury. Anything in the range 
of 5 to 12 weeks is okay, but if you’re testing puppies in their 8th week, they 
may be a little skittish because at this age they’re a little leery of new things. 
Testing before or after this stage is a better idea.
You can size up a puppy’s personality in several ways, but these exercises 
are easy for anyone to do:
 
 Is she interested in people? Put the puppy down facing you. Walk a few 
steps away, bend over, and call to her. (Bending over makes you less 
intimidating.) If the puppy seems a little tentative, crouch and open your 
arms. You’re not ordering the pup — she doesn’t know what you want, 
after all. You’re trying to see how attracted she is to a nice person. So be 
nice. Call gently, click your tongue, rattle your keys. The medium puppy 
you want will probably trot over happily, perhaps after a slight hesita-
tion. The bossy puppy may come over and nip at you, and the shy one 
may not move except to shiver in terror. The one who doesn’t care a bit 
about people may go investigate a bug in the corner of the room.
 
 Does she accept authority? Gently roll the puppy onto her back and 
hold her there with your hand. The medium pup you’re looking for will 
fuss a little, settle down, and maybe even lick your hand. Bossy pups 
usually keep struggling, and the shyest ones generally freeze in terror.
 
 How does she respond to praise and petting? Praise and petting are 
integral parts of training and communicating with your dog, so finding 
a puppy who wants affection enough to earn it is important. Talk to the 
puppy lovingly and stroke her, but let her decide whether she stays with 
you — don’t hold her. The medium puppy will probably lick your hands 
and be glad to stay with you. Rolling over is okay, and don’t be surprised 
if she urinates a little — called submissive urination, this gesture is kind 
of a canine compliment, a recognition that you’re top dog. A puppy who 
bites hard is probably dominant and unsocialized, and the one who 
wants nothing to do with you probably isn’t people oriented enough. 
Also stay away from the pup who’s terrified of being touched.
Listen to your head, not your heart. Doing so is really, really hard when 
you’re in a shelter and thinking the puppy you don’t pick isn’t going to get 
picked at all. Don’t play the guilt game. Pick a puppy with a temperament that 
likely will produce a good pet. You’re still saving a life in the case of a shelter 
puppy, still providing a good home in the case of any puppy. Keep that in 
mind and pick the best puppy you can.

54
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
You may be tempted to take two puppies home, with the grand idea that 
adopting littermates will keep them from being too lonely while you’re at 
work and will give them something to do besides pester you. Give this idea 
a lot of thought. Raising two puppies together means twice the work, twice 
the craziness, and twice the mess. Most people barely have time to prop-
erly socialize and train one puppy, much less two. Plus, two puppies raised 
together may remain more bonded to each other than they are to you.
If you want two dogs, consider waiting until your puppy is grown to add 
another puppy. Adding a grown dog at the same time you add a puppy may 
be okay, but still, puppies are such work that you’re better off getting your 
little one squared away before you add to your pack.
One of the best ways to start this special relationship properly is to take time 
off work when your first get your puppy. Call it mutternity leave, if you like. 
A week — two is even better — gives you time to get housetraining off to a 
great start and enjoy your puppy while easing the transition between life 
with her littermates and life with you. For more on early puppy training, 
see Book IV.
Bringing Home a Puppy
 
The day your puppy comes home is a big step for both of you. He’s leaving 
his littermates and throwing his lot in with yours. You’re taking on the huge 
responsibility of raising a dog. You want the transition to be as smooth as 
possible, yet you want to make sure that from that very first day, you’re 
laying the groundwork for a wonderful life together. Repeat the following:
I will never let my puppy do anything I wouldn’t let him do as a grown dog.
You’re ready to be a full-fledged puppy parent now, heaven help you. When 
you go to pick up your puppy, bring towels, both old bathroom ones and the 
paper kind. Chances are, your puppy will get carsick. (He won’t necessarily 
be carsick his whole life, though.) Don’t go alone, either. If you’re a single 
person, have a friend drive so you can hold your puppy. Have a spouse or 
kids? Take ’em. This moment is one you’ll want to remember.
But don’t let your children fight over the puppy. He’s not a football. One 
person can hold him, on a towel, for the ride. (Maybe draw lots and make it 
up to the other kids later.) Remember that you want to lay the groundwork 
for your puppy from the beginning. Do so with your children, too, by insist-
ing on gentle, respectful handling. If the puppy throws up or makes any other 
kind of mess, don’t make a fuss. Change to a clean towel, and clean it all up 

55

when you get home. When you get home, take your puppy outside and praise 
him for relieving himself, if he does.
The name game
Naming a dog has to be one of the most delightful parts of getting one. It 
seems not a year goes by without a new book of dog names being published, 
including ones that specialize, such as a book on Irish names.
Avoid names that sound like common obedience commands, like Sitka or 
Stacy. Keep names short — one or two syllables — and easy to pronounce. 
Using names that are not traditionally for people reinforces the fact that a 
dog is a dog, after all. Name books are a good start, but don’t forget atlases 
or special dictionaries such as foreign dictionaries or books of baseball, rail-
road, gardening, or music terms.
Make your puppy love her name as much as you do by making sure that it 
has a positive association. Never scream your puppy’s name at her or use it 
in punishment. The late dog trainer Job Michael Evans used to recommend 
making up a song with your dog’s name in it and singing the song to her. 
Commercial jingles are wonderful for this, he said, because they’re catchy 
and you can put the pet’s name in where the product is mentioned. Yes, it’s 
silly. But try it anyway.
The name your dog hears — her everyday name — is what fanciers term a 
call name: That is, it’s what you call your dog. If you have a purebred dog, 
she’ll have a registered name, too. You get 28 letters and spaces with the 
American Kennel Club to come up with a registered name for your pet. If you 
choose a name someone else has already chosen, the AKC issues it along 
with a number to distinguish your dog’s name from the others, so unless you 
want your Collie to be the AKC’s Lassie 897,042, use all those spaces to come 
up with a middle name or two, something sure to be unique.
Puppy’s first night
Your puppy will probably be so overwhelmed by the new sights, sounds, 
smells, and attention that he won’t much miss his littermates and his old 
home. Everyone will want to hold the puppy and play with him; that’s fine, 
but remember that he’s still a baby and gets worn out quickly. He needs to 
sleep, but he may not eat on that first day. He has a lot to get used to — don’t 
worry about it much. Let him explore.

56
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Puppies aren’t stuffed toys, and you must help your children realize that. 
Small children — especially kids under 5— can’t really help being a little 
rough with puppies (and dogs) and must be carefully supervised to ensure 
that neither hurts the other.
Where should your puppy sleep? Dogs can sleep in the bedroom — not on 
your bed, but in their own bed or in a crate. Allowing the dog to sleep in the 
bedroom is especially important in households where a dog is left alone 
for hours at a time when the family is at work and at school. Letting your 
dog sleep in your bedroom — or in your child’s bedroom — counts for time 
together, even though you’re all asleep. It can go a long way toward build-
ing and maintaining a strong bond, assuring your pet that he’s an important 
member of the pack.
If you want your dog to sleep in the service porch, that’s your business. But 
please don’t start on the first couple nights after you bring your puppy home. 
He needs you now. Those first couple nights are tough on a puppy. The reas-
suring warmth of his littermates is gone, and everything has changed. He’s 
going to have a lot to say about this situation, so be prepared. He will fuss 
less if he’s in your presence, if he can be reassured by your smell and the 
sound of your breathing.
Set up the crate next to your bed and prepare it with a soft blanket to sleep 
on and a chew toy or two. Tell him “Crate” firmly, put him inside, and close 
the door. Then open a book, because you won’t be sleeping for awhile. (For 
more on the use of crates in puppy raising, see Book IV.)
Endure the cries and whines as best you can, but don’t punish your puppy, 
and don’t take him out when he’s carrying on — you’ll teach him that all 
he needs to do is fuss to get what he wants. He’ll probably settle down and 
then wake once or twice in the middle of the night. Take him out to relieve 
himself — and praise him for doing so — and then put him back in his crate.
In a day or two, the worst of the heartbreaking crying will be over.

Looking for Love in All 
the Right Places
In This Chapter
 Exploring possible places to find your new dog
 Buying long distance
 Rescuing a secondhand dog
 Getting an older dog from a breeder
 Understanding the importance of a puppy’s early environment
 Timing your purchase of a new puppy
 Taking in a stray
You can find love in three places: right in front of your eyes, farther afield 
but within driving distance, or on the other side of the world. The natu-
ral starting point is to look within your reach, but that isn’t always the best 
place, nor is it always successful. With some research, perseverance, and 
patience, you’re sure to find the perfect dog.
Don’t close your mind to long-distance buying, because it can be worth the 
effort. When you’re adding another member to your family, you need to pick 
carefully. Don’t let a little inconvenience keep you from getting the right dog. 
After all, you’ll be spending a lot of time, energy, and money on her in the 
years to come. This chapter introduces you to several means of and places 
for finding your new dog, as well as other issues to consider as you’re looking 
for the perfect dog.

Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Searching at Shows
If you decide that you want a purebred registered dog, attending a dog show 
is a good idea. Watch the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club show, which 
is telecast annually in February, to see an overview of all AKC breeds. One (or 
more) is sure to appeal to you. Shows offer classes for all recognized breeds, 
plus breeds that are working toward recognition. Magazines and local clubs 
furnish information on dates and sites of shows.
Plan to spend a full day to observe several breeds. Catalogs are available, 
providing owner information and schedules for each breed. Watch the breeds 
you’re considering both in and out of the rings, and study behavior and per-
sonality. Talk to fanciers and mention your interest in the breed.
Talking with exhibitors
 
When exhibitors are finished showing and able to relax, they’re pleased to 
talk about their dogs and willing to answer your questions. Asking just before 
they walk into the ring, while they’re nervously concentrating on their three 
minutes in the limelight (especially if you muss up the strategically placed 
hairs of their dog), is liable to invite a snap — from the handler!
 
When you have a chance to talk to exhibitors, remember that most of 
them are breeders. Be prepared for a rosy picture — they’re enchanted with 
their chosen breeds. But they are truly a wealth of information. If you really 
want to know whether a particular breed sheds or can run a marathon with 
you, ask.
Benefiting from their experience
Show breeders usually have dedicated themselves to one or two breeds. 
Their knowledge is helpful, so you can gain from their experiences instead of 
having to get answers by guess and by golly. Check out the AKC’s Web site at 
www.akc.org to find breeders in your area (plus a whole lot of other useful 
information). Let your fingers do the searching!
Although show breeders enjoy showing their dogs, most of their puppies are 
sold as companions, for a couple reasons. First, more people are seeking pets 
than show dogs. Second, even the best-bred litter usually has a few puppies that 
will do better as pets than as show-ring stars. But most of all, breeders want 
loving homes for all their puppies, whether they’re pets or show prospects.

Checking Out the Club Scene
Many of the people who belong to dog clubs are breeders. National (often 
called parent clubs), regional, and local kennel clubs offer additional search 
avenues in your quest for a new dog. Some clubs are limited to a single breed 
and are known as specialty clubs. Others are all-breed clubs (also local). 
Similar group clubs serve breeds within groups, such as all terriers or all 
sighthounds. And to add further confusion, all-breed clubs rarely have all 
possible breeds represented within their respective memberships; they just 
play host to shows that are open to all breeds, unlike specialty clubs, which 
sponsor shows for only one breed.
 
If you want to see a lot of one breed, attend a specialty show. If you want to 
see a few dogs of several breeds, go to an all-breed show.
Regardless of appellation or location, almost anyone active in a dog club can 
refer you to breeders — if they don’t happen to breed the kind of dog you 
want, they’ll likely be able to refer you to someone who does. Networking 
counts here!
And don’t forget obedience clubs and other performance event organiza-
tions. People who love dogs know scads of other people who love and breed 
dogs — dogs of a feather pack together.
 
Clubs may be listed in the phone book, but many have only small treasuries 
and, therefore, don’t have phones. Extend your search through a veterinarian 
or the Better Business Bureau, or ask someone you know who has attended a 
training class.
Researching Off- and Online
Most people think of starting their search with the local newspaper. You can 
easily find popular breeds in the classifieds. As in any other source, adver-
tisers can be either reputable, knowledgeable breeders or riffraff. Breeders 
also advertise in dog magazines. You can probably find several on your local 
newsstand: AKC Gazette, Dog Fancy, Dog World, Dogs USA, and Puppies USA. 
You can search the Internet for other titles. Few, if any, newspapers or maga-
zines require credentials, so it’s up to you, the buyer, to determine where to 
buy your dog.
When you’ve settled on one or two breeds, read everything you can find on 
them (especially books on individual breeds) to gather various viewpoints. 
Concentrating on chapters that cover character can help you see whether a 

60
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
given breed is really the dog for you. Seek out live examples of the breed so 
that you can view and interact with them in the flesh.
If you’re even semi-computer-savvy, a world of information is right at your 
fingertips. If you’re not a whiz, a friend or a librarian may take pity and help 
you do a search and print a few pages. You can find information on almost 
every breed in cyberspace. Many breeds have their own Web sites, as do 
individual breeders. National and local clubs are listed as well and often fea-
ture breeder lists. To expand your classifieds search regionally or nationally, 
don’t forget Craig’s List (www.craigslist.org).
Nobody can guarantee that the people listed on Web sites are the kind you 
want to have as birth parents of your soon-to-be-adopted pup. Only you can 
do that by asking discerning questions. The section on questions to ask a 
breeder (later in this chapter) can help you get the information you need.
Bonding with a Breeder
No matter how you locate a breeder — at a show, through a club, or over 
the Internet — buying a puppy from a conscientious breeder is the best way 
to ensure that you will get the right support and that your new addition will 
be healthy and happy. So how on earth do you tell the difference between 
a good breeder and a bad one? Visit and observe. Look for subtle as well as 
obvious signs of love and dedication. If the place smells so bad that it brings 
tears to your eyes, leave. Go with your gut feeling. Ask yourself whether 
you’d trust this person enough to buy a used car from him. If you wouldn’t 
buy an inanimate object, how can you take a chance on a living creature?
Recognizing a good breeder
When the breeder meets you at the door wearing a sweatshirt that reads 
“Havanese Heaven” and dog-tag earrings, you know she’s cuckoo about her 
breed. The 3-foot stack of dog magazines, the shelves of books and bric-a-
brac, and the dog bowls nested beside the kitchen sink are other obvious 
signs. You want a breeder to be crazy about her dogs — it’s a good indication 
that she’d do anything and everything to ensure their well-being.
You can discern more subtle signs of devotion when the breeder speaks with 
enthusiasm about her breed. Still, she should demonstrate that she under-
stands your need to be realistic about any drawbacks of the breed — size, 
grooming, shedding, or attraction to mud puddles. Their idiosyncrasies may 

61
 Chapter 4: Looking for Love in All the Right Places
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
endear dogs of her breed to her; in fact, she may even laugh about the day 
the puppy puked in the preacher’s Panama hat.
But a good breeder is a valuable source of information. She knows the his-
tory of the breed and what physical problems occasionally occur. She’s likely 
to introduce you to the adults in her household first so that you know what 
you’re in for. Puppies are always adorable. A good breeder will
 
 Encourage you to train your pup.
 
 Suggest that you join a local dog club.
 
 Ask you to keep in touch.
 
 Offer instructions on feeding, vet care, and grooming.
 
 Give you spay/neuter requirements for a pet, or show and health docu-
mentation if you plan to breed your dog.
 
 Request that you notify her if you ever need to place your dog.
Notice whether the dogs look at the breeder adoringly and whether she 
strokes them almost subconsciously when talking to you. A physically sound 
dog’s eyes shine, the weight is good, and the coat appears to be healthy 
(albeit a mite ragged, in the case of the mother). By evaluating the dogs, you 
can tell what kind of care they’ve received.
Breeders want their puppies to be happy, and the best way to ensure that is 
for new owners to be happy, too.
Knowing what questions to ask a breeder
Don’t stop with just “How much?” Although we all have to consider expense, 
money should not be the most important consideration when choosing a dog. 
The dog’s health and the breeder’s support and ethics should be high on 
your list of priorities. Ask these questions:
 
 How long have you been involved with the breed?
 
 Why do you love this breed?
 
 Why do you breed dogs?
 
 How often do you breed? When do you expect your next litter?
 
 May I see the dam (mom) and photos of the sire (dad) and other 
relatives?
 
 Can I see where you raise the pups?

62
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
 
 What defects occur in this breed? Have you produced any of these? (If 
so, how many? A low percentage is good. Any breeder of more than two 
litters is bound to have had some problems.)
 
 Are the parents certified to be healthy? (Ask to see certifications.)
 
 Do you belong to any clubs? (Clubs often have codes of ethics.)
 
 Can I see the pedigree? (Look for titles within the first two generations — 
a sign of soundness and dedication.)
 
 Do you pick the puppy or do I? (He’ll want to match personalities.)
 
 What is the medical history of the pups? (Usually the pups will have had 
one or two inoculations, a fecal examination, and possible deworming.)
 
 What does the guarantee cover? (Ask to see the contract.)
 
 What is the average life span of the breed?
Families with children want to ask whether the pups have been kid-proofed. 
Even childless people usually have friends or family whose youngsters visit. 
And families with one or two well-behaved children often have a half-dozen 
others running in and out the door, sometimes not as quiet and mannerly. 
Pups need be exposed to household noises, screeching kids, and wrestling 
mania if those sounds are to be part of their future life.
Answering the breeder’s questions
A bad breeder doesn’t care what you’re going to do with the dog, as long as 
your check clears. A good breeder genuinely loves her pups and wants to 
make sure that they all have a good lifelong home. Expect good breeders to 
ask you the following questions:
 
 What is your attraction to this breed?
 
 Have you thought about the pros and cons of owning a dog?
 
 Do you have children — if so, what ages?
 
 Have you owned dogs before? How did they die?
 
 Will this dog live inside? (Few breeders want to sell to someone who 
plans to tie a dog outside 24/7.)
 
 How do you plan to confine your dog? (The breeder will want you to 
have a fence or to walk the dog on leash.)
 
 Do you realize the expense of raising a dog?

63
 Chapter 4: Looking for Love in All the Right Places
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
 
 Do you understand that pet ownership is a commitment of many years?
 
 Will you contact me if anything ever occurs that means you must place 
the dog?
Now, are you ready to buy the pup? Is this place the right one? Think, 
because this will be your final answer.
Ironically, popularity often sounds a breed’s death knell. Opportunists 
looking for a quick buck leap into dog breeding to satisfy the desires of pet 
buyers. Without knowledge of genetics and good breeding practices, the 
mass-produced misfits are plagued with health and temperament problems. 
These junkyard dawgs are lost causes when the wind changes direction. To 
avoid buying trouble, be sure to deal with a reputable breeder.
Recognizing that breeding makes no cents
When you get a dog from a reputable breeder, you can be confident that 
the dog’s best interest has always been at heart. Most breeders breed dogs 
because they love them, not because they’re trying to make a quick buck. An 
average litter of medium-sized dogs produces about five or six pups. Many 
breeders plan a litter to keep one pup for themselves and/or provide one 
for a previous buyer. That leaves four or five for sale. Breeder expenses for 
raising a litter in a caring, nourishing, and healthy environment include the 
following:
 
 Genetic testing for the dam
 
 Prebreeding tests for the dam
 
 Travel expenses or shipping to the sire
 
 Stud fees
 
 Puppy food and extra food for the dam
 
 Advertising
 
 Registrations
 
 Long-distance phone calls to prospective buyers (Many breeders also 
send photos or videos and educational material to prospects.)
 
 Pedigrees
 
 Initial exams and vaccinations for the pups
 
 Puppy-care packages to go home with the adoptive parents
 
 Replacement or refund guarantees

Diggin’ That Doggie in the Window
Many pet stores have stopped selling dogs and cats, preferring to deal with 
inanimate merchandise that doesn’t require the care that live animals do. To 
encourage placements, some of the largest chains conduct “adoption days,” 
when dogs from local shelters are brought into the store. The wannabe pets 
are tidied up and often sport bandanas around their necks to add to their 
appeal. Volunteers may teach the dogs basic manners or maybe a few tricks, 
putting them through their repertoire for visitors.
Identifying a conscientious pet store
A few pet stores, however, continue to sell puppies that are obtained from 
various sources — either a local owner who was unable to place the puppies 
In/line/out: Breeding programs
Geneticists describe inbreeding as being far-
ther reaching than one generation, and out-
crossing as breeding two different breeds (such 
as Schnauzers and Beagles). But because you’ll 
be dealing with breeders instead of scientists, 
we use the more familiar breeders’ terms.
In breeder lingo, inbreeding means mating 
closely related animals — in other words, 
sister to brother, mother to son, father to 
daughter. The term linebreeding is used for 
litters produced with a common ancestor 
(usually within the first three generations). To 
breeders, outcrossing occurs when a pedi-
gree (the family tree) contains no (or distant) 
common ancestors.
Contrary to popular opinion, inbreeding of ani-
mals is no more harmful than any other method 
of breeding them. Yes, any bad traits can be 
doubled, but so can the good ones. The keys to 
success are mating two animals without serious 
faults and choosing dogs who compensate for 
each other’s less-than-perfect characteristics.
Many breeders employ linebreeding as their 
method of choice, with judicious use of inbreed-
ing and outcrossing when needed. For instance, 
a kennel that has used linebreeding success-
fully for a number of years may find that coat 
texture has become softer than desired and 
pigmentation occasionally fades. The breeder 
looks for an unrelated (preferably linebred) stud 
who is particularly strong in the characteristics 
the breeder’s stock is lacking. The best progeny 
(offspring that exhibit the desired attributes) 
from that litter eventually are bred back into the 
kennel’s line.
As a buyer, your charge is not to worry what 
method was used, but rather to find a litter 
with healthy, sturdy parents and grandparents. 
Those two generations have the greatest influ-
ence on the puppies.

or a broker for a larger commercial enterprise. Although puppies are hard 
to resist and seem to magnetically attract attention, be sure that the store 
where you shop has a caring staff with adequate time to spend holding or 
playing with the puppies. Puppyhood is the crucial age for developing social 
skills.
 
Pet store prices are usually more than a breeder’s price, and the puppies are 
more often sick.
Getting the best from a pet store
If you decide to buy from a pet store, be sure to ask the same questions you 
would if you were buying a pup from a breeder (listed earlier in the chapter). 
Try to think with your mind rather than your heart. Everyone’s first impulse 
is, “Aw, let’s buy him.” You must do a few things before cuddling the pup, 
though (remember, cuddling is a surefire sales gimmick):
 
 Ask to see the puppy’s registration form and health certifications for the 
parents.
 
 Check the guarantee.
 
 Obtain copies of all paperwork stating that the pup is in good health, 
has been checked for parasites, and has received his initial inoculations.
 
 Ask for the breeder’s contact information. Call the breeder to ask perti-
nent questions.
 
Don’t buy a puppy that is younger than 8 weeks of age. For one thing, doing 
so is illegal in most states. For another, puppies need to be with their litter-
mates to develop bite inhibition and social skills. Younger puppies have less 
control of their bowel and bladder functions and are more difficult to house-
train. Ask the pet store how long the puppy has been there. A pup may be 
8 weeks old but was taken away from his mother and littermates two weeks 
before, which is problematic from the standpoint of social skills.
 
If you buy a dog from a pet store, make a veterinary appointment ASAP — 
within 24 hours. Store refund or replacement policies are often in effect only 
within 24 to 48 hours of the purchase. Returning an ill puppy is not always 
easy emotionally, but don’t set yourself up for far greater heartbreak by 
taking a sickly pup under your wing.  

66
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Adopting an Orphan
Some shelters have the same rigorous requirements that breeders do. They 
may not place certain dogs in homes with small children, or they may require 
a fenced yard. They want the animal to have a second chance at a great 
home. Ask if you can bring other family pets to the shelter for a preadoption 
visit to see whether the current and future buddies tolerate each other. A few 
shelters require a 24-hour waiting period to ensure that the adopter is not 
acting on a whim and is sincere about wanting the animal.
Adoptive families need to ask whether any history is known about the dog. 
Some dogs are surrendered by previous owners. Reasons can vary from a 
move or divorce to a behavior that is impossible for one family to tolerate yet 
is considered a bonus to another. If the dog has been in the shelter for more 
than a few days (most strays are kept long enough to be vet-checked and to 
allow the lost owner a chance to be found), managers and employees will 
be able to provide you with helpful information. They’ve probably observed 
whether the dog barks a lot or is friendly, timid, or trained.
Most people want a dog who is friendly and calm, yet playful. Choose one 
who sparkles with good health. Most shelter dogs have something negative 
in their history, even dogs who were surrendered unwillingly because of the 
owner’s poor health or circumstances. A dog who appears unsure of herself 
in a shelter can bloom with confidence after a week or so of doting love and 
kindness. But one who is bouncing off the walls in unfamiliar surroundings 
usually requires someone who is at least as energetic and determined as the 
dog. Either can reward you with great joy if you choose with care.
Watching out for unchecked commercialism
Buyers want a puppy who’s been raised with 
love. People who love their dogs raise them 
with kindness and the best care they can give. 
It’s nearly impossible to give adequate care, let 
alone loving attention, to 50 or more animals. 
Yet one commercial breeder boasts of supply-
ing semis full of puppies to stores — at a rate 
of 900 a week! If an owner with 50 dogs spends 
12 hours a day with his dogs, that still is only 14 
minutes per dog, which isn’t enough.
You want to buy a dog from someone who 
understands the breed and can help you with 
any questions or problems that may arise. 
You want a puppy who’s been raised in clean 
conditions, not in crates or small cages, sleep-
ing among urine and excrement. You want a 
pup who knows that a raised hand means it’s 
going to be kissed and cuddled, not smacked 
or poked.

Shelters have various adoption fees and procedures. Fees are often $50 
to $75, which may include a rebate when the pet is spayed or neutered — 
they don’t want to place one animal only to receive eight in its place. Some 
shelters participate in early spay/neuter programs so that dogs are already 
altered (“fixed”) before they are adopted. Others offer referrals to clinics that 
perform the surgery at a reduced fee. The more responsible shelters follow 
up on adoptions, making sure that the dog is altered and in a good home. 
Shelters occasionally have lists of local clubs or breeders who are willing to 
provide you with tips about your breed.
Buying from Afar
How do you buy a puppy 1,000 miles away? It happens all the time. But if you 
cannot see the pups personally, breeders should be willing to send you pic-
tures of the parents and pups. With today’s technology, they may send pic-
tures and video over the Internet. Trusting that the breeder has good ethics 
is especially important when buying sight unseen.
Getting the ball rolling
Initial contacts come through e-mail or phone calls. Once in a while, the 
courtship is conducted through letters (although, frankly, the response to 
a letter is usually much slower and sometimes nonexistent). Ask whether 
the breeder has a litter or plans one in the near future. You’ll have dozens 
of questions to ask the breeder, and don’t be surprised when you receive 
just as many. (See the sections on questions to ask and answer earlier in this 
chapter.)
When you feel a connection with this person you haven’t met, you’ll probably 
talk many times before Baby comes bouncing into your home. Preliminary 
mailings usually include photos of the sire and dam, their health clearances, 
pictures of past puppies, and information about kennels. You may also get 
info about the breed and guidelines on teaching manners, crate training, 
housetraining, and more.
 
While you’re waiting for a litter, or while you’re still trying to narrow your 
choices, ask the breeder to send photos or videos of the extended family 
and puppies as they grow. It’s sure to either help you make up your mind or 
endure the waiting period, depending on your situation.

68
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Making travel plans
Many buyers are willing to drive any distance within six to eight hours to 
avoid shipping. Beyond 500 miles, unless you’re into long, long drives, your 
puppy likely will be shipped to you. Flying to the breeder and bringing your 
puppy back as under-the-seat baggage is the best way — unless, of course, 
you’re buying a Newfoundland, which would have to travel in the cargo hold. 
Medium-sized or smaller breeds fit well.
 
Otherwise, the next best way to fly your puppy home is to have her marked 
“priority” or “counter-to-counter,” meaning she’ll be the last loaded into 
baggage and the first off. Make sure that you book a direct flight, even if you 
have to drive to a larger airport, so that your puppy doesn’t have to change 
planes. Breeders know all the best ways of handling transportation — consult 
them on the details. They want to ensure that their precious bundle of joy 
arrives safely in your hands.
Adopting a Rescue or Ricochet Dog
Maybe canine blue blood or registry doesn’t mean anything to you. If that’s 
the case, many delightful dogs are available through purebred rescue organi-
zations and animal shelters, both staffed with dedicated volunteers who do 
their darnedest to help canine throwaways. Most rescue organizations focus 
on helping a breed of choice.
Animal shelters, on the other hand, draw no such lines. Big/small, young/old, 
pure/mixed — they’re all the same in their eyes: homeless dogs.
Dogs may end up homeless for many reasons:
 
 Dogs are credited with helping their people to be healthier in mind and 
body. Unfortunately, it doesn’t mean a person will live forever, and 
sometimes an owner dies.
 
 Broken homes are a dismal part of today’s statistics, and when they 
occur, the pet can wind up with no home at all.
 
 People may become incapacitated and can no longer take care of a dog.
 
 A dog may accidentally escape and not be reclaimed.
 
 A move can mean that an owner cannot take an animal along.

Dog
Face it, people (especially people who don’t read this book) make mistakes 
and form bad decisions about pet ownership. Lifestyles change, and some-
times owners realize that, as much as they love their dogs, their pets need 
more attention than they can give at particular stages of their respective 
lives. So for all sorts of reasons, dogs can become homeless.
Some buyers think that they want to start with a puppy so they can mold his 
character and train him to be the kind of dog they want to live with — or, 
at least, claim his bad habits as their own creation. However, not everyone 
wants the “blessings” of puppyhood, so they consider a recycled adult.
Elderly dog lovers often think they’re no longer capable of training or keep-
ing up with an energetic young pup. Sometimes they also think restricting 
a young dog to a more sedate, leisurely lifestyle isn’t fair. And occasionally, 
senior citizens fear their dog will wind up an orphan if Father Time sounds 
the quitting whistle for them. Thus, an elderly dog can be just the right soul 
mate for the winter of both their lives.
However, not all homeless dogs are adults — sometimes baskets of found-
lings are left at the doorsteps of shelters — although most surrendered dogs 
are at least several months old. The saddest of all these victims of society are 
the older dogs, with their grayed muzzles and bewildered eyes, not under-
standing why they’ve become canina non grata.
The greatest numbers of homeless dogs are dogs reaching puberty, at 
approximately 1 year of age. At that age, the cuteness of puppyhood is 
starting to wear off and the novelty of dog ownership is becoming a chore. 
Longhaired dogs are at their worst coat stage, with mats forming by the 
101 unwanted Dalmatians
The popularity of the Dalmatian soared to great 
heights following Disney’s feature films and 
then plunged to Titanic depths when buyers 
found that these cute little spotted pups grew 
up and actually behaved like real dogs rather 
than cartoons. Although the Dalmatian Club 
of America strove mightily to warn people 
that no dog is appropriate for everyone, many 
Dalmatian owners decided that their ship was 
coming in and this was the time to set sail into 
Breeders’ Land.
Dalmatian pups sold like popcorn at the movies 
and later were discarded like the empty boxes. 
Greasy cardboard is easily cleaned up . . . 
not so for living creatures. Dalmatian rescue 
agencies found themselves swamped with 
adolescent Spots. You can check out some of 
these Dalmatians at www.thedca.org/

minute. Hormones are surging in those dogs who still are intact, and like 
human teenagers, they sometimes act out their bodily urges and mental 
anguishes. But dogs can find themselves in need of a home at virtually 
any age.
Rescues: Giving a Home to the Hopeless
Sadly, too many dogs find their way to animal shelters and Humane Societies. 
However, networks of dedicated dog lovers (some are breeders) do all they 
can to rescue as many of these hapless pooches as possible and place them 
in new homes.
Most breeders love all dogs, particularly their own chosen breeds. Breeders 
who are active in rescue check out strays or dogs who have been surrendered 
at Humane Societies. Rescuers examine them to determine whether the dog 
can be placed or whether she has unsolvable mental or physical problems. 
Almost all national parent clubs support rescue organizations for their breeds.
Rescue organizations don’t want repeat offenders. They’d just as soon place the 
dogs in the right home to begin with. They’ll ask as many questions as breeders 
and make certain demands on the adopters. In fact, they may even be more par-
ticular because they know the dog already has been subjected to abuse, neglect, 
or abandonment and they want to avoid further trauma for the dog.
Rescue associations will conduct follow-up visits and interviews to make sure 
that the dog (and you) are adjusting to each other. Because they know the 
breed so well, they’ll be available to give advice when you need it.
These organizations stay afloat mainly through donations given by grate-
ful adopting families and from club members devoted to helping their 
breed. Rescuers are not paid for their efforts and, in fact, often donate their 
expenses as well as their time.
Understanding how rescue systems work
A national coordinator solicits help from club members or regional assis-
tants (sometimes even calling upon experts in other breeds) to identify the 
dog as a purebred. Foster homes are found; healthcare is provided. Almost 
without exception, the dogs are spayed or neutered if they are intact. They’re 
debugged and dewormed.
Some individuals — like Beardie lovers — help out Neardies when possible. 
(A Neardie is a dog with a lot of Beardie in him — he’s nearly a Beardie.)

During foster care, the dogs’ hungry tummies are filled with good food, and 
they’re also nourished mentally with the love and attention they hunger for. 
They gain weight and regain health. Matted dogs often must be shaved or 
shorn. It can be humorous to watch a formerly filthy, dejected beastie strut in 
style after a session with a groomer.
 
Want to “try on” a breed? Volunteer to foster a dog until a home can be found 
(or the dog becomes your permanent resident).
Foster families carefully observe their charges for behavioral and tempera-
ment problems. Breed rescues operate on a shoestring and can’t afford to 
be sued for placing a vicious animal. Nor do the volunteers want anyone to 
be injured. But what one family can’t tolerate may be exactly what another 
person is looking for. Matching the dog to the family is of prime concern. 
Dogs who are too rowdy for young children or elderly people often fit the bill 
for a family with teenagers. Timid dogs are happy to curl up in the lap of a 
quiet adult.
When the dogs’ bodies and minds are healed, the adoption process begins. 
Transportation can be provided, through an “aboveground railroad,” shut-
tled by dog lovers across the country, if need be, to a new home.
Recognizing who gets rescued
The lucky breeds have waiting lists for rescues. With more populous breeds, 
however, dog lovers make desperate efforts to save all they can, but know-
ing so many dogs’ lives are lost is disheartening, even though those dogs 
have done nothing wrong except be in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
Dedicated rescuers struggle on, saving one dog at a time, as in the story 
about the little boy who saved one starfish by placing it back in the ocean. He 
knew he couldn’t save them all, but he could save that one.
Rescue organizations can be located through the national clubs of the vari-
ous breeds, which you can find by contacting one of the registering bodies, 
such as the AKC or UKC. Several breed rescues have Web sites that you can 
easily access by using your favorite Internet search engine.
Rehoming Ricochet Dogs
Breeders want one thing above all: a forever, loving home for each of their 
puppies. Sadly, it doesn’t always work out that way. No matter how much 
effort a breeder puts into interviewing buyers and finding the right homes, 
occasionally the unexpected happens.

72
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Ricochet dogs are dogs whom owners return to the breeder for whatever 
reason. Placing these ricochet dogs in new homes is called rehoming. 
Conscientious breeders who love their dogs always welcome their pups 
back — at any age — if they ever need to be placed again. In fact, they usually 
stipulate this requirement in the sales contract.
Breeders hate to make mistakes in matchmaking, and they hate that the dog 
must adjust to returning to his birthplace and again to a new (and, hopefully, 
permanent) home. But taking these dogs back is one of the obligations breed-
ers assume when they bring puppies into the world.
A breeder generally hears the words “I can’t keep him” with a sinking feeling 
in the abdominal pit. Yet no matter how a responsible breeder has to shuffle 
other dogs or her own life, her immediate response is, “Bring him back.” She 
sets another place at the table and throws another burger on the barbie.
Ricochet dogs may be any age. If they’re elderly, they usually join the pack 
in the home where they were born. If they’re sickly, the breeder may have to 
bite the bullet and face the difficult choice of euthanasia.
Most, however, are rehomed through the breeder’s waiting list and rescue 
network — which have been expanded and made even swifter by the 
Internet. Many breeds have electronic lists that their breed lovers can sub-
scribe to, and word passes quickly.
One advantage of obtaining a ricochet dog from a breeder is being able to 
ascertain the health of the parents and having access to health records. The 
breeder’s knowledge of the dog’s ancestors also is helpful.
Owners and breeders need to prepare for the unexpected and plan in 
advance for what-if scenarios. Never collect or produce more dogs than you 
(or a relative or friend) can comfortably house, at least temporarily.
Finding Restful Homes for Retirees
Breeders have busy lives. They also usually have a menagerie of puppies, 
young show prospects, brood matrons, stud dogs, and golden oldies. Sadly, 
Grams and Gramps may receive the least attention, just because their needs 
aren’t as immediate. Old dogs usually fit in well. They’re used to routines and 
often are content with snoozing on the couch.
Because former stars of the show ring and whelping box are less demanding, 
they’re fed, watered, vetted, and petted, but they’re only one of the pack. 
Although heart-wrenching, some owners think their oldies deserve individual 
attention and that placement in a one- or two-pet home is better for the dog, 
so they’re willing to place them in new homes.

Not all retired dogs are old. Many are middle aged but have retired from a 
breeding program. Males can stand at stud for several years, but females 
often are spayed after three or four litters (at about the age of 5 or 6). Thus, 
most retirees are females.
 
Retirees can be great choices for people who are too busy to train puppies 
(or who’ve been there, done that, and don’t want to do it again). Many of 
these animals are former show dogs and thus are well-trained, outstanding 
examples of the breed.
Sorting through Shelter Stats
The world would be a perfect place if everyone, human or canine, had a 
loving home. Sadly, until all breeders carefully plan litters and judiciously 
place puppies, and all buyers choose wisely, shelters will always overflow 
with unwanted dogs. While some of these homeless dogs are purebreds, 
many others are mixed breeds.
Shelter statistics indicate that adopters most often choose small or medium-
sized, fluffy, purebred puppies. So a larger, short-haired, mixed-breed adult 
has the least chance of being adopted. Yet such a dog just may be the perfect 
one for you.
Some dogs are known to be half of one breed and half of another. Others are 
so obviously indiscernible that they’re called Heinz 57 because many variet-
ies of dogs may be adding their genes to the mix. If the ancestry is known, 
some guesstimate may point to the instincts and proclivities of the individ-
ual. Maybe she’ll be a good retriever like her Chessie mom and aristocratic 
like her Pekingese dad. Then again, maybe she’ll just join you in the bathtub 
and under the hair dryer now and then.
Mixed breeds offer many charms
One advocate of mixed breeds says, “I want 
one of these and one of these and one of 
those . . . and I think that’s why I end up with 
mixes. That way you get them all, one way or 
another. I say that’s part of the charm of a mixed 
breed: You don’t know exactly what you’re get-
ting, it’s unique, and you’ll never again have one 
just like that.”
Many buyers have a breed or two or ten in mind. 
But if you simply want a pet who will love you, 
you may find the perfect dog waiting for you at 
a pound, shelter, or Humane Society. As many 
as 25 percent of shelter inmates may be pure-
bred, but the other 75 percent — mixes — need 
homes, too. Just choose carefully. Dog lovers 
want to empty shelters, not fill them.

Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Considering Pup’s Early Environment
 
When you’re trying to decide on a canine companion, consider not only his 
future with you, but also the environment of the dog’s puppyhood. When you 
can, watch how the breeder interacts with the litter. If the pups greet him 
with glee, eagerly welcoming pats and attention, they’ve been handled with 
love and are well socialized. Eyes sparkle with health and fur shines (though 
they may have just somersaulted through a puddle on the way to meet you).
Some owners tuck the whelping box (where pups usually spend their first 
four to five weeks) in a corner of a room. Not everyone, however, has space 
for this arrangement. The nursery may have been in a simple unadorned 
kennel, basement, or garage, but it needs to be clean, comfortable, and vis-
ited by people several times a day.
 
Breeders can’t acclimate pups to every noise, creature, or contraption that 
they’ll meet in life. However, exposing pups to a loud radio, slamming doors, 
and a dropped pot now and then can alleviate future trauma. Baths, collars, 
car rides, and nail clipping need to be part of a pup’s background by the time 
he’s ready to depart the nest.
 
When searching for your pup, ask about health. Individual lines differ, but in 
most cases, health clearances are for the parents rather than the puppies. 
So don’t expect your pup to have certificates of health. A few tests, such as 
heart and juvenile cataract exams, can be conducted in puppyhood. Talk to a 
veterinarian about what to look for in your chosen breed. See the chapters in 
Book II for a lot more on health concerns.
Timing Your Adoption
Good breeders won’t permit a pup to go home with a new owner on a child’s 
birthday or a major holiday, particularly at Christmas — with rare excep-
tions (such as to homes with one or two adults planning a quiet celebration 
in front of the fireplace). Holidays are hectic enough, with parties to attend, 
visitors popping in, shopping to finish, and popcorn to string. Pups are likely 
to be underfoot, putting an extra demand on time. If you want to surprise the 
kids with a pup, plan ahead by asking the breeder for a picture of the pup (or 
the parents). Wrap a bowl, brush, leash and collar, and box of dog biscuits. 
Buy books about the breed, training, and even puppy names.

Unfortunately, breeders can’t arrange litters during the prime times for 
buyers. Pups are born throughout the year (in fact, usually during the 
most inconvenient times). Begin your calls several months before you’re 
ready because finding the perfect pup often takes a few weeks or months. If 
you want a pup in the summer, start calling in the winter. Litters are often 
reserved before they’re born or shortly afterward.
When You’re the Matchmaker: 
Stray Dogs
Occasionally, you don’t choose the dog; the dog chooses you. One morning 
you open the door and there, smiling his way smack into your heart, is your 
new dog. Or you’re driving down the road and run into (but not run over, as 
long as his guardian angels are watching out for him) the saddest story in 
dogdom: a dog who has been abandoned and is hopelessly searching every 
face in every car for his erstwhile loved one.
 
If you give your heart and your home to a stray, whether purebred or mon-
grel, you’re performing a good deed, serving as a lifesaver for the dog, who’d 
otherwise likely end up as a pound stat or roadkill. Adopting a foundling 
also is a good deed for society because your dog won’t be a canine criminal, 
chasing and destroying farm stock. The rescued foundling won’t bite-and-
run, dirty the streets, strew garbage, or haplessly spawn more happenstance 
homeless canines.
Some homeless dogs are on the streets through no fault of their own. Others 
are there because of behavior problems or uncurbed instincts that urge them 
to Run! Chase! Bark! Their previous owners hadn’t bothered to channel those 
instincts or found it difficult to do so. Although most animals (again, like their 
human counterparts) are on good behavior while settling in, once settled, 
Getting a dog from a neighbor or colleague
Neighbors, co-workers, and acquaintances 
whose dogs have puppies can suddenly 
become your best friends. If the litter is 
unplanned (except by the two guilty parties), 
the owners may be desperate to place the little 
critters who eat and eliminate copious amounts 
of food. People who give away pups for little or 
nothing aren’t motivated to invest a lot in their 
care. Anyone can be a breeder — not everyone 
is a good breeder.

Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
they show their true habits. Within a matter of days — or surely weeks — of 
adopting a stray, you may have to decide whether the conduct is something 
you can live with or whether it’s something you’re willing to work with and 
train into acceptable behavior.
If you decide you cannot live with a particular problem, take the dog to a 
shelter. Be truthful about the particular bugaboo. If the person to whom the 
dog is surrendered has an idea of what the annoying behavior is, placing the 
dog in a suitable home or retraining it still may be possible. Don’t replay the 
abandonment story the dog has already suffered once. The final chapter of 
that book always is a sad one.
Although taking in a stray dog is the least expensive way to obtain a pet, it 
bears mentioning that because Fido doesn’t come bearing medical records, 
he’ll need a complete work-up at the vet’s office.
Whether the story has a happy ending for you, however, only time will tell. 
When you’re unsure of the environmental circumstances and genetic influ-
ences molding your dog’s temperament, you’re groping in the dark, unable 
to see what’s ahead. If that’s what your heart tells you to do and you’re pre-
pared to face and conquer problems, bless you. But if you think that taking in 
a stray is an inexpensive way to obtain a pet, it does neither you nor the dog 
any good to rerun this scenario.

ongratulations, you’ve found the dog for you! But wait . . . don’t bring 
him home just yet. You have some preparation work to do.
Fortunately, you can make a big difference in how well your new dog adjusts 
to his new surroundings by making use of a few targeted strategies. On his 
first day home, your new best friend may not believe that he’s finally in his 
forever home — and with his own cozy bed and shiny new food bowl and 
everything. He may be a bit nervous, even scared, when he first comes home

this chapter tells you exactly what to do to ensure that your new four-legged 
friend’s homecoming is a happy one.

Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Preparing Your Pad
If you don’t already have a dog, you need to do some pooch-proofing before 
you bring your new friend home — to keep your new dog and your old 
possessions safe. Pooch-proofing is important for exploring, chewing, 
mischievous puppies and for adult dogs who haven’t quite learned what is 
unacceptable in your home. These precautions are particularly important for 
dogs who never spent much time indoors until now. Although an adult dog 
may not even consider gnawing on the legs of the kitchen chair, eating your 
shoes, or rooting through the garbage, you won’t know for sure until you 
bring her home. Better to pooch-proof, just in case.
You also need some stuff to keep your dog healthy, well exercised, and 
amused. If you’re someone who likes shopping, this part of bringing home 
your new dog is fun.
Puppy-proofing first, even for adult dogs
Before bringing a dog into your home, you need to come to terms with the 
many things that a short four-legged animal can get into. Any dog in a new 
environment is bound to explore, and some dogs explore more — shall we 
say — enthusiastically than others. Puppies, in particular, explore the world 
with their noses and mouths, and that may mean chomping on choking 
hazards, chewing through electrical cords, and munching on your favorite 
possessions. Energetic puppies and older dogs unaccustomed to being inside 
also are at risk of falling, having things fall on them, and getting stuck in the 
strangest places. Some of these situations can be dangerous for the puppy, 
such as getting stuck inside a recliner or underneath a car in the garage.
Your home doesn’t have to be a house of hazards for your new dog. You just 
need to take some precautions first. On the other hand, just because you 
have a new dog doesn’t mean that you have to resort to installing vinyl 
flooring and covering all your furniture with sheets. You do, however, need 
to look around and eliminate potential hazards. Watch for the following when 
pooch-proofing:
 
 Choking hazards: Look at all your floors. Do you find paper clips, bits of 
paper or string, rubber bands, or other objects a young puppy may find 
tempting enough to sample? Pick them up; they’re choking hazards.
 
 Unsteady objects: What if you knocked the base of that side table with 
your wagging rear end? Would that lamp fall on your head? Can big 
puppy paws reach the edge of that coffee table and knock off all those 
breakable knickknacks? Either make those unsteady objects steady 
enough to withstand the onslaught of your new dog or move them.

79
 Chapter 5: Helping Your Adopted Dog Make the Homecoming Transition
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
 
 Strangulation hazards: Does the dangling curtain fringe beckon, begging 
your pup to grab it with his teeth and give it a good shake? Are the 
mini-blind cords hanging within reach of dog necks? Find a way to 
remove these potential strangulation hazards from your dog’s reach by 
taping them down, tying them out of reach, or removing them altogether.
 
 Electrocution hazards: Can you imagine what those sharp little puppy 
teeth can do to an electrical cord? Yep, you’re right. A puppy can bite 
through a cord in seconds, causing severe burns and electrocution. 
Make sure that you tape down cords or put them behind furniture so 
your puppy isn’t tempted by an electrocution hazard.
 
 Tempting trash: Is the garbage can, with its luscious aromas, standing 
open for your dog to topple? The tempting trash from some garbage can 
really harm a who may be used to scrounging for meals. Some particularly 
hazardous examples are tasty but dangerous cooked bones that can 
splinter in your dog’s intestine, rotten food, and choking hazards such 
as milk bottle caps, used dental floss, and metal soft-drink tabs.
 
 Poisons: Did you know that anything that can poison a human toddler 
can also poison a dog? Put safety locks on cabinets that are within the 
reach of your new dog, particularly the ones that contain poisonous 
household chemicals like cleaners, pest poisons, medications, and even 
toiletries like shampoo, lotion, and sunscreen. (For what to do if you 
suspect your dog has been poisoned, see Book II, Chapter 3.)
 
 Your prized possessions: Dogs love and need to chew on things. For 
puppies, chewing feels good during teething, and some mouthy breeds 
like Sporting breeds, Hounds, and Terriers chew throughout their lives. 
However, dogs don’t know that your child’s favorite stuffed bunny 
or expensive piece of sports equipment is any different than a fleece 
stuffed toy or rubber chewie. An adopted dog who never was taught the 
difference between dog toys and human things may have a hard time 
telling the difference, so put your prized possessions away!
 
Most puppy-proofing is a matter of common sense and can be essentially 
summarized in one Golden Rule of puppy proofing: If you don’t want your dog 
to chew it, put it out of reach.
A lot of dog owners discover this lesson the hard way. If you leave things like 
toys, clothes, slippers, new shoes, wallets, or plates of after-school snacks 
out where your dog can get at them, don’t blame your dog for thinking he 
can help himself. Only an impressively self-controlled canine can resist these 
things when nobody is watching. This threat is an excellent motivation for 
children to keep their rooms clean — or at least close their bedroom doors 
so the puppy can’t get in. Otherwise, they risk chewed up and ruined toys 
and laundry. Dogs especially love to chew holes in underwear and socks.

80
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Dog destruction doesn’t just apply to your furniture and wearables. It also 
applies to your food. Dogs of any age are incredibly clever when they smell 
something delicious. Adopted dogs may have spent some serious time 
scrounging for every piece of food they could find and going for long periods 
of time without any food at all before they came to live with you. These dogs 
can become extra clever at scoring tidbits, so you always have to be one 
step ahead of them. Don’t leave your dinner on any counter low enough to be 
within a dog’s lunging reach.
 
Supervision is a key element to puppy-proofing. Although you may not be 
used to keeping an eye out for what your puppy is doing at all times, doing so 
is essential for your dog’s safety, not to mention a crucial part of housetraining.
Gathering essential doggy accoutrements
Dogs get by perfectly well with only a few basics, but you may want to 
consider a few luxury items, too. Note: Chew toys are not luxury items; 
they’re a necessity, especially for puppies.
Avoiding poisons
Many items that are poisonous to humans are 
also poisonous to dogs, but dogs can react — 
sometimes severely — to substances that are 
completely benign for humans, such as choco-
late and onions. The following foods, plants, 
medications, and poisons are particularly dan-
gerous for dogs. Don’t let your dog ingest any 
of the following:
  Chocolate: Dogs can react severely to both 
the caffeine and the theobromine in choco-
late.
  Raisins or grapes: Some dogs suffer acute 
kidney failure and death caused by these 
foods, even in small amounts.
  Onions: Onions can cause severe anemia in 
some dogs.
  Prescription and nonprescription medica-
tions for humans: Many human medications 
are very dangerous for pets. For example, 
acetaminophen, the active ingredient in 
Tylenol, can cause liver failure and the 
destruction of red blood cells (cats are even 
more sensitive to acetaminophen than dogs). 
It’s just a good idea to avoid giving your dog 
any medication intended for humans unless 
your vet has advised you to do so.
  Antifreeze: A few drops of antifreeze can 
kill a dog. Unfortunately, antifreeze tastes 
and smells appealing to dogs, so watch for 
stains in your garage or driveway.
  House and garden flowers, ferns, shrubs, 
and other plants: Check out the ASPCA 
Animal Poison Control Center’s Web site, 
which lists many common plants that 
can be poisonous to pets. Find it at www.
aspca.org/pet-care/poison-
control/plants/.

Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
The basics
Dogs don’t require thousands of accessories, and you certainly don’t need to 
spend a fortune to equip your dog. However, to be able to manage and train 
your dog successfully, you need some basic tools that your friendly local pet 
store should be able to supply.
 
 Identification tags: ID tags are the most important dog accessory you 
can buy. Engraved with your dog’s name and your address and phone 
number, an ID tag can be your dog’s ticket home if she ever gets lost. A 
pet tag is important even if your dog has a microchip implanted from 
the shelter or the vet. Anyone can find your dog when it strays, but that 
doesn’t mean anyone can or will take your dog to a shelter or vet to scan 
for the microchip. An identification tag on the collar makes finding the 
animal’s owner easy. Put it on your dog and never take it off. Check 
periodically that it’s still there — ID tags have a way of getting lost.
 
 Buckle collar and 6-foot leash: Choose nylon or leather with a metal or 
plastic buckle, decorated or simple. For some small breeds or dogs who 
pull a lot, consider a harness in addition to a collar, but make sure that 
you still can include identification tags.
 
 Crate or kennel: Choose a crate or kennel that is big enough for your 
adult dog. A crate is a plastic carrier with a wire front. Crates are 
sometimes called kennels, but kennel also refers to a wire cage. Your 
dog needs to be able to stand up, turn around, and lie down comfortably 
inside. If you have a puppy that will grow quite a bit, buy a crate or 
kennel to fit the dog’s adult size (if you know what it will be) and 
temporarily block off part of the crate to make it smaller. Otherwise, the 
puppy may use one end for a bed and the other end for a bathroom. The 
crate or kennel is absolutely essential for housetraining (see Book IV, 
Chapter 1 for more on housetraining) and general management, because 
it becomes your dog’s beloved den (see the section “Showing your dog 
to her den” later in this chapter), and she will love it even more than 
you do. If you travel a great deal, look for a crate or kennel that can be 
buckled into the backseat of your car or van.
 
 Dog seat belt: No, this device is not a luxury, but rather an important 
safety item. If your dog’s kennel is too large to fit in the backseat or to 
buckle in, look for one of several different high-quality dog seat belts 
that attach to your car seat belt. Dog seat belts keep you and your pet 
safe in the car. When she’s wearing a seat belt, your dog can’t jump on 
you, distract you while you’re driving, or injure anyone else in the car in 
the case of an accident. With this device, you can all buckle up safely.
 
 Food and water bowls: Metal and ceramic are easy to clean and unlikely 
to harbor bacteria, and they’re not tempting to chew.
 
 A high-quality dog food: Check out Book II, Chapter 1 for more 
information about choosing a good food.

82
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
 
 Assorted brushes, depending on your dog’s coat: A natural-bristle 
brush can be used for short- and medium-coated dogs, and wire-pin 
and slicker brushes work for long- or fluffy-coated dogs. Bristle brushes 
are good for regular maintenance brushing, while pin brushes are good 
for double-coated dogs because they brush down to the skin. Slicker 
brushes are great for pulling out excess undercoat during periods of 
heavy shedding.
 
 Shampoo made just for dogs: You’ll also want conditioner for long-
coated dogs.
 
 A nail clipper made for dogs: This tool comes in sizes (the label says 
whether the clipper is for small, medium, or large dogs).
 
 Pest-control products to prevent fleas, ticks, and heartworms: The best 
ones come from your veterinarian (for more on pest control, see Book II, 
Chapter 2).
 
 Chew toys: Puppies need to have acceptable things to chew so they 
don’t chew your things. Chew toys include hard rubber teethers and 
edible chew toys like rawhide, pig’s ears, hooves, and jerky treats.
 
 Some vets advise against certain edible chew toys, like rawhide, for some 
dogs, because they can pose a choking hazard or upset a stomach. If you 
aren’t sure which edible toys are safe for your dog, talk to your vet.
 
 Interactive toys for bonding time: Whether you throw a tennis ball or 
a Frisbee or play tug of war with a rope toy, be sure to get a few toys 
that you and your dog can play with together. These toys give you great 
ways to play with your dog in the doggy way that she enjoys.
Beyond the basics
Some doggy accoutrements are necessities for certain dogs and luxury items 
are for others. Dog litter boxes, ramps and stairs, and special grooming 
supplies are among the more common ones.
Dog litter boxes are good for pet owners who can’t easily take their little 
dogs outside, people with mobility issues, or pet owners who live in high-rise 
apartments in the city. Dog litter boxes are sized for different dogs and come 
with pelleted paper litter-box filler that absorbs moisture. When litter-box 
training your dog, you need to change the litter after each use. Another 
option is framed squares of sod or artificial turf so your dog gets the feel of 
going on the grass even while he’s inside.
Coat conditioner and coat spray are essential for long-coated dogs. A square 
of velvet or a chamois to polish short coats is a nice addition. Some dogs 
look better when washed with special shampoos made to brighten white 
coats, darken dark coats, or soothe sensitive skin. Dogs with allergies or fleas

may need special shampoos that help them resolve their health issues. Some 
companies make lines of dog spa products with natural botanicals. You can 
even buy doggy cologne to keep your pooch sweet smelling.
Ramps and stairs are good for dogs with sensitive spines, like 
Dachshunds, or senior dogs with arthritis who have trouble jumping up 
and down from couches, beds, and cars. You can buy beautiful padded 
ramps and stairs for inside, or more utilitarian versions for cars and 
even for swimming pools and boats to help your little swimmer get out 
of the water more easily. This item may actually be an important safety 
device if you have a swimming pool and your dog can’t easily get out of 
it. In that case, consider it a must-have.
Book I, Chapter 6 has a lot more on doggie stuff you may want to buy.
Welcoming Doggy Home
When the house is prepared and well stocked, you can load up your adopted 
dog into the car (don’t forget a dog seat belt or crate!), drive home, pull into 
the driveway, coax him out of the car, and then . . . wouldn’t it be nice if your 
new adopted dog bounded happily into the house, engaged in a quick game 
of fetch, sniffed and licked the family, and then curled up in his doggy bed for 
a nap, happy tail a-waggin’?
Even though such scenarios have been known to happen, they’re not 
common. The more likely reaction you can expect from your adopted dog is 
that she will be a little nervous, maybe a little scared, probably curious, and 
maybe so excited that she can hardly contain herself — literally. She may 
even experience a few more serious adjustment problems.
 
The trick to helping your dog make a smooth and quick transition to her new 
home is immediately establishing routines and sticking to them. Dogs pick 
up quickly on the rules of a new place, so the sooner they get that information 
from you, the sooner they can adjust to their new situations. Keep initial 
introductions calm and limited. Don’t mob your new dog with people, toys, 
games, treats, and attention all at once. Dogs react to the moods and actions 
of the people around them, so if you want a calm, relaxed dog, then try to act 
calm and relaxed. If you act anxious, worried, or excitable, your dog picks up 
on your cues. If your dog thinks you have the situation fully and confidently in 
hand, she can relax a little bit and not have to worry about trying to manage 
things herself.
In most cases, calm behavior and a comfortable routine win out, quickly 
sending your adopted dog the message that all is right with the world again.

Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Dog, meet potty spot
Taking care of business is the first thing to do when you get home with your 
adopted dog — and by “business,” we mean the business of housetraining. 
Regardless of your dog’s age, adults and puppies need to know where they 
are allowed to fulfill their, um . . . elimination requirements. Housetraining 
problems are among the chief reasons people give up their dogs to animal 
shelters, so managing this issue right from the start is super important.
Choosing a potty spot
Before bringing your new pet home, you need to know in advance where you 
want him to go. If you have a yard, great. But you also need to pick a spot 
in the yard that will be most convenient, a spot where people aren’t likely 
to walk through. Secluded locations are better than spots right near the 
sidewalk or street. Some dogs don’t care where they go, but others may feel 
vulnerable and don’t want to do their business with cars whizzing by on the 
other side of the fence or other dogs wandering past with their owners and 
barking.
If you want to paper-train or litter-box-train your pet, the spot where you 
place the receptacle must be ready to go before your new dog comes home. 
Place it in an area that’s away from high foot traffic and easy to clean, such as 
on a linoleum or tile floor and far from your dog’s sleeping area. Dogs don’t 
like to eliminate near where they sleep.
Telling your dog where to go
As soon as you get home, you may be tempted to take off your dog’s leash 
and let her explore the house. Wait! Don’t unclip that leash from that collar 
just yet. First, take your dog to the place where you want her to eliminate, 
either in the yard or in the area of the house you’ve chosen. Keeping that 
leash on, have your dog sniff, circle, and check out the spot, but stay where 
you are until she relieves herself. Although this process can take a long time, 
wait. If you know that your dog recently relieved herself and simply doesn’t 
need to go, skip to the next section about introducing your dog to her den. 
You can go back and try this step again and again. And again. You’ll find 
repetition of this step a worthwhile endeavor.
Rewarding a job well done
When your dog does go in the right spot, say hooray! Praise him, pet him, 
and call him a very good dog because he just did something very good. He 
went where you wanted him to go, and that’s a big step for a new dog in a 
new home. Make sure that he knows he has pleased you.

Then if you have a fenced yard, you can let him off the leash to explore on his 
own. If you don’t have a fence, lead him around the yard on the leash and let 
him sniff, check out the perimeter, and figure out what’s what. Finally, bring 
him in the house. Or if your dog’s potty spot is inside and you’re already in 
the house, you can give him a chance to explore the rest of the house now.
Showing your dog to her den
Now is the time to grab some treats, because you’re about to introduce your 
dog to her new best friend — aside from you, of course. Dogs are naturally 
den animals and like a safe place to call their own. One of your most powerful 
tools for helping your dog feel safe and comfortable in her new home is the 
dog den.
Whether you choose to use a plastic crate (see Figure 5-1), a wire kennel, or a 
portable wire enclosure — sometimes called an exercise pen or X-pen — your 
dog needs somewhere to feel safe. Crates and kennels with latching doors 
can help with housetraining and travel, but if your dog already is house-
trained and not destructive, you may not need to latch the door just yet. If 
the kennel is all wire, cover it with a blanket, leaving only the front open. 
Dogs feel safest when they can rest without feeling the need to watch their 
backs. Your dog probably wants to be near you, so situate the den in a room 
where your dog can at least hear, if not see you, when she’s resting.

choice for 
a “den” is a

sides and

opens and 
closes.
 

86
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
To attract your dog’s interest, make sure that the den is comfortable and 
soft, and then open the door. Get your dog’s attention with a treat, or lead 
her to the den by her leash. Then toss a few treats into the den and step 
back. Don’t force your dog to go inside the den, and don’t shut the door after 
her if she does go in on her own. Leave the den open so she can explore. If 
she goes in to get the treat, praise her, but stay back. Let her know her den is 
a safe spot, not jail, and that even you won’t grab at her while she’s in there. 
Talk softly and pleasantly to your dog as she explores her new den. Hide 
treats inside the den periodically so your dog gets the message that she is 
likely to find something delicious inside that safe, comfy spot.
And what if your dog doesn’t take to the den right away? Young puppies can 
quickly learn to accept the den but can endure being in it only a few minutes 
at a time at first. Even if your pup is whining and crying, don’t make a big deal 
about it, or you risk increasing her anxiety. Put her in the den, shut the door, 
stay nearby, talk casually but reassuringly to the dog, and then let her out 
again. Increase the amount of time your dog spends in the den just a few 
minutes at a time over a period of a few days. Pretty soon, your puppy 
will get used to the routine and recognize the den as something safe and 
predictable.
In the case of an older adopted dog who has neither been in a crate before 
nor had any bad experiences with the crate, not forcing the issue is an 
important attitude for you to take. Just leave the den door open and let your 
dog adjust at her own rate. If the dog is truly fearful of the crate, keep working 
to make the den an inviting place without putting any pressure on her.
 
If your dog’s first experiences with her den — and with the entire house and 
yard — are filled with positive associations like pleasant, calm interaction 
and plenty of yummy treats, you set the stage for a happy home.
You can let your dog rest in her den awhile or you can move on to introduce 
her to her new family, if she’s ready.
Introducing people
The more people your dog meets in a pleasant and positive environment, 
the better socialized he becomes. First of all, he needs to get to know you, 
his new favorite person. Next, he needs to meet the other people who live in 
your house. Finally, he needs to meet all kinds of other people, too.
Dogs who are familiar with many different people of different ages, sizes, hair 
types, colors, and mobilities become better judges of character than dogs 
who rarely see anyone beyond the people who live in the house. Dogs are 
social animals, and they find people fascinating. The more they know about 
the curious existence of their two-legged caretakers, the better they get along 
living in a human world. (The next section covers a lot more about socializing.)

 Chapter 5: Helping Your Adopted Dog Make the Homecoming Transition
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
Meeting the parents
Your dog first must get to know you and the other adults in your household. 
These introductions need to be positive, friendly, and not too overwhelming. 
Your dog is learning about you as you take her around the house and yard, 
showing her this new environment, but you also need to spend some time 
focusing on your dog on that first day:
 
 Sitting on the floor with your dog
 
 Letting your dog sniff you
 
 Petting your dog
 
 Talking to your dog
 
 Showing your dog some toys
See what happens when you throw a ball for your dog. Will she chase it? 
Retrieve it? Or ignore it? Try to figure out what your dog likes and doesn’t 
like, what interests her or makes her nervous. The more you find out about 
your dog, the more she will also learn about you.
When introducing your dog to other adults, one person at a time is plenty for 
your dog to take in. Have your dog sniff and investigate the other adults in 
the house, and have the other adults give your adopted dog treats and gentle 
petting. Take cues from your dog. If she seems overwhelmed or nervous, 
take it slow, or save introductions for later. If she seems interested to meet 
everyone, give him that interaction time.
Lapping up the kid time
Kids love dogs and get pretty excited about a new dog in the house. Dogs 
love kids, too — most of the time. Before you’re completely familiar with 
your new adopted dog, however, prepare your child for how to interact with 
a new dog and carefully supervise all child-dog interactions. For that first 
introduction, clip on your dog’s leash.
Before bringing home an adopted dog, children need to know that this 
newest four-legged family member may be nervous, overly excited, or even 
scared. Loud, quick-moving children can intimidate a dog, especially one that 
isn’t familiar with children. Explain to your children that first impressions 
are important, and if the new dog’s first impression of them is one of fear, 
then the new dog may not want to play with the children. Children need to 
approach a new dog quietly, slowly, and with soft gentle voices.
Likewise, children need to play with a new dog (or any small dog or puppy) 
while sitting with her on the floor instead of trying to pick up the puppy and 
carry her around. Have the child sit, and then let the dog approach the child 
while the dog is on a leash held by a responsible adult. Keep control over the 
dog so she doesn’t jump on the child, and make sure that the child handles 
the dog gently. Depending on their age, you can let children feed the dog 

88
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
treats or offer her a new toy, but only under strict adult supervision. You 
don’t want your new dog bullying your child to get the treats. With your help, 
the child needs to be in control of when the dog gets the treat. This kind of 
positive first meeting sends a message to your dog that short little humans 
are just as nice and safe and rewarding as the taller ones. Your dog can 
become your child’s best buddy, but maintaining control over the situation is 
important so the relationship starts off on the right paw.
 
If your dog reacts too roughly or even fearfully or aggressively toward a child, 
take the matter seriously and don’t let child and dog interact unsupervised, 
ever, until the matter is fully resolved. Consult a professional trainer or 
behaviorist for advice. See Book IV, Chapter 2 for more information about 
handling behavior problems in adopted dogs. Take aggressive behavior 
seriously and tackle the problem immediately. Aggression doesn’t just go 
away on its own. Don’t risk any child’s safety.
Relying on friends to help socialize your dog: The welcome-home party
Even if you have a big family, meeting other people is important for your new 
dog. It can happen on walks through the neighborhood or trips in the car, 
but another great way to socialize your dog with all kinds of people is to have 
a dog party. Ask a variety of friends over for snacks and playtime with your 
new dog.
Throwing a party doesn’t mean that you just let your friends mob your 
adopted dog. Remember that all your dog’s initial interactions with people 
need to be calm and positive. Give your friends treats to give your dog. Have 
them approach her one at a time for petting and play. As everyone gives your 
dog focused and happy attention, your dog gets the impression that people 
are just great to be around and well worth pleasing.
 
Before socializing your dog, make sure that she doesn’t have any aggression 
issues, such as snapping to protect food, or fear issues, such as anxiety 
around certain kinds of people. Putting your dog in situations in which she 
feels nervous, cornered, or surrounded by too many people before she’s 
ready can actually make her more fearful or anxious. You’re the best judge 
for determining whether your dog is ready for this kind of stimulation and 
socialization. If you aren’t sure, try inviting friends over one at a time for 
awhile to find out how your dog reacts. And keep the treats coming.
Introducing other pets
Meeting the humans in the house is one thing; introducing other pets is 
something else. Some dogs get along just fine with other dogs, but others 
have issues with perceived competitors. Some dogs don’t think twice about 
cats, but others follow the cartoon stereotype and see cats as prey animals 
and great chase opportunities. Small animals and birds can look a lot like 
prey animals, too.

89
 Chapter 5: Helping Your Adopted Dog Make the Homecoming Transition

and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
Some cats, in turn, are not accepting and are downright nasty about canines 
intruding on their happy homes. Your task: Carefully introduce your new 
dog to other pets in the household, to prevent conflict and to subvert potential 
tragedy. Doing so can take some time, and some animals don’t adjust to their 
new siblings for weeks or even months. Take it slow, be diplomatic, and 
supervise all interactions until everyone can be reliably trusted.
Dogs meet dog
Most dogs tend to relate to each other in a hierarchical system of leaders 
and followers, and most dogs tend to be at least somewhat territorial. If you 
already have a dog who’s used to being the only dog in the house, he probably 
will see another dog as an interloper and want to make darned sure that the 
new dog knows his place.
A new dog on new turf may defer to the previous resident dog. On the other 
hand, expect no guarantees of a conflict-free meeting. Dogs learn crucial 
dog-to-dog communication skills when they are still with their littermates 
between 3 and 6 weeks of age. Puppies who are deprived of this time together 
may not understand how to communicate well with other dogs. Like people, 
some dogs just tend to have stronger personalities and try to be the leader. If 
you put two such dogs together, you can have squabbles.
You can reduce the likelihood of a brawl by taking some or all of these steps:
 
 Adopt a female dog if you already have a male dog, or vice versa. Male 
and female dogs together are less likely to fight than dogs of the same 
gender. Spayed or neutered dogs get along better, too.
 
 Introduce the dogs first on neutral territory, such as at the shelter or the 
home of a friend.
 
 Remember that the first dog may see your home as his territory and 
feel threatened that another dog is on his turf. Supervise all interactions 
until the dogs accept each other.
 
 Be patient. Dogs may take a few hours to become fast friends, but some 
dogs may never get along very well. The relationship probably will 
improve with time, but it can take weeks or even months.
 
 Keep both dogs on their leashes, with each handled by a separate adult. 
You must be a strong presence and maintain control. When both dogs 
think a third party is in control of the situation, they may feel less 
anxious, fearful, or defensive.
 
 Let both dogs spend some extended time getting acquainted on either 
side of a baby gate (see Figure 5-2), screen door, or other barrier that 
neither is able to jump over. Doing so can help dogs gain interest in each 
other without the threat of one dog invading the other’s space.
 
 Give each dog his own space, his own den, and room to run away to in 
case of a confrontation. A brand-new kennel or crate isn’t automatically 

90
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
the resident dog’s property, so it gives the new dog a place to feel safe. 
Keep the door open so the new dog can go in whenever he needs a safe 
spot, but keep the resident dog out of the new dog’s den.
 
 Give both dogs plenty of attention and separate training time, especially 
your resident dog, who may be feeling neglected. Make sure he knows 
you aren’t replacing him!
 
 Take it slow. Not everybody wants a new sibling. Let both dogs take 
time getting to know each other, and supervise all interactions until they 
work out their new relationship.
 
Figure 5-2: 
A baby gate 
can help 
your new 
dog and 
your 
resident 
dog get 
acquainted.
 
 
If your two dogs get into a fight, don’t stick your hand in the middle, because 
you can get hurt doing so. Keep a squirt gun or a spray bottle filled with 
water handy and distract the dogs with a spritz — or make a loud noise, 
like shaking a can of pennies or pebbles. As soon as they stop fighting for a 
moment, separate them immediately and put each in his or her respective 
den or separate room to cool off.
 
If you can’t seem to resolve the issue, call a local dog trainer who uses 
positive reinforcement. A trainer can work with you and your dogs, giving 
you some strategies tailored for your individual situation.

Introducing kitty
Some dogs get along just great with cats. Honest! In many cases, though, dogs 
who aren’t raised with cats see them as something to chase. Conversely, 
dogs who are raised with cats may let their guards down in front of a claw-
wielding whirlwind, so be careful in that case, too. A new puppy probably 
can learn to accept your cat as a member of the family. An adult dog who has 
lived with cats successfully before also will probably be okay.
 
A shelter or rescue worker may be able to provide information about the 
dog’s history. An adult dog who isn’t familiar with cats may pose a problem.
When introducing a dog and a cat, both need protection. Be sure that your 
cat’s claws are trimmed, to prevent serious injury to your dog, whose eyes 
are especially vulnerable. And make sure that your cat has safe places to 
escape if the dog attempts to give chase. Finally, supervise all interactions 
until you’re sure that both pets can be trusted.
Some people keep their dogs and cats separated, giving each one a separate 
level of the house or individual room, but doing so can be complicated and a 
slip-up can cause disaster. Regular obedience training can help you and your 
dog communicate so that your dog understands what is and is not allowed in 
your home — and that includes cat chasing. A few dogs never are able to 
live peacefully with cats. If that happens to you, you may need to consider 
returning your new pet to the shelter or rescue group in favor of a dog who 
does get along with cats. Naturally, returning to the shelter is stressful for 
the dog, so never rush into an adoption without a good chance that your new 
dog will fit into your home situation.
Small animals: Friends, not doggy snacks
Some dogs have strong instincts for chasing and killing small animals. 
Terriers, for example, have been bred for centuries to strengthen their 
instincts for going after vermin — that’s why they’re called ratters. If you have 
hamsters, gerbils, rats, mice, guinea pigs, ferrets, or rabbits as pets, your dog 
may feel a compulsion to get to them, so you must be extra careful to keep 
these small creatures safe. Introduce them carefully, or keep the small animal 
in a place where the dog won’t see it, and never leave small animals or birds 
alone with dogs, for the safety of both — a dog can kill a small bird, but to a 
small dog, a large parrot is a formidable foe. Make sure that bird cages are 
out of reach and inaccessible to your dog.

92
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Downtime
Your dog now has had a bathroom break (or two), seen his den, met the family 
and other pets, and done some power sniffing around his new digs. That’s a 
big day for a dog! Before you launch into a training session, a walk around the 
neighborhood, or any further family chaos, give your dog some downtime.
Remember that doggy den? Take your dog back to his special safe place, 
throw in some treats, and let him go inside. If he won’t, herd him gently 
inside and close the door. Praise him and talk gently and positively, and then 
without making a big deal about it, let him have a rest.
Your dog may whine, cry, or whimper pathetically, but never fear, you don’t 
have to leave him in there for hours. Instead, leave him in the den for 15 to 
20 minutes. He may settle down and take a nap, or he may just watch you for 
awhile. If he seems nervous, you can stay in the same room, but don’t pay 
any attention to him. This time is specifically for your dog to be by himself, 
and your sympathetic attentions will only make him worry. Remind yourself 
that you aren’t ignoring your dog. You’re teaching him self-sufficiency and 
confidence, and you’re teaching him that when he is in his den, his time is his 
own and nobody will bother him.
After a short rest period, let your dog out of the den again. Then take him 
right back to that potty spot outside, on his leash, until he does his business. 
Then get on with whatever activities you have planned next. Repeat these 
short, positive, unemotional den-rest sessions throughout the day; your dog 
will quickly learn to appreciate and even look forward to them. Pretty soon, 
he may go on in there all by himself.
When night falls, tuck your dog into his den until morning, close the door to 
keep him safely inside, and prepare to endure a night or two of crying and 
whining. Your new puppy, or even an adult dog, may not understand at first 
that this is time for sleeping and that he can come out again in the morning, 
but after a few nights, he’ll get the routine. Remember how much dogs 
depend on routine? Young puppies probably need a bathroom break during 
the night, once or maybe twice, but don’t get up every time the puppy cries 
to commiserate. Send the message instead that this is how it works and 
everybody likes it that way. Soon your puppy will like it that way, too.
For adult dogs who truly resist the crate, set up a comfy bed beside yours so 
your dog knows that you’re nearby (be sure to close your bedroom door so 
the dog isn’t free to roam while you sleep). Your new adopted dog needs a 
sense of security, and night is one opportunity to reinforce that. The first few 
nights can be trying on any new pet owner, but just think of how the adopted 
dog feels. Most dogs adjust very quickly and sleep through the night sooner 
than a human baby would. Plan on a nap tomorrow, and be patient. In a week, 
chances are those nighttime woes will be a distant memory.

Calming Your Puppy Based on Her Age
 
Puppies, like children, go through developmental stages, and each stage 
brings with it a new perspective. In the earliest stages, everything is new, 
and your puppy’s trust in you is innocent and faithful. As she ages, however, 
she’s prone to challenge and question your opinion while still being unsure 
of life’s variety. Maturing puppies, especially ones going through adolescence 
and puberty, have their own set of opinions and must be consistently 
persuaded to mind you. You’ll need a creative approach to socialization.
Acclimating a young pup (8 to 12 weeks)
 
When he’s very young, your puppy will mirror your reaction in all new 
situations. If you’re nervous, he will be, too. If you get excited, uncomfortable, 
or edgy, he’ll follow suit. Expose your puppy to new experiences under 
controlled circumstances so you’ll be centered and prepared to deal with 
your puppy’s reaction.
Young puppies generally react to new situations in one of four ways:
 
 Fearfully: Noted by a hesitant body posture, these puppies pull back 
or scurry to leave the environment. Often they scratch to be held or 
acknowledged.
Socialization and civility in the puppy world
A puppy is hard-wired with a prime socializa-
tion window. During this window, between 8 
to 12 weeks, her brain is developing and she’s 
receptive to new experiences. She’s constantly 
looking to you for your interpretation of these 
experiences. Now is the time to introduce her 
to everything she will encounter throughout her 
life, from objects and people to noises and other 
animals.
Even though some of your early excursions may 
be restricted until your puppy is fully inoculated, 
make every effort to expose her to a variety of 
stimulants so that she’ll be more relaxed when 
she’s presented with something new.
If your puppy is older than 12 weeks, don’t 
despair. Even though your puppy has passed 
her impression window, she’s still open to 
your example when she gets overwhelmed 
or excited. A noticeably defensive or wary 
reaction simply indicates that your puppy has 
no conscious memory of such an occurrence 
and isn’t sure how to act. In these 
circumstances, your reactions to both the 
situation and the puppy are important. Placating, 
soothing, or corrective responses actually 
intensify a puppy’s reactions by focusing 
attention on the inappropriate behavior.

94
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
 
 Calmly: These pups are patiently observant and have a relaxed body 
posture and mild curiosity.
 
 Actively: Because they’re very interactive, these puppies explore the 
new stimulation with gusto and may be hard to calm down or refocus.
 
 Defensively: Puppies who act defensively may back up, hold still, or run 
forward. Or they may do all three maneuvers and bark or vocalize their 
feelings in some way. Their ears may be flattened against their heads, 
and they may hide behind your legs or try to climb up into your arms 
or lap.
 
Any attention given to a puppy reinforces his reaction, which is fine if and 
only if your puppy is reacting calmly. Other responses need redirecting. Read 
on to find out how.
Fear is a common response that shows your puppy doesn’t like to make 
interpretations alone. Because of your pup’s dependence, new situations 
demand your guidance and direction.
 
Don’t coddle your puppy if she has a fearful reaction, because your immediate 
attention indicates submission, not leadership. Your lowered body posture 
and high-pitched tone convey the message that you’re afraid, too. A better 
response on your part is to stand tall, either ignoring your puppy or kneeling 
at her side. Brace her by clipping your thumb under her collar and holding 
her in a sitting position. Above all else, though, you need to remain calm and 
assured: Your puppy will be impressed by your confidence.
A relaxed reaction is a good sign that your puppy will take everything in 
stride. Some puppies are so relaxed, however, that they don’t register the 
distraction you’re introducing, such as a uniformed police officer. If this 
scenario sounds familiar, use treats to bring your puppy’s attention to the 
situation at hand.
Many puppies love life — a lot. To them, new experiences hold endless 
possibilities. Even at a young age, passion emanates from everything they do. 
The goal in new situations and introductions isn’t to bring these pups out of 
their shells. Instead, the goal is to successfully contain their excitement. To 
displace their enthusiasm, use toys and the bracing technique.
 
An early defensive reaction (before 12 weeks) should be noted and taken 
seriously. If the tips in this book don’t lessen your puppy’s intensity, hire a 
professional. The onset of adolescence, with the release of adult hormones, 
will only intensify an aggressive response. Deal with such behavior immediately.
If your puppy has an intense reaction (one that’s fearful, overexcited, or 
defensive) to a new situation or person, determine her Red Zone: the distance 
from the stimulus where she can stand comfortably. Stand just outside this 
zone and handle your puppy calmly by using commands, toys, or treats to 
keep her focus.

Catching up an older pup 
(12 weeks and older)
 
A puppy past the critical socialization time may have a more pronounced 
reaction to new situations, especially if he has no similar experience in his 
memory bank. For example, an older puppy who hasn’t navigated a stairway 
or hardwood floor may be terrified at the prospect. How you handle such 
a situation determines his future attitude. A dog who is fearful of specific 
things will be more leery of new situations throughout his life.
 
Discover your puppy’s body language and take it very seriously. Focus on his 
eyes, body position, tail, and mouth. Even though he can’t talk in words, 
your puppy will tell you everything if you listen with your eyes. Check out

Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Turn your “can’t do” puppy into a “can do” dog by being the example you 
want him to follow. When your puppy’s response is pronounced, stay very 
calm. Keep your eyes focused on the situation at hand (not on your puppy) 
and interact with the stimulus — be it a person, situation, or object — in the 
manner you want him to mirror.
 
If you look at your puppy, or even glance back at him, he may misconstrue 
your posture and visual confirmation as insecurity. For example, think of 
playing on a team: The captain wouldn’t shout a direction and then look to 
the players for confirmation. The same rules apply with your pup. When 
directing your puppy, stand confident and focus on the situation at hand.
Teaching Your Puppy to Be 
Accepting of All People
 
Regardless of your puppy’s age, three variables determine her ability to 
relate to others around her:
 
 Breed influences
 
 Socialization experience
 
 Your example
Even though your puppy’s breed drives are predetermined, you can vastly 
shape the future through socialization and positive modeling.
Socializing your young puppy 
(8 to 12 weeks)
A young puppy will look to you to interpret everything in his life. How you 
interact with and greet people from all walks of life is his greatest example. 
Disciplinary issues evolve when too much excitement is present during 
greetings. These issues evolve because your puppy interprets this excitement 
as hyperactive play, and though it can be fun initially, it gets old fast.
 
A better plan is to actually have a plan. Expose and introduce your puppy 
to as many new people as time allows. You should follow the same routine 
whether the person is 9 or 90, in a tux or dressed down, uniformed, or in 
costume. The wider the variety, the better.
Mothers are right when they say good manners start at home. When greeting 
your puppy, be very casual. Even though you may be beside yourself with 
delight, stay calm and interact with your puppy only when he’s calm, too.

Condition your puppy to a leash and collar, and keep these items on him 
when meeting new people. Use them to guide him, as if you’re holding a 
young child’s hand. When possible, ask people to ignore any extreme reactions, 
from hyperactivity to fear or defensiveness. Simply put, when he reacts 
extremely, act as if your puppy isn’t even there. When applied for a few 
minutes, this approach will de-escalate any concern and will condition your 
puppy to look to and reflect your reaction.
After the new person is an established presence, which takes about one to 
five minutes, kneel down next to your puppy, brace him by clipping your 
thumb under him collar, and hold him in a sitting position (see Figure 5-3). 
Repeat “Say hello” as the person pats your puppy.

If your puppy is fearful or tense, ask the person to shake a treat cup and treat 
him, to create a new and more positive outlook.
Shaping up older puppies
Is your older pup out of control or poorly conditioned to greeting new 
people? Don’t give it another thought. She may become hyper when the 
doorbell rings, react defensively to men in uniform, or act warily around 
toddlers, but you can reshape her focus with patience, ingenuity, and calm 
consistency.
 
When left unchecked, such behavior may result in a dog who’s permanently 
wary of children or defensive with the delivery man. Consider living with this 
erratic behavior for ten or more years — it won’t be fun. However, you have 
the power to reshape your future.

Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Remember the following three key points, regardless of her preestablished 
habits, when introducing your puppy to new situations and people:
 
 Whoever is in front is in charge.
 
 A confident and calm body posture conveys confidence and self-assurance.
 
 A steady voice will be followed.
 
No matter what your puppy’s behavior is, it developed in large part because 
of your attention. Puppies repeat anything that ensures interaction — they 
don’t care whether it’s negative or positive interaction. If your pup is hyper, 
you likely tried to calm her by grabbing her fur, pushing her, or holding her. 
When a defensive or wary reaction results in a soothing and high-pitched “It’s 
okay,” the translation is that of mutual concern. What this puppy needs is a 
human example of confidence, which is conveyed with clear direction and a 
calm, upright body posture.
To resolve this greeting dilemma and recondition your pup, do the following:
 
 Create a greeting station in sight of, but at least 6 feet behind, the 
greeting door.
 
 Secure a short 2-foot leash to the area and repeat “Back” as you lead 
your puppy and attach her before opening the door.
 
 Ignore your puppy until she has fully calmed down.
Though it may be difficult to ignore her initial vocalizations and spasms, it 
won’t take long for her to discover that a relaxed posture gets immediate 
attention.
Encourage everyone in your home to respond in kind: No one gives the pup 
attention until she’s considerably calmer. You can leave a bone or toy at her 
greeting station to help her displace her excitement or frustration.
 
If your puppy is defensive or fearful, put a head collar on her. This head 
collar automatically relaxes your puppy because the weight placed over her 
nose and behind her head stimulates the same pressure points her mother 
would use to calm her. Book I, Chapter 6 discusses collars in more detail.
Also, to help her become used to new situations and people, take your puppy 
out and socialize her with as many new people as you can find. Teach and 
use the directions “Let’s go,” “Stay,” “Down,” “Wait,” and “Back,” as described 
in several chapters of Book IV. These commands teach your pup the following:
 
 Let’s go: Instructs your puppy to walk behind you and watch for your 
direction.

 Stay: Stresses impulse control and focus. Precede this direction with a 
“Sit” or “Down” command.
 
 Under: Directs your puppy to lie under your legs or under a table. These 
safe places reinforce that you’re her guardian and protector.
 
 Wait: Instructs your puppy to stop in her tracks and look to you before 
proceeding.
 
 Back: Directs your puppy to get behind you and reminds her that you’re 
in charge.
 
If your puppy is wary of a person, ask him to ignore the puppy and to 
avoid all eye contact. Eye contact is often interpreted as predatory or 
confrontational and will often intensify your puppy’s reaction.
Introducing your puppy to people 
of all shapes and sizes
Getting your puppy comfortable with life needs to start with introducing him 
to the variety of people he’ll meet in his lifetime. Each person has a unique 
look and smell. So that your puppy doesn’t mature into a dog who singles 
anyone out, you need to socialize him early on with the whole spectrum. 
Check out Table 5-2 for guidance.
 
The use of a creamy spread (such as peanut butter, tofu, cheese, or yogurt) 
encourages a gentle interaction. Infrequent use means that your puppy will 
be enamored with any situation that produces this delight.

Conditioning Your Puppy 
to Life’s Surprises
 
Socializing your puppy to all of life’s surprises is just as important as training 
her during the first year. Though a puppy may do a four-star “Stay” in your 
living room, if she falls to pieces after you hit the road, you won’t be able to 
take her anywhere. And your puppy has so much more in store for her than a 
variety of different people. Exposing your puppy to all of life’s surprises will 
encourage calm acceptance and healthy curiosity to anything new the two of 
you may encounter.
Other animals
A 1-year-old Terrier-Whippet mix was rescued from New Orleans after 
Hurricane Katrina. Not only was snow a new concept to her, but squirrels 
were riveting. Sweet and demure, she spun 180 degrees when facing the pros-
pect of chasing a yard full of busy, gray tidbits. Three directions were needed 
for this pup: “Back,” “Sit-stay,” and “Wait.” Impulse control was the order of 
the day.

103
 Chapter 5: Helping Your Adopted Dog Make the Homecoming Transition
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
 
Whether your pup is young or old, he must learn impulse control when he 
notices other animals in his surroundings. When you notice a critter before 
your puppy does, instruct him by saying “Back” and guide him to your side. 
Then kneel down facing the critter and use the command “Sit-stay” to 
encourage your pup’s containment. If your puppy’s radar alerts first, how-
ever, you’ll notice it in his ears, which will be erect and riveted. He’ll orient 
himself toward the distraction. When he does, direct “Back” and kneel down 
to brace him. Finally, instruct “Stay.”
As your puppy’s impulse control matures, encourage him to follow you by 
using the “Follow” direction. You can discourage any interest with a quick tug 
of the leash. Praise and treat him for resisting the temptation.
Weather patterns
Your puppy’s first thunderstorm may be a memorable event. The best thing 
you can do is absolutely nothing. Emotional reassurance on your part will 
get misconstrued as mutual fear, and your puppy could quickly develop a 
phobic reaction to the situation. By staying calm, reading a book, or laying 
low, you’re setting an example of how to act in a storm. Also consider taping 
a storm and playing it at low levels during play or feeding until your puppy is 
conditioned to the sound.
 
If your puppy has already developed a fearful reaction to storms, fit her for a 
head collar and guide her on the lead through each storm, acting as though 
nothing is happening. When possible, stay on the ground floor, offering your 
puppy nothing more than a flavorful bone. Pay attention to her only when 
she’s relaxed. Her reactivity will improve in time. Speak to your veterinarian 
about medication if the lead training doesn’t work.
Some puppies don’t like going outside in the rain, and others don’t ever want 
to come in. Even though your puppy is unlikely to change her mind about the 
rain, you can try winning her over by leaving her inside as you play outside in 
the rain — but make sure that you play where she can watch. If you have no 
luck, it’s time to get a big golf umbrella and plan quick outings with your pup.
 
Snow and cold present another issue, especially for tiny or thin-coated 
breeds. When the temperature drops, your puppy’s muscles contract. This 
contraction includes your puppy’s bladder muscles, which makes elimination 
difficult, if not impossible. Consider a puppy coat and, dare we say it, booties, 
when faced with cold weather. If your puppy is small, consider teaching her 
to go on paper exclusively or in addition to eliminating outside. If you don’t 
like the papers inside your home, consider putting them in the hallway or 
garage and using them only when the weather’s bad.

104
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Objects
You’re walking down the road, whistling and strolling happily along, when 
suddenly you notice three gigantic black garbage bags wafting in the wind. 
You visually assess the situation and are quickly done with the thought 
process. It’s not, however, so easy for your puppy. Puppies assess new 
objects with their noses and can’t emotionally settle until they’ve had a good 
sniff. Whenever possible, approach the situation like a grown dog. Doing so 
will provide a confident, assured example for your puppy to follow.
Let the leash go slack when safe and hold the end as you approach the 
object. Kneel or bend down to your puppy’s level and pretend to sniff the 
object confidently. Wait patiently as your puppy assesses your reaction. 
When he approaches, speak calmly, petting him and tucking him into your 
side when he’s comfortable.
 
If you can’t approach the object, simply kneel at your pup’s side and brace 
him as you remind him to “Stay” and then “Follow.”
Various noises
 
Included on a good list of important noises to socialize your puppy may be 
fireworks, trucks, construction noises, vacuum cleaners, washing machines, 
sirens, and a baby’s cries. Each time you approach a loud situation or set one 
up, kneel and brace your puppy. If she is startled, back up until she’s more 
at ease and then repeat the handling technique. When she can comfortably 
face the distraction, calmly instruct her to “Stay.” Gradually move closer, and 
eventually the instruction to “Follow” may be enough to assure her because 
she has integrated the noise into her stimulus memory bank.
 
If your puppy has a more startled reaction, or if your puppy is older and 
unfamiliar with a noise or situation, you need to craft your approach to limit 
the intensity. If your pup looks like she may attack or run from a distraction, 
she’s clearly in a state of panic. Retreat from the situation immediately and 
figure out your puppy’s Red Zone. Work on treat- and toy-based lessons, 
brace her, and gradually move closer to the distraction.
 
If a specific sound is unsettling to your puppy, tape-record it. Play it at 
gradually increasing volumes while your puppy is playing or eating. If she’s 
still startled by the noise, lower the volume and play it in a distant room.

Places
You’ll have to wait until your puppy is inoculated to go on field trips. 
However, when your vet gives you the green light, go, go, go! Away from 
his home turf, surrounded by the unknown, your puppy will suddenly grow 
hyper with impulsive excitement, fearful, or defensive. Each reaction gives 
you the perfect opportunity to step in and direct him.
Regardless of your puppy’s response, use the directions “Let’s go,” “Stay,” 
and “Wait” as you navigate new places together. By doing so, your direction 
and posture says to your pup, “I’m the leader, follow me!”
In addition, bring a familiar bed or mat for your puppy to ride on in the car 
and to sit on when you expect him to be still. If you’re going to an outdoor 
restaurant, the vet, or school, bring his mat along and direct him to it. His 
mat will act like a security blanket, making him feel relieved, happy, and safe.
Quieting an excitable response
Freaking out with excitement is a common response to a new place for some 
puppies. Fit this type of pup with a head collar and brace her frequently. If 
she’s motivated by food, use it to focus her attention. Stay very calm and 
be the example you want her to follow. Brace her securely before people 
approach you.
 
You’ll have to work hard to teach this type of pup not to jump. If she rolls 
onto her belly during a greeting, say “Belly up” to encourage that response.
Correcting a fearful reaction
A fearful puppy needs a guardian and protector to step up and direct him: 
Here’s your curtain call. Avoid the temptation to bend and soothe your 
puppy. Instead, use a head collar to guide him — a neck collar can intensify 
fears because it may feel as if it’s choking him. Brace him when he’s most 
distressed, and stave off admirers until he’s more sure footed. When it’s time 
for introductions, bring yummy treats and be generous.
Chilling out a defensive reaction
A defensive puppy takes life a little too seriously. Socializing her is necessary 
to calm her intensity. Put a head collar on her and sit on the outskirts of a 
given activity or social setting. Teach your puppy the term “Back” to mean 
“Stay behind me because I’m in charge.” Repeat “Stay” when necessary, and 
remind her to “Follow.” Over time, your pup’s resolve will melt. Make a 
commitment now to socialize the paw off this puppy. Just remember that it 
may take many outings to mellow her caution to where she’ll become more 
pleasant to have around.

In This Chapter
 Choosing basic dog gear
 Sniffing out the coolest products
 Picking leashes and collars
 Finding fun dog stuff for you
 Going green with dog accessories
A
 dog can get by without much in the way of material belongings, and a 
great many of them do. A collar. A leash. A container for water and one 
for food. A warm, dry place to sleep. Something to play with or chew on.
Add love, training, and attention to the list, and, in truth, a dog doesn’t need 
much more. But, oh, how we love to spend money on our dogs! Selling pet 
supplies is a multibillion-dollar industry, with so much money spent on 
dog-related furniture, food, and toys that it seems the only difference 
between having a kid and having a dog is that you don’t need a college fund 
for the latter. That, and no matter how many things you buy your dog, she 
never gets spoiled.
Your dog couldn’t care less if the collar you buy her is diamond encrusted. 
A crystal bowl or a stainless steel one — it really doesn’t matter to her, as 
long as you put food in it. And you can color-coordinate her leash to match 
her collar and the interior of your SUV all you want, but it won’t impress her. 
Most of the dog-accessories decisions you face you make to please yourself. 
And that’s fine, as long as you meet your dog’s needs with gear that is well 
made, practical, and appropriate for her size and temperament.
At the most basic level, your dog needs food and shelter. That’s about the 
most any dog could ever have hoped for during the thousands of years 
humans and dogs have worked and lived together as companions and 
workmates. Everything you add to those basics is designed to make your 
dog’s life — and your own — safer, more convenient, and more enjoyable.

Chapter 1 in Book II. Keeping your dog well groomed — including the tools 
you need to buy to accomplish the deed — is covered in depth in Chapter 1 
of Book III.
Outdoor Accessories: Fences, 
Dog Runs, and Barriers
You have a responsibility to provide a safe, dry place for your dog, one that’s 
cool in the summer and warm in the winter; keeps him from roaming the 
neighborhood; and protects him from cars, thieves, and assorted sickos. 
Those requirements are the basics, but you’ll have a much better relationship 
with your dog — and he’ll be much happier — if you take him out of the 
doghouse and into your house.
What’s the point of keeping a completely outdoor dog as a pet? Protection? 
Fat lot of good that big dog will do you outside when burglars are inside your 
house. Companionship? You work all day and then come home, feed the 
outdoor dog, and maybe play with him a little. Then you go in and watch TV, 
and he sits outside alone.
Although some dogs handle the outdoors better than others, they still can 
cause a lot of problems. They bark day and night out of boredom and loneliness. 
They dig. They chew the siding off your house. They can teach themselves to 
be overzealously protective, to the point of dangerousness.
Some people who own outdoor dogs didn’t start out intending for them to 
live outside. Maybe the dog never was fully housetrained or was never taught 
to not jump on guests. Perhaps he doesn’t know how to behave himself 
around children. Perhaps he’s destructive, and you figure that it’s better if he 
eats the picnic table rather than the coffee table. Perhaps he smells horribly 
rank.
 
All those problems are fixable. Training solves behavior problems, and smell 
problems — well, that’s why we have baths. Grooming tips are covered in the 
chapters in Book III; behavior problems are explained in Chapters 1 through 
3 in Book IV.
 
You owe it to your dog, your family, and your neighbors to do what you can 
to avoid leaving your dog outside all the time.
If you must leave your dog outside, you must do your best to bring a little 
joy into your lonely dog’s life with time and outings to strengthen the bond 
between you. Don’t just throw some food out in the yard and forget him. That 
qualifies as abuse and could get you in trouble when neighbors complain to 
the authorities.

 Chapter 6: All the Right Stuff
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
Good fences make good dogs
Unless you’re an apartment dweller, your dog will probably spend a certain 
amount of time in your fenced backyard, ranging from a few minutes a day to 
do her business to perhaps the hours while you’re at work. You want to make 
her time outdoors as pleasant and safe as possible.
 
The ideal setup is a fenced yard away from the street. Solid 6-foot fencing is 
best to protect your pet from the view of people who might tease or steal her 
and to give her fewer reasons to bark. If you’re a gardener, consider allocating 
part of the yard for your dog and keeping the rest of it off limits unless you’re 
with her. One creative person designed a yard with a U-shaped area around 
the outside for the Airedale and an interior courtyard that was kept safe from 
his big paws.
Kennel runs
Kennel runs also work fine for keeping dogs out of trouble when you’re not 
with them. A kennel run is an longish enclosed area that the dog has access 
to. Keep it well protected from heat, cold, and wind; keep fresh water and 
toys always available; and be sure that your dog spends only a short amount 
of time in the run. Remember, a 10 x 6-foot run is a safe place to spend a few 
hours, but it’s no place to spend a life. You can build or buy a kennel run. 
Many online retailers sell materials for kennel runs and kits.
The dangers of chains
In many parts of the country, fenced yards are 
uncommon, so many people keep their dogs 
on chains. Tethering a dog for a short while is 
okay in a pinch — never with a choke collar, 
though — but a tethered existence is not a 
good one. And a chained dog should never 
be left unattended. In hot weather, staying 
outdoors can be even more dangerous, and 
even lethal, for a dog.
Dogs who spend their lives on chains are more 
likely to become dangerous, biting anyone 
who comes onto their turf, because they feel 
lonely and vulnerable. In fact, the profile of the 
average dog involved in a vicious bite incident 
is a young unneutered male on a chain.
In some cases, dogs have tried to jump a fence, 
didn’t have enough chain to clear it, and ended 
up hanging themselves from their collar on 
the other side of the fence. Dogs have also 
wrapped their chains around trees and died 
because they were desperately searching for 
water on hot days.
If you don’t have a fenced yard and you refuse 
to let the dog inside, then you really shouldn’t 
get a dog. If you do anyway, walking your dog a 
lot and installing a kennel run and a doghouse 
(covered elsewhere in this chapter) for him is 
far better than just putting him outside on a 
chain.

Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Electric fences
 
Electronic boundary systems that use shock collars to teach dogs the property 
lines can be useful in some situations, but they have some serious limitations. 
First, some dogs choose to go ahead and be shocked if the temptation on the 
other side is great enough, but once out, they avoid taking another hit to get 
home.
Also, an electronic boundary system does not protect your pet from animals 
or people who enter your property, so your dog can easily be attacked, 
poisoned, or stolen. And it does not protect people from your pet. Children 
can be bitten after coming into the territory of a dog behind an electric 
boundary system. A solid fence can spare children the injury — and also save 
a dog’s life, because a dog who bites a child will be put down.
 
Good fences make good neighbors. Sturdy, solid-wood fences also make good 
dogs.
Entrances and exits
Two products that make the ins and outs a little easier to handle are dog 
doors and baby gates:
 
 Dog doors: Most dog doors consist of a flap of metal or plastic that a pet 
can push with his nose or paws to open. They are great for anyone who 
doesn’t want to get up every time the dog scratches or whines at the 
door, and even better for people who leave a dog alone all day and want 
to provide access to the outdoors while they’re gone. Dog doors can be 
set up between house and yard, or between a garage and a yard. Some 
people build chutes with dog doors at both ends to cut down on drafts.
 
 For the sake of security, have your door installed where your pet’s 
comings and goings aren’t so noticeable, and close and lock it when it’s 
not needed, such as when you’re on vacation. Do remember, though, 
that a dog door — especially a large one — always carries a certain 
degree of risk. A young burglar, or a thin one, can gain access to your 
house through the flap.
 
 You can also install a dog door through an exterior wall rather than a 
door, though you’ll need the help of a contractor.
 
 Baby gates: These portable, removable barriers are available in pet-
supply catalogs and anywhere children’s things are sold. You can use 
them to limit a pet’s access to certain parts of the house.

111
 Chapter 6: All the Right Stuff
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
You can use the two products in combination to provide a safe and secure 
place for your pet when you’re away from home: Baby gates can keep the dog 
in the kitchen, for example, and a dog door can allow him to go to the part of 
the yard that he’s allowed in when you’re not with him.
Doghouses: Protection from the elements
If your dog spends much time outside — while you’re at work, perhaps — 
she needs shelter from heat and cold. One of the easiest ways to provide 
this shelter is to give her a doghouse. Your choices are pretty much wood or 
high-impact plastic.
No matter what material you choose, a doghouse should fit your pet snugly — 
she should be able to stand up and turn around, but not much more. Dogs 
have liked them for thousands of years. Providing your dog with a house 
that’s too large also makes it hard for her to stay warm inside it with just 
body heat. The doghouse should have an entrance that’s off-center so the 
dog can curl up in one end for warmth. A removable roof is helpful for easy 
cleaning, and the doorway should have a flap over it to keep out drafts.
 
Building a doghouse is an easy weekend project for anyone with basic 
carpentry skills; you can find plans at libraries or building-supply stores. You 
can also buy complete wooden doghouses and kits, including some that are 
extremely fancy and designed to match your home’s architecture — Cape 
Cod, Georgian, ranch style, and so on. It can be a great project for the kids to 
help with, too. Several manufacturers offer doghouses of molded, high-impact 
plastic that, in some ways, are superior to traditional wooden ones. They 
clean easily, do not retain smells, and offer no place for fleas to breed — as 
long as you keep the bedding fresh (more on bedding in the next section).
Where you place the doghouse has a lot to do with how comfortable your 
dog is when she’s in it. In winter, place it in a spot that’s protected from the 
wind. In summer, definitely place it in the shade. Obviously, finding a place 
that satisfies both criteria is preferable so that you don’t have to move it.
Indoor Comforts: Crates and Beds
Indoor dogs need a place to sleep, too. Opinions on this topic are various and 
passionate, but unless your dog has impeccable manners and respects your 
authority, he probably shouldn’t be on your bed — it gives him the wrong 
idea concerning who’s the top dog in your family. Don’t feel sorry for him, 
though: More beautiful and comfortable beds are available today than ever 
before, to fit every dog, every budget, and every decor.

Reaching for crateness
One possibility for a bed is a crate (see Figure 6-1), probably the most versatile 
piece of dog gear ever made. Once used primarily for transporting dogs on 
airplanes, the crate in all its varieties — open mesh, solid metal, or high-
impact plastic — is now widely used and recognized as one of the best tools 
for making living with your pet easier. A crate is also one of the easiest and 
fastest ways to housetrain a puppy or dog (housetraining is covered in 
Chapter 1 in Book IV), and it’s also a decent whelping box, if you ever choose 
to breed your pet. With some modifications to cut down on the drafts, it even 
makes a decent doghouse.

equipment.
 
If your dog misbehaves, the crate is a good place to put him for a “timeout.” 
If for any reason you don’t want him underfoot — a guest with allergies, a 
contractor marching in and out — the crate is a godsend. But be careful — 
don’t make him associate the crate too much with punishment.
The crate is also perfect for its original purpose: transporting your pet. A 
loose dog in the car can be an annoyance, even a danger. Everyone is safer 
when you use a crate. In an automobile accident, a loose dog is as vulnerable 
as an unbelted human. And talk about safety! Crates are tough, so much so 
that a crated dog once survived an airline crash with near-total human 
casualties. And when traveling with your pet, you’ll find that showing up with

Home a 
Dog
a crate will endear you to hotel owners, some of whom can be sweet-talked 
into lifting “no dog” rules if they know your dog will be crated in the room 
instead of chewing up the bedspread.
Dogs who are accustomed to crates love them. It’s a room of their own, cozy 
and secure, and many dogs seek out their crates voluntarily. Always-open 
crates can serve as an unconventional end table in the den, and you will often 
find your dog snoozing inside, by choice. To increase comfort, you can buy 
pads to fit the floor of crates. You can also make your own without too much 
difficulty by tucking a washable blanket inside — or you can just leave them 
empty, especially in warmer weather.
Need yet another reason to buy a crate? In times of disaster — floods, 
earthquakes, hurricanes — a crate can save your pet’s life by keeping him 
secure and providing you with alternatives if you have to evacuate your 
home. The cages of veterinary hospitals and animal shelters adjacent to a 
disaster area fill up quickly, but there’s always room for the pet who brings 
his own shelter.
Consider what you’ll be using a crate for before you buy one. If you ever 
intend to ship your dog by air, be aware that not all crates are intended for 
this purpose. Some are designed for light use — housetraining puppies in the 
home, for example — whereas others are designed for car travel, a medium-
grade use.
 
If you intend to use a crate for housetraining, as a bed, for travel, for 
occasional confinement, and possibly for a whelping box, you’re better off 
buying a top-quality crate of high-impact molded plastic, approved for air 
travel.
 
Buy a crate to fit the size your puppy will be when grown. He should be 
able to stand, turn around, and lie down comfortably. When housetraining a 
puppy, make the crate smaller by using a panel. As an alternative, borrow a 
puppy-sized crate from a friend or the puppy’s breeder.
A crate is a big-ticket item, so shop aggressively. Underutilized sources 
include garage sales and classified ads.
Letting sleeping dogs lie . . . 
in their own bed
Although a crate can be used for almost anything, it’s not the only choice 
when it comes to a bed. Dog beds keep floors and carpets cleaner, provide a 
cushion that makes all dogs more comfortable (especially older or arthritic 
ones), and allow you to live without guilt for keeping your dog off your bed.

114
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Every dog needs a bed, even if it’s just an old blanket. Two of the most 
popular varieties include
 
 Oval cuddlers designed for dogs to curl up in, lined with plush or 
polyester sheepskin
 
 Stuffed cushions that resemble 1960s beanbag chairs, albeit in more 
muted colors
 
The most important point to remember when picking out a bed (see 
Figure 6-2) is that it must be washable, or at least have a removable, washable 
cover. You’ll almost certainly have a problem with fur, smells, and fleas if you 
don’t wash pet bedding on a regular basis — weekly is ideal.

Washability is why carpet remnants are not recommended. You just can’t 
keep them fresh and clean smelling, and they’re like a welcome mat for fleas.
Some of the handsomest and sturdiest beds are available on the Web and by 
mail order, in a wider range of colors and sizes than you may be able to find 
locally. Doctors Foster and Smith, a pet-supply firm in Wisconsin, has some 
of the nicest (www.drsfostersmith.com). Another great source is L.L. 
Bean (www.LLBean.com).
You can also find great beds at dog shows, and some of these beds are only 
sold at dog shows.

Canine Tableware
In dog dishes, too, you have a lot of options, from using an old pot to buying 
a hand-thrown ceramic bowl with your dog’s name painted on it. Dishes 
designed to store up to a couple days’ worth of food or water are available, 
as are paper bowls good for one meal only (the latter most commonly used at 
boarding kennels and veterinary hospitals).
Usually the best choices are dishes of molded, high-impact plastic or stainless 
steel that resist chewing or scratching and can be sterilized in the dishwasher. 
These dishes — stainless steel, especially — retain their good looks, handle 
any abuse a dog can dish out, and last forever. Dishes that damage easily are 
hard to keep clean and invite the buildup of food and bacteria in the dents 
and scratches. Some dogs also have a sensitivity to flimsy plastic bowls.
For dogs with long, silky ears — like Cocker Spaniels — look for bowls with a 
narrow opening and high, sloped sides to keep that fur out of the food. If your 
dog is a ravenous eater, a bowl with a rubber or otherwise nonskid base will 
help keep the dish from ending up under the cabinets.
Some people are a little squeamish about putting dog dishes in the 
dishwasher, but, if your dishwasher’s doing its job right, the water will be 
hot enough to render everything in it clean enough for you to eat out of.
 
The “dog prewash” can save water and perhaps even extend the life of your 
dishwasher. Don’t allow your dog to beg while people are eating, but your 
dog can help with after-meal cleanup by licking the plates clean before you 
load them in the dishwasher.
Although you should pick up your dog’s food dishes after meals, wash them, 
and put them away, you need to keep water dishes full and available at all 
times. Here, too, stainless steel is your best choice. Dishes with reservoirs 
are fine, but they’re hard to keep clean. And unless your dog needs a lot of 
water, these products get mucky before the water needs to be refilled.
For outside water, the Lixit, available in any pet-supply store or catalog, has 
long been a popular device. Attached to an outside faucet, it releases fresh 
water when the dog licks or nuzzles the trigger, and stops the flow when the 
dog is finished. It needs to be installed in a shaded area, however, because 
the metal can become frying-pan hot if exposed to full summer sun.
All water sources need to be sheltered from both heat and freezing cold, 
or they won’t be available to your dog at all times — a potentially deadly 
situation in extreme weather. A couple blocks of ice — you can make them 
by putting water-filled margarine tubs in your freezer — will keep a shaded 
water supply cool for hours. Heated bowls are available to keep water from 
freezing, as are special devices designed to fit into buckets to do the same 
thing.

116
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
If you and your dog are constantly on the go, look into a more portable water 
source. Several different kinds of traveling bowls are designed to reduce 
splashing, and some collapsible products can be put away in a space as small 
as a fanny pack. You can also use a squeeze-type bottle like bicyclists use — 
your dog will quickly learn to catch the flow. You may want to mark it with 
indelible ink so everyone knows it’s dog water.
With a little kitchen remodeling, you can have low pull-out drawers reveal 
recessed dog dishes — stainless steel pop-outs, for easy cleaning — and 
secure storage for kibble.
Collars and Leashes
Fashion aside, collars, harnesses, halters, and leashes perform a very vital 
function: They help you train your dog and allow you to keep her out of 
trouble in public. Collars also protect your dog when you can’t, by carrying 
identification that will get her home if she ever slips away from you.
 
When buying a collar — buckled or quick-snap — for regular wear, measure 
the circumference of your dog’s neck a couple inches down from your dog’s 
head and then add 2 inches. For tiny dogs, add 1 inch. When trying on collars, 
you should be able to fit two fingers snugly between collar and neck, or one 
finger on a small dog. The goal is to have a collar snug enough so your dog 
can’t back up and out of the collar, but loose enough for comfort.
The everyday collar
A regular dog collar is an essential purchase for your dog, but if he’s 
wearing the wrong collar at the wrong time, he could end up hurt or even 
dead. Understanding some key points before you go shopping is important.
Your pet’s everyday collar, the one you put the tags on, should be a buckled 
collar, either flat or rolled, made of nylon web or leather. Either a flat collar 
or a rolled collar works fine on dogs with short or medium fur, but rolled 
collars are preferable on dogs with long, thick fur at the neck, such as Collies.

117
 Chapter 6: All the Right Stuff
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
Nylon web collars are probably to be preferred. Some dogs are more apt to 
chew off the leather collar of another family dog, but nylon is much tougher. 
Nylon collars also come in an incredible variety of colors and patterns. As 
long as the collar is well made, though, both nylon and leather will last for 
years. Quick-snap closures have become popular, especially on flat nylon 
web collars. And it’s easy to see why: Press in at the edges, and the collar’s 
off easily for baths and changing tags. Press the tips together and, snap, it’s 
on again. For most dogs, these collars present no problems. Because they are 
so simply adjusted, they’re ideal for growing puppies. Some trainers think 
buckled collars are more secure for large, strong, and impulsive dogs, but a 
high-quality quick-snap collar should be just as sturdy.
Some people may think that elegant canine collars are a recent development, 
but it’s simply not true. Owners who can afford it have always put ritzy 
collars around the necks of their prized canine companions — gold, silver, 
pearls, and gems have been part of the society dog’s wardrobe for centuries.
Some of the loveliest collars imaginable crop up in specialty Web sites, 
catalogs, and pet boutiques, for prices that would keep some dogs in kibble 
for months. Want one? If you can afford it, why not? Just make sure to make a 
matching donation to your local shelter so the guilt doesn’t get you down.
Training collars
A properly fitted buckle or quick-snap collar — with tags and a license — is 
all a puppy needs for the first few months of her life and maybe all that she 
ever needs (see Figure 6-3). But most dogs need a collar for training, or for 
you to be able to control yours better on a leash.
The most commonly used — and misused — training collar is the slip, or 
choke, collar. This collar is a length of chain — sometimes nylon — with rings 
at both ends. To use it, you drop the length of chain or nylon through the end 
(stationary) ring and then slip the resulting loop over your dog’s head. The 
leash is normally attached to the moving ring, called the live ring — not the 
stationary one, called the dead ring (see Chapter 3 in Book IV for how to train 
your dog with a training collar).

The most important cautions to know about a slip collar is that it must never, 
ever be your dog’s everyday collar, and you must always remove it when 
you’re finished training or walking your dog. The moving (live) ring of the 
collar can get caught on just about anything — even the eyetooth of another 
dog in play. When caught, a dog’s natural reaction is to pull away, a move 
that tightens the collar, which panics the dog into pulling away more. Even if 
you’re there, you may not have the strength to rescue a terrified dog in this 
situation — and even if you do have the strength, you may be badly bitten 
while trying. Many dogs have died from misuse of this common piece of 
training equipment, and near misses are even more common.
You can call it a choke collar if you want, but know this: Choke collars do 
not actually choke. If you’re choking your dog, you’re using it wrong. That’s 
not training, it’s cruelty, however unintentional. Be sure that the leash is 
attached to the moving ring on the chain, not the stationary one. The moving 
part of the training collar should go over the dog’s head, not under it. When 
positioned properly, the collar tightens when you pull on the leash and 
releases when you slack off. If the moving part of the collar is under the dog’s 
head, when you tighten, the collar tightens but doesn’t release when the 
pressure’s off.
 
How can you get it right? With the dog sitting on your left, hold the collar in a 
P shape, with the loop away from you and the bottom of the P on top. Slip it 
over your dog’s head, and it will be in perfect position.

 Chapter 6: All the Right Stuff
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
The slip collar is by far the most common collar for training and control, but 
a few others also are used:
 
 Partial slip collars can be a hybrid between a flat collar and a slip collar, 
part flat nylon, part chain, or all chain. They are designed to limit the 
choking action of a slip collar — they tighten, but only so much. Some 
trainers use them all the time; others recommend them for people who 
have an exceptionally difficult time with the release of the slip collar’s 
snap-and-release motion.
 
 Pinch or prong collars are more popular than ever because they are 
an efficient way of dealing with large dogs with especially well-muscled 
necks, like Rottweilers. As with a partial slip collar, they can be tightened 
only so far, but, unlike the partial, they have blunt metal prongs evenly 
spaced along the inside of the length of the collar. When the collar 
tightens, these blunt prongs press firmly — but not cruelly — into the 
flesh of the dog’s neck.
 
 These collars are very controversial, in part because of their cruel 
appearance, which is probably why some people like them: They look 
macho. Pinch collars should not be a first-choice training collar, but in 
the hands of a knowledgeable trainer, they can help with a powerful dog.
 
 Head halters are another device with a public-relations problem, this 
time completely unwarranted. The problem: They look like muzzles. In 
fact, they operate on the same principle that has worked for years with 
horses: Where the head goes, the body follows. The leash is attached 
to a ring under the jaw, and when pulled, pressure is placed around the 
muzzle and around the neck — both important in canine body language.
 
 Properly fitted and used, a head halter can make even a large, powerful 
dog controllable enough to be walked by a child — but, then, so can a 
proper course of training.
 
 Electric collars give a shock either automatically, such as when a dog 
barks, or manually, at the push of a button. They are widely used in 
training dogs for hunting and field work, and for correcting some serious 
behavior problems. Although electric collars are widely available in 
pet-supply stores and catalogs, pet owners should use them only with 
the guidance of experienced trainers. Without a thorough knowledge of 
training theory and a perfect sense of timing, this training tool is more 
cruel than effective.
 
 Harnesses for walking a dog are best left on little dogs because they 
offer nothing in the way of control and give up a great deal in the way of 
leverage. Some small breeds — such as Toy Poodles — have a tendency 
toward collapsing tracheas, in which the rings of cartilage in the neck 
collapse temporarily when the dog gets excited. These dogs are ideal 
candidates for harnesses, to relieve the pressure on their necks from 
pulling. (Again, you can train your dog not to pull, but people with tiny 
breeds don’t really have to, so they rarely do.)

120
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
 
 Your veterinarian may suggest a harness if your dog is of a breed known 
for neck or back problems, or if your dog has had a neck trauma or surgery.
 
 A couple harnesses on the market do offer some control, tightening 
around the dog’s chest as he pulls. These harnesses are an option even 
for larger dogs.
 
 Some harnesses are made for dog sports — for tracking or for pulling 
sleds or wagons.
ID tags and microchips
Your young daughter leaves the front door 
open, or the wind blows down the fence: A 
lost dog can happen to the most conscientious 
of families. For this reason, your dog’s collar 
should have tags.
A dog’s collar should always have an ID 
tag with your phone number, and a rabies 
vaccination tag from your vet. When you move, 
get a new ID tag first thing. Also check the 
tags frequently, to ensure that the information 
is still readable. Even better is to subscribe 
to a 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week tracking 
service, like 1-800-HELP4PETS, which not only 
reunites you with your dog if she becomes lost, 
but also arranges for boarding or medical care 
if you cannot be immediately found.
You can ID your dog in other ways, of 
course. Tattooing, with your driver’s license 
number or another traceable number (like a 
registry number from the American or 
Canadian Kennel Clubs) has been popular for 
years. Microchipping has come on strong in 
the last decade. The microchip is permanent 
identification no bigger than a grain of rice. 
Your veterinarian embeds the microchip under 
the skin over your pet’s shoulder blades, using a 
large needle. (But don’t worry: One yip is about 
all you’ll hear, and then it’s done.)
Microchips used to be of dubious value for 
returning lost pets, because one company’s 
chips couldn’t be read by another company’s 
scanner, and shelters couldn’t (and wouldn’t) 
cope with competing systems. That has 
changed, with manufacturers moving toward 
one industry standard and with the entry of 
the American Kennel Club as a registry of 
microchipped animals in the United States 
and Canada — for any animals, not just AKC-
registered purebred dogs. Having your pet 
chipped by your veterinarian costs anything 
from $40 to $100, but it’s a good investment in 
your dog’s safety.
If you’re planning to have your canine companion 
microchipped, find out what, if any, chip 
scanners the shelters in your area use, and 
make sure that your pet is implanted with 
a chip that can be read by using that brand 
of scanner. Also register your pet with AKC 
Companion Animal Recovery (800-252-7894), 
which offers 24-hour match-up service, 365 
days a year. Although the service was set up in 
conjunction with one manufacturer, you can 
register the number of any chip — or tattoo — 
you use. If someone calls to report finding your 
pet, the service will release your number so you 
can be reunited quickly.

Leashes
Choices aren’t as varied in leashes (also called leads) as in collars. You can 
find a lot more colors and designs these days, but the same basic choices 
remain: leather, nylon, or chain.
You can use anything you want when your dog is trained, but until you reach 
that point, the standard 6-foot leather leash is your best choice. Nylon is a 
very close second, but it’s not as easy to grip as leather and can give you 
burns if your dog takes off suddenly and whips the leash through your hands.
 
Chain is horrible to train with: It’ll cut your hands to pieces, and your dog 
will confuse the noise of the leash with the noise of the collar.
Several lengths are available, from a 1-foot traffic lead that’s useful for 
moving a large dog quickly from one place to another, to long leads for 
training or to give a dog a little more room to roam without unleashing him. 
For walking or training, the 6-foot lead is still best: It lets you give your dog 
some freedom while still giving you plenty of control. It’s also the length 
spelled out in most leash laws.
Leashes are sold in 1⁄4-inch, 3/8-inch, 1/2-inch, 5/8-inch, 3/4-inch, and 1-inch 
widths, with the two middle sizes the most commonly used in obedience 
training because they’re easier to grip than the other sizes. The weakest 
parts of a leash are where the snap attaches and the handle is formed. Look 
for sturdy stitching or, in leather leads, one-piece construction.
One of the most popular leashes is the reel-type flexible extension-type lead 
that offers a dog up to 32 feet of freedom, yet allows the owner to stop it from 
extending by pressing a button on the plastic handle. Although it’s not meant 
to help you teach dogs to walk without pulling, owners commonly use it to 
teach dogs to come when called. This type of leash is great for travel, too, 
and for dogs who can’t be trusted off-leash but still need to stretch their legs.
These leads, widely available in different sizes and lengths, are wonderful 
for letting a dog sniff around in areas where it’s not safe or where you’re not 
allowed to let her off-leash. “Flexis” aren’t designed to give you control over 
your dog, especially if he’s large and strong. It’s easy to lose your grip if the 
dog hits the end of the line running. For these reasons, don’t use a flexible 
lead in areas where it would be dangerous if your dog got loose.

The Wonderful World of Toys
Every dog needs toys. They keep your pet occupied and amused when you 
cannot, and they provide you with another avenue for interacting and 
bonding. Toys give your pet something to chew on besides your toes (or 
shoes, furniture, or books), and they are absolutely essential to puppy 
raising, because puppies feel better when their teeth are cutting through. Of 
course, toys are also fun to choose and buy. A couple cautions in the toy area 
are warranted, but not many.
Chewies
The kind of chewie toys you buy has everything to do with the size of your 
dog and how aggressive a chewer she is. Some of the toughest chew toys on 
the market are made by Nylabone, in a variety of sizes, shapes, and colors.
The king of chew toys is the Kong, a hard rubber toy that looks a little like 
the Michelin Tire man. Kongs have hollow centers that you can fill with 
peanut butter or another kind of treat, which gives dogs plenty of interesting 
activity as they try to get all the treat material out. Not only are Kongs 
almost impossible to destroy, but they also bounce in a sprightly manner, in 
unpredictable directions.
Chewies designed to remove plaque and stimulate gums are also popular. 
They have nubs along their length, or indentations designed to be filled with 
canine toothpaste.
Rope chews — some of them adorned with hooves at the ends or rubber 
balls in the middle — are popular, but some trainers think they’re too much 
like things you don’t want your pet to chew on, like carpet fringes and 
curtains.
 
Monitor your pet’s chew toys. When they’re worn or chewed to the point 
they can be swallowed, replace them.
Squeakies
Puppies and dogs alike love toys of either plush or vinyl that make a noise 
when squeezed. However, they can turn into a very expensive proposition if 
you own a dog who isn’t happy until the squeaker is dead. 
 
One of the nicest and sturdiest plush toys is the Vermont Chewman, solidly 
made of thick, fake lambskin and available in catalogs and pet-supply stores.

Fetchies
Fetch is an outstanding way to exercise your dog while reminding him of your 
role as pack leader. Many people use flying discs for this sport, and although 
it’s great fun, be aware that some dogs have been injured while leaping after 
flying disks, to the point of needing surgery on their knees and backs.
 
Tennis balls are another common toy with built-in risks. It may seem safe, but 
never let your dog chew on a tennis ball or play with one unattended. Some 
dogs have died after a tennis ball, compressed by powerful jaws, popped into 
the throat and cut off the air supply.
Does that mean you should avoid playing with flying discs or tennis balls? 
No, but use some common sense. With flying discs, avoid the acrobatics that 
wow spectators at half-time shows but have your dog leaping, twisting, and 
landing hard. Work on low throws in front of your dog, to encourage him to 
run but not to jump. And use floppy ones made of fabric or rubber, not plastic. 
Tennis balls are fine for fetch, but put them away when the game’s over.
You can, of course, buy solid rubber balls. And for water retrieving — a great 
exercise for the dog who enjoys swimming — Kong makes a floating variety 
with a rope handle that’s easy to throw a long way on land or in water.
 
If you buy a toy that invites tug-of-war games, it’s fine to let your pet pull 
against another dog. But never play tug of -war with your dog, and make sure 
that your children don’t, either. What seems like an innocent game could be 
a setup for tragedy. Tug of war can teach your dog to be dominant. Consider 
this scenario: You play with your dog, pulling against her in a battle of 
dominance, however playful in appearance. You get bored, the phone rings, 
and you drop your end. You think: Game’s over. Your dog thinks: I win — 
exactly the opposite of the message your dog should get, and one that may 
lead to other dominance challenges.
Green Dog Accessories
These days, more people are going green when it comes to food, cars, 
clothing, and even beauty products. We’re also beginning to understand the 
benefits of choosing products that have a lower impact on the environment. 
So if organic foods and chemical-free shampoos are healthier for us, why 
shouldn’t we try to provide the same for our dogs? Fortunately, you don’t 
have to look very hard to find green pet products in the marketplace. Internet 
and specialty shops abound, and many conventional pet supply stores have a 
selection of eco-friendly products.

124
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
You’ll likely come across the following hot topics in your eco-quest:
 
 Organic: Foods, textiles, and other products that are organic are 
considered better for our bodies and for the planet because they are 
grown or raised without synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, chemicals, or 
hormones.
 
 Sustainable: Reducing our impact on the earth’s resources is the main 
idea behind sustainability. As a dog owner, you can make lifestyle and 
consumer choices to limit your use of resources.
 
 Recycled: The mantra “Reduce, reuse, and recycle” applies to pets, 
too. Pet toys, beds, and other items can be manufactured from recycled 
products, reducing the load on landfills.
So save the planet and start shopping — and be sure to bring your canvas 
shopping bags.
Bedding with eco-benefits
Dogs may be Man’s best friend, but few bonds are stronger than the one 
between a dog and his bed. Given how many hours a dog will spend sleeping, 
comfort is a key factor. For eco-minded owners, however, comfort is only one 
consideration when choosing a bed.
A growing number of manufacturers now produce environmentally friendly 
beds for pets. Whether it’s a cuddler, cushion, blanket, or sleeping mat, these 
cozy products are made with your pet’s and the planet’s health in mind. 
People who lean toward the green side of dog ownership can choose from 
washable covers of naturally dyed organic cotton and hemp, as well as 
recycled fabrics. You’ll rest easy knowing your beloved dog has a chemical-
free spot for snoozing. Think eco can’t be stylish? Think again. You can find 
colorful, classic, and hip designs for these earth-friendly beds.
To keep your puppy properly cushioned, many green beds are packed with 
soft and durable IntelliLoft stuffing, made of 100 percent shredded recycled 
plastic bottles. How’s that for eco-friendly?
Toys you can be proud of
Toys are great fun, especially when they’re made of materials that won’t 
harm your pet. To make playtime a safe time for your pet, consider toys that 
are free of pesticides and chemicals.

 Plush toys: Look for organic fabrics and recycled stuffings such as 
IntelliLoft; natural dyes are also good.
 
 Chew and fetch toys: Seek out lead-free and latex-free chewies; toys 
made from nontoxic Zogoflex are supertough, buoyant, and pliable, and 
are designed to be recycled. Instead of spending money on average toys, 
choose durable, natural rubber toys that can stand up to serious play.
Eco-leashes and collars
So you want to spread the good news about being an environmentally 
responsible dog owner? Well, put on your pup’s eco-friendly collar and leash, 
and go for a walk. While you’re out strolling, you can explain to your friends 
and neighbors that most pet collars are made of nylon, a product of petroleum. 
Explain that both your dog and the environment benefit when you choose to 
buy collars, leashes, and harnesses made of durable natural fibers like hemp, 
cotton, grosgrain ribbon, and leather. Mention that these earth-friendly 
accessories come in an impressive variety of colors and designs.
Green duds
If you’re an environmentalist who’s into canine fashion, you’re in luck. You 
should have no problem finding doggie duds made from natural materials 
and fibers. Shop for earth-friendly sweaters, coats, hoodies, and rain gear 
designed with your style in mind.
Green suds
At some point, your pooch will need some primping, and now you can tackle 
your grooming tasks with an arsenal of effective green products. From 
shampoos to sprays, you’ll find a wide range of canine beauty supplies that 
are natural, gentle, hypoallergenic, and biodegradable; look for products 
without alcohol, artificial dyes, sulfates, chemicals, detergents, or harsh 
fragrances.
When it’s your house that’s a mess and not your pet, take care of the problem 
with eco-friendly cleaners and stain and odor removers; they do the job 
without leaving harmful chemicals behind. As an added benefit, many of 
these products come in recycled packaging.

Roommate’s View of the World
In This Chapter
 Previewing the stages of dog development

 Communicating by using the language of a pup
 Establishing who’s in charge of the household
 Discovering how to train your puppy from his perspective
 Comparing hierarchy to democracy
T
he greatest gift you can give your dog is a stress-free existence. Structure 
your dog’s world so that he feels safe. Provide for his needs, anticipating 
them before he does, and incorporate as much playtime into your daily routine 
as you can. A young puppy doesn’t understand the word “no” or develop 
impulse control before he’s 6 to 8 months old, so put your expectations and 
frustrations on the back burner until you can channel both into useful 
communication. Puppyhood, like childhood, is short — let your puppy enjoy 
his to the fullest.
You have to understand the world from a dog’s perspective. Though his 
curiosity may result in behaviors that you find aggravating, don’t take any of 
his antics personally. Getting angry at a new dog is as silly and ineffective as 
yelling at a 6-month-old child. Not only will you not get through to him, but 
you’ll also frighten him. You, the very person he should feel most safe turning 
to, will be scaring and confusing him. This routine is neither educational nor 
good for long-term bonding. Look for a better way to navigate through this 
time — a much better way.
In this chapter, you put yourself in your dog’s paws and understand just how 
he views your world and life together.
 
Because most adopted dogs are puppies, this chapter puts a lot of emphasis 
on puppies, but you’ll find useful information about older dogs as well.

Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Recognizing the Eight Stages 
of Dog Development
You may be dreaming of an agility champion, but setting your dog on 
course before she’s housetrained is like pressuring a toddler to balance 
your checkbook. As with children, your puppy’s mind will develop along a 
predictable course; you have to be patient. Knowing this fact helps you 
understand what to expect, what to teach your puppy, and what milestones 
will define your expectations and bolster your success.
Infancy (8 to 12 weeks)
Life for a young puppy centers on five basic needs: eating, drinking, sleeping, 
eliminating, and playing. Even though your puppy is capable of learning, 
don’t expect too much at this stage. You should be feeding your puppy three 
to four times a day, taking him out constantly, and letting him sleep when he 
wants to. Your puppy will learn best when you incorporate training into 
playtime. Show him the basic stuff: Hang out with him, use his name, talk to 
him, and introduce the leash. Discipline will only frighten your puppy and 
erode your relationship: He’s simply too young to comprehend it. Have fun 
and take lots of photos, because your puppy will be all grown up before you 
know it.
The terrible twos (12 to 16 weeks)
As your puppy matures, you’ll notice her personality developing. She’ll get a 
bit bolder and braver and harder to impress. By 12 weeks, a puppy’s brain is 
fully developed and she’s ready to learn. She’s old enough to understand and 
remember your direction, but she’s still too young to take matters into her 
own paws.
 
Puppies at this stage are starting to learn things, whether they’re guided or 
not. If you don’t train your puppy, she’ll train you.
The budding adolescent (16 to 24 weeks)
Suddenly, you may notice that a strange dog, who looks rather like your 
puppy did, is taking over your house. Welcome to adolescence. Be prepared 
and consider yourself warned: You’re about to enter the bratty zone. Try not 
to panic — as much as you may want to hide under the couch for the next 
three months, don’t! Now is the best time to start training. Because this stage

 Chapter 7: Understanding Your New Roommate’s View of the World
Book I

and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
lasts about eight weeks, break down lessons week by week. Breaking down 
lessons helps your puppy feel successful and allows him to master each 
exercise before you apply it in his day-to-day world. This concept is similar to 
letting children master the alphabet before expecting them to spell.
Puppy puberty (6 to 9 months)
Puppies at this stage go through a major transformation called growing up. 
You remember growing up, don’t you? With all its hormones, rebellion, 
confusion, and curiosity? Well, it’s never a pretty sight. On top of these 
typical growing pains is the awakening of breed-specific instincts that tell 
herders to herd, hunters to hunt, guarders to guard, and pullers to pull. This 
stage is utter canine chaos, and all while they’re still cutting their baby teeth! 
You now have this puppy/dog who’s full of hormones, high spirits, and 
anxiety. It’s no wonder she may give you the puppy equivalent of a teenage 
eye roll when you give her a command.
The trying teen (9 to 12 months)
Your first milestone is in front of you, but it’s not over yet. A puppy at this 
stage usually calms down and manages better on his own. He’ll chew his 
bone quietly, potty where he ought to, and listen most of the time. Okay, 
sometimes he’ll still ignore you. Puppies at this stage want to behave, but 
their teenage genes are relentlessly telling them to make one more glorious 
attempt for Top Dog status.
 
This stage often brings with it a subtle campaign of defiance. You may not 
think a sloppy, sideways sit is a very big deal, but your dog makes a little 
mental check mark every time you let him get away with something. You 
can’t relax your efforts just yet!
The young adult (12 to 24 months)
At this age, your dog begins to hit her stride. If a dog isn’t spayed or neutered 
by now, this time is when the breeding age begins. The puppy personality is 
gone, replaced by a (hopefully) calmer manner and more stable, predictable 
personality.
Or not. About the time a pup reaches physical maturity is also when many 
owners first realize they’ve taken on more than they can handle and recognize 
that they ended up with a dog who’s too big, too active, or too dominant for 
them. Puppies grow up fast, and too many people put off until tomorrow the 
socializing and training they should have done yesterday. These birds now 

130
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
come home to roost. However, lots of these overgrown puppies just need a 
little work — some basic obedience and problem.
All young adults are bound to be a little more high spirited and distractible 
than a mature adult of 2 or more. These dogs still have a bit of growing up 
to do.
The adult dog (2 to 8 years)
This is it, the long stretch of time you will remember best when you reflect 
years hence. Dogs who mature into adulthood are in their prime years. If 
all has gone well, you have a nearly flawless dog here, calm and sensible, 
benefiting from that obedience training you instilled. Of course, you may also 
have a dog who’s settled into some bad habits. Of course, he couldn’t have 
gotten that from you, right?
The senior dog (8 years and older)
Depending on the breed, these years will be either a slow process of dignified 
deterioration or a rapid slide into old age. Of course it’s sad to see dogs age, 
as it’s sad to see humans age. Senior dogs are troopers, though. Older dogs 
are more docile and less destructive, and require less exercise than young 
ones. They are often wise and quiet, and can seem downright philosophical. 
A senior dog reminds you every day how loyal your friend has been for so 
long. Sure, she needs more loving care than ever, and health problems 
escalate, but you will be glad to give it in return for the affection you’ve 
received all this time.
Understanding Your Puppy’s 
Basic Needs
 
Your puppy is a lot like a human baby. Okay, sure, your pup may have a 
furry coat, a curly tail, and a full set of teeth, but many of the differences 
stop there. Like a child, your puppy has basic needs and an instinct to 
satisfy them. A baby communicates his helpless neediness through crying. 
It’s a guardian’s role to interpret the cry and satisfy the need. In essence, a 
cry indicates that the baby lacks the ability to associate a specific need with 
a bodily sensation. When he’s hungry, his belly hurts. When he’s tired, his 
brain shuts down. When he’s thirsty, his throat constricts. If these needs 
aren’t satisfied, he gets anxious. When a loving caregiver routinely satisfies 

131
 Chapter 7: Understanding Your New Roommate’s View of the World
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
his needs, without stress, discipline, or confusion, he develops a strong bond 
with that person.
The same holds true for puppies. Like babies, they have five basic needs: eat, 
drink, sleep, potty, and play. Unlike babies, many puppies don’t cry when 
their needs aren’t met. Instead, they start nipping and, if directed, may bark 
and become frantic and fidgety. The behaviors are different, but the concept 
is the same. Both are easily overwhelmed when their bodies make demands. 
If initial nips are met with harsh discipline, the puppy may develop defense 
reactions, such as aggression or barking back.
 
You can help your puppy identify his needs by pairing directions with 
routines. Whereas a child develops language and a more civilized approach 
to communicating her requests, your puppy will develop his own system of 
communicating by prompting the routine. Read about puppy needs in the 
upcoming sections, and use Table 7-1 to create your own routines — your 
puppy will be ringing the bell to go outside in no time!
 
Whoever satisfies a need is held in high regard. Though it may take some 
time for your puppy to “pay you back” with his love and devotion, each 
passing day brings you closer to that ultimate connection. Need by need, 
your bond will grow.

Eating
Puppies are happiest when a predictable routine has been set. A hungry 
puppy is understandably upset and may show you by eating anything — 
even the difficult-to-digest things such as tissues, remote controls, or walls. 
Schedule feeding times and stick to them as closely as possible. If you notice 
your puppy getting nippy or difficult, check your watch. The behavior could 
be a result of hunger tension. See Table 7-2 for guidance when setting up 
feeding times.

A young puppy has a high metabolism and should have more frequent meals. 
Schedule three to four meals throughout the day, slowly phasing out meals 
as your puppy matures. At some point after your puppy reaches 6 months, 
you may drop to one meal.
 
Whoever feeds your puppy should follow the same organized routine that 
you do. Puppies (like kids) are happiest when they know exactly what will 
happen next.
Drinking
Puppies need a lot of water, especially when the weather is hot or when 
chewing and playing. Even though it’s important to allow them access to 
water when their system demands it, it’s equally important to monitor their 
drinking habits. Bladder muscles are the last to develop, so what goes in, 
comes out quickly. Dogs can hold their urine for a long time — puppies can’t.
 
Establish a drinking station for your puppy and keep her dish there whether 
it’s empty or full. Give your puppy water with her meals; after playing, 
chewing, or napping; or as you’re on your way to her potty area.

133
 Chapter 7: Understanding Your New Roommate’s View of the World
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
If you’re forgetful, it’s better to fill his dish and leave it out for her throughout 
the day. Though it may delay your housetraining, it’s better than having her 
go thirsty.
 
Restrict water after 7:30 p.m., unless you want to be up all night taking your 
puppy outside. If your puppy clearly needs a drink, either give her a small 
amount (no more than a cup for a large dog or a quarter cup for a small fry) 
or offer a couple ice cubes.
Sleeping
We all love a good sleep, and you’ll find that your puppy is no exception. 
Create a quiet space where your puppy can escape the daily hubbub and 
catch 40 winks whenever he needs too. Make it clear to friends and family 
that this area — perhaps a crate, bed, room, or pen — is off limits to people 
when your puppy needs to nap. An overtired puppy is impossible to deal 
with. Like a child, a puppy will simply melt down. In fact, when pushed, his 
mouthy, testy behavior may turn into snappy aggression. Don’t correct, 
worry, or admonish him. Have pity instead — he’s exhausted.
 
Like kids, some puppies have a hard time putting themselves to sleep, 
especially when excitement levels are high. If you have kids, ask them to 
baby him by staying quiet until he’s sleeping. Each time he seems tired, 
escort him to his resting area while saying a cue word like “Bed.” Eventually, 
he’ll go to this area on his own when he’s tired.
Going potty
Housetraining can’t be summed up any better than with the wonderful 
maxim, “Whatever goes in must come out.” Your puppy’s biological clock will 
have her eliminating on demand. When her bladder or bowels are pressed, 
she’ll let loose whether she’s outside or on the papers — or on the rug, if 
you’re not watching.
If your puppy is coming straight from Mom, she may have paved the way 
for you by urging her puppy to leave the “nest” when eliminating. This stage 
occurs between 7 and 8 weeks. If Mom was too relaxed or you picked up your 
puppy before this stage, the puppy will rely on you to clean up after her, a 
message of total care and devotion.
Your goals are to teach your puppy where to go and how to let you know if 
an obstacle (such as a door) is stopping her from getting there. Fortunately, 
you’ll find this task easy after you commit to a routine and relax your 
expectations. Tension or expressed frustration is confusing; your puppy 

134
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
won’t learn quickly and may grow increasingly afraid of you. Your puppy 
needs a schedule, a routine, and a consistent pattern — all of which are 
within your grasp.
 
For a lot more on housetraining, see Book IV, Chapter 1.
Playing
The urge to play and express himself energetically is one of the most natural 
responses in your puppy’s repertoire. As with children, play and lighthearted 
interactions can be fabulous instructional tools and can be used exclusively 
during your first few months together.
 
How you play with your young puppy determines your long-term relationship. 
Rough, confrontational games, such as wrestling or tug of war, communicate 
confrontation, which can be detrimental to your relationship. A confronted 
puppy will be more likely to challenge you and ignore your direction. Games 
such as the two-ball toss, soccer, and name games instill cooperation and a 
fun-loving attitude — this puppy won’t ever want to leave your side.
Speaking Doglish and Presenting 
Yourself As Top Dog
Dogs have a lot of team spirit. Many people refer to this as their pack instinct, 
but the concept of teams also works. Team consciousness and the canine 
psyche have a lot in common. Teams focus on winning, with each player 
working for it, wanting it, thinking about it, and striving for it. Dogs live their 
entire lives, every waking moment, by this same team structure. Instead of 
“winning,” however, their mantra is bonding and survival. To your dog, you 
and your family are her team.
Some other, less obvious factors also determine a team’s success: cooperation, 
structure, and mutual respect. Without these factors, even a group of 
phenomenal players would produce only chaos. A good team is organized so 
that all members know who’s in charge and what’s expected of each of them. 
And if one of them gets in trouble or gets hurt, that member can trust that 
another teammate will help out.
For your dog to feel secure and safe, she needs to know who’s in charge, and 
it’s your job to teach her what you expect. In dog land, teams are organized 
in a hierarchy, so you must teach your four-legged friend that two-legged 
team members are the ones in charge — the captains of the team. If you have 
more than one person in your household, teaching this concept requires 

135
 Chapter 7: Understanding Your New Roommate’s View of the World
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
some cooperation on everyone’s part, but it’s important if you want your 
puppy to mature into a dog who respects everybody.
 
If you don’t organize the team hierarchy, your dog will, and that can be a real 
nightmare. If your dog has the personality to lead, you’ll find yourself living 
in a very expensive doghouse under dog rule. If your dog doesn’t have the 
personality to lead but feels like she has to because no one else is, you’ll end 
up with perhaps an even bigger headache, because dogs in this state are very 
hyper and confused.
So how do you organize your team and teach your dog the rules? You have to 
understand what motivates your dog’s behavior, and you have to master her 
communication skills. But you have one small problem: Your puppy doesn’t 
understand English. Like a human plopped into a foreign country where no 
one speaks her language, your puppy will feel lost in translation. To be the 
best teacher, you need to be fluent in Doglish, the language of dogs. Give your 
family or friends a lesson, too, and encourage consistency.
Doglish consists of three elements:
 
 Eye contact
 
 Body language
 
 Tone
In Doglish, words, feelings, and lengthy explanations don’t count. Complex 
reasoning in English is impossible for your puppy to follow. The following 
sections break down the three elements of Doglish so that you can put them 
into practice ASAP.
 
Figuring out Doglish may seem like hard work, but watching the techniques 
in action is quite fascinating. Your dog will respond to you more willingly 
if you make the effort to understand and use her language. With an ounce 
of effort, a little time, and some structure, you can earn your dog’s respect, 
cooperation, and trust. Plus, you’ll have a teammate who will be at your side 
when the cards are down. You can’t beat that bargain.
Eye contact: Attention = affirmation
Are you constantly making eye contact with your dog in stressful situations 
(someone’s at the door and he’s barking like a madman, or maybe he’s 
stealing the dishrag)? Are you having trouble encouraging your pup to pay 
attention to you? Well, guess what? By making constant eye contact, your 
dog thinks you’re depending on him to be the leader. He thinks you want him 
to make all the judgment calls. Before you can figure out how to handle 
these situations, you have to understand that, to train your dog, you must 
encourage him to look to you for direction.

136
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
 
When you make eye contact with your dog, you reinforce whatever behavior 
he’s actively engaged in. Look your well-behaved dog in the eye and guess 
what you get? You got it: a well-behaved dog. However, if you make eye 
contact while he’s running around the house with a wet wash rag flopping 
from his mouth, you’ll reinforce that behavior because you’re giving him the 
attention he so desperately wants. He wants you to look at him, so if you do 
so while he’s eating your favorite album, he learns to do that.
Think of your dog’s energy on a scale from 1 to 10, with 1 being sleep and 10 
being hyperexcited play. Between 2 and 8 is the focused, civil, happy zone, 
which includes all the endearing behaviors you love, such as relaxing during 
a heartfelt pat, bringing a toy to you for play, and chewing on a bone while 
you’re busy. Between 8 and 10 is the impulsive, unfocused zone, which 
contains all the behaviors that drive you crazy. Some of these behaviors 
include jumping, stealing, nipping, and running out of control.
By realizing that dogs repeat behaviors that result in attention, you can see 
that you get what you interact with. By redirecting wild energy and focusing on 
the good stuff, you know what you get? A perfect little angel. (Well, almost.)
 
The bottom line is this: Make eye contact only when your dog is calm (in the 
1–8 zone).
Believe it or not, the 8–10 zone is no picnic for your canine, either. Even 
though he’s rowdy and unfocused, this manic behavior is only a simple 
reaction to his misunderstanding of what you expect. Unfortunately, discipline 
doesn’t help this situation because your dog may interpret it as confrontational 
play. Structure, positive reinforcement, and training help the most. (See Book 
IV, Chapters 2 and 3 for more on training.)
Body language: Stand up and stay calm
Body language is a funny thing. Imagine this: Your dog becomes excited and 
hyper when company arrives at the front door. Desperate to save face, you 
start shouting and pushing your dog as the company fends the two of you off 
with their coats. You try every possible command — “Sit, Boomer! Down! Off! 
Bad dog!” — but to no avail. The whole arrival scene is one big fiasco.
 
Body language is an integral part of Doglish. Play, tension, relaxation — they 
all have different postures. Your dog doesn’t quite grasp the “I’m pushing you 
frantically because I’m unhappy with your greeting manners” concept. By 
dealing with the situation in this way, you’re communicating differently than 
you think you are. In fact, by pushing and shouting, you’re actually copying 
her body language, which reinforces her behavior.

As you blaze the training trail, remember these guidelines:
 
 Stand upright and relax when directing your dog. When giving your 
puppy direction or a command, throw your shoulders back and stand 
tall like a peacock. Tell your family and friends about this peacock 
position, and start strutting your stuff.
 
 Don’t face off or chase your puppy when you’re mad. She’ll only think 
you’re playing.
 
 When you’re trying to quiet or direct your puppy, stay calm.
 
 Always remember that you set the example.
 
Can you ever get down and play or cuddle with your puppy or dog? Of course 
you can! Just don’t play with your puppy when she’s in a mischievous mood, 
or you’re asking for trouble.
Tone: Using the three D’s
If your dog thinks of you as another dog and you start yelling, he hears 
barking. Barking (yelling) interrupts behavior; it doesn’t instruct. It also 
increases excitement. You may have a puppy who backs off from a situation 
when you yell (although he’ll probably repeat the same behavior later). He’s 
backing off because your yelling frightens him, not because he understands 
what you’re yelling about. Yelling is just no good.
 
Commit three tones to memory — the three D’s:
 
 Delighted: Use this tone when you want to praise your dog. It should 
soothe him, not excite him. Find a tone that makes your pup feel warm 
and proud inside.
 
 Directive: Use this tone for your commands. It should be clear and 
authoritative, not harsh or sweet. Give your commands once from the 
Peacock Position.
 
 If you bend over when giving your dog a command, don’t be surprised if 
he doesn’t listen. You’re doing the doggy equivalent of a play bow, which 
is a posture that invites a game. When giving your dog directions, stand 
tall and proud like a peacock.
 
 Discipline: You may not be much of a disciplinarian, but you should 
have a few tones that tell your dog to back off or move on. The word you 
use doesn’t matter as much as the tone. The tone should be shaming 
or disapproving, such as “How could you?” or “You’d better not touch 
that.” Discipline has to do with timing and tone.

138
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
 
Don’t repeat your commands. Saying “Sit, sit, sit, Boomer, sit! Sit! Sit!” sounds 
different from “Sit” — which is what Boomer is used to. If you want your dog 
to listen when you give the first command, make sure that you give it only 
once; then reinforce your expectations by positioning your dog. (When 
positioning in a sit, remember to gently squeeze the waist muscles and lift 
up on your dog’s collar.)
Gimme, Gimme, Gimme: Puppies 
Want All the Attention
 
Imagine being a puppy, with humans just being big dogs milling all about, 
jabbering away in some nonsensical language, and providing virtually no 
instruction on what to do. When you lay a head in their lap or paw at them 
inquisitively, the human may shoo you off or lay a warm hand on your head, 
while often continuing to ignore your request for direction. The talking box 
on the wall and hand-held objects hold more interest for the humans than 
your interaction does. You hear noise and more noise. You catch sniffs that 
can’t be explored or trailed. And you see sights that you’re expected to 
ignore. Being a puppy in a human’s world can be tough.
The power of positive attention
What do you do when you catch your puppy resting or chewing a bone 
quietly? “Nothing. It’s a moment of peace.” Well, it’s those times when you 
ought to be showering your puppy with attention. Not wild, twist-and-shout, 
hoot-and-holler attention, but calm, soothing, loving attention. A soft, 
whispering praise is best mixed with a massagelike pat.
Teaching kids how to use the proper tone
If you have kids, you’ve probably noticed that 
sometimes they call out to the puppy in a very 
high-pitched tone, and sometimes they don’t 
pronounce commands properly, either.
Until kids are 12 years old, you’re better off 
focusing on what they’re doing right rather 
than homing in on their imperfections. Simply 
overenunciate all your commands so that the 
kids figure out how to pronounce them properly 
and in an appropriate tone. If you overenunciate 
each command, your kids will notice the effects 
and start mimicking you. And when your kids 
copy your intonations, they transfer the control 
from you to them.

Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
 
Your dog will repeat whatever action you pay attention to.
 
Dogs are drawn to positive energy fields. Think of yourself as her teacher and 
mentor. If you keep up the cheer, your dog won’t want to be anywhere else.
Why negative attention doesn’t work
Picture a very excited, jumping dog. You’re trying to read the newspaper calmly, 
but he wants your attention. What do you think would happen if you tried to 
correct the dog by pushing him down and screaming “Off!”? In all likelihood, the 
dog would jump again. Do you know why? Because you just gave him attention. 
Attention, in a dog’s mind, includes anything from dramatic body contact to a 
simple glance. Yes, even looking at your dog reinforces his behavior.
Though this phenomenon may sound far fetched at first, it’s actually pretty 
elementary. Dogs think of you as another dog — really. Maybe a funny-looking 
dog with godlike powers, but a dog nonetheless. If they get excited and then 
you get excited, they think you’re following their lead. By mimicking their 
energy level, you communicate that they must interpret new situations. The 
fact that you’re upset with their behavior just doesn’t register. Being upset is a 
human emotion. Excitement and body contact is the dog way. Even if you push 
your dog so hard that he stops and slinks away, your only accomplishment is 
scaring him. And who wants to train a pup through fear? You have a better way.
Consider another example: What happens if your dog grabs a sock and 
everyone in the household stops to chase him? Think you have a dog party? 
You bet. The dog is thinking “What fun!” as he dives behind the couch and 
under the table. Chasing a dog doesn’t come across as discipline; it comes 
across as prize envy — “Whatever I have must be really good because 
everyone wants it!”
 
Dogs often interpret negative attention as confrontational play: “You’re 
animated, you’re loud, and you’re fierce. Let’s play rough!” Out-of-control 
negative attention reinforces the very behavior you’re trying to change. To 
resolve these problems, be patient and read on.
Showing Your Pup How to 
Live in a Human World
If this training isn’t coming naturally to you, don’t be discouraged. To be a 
schoolteacher for children, you’d have to enroll in four to six years of college 
education. However, to teach your puppy, you only need to understand the 
concepts and exercises outlined in this book.

140
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
 
A lot goes into being a good dog trainer, and most of it’s mental. Dogs, like 
humans, have spirits that you must understand and encourage in ways that 
make sense to the dog. Your dog has bestowed on you the highest honor, 
and it’s one you’d never receive from a human: a lifetime commitment to 
respect your judgment and abide by your rules. You need only show her 
how.
To show your dog how to respect you and your rules, remember three key 
points that a good dog trainer does:
 
 Accepts and modifies his own personality
 
 Never blames the pup
 
 Recognizes the pup’s unique personality
Recognize and modify your personality
Now’s the time to analyze yourself. Take out a pen and paper, and write down 
three adjectives to describe your personality. What kind of person are you? 
Demanding? Sweet? Forgiving? Compulsive? Be honest. Then compare your 
personality with your pup’s character.
 
If you discover that you’re demanding, say, and your dog is sweet, someone’s 
going to have to change. Making too many demands on a sweet dog will only 
frighten him, and he’ll shut down or run away when training begins. If you’re 
compulsive and you have a laid-back dog, you’ll be laughed at. Have you ever 
seen a dog laugh at his owner? It’s quite embarrassing. For you to be a good 
dog trainer, you must modify your expectations to better suit your dog’s 
personality.
Never blame the pup
Believe it or not, puppies don’t react out of spite. Your puppy’s behavior is 
directly related to your own reactions, whether they’re positive or negative.
So how do you handle unruly situations? The first step is to stop blaming 
the dog.
 
Never run at your puppy. Racing headlong toward a puppy is scary. Visualize 
someone two to four times your size barreling down on you. Talk about 
overwhelming. Your puppy may collapse in fear or run from you, but she 
won’t take anything useful from the situation. Consider other options, such 
as using treats to reinforce good behavior.

141
 Chapter 7: Understanding Your New Roommate’s View of the World
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
Recognize the pup’s unique personality
Yes, puppies have personalities, too. If you’ve had more than one pup in your 
lifetime, you know exactly what that means. Each dog is unique. And to train 
him, you must begin by understanding his personality.
 
No matter what his personality, your pup needs to interact and be understood. 
Dogs love to share their secret language with you, and they’re content 
staying close to you as long as you include them in your daily activities.
Regardless of size or coat color, your dog is hardwired to act like . . . well, 
like a dog. He isn’t a kitten, bunny, guinea pig, or child. His behavior is unique 
and predictable: He’ll walk on four legs, sleep at night, and seek affection. 
These universal behaviors can give you a leg up in communicating with and 
training him.
If dogs ran the world
Only recently have people expected dogs to 
adjust to long periods of alone time. For most of 
the 20th century, no leash laws existed — hard 
to imagine, but true. Dogs were left out on the 
back porch during the day and often left to run 
free at night.
Long ago, most dogs weren’t even considered 
pets. They were domesticated and bred to aid 
man in tasks that clearly advanced society, 
from herding sheep, to guarding property and 
towns, to hauling supplies in wagons or sleds.
The evolution of dogs as “pets” has come with 
the expectation that they put their working 
genes to rest (which isn’t entirely possible), 
as well as a growing awareness of their 
psychological and emotional needs. Most dogs 
have retired from their genetic jobs.
Dogs so completely identify with their group 
or team that few would even know how to 
cope if left on their own. Ask various breeds 
what they’d do if they were suddenly put 
out on the street, and although you may get 
different answers, none would much enjoy their 
independence:
  Golden Retriever: Would scramble about 
for the nearest ball or stick and drop it 
eagerly at the nearest foot
  Border Collie: Would herd all the people 
within sight into a tight circle
  Beagle: Would sniff merrily through a 
crowd until someone started to follow
  Jack Russell: Would bark fanatically at a 
mysterious noise in the corner of a building 
until a crowd gathered
  Cavalier King Charles Spaniel: Would head 
for the nearest lap
  Labrador Retriever: Would race into the 
nearest restaurant, lie under the table, and 
wait eagerly for scraps to fall

142
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Recognize your dog’s behavior patterns, understand his communication 
style, and adjust your approach to teaching him how to behave. You need to 
talk Doglish and look at your current situation from his point of view. This 
chapter also helps you get a handle on everyday life immediately, from 
civilizing your dog’s manners to deescalating mismanaged behaviors, such as 
hyperactivity, assertiveness, fear, and impulsivity.
Understanding How Hierarchy 
Differs from Democracy
Your dog looks to you and your family in much the same way she would 
seek inclusion in a group of dogs. She is a team player, as mentioned earlier. 
This truth places dogs, on a whole, above other species in their loyalty and 
focus for our direction. Defining her life’s orientation to your group activity, 
she focuses on her position within your family, yet she reflects her position 
in hierarchical terms, not as part of a democracy. This defining difference 
between our two species must be fully embraced. Democracy is an ineffective 
model when civilizing a dog.
Either be the team leader and give your dog direction, or she will — out of 
her desire to keep the family or pack system working — take over the 
leadership role and train you.
In a group, someone must take charge and make the important decisions.
It’s in their genes
Most people wouldn’t ignore a toddler who looked at them with a confused 
expression, but those same people may overlook a similar expression coming 
from their dog. Because dogs are genetically programmed, especially when 
young, to look for direction, the opportunity to capitalize on their devotion is 
in the human’s hands. When ignored, a dog often repeats whatever behavior 
got him attention previously, creating a hard-to-break cycle.
 
Teach your dog three directions that you can use whenever he looks to you 
for direction:
 
 Get your ball.
 
 Let’s find your bone!
 
 Sit/settle down.

143
 Chapter 7: Understanding Your New Roommate’s View of the World
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
If your dog hasn’t learned these directions, look carefully at the upcoming 
“Giving direction” section and then direct him to the object or into position. 
Praise his cooperation, even as you’re helping him respond appropriately.
 
When your dog stares at you, he is often looking for guidance, but constant 
adoration makes your dog restless. Acting out soon follows, often in the form 
of house-soiling, destructive chewing, or stealing objects.
If your puppy has been assertive from the get-go, he’s likely to have a more 
dominant, leadership-oriented personality. This puppy needs a consistent 
take-charge approach. If your dog develops these traits during adolescence 
or later, he has taken the leadership role only because you did not. You then 
need to change your behaviors to regain your status; although you need to 
be consistent, this dog will be grateful that you’re taking over the demanding 
job. Being a leader is hard work!
Asserting benevolent authority
If you suspect that your dog is organizing your routines, you need to 
reorganize the hierarchy. Unless you want to be dog trained, the first step 
in the process is deciding that you want to do it and reassuring yourself that 
you can do it. Attitude is everything.
 
Your dog is preprogrammed to accept direction, so in many ways, you’re 
already ahead of the game.
Defining your space
Dogs define their role based on social and spatial definition. If you walk 
around, step over, or move out of your dog’s way, your message is loud and 
clear: Your mindful avoidance communicates your respect for your dog’s 
authority. Stop right there and try the following exercises:
 
 Teach your dog “Excuse me.” Your dog identifies your relationship 
based on spatial deference: Either you move out of her way or she 
moves out of yours. Teach her to respect your space immediately. If 
she’s in your way, say, “Excuse me,” and nudge her gently with your foot 
until she moves. If she cuts in front of you, walk straight into her until 
she shifts out of your way. Is she leaning against you excessively or 
inappropriately? Say, “Excuse me,” and use your leg to push her off until 
she respects your personal space.
 
 Condition your dog to lie on the sidelines. Does your dog always 
position herself underfoot? Aside from being dangerous, her intrusion is 
a cry for attention. Provide her with a proper area in each room of your 
house and identify it with bedding and toys. If she’s reluctant to stay 
there, check out the upcoming “Assign play stations in each room” 
section.

144
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
The two preceding exercises are important lessons in civility, and even more 
essential if you’re living with a problem dog.
 
If you ask your dog to move and she growls at you, stop. This action is a 
sign that it’s time to pick up the phone immediately and call for professional 
help. Actively aggressive behaviors require expertise that may go beyond the 
scope of this book — although you can read more about aggression in Book I, 
Chapter 1 and Book IV, Chapter 2
 
Encourage all your friends and family to take part in your efforts to civilize 
your dog. If your dog ignores any of them, step in to reinforce their directions. 
Your dog must learn to respect everyone.
Giving direction
Everyone knows that a small toddler needs lots of direction, interaction, and 
patience. Dogs do, too. The key difference is that children are programmed 
to communicate with words, whereas dogs are not, although they learn to 
respond to sound cues and hand signals. You need to teach your dog the 
proper response for a series of everyday directional cues. These six cues can 
get you and your dog started:
 
 Name: Help your dog create a positive association with his name. Call 
out your dog’s name whenever you come home or to highlight a positive 
moment, such as when you’re offering a treat, loving pats, or playtime 
with a favorite toy.
 
 Don’t call your dog for unpleasant activities, such as isolation or 
unwanted grooming. If you do, he may hear “Come” and think “Run!” If 
“Come” has a reverse effect, stop using it. Use a treat cup and also check 
out the other training techniques in Part IV. Of course, you could just 
keep your dog on leash.
 
 Call your dog as you’re walking away from him or when you’re hidden 
from sight, to pique his interest. Shake a cup of treats while saying his 
name, to encourage his enthusiasm for listening and following you. 
Though initially he’ll respond for the food, you’ll eventually condition 
a positive cooperative habit. Ultimately, you can phase out food treats 
and replace them with praise and petting.
 
 Ball and/or toy: Often during the day, your dog may look to you for 
ideas. If you say nothing, his restlessness may lead to mischief. Instead, 
teach him these words. Each time you play with him or give him a chew, 
repeat a word like “Toy” or “Bone.”

145
 Chapter 7: Understanding Your New Roommate’s View of the World
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
 
 Sit/please: A dog who sits politely is, in essence, saying “Please.” Teach 
your dog to sit either by enticing him with a treat held near his nose and 
moved back over his head, or by placing pressure on his waist muscles 
with your thumb and forefinger as you put gentle upward pressure 
under his chin.
 
 Teach your dog that he must sit before rewards, food, or attention.
 
 Wait/okay: This direction tells your dog to freeze and wait for your next 
cue. Use it at thresholds and curbs or when entering or exiting your 
home, a building, or your car. To teach it, either control your dog on a 
leash or hold him steady, pulling back as you say, “Wait”; then release 
him with “Okay.”
 
 Follow me: This direction simply reminds your dog that you’re the 
leader and will make all the directional decisions for both of you. More 
than a dominance gesture, your leadership efforts convey your willingness 
to be his guardian and protector.
 
 Settle down: This direction encourages your dog to relax. As often as 
possible, direct your dog to a mat or comfortable rug/bed and provide 
him with a displacement activity, such as a bone or toy, which will 
distract him and keep him from idly wandering about. You can use it 
both in your home or when traveling about. Whether your dog is restless 
at your dinner hour or quiet time, or you’re waiting your turn at the 
veterinarian, this familiar direction will give your dog a sense of calm.
Don’t be afraid to use a leash
You may be saying: “I want my dog to join me, 
but he’s so unmanageable. We try, but after a 
short bit, we have no choice but to shut him 
away by himself again. If he’d learn to behave, 
he’d get a lot more freedom.”
If the thought of letting your dog loose leaves 
you shaking in your shoes, you’ve probably 
gotten yourself caught in a vicious cycle. You 
may not realize that, ironically, the prolonged 
periods of isolation are resulting in your dog’s 
impulsivity and mischief.
One solution is to use your leash indoors. Find 
an appropriate training collar (see Book IV, 
Chapter 3), and use a collar-and-leash ensemble 
to lead him through your home. Use the 
directions in this chapter to teach him his man-
ners and socialize him to each room.
The leash is not a cruel device; think of it as 
akin to holding a child’s hand. What’s cruel and 
confusing is forced isolation. When your dog 
is cooperating, let him drag the leash behind 
him so that you can easily grab it, if needed, for 
additional control. When you’re sure that his 
manners have improved and he’s acting civilly, 
you can dispense with the leash — but not 
before you’re certain that it’s no longer needed.

146
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Establishing your social status
Your dog is programmed to accept you and your family as if they were 
other dogs. She depends on the social structure you create to make her feel 
connected and safe. If you communicate direction to her and provide for her 
needs with consistency, she will look to you to interpret other situations as 
well. If your dog is unclear of what you want or you often get frustrated with 
her, she may perceive you as a moody adolescent dog rather than a leader. 
Even worse, your dog may decide that you’re an unreliable or incompetent 
leader, which is bound to make her insecure and frustrate her. When this 
happens, later behavior problems are virtually guaranteed.
Practice the exercises in the following sections to reestablish your social 
status.
Assign play stations in each room
Your home is nothing more than a big den to your dog. How you establish 
routines indoors affects your relationship more than any activities or training 
programs you’re involved in.
 
Think of providing your dog with a play station like offering a guest in your 
home a chair. Your dog doesn’t know where to go in your house until you 
tell him; when you do, he’ll feel welcome, calm, and included. If you don’t, 
he’ll likely misbehave, which provokes your negative attention. Because 
your negative reaction can be interpreted as a controlled or restrained 
confrontation, your dog may think his freedom is an invitation to play.
Give your dog a play station like this:
 
1. Decide the rooms your dog is welcome in.
 
 If you have to isolate him now but want him to share, say, the whole 
house or the downstairs area, take strides immediately toward this goal.
 
2. Go into each room and select a spot on the floor (or a section of a 
chair/sofa) for your dog to call his own.
 
 You may as well call this area a play station.
 
3. Identify that location with a rug, a flat mat, or bedding, and place a 
few of your dog’s favorite bones or toys on it.
 
4. Introduce your dog to his special area.
 
 Bring him into the room on a leash if he’s too fidgety and say, “Settle 
down,” as you lead him to his play station. Sit with him and encourage 
him to focus on his things. Give him lots of attention and feed him treats.

147
 Chapter 7: Understanding Your New Roommate’s View of the World
Book I
Choosing 
and

Dog
 
Bring your dog with you to these places often. If he won’t stay at his play 
station, make sure that he’s had a good romp and time to potty, and then 
hold him still with a leash or secure a leash to something immovable.
Restraint at the door
From your dog’s perspective, your main door is the mouth of her den. 
Whoever orchestrates comings and goings runs the show. If your dog barges 
through or reacts inappropriately when visitors arrive, she’ll assume she’s in 
charge.
In essence, you may be paying the mortgage or rent on a very elaborate dog 
house. Changing this situation is easy enough, but to do so, consistency is a 
must:
 
1. Teach your dog to follow you in and out of the door.
 
 Initially, manage her on a leash and teach her to properly respond to the 
directions “Wait” and then “Okay.”
 
2. Teach your dog a proper greeting ritual, remembering that good 
manners start at home.
 
 Ignore your dog if she behaves in an overexcited or inappropriate 
manner when you or other family members arrive. If she has been 
confined alone in a crate, pen, or room, don’t speak to her until she 
has calmed down or is chewing on a toy. After she has calmed down 
considerably, brace her as you greet her (see Figure 7-1), with your 
thumb clipped over the underside of her collar to prevent her from 
jumping up.
 
Figure 7-1: 
Bracing a 
dog during 
greetings.
 

148
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Create a greeting station 6–15 feet from the door. This location is the place 
where you’ll send your dog before opening the door when company arrives. 
Teach your dog the term “Go back” ahead of time, leading her to the area and 
telling her “Wait” while you open and shut the door.
 
If your dog doesn’t stay put when no one is present, she won’t sit still when 
other people are. In this case, affix a leash to an immovable object. When you 
send her back from the door, secure her on the leash. Practice doing this 
routine when no one is there, and then with your family, and each time 
someone calls. Release your dog after you’ve welcomed the visitor, but only 
when she has calmed down.
 
The goal is for your dog to mirror and mimic your response to newcomers. 
Your dog isn’t the leader — you are. You can shape her responses by 
establishing your authority in this way.
Was that out of spite?
Do you think your dog behaves poorly out of 
spite? Think again. Dogs repeat behavior that 
get them attention (good or bad) and often act 
out of anxiety when left alone, but they don’t 
react out of spite.
Dogs aren’t dishonest or mean. The conclusion 
that your dog is vengeful will do nothing for your 
relationship — such thoughts only result in bad 
energy in the home. Ask not what your dog is 
doing wrong, but what you may not be doing 
right.

W
e live in a litigious society. Whether or not you’ve been involved in a 
lawsuit, the law likely will somehow touch more than a few aspects 
of your life — including your canine companion. From federal laws to local 
ordinances, countless regulations exist to protect homeowners, neighbors, 
dogs, businesses, and more.
Of course, we all prefer to be on the right side of the law, but at some point 
you may find yourself faced with a legal conundrum. Maybe your dog barks 
from the minute you leave in the morning until you walk in the door for 
dinner — and the police are tired of getting calls from your frazzled neighbor. 
Perhaps your landlord has decided that your shepherd mix is a bit too big 
for his liking and he’s terminated the lease on your apartment. Worst of all, 
maybe your dog bit a neighborhood child who came into your yard to get his 
wayward baseball.
This chapter fills you in on some common canine legal issues — licenses, 
leash laws, and noise ordinances. Other laws that have to do with animal 
welfare, such as animal hoarding or keeping a dog chained up or locked in 
a car, are also covered. A relatively new issue, that of breed-specific laws 
against “dangerous dogs,” surfaces in the media from time to time and also 
merits discussion.
You shouldn’t need a law degree to share your life with a dog, but some basic 
knowledge, as well as an added bit of research thrown in for good measure, 
can’t hurt.

Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Discovering the Laws That Affect You
In most cases, local governments are in charge of basic animal regulations, 
such as leash laws and license requirements. Although these laws are similar 
from one city or region to the next, details may vary, so it’s worth checking 
when you first get a dog or move to a new town.
So how do you find out about the laws related to your dog? Start local and 
work your way up. Begin with one or more of these approaches:
 
 Contact your local animal control agency or health department.
 
 Ask the city clerk for a written copy of the municipal code (city 
ordinances), including those having to do with dogs.
 
 Go to the library and look up the city codes and dog laws.
 
 Find the codes on the city’s Web sites.
Depending on your situation, you may want to continue your research at the 
county level; do so by talking to the county clerk or visiting the county’s 
Web site.
State law varies greatly, but many sites can help you monitor both current 
and pending legislation in your state.
 
The Dog Law Web site (www.doglaw.hugpug.com) offers helpful resources 
and information — tenant rights, traveling issues, dog bite liability — for the 
average pet owner. For issues related to pet welfare, try the research tool 
on the site of the Humane Society of the United States (www.hsus.org/
legislation_laws/state_legislation/), which tells you where your 
state stands on laws about everything from tethering (keeping a dog tied up) 
to spaying and neutering. Another online service, the Animal Law Web Center 
(www.animallaw.info), run by the Michigan State University College of 
Law, is an invaluable source of legal materials geared toward nonlawyers. 
With a library of cases and statutes, and content categorized into more than 
50 topics, the site is a user-friendly source of information on a wide variety of 
animal issues.
Though most of the laws that affect pet owners are at a local, county, or 
state level, federal legislation does cover issues such as animal welfare and 
fair treatment of disabled persons who use guide dogs (see the sidebar 
“Protecting service dogs”).

Making it official: Getting a dog license
Almost no matter where you live — town, city, or village — most dogs are 
required to have a license. Why, you ask? Licensing helps protect all of 
us from rabies, because dogs must have proof of the rabies vaccination 
before they can be licensed. Plus, the identification tags that go along with a 
license help get lost or stray dogs returned to their owners. Getting your dog 
licensed is a fairly simple process when you follow these steps:
 
1. Have your dog vaccinated for rabies (usually at around 4 months of 
age); get proof of the vaccination from your veterinarian.
 
2. Fill out the required application, typically with the city or town clerk. 
Have your proof of vaccination with you.
 
3. Pay the fee. Annual fees run about $10 to $20, but they are generally less 
for spayed and neutered dogs (bring proof from your vet). Some cities 
are now raising fees for unaltered animals, to encourage owners to spay 
and neuter. In most cases, fees are waived for guide and service dogs, as 
well as waived or reduced for the dogs of senior citizens and disabled 
persons.
 
4. Attach the license tag to your dog’s collar; file the paper license with 
your legal paperwork.
 
5. Renew your dog’s license when necessary; most agencies send renewal 
notices.
Of course, a license won’t do much good if you don’t renew it every year or 
you don’t keep the tag on your dog at all times. Without a tag, an animal 
control officer may be forced to take your lost pup to the animal shelter.
Cracking the code
Most (but not all — Google is your friend) city 
and county Web site addresses follow these 
formats, simplifying the process of finding your 
local ordinances online:
  County: www.co.<county name>.<state 
postal code>.us (as with w w w .
co.monmouth.nj.us)
  City: www.ci.<city name>.<state postal 
code>.us (as with ww.ci.tulsa.
ok.us).

152
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Vaccinating your dog
Most veterinarians agree that certain vaccines are necessary, but laws and 
practices may vary, so check with your vet about the vaccination schedule 
she recommends. The most common vaccines are parvovirus, distemper, 
rabies, and adenovirus. Although the disease is rare, your dog will need a 
rabies vaccination to be licensed. Check with your town or city about 
vaccination requirements and any free or low-cost clinics that are offered.
Spaying and neutering
With millions of unwanted pets, and shelters and rescues overwhelmed, 
a logical solution is to encourage owners to spay and neuter. In fact, most 
states now require people who adopt dogs from a shelter to spay or neuter 
them, a measure that may have a limited effect on the problem but is a good 
move nonetheless.
But what about those unaltered dogs who are already breeding — intentionally 
or accidentally — in the general dog population? A few cities are taking a 
more drastic approach, requiring spaying or neutering of all pets unless the 
owner buys a special breeding permit each year. The tactic is controversial 
among some people, but it may help reduce the number of unwanted pets in 
this country.
Protecting service dogs
Service animals are dogs who are trained to 
perform tasks for people with disabilities — 
guiding the blind, alerting the deaf, pulling 
wheelchairs, or performing other special tasks. 
Because service animals are working animals, 
not pets, they have special rights in the world 
of canine law.
Although a restaurant won’t likely welcome 
the typical dog, under the Americans 
with Disabilities Act (ADA), a federal law, 
“businesses and organizations that serve the 
public must allow people with disabilities to 
bring their service animals into all areas of 
the facility where customers are normally 
allowed to go.” This applies to restaurants, 
schools, hotels, taxis, grocery and other stores, 
hospitals, theaters, health clubs, parks, and 
even zoos.
Other special considerations are also made 
under the ADA, including allowing service 
dogs to live in housing with “no pets” policies. 
In addition, in many cases, local ordinances 
about licensing and even pooper-scooping 
don’t apply to assistance dogs.

Staying Out of Trouble
A bit of common sense goes a long way when it comes to keeping you and 
your pup out of trouble. Nuisance laws — those laws that prohibit constant 
barking and require that owners clean up after their dogs — are among the 
most common you’ll come across. To reduce your dog’s chance of being a 
nuisance, do the following:
 
 Use a leash and put up a fence. If your dog is safely secured in your 
yard or on a leash, he can’t bother anyone or harm someone’s property. 
The day you make an exception may be the day your pooch decides to 
dig up your neighbor’s flower garden.
 
 Spay or neuter your dog. Your dog may behave better and wander 
less. Careful breeding programs are one thing; random neighborhood 
couplings are another. See the earlier section, “Spaying and neutering.”
 
 Socialize early and often. From an early age, expose your dog to lots 
of people — children, too. Your friends, family, and neighbors will 
appreciate not being nibbled on, barked at, or jumped on.
 
 Try training. Even if you don’t have any aspirations of owning an 
obedience champion, training your dog to walk on a leash and follow 
the basic commands of Sit, Lie Down, and Stay may mean the difference 
between a well-behaved dog and one who can’t be trusted with company.
 
 Leave no trace. Always pick up what your dog leaves behind. Grab a 
plastic grocery bag or use a fancy sack — just pick up the poop and 
dispose of it properly.
 
 Prove that your dog is good. The American Kennel Club offers a 
certification program designed to reward dogs “who have good manners 
at home and in the community.” See Chapter 2 of Book IV for more on 
doggie manners.
Read on to find out more about the legal implications of the common 
nuisance laws.
Taking care of business: The scoop on poop
Like everyone, dogs poop — it’s a fact of life. But it wasn’t until more of us 
starting living in cities with our dogs that the canine byproduct became a 
real problem. It doesn’t take long for a sidewalk to become littered with dog 
feces when owners don’t pick up after their pooches. And no one — no one — 
enjoys stepping on the stuff.

In the 1930s, New York City was an early battleground in the war against 
doggie doo. “Please Curb Your Dog” signs were minimally effective, but in 
1978, New York State’s Canine Waste Law (commonly called the “pooper-
scooper law”) went into effect; the law called for the removal of canine waste 
in any city with a population of 400,000 or more. Since then, cities and towns 
of all sizes have followed suit.
 
Still don’t feel like picking up after your dog? Expect to pay a fine of anywhere 
between $25 and $100.
Leash laws
It would seem that laws about leashes have to be among the simplest on the 
books, simply because it makes good sense for dogs be leashed when they’re 
off their owner’s property. Not so. Although many of us assume that all states 
have a mandatory leash law, it’s not likely to be the case. To complicate 
matters, some municipalities have leash laws and some don’t, so it’s important 
to look into your local regulations.
 
Check out www.animallaw.info/articles/ovusdogleashlaws.htm for 
a break-down of the states’ widely varying leash laws.
A typical leash law requires dogs to be leashed and under control when 
they’re off their owner’s property. This means that the days of letting a dog 
run loose in the neighborhood are over, and your dog should be walked 
on a leash even if you’re confident that she’s completely off-leash trained. 
Unleashed dogs can get loose and run the risk of being hit by a car or picked 
up and taken to an animal shelter; owners are liable for fines, as well as any 
legal actions — say, if a loose dog bites someone.
Try to find a local dog park for a safe place to let your dog run free. Like 
playgrounds for pooches, dog parks are popping up in communities 
throughout the country.
Noise ordinances
Anyone who’s ha d to put up with a barking dog for more than a few minutes 
can attest to the level of piercing annoyance it causes. It’s not a surprise that 
noise complaints are among the most common lodged against dogs and their 
owners. Though such complaints are usually resolved between individuals 
and rarely end up in a courtroom, laws help protect neighbors from the 
headaches and sleepless nights caused by a chronic barker.

155
 Chapter 8: Fido and the Law
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
In many cases, specific state laws or local ordinances cover the problem of 
barking dogs. When a law isn’t specifically geared at dog noise, a general 
noise ordinance usually does the trick; most local noise ordinances designate 
quiet hours from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m., so anyone allowing their dog to bark, 
howl, or whine during those hours can be charged with disturbing the peace.
When a barking dog becomes a real problem, it’s best for everyone (you, the 
neighbor, and the police) to resolve matters without involving the police or 
animal control. See the nearby sidebar, “Resolving disputes: Giving peace 
a chance,” for tips. When all else fails, though, you may have to check your 
local and state laws and pursue a legal avenue.
Biting
Although the majority of dogs are harmless, the statistics for dog bites are 
startling. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 4.7 
million people are bitten by dogs each year, with about 800,000 — half of 
them children — requiring medical attention.
 
Regardless of breed or prior history, even the friendliest dog may bite. A 
bite is a bite, whether the dog was provoked, afraid, hurt, acting on a natural 
instinct to be protective, or even being playful. In short, people win. And 
under many laws, owners may be held financially liable when their dog hurts 
someone. This is no small matter. According to the Insurance Information 
Institute, the average cost of a dog bite claim was $24,461 in 2008.
Resolving disputes: Giving peace a chance
If you end up in the middle of a neighborly dis-
pute about a dog (yours or the neighbor’s), first 
try to talk through the problem. Even if it doesn’t 
work and you end up in a court of law, you’ll 
know you tried to be civil. Consider some tips:
  Try it in writing — write a friendly note to 
set up a meeting and get the ball rolling.
  Be calm and listen.
  Don’t threaten to call the police or a lawyer.
  Offer solutions and listen to those offered 
to you.
  Agree on a plan and then schedule a date 
to meet again for a progress check.
If you can’t resolve the issue, you may have to 
bring in some help — a mediator, perhaps. Of 
course, if all else fails, you may need to do your 
research to find out your legal rights.

156
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Laws vary, so it’s a good idea to determine the type of dog bite law imposed 
in your state. About two thirds of the states have what is known as a strict 
liability statute, which makes the owner liable for any personal injury caused 
by a dog, regardless of the owner’s knowledge of viciousness. This means 
that a victim has a valid case against the owner even if a dog has never bitten 
anyone. Some exclusions may apply, such as some that pertain to whether a 
dog was provoked or questions on whose property the bite occurred. Go to 
www.animallaw.info/articles/qvusdogbiteslstatutes.htm to see 
specifics about each state’s statute.
Some states follow the common-law doctrine of the “one bite” rule, which 
basically means that a dog owner can be held liable for any injury if he had 
knowledge of any vicious tendencies. However, an owner may be deemed 
liable after a dog has bitten the first time or if the victim can prove negligence 
(a fence wasn’t high enough to secure a dog, for example). Many states have 
switched from this law to the strict liability statute.
In many states, cases that involve breeds considered “dangerous” — mainly 
the Pit Bullish breeds — are handled differently. Often these dogs are bred or 
trained to be aggressive. For more on the issue of breed-specific law, see the 
section “Regulating Dangerous Dogs.”
Keeping in mind that any dog may bite, you can take measures to help 
prevent a bite from happening:
 
 Never let your dog run loose. Secure fencing and leashing are critical.
 
 Socialize and train your dog from an early age.
 
 Spay and neuter your dog to help reduce aggressiveness.
 
 Carefully monitor contact with children — insist on considerate 
behavior, and never leave a dog alone with a child.
Regulating Dangerous Dogs
Even the sweetest dogs can snap (literally and figuratively) under certain 
circumstances, but individual dogs who do bite someone or display 
dangerous tendencies are, from then on, considered “dangerous” or 
“vicious,” according to some laws. Although most dangerous dog laws 
are found at the local level, a number of states are now adopting versions 
of such laws.

157
 Chapter 8: Fido and the Law
Book I
Choosing

Dog
Many believe that dangerous dog laws help protect people from dogs who 
have been deemed vicious. However, some cities and states have taken the 
next step and adopted breed-specific laws, which some people feel unfairly 
target breeds such as Pit Bulls and Rottweilers; in fact, some breed-specific 
laws even ban these breeds.
Dangerous dog laws and breed-specific laws require owners to take special 
precautions to protect others from harm. The following are some examples of 
restrictions placed on dangerous dogs and breeds and their owners:
 
 The dog must be locked in a secure, confined area.
 
 The dog must be muzzled in public.
 
 The dog must be identified with a microchip or tattoo.
 
 The owner must have the dog sterilized.
 
 The owner must purchase a special license or permit from the town, 
city, or county.
 
 The owner must purchase more liability insurance.
 
 The owner must post “Beware of Dog” signs.
 
 The owner must pay fines or face jail sentences if proven to have 
deliberately created a dangerous dog.
Opponents of breed-specific laws believe that these regulations disregard 
the individual nature of dogs. Temperaments vary within any breed — a 
doe-eyed Cocker Spaniel may be more ferocious than a steel-jawed American 
Staffordshire Terrier, for example. And most individuals within a breed, even 
those breeds originally developed for dog fighting, are not dangerous. All 
dogs are influenced by factors such as breeding, training, and socialization, 
leaving dog advocates and lawmakers with a complicated issue. These laws 
likely will continue to evolve as time and debate goes on.
Preventing Canine Cruelty
What is the definition of animal cruelty? Because the legal explanation differs 
from state to state, even animal welfare advocates struggle with the question. 
Animal cruelty generally means causing unjustified injury or death to an 
animal, but the exact meaning depends on individual laws.

158
Book I: Choosing and Bringing Home a Dog 
Although no federal anticruelty law is on the books, every state in the nation 
has an animal anticruelty statute that applies to dogs. These state laws 
penalize two types of actions:
 
 Intentional acts: Hitting, burning, maiming, or killing a dog
 
 Failure to act: Situations of neglect in which food, water, veterinary 
care, and shelter are not provided to a dog
 
The laws vary greatly, however, with some much stronger and more 
encompassing than others. The Humane Society of the United States features 
a way you can review your state’s animal cruelty laws: www.hsus.org/acf/
cruelty/publiced/animal_cruelty_laws_by_state.html. The 
organization also offers information on some of the common issues related 
to dog welfare.
Breaking free from the chains
A truly sad and unfortunate sight is that of a dog chained to a stake in a patch 
of dirt in the middle of someone’s backyard. The dog is lonely, bored, frustrated, 
frightened, and maybe even thirsty and hungry.
Tethering — tying or chaining a dog to a stationary object for an extended 
period of time — is inhumane and can cause serious problems, such as 
aggression and psychological damage. Tethered dogs also suffer from biting 
insects, extreme temperatures, and sun exposure; tragically, many dogs have 
been strangled to death by tethers.
Fortunately, tethering is becoming increasingly recognized as an unnecessary 
act of animal cruelty. In fact, according to the Humane Society, more than 100 
communities in more than 30 states have passed laws that regulate the practice 
of tethering animals. Other communities allow tethering for only limited 
periods of time.
If dogs are to be left outside during the day, they need a securely fenced 
outdoor pen or other space that has a shelter to protect them from the 
elements. And all dogs should be taken indoors at night. The only object your 
dog should be attached to is the leash you use on his daily walks.
Dogs in vehicles
Cars and dogs have a love-hate relationship: Dogs love to chase cars and ride 
with their noses poked out of car windows; unfortunately, they are too often 
injured or killed in or by cars. Dog lovers have worked hard to get anticruelty 
laws passed to protect pooches when it comes to automobiles:

159
 Chapter 8: Fido and the Law
Book I
Choosing 
and 
Bringing 
Home a 
Dog
 
 Parked cars: An enclosed car can heat up fast on a warm, sunny day, 
with the temperature exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit in just minutes. 
Don’t be fooled into thinking that your dog will be fine if you park in the 
shade or crack a window or two. Anticruelty statutes and laws forbid 
owners from leaving a dog in a parked vehicle without adequate 
ventilation.
 
 Pickup trucks: Approximately 100,000 dogs a year are killed in the 
United States because they jump or are thrown from the open back of a 
pickup truck. Many local governments and some states — California to 
name one — have adopted laws that require dogs to be in cages or 
otherwise secured in truck beds.
Setting limits on numbers
To protect both animals and residents, some communities have put into 
place ordinances that restrict the number of dogs residents can have, usually 
to two or three per household. Many times these laws are created to cut 
down on the problems of noise and odor that can be caused by high 
concentrations of canines. In some cities, owners can pay for a special 
permit that allows them to keep more dogs.
Animal hoarders, people who collect animals beyond their ability to provide 
for the animals’ needs, are at the extreme end of the spectrum — but of 
special concern to anticruelty organizations. These are the cases that 
occasionally surface in the media; the abuse typically differs from other types 
of cruelty because the hoarders themselves can’t or don’t see the problem, 
many times because they are suffering from some sort of psychological issue 
such as obsessive-compulsive disorder.

In this book . . .
O
nce you have a dog, you had better find out how to 
feed him right and keep him healthy. These chapters 
deal with nutritional, medical, exercise, and other health 
issues. There’s also a chapter on caring for an aging dog, 
and one that introduces the topic of starting your own 
breeding program.

Chapter 1
The Scoop on Dog Food
In This Chapter
 Knowing how much protein, carbohydrates, and fats your dog needs
 Making sure that your dog is getting the right amount of vitamins and minerals
 Getting an inside look at how your dog’s food is made
 Checking out organic options
D
ogs are carnivores — meat eaters. Their teeth are shaped for biting, 
tearing, and grinding flesh and bones, and their intestinal tracts are 
short, with enzymes that are good for digesting proteins (but not very good 
at breaking down and absorbing plant material). So it only makes sense that 
your dog’s diet should be meat based.
Dogs are also opportunists, which means they’ll eat whatever comes their 
way, including the trash in your kitchen and the grass in your yard. They do 
gain nutritional benefits from vegetables, fruits, and grains, but they need 
meat in their diets as their main source of nutrition.
This chapter covers the eight building blocks of nutrition. All these building 
blocks are required in a well-balanced diet, regardless of the dog. But the 
amounts of these nutritional elements that each dog needs depends on that 
dog’s unique situation — puppies and adults need different amounts, as do 
spayed and pregnant females, and active and inactive dogs.
Proteins
Proteins are the most critical component of food for your canine carnivore. 
They are also the most abundant component of your dog’s body. Your 
dog needs proteins to produce hair, nails, tendons, cartilage, and all the 
connective tissues that support the rest of the tissues and organs in her 
body. Adequate protein is important for your dog’s growth and proper 
development, her muscle development and strength, a functioning immune 
system, the production of functioning hormones, the proper volume of blood, 
injury repair and prevention, and much, much more (see Figure 1-1).

This dog, 
Fate, arrived 
at a shelter 
in terrible 
condition, 
but after 
two months

nutrition,

Your dog’s body can also use proteins to produce energy, if necessary. Fats 
and carbohydrates are much more readily available sources of energy, but 
dogs can break down proteins and convert them to energy when necessary, 
such as when food supply is low.
 
Proteins are made up of amino acids linked in a chain. When your dog eats 
protein, enzymes that the pancreas secretes into the intestines break them 
down into shorter chains of amino acids called polypeptides, which are 
small enough for the intestines to absorb. A dog’s body makes 20 different 
amino acids — some are essential amino acids and others are nonessential amino 
acids. As the name implies, your dog requires essential amino acids in his 
food. Food that contains all the essential amino acids is called a complete 
protein source. The nonessential amino acids are . . . drum roll, please . . . not 
essential; if your dog doesn’t get them in his diet, he can convert other amino 
acids into those that he’s missing.
Your dog can get proteins from both animal and plant sources. But only 
animal-source proteins are complete protein sources, and not all of them are 
complete. Examples of complete protein sources that come from animals 

165
 Chapter 1: The Scoop on Dog Food
Book II
Dog

and Health
are eggs, whole milk, and lean meat. Grains are another important source of 
proteins in dog foods, but they are incomplete protein sources because they 
don’t contain some of the essential amino acids your dog needs. Plant protein 
sources frequently used in dog foods include soybeans, wheat, and corn.
 
Your dog’s major source of protein should be animal products, not grain. 
Don’t buy a dog food in which soybean meal, soy flour, or corn gluten meal 
is the primary, or even the secondary, source of protein (see the section 
“Reading a Dog Food Label” later in this chapter for more on this). Dogs don’t 
have the enzymes to use grains properly as main sources of protein.
 
The American Association of Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) is the 
organization that sets guidelines for the types and amounts of nutrients dogs 
need in their foods. The AAFCO has determined that foods for adult dogs 
should contain no less than 18 percent protein, and that foods for lactating 
females or puppies should have a minimum of 22 percent protein. Military or 
police dogs, mushing dogs, and other dogs who work hard every day or who 
are under stress may need more. Dogs recuperating from injuries or surgery 
may need more protein as well, to repair muscles, tendons, and ligaments.
 
Not all complete protein sources are created equal. A cow’s hoof and a filet 
mignon may both have all the essential and nonessential amino acids, but 
your dog can get the amino acids he needs more easily from the filet mignon 
than from the cow’s hoof. Some proteins are just more digestible than 
others. So how do we know which protein sources are digestible and which 
aren’t? Nutritionists measure the amount of protein in a food, feed it to dogs, 
and then measure the amount of protein in the dogs’ feces. The difference 
between how much was in the food to begin with and how much the 
dog excretes reveals how much of it the dog absorbed, and that is the 
digestible protein. A protein isn’t very useful to your dog if it ends up on your 
lawnrather than in his body. Hair and feathers are a cheap source of protein, 
too — but they’re indigestible. On the other hand, eggs are highly digestible 
but expensive. Not surprisingly, the more digestible the protein, the more 
expensive the dog food. As with many things in life, you get what you pay for.
 
Beware of foods that advertise over 90 percent digestibility. The highest-
quality dog foods are 82–86 percent digestible, whereas economy foods 
(inexpensive brands you get in grocery stores) are around 75 percent. The 
percent digestibility of a dog food is not stated on the label, but most dog 
food manufacturers provide that information on request.
 
If your dog’s feces are voluminous, it may be a sign that his food isn’t highly 
digestible.

166
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
A brief history of dog food
Before the late 19th century, there was no 
such thing as prepared dog food. Lucky dogs 
owned by the well-to-do ate the leftovers from 
their owners’ dinners, and street dogs aplenty 
canvassed the alleys, scrounging in the trash. 
In the 1870s, a time when transportation literally 
used horse power, a European entrepreneur 
devised a unique way to solve the problem 
of what to do with the carcasses of the many 
horses that died every day in the cities: He 
decided to package and sell the horse meat 
as dog food. The idea caught on, particularly 
among the wealthy, who appreciated the 
convenience of having a ready-made food for 
their dogs.
The first commercial dog foods in North 
America were made by Ralston-Purina in 
1926. The foods were tested on dogs that the 
company kept in large kennels on the property 
near St. Louis, Missouri. Ralston-Purina dog 
food was given the ultimate test when it 
was fed to the sled dogs on Admiral Byrd’s 
expedition to Antarctica in 1933. Although this 
was a punishing test for a dog food, it also was an 
early precursor to the celebrity endorsements 
that are a major part of the advertising budgets 
for many large companies today.
In the decade after World War II, the idea 
of prepared dog food really caught on. The 
economy was booming and people didn’t mind 
spending a little money for the convenience of 
having a ready-made dog food for their canine 
companions. Besides, the companies producing 
these dog foods were performing studies on the 
nutritional needs of dogs, and their foods were 
billed as containing everything a healthy dog 
needed.
At that time, most dog foods were canned. 
This method of preserving food was familiar to 
Americans, who enjoyed the convenience of 
canned human foods that could be stored for 
months or even years on their shelves. In 1956, 
dog food companies began to utilize the extrusion 
process, in which nutrients in dried form are 
mixed with water and steam- and pressure-
forced through an opening; the extruded 
material then is cut into small pieces. The food 
pieces are cooled, coated with vitamins and 
other components that are lost in the process 
of heating, flavored, and packaged.
Dry dog food allowed the consumer to more 
easily carry large amounts of dog food home 
from the grocery store. In addition, people 
found pouring food from a bag more convenient 
than opening a metal can. Plus, dry foods were 
advertised as helping keep dogs’ teeth cleaner. 
As a result, since the late 1960s, the majority 
of dogs have been fed dry dog food, although 
canned food is still widely used, especially for 
smaller dogs.
In the early 1970s, the National Research Council 
(NRC) published the first recommendations 
listing the minimal nutritional requirements of 
dogs. Dog food companies now had a standard 
by which they could measure the nutritional 
value of their foods and parameters by which 
they could claim their foods to be complete 
and balanced. (The term complete indicated 
that all the required nutrients were present in 
their foods, and balanced indicated that these 
nutrients were in the correct proportions.) 
The NRC nutrient requirements for dog foods 
were supplanted in 1992 by nutrient profiles 
established by the American Association of Feed 
Control Officials (AAFCO). Throughout the late 
20th century, as the dog population continued 
to grow, so did the dog food industry. By 1999, 
the pet food industry was an $11-billion-a-year 
industry — and very competitive. Today dog 
foods are advertised and marketed every bit 
as competitively as human foods, highlighting 
the importance of being aware of what you’re 
buying.

167
 Chapter 1: The Scoop on Dog Food
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
Fats
Fats are the major source of energy for dogs. Dogs who live outdoors in the 
cold need more fat to supply them with the energy to keep warm. And police 
dogs and working dogs need enough fat so they don’t have to get their energy 
from carbohydrate or protein supplies.
But fats do more than provide your dog with energy. They also help keep 
skin and foot pads supple and coats healthy. Supplying an allergic dog with 
the proper amount and type of fats can make a huge difference in how much 
she scratches. Fats also carry fat-soluble vitamins into the body from the 
intestines. These vitamins are essential for health, and the only way your dog 
can absorb them is if she eats enough fat to carry them into her body. Plus, 
just as with our own food, fat makes a dog’s food tastier, which can be 
important in helping dogs who are ill to eat enough.
Fatty acids are the major component of fat. Dogs really need only omega-6 
fatty acid (linoleic acid), because they can’t make it on their own. Linoleic 
acid keeps your dog’s skin supple and pliable, and her pads and nose leather 
flexible. Dogs lacking linoleic acid have scruffy, dry coats and dry, cracked 
pads. Luckily, dogs don’t need a lot of linoleic acid. Good sources are beef, 
pork, chicken, and the oils from corn, safflower, and soybeans.
Omega-3 fatty acids can also help dogs with allergies by controlling the 
inflammatory responses in their skin. Omega-3s can improve dry skin and 
decrease stiffness from arthritis. But omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids have 
some opposing functions, so you need to be sure that your dog is getting 
a balance between these two components. Shoot for a ratio of omega-6 to 
omega-3 fatty acids of about 5 to 1. Your dog is better off if her food has the 
correct ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids than if you try to provide it in 
supplement form. Look for dog foods that have safflower oil or corn oil for 
omega-6 fatty acids, and fish oil or fish meal for omega-3 fatty acids.
 
The ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids is listed on the bags of some of 
the better-quality foods, so if your dog is having skin problems, opt for a 
higher-quality food — and one with the correct ratio of omega-6 to omega-3.
Although your dog needs fat in her diet, too much fat can contribute to 
obesity, the number one nutritional problem in dogs. Excessive fat can 
also slow the digestive process and may cause nausea, diarrhea, and 
vomiting. High-fat diets also play a role in the development of pancreatitis, 
an inflammation of the pancreas that can result in very severe vomiting and 
sometimes even death. So you need to control the fat levels in your dog’s 
diet. Feeding a high-quality dog food (and not giving lots of extras), watching 
your dog’s weight, and making sure that she gets enough exercise is the 
best way of ensuring that she won’t become obese. On the other hand, that 
doesn’t mean a low-fat diet is good for dogs. Too little fat can lead to dry, 
flaky skin; dry, cracked pads; and a dull coat.

168
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
Be sure to read the dog food label before choosing a diet for your dog and 
observe your dog’s response to the food. If you don’t like the appearance of 
your dog’s coat and skin on one diet, try a different one.
Carbohydrates
Every cell in your dog’s body needs a continuous supply of carbohydrates, 
particularly in the form of glucose, to function properly. In fact, it is so 
important for cells to have glucose that the body produces the hormone 
insulin to drive glucose into the cells. Glucose is especially important for 
your dog’s brain and muscles. Carbohydrates also assist in the digestion of 
other nutrients, especially fats. Your dog’s carbohydrate requirements vary 
according to his level of activity, health, and overall energy needs.
 
Carbohydrates come in three basic forms: sugars, starches, and cellulose. 
Sugars and starches are simple carbohydrates because they are readily 
available as glucose or can be broken down into glucose. Good sources of 
simple carbohydrates are rice, oatmeal, corn, and wheat. Simple carbohydrates 
are easy for your dog to digest when properly cooked; they also add texture 
to the food, making it more palatable. Cellulose, the main carbohydrate found 
in the stems and leaves of plants, is a complex carbohydrate. Dogs don’t have 
the enzymes to digest cellulose (most animals don’t), but it serves as fiber, 
helping regulate water in the large intestine and aiding formation and 
elimination of feces.
 
The best foods use the carbohydrates that come in grains; sugar need not 
be added to food, although some manufacturers do this to make it taste 
better. The AAFCO has no recommended minimum or maximum levels of 
carbohydrates in dog foods. Carbs make up the remainder of the bulk of the 
food after fats, proteins, fiber, and vitamins and minerals have been added.
Fiber
Fiber is an important component of dog food. It provides bulk to the food 
and helps the intestinal contents absorb water, which results in formed 
stools that are readily expelled. If a food has too little fiber, the dog may have 
loose stools, because there is nothing to help the stools form. If a food has 
too much fiber, it will pass much more quickly through the gastrointestinal 
system, making digestion less efficient and the stools hard and compacted.
Beet pulp is an excellent source of fiber. It is the dried residue from sugar 
beets, which first have been cleaned and freed of crowns, leaves, and sand, 
and then used to extract sugar for human foods. Dried tomato pomace is 

169
 Chapter 1: The Scoop on Dog Food
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
another good source of fiber. It is the dried mixture of tomato skins, pulp, 
and crushed seeds, a byproduct of the manufacture of tomato products.
Most dog foods contain between 3 and 6 percent fiber. Weight-reduction 
diets may have between 8 and 25 percent fiber.
Water
Water is the most plentiful molecule in your dog’s body (your dog’s body is 
two-thirds water) and is essential for every function, from digesting food to 
dashing across the yard. In the gastrointestinal tract, water dissolves nutrients 
to prepare them for digestion and helps transport the nutrients across the 
intestinal wall.
Your dog loses water by several routes, through salivation and respiration, 
and in urine and feces. If your dog loses more water than she takes in, she 
will suffer from dehydration, which, if severe and untreated, can be fatal.
 
Every dog should have access to clean, fresh water at all times.
Enzymes
Enzymes play a role, often in conjunction with vitamins, in just about every 
body reaction. They are like the keys that unlock the doors to chemical 
reactions. Each enzyme is the catalyst for one specific reaction, which is 
why so many different enzymes exist. The pancreas secretes several kinds of 
enzymes that assist in digestion. In addition to enzymes secreted by the 
pancreas, enzymes are present in fresh foods.
In most dogs, the pancreas produces sufficient enzymes for digestion. However, 
in some dogs, pancreatic function is not optimal. Older dogs frequently have 
trouble fully breaking down their foods for optimal absorption of nutrients, as do 
dogs with pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) or pancreatic cancer. 
Vitamins
Dogs require 14 different vitamins. With only a few exceptions, dogs don’t 
make the vitamins themselves, which means they must get these vitamins 
in their food. Vitamins participate in numerous chemical reactions that help 
to release the needed nutrients from food and help the dog’s body put those 
nutrients to use. Vitamins can be either water soluble or fat soluble.

170
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Water-soluble vitamins
Water-soluble vitamins have to be supplied on a daily basis, because they are 
continually broken down and excreted. They include the following:
 
 Thiamin (vitamin B1): Promotes a good appetite and normal growth. 
Required for energy production.
 
 Riboflavin (vitamin B2): Promotes growth.
 
 Pyridoxine (vitamin B6): Aids in the metabolism of proteins and the 
formation of red blood cells.
 
 Pantothenic acid: Required for energy and for protein metabolism.
 
 Niacin: Exists in many enzymes that process carbohydrates, proteins, 
and fats.
 
 Vitamin B12: Necessary for DNA synthesis and intestinal function.
 
 Folic acid: Works together with vitamin B12 and in many of the body’s 
chemical reactions.
 
 Biotin: Acts as a component of several important enzyme systems.
 
 Choline: Required for proper transmission of nerve impulses and for 
utilization of sulfur-containing amino acids.
 
 Vitamin C: Participates in the formation of bones, teeth, and soft tissue.
The daily requirements for each of these vitamins are supplied in premium 
dog foods. Generally, an excess of these water-soluble vitamins is harmless 
because they are excreted in the urine. As long as your dog is eating a high-
quality complete and balanced commercial diet and is healthy, you don’t 
need to worry about supplementing her diet with water-soluble vitamins.
Fat-soluble vitamins
Fat-soluble vitamins don’t have to be supplied in the food every day because 
excess levels are stored in a dog’s body’s fat. Long-term storage means that 
they can accumulate to toxic levels, but this is very rare. Your dog needs the 
following fat-soluble vitamins:
 
 Vitamin A: Necessary for proper vision, especially night vision. 
Important in bone growth, reproduction, and maintenance of tissues 
such as the lungs, intestines, and skin.
 
 Vitamin D: Critical to the dog’s ability to use calcium and phosphorus 
for bone and cartilage growth and maintenance.

171
 Chapter 1: The Scoop on Dog Food
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
 
 Vitamin E: An antioxidant that protects the cells (and dog food) from 
oxidative damage. Important for muscular and reproductive function.
 
 Vitamin K: Essential for normal blood clotting.
Minerals
Minerals are present in small amounts in the tissues of all living things. 
Teeth, bones, muscles, and nerves have especially high mineral content. 
Although the AAFCO provides guidelines for the minimum amounts of 
minerals necessary for canine growth and development, each dog’s mineral 
requirements depend on the current nutritional state. For example, if a dog 
is iron deficient, he will need and absorb more iron from the intestinal tract. 
Working dogs and ill or stressed dogs may also have higher requirements.
Minerals can be divided into two groups: major minerals and trace minerals. 
The major minerals are required in gram amounts each day, whereas the 
trace minerals are required in milligram or microgram amounts per day. Of 
the trace minerals, several are known to be required for canine health, and 
the roles of others are less understood.
 
Your dog’s body needs to maintain a delicate balance between the various 
major and trace minerals. For several trace minerals, the line between the 
required amount and toxic levels is a thin one. So supplementing an already 
balanced dog food with minerals can create more problems than it solves.
Table 1-1 lists the different minerals your dog needs and which foods are 
good sources of these minerals.

Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Major minerals
The four major minerals are calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and sulfur. 
Calcium and phosphorus are the most important minerals in all dogs’ diets, 
especially in the diets of growing puppies. Calcium is needed for muscle 
contraction, nerve transmission, and blood coagulation. It is also required 
to activate numerous enzymes that affect virtually every process in the cell. 
Phosphorus plays a part in nearly all chemical reactions in your dog’s body. 
Both strengthen your dog’s bones and teeth.
 
Although the ratio of calcium to phosphorus in a dog food is important, the 
total amount of calcium ingested may be more important. Excess calcium 
is thought to contribute to the development of hip and elbow dysplasia, 
osteochondrosis dissecans (degeneration of the joint cartilage), and other 
bone and joint problems. Calcium deficiencies frequently occur in dogs 
who are fed all-meat diets. A severe deficiency of calcium can cause rickets 
and bone malformations. A moderate deficiency can cause muscle cramps, 
impaired growth, and joint pain.
 
As of this writing, all premium-quality adult maintenance dog foods produced 
by major manufacturers have enough calcium to support the healthy growth 
of puppies, including those of giant breeds. Resist the urge to provide extra 
supplementation of vitamins and minerals, particularly those containing 
calcium, to your growing puppy on a premium dog food.
 
Never add bone meal to a complete and balanced diet. Not only are you likely 
to alter the critical calcium to phosphorus ratio, but you also risk decreasing 
your dog’s ability to absorb and utilize many of the other minerals he needs.
Magnesium is essential for many enzymatic reactions. It also helps promote 
the absorption and metabolism of many other vitamins and minerals, including 
vitamins C and E, calcium, and phosphorus. As with calcium and phosphorus, 
magnesium is important in bone growth and development. In fact, 70 percent 
of the magnesium in your dog’s body is in his bones. Magnesium is rarely 
deficient in complete and balanced diets. However, its absorption can be 
impaired when the diet is too high in calcium and phosphorus.
Your dog needs sulfur for the synthesis of a variety of components in his 
body, most notably proteins. Sulfur is also an important constituent of joint 
fluid and cartilage and, thus, is important for proper joint health.
Trace minerals
Your dog needs only very small amounts of trace minerals in her diet. Trace 
minerals are found in meat and grains and are provided as a supplement in 
complete and balanced premium dog foods. A balanced diet is still the best 
source for all the vitamins and minerals required for optimum health.

173
 Chapter 1: The Scoop on Dog Food
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
The trace minerals include the following:
 
 Iron: Iron is present in every cell in the body. It is particularly important, 
along with protein and copper, for the production of red blood cells, 
which are responsible for transporting oxygen from the lungs to every 
part of the body. Dogs with iron deficiency develop anemia. But 
remember, iron is needed in only small amounts, so it is important that 
you not supplement with iron unless you have a prescription.
 
 Zinc: Zinc is important in the metabolism of several vitamins, particularly 
the B vitamins. It is also a component of several enzymes needed for 
digestion and metabolism, and it promotes healing as well. Your dog 
needs zinc for proper coat health. Some breeds of dogs, particularly the 
northern breeds such as Siberian Huskies, appear to have problems with 
absorption and/or utilization of zinc. These dogs develop poor coats and 
dry, scaly skin with sores (particularly on the nose and mouth) and stiff 
joints unless they are supplemented with zinc.
 
 Copper: Copper is a trace mineral that has many different functions. 
It is needed for the production of blood and for the proper absorption 
of iron. It is also involved in the production of connective tissue (the 
cells and extracellular proteins that form the background structure of 
most tissues) and in healing. Copper is found in fish, liver, and various 
grains. The amount of copper in a grain is related to the level of copper 
in the soil where the grain was grown. A copper deficiency can result 
in anemia and skeletal abnormalities. Some breeds of dogs, such as 
Bedlington Terriers and Doberman Pinschers, can have a genetic 
problem that interferes with the metabolism of copper. In these dogs, 
copper is stored in the liver to toxic levels, resulting in hepatitis.
 
 Iodine: Iodine is critical for the proper functioning of the thyroid gland, 
which regulates the body’s metabolism and energy levels and promotes 
growth. Iodine is found in high levels in fish. It is added to most dog 
foods to make the levels sufficient for canine health.
 
 Selenium: Selenium works with vitamin E to prevent oxidative damage 
to cells. It is needed in only minute amounts in the diet. Meats and 
cereal grains are good sources of selenium. In dogs, an excess of 
selenium results in death of the heart muscles, as well as damage to the 
liver and kidney. Deficiency results in degeneration of heart and skeletal 
muscles.
 
 Manganese: Manganese is a component of many different enzyme 
systems in the body. Most important, it activates enzymes that regulate 
nutrient metabolism. It is found in legumes and whole-grain cereals; 
animal-based ingredients are not a good source of manganese.
 
 Cobalt: Cobalt is a part of vitamin B12, which is an essential vitamin. Cobalt 
does not appear to have any function independent of vitamin B12.

174
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
In addition to these trace minerals, other trace minerals known to be 
important in laboratory animals but with an unclear role in dogs include 
molybdenum, cadmium, arsenic, silver, nickel, lead, vanadium, and tin.
 
As scientists discover more about the nutritional needs of dogs, they are 
beginning to recognize that our canine companions may need different 
nutrient levels for optimal health than they need just to prevent deficiencies. 
Be sure to discuss nutritional questions with your veterinarian — and take 
a vet’s advice over anyone selling dog food, because stores may push the 
brands that give them a bigger profit margin. And if you have a question 
about a specific dog food, call the manufacturer.
How dog food is made
How do some cows or chickens and a pile of 
grains turn into your dog’s dinner? First the 
animals are slaughtered and the body parts 
not used for human consumption are put into 
bins according to which parts of the body they 
do or do not contain. These are either shipped 
directly to the dog food manufacturer or are 
rendered and the meal (what remains after the 
fats are removed) is shipped to the manufacturer. 
Similarly, either grains or the meal (what 
remains after the oils have been extracted for 
use in human foods) may be shipped to the 
dog food manufacturer. If whole grains are 
sent, the manufacturer grinds and separates 
the grains into their different components. For 
example, wheat may be separated into wheat 
flour, wheat germ meal, wheat bran, and wheat 
middlings.
The ingredients are then mixed in proper 
proportions and added to the extruder, a large 
tube containing a screw that mixes the ingredients 
with steam and water under pressure, and then 
squirts out the mixture through holes at the end, 
like a pasta maker squeezes out spaghetti. A 
knife cuts the ribbon into small pieces, which 
are then moved along a conveyor belt through 
a dryer/cooler until the right amount of moisture 
remains. The food is then coated with fat, 
vitamins, and flavorings.
The high temperature at which dry dog foods 
are processed breaks down proteins and 
may change their structure and quality. In 
addition, the heat destroys any enzymes that 
were in the food components. Vitamins that 
have been destroyed during processing have 
to be sprayed back onto the food after it cools. 
But whether the components that are added 
back are really the same as those that were 
present in the unprocessed food components 
is unclear, and this is why some people 
prepare foods for their dogs at home. As a 
trade-off, however, processed dog food is 
virtually sterile. None of the common bacteria 
present on beef and poultry, such as salmonella 
and E. coli, remain after the food is processed.
Semi-moist foods are not dried as much, and 
they have more preservatives and sugar added. 
Canned dog foods are heated but not sent 
through an extruder. Thus, they tend to retain 
more of the natural proteins, fats, vitamins, and 
enzymes.

The Main Types of Dog Food
If you’re like most people, when you look at the shelves of dog food in the 
store, you’re bewildered by the choices available: puppy foods and senior 
foods, foods for large dogs and small dogs, diet foods for pudgy pooches, 
foods that claim to be all natural, foods that promise to improve your dog’s 
coat, foods that make their own gravy, and foods shaped like little bones.
How can you possibly pick the best food for your furry friend that will give 
him all the nutrients he needs and help him live a long and healthy life? 
Worry not. The following sections help you make better choices when buying 
dog food.
Many different forms of dog food are available today. Dry food usually contains 
less than 10 percent water, semi-moist foods contain 25 to 40 percent water, 
and canned food contains 75 to 80 percent water.
You may also have heard the terms premium or super-premium to describe 
dog foods, but these terms don’t have a legal definition — they can be used 
by anyone. Premium is a term frequently used to describe high-quality dog 
foods generally sold in pet supply stores rather than grocery stores. Super-
premium generally refers to the highest-quality foods that are prepared using 
the best ingredients available. Likewise, no legal definitions govern the terms 
gourmet or natural when referring to dog food.
 
Most veterinary nutritionists agree that semi-moist dog foods offer very little 
nutritional value. These foods contain dyes and other nonessential additives 
so that they can be shaped into little bones, steaks, or other shapes. The 
additives may make the food visually appealing to the consumer, but dogs 
don’t care what their food looks like. Semi-moist foods also are preserved 
with sugar, which contributes to obesity and periodontal disease in dogs.
 
Avoid foods that don’t have complete nutritional information on the label 
(see the “Reading a Dog Food Label” section of this chapter for more 
information). Foods that are produced and sold within the same state aren’t 
required to have complete nutritional information the way foods that are 
sold across state lines are. These foods may be nutritionally sound, but 
without complete information, you can’t be sure. Also steer clear of dog 
foods that haven’t been tested in feeding trials with real live dogs.

176
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Reading a Dog Food Label
The first place you need to look when trying to decide on a food for your 
furry friend is the label on the bag, box, or can. Reading a dog food label isn’t 
very different from reading the one on your cereal box. A certain amount of 
nutritional information must be included on the label, but a certain amount of 
leeway exists in how the dog food company presents it.
Who’s in charge around here?
Several watchdog groups oversee various 
parts of the dog food manufacturing and 
marketing process. Take a look at this rundown 
of the regulatory agencies and what they do:
  The Association of American Feed Control 
Officials (AAFCO): The AAFCO consists 
of animal food officials from the United 
States and Canada who have joined to 
develop minimum standards for dog foods 
(and other animal foods as well). The 
AAFCO publishes standardized nutritional 
guidelines for dog foods, which most dog 
food manufacturers use as their nutritional 
standard. The AAFCO has also established 
specific guidelines for what should and 
should not be included on dog food labels. 
Although the AAFCO does not have any 
powers mandated by law, reputable dog 
food companies willingly comply with its 
guidelines — which allows them to state 
on their dog food labels that they meet or 
surpass AAFCO guidelines. Visit its Web 
site at www.aafco.org.
  Pet Food Institute (PFI): PFI has been 
around since 1958 and is the national trade 
association for pet food manufacturers. 
It monitors legislation that affects the 
pet food industry and lobbies for the 
interests of pet food manufacturers before 
federal legislative bodies, such as the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture, the Federal 
Trade Commission (FTC), the AAFCO, and 
Congress. As a way of self-policing, PFI 
has established the Nutrition Assurance 
Program, which provides specific 
guidelines for the feeding trials that are 
used to test the nutritional quality of dog 
foods. Dog food companies that have 
complied with these guidelines in their food 
trials can state on the label that their food 
provides complete and balanced nutrition 
according to AAFCO procedures. For more 
information, visit its Web site at www.
petfoodinstitute.org.
  National Research Council (NRC): The 
National Research Council’s Committee 
on Animal Nutrition was the first group 
to establish minimal requirements for 
canine nutrition. First published in 1974, the 
minimal requirements are similar to 
the recommended daily allowances (RDAs) 
you see on packages of human foods. The 
NRC requirements for dogs were updated in 
2001, based on a comprehensive review of 
the scientific literature on canine nutrition. 
The Canine Nutrition Expert Subcommittee 
of the AAFCO currently recommends that 
dog foods use its nutrient profiles rather 
than those of the NRC. However, the NRC 
provides an important and independent 
source of information for the consumer 
on the nutritional requirements of dogs.

Divide the label into two parts: the product display panel (on the front of the 
package) and the information panel (usually on the back).
The product display panel
The product display panel is the place where the dog food company hopes to 
catch your eye. So it makes sense that it appears on the front of the package. 
You’ll typically find a few key pieces of information on the product display 
panel, primarily the dog food company name, the product identity, the 
product use (whether it’s dog food or cat food, for example), and the net 
weight of the package. You may also find a banner statement, which is where 
the dog food company makes claims about the quality of the food. 
Product identity
The product identity section states the name of the product, such as Big 
Bart’s Beefy Dinner.
 
Any terminology regarding the meat or meat flavor used in the product 
identity statement has to comply with a list of specific definitions. Consider 
some examples of common phrases and the standards that need to be met 
before the dog food company can use the phrase:
 
 Beef for dogs: The food must contain 95 percent beef by weight.
 
 Beef dog food: The food must contain 70 percent beef by weight.
 
 Beef dinner, beef entrée, or beef platter: The food must contain 25 
percent beef by weight.
 
 Dog food with beef: The food needs to contain only 3 percent beef.
 
 Beef-flavored: The food doesn’t need to contain any beef; it just needs 
to taste like beef (using artificial flavors).
 
The same rules for terminology apply to any meat source in dog food, such 
as chicken, lamb, and so on.
Product use
The product use statement just indicates which animal the food is formulated 
for (dogs or cats, for example).
Net weight
The product display panel includes the net weight of the package contents.
 
Just as with human foods, dog food manufacturers frequently change the size 
of containers without changing the price. For example, a can that looks to 
be a standard 6-ounce size may actually contain 5.5 ounces, but at the same 
price. Be sure to read the label carefully.

178
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Banner statement
The front of the package may also have a banner statement, which is where 
the manufacturer makes specific claims about the dog food. The AAFCO 
regulates the content of banner statements. For example, if a label says that 
dogs prefer the taste of that food, it must also tell you what other dog foods 
were tested to arrive at that conclusion. An example of a correctly worded 
statement regarding preferred taste would be, “Preferred by dogs over the 
leading premium brand.”
Rules also govern what defines a light/lite, low-calorie, or less fat dog food. 
If a manufacturer states that its food is light or low-calorie, that food must 
have 15 percent fewer calories than the average of other dog foods in the 
same category. If the manufacturer claims that a certain dog food has less of 
a component, the claim must state how much less and tell the consumer less 
than what. For example, a dog food claiming to have less fat must state the 
percentage reduction in fat (on the basis of weight, not volume) and must 
state that this is less fat than other dog foods in the same category (dry, 
semi-moist, or canned, for example).
Dog foods using the terms lean or low-fat must meet yet another set of 
standards. They must have a maximum fat content that is 30 percent less 
than the industry average for dog foods. In addition to the required statement 
listing the minimum amount of fat in the food (see the “Guaranteed analysis” 
section later in this chapter), these foods must state the maximum amount of 
fat, because these diets are used for weight loss.
The information panel
The information panel is where the manufacturer tells you the nitty-gritty 
details of what’s in the food. You’ll usually find it on the back of the package. 
The information panel should provide a guaranteed analysis of what’s in the 
food, an ingredients list, a nutritional adequacy statement, feeding guidelines, 
and the manufacturer’s contact information.
Guaranteed analysis
Legally, dog food labels are required to state only the minimum levels of 
protein and fat and the maximum levels of moisture and fiber in the food. 
These are only minimums and maximums, so keep in mind that the dog 
food may have more than the minimum amounts or less than the maximum 
amounts of components stated on the label.
 
If your dog is ill, small differences in the amount of these important nutrients 
may make a difference in her health. If you have any questions about your 
dog’s food and whether you’re giving her what she needs, talk with your vet.

179
 Chapter 1: The Scoop on Dog Food
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
The AAFCO nutrient profiles for dog foods let you know the minimum 
requirements for protein and fat for both adult dogs and puppies. But the 
AAFCO protein and fat levels are listed on a dry-weight basis, whereas the 
proteins and fats on a dog food label are listed on an as-is basis, which 
includes water. This difference can lead to some confusion when you try 
to determine whether a given dog food has the levels of nutrients your dog 
needs. It can also be confusing when you compare one dog food to another, 
because each dog food may have a different level of moisture (which affects 
how much of the nutrient is actually there on a dry-weight basis).
 
To make accurate comparisons between two foods, you need to do some 
math, so get out your calculator and follow these steps (protein is the 
example, but you can do the same equation for other nutrients as well):
 
1. Find the percentage of protein in the dog food.
 
2. Find the percentage of moisture in the dog food.
 
3. Subtract the percentage of moisture from 100 to get the percentage 
of dry.
 
4. Divide the number from Step 1 by the number in Step 3 and multiply 
by 100.
 
 This gives you the percentage of protein on a dry-weight basis.
For example, if you’re looking at the label of a dry dog food (see Figure 1-2) 
and it says that the food contains 26 percent protein and 10 percent moisture, 
subtract that 10 percent moisture from 100, which gives you 90 percent dry. 
Then divide the 26 percent protein by 90 percent dry and multiply by 100; 
you get 29 percent protein on a dry-weight basis.
 
Figure 1-2: 
A dog food 
label can 
tell you 
how much 
protein is in 
there, but 
you need 
to do a little 
math.
 

180
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
If you’re looking at the label of a canned dog food, the formula is exactly the 
same, but you’ll find significantly different results. If the label says that the 
food contains 9 percent protein and 80 percent moisture, subtract that 80 
percent moisture from 100, to get 20 percent dry. Then divide the 9 percent 
protein by 20 percent dry and multiply by 100; you get 45 percent protein on 
a dry-weight basis.
So what does all this math tell you? If you just compared the labels of the 
food, you would have thought that the dry food had more protein (because 
the dry food label said the food contained 26 percent protein and the canned 
food contained only 9 percent). But when you do the math, you discover that 
the canned food actually has 45 percent protein (on a dry-weight basis), 
compared to 29 percent in the dry food.
 
If all this math seems to be more trouble than it’s worth, here’s a quick rule 
of thumb to help you compare dry and canned foods. For a dry food, to 
determine the level of protein, fat, or fiber on a dry-weight basis, add 10 
percent to the level that is listed on the label. For a canned food, multiply the 
amount of protein, fat, or fiber by four. This timesaving tip makes it easier to 
compare while you’re standing in the store aisle.
 
As this exercise shows, canned foods typically have much more protein than 
dry foods. A major reason for this is that grains are needed in dry foods to 
help them hold their shape after extrusion. Canned and dry foods made by 
the same manufacturer usually have very different percentages of protein.
Ingredients list
Dog food manufacturers are required to list the ingredients in each dog food 
in descending order by amount, on a dry-weight basis (refer to Figure 1-2 
for an example). The label must list every ingredient. A dog food company 
can actually have a grain as the most abundant ingredient in its food while 
making it look like the most abundant ingredient is a meat. Take a look at 
how they do it: Say that the Chow Hound dog food company is making dog 
food using wheat as the main ingredient and poultry byproduct meal as its 
second-most-common ingredient. Instead of just listing wheat, the company 
can break down wheat so that it’s listed on the label as wheat flour, wheat 
germ meal, wheat bran, and wheat middlings. This allows the company to list 
poultry byproduct meal first, because the food has more poultry by-product 
than it does wheat flour, wheat germ meal, wheat bran, or wheat middlings. 
The four wheat ingredients can be put lower on the list, making the wheat 
seem like a less important and less abundant ingredient. Scan down the list 
of ingredients, and if the second, third, fourth, and fifth ingredients on the list 
are all something other than meat, your dog may be getting more of that than 
meat.

In general, a good-quality dog food has two quality animal protein sources 
listed in the first few ingredients. Look for a food that also has two different 
sources of fat in the ingredients list, for adequate energy and to provide all 
essential fatty acids (see earlier in this chapter for more on fats).
 
Dog food companies frequently change the composition of their dog foods, so 
the label on the food you purchased yesterday may not be the same today. 
Keep the ingredients list from your current dog food label in your wallet and 
periodically check it against the labels on the dog foods you’re buying, just to 
make sure that you’re buying what you thought you were.
Vocabulary 101
If you’re confused by some of the lingo on dog 
food bags, you’re not alone. Some of the defini-
tions for the food terms you’ll see in the ingredi-
ents list include the following:
  Animal byproduct meal: Rendered animal 
tissues that don’t fit any of the other ingre-
dient definitions. It still can’t contain hair, 
horns, hoofs, hide trimmings, manure, or 
intestinal contents or extraneous materials.
  Byproducts: Non-human-grade proteins 
obtained from animal carcasses. They can 
vary greatly in their digestibility, and the 
consumer has no way to determine their 
digestibility.
  Meat: The clean flesh of slaughtered 
cattle, swine, sheep, or goats. It must come 
from muscle, tongue, diaphragm, heart, or 
esophagus.
  Meat and bone meal: Rendered mammal 
tissues, including bone. Other than that, it 
is similar to meat meal.
  Meat byproducts: Fresh, nonrendered, 
clean parts of slaughtered mammals. It 
does not include meat but does include 
lungs, spleens, kidneys, brains, livers, 
blood, bones, fat, stomachs, and intestines. 
It cannot include hair, horns, teeth, or hoofs.
  Meat meal: A rendered meal made from 
animal tissues. It cannot contain blood,

als. It may not contain more than 14 percent 
indigestible materials. Lamb meal is made 
from lamb parts. Meat meal is made from 
cattle, swine, sheep, or goats.
  Poultry (or chicken or turkey) byproduct 
meal: Ground, rendered, clean parts of the 
carcass of slaughtered poultry, such as 
necks, feet, undeveloped eggs, and intes-
tines. It cannot contain beaks or feathers.
  Poultry (or chicken or turkey) byproducts: 
Nonrendered clean parts of slaughtered 
poultry, such as heads, feet, and guts. It 
must not contain feces or foreign matter.

Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Nutritional adequacy statement
Dog food manufacturers can determine the nutritional adequacy of dog foods 
in two ways. The best way is for the dog food manufacturer to conduct feeding 
trials, in which it feeds its foods to real, live dogs and sees whether they 
like to eat it, whether they gain weight at the proper rate, and whether their 
blood and bodies have the right composition of proteins and fats. AAFCO 
requirements state that dogs in feeding trials must be fed the dog food for at 
least six months. If a dog food has been tested in feeding trials, the label will 
say so, usually in a statement like, “Animal feeding tests using Association 
of American Feed Control Officials’ procedures substantiate that this food 
provides complete and balanced nutrition for maintenance.” Try to choose a 
food that makes this kind of claim on its package.
Preservatives and antioxidants in your dog’s food
Antioxidants are preservatives that are added 
to foods to help protect the fats, oils, and fat-
soluble compounds such as vitamins from 
breaking down. Unsaturated fats readily mix 
with oxygen in the air and become rancid. Rancid 
fats are not just a problem because they smell 
bad; they also cause the food to lose its flavor 
and texture. More important, rancid fats can 
affect a dog’s health. When a dog eats rancid 
fats, he may end up suffering from a relative 
deficiency of vitamin E, a natural antioxidant 
that the body uses to combat rancid fat.
Because all dog foods contain some unsaturated 
fats, they all require some sort of antioxidant 
preservative. Many foods are preserved 
with preservatives, including BHA, BHT, and 
ethoxyquin. Ethoxyquin has been especially 
controversial, because concerns arose that 
it caused cancer. However, studies in dogs 
and puppies have not shown an increase in 
cancer from ethoxyquin. Still, due to consumer 
preferences for natural ingredients, most dog 
foods are now preserved with vitamin E and 
vitamin C. Ironically, the vitamin E and vitamin 
C that are used in dog food are man made, 
too — so they’re not exactly “natural.”
If you’re feeding a dog food that has been 
preserved with vitamins E and C, be sure that 
the food is less than six months old when you 
give it to your dog. Most manufacturers use a 
production code that indicates the date and 
even time when the food was made, along 
with the plant that manufactured it. Others 
use a best used by code, which indicates the 
time by which the food should be consumed. 
To determine how fresh your dog’s food is, call 
the manufacturer and ask them to explain their 
code. They will tell you what each number and 
letter means.
Finally, a food’s antioxidant powers are depleted 
more rapidly during hot, humid weather, so in 
the warm summer months, use food that is less 
than six months old. Always store your dog’s 
food in a cool, dry place, and don’t buy more 
than a month’s supply at a time.

Book II
Dog 
Nutrition

Dog food manufacturers can also sell dog foods that have been formulated 
according to the AAFCO nutritional profiles for dogs but have not been tested 
on dogs in feeding trials. To make a formulated food, the manufacturer adds 
an amount of protein that is at least 18 percent for adult dogs, an amount of 
fat that is at least 5 percent for adult dogs, and the required amounts of all 
the other required nutrients. If you feed your dog a food that has been 
formulated but not tested on dogs, your dog essentially becomes the test 
subject. Examples abound of formulated dog foods that looked good on 
paper but, when fed to dogs, resulted in nutritional deficiencies. Stay away 
from foods that have not been tested in dogs.
 
However, the regulations regarding feeding trials for dogs have a loophole. 
After a dog food manufacturer has proven by feeding trials that a given food 
is nutritionally adequate, the manufacturer may state that formulated foods 
have been tested by feeding trials, as long as the formulated foods are in the 
same family. Unfortunately, no guidelines spell out the definition of a family 
of dog foods. We are left to trust the manufacturer’s word.
Feeding guidelines
Every dog food label must have recommendations regarding how much to 
feed dogs of different sizes. However, the feeding guidelines on the label 
usually overestimate the amount of food a typical dog needs to eat every day. 
Cynics say that this is a ploy the dog food manufacturers use to sell more 
food. The dog food manufacturers indicate that these guidelines are based 
on calculations of what typical dogs in their feeding trials needed to satisfy 
their energy requirements. The dogs in these feeding trials are unaltered 
(not spayed or neutered) and get a great deal of exercise, and few dogs fit 
the same mold; most need much less food than the amount listed on the bag. 
(For more information, see the section “Figuring Out How Much to Feed Your 
Dog” later in this chapter.)
Manufacturer’s contact information
Manufacturers are required to list the address and telephone number of their 
customer service departments on every dog food label. In addition, many dog 
foods now also provide Web site addresses.
 
The customer service departments of dog food manufacturers are usually 
very helpful. If they don’t know the answer to a question, they will hunt it 
down and call you back. If you call a company and they can’t or won’t 
provide the information that you need, don’t feed that food to your dog.

184
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Figuring Out How Much 
to Feed Your Dog
How do you decide how much food to put in the bowl? If you’re just starting to 
feed a new food, and the label tells you how many calories the food contains, 
you may want to start with the information in Table 1-2, which lists the 
calorie requirements of dogs depending on the dog’s weight and activity 
level. For the purposes of the table, an inactive dog is one who rarely gets 
more than a jaunt around the yard, a moderately active dog is one who gets 
15 to 30 minutes of continuous exercise every day, and a highly active dog is 
one who gets at least several hours of exercise every day.
 
If the label doesn’t provide information on the caloric content of the food, 
you have to use the manufacturer’s recommendations as a starting point. 
Start by feeding 25 percent less than the manufacturer recommends and then 
increase or decrease the amount as necessary.

Nutrition

As dogs exercise more, they need more calories to maintain their weight. But 
as dogs get larger, they require relatively fewer calories to maintain their 
weight. This is because larger dogs generally have slower metabolisms than 
smaller dogs. Age can affect caloric requirements, too. As a dog goes from 1 
to 7 years of age, her energy requirements drop by an incredible 24 percent.
 
Dogs’ metabolisms vary so greatly that the best way to know exactly how 
many calories your dog needs each day is by trial and error. Feed the amount 
of food that will maintain your dog’s weight. If she loses weight, feed more. If 
she gains, feed less.
Choosing the Best Food for Your Dog
How do you make that final decision? As a general rule, start by feeding a 
name-brand, good-quality, commercial balanced diet that has been tested by 
feeding trials in dogs. Put more trust in companies that have been around a 
while, because they have their own internal quality controls in addition to 
those imposed by the regulatory agencies.
 
Sorry, but the best-quality foods are not the cheapest. However, the reverse 
isn’t necessarily true: Paying a lot for your dog food doesn’t guarantee its 
quality. As you search for the best food, don’t hesitate to experiment. Be a 
good observer. Talk to your veterinarian and other dog people, such as your 
breeder. Over time, you will gather more information and be able to make 
better decisions based on fact as well as experience.
 
When you have selected a quality food for your furry friend, your job isn’t 
done. You still need to keep close track of your dog’s response to the food. 
Watch his body condition. Your canine companion should maintain a 
correct weight on his new food. If he gains some weight but looks and acts 
healthy and full of energy, it may be that the nutrients in the new food are 
more digestible than those of the previous food, so you don’t need to feed 
as much. If your dog loses weight on his new food, start looking for another. 
Your dog’s coat should grow and glisten on his new food, and his skin should 
be pink and supple, with no sores. A dog’s coat is often a reflection of his 
general health, although it isn’t the only monitor to use. For example, during 
the spring in temperate climates, most dogs’ coats look dry as they shed 
their heavy winter garb for a lighter spring coat.

186
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
One of the best criteria you can use to monitor your dog on a new food is to 
observe his stools. Stool quality is determined by the ingredients in the food, 
the relative amounts of different ingredients, the type and amount of fiber, 
and the digestibility of the ingredients. Small, firm stools indicate a food that 
is highly digestible. However, your dog should not be constipated or straining 
to defecate. Large stools, particularly if they are somewhat loose, may 
indicate a food with less digestible nutrients and/or a high fiber content. 
Your dog’s stools will vary from day to day. But if your dog often has small, 
hard stools, consider changing to another food. Those stools may be easy to 
pick up, but they may also mean that your dog is chronically constipated.
 
Monitor your dog’s attitude and energy level. If you feed your dog a good-
quality food, he will have lots of get-up-and-go. He will have the energy and 
endurance to play all you want. Most of all, he will have that joy for life that 
we all appreciate in our canine companions.
What’s the best dog food for your dollar? Most people find that they save 
money by buying good-quality, premium foods for their dogs — the kind of 
food sold at pet supply stores rather than grocery stores. This is because 
dogs need to eat much less of a good-quality food to take in their required 
nutrients. In addition, dogs on high-quality foods probably have fewer health 
problems, and when they do, they heal faster. The icing on the cake is easier 
cleanup in the yard.
Paying Attention to How 
You Feed Your Dog
Many people free-feed their dogs, which is the practice of keeping a dog’s 
bowl full and letting him eat whenever he wants. Although this may seem like 
an easy approach to feeding, free-feeding isn’t a good idea, for many reasons:
 
 Dogs who are free-fed are more likely to be overweight. This may not 
have been true in the past, but with today’s highly palatable foods, your 
dog will enjoy eating long past the point at which she’s full. She will 
likely take in more calories than she needs and carry the fat to prove it.
 
 You can’t tell exactly how much your dog is eating. In fact, you may 
not recognize that your dog is ill until you suddenly notice you haven’t 
been adding much food to her bowl in the past few days. Food intake 
is one of the best indicators of health, so you should always be in a 
position to monitor your dog’s intake accurately.

187
 Chapter 1: The Scoop on Dog Food
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
 
 Medicating dogs who are free-fed is more difficult. If you have to give 
your dog pills, such as heartworm preventive, and your dog is free-fed, 
you will have to make sure that you pop it down her throat and she 
swallows it. However, if she gets fed two square meals a day, you can 
just add the pill to her food and it will go right down the hatch!
 
 Free-feeding is difficult in multidog households. Frequently, one dog 
hogs the food and gains weight, while the other dog is deprived of the 
food and loses weight. Plus, free-feeding is impossible if your dogs 
require different kinds of food.
 
So how many times a day should you feed your dog? Feed puppies four times 
a day until they are 3 months of age, when you can move them to feedings 
three times a day. At 6 months of age, dogs can be fed twice a day, and this 
is probably the best feeding schedule for a dog to stay on for life. Some dogs 
are fed just once a day and get along fine. Occasionally, however, dogs who 
are fed once a day vomit a little fluid or bile 12 to 18 hours after their last 
meal. If they are fed twice a day, this problem goes away.
 
No two dogs are exactly the same. They have different metabolic rates, they 
have different metabolisms, and they may need to eat different diets. If you 
have more than one dog, it may be more convenient to feed all your dogs the 
same food, but make sure that you monitor each dog’s response to the diet 
you are feeding and change the food if an individual dog needs it.
 
Give your dog a quiet place to eat. If other dogs live in the house, don’t feed 
them from the same bowl. Feed them at a distance from each other so they 
don’t feel threatened that the other dog will steal their food. The best solution 
is to feed your dog in a crate so she can enjoy his meal in the privacy of her 
den. When you put the bowl down, give your dog 15 minutes to eat. If she 
hasn’t finished in that time, either you are feeding her too much or she isn’t 
motivated to eat. By removing the bowl, you can be assured that she will 
be much more motivated to eat at the next meal. Don’t be held hostage by 
a picky dog. If you try to encourage her to eat by talking nicely to her and 
giving her delectable treats, she will soon up the ante, demanding better and 
better treats until she’s not consuming her dog food at all.
 
Many veterinary nutritionists believe that we should be rotating our dogs’ 
diets — feeding them one food for three to six months, and then switching to 
another diet. They theorize that abnormal proteins may be formed during the 
processing of food or that individual foods may have undetectable deficiencies 
or small differences in the availability of certain nutrients. By rotating your 
dog to a new food every three to six months, you prevent too much exposure 
to the abnormality in any given food.

Organic Options for Feeding Your Dog
Maybe you’re going organic with your own diet. Or your dog suffers from 
allergies and you’ve heard organic food may help. Perhaps you just want 
your dog to eat as well as you do. Whatever your reason for exploring 
organic options for your dog, you’re wise to do a bit of research before 
making a switch. Of course, as with any decision related to diet and your 
dog’s health, check with your veterinarian before making any changes.
Sales of organic dog foods — foods grown without pesticides, preservatives, 
hormones, and antibiotics — are on the rise, up 48 percent from 2007 to 2008, 
according to the Organic Trade Association, which monitors organic market 
trends. Though organics still make up only a small fraction of domestic pet 
food sales, eco-conscious consumers are finding it easier to purchase the 
products they need. You can find brands such as Newman’s Own Organics 
and Natura Pet Products in many pet supply stores.
Often the reason behind a switch to organic begins with some sort of health 
issue. Skin conditions and allergies can be especially troublesome for 
some breeds. When sprays, dips, shampoos, medications, and even dietary 
changes don’t work, some owners turn to organic foods for success. Organic 
foods are free from the artificial dyes and chemical additives that can trigger 
a dog’s allergies.
People food is okay in small amounts
Giving your dog fresh vegetables and even 
some fresh fruit on a regular basis is a good 
idea. Wolves (from which our dogs are 
descended) eat the greens and grains from 
their prey’s stomach, and also eat grasses and 
berries at times. Dogs enjoy fresh vegetables 
and benefit from the vitamins and fiber they pro-
vide. The only vegetable to stay away from is 
raw onions (some say cooked onions are fine, 
but some say they aren’t).
Feed your dog the leftovers from your prepara-
tions for dinner, in addition to other vegetables, 
especially the meats and vegetables. That way, 
both you and your dog benefit. Just make sure 
that vegetables aren’t the major component of 
your dog’s food.
If you give the vegetables in large pieces, they 
provide mostly fiber because dogs don’t have 
the enzymes to digest cellulose, the major 
component of the cell walls of plants. However, 
if you put the vegetables through a juicer or a 
super-blender that breaks down the cell walls 
and turns the vegetables to mush, your dog will 
also benefit from the nutritional content of the 
vegetable.

In more serious cases, owners of dogs with cancer switch to packaged organic 
foods (kibble, canned food, treats), believing that organic food may give a sick 
dog ammunition for fighting the disease. Some people go as far as cooking meals 
for their dogs, although a veterinarian should first approve this type of diet.
So what are some advantages and disadvantages of organic dog foods? Take 
a look. As for the advantages, organic dog food
 
 Is produced without chemicals, steroids, or artificial colors and flavors.
 
 Contains better grades of grains and proteins to help with digestive 
issues such as gas or diarrhea.
 
 Has no bulk fillers, making food easier to digest. It may also help manage 
weight.
 
 May help with allergies and skin ailments.
 
 May help boost immunity, helping your dog ward off ailments.
Disadvantages include the following: Organic dog food
 
 Isn’t as widely distributed as conventional dog food.
 
 Is more expensive than nonorganic dog food. (The same situation is true 
of organic food for humans.)
 
 Has not been proven through scientific evidence to help your dog live a 
longer or healthier life.
Weigh these pros and cons, and think about what is best for your dog.
Food for thought: Organic versus natural
Deciphering food labels can feel like a chore, 
but it’s a chore worth doing when you’re 
serious about good health. A particularly 
confusing labeling distinction — and one 
that applies to food for humans and canines 
alike — is the one between organic and natural. 
Don’t be misled — organic and natural are not 
the same. Organic foods must be certified as 
organic by the U.S. Department of Agriculture — 
that is, produced and processed without 
chemical pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, 
hormones, and antibiotics. Although natural 
foods are free of food coloring and chemical 
additives, they are not organic. So although 
natural foods have some benefits, they are not 
held to the same higher standard as organic 
foods.

In This Chapter
 Keeping your dog safe from viruses, bacteria, and parasites
 Protecting yourself and your family from the bugs that like your dog
S
cientists know of millions of species of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and 
parasites — and they discover new ones every day. Although this 
chapter discusses bugs that are problematic to dogs, most microorganisms 
don’t cause disease. They live in the soil and infect plants, animals, and even 
humans, but you can’t even tell they’re there unless you look.
In fact, microscopic critters are an important part of the circle of life. Without 
bacteria and fungi to decompose organic matter, humans would long ago 
have been buried in debris. Without the bacteria that digest plant material in 
the stomachs of cows, you’d have no milk or beef. Without the bacteria that 
inhabit your body, you would soon die of infection. Yes, ironically, beneficial 
bacteria even protect you from infection by their nasty relatives.
The bugs discussed in this chapter are the rare ones that infect dogs and 
cause systemic diseases (ones that affect the entire body).
Vaccinating against Viruses
Viruses are the smallest bugs scientists know of. You can fit 25 million 
viruses on the period at the end of this sentence. Viruses must grow inside a 
host cell; they can’t replicate on their own. Although this fact may seem like 
it would be a disadvantage to a virus, it’s exactly what makes viral infections 
so hard to fight. After all, how do you kill a virus that’s living in a cell without 
killing the cell itself? Because of this problem, very few drugs effectively treat 
viral infections, and many of the existing antiviral drugs are quite toxic.

192
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
The key to fighting a viral infection, therefore, is to make sure that your dog 
never gets infected, and the best way to accomplish this is to vaccinate him. 
Most of the vaccines given to dogs are designed to prevent viral infections: 
rabies, distemper, parvovirus, parainfluenza, and adenovirus (and kennel 
cough, though that can also be caused by bacteria). The following sections 
provide a little bit of information about the worst of the bad bugs. When you 
know what they can do to your furry friend, you’ll never want to get behind 
on his vaccinations. As always, talk to your vet about which vaccinations 
your dog may benefit from.
Rabies
This viral infection is the most important infectious agent that you should 
vaccinate your dog against. Rabies vaccinations are so important, in fact, that 
in North America, it is illegal to have a dog who is not vaccinated for rabies. 
In most states, a dog who has bitten a person and is not vaccinated for rabies 
can be impounded and perhaps destroyed. Why does the government care 
whether your dog gets rabies? It’s simple: Rabies can be transmitted to 
humans by the saliva of an infected dog, through either a bite wound or a 
cut. When a person becomes ill with rabies, it is generally fatal if not treated 
within two weeks of the injury.
If you want to see the incredible (and justified) fear people had of rabid dogs 
in the days before the rabies vaccine was developed, watch the film To Kill 
a Mockingbird. In that movie, a rabid dog stumbles down a residential street 
while people hide in their homes, watching it and hoping that someone will 
have the courage to confront the dog and shoot it. 
Rabies usually infects an animal (or human) through a wound such as a bite. 
When the virus enters the body, it moves to a nerve and then travels up the 
nerve to the spinal cord and brain, where the virus replicates and kills brain 
cells. The victim then begins to act in bizarre ways: Dogs may become very 
hyperactive and aggressive, or they may become weak and unresponsive. 
Death occurs in days, weeks, or months, depending on how far the virus has 
to travel through an animal to get to the central nervous system.
Luckily, vaccination of dogs against rabies is virtually 100 percent effective, 
and humans can share home and hearth with their canine companions 
without concern. Rarely anyone in a developed country contracts rabies 
today. However, in less developed countries, such as India, 50,000 people 
(mainly children) still die every year from rabies.

193
 Chapter 2: Vaccinations and Common Health Issues
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
 
Puppies should be vaccinated against rabies for the first time after 12 weeks 
of age and then again at 1 year of age. After that, they should be vaccinated 
yearly or every three years, depending on state laws and the type of vaccine 
used. When your dog is vaccinated, you receive a vaccination certificate and 
a rabies tag. Always make sure that your dog wears her rabies tag, and keep 
the rabies vaccination certificate in a safe place where you can easily find it. 
If your dog escapes and bites someone, her rabies tag (and your vaccination 
certificate) will provide proof to animal control officers, veterinarians, and 
physicians that the dog was vaccinated. This documentation will prevent the 
unfortunate person from having to undergo post-exposure prophylaxis, a 
series of rabies shots designed to stop the virus in its path through the body 
to the brain.
 
Many species of wild animals throughout North America can live normal 
lives while being infected with rabies. The most common species are foxes, 
raccoons, skunks, and bats, but other animals can be infected, too. In many 
species, including skunks and raccoons, the virus can be present at high 
levels in the saliva and blood without even causing the animal to become ill. 
For this reason, it is never a good idea to keep these wild animals as pets; in 
some states and provinces, doing so is illegal. The risk of exposing humans to 
rabies is just too high.
 
Never touch a dog, cat, or any wild animal who is staggering, acting 
aggressively, or otherwise behaving bizarrely. If such an animal bites you — 
or if any animal you don’t know bites you — get medical attention 
immediately. Never touch a wild animal that approaches you. Wild animals 
should have a natural fear of humans. If they don’t, it may be because they 
are suffering from rabies.
Canine parvovirus
Canine parvovirus enteritis was first identified in the late 1970s, when it 
swept through dog populations worldwide, killing thousands. The veterinary 
community worked tirelessly to determine the most effective ways to treat 
the condition, identify the virus, and produce a vaccine. An effective vaccine 
was developed and put into use within three years, quickly reducing the 
number of deaths.
Parvovirus attacks and kills the cells that line the small intestine. As a result, 
the dog cannot absorb the fluids in the intestine and the dog develops 
diarrhea, often with blood. Dogs with parvovirus often vomit because of the 
upset in their digestion. Some people say that they can smell a particular 

194
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
odor in parvovirus-infected puppies. Mildly affected dogs may recover in a 
few days, but severely affected dogs become depressed and dehydrated, and 
can die within a day or two. The severity of the parvovirus infection depends 
on the dog’s immunity to the virus. Dogs with inadequate immunity, especially 
puppies, still continue to die of parvovirus enteritis despite treatment. If your 
dog has diarrhea for more than 24 hours or has diarrhea with blood in the 
stool, seek veterinary attention.
 
Unfortunately, parvovirus is here to stay and continues to kill puppies who 
have not been vaccinated. Worse, vaccinated puppies may still contract 
parvovirus even if they are vaccinated while they still have antibodies 
that they obtained from their mother’s milk. Although every puppy gets 
antibodies in milk, and these antibodies are important to protect the puppy 
from infectious disease while the pup is very young, these maternal antibodies 
can also interfere with vaccination by neutralizing the viral proteins that are 
inoculated during the vaccination. Because puppies lose their maternal 
antibodies at different rates, it is difficult to know whether a young puppy 
still retains maternal antibodies at the time he’s vaccinated. For this reason, 
vaccinating puppies against parvovirus several times during puppyhood is 
critical. The hope is that if maternal antibodies neutralized the first vaccine, 
the next vaccination will have the desired effect of stimulating the puppy to 
make his own antibodies.
 
Puppies should receive their first vaccinations against parvovirus at 5 to 7 
weeks of age. They then should receive booster shots every three to four 
weeks until they have had at least three shots. Your veterinarian will provide 
you with a schedule for your puppy’s vaccinations. Stick to the schedule as 
closely as possible. The virus is very stable in the environment and can 
survive for months on inanimate objects such as clothing and floors, making 
it even more important to vaccinate your dog against this virus.
Kennel cough
Kennel cough got its moniker for obvious reasons: Dogs commonly contract 
it from other dogs in kennels, and it causes coughing. Some vets are beginning 
to prefer the term canine cough, as your dog doesn’t have to be in a kennel to 
contract it.
 
Kennel cough, also called infectious tracheobronchitis, can be caused by a 
single virus or a combination of viruses, particularly canine adenovirus-2 
and canine parainfluenza virus. A bacterium called Bordatella bronchiseptica 
also can cause kennel cough alone or in combination with one or more of the 
viruses. Sometimes the viral infection impairs the normal defense systems of 
the lung, allowing bacteria to enter the lung, replicate, and cause pneumonia.

195
 Chapter 2: Vaccinations and Common Health Issues
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
Dogs infected with kennel cough have a dry, hacking cough that often has 
a honking sound. At the end of a series of coughs, the dog may gag or retch 
so severely that it seems as if the dog will vomit. Indeed, sometimes the dog 
brings up a little frothy material at the end of the cough. The coughing 
worsens if the dog is exercised or becomes excited. Dogs may also have a 
watery discharge from the nose or eyes. Kennel cough itself lasts from seven 
to ten days, and dogs recover without treatment. If a dog contracts a secondary 
bacterial pneumonia, however, the results can be much more serious and, 
without treatment, can result in death.
The infection is highly transmissible between dogs and can spread like 
wildfire through dogs in a kennel or at a dog show (hence the kennel part of 
its name). Dogs are infectious before they show signs of coughing, and 
sometimes even after they have recovered, so it is hard to prevent transmission.
The best prevention for kennel cough is vaccination. Because several agents 
can cause this infection, vaccination is not foolproof, but vaccinated dogs 
who do become infected usually have milder symptoms. The most effective 
vaccination protects against parainfluenza virus and Bordatella, and is 
instilled into the nose of the dog. This vaccine consists of a live virus that has 
been modified so that it cannot cause severe disease. It can, however, cause 
a mild cough for a few days after vaccination, and can even be transmitted 
to other dogs during that time. Because of these side effects, however mild, 
most veterinarians suggest vaccination only for dogs who are at high risk for 
infection. This category includes dogs who regularly go to dog shows, are 
boarded at kennels, attend doggie daycare, or commonly have contact with 
other dogs.
If your dog has a persistent hacking cough for more than 24 hours, call your 
veterinarian instead of going to the clinic. The doctor then can decide over 
the telephone whether you should come to the clinic and risk transmitting 
this highly contagious infection to other dogs in the waiting room or hospital. 
If he decides it is a case of kennel cough, he may want to examine the dog, 
prescribe some cough suppressants, and advise you to have your coughing 
canine rest for seven to ten days until she is better. If your dog is not eating 
or is lethargic, she may have a secondary bacterial infection. Your veterinarian 
will want to examine her and will probably prescribe antibiotics or an injection 
and other supportive care.
 
Some evidence suggests that Bordatella can be transmitted from dogs to 
immunosuppressed individuals, such as people who are taking immuno-
suppressive drugs after transplants or to fight cancer, or people suffering 
from AIDS. Keeping coughing dogs away from these individuals is probably 
best.

Distemper
Distemper is a vaccination success story. Once the scourge of the pooch 
population, now most people have never heard of a dog actually having this 
infection, because vaccination programs have been highly successful in 
reducing the incidence of the disease.
 
The canine distemper virus is particularly wily. The first thing it does after 
entering the body is spread in the blood to all the lymph nodes and kill the 
lymphocytes that reside there. Lymphocytes are the major cells for antiviral 
defense, so the infected dog becomes severely immunosuppressed (and at 
risk for many other illnesses). This action allows the virus to replicate in the 
lungs (and cause pneumonia) and the gastrointestinal tract (and cause 
diarrhea and dehydration), and even to enter the brain (and cause encephalitis, 
paralysis, and seizures). In addition, because the virus causes immuno-
suppression, infected dogs frequently contract secondary bacterial and 
parasitic infections that can also be life threatening.
 
The first signs of distemper may be a discharge from the eyes accompanied 
by a fever. The dog may also be coughing, exhibit weight loss, suffer from 
diarrhea, and lack interest in food. The signs of distemper are so varied 
that any young puppy who is sick should be taken to the veterinarian for a 
definitive diagnosis. About 50 percent of adult dogs and 80 percent of 
puppies who contract distemper die, and dogs who do recover often retain 
lifelong debilitations such as seizures, blindness, and lameness.
As with most viral infections, treatment for distemper is limited. With 
supportive care, some dogs can pull through, but the key to beating this 
disease is to prevent infection by vaccination. Inoculating puppies when 
they are still very young is important and effective.
Battling Bacteria
Bacteria are veritable giants in comparison to viruses. You can fit only 25,000 
bacteria (as compared to 25 million viruses) on the period at the end of this 
sentence. Bacteria differ from viruses, in that they can live on their own and 
don’t need a host cell to replicate.
Bacteria live in the soil, in plants, and in animals — including you. Although 
most species of bacteria are beneficial — or, at least, cause no harm — the 
following sections discuss a couple problems caused by some nasty bacteria.

Lyme disease
Lyme disease is a tick-borne bacterial disease that was first recognized in 
humans in Lyme, Connecticut, in 1975 and in dogs in 1984. The Lyme disease 
bacterium is transmitted to your dog by the tiny deer tick (shown in Figure 
2-1) and probably, although less commonly, by other species of ticks, too. 
Deer ticks live on white-tailed deer and white-footed mice in the wild. They 
are very small — no larger than the head of a pin — making them hard to see, 
especially in a dog’s thick coat. A dog’s greatest chance of becoming infected 
is from May to September, when the ticks are most active, but transmission 
can also occur at other times. Up to 40 percent of the deer ticks in the 
northeast, mid-Atlantic, north-central and Pacific coast of the United States 
contain the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.

Although many dogs get infected with the Lyme bacterium, only a few 
develop Lyme disease. Typical acute infection results in swollen joints, 
lameness, and muscle pain. However, the bacterium can also cause vague 

198
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
symptoms such as fever, loss of appetite, and lethargy, which can make 
infection difficult to diagnose in a timely fashion.
 
If your dog is suddenly lame without evidence of trauma; has a hot, swollen 
joint; or has a fever, especially if you know he was recently bitten by a tick, 
take him to the veterinarian. The vet will perform a complete physical 
examination and will take blood to be tested for antibodies to the Lyme 
bacterium.
 
If Lyme disease is undiagnosed or left untreated, permanent damage to the 
joints can occur, and the bacterium also can spread to the heart and kidneys. 
Infected dogs should be treated with appropriate antibiotics as soon as 
possible.
 
Prevention of Lyme disease requires a two-pronged attack. Vaccines are 
available to protect your dog from infection. The vaccine is unique because 
it actually kills the bacterium inside the tick before it ever gets a chance to 
enter your dog. However, as with all vaccinations, side effects may result, so 
discuss the pros and cons of vaccination with your veterinarian. Vaccination 
probably is a good idea for dogs who live in areas where Lyme disease is 
more common and for dogs who are frequently outdoors, like the one shown 
in Figure 2-2.

The second part of your Lyme disease prevention plan is to try to ensure that 
your dog doesn’t become exposed to the Lyme bacillus. Apply a product that 
repels ticks before your dog goes out for an adventure in the wild outdoors. 
Use a product your veterinarian recommends — repellents purchased at 
pet stores and grocery stores frequently are not as effective. Examine your 
dog daily for ticks during the spring and summer months, and remove them 
gently. To remove a tick, use tweezers to grab the insect as close to your 
dog’s skin as possible, and pull straight out, without squeezing or twisting.
Leptospirosis
Leptospirosis is another disease that, like distemper, used to be a major dog 
killer but has been very uncommon during the past three decades. We can 
thank effective vaccines for that. In the last three years, some unusual strains 
of leptospirosis were diagnosed in an increasing number of dogs. Veterinary 
scientists went to work and have now designed new vaccines to be effective 
against these canine killers.
 
Leptospirosis is caused by any one of about 200 different but related 
strains of bacteria. The bacteria infect many different species of wild and 
domesticated animals, including raccoons, skunks, opossums, and cattle. The 
infected animal sheds large numbers of bacteria in urine. Leptospira bacteria 
are specialists in water survival, so if the urine drains into standing water, 
these bugs can survive for a long time, just waiting for your dog to come 
along and have a drink. The bacterium then enters the blood stream and 
travels throughout the body to many tissues, where it replicates and causes 
damage. Leptospira particularly like to grow in the kidney and can cause 
severe renal failure in dogs. Of course, by replicating in the kidney, the 
bacteria has easy access to the urine so that it can be expelled to the 
environment and infect another unsuspecting animal. Pretty ingenious, huh?
The signs of disease in dogs include a sudden onset of fever or trembling, 
lethargy, nausea, jaundice, vomiting, and diarrhea. If the dog is not quickly 
treated with antibiotics, she may stop producing urine and hemorrhage into 
the lung and intestine. Luckily, with antibiotics and supportive care, most 
dogs recover, but complete recovery may take several weeks.
 
Leptospirosis also infects humans. Most people, just like dogs, get infected 
by exposure to urine from wildlife or farm animals. However, it’s also 
possible for dogs to transmit the infection to their people. In areas where 
leptospirosis outbreaks are occurring, keep pets away from children’s play 
areas, including sandboxes and wading pools.

Fighting the Fungus among Us
There’s a lot more to fungi than the fact that one of them provides a common 
pizza topping. Fungi inhabit soils throughout the world. Some inhabit the 
soil of the Mississippi Valley, the mid-Atlantic states, and southern Canada; 
others grow in soil contaminated with bird or bat excrement; and still others 
call the dry Southwestern soils home. Active dogs who spend a lot of time 
running outdoors (like the hunting dog in Figure 2-3), especially dogs who 
love to dig, risk becoming infected with fungal organisms that live in the soil. 
Usually a strong immune system will keep these bad bugs at bay. But if the 
dog is battling another infection or has a weak immune system, these 
organisms can get a foothold in the dog’s body and cause serious disease.
 
These fungal agents cause arthritis, pneumonia, infections in bones, and 
signs of systemic infection such as fever, loss of appetite, and malaise. No 
vaccines are available for these organisms. If you live in an area where fungi 
are present, the best way to prevent infection is to keep your dog from 
digging, especially around the holes of burrowing animals where the fungi are 
especially abundant. Also keep your dog away from areas frequented by large 
numbers of bats or birds.
Rickettsia: What a racket!
Rickettsia are poorly understood organisms 
that are intermediate in size, between viruses 
and bacteria. They live inside cells like viruses 
do, but they are susceptible to some of the anti-
biotics that kill bacteria. The two main rickett-
sial diseases of dogs are Ehrlichiosis and Rocky 
Mountain spotted fever. Both are carried by 
those diabolical disease-delivery units — ticks.
Ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted 
fever are both characterized by fever, rashes, 
anemia, hemorrhages, and joint and muscle 
pain in dogs. If your dog is ill for more than 24 
hours, particularly if you know a tick has bitten 
him, it’s a good idea to have a veterinarian give 
him the once-over. Only a vet can differentiate 
between these two diseases, which can appear 
quite similar clinically. Blood tests are required 
to make a definitive diagnosis, and even they 
aren’t foolproof. Treatment of rickettsial 
infections requires antibiotic treatment for six 
to eight weeks.

Preventing Parasites
Parasites are the ultimate opportunists, living on the skin, in the intestine 
and just about anywhere they can gain a foothold. Luckily, with today’s 
excellent veterinary preventive medicine programs, dogs don’t have to suffer 
parasitic infections. Parasite control is also important because some of them 
(roundworm and hookworm) can spread to humans.
Fleas
Fleas are the bane of a dog’s existence. They make him itch, itch, itch. And 
the more a dog scratches, the itchier he seems to get. These irritating insects 
can cause itching in two different ways. First, they bite on a big chunk of 
skin and start sucking blood. They stay at one spot until they are full, or 
hop around, drinking at many different sites. Worse, they often bite in thin-
skinned, sensitive areas such as near the ears, at the base of the tail, and 
in the groin area. Flea bites are irritating enough, but many dogs actually 
develop an allergic reaction to the saliva of the fleas and become extremely 

202
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
itchy all over, even with the bite of only one flea. Sometimes the allergy is 
so severe that a dog will chew at himself until he loses big patches of hair, 
bleeds, and ultimately develops thick, crusty skin, especially on his feet, at 
the base of his tail, and around his back legs.
 
If you see your dog scratching vigorously or biting aggressively at himself, 
it’s time for a bug check. Start by looking around your dog’s ears, at the base 
of his tail, and on his tummy. Part the hair and look for brown, flat, oval bugs 
about 1⁄8 inch long. Keep your eyes peeled, because a startled flea can jump 
quickly into the air and land several inches away. Frequently, you won’t 
actually see a flea, but you can see flea dirt stuck in the dog’s hairs. Flea dirt 
is a polite term for flea excrement, a crumbly black material that consists 
mainly of digested blood. You can identify flea dirt by placing a drop of water 
over the dirt, letting it soak up the water for a minute or two, and then 
smearing the dirt on a piece of white paper towel. A reddish smear confirms 
that it is, in fact, flea dirt.
If you identify a flea or flea dirt, leap into action. The only thing that will 
give your dog relief is ridding his body and your house of those pesky pests. 
You’ll be delighted to know that the solution may entail giving your dog a 
hot bath with anti-flea shampoo, applying an anti-flea treatment between his 
shoulder blades, administering pills, vacuuming every inch of your apartment 
or house, and spraying along the floorboards with another anti-flea product. 
With the many safe anti-flea products available today, your dog no longer has 
reason to suffer.
 
Fleas are especially fond of cats, so if you share your digs with an animal of 
the feline persuasion, be sure to include her in your flea prevention and 
treatment protocol.
Ticks
Ticks are major pests not only because they can bite your dog and cause 
local skin irritation, but because they carry a host of other pesky germs that 
can make both you and your dog sick (including the already-discussed Lyme 
disease). Ticks live on long grasses and shrubs, and they have a sticky 
substance on their bodies that enables them to easily cling to the fur of 
passing animals such as your dog. They then crawl down the hair to the skin 
and latch on, taking a big bite. They suck blood for hours and even days 
until they are full to bursting. During this time, they can transmit whatever 
infectious organisms they happen to be carrying.
If you live in an area where ticks are prevalent (most of the United States, 
except the Southwest and Alaska), check your dog for ticks every day, at 
least during tick season — usually the spring and summer months, but 
sometimes later depending on warm weather. Carefully remove every tick 
you find (see the earlier coverage of Lyme disease).

203
 Chapter 2: Vaccinations and Common Health Issues
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
 
If your dog enjoys the outdoors (and most dogs do), apply a product that 
prevents ticks from attaching to the skin. Be sure to get advice from your 
veterinarian on which product is best, because new products enter the 
market all the time. Also continue to check your dog from head to toe every 
time he comes in from outside. You’re most likely to find ticks around your 
dog’s face, eyes, and ears, although they really can be anywhere. Be sure to 
look inside the ears, too!
Worms
Dozens of kinds of worms can set up shop in your dog’s body, often in the 
intestine. Puppies are especially susceptible to infections with worms, 
because some species of worms are transmitted from the mother before the 
puppy is even born. For this reason, deworming puppies is very important 
(see Book II, Chapter 4).
The general level of care for dogs these days is so high, however, that adult 
dogs rarely have problems with worms (with the exception of tapeworms). 
Nonetheless, it is a good idea to bring a fecal sample to your annual veterinary 
visit every year, just to be sure.
 
If you adopt a dog from a shelter or find a stray, be sure to have her checked 
for worms, because you won’t know whether she has had adequate veterinary 
care from puppyhood.
Being Aware of Which 
Bugs Infect Humans
Just as we share our lives with dogs, we sometimes share our infections, too. 
Be aware of the potential transmission of organisms from dogs to humans, 
called zoonosis, so you can take preventive measures. The most important 
zoonotic disease in dogs is rabies, but dogs can unwittingly share many 
infectious organisms with us, including leptospirosis, roundworms, and 
hookworms.
 
Humans also can be infected by the canine roundworm Toxocara canis. If a 
human accidentally ingests Toxocara eggs, the eggs will hatch and larvae will 
migrate through the body, causing fever, rash, and cough. This condition is 
called visceral larval migrans. If the worm larvae migrate to the eye, they can 
cause blindness. Larvae can migrate through the spinal cord and brain, 
causing severe neurologic disease, too. These infections usually occur in 
children who live in conditions of poor sanitation. Toxocara eggs must 
mature in the environment for one to three weeks before they are infectious, 

204
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
so humans don’t become infected by handling dogs directly. They must 
contact eggs in the environment. Toxocara eggs are very hardy, however, 
and can survive in the environment for weeks or months.
 
Consider these tips to prevent human infection with Toxocara:
 
 Deworm all puppies, regardless of whether Toxocara eggs are detected 
in fecal samples, twice (21 days apart) during their initial vaccination 
period. Have the vet check multiple stool samples during puppy visits. 
Use a monthly heartworm prevention that deworms for roundworms.
 
 Do not allow children to play where dogs defecate.
 
 Always clean up after your dog in public places. And always wash hands 
with hot water before eating.
 
Several other infectious organisms can be transmitted from dogs to humans, 
but they infect only immunosuppressed humans, such as people undergoing 
cancer treatment or organ transplantation, and individuals with AIDS. If you 
are immunosuppressed and want to have a dog, your best bet is to get a 
clinically normal adult dog from a private family. If this is not possible, have 
a veterinarian give the prospective four-legged family member a thorough 
physical examination, complete with fecal and blood tests.
 
Intestinal parasites are dangerous. It’s very important that people who own 
dogs understand this fact about common intestinal parasites — roundworms, 
hookworms, whipworms, tapeworms, and to a lesser degree coccidia. Always 
follow the advice of your vet regarding deworming, even if a stool sample is 
negative.

A
ccidents happen to all of us, including our dogs. Although you can take 
some safety precautions to help your dog avoid these pitfalls, you can’t 
guarantee that she’ll never run into trouble. And that’s where knowing first 
aid comes in handy. In this chapter, you get everything you need to know 
to care for your dog when she’s injured or ill — from bites to breaks and 
everything in between. Read this chapter now, while your pooch is sleeping 
by your side. Don’t wait until you need it.
Being Prepared for an Emergency
One of the best things you can do to help your dog in the event of an 
emergency is to be prepared before the emergency strikes. Administering 
first aid is very difficult — if not impossible — without a few essential 
supplies. And you can do a lot beforehand to get to know your dog so that 
when you’re faced with an emergency, you’re ready to do what’s required.
Assembling a canine first-aid kit
Before you’re faced with an emergency, assemble two first-aid kits for your 
dog — one for your car and one for home. Always keep the kits in the same 
place so you can get your hands on one right away in an emergency.
 
Your first-aid kit doesn’t need to be big or expensive to be useful.

206
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Getting the container ready
Find a water-resistant container that’s large enough to carry everything 
without being cumbersome. Fishing tackle boxes work well because they 
have trays with dividers to keep things organized.
 
Put a large red cross and the words first-aid kit on each side of the container. 
Someone may need to locate and use it in an emergency, and labeling the kit 
clearly can be a big help. To the inside of the lid, tape a piece of paper with 
the following information in clear letters (do this for each dog):
 
 Your name, address, e-mail, and telephone number.
 
 The breed, name, and date of birth of the dog.
 
 Any medical conditions your dog has and any regular medication.
 
 Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of emergency contact 
people, in case you are incapacitated.
 
 Name, address, and telephone number of your veterinarian. Be sure to 
provide the contact information for your after-hours emergency clinic.
 
 Contact information for the National Animal Poison Control Center. 
You can reach the center at 888-426-4435, 24 hours a day, 365 days a 
year to inquire about the toxic potential of various household products 
and plants your dog may have found tasty. You also can get advice 
about emergency care for a dog who has gotten into a toxin. The cost 
per case is $60, which includes follow-up (including contacting your 
veterinarian, if you request), and is charged to a major credit card. To 
have the fee charged to your telephone bill (and avoid having to track 
down your credit card number in an emergency), dial 900-680-0000. For 
more information on the service, visit www.aspca.org.
 
 A list of the contents of your first-aid kit. For each of the drugs in the 
kit, have a note indicating the appropriate dose for each of your dogs. 
That way, you won’t have to do any calculations in your head in a time 
of crisis. When preparing the kit, be sure to check the doses with your 
veterinarian.
The information in this list can be useful at home as well as on the road. In 
addition to taping this list on the inside lid of your first-aid kit, include the 
following for the kit that you keep in your car:
 
 Your dog’s rabies certificate: Some states require that you have a rabies 
certificate at all times if you are traveling with a dog.
 
 A photograph of each dog, with her name, tattoo, and microchip 
number: This can help a rescuer identify each dog if you are incapacitated.
 
Keep these materials in a resealable plastic bag so they’re all together.

Knowing what to put in the first-aid kit
Following is a list of the components of an all-purpose first-aid kit and a brief 
description of what each item is used for. You can find most of these items at 
your local pharmacy; you can get the rest from your vet or dog supply catalog.
 
With time and experience, you may add other items to the kit, because you 
may find yourself using the kit for yourself and other humans in need. You 
may also find that you don’t need some of the items. Eventually, your first-aid 
kit will reflect you, your dogs, and your needs. But the following supplies are 
a good place to start:
 
 ACE brand elastic bandage: You can use this bandage to hold an ice 
pack to a dog’s leg, to wrap (not too tightly!) a sprain temporarily until 
you can get veterinary assistance, or to secure an injured dog to a 
makeshift stretcher.
 
 Adhesive tape: Use tape to secure bandages and splints. Make sure that 
you have a large roll, and replace it when it gets close to running out.
 
 Alcohol swabs: Look for individually packaged swabs, which you can 
use to sterilize instruments or small areas of skin.
 
 Aspirin (enteric coated): Give 5 milligrams per pound every 12 hours to 
temporarily relieve pain. Many dogs vomit after taking regular aspirin, 
so be sure to get the enteric-coated variety, which is gentler on the 
stomach. Or get NSAID from your vet, specially formulated for dogs.
 
 Never substitute ibuprofen or acetaminophen for aspirin. Both of these 
substances can be toxic to dogs.
 
 Bacitracin or Neosporin: Apply this or another antibiotic ointment to 
cleaned wounds that are likely to become infected.
 
 Never use these ointments in the eye. Special antibacterial formulations 
are used for the eyes — but use them only with your veterinarian’s 
recommendation.
 
 Benadryl: You can use Benadryl for insect bites or stings. Give your dog 
11⁄2 milligrams per pound, every eight hours.
 
 Cohesive bandage: Use this stretchy wrap to cover and secure gauze 
bandages. It clings to itself, so you don’t need adhesive tape.
 
 Cold pack: Use a cold pack to prevent or reduce swelling after a sprain 
or strain, or to treat burns. Buy the kind that gets cold when you fold it 
in half.
 
 Cotton squares: You use these to clean and protect wounds. They’re 
better for cleaning wounds than cotton balls because they don’t shed 
fibers when you wipe them over sticky areas, such as where blood is 
drying.

208
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
 First-aid instructions: Photocopy the pages of this chapter that discuss 
first-aid treatments and store them in your first-aid kit. When you’re 
trying to take care of a sick or injured dog, remembering all the details 
can be difficult.
 
 Gauze bandage roll: You use this wrap to bandage wounds and hold 
splints in place. Cut off a length of bandage and fold it up to cover a 
wound, or wrap the bandage around the leg to keep a cold pack in place 
or secure a splint.
 
 Gloves (latex): Any time you need to keep your hands protected or 
clean, wear a pair of latex gloves.
 
 Green Soap or Hibitane: You can use any gentle liquid antibacterial 
soap for cleaning skin and wounds. Betadine or iodine solution are good 
wound cleaning solutions.
 
 Hydrogen peroxide: Give your dog 1 to 3 teaspoons of hydrogen 
peroxide every ten minutes to induce vomiting. Don’t give more than 
three doses ten minutes apart, and don’t use it to clean wounds.
 
 Imodium A-D: Give your dog 1 milligram per 15 pounds once or twice a 
day to relieve diarrhea. May contain aspirin and irritate the stomach.
 
 Lubricating jelly: Use this item to lubricate a thermometer or to prevent 
gauze bandages from sticking to a wound. It also comes in individual 
packets.
 
 Muzzle: You can use a length of gauze bandage, a belt, or a soft rope to 
make an emergency muzzle. Even if your dog has never showed signs of 
aggression, if he is in pain or is frightened, he may snap at you or others.
 
 Needle and thread: For emergencies only! Use a needle and thread to 
stitch wounds (or — better — a surgical stapler purchased from your 
vet) when you know you won’t be able to get veterinary help within six 
hours. Bear in mind that your dog will not like (or perhaps allow) you to 
suture him. Clean wounds before closing them.
 
 NuSkin liquid bandage: Use for small, clean, recent wounds.
 
 Penlight flashlight: Use a flashlight to look down your dog’s ears or 
throat — anywhere you need extra light. You can also use it to check 
whether a dog’s eyes respond to light, in case of an injury to the head.
 
 Pepto-Bismol liquid: Give 1 teaspoon per 25 pounds every 6 hours to 
relieve diarrhea and vomiting. The liquid form works faster than the 
tablet form. May contain aspirin and irritate the stomach.
 
 Plastic bags (resealable): These bags are handy for temporarily 
packaging items that are leaking, protecting open packages from drying, 
or collecting specimens such as fecal samples.
 
 Razor blade (retractable) or blunt-ended scissors: Use these items for 
cutting bandages and tape and for trimming the hair around a wound.
 
 Safety pins: Use pins to fasten bandages if you don’t have tape.

209

 Sterile saline solution: Use to rinse out the eyes or to clean wounds.
 
 Stockinet or bootie: Put one on your dog to protect a bandage on a leg 
or foot.
 
 Styptic powder: Use to stop small areas of bleeding, such as when you 
accidentally clip your dog’s nails too close.
 
 Sun block: Apply to your dog’s nose or areas of light skin if your dog has 
a thin coat.
 
 Syringe: Use to flush a dog’s eye with saline or to administer peroxide.
 
 Thermometer (rectal): Use a thermometer made for dogs. A dog’s 
normal body temperature is between 100.5 and 102.8 degrees.
 
 Tweezers (flat-ended): You can use tweezers to remove foreign objects, 
such as ticks, thorns, and foxtails, from your dog’s skin.
 
Keep a blanket in your car at all times. You can use it to warm a dog suffering 
from frostbite, to wrap a dog who is in shock, or as an emergency stretcher.
 
Label each item in your first-aid kit with its name and expiration date. Go 
through your kit before trips and every year, replacing medications that have 
expired or for which the labels have become hard to read, and replenishing

Before an emergency happens, find out as much as you can about your dog’s 
anatomy and her inner workings so that you will be prepared to examine her 
and make decisions quickly, when necessary. Become familiar with these 
techniques now, before emergency strikes.
Taking your dog’s temperature
Know how to take your dog’s temperature quickly and without causing 
stress. You’ll need a rectal thermometer (a digital one is preferred), 
lubricating jelly, and a clean cloth:
 
1. If it’s not a digital thermometer, grip it tightly and shake it down until 
it registers below 98 degrees.
 
2. Dab some lubricating jelly onto the end of the thermometer.
 
3. With your dog standing or lying on his side, raise your dog’s tail and 
insert the thermometer into the rectum with a slow, twisting motion.
 
 Talk to your dog and praise him for remaining still. The first few times 
you do this, you may want to have someone give him a treat while you 
are inserting the thermometer, to keep his mind occupied.

210
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
4. After one minute, remove the thermometer slowly, wipe it with a 
clean cloth, and read the temperature.
 
 A dog’s normal temperature ranges from 100.5 to 102.8 degrees. The 
temperature can rise significantly after exercise, but it should return to 
normal within 20 minutes.
New electronic thermometers on the market allow you to take a person’s 
temperature by placing a plastic probe just inside the ear canal. Before you 
use one on your dog, ask your vet whether your model will work on dogs.
Counting your dog’s breathing rate
Become familiar with your dog’s breathing. Count how many times a minute 
she breathes while she’s resting and compare it to her breathing rate after 
she exercises. Most dogs have a resting breathing rate of 15 to 30 breaths per 
minute. The breathing rate may rise when a dog is in pain or has a fever.
Checking your dog’s pulse
When you check your dog’s pulse, locate the femoral artery, which lies just 
below the skin on the inside of the leg, between two large muscles where the 
leg joins the body. With your dog standing, reach around in front of the rear 
leg where it joins his body, and slide your fingers into the groin area. You will 
feel the artery pumping each time the heart contracts. When you have found 
the artery with your dog standing, try it with your dog lying on his side. 
Count how many pulses you feel in 15 seconds, and multiply by 4 to get the 
number of beats per minute.
Become familiar with your dog’s pulse rate and how his pulse feels when he 
is relaxed, as well as after exercise. Dogs normally have a pulse between 70 
and 120 beats per minute. In puppies, the pulse ranges from 120 to 160 beats 
per minute.
Examining your dog’s gums
Lift your dog’s lip and look at the color of the gums above an upper canine 
tooth — the gums should be pink. Press on the gums with your finger. When 
you remove your finger, the gums should briefly look white but should return 
to their pink color within two seconds. This is the capillary refill test.
 
If the gums are blue, the dog lacks oxygen. If they are white, the dog has 
lost blood, either internally or externally. If the gums are purple or gray and 
there is a slow capillary refill, the dog is probably in shock. If they are bright 
red, she may be fighting a systemic infection or may have been exposed to a 
toxin. Sometimes normal dogs have black-pigmented gums, which can make 
assessment more difficult. For these dogs, you need to examine the pink 
tissue on the inside of the lower eyelid by gently pulling down the eyelid. In 
this case, you can only observe the color of the tissue — you can’t perform 
the capillary refill test — but the colors in the preceding paragraph apply.

Knowing What to Do in an Emergency
Just as you need to have a first-aid kit assembled and know how to check 
your dog’s vital signs, you need to be aware of what to do in the case of an 
emergency. The following sections cover how to help an injured dog, how to 
give CPR, and how to treat common injuries and problems.
Approaching an accident scene
When you come upon an accident scene in which a dog has been injured, 
always be sure that you are safe before you try to help the dog. Every year 
people are killed on roads and highways because they put their own lives at 
risk to assist injured dogs or other animals. If the dog is in an unsafe area, 
secure the area and move the dog to a safe place before assessing her.
 
If other people are nearby, try to organize them to be a help rather than a 
hindrance:
 
 Ask a few people to keep passersby away from the dog.
 
 Ask one person to call a local veterinary clinic.
 
 Have another person arrange to transport the dog.
 
 You may also have someone assist you in performing CPR and have 
another person apply pressure to any wounds.
Handling an injured dog
Whenever you approach an injured dog, always start by protecting yourself 
from being bitten. If your dog is in severe pain and is afraid, even your best 
friend may bite the hand that feeds him. You can make a temporary muzzle 
out of a length of bandage, belt, shoelace, or pantyhose. If it turns out the 
muzzle wasn’t necessary, your dog will forgive you for having used one. If it 
was necessary, you’ll be glad you had the foresight to protect yourself.
 
To apply a muzzle, follow these steps:
 
1. Approach the dog slowly, using a soothing tone of voice.
 
2. Bring the bandage (or other material) up under the dog’s chin about 
halfway between the leather of the nose and his eyes.
 
3. Tie the two ends in one loop on top of the dog’s nose.
 
4. Bring the bandage back under the dog’s chin and tie another single 
knot under the chin.

212
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
5. Bring the two ends of the bandage to the back of your dog’s neck 
behind his ears and tie them in a bow.
 
6. Tie the loops of the bow into another single knot to keep the muzzle 
securely fastened.
The muzzle should be fairly tight, enough that your dog cannot open his 
mouth, but not so tight that it impedes breathing.
Examining an injured dog
When your dog is injured or ill, your primary job is to remain calm and be 
deliberate in your actions. Try to keep your voice from revealing the fear you 
may feel inside. Use the A-B-C checklist outlined in the following sections 
whenever you come upon a scene in which a dog is seriously injured and 
appears to be unconscious or in shock. Even if the dog has a bleeding wound, 
carry out this preliminary assessment first. Respiratory and circulatory 
problems usually are more life threatening than wounds. When you are 
certain the dog is breathing and is not in circulatory collapse, you can deal 
with the wound.
Airway
If the dog is unconscious and has no apparent neck or back injuries (excluding 
bleeding wounds), tilt her head back slightly, open her mouth, and look 
inside for any objects that may be impeding airflow. Gently pull her tongue 
forward (holding the tongue is easier if you grab it with gauze or cloth) and 
check for objects that may be deeper down the throat. Pulling the tongue 
forward also opens the airway, making breathing easier.
Breathing
 
Check for the rise and fall of the chest that indicates the dog is breathing. If 
the dog is not breathing and the airways are clear, begin rescue breathing 
immediately:
 
1. Cup your hands around the muzzle and seal your lips around the edge 
of the leathery part of the dog’s nose.
 
2. Breathe into the dog’s nostrils for two seconds.
 
3. Watch for the dog’s chest to rise, indicating that air is entering the 
lungs.
 
4. If the chest doesn’t rise, check the airway again.
 
 Repeat for a total of three breaths.

213
 Chapter 3: Canine First Aid
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
 
Give gentle puffs of breath (the amount depends on the dog’s size). Your 
lungs are much bigger. Don’t blow as though you’re trying to inflate a 
balloon.
Circulation
Assess circulation by checking the pulse at the femoral artery. If you haven’t 
practiced on your dog before, see the earlier section, “Checking your dog’s 
pulse.” A healthy dog’s pulse is approximately 10 to 14 beats per 10 seconds 
and feels strong. (Smaller dogs have a more rapid pulse.) If the pulse is there 
but feels weak, the dog is probably in shock.
 
If you have trouble feeling the pulse in the groin, place your thumb and 
fingers on either side of the chest wall just behind the elbows to see if the 
heart is beating. If you detect no pulse or heartbeat, begin CPR immediately 
(see following section).
Examine the dog’s gums to check circulation, too. If the gums are blue, the 
dog may not be getting enough oxygen. Be sure that you’ve checked the 
airway and cleared it of any foreign objects. If the dog has a weak or rapid 
pulse; shallow breathing; gray, purple, or pale gums; or glazed eyes, or if 
he exhibits weakness or collapses, he is in shock and you should make 
arrangements to get him to a veterinarian as soon as possible. In the meantime, 
keep him quiet, cover him with a blanket, and keep his head as low as the 
rest of his body. If the dog is not breathing or you cannot feel a pulse, 
begin CPR.
Administering CPR
If your dog is not breathing or doesn’t have a pulse, follow these instructions 
to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR):
 
1. Position the dog on her side.
 
2. Clear the dog’s mouth of any foreign matter (see Figure 3-1).
 
3. Hold the muzzle closed with your hands and give mouth-to-nose respi-
ration at 12 to 15 breaths per minute (see Figure 3-2).
 
 Watch for the chest to rise, to be sure that the air is getting into the 
lungs. If the chest doesn’t rise, check again for anything that may be 
obstructing airflow.

4. Begin chest compressions.
 
 With a large dog, kneel at the dog’s back. Push the dog’s uppermost 
front leg forward, out of the way. Lay one hand over the other and 
compress the chest wall over the heart (right about where the dog’s 
elbow would be with the leg at rest) with the heel of your hand (see 
Figure 3-3). Push gently, and then let go immediately. For a very small 
dog (one weighing less than 30 pounds), lay the dog on her right side, 
place your thumb and fingers on either side of the chest, and compress 
from both sides.
 
 Regardless of the size of the dog, do 60 to 80 compressions per minute 
(approximately one compression a second). Don’t compress the chest 
for more than a split second, or the heart won’t have room to beat. If 
you’re alone, give one breath and then five chest compressions. If you 
have help, one person can perform mouth-to-nose respiration while the 
other compresses the heart. In that case, give one breath for every three 
to four chest compressions.
 
Compress at approximately the speed of the beat from the Bee Gee’s “Stayin’ 
Alive” or Queen’s “Another One Bites the Dust.”

Giving first-aid treatment
When you’re sure that an injured dog is breathing and has a pulse, you can 
start attending to his injuries. The following sections cover some common 
injuries and problems requiring first aid.
 
Knowing these first-aid techniques should help you in an emergency. But this 
is first aid — basic techniques to help you aid your dog before you can get 
veterinary assistance. First aid is not a substitute for the care and expertise of 
a veterinarian.
Allergic reactions
In addition to normal allergic reactions (like itching and sneezing), some dogs 
may experience more severe symptoms, including the following:
 
 Hives or swelling of the muzzle: Some dogs respond to an allergen with 
swelling of the face or bumps that appear over a large part of the trunk. 
You may also see the dog biting or licking at herself, or she may have 
red, weeping eyes. Apply a cold pack to the swollen area if it is small. If 
the swelling continues or covers a large area, administer Benadryl (at 
1 to 11⁄2 milligrams per pound) and contact your veterinarian. Check 
respiration periodically, because there may also be swelling of the 
throat, which can impair breathing.
 
 Shock: Signs of shock include weak or rapid pulse; shallow breathing; 
gray, purple, or pale gums; glazed eyes; weakness; or collapse. Lay 
the dog on her side and cover her with a blanket. Administer CPR, if 
necessary. Transport the dog to a veterinarian as soon as possible.
Bleeding
 
Blood from an artery is bright red and sprays from the vessel in time with 
each beat of the heart. A dog can lose a great deal of blood quickly if an 
artery is cut. Blood from a vein or from small vessels under the skin is 
burgundy in color and pours slowly or seeps from the wound.
To stop bleeding, apply pressure to the wound with a piece of gauze or cloth 
for several minutes. Even if the gauze is soaked with blood, don’t lift it to see 
if the bleeding has stopped, because the gauze actually helps clot the blood. 
Just add extra layers of gauze. Depending on the area of the body and the 
size of the wound, it may take 10 to 15 minutes for bleeding to stop.
 
If ice is available, place it around the area of the wound to slow blood flow. 
When the bleeding has stopped, you can bandage the wound (see the 
“Wounds” section later in this chapter) and arrange to get the dog to a 
veterinarian.

Only use a tourniquet in extreme emergencies, because it can cut off 
necessary circulation to the area. See a vet immediately after use.
Broken bones
When your dog has a fracture, the goal is to stabilize her until a veterinarian 
can examine her and treat the injury. A broken bone is very painful. Fractures 
are sometimes obvious, such as when the leg is lying in an abnormal position 
or a piece of bone is poking through the skin. But sometimes a fracture may 
be present when the leg looks only swollen. If you try to move the bones, you 
may feel a grinding caused by the broken ends of the bone rubbing against 
each other.
 
If veterinary care is available, do not apply a splint. Carefully place the 
dog on a firm, level surface and take her to the clinic. If you are far from 
veterinary help, the leg should carefully be splinted before your dog is 
moved. The best splint is something rigid but padded, such as a board 
wrapped in a towel. The splint should be placed against the dog’s limb, 
avoiding movement of the bones as much as possible. The leg and joints 
above and below the break should be taped or wrapped to the splint. (Do not 
bandage fractured ribs, spine, or pelvis.) Transport the dog to a veterinary 
clinic as soon as possible.
 
A fracture is a partial or complete break in a bone. Fractures are classified by 
severity, and the same classifications apply for both dogs and people:
 
 Greenstick fracture: The least serious fracture is the greenstick fracture, 
in which one side of the bone is broken but the other side is just bent. 
The two ends of the bone are not moved from their original positions. 
This type of fracture is seen more often in young, growing dogs because 
their bones are less brittle than those of adult dogs. A dog can walk 
(though gingerly) on a leg with a greenstick fracture; only X-ray can 
diagnose this kind of fracture.
 
 Complete fracture: A complete fracture is one in which the bone is 
broken through its width. Generally, the two ends of bone are moved 
from where they should be, because contractions of the muscle move 
the broken pieces of bone away from their original location. A complete 
fracture is more serious than a greenstick fracture; the damage to the 
bone is greater, and the surrounding muscles and maybe even ligaments 
and tendons are usually damaged. Complete fractures can be one of 
three types:
 
• Simple, with just two pieces of bone
 
• Comminuted, with many pieces of bone
 
• Compound, with skin punctured by pieces of bone

218
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
 No matter what kind of fracture it is, a veterinarian must return all the 
pieces of bone to their original location before healing can begin.
Burns
Dogs are most often burned when hot or caustic (strong acids or cleaning 
solutions such as lye) liquids are spilled on them. Burns may also result 
when a dog gets too close to a candle, a stove, or a fire. Some dogs can even 
get a blistering sunburn, especially on a sunny day after winter. Heating pads 
may cause burns.
 
Burns are classified by degrees, depending on their severity:
 
 First degree: The hair is singed and the skin may be reddened.
 
 Second degree: The hair is burned off and the skin is red and blistered.
 
 Third degree: The skin is black, brown, or white. If the third-degree burn 
is extensive, the dog may go into shock.
 
If a caustic liquid caused the burn, wipe or rinse off the liquid before treating 
the burn. For all burns, follow these treatment suggestions:
 
 Minor burns (first and second degree): If the burn occurred within the 
last hour, apply a cold pack for 20 to 30 minutes and then treat the burn 
as a superficial wound (see “Wounds” later in this chapter).
 
 Severe burns (third degree): If your dog permits, apply a cold pack or 
a cold, wet cloth to the area; cover the area gently with gauze; and take 
him to the veterinarian as soon as possible.
 
Never apply ointments or butter to severe burns, and never touch the skin or 
rub anything on it.
Choking and the canine Heimlich maneuver
Dogs are ever curious — and second only to their noses, they use their 
mouths to investigate new and interesting things. Dogs can choke on just 
about anything, but the most common offenders are small balls such as golf 
and squash balls, rawhide and bones, cellophane, and plastic children’s toys. 
A dog who is choking makes retching motions and looks panicked, often 
pacing back and forth and pawing at her mouth. Her chest may be heaving, 
but she isn’t making any airway noises.
 
If you suspect that your dog is choking, first examine her mouth. Pull the 
tongue forward and remove the foreign object, if possible. If you can’t see 
the foreign object, use the canine Heimlich maneuver to try to dislodge the 
object:

219

 For large dogs: Stand behind your dog and place your arms around her 
body. Make a fist with one hand, and place the thumb of the hand with 
the fist against your dog’s abdomen just where the sternum ends. With 
the other hand, grasp your fist and push upward and forward (toward 
the dog’s shoulders), suddenly and forcefully (see Figure 3-4). Do this 
thrusting motion four or five times. Check the dog’s airway again and 
clear any debris from the mouth. Repeat the chest thrusts, if necessary. 
If the dog is unconscious, clear the airway and perform rescue breathing.
 
 For small dogs: Hold the dog with her head up so that her spine is 
against your chest. Make a fist with one hand, and place it against your 
dog’s abdomen just where the sternum ends (see Figure 3-5). Grasp the 
fist with your other hand, and give four or five rapid thrusts inward and 
upward. Check the dog’s airway again and clear any debris from the 
mouth. Repeat the chest thrusts, if necessary. If the dog is unconscious, 
clear the airway and perform rescue breathing.

Cold exposure
Hypothermia is a lowering of the dog’s body temperature caused by cold 
exposure. Dogs don’t suffer from hypothermia very often because they carry 
their fur coats with them everywhere they go. However, if a dog is wet or he 
has a very thin coat, he may get cold quite easily. A dog’s first response when 
cold is to shiver. Later the dog may act lethargic and become unresponsive.
 
If you recognize that your dog has hypothermia, follow these suggestions:
 
 Move the dog to a warm environment and cover him with a blanket.
 
 Rub his body (not his legs) gently, to increase circulation.
 
 If he’s wet, dry him with towels or a blow dryer on medium heat.
 
 Take your dog’s temperature to monitor his recovery.
 
 Offer warm sugar water if the dog is conscious.
 
Do not apply heating pads or hot water bottles directly to your dog’s skin.

221
 Chapter 3: Canine First Aid
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
 
If the dog begins to lick his paws or appears uncomfortable, he may have 
frostbite. Restrain him and place warm compresses on the affected area.
Diarrhea
If you have a dog long enough, you’ll have to deal with diarrhea eventually. 
Diarrhea can be caused by a dog’s propensity to eat garbage or rotten animals, 
by a viral, parasitic, or bacterial infection, or sometimes just by stress.
 
If your dog has diarrhea, withhold food for 24 hours in adults or 12 hours in 
puppies (younger than 6 months). Instead of giving water, offer the dog ice 
cubes so that she takes in the water slowly. Some vets don’t recommend 
this, but you can administer Imodium A-D (1 milligram per 15 pounds once or 
twice a day) and/or Pepto-Bismol (1 teaspoon per 25 pounds every six hours) 
to help calm an upset stomach and stop diarrhea. For the next 72 hours, 
feed a bland diet (75 percent rice, 25 percent low-fat protein such as skinless 
chicken) in small but increasing amounts. Then shift to the dog’s regular diet 
over the next two days.
 
If your dog has bloody diarrhea, is depressed and dull, or continues to 
have diarrhea for 24 hours while you are withholding food, take her to a 
veterinarian.
Drowning
Most dogs are excellent swimmers. Occasionally, however, a dog drowns 
because he gets caught in something underwater or gets overwhelmed by 
an undertow. Sometimes a dog who is an experienced swimmer drowns 
inexplicably. Some breeds have trouble swimming and may drown in shallow, 
safe water. Bulldogs, Pugs, and Pekingeses all have bodies that can make 
swimming difficult.
 
The first thing to do when you have brought the dog ashore is to empty the 
lungs of water. If the dog is small, elevate his rear end and water will drain 
out of the dog’s mouth. If necessary, you can hold the dog upside down and 
swing him gently until the water is expelled. Pumping the chest and opening 
the mouth periodically may be helpful as well. If the dog is large, try to sling 
him over your shoulder so that the head, front legs, and chest hang down 
in front of you and the rear legs hang down your back. When the water is 
expelled, start rescue breathing. When the dog is breathing on his own, wrap 
him in a blanket and transport him to a veterinarian immediately.
Ear infections
Chronic ear infections are extremely uncomfortable to dogs and can ultimately 
affect hearing and balance. If your dog has ever had an ear infection, check 
her ears weekly and keep them clean — this is the best way to prevent infec-
tions and to recognize them quickly when they do occur.

222
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
To clean the ears, moisten a cotton swab with alcohol or hydrogen peroxide 
and clean the outer ear, making sure to clean around all the bumps inside the 
ear and down into the ear canal. Don’t go farther into the canal than you can 
see — you don’t want to risk breaking the eardrum. There are ear-cleaning 
solutions designed to break up wax and dry the ear canal. If the ear is truly 
infected it probably needs topical medicine to treat the specific type of 
infection — yeast or bacteria. If your dog has hair in her ear canal, pluck it to 
help with air circulation.
Electric shock
Occasionally, a dog (usually a puppy) bites down on an electric cord and 
suffers an electrical shock, often accompanied by burns. The dog may be 
unconscious and have burns around his mouth and on his tongue.
 
If you find your dog unconscious near an electrical cord, turn off the power 
to the socket before touching your dog. Examine the dog, using the A-B-C 
protocol described earlier in this chapter. Administer CPR if the dog is in 
shock or unconscious. When the dog is conscious, give first aid for burns and 
get him to your vet immediately.
Eyes
The eyes are very delicate and easily injured, especially in dogs who love to 
play in the great outdoors.
 
Dogs who run through fields may get dust or grasses in their eyes. The best 
solution is to wash the eye with sterile saline. Hold your dog’s eye open and 
gently pour the saline over the surface of the eye. Using a penlight flashlight, 
examine the insides of the lids to be sure that you removed the offending 
particles. If repeated flushing doesn’t help, get your dog to a veterinarian.
 
If a foreign body is penetrating the eye or the skin near the eye, do not touch 
it. Stop the dog from pawing at the eye by taping her hind legs together or 
using an Elizabethan collar (the “lampshade” — a wide cone-shaped collar 
that prevents the dog from being able to scratch her head). You can make a 
temporary collar by cutting a head-size hole in the bottom of a bucket and 
placing the bucket over her head, fastening it to the dog’s collar. Then get 
your dog to a vet immediately.
Fishhooks
Every now and then, a dog playing near a fishing pond gets stuck with a 
fishhook left by a careless fisherman. As you can imagine, a fishhook can be 
very painful, particularly if the hook is in the foot and the dog has come 
running to you or tried to remove it with his mouth.

223
 Chapter 3: Canine First Aid
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
 
Start by calming the dog with gentle words and quiet motions. Getting your 
veterinarian to remove the hook is best, but if you have no access to a 
veterinarian, you can push the hook through the skin until the tip and barb 
come back out. Then cut off the hook and barb and back the rest of the hook 
out the way it came. Treat the hole as a wound (see “Wounds” later in this 
chapter).
 
If your dog swallows a fishhook, cut off most of the remaining fishing line, 
leaving approximately 12 inches dangling. Do not attempt to dislodge the 
fishhook by pulling on the line. Take your dog to a veterinarian immediately. 
Do not allow your dog to eat in the meantime.
Foxtails
Foxtail plants grow by roadsides and in fields throughout much of the United 
States. Dogs sometimes inhale or swallow their seeds in their exuberance 
outdoors. Foxtail seeds have a long, barbed appendage so that they can stick 
in the hair and even penetrate unbroken skin. When the seed is in your dog’s 
body, it travels from place to place, damaging tissues and causing infections. 
If you live in an area with foxtails, always examine your dog’s susceptible 
parts (nose, throat, armpits, and between the toes) thoroughly after she has 
been outdoors. Use tweezers to gently remove any foxtail seeds you find.
Heatstroke
The temperature doesn’t have to be very high for a dog to suffer heatstroke. 
Working sled dogs in Alaska begin to suffer from the heat at 20 degrees 
because of their level of physical activity. Dogs are descended from wolves, 
animals who evolved in northern climes and, thus, have not developed 
natural mechanisms to fight the heat. As a result, they, like their wolf ancestors, 
don’t have very good heat-control mechanisms. Breeds with flat faces, such 
as Bulldogs and Pugs, can suffer heatstroke even on mild days. Puppies also 
are more susceptible to heatstroke.
 
More dogs die of heatstroke in cars than any other way. Even on a mild day, 
the temperature in a car in the sun can rise to over 100 degrees in a matter 
of minutes. Every year, thousands of dogs die of heatstroke after being left in 
cars for “just a minute.”
 
Never leave your dog in the car in the summer, even with the windows down. 
And never leave your dog in a yard without shade in the summer.
A dog suffering from heatstroke pants heavily and salivates excessively. His 
eyes may be glazed and he staggers or acts listless. The dog’s pulse also feels 
rapid and weak.

224
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
If you suspect that your dog is suffering from heatstroke, you must act 
quickly. Move the dog to a cool area indoors, or at least to the shade. 
Submerge him in cool water (not ice water) and apply cold compresses to his 
head. Take his temperature to monitor his body’s cooling. Keep him wet until 
his temperature reaches 103 degrees, and then remove him from the water 
and dry him off. Encourage but do not force him to drink water. Get him to 
the veterinarian as soon as possible.
Hot spots
Hot spots are localized areas of skin infection that are usually round, red, and 
warm to the touch. They can start very quickly and grow to several inches in 
diameter in a day or two. The infection is exacerbated by the dog’s scratching 
or chewing.
 
The first thing to do if you identify a hot spot is to clip the hair away from the 
area, if possible. This is the best way to prevent the infection from spreading. 
Once or twice a day, wash the area thoroughly with liquid soap and apply 
an astringent. The best astringent is tea (green or black). Wet a tea bag and 
apply it to the area. Keep applying the astringent several times a day until 
the area is dry and covered with a scab — usually 24 to 36 hours. After the 
area is scabbed, let it heal, but watch it carefully, in case the infection begins 
to spread again. Keep the dog from scratching or biting at the area while it 
is healing; you may need to use an Elizabethan collar (see the “Eyes” section 
earlier in this chapter for more information). If you cannot get the hot spot 
under control in 36 hours, see your veterinarian, who may prescribe oral 
antibiotics and/or anti-inflammatory agents to treat it.
Insect bites
Many insects bite or sting, so becoming familiar with the ones that live in 
your area is a good idea. That way, you may be able to prevent your dog from 
exposure to these bugs.
 
Usually an insect bite appears as an area of swelling. If the bite is from a bee 
or a wasp, remove the stinger. If it is from a tick that is still attached, use 
tweezers to grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible and pull gently 
until it lets go (see Book II, Chapter 2 for more information on removing 
ticks). Apply a cold pack if the swelling is severe.
Poisoning
Many poisons lurk in houses, yards, and the environment, and their treatments 
can differ greatly.
 
If you suspect that your dog has been poisoned, contact your veterinarian 
immediately for instructions. If you cannot reach your veterinarian, call the 
National Animal Poison Control Center at 888-426-4435 for help.

If you know that your dog ingested the poison within the last hour, induce 
vomiting by pouring 1 to 3 teaspoons of hydrogen peroxide into his mouth 
between the cheek and the back teeth (or by squirting it with the first-aid 
syringe in your first-aid kit). If the dog hasn’t vomited within ten minutes, 
repeat. Do not use hydrogen peroxide more than three times at ten-minute 
intervals.
 
Do not induce vomiting if the poison is unknown, corrosive, or a petroleum 
product, or if the animal is not completely conscious.
 
Wash the skin if the toxin can be absorbed through the skin.
Porcupine quills
Porcupines roam the woods on sunny days in the winter — and some curious 
canines just can’t mind their own business. The result is usually a face full 
of painful porcupine quills. If you find your dog in this kind of a fix, first calm 
the dog as best you can (porcupine quills are very painful, and dogs tend 
to scratch and paw at their faces) and transport her to your veterinarian as 
soon as possible. The vet will anesthetize your dog and remove the quills 
while she is in Dreamland. If veterinary assistance is not available, muzzle 
the dog and have someone hold her while you pull the quills quickly straight 
out, not at an angle. Feel the skin for deeply embedded quills and look in the 
mouth for quills, too — a veterinarian should remove these quills.
 
Never remove quills from the eye. If your dog has a quill in her eye, calm her 
down (it is very painful) and tie her legs together to prevent her from pawing 
at the eye. Protect the eye until you can get her to a veterinarian.
Seizures
Seizures in dogs have many causes, from trauma, to tumors, to poisoning. In 
some dogs, seizures occur periodically for unknown reasons (in a condition 
called idiopathic epilepsy). Take action when a seizure occurs:
 
 Sit with your dog during the seizure, talking soothingly to him.
 
 Restrain him only if necessary to keep him from hurting himself. During 
the seizure, he will have uncontrollable movements and may defecate or 
urinate.
 
 Keep your dog quiet for 30 minutes after the seizure.
 
 If the seizure lasts longer than five minutes or recurs within two hours, 
take your dog to a veterinarian.
 
Do not attempt to pull the dog’s tongue out or in any way get near the mouth, 
because severe bites can occur.

226
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
If your dog has a seizure, take him to a vet or (better yet) a veterinary 
neurologist for evaluation.
Snake bites
The most common poisonous snakes in North America are the rattlesnake, 
the cottonmouth, the coral snake, and the water moccasin. If poisonous 
snakes live near you, find how to identify them and stay away from them. 
Consider taking your dog to a snake-proofing session, where she will be 
taught to stay away from snakes. You can obtain information from your local 
dog club.
 
If your dog is bitten by a poisonous snake, do this:
 
1. Restrain and calm your dog, to slow uptake of the venom.
 
 Arrange for the dog to get to a veterinarian immediately.
 
2. Allow the snake bite to bleed freely for 30 to 60 seconds, and then 
cleanse and disinfect the area.
 
3. Place gauze over the wound and apply pressure.
 
 If the wound is on a leg, leave gauze over the wound and wrap the leg 
with cohesive bandage tightly, but not tight enough to cut off circulation.
 
4. Take the dog to a veterinarian immediately.
 
Do not cut into the wound caused by a snakebite. Do not apply suction to the 
wound. And do not apply a tourniquet.
 
If you and your dog hike frequently in snake-infested areas, talk to your 
veterinarian about whether you should carry an antivenin with you.
Spinal injury
 
If you suspect that your dog has suffered a spinal or neck injury, be very 
cautious about moving him, or you could further damage the spinal cord and 
cause permanent paralysis or even death.
Muzzle your dog and slide him gradually onto a flat surface such as a board 
or a piece of heavy cardboard. Secure the dog to the makeshift stretcher 
with wide strips of tape or an ACE brand bandage, and transport him to the 
veterinarian immediately.
Sprains and strains
 
A sprain is a stretched or torn ligament and a strain is a torn or overused 
tendon, but the results of both are swelling and inflammation in the area of 
damage.

227
 Chapter 3: Canine First Aid
Book II

and Health
The key to treating these injuries is to get ice onto the affected area 
immediately. Apply the ice for 20 minutes, remove the ice for 20 minutes, 
and then apply ice again for 20 minutes. The ice helps reduce the swelling 
and keeps further damage to a minimum.
 
Try bandaging the ice onto the affected area if your dog doesn’t want to let 
you hold the ice on her body for that long.
Take your dog to a veterinarian if you suspect a fracture or if your dog 
doesn’t bear some weight on the leg within an hour or two. The dog should 
rest for at least 48 hours after the injury — no running or playing, just short 
walks on a leash to go potty. If the dog is still limping after 48 hours, she 
should be seen by a veterinarian.
Wounds
In their enthusiastic love of life, dogs can get themselves into some fixes. 
They may run into tree branches or rub against sharp objects. They may 
even get in an occasional fight and end up a little worse for the wear. So 
knowing what to do for your walking wounded canine is important.
Wounds fall into two main categories: shallow and deep. Shallow wounds 
involve just the skin; deep wounds penetrate to the muscles and other 
tissues below the skin.
Shallow wounds
 
To treat a shallow wound, follow these steps:
 
1. Wash your hands thoroughly.
 
2. Use cotton pads and mild antibacterial liquid soap to clean the wound 
thoroughly.
 
3. Rinse the wound with sterile saline solution.
 
4. Apply antibacterial ointment to the wound.
 
5. Cover the wound with gauze, wrap it with a bandage, and cover it 
with a cohesive bandage (but not so tight that you cut off circulation).
 
 You can slip a stockinet or bootie over a foot and secure it with tape for 
extra protection.
 
6. Periodically feel your dog’s toes.
 
 If they become swollen or cool to the touch, remove the bandage and 
reapply it after the swelling has diminished.

228
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
If the wound is small and clean, you can use NuSkin to glue the ends of the 
wound together. It works just like sutures.
 
Cuts that may require sutures should be examined by a veterinarian 
immediately. If a cut is more than about six hours old, it should not be 
sutured closed because it almost certainly is contaminated with bacteria 
from the environment. Suturing the wound closed would just trap the 
bacteria within the wound, resulting in infection and increased scarring. An 
older cut should be thoroughly cleaned and allowed to heal gradually as an 
open wound. If the wound is large, it may be partially sutured and a drain left 
in to help the infection escape.
Deep wounds
 
To treat a deep wound, do this:
 
1. Stop the bleeding by applying pressure.
 
2. When the bleeding has stopped, bandage the wound and seek 
immediate veterinary treatment.
If your dog becomes lost
First of all, you should have your dog “chipped” 
at the vet. An ID chip is a tiny electronic chip 
implanted under your dog’s skin. When your 
dog is found and taken to the pound or a vet, 
staff members can scan the chip and get your 
contact info. Of course, your dog also should 
be wearing an ID tag with your name, phone 
number, and address. Some chips come with a 
tag that gives the chip number, which you can 
read over the phone to the dog pound when 
someone finds your dog.
Some people even make up some generic 
“Missing dog” posters ahead of time and keep 
them with emergency supplies. In the biggest 
type size you can, center the words LOST DOG, 
along with a clear picture of your dog. Beneath 
that, provide a description of your dog, including 
any identifying marks. Leave a space to add 
the phone number where you can be reached, 
along with any backup contacts, friends, 
relatives, neighbors, or your veterinarian. Print 
a hundred copies and keep them in a safe place.
A staple gun allows you to post your notices 
on anything wooden or cardboard in your 
neighborhood; keep a loaded staple gun with 
your supplies, along with thumbtacks and 
electrical tape.
If your dog becomes lost, post the flyers in 
your neighborhood and beyond, and distribute 
them at veterinary hospitals and shelters. While 
relying on the kindness of strangers is nice, 
offering a reward can make many strangers 
just a little bit kinder.

 Taking your dog for an annual checkup
 Neutering your dog
 Knowing what to look for when choosing a vet
 Allaying your dog’s fears about trips to the vet’s office
 Taking advantage of special payment and savings plans
Just a few decades ago, to make it to adulthood, puppies had to avoid or 
successfully battle deadly diseases such as distemper, rabies, hepatitis, 
and leptospirosis. And fleas were a part of every dog’s life — along with the 
scratching, infections, and allergies that accompany those irritating insects. 
But scientists and veterinarians have worked hard to develop vaccines 
that prevent canine infectious diseases and to design ways of keeping dogs 
healthy and prolonging their lives.
One of the most important things you can do to keep your dog healthy is to 
develop a relationship of mutual respect with a veterinarian. Knowing that 
you and your veterinarian are partners in maintaining your dog’s health 
and in caring for your canine companion when he has problems can be a 
tremendous relief. This chapter gives suggestions on establishing this kind of 
relationship — from choosing a vet to making your dog feel good about going 
there. You also get some great ideas for tackling the often-expensive costs 
involved with keeping your dog healthy.
In this chapter, you also find out what you can do to prevent disease, and 
that often involves taking the dog to the veterinarian. Following these 
suggestions gives your dog a better chance of living a long and healthy life, 
which means more time for you to play fetch, teach him tricks, run with him, 
let him lick your face, and more.

Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Knowing What to Expect from 
the Annual Checkup
Taking your canine companion for a thorough veterinary checkup once a 
year is one of the most important things you can do for her. Even though 
your dog may seem to be the picture of health, a veterinarian often can 
detect early signs of disease or organ malfunction before your furry friend 
shows any outward signs of problems. Your veterinarian also can help you 
prevent common canine conditions, treat new problems early when treatment 
is most effective, or institute measures to prevent a condition from becoming 
worse.
 
Before your annual veterinary appointment, make notes of any changes in 
your dog’s health or behavior. Jot down any questions you have about your 
dog’s care. These notes will help you provide a complete description of your 
dog’s health history so you can get answers to your questions — and so 
you’re not left saying, “I know there was something I was going to ask, but I 
can’t remember what it was.” Bring a pen and paper to the appointment to 
take brief notes about your veterinarian’s recommendations — they can be 
hard to remember later.
 
Take advantage of your veterinary appointments. Ask questions and be sure 
that you understand the answers. Use these meetings as an opportunity to 
work with your veterinarian to promote your dog’s health and longevity. 
If your dog is found to be healthy at the annual checkup, don’t feel you’ve 
wasted your time and money. Instead, count your blessings.
A thorough veterinary examination should contain all the components 
covered in the following sections.
Health history
The veterinarian should ask whether you have observed any changes in your 
dog’s overall health. Now is your opportunity to ask questions and express 
any concerns you may have with respect to your dog’s health or behavior. 
You may want to point out any skin lumps you’ve found, discuss changes in 
your dog’s food or water intake, or ask about his urination or bowel habits.
 
If a specific problem has prompted your visit, bring a written history of the 
problem. If your dog has been vomiting periodically, for example, record the 
date the vomiting first began; how often your dog has vomited; when (in 
relation to eating) he vomited; and the amount, color, and texture of the 
vomited material.

Physical examination
Your veterinarian has been trained to perform a detailed physical examination 
of your dog. As he performs the examination, he is thinking about the 
dog’s entire body and is trying to determine whether every organ system is 
functioning at its peak. The veterinarian should look in your dog’s mouth, 
eyes, and ears, and he should run his hands over your dog’s body, feeling 
for abnormalities in the size or shape of lymph nodes and abdominal organs. 
He should listen to your dog’s heart and lungs with a stethoscope, take your 
dog’s temperature, and weigh her.
 
Don’t talk to your veterinarian or rub your dog while he’s listening with his 
stethoscope. It makes it hard for the vet to hear your dog’s lung and heart 
sounds.
Heartworm check
Heartworms are parasites that live in dogs’ hearts and cause heart failure. 
Mosquitoes transmit larval heartworms from one dog to another by sucking 
the blood of an infected dog, and then regurgitating a little blood when they 
bite the next victim. Heartworm disease exists in most areas of the United 
States and in southernmost Canada. In some areas, such as the southeastern 
United States, a large percentage of dogs who do not regularly receive 
heartworm preventive medication are infected. Preventing this disease is 
critical because, when a dog becomes infected, treating adult worms in the 
heart requires intensive care and can be life threatening.
Several excellent products are available for preventing heartworm infection. 
Before a dog is placed on a heartworm preventive, however, a blood sample 
must be tested to make sure that the dog is not already infected. This simple 
test can be done in your veterinarian’s office while you wait. In northern 
areas, where temperatures reach freezing, dogs need to take a heartworm 
preventive only during the spring, summer, and fall — after the test shows 
they aren’t infected. Many vets recommend that dogs be given a heartworm 
preventive year-round.
 
Dogs on heartworm preventive should still be tested every year, just in case 
the medication was forgotten or was ineffective for some reason.
Most heartworm preventives are given monthly. The pills are so tasty that 
you can just drop one in your dog’s food bowl and he’ll gobble it up. A 
heartworm preventive can be given to a puppy with his first set of vaccinations. 
A heartworm test isn’t necessary for a puppy under 3 months of age.

232
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Blood chemistry, urinalysis, 
and vaccinations
If your veterinarian notices anything abnormal during his physical 
examination of your dog, he may take a blood and/or urine sample to 
perform biochemical tests. These tests can detect infections and malfunctions 
of the liver, kidney, pancreas, muscle, thyroid, and other organ systems.
Many vaccinations are administered annually, so having your dog vaccinated 
during the annual checkup makes sense. See Book II, Chapter 2 for more on 
vaccinating your dog.
Choosing the Right Vet 
for You and Your Dog
Choose a vet for your dog in the same way you choose a doctor for yourself. 
Just as you probably wouldn’t have much luck choosing your physician from 
the Yellow Pages, you have better ways of finding a veterinarian than turning 
to the phone book.
 
Personal references from friends and acquaintances or your dog’s breeder, 
if she lives nearby, can be very helpful in making your selection. Ask your 
friends whether their veterinarians have been able to make a diagnosis 
when their dogs haven’t been well. If their dogs had surgery, find out whether 
the recovery was uneventful and complete. Also find out whether their 
veterinarians discussed the dogs’ illnesses and treatments, and whether they 
answered questions thoroughly.
 
When you’ve compiled a short list of possible veterinarians, call and make 
an appointment to see each of them without your dog. Tell them you want 
to meet them, tour their clinics, and discuss your dog’s care. Look for the 
following qualities when choosing a veterinarian for your dog:
 
 Someone who can diagnose: Your veterinarian should usually be able 
to give you a diagnosis after she has examined your dog and performed 
the necessary tests. She may not always come up with a single diagnosis, 
but she should have a list of possibilities and a plan for how to differentiate 
between those possibilities. And if your veterinarian doesn’t know the 
diagnosis or can’t answer the questions you have, she should at least be 
able to offer you an explanation of her thought processes and plans for 
further evaluation.

233
 Chapter 4: Preventing and Treating Diseases: Working with Your Vet
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
 
 Someone you can communicate with easily: Your veterinarian 
should be willing to answer your questions and should be able to 
explain, in terms you understand, both your dog’s diagnosis and her 
recommendations for treatment and follow-up care. Your veterinarian 
should be willing to listen to you and shouldn’t ignore your observations 
regarding your dog’s health. She should work with you as a partner, as 
someone who can help her work to improve your dog’s health.
 
 Someone who works in a modern facility: Your veterinarian should 
have a modern, clean facility with capable veterinary assistants and 
access to a diagnostic lab that can provide the results of most tests 
within 24 hours. She should have staff on the premises 24 hours a day 
to care for seriously ill dogs, or she should be able to move seriously ill 
dogs to a 24-hour emergency facility for overnight care and observation. 
Your veterinarian should be available during emergency hours or should 
be able to refer you to an emergency clinic for problems that occur at 
night or on weekends.
 
 Someone who is willing to make referrals: Your veterinarian should be 
willing to refer your dog to a specialist for further evaluation. She should 
not be threatened if you ask for a referral to obtain a second opinion 
about your dog’s condition.
 
 Someone who has specific interests and specialty training: Every 
veterinary professional has areas of special interest. Perhaps your 
veterinarian is especially interested in working with dogs. Maybe she 
has a particular interest in your breed of dogs. Not all veterinarians 
enjoy or are equally talented at performing surgery. And that’s okay. 
But because many dogs need surgery at some time in their lives, you 
need to know how comfortable your veterinarian is with surgery — what 
surgical procedures she performs and what kinds of cases she refers to 
a specialist. Ask her about the surgeons she refers to. Do the surgeons 
work in the same practice? If not, do they visit the practice to perform 
surgery, or would you have to transfer your dog elsewhere?
 
Don’t wait until your dog is ill to find a vet; get the facts and start developing 
a working relationship with a veterinarian while your dog is healthy. When 
you visit a veterinary clinic, watch the staff. It always is a good sign when the 
receptionist and technical staff enjoy being with dogs and work well together.
 
Don’t choose a veterinarian on the basis of the prices she charges for her 
services. Veterinarians have a great deal of time and money invested in their 
education, clinic, and equipment. A veterinary clinic has very high overhead 
because of the cost of maintaining assets and equipment (the building, the 
surgical and anesthetic equipment, an X-ray machine, ultrasound equipment, 
and so on), and the cost of top-notch personnel to care for your dog and to 
assist with surgery. A veterinarian who consistently charges less for her 

234
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
services than other vets in the same area is probably cutting corners 
somehow, perhaps in a way that can affect your dog’s care. To get the best 
healthcare for your dog, expect to pay for it.
Above all, when choosing a vet, trust your instincts. If you feel uncomfortable 
talking freely with a particular veterinarian, if you are concerned about the 
care your animal receives, or if for some reason your dog takes a strong 
dislike to a particular vet, search for another veterinary partner.
Neutering Your Dog
Every year in the United States, millions of unwanted dogs — both mixed 
breed and purebred — are put to death. The reason: supply and demand. 
More puppies are born than there are lifetime homes available. Some 
unwanted litters are produced by accident (many dog owners don’t realize 
their dogs can start having puppies by 5 or 6 months of age); some litters are 
just the result of well-intentioned but misinformed people. A common reason 
given by the people who fall into the latter category is that they want their 
children to see the “miracle of life” in person, by allowing their dog to have 
a litter of pups. But what they may not think about ahead of time is the fact 
that the birth of puppies is not always a beautiful experience, especially if a 
puppy or the bitch dies in the process.
 
If you want to teach your children a wonderful lesson about the animal 
population, teach them the importance of spaying and neutering pets, and 
take them to visit your local Humane Society or animal shelter so they can 
see firsthand how many dogs are in need of a good home.
Some people who buy purebred dogs believe they can recover the purchase 
price of their dog by breeding it — and maybe make a little pocket change 
at the same time. But this idea is a fallacy; the cost of providing for a litter of 
puppies until they find new homes can outweigh the purchase price of the 
dog. It often eats up most of the profit from the sale of a litter, too.
 
The bottom line? Having a litter consists of either weeks of intensity or a 
lifetime of responsibility. If you’re ready for this, be sure to join your local 
breed club, where you’ll find many other individuals who will be glad to help 
you with all the details of making puppies. If you aren’t ready for the work 
involved, get your dog spayed or neutered. If you are really interested in 
breeding, take a look at Book II, Chapter 7.
The only way to be sure that your dog doesn’t produce puppies is to get your 
female dog spayed or your male dog castrated. Failing to do so can lead to . . . 
well, you know. Intact male dogs and bitches in heat have an uncanny way of 
finding each other, and a breeding can occur in a snap.

235
 Chapter 4: Preventing and Treating Diseases: Working with Your Vet
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition

Spaying involves removing both the uterus and the ovaries. Castration refers 
to removing a male dog’s testicles. The term neutering is a general term to 
describe either spaying or castration (but you may hear the terms neutering 
and castrating used to mean the same thing — neutering certainly sounds less 
horrible).
In addition to preventing unwanted puppies, neutering your dog has many 
benefits:
 
 Female dogs who are spayed before their first heat cycle (which 
usually occurs between 6 and 9 months of age) have a significantly 
reduced chance of developing mammary (breast) cancer, compared to 
dogs who have had even one heat cycle.
 
 Spayed females can’t develop pyometra, an infection of the uterus that 
can be quite severe and can even result in death.
 
 Spayed females tend to have more even temperaments and do not 
go through the hormone-induced mood swings that intact bitches 
sometimes have.
 
 Neutered dogs often are better behaved than their intact counterparts. 
Not only are they less likely to roam (visiting neighborhood females is a 
major reason for roaming), but they are also less likely to mark their 
territory by urinating in the house (testosterone is one of the major 
drives for this dominance-related activity). In addition, neutered male 
dogs are much less likely to be aggressive toward other male dogs. 
These behavior benefits are particularly true if you castrate your dog 
between the ages of 9 and 12 months, before he becomes sexually 
mature and develops bad habits.
 
 Neutering reduces the incidence of prostate problems often seen in 
older dogs.
 
 A neutered dog won’t develop testicular cancer, a common cancer of 
older, intact male dogs.
 
Male dogs who lift their legs to urinate don’t leave urine burns in the middle 
of the lawn because they usually urinate on trees, fence posts, and other 
vertical objects around the perimeter of the yard. If you prefer that your 
male dog lift his leg rather than squat to urinate, wait until this habit is well 
established before getting him neutered.
 
Many people think their dogs will get fat if they are spayed or castrated, but 
this isn’t the case. Neutered dogs frequently don’t need as much food as their 
intact compatriots, but a simple solution is useful if yours does: Don’t feed 
him as much.

236
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Depending on your locale and the veterinarian you select, castrating a 
male dog can cost between $100 and $150, and spaying a female dog costs 
between $150 and $200. This cost is an incredible bargain, given that the 
bill for a woman’s hysterectomy costs upward of $10,000. For people on 
public assistance, people with lower incomes, and seniors on fixed incomes, 
spay/neuter clinics in most towns and cities can provide the service for a 
drastically reduced fee. These clinics usually are sponsored by animal 
shelters and veterinarians as part of an ongoing effort to control the local 
pet population. To find out when these clinics are held in your area, contact 
your local animal shelter. But costs can vary widely — always find out what 
services are included so you can compare apples to apples.
The gory details
Neutering a male dog involves surgically 
removing the testicles with a relatively simple 
operation. When you make an appointment 
to have your dog castrated, your veterinarian 
will ask you not to give your dog any food or 
water after 8 p.m. the night before the surgery. 
(Keeping your dog from eating or drinking 
decreases the likelihood of the dog 
regurgitating during surgery.) The veterinarian 
will anesthetize the dog and make a tiny 
incision in the skin just in front of the testicles. 
The testicles are then slid up under the skin 
and removed through this little slit. The skin is 
sutured with three to five sutures. Your dog is 
then allowed to wake from the anesthesia and 
to rest overnight — either at the veterinarian’s 
office or at your home — after the surgery.
Spaying a female is more involved than 
neutering a male because it involves opening 
the abdomen. As with any general anesthetic, 
the veterinarian will ask you not to give your 
dog food or water after 8 p.m. the night before 
the surgery. After your dog is anesthetized, the 
veterinarian will make an incision in the center 
of her abdomen. He will find the uterus and 
ovaries and cut them out, first making sure 
that all the blood vessels are clamped off so 
they don’t bleed. In a young dog, the blood 
vessels are tiny and are easy to clamp off. 
After a female has been through a heat cycle, 
however, the vessels are larger and require 
special attention so they don’t bleed. This 
is why spaying a dog after her first heat is 
usually more expensive. If a bitch is pregnant, 
the vessels are very large and are full of blood 
to feed the growing puppies; therefore, some 
veterinarians refuse to spay a pregnant bitch 
(sometimes requested to prevent the birth of 
puppies) because of the danger of postoperative 
bleeding. After removing the uterus and 
ovaries, the veterinarian sutures the abdominal 
incision and the dog wakes up. She then may 
stay overnight at the clinic to make sure that 
she rests and doesn’t stress the incision in the 
early stages of healing.
For the first couple days after surgery (whether 
for castration or spaying), your dog should rest 
and should go outside only for the bathroom. 
For the next week, mild exercise such as 
on-leash walking is all right. About ten days 
after surgery, the veterinarian will check to 
make sure that the incision is healing prop-
erly and will remove the sutures (or check on 
self-dissolving sutures).

Helping Your Dog Enjoy 
His Trip to the Vet
You just love going to the doctor or dentist, don’t you? Well, many dogs 
hate visiting the vet. And it’s really not surprising, given the fact that their 
associations usually are negative.
Think how a routine veterinary checkup (see Figure 4-1) must appear to your 
dog. First, he has to wait in a small room full of dogs, cats, and other animals, 
most of whom are extremely fearful. Then he is led into a strange room and 
is placed on a cold, slippery table. Next, a stranger who smells like a mixture 
of soap, chemicals, and other animals touches him all over his body, looks 
in his mouth and ears, and sticks a cold glass thermometer up his rear end. 
To top it all off, the stranger usually pokes him with at least one needle, often 
more.

You can take some steps to ensure that your dog’s veterinary experiences 
are good ones. Consider these ways to prevent your dog from developing a 
fear of his trips to the vet:

238
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
 Occasionally drop by the vet’s office with your dog when you don’t 
have an appointment. Bring your dog into the office and have the 
receptionist give him a cookie or two. Chat for a while and then leave. 
This way, your dog will learn to view the vet’s office as a fun place, 
instead of a place where he only gets poked and prodded.
 
 Make sure that your dog gets experience riding in the car just for fun. 
If he rides in the car only when he has to see the veterinarian, he soon 
will become fearful as soon as he gets in the car.
 
 Schedule your veterinary appointments for a time when there are 
fewer dogs in the office, if you can. This reduces the social stresses 
on your dog and reduces your time in the waiting room. If your dog is 
particularly worried while he’s in the waiting room, stay with your dog 
in the car until the veterinarian is ready to meet with you (you can run 
in and let the office staff know you’re in the parking lot and have them 
come get you when they’re ready).
 
 Bring an ample supply of treats with you. Give your dog a treat for 
entering the door and another for sitting with you quietly. Train your 
dog in the basics of obedience — he’ll feel more secure if he is asked to 
do something familiar (like “sit” and “stay”) during this stressful period. 
During your office visit, ask the veterinarian to give your dog some 
treats periodically, especially just before she examines your dog or 
before she does something stressful such as inserting the thermometer.
 
 Don’t mistakenly praise your dog for being stressed. Many people 
make the mistake of trying to comfort their dogs when they act fearful 
in the veterinary office. Your dog may interpret this attention as you 
praising him for his worry. You’re better off ignoring him when he acts 
worried, and praising him and giving him treats for even small acts of 
boldness.
 
Start these preventive measures from the very first visit. Don’t wait until your 
dog shows signs of fear.
Covering the Costs
If your dog gets sick, will you be able to pay the bill? Treating a simple 
infection can cost hundreds of dollars, and cancer treatment routinely costs 
thousands. Of course, you want to provide the best treatment possible for 
your furry friend, but top-notch veterinary care comes at a price. Before an 
accident or a sudden illness has you emptying your savings account or, 
even worse, opting for euthanasia because of a lack of funds, consider the 
alternatives in the following sections and see if one of these options is right 
for you.

Personal savings plans
The best way to make sure that you’ll always have funds available to pay 
veterinary bills is to set up a canine cash reserve. If you deposit $30 to $50 a 
month in a savings account in your pet’s name, you’ll be surprised by how 
much you can save. In a year or two, you’ll have enough to pay the bill for 
most serious illnesses. Save the spare change you collect at the end of the 
day, and you’ll have all your dog’s healthcare covered.
You can use your canine cash reserve to pay for all your veterinary bills, or 
you can set it aside for any expenses over a certain amount (such as $200). 
The money will continue to grow throughout your dog’s life, and you will 
have a substantial sum accumulated when your dog is older (when she’s 
more likely to require more expensive treatments).
 
The only disadvantage of this system is that you have to have the discipline 
to make it work.
 
Don’t wait until the last minute to come up with funds to pay your dog’s 
medical expenses. If you put $2 of change a day into a savings account, at the 
end of three years, you’ll have saved more than $2,000 — enough to pay for 
your average catastrophic illness.
Pet insurance
Obtaining pet insurance is one way to ease veterinary sticker shock. 
Insurance companies charge annual premiums of between $150 and $300 for 
a healthy adult dog. Basic coverage for puppies is slightly less, and when 
your dog reaches 8 years of age, the cost of coverage rises incrementally as 
your dog gets older. Basic plans usually don’t cover routine preventive care, 
although such coverage may be available for an extra charge. The basic plans 
are designed to cover a percentage of the veterinary charges for unexpected 
illnesses. They don’t cover preexisting conditions or hereditary diseases. So 
if your dog has hip dysplasia, for example, surgical or medical treatment to 
ease his pain would not be covered. But if your furry friend were hit by a 
car or decided to eat a dish towel (yes, dogs have done that), the costs of 
veterinary care would be covered (after paying a deductible) up to a 
maximum amount for that condition.
 
Making sense of the deductions, maximums, exclusions, and other 
insurance lingo can be tough, so be sure to read the insurance company’s 
literature carefully before signing on the dotted line. If you have any questions 
about what will and will not be covered, speak to an insurance company 
representative. Don’t hesitate to ask whatever questions you have about the 

240
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
coverage you’re considering. Think about some of the illnesses your dog 
(or one of your previous dogs) has suffered and ask what percentage of the 
charges would be covered. Using a real-life example will help you understand 
exactly how much you will be responsible for and determine whether the 
cost of the insurance is worth it.
 
If you keep good financial records, you can add up how much you spent on 
veterinary care during the last five years and calculate how much you typically 
spend on veterinary care every year. Take a look also at how much you have 
saved to deal with a catastrophic illness so that you can determine whether 
you may benefit from pet insurance.
Clinic-based HMOs
For a number of years, individual clinics have offered well-care plans, in 
which clients pay a monthly fee and receive discounts on routine care and 
preventive maintenance such as annual checkups, vaccinations, fecal exams, 
deworming, and heartworm checks. Some programs also offer member 
discounts on dental cleaning and surgical spaying or castrating.
Prepaid healthcare programs offer a way of spreading out (and perhaps 
reducing) the costs of routine veterinary care, but they generally do not 
cover hereditary diseases, preexisting conditions, or catastrophic illness. In 
addition, they cover your pet only for care provided in that specific practice. 
So if your pet gets ill while you’re on vacation, or if he requires the care of a 
specialist not in that practice, you’re on your own.
 
If you are considering taking advantage of a comprehensive preventive care 
program, do a little math to figure out whether it’s right for you. Make a list 
of all the preventive care services you would normally avail yourself of in a 
year, and add up the cost of those services. Then compare that number with 
the cost for the services offered by the clinic’s well-care plan. Clinic-based 
plans often provide a significant discount to clients who want to provide the 
most complete preventive care for their furry friends.
Pet-care credit companies
Several credit companies offer credit to cover unexpected veterinary fees. If 
your dog suddenly becomes ill or has an accident and you’re short on funds, 
this option can save your dog’s life. Unlike pet insurance, credit companies 
do not require you to sign up ahead of time (although your veterinarian must 
be registered with the company), and there are no exclusions or deductibles.

241

To take advantage of this service, you just fill out a credit application, which 
your veterinarian transmits to the lender. If the application is approved, your 
veterinarian is paid within 48 hours, and a payment schedule is established 
for repayment of your loan.
 
Of course, all this credit comes at a price. These companies generally charge 
18 to 24 percent interest (similar to what you may pay in interest on a credit 
card debt), making them an expensive prospect if you have to make payments 
over a long period of time. Nonetheless, this option is available if the only 
other choice is euthanasia.
 
Another option, which gives you more power over the interest you pay, is 
to keep a major credit card with no balance, to ensure that you have enough 
money to pay for emergencies.

T
housands of years ago, for better or for worse, dogs linked up with 
humans (see Book I, Chapter 1 for more on this story). Overall, the 
marriage has been a great success for both parties. But one of the sacrifices 
most dogs have made is the ability to go outside and run free any time they 
want. Wolves often cover 100 miles a day while hunting and exploring; with 
most people leading very busy lives and working outside the home, dogs are 
lucky to do one mile on a leash every day, and most don’t even get that.
Exercise offers tremendous physical and psychological benefits for your 
dog — and for you, too. With all the companionship your dog provides, she 
deserves to get the exercise she craves. This chapter tells you how to give 
your dog the hard body she has always wanted — even if you work all day, 
are disabled, or just plain don’t have the energy.
Recognizing the Benefits of Exercise
Exercise provides immense physical and psychological benefits to dogs of all 
ages. Dogs who exercise regularly live longer, remain healthier, and are more 
active in their later years. With regular exercise, your dog will become stron-
ger and more coordinated, and his muscles will become more powerful and 
ready to kick into action any time. Strong muscles stabilize the joints, slowing 
the progression of arthritis. Exercise strengthens the heart and the lungs as 

244
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
well, improving the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to tissues throughout 
the body. Exercise is also an excellent way to control your dog’s weight; 
strong muscles are larger and utilize more calories while at rest than smaller 
muscles do.
Runners and other fitness buffs have long recognized the psychological 
benefits of exercise. It causes the brain to release endorphins, biochemical 
messengers within the brain that induce a feeling of euphoria and overall 
well-being. So exercise (and the good feeling it brings) can prevent a dog 
from developing problems such as lick granulomas (sores caused by repeated 
licking or chewing at the skin), destructive behaviors (chewing the corners 
of your new couch or digging up your tulip bulbs), restlessness, or excessive 
barking.
 
In fact, exercise is so important to a dog’s psyche that it’s the first line of 
treatment for most behavioral problems. Dog behaviorists claim that lack 
of exercise is a significant contributing factor in over 50 percent of all 
behavioral problems in dogs.
Despite all the benefits of exercise, most dogs in North America do not get 
enough. If your dog spends so much time lounging that he’s starting to look 
like part of the furniture, it’s time to get him on his feet and out of the house. 
Do it gradually, however. Just as you wouldn’t head out the door to run a 
marathon without any training, you shouldn’t expect your couch potato dog 
to be able to exercise for hours without building up to that level.
 
If your dog is seriously overweight (more than 20 percent heaver than his 
ideal weight), get the thumbs up from your veterinarian before you start him 
on a serious exercise program. Your vet should give your dog a physical 
examination, with special emphasis on the heart, lungs, and musculoskeletal 
system, to be sure that he’s ready to up his activity level.
If you start your dog’s exercise program slowly, increase the amount of 
exercise gradually, and use common sense, your dog faces only minimal risk 
of injury. To be safe, overweight dogs should not do much running with quick 
turns or jumping until they have slimmed down.
 
If your dog shows signs of fatigue such as excessive panting, grimacing, or 
scuffing the toes, ease up or stop altogether. Dogs who have a tendency to go 
until they drop definitely need guidance about when to stop.
 
To remain fit and content, a dog should get a minimum of 15 minutes of 
exercise a day and should have a longer exercise period two to three times a 
week. Be creative with your dog’s exercise. This is a time when you and your 
dog can get to know each other better — make the most of it!

245
 Chapter 5: Getting the Lead Out: Exercising Your Dog

Try to provide a mix of both strength-training and endurance-training exercises. 
Like humans, dogs have a mixture of muscle fibers — some for strength and 
some for endurance. These fibers use energy differently and are called upon 
in different circumstances. Exercises such as retrieving and chasing, which 
involve many starts, stops, and turns, help build strength. Exercises such 
as trotting, in which the dog moves continuously for at least 20 minutes, 
build endurance. Dogs benefit most if you build both their strength and their 
endurance muscles.
 
If you are a fitness buff, be sure to not overexercise your dog. During sustained, 
repetitive physical activity, lactic acid builds up and breaks down muscle 
cells. Cells need 48 hours to repair themselves. So if you run with your dog 
beside you on a leash for more than 30 minutes, give your canine athlete a 
day off between runs to recover.
Being Creative with Your 
Dog’s Exercise Routine
Does the word exercise evoke images in your mind of runners with sweaty 
shirts, glazed eyes, and sore feet? Don’t worry, you can exercise your dog 
without sweating beside your panting pup over miles of hot pavement. You 
have at your disposal many more interesting and effective ways to give your 
dog the exercise she needs. With a little imagination, you can invent a variety 
of exercises and games that will build your dog’s strength and endurance and 
that you’ll both enjoy. Exercise takes a little time, but the payoff is enormous 
in terms of your dog’s health and vitality, her confidence and behavior, and 
your relationship with her. Besides, who among us can’t use a few moments 
of stress-free playtime during the day?
 
Inject a little variety into your playtimes. After all, too much of even a fun 
game gets boring. Play different kinds of games in different locales, at 
different times of the day, with different treats for rewards.
Instinctive activities
Often the activities that are the most fun for dogs (and their humans) are 
those that imitate the dog’s natural drives and instincts. When your dog 
plays fetch, she imagines herself as a mighty hunter, chasing her prey 
and bringing it home to the pups. For dogs with herding instincts, such as 
Shelties and Collies, it’s the chasing part that’s fun, not the capture. They 

246
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
bring the ball back so they can chase it again. A pair of dogs often exercises 
each other, alternating between being the chaser and the chasee. Terriers 
and other dogs originally bred to hunt vermin love to play games with a 
killing theme. Nothing feels quite as good to a Terrier as chasing a stuffed 
toy, capturing it, and shaking it to break its neck.
 
You can harness a dog’s latent herding instinct by inventing chasing games. 
One fun game is to have your dog sit and stay in the middle of a soccer field, 
place yourself approximately three-quarters of the way to the goal, release 
your dog, and start running. See which one of you gets to the goal first. Be 
sure to handicap yourself, if necessary, so your dog wins about half the time.
 
You also can recapitulate vermin-catching games for your Terrier. Drag a 
bone or a toy over the ground for 25 feet or so, and then bury it in an area of 
the garden that’s okay to dig in. Watch your Terrier’s face beam as you take 
him to the beginning of the scent trail and encourage him to “find the rat.” 
To a Terrier, there’s no delight quite like that of finding the prey and digging 
it out.
Walking
Many people derive great pleasure from a daily walk with the dog. For some, 
this means an early morning amble through the neighborhood, with the dew 
on the grass and the birds chattering in the trees. For others, it’s a chance 
to put on the headphones, crank up the music, and forget the day’s stresses. 
Most dogs enjoy walks because of their natural curiosity about the environment. 
They love to be surrounded by new sights and smells. You may find it kind 
of frustrating, however, to stop at each vertical object along the way so your 
dog can exchange pee-mail with the other dogs in the neighborhood. 
 
Always carry a plastic bag and pick up after your dog (and remind your dog 
walker or pet sitter to do so, too). Just slip your hand in the bag, grab the 
dog poop, and then turn the bag inside out over your hand and tie it in a 
knot. Find a trash can to deposit your package in, or throw it out when you 
get home. Your neighbors will appreciate your thoughtfulness and you will 
feel good knowing that you’re doing your part to keep the neighborhood dog 
friendly. In many locales, this is not just a good idea — it’s the law.
 
Try a waist leash, a belt to which you can attach your dog’s leash. Walking 
or running with your dog when your hands are free to swing at your sides is 
much easier than having to hang on to a leash the whole way.

Jogging and running
Jogging or running is probably the best way to ensure that both you and your 
dog are getting enough exercise. Most runners are consistent — they go on 
their daily runs regardless of weather or schedule. This consistency is best 
for your dog.
Running with your dog offers many benefits:
 
 It’s excellent exercise.
 
 Your dog learns to stay at your side, regardless of distractions.
 
 If you run on a hard surface, your dog’s nails don’t have to be trimmed 
often (or at all) because the pavement will naturally file them for you.
 
 It’s a great way of bonding with your dog.
 
Though you may run 3 miles or more when you exercise, don’t start your dog 
at this rate. She needs to gradually build up tolerance to this distance. Start 
her at 1 mile and, over a period of two weeks, gradually increase her exercise 
tolerance to match yours.
 
Don’t feed your dog within an hour before or after strenuous exercise. Some 
dogs are prone to bloat (a twisting of the stomach due to gaseous intake).
Skijoring
Skijoring — in which your dog pulls you over the snow on skis — is a great 
winter variation on taking a walk. If your dog gets a bit carried away or you 
are a cautious skier, you can also cross-country ski with your dog running 
beside you.
 
Running in deep snow is very strenuous, so reserve skijoring for dogs older 
than 2 years of age.
 
Some dogs get snowballs between the pads of their feet when they play in the 
snow. You can reduce this problem by trimming excess hair from the bottom 
of your dog’s feet and between his toes. You also can apply petroleum jelly 
or cooking spray liberally to the skin between his toes before going outside. 
Another excellent fix is to have your dog wear booties, which are available 
at pet supply stores and through companies that sell products for mushing 

248
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
dogs. If your dog runs mainly on packed snow, get booties made of polar 
fleece. If he runs on mixed snow and gravel or pavement, get booties made 
of a tougher fabric, such as canvas or Cordura nylon. Booties can also be an 
excellent aid for the city dog who feels the sting of salt spread on the streets 
and sidewalks in the winter.
Fetch
Fetch is a favorite game of many dogs. Most people are fond of this game 
because they can play it while standing still. You can use many different fetch 
objects, from a simple stick to a ball or a disc. Some balls glow in the dark or 
have an internal flashing light, so you can even use them for a quick game of 
fetch when you get home from work on a dark winter night.
Bumpers (plastic cylinders that float and have a rope attached to one end) 
are a favorite fetch toy for many Retrievers, especially for retrieving on 
water. The rope makes them easier to throw, too. Many dogs like to chase 
flying discs as well. The way the disc floats in the air and changes directions 
is very exciting to the canine hunter.
 
Be careful when playing fetch with a flying disc. Throw the disc just above 
the ground so your dog doesn’t have to leap up to catch it. Dogs can suffer 
severe injuries by twisting their backs or by landing on their rear legs when 
trying to catch a disc. Try to find a floppy one, made of rubber, to reduce the 
risk of hurting your dog’s teeth.
If your dog isn’t much of a retriever, she may enjoy playing soccer. Use a ball 
that is too large and too firm for her to pick up in her teeth. Kick it around 
the yard, encouraging her to chase it. She will eventually get the idea and 
learn to push the ball around the yard herself. Dogs can have a lot of fun 
playing with a large ball in the water, too. They use their noses to push the 
ball back and forth and try to capture it.
 
If you can’t throw a ball very far and your dog is looking at you as if she 
wished she were owned by a baseball star, try using an aid to throw the ball 
farther. That way your dog will run farther for each fetch, making it more 
fun for her. Use a tennis racket or a bat to whack the ball as far as possible. 
Another great invention is the Chuckit, a plastic stick that cups a tennis ball 
at one end while you hold the other end and swing it. When you let it go, the 
ball flies up to 250 feet — much farther than if you used your arm. The Foxtail 
is another type of ball that is easy to throw long distances. This ball has a 
colorful nylon tail that flaps in the breeze as it trails the ball. If you use the 
tail to swing it before letting go, you can sling the Foxtail farther than you can 
throw it.

249
 Chapter 5: Getting the Lead Out: Exercising Your Dog
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
If your dog is a keen retriever, why not add a few twists to the old game of 
fetch? First throw the ball as far as you can. Then throw a short one. Then 
throw your dog a grounder; then toss the ball high into the air for your dog 
to catch. Praise her just for trying, and give her verbal praise and treats 
for extra-fast or talented retrieves. You also can make the game tougher 
by having your dog retrieve an object while running uphill. This increases 
the amount of weight she has to bear on her rear legs, thus increasing the 
amount of work the rear legs perform. This strengthens the rear leg muscles, 
which is especially important as the dog gets older.
Swimming
Swimming is one of the best forms of exercise for any dog. Because it’s a 
non-weight-bearing activity, it strengthens the cardiovascular and muscular 
systems without stressing bones and joints. This is especially good for dogs 
with arthritis.
 
Many dogs, like the one in Figure 5-1, naturally enjoy swimming, and most 
can learn if they’re given encouragement when they’re young. The best way 
to teach a pup to swim is to start by putting on your boots and walking with 
him in a creek. Creeks have deeper and shallower parts, and eventually your 
pup will find himself swimming a short distance without even realizing it. If 
your adult dog is reluctant, get wet yourself and encourage him to join you 
in the fun. If he is hesitant to swim over his head, use the Hansel-and-Gretel 
principle: Walk slowly out to deeper waters, depositing dog treats as you go 
(Cheerios float very well) and offering encouragement. Often a dog’s stomach 
will overcome his fears.
 
If your water-loving canine is going to swim in a pond, scout the area for 
broken glass, fishing lines, and other hazards first. If you find broken glass, 
seek out another place for your dog to swim, because there’s likely to be 
more where that came from. If he bounds into the water and steps on broken 
glass, it can cut the tendons that run across the wrist just under the skin of 
his legs. Tendons are notoriously difficult to repair, and those particular ten-
dons are critical for a dog to be able to walk and run without discomfort — 
you definitely don’t want to risk it.
If you or a friend has a swimming pool and don’t mind a little dog hair in the 
filter, letting your dog swim there is just fine. In fact, if you want your flabby 
dog to build a little muscle, you can put him on a leash and walk around the 
outside of the pool for 5 to 10 minutes while he swims beside you. Throw a 
few treats in the water every now and then to keep up his interest.

250

Figure 5-1: 
The smile 
on Tally’s 
face is all 
the proof 
you need to 
know that 
swimming 
is one of 
her favorite 
activities.
 
 
Never let your dog swim in a pool without supervision. Every year, dogs 
drown in pools after becoming exhausted trying to find their way out, even 
when stairs are available. Plus, some breeds, such as Bulldogs, aren’t built 
for swimming and can drown in shallow water. Be sure that you know your 
dog’s limitations.
Biking
Having your dog run by your side as you bike is another great way for your 
dog to burn off excess energy.
 
If you decide to give biking a try, take several precautions, because you, and 
your dog, can easily be injured. First, acclimate your dog to your bicycle. 
Some dogs would rather chase bikes than run alongside them. Check out 
Book IV, Chapter 3 to teach your dog to heel, and then do the following:
 
1. Have your dog heel with you as you push your bicycle.
 
2. When she’s working well, get on your bike, but keep your feet on the 
ground to move it.
 
3. When your dog is walking nicely at your side, get on the bike and 
pedal slowly.

251
 Chapter 5: Getting the Lead Out: Exercising Your Dog
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
 
4. Gradually increase the speed as your dog performs well, moving 
with you.
Make sure that your dog stays on the side of you that is away from the road. 
This will keep her from being hit by a car if she suddenly lunges outward. Try 
a device such as the Springer or K-9 Cruiser to attach your dog’s leash to the 
bicycle, leaving your hands free (see Figure 5-2). It’s a metal bar that attaches 
to the bike, with a hook on the other end to affix your dog’s leash. This keeps 
your dog with you, while also keeping her a safe enough distance from the 
wheels. One incident with a squirrel running across your path should con-
vince you of the benefits of these attachments.
 
No product available will keep your dog watching you instead of wanting to 
socialize with the neighbors’ dogs as you go by. You might want to begin with 
walking and running before moving up to bike riding, to train your dog to 
remain with you regardless of your pace.
 
While you ride your bike or run on a hard surface, your dog is running on 
that surface barefoot! Without the benefit of booties, your dog might injure 
her pads. Try a pad conditioner (a cream you rub on your dog’s pads) along 
with booties.

Bicycling with an unleashed dog is dangerous. Even on country paths, a loose 
dog can chase wild animals such as rabbits or deer and become lost or 
injured. Use an attachment that connects your dog to your bicycle.
Hiking
Hiking is similar to walking, except you and your dog head out into the 
countryside, woods, or mountains. You may not be able to count on hiking 
every day, depending on where you live and what your schedule is like, but it 
can be a great addition to your dog’s exercise routine.
 
Before you leave for your hike, make sure that you’re familiar with the 
canine-related rules for the area. Most state parks require dogs to be leashed. 
Regardless of where you go, always have a leash with you in case your dog 
becomes unruly or more interested in chasing squirrels than in listening 
to you.
Pack a collapsible water bowl and a bottle of fresh water. When dogs exercise, 
they need to drink lots of water. Many lakes, streams, and rivers are 
contaminated with bacteria, so you want to make certain that your dog isn’t 
drinking from them. If you give him a fresh water supply before, during, and 
after your hike, you shouldn’t have to worry about him looking for water 
elsewhere. Carry a few treats with you so that every time your dog looks and/
or returns to you of his own accord, he gets a reward for doing so. This will 
tend to keep him closer to you and less likely to run after other hikers.
If you’ve been hiking for some time and your dog is just starting to go with 
you, you’ll need to gradually increase his tolerance to the exercise. Dogs will 
keep going until they drop, so be aware of these signs that he’s getting tired:
 
 Heavy panting
 
 Tendency to lie down whenever you pause
 
 Droopy eyes and ears
 
 A slow pace
Be sure to check his pads when you take a break. He doesn’t have the benefit 
of hiking boots like you do, and you may be crossing rocky terrain that can 
easily slice his pads. Have a small first-aid pack handy (see Book II, Chapter 3), 
just in case.
Horse and hound
Horse and hound is great exercise for a dog. The species have been hunting 
together for millennia, so there’s no reason why your dog can’t learn how 

253
 Chapter 5: Getting the Lead Out: Exercising Your Dog
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
to respect the horse, watch the horse’s leg movements, and listen to your 
requests at the same time. Dogs are great at multitasking, especially when it 
means a long run through fields and woods.
 
Before taking off in a run, acclimate your dog to horses. Horses are prey 
animals and dogs are predators, so you have to teach your dog to control her 
natural instincts and to listen to you from a distance. The guidelines in Book 
IV, Chapter 3 will help you train your dog so that horse and hound is fun and 
safe for both hound and horse.
Scheduling Time for Your New Dog
You got a dog to enrich your life. Your dog gives you joy and is something 
you look forward to each day — and you need to be the same for him. You 
have to make time for him — time for exercise, for specific feeding and relief 
schedules, and for an education.
 
When you make a schedule, stick to it. Dogs are creatures of habit. Knowing 
what’s going to occur, and when, helps your dog adjust to his new life 
quickly.
Playtime
Walking along on a leash is great exercise, especially for an older dog, but 
younger dogs need more than this. And although training exercises do 
stimulate your dog’s mind and make her tired, they don’t totally exercise her 
body. Dogs need free play — off leash, preferably with other dogs, provided 
they haven’t ever displayed any aggression to other canines.
A small dog often gets plenty of exercise racing around the house, but that 
isn’t the preferred situation for a medium-sized or large dog. Having an 
80-pound dog racing around an apartment or even a good-sized house can be 
quite disruptive — more so as she jumps over the couch, runs through the 
kitchen, and barrels over a trash can or two. Having any dog larger than 10 
pounds means lots of exercise — outside, in all types of weather. A fenced 
yard helps, but your dog prefers to spend much of her exercise time interacting 
with you, such as going for long walks and playing fetch and chase games. 
Make time for this. Exercise is covered in more detail earlier in this chapter.
Feeding time
Dogs need to know when they’re going to eat. Feed your dog in the same 
location every time so he knows where he’ll be eating. This helps keep him 

254
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
from feeling that he can eat anywhere in your home. The feed dish should be 
in the kitchen, but not in a direct path with your cooking area. Under a desk, 
at one end of a kitchen island, and at the edge of the room are generally good 
places. Place the water dish near the feed dish.
 
Don’t place the dog’s dish near a trash can. He might think the can is part of 
his meals.
Stick to a feeding schedule to help your dog know that he’ll be taken care of 
at a specific time. Feeding times depend greatly on your own work schedule, 
as well as the age of your dog. Let’s say you work a regular 9-to-5 job. To give 
your dog time to exercise and relieve himself before and after work, try the 
following scheduling:
6 a.m. 
Take him to his relief zone.
6:15 a.m. 
Feed him.
6:30 to 7:00 a.m. 
Take him to his relief zone and exercise him a bit 
 
before leaving for work.
5:30 to 6:00 p.m. 
Take him to his relief zone.
6:15 p.m. 
Feed him.
7 p.m. 
Take him to his relief zone and exercise him a lot.
What if you work irregular hours? Try to still stick to some semblance of a 
schedule. You may not be able to offer consistent exercise times, but you do 
need to offer similar feeding times.
 
With their faster metabolism, puppies need to be fed more often than older 
dogs. Consider this sample feeding schedule for a dog younger than 5 months 
of age for someone who works the regular 9-to-5 job, keeping in mind that there 
will be an opportunity for the youngster to eat and exercise midday — whether 
you can come home at that time or have someone do it for you, it’s a must.
6 a.m. 
Take him to his relief zone.
6:15 a.m. 
Feed him.
6:30 a.m. 
Take him to his relief zone and exercise him a lot.
12 p.m. 
Feed him.
12:15 p.m. 
Take him to his relief zone and exercise him a lot.
6 p.m. 
Feed him.
6:15 p.m. 
Take him to his relief zone and exercise him a lot.
Dogs older than 5 months can safely be fed twice a day, as long as they don’t 
have a medical condition that requires them to be fed smaller meals more often.

Potty time
Potty time goes hand in hand with feeding time, because when your dog eats 
has the most bearing on when your dog needs to go out (see the preceding 
section). If you want a housetrained dog, you have to adhere to a schedule. 
Make certain you either schedule her potty breaks into your day or arrange 
to have someone do it for you.
 
The younger the dog, the more often she has to potty. Keep this in mind 
when you choose a dog. Do you have the time to take her to her relief zone 
every couple hours or so? To housetrain a puppy (see Book IV, Chapter 1), 
you have to do so.
 
The more your pup exercises, the more often she needs to be taken to her 
relief zone.
Dogs older than the age of 4 months can hold themselves longer, but they 
still require relief more often than a dog older than 9 months of age. Take 
your 4- to 9-month-old dog out every three to four hours, to be on the safe 
side. After the age of 9 months, you can wait as long as six hours (or longer, if 
you have to), but that isn’t kind to her on a daily basis.
 
Male dogs require more time to relieve themselves because they tend to 
urinate several times instead of letting their bladders empty all at once. They 
also have to relieve themselves more often throughout the day than most 
female dogs.
Knowing How Much Exercise 
Your Dog Needs
A dog’s exercise requirements depend on many factors, including age, breed 
combination, and size. For example, dogs who have Herding blood need to 
run and exercise a lot every day because they were designed to help farmers, 
whereas dogs with Sporting blood generally don’t need more than a couple 
good long games of fetch because their jobs traditionally involved aiding 
hunters in locating and returning game.
Puppies
 
Your puppy will go through several stages of development that affect his 
level of energy. Some studies suggest that a dog matures the equivalent of 
21 human years within his first year of life and 5 years each year thereafter. 
If you consider the behavioral stages of people (and puppies), this is a good 

256
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
assumption. Imagine taking a child all the way from infancy to the legal 
drinking age in one year — that’s what you do when you bring home a puppy.
Physically, the puppy grows from a little, short-legged, roly-poly, round-faced 
cutie into a dog with a sleek, more angular physique. After the first year, a 
dog doesn’t change much physically.
 
Consider this overview of the kind of energy levels (and exercise require-
ments) you can expect from your pup in the first year of his life:
 
 4 weeks to 3 months: Between the ages of 4 weeks and 3 months, pups 
tend to sleep most of the time. They have short bursts of energy but 
they quickly tire out. A few minutes outside, and they’re beat.
 
 3 to 4 months: When a pup is about 3 to 4 months old, his energy level 
changes a bit. He’ll play more and for longer periods of time. This is 
when your pup begins testing his position in the pack — he’ll display 
dominance when he plays with you or other dogs. He’ll get into tug-
of-war games in earnest. Fetch becomes a fantastic idea. Chasing 
butterflies is also very exciting. On average, a dog this age requires a 
half hour of exercise at least five times a day.
 
 5 to 7 months: At the age of 5 to 7 months, your puppy is at the peak of 
adolescence. This is the period when he needs more exercise than he 
will at any other time in his life. Not only will he be testing his pack 
position, but he’ll be very easily distracted and want to do a zillion 
things at once (just like the typical teenager). An adolescent dog 
requires at least several hours of exercise each day, especially Herding, 
Sporting, or Terrier breeds. Your dog needs the freedom to run in a 
safely fenced area. Play with other dogs is the best means of blowing off 
steam. Though your pup will quickly tire during training sessions, these 
aren’t enough to rid him of the zoomies.
 
 8 to 10 months: Between 8 and 10 months, your young dog will still be 
full of energy, but he’s able to channel it a bit better. If you offer regular 
activities, he’ll be happy to participate. He’ll also begin showing signs 
of maturity, with a better understanding of house rules. He’ll have more 
moments of lying at your feet than in the previous three months. An 
older adolescent dog still needs lots of exercise time — two to three 
hours each day. His exercise can be a combination of play with other 
dogs and a regulated activity such as a training session.
 
 10 months to 1 year: Between 10 and 12 months, your dog has become 
an adult. Don’t worry — he’ll still be playful and energetic. In fact, many 
dogs are energetic well into old age. If you give appropriate exercise 
outlets, you’ll have a happy, healthy, easy-to-manage companion. Your 

257
 Chapter 5: Getting the Lead Out: Exercising Your Dog
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
dog will require a regular exercise regimen, but his activity can be 
more concentrated, such as training time, hiking, biking, or jogging. The 
zoomies are gone.
 
Growing dogs need lots of exercise. Confining them daily for extended 
periods of time is detrimental to their physical and mental development. 
Young dogs need to stretch their legs and minds as they mature. You need to 
discover the proper balance to train your dog in the house rules and allow 
him to “be a dog.” Though you should confine him in a safe area when you 
can’t be with him, be sure to observe him closely at play when you’re home. 
Follow an exercise regimen with your dog. If you exercise with him, it can be 
great for bonding — and for your own health as well as his.
 
An exercise program for a puppy should not include strenuous exercises or 
long play periods. The growth plates (soft areas at each end of the bones) do 
not harden until a puppy is 10 to 14 months of age. These soft areas are 
susceptible to fractures, and even though the bone will heal, it is likely to 
grow unevenly, resulting in a deformity of the bone. Puppies also are more 
likely to injure themselves because of their lack of coordination and muscle 
strength. In addition, puppies are more susceptible to the stresses of heat 
and cold than are adult dogs.
 
Activities for puppies should mix moderate exercise and lots of play. Provide 
abundant variety and opportunities to visit new environments and meet new 
people and other dogs. When a puppy is younger than 12 weeks of age (like 
the one shown in Figure 5-3), play lots of fun games, letting him climb over 
and crawl under your lap and chase a toy on a string. Give your puppy card-
board boxes, bricks, and other safe objects to step on and explore. At that 
age, you also can go for a five-minute walk or play in a shallow creek.
Puppies younger than 6 months of age need only moderate exercise. After 6 
months of age, provide strengthening exercises such as games of fetch and 
chase, but don’t add endurance exercises until those bones are fully mature 
(18 months for tiny dogs, 24 to 30 months for big dogs).
As your pup grows older, he’ll be able to trot for greater distances and play 
for longer periods of time without needing a rest. Throughout adolescence, 
your puppy will have lots of energy and will want to be busy all the time. 
When his body reaches adult size, you may be fooled into thinking he has 
adult stamina. The trick at this stage is to give him abundant exercise, 
play lots of games, and give him many intellectual challenges — without 
overdoing it.

Adult dogs
How much exercise an adult dog needs depends largely on her breed. Even if 
you don’t know exactly which breed(s) make up your dog’s family tree, you 
can probably venture a good guess about which general breed groups she’s 
a part of. For example, you can usually tell a Hound from a Terrier. If you’re 
just not sure about your dog, your vet will probably be able to steer you in 
the right direction.
Table 5-1 shows recommendations for the amount of exercise different dogs 
need based on their breed group. If you know your dog has the genetics 
of one of these breed groups, you’ll have a fairly good idea of how much 
exercise your dog needs.

Table 5-1 lists the minimum amount of exercise a dog needs every day. If you 
have a Hound and you want to exercise her more than one hour a day, your 
dog won’t have any problems as long as you increase the amount of exercise 
gradually, just as you’d do for yourself. But if you have a Herding dog and 
you give her only an hour of exercise a day, the results could be disastrous. 
If you’re not giving your dog enough exercise, she’ll find all kinds of creative 
ways to burn calories on her own — by chewing and digging holes and doing 
all sorts of things that’ll drive you crazy.
If you have a high-energy dog who needs three to four hours of exercise each 
day, don’t panic. You can work this into your lifestyle in different ways. You 
don’t have to take your dog on one long three- or four-hour run. In fact, it’s 
healthier for your dog if you break up the exercise throughout the day. You 
can take her out for a long walk first thing in the morning, play tag or fetch 
with her in the afternoon, and take her for another long walk or training 
session in the evening. Let her blow off steam playing with other dogs.
Although allowing your dog to run in a large fenced area is nice, it isn’t as 
fulfilling to your dog as taking her for a walk around the neighborhood or 
hiking in the woods. Your dog wants to exercise with you. If you can’t do this 
on a regular basis, try having more than one dog — dogs will play with each 
other if you can’t be there to participate. However, they still prefer to involve 
you in the games.
 
Dogs are athletes. They need to use their energy in a positive manner. 
Participating in activities with your dog fills this need while improving the 
bond you have.
Older dogs
As your dog gets older, his energy level won’t be what it was when he was a 
pup. But he still needs exercise — not as much as when he was younger, but 
definitely a good hour per day.
 
The trick to exercising your older dog is to break up that hour throughout 
the day instead of trying to do it all at once. Most older dogs receive plenty of 
exercise through two to three 20-minute walks each day.

260
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
So how do you know if your dog is old? The concept of age is relative to the 
dog’s breed mixture and size. Smaller dogs tend to live longer — they don’t age 
as quickly as larger dogs. The giant breeds, such as Great Danes and Mastiffs, 
rarely live more than 9 years, on average. The Retriever and Setter breeds aver-
age 10 to 12 years. Large Hounds 10 years, smaller Hounds 12 to 14 years. Spaniel 
breeds often live 13 to 14 years, and Terrier breeds can live 14 to 16 years. 
So the age of your dog depends largely on his size, not necessarily the breeds 
that constitute his genetics, although this generalization has many exceptions. 
For example, English Bulldogs, a mid-sized breed, don’t live much beyond 10 
years, while other mid-sized breeds, such as Cocker Spaniels, have a lifespan 
of more than 14 years.
 
Whether your dog just entered middle age or has become geriatric, he still 
needs exercise to remain healthy. As dogs age, arthritis and other physical ail-
ments begin to degenerate their skeletal structure. Regular walks help maintain 
the muscle tone around their joints, improving their overall ability to move.
Trying Your Paws at Canine Sports
If training and competing with your dog appeals to you, you can get involved 
in one of many organized performance events in which dogs and handlers 
compete as a team through novice, intermediate, and advanced levels. You 
can even obtain championships in many of the performance events. Most 
canine performance sports are open to all breeds of dogs as well as mixed 
breeds. Several chapters in Book IV cover this fun part of dog ownership, but 
here we just provide an overview.
Agility is a very popular canine sport in which the handler must direct the 
dog over a course of jumps and obstacles within a certain amount of time 
(see Figure 5-4). Fast thinking and excellent teamwork are the keys to this 
sport.
 
Even if you never plan to compete, consider enrolling your dog in agility 
classes sponsored by a local dog club. The classes will give her some 
exercise, boost her confidence, and stimulate her mind while conveniently 
training her at the same time. (See Book IV, Chapter 5 for a lot more on 
agility training.)
Obedience trials test the ability of a dog to walk at heel on and off leash, to 
stand while being examined, and to come when called. At the higher levels, a 
dog must be able to differentiate between a dumbbell scented by the handler 
and eight others scented by a stranger. She also must be able to jump and 
retrieve, among performing other tests. In addition to being a fun sport, 
obedience training makes your dog easier to live with.

Flyball is a popular sport in which a dog runs down a 50-foot mat, jumping over 
4 jumps on the way, presses a pedal that releases a ball, catches the ball, 
and runs back over the jumps. Four dogs on a team race as a relay against 
another team of four dogs.
Dogs of specific breeds can also show off their particular instincts at events 
such as hunting tests for the Sporting breeds, herding tests for the Herding 
breeds, lure coursing trials for the sighthounds, and go-to-ground tests for 
the Terriers.

Exercising Indoors
When the weather is bad or the days are short, you and your dog can 
still exercise together in the comfort of your home. Indoor exercises can 
strengthen your dog’s muscles, improve coordination, and relieve some 
of the stress of being confined. Crawling strengthens the spinal and rear 
leg muscles, rolling over improves coordination, and waving one front leg 

262
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
strengthens the shoulder muscles. You can teach your dog exercises by 
using food to lure him into position and then encouraging him to try it on 
him own. Praise the dog every time he gets closer to doing what you want. 
You can also devise other exercises (see Figure 5-5). Check out Dog Tricks For 
Dummies, by Sarah Hodgson (Wiley), for more.
 
Doggie play groups in parks are a great way to let dogs exercise each other 
while the owners watch and chat. Just make sure that you monitor the dogs 
to be sure there isn’t a canine bully in the group.
Try taping a long piece of Velcro (the side with the hooks) to the goal post at 
one end of a school’s football field, and then stick 12 tennis balls to it. Take 
your dog to the other end of the field. Unfold your lawn chair and relax while 
your dog runs to get each tennis ball and brings it back. The possibilities are 
limited only by your imagination.
 
Always watch for signs that your dog is becoming fatigued. Don’t depend 
on your dog to restrict his own activity when he is tired. Many dogs will 
literally exercise until they drop because they enjoy it so much. Signs of 
fatigue include stumbling, an anxious look, excessive panting, and widening 
of the end of the tongue.

Paying Attention to the Heat 
When You Exercise Your Dog
The ideal air temperature for a sedentary dog is 65 to 75 degrees with low 
humidity. At this temperature, a resting dog’s body neither gains nor loses 
heat. The dog doesn’t have to expend any energy to maintain his body 
temperature. (The normal body temperature for dogs is 100.5 to 102.8 
degrees.)
 
Dogs have limited mechanisms for coping with overheating. Panting is their 
main mechanism for losing heat. Muscles in the tongue allow it to expand 
to approximately twice its normal size, increasing the surface area for heat 
exchange. In addition, blood vessels in the tongue dilate to bring more blood 
to the surface of the tongue to be cooled. Humidity inhibits the evaporation 
of moisture on your dog’s tongue and in his mouth and lungs, contributing to 
potential heatstroke.
Although dogs don’t have sweat glands like we humans do, they do perspire 
on the pads of their feet. If you walk your dog over a shiny floor on a warm 
day, you can see the imprint of each foot as he leaves a sweaty paw print on 
the smooth surface. Dogs also try to lower their body temperature by seeking 
cool places, by not eating (therefore producing less internal heat), and by 
reducing their activity level.
Exercise for dogs with physical problems
Even if your dog has a physical condition such 
as hip dysplasia or arthritis, she still needs 
exercise. It’s important to keep her muscles 
toned so they take over some of the work of the 
weakened joints. Moderation is the key here: a 
little bit of exercise every day. Don’t let her be 
a weekend warrior by overdoing it on the 
weekend and spending the week on the couch.
As your dog gets older, be extra sensitive to 
signs that she is tiring when she’s out playing. 
Continue to exercise her daily, but reduce the 
length and intensity of her exercise enough to 
prevent her from becoming fatigued.
Dogs with disabilities can play, too. Deaf dogs 
and blind dogs can play in familiar, safe areas. 
Deaf dogs enjoy toys that blink with lights, 
and blind dogs can retrieve toys that make 
continuous noise. Dogs who have had a leg 
amputated can get around almost as well as 
a dog with all four legs, and they will enjoy 
exercise just as much as other dogs.

264
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
Be sensitive to the possibility of your dog becoming overheated. Human 
mechanisms for coping with heat are far superior to those of our dogs. 
So if you’re uncomfortable, you can figure that your dog must be very 
uncomfortable. Your dog can’t communicate verbally and tell you how 
warm he feels. Provide him with access to drinking water at all times, let him 
wallow in a pond or wading pool, or cool him by applying ice packs to his 
groin. If the temperature outside is hot, forget exercise and let your dog stay 
cool.
 
Signs of heatstroke include rapid, noisy breathing; a red, enlarged tongue; 
thick saliva; a body temperature above 106 degrees; staggering; and weakness. 
A dog with heatstroke should be wrapped in towels that have been soaked in 
cold water and transported to a veterinarian or emergency clinic as soon as 
possible. There he will be given further treatment, such as intravenous fluids 
and perhaps cool-water enemas, as well as treatment for shock, if necessary.
Giving Your Dog Things to 
Do While You’re Away
Exercise is an important part of your dog’s day, but if you’re like most 
people, you’re probably home for only a few hours every day. Providing 
activities for your dog while you’re gone is a great way to help her get the 
exercise she needs.
Occupying busy paws
Always give your dog the opportunity to play with or chew a safe toy while 
he is alone. Several products on the market are designed to keep your 
pooch’s paws busy while you’re away (Book I, Chapter 6 offers lots of ideas).
 
Don’t stay away too long. As a rule, dogs should never be left alone for more 
than ten hours at a time. Try to keep your absence from home to five or six 
hours, when possible. Puppies and some older dogs may need potty breaks 
every two to four hours.
One of the best objects to keep an active dog occupied is the Buster Cube, 
which is a tough plastic cube into which you pour a little dry dog food. Using 
a dial, you regulate the speed at which the pieces of food drop out of a hole 
in the cube. Your dog pushes the cube with his nose or turns it over with his 
feet. When the cube is positioned just right — voilà! — out drops a piece of 
food. When your dog realizes that this toy really is a food dispenser and that 
he is in control, he will keep working away at the cube until every last morsel 
is gone.

265
 Chapter 5: Getting the Lead Out: Exercising Your Dog
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
Note: The Buster Cube has two small disadvantages. First, some dogs move 
the cube around so aggressively that it bangs into the walls and the legs of 
nearby furniture. So it’s best not to play this game in the room with Aunt 
Martha’s valuable antiques. Second, this game involves food, and some dogs 
don’t appreciate the assistance of other dogs in their quest. So the Buster 
Cube is best played alone or among (the rare) dogs who play cooperatively 
when food is involved.
Another way to keep your dog occupied during the day is to stuff the center 
cavity of a real bone with soft cheese or peanut butter (but not if your dog is 
a very strong chewer — he could bite off and swallow pieces of bone). You 
can even hide some broken cookies or pieces of kibble in the core of the 
bone. You can stuff other toys such as Kong toys with food and seal them 
with peanut butter or cream cheese. Getting to the good stuff can occupy 
your dog for many hours.
 
If your dog’s personal area has a window looking out over a quiet place such 
as your backyard, place a couch or a safe table in front of it so he can 
watch the birds and other wildlife while you’re away. It’s usually better if 
your dog isn’t able to see the activities on the street in front of your house, 
however, because if he sees the mail carrier bringing the mail to the house, 
for example, he may bark and carry on, sensing that he should guard the 
house in your absence. When the carrier leaves after delivering the mail, your 
dog becomes convinced that his barking has driven him away. If this scenario 
is repeated day after day, your dog may become quite aggressive toward the 
mail carrier — and others who come on the property, which is why tens of 
thousands of mail carriers and delivery people are bitten by dogs every year. 
Your dog doesn’t need this kind of experience, and the mail carrier certainly 
doesn’t, either.
 
A dog door can be a real boon for a dog who is home alone all day. Whenever 
he likes, he can go outside into his fenced-in yard, eliminate, catch some rays, 
chase a squirrel or two, and then go back in to sleep some more. Dog doors 
are especially helpful for older dogs who may have trouble holding their 
urine for a full day. If you use this convenience, however, your yard must 
be completely safe for your dog. He shouldn’t be able to escape by climbing 
the fence or by digging under it. It’s also best if your dog can’t see the 
comings and goings of children and delivery people. A dog door works best if 
it is used in a quiet neighborhood and it opens to an enclosed kennel or to a 
secluded yard with a secure fence.
Doggie daycare
Doggie daycare is a booming industry because more people are away at work 
during the day, sometimes leaving their canine companions at home for long 
periods of time. If you want to give your furry friend an outlet for her energy 

266
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
during the day, consider doggie daycare facilities, which offer a variety of 
services, including boarding, play groups, dog walking, obedience training, 
and even hiking or swimming.
 
The best way to find a reputable doggie daycare establishment is to ask 
dog-owning friends and neighbors if they know of any. If you come up 
empty, call a local dog club, a dog-training facility, or your veterinarian for a 
recommendation (assistants often moonlight as dogsitters).
When you’ve found a doggie daycare, inquire about the interview process. 
Good daycare facilities interview prospective clients and their dogs just as a 
children’s daycare would. They want to know whether your dog is properly 
immunized against communicable diseases so she won’t catch or spread any 
infections while she’s there. They will also be interested in what activities 
your dog enjoys and whether she plays well with other dogs so she can 
participate in doggie play groups.
 
During your interview, find out what activities are available and how your 
dog’s day will be structured. These important questions are worth asking:
 
 Where will my dog stay when she is resting? The kennel area should be 
clean and should have bedding and safe toys available for the dogs.
 
 What does the owner do if dogs have tiffs over playthings?
 
 How does the owner handle a dog who is aggressive or dominating 
around others?
 
 How long do the dogs play each day, how much rest time do they 
have, and how much one-on-one interaction do they get with daycare 
personnel?
 
 What veterinary facilities does the facility use if one of the dogs has 
an accident or becomes ill? Make sure that the owner has insurance to 
cover the facility.
As of this writing, no organizations oversee or accredit doggie daycare 
facilities. Be a good consumer and make sure that you get all your questions 
answered and lay to rest all your concerns before you enroll your canine 
family member.
Doggie daycare costs a little more than boarding a dog overnight in a kennel. 
It can be quite expensive if your dog attends every day, but it is an excellent 
solution for single people and busy families.

Dog walkers
Dog walking is a great way for your dog to get some activity while you’re 
away. Dog walking also provides a great opportunity for neighborhood 
kids who have a love for animals and a desire to make a few bucks the 
old-fashioned way.
Depending on the size of your dog (which dictates how much he pulls when 
he sees a squirrel) and his level of obedience, a responsible child as young as 
11 or 12 years old can be a good dog walker. Just make it clear to the young 
entrepreneur how he is to walk your dog — including which leash and collar 
to use, where he can go, how long he should walk him, and so on. Always 
post the phone number where you can be contacted, along with other 
emergency numbers such as another contact person and the telephone 
number of your regular and emergency veterinarians.
 
If you hire a child to walk your dog, always meet with the child’s parents first. 
They generally are involved in scheduling your dog’s walk around the child’s 
other after-school events. Their concern for the child’s safety means they’re 
keeping an eye on your dog, too.
 
Adult or professional dog walkers are an excellent option, particularly if 
you have multiple dogs who may be too much for a child to handle. Many 
professional dog walkers are bonded and insured, giving you a little more 
security than you have with a neighborhood kid. Again, try to get a personal 
recommendation and have a thorough interview before you trust your dogs 
to a stranger.
 
Don’t hire a dog walker who walks several strange dogs together. This 
experience can be tremendously stressful to the dogs.
Pet sitters
Pet sitters can make a huge difference in your dog’s life. They let your dog 
stay in her familiar environment when you have to be away for extended 
periods of time, making your absence much less stressful for your canine 
companion than a kennel full of strangers.
 
The best way to find a dog sitter is to obtain a referral from someone who 
has used the dog sitter extensively and has been pleased with his work. You 
can also try the Web site for Pet Sitters International (www.petsit.com) to 
find a reliable and responsible pet sitter in your area. Or try your vet for a 
recommendation.

268
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
Always interview a new dog sitter before hiring him. Introduce your dog to 
him and make sure that they connect with each other. The dog sitter should 
not appear hesitant to handle your pooch, and your dog should accept his 
touch. He should appear genuinely interested in your dog and her welfare 
while you are away. He should ask specific questions about how you want 
your dog cared for. If you see any red flags, such as hesitance to interact with 
your dog or evidence of a short temper, the applicant probably isn’t a good 
match for your dog.
Some dog sitters stay at your home while you’re away; others visit three to 
four times a day for a predetermined amount of time to let your dog out, feed 
her, and walk or play with her. Either option can work well. Just be sure that 
you are comfortable with your decision.
 
Before your new pet sitter starts her first assignment, make an appoint-
ment for her to spend some time with you learning your dog’s obedience 
commands and other house rules. If your dog always barges out of the door 
unless commanded to wait, have the pet sitter also make the dog wait, which 
will strengthen obedient behavior while you’re away.
Be sure to leave complete written instructions for your dog sitter. They 
should include the following information:
 
 The address and telephone number where you can be reached
 
 The address and telephone number of an emergency contact near where 
you live
 
 Your veterinarian’s name, address, and telephone number
 
 The name, address, and telephone number of an emergency veterinarian 
who is available after hours
 
 Complete feeding instructions (including the type of food, the amount, 
when and where your dog should be fed, and whether she needs to go 
out right away after she eats)
 
 Instructions for exercising your dog (including what activities she likes, 
for how long, and how often)
 
 Instructions for picking up the yard, if necessary
 
 Notes about any medication your dog needs
 
 Any other habits or needs specific to your dog
 
 Whether the dog sitter should answer the telephone or let it ring

Caring for an Aging Dog

 Dealing with older-dog health concerns
 Letting go
 Getting help when you’re grieving
 Providing for your pet in your will
P
eople flip over puppies, but a well-loved older dog is also beautiful. An 
older dog has a nobleness about him, a look in the eyes that speaks of 
years of the special love only a pet can give — trusting, nonjudgmental, and 
unwaveringly true.
Your dog’s health as he ages is not entirely in your control, but you can have 
a real impact on his attitude. When you see those first gray hairs appear on 
his muzzle, getting a little upset about them is natural. The normal life span 
of a dog isn’t even remotely close to ours, after all, and those first signs of 
aging remind us that the years between a puppy’s first gasp and the last 
sighing breath of a dying dog are not really that far apart.
But consider the following: Unless the guesses and assumptions of science 
are wrong, your dog doesn’t know he’s getting older. His gray hairs do not 
concern him, nor does he worry about the other visible effects of time, 
including the thickening of his body and the thinning of his limbs. He doesn’t 
count the number of times he can fetch a ball before tiring and compare that 
to his performance when he was a young dog in his prime. He doesn’t know 
that his time is growing shorter and that he’ll get weaker or grow blind, 
perhaps, or deaf. He doesn’t know that he’ll die someday.
 
You know all of that, but this information is a secret best kept to yourself. 
Your dog takes his cues from you, and when you’re upbeat, encouraging, and 
loving, he’ll be at his best no matter what his age. Keep your aging dog fit 
and healthy, and don’t exclude him from your activities. This time can be a 
special one for both of you, and it’s up to you to make the most of it.

Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Special Care for Canine Seniors
Next to you, your dog’s best friend as she ages should be her veterinarian. 
Preventive care is not only more cost-effective than crisis care, but it’s the 
only way to catch problems before they lessen the quality of your dog’s life.
Maybe you’ve had such a healthy dog that you’ve rarely taken her to the 
veterinarian. Take her in for a thorough senior-dog physical anyway when 
she hits 8 or so (as early as 6 for giant breeds, as late as 10 for tiny ones), 
including whatever tests your veterinarian recommends — blood, urine, 
and so on. The information these tests provide can spot treatable problems 
early and provide baseline information against which your veterinarian can 
compare new data as problems develop.
This rapport with your vet is never more important than when you’re guiding 
your pet through her senior years.
Nutrition
Your dog’s nutritional needs change as he gets older, and so, in most cases, 
should his food. If you have been satisfied with a particular food, you may 
be able to switch to the brand’s formulation for older dogs. If not, your 
veterinarian may be able to suggest something suitable.
The biggest food-related problem for older dogs is obesity, which puts 
pressure on joints and internal organs that aren’t able to withstand the 
pressure. If your pet is portly, talk to your veterinarian about safe ways to 
trim him down slowly.
 
Unlike us, dogs have no control over how much they eat: Your dog’s weight 
depends on your self-control, not his.
Dogs with chronic health problems may end up on a special diet available 
only through your veterinarian. These diets — which come in both canned 
and dry varieties — are formulated to address your pet’s particular health 
needs. Some pets may not like them, especially compared to the fat- and 
treat-based diet they were on before, but don’t sabotage your pet’s care 
by adding goodies to the mix. A simple strained broth made from boiling 
chicken bones with a crushed garlic clove or two — no added salt — may 
make the diet more palatable. Check with your veterinarian, though, before 
adding anything else to a prescription diet.
For the rundown on dog food — what’s in it, what your dog needs, and how 
to choose — see Book I, Chapter 2.

Nutrition

Exercise
“Use it or lose it” is true for both humans and dogs. No matter what her age, 
exercise keeps your dog’s body in good condition and brightens her outlook.
The secret as dogs age is increasing the frequency and diminishing the 
intensity. Instead of taking your dog to the park once a week to chase tennis 
balls until she’s exhausted, take her for a daily walk. When you throw a tennis 
ball, keep it low to avoid leaps, twists, and hard landings, and consider 
walking to the park and back rather than driving. Warm-ups and cool-downs 
are more important for older dogs, whose bodies aren’t as able to withstand 
the pounding a younger dog endures without pause. Inactivity punctuated by 
bouts of overexertion isn’t good for any dog, but for the older dog it can be 
painful or even dangerous.
Despite your best intentions, sometimes an older pet will make like a puppy 
and play hard. The next morning, she’ll surely feel it. Give her buffered 
aspirin, 5 milligrams per pound of body weight, every 12 hours. If the stiffness 
lasts for more than a day, consult your veterinarian. If your dog is on other 
medications, check with your veterinarian first.
Walking is good exercise for older pets; supervised swimming is another if 
you have a dog who enjoys it. (Choose a lake or pool rather than a river, and 
keep her close to the bank.) Keep her moving every day. Push her a little on 
the distance and the time, or at least try to maintain what you’ve got going, 
but don’t overextend her — let her set the pace.
Think about games she can do just as well — or better — than when she was 
younger, such as Sniff Out the Hidden Toy. In my house, senior dog Andy no 
longer chases tennis balls at a gallop. Put your dog on “stay,” show her a toy, 
and hide it for her to find.
Putting junior in his place
If you have an older dog and a younger one, the 
competition between them can be frustrating to 
the older dog. Here’s an exercise that lets the 
older dog win and improves the obedience of 
the younger:
After your younger dog has chased a few balls 
to get rid of his excess energy, put him in a 
“down-stay” (make him lie down and tell him 
to stay — see Book IV, Chapter 3). If you’ve 
never tried this exercise under such tempting 
conditions, leave his leash on and then stand on 
it. Repeat the “stay” command and then throw 
the ball — a short throw — for your senior 
dog. Let him get the ball a few times, and then 
release the younger dog and praise him. Then 
tell them both they’re wonderful.

272
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Very few dogs, even young ones, get enough exercise to keep their nails short 
without trimming; senior dogs certainly don’t. Arthritis and muscle stiffness 
make moving around hard enough for older dogs; overgrown nails make 
things worse, and they’re something that you have the power to fix — so do 
it. (See Book III, Chapter 3 for tips on how to keep nails short.)
Dentistry
One of the most important recent advances in the care of older dogs is in the 
care of their mouths: Canine dentistry is an area of preventive care that you 
ignore at your pet’s peril. (See Book III, Chapter 3 for a full discussion of dog 
dental care.) Start teeth brushing when a dog is a puppy — an older dog may 
never allow you to brush his teeth for the first time.
Preventive care involves brushing your older dog’s teeth — two or three 
times a week is fine — using gauze wrapped around your finger or a toothbrush, 
whichever your pet tolerates best. Toothpastes made just for dogs are 
available, with flavors that appeal to the canine palate and ingredients that 
can be swallowed. Because dogs can’t spit and rinse, people toothpaste and 
baking soda, which is high in sodium, aren’t recommended.
Before you start your at-home regimen, your pet will likely need some help 
from your veterinarian. A complete dental work-up under anesthesia takes 
45 minutes to an hour and involves not only cleaning and polishing the teeth, 
but also treating broken or rotting teeth, cavities, abscesses, and periodontal 
disease. This procedure is especially important if you’ve neglected your pet’s 
mouth: Brushing prevents plaque from forming, but it won’t help much with 
the muck that has already built up — and it won’t fix bad teeth or infections.
Dental care is very important in older dogs, especially small ones, who tend 
to have mouths crowded with teeth. Neglected mouths can make eating 
painful. Infections are a problem, too, and the adverse effect of bacteria from 
chronic mouth infections takes a toll on your pet’s internal organs and can 
overwhelm his immune system. Bacteria can even travel through the 
bloodstream from your dog’s mouth to his heart and infect his heart valves.
The benefits of such care extend to more than the elimination of bad breath 
in an older dog: When your pet is no longer fighting infections and pain, his 
spirits lift along with his health, all of which can spark his appetite.

Some Common Age-Related 
Health Problems
Although every dog is an individual, a few age-related maladies seem to strike 
many of them. You should, of course, discuss how they affect your dog and 
the best approach to treating them with your veterinarian. But knowing a 
little bit about what you’re dealing with before you go in is helpful.
Decline of the senses
Deaf and blind dogs do just fine, as long as you do your part to keep them 
out of any danger their disabilities may cause. Blindness, in particular, is a 
problem dogs adjust to with an ease that stuns their owners. But consider 
the following: Dogs don’t have to read the newspaper, they don’t care about 
TV, and they count on you to read the ingredients label on a bag of kibble. 
Sight isn’t their primary sense anyway — they put much greater stock in 
their senses of smell and hearing. After they learn the layout of the land, they 
rarely bump into things (as long as you don’t keep moving the furniture).
 
Handicapped pets should never be allowed off-leash on walks, because they 
can’t see danger and cannot hear your warnings.
 
How do you know if your dog is really blind? Lunge at his face menacingly 
with your finger (don’t make contact!). If he doesn’t blink, he’s blind.
Even if your older dog is blind (or deaf — check by clapping your hands 
behind his head), you may be able to do something. Ask your veterinarian for 
a referral to a specialist such as a veterinary ophthalmologist. Problems such 
as cataracts may be treatable with medications and surgery.
Incontinence
Many dog owners start wondering why their older dogs are no longer 
house-trained — and how to get them back on track. The first rule of any 
sudden-onset behavior problem is to make sure that it’s not a health 
problem, and it could well be a health problem if an older dog is suddenly 
urinating in the house. Your pet could have an infection or, if she’s an older, 
spayed female, she may be suffering from the loss of muscle tone related to a 
decrease in her hormone levels. Both are treatable; see your veterinarian.

274
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
At a certain age, a little dribbling of urine is practically inevitable, especially 
while your older dog is sleeping. You may want to place old rubber-backed 
bathmats in her favorite sleeping area. They catch the dribble and are easily 
washable, keeping odor and dampness — and flea eggs — under control. 
Living with pets, like living with children, can be one big mess. 
Lumps and bumps
Benign fatty tumors are common in older dogs, and the vast majority are 
nothing to worry about. Benign tumors are round and soft, with well-defined 
edges. You can usually get your fingers nearly around them, and they don’t 
seem well anchored. Showing them to your veterinarian for a more complete 
evaluation is important, and you should inform her of any changes in size or 
shape, especially if they happen rapidly. Your veterinarian may be concerned 
enough about the size, appearance, or location of a mass to suggest its 
removal and a biopsy; most bumps, however, are left alone. The best time to 
check for lumps and bumps? During regular grooming — weekly, at least. Run 
your hand over every inch of your dog, and don’t forget to talk sweetly — 
he’ll think it’s petting.
 
Some breeds — Boxers, for one — are much more prone to cancer, and you 
should be more aggressive in investigating lumps and bumps. Work with 
your veterinarian closely to catch any problems early.
Stiffness
Your veterinarian can help you determine whether the stiffness is because 
of temporary muscle soreness — say, from overdoing it — or the onset of 
arthritis. Many dogs feel worse in cold weather and first thing in the morning. 
Arthritis is common in older dogs, and although no cure exists, treatments 
are available that can make your pet comfortable. Your veterinarian may 
prescribe buffered aspirin, food supplements, or anti-inflammatory medications, 
all of which your pet may need to take for the rest of her life. For your part, 
you need to be sure that your pet is not overweight and is kept consistently, 
but not strenuously, active.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories — the best known is Rimadyl — have made 
life bearable for tens of thousands of older dogs, but they are not without 
risk. Rimadyl has been implicated in the deaths of many dogs — Labradors, 
especially, seem to be vulnerable. Don’t let these tragedies dissuade you 
from considering a medication that can work wonders, but do press your 
veterinarian to explain all the risks and benefits so you can make the best 
decision for your pet.

Some dogs lose strength in their hindquarters as they age or become 
paralyzed because of a spinal injury. This condition need not mean 
euthanasia. A company called K-9 Carts manufactures wheeled devices that 
allow a dog to be mobile again (see www.k9-carts.com).
Reasonable Accommodations
The number of ways you can give your oldster a break is limited only by your 
imagination. Consider a few tips to get you thinking:
 
 Beds: Think soft. Think cushioned. Think low. Think heated. Your dog 
will thank you for all these thoughts, especially in cold weather.
 
 Clothes: Canine clothing isn’t just for Poodles anymore. Older dogs, like 
older people, have a harder time maintaining their body temperature. 
This problem is even more pronounced in slender, short-coated breeds 
like the Greyhound or Whippet. So check out the sweater selection at 
your local pet-supply store, or consider altering one of your own for the 
task.
 
 Dishes: Raised food and water dishes are a kindness to tall dogs of any 
age, but they are especially easy on the back of an oldster. You can find 
them at pet-supply stores or you can make your own.
 
 Ramps and steps: If your dogs are allowed on the couch and the bed, 
you should be able to find or build something to help the dog who can 
no longer make it in one jump.
Older dog and new puppy
All the trials of old age can make a dog 
downright cranky and make some people long 
to have a puppy in the house. Of course, you 
want to be sure that your older dog enjoys the 
change, or at least tolerates it. So should you 
add a puppy to an older dog’s life?
That depends. For some older dogs, a puppy is a 
big boost to the senior’s enthusiasm. For others, 
a puppy’s energy and attention are enough to 
make an older dog want to leave home. You 
must determine which of these attitudes your 
older dog has.
In general, older dogs who are still fit and full 
of life probably get the most out of an addition 
to the household; elderly or severely debilitated 
dogs enjoy it least. No matter what your dog’s 
age, try to keep tabs on the interaction until 
you’re sure how things are progressing. Don’t 
let your older dog overextend himself, and put 
the puppy in his crate or behind a baby gate 
to give your oldster a break from time to time. 
Finally, save some exclusive energy and time 
for dog number 1: Spend time together, just the 
two of you, so he realizes he is still very much 
loved.

Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Knowing When It’s Time to Let Go
Euthanasia, the technical term for putting a person or animal to sleep for 
humane reasons, is one of the hardest decisions you will ever make, and it 
doesn’t get any easier, no matter how many times over the years you face it. 
Your veterinarian can offer advice, and your friends can offer support, but no 
one can make the decision for you. When you live with an elderly or terminally 
ill pet, you look in her eyes every morning and ask yourself, “Is this the day?”
Some owners don’t wait until their pet’s discomfort becomes pain and 
choose euthanasia much sooner than others would. Some owners use an 
animal’s appetite as the guide — when an old or ill animal is no longer 
interested in eating, they reason, he’s not interested in anything at all. And 
some owners wait until there’s absolutely no doubt the time is at hand.
Anesthesia: Weighing the risks
As common as anesthesia is in veterinary 
medicine, many misconceptions exist about 
its use where older animals are concerned. 
Veterinary findings no longer support the 
idea that the risk of anesthesia outweighs the 
importance of preventive veterinary care.
The risks can be greatly minimized by a few 
basic tests, including a laboratory evaluation 
of blood and urine, a chest X-ray, and possibly 
an electrocardiogram. Although these tests 
admittedly add to the cost of a procedure, 
they allow your veterinarian to provide the 
life-enhancing and life-extending benefits of 
preventive care to the pets who need them 
most.
Your veterinarian may also recommend IV or 
subcutaneous fluids while your pet is under 
anesthesia, and, for dental procedures, 
pre- and post-surgical antibiotics.
No discussion of anesthetic danger can 
be complete without a few words on your 
responsibilities where anesthesia is concerned:
  Follow your veterinarian’s instructions on 
preparing your pet for surgery. If no food 
is specified, make sure that you deliver a 
pet with an empty stomach. Following this 
one piece of advice is one of the easiest 
and most basic ways to reduce risk. Under 
anesthesia, a dog can regurgitate and 
inhale the contents of a full stomach into 
her lungs.
  Be prepared to provide special home care 
for your pet after surgery. Releasing animals 
before the preanesthetic sedation wears 
off is common practice. Such animals must 
be kept safe from hot or cold environments 
because their reflexes are reduced. If you 
don’t feel comfortable caring for a sedated 
pet, arrange for your veterinarian to extend 
the care.
  Don’t hesitate to ask questions. Make sure 
that you understand what the procedures 
are and what to expect. For example, pets 
commonly have a cough after anesthesia 
because the tube used to deliver the gas 
may cause some irritation. If the cough 
does not clear up in a couple days, call your 
veterinarian.
No matter what the age of the pet, chances are 
very high that the anesthetic will present no 
problem if both you and your veterinarian work 
to minimize the risks.

Each guideline can be the right one, for some dogs and some owners at 
certain times. You do the best you can, and then you try to put the decision 
behind you and deal with the grief. Ironically, the incredible advances in 
veterinary medicine in the past couple decades have made the decisions 
even more difficult for many people. Not too long ago, the best you could do 
for a seriously ill pet was to make her comfortable until that wasn’t possible 
anymore. Nowadays, nearly every advantage of human medicine — from 
chemotherapy to pacemakers — is available to our pets.
If you can afford such extensive care and have a realistic expectation that 
it will improve your pet’s life — rather than simply prolong it — then it is 
an option that you should pursue. But let nothing push you into making a 
decision based on guilt or wishful thinking.
 
Euthanasia is a kindness extended to a treasured pet, a decision we make at a 
great cost to ourselves. It is a final act of love, nothing less.
Evaluating euthanasia options
As performed by a veterinarian, euthanasia is a quick and peaceful process. 
The animal is unconscious within seconds and dead within less than a 
minute; the euphemism “put to sleep” is actually a perfect description. 
People who attend the procedure usually come away reassured that their pet 
felt no fear or pain.
What about the remains?
You can handle your pet’s remains in many 
ways, and doing so is easier if you make 
your decisions beforehand. The choices 
include having your municipal animal-control 
department pick up the body, burying the pet 
in your backyard or at another site (where it’s 
legal and with the land owner’s permission, of 
course), arranging for cremation, or contracting 
with a pet cemetery for full services and burial. 
Some people even choose to have their pets 
preserved like hunting trophies, or have a part 
of them cryogenically saved for cloning later. 
Again, no choice is wrong. Whatever feels 
right to you and comforts you best is what you 
should do.
The next topic is difficult, but you must consider 
it. If your pet dies unexpectedly or while under 
the care of your veterinarian and there’s is 
any question about the cause of death or your 
veterinarian believes lessons can be learned 
by performing a postmortem examination, you 
should agree. This procedure may not help your 
dog, but it may help hundreds or thousands 
of others. What better way to demonstrate 
your love for dogs than to assist in the 
advancement of care for other pets with similar 
health problems?

278
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Some people stay with a pet at the end, and some don’t, but no decision you 
make regarding the last few minutes of an animal’s life will change the love 
you shared for the years before those final moments. If you want to be there, 
then by all means stay. But leaving euthanasia to your veterinarian is no less 
a humane and loving gesture.
Call ahead to set the appointment, and make it clear to the receptionist what 
you’re coming for. (The tone of your voice will probably tip her off, anyway.) 
That way, the practice can ensure that you don’t have to sit in the waiting 
room but can instead be immediately ushered into an exam room, if you 
choose to remain with your dog. Your veterinarian will do his best to 
answer all your questions and make you comfortable with everything before 
proceeding. He may clip the fur on your dog’s foreleg to have easier and 
quicker access to the vein for the injection of the euthanizing agent; he may 
also choose to presedate your pet.
 
Crying is normal, and your veterinarian will understand. So, too, will 
your dog.
You may want to hold your hand near your dog’s nose so the last sniff will be 
of you. You may want to spend a few minutes with your pet afterward, and 
your veterinarian will understand that as well, and will give you all the time 
you need alone to begin the process of coming to grips with your loss.
You’re not alone
You may find talking to others about your pet’s 
death helpful. Ask your veterinarian about 
pet-loss support groups. Almost unheard of a 
few decades ago, such groups are available in 
many communities today. You may also want to 
see a counselor.
Veterinary schools and colleges have been 
among the leaders in creating programs to help 
pet lovers deal with loss. A handful now operate 
pet-loss hot lines staffed by veterinary students 
trained to answer questions, offer materials 
that may help you (including guidelines for 
helping children with loss), and just plain listen. 
These programs are wonderful, and they’re 
free for the cost of the call. (If you call during 
off hours, they call you back, collect.)

You may be more comfortable with having your pet euthanized at home. If 
this is what you want, discuss the matter with your veterinarian directly. 
Many vets extend this special service to long-time clients. If yours doesn’t, 
you may alternatively consider making arrangements with a mobile 
veterinarian.
Several manufacturers offer markers for your yard to memorialize your pet; 
they are often advertised in the back of magazines like Dog Fancy. Other 
choices include large rocks or slabs of stone, or a tree or rose bush. Even 
if you choose not to have your pet’s body or ashes returned, placing a 
memorial in a special spot may soothe you.
 
Another way to celebrate the memory of your dog is to make a donation to 
your local humane society, regional school of veterinary medicine, or other 
favorite animal charity. A donation in a beloved pet’s name is a wonderful act 
to do for a friend who has lost a pet as well.
Dealing with loss
Many people are surprised at the powerful emotions that erupt after a pet’s 
death, and they are embarrassed by their grief. Remembering that pets have 
meaning in our lives beyond the love we feel for the animal alone may help. 
Often we don’t realize that we are grieving not only for the pet we loved, but 
also for the special time the animal represented.
Taking care of yourself is important at this difficult time. Some people — the 
“it’s just an animal” crowd — will not understand your feelings and may even 
shrug off your grief as foolish. The company of other animal lovers is very 
important. Seek them out to share your feelings. In some areas, pet-loss 
support groups may be available. Search the Internet for pet loss to come 
up with sites that can help. And don’t forget the AVMA pet-loss hotlines 
available at the link given in the nearby sidebar, “You’re not alone.”
 
A difficult time, to be sure, but in time, the memories become a source of 
pleasure, not pain. Coming to terms with grief has no set timetable, but it 
happens.
A handful of books and one really fine video may help you help your 
child with the loss of a pet. From Fred Rogers (yes, Mr. Rogers of the 
Neighborhood) comes the book When a Pet Dies (Putnam) and the video

Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Death of a Goldfish. Rachel Biale’s My Pet Died (Tricycle Press) not only helps 
children cope better by giving them pages to fill in, but also offers parents 
advice in special pages that can be torn out. Finally, Judith Viorst’s The Tenth 
Good Thing About Barney (Aladdin) is a book that experts in pet loss have 
been recommending for years.
What If You Go First?
First things first: You can’t leave your estate to your dog, because in the eyes 
of the law, an animal is an “it,” with little more legal status than a chair. Nor 
can you set up a trust for your pet, for the same reason. The beneficiary of 
a trust must be a bona fide human being, and the fact that you think of your 
dog as a person doesn’t really matter, because the courts don’t.
Of course, you should discuss this matter with your attorney, but talking it 
over with your friends and family is even more important, because you must 
find one of them to care for your pet after you’re gone. You must state that 
you’re leaving your dog to that person, along with enough money to provide 
for the animal’s care for life. You have no real control over the outcome, 
which is why you need to choose someone you trust and then hope for your 
dog’s sake that things turn out okay.
No one likes to think about dying. But you have a responsibility to loved 
ones you leave behind, and that includes your pets. Talk to your friends, 
your family, and even your veterinarian. Call an attorney. Don’t rely on the 
kindness of strangers to care for your pet if something happens to you. Your 
dog deserves better than that.

S
omebody has to breed dogs, or there wouldn’t be any. Good breeders 
have always existed, and with any luck they always will. They care about 
their breed and the dogs they produce. They put years of study and effort 
into breeding dogs who are healthy and temperamentally sound — dogs who 
closely match the standards for their breed.
Unfortunately, these breeders are the minority. All is not right in the dog 
world, and it hasn’t been for a long, long time. Consider these problems:
 
 Too many dogs are dying for want of a home — and not just mixed 
breeds, either. Shelters and rescue groups deal with plenty of purebreds.
 
 Too many dogs have health problems that can be eliminated through 
conscientious breeding.
 
 Too many dogs have inherited personality problems, such as aggression 
or shyness or even yapping.
 
 Too many dogs have personality problems caused by improper handling 
in the first weeks of their lives.
People who shouldn’t be breeding dogs cause these problems. If you feel 
drawn to breeding and care about dogs — your dog and all dogs — consider 
breeding very carefully. Educate yourself about your breed and the congenital 
health and temperament problems within the breed. Develop a plan for 
breeding and a plan — as well as a fund — for dealing with emergencies. 
Think about the time you need to devote to helping the puppies be born, 

282
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
caring for them, and socializing them. Also remember that you need to know 
how to find good homes for them. You can be a good breeder, but you have 
to work at it. You can’t take any shortcuts.
 
Be prepared to deal with the puppies you can’t sell and the puppies that may 
be returned to you. They are your responsibility, too. If you can’t say that 
you will do everything that a reputable breeder does, then you need to spay 
or neuter your dog.
Neutering, or at least making a decision not to breed your pet, is in the best 
interest of your dog and all dogs. It also makes your life easier. Spaying and 
neutering are the everyday terms for the surgical sterilization of a pet — 
spaying for the female, neutering for the male. The term neutering — or 
altering — is also used to describe both procedures. See Chapter 4 in Book II 
for more on these procedures.
 
What if you meant to spay your dog and you come home to find her mating 
with the dog from three doors down? She doesn’t have to carry the litter to 
term. Spaying can be done on a pregnant dog, and the sooner the better.
The point here is that you need a deep understanding of both dogs and 
the responsibilities of breeding them before you even consider getting into 
breeding. Pilots don’t jump into the cockpit and fly off into the wild blue 
yonder before they’ve completed the requisite courses and passed all the 
tests. Nor does the surgeon learn what’s required by hacking away at a 
patient’s liver. No one is allowed to assume those responsible positions 
without the extensive study that prepares them to do so. 
Unfortunately, no courses of study or tests of knowledge are required of 
people who breed dogs. They just buy a female and, bang, they’re out of 
the starting gate. Uneducated and irresponsible breeders sell, give away, 
or simply abandon their mistakes with no thought given to what the result 
of their carelessness will be. Unsuspecting dog lovers are saddled with 
thousands of dollars in veterinary bills and chronically ill dogs because the 
people who bred the dog had absolutely no idea what they were doing. Nor, 
obviously, did they care.
If an investigation were done, probably very few instances of dogs maliciously 
attacking children could be attributed to dogs coming from responsible 
breeders. Some dogs have a more aggressive nature than others, and 
breeders who own and appreciate these dogs go to great lengths to make 
sure that their dogs go only to homes where they will be properly trained 
and supervised.
Bottom line: You won’t be able to produce worthy dogs of any breed unless 
you know what constitutes a top specimen. Even when you’ve mastered that 
part of your education, it’s only the beginning. This chapter is intended to 
give you an overview of how dog breeding works, but reading it does not 
qualify you to breed dogs. If you’re really intent on breeding dogs, you need

more than this chapter before you begin. A good place to start is Breeding 
Dogs For Dummies, by Richard G. Beauchamp (Wiley). 
But even if you becomes a master of the reading material on dog breeding, 
is mastering the tried-and-true methods a guarantee of any kind? Not at 
all. They are only the best-known methods, and they seem to work when 
intelligently applied. The only guarantee involved is that a person who 
embarks on a breeding program without sound knowledge is bound to meet 
with more failure than success. And if failure were the worst of it, these 
people would only have themselves to blame. In breeding dogs irresponsibly, 
you perpetrate your mistakes on an unknowing and unsuspecting public.
Breeders can increase their chances of producing dogs that live up to the 
standard of their breed in certain ways, and they can follow certain methods 
to avoid the pitfalls nearly every breed is susceptible to. This chapter gives 
you an introduction on how to take advantage of them.
What to Expect If You Decide to Breed
Breeding a dog takes time and money, especially for the owner of the female. 
Your dog and the dog you breed her to need to be certified clear of inherited 
problems such as hip dysplasia, deafness, and inherited eye diseases. Both 
dogs need to be tested for venereal diseases, be current on their vaccinations, 
be free of parasites, and be taking an heartworm-preventive medication. This 
clean bill of health costs money — easily into the hundreds of dollars.
When the male dog has all his health clearances, his job is easy. He gets to 
the party early and leaves the scene early. But after the coupling, the female’s 
job has just started. Her owner bears most of the costs, starting with the stud 
fee. But even before you can pay that, you have to find a stud dog. You’re not 
likely to find a suitable mate around the corner, or even in your town, which 
means you have to spend more money on transporting a dog.
Your dog will need high-quality food in significantly larger amounts than usual 
and possibly supplements, if your veterinarian recommends them, for the last 
few weeks of her pregnancy and the entire time she’s nursing. If the litter is too 
much for her, you’ll be hand-raising at least some of the puppies, and maybe 
all of them if she becomes unable to nurse. Above all, you have to be prepared 
to deal with a long list of medical emergencies that can threaten the life of both 
mother and puppies and can result in very large veterinary bills.
If your breed requires tail docking (trimming the length) or dewclaw removal 
(surgical removal of the vestigial “thumb”), you’ll need to pay for that, along 
with vaccinations and other health needs. And you’ll be paying for puppy 
food for the last three or four weeks you have the puppies (after they’ve been 
weaned). That’s assuming you can sell the puppies promptly — sometimes 
you can’t.

284
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
You’ll have to take time off work when your dog’s whelping, or giving birth, 
and you should take still more time off to socialize your pups to ensure that 
they become good pets for the people you sell them to. You need to expose 
your puppies to children, men, women, cats, and the normal noises of a 
human household. A litter of puppies is a constant mess-making machine: 
Your washing machine will be going around the clock, and you’ll be begging 
your neighbors for their old newspapers and towels within a week. 
You’ll need a whelping box and hot-water bottles or a special heating element 
or lamp to keep puppies warm when they’re young, because they can’t 
regulate their own temperature well. When they’re up on those pudgy little 
legs, you’ll need an exercise pen to keep them safe and away from the many, 
many things those puppy teeth can decimate.
What if you can’t get the price you want for your puppies? The popularity of 
fad breeds means that, before long, too many puppies are around and prices 
fall accordingly. You may be playing Let’s Make a Deal with the last ones, or 
even giving them away. It’s not unheard of for desperate first-time breeders 
to drop off the remains of a litter at a shelter.
Ask a reputable breeder to help you determine what producing a high-quality 
litter costs. Chances are, you’ll find even more things in the expense column 
than are listed here — things such as ultrasounds to verify pregnancies or 
the cesarean deliveries that are common in some breeds. Litter announcements 
and advertising cost money, too, and hardly a breeder alive hasn’t dealt 
with a disaster that has wiped out an entire litter of dreams and left nothing 
behind but huge veterinary expenses.
Are you still interesting in breeding dogs? If so, read on.
A Dog-Breeding Primer
The business of dog breeding hasn’t changed much over the years: You 
breed the best to the best, and hope for the best. The ways of determining 
quality have changed a great deal, though, and will change even more as 
health screenings move to the chromosome level in the future.
Such progress would likely make the traditional owner of a working sheep or 
hunting dog shake his head. In the old days, if a dog didn’t earn its keep, it 
didn’t live long enough to breed. In some circles today, that’s still the bottom 
line, although more — but not all — of the less-gifted career dogs today find 
homes as pets, be they Greyhounds, Beagles, or Border Collies.

The importance of quality
Because few breeders work their dogs as a shepherd does his, they rely on 
other factors to determine which animals they should breed. They show dogs 
to have judges evaluate their conformation — a measure of how closely they 
conform to the blueprint for the breed, called the standard. Breeders may test 
their dogs’ working or hunting instincts in competitions that re-create the 
conditions of the real thing. They certainly have them tested for hereditary 
defects and consider temperament before breeding. High-quality dogs are 
produced through this selective process. For more on canine competitions, 
see Chapter 6 in Book IV.
You want to breed your dog to the best stud dog you can find, and that 
means the best stud dog for your particular dog — one who is a good match 
for her pedigree, her conformation, and her temperament. The person who 
can best help you find such a dog is an experienced, reputable breeder with 
knowledge of your dog’s breed in general and her pedigree lines in particular. 
A better deal still is if you can convince this experienced breeder to mentor 
you through the mating, pregnancy, delivery, raising, and placing of the 
puppies. Everyone has to start somewhere, and good breeders know this.
If your dog is not of reasonable conformation, such a person may not want to 
work with you or allow a stud dog to breed with your female. It doesn’t hurt 
to ask, though, because breeding your dog to a quality stud dog is a much 
better way to go than breeding her to one that your neighbor, cousin, or 
co-worker owns. The latter may be your only option, however, if your dog is 
not of a quality that should be bred. This verdict means, of course, that you 
shouldn’t breed her.
Heat, mating, and gestation
Your dog should be at least two years old before you consider breeding her, 
because she needs to be more than a puppy herself to be a good mother to 
her babies. She should be in good health to withstand the rigors of pregnancy, 
whelping, and nursing. Her vaccinations should be current, and she should 
be clear of parasites and should be taking heartworm-preventive medicine. 
Tests for genetic defects in her breed should have come back clear, as should 
a test for brucellosis, a disease passed through mating that causes sterility in 
dogs. In other words, you need to be see your veterinarian.
The stud dog, too, must meet these criteria, and you should already have 
chosen him before your dog is ready for breeding. Females are usually sent 
to the stud for breeding. Some are shipped thousands of miles for just the 
right match.

286
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
Some breedings take place without the dogs ever so much as sniffing each 
other, thanks to frozen semen and artificial insemination. Some stud dogs 
have even sired litters after their demise! If the stud dog that suits your dog 
is too far away, discuss this option with the owner of the dog and with your 
veterinarian. This procedure is increasingly common, and the puppies are 
eligible for full registration with the American Kennel Club (AKC) and other 
organizations.
A female comes into season (or heat) for approximately 21 to 30 days every 5 
to 7 months. Her heat begins at the first sign of bleeding and ends when she 
loses interest in breeding. The female does not become interested in breeding 
until a week or so after her season begins. Although your veterinarian can 
pinpoint when she is most likely to be successfully bred, the dog has a pretty 
good idea herself, flirting with the males and standing with her tail up in her 
best canine come-hither gesture.
The males don’t need that much encouragement. Her smell from the first day 
of her season has been driving them wild, and the only thing that has kept 
them from mating with her sooner has been her refusal to allow it.
As soon as the first signs of season appear, you should finalize arrangements 
with the stud dog’s owner and send your dog to the stud so she can be there 
when she’s ready to breed.
An experienced breeder can best handle your dog at this point. She allows 
the dogs to become comfortable with one another and, when the female 
is interested, does what it takes to get the job done, including holding the 
female for the male and even inserting the male’s penis into the female if the 
stud is inexperienced. Far from being embarrassed about such things, the 
experienced breeder considers it just another job that must be done to 
produce puppies.
The male starts to ejaculate soon after he starts thrusting, but the most 
sperm-rich semen is released after the action appears to have stopped and 
the so-called tie begins. The base of the canine penis swells while inside the 
female, locking the dogs together to give the sperm a chance to impregnate — 
and keeping competitors at bay. After the tie begins, the male turns away 
from the female so that the two are positioned rump to rump. This stage can 
last for more than a half hour before the swelling goes down and the dogs 
break apart.
 
If it lasts for more than two hours, call your veterinarian.

Whelping
Pregnancy ranges from 58 to 70 days, during which you should follow your 
veterinarian’s instructions on prenatal care. A couple of weeks before her 
due date, you should prepare a whelping box — a place for her to have her 
puppies, placed in an out-of-the-way corner of your home. For large breeds, 
a plastic kiddy pool lined with layers and layers of newsprint works well; 
smaller breeds may use the bottom half of a shipping crate. The most 
important characteristic in a whelping box is that it can be easily cleaned.
 
Printed newspapers are messy, so try to get unprinted newsprint. Your local 
newspaper may sell — or give away — the ends of the giant newsprint rolls 
that go onto the presses.
Final preparations for long-coated breeds include clipping the hair on her 
hind end very short, to keep puppies from getting caught, and on her belly 
to make the nipple area neater. (Don’t worry about how awful she looks; 
she’ll lose even more fur on her own before it’s all over and look even more 
dreadful.)
Talk to your veterinarian one last time about what to expect. Ideally, if you’ve 
been working with an experienced breeder, he’ll be there to help you as your 
dog starts labor. He may suggest an ultrasound or X-ray to aid in predicting 
the size of the litter and identifying any potential problems with the delivery.
A day before the big date, your dog will probably lose her appetite and 
become more restless. She may dig in laundry piles; show her to her 
whelping box instead — you may need to be persistent, but she should have 
her litter where you can care for them best. Take her temperature: A dip to 
99 degrees shows that labor is near. Make sure that you know where your 
veterinarian — or the closest emergency clinic — is and cancel all your 
plans, because the time is near.
Take the puppies and their mother to the veterinarian within the first day 
after the birth to make sure that everything’s okay with them all. If dewclaws 
are to be removed and tails docked, discuss these procedures with your 
veterinarian right away — these minor surgeries need to be done before the 
age of 3 days. While experienced breeders often complete these procedures 
themselves, a novice breeder should not even attempt it — have your 
veterinarian take care of it.
 
Another job in those first few days: paperwork. Send in litter registration so 
that you get individual registration forms back in plenty of time to provide to 
puppy buyers. Contact the registry for more information on what’s required.

The Principles of Breeding Dogs
Every foundation animal you buy, whether male or female, toy breed or giant, 
is the result of some kind of a breeding program. Breeding programs run the 
gamut from intelligent and conscientious to haphazard and irresponsible. 
Your stock should be a result of the former, and by this time you should 
understand why stock from a quality program is so important.
Every good breeder approaches her mission in a slightly different manner. 
You’ll find that, more often than not, experienced and successful breeders are 
adamantly dedicated to their own method. It shouldn’t come as any surprise 
that their dedication to a particular approach is a result of that approach 
having worked for them over the years.
Interestingly, all the various theories and breeding strategies can be 
categorized into three basic controlled breeding programs, which derive 
their names from the degree of relationship between the two dogs mated:
 
 Inbreeding: Breeding within the immediate family
 
 Linebreeding: Breeding among more-remotely-related family members
 
 Outcrossing: Breeding from the same breed but with no common 
ancestors within five generations
Inbreeding
Inbreeding is, as many geneticists have proclaimed, a powerful two-edged 
sword.
 
Don’t attempt inbreeding if you don’t have in-depth knowledge of all the good 
and bad points of the individuals who stand behind the two animals being 
mated. Inbreeding can intensify desirable characteristics to the degree that 
the resulting offspring are highly dependable for producing the desirable 
qualities. However, inbreeding can also call forth catastrophic consequences.
Inbreeding increases the chance that a gene obtained from the one parent 
will duplicate (match) one obtained from the other. This is the case for 
everything — both what is desirable and what is undesirable. Often, harmful 
and sometimes lethal genes float around in the pedigrees of dogs within a 
breed.

289
 Chapter 7: Dog Breeding 101
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
Knowledgeable breeders are apt to know if and where these genes exist. 
They use the utmost care in bringing together animals in any mating that may 
reproduce these abnormalities. In some circumstances, experienced breeders 
intentionally make breedings that risk such results, but they always have 
specific reasons for doing so. Only carefully selected individuals from those 
matings are retained for breeding; all others are neutered and eliminated 
from the gene pool.
 
Inbreeding can be scientifically defined as the mating of individuals more 
closely related than the average of the population that they come from. In 
other words, what may be considered inbreeding in a new breed with a small 
gene pool may not be considered inbreeding in a long-established breed that 
has hundreds, if not thousands, of dogs in the gene pool to draw upon.
In layman’s terms, and for our purposes here, inbreeding is best explained 
as the mating of two directly related animals. Most dog breeders consider the 
following as inbreeding:
 
 Father bred to daughter
 
 Son bred to mother
 
 Full brother bred to full sister
 
One frequently hears people who are not familiar with intelligent breeding 
practices blame inbreeding for producing the health or temperament 
problems that exist in popular breeds. This assertion is seldom, if ever, true. 
Inbreeding isn’t the main cause of a preponderance of health problems in 
a breed. People who lack knowledge of a breed’s background do, however, 
create problems of this nature. If two dogs, closely related or not, who have 
a debilitating problem are mated, the chances of all the offspring having the 
problem obviously will be very high. Moreover, if the two animals who are 
mated are themselves free of the problem, but the problem runs rampant 
in the genetic makeup of their immediate ancestors, the chances of their 
passing it along are, for all intents and purposes, just as high as if they were 
afflicted themselves. 
Linebreeding
Scientifically speaking, linebreeding and inbreeding are the same. The 
intensity is all that differs. In other words, if inbreeding increases the chance 
that a gene obtained from the one parent will duplicate (match) one obtained 
from the other, linebreeding reduces but does not eliminate those chances.

290
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
Although inexperienced breeders should not attempt inbreeding, intelligent 
breeders are also aware that a pedigree made up of dogs who are related 
only by breed won’t ever provide any consistency or lock in any of the good 
traits that are necessary to maintain. Furthermore, it’s doubtful that even 
the accidental outstanding individuals can be relied upon to reproduce 
themselves.
Linebreeding, then, is the best way to concentrate the qualities possessed 
by certain outstanding animals in the pedigree without running the risks of 
inbreeding. The certainty of getting what is desired is not as great through 
linebreeding as it is through inbreeding, but neither is the risk of intensifying 
highly undesirable traits.
Outcrossing
When no common ancestors appear within five generations of the two 
individuals being mated, the breeding is generally considered an outcross. 
True outcrosses are somewhat unlikely if breeders are working within 
popular bloodlines — popular meaning the bloodlines that are producing the 
kinds of dogs who are winning at the dog shows.
Outcrossing is the opposite of inbreeding. This method of breeding mates 
individuals of the same breed who, for all intents and purposes, are not 
related. This approach is less likely to fix faults in the offspring, but neither 
can it concentrate specific qualities with any certainty.
A certain look or style within a breed will become popular because it does 
well at the shows. Usually this style will emanate from a successful breeder’s 
line or be stamped by an especially dominant stud dog. Other breeders will 
invariably attempt to incorporate that winning look into their own line. They 
do so either by dipping lightly into the winning line by making a single 
breeding to it, or by heavily reshaping their breeding program around the 
line that is producing the winning look. As a consequence, the breed as it 
is popularly seen becomes influenced to a greater or lesser degree by a few 
dogs from the source that began the trend. Eventually, hardly a dog in sight 
doesn’t have at least a touch of the popular line somewhere, thereby making 
a true outcross breeding very rare.
Choosing Your Own Style
So which is the best way to go: linebreeding, inbreeding, or outcrossing? The 
following sections offer some thoughts.

291
 Chapter 7: Dog Breeding 101
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
The conservative breeder
Some breeders have a very clear-cut interpretation of the standard and stay 
within the lines that will produce that look and temperament, regardless of 
trends. Fads come and go, but these breeders stand by their linebreeding 
program that produces what they believe is correct and refuse to change 
hats even when that refusal slows the accumulation of those coveted blue 
ribbons.
Sticking by your line isn’t always an easy thing to do. The trends can become 
so all encompassing that your dog becomes what you may call odd man out — 
the only dog in the lineup that looks different. It takes the knowledgeable 
judge who has the courage of his own convictions to decide which style is 
really right for the breed and to reward it accordingly. These diehard breeders 
often weather the storms of unpopularity and are there waiting when the 
winds of change calm down. In a good many cases, these kennels prove to be 
where newer breeders find the foundation stock that sets them in the right 
direction.
Keeping an eye on the prize
Other breeders keep abreast of trends within a breed and adapt their lines 
to keep pace. They are attracted to the qualities of the dog of the hour and 
use him, or the bloodline that produced him, in their own breeding program. 
These same individuals often have an eye for those winning qualities and are 
able to pick the dog most likely to succeed from their own litters. Soon they 
are out and winning with dogs sporting the new look.
Usually a significant amount of outcrossing is involved in breeding programs 
of this kind. Reliability is not the long suit of the line. Outcrossing can be 
a hit-and-miss affair, but breeders who subscribe to this approach seem 
entirely satisfied with those occasional hits that come along, because often 
they’re big hits and account for highly successful win records.
Outcrossing for elusive qualities
Outcross breeding isn’t done only to follow a fad or trend. When properly 
employed, outcrosses can bring qualities to a breeder’s line that she sorely 
needs. Many intelligent breeders resort to occasional outcross breedings for 
very sound reasons. At times, a breeder’s line will generally satisfy the breed 
standard in all respects but one or two — say, for example, pigment and eye 
color. The breeder finds that, try as she might, those qualities remain elusive 
within the line.

292
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
The logical thing to do, then, is to seek out another line (one known to 
consistently produce good pigment and eye color) and make a breeding, or 
sometimes two, into that line. Often this breeding requires outcrossing into 
another line that doesn’t bear a close relationship to one’s own. The method 
is more apt to succeed if the outcross line is closely linebred, because the 
chances of its being dominant for the desired qualities are higher. The dog 
whose appearance (also called phenotype) is not backed up by a concentration 
of the genes for that quality (genotype) may not be strong enough to pass 
along that quality to another, stronger line.
Sex-linked characteristics: 
Finding the formula
In addition to inbreeding, linebreeding, and outcrossing, breeders have to 
factor in another approach. In some cases, the sexes of the individual dogs 
who are used have a great bearing on which characteristics are passed along. 
These traits are called sex-linked characteristics.
In some cases, for example, the male is best at bringing in the quality you 
need from another line. In other instances, the female is more apt to give you 
what you want. It’s almost as if Mother Nature is taunting you by giving you 
part but not all of the equation. Then it’s up to you to find the missing piece 
and come up with the right answers.
Breeders who set out to improve their line or correct faults, instead of simply 
accepting them as part of the territory, may need generations of dogs to do 
so. In the end, however, the persevering breeder usually accomplishes this 
goal.
Getting an animal good enough to show is one thing. Getting one good 
enough to carry on your breeding program or to take the breed one step 
farther along the line of progress takes time and perseverance, and often 
leads to great disappointment. However, the dogs who carry breeds to 
greater heights in the show ring, in competitive events, and as producers are 
usually the result of someone’s willingness to deal with all these setbacks.
Start with the Bitches
 
Absolutely nothing is more important to your breeding program than starting 
with a well-bred female of representative quality.
And now is as good a time as any to start using the term bitch rather than 
female. Everyone you deal with in the dog world refers to the two canine 
sexes as dogs (males) and bitches (females). If you want to work your way 

293
 Chapter 7: Dog Breeding 101
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
through elementary levels of your education in dog breeding, you may as well 
start using the terminology the pros use. And if you’re waiting for a pun or 
joke about this lingo, well, in this particular instance you’re going to be 
disappointed.
Why you don’t need to keep males
 
The hobby breeder who’s interested only in establishing a breeding program 
and setting a distinctive, yet representative, style needs to house only 
bitches. It’s absolutely pointless — in fact, counterproductive — for any 
beginning breeder to house males.
The male will seldom, if ever, be used on the mother who produced him or 
on his sisters or his daughters. (As already mentioned, on a rare occasion a 
very experienced breeder will resort to this kind of inbreeding, but only in 
special, well-thought-out circumstances.) If you can’t use him on any of the 
dogs in your own breeding program, what would be the reason for keeping 
him there?
If it’s for those thousands of dollars you think you’ll make on stud services, 
think again. Breeding dogs for profitable stud purposes is a highly specialized 
activity, best pursued after many years of successful dog breeding. To 
properly use a male, you have to go out and purchase the right female to 
breed to him. Doing so puts you right back at square one, with nothing to do 
but repeat the breeding over and over again. You’ll have lots of offspring, but 
nothing to help you carry on a breeding program. All the dogs will be bred 
exactly the same — too closely to breed to each other.
 
The pointlessness of keeping a male becomes even more obvious when 
you stop to realize that you have access to any top-producing male in the 
country. And you can use a different male with each breeding.
The importance of foundation bitches
Successful breeders around the world agree on two things: First, beginners 
must go to a successful breeder for their foundation stock. Second, it’s 
critical for the beginning breeder to buy the best possible daughter they can 
afford from the breed’s best-producing dam (the term for a bitch used in 
breeding).
You may ask why these knowledgeable people have advised buying a 
daughter of a top-producing dam rather than the dam herself. To quote 
Norma Hamilton, a world-renowned breeder of the Quailmoor Irish Setters of 
Australia: “Only the person who has taken total leave of their senses would 
ever part with the great producing bitch herself. It would be like giving away 
your sails and then showing up to compete in the America’s Cup.”

294
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
Without a doubt, your bitch is the cornerstone — the very foundation — of 
everything you will do as a breeder. Don’t even think of economizing in this 
respect.
Successful breeders also seem to agree that the foundation bitch doesn’t 
have to be what could be described as a “glamour girl” — one who has won 
yards of blue ribbons. Records seem to indicate that as long as her bloodline 
credentials are impeccable, and she’s well made and sound in all respects, 
her chances of being a noteworthy producer are very good.
 
If you can possibly arrange to do so, purchase two daughters of the producing 
bitch. They could be litter sisters or even half-sisters with different sires. 
There’s no better way to assure yourself of establishing a tidy little producing 
nucleus than through obtaining high-quality sisters. The possibilities of 
breeding them out and then returning to your own line with the offspring are 
endless.
Having both quality male and female offspring emerge from even your 
earliest breedings isn’t entirely unusual. But again, it’s not necessary or 
advisable to keep any of the males in-house, no matter how good they are.
When you breed a fine male
When and if you do breed that great male, have no fear — you’ll be able to 
make all sorts of breeding arrangements so that you will have access to him 
down the line when and if you have a bitch who’s appropriate to breed to 
him. Don’t sit up nights worrying about what to do if that one-in-a-million 
male comes along. And that’s what the chances are of your producing him in 
your first litters — one in a million, if that high.
You’ll have a line from here to Timbuktu waiting at your door if you have a 
top, show-quality male to place, with top meaning the very best. Trying to 
place the average, just-good-enough-to-become-a-champion male is not so 
easy. Average is easy to come by; tops is not. Furthermore, a male of only 
average quality is not one that others will seek out for breeding, nor should 
he be. The bull’s-eye is the only thing you’re aiming for.
Moving Outward: Making Partnerships
Working with bloodlines that seem to click, after a time you may find that you 
are coming up with a considerable percentage of high-quality, intelligently 
linebred bitches. In fact, you may be coming up with a few more than you can 
house properly but are afraid to let go entirely.

You now face the small-breeder’s dilemma: deciding which to keep — the 
females who have proven they can produce for you or the females who have 
been produced and are one step farther along in your quest for improvement?
One solution is partnership. Working closely with a partner, even the most 
limited breeder can create miracles. Naturally, the partners must have basically 
similar goals in mind and agree on what constitutes the essence of the breed. 
Both partners must also be dedicated to setting type and maintaining it. 
And neither should be unduly influenced by win records or fads and fancies. 
The partnership is a marriage of sorts. Be sure to pick someone with whom 
you’re compatible.
A good many, if not most of Great Britain’s great show-winning dog exports to 
America were dogs whelped in the most modest of homes — in the kitchen 
behind the stove, so to speak. The dogs shared living quarters with their 
owners, and their exercise came from being put out in the garden several 
times a day and from taking walks around the block with dad or the kids.
 
It’s not how elaborately the dogs are kept — it’s how good they are that 
counts.
Establishing and maintaining type in this day and age isn’t easy. But then, 
it never really was, except perhaps for the few breeders blessed with the 
means to maintain those super kennels of the past. Can it be done today? Of 
course it can.
Small hobby breeders all over the world limit themselves to one litter a year 
or less. These small but important breeders are counted among the most 
influential in their respective breeds. Their influence didn’t come about in a 
day, a week, or a year. It took time.
Breeding partnerships in Russia
No greater proof exists of the value of 
breeding partnerships than the breeders in 
Russia. Restricted by 70 years of communist 
domination, purebred dog breeders networked 
their breeding programs between partnerships 
of sometimes five, six, and seven breeders, 
many of them living in apartment complexes. All 
of them were severely handicapped by the lack 
of funds and the lack of nutritional supplements 
for their dogs. Even so, when the Iron Curtain 
was lifted, quality sprang forth as if from an 
underground stream.

So You Have Puppies: Now What?
 
If you want to increase the chances of raising your puppies right — and be 
reassured that your puppies are “normal” — knowing how puppies mature 
is helpful. As with children, growth stages each have their wonders and their 
challenges. The stages pass too quickly, so to get the most out of the puppy 
experience, clear your calendar of nondog activities and keep your eyes 
open.
All puppies look much the same when they’re born. You find size and marking 
differences, but they each come into this world looking something like a 
sausage, with tiny ears, tiny legs, and tightly closed eyes. Things start to 
change before long.
 
Although people have raised puppies for thousands of years, most of what 
we know about how people can influence a puppy’s development — and 
about developmental stages in puppies — goes back only around 50 years, 
starting with the work of John Paul Scott and John L. Fuller in the 1950s. From 
their “school for dogs” in Bar Harbor, Maine, came the basis of what trainers 
and breeders have been using to get the most out of dogs ever since. Animal 
Behavior (John Paul Scott, University of Chicago Press) is a fascinating, if 
dated, place to start a study of dog behavior. Fuller and Scott teamed up with 
Genetics and the Social Behavior of Dogs, also from the University of Chicago 
Press. Although they’re out of print, many libraries have these books, and a 
good secondhand bookseller should be able to find copies without too much 
trouble.
You can find more recent — and less academic — treatment of the subject 
in many subsequent books. Examples include Carol Lea Benjamin’s Mother 
Knows Best: The Natural Way To Train Your Dog (Howell Book House); How 
To Raise a Puppy You Can Live With, by Clarice Rutherford and veterinarian 
David H. Neil (Alpine Press); and The Art of Raising a Puppy, by the Monks of 
the New Skete Monastery (Little, Brown).
Whelping and emergencies
Most dogs are natural whelpers and may not need your help at all. Many a 
dog owner has fallen asleep waiting for the big event only to wake up to a box 
full of puppies born, cleaned up, and nursing. If your dog isn’t quite so efficient, 
you have to release the puppies from their amniotic sacs within 30 seconds 
or so and help them to breathe on their own. Clean the fluid from their 
mouths and noses by supporting their heads and swinging them between 
your legs, stopping sharply. You can also remove fluid with a bulb syringe. 
Rub the puppy with a clean towel and put her on a nipple. Above all, keep the 
puppies warm.

If the mother doesn’t sever the umbilical cord, you may need to do that, too: 
Tie it off about an inch from the puppy with a thread soaked in alcohol and 
then snip with clean scissors. Dab the ends with Betadine to combat infection.
While many experienced breeders are sometimes as capable as any 
veterinarian when it comes to saving puppies, the novice breeder should 
not hesitate to get veterinary help quickly. You must take your dam to the 
veterinarian when any of the following occurs:
 
 She fails to enter labor 24 to 36 hours after her temperature dips to 99 
degrees.
 
 She’s in labor, and more than four hours lapse with no puppy being 
born, especially if a dark green fluid passes.
 
 She seems very uncomfortable and is panting heavily.
 
 A puppy gets stuck while being delivered.
 
 She has a puppy, and 30 minutes pass without another puppy being 
born, yet she’s having strong contractions.
 
 If she doesn’t expel an afterbirth, or placenta, for each puppy. Retained 
afterbirths can trigger infections.
 
If in doubt about anything, call your vet. Your dam may need more help than 
you can give her, including a cesarean section. If everything goes well, clean 
the mother with Betadine while she cleans up the nest — eating the afterbirths 
is a normal part of the process.
 
An important after-birth problem to look out for: If your nursing mom 
becomes restless, agitated, and trembling, call the veterinarian and say 
you’re on the way. She may need calcium treatments for a condition called 
eclampsia.
Birth to 3 weeks
Puppies are pretty helpless at birth. They can’t see or hear and need their 
mother for everything. She is their source for food, warmth, and protection; 
they cannot even eliminate waste without her gentle licking to stimulate the 
process.
Newborn pups can crawl and right themselves when turned over, and they 
can seek out food by smell. They can also seek out the warmth of their 
littermates — they are unable at this stage to regulate their own body 
temperature. On the outside, this time seems quiet — puppies at this age 
sleep almost constantly — but a lot of development is going on inside their 
brains and central nervous systems.

298
Book II: Dog Nutrition and Health 
 
Leave them alone, except for one thing: Handle them briefly and gently on a 
daily basis and subject them to the tiniest amount of stress in the process. 
Puppy-raising experts believe this little bit of stress — such as placing them 
on a scale — is as important as handling in the development of a confident 
dog.
Even this early in a puppy’s life, some temperament patterns are set. If you 
watch, you can already see which puppies will later become dominant with 
their siblings. These pups are the ones who push others out of the way at 
nursing time —frequent weighings will prove that the pushier pups will grow 
faster. Other pups are more wiggly, act nervous, or cry during handling. Be 
sure to note all these things.
Toward the end of the second week, the puppies start to open their eyes, 
although they see little more than light at this point. In the third week, the 
first teeth appear, and puppies start to hear. By the end of the third week, the 
sausages look like puppies, and they’re ready to start exploring the world.
 
What if you have a litter of black Labrador puppies? How can you possibly 
tell one from another enough to follow and record changes in the early weeks 
when personalities are not so obvious? Use this trick: Make little collars of 
rickrack, a decorative zigzag trim material available in fabric stores, using 
a different color for each puppy. You won’t have to resort to this tactic, of 
course, if you can note the puppies’ markings to keep things straight.
3 to 5 weeks
During this stage, puppies start relying less on their mother and begin to 
learn from each other. They learn to play and to eat solid food.
Even as all this activity is happening — a wealth of new experiences, 
overwhelming their new senses of vision and hearing — the puppies are 
learning the rudiments of canine communication and social structure. 
Puppies start to learn when to use their sharp little teeth and, more 
important, when they cannot use them. Their mother teaches them some of 
this behavior, using her teeth to correct but not hurt them. In play with each 
other, an observer hears plenty of cries and squeals as bites are delivered 
just a little too hard, and puppies learn to inhibit their bites, delivering them 
with a force that matches the situation. (When puppies don’t learn to inhibit 
biting from their mother and littermates, problems are bound to occur when 
they’re in their new homes.)
Although puppies are most interested in each other at this stage, you should 
be busy reminding them that there are people in the world, too. Make sure 
that their environment is always changing and continue to handle the 
puppies, making sure that each gets individual attention. Expose the 

299
 Chapter 7: Dog Breeding 101
Book II
Dog 
Nutrition 
and Health
puppies to both genders and to children as well as adults. If a cat lives in 
the house, even better — although do your cat a favor and let him choose his 
interactions. His mere presence is enough to expose the puppies to the 
existence of felines.
Start weaning the puppies after three weeks. Discuss with your veterinarian 
or mentor the type of soft food to offer the puppies, and help the pups get 
the idea by putting the food on your finger and helping it into their mouths.
 
Puppy pans — doughnut-shaped dishes with a low outer rim — are ideal for 
giving every pup a place at the “table.”
When puppies are eating semisolid food, the mother will quit cleaning up 
the nest by eating their waste — so the task of keeping puppies clean falls 
entirely to you now. About this time, the mother will start helping the weaning 
process by spending more time away from her babies. Understandably, she’s 
getting a little sick of them.
5 to 7 weeks
The biggest mistake you can make in this period is to remove a puppy from 
the litter and send him to a new home. This practice is probably based on the 
idea that weaning is the logical time for puppies to be sold — puppies can 
start on hard kibble around six weeks — but the research emphatically insists 
that this “logic” is wrong.
Puppies have a lot more learning to do during these two weeks, and they 
need to be with their littermates to do it. Think of this period as the time of 
more. Puppies can see more, hear more, and play more at this stage. They 
are starting to become more interested in the world beyond their enclosure. 
They are especially attracted to those funny two-legged dogs who have 
spent the last few weeks picking them up, talking to them, and petting them. 
Suddenly, they think humans are pretty cool.
This stage is when humans think puppies are pretty cool, too. Puppies are 
absolutely adorable now, with the softest fur and the cutest faces. They run 
with a rolling, bouncing puppy gait, tripping over their big paws at times. 
They roughhouse with each other and stalk their toys. They drive their 
mother crazy — she is interested in spending as little time with them as 
possible now.
They are still learning, but what a fun time they’re having.
 
Spend a lot of time with them at this stage, because their socializing is in full 
swing. Keep exposing them to the sights and sounds of life all the way up to 
the time they go to their new homes — ideally, after their seventh week.

Finding Proper Homes for Puppies
 
If you’ve done your job right, you have something truly remarkable to offer 
puppy buyers: fat, friendly, well-socialized puppies who promise a lifetime 
of good health and companionship. You want to be sure that the people who 
take them are worthy of such wonderful pups.
To find good potential owners, you need to be extra careful in screening 
homes. You mustn’t just accept money from the first half-dozen people who 
walk through your door. If you’ve been working with a reputable breeder, ask 
for her help in placing the puppies. Ask prospective buyers these questions:
 
 What is your living arrangement? You don’t need a house with a 
yard — some dogs, even large ones, do just fine in apartments. But you 
do need a person who’s aware of what a dog needs and is prepared to 
deliver it. Definitely say no to anyone who plans to stick one of your 
pups on a chain in the yard.
 
 Have you had dogs before? What kinds, and what happened to them? 
Wrong answers include “lots” and “they ran away,” “we moved,” or “he 
got hit.” Accidents happen to even the most conscientious of dog lovers, 
but a pattern of mishaps says a great deal about the way the prospective 
buyer treats dogs.
 
 Do you have any experience with this breed? What do you expect of 
it? You want to educate — and possibly eliminate from contention — 
anyone who isn’t prepared to deal with the reality of living with a dog 
like yours. Don’t sell to a person who isn’t prepared for the shedding of 
a long-haired dog or the activity level of a terrier, for example. Be honest 
with buyers about the drawbacks of the breed, and you’re much more 
likely to put your puppies in homes that will keep them, because they 
know what to expect.
 
 Do you have children? What ages? Some dogs, as with delicate toys, 
just don’t work out well with children. Still, be flexible. A thoughtful, 
gentle child could work out fine. Discuss your concerns and see what 
answers you get.
 
 Do you intend to breed your dog? Show your dog? Train your dog? 
Your pet-quality puppies — ones with obvious show faults, such as 
wrong markings — should be sold on contracts that require them to 
be spayed or neutered. (Some breeders have the surgery taken care of 
before their puppies go to their new homes.) People who are interested 
in training and competing with their dogs are people who plan to be 
involved in their pup’s life, and that’s the kind of thing you like to see. 
Look, too, for people who travel with their pets or obviously treat them 
like family.

301

Be cordial and informative, but be persistent. Check references, including 
calling their veterinarian. A person who has had numerous pets and doesn’t 
have a veterinary reference is another to cross off your list. Don’t be afraid to 
turn people down. Sure, it may not be pleasant, but you must do what’s best 
for your puppies. You’ve put a lot of effort into them, and you want them to 
live with someone who will continue to love and care for them as you have. 
You want your puppies to go to good homes, and the only one who has a 
chance at making that happen is you. So do your best.
If you are considering breeding your dog again, you need to skip at least a 
season to give her time to recover. In any case, one or two litters are about 
all you should ask of her if she’s to enjoy just being a member of your family. 
As soon as her motherhood days are behind her, arrange for her to be 
spayed, to give her the best chance at a healthy life.
Another reason to spay her quickly: If you keep a puppy, you may be positively 
shocked to find your girl pregnant again — thanks to her own son. Many 
folks have been surprised to find that their dog becomes pregnant, because 
the only male she’d been around was a pup from her last litter. “But that’s 
incest!” these people say, shocked. “Don’t they know better?”
Unfortunately, they don’t.

rooming . . . the froufrou doggie beauty parlor, complete with bows, 
silly hairstyles, and nail polish. It doesn’t have to be that way, but 
grooming is important any way you brush it. Your dog feels as uncomfortable 
as you do when his hair is all ratty and snarled. But grooming is also vital for 
his health. And it means more than just a bath — it includes brushing, 
combing, keeping his teeth and ears clean, clipping his nails, and keeping him 
in top shape. In this chapter, you get an overview of dog grooming and why 
it’s so important for your dog’s well-being. You also find out how much time 
and money it takes to keep your dog well groomed and when to call in a pro.
Big Hairy Deal: Why Grooming 
Is Important
Your dog isn’t healthy if she doesn’t look good outside. A lackluster coat 
or one that’s plagued with external parasites and sores is just the tip of the 
iceberg. If she looks icky outside, she probably feels icky inside, too. A dog’s 
coat mirrors her health. And her outward appearance can be a signal of 
internal problems that no amount of brushing can fix. 

306
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
Keeping clean company
When your dog is clean, you want him around more so you can bond and 
enjoy each other’s company. Sure, he likes to play in the dirt and roll in 
distasteful stuff, but he also likes how it feels to be clean, just like you do. In 
the end, you and everyone around you are less likely to enjoy having a dirty, 
smelly dog around. A clean, refreshing one is definitely a more enjoyable 
companion.
Presenting a positive public image
Keeping your dog clean says something about you; it says that you’re a 
responsible dog owner and that you care for your dog. You may be able to 
take your dog places where dogs aren’t usually allowed. If it takes only a 
glance to see that you take care of your dogs and that they’re well mannered, 
rules can often be bent.
Your dog no doubt will join you on walks outside your home, but you may 
occasionally do other things together, such as go to special events or even 
compete in various dog sports and activities. Maybe you want to do some 
social work, such as visiting the sick or elderly. Your dog could become a 
therapy dog, but being clean and friendly is crucial under those circumstances. 
No one wants to pet a dirty dog, no matter how lovable.
 
Dogs aren’t always allowed everywhere you want to take them, no matter 
how well behaved and well groomed they are. Sometimes health department 
regulations come into play, so make sure that you always get permission 
before you take a dog to a place that doesn’t normally accept them.
Eliminating the spread of dirt and disease
Dirty dogs track dirt into your home and get dirt on your clothing, furniture, 
and carpet. Ungroomed dogs are also more likely to be infected by internal 
and external parasites — fleas and ticks — and can harbor dangerous 
diseases, such as bubonic plague (yes, really), typhus, Lyme disease, and 
Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which can make you and your family sick. If 
your dog is ungroomed, she may be carrying fungi such as ringworm that 
young kids and the elderly can catch. Keeping your dog clean through good 
grooming eliminates many potential health problems.

Determining whether something’s really 
wrong with your dog internally
Plenty of good reasons exist for grooming your dog. One of them is finding 
out the difference between a coat that looks bad because it’s dirty and one 
that looks bad because something is wrong with your dog. Grooming also 
eliminates various problems associated with an ill-kept dog, such as external 
parasites or open sores caused by a matted and dirty coat that traps bacteria.
A lackluster coat can be a sign of one or more serious problems, including 
the following:
 
 Poor nutrition
 
 Allergies
 
 Internal parasites
 
 Hormonal imbalances or diseases
 
 External parasites
 
 Cancer
 
 Other diseases
Any one of these problems can severely shorten your dog’s life or, in extreme 
conditions, kill your dog outright. Grooming your dog helps separate potential 
health problems from problems caused by not properly caring for your dog.
Coaching your canine to be groomed
Grooming your dog requires partnership. 
Although you don’t necessarily need your 
dog’s full compliance when grooming, it sure 
makes things easier. Good grooming starts 
when your dog is a puppy. Getting her used to 
routine tasks, like being brushed and combed 
and having her feet handled so you can clip her 
toenails, is all part of grooming. If you wait until 
the dog is grown, your dog may fight you, and 
you may end up with results neither of you like.
Teaching your dog simple cues, such as Sit, 
Down, and Stay, is important in wise grooming. 
If you can’t keep your dog in one place, it’s 
very hard to do anything. Chapter 3 in Book IV 
provides advice for training your dog to enjoy 
grooming (or at least tolerate it and cooperate).

Considering the Necessary Investment
You may be wondering just how much it costs to have a good-looking dog. 
You may have even visited the local groomer to find out how much bathing 
and/or clipping your dog costs. If so, you know it can be a bit pricey. The 
truth is, when you start grooming your dog, you can take certain basic steps 
just to get by, all the while keeping an eye out for bargains on good equipment 
and supplies. It’s not all about money, though. Your time is worth something, 
and grooming requires some of that, too.
You may find grooming expensive in time and money, or you may find it 
relatively inexpensive. Much of the cost of grooming depends on the breed, 
what type of hair your dog has, and whether you’re grooming your dog as 
a pet or for show. The following sections can help you figure out how much 
time and money you need to keep your pup well groomed.
The cost in money
The bad news is that good grooming supplies are fairly expensive. The good 
news is that after you dole out the initial investment for your equipment, you 
probably won’t encounter that expense again unless something breaks or 
wears out.
How much does at-home grooming cost compared to a year’s worth of 
grooming sessions from a pro? Well, if you’re paying from $20 to $50 a month 
in grooming, you’re paying $240 to $600 a year. You can buy some pretty 
nice grooming equipment for that amount of money, meaning that doing it 
yourself pays off during the first year or two, and you’re saving that much 
every year from then on.
Some dogs need more grooming equipment and supplies than others. For 
example, a dog who needs daily brushing and regular clipping will need more 
equipment than a dog with a wash-and-wear coat. (See “Getting Familiar with 
Your Dog’s Coat” later in this chapter, for more on fur types.)
The cost in time
Think about both the work and the fun factors when you bathe or brush your 
dog. Grooming your dog is as much a necessity as housetraining your dog or 
taking him to the vet for an annual exam, but whether it’s a joy or a chore is 
up to you. When considering doing the grooming yourself, be aware of the 
following:

309
 Chapter 1: What Good Grooming Is All About
Book III
Cleanliness 
Is Next to 
Dogliness: 
Grooming
 
 The shorter your dog’s coat, the less grooming he’ll need.
 
 The smaller the dog, the less grooming he’ll need.
 
 A dog with long hair or a double coat takes more time to groom than one 
with a medium- or short-haired coat.
 
 Different procedures take different amounts of time. A quick brushing 
with a well-maintained coat takes less time than a bath (see Chapter 2 in 
Book III for more).
 
 The condition of your dog’s coat dictates the amount of time grooming 
takes. Brushing out a clean dog with a well-maintained coat takes very 
little time when compared to one with a dirty, matted coat.
 
 Dogs with wash-and-wear (short-haired) coats can usually get away with 
once-a-week grooming.
 
 Dogs with average coats can usually get away with twice-a-week grooming.
 
 Dogs with high-maintenance coats need to be groomed three times or 
more per week.
 
 When some dogs are adolescents or when they’re shedding, they 
require coat care every day.
When planning your initial grooming session, set aside at least two hours, 
because you’ll be going more slowly and your dog’s coat may not be in the 
best condition. Later you can whittle down your grooming sessions to an 
hour or even a half hour as you get better at grooming and your dog’s coat is 
better maintained.
 
If you don’t have the time to groom your dog’s coat into good shape, 
consider first taking him to a professional groomer and then maintaining the 
coat after the groomer works it into manageable shape. Your dog’s coat can 
achieve the proper condition without using too much of your valuable time.
The added investment: Grooming for show
Grooming your dog for show costs plenty more in terms of time and money 
over what you’d spend on grooming a pet dog. Special show clips and 
stripped breeds (such as Terriers, whose grooming requires hair removal) 
usually take a while to develop and maintain. Many coats benefit from special 
leave-in coat conditioners, bodifiers, and coat dressings. (See Chapter 6 in 
Book IV for more information on showing your dog.)

Getting Familiar with Your Dog’s Coat
Dogs have some amazing coats, ranging from curly to straight, puffy to 
wiry, short to long, and every variation in between. Some dogs even come 
equipped with dreadlocks!
It’s hard to believe that the wolf produced descendants with such wide 
varieties of coats, but it did. You have to evaluate the type of coat your dog 
has, and that determines the grooming equipment and supplies you need. 
The following sections cover differences in the basic types of coats.
Coat types: Single versus double
Dogs basically have two types of coats:
 
 Double coat: Most dogs have a double coat (also called a two-ply coat) 
that consists of a top coat and an undercoat. The top coat is composed 
of stiffer guard hairs, which tend to be naturally water repellant. Top 
coats protect the dog’s skin and undercoat, acting as a natural guard 
against the elements. The undercoat is a fleecy or downy type of fur 
that’s shorter than the top coat. The undercoat serves as insulation to 
keep the dog warm during cold or inhospitable weather. Dogs shed (or 
blow out) the undercoat twice a year — it’s a seasonal action.
 
 Single coat: Some dogs have a single coat, in which only a top coat is 
present without an undercoat. Dogs with this kind of coat shed less than 
their double-coated counterparts.
You can tell what kind of coat your dog has in two ways. The first is easy: 
Read the American Kennel Club (AKC) breed standard for your breed and 
look under the Coat listing (www.akc.org). The second way is to part the 
hairs on your dog’s coat to find out whether it’s a longer, harsh coat 
combined with soft, downy fur. If so, your dog has a double coat. If the hair is 
mostly even without an undercoat, your dog has a single coat.
However, both types of coats have different issues when it comes to grooming, 
so be aware that one type isn’t necessarily better than another. Knowing coat 
type helps you determine how to groom your dog properly. Knowing whether 
she will go through a seasonal shed or blow her coat, can avoid surprises 
when she leaves enough hair on the rug to knit three more dogs her size.
Two types of double coats exist. One is called a natural coat — that is, a coat 
with two layers. The second is found on longer-haired breeds that have two-ply 
coats that obviously need more attention.

Coat textures
Different coats have different textures. Understanding the texture of your 
dog’s coat is crucial for proper grooming. Consider these different textures:
 
 Smooth coats: The smooth-coated or short-coated dog has very short 
hair that lays back against the dog’s skin. A smooth coat can be either 
double-coated or single-coated, depending on the breed. These coats 
Defining coat terms
Many funny-sounding words are associated 
with dog coats. They’re worth mentioning 
because you may come across them when 
working on a particular breed or reading a 
particular breed standard (see Book V). Peruse 
these various coat textures and what they 
mean:
  Blow coat: The yearly or biannual shedding 
that some dog breeds go through. The coat 
comes out in handfuls during a short period 
of time.
  Bristle coat: A wiry or broken coat, or a 
bristly coat, such as the one worn by the 
Chinese Shar-Pei.
  Broken coat: See wire coat.
  Corded coat: A coat that has dreadlocks.
  Crinkly coat: A wire coat found on the Wire 
(Haired) Fox Terrier.
  Curly coat: A coat with curls, like that of the 
Poodle or the Curly-Coated Retriever.
  Double coat: A coat with an undercoat and 
a top coat.
  Guard hairs: See top coat.
  Linty coat: A coat that has an unusual 
soft, downy texture. (Also what your light-
colored dog gets when you carry her 
around while you’re wearing black 
cashmere.)
  Open coat: A sparsely haired coat; usually 
a single coat.
  Out of coat: A dog who has shed his under-
coat and is waiting for his new coat to 
grow in. Out-of-coat dogs usually are not 
as pretty as when they’re in full coat.
  Pily coat: A coat with a dense, harsh top 
coat with a soft, fur-like undercoat. Usually 
found in Dandie Dinmont Terriers.
  Single coat: A coat that lacks an undercoat.
  Smooth coat: A short coat that lays back 
against the dog’s skin.
  Stand-off coat: A long coat that does not 
lay flat against the body, but stands straight 
up. (Also the kind of coat your dog will have 
if you two can’t come to terms with 
grooming.)
  Top coat: The outer coat that protects the 
dog’s skin and undercoat. Usually harsh 
and weather resistant.
  Two-ply coat: See double coat.
  Undercoat: The downy second coat found 
beneath the top coat, usually shed once or 
twice a year.
  Wire coat: A type of harsh coat that may be 
single or double with stiff, wiry hairs.

312
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
tend not to be much of a hassle when it comes to grooming — even 
though they do shed. Dalmatians and Bulldogs have this kind of hair.
 
 Wire coats: The wire coat (broken coat) is wiry on the outside and often 
has a soft undercoat on the inside, but it can be a single coat. Wire coats 
are wavy looking, but the hair feels a bit coarse. Think Terrier. Wire 
coats usually need to be stripped or clipped (removed or cut), adding an 
extra step to the average grooming routine.
 
 Curly coats: Curly coats are few in number, but you’ll recognize them. 
They’re the Poodles, the Portuguese Water Dogs, and the Irish Water 
Spaniels. These curly dogs require extreme maintenance, including 
clipping and brushing (see Chapter 4 in Book III).
 
 Corded coats: Dogs with “dreadlocks” need a fair amount of work 
upfront to prevent the hair from tangling into mats. After the cords are 
twisted, keeping them well maintained takes time. Dogs with corded 
coats include the Puli and the Komondor. Poodles can also be corded.
Coat length
Shorter coats generally are easier to groom than longer coats. Check out the 
other differences in the list that follows:
 
 Hairless dogs: On one end of the spectrum are the hairless or near-
hairless dogs. They are lacking when it comes to hair, although some 
breeds, like the Chinese Crested, actually have some hair on the head or 
legs (and the Powderpuff variety is a hairy dog). But just because they’re 
hairless doesn’t mean that you don’t groom them. Although you may not 
be brushing their hair, their skin requires plenty of attention.
 
 Short coats: Dogs with short coats are pretty much the wash-and-wear 
dogs. Their coats don’t offer much protection against the elements, 
so they’re more likely to have problems with cold climates than their 
furrier counterparts. They may be single- or double-coated. Examples 
include the Basenji and the Beagle.
 
 Medium coats: A medium coat is not so short that the hair doesn’t give 
the dog protection, and not so long that the hair tangles or mats terribly. 
Medium-coated dogs usually are double-coated with a top coat and an 
undercoat, but unlike long-haired dogs, they’re usually fairly easy to 
groom. Border Collies and Cardigan Welsh Corgis have medium coats.
 
 Long coats: Dogs with long coats often are the showstoppers of the dog 
world, attracting oohs and ahhs wherever they go. But all that beauty 
has a price. Long-coated dogs often are single-coated and prone to mats 
and tangles if the hair isn’t kept up. If your dog has a long coat, you can 
expect long grooming sessions or trips to the grooming parlor. Afghan 
Hounds and Irish Setters have long coats.

Coat color
Dogs come in a variety of colors — everything from black to white and all 
shades in between, or so it seems. And their colors come in many different 
patterns, including bi-color, tri-color, and brindle (mottled with brown and 
black — often looking like stripes). Colors and color combinations depend a 
great deal on the breed and whether they are acceptable in the breed standard.
Some shampoos and conditioners help bring out the best in your dog’s coat. 
When buying supplies, look for ones that make your white dog sparkling 
white, your black dog glossy black, or your brown dog look his very best.
Having the Proper Tools on Hand
Different coats require different grooming methods, and different grooming 
methods require different equipment and supplies. Analyzing your dog’s coat 
should give you some idea of what tools and supplies you need to properly 
groom her. For example, depending on your dog’s coat, you may be simply 
brushing and bathing, or you may be clipping or stripping it, too.
 
Good grooming requires more than brushing, bathing, and possibly clipping 
your dog. It also involves routinely trimming her toenails, brushing her teeth, 
cleaning her eyes and ears, and possibly expressing her anal sacs. Chapter 3 
in Book III covers these jobs.
Choosing a low- or high-maintenance pup
Grooming can be a piece of cake or a nightmare, 
depending on your patience and the breed of 
dog you’ve chosen. Although other factors are 
probably more important, grooming also should 
go into the decision-making process when 
choosing a dog.
Which dogs are low maintenance when it 
comes to coats? Think short and medium coats 
that don’t need clipping and don’t need a lot 
of brushing and detangling (but these dogs do 
shed). Consider this partial list of some dogs 
with low-maintenance coats:
(continued)
  Basenji
  Beagle
  Boston Terrier
  Dalmatian
  Doberman Pincher
  German Shorthaired Pointer
  Great Dane
  Labrador Retriever
  Pointer
  Rottweiler

Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
Knowing When to Call a Pro
You may be ready to invest your time and money in grooming your pooch, 
but in some situations you need to rely on the skills and advice of an expert. 
Your Bearded Collie may tangle with a sticker bush, and you may not have 
the time or patience to pick every last sticker out of his coat. Maybe your 
Great Dane is easy to bathe and brush but a gigantic pain when you’re 
trimming his nails and brushing his teeth. Perhaps you adopted a dog who’s 
never been groomed, and you need help getting his coat into shape so you 
can then maintain it.
If you’re an honest soul who has admitted to yourself that you have neither 
the time nor the inclination to do it right, there’s no shame in that. And why 
should there be? You call a plumber when your sink faucet is spraying water. 
You have a teacher teach your kids. You buy an airline ticket to fly across the 
country instead of going to flight school. You pay someone else to do plenty 
of tasks that you can’t or won’t do, so there’s nothing wrong with hiring a 
professional groomer for your dog.
 
Assigning children to groom the dog usually isn’t a reliable alternative to 
routinely grooming the dog yourself. No matter how much your kids promise 
to take care of the dog (including grooming), don’t believe them. This task 
ultimately falls on an adult in the household. Younger children are neither 
responsible enough to take care of a dog without adult supervision nor 
capable of tackling the grooming process.
(continued)
Why would anyone want a dog with a high-
maintenance coat? Well, as you’ve seen, they 
can be very beautiful. Owners and breeders 
like that certain look you don’t see with a short-
coated dog. The dog’s temperament figures in, 
too — many people like certain temperaments 
that come in a particular package. This list 
includes some dogs with high-maintenance 
coats:
  Afghan Hound
  American Cocker Spaniel
  Dandie Dinmont Terrier
  Keeshond
  Kerry Blue Terrier
  Poodle
  Portuguese Water Dog
  Puli
  Samoyed
  Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier

Grooming
Considering the cost
Most pet owners hesitate to look for a professional groomer because, quite 
frankly, it’s costly. Yet that’s all a matter of perspective. What’s your time 
worth? If you take three or four hours to groom your Standard Poodle, paying 
someone $45 to $65 to bathe, brush, and clip your dog may actually be a deal.
The cost of having a professional groom your dog varies widely depending on 
where you live and what you want done. Time- and skill-intensive procedures 
like stripping or clipping coats cost more than a simple bath and brushing. 
Problem coats (matting and tangles) also add to the cost.
Keep these points in mind when considering the cost of grooming:
 
 Most groomers charge between $35 and $70 for complete grooming.
 
 Some groomers charge more or less, depending on the breed, the 
location (New York City is more expensive than Great Falls, Montana), 
the size of the dog, and the type of work done.
 
 Dogs with matted or dirty fur cost more, and so do dogs who need a 
show trim.
 
 Groomers add from $8 to $12 for mats and add at least $40 for show 
cuts, over the average cost of grooming.
 
Most, but not all, groomers offer baths, brushing, clipping, stripping, ear 
cleaning, and nail cutting as part of their services. Ask what the full grooming 
price includes. Some groomers don’t quote a price until they see your dog 
and can gauge how much work grooming your dog will be.
Looking for a professional groomer
Now that you’ve decided to use a professional groomer, you can easily 
Google dog grooming with your city name included, or kick it old school in 
the Yellow Pages under the “Dog Groomers” section. But you may have a 
better method.
Finding a professional groomer
Finding a groomer is pretty easy. You’re likely to see a shop on the corner in 
your neighborhood, but you may not be sure whether that groomer is any 
good. Take these steps to find a good one:

316
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
 
1. Ask your dog-owning friends whether they use a groomer for their 
dogs or know of one they can recommend.
 
 A good recommendation is worth its weight in gold. If your dog-owning 
friends praise a particular groomer, go with that one.
 
2. Ask your veterinarian what groomer he recommends.
 
 Sometimes vets employ a groomer onsite.
 
3. Look for groomers near you online:
 
• Find a Groomer directory (www.findagroomer.com): This 
groomer directory is the pet owner’s side of PetGroomer.com 
(www.petgroomer.com). Groomers list themselves here. You can 
search by city and state or even by zip code.
 
• BreederWeb.com (breederweb.com/services/dogGroomers.
asp): This resource is another good one to use in your search for a 
groomer.
 
• DexOnline.com (dexonline.com): Use this Internet Yellow Pages 
site to do a search on dog grooming in your city and state.
Checking into Certifications
Certifications are a mixed bag. Plenty of good groomers who have well-
established businesses and do an exceptional job are not certified. A 
groomer who is neither certified nor professionally trained may have a good 
reputation and references that check out. If so, that groomer probably is a 
good bet.
 
A certified groomer is someone who is professionally trained and certified 
to a certain standard. You don’t know what level of expertise a groomer who 
hasn’t been certified has achieved. An uncertified groomer may be better or 
worse than someone who is certified. With certification, at least you know 
the standard to which the groomer should be able to perform.
Certifications are offered through certain grooming schools and through the 
National Dog Groomer’s Association of America (NDGAA). You can find out 
more about NDGAA certification at www.nationaldoggroomers.com.
Screening a professional groomer
After you find a professional groomer you’re interested in using, you need 
to determine whether that groomer is the right one for your dog. Not all 
groomers are comfortable with all dogs; some groomers prefer to work only 
with certain breeds.

317
 Chapter 1: What Good Grooming Is All About
Book III
Cleanliness 
Is Next to 
Dogliness: 
Grooming
 
Some groomers may use tranquilizers, especially with difficult-to-handle or 
aggressive dogs. If you don’t know whether a groomer uses tranquilizers, 
ask. Some dogs can experience seizures when administered certain common 
tranquilizers. Tranquilizers also make dogs more susceptible to problems 
caused by changes in temperature, such as hypothermia and heatstroke.
Knowing the right questions to ask
Let your fingers do the walking here. You can prescreen most professional 
groomers over the phone to find out whether they’re right for you and your 
dog. Ask these questions:
 
 What hours are you open for business?
 
 Are you available for emergencies or after hours?
 
 How long have you been in business?
 
 What are your certifications? With what organization?
 
 How many clients do you see?
 
 What breeds do you see most of?
 
 How many of my breed do you see?
 
 Are you comfortable working on my breed?
 
 How much do you charge for a full grooming? What procedures does a 
full grooming include?
 
 How do you handle difficult dogs? Do you muzzle or tranquilize them?
 
 Do you use cage dryers? If so, how often do you check on dogs with cage 
dryers?
 
 What do you charge for just a bath and brushing? Nail clipping?
 
 How many staff members do you employ?
 
 What other services do you offer?
 
 Do you have an emergency on-call vet? Who is it?
 
 Do you have references?
Visiting a professional groomer
After you prescreen the professional groomer on the phone, it’s time for a 
visit. Ask whether you can drop by and check out the groomer’s facility some 
time. The grooming shop should be neat, clean, and organized. If the shop 
is especially busy, you may find hair and water on the floor, but overall the 
shop needs to leave you with a good impression.

318
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
Watch how the groomer and staff members handle dogs. Are they gentle and 
caring, or do they move the dogs around like commodities? Watch body 
language; you generally can tell whether the groomer is just going through 
the motions or sincerely likes what she is doing. Although everyone is 
entitled to a bad day, the groomer shouldn’t take out any frustrations on 
the dogs.
When you’re convinced that a particular groomer is the one for your dog, 
make an appointment. You may need one or two sessions to really decide 
whether the groomer is a good fit.
 
A dirty or terribly chaotic and disorganized grooming shop may be a sign 
that the groomer doesn’t have enough staff and may not have time to care 
for and watch all the dogs, especially the ones in cage dryers (combination 
kennels/dryers). When that’s the case, you may want to look for another 
groomer. For the lowdown on the basics of doing your own grooming, continue 
on to the other chapters in this Book. For the whole story on grooming, 
check out Dog Grooming For Dummies by Margaret H. Bonham (Wiley).

ood grooming is a part of caring for your dog, but most of what you do 
is maintenance work — that is, just keeping your dog clean and healthy. 
If you start with a clean dog and maintain a clean and healthy coat, you prevent 
headaches and disasters later.
This chapter covers the proper techniques for brushing, combing, bathing, 
and drying your dog. You can find out about other grooming basics, like 
clipping your dog’s toenails and cleaning his ears and teeth, in Chapter 3 of 
Book III.
Do-It-Yourself Canine Hair Styling
Brushing and combing form the foundation of good grooming. Most dogs 
don’t actually need baths all that frequently. They usually need them only 
when they get noticeably dirty or have to go to a show. However, they 
must be brushed and combed often — usually twice weekly or more often, 
depending on the breed and coat. Brushing and combing are great for your 
dog’s skin and coat because they distribute oils from the skin throughout 
the coat and get rid of bits of dirt, tangles, and loose hair. This aspect of 
grooming is the one thing you really need to do, even if you hire a groomer.
 
Always brush and comb a dog before you bathe her. Doing so helps prevent 
tangles and keeps your dog cleaner (bathing is covered later in this chapter).

320
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
Beyond pulling hairs: Making 
the experience pleasant
Brushing and combing can be enjoyable or a total nightmare. Usually, dogs 
who hate to be brushed and combed are the ones with long hair or thick 
coats that tend to mat easily. Owners often don’t tackle the thick coat early 
or often enough, and these sessions wind up being much more painful than 
they have to be. Brushing and combing don’t have to become a hair-pulling 
event.
 
A few tricks can make brushing and combing easier for you and your dog:
 
 Start young. When your dog is a puppy, get her used to brushing. In 
many cases, dogs love the attention. However, even if you do start early, 
some dogs never quite take to grooming. In many instances, you may 
have to work through some bad behaviors, and in other rare cases, you 
may even need to muzzle or sedate the dog.
 
 Stick to a routine. Where on your dog you first start brushing, combing, 
and grooming doesn’t matter, but being consistent does. By following 
the same routine every time you groom your dog, you won’t forget to do 
anything, and your dog won’t have any surprises.
 
 Relax with your dog. Taking time to relax — both dog and owner — 
goes a long way toward calming your dog’s fears. Your dog may get 
nervous when she senses it’s grooming time, regardless of whether 
you’re breaking out a grooming table (highly recommended — find them 
online or at pet stores) or simply reaching for a brush and comb. Giving 
her treats, administering a good massage (see the “Massaging your dog” 
sidebar for advice), or just talking to her in a soothing tone helps relieve 
your dog’s tension before and during a brushing session.
 
 If you use a grooming table to groom your dog, never leave her on it 
unattended. She can hurt herself jumping off or even strangle herself if 
she’s hooked into a noose.
 
 Brush your dog after she’s exercised — when she’s a little bit tired. 
She’ll be calmer.
 
 Never hurry and always be gentle whenever possible. One bad 
experience can be traumatic and turn your dog off grooming entirely.
 
 Use the right tools. The right tools make the job not only easier, but less 
stressful and less painful. If you use the wrong tools, you’re more likely 
to pull on your dog’s hairs (tools are covered in the next section).

321

Grooming
Gathering the tools you need
Before you get started brushing or combing your dog, gather all the tools 
you need for the session. Having everything you need in one place and within 
reach makes the brushing and combing session go much more smoothly; it 
can make all the difference between an experience that’s pleasant and one 
that’s not.
 
If you live in a flea-prone area, make sure that you have a flea comb handy, 
especially during flea season (which begins in spring). Flea combs, along with 
all kinds of rakes, brushes, combs, and clippers, are available at all good pet 
stores.
Tools for long coats
If your dog has a long coat, you need the following tools:
 
 An undercoat rake or long comb: To remove the loose undercoat hairs.
 
 Some groomers prefer using wide-toothed combs first and then changing 
to progressively narrower or finer-toothed ones. This strategy is good 
whenever your dog has really snarly hair. However, if you’re simply 
maintaining your dog’s coat, you can choose to go over him with a 
fine-or medium-toothed comb and then a slicker brush.
 
 Detangler solution and a mat splitter or mat rake: For tangles and mats 
(use electric clippers in extreme cases).
 
 Shedding tool: For removing the soft undercoat when the dog is blowing 
coat (shedding profusely).
 
 Slicker brush: For removing hair and stimulating the skin and coat.
Massaging your dog
Massaging your dog may sound a little odd, but 
it’s a great way to bond with him. If your dog 
has never been massaged, he may find it a little 
strange at first. The first goal when massaging 
your dog is to get him to relax. Start with gentle 
stroking movements in areas where he’s 
normally accustomed to being petted. Don’t 
touch areas that your dog isn’t quite comfortable 
with you touching, and don’t use a lot of 
pressure until your dog gets used to it. Pick up 
a copy of How to Massage Your Dog, by Jane 
Buckle (Wiley), or Dog Massage, by Maryjean 
Ballner (St. Martin’s Press), for the basics of 
massaging your dog.

322
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
Tools for short coats
If your dog has a shorter coat, you need these grooming tools:
 
 A Zoom Groom or short curry brush: For removing hair and polishing 
the coat
 
 A short-toothed comb: For removing hair and getting through any tangles
 
 Slicker brush: For removing hair and stimulating the skin and coat
Brushing up on basic techniques
You can work from tail to head or vice versa. Just start at one end and work 
your way to the other — and don’t miss anything in between.
Various methods of brushing include line brushing and combing — that is, 
parting the fur and combing and brushing out each section (which works well 
on long coats) — and spiral brushing, in which the dog’s hair is brushed and 
combed in a circular pattern. Spiral brushing works well on any coat.
 
Regardless of the method of brushing and combing you use, you need to 
brush all the hair, not just the top coat. That means getting down to the skin 
and brushing upward.
You can brush out your dog’s coat in a variety of ways. One common way 
is to brush backward against the lay of the fur and then brush it back into 
place (see Figure 2-1). Brushing that way usually loosens and removes hair 
and stimulates your dog’s skin. Some breeds have hair types that don’t go 
well with this method. Breeds with corded hair, in particular, just can’t be 
brushed backward, so make sure that you remove all the tangles as you go.
Dealing with the dreaded mat
Because brushing or combing out mats and tangles can cause any dog a great 
deal of discomfort, don’t keep pulling on them after you find them. Instead, 
follow these instructions to gently remove tangles and mats:
 
1. Spray the mat with detangler solution and use an appropriate comb to 
slowly work the hairs in the mat free.
 
 Work from the outside of the mat (where the hair isn’t tangled) and 
slowly untangle the hair. Hold the base of the mat (closest to your dog’s 
skin) as you work, to avoid pulling your dog’s skin.
 
2. If the mat doesn’t come out with the comb, try using a mat rake next.
 
 Mat rakes are equipped with sharp teeth that work at cutting through 
the mat. You use the mat rake the same way you do a comb, but you 
simply rake along the lay of the hair. The teeth will cut through the mat.

skin.
 
 
3. If the mat rake doesn’t cut it (so to speak), try using a mat splitter — 
but don’t put away the rake just yet.
 
 Start by splitting the mat of hair in horizontal or vertical strips and 
then using either a mat rake or a comb to tackle those smaller pieces 
individually. Watch to make sure that no skin is pulled up into the mat.
 
 Be careful when using mat rakes or mat splitters. They’re quite sharp 
and can cause cuts if used improperly.
 
4. In the worst conditions (that means the rake and the splitter have 
failed), use electric clippers (any blade should work) to slowly shave 
away the mat.
 
 Be aware that this step should be considered as a last resort and that 
it can leave a bare patch that will ruin a show coat until it can grow out 
again. You can also ask a professional groomer or veterinarian to help 
you get rid of the mat.
 
Whatever you do, don’t use scissors to cut out a mat! No matter how careful 
you think you are, accidentally cutting your dog’s skin is all too easy, and 
that means a trip to the emergency vet for a suture.
Heading down the right grooming path
If your dog’s coat or the hair on her face is short, use a soft slicker that’s 
made specifically for the face — and even then, brush gently. The skin and 
hair around a dog’s face are particularly sensitive. Also be especially careful 
when working around a dog’s eyes with a dog comb or brush.

324
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
On the other hand, if your dog has long hair on the face, such as the fall (hair 
over the eyes) or beard found in breeds such as the Old English Sheepdog or 
Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier, lift the hair by putting your fingers behind the 
long hair and gently comb it out. You need to place your fingers behind these 
long facial hairs to protect your dog’s sensitive skin and face from the comb.
 
If you find mats or tangles around your dog’s face, don’t spray them with 
detangler solution, because you risk getting some in your dog’s eyes. Instead, 
dip a washcloth into the detangler solution, gently rub it into the hair, and 
then gently comb out the tangle, starting from the bottom of the hair. If the 
mat is really stubborn, use an electric clipper with a guarded blade to clip 
out the mat while also guarding your dog’s face and skin (and keeping her 
reassured and still) with your other hand.
If your dog has long hair on her ears, you can use a comb to hold the hair so 
that your hand is between the comb and your dog’s tender skin. If the ear 
fur is matted or in knots, use the washcloth dipped in detangler solution to 
slowly try to comb out the tangles. If the knots around the ear fur are too big 
(many dogs get them behind the ears), use electric clippers — sliding your 
hand between the skin and the clipper — to remove them. Or ask a professional 
to do it for you, to avoid cutting the skin.
 
If you don’t have grooming clippers, ask a vet or a professional groomer to 
remove the mat for you. Most are happy to do so at little or no charge.
Smoothing the ruffles on the nape of your dog’s neck
The ruff areas (the longer, thicker fur around the neck, shoulders, and chest) 
of your dog’s coat may also be sensitive, so start brushing them with a soft 
slicker. Brush backward against the lay of the hair (if appropriate — otherwise, 
brush with the grain). If your dog is shedding, the slicker brush may fill up 
quickly. You can use the comb to dislodge the hair from the slicker and 
deposit the hair in the trash. If your dog has a ruff, pay particular attention to 
it; you need to use a comb or undercoat rake whenever your dog has a long 
or thick double coat in those areas. Comb through the hair you just brushed 
before brushing it back the way it should lay.
Brushing and trimming feathered forelegs
Short hair on a dog’s forelegs usually doesn’t need to be brushed, but if your 
dog has feathering — that is, long hair on the backs of the legs that runs from 
armpit to paw — you have to comb it out. Feathering, like the hair behind the 
ears, has a tendency to tangle more than the rest of your dog’s coat, so use a 
detangler solution whenever the feathering on your dog’s legs is tangled and 
comb it out carefully, or use a mat splitter or mat comb.

 Chapter 2: The Basics of Brushing and Bathing
Book III
Cleanliness 
Is Next to 
Dogliness: 
Grooming
If your dog isn’t a show dog but nevertheless has feathering that’s either 
too matted or too much of a pain to brush out all the time, consider using a 
guarded clipper to remove the feathering on each side, for a cleaner look. Be 
sure to keep your fingers between the clippers and your dog to protect his 
skin, trimming the hair so that it looks neat.
Belly-rubbin’ for laughs
The next step is to brush out your dog’s chest and belly. Use a slicker to 
brush against the lay of the hair (if appropriate — otherwise, brush with 
the grain), remaining keenly aware that your dog’s underside is sensitive, 
especially around the belly and private parts. If you can get your dog to lie 
down on one side, do so. Be gentle while brushing near your dog’s privates.
 
Don’t pull on any mats on your dog’s sensitive underbelly, and don’t use a 
mat rake, because one slip can cause problems in these sensitive regions. If 
you find any mats, take your dog to your vet or a professional groomer, who 
can use electric clippers to carefully remove them.
Sidewinding and backing up
Your dog’s sides and top are probably the easiest areas to brush and 
comb. Take the slicker and brush backward against the lay of the fur (if 
appropriate — otherwise, brush with the grain), and follow up with a comb. 
Use detangler and mat splitters as required for removing any mats.
No butts about it
As with the belly and underside, your dog’s rear end can be particularly 
sensitive, but it’s also often the first area where a dog may shed. Use a slicker 
brush first to find out how tolerant of being touched your dog is, especially 
along the back legs, where the fur may be feathered or in pantaloons, tufts 
of hair that make your dog look like she’s wearing bloomers. Brush the fur 
against the lay (if appropriate — otherwise, brush with the grain) and then 
follow up with a comb. Use detangler solution and a mat rake if you run into 
any mats, but be extremely careful around the base of the tail near the anus 
and around the dog’s, um, equipment.
Handling those hind legs
Like the forelegs, your dog’s hind legs shouldn’t require much brushing, but 
if your dog has feathering, you have to comb it out. Feathering, like the hair 
behind the ears, tends to tangle a lot, so use a detangler solution if needed 
and comb out the feathering carefully or use a mat splitter or mat comb.
If your dog isn’t a show dog and has feathering down his back legs, you can 
trim it just like you trim the front legs. Removing the feathering makes your 
grooming job easier. Don’t forget to use an electric clipper with a guarded 
blade, and carefully trim the feathering back so that it’s nice and neat.

326
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
Tweaking that dratted tail
Depending on what your dog’s tail is like — smooth and sleek, furry, or like 
a plume — you may need to carefully comb it out. If it’s short, fuggetaboutit! 
Otherwise, if it’s long and furry, you need to use a comb. If you find mats in 
your dog’s tail, use detangler solution and a mat splitter or mat rake.
Shedding time
Some double-coated breeds shed profusely 
once or twice a year. Others shed year-round. 
If your dog has little tufts of hair that look like 
pieces of cotton candy scattered throughout 
his coat, he’s blowing coat, or shedding. You 
can pluck out these tufts of hair, but most dogs 
find that annoying. A better solution is to use a 
shedding blade or an undercoat rake.
The shedding blade looks like something you’d 
use on a horse. It’s a flexible piece of steel with 
little sawlike teeth that catch the hairs. You can 
operate the blade in a one-handed U-shape 
configuration, or you can keep the blade 
straight and use two hands. The undercoat rake 
is a rake with either long sets of teeth to pull out 
the hair out or a dual set of teeth that work both 
the undercoat and top coat.
Shedding blades need to be used carefully 
on thin-coated dogs because the blades 
can scratch the skin. However, if you own a 
thick-coated dog, you’re not likely to have this 
problem.
Getting pesky fleas to flee!
During flea season, which varies from one 
region to the next, you’ll be using a flea comb 
in addition to the other grooming implements. 
After brushing, go over your dog again with a 
flea comb.
Talk with your veterinarian about putting your 
dog on a systemic flea-control product that’s 
distributed throughout your dog’s system 
either in topical (spot-on) form or pill form. The 
topical products are usually applied between 
your dog’s shoulder blades and at the base of 
her tail; you feed products in pill form to your 
dog. These systemics have rendered other 
flea-control substances virtually obsolete, 
except when a dog exhibits undesirable 
side effects from using systemics. Ask your 
veterinarian what’s right for your dog.
When using any systemic, read the directions 
thoroughly and follow them carefully. 
Otherwise, the product may be ineffective. 
For example, some topical systemics can be 
ineffective if your dog gets wet shortly after you 
apply them. Use common sense, and if you’re 
not sure, ask your vet. Also, dosages and the 
amount of time the systemic is effective vary, 
so always have a clear understanding of the 
product you’re using. These flea products often 
control ticks, too. Talk to your vet for other 
possible tick-control solutions as needed.

Rub-a-Dub-Dub: Washing Your Dog
One of the old wives’ tales about grooming dogs is that you shouldn’t bathe 
your dog unless she’s really dirty or stinky. The story goes that if you do, 
you’ll remove essential oils and dry out her coat. This story is so prevalent 
among dog people that it’s repeated as a mantra by folks who should know 
better, namely breeders and dog experts.
At one time, dog shampoo really was harsh stuff that could strip a dog’s coat, 
leaving it feeling pretty icky. However, today dogs enjoy some pretty decent 
shampoos, conditioners, cream rinses, mousses, gels, detanglers, and just 
about any other hair-care products that humans enjoy, only formulated for 
dogs. You’re not hurting your dog’s coat by bathing her.
Bathing, like brushing, doesn’t have to be a pain, but it tends to be a pretty 
traumatic experience for many dogs. Most dogs try to avoid a bath when 
they’ve had bad experiences with it. Again, patience is the key.
Making bath time a pleasant experience
Because most dogs hate baths, getting your dog to a point where he actually 
likes them can be rough. A few tricks can help you smooth over those rough 
spots when bathing your dog:
 
 Start young. Get your dog used to bathing as a pup. Experience is key to 
preventing bad bath-time behavior. In many instances, you may have to 
work through the bad behavior. In fact, as with grooming, in some rare 
cases you may have to muzzle or sedate the dog.
 
 Use the right tub, and give your dog easy access. If you’re using your 
bathtub, putting your dog in it may be as easy as walking him in. With a 
groomer’s tub, you may have to use a ramp or stairs to walk a big dog 
into it, especially if you have a bad back (or a good back and you don’t 
want to have a bad back). Use the sink only for small or toy-size dogs. 
Don’t use the shower for any dog. And although you may be tempted to 
use an outdoor hose for bathing, don’t. It isn’t ideal because the water 
is usually too cold, and the dog will get dirty all over again from being 
outside.
 
 Keep your dog in place in the tub. Most dogs don’t like to stay still in 
the tub, so you may want to use a special tub or bathing “noose” (available 
at pet stores — a poor name for a useful tool) that attaches to the tub to 
keep him in place. Never leave a dog alone restrained by a noose.

328
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
 
 Don’t hurry, and be gentle whenever possible. One bad experience can 
be traumatic.
 
 Make bathing as comfortable as possible. To prevent a painful experience, 
gently put some cotton balls in your dog’s ears — don’t shove them into 
the aural canal at the base of the ear, mind you. The cotton balls help 
keep water out of your dog’s inner ears.
Gathering the tools you need
Before you start to bathe your dog, gather all the tools you need. Having 
everything in one place makes the bathing process much smoother and 
means all the difference between a pleasant and an unpleasant experience.
When bathing your dog, you need the following supplies:
 
 pH-balanced shampoo for dogs (and possibly a pH-balanced conditioner)
 
 Cotton balls for ears
 
 Bathing noose (if required)
 
 Washcloth
 
 Blow-dryer
 
 Towels for drying
 
You may want to look into a tearless variety of shampoo if you’re not used to 
bathing dogs. Read the labels to find a tearless shampoo.
Scrubbing bubbles: Bathing your dog
Thoroughly brush and comb your dog’s coat before bathing her. If you don’t 
brush out dogs before you bathe them, most dogs end up with nasty tangles 
and mats from those scrubbing bubbles. The same is true for a dog who’s 
shedding heavily. Although warm water loosens the hair, clumps of shedded 
hair tend to mat and later make for a grooming nightmare.
Some dogs’ coats require a pre-bath clipping. After thoroughly brushing out 
your dog and getting rid of all the tangles, you may need to use the clippers 
to lop off frizzy or flyaway split ends so they don’t become a tangled nuisance 
during the wash. You can find out more about taking just a little off the top 
with the clippers in Chapter 4 in Book III.
The following steps explain the basics of bathing. Before you begin, you may 
want to place sterile cotton balls inside your dog’s ears to keep water out 
while bathing. Just don’t forget to take them out when you’re done.

329
 Chapter 2: The Basics of Brushing and Bathing
Book III
Cleanliness 
Is Next to 
Dogliness: 
Grooming
 
1. To start, place your dog in a tub that’s an appropriate size for your 
breed of dog.
 
2. Thoroughly wet down your dog’s hair with lukewarm water; use a 
washcloth to gently wet your dog’s face.
 
 You may like a hot shower, but that temperature is too high for your 
pooch. Also, some bathtubs nowadays come equipped with sprayer 
attachments that enable you to focus the flow of water. They’re great for 
soaking your dog’s coat and for being gentle around the face.
 
 While your dog is wet but before you apply shampoo is a great time to 
express your dog’s anal sacs, if you were planning to do it as part of 
your grooming routine (see Chapter 3 in Book III — if you dare).
 
3. Lather up your dog’s coat with a good pH-balanced dog shampoo, 
except around the face and sensitive eyes — which you must do 
separately with a wet cloth (see Chapter 3 in Book III).
 
4. Rinse thoroughly, sliding your fingers along your dog’s skin so that 
you get out all that soap.
 
 Soap attracts dirt, and a dog with dried soap in her hair is prone to 
those dreaded mats.
 
5. Apply a good pH-balanced conditioner or cream rinse for dogs.
 
 Using a conditioner that prevents tangles and also keeps the coat from 
drying out is a good idea for most coat types.
 
6. Thoroughly rinse away the conditioner.
 
 With regard to attracting dirt and causing mats, conditioner residues are 
as bad for your dog’s hair as soap residue, so rinse even better than you 
did in Step 4.
 
7. Get out those towels and start drying.
 
 As you squeeze the towels into the coat, look for soapy water. If you 
find any, go back to rinsing. The next section provides additional advice 
about drying your dog.
Drying
After you’ve thoroughly rinsed your dog, dry his coat as thoroughly as possible, 
first using towels. Blot the coat. Meanwhile, your dog will shake off all that 
excess water and then shake some more. After toweling off and allowing for a 
few shakes, you can move him onto the grooming table, if you have one, for a 
blow-dry and style.
Some professional groomers like to use cage dryers, devices that attach to 
the outside of a cage or crate and force warm air inside to dry your dog. Cage 
dryers can be efficient, but watch your dog carefully when using them. A dog 
can quickly overheat in a warm area he can’t escape.

330
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
 
Whenever you use a cage dryer, never leave a dog unattended in it. Dogs 
have overheated and died because the groomers forgot to watch them. 
Unless you’re planning to open a grooming shop (or you care for several 
dogs), skip the cage dryer and work with the hand-held blow-dryers only.
 
When using a blow-dryer, make sure you use one that’s made specifically for 
dogs (see Figure 2-2) or one that doesn’t use any heat. Hot air from human 
blow-dryers is much too hot and can hurt your dog’s skin and frazzle the fur. 
You can use a human hair dryer on the no-heat setting to dry small dogs, but 
blow-dryers intended for humans don’t have enough power to handle drying 
a larger, long-haired dog.
 
Figure 2-2: 
Use a blow-
dryer that 
has a no-
heat setting, 
like this one, 
made 
specifically 
for dogs.
 
Always thoroughly dry your dog before you let him outside.
When your dog is dry, you need to brush him again. At this time, you can use 
mousse or other leave-in coat conditioners if you’re getting him ready for a 
show.

A
fter you discover the basics of dog grooming — brushing, combing, and 
bathing — you have to tackle some tougher jobs, like brushing your 
dog’s teeth, cleaning his ears and face, trimming his toenails, and, yes, some 
less glamorous and even gross tasks. Don’t panic! All dogs need these essential 
grooming tasks done regularly. This chapter tells you how you can do them 
without too much of a struggle.
The Art of the Paw-dicure
Many dogs’ toenails have a habit of rapidly growing long. Unless your dog 
runs around on pavement or asphalt that help keep toenails short, you have 
to trim them. But clipping a canine’s claws is delicate work and can be an 
agonizing chore, especially if your dog has had a bad experience with the nail 
clippers.

332
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
Making toenail trimming 
a pleasant experience
Despite your best intentions and skill level, your dog may never be comfortable 
having her nails trimmed. Dogs are usually sensitive about their nails. 
Knowing that you have a few options helps. If you can’t do all your dog’s 
nails at once, you can clip them in stages, one paw at a time. The trick is to 
be diligent so that you’re trimming your dog’s nails before they’re overgrown. 
And be sure to read this whole section before you do anything.
 
If all else fails, there’s no shame in having a professional groomer or veterinarian 
trim them.
Some tricks you can try when trimming your dog’s toenails include the 
following:
 
 Get your dog used to your handling her feet. This tip is of utmost 
importance. Most dogs simply detest having their feet handled, so the 
sooner you get your dog used to enduring it, the better (and easier) 
giving your dog a weekly manicure can be.
 
 Ask for help getting started. If your dog’s nails are too long the first 
time you think about trimming them yourself, ask your veterinarian or 
a groomer to show you how to trim them to the right length. After that, 
you can trim them every week or so.
 
 Trim one paw at a time. This technique is a good one for fussy dogs. 
You can trim one paw at a time, giving your dog a rest before moving on 
to another paw.
 
 Provide a treat. Giving your dog a yummy treat after trimming her 
toenails also helps, and so do big hugs, a boisterous “Good dog!” and a 
vigorous scratch behind the ears.
 
 Try a nail grinder rather than clippers. Sometimes dogs who can’t 
tolerate nail trimmers can deal with a nail grinder. If you’re experiencing 
major problems clipping toenails, a nail grinder (which looks like a 
rotary tool) may work.
 
 Trim your dog’s nails once a week: Ideally, you need to trim your dog’s 
nails once a week. Weekly nail trimming not only helps keep them in 
good shape and prevents problems like broken nails, but it also gets 
your dog used to having a routine manicure.
 
If you hear your dog’s nails clicking as they touch a hard surface (floor or 
sidewalk), it’s time for a nail trim.

Gathering the tools you need
Before wielding any sharp instruments like nail clippers, make sure that 
you gather all the tools you need for the toenail-trimming session. Having 
everything you need within reach can make the nail-trimming session go 
more smoothly, may ease the tension associated with it, and can make all the 
difference between a pleasant experience and one that isn’t so pleasant.
You need these tools to trim your dog’s toenails:
 
 Nail cutters for dogs: Use either the guillotine or scissors styles.
 
 Styptic powder or a nail-cauterizing tool: You need one of these 
products in case you cut the quick (blood supply in the nail) and cause 
bleeding. Find out more about this problem in the next section.
 
 A slightly damp washcloth: Use a washcloth to clean up any styptic 
powder or other messes you may make.
 
 A nail file or nail grinder: The file or grinder smoothes the rough edges 
of the nail.
 
 Cotton swabs: Use them to apply styptic powder.
 
 A batch of yummy treats: Rewarding your best bud for a toenail-trimming 
job well done helps ease your dog through the procedure.
Nailing trimming basics
A dog’s toenail is made up of the nail and the quick. The quick is the pink 
(when it’s visible) part of your dog’s toenails; it’s similar to the pink part 
of your own fingernails and toenails. The quick is pink because it provides 
blood supply to the nail. When trimming your dog’s nails, you must avoid 
cutting into the quick, because it bleeds quite a bit and is sensitive (see 
Figure 3-1).
 
If your dog has white nails, you’ll be able to see the quick. However, many 
dogs have black or dark-colored nails, and no matter what tricks you may 
have heard, seeing the quick in them is impossible. You have to snip very 
carefully and look closely at the nail. If the nail feels spongy while you’re 
trying to cut it, stop immediately! Always err on the side of caution.

334
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
 
Figure 3-1: 
Be sure to 
trim the nail 
below the 
quick. If in 
doubt, trim 
less.
 
 
If you cut the quick (often called quicking), you’ll have an unhappy dog and a 
bloody mess. The quick bleeds a great deal, so if you cut it, you need either 
a nail cauterizer or styptic powder to stop the bleeding. Pack the nail with 
the styptic powder or use the cauterizer on the nail. Quicking hurts a lot, and 
most dogs remember the experience long afterward.
To trim your dog’s nails, you must follow these steps:
 
1. Hold the foot steady.
 
 However, also hold your dog’s foot gently.
 
2. Snip off a small bit of the end of each toenail.
 
 Place a tiny bit of the nail in the nail clipper and snip.
 
 Most people prefer to have their dog lying down or sitting when they 
cut the toenails. Use whatever method is most comfortable for you and 
your dog.
If you use a nail grinder rather than clippers, the same general method 
applies. Hold your dog’s foot and grind a little off each nail.
The best time to trim nails is, of course, when they need it; however, some 
people like to do the trimming before a bath so that if they do quick the dog, 
they can wash off the blood.

Don’t forget the dewclaws — the dog’s useless “thumbs.” They’re located on 
the inside of the leg above the foot. Most dogs have dewclaws in the front; 
some also have them in the rear. Some dogs have dewclaws; others don’t. If 
your dog has them, pay special attention when trimming them. They tend to 
grow long because they don’t normally touch the ground. If you don’t cut 
them, they’ll eventually grow back into your dog’s foot, which is painful.
Do You Hear What I Hear?
All dogs have sensitive ears, and some can develop frequent ear problems. 
Others never seem to have any problems. Breeds that have a predilection for 
ear infections and injuries tend to be Sporting dogs and Hounds because of 
their dropped (hanging or drooping) ears. Dropped ears make an ideal place 
for bacteria to grow and mites to hide. Regardless of whether your dog has 
pricked-up or dropped ears, you have to keep them clean and sweet smelling. 
If an odor is present around your dog’s ears, they may be infected.
 
Dog owners (usually Poodle owners) often pluck the hair inside their dog’s 
ears. They use ear powder to dry the ear and yank out the hair. Ouch! Dogs 
don’t like this procedure. But if your dog has hair growing in his ears and has 
a lot of infections, you may have to do some plucking. Ask your vet.
Doing the dew
Some canine breed standards require 
dewclaws for animals that are intended for the 
show ring. For example, rear double dewclaws 
are the standard for Great Pyrenees. Other 
standards say that rear dewclaws need to 
be removed. Check the breed standard at 
www.akc.org.
Before removing dewclaws on a puppy you 
plan to show, check with the breed standard 
to find out whether removal is allowable. In 
working dogs, the breeder or vet needs to remove 
dewclaws when the puppy is 3 to 5 days old, 
to prevent injuries when dewclaws are torn. 
Removal of dewclaws any time after that 
requires surgery and anesthesia at the vet’s 
office.
If you plan to remove the dewclaws from a litter, 
have your vet show you how. If it’s not done 
right, you can end up with malformed dewclaws 
or worse — an injured or crippled puppy.

336
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
Making ear cleaning more pleasant
Dogs hate to have things stuck in their ears, so you’re not likely to make it an 
enjoyable experience. Nevertheless, you can try to make it as comfortable as 
possible by following these tips:
 
 Get your dog used to your gently handling his ears. Get him used to 
your touching his ears (a gentle ear scratch), holding his ears, flipping 
them up (if he has hanging or dropped ears), and looking in his ears.
 
 Clean your dog’s ears when he’s a bit tired. The less your dog fights 
with you, the less he’ll have his ears pulled.
 
 Clean your dog’s ears once a week. The longer you wait to perform 
a grooming task like this one, the longer it takes and the worse the 
experience is likely to be for the dog and for you.
 
 Give treats for behaving while you clean his ears. Give him a goody 
even if he’s good only long enough for you to touch his ears.
 
 Never pull on your dog’s ears or jab deep into them. It’s painful, and if 
you do it, your dog will never let you near his ears again.
Gathering the tools you need
Before you get started, gather all the tools you need for the ear-cleaning 
session. Doing so makes the ear-cleaning session go more smoothly. Having 
all your implements in one place makes all the difference between a pleasant 
experience and one that isn’t so pleasant.
You need these tools to clean your dog’s ears:
 
 Mild otic (ear-cleaning) solution for dogs: Don’t use anything with 
insecticides. Otic solution is available at groomers’ supply houses.
 
 Sterile gauze, cotton swabs, or sponges: Use these items to remove the 
otic solution or cleaner.
 
 Surgical forceps or clamps: No, you’re not doing surgery. You wrap the 
clamp or forceps with the gauze and then wipe the gauze inside the ears 
to clean out any dirt and otic solution.
Cleaning your dog’s ears
Cleaning your dog’s ears is fairly uncomplicated. Proceed slowly and be sure 
not to enter the ear canal.

337
 Chapter 3: Caring for Nails, Teeth, Nose, Ears, Eyes, Face, and....Elsewhere
Book III
Cleanliness 
Is Next to 
Dogliness: 
Grooming
Follow these steps when cleaning your pup’s ears:
 
1. Gently hold your dog’s head so that the open ear is exposed.
 
 Sitting down beside your dog usually works.
 
2. Squeeze some otic solution into the ear (follow the label directions).
 
 Gently massage the outside of the ear canal to help the solution do its 
work.
 
3. Using a sterile gauze pad or sponge, gently wipe out excess solution.
 
 You can wrap the gauze or sponge completely around the forceps or the 
clamp to wipe around the ear.
 
 Don’t use insecticides or mite treatments, because they can cause 
irritation. If you notice any red dirt, anything that looks like coffee 
grounds, or a waxy buildup and you suspect ear mites, see your vet.
 
4. While your dog’s ears are exposed, gently trim any excess hair from 
around the openings.
Recognizing an ear problem
Ear infections are sometimes hard to clear up. Doing so takes commitment 
and determination. Watch your dog for the following signs of potential ear 
problems that a veterinarian may need to address:
 
 Blisters or abrasions on the ears
 
 Crusty or red ears
 
 Excessive or red or black waxy buildup
 
 Foul-smelling odor coming from the ears
 
 Your dog scratching or pawing her ears or shaking her head
 
 A yelping reaction when you touch her ears
No Butts About It: Getting Expressive
Has your dog suddenly taken to using your nice, new Berber carpet as a roll 
of toilet paper? If so, you may be in for a real treat. You may have the distinct 
pleasure of helping your dog remove the fluid from his anal sacs. And you 
thought dog grooming wouldn’t be any fun!

338

Anal sacs, or a dog’s anal glands, are located around or on either side of the 
dog’s anus. These sacs carry some smelly fluid and occasionally need to be 
expressed, or emptied. Many dogs express them by themselves every time 
they poop, but occasionally these sacs fill with fluid, and your dog may need 
some help from you to release the fluid. Some dogs need their anal sacs 
expressed a lot; others don’t. Failing to care for anal sacs may lead to infection. 
Whether you express the anal sacs depends on what your dog is feeling.
You can tell when your dog needs to have his anal sacs expressed. How? 
When you see him sliding his backside across the carpet, or when he chews 
or licks at his rear end or tail, you know it’s time.
 
Ask your vet before attempting to express your dog’s anal sacs for the first 
time. In bizarre instances, you can rupture the sacs.
 
You may try expressing your dog’s anal sacs when you’re bathing him. That 
way you can wash away the smelly liquid and you don’t really care whether it 
misses the paper towel you’re using.
Gathering the tools you need
If you have a thumb and a forefinger, you have all the tools you need. If you 
have a weak constitution, you may also want to have the following on hand:
 
 Paper towels: Having plenty of paper towels for any type of cleanup 
always helps. You may even want to try a diaper wipe or other moistened 
cleansing wipe.
 
 A clothespin, heavy-duty rubber gloves, welder’s apron, rubber boots, 
and tongs: With these tools, you can glove up, cover up, and thus avoid 
the gag reflex the way Michael Keaton does while changing diapers in 
Mr. Mom.
Expressing yourself
Expressing anal sacs is relatively simple work (you may try and recruit 
someone to hold the dog’s head still):
 
1. Fold several paper towels together (about like the huge wad you 
normally need to take care of a spider or bug).
 
 Doing so provides an absorbent pad to catch the liquid.
 
2. Lift your dog’s tail and place the paper towels over her backside.
 
 Note the position of her anus in relation to the paper towels.

3. Press gently on the 4 o’clock and 8 o’clock positions in relation to her

If your dog shows discomfort back there and her sacs aren’t producing fluid,

intervention.
Care for Those Pearly Whites
Dogs don’t get cavities the way humans do, but they do get plaque, tartar, 
and gingivitis — all of which can cause foul breath and tooth problems. 
Trips to the doggie dentist are costly, and your dog will have to be put under 
anesthesia, because no dog ever “opens wide” for any dentist or vet.

340
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
 
Brushing your dog’s teeth obviously is important, but how often you do it 
depends on your dog and your motivation factor. Poor doggie dental care, 
however, can lead to dental infections that can travel to your pooch’s heart, 
causing major problems and even death. How’s that for motivation?
Making brushing doggie pleasant
Now that you’re working with the end of your dog that has teeth, you need to 
keep not only your dog’s dental health in mind, but also the safety of your 
fingers and hands. Working anywhere near your dog’s mouth puts you at 
risk of an occasional frustrated nip or two. Use these hints and steps to make 
brushing your dog’s teeth a little less tedious:
 
 Brush frequently. You should brush your dog’s teeth every day, but 
realistically, you’re better than most pet owners if you can brush them 
once or twice a week. Frequent brushing gets your dog used to the 
brushing routine and to the idea of having his mouth invaded.
 
 Choose the best time. A great time for brushing is right after your dog 
has exercised and is a little tired. At least, that time’s preferable to when 
he’s willing to fight with you over handling his mouth.
 
 Train your dog to allow you to touch his mouth. You can get him to 
tolerate having his mouth handled by doing so from an early age.
 
 Get him ready to have his teeth brushed in this way:
 
1. Flip up his lips (see upcoming Figure 3-3).
 
2. Wet the edge of a clean washcloth so you can rub your dog’s gums 
and teeth; hold a corner of the wet portion of the washcloth with 
your index finger and use a gentle, circular motion.
 
3. Talk to your dog in calm, soothing tones.
 
4. If your dog grows impatient, do Steps 1 through 3 for only a few 
seconds, and then stop and give him a treat.
 
5. Repeat Steps 1 through 4 again tomorrow, gradually lengthening 
the amount of time you spend doing them.
Eventually, you’ll be able to build up the amount of time your dog allows you 
to touch his mouth to where you’re giving your dog a nice tooth and gum 
massage without any fuss.
Gathering the tools you need
Before you get started, gather all the tools you need for the tooth-brushing 
session. Doing so makes the session go more smoothly. You need the following:

341
 Chapter 3: Caring for Nails, Teeth, Nose, Ears, Eyes, Face, and....Elsewhere
Book III
Cleanliness 
Is Next to 
Dogliness: 
Grooming
 
 Toothpaste for dogs: Don’t ever use human toothpaste! Human 
toothpaste contains fluoride, which in large quantities is poisonous to 
dogs. Dogs can’t rinse and spit, so they pretty much swallow everything 
you put on their teeth. Doggie toothpaste is flavored with malt, chicken, 
or some other yummy flavor that dogs can’t resist. It makes the experience 
more enjoyable. 
 
 Toothbrush for dogs: A finger toothbrush that’s made for pets is best. 
You can use a human toothbrush, but it isn’t as good as a finger brush.
Both items are available from your vet’s office, pet supply stores, and 
mail-order catalogs.
Brushing your dog’s teeth
When your dog is used to getting a gum massage with a wet washcloth, the 
next step is getting her used to the finger brush and pet toothpaste. You can 
start brushing your dog’s teeth by using a technique similar to the way you 
use the washcloth in the preceding section.
 
At the risk of repeating this information, never use human toothpaste on a 
dog. Okay now, follow these steps to properly brush your dog’s teeth:
 
1. Squeeze some doggie toothpaste onto the brush and allow your dog to 
lick it off.
 
 Most dogs like the flavor, but some don’t. Don’t worry about it one way 
or the other.
 
2. Flip up your dog’s lips and gently rub the toothbrush and toothpaste 
against your dog’s teeth and gums for a few seconds (see Figure 3-3).
 
3. Give your dog a treat, even if she allows you to work on her teeth for 
only a few seconds.
 
4. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 again tomorrow, gradually lengthening the 
amount of time spent brushing.
If you gradually increase the amount of time you spend working on this 
four-step process, you’ll eventually build up enough time to give your dog’s 
teeth a thorough brushing.
 
Some people like to purchase a dental scalar, a device they use to scrape 
away plaque from their dogs’ teeth. Unfortunately, if you’re not careful, you 
can injure your dog’s gums, not to mention make one unhappy pooch. That 
form of teeth cleaning is better left to your vet, especially when your dog has 
a lot of tartar and buildup and big teeth. And if your dog has loads of tartar 
buildup, get your dog to a vet first to have her teeth cleaned.

Spotting a dental problem
Watch your dog for these signs of potential tooth or gum problems that a vet-
erinarian needs to address:
 
 A lump above or below a particular tooth or under an eye
 
 Bad breath
 
 Broken teeth
 
 Loss of appetite
 
 Nasal discharge
 
 Red, swollen gums
 
 Sudden, unexpected chewing on inappropriate items
 
 A grayish or darkened tooth

Shiny, Bright Eyes
Dogs’ eyes are pretty much self-maintaining, but occasionally they run into 
problems with their eyes and the areas surrounding them.
 
Dogs have various eye shapes and sizes. Some dogs, especially breeds with 
brachycephalic (short, pushed-in) heads — Pugs and Pekingese — tend to 
have large, protruding eyes that are more susceptible to accidental injury. 
Other dogs have almond-shaped eyes. Alaskan Malamutes, Siberian Huskies, 
and still others have rounded eyes.
Regardless of type, red eyes, lacerated eyes, and eyes that tear excessively 
are not normal, and dogs with these conditions need to visit the veterinarian 
as soon as possible. Excessive tearing, for example, may be caused by ear 
infection, tonsillitis, or infected teeth.
Other ways of keeping your dog’s teeth clean
If your dog doesn’t handle brushing well, you 
can use one of several methods for keeping 
your dog’s teeth clean. Most of these methods 
have something to do with feeding him the right 
kind of food and giving him appropriate kinds of 
chews. You can use these items to clean those 
pearly whites:
  Dental toys intended to reduce plaque 
and tartar: Some of these toys actually 
are made so that doggie toothpaste can 
be squeezed into them, so they sometimes 
take the place of brushing. Busy Buddy, 
Kong toys, and Nylabone all have products 
intended to clean teeth.
  Certain premium dog foods: Some premium 
dog foods have additives that make their 
products more dental friendly by making 
them more abrasive. Hill’s and Iams each 
market a dental dog food, and so do many 
other brands.
  Tartar-control biscuits: Many pet food 
manufacturers sell tartar-control biscuits 
and snacks.
  Appropriate kinds of dog chews: Some 
chews, such as enzyme-treated rawhide 
chews and Greenies and Pedigree’s 
Dentabone, are made to help reduce 
plaque and tartar.
  Large bones: Giving your dog a big marrow 
bone or knucklebone from a cow helps 
clean canine teeth. Some vets recommend 
boiling for safety or freezing them raw to 
make them harder. Bones are controversial 
because they harbor bacteria and can 
cause blockages when chewed or 
swallowed. Never give a dog small sharp 
bones that can splinter. Some vets don’t 
recommend bones because they can break 
teeth.

Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
Making cleansing your dog’s eyes pleasant
 
A dog’s eyes are particularly sensitive, so you want to avoid bringing them 
into contact with soaps, chemicals, or anything that may cause irritation or 
abrasions. Unless directed by a vet, avoid using eye drops altogether. When 
you do use eye drops, make sure that they’re made specifically for a dog’s 
eyes.
When you clean around your dog’s eyes, you need to do so in the gentlest 
way possible. Because you have to be able to touch your dog around and 
close to his eyes, help your dog get used to it in these ways:
 
 Try cleaning the accumulated gunk from your dog’s eyes. Use a soft 
cloth or cotton ball moistened only with water. You’ll be cleaning off 
gunk deposits, or “sleep,” and other deposits that accumulate.
 
 Avoid directly touching your dog’s eyes. This should be obvious.
 
 Gently rub your pooch’s jowls and forehead, and give him a scratch 
or two behind the ears as you talk to him in a calm, gentle, and 
reassuring voice. Setting your dog at ease like this gives you better 
access for cleaning the areas around those sensitive orbs.
If you encounter excessive deposits of gunk, it’s time for a trip to the vet to 
make sure that nothing’s wrong. If your dog’s eyes are watering all the time, 
it’s another reason to visit the vet.
Don’t cry for me Argentina: 
Addressing tear stains
Tear stains show up as brown gunky stuff that runs from the tear duct down 
the muzzle. Although they’re unsightly, with some dogs, they’re natural, and 
you don’t have to do anything about them. Nonetheless, you can do plenty to 
get rid of them.
 
If your dog has tear stains, take her to a vet first to make sure she doesn’t 
have some other problem. Tear stains are natural for a few breeds.
Dogs prone to tear stains typically are white or have light-colored coats and 
usually are single-coated with long hair. Many dogs with brachycephalic 
heads (with protruding eyes) pick up more gunk. In fact, the problem has a 
name. Poodle eye, as the name suggests, is common among Poodles, but that 
doesn’t mean other dogs don’t have tear stains. You probably don’t notice it 
as much in other dogs because their fur is darker or seems to get rid of the 
gunk better.

Book III
Cleanliness 
Is Next to 
Dogliness: 
Grooming
In some breeds with serious congenital eye problems, the tear ducts can get 
clogged and require surgery. (See your vet if your dog shows any problems 
with her eyes or her tear ducts.)
Gathering the tools you need
A vet can help you get rid of tear stains — if that’s indeed what the problem 
is — with a course of tetracycline, which usually helps get rid of the staining 
but not the tears.
At home, you need these grooming products to help you get rid of tear stains:
 
 A soft cloth, makeup pad, or cotton ball: Use these materials, or others 
like them that don’t contain any soaps or chemicals, to apply grooming 
products to rid your dog of tear stains.
 
 A 10 percent solution of hydrogen peroxide with water, or other 
grooming products for getting rid of stains: These stain removers may 
or may not erase the total stain, depending on how bad it is. Always be 
extremely careful not to get any of these products in your dog’s eyes.
 
 Face cream, powder, cornstarch, or other coverup products: Yes, 
you have a choice of either getting rid of the tear-stained hair or 
covering it up.
 
 Electric clipper with an appropriate clipper guard or guarded blade: 
Use with extreme care if you choose to get rid of stained fur altogether.
As you may have already guessed, you can get rid of tear stains by either 
wiping them clean, covering them up, or clipping or plucking them off. You’ve 
probably also surmised that tear stains are the nemesis of show dogs and 
their owners.
You get rid of tear stains in this way:
 
 Wipe them off. If you choose to wipe off the tear stains, use the 10 percent 
solution of hydrogen peroxide or another stain-removal product for 
dogs. Gently swab the solution over the tear stain, but don’t get any of 
these products in your dog’s eyes. Make sure that you rinse the residues 
from your dog’s fur.
 
 Clip them off. If you decide to clip out the stain, do so very carefully 
with guarded clippers, or try plucking the stained fur. Note: Your dog 
must be extremely tolerant of clippers to remove tear-stained fur; 
otherwise, using the clippers can spell disaster.
 
 Never use scissors around your dog’s eyes or face for any reason.

346
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
 
 Cover them up. If you choose the face cream, powder, or cornstarch 
coverup route, you’ve chosen the safer but less permanent way:
 
• Cornstarch: Use it in a pinch, because it can whiten or lighten the 
stained area.
 
• Face cream/powder: Dampen the area and then use a small bit of 
cream or mousse to apply the powder. (Make sure that none gets 
in the eyes!) Then you can gently brush out the area. Some of the 
powder will stick, thus making your dog’s face more appealing.
 
 Technically, a show dog is never supposed to have chalk or powder left 
over. The truth is that some stays in, but the handler must get most of it 
out so that it doesn’t appear that the chalk is still there.
Eyeing other eye issues
Some breeds are prone to eyelid conditions, such as entropion (eyelids that 
roll in) and ectropion (eyelids that roll out), in which the eyelids are malformed. 
These conditions aren’t just cosmetic, and they can be quite painful. In most 
cases, surgery is needed to correct them. Other types of eye and eyelid 
problems include cherry eye, distichiasis, and conjunctivitis (pinkeye). 
Again, you can’t correct these conditions by yourself, so be sure to seek out 
the advice of your vet.
As your dog grows older, he may develop eyelid tumors (such as papillomas) 
or clouding of the eye (or crystal eye) caused by cataracts. If your dog has 
any of these conditions, a trip to the vet is in order.
Knowing when your dog 
has an eye problem
Eyes are one area of your dog’s grooming that you don’t want to ignore, 
especially if your dog has an eye problem. Take your dog to the vet if your 
dog is squinting or pawing an eye or if your dog’s eye looks like any of the 
following:
 
 Bulges or is out of its socket (a no-brainer!)
 
 Is red or tearing profusely or has a thick discharge
 
 Is lacerated or exhibits another apparent abnormality
 
 Appears opaque or cloudy
 
 Bleeds or shows other signs of injury
 
 Has foreign matter in it

Grooming
Face Time
Your dog’s face is the first thing you and other people see, so keeping her 
face clean and looking great makes sense, right? Some of the problems many 
dogs have in maintaining that glow usually have to do with wrinkles (if they 
have them) and beards (if they have them).
Making cleaning your dog’s face pleasant
Get your dog used to your touching his face. Unless your dog is really 
comfortable with looking you right in the eyes, avoid making direct eye 
contact, because doing so exhibits a challenging behavior. Move slowly and 
carefully around his face, which is extremely sensitive.
Gathering the tools you need
Before you get started, gather all the tools you need for the face-washing 
session. Having all your implements in one place makes the difference 
between a pleasant face-washing experience and one that isn’t so pleasant.
You need these items to wash your dog’s face:
 
 A damp washcloth
 
 A mild soap, dog shampoo (the tearless variety works well), or groomer’s 
blue shampoo (a great cleansing product that you don’t have to rinse out)
 
 Cotton swab
Facing off
When cleaning your dog’s face, use a damp washcloth (wet but not dripping) 
and some mild soap. If you use dog groomer’s blue soap (waterless shampoo), 
you don’t have to rinse it off. When using any kind of soap, your main 
objective is keeping it away from your dog’s eyes, because it can sting. Gently 
go over your dog’s face with the washcloth until it’s clean. Be sure to wash 
the flews, or the hanging skin around the mouth.
If your dog has wrinkles, the crevices can harbor bacteria and can become 
infected. Clean wrinkles carefully. If your dog is small, like a Pug, you can use 
a cotton swab dipped in blue soap to go over the wrinkles.

348
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
Long hair and beards need to be brushed out first. If your dog naturally has 
long hair over her eyes (called not bangs, but a fall), brush out the hair first 
and then use a ponytail-type band to bunch it and get it out of your dog’s 
face. Any stained hair that isn’t going to fall back in the eyes can be washed 
with soap and water. Trim any discolored hair unless it’s absolutely necessary 
for the show ring. If you can’t trim the hair, try the hydrogen peroxide 
solution mentioned in the “Getting rid of your dog’s tear stains” section 
earlier in this chapter, or try to cover it with chalk.

Chapter 4
To Clip or Not to Clip: Dog Haircuts
In This Chapter
 Knowing which dogs need to be clipped
 Choosing the right tools: Clippers, blades, and scissors
 Clipping your pooch
C
lipping a dog is one of the more daunting tasks for pet owners. If you 
have a dog who needs to be clipped or one who needs a touch-up, this 
chapter is for you.
Several breeds need to be clipped. Most have single coats, the kind without 
an undercoat. The hair of these dogs grows like yours, and because these 
pooches don’t shed, they’re bound to look like a terrible mess of hair if you 
don’t clip their coats. Other breeds are clipped for show or style reasons, or 
maybe just because the pet owner doesn’t want to deal with all that hair.
Don’t fear the electric clippers. You discover the basics of using them and 
what you can do with all those strange blades and plastic snap-on thingies 
in this chapter. You also discover how to safely handle scissors (also called 
shears in the grooming world), and even how to clip your dog yourself.
Deciding Whether to Clip Your Dog
Before going farther, you need to determine whether your dog actually needs 
to be clipped. Although many breeds need only a cursory neatening up, the 
following breeds generally need more serious clipping:
 
 American Cocker Spaniel
 
 American Water Spaniel
 
 Bedlington Terrier
 
 Bichon Frise
  Black Russian Terrier
  Bouvier de Flandres
  Brittany
  Cesky Terrier

350
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
 
 Cocker Spaniel (American 
and English)
 
 Curly-Coated Retriever
 
 English Setter
 
 English Springer Spaniel
 
 Field Spaniel
 
 Gordon Setter
 
 Irish Setter
  Irish Water Spaniel
  Kerry Blue Terrier
  Löwchen
  Poodle (all sizes)
  Portuguese Water Dog
  Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier
  Springer Spaniel
At first, you may be surprised that more breeds aren’t on this list, but that’s 
because some breeds aren’t exactly clipped breeds — they’re stripped breeds, 
or dogs who need excess hair stripped from their coats to attain the proper 
look. Most dog owners aren’t into time-consuming stripping procedures, 
though, so they opt for clippers. Nothing is wrong with using clippers in that 
manner, but you won’t get the right look for your breed if you intend to show 
your dog (see Chapter 6 in Book IV).
Getting Acquainted with Your Tools
You can find a dizzying array of electric clippers and blades sold on the 
grooming-tool market these days. Open up a grooming catalog, and you’ll see 
a bunch of different clippers, ranging from the basic home-use, pet-grooming 
clippers to the fancy-schmancy ones the pros use.
Deciding which clippers to buy
The kind of clippers you need depends on how much clipping you need to do 
with your dog. These three hints can help you choose wisely:
 
 If you’re using clippers just to neaten up Fido’s feet or clean up a stray 
hair here or there, you likely need only a set of inexpensive home 
clippers that won’t see a lot of use.
 
 If you want to maintain a nice show coat (or even a good pet coat) 
between trips to the groomer, you’re probably looking at medium-priced 
clippers and a variety of blades.
 
 If you want to trim and style your own dog and perhaps other dogs, 
you’re looking at professional-style clippers, maybe with more than 
one speed and certainly with several blades. Some of these clippers are 
cordless, so you don’t always need an outlet handy.

351
 Chapter 4: To Clip or Not to Clip: Dog Haircuts
Book III
Cleanliness

Dogliness: 
Grooming
Several different manufacturers make clippers, including Oster, Wahl, Andis, 
and Conair, among others. Oster is pretty much the leader when it comes to 
clippers, and its blades are universal enough that other manufacturers make 
their clippers so that Oster-style blades fit them. In fact, almost all clipper 
blades are made to fit Oster or similar products.
 
If you decide to purchase a brand of clippers other than an Oster, make sure 
that it’s equipped to use Oster-style blades. Most clippers are, but you need 
to be sure; otherwise, you’re stuck buying proprietary blades that may cost 
more. Besides, if your clippers breaks, you’ll be forced to choose between 
buying new clippers of a brand that matches the blades you already have or 
tossing everything and starting from scratch. Also, the quieter the clippers, 
the better.
Becoming a blade-runner
Most clippers come with blades, but some don’t. Blades are typically marked 
either by closeness of cut or by their Oster number (size 10, for example). 
The higher the number, the closer the cut. The lower the number, the more 
hair you’ll have on your dog after each clipping. So a size 40 blade (surgical 
cut) produces a much finer cut than a size 5 blade (1⁄4-inch cut).
Choosing your blades is a bit of an art form and depends on your dog’s breed 
and coat type. Look at your breed standard and talk to other owners of your 
breed. Table 4-1 describes various blades.
Most blades are full-toothed, but you can also find some skip-tooth blades. 
Skip-tooth blades are for stand-up coats (Poodle-type coats). Full-tooth blades 
are for smooth or drop-coated dogs (Spaniel-type coats).

Snapping on guide combs
Snap-on guide combs (shown in Figure 4-1, along with electric clippers, 
blade-lubricating oil, and a cleaning brush) are plastic combs that you attach 
to your electric clippers to provide an even cut. So if you get a half-inch guide 
comb, you’ll get a half-inch cut. Pretty simple, isn’t it?
Some guide combs come with the clippers. Others you have to buy separately.
Using scissors
When you just can’t get your dog’s coat to even out with clippers no matter 
how hard you try, use scissors, but only with extreme caution. Scissors can 
injure you and your dog if you’re not careful.
You can find plenty of reasons for using scissors on your dog’s coat. One is 
that you just don’t have the same control with clippers that you do with 
scissors. If you need to trim whiskers or stray hairs from your dog, for 
example, scissors probably work better than clippers. Scissors are best 
used on dogs who are already groomed properly and just need touch-ups. 
Consider these tips when using scissors:

 Choose scissors that are sharp and made for dogs.
 
 Never use dull scissors on a dog’s coat.
 
 Go slowly when using the scissors.
 
 Always keep your fingers between the scissors and your dog’s skin. 
Otherwise, you may easily suffer a mishap that requires you to take your 
dog to the emergency vet.
 
 Train your dog to stay still when you’re using scissors, to avoid injury.
 
 Avoid distractions when using scissors. No TV, no chatty friends, no talk 
radio. Remember, you’re working on your dog with a sharp instrument.
 
Thinning scissors (also called thinning shears) are used to thin the coat or 
blend one layer of hair with another. They have rows of skipped teeth that 
cut only every other hair. As with all scissors, thinning scissors can be 
dangerous if used incorrectly or without care.

Getting Down to Clipping Business
Before you cut your first dog hair, plan ahead. Your dog must be clean, with 
all mats and tangles brushed out, before you start clipping. Doing so makes 
clipping the coat evenly easier for you.
Preparing for success
You have your clippers and your dog. Now what? These handy tips can help 
you get your dog used to the clippers and keep your dog looking good:
 
 Start clipping your dog as early as possible, even as a puppy. Getting 
an older dog used to the clippers is much harder than training a puppy.
 
 Read your dog’s breed standard. Often you can get clues about how 
your dog’s coat should look and how to make it look that way.
 
 Check out the breed club’s Web site for tips on how club members 
clip their dogs. Some clubs provide free guidelines.
 
 Have a professional groomer or a breeder show you how your dog’s 
coat needs to be clipped. Most groomers and breeders are happy to 
spend a little time helping you — or have a pro do it the first time.
If you make a mistake, don’t fret. Your dog may have a bad hair day, but it’ll 
eventually grow out. Your main concern is using your clippers safely.
Using clippers safely
Follow these handy guidelines for safely using clippers on your dog’s coat:
 
 Be sure your clipper blades are sharp. Dull clippers pull hair more.
 
 Choose the clipper blade that works best with your dog’s specific type 
of coat so you achieve the result you want.
 
 If you’re not sure about the cut of the blade you’re using, you can try 
using one of the many available snap-on guide combs. These combs help 
you make a uniform cut.
 
 Always use clipper coolant or lubricant on your blades, to keep them 
from getting too warm and burning your dog. Coolant or lubricant 
is available through pet supply catalogs and on the Internet. Clipper 
blades can become extremely hot, especially when you use them for a 
long time. If you burn your dog, she won’t soon forget and will decide 
that clippers are no fun. Make sure that you wipe off excess lubricant, or 
you’ll end up getting oil all over that nice clean coat.

 Frequently turn your clippers off and touch them to make sure that 
they’re not too hot. If they become too warm, spray on coolant. It’s 
made especially for cooling down hot clippers. (Follow the directions on 
the canister.) When the clippers become too warm, you can also
 
• Switch blades and let the hot ones cool down.
 
• Switch to another clippers (if you have one).
 
• Place the blade on a metal surface, which quickly cools it off (a 
cookie or baking sheet works).
Making your first clip
The best way to find out how to use your clippers is to start by neatening up 
areas where your dog has already been trimmed but where the fur has grown 
a little untidy.
Before jumping into the deep fur, however, make sure that you’ve chosen the 
clipper size that works best for your dog’s coat and the right blade. Your dog 
also should be clean and free of tangles and mats.
Hold the clippers in a way that feels comfortable in your hand and gives you 
the most control over them. Check out Figure 4-2 to get a better idea.
 
Figure 4-2: 
Clipping a

clippers, it 
can be fun.
 

356
Book III: Cleanliness Is Next to Dogliness: Grooming 
By starting with an inconspicuous area that needs some neatening up, you 
can easily find out how much hair your clippers and blade take off. If the 
amount of hair you removed is too much or too little, you can adjust by 
switching to a different guide comb setting or blade.
 
The higher the number of the blade, the shorter and finer the cut. And always 
appraise your work as your clipping progresses — after you’ve trimmed a bit. 
That way, you know whether you’re taking off too much or too little. Don’t 
forget, however, that taking off too little is better than taking off too much. 
You can always trim off more, but you can’t glue it back on.
And don’t forget to trim the hair that sticks out around and between your 
dog’s paw pads, if you like a neater look. Simply use an electric clippers with 
a size 10 blade and hold the foot in its normal shape (not splayed). Trim the 
hair that sticks out beyond the pads (don’t clip down between the pads), and 
then use the clippers to trim any other hair around the foot that ruins a neat 
presentation.
Attempting a Pet cut
Unless you’re set on giving your dog a show cut (usually because you’re 
showing your dog), sometimes the best thing to do is to clip your dog in an 
easy-to-maintain cut. Often called a Puppy cut, a Teddy Bear cut, or a Pet cut, 
this cut doesn’t require much work (see Figure 4-3). Follow these steps for 
giving your pooch a Pet cut:
 
1. Equip your clippers with a size 30 or 40 blade and an appropriate 
snap-on guide comb set at the right length for your clip.
 
2. Go over your dog’s body with the clippers, trimming her coat to an 
even length.
 
3. Remove the snap-on guide comb and gently trim the ears with either a 
size 10 blade or size 15 blade (if you want a closer shave).
 
 Trim to the ear flaps, thus following the line of the ear.
 
4. Using the size 10 or size 15 blade without the snap-on guide comb, 
gently trim your dog’s underside — especially around the genitals and 
anus, to keep them clean.
Oops! Righting a wrong
Everyone makes mistakes. It’s a normal part of being human. Occasionally, 
you’ll make goof-ups that don’t hurt your dog but make her look pretty silly. 
No matter how hard you try, you’ll make a mess, and now your dog looks like 
she’s having a bad hair day. What do you do?

Take a deep breath before you panic, and try to relax. If your dog is injured, 
with cuts to the skin, see Chapter 3 in Book II on how to handle them. If your 
dog has suffered clipper burn, you can use a little aloe vera on the burn — 
and remember to keep your clippers cool next time.
If your dog has not been injured, remember that the mess you’ve made is 
only hair, and hair does grow back. You just need to figure out how to fix the 
problem so your dog won’t be the laughingstock at the dog park.
Assess the problem first. What did you do that looks so awful? In most cases, 
you’re probably looking at an uneven spot or two, so check to see whether 
you can blend the two layers of hair together. Thinning scissors or shears — 
see the “Using scissors” section earlier in this chapter — can sometimes fix a 
problem; sometimes they can’t. Sometimes you can trim the area around the 
uneven spot to match, or vice versa. Your dog’s coat may be a little short for 
a while, and if it’s cold, she may have to wear a sweater.
 
If you’re afraid you’ll end up with a bald dog, put away all your grooming 
tools, take your dog off the table, and have a cup of coffee (or tea). When 
you’ve relaxed, evaluate your dog. Can you realistically fix the problem? Or 
do you need to call in the pros? And of course, try not to clip your dog’s coat 
to the point where the only thing a pro can do is shave her.

M
ax, a 10-week-old Beagle, is delighting his new owner with his puppy 
antics but is dismaying her with his penchant for peeing all over 
her recently installed carpet. No matter how recently he tinkled outside, he 
always seems to have something left over with which to tinkle on the floor 
covering.
Allie, a 6-year-old Golden Retriever, would never pee on anyone’s carpet. 
Her people can count on her to do her business three or four times a day: 
first thing in the morning, early in the afternoon, in the late afternoon 
(sometimes), and in the evening before she retires for the night. On the rare 
occasions that she needs an extra bathroom break, she lets her people know 
by heading to the back door and scratching it — or if her tummy is giving her 
trouble, by waking up one of her people to get her outside in time to avoid an 
accident.
Cody, a 3-year-old Chihuahua, can hold his water pretty well — sometimes. 
Other times, though, he seems to suffer from bathroom-manners amnesia 
or a sudden preference for taking a whiz any place except where he’s 
supposed to.
Which of these dogs are housetrained? Which ones aren’t? In this chapter, 
you not only find the answer to those two questions, but also discover why 
housetraining plays such an important role in whether you and your dog can 
live happily ever after.

Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
What Housetraining Is 
and Why It Matters
To know whether your dog is really housetrained, you need to understand 
exactly what housetraining is. Simply put, housetraining is the process by 
which you teach your dog to eliminate when you want him to and where you 
want him to — and to refrain from eliminating at any other time or place.
That definition doesn’t allow much room for errors or lapses. And clearly, 
when measured against those criteria, a dog who consistently does his duty 
outdoors or in a designated indoor area is fully housetrained. That’s not the 
case, though, with a dog who usually tinkles outdoors, never tinkles outdoors, 
or only occasionally tinkles outdoors (or performs with similar levels of 
consistency in a predetermined indoor Bowser bathroom). Housetraining is 
one of those all-or-nothing cases. That being the case, Allie is the only dog in 
the chapter intro whom you can consider truly housetrained.
Why does such precision matter? Simple: An otherwise well-behaved, healthy 
dog who doesn’t know proper pooch potty protocol is much more likely to 
lose his home than a similar dog who knows his bathroom basics. No human 
being likes to have his home turned into a multiroom canine toilet — and if 
such a human can’t teach his dog to take his bathroom business elsewhere, 
that dog will likely find himself going elsewhere.
Why Your Dog Can’t Be “a 
Little Bit Housetrained”
Housetraining is an either-or proposition: Either a dog is housetrained or not. 
To say that a dog is “a little bit housetrained” is like saying that a woman is “a 
little bit pregnant.”
 
If you consider your dog to be “a little bit housetrained,” you’re really saying 
that she hasn’t completely learned proper bathroom manners yet. So you 
can’t really rely on her to go to the bathroom only where and when you want 
her to.
Until your dog is totally housetrained, you always face the chance that Lassie 
will decide to use your brand-new area rug as her toilet or that Laddie will 
choose to anoint your mother-in-law’s prized Chippendale chair. And of 
course, for some dogs, especially puppies, those chances are way better than 
even. That’s certainly the case with Max, the young Beagle from the chapter 
intro who’s been using that new carpet as his own personal potty.

But owners of adult dogs like Cody, the Chihuahua who’s occasionally leaving 
unwelcome puddles throughout his owner’s abode, also cope with unreliable 
canines. Cody appears to have forgotten the lessons in bathroom manners 
his owners taught him years ago — or perhaps he never quite understood 
those lessons in the first place. Or maybe Cody doesn’t feel well.
But although housetraining is an either-or proposition, owners definitely can 
teach a dog proper potty behavior in more than one way.
Exploring Housetraining Methods
Most people who choose to live with dogs want to be able to regulate their 
canines’ bathroom deportment. They want their dogs to poop and pee where 
and when they (the people) choose.
Fortunately, you can choose between two methods designed to help you 
achieve this goal. The right choice for you and your dog depends on many 
factors, some of which relate less to your dog’s needs than to your way of 
living. This section discusses indoor and outdoor training and talks about 
some of the lifestyle issues that may help you choose one method over 
another.
Location, location, location: Outdoor 
versus indoor training
The two housetraining methods are all about location — as in, where you 
want your pooch to potty: indoors or outdoors.
Outdoor training
If the idea of turning part of your house into a canine bathroom doesn’t thrill 
you, you’re far from alone. That same lack of enthusiasm is probably the 
primary reason millions of dog owners train their four-legged friends to do 
their bathroom business outside. Outdoor training involves teaching a dog to 
eliminate in a potty area located outside your home. The potty area can be a 
designated spot in your backyard or wherever you allow your dog to do his 
business, such as on walks.
Outdoor training has plenty of advantages. First and foremost, as soon as 
your dog knows what he’s supposed to do and where he’s supposed to do it, 
you never again need to worry about canine waste marring your floors, 
staining your carpets, or otherwise stinking up your house. You also have 
more floor space to use and enjoy, because you don’t have any newspapers, 

364
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
litter boxes, or other indoor canine bathroom paraphernalia to get in the 
way of household foot traffic. Finally, owners who choose to walk their dogs 
outdoors can get some healthful, enjoyable exercise and some special 
bonding time with their canine companions.
But outdoor training carries some disadvantages, too — just ask anyone 
who’s had to go outside with his pooch on a cold or rainy night. Fortunately, 
a little extra training can go a long way toward alleviating the problem of the 
pooch who takes too long to do his business during bad weather.
 
Don’t think that letting your pooch potty in your yard relieves you of the 
obligation to clean up those deposits. Unless you like having bright yellow 
patches in the middle of your green grass or stepping in the other stuff — 
because that stuff generally doesn’t degrade fast enough for you to totally 
avoid such missteps — plan on cleaning up after your four-legged friend even 
if his potty is on your property.
Indoor training
Indoor training involves teaching a dog to eliminate in a potty area located 
inside your home. The potty area can be some newspapers spread on the 
floor in one room, a litter box tucked discreetly into a corner, or some other 
device located in a designated area of your abode.
A dog who’s indoor trained makes a beeline for that indoor location 
whenever she feels the urge to eliminate. As soon as she’s finished, cleanup 
is easy: You just flush the poop down the toilet and either throw away or 
clean the surface upon which the poop or pee landed.
 
Indoor training is a viable housetraining option if, for some reason, taking 
your dog outside to eliminate isn’t practical. This method is also worth trying 
if your adult dog and her waste byproducts are very small.
But indoor training carries some disadvantages. It’s impractical if your dog 
is much bigger than toy sized (consider how big that waste is likely to be). 
Moreover, if your canine companion is male, sooner or later he’ll probably 
starting lifting his leg when he pees. When that happens, his ability to aim 
accurately may decline. Instead of hitting the litter box, newspaper, or other 
toilet, he may . . . well, you get the idea.

Looking at lifestyle factors to 
help you choose your method
How do you decide which housetraining method works best for you? The 
right answer depends as much on your way of living as it does on your dog’s 
needs.
Maybe you’re one of those lucky people who not only works from home 
during the day but also has some nice outdoor places within walking distance. 
For you, walking a dog can be a real pleasure — and at times even a sanity 
saver. A housetraining method that takes you and your dog outdoors is 
probably an attractive option.
Perhaps, though, you’re an elderly person or a mobility-impaired individual 
who can’t get out and around easily. The dog walk that’s pure pleasure for 
your work-at-home neighbor may be torture for you. If this description fits 
you, the ideal housetraining method probably means never having to leave 
the house. Indoor training may be a better choice.
Maybe you live in a high-rise apartment building in the middle of the city. 
When your canine companion needs a potty break, you can’t just snap on 
the leash, open the front door, and head out for a quick stroll or a trip to a 
designated doggie toilet area. Instead, your route to the great outdoors may 
require you and your dog to walk to the opposite end of a long hallway, wait 
for the elevator, ride down to your building lobby, and finally get yourselves 
to the proper spot outside. And all this time, your dog is expected to hold 
her water. If you and your dog face such obstacles en route to an outdoor 
bathroom, you may also want to consider keeping her potty indoors.
Although housetraining is generally a straightforward process, chances are, 
you’ll encounter setbacks during the training period. And even when your 
four-legged friend becomes a housetraining graduate, she’s bound to do 
some occasional backsliding. In any case, you’ll likely see situations in which 
your consistently rock-solid housetrainee suddenly seems to lose her edge, 
and neither you nor she knows why.

366
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Understanding the Role You 
and Your Family Play
You and the other humans in your life play crucial roles in your dog’s 
housetraining progress and ultimate success (or lack thereof). Not only do 
you teach your dog the ins and outs of proper potty protocol, but you also 
create the conditions that can make or break a housetraining program. For 
one thing, housetraining needs to be a family affair. Consider why:
 
 To keep the diet consistent: No matter how diligently you’re trying to 
regulate Sparky’s bathroom urges by regulating the kind and amount 
of food you feed him, such diligence is all for naught if your partner or 
child is sneaking the dog snacks all the while.
 
 To help you avoid burnout: Housetraining can be pretty simple, but it 
can also be pretty tedious when just one person is doing the day-in, day-
out routine of feeding, walking, and confining the housetrainee.
But maybe getting your family on board isn’t your problem. Maybe you’re 
trying to deal with housetraining a dog while working away from home all 
day. Even well into the 21st century, corporate America isn’t great about 
accommodating the needs of employees’ family members, whether those 
members are human or canine.
 
Your dog or puppy has all the instincts and desire he needs to motivate him 
to acquire good bathroom manners — he just needs you to get him going. If 
you do the job right, not only will your dog become a housetraining ace, but 
the two of you will build a bond that goes the distance for years to come.
Scheduling Outdoor Training 
for Adult Dogs
Teaching an adult dog to do her bathroom business outside is similar to 
teaching a puppy. The difference between the two, and the good news, is that 
an adult dog doesn’t need nearly as many bathroom breaks as a puppy does. 
But the principles and procedures are the same: showing your four-legged 
friend that her bathroom is outside and doing whatever it takes to keep her 
from eliminating inside.

Training the Housetrainer: Taking 
the Right Approach
Before a person can teach any subject, he has to know not only the subject 
itself, but also how to convey that information to a student. The same is true 
for housetraining. For your puppy or dog to learn basic bathroom manners, 
you must teach him those manners in a way he can understand.
That said, your four-legged friend brings plenty of positive attributes to the 
housetraining process: a strong instinct to seek out a den, an equally strong 
instinct to keep that den clean, an ability to learn through repetition, and a 
desire to score rewards. But it’s up to you to capitalize on those attributes 
and develop an approach to housetraining that enables him to get the hang 
of proper potty protocol with minimal stress on him — and on you.

368
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
The way you try to show your dog proper potty protocol lays the foundation 
for your efforts to teach him other maneuvers, such as coming when called, 
sitting when told, and walking nicely while leashed (see Chapter 3 in Book IV 
for details on these lessons). What you do now, in this most basic of lessons, 
can set the tone for your relationship with your dog in the years ahead. For 
that reason alone, it’s worth taking the time to do the job well.
Using Your Pooch’s Instincts 
to Lay a Foundation
When housetraining your pooch, you’re not working with a blank slate. Your 
canine companion probably learned a lot about bathroom behavior before 
you ever met her — whether she came to you as a puppy or as an adult dog. 
And a lot of what she knows comes from her instincts: those feelings, drives, 
and desires that have been with your dog since the moment she was born. 
They’re hard wired into her very being. No one taught her the behaviors that 
result from these impulses; they just came naturally.
Leaving behind housetraining methods of yesteryear
Housetraining a dog doesn’t have to be hard. 
But a generation ago, not many people realized 
that fact. At best, housetraining was a difficult 
undertaking; at worst, it was a total failure. 
Unfortunately, failures occurred all too often.
Consider what may have been behind these 
failures. Mom (she was the one who usually 
got stuck with the housetraining task) would 
see a puddle or pile of poop on the floor. She’d 
freak — naturally, the little deposit would be 
gracing a just-mopped kitchen floor or freshly 
shampooed living room carpet — and go on the 
warpath to find the canine culprit. When she 
found him, she’d grab the culprit by the collar, 
drag him over to the puddle or pile, and yell, 
“Bad dog!” at him. Maybe she’d swat him with 
a rolled-up newspaper. She may even have 
rubbed his nose in the object of his offense. 
The terrified pooch would then creep away, and 
things would settle down, at least temporarily.
Maybe the dog would eventually figure out 
what Mom was trying to tell him. Often, though, 
he wouldn’t. And so the dog would soon have 
another accident, and the whole miserable 
cycle would begin again. Still, the dog was 
learning something: He learned that he should 
avoid the rolled-up newspaper at all costs. He 
also learned that he should avoid screaming 
moms.
Most of the problems people had with house-
training their dogs weren’t the dogs’ faults; they 
were the people’s faults. People knew very little 
about the canine instincts that make house-
training and other training easier. They knew 
only that they didn’t want their dogs to do their 
business inside the house.
Since then, dog trainers and owners alike have 
discovered a lot about how dogs learn. And you 
can use that knowledge to make housetraining 
a much easier process than when your mother 
was trying to do the job.

369
 Chapter 1: Housetraining 101
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
The places where your dog chooses to sleep, her tendency to hoard things, 
her love of licking your face, her delight in fetching objects — these and 
countless other actions and reactions may all be inborn. And although some 
of these instincts don’t affect her ability to be housetrained, others do. After 
you find out about some of these inborn impulses, you can begin to direct 
them in ways that help your dog learn to do what you want her to do. Your 
dog’s instincts help her pick up not only potty deportment, but also just 
about anything else you want your dog to know.
The training your dog has already 
had, whether puppy or adult
You can housetrain almost any dog, but the challenges of teaching a puppy 
to go potty may differ from the challenges you encounter when you try to 
teach the same maneuvers to an adult dog. Some of these issues have to do 
with the kind of nurturing and training the dog has already received.
The wee ones: Preliminary training and physical limits
 
All a healthy puppy usually needs to become housetrained is some time to 
grow and to develop some self-control — and, of course, some guidance from 
you in the meantime.
If you got your puppy from a reputable breeder, he may already know the 
rudiments of proper potty behavior. After all, the well-bred pup has had lots 
of opportunities to learn about keeping clean and getting along with other 
dogs (and people) — both of which are important pre-housetraining skills. 
A puppy who has nailed those basics is easier to teach than one who lacks 
such knowledge.
Many breeders go even further. They take their puppies outside every 
morning and after meals, and they praise the little pups when they eliminate. 
If your puppy’s breeder did that (ask when you’re interviewing prospective 
breeders), she already did some of your dog’s housetraining for you. The 
same may be true of a dog you adopt from a shelter, rescue group, or individual.
But even if your new puppy aced those preliminary lessons, one crucial 
lesson he’s only starting to learn is the lesson of self-control. To put it 
simply, your little pup just can’t hold it — at least, not for very long. A puppy 
younger than 4 months doesn’t have a big enough bladder or sufficient 
muscle control to go more than a couple hours without eliminating. As he 
gets older, a pup’s ability to control himself gradually increases. By the 
time he reaches adulthood, at about 1 year of age, a healthy dog usually has 
plenty of self-control. In fact, some adult dogs can hold it for a very long time.

370
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Grown-up pooches: Unlearning bad habits
Even an adult dog who appears to have an iron bladder isn’t necessarily 
housetrained. The fact that she can hold it doesn’t necessarily mean that she 
will hold it. An adult dog may be burdened with mental baggage or just plain 
bad habits that can create additional obstacles to housetraining.
For example, if you adopted your young adult dog from an animal shelter, 
her previous owners may not have bothered to housetrain her — or if they 
did, they may have done a poor job. Either way, her failure to master proper 
potty deportment may well have been what landed her in the shelter in the 
first place.
Some shelter and rescue dogs have behavioral problems that manifest as 
inappropriate elimination — for example, a shy dog may roll over and pee 
whenever someone stands above her and looks directly at her. Even a dog 
who’s been a model of proper bathroom behavior at one point in her life can 
later appear to forget what she’s been taught.
Not surprisingly, then, housetraining an adult dog is often less straight-
forward than housetraining a puppy. The grown-up pooch who has less-
than-stellar bathroom manners often needs to unlearn some bad but 
well-entrenched habits before learning new ones. The person who lives with 
such a dog may need to develop his detective skills and figure out why his 
canine companion keeps making bathroom mistakes.
In any case, though, when you know something about your canine friend’s 
instincts and impulses, you have a leg up on your efforts to housetrain her.
How long can a dog hold it?
Some dogs appear to have bladders made of 
iron. When the weather is bad, for example, 
they slap their floodgates shut. A storm-
frightened dog can hold it for up to 24 hours, 
even if you give him ample opportunity to 
unload during that time period.
Still, just because your dog has an iron bladder 
doesn’t mean you should put it to the test. Keep 
some guidelines in mind:
  Most experts say a dog needs a chance to 
pee at least every eight to ten hours.
  For puppies, the standard guideline is that 
they can hold it for the number of months 
they’ve lived plus one. In other words, your 
3-month-old youngster can hold it for about 
four hours, max. But for many puppies of 
that age, even four hours is pushing their 
anatomical limits; they may need trips every 
three hours, or even every two hours for a 
while.
  Very small puppies, such as toy breeds, 
often need hourly potty breaks when they’re 
under 4 months of age simply because their 
bladders are so small.

Learning from mom
Even while he’s still with his litter, a puppy is learning a lot about life as a 
dog. From his littermates, he learns not to bite too hard (if he bites at all) 
and how to jockey for position at feeding time. He learns a lot about proper 
bathroom behavior, too.
Puppies can start learning elimination etiquette from the time they’re about 
3 or 4 weeks old — in some cases, even earlier. Generally, their bathroom 
manners start kicking in when they have sufficient motor skills to start 
wandering around the whelping box where they’ve been living with their 
mom, and perhaps outside the box, too.
The mama dog takes advantage of this ability. When the pups indicate that 
they’re about to go potty, she may use her nose to push them outside the 
box if they haven’t already gotten themselves out of there. Doing so keeps 
their poop and pee from stinking up the doggie domicile. If the mama dog 
and puppies are lucky enough to be residing in the home of a good breeder, 
several layers of newspaper will be at the other end of the box or other 
quarters for the puppies to eliminate on. After the puppies eliminate on the 
newspaper that the breeder placed on the floor for just that purpose, she 
whisks away the soiled papers and replaces them with fresh ones. A breeder 
reinforces the mama dog’s efforts in this way.
By 7 or 8 weeks of age, most puppies have developed enough control to 
master this first bathroom lesson. They have to poop and pee every couple 
hours or so, but they’ve learned to listen to their bodies, and they can tell 
when they need to go. When they get those urges, they try to scurry away 
from their den before giving in to that compulsion to squat. This effort to 
eliminate away from the den signals that a puppy is ready to begin learning 
the rudiments of housetraining.
Den dynamics
The lessons a puppy learns about keeping clean go way beyond what her 
mom makes her do. The nest that a dog’s mother teaches her to help keep 
clean is really her first den — and dens are a big deal in the lives of most 
dogs.
 
For a dog, the den is simply an area that she can call her own. Generally, it’s 
a small place that’s at least somewhat enclosed on two or three sides but is 
also open on at least one side. The area may be dark, but it doesn’t have to 
be. What it does have to be is a place where the dog feels safe and secure.
Unlike her wolf ancestors, the domestic dog doesn’t need a den to ensure her 
physical survival, but her urge to find a den is still very strong.

Cleanliness is next to dogliness
So-called dog people — humans who are enamored of anything and everything 
remotely canine — like to say that the word God is really dog spelled backward. 
They may espouse the motto of a magazine called The Bark: “Dog is my 
co-pilot.” These dog people aren’t being blasphemous. Dogs instinctively 
want to keep themselves clean.
Sometimes a dog’s definition of cleanliness differs slightly from yours. You 
probably don’t like the idea of Fido’s splashing in a mud puddle, but Fido may 
not mind the mud at all. In terms of peeing and pooping, though, Fido and 
most of his canine compatriots draw the line between dirt and cleanliness — 
and they draw that line right smack in front of their dens.
Instinctively, a normal, healthy dog does just about anything to avoid having 
to use his den as a toilet area. The last thing he wants to do is deposit his 
bodily waste anywhere near his cherished domicile. You can make that 
impulse work in your favor as you housetrain your dog. The impulse to keep 
the den clean is the foundation of teaching dogs to poop and pee only where 
and when you want them to. The drive to use a den and the drive to avoid 
soiling that den form the basis of easy, effective housetraining — using a 
crate.
Life without guilt
Suppose your dog makes a mistake. Say that he anoints your freshly mopped 
kitchen floor or leaves a little pile of poop in the foyer. Do you think he feels 
bad about it? Do you think he’s overcome with remorse? Do you think he 
even remembers he’s done a dirty deed within five minutes of committing the 
act? The answers to those questions are no, no, and no. Guilt and remorse 
aren’t in your dog’s emotional repertoire.
“Now, wait a minute,” you say. “When I come home at night from work and 
see that Fido’s peed on the rug, he sure looks to me as though he’s feeling 
guilty. And when I start yelling at him, his ears go back, his tail goes between 
his legs, and he kind of cringes. He knows he’s done something wrong.”
Fido knows something all right — but that something isn’t any realization 
that he’s messed up big time. What he does know is that you’re angry. If 
you’re yelling his name, he also figures out pretty quickly that you’re angry 
at him. But he doesn’t have a clue about why you’re so upset; he’s long since 
forgotten about his little rug-christening party. All he knows is that you’re 
mad at him, and he’s scared of you. Under such circumstances, he takes 
what looks to him like two prudent courses of action: literally making himself 
smaller (that’s why he cringes) and beating a hasty retreat.

373
 Chapter 1: Housetraining 101
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
Does he understand that you don’t want him to have any more accidents in 
the house? Nope. Does he realize that if he didn’t have any accidents, you 
wouldn’t become angry? No again. He’s just doing everything he can to 
minimize your wrath and, when that fails, to get away from that wrath — and 
from you.
 
Your dog lives a life that’s completely free of guilt. He doesn’t connect one 
of his long-ago actions with the angry outburst you’re having now, which is 
why yelling at your dog after the fact doesn’t teach him anything except to 
be afraid of you. Time, patience, and consistency are much more likely to get 
you the results you seek.
Learning by repetition
Your dog’s inability to remember past mistakes doesn’t mean that she can’t 
make connections. On the contrary, she’s very good at linking cause and 
effect. You can use that linking ability to teach her proper bathroom behavior 
or just about anything else you want her to know. How? Behold the power of 
repetition.
In fact, many times your dog learns something that you didn’t plan to teach 
her. Your dog may know when you’re about to leave the house — and, in 
response to your near departure, may head down to her crate on her own. 
How does she know? You perform the same sequence of actions every time 
you leave the house: You may turn off some lights, close doors, grab your 
wallet and iPod, pick up your purse, get out your car keys . . . that sequence 
is an unmistakable signal.
Although repetition is the key to teaching your dog what you want her 
to know, you can do less repeating when you provide her with some sort 
of incentive for doing the right thing. Find out more about this positive 
approach in the later section, titled “Rewarding the good, ignoring the goofs.”
The need for attachment
 
Puppies tumble over each other constantly and seem to be touching each 
other all the time. Rarely do you see one puppy consistently go off by himself. 
Puppies need each other for warmth and companionship; they thrive in each 
other’s company.
But perhaps when you welcomed home your new puppy or dog, you made 
the mistake of having him sleep by himself in the kitchen or basement. If so, 
you undoubtedly experienced a night full of heart-rending wails, yips, and 
howls. Your canine companion didn’t like being alone, away from his littermates 
or the companions of his previous home. Being away from you made those 
already bad feelings seem even worse.

374
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
And of course, you may have a neighborhood dog whose owner leaves him 
alone in the backyard all day, every day, and who barks his head off — much 
to the annoyance of people who live nearby. Why does he do it? Boredom is 
one reason. Loneliness is another.
 
Dogs are social animals. When they have a chance to choose between being 
alone and being with another individual, they generally choose the latter.
What does this need for company have to do with housetraining? Plenty. 
Not only does your dog’s desire to be with you help build a precious bond 
between the two of you, but it also helps you keep track of where he is and 
what he’s doing during the housetraining process. No matter how you look at 
it, your dog’s instinctive desire to be close to you is something you can use 
as part of his housetraining — and any other training, for that matter.
How instincts can be thwarted
Instincts play a big role in how quickly your dog masters the art of house-
training. Many puppies learn basic cleanliness and social skills — two 
important pre-housetraining accomplishments — from their mothers and 
littermates. But what if, for some reason, a puppy doesn’t pick up those 
lessons in the first few weeks of her life? And how can that happen? One 
answer to how that happens is just two words: puppy mills.
Puppy mills: Inhibiting instincts
 
Puppy mills are substandard breeding operations in which female dogs are 
forced to mate as often as possible. Breeders raise mother and pups in 
deplorable conditions — tiny cages in which these poor animals barely have 
enough room to turn around. They also often have to live knee-deep in their 
own poop and pee.
 
Having to live in her own filth is a surefire way to short-circuit a dog’s 
instinctive drive to do her bathroom business away from her den. She can’t 
get away from her den. And especially if she’s a puppy, she can’t hold it long 
enough. Sooner or later, she has to go, and if the den is the only place where 
she can eliminate, that’s where she does so. Eventually, she learns to deal 
with it.
What does this kind of situation mean for housetraining? Simple: A puppy-
mill dog may take quite a while to recover her instinct to potty away from her 
den. And until she does, housetraining will be extremely difficult for everyone 
involved. This doesn’t mean that a puppy-mill pooch can’t be housetrained. 
Plenty of people have persevered until their canine companions finally 
understood where and when they were supposed to potty. But getting to that 
point takes lots of time and even more patience.

375
 Chapter 1: Housetraining 101
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
Unfortunately, many people lack such patience. Life with their puppy-mill 
potty delinquents may veer off in one of two directions. Either the owners 
put up with a dog they say is “partially housetrained” (which really means 
the dog isn’t housetrained at all), or the owners decide that they can’t 
tolerate the stains, smells, and aggravation of a dog who can’t learn basic 
bathroom manners. In turn, they either relegate the dog to remote areas of 
the house or, worse, get rid of the dog. Any way you look at it, the outcome is 
unhappy for all concerned.
Clearly, avoiding such problems in the first place is a good idea. How? By 
not buying a puppy or dog who comes from a puppy mill. A large number of 
these pooches end up in retail pet stores, such as stores located in shopping 
malls. Others are sold by dealers who pose as breeders and advertise online 
or through print classifieds. Always visit the premises and ask to see the 
mama dog.
 
Many pet stores have stopped selling puppies themselves and instead hold 
adoption events to allow shelters and rescue groups to showcase the puppies 
and dogs who need new homes. Such stores clearly indicate that they’re 
holding such events, and personnel from the shelter or rescue group are 
there to talk with you about the animals up for adoption. If that’s the case 
with the pet store you’re considering, assess the puppies and dogs up for 
adoption, and know that, in doing so, you may be saving a life. If you can’t tell 
whether the store is selling puppies or is just giving a shelter or rescue group 
a place to display the animals in their care, think two, three, four, or more 
times before acquiring a puppy from that store.
Animal shelters and rescue groups: Lacking socialization?
Suppose you’ve opted for an older dog or a mixed breed from a shelter or 
rescue group. Will such a dog pose special housetraining challenges? That 
question has no single answer.
Lots of dogs from animal shelters and rescue groups do just fine with 
housetraining. In fact, quite a few of them have mastered basic bathroom 
behavior before they even arrive at their new home. Some, though, may not 
have done so. And some may be poorly socialized — in other words, they 
lack the exposure to everyday sights, sounds, and people that enables them 
to become emotionally well-adjusted animals. This poor socialization may 
make it tougher for such a dog to become bonded to you and may also make 
it tougher for you to help him unlearn some bad bathroom habits.
This certainly doesn’t mean that the dog you adopt from a shelter or a rescue 
group can’t be housetrained. The task simply may be a bit more challenging 
than you expected. You’ll get a leg up on that challenge, however, if you find 
out as much as you can about your dog’s background before you bring him 
home and start teaching him basic bathroom etiquette.

Taking the 21st-Century Approach 
to Housetraining
Today more people understand that to get what they want from their dogs, 
they first have to tune in to what their dogs want. People have discovered 
a lot about how dogs think, feel, and learn. They now know that most dogs 
don’t want to poop or pee anywhere near where they sleep and eat. They 
understand that every canine likes to have a den to call her own. They realize 
that dogs don’t remember what they’ve done within a few minutes of having 
done it. Consistency, patience, and repetition are the tools you need to teach 
your dog what you want her to know.
Such knowledge enables you to develop a training approach that helps you 
help your dog express her instincts in ways that are acceptable to you. In 
other words, you can train your dog not only to do what you want, but to do 
what she wants, too. After you know what your dog can bring to the house-
training process, you have to realize what you need to bring to that same 
enterprise. This section covers some of the qualities that can help you be the 
best teacher your dog will ever have.
Seeing your dog’s point of view
Any communications theorist, corporate trainer, or psychologist will tell 
you that to persuade someone to do what you want, you have to put yourself 
in his shoes. You need to imagine his thoughts and figure out what makes 
him tick.
 
Empathy is just as important when you’re trying to reach a dog as when 
you’re trying to persuade a person. You need to understand the way your 
dog views the world and relates to it. In terms of housetraining or any other 
teaching, you’ll be miles ahead of the game if you can think like a dog.
When you think like a dog, you realize that
 
 Disciplining your dog after he’s done something wrong doesn’t do any 
good, because he has no idea what that “something wrong” is.
 
 For many dogs, peeing is much more than an act of elimination — it’s a 
way to communicate with other canines.
 
 The shy little darling who rolls onto his back and dribbles a bit of urine 
when you come home hasn’t mislaid his bathroom manners. Instead, 
he’s paying homage to you, doggie style.

377
 Chapter 1: Housetraining 101
Book IV

 When you’re out walking with your four-legged friend at night and he 
stops suddenly in the middle of the sidewalk, he’s not being stubborn; 
more likely, he sees something that scares him. To you, it’s just another 
garbage can, but to him, it’s big and bad and dark and menacing. When 
you realize what he’s feeling and thinking, you can coax him past the 
object in question instead of yanking on his leash and dragging him to you.
 
You can’t succeed with housetraining — or any type of dog training — by 
shoving your wishes down your dog’s throat and expecting him to swallow 
them. Force isn’t effective; it pits the two of you against each other. Instead, 
you and your canine companion should be on the same side. You should 
have a common goal: figuring out how to live happily together.
Being benevolent
A lot of dog-training literature, not to mention amateur trainers or people 
who think they know the scoop, tell you that dominance and leadership are 
the keys to training success. “Show your dog who’s boss,” they say. “Don’t let 
her get away with anything.”
Some “experts” even recommend that you punish a transgressing dog by 
grabbing her by the scruff of the neck and rolling her over onto her back 
(called an alpha roll). Still others advocate that the best way to deal with 
a fearful dog is to help her face her fear. You won’t see any such advocacy 
here.
 
At times, a dog owner does need to be a leader. But even at such times, you 
can be a benevolent leader — the giver of all good things, the source of all 
things fun, the refuge in times of fear. Such a leader thinks not in terms of 
dominance and submission, but in terms of benevolence and cooperation. 
You can be your dog’s best teacher, but you can also be her best friend — 
and dominance never needs to be a part of your vocabulary.
Working with your dog’s instincts
You can housetrain your puppy or dog faster when you work with his 
tendencies. His need for a den, his desire to keep that den clean, and his 
ability to learn through consistency and repetition can all help him become 
a housetraining ace much faster than back in the day when all Mom had to 
work with was a rolled-up newspaper and a boatload of totally understandable 
frustration. You just have to use your dog’s instincts to your advantage.

378
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Creating a schedule
Creating a schedule for the canine housetrainee is important because, quite 
simply, having a schedule is a great way to reduce the time it takes your dog 
to get the hang of housetraining. The training process becomes a whole lot 
easier when you feed your dog, play with him, and let him eliminate at the 
same times every single day.
A schedule plays right into your dog’s need for repetition, consistency, and 
predictability. A schedule also makes it a whole lot easier for you to anticipate 
when your dog needs to pee and poop and then to get him to the right place 
before he has an accident. You won’t find a one-schedule-fits-all timetable. 
You need to put together a regimen that fits your dog’s age, his degree of 
housetraining prowess, and the housetraining method you’re using. 
Rewarding the good, ignoring the goofs
No, this section isn’t an advertorial for the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale’s 
treatise on The Power of Positive Thinking. But frankly, he had a point: A 
whole lot of power lies in positive thinking — and in positive training, too.
Think about the old approach to dog training. Basically, it revolved around 
finding your dog doing something wrong and then punishing her for doing 
so. But that approach doesn’t work very well. All too often, dogs don’t know 
what they’re doing wrong, much less how to do something right.
The opposite, positive approach works much better than the negative one. 
Instead of pouncing on your dog for messing up, look for her to do the right 
thing — and when she does, reward her lavishly. That reward can come in 
the form of verbal praise, loving hugs and petting, tasty treats, or even all 
three. In any case, take a positive approach, not a negative one.
Of course, you don’t just wait passively for your dog to do the right thing. 
As part of your approach, you need to actively guide her into performing the 
maneuvers you want her to perform, using her instincts to help her get the 
idea a little faster. And when she does get the idea, don’t forget to praise her 
to the skies. You have to reward her for doing what you want her to do.
 
By consistently showing your dog what you want her to do and then 
rewarding her for doing so, you’re conditioning your dog to do the right 
thing. You’re upping the odds that she’ll do what you want her to do every 
time you want her to do it.

379
 Chapter 1: Housetraining 101

Remember reading about Pavlov’s dogs in science class? The Russian 
scientist actually got the dogs to salivate by giving each dog a food reward — 
a treat — every time a bell rang. The dogs learned that the ringing bell meant 
a treat, and they began to look forward to getting that treat. They were 
primed for that food reward, and as a result, their mouths mouth began to 
water when they heard the bell.
You don’t have to wear a white coat and have a fancy laboratory to condition 
your dog the same way Pavlov conditioned his. Simply show your pooch 
what you want and immediately reward her for doing what you’ve shown 
her — whether it’s the first time she pees in your backyard or the hundredth 
time she anoints a tree rather than the rug in your bedroom. By giving her 
that reward, you’re letting her know that she’s done something that pleases 
you, and you give her an incentive to do that something again.
What if she does something wrong? If she pees on your carpet, you clean it 
up without any comment. If she poops on your brand-new hardwood floor, 
you whisk the mess away. Period. You don’t yell at her. You don’t punish 
her. You certainly don’t rub her nose in it. You just get rid of the mess and 
move on.
 
If you catch your dog in the act of peeing or pooping in the wrong place, view 
the situation as a teaching opportunity for you and a learning opportunity for 
her. Interrupt her in the act and take her to the right place — the place where 
you’ve decided she should do her bathroom business.
Being consistent
You’ve already got so much going on in your oh-so-busy life that you can’t 
possibly remember what color your dog’s pee was yesterday or when he 
last pooped. Everyone is on information overload. But take heart. Help for 
memory-impaired folks is here: consistency. In housetraining terms, consistency 
means having your dog eat, drink, pee, and poop at the same times and 
places every day. You create a routine that the two of you eventually can do 
in your sleep (or almost, anyway).
By adopting a consistent routine for your dog’s dining and toileting activities, 
you help not only your own memory, but also your dog’s ability to housetrain 
faster. Dogs learn through repetition, so when you and he do the same things 
at the same times in the same places each day, he’ll come to expect that 
you’ll be doing those things.

380
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
This consistency affects your dog both physically and mentally. The repetition 
that you establish in feeding and housetraining your dog conditions his body 
as well as his mind. After all, you may be physically conditioned to expect 
that early morning jog or a second cup of coffee at the same time each day — 
and without the jog or joe, you don’t feel quite right. You don’t like that feeling, 
so you stick with your exercise and/or coffee routine; it becomes a habit. By 
establishing similar routines with your dog, you’re helping to make house-
training a habit for him. When his body gets used to the routine you set up 
for him, he’ll be primed to poop and pee when and where you want him to.
Don’t worry, though. After your dog is truly housetrained, you don’t have 
to be quite such a fanatic about repetition and consistency. Your dog will 
have the control he needs to hold it a little longer if your schedule hits an 
unexpected snag. Still, keeping to at least a semblance of routine is a good 
idea, even when your four-legged friend is a housetraining ace.
Attending to details
Have you ever toilet-trained a child? If so, you know the importance of paying 
attention to seemingly trivial details, such as when he last peed in the potty, 
when he last did a doo-doo in his diaper, or what he ate for dinner the night 
before he had a funny-colored bowel movement.
The same is true when you’re housetraining your dog. During this process, 
you need to remember what you fed your four-legged friend and when you 
did so. Recalling how long it’s been since he last peed or pooped is always 
a good idea. And knowing what his pee or poop normally looks like is 
important so that you can tell when he may be sick.
Paying attention to details also means taking the time to observe your dog 
and discover what makes him the unique individual he is. For example, do 
you know the answers to these questions?
 
 Does he lift his leg when he pees? Does he like to lift both legs (one at a 
time, of course)? Or does he not bother lifting his leg at all?
 
 Does he need to eliminate right after he eats, or does he like to wait 
awhile?
 
 Does he like to pee in the same spot all the time, or is he an I’ll-do-it-
anywhere piddler?
 
 Does he circle and sniff before doing his business? Or does he suddenly 
stop midstride and do the deed before you quite realize what’s happening?
 
 Is he a little introvert who sometimes releases some urine when you 
greet him? Or is he an extrovert who offers a wagging tail and canine 
grin to everyone he meets?

381

Think of the stories you tell your friends about your dog. What are some 
funny things he’s done? How about the sweet things, the poignant things? 
What are some of his quirks — potty related and otherwise?
What, you ask, do all these questions have to do with housetraining? A lot. 
The better you know your dog, the more you can empathize with him. The 
more you can empathize with him — to think the way he does — the better 
able you are to adjust his housetraining lessons to his unique character and 
perspective. And the better able you are to fine-tune your housetraining to 
his character, the more effective your housetraining efforts are overall.
This personalized — or, rather, dog-specific — approach is particularly true 
with respect to your dog’s bathroom habits. By paying attention to what he 
does when he pees or poops, you can better anticipate when he’s going to 
go — and intervene when he’s going to go in the wrong place.

Teaching Your Dog Manners
In This Chapter
 Considering your attitude toward training
 Setting up for success and checking out teaching tools
 Crate-training your dog
 Teaching the basic stuff they don’t always teach in obedience school
 Knowing how to travel with your dog
A
n old dog-training adage still applies today: Every handler gets the dog 
he deserves.
In other words, the most important factor in training is not your dog, but you. 
You’re the leader — or you should be — and you need to know enough about 
canine language so you can teach your dog your language. You need to show 
your dog what you want her to do and give her a reason for doing it — and 
an understanding that not doing the very reasonable things you ask of her is 
unacceptable.
Your dog gets trained whether you do anything or not. If you don’t guide her 
toward good behaviors and praise her when she accomplishes them, she will 
fill her life with behaviors you don’t like. If you don’t lead, she will. And that’s 
bad news for a dog. Shelters, rescue groups, and newspaper classifieds have 
plenty of dogs like that: dogs with problems. Their chances of finding happi-
ness — or even staying alive — aren’t very good at all.
That’s not the way things have to be.
 
Resolve that you must train your dog, and that training is not a one-shot deal, 
but an intrinsic and ongoing part of the promise you make to your dog when 
you bring her into your life.

Then think of the rewards of dog training. The obvious reward is good 
manners, but the bigger payoff is that as you train your own dog, the bond 
between you and your dog grows stronger, the love deeper. In Chapter 1 of 
Book IV, you found out about housetraining. In the next chapter, Chapter 3, 
you get into basic training, including step-by-step commands. This chapter 
focuses on getting a handle on your dog’s behavior and discovering how 
you can play your proper role in training your pup. The special relationship 
between an owner and a well-mannered dog is the Total Dog Experience — 
don’t miss it.
A Few Words about Aggression
If you have ever, even for a moment, been afraid of your dog or what he may 
do, read the rest of this section carefully and then put the book down, for 
now. The rest of this chapter and the next are not for you. Not yet, anyway. 
You need serious one-on-one help, whether you realize it or not.
Aggression in dogs has both genetic factors and learned ones. Some dogs 
are born with the potential to be aggressive, and that potential can be 
fully realized in a home that either encourages aggressive behavior or is ill 
equipped to cope with it. Other perfectly nice dogs can become unreliable 
because of abusive treatment.
Is your dog potentially dangerous? Answer these questions, and be brutally 
honest:
 
 Has your dog ever stared you down? Not with a loving gaze, but with a 
hard, fixed, glassy-eyed stare that may be accompanied by erect body 
posture — stiff legs, ears forward, hackles raised.
 
 Do you avoid doing certain things with your dog because doing them 
elicits growling or a show of teeth? For example, are you unable to 
approach your dog while he’s eating or ask him to get off the couch?
 
 Do you make excuses for his aggressive behavior or figure he’ll grow out 
of it? Or do you think a growling puppy is cute?
 
 Do you consider your dog safe — except around a particular group of 
people, such as children? When he growls at the veterinarian, do you tell 
yourself that the behavior is reasonable and that a veterinarian should 
be able to cope with it, after all?

 Has your dog ever bitten anyone, even only once, because it was an 
accident, because he was scared (even though he’s usually so good), or 
because of some other equally inexcusable rationalization? People often 
make excuses for the behavior of little dogs, but growling and snapping 
is no more acceptable from a Pomeranian than from a Pit Bull.
 
If, after answering these questions, you suspect that you have a problem, get 
help from a professional dog trainer or veterinary behaviorist. Now. You 
should no more attempt to cure aggression yourself than you should try to 
treat cancer. The reason is the same: You don’t have the training and the 
expertise to do so. If you suddenly try to eliminate your dog’s self-appointed 
role of leader of your pack, you’ll find trouble. If you even attempt to make 
eye contact with such a dog, you may get bitten. So don’t.
Ask your veterinarian for a referral to a trainer or behaviorist with experience 
handling aggressive dogs. And realize from the start that, just like cancer, 
aggression is a disease that is sometimes not curable. Have your dog 
neutered — most dogs involved in attacks are young, unneutered males — 
and follow the expert’s advice. But if, in the end, you have a dog who still 
cannot be trusted, have him euthanized. It’s upsetting, but this course is the 
only responsible one to take. If your dog is aggressive, he’ll probably end up 
euthanized eventually. The difference is that if you wait, someone will get 
hurt first.
 
Finding an aggressive dog a new home — one with no children, perhaps — is 
not the answer. Children are everywhere, and you may be responsible for 
one of them being hurt if you pass a problem dog on to someone else — 
especially if you do so without admitting the real reason you’re finding him 
a new home, knowing that no one wants to adopt a biter. You do the dog no 
kindness, and you put the new family at risk.
Maybe you prefer to live in a state of denial, hoping nothing awful involving 
your dog will ever happen. More than 4.5 million American dog owners are 
jolted into reality every year — 4.5 million being the number of bites estimated 
by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children are the most 
frequent victims.
Need more reasons to act? You could lose your homeowners insurance — or 
more. U.S. insurance companies shell out more than $1 billion a year to settle 
dog-bite liability claims. The companies say claims are rising in both number 
and value. Even one “minor” bite claim could cost you your homeowners 
insurance — and a vicious attack could cost you a lot more than that.
Aggressive behavior never improves on its own. It only gets worse. So get 
help — now.

Developing the Right Attitude 
toward Training
If you don’t have an aggressive dog, consider yourself lucky. Chances are, 
though, you probably have a dog who’s a little out of control: one who drives 
you just a little bit crazy, and a canine adolescent, more often than not. You’ve 
given up waiting for her to outgrow her bad behavior — they never do! — and 
figure it’s finally time to . . . (big sigh) . . . train her. You’re thinking that you can’t 
avoid training; it just has to be done, like cleaning leaves out of the rain gutters.
Stop!
Now consider the following: If you have a bad attitude toward training, so will 
your dog. If you think training is a joyless chore, she’ll hate every minute of 
it. If you walk around jerking on her collar and swearing, she’ll wonder what 
she’s done to deserve your anger, and she’ll be too busy worrying about that 
to learn anything.
 
Expect success from her and be willing to work for it. Praise her not only 
for succeeding, but also for trying. Learning is hard for her — and stressful. 
Think of your dog as a person who has just moved to your house from a 
country where the language and customs are different — a trans-species 
exchange student. After all, she was born a dog, and you’re asking her to live 
as a member of a human family. You’re asking her to learn the language and 
follow the rules. The fact that this feat is ever accomplished is nothing less 
than a miracle. So celebrate it with her.
Consider dog training not as a mechanical thing — if you do X, your dog 
does Y — but rather as something organic, alive, interconnected, and ever 
changing. A well-mannered dog becomes that way from the inside out. “Sit” 
and “Stay” are the least of it, really, and are only the visible manifestations of 
what that dog is on the inside: a confident, comfortable, and secure member 
of a loving human pack. That dog is, quite simply, a joy to live with.
 
We all get cranky sometimes. If you’ve had a horrid day at work, you’ve had a 
fight with your spouse, or the mechanic just told you the cost to fix your car is 
$2,700, you’re probably better off skipping any efforts at teaching your dog some-
thing new. Instead, use your dog to ease out of your funk: Play fetch or just hang 
out with her. Pet her while you watch TV — it’s good for your blood pressure.
Likewise, if you start a training session fine and feel yourself getting frustrated 
and angry, don’t push things. End on a positive note. Ask your dog for some-
thing you know she knows well and, when she does it, praise her. Then call it 
a day. If you can’t manage even that, just stop before you both get even more 
frustrated.
In either case, remember: Tomorrow is another day.

Keys to Success
Ask a person who has never owned or trained a dog to teach one to sit, and 
he can probably come up with a successful plan without any prompting. 
Hold the front end up and push the back end down while saying, “Sit.” The 
mechanics of training aren’t that hard to understand. But to get your dog to 
mind you consistently and happily, you need to know a little more.
Dog training is not getting through eight Thursday-night group classes for the 
training to be over, forever. The training is never over. You teach, and then 
you practice, in ever-more-challenging circumstances. You correct or ignore 
the behavior you don’t want. And you integrate your dog’s lessons into 
everyday life so that he never loses the lessons. Remember the French or 
Spanish you learned in high school? How good are you at it now? If you don’t 
use it, you lose it. The same is true of the skills you teach your dog.
After he knows the language, keep asking him to use it. Following are some 
tips that will help both of you.
Dog fight!
Anyone who has ever walked a dog has 
experienced that terrifying moment when a 
vicious, unleashed dog is intent on doing harm 
to your dog. It’s a dangerous situation, even for 
owners of big dogs; for small dogs, it could be 
a fatal encounter.
If you have a male dog, getting him neutered 
may help keep him out of fights. Even if your dog 
is a cupcake, one dominant unneutered male 
may take your dog’s very presence as an insult 
to his dominance. If your dog is neutered, this 
particular fight trigger is usually not an issue.
Always try to avoid dogs who appear 
aggressive — dogs with erect body stances 
instead of the relaxed, ears-back attitude of a 
dog coming over to play — but sometimes you 
can’t escape a dominant dog.
If the other dog’s owner is nearby, demand 
that he put his canine terrorist on leash. If he’s 
clueless enough to say “Mine’s friendly,” yell 
back “Mine’s not,” and make your demand 
again.
If a fight starts, stay out of it. You may be badly 
hurt. If you’re willing to risk a bite and another 
person can help, pull the dogs apart by their 
tails — not their collars! If you’re alone and 
there’s a hose nearby, hitting them in the chops 
with a high-volume water spray usually stops 
the action.
If your own dogs are constantly fighting, call 
a trainer or behaviorist to help you develop 
strategies to make it clear that you require your 
dogs to get along. Realize, however, that peace 
may never be possible, and you may have to 
find a new home for one of the dogs.

Be on the same team
Don’t think of training your dog as a you-versus-your-dog endeavor. Instead, 
think about the two of you being on the same team, albeit in different 
positions. Consider yourself the quarterback, if you like: You call the plays. 
Maybe you’ve noticed that quarterbacks don’t get very far without folks to 
follow those plays. Winning is a team effort.
Of course, your dog has to learn the plays first, and you’re the one to teach 
her. But this relationship is still not an adversarial one. You show your dog 
what she needs to learn, and you do so with love and respect, which your 
dog will return in kind.
To bring your dog onto your team and show her the plays you’ll be calling, 
you need to spend time with her. Bring her into your life. Let her sleep in 
your bedroom and practice her “Sits” in the kitchen. The more opportunities 
for interaction and practice you have, the faster and more reliably your dog 
will perform.
Be positive
This tip goes back to having the right attitude, of course, but it’s more than 
that. Rewards — treats and praise — that are well timed and appropriate are 
essential to your dog’s learning process. If all you ever do is tell your dog 
“no,” your relationship isn’t going to be a very good one. How would you like 
to work with a boss like that?
In particular, praise is cheap — free, in fact! — so use it a lot. Use praise 
when your dog tries to get it right. Use it more when your dog succeeds. Use 
it when your dog just pays attention to you, because as you’ll find out in a 
moment, that’s the first step in the training. You don’t have to be some 
gushing goof, but you do need to let your dog know when you’re proud 
of him.
Be fair with corrections
Make sure that your dog understands what you want before you correct her 
for not doing it. And let the punishment fit the crime.
A correction should not be a release of anger or a way to clear pent-up 
feelings by unloading them on your dog. Instead, a correction is another way 
to communicate with your dog, to foster in her a clear understanding of her 
place in your human pack. As such, a proper correction is another way to 
strengthen the bond between you and your pet.

389
 Chapter 2: Teaching Your Dog Manners
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
A correction can be the absence of praise, the denial of attention, or a sharp 
rebuke. Always ask yourself if you’re being fair before you give in to a desire 
to respond negatively toward your dog. A correction is one of many tools in 
the trainer’s kit; it’s not about anger or revenge. Use negative reinforcement 
selectively and always fairly — and never punish a dog for something she 
didn’t know was wrong.
Be consistent
How would you do in your job if your boss kept changing the names of your 
tasks or asked you to do two things at once? Or had different rules for 
different places and times? It would drive you nuts, wouldn’t it? Yet that’s 
exactly what people do to their dogs. Consider these points:
 
 Training consistency: When your dog knows a command and 
demonstrates that knowledge consistently, use that command the same 
way each time; never change its meaning. The most common example 
of inconsistency is probably saying “Sit down” to a dog when you really 
mean “Sit.” Now, you know that when someone says “Sit down” to you, 
it’s the same as saying “Sit.” But if you teach your dog “Sit” and “Down” 
as two separate commands, you can understand why it’s confusing. 
Which do you want? The same applies for saying “Down” when you 
really mean “Off” (more on this in a bit).
 
 Situational consistency: Some dogs start to recognize situations in 
which ordinary rules don’t apply. They learn, for example, that when 
you’re in a hurry, you’ll shrug off disobedience: You’re in a rush to feed 
your dog, for example, and when you say “Sit,” he doesn’t. You throw 
the food down anyway.
 
 If “Sit” doesn’t always mean “Sit,” eventually it will never mean “Sit.” 
Teach your dog that “Sit” means “Sit,” no matter where or when you 
request the behavior.
 
 Another kind of inconsistency is when you never expect your dog to 
mind until you’ve repeated the command a few times. After a dog knows 
a command, follow through in having him perform the behavior. Then 
praise him.
Build on your successes
Dog training succeeds by degrees and creativity. You continue to expand the 
length of time and the number of situations in which your dog will execute a 
command, and you look for new ways to use what she knows so you can 
continue to develop and strengthen the bond between you.

Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Build a little at a time, celebrating every step along the way. Living is 
learning, and learning is good.
Tools for Teaching
Dog training isn’t expensive, or it needn’t be. You need a leash, some treats, 
and a properly fitted collar, but your other tools are free for the asking. The 
trick is knowing what they are, how they work, and when to use them.
A 6-foot lead you can handle easily — leather or nylon, neither too wide nor 
too thin — is a must, as is a collar that is properly fitted and put on. Chapter 
6 in Book I introduces leashes and collars, if you need a refresher.
Some trainers recommend a slip-chain collar for training; others prefer a flat 
collar, a head halter, or even a prong collar. All these pieces of equipment 
are right for some dogs and some people in some training situations. Start 
with what’s easiest on you and the dog — a head halter or a flat collar — and 
focus on teaching, not forcing. Slip collars are often put on incorrectly — 
choking the dog,rather than correcting him — because the collars are 
difficult for most novice dog trainers to use properly. If you use a slip collar, 
you must attach the leash to the live ring and keep the chain loose except for 
the split second when it tightens and releases to correct your dog.
Getting your dog’s attention
You’re not going to be able to teach your dog anything if you can’t get her 
attention. One of the best ways to do so is to teach her to give you eye 
contact at your request. Eye contact is one of the most important areas of 
communication for dogs, and mastering eye contact, dog style, immediately 
strengthens your relationship.
 
Catch your dog’s eye by swooping your hand under her chin, bringing your 
fingers back up near your eyes while you make a clucking noise, and saying 
her name, followed by “Look” or “Watch.” The motion upward and the sound 
orient your dog’s eyes up so that she’s looking right into your own. When 
they lock in, hold for a split second, smile, and praise. This command may 
take time to learn, because dogs avoid eye contact to show respect. Build up 
your time until your dog gives and holds eye contact until you release her. 
Practice this command several times a day, and always be loving and 
encouraging.
As your dog learns to respect and trust you more, you’ll find that she looks 
at you more. She wants to see what you’re doing, because you’re where the 
action is.

391
 Chapter 2: Teaching Your Dog Manners
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
Some dogs get a little bit carried away with this devotion thing, to the point 
that it becomes a way of controlling you. If your dog is becoming an attention 
addict, give her something to do to earn your praise — ideally, a half-hour 
“Down-Stay” on the other side of the room (see Chapter 3 in Book IV). Think 
of this activity as tough love, if you will, but it’s better than spending the rest 
of your life unable to read your newspaper because your love-junkie dog is 
sticking her nose through it.
Your dog should know her name not as a command to go to you or as a 
swear word, but as a request for her attention. Praise her for looking at you 
when you use her name, and then build on that to help get her attention 
before giving a command. If you’re doing your eye-contact exercises, she’ll 
start looking at you at the sound of her name, before she even hears “Look.” 
Praise her! Eventually, you won’t even have to give the “Look” command. The 
sequence will be, “Luka (not yelled, but clear and encouraging) . . .” and then 
a slight pause, and then the command. Finish with praise, always.
On the cutting edge: Clicker training
One of the most exciting developments in 
dog training in recent years has been the 
widespread use of a little piece of plastic and 
metal known as a clicker (or sometimes a 
cricket). The clicker brings classic operant 
conditioning to dog training, and it first became 
known for training dolphins and whales for 
those popular shows at marine parks.
Consider the dolphin, if you will. You can’t put a 
leash on him, and he’s really too big — and too 
slippery — to force him into doing what you want 
to do. (Trying to wrestle in the water with an 
orca would be even harder — and dangerous, 
too!) So trainers had to come up with a way to 
communicate, to shape behavior in a nonphysical 
way. Enter the clicker.
Trainers — dog and dolphin alike — begin by 
associating the sound of the clicker with the 
reward: Fish, in the case of dolphins, and a 
dog treat for a canine pupil. Soon the animal 
understands that the clicker — which is easier 
to time properly than verbal praise — means 
that he did right and that he’s earned a reward. 
This technique is especially good for shaping 
complex behaviors — in the obedience ring, 
for example, where high-scoring dogs must not 
only sit, but sit square on their haunches and in 
proper position relative to their handlers to get 
a high score.
This level of precision is attained by shaping the 
behavior. The dog gets a click and treat for sit-
ting, and when that’s mastered, the trainer waits 
to click/treat until the dog offers a behavior 
that’s just a tiny bit closer to the goal, and then 
a tiny bit more, and so on. Soon the dog is being 
clicked/treated for the perfect position only.
If you have a click trainer in your area, take a 
class — you’ll enjoy it! If not, you can find the 
best selection of books on clicker training at the 
Dogwise Web site, www.dogwise.com.
You’ll definitely be hearing more about clicker 
training for dogs in the future, and more trainers 
will be switching to this novel way to train.

Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Giving praise
All praise is good, but praise specially tailored to connect with the dog’s way 
of reacting is ten times as effective. Consider these tips:
 
 Use the right tone of voice: Dogs communicate with one another 
through sounds easily duplicated by humans. If you’re angry with 
your dog, for example, dropping your voice to a low rumble closely 
approximates the growling of a dog. For praise, use a sweet, high-
pitched crooning voice: “Goooooooood, doooogggg. Aaaren’t youuuu a 
gooood doooog?”
 
 Tailor your petting style to your dog: Some dogs go crazy when petted; 
others hardly notice. Use a little chest pat or scratch for dogs who tend 
to be overly enthusiastic, and be a little more boisterous for the ones 
who really warm to being jollied. Don’t let the dog use petting as an 
excuse to go crazy — lighten up on the pats, but don’t correct him — 
and let your voice do most of the praising.
 
 Smile: Dogs understand many of our facial expressions because they 
use similar ones to communicate with each other. A smiling face is 
understood in both species, but if you really want to get through, make 
the smile as wide open as you can. You’re trying to approximate that 
big, panting grin a happy dog has. Panting is optional (but kind of fun).
Training with treats
What about using treats to train your dog? They’re a wonderful way to get 
through to your dog quickly, and probably the easiest way for beginning dog 
owners to train. Dog trainers have come a long way in developing training 
techniques by using food. Unfortunately, many people take away the wrong 
lesson: They come to believe in the treat not as a way to shape behavior, 
step by step — for which treats can work very well — but rather as the wages 
for obedience. Dog sits, dog gets a treat. Dog sits, dog gets a treat. And guess 
what happens? You end up with a dog who won’t pay attention to you if you 
aren’t in a position to pay the edible going rate.
And what about the relationship that’s supposed to be developing from the 
inside out, that special bond? It doesn’t. To your dog, you become a vending 
machine, not a leader. Food helps to form the bond with your dog — dogs 
quickly become attached to the person who feeds them, after all — but 
there’s more to developing a solid relationship.

393
 Chapter 2: Teaching Your Dog Manners
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
 
Treats are great for training — they’re especially useful for trick training, or 
for teaching any behavior that requires your dog to be in precise positions, 
such as behaviors demanded of top-level competitors in obedience trials. But 
they’re for training, not for life. You should not be carrying around a pocketful 
of treats to bribe your dog into doing what you want. Your dog needs to learn 
his proper place in your pack by using the commands without food after he 
learns them, or you’re not really teaching him much of anything. Vary his 
rewards — always praise, but don’t always treat after he’s learned the lesson. 
When you teach a dog to figure out that a particular behavior gets him what 
he wants (food and praise), and then put a word on it (the command word), 
you are truly teaching, and he is truly learning.
Maintaining control and giving correction
During training, you maintain control and offer correction, using both a collar 
and leash and your body to help guide your pet into correct position and to 
keep her from getting into wrong ones — such as a full-out gallop, heading 
away from you.
You also correct your dog with your voice, and you need to be sure that 
you’re using both your voice and your vocabulary properly. Maybe you don’t 
use the word “no” much because it’s so overused. Instead, you say “bad dog,” 
often preceded by a very loud and dramatic intake of air, like the shocked 
gasp you make involuntarily when you find that your dog has chewed your 
favorite shoes. Use a sharp, guttural, and dramatic word or sound. Throw the 
sound at your dog, like a rock.
 
Put the emphasis on the correction word, not on your dog’s name, to which 
there should never be any negative connotations.
Using a release word
You need a word to let your dog know he is done with the command you gave 
him. Probably the most common in use is “Okay.” “Release” is another fine 
one, as is the one the sheepdog people use at trials: “That’ll do.” It sounds 
very gracious. Whatever you use, be sure that you’re consistent in its use.
Your release word can mean more than the end of an exercise, such as 
allowing your dog to move about at the end of a “Stay” command. The release 
word is also a sort of an all-purpose “at ease” word. For example, if your dog 
is heeling along at your side, staying out of trouble on a crowded sidewalk, 
you can use your release word to let him know that doing a little sniffing is 
fine, and maybe a little leg-lifting, too.

Using a Crate: A Playpen for Your Puppy
 
To speed the process of training, we strongly recommend that you use a 
crate or similar means of confinement from the time your dog is a puppy.
Initially, you may recoil from this concept as cruel and inhumane. Nothing 
could be farther from the truth. You’ll discover that your puppy likes her 
crate and that you can enjoy your peace of mind. Think of a crate as a dog’s 
playpen.
The proof is in the pudding: Dogs like crates. A crate reminds them of a 
den — a place of comfort, safety, security, and warmth (see Figure 2-1.) 
Puppies, and many adult dogs, sleep most of the day, and many prefer the 
comfort of their den. For your mental health, as well as that of your puppy, 
get a crate.
 
Figure 2-1: 
In addition 
to helping 
with house-
training, a 
crate is a 
comfy den 
for your dog.
 
Crate-training your dog offers many advantages. Consider just a few:
 
 A crate is a babysitter — when you’re busy and can’t keep an eye on 
your dog, but you want to make sure that she doesn’t get into trouble, 
put her in her crate. You can relax, and so can she.

395
 Chapter 2: Teaching Your Dog Manners
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
 
 Using a crate is ideal for getting her on a schedule for housetraining.
 
 Few dogs are fortunate enough to go through life without ever having to 
be hospitalized. Your dog’s private room at the veterinary hospital will 
consist of a crate. Her first experience with a crate shouldn’t come at a 
time when she’s sick — the added stress from being crated for the first 
time can retard her recovery.
 
 A crate is especially helpful when you have to keep your dog quiet, such 
as after being altered or after an injury.
 
 Driving any distance, even around the block, with your dog loose in the 
car is tempting fate. Stop suddenly, and who knows what could happen? 
Having the dog in a crate protects you and your dog.
 
 When you go on vacation, you may take your dog. Her crate is her home 
away from home, and you can leave her in a hotel room knowing she 
won’t be unhappy or stressed, and she won’t tear up the room. (See the 
section “Traveling with Your Dog” later in this chapter for more on dogs 
and travel.)
 
 A crate is a place where she can get away from the hustle and bustle of 
family life and hide out when humans become too much for her.
 
A crate provides a dog with her own special place. It’s cozy, secure, and her 
place to get away from it all. Make sure that your dog’s crate is available to 
her when she wants to nap or take some time out. She’ll use it on her own, 
so make sure that she always has access to it. Depending on where it is, your 
dog will spend much of her sleeping time in her crate.
Finding the right crate
Select a crate that’s large enough for your dog to turn around, stand up, or lie 
down comfortably. If he’s a puppy, get a crate for the adult-size dog so that 
he can grow into it.
Some crates are better than others in strength and ease of assembly. You can 
get crates in wire mesh–type material, cloth mesh, or plastic (called airline 
crates). Most are designed for portability and are easy to assemble. Wire-
mesh crates are easy to collapse, although they’re heavier than crates made 
of cloth mesh or plastic.
 
If you frequently take your dog with you in the car, consider getting two 
crates, one for the house and one for the car. Doing so saves you from having 
to lug one back and forth.

Coaxing your dog into the crate
 
To coax your dog into the crate, use these helpful hints:
 
1. Set up the crate and let your dog investigate it.
 
 Put a crate pad, doggie bed, or blanket in the crate.
 
2. Say a command, such as “Crate” or “Go to bed.”
 
 If your puppy isn’t lured in, physically place her in the crate, using the 
command you’ve chosen.
 
3. Close the door, tell her what a great puppy she is, give her a bite-sized 
treat, and then let her out.
 
 There’s no rule against gentle persuasion to get your pup enthused 
about her crate.
 
4. Use a treat to coax her into the crate.
 
 If she doesn’t follow the treat, physically place her in the crate and then 
give her the treat.
 
5. Again, close the door, tell her what a great puppy she is, and give her 
a bite-sized treat.
 
6. Let her out.
 
 The treat doesn’t have to be a dog biscuit, as long as it’s an object the 
dog will actively work for.
 
7. Continue using the command and giving your dog a treat when she’s 
in the crate until she goes into the crate with almost no help from you.
 
For the puppy who’s afraid of the crate, use her meals to overcome her fear. 
First, let her eat her meal in front of the crate; then place the next meal just 
inside the crate. Put each successive meal a little farther into the crate until 
she’s completely inside and no longer reluctant to enter.
Helping your dog get used to the crate
Tell your dog to go into the crate, give him a treat, close the door, tell him 
what a good puppy he is, and then let him out again. Each time you do this, 
leave him in the crate a little longer with the door closed, still giving him a 
treat and telling him how great he is.
Finally, put him in his crate, give him a treat, and then leave the room — first 
for 1 minute; then 5 minutes; then 10 minutes; then 15 minutes, and so on. 
Each time you return to let him out, tell him how good he was before you 
open the door.

397
 Chapter 2: Teaching Your Dog Manners
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
How long can you ultimately leave your dog in his crate unattended? That 
depends on your dog and your schedule, but for an adult dog, don’t let it be 
more than eight hours.
 
Never use your dog’s crate as a form of punishment. If you do, he’ll begin to 
dislike the crate and it will lose its usefulness to you. You don’t want him to 
develop negative feelings about his crate. You want him to like his private 
den.
Great Things They Don’t Teach 
in Obedience Class
The lessons you can teach your dog have no end. This section gives you a 
taste of a few off-the-beaten-path lessons you can teach your dog.
 
Don’t let your mind stop because a trainer’s — or author’s — suggestions 
do. After reading this chapter and the next, you’ll know how to train a dog, 
so build on your own success. If you have something you want to teach your 
dog, give the behavior a name and do it!
Wait
This command is different from Stay because the dog is not required to hold 
a position — she just can’t cross an imaginary line until the time of your 
choosing. To teach this command, position your dog in a doorway, call her 
name, say “Wait,” and draw your hand, palm out, from frame to frame in front 
of her eyes. Walk back into the room and allow her to move around, and then 
step back out. If she follows across the imaginary line, give a voice correction 
and repeat the command and hand signal. Praise her and give her a treat 
for staying on the other side of the line; then release her to more praise and 
treats.
This command has many uses, such as when you open the car door and you 
don’t want your dog to jump out into traffic, and before you and your dog 
enter people’s homes or leave your own.
Go to Your Bed
The command Go to Your Bed means “Go there and plant it, pal” and is a 
great command for getting your dog out from underfoot. Call your dog’s 
name, tell him “Go to your bed,” lead him there, and tell him “Down.” With 
practice — and consistency — the Down part becomes automatic.

Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Off
“Off” is what people often mean when they say “Down”: “I want all four of 
your paws on the floor, now.” Off is not a punishment: It’s a command. If your 
dog’s on the couch or the bed without an invitation, take her by the collar, 
say “Off,” and then lead her down and praise. The same applies with the 
jumping dog, although then the command is best taught with a leash and slip 
collar. Say “Off,” then use the leash in a downward motion until those feet hit 
the ground, say “Sit,” and offer praise. (See Chapter 3 in Book IV for details.)
Don’t Touch or Leave It
Teach this command with a physical correction from the get-go. With your 
dog in a Sit-Stay and your hand in a fist, flat surface up, offer your dog a 
biscuit with the other. As he reaches for the biscuit, say “Don’t touch,” and 
bop him gently under the chin, enough to close his jaw but not lift him off 
his feet. Offer the biscuit again, repeating “Don’t touch,” and if he hesitates 
or turns away, praise him. Few dogs need this command demonstrated more 
than twice.
 
This command is another one with many useful applications. A dog leads 
with his nose, after all, and a dog who knows Don’t Touch isn’t going to head 
in a direction you don’t want him to go in. Use this command when you’re 
walking and he dives for some dreadful leftovers in a fast-food bag. Use it 
to keep him from lifting his leg where you don’t want him to on walks — 
because the sniff is the prelude to the leg-lift, this command works well. If 
you drop your sandwich in front of him, saying “Don’t touch” ensures that 
you get to finish it — assuming you still want to, of course.
Fetch
For many dogs, retrieving is the easiest command to teach. They’re retrievers: 
They were born with the desire to retrieve. You throw something, they bring 
it back. That’s the way they’re wired.
For other dogs, such as Rhodesian Ridgebacks, who were bred to hunt lions, 
which are hard to fetch, you throw something and they look at you as if to 
say, “Well, you obviously didn’t want it, because you threw it away. Surely 
you don’t expect me to do something about it. Fetch? You must be kidding!”

 Chapter 2: Teaching Your Dog Manners
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
It’s worth trying to teach your dog to retrieve, if only because it’s the world’s 
best way to get your dog the exercise she needs without you having to exert 
all that much time or energy. You don’t have to jog — you can just throw.
 
If your dog isn’t a natural-born retriever, realize that you must be very 
patient, and be content with small advances. The dog who first makes even 
the tiniest move forward to take an object on command has made a huge 
achievement. Recognize it, and build on your successes. Don’t lose patience.
 
Before you start, go to pet supply store and get a dumbbell — a wooden or 
plastic retrieving tool that’s a dowel with wide pieces on both ends to help 
keep it from slipping out of your dog’s mouth. Dumbbells come in various 
sizes and weights; pick one wide enough for your dog to get her mouth on the 
dowel part comfortably, without being squeezed by the side pieces.
Several different methods exist for teaching fetch, including ones that involve 
force. For most people, a positive, patient approach works fine. Remember, 
think short, upbeat sessions in small increments, and offer lots of praise and 
treats. Work at your dog’s own pace, and don’t rush to the next level.
Start by teaching the dog to open her mouth. Say “Take it” and offer a treat. 
After your dog is opening her mouth in expectation when she hears you say 
“Take it,” slip the dumbbell inside for a second. Praise her and offer her a 
treat. Try this sequence a few more times, and then end the lesson.
After your dog is accepting the dumbbell, put it in her mouth and say “Hold 
it” while you gently hold her mouth around the dumbbell for three or four 
seconds. Then tell her “Give” and let her spit out the dumbbell. Treat and 
praise.
The next step is to hold the dumbbell just in front of the dog’s mouth and say 
“Take it.” If you need to pull her head toward the dumbbell with the collar, 
that’s fine. If she moves forward on her own, even better. Treat and praise.
From that point, it’s a matter of building the distance slowly, lesson by 
lesson. One foot, 2 feet; then picking it up from the floor; then picking it up 
from the floor 3 feet away, and so on. You should be working separately on 
practicing the Hold It and Give commands, as well as the Come command 
described earlier in this chapter and detailed in the next chapter.
 
Fetching isn’t just one skill: It’s a combination of skills. Taking the object 
is one part of it. Holding the object is another, and so is bringing it to you. 
Releasing the object on your Give It command is the final part. Each piece 
must be taught, and then merged into a seamless behavior. Some dogs put 
it all together quickly and naturally; other dogs don’t. But if you work slowly 
and patiently, your dog will learn.

Traveling with Your Dog
It’s one thing if your dog behaves at home under your supervision. It’s quite 
another out in the wide world. Although dogs aren’t as complicated to travel 
with as, say, babies, you do have to pick up and work out a few things in 
advance of any trip.
The well-equipped travel dog
You can really go crazy packing things to ensure your dog’s safety and 
comfort. What should you bring? First, some basics.
 
 Your dog should be wearing a sturdy collar with a license and an up-
to-date ID tag with at least one number, area code included, that’s not 
yours — someone who’ll be there to answer the phone if you lose your 
dog miles from home.
 
 If your dog is more comfortable in a harness, put the tag on that, but 
remember, a harness isn’t a good option for a dog who doesn’t behave 
well on leash, because you have less control with a harness.
 
 Ideally, your pet should also be “chipped” — see Chapter 3 in Book II for 
details.
 
 Bring along a 6-foot leash. A longer leash is handy, too, especially a 
reel-type leash such as the Flexi, which is great for giving your dog a 
little room to stretch his legs in areas such as rest stops. Think about 
bringing an extra leash, as well as a nylon, one-piece slip lead like the 
ones veterinary hospitals and kennel operators use. Keep it in your 
glove box.
 
 Pack two bowls: one for food, one for water.
 
 Water bowls that either collapse for easy storage or don’t spill are 
perfect for travel. Keep a collapsible bowl in your car trunk, along with a 
bottle of water.
 
 If your dog eats a widely available brand of food, pack enough to get 
you started and pick up the rest on the road, if you’re going to an area 
with a market or pet supply store. If your dog eats prescription food or 
anything out of the ordinary, bring enough for the trip. If your pet eats 
canned food, you need a spoon or fork and a can opener, unless your 
pup’s brand comes in pop-tops.
 
 Don’t forget some treats!
 
 A comb, brush, and tweezers or ready-made device for pulling ticks 
come in handy, especially on back-country trips.

401
 Chapter 2: Teaching Your Dog Manners
Book IV

Agility, and 
Shows
 
 Some basic first-aid supplies — scissors, gauze, tape, and Pepto-Bismol, 
for diarrhea — are handy to have around. Your veterinarian can prescribe 
some motion-sickness medication, if need be, and you certainly want to 
pack that.
 
 Don’t forget to pack any regular medication your pet takes.
 
 Bring cloth towels, for drying off wet, dirty dogs, and paper towels for 
cleaning up more things than you can imagine. You may want to pack an 
old sheet and blanket, for covering bedspreads, furniture, and carpets in 
hotel rooms, and perhaps a multipurpose cleaner in a spray bottle. 
 
 Plastic bags are a must-bring, too, for poop pick-ups.
 
 Bring dog shampoo. Trying to find shampoo at 10 p.m. in a resort town 
after your dog has rolled in something vile will convince you of this 
necessity.
 
 For owners of little dogs only: A shoulder bag for carrying your pet. With 
this tote — or any oversized bag — you can slip your dog into areas 
the big dogs can only dream of, and most of the people around you will 
never notice.
 
 Don’t forget your pet’s health records, including microchip number, 
and especially proof of rabies vaccination. The latter is absolutely 
imperative if the unthinkable happens and your dog bites someone or 
tangles with a rabid creature in the wild.
 
 Last, but certainly not least, from your dog’s point of view: a couple of 
his favorite toys.
The standard travel advice has been to bring water from home, but that’s 
just unfeasible for a trip of any decent length. Your dog will be fine drinking 
the same water you do in unfamiliar places. That said, bring a couple gallons 
of bottled water, from either the tap or the store, because you may stop to 
water and walk your dogs in areas where a source of safe drinking water isn’t 
readily available.
The well-prepared dog lover
As with anything else, the key for traveling with a dog is to prepare for the 
worst, hope for the best. Carry some ready-made LOST DOG! flyers with your 
dog’s picture on them and a place to write a phone number with a big marker 
(which you should also pack). (More on preparing these flyers is in Chapter 3 
in Book II.)
Find a directory of pet-friendly lodgings. Some travel guides, such as AAA, 
mention whether pets are accepted, but calling ahead is always a good idea: 
Policies and ownership can change, after all.

402
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
A good dog travel book is Maria Goodavage’s The California Dog Lover’s 
Companion (Avalon Travel Publishing). If you live in or are planning to visit 
California, this book is a must-buy. Others in the series are just as wonderful.
As with so many other things, the Internet has changed travel, and that’s just 
as true of travel with dogs. Search the Web for “pet-friendly travel” or “pet-
friendly lodging” and be prepared for an onslaught of options.
Travel by car
Given the worries most pet lovers have about air travel, it’s no wonder that 
most doggie vacations are conducted in the family car. When they understand 
that car rides end up in exciting places like the beach, most dogs greet the 
prospect of a car ride with unabashed enthusiasm — a little too much, for 
some drivers.
Making car rides safer
 
As with all other training, ending up with a good car rider starts with 
molding correct behavior when your dog is a puppy. No matter how cute or 
how small, do not allow your pup to ride in your lap, and don’t make a fuss 
over her while you’re driving. On short neighborhood trips, ask your pup to 
sit quietly, and praise her for proper behavior.
Traveling with your dog in a crate is often easier and definitely safer. 
Depending on the size of your dog and the size and shape of your car, a crate 
may not be feasible. Do consider using a crate, though, especially if your dog 
is active enough to distract the driver. Collapsible crates are available for 
easy storage in the trunk when not in use.
Another safety tool is a doggy seat belt, which fits into a standard seat-belt 
buckle and then attaches to a harness on the dog. If you have a station wagon 
or similar vehicle, widely available metal barriers fit between the passenger 
and cargo areas, to keep your pet in her place. You can find these devices in 
pet stores.
Uneasy riders
If your dog’s only exposure to riding in a car is an occasional trip to the 
veterinarian, don’t be surprised if he’s not the happiest of riders. Try to build 
up his enthusiasm by increasing his time in the car and praising him for his 
good behavior. The first short trips should be to pleasant locations, such as 
parks.

 Chapter 2: Teaching Your Dog Manners

Dramamine prevents car sickness in dogs as well as people, but other 
remedies are available — talk to your veterinarian. A dog-handler’s trick: 
Your dog should travel on little or no food, and the dog should get a jelly 
bean — or any other piece of sugar candy, except chocolate — before hitting 
the road.
Because most of the problems stem from fear, not motion sickness, building 
up your pet’s tolerance for riding in a car is a better long-term cure than 
anything you can give him. Although fresh air is wonderful, don’t let your pet 
hang his head out of the window. Small debris kicked up by other cars can 
strike him in the eye or nose and injure him. Roll down the window enough 
for a sniff, if you like — but no more.
On the road, remember to stop at regular intervals — about as often as you 
need to for yourself — for your dog to relieve himself and get a drink of fresh 
water. Remember to always keep your dog on a leash, for his safety.
 
When you’re on the road, if you want to spend a few hours kicking around an 
area where dogs are not welcome, a local veterinary clinic is a safe place to 
leave your dog. You can usually manage to find one amenable to a short-term 
boarder within a couple calls, and you’ll know your dog is in safe and 
secure surroundings while you’re not with him. The price for this service is 
negotiable — a half-day’s boarding is a good starting point.
 
Although leaving a dog loose in a hotel room is not a good idea — most 
places forbid doing so, in fact — you can leave a crated dog alone, provided 
he’s not a barker. Just another reason why a crate is one of the most versatile 
pieces of canine equipment your dog can have.
Hot dog
Just about everyone understands that dogs 
shouldn’t be left inside a car on a hot day, but 
fewer realize that the danger is just as great 
on a warm one. It’s a horrible way to die. A car 
functions similarly to a greenhouse, and heat 
can build up to lethal levels in minutes, even on 
a pleasant day in the 70s or low 80s. Even with 
the windows rolled down, a dog can show signs 
of heat stress — heavy panting, glazed eyes, 
rapid pulse, dizziness or vomiting, or a deep red 
or purple tongue — in the time it takes you to 
get a six-pack through the Ten Items or Less 
line. Brain damage and death can follow within 
minutes.
An overheated dog needs prompt veterinary 
attention to have a chance of survival. Don’t 
delay! Better yet, don’t risk your dog’s life 
by leaving him in the car. Another danger 
to the unattended dog is theft, which, when 
combined with heat dangers, means a few 
minutes looking through that cute little shop 
really isn’t worth the risk posed to your pet.

404
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Travel by air
If you don’t take your dog by car in the United States, air is your only other 
option. The major bus lines and Amtrak don’t allow any animals except dogs 
serving the disabled. Other countries are far more liberal on this point — 
dogs are welcome in restaurants, too, in some places — but it’s still hit and 
miss.
Although horror stories make the news, the truth is that airline travel is 
relatively safe for most dogs, and it will be for yours if you play by the rules, 
plan carefully, and are prepared to be a little pushy on your pet’s behalf.
Animals move through the airline system in two ways: as cargo or as 
accompanied baggage. Most animals travel in a pressurized cargo hold 
beneath the passenger compartment. Although the accommodations aren’t 
any nicer, it’s better for your pet if she is traveling as your “baggage” so you 
can ask about her in person.
Some airlines allow small dogs in the cabin, if their carriers can fit in the 
space beneath the seat. This is by far the best way your dog can fly, because 
she never leaves your care during the course of the trip. Not all airlines allow 
dogs to travel in the cabin, however, and others put a limit on the number of 
dogs in the cabin, so making your arrangements far in advance pays.
The only larger dogs allowed in the cabin are service dogs traveling with a 
disabled person.
The Air Transport Association estimates that more than a half a million dogs 
and cats are transported on commercial airlines in the United States each 
year, and the industry group insists 99 percent reach their destination 
without incident.
To make sure that your dog is one of them, talk to the airline. Some carriers — 
especially the no-frills companies — don’t take animals at all. Even the 
carriers that do have limits to the number of animals on a flight because a set 
amount of air is available in the sealed cargo holds. You also need to know 
where and when your dog has to be presented, and what papers — health 
certificate and so on — you need to bring.

Also consider these tips when flying with your dog:
 
 Be sure that your dog is in good health and isn’t one of the pug-nosed 
breeds. These dogs find breathing a little difficult under the best of 
circumstances, and the stress of airline travel may be more than they 
can handle.
 
 Make sure that your dog is traveling in a proper carrier (crate) that 
has contact phone numbers at both ends of the journey. (Your home 
number won’t help if you’re not home.) The crate should be just big 
enough for your dog to stand up and turn around in. Be sure that all the 
bolts securing the halves of the carriers are in place and tightened.
 
 Although your dog shouldn’t wear a collar in her crate — it’s not safe, 
because it can get caught on other objects — put an ID tag on a piece of 
elastic around her neck; in addition, you may want to consider having 
her microchipped before travel.
 
 Don’t ship your pet when the weather is bad or when air traffic is 
heaviest. Avoid peak travel days such as around the Christmas holidays, 
and choose flights that are on the ground when the temperature is 
neither too hot nor too cold, not only at the departure airport, but also 
at the connecting and arriving airports. In summer, a night flight is likely 
better, whereas the reverse is true in the winter. Many airlines have 
their own temperature restrictions.
 
 Fly with your dog whenever possible. Keeping on top of things is easier 
when you’re on the same flight.
 
 Choose a direct flight; if that’s not possible, try for a route with a short 
layover. Most canine fatalities occur on the ground, when dogs are left 
in their crates on the hot tarmac or in stifling cargo holds. Direct flights 
eliminate layovers, and short layovers reduce the time on the ground.
 
 Remember, your dog’s life relies on the attentiveness of airline personnel. 
Most of these employees are excellent and caring, but mistakes do 
happen. Be prepared to pester airline personnel to confirm that your 
dog has been loaded and has made the same connections you have. If 
your pet is flying unaccompanied, talk to freight-handling personnel at 
every airport your dog will visit. Be polite but persistent; don’t take “I’m 
sure she’s fine — have some delicious honey-roasted peanuts” as an 
answer from a flight attendant. Make the staff check and report back.

406
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
Contrary to popular belief, it’s generally better not to tranquilize your dog 
before flying. The combination of high altitude and limited oxygen is a 
challenge that your pet’s body is better prepared to meet if she’s not 
sedated. Still, your pet may be an exception. In the end, you and your 
veterinarian should decide on this issue.
Dog-friendly vacations
Just as vacations with children are different from adults-only trips, traveling 
with your dog works out better if you plan the journey with an eye to finding 
places where dogs not only are welcome but are also able to enjoy the 
surroundings.
A piece of doggie heaven
It used to be that dog lovers were happy just to 
find lodgings that accepted dogs. How things 
have changed — some vacation options today 
are designed with dogs first in mind. These 
doggie vacations take two forms: Dog resorts 
with planned activities, and dog resorts without.
Places with planned activities are known 
as dog camps. The organizers rent a camp-
ground, school campus, or similar location for 
part of the year and bring in trainers, lecturers, 
and other experts to teach campers and their 
human companions about various dog sports. 
Dog camps leave plenty of time for hiking, fetch, 
silly games, and just plain hanging out with 
other dogs.
Camp Gone To The Dogs is the prototype and 
still a place many dogs and dog lovers dream 
of visiting someday. Honey Loring puts the 
camp together every year, offering everything 
possible to keep human and canine guests 
deliriously happy. For information, check out 
the Web site at www.camp-gone-tothe-
dogs.com.
The other kind of dog resort is typified by 
the strangely named Sheep Dung Estates in 
Northern California. Sheep Dung’s cabin’s are 
dog friendly to the maximum extent possible, 
with tile floors and easy-to-clean furnishings. 
And each cabin is set in a private setting away 
from the others, so staying at Sheep Dung is like 
having your own ranch — your dog can be off 
leash the entire stay. For more information, visit 
www.sheepdung.com.
While Camp Gone to The Dogs and Sheep 
Dung Estates are definitely pioneers, their trail-
blazing efforts have not gone unnoticed by 
others in the travel industry. Similar businesses 
have followed the great example set by these 
dog-friendly operations — and the trend is sure 
to grow.

In general, you’ll want to emphasize the outdoors. But as you’ll soon find 
in traveling with your dog, not all parks and beaches are the same. In some 
cities and towns, dogs aren’t even allowed in municipal facilities; in other 
open areas, too many humans may make things tough for dogs.
Even camping can be a disappointment. The U.S.’s national parks aren’t much 
fun for dogs, but national forests are. The difference: The crowded national 
parks — such as Yosemite — have strict leash laws and require dogs to stay 
off most trails. National forests, on the other hand, have wide open spaces 
with few people and fewer leashing requirements — although that doesn’t 
relieve you of the responsibility for your dog’s poor behavior. Requirements 
in other parks vary, so check them out in advance.
You may prefer to stay in lodgings where dogs aren’t just tolerated — they’re 
welcomed. The owners of dog-friendly inns and hotels are often dog lovers, 
and they’re happy to give you clues on the best activities in the area. A less-
popular resort area is almost always more laid back and tolerant where dogs 
are concerned.
Ruffing it
Some people spend their vacation not in some 
fancy resort, but in the great outdoors — 
and they want to take their dogs with them. 
Fortunately, sturdy, well-designed packs are 
on the market, designed to let your dog carry 
his share of the load and even some of yours. 
An adult dog in top condition can carry up to 
a quarter of his weight, evenly distributed in a 
properly fitting pack. Get your dog used to the 
feel of the pack on short walks and trips, and 
gradually build up the weight and distance.
Dogs aren’t welcome everywhere, and the 
biggest danger to the future of canine back-
packing is other hikers more than wild beasts. 
Don’t give the dog haters any ammunition: 
Keep your dog under control, and that means 
on-leash in areas with other people or animals. 
Take either tools to bury waste or supplies to 
pack it back out.
You don’t need to take much into the back 
country — food and water are the basics — 
but you do need a few extra things. Grooming 
tools — a brush or comb, and tweezers or a 
tick remover — keep your pet healthy and 
comfortable. Also include basic first-aid 
supplies for human and canine packers, and 
bring a light rope for tethering your dog when 
necessary.
Charlene G. LaBelle’s A Guide to Backpacking 
With Your Dog (Alpine) is an outstanding book 
that offers invaluable tips on how to train and 
equip your dog, and where to take him. 

408
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Whatever you do, call ahead! Even the most dog-friendly places may have 
only a couple rooms available for dog lovers, and if these accommodations 
are in popular resorts areas, they can be booked months in advance for 
prime vacation weekends. Better still, plan for an off-season vacation (and 
still call ahead).
Getting past “no dogs allowed” — 
it’s possible
If you travel with your dog a lot, a time will come when you’ll be stranded 
somewhere you weren’t counting on — because of a car problem, perhaps — 
and you’ll be trying to find a place to stay. You may be able to convince some 
hotels to let the rules slide. Consider some tips:
 
 Offer a deposit. If you’re confident that your dog won’t cause any 
damage — and if you aren’t, you shouldn’t be traveling with him — put 
your money where your mouth is and offer to guarantee your pet’s good 
behavior.
 
 Show off your dog’s good manners and well-groomed appearance. 
Obviously, this plan is not a good one for someone with a muddy, out-of-
control, 125-pound shedding machine. But if your dog is clean and well 
behaved, show him off.
 
 Show the manager your crate. A dog who will sleep in a crate and not be 
left to his own devices is a much better risk for the manager to take.
If you’re going to sneak a dog into a hotel room — and who would ever 
suggest such a thing? — it probably works best if your room is far from the 
office and you’re prepared to sleep in your car, just in case. If you’re planning 
to have your dog sleep in your car, you’d better be with him: Leaving your 
pet unattended is never a good idea.
Keeping the world safe for 
canine travelers
Even though more people than ever are traveling with their dogs, plenty of 
people out there still don’t like sharing their space with the four-legged 
tourist.

You can see how the decisions to ban dogs get made. Liability concerns arise 
over dog bites and sanitation worries emerge over dog mess. But our job as 
caring, responsible dog lovers is to make sure people realize that more good 
dogs are around than bad ones. Remember a few pointers while on the road:
 
 Keep ’em clean. Your dog needs to be well groomed and clean smelling. 
Always dry off wet dogs and wipe off muddy feet — using your towels, 
not the hotel’s — before allowing your dog inside. Cover furniture, 
carpets, and bedspreads with your old sheets and towels, and if you 
need to bathe your dog, be sure, again, to use your towels and to clean 
up all the fur.
 
 Keep ’em under control. Your dog should be obedient, friendly but not 
annoying, and never aggressive — to people, pets, or wildlife. Do not 
allow your dog to bark uncontrolled in a car, camper, or hotel room. Use 
your best judgment on when to let a dog off-leash — even in areas where 
doing so is allowed — and be sure that your dog isn’t annoying other 
people or dogs.
 
 Pick up after ’em. Isn’t it astonishing that well-mannered people who 
would never consider tossing a soft-drink cup on the ground will look 
the other way when their dog deposits something 5,000 times more vile? 
That “it’s biodegradable” excuse doesn’t wash, either. Pick up after your 
dog. Dog mess is the single biggest complaint dog haters have against 
our being in public areas, so don’t give them any ammunition. When you 
check into a hotel, stress that you intend to pick up after your dog, and 
inquire if they have a place where they prefer you take her to relieve 
herself. Don’t let a male dog lift his leg on the shrubs while you’re 
walking there, either.

O
ne question almost every dog owner asks is, “How do I keep my dog 
from jumping up on people?” Dogs jump on people as a form of greeting, 
like saying, “Hello, nice to meet you!”
Dogs perceive jumping on people as a friendly gesture, a dog’s way of letting 
the object of his affection know how happy he is to see him. He’s literally 
jumping for joy. You can train your dog to greet people in a less rambunctious 
fashion, but you don’t want to punish your happy pet simply because he’s 
glad to see you.
Perhaps even more annoying is the dog’s habit of sniffing parts of our anatomy 
we prefer he didn’t. Although this behavior may be normal for the dog — he 
uses his nose to identify the rank, gender, and age of other dogs 
he meets — you need to insist that he get this information from people in a 
less-intrusive way.
So how do you get him to stop these behaviors without dampening his 
enthusiasm? By teaching Sit and Stay on command. Your dog can’t jump on 
you when he’s sitting — the two behaviors are mutually exclusive.
You also need to teach a release word to let him know that he can move 
again after you’ve told him to stay. If you don’t release him from the command 
after a reasonable period of time, he’ll release himself, and the length of time 
he stays will become shorter and shorter. The recommended release word is 
Okay, meaning “You can move now.” Another common release word is Free.

The First Step: Leash Training Your Dog
Most dogs readily accept the leash. Some dogs, especially puppies, need a 
little time to get used to it. If your dog hasn’t already been leash trained, you 
need to do it now.
Slip a correctly sized gentle leader — a head collar that controls your dog 
by her head, not her neck — or a chain training collar over your dog’s head, 
attach a standard 6-foot leash to the dead ring on it (the one that doesn’t 
move), and let her drag it around (see Chapter 6 in Book I for information on 
leashes and collars).
 
You must supervise your dog at all times so that she doesn’t get tangled 
up. Never leave a dog alone with a training collar on. In fact, if you’re not 
comfortable using a “choke” or training collar, you can try this method 
by attaching the leash to the dog’s regular collar. More vets seem to be 
recommending against training collars these days. Others maintain that they 
are useful.
Do this over a period of a few days. After she ignores the leash, pick up the 
other end and follow her around. She’ll happily wander off wherever her 
fancy takes her.
You’re now ready to show her where you want her to go. First use a treat to 
entice her to follow you, and then gently guide her with the leash, telling her 
what a good dog she is. If you’re teaching her outside, use the treat to coax 
her away from the house, and use the leash to guide her back toward the 
house. Before you know it, she’ll not only walk on the leash in your direction, 
but she’ll actually pull you along. (See the section “Born to pull” later in this 
chapter, to teach your dog not to pull.)
 
Puppies are sometimes reluctant to go away from the house, even for a treat. 
In that case, pick up your puppy, carry her away from the house, and then 
put her down; she’ll lead you back to the house.
Teaching the Basics
Of all the commands your dog will learn, he must know the following to be a 
good house pet and socially acceptable companion:
 
 Sit
 
 Stay

Sitting
The Sit and Stay is one of the simplest and yet most useful combination 
commands you can teach your dog. It gives you a wonderfully easy way to 
control him when you need to most. It’s also one of the most basic commands 
that you and your dog can quickly accomplish.
The importance of teaching your dog to sit and stay can’t be overemphasized. 
Not only will he stop jumping up on Grandma when she walks into the house, 
but when the door opens, he won’t run into the street.
 
Use the Sit and Stay command when you want your dog to remain quietly in 
one spot.
Getting your dog to sit — the easy part
Teaching your dog to sit on command is quite simple.
 
1. Show your dog a small, bite-sized treat, holding it just a little in front 
of his eyes, slightly over his head.
 
2. Say “Sit” as you bring your hand above his eyes.
 
 When your dog looks up at the treat, he should sit.
 
3. When he sits, give him the treat and tell him what a good dog he is.
 
 Tell him without petting him. If you pet him at the same time as you 
praise him, he’ll probably get up, but what you really want him to do is 
sit. Praising is verbal, such as saying “good” or “good dog” in a pleasant 
tone of voice. Rewarding is giving the dog a treat for a correct response 
while he’s still in position. For example, if your dog gets up after you told 
him to sit, and you then give him a treat, you’re rewarding his getting up 
and not the sit.
 
 When using this method of teaching your dog to sit, position your hand 
properly in relation to the dog’s head. If your hand is held too high, your 
dog will jump up; if it’s too low, he won’t sit. Hold your hand about 2 
inches above his head.
 
4. If your dog doesn’t respond on his own, say “Sit” again and physically 
place your dog into a Sit position by placing your left hand under his 
tail and behind his knees and placing your right hand on his chest, 
and then tuck him into a sit.

414
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
5. Keep your hands still and count to five before giving him the treat.
 
6. Practice making your dog sit five times in a row for five days.
 
 Some dogs catch on to this idea so quickly that they sit in front of their 
owner whenever they want a treat.
Getting your dog to sit on command — the next part
When your dog understands what Sit means, you can start to teach her to 
obey your command.
 
1. Put the treat in your right hand and keep it at your side.
 
2. Put one or two fingers, depending on the size of your dog, of your left 
hand through her training collar at the top of her neck, palm facing 
up, and tell her to sit.
 
 If she sits, give her a treat and tell her how good she is while taking your 
hand out of the collar. If she doesn’t sit, pull up on her collar and wait 
until she sits, and then praise her and reward her with a treat.
 
3. Practice until she sits on command — that is, without having to pull 
up on or touch the collar.
 
4. Give her a treat and praise her for every correct response, keeping 
her in position to the count of five.
 
As your dog demonstrates that she has mastered sitting on command, start 
to reward the desired response every other time. Finally, reward her on a 
random basis — every now and then, give her a treat after she sits on command. 
A random reward is the most powerful reinforcement of what your dog has 
learned. It’s based on the premise that hope springs eternal. To make the 
random reward work, all you have to do is use it and keep using it!
Now when your dog wants to greet you by jumping up, tell her to sit. When 
she does, praise her, scratch her under the chin, and then release her. 
Following this simple method consistently, you can change your dog’s 
greeting behavior from trying to jump on you to sitting to being petted.
Sit-Staying
As a part of your dog’s education, he has to learn the Sit-Stay in a more 
formal manner — not just at home, but anywhere. Because he already knows 
the Sit command, teaching the Sit-Stay will probably go relatively quickly.

415
 Chapter 3: Basic Training and Beyond
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
How much time you have to spend and how many repetitions it takes for 
each progression depend on your dog’s personality. How much time do you 
need to spend at any given session? As long as you and the dog enjoy it. You 
can also practice several different exercises at the same session — the Sit-
Stay, the Down, Walking On Leash without pulling, and the Come. Whatever 
you do, there’s no point advancing to the next progression until the dog 
masters the previous one.
Follow these steps in mastering the Sit-Stay:
 
1. With your dog sitting at your left side, both of you facing in the same 
direction (called the Heel position), put the rings of his training collar 
on top of his neck and attach the leash to the dead ring of the collar 
(or fit the gentle leader/head collar over his head).
 
 In the Heel position, the area from the dog’s head to his shoulder is in 
line with your left hip, with both of you facing in the same direction.
 
2. Put the loop of the leash over the thumb of your left hand and fold the 
leash accordion style into your hand, with the part of the leash going 
toward the dog coming out at the bottom of your hand.
 
 Hold your hand as close to the dog’s collar as you comfortably can. The 
farther away from the dog’s collar you are, the less control you have.
 
3. Apply a little upward tension on the collar — just enough to let him 
know the tension is there, but not enough to make him uncomfortable.
 
4. Say “Stay” and give the Stay signal — a pendulum motion with the 
right hand, palm facing the dog, stopping in front of the dog’s nose, 
and then returning to your right side (Figure 3-1).
 
 Keep your body as straight as you can, and don’t bend over your dog. 
Before you step away from your dog, make sure that your right hand is 
at your side again.
 
5. Take a step to the right, keeping the tension on the collar, count to 
ten, return to your dog’s side, release tension, praise him, and release 
him, taking several steps forward.
 
6. Repeat, but this time step directly in front of your dog, count to ten, 
step back to Heel position, release tension, praise, and release.
 
7. With your dog in Heel position, put the rings of the training collar 
under your dog’s chin and attach the leash to the live ring of the 
collar (the one that moves).
 
8. Neatly fold your leash accordion style into your left hand, and place it 
against your belt buckle, allowing 1 foot of slack.

416
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
Figure 3-1: 
Giving the 
Stay signal.
 
 
9. Say and signal “Stay” and then place yourself 1 foot in front of your 
dog, keeping your left hand at your belt buckle and your right hand at 
your side, palm open, facing your dog.
 
When you see that your dog’s attention is drifting, he’s probably about to 
move. You can tell your dog is thinking about moving when he starts to look 
around and begins to focus on something other than you. Any time you see 
that lack of attention, reinforce the Stay command by slapping the leash 
straight up with your right hand. Don’t say anything, but smile at your dog 
when he’s in position. Return your right hand to your side.
If your dog is thinking about moving or actually tries to move, take a step 
toward your dog with your right foot and, with your right hand, slap the leash 
straight up to a point directly above his head. Bring back your right foot and 
right hand to their original positions without repeating the Stay command. 
Count to 30 and pivot back to your dog’s right side. Count to five, praise, and 
release.
Until you discover how to recognize the signs that your dog is going to move, 
chances are, you’ll be too late in reinforcing the Stay, and he’ll have moved. 
When that happens, without saying anything, put him back at the spot where 
he was supposed to stay, stand in front of him, count to ten, return to Heel 
position, count to five, and release him. Repeat over the course of several 
training sessions until your dog is steady on this exercise.

Playing the Sit-Stay game
The following steps, using the leash on the dead ring of the collar (or on 
the gentle leader), involve testing your dog’s understanding of Stay, while 
extending the time and distance of the Stay command:
 
1. Starting in Heel position, with your left hand holding the leash and 
placed against your belt buckle, say and signal “Stay” and then step 3 
feet in front of your dog, with no tension on the leash.
 
2. Slightly rotate your left hand downward, against your body, to apply 
tension on the leash.
 
 This test is called the Sit-Stay test. If your dog moves to come to you, 
reinforce the Stay with your right hand. Test three times, increasing the 
tension until you get physical resistance from your dog.
 
 Your tension needs to be commensurate to your dog’s size and weight. 
In other words, Terrier-strength tension applied to your Golden 
Retriever isn’t going to produce the desired results.
 
 For the Sit-Stay test, use a downward rotation of the left wrist. Maintain 
tension for a few seconds and then slowly release tension. You’re looking 
for physical resistance from your dog. From now on, practice this quick 
test before you do a Sit-Stay. Remember to release at the end of the 
exercise.
 
3. Starting in Heel position, with the leash now on the live ring, go 3 feet 
in front of your dog.
 
 The goal is to have her stay for one minute. If she moves, reinforce the 
Stay.
 
4. Move 6 feet in front, to the end of the leash.
You need to practice the Sit-Stay on a fairly regular basis, but you don’t want 
to bore yourself or your dog. After your dog understands what you want, 
once or twice a week is perfectly adequate. Start with the Sit-Stay test to 
refresh her recollection of what you expect from her. When she’s reliable on 
leash, try her off leash in a safe place. First practice 3 feet in front, and then 
gradually increase the distance and the time you expect her to stay.
Releasing: The magic word is “Okay”
When you say the release word, “Okay,” your dog will know that he can move 
now and is on his own time. Make it a strict rule to give him the release word, 
which allows him to move again, every time after you tell him to stay. If you 
get lax about releasing and forget, he’ll get into the habit of releasing himself. 
That teaches him that he can decide when to move — not a good idea and 
the opposite of what you want him to learn.

418
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
Your dog also needs to learn the difference between being praised for 
responding correctly and being released. Praise isn’t an invitation to move. 
You say “good boy” when he responds to a command. Praise is when you use 
your voice. Petting is when you use your hands. You release him when the 
exercise is finished.
 
As quickly as you can, get into the habit of using only one command. If you 
don’t get the desired response on the first command, show your dog what 
you want without repeating it. Repeating commands teaches your dog to 
ignore you. If you’re consistent from the start, your dog learns he has to 
respond to the first command.
Getting the dog down (and staying down)
Your dog already knows how to lie down, but she needs to be taught to lie 
down on command. Down is the command to use when you want your dog 
to lie down in place, right now, and stay there until you release her. The 
following steps can help you teach this command:
 
1. With your dog sitting at your left side and a treat in your right hand, 
put one or two fingers of your left hand, palm facing you, through her 
collar at the side of her neck.
 
 Show her the treat and lower it straight down and in front of your dog 
as you apply gentle downward pressure on the collar, at the same time 
saying, “Down.”
 
2. When she lies down, give her the treat and praise her by telling her 
what a good dog she is.
 
 Keep your left hand in the collar and your right hand off your dog while 
telling her how clever she is so that she learns she’s being praised for 
lying down. With a small dog, you may want to do the exercise on a 
table.
 
3. Reverse the process by showing her a treat and bringing it up slightly 
above her head with upward pressure on the collar as you tell her 
to sit.
 
 Practice having your dog lie down at your side five times in a row for 
five days, or until she does it on command with minimal pressure on the 
collar. Praise her and reward her with a treat every time.
 
4. Sit your dog at your left side and put two fingers of your left hand, 
palm facing you, through her collar at the side of her neck.
 
 Keep your right hand with the treat at your right side.

419
 Chapter 3: Basic Training and Beyond
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
 
5. Say “Down” and apply downward pressure on the collar.
 
 When she lies down, praise her and give her a treat every other 
time. Practice over the course of several days until she lies down on 
command without any pressure on the collar.
 
Make a game out of teaching your dog to lie down on command. Get her 
eager about a treat and, in an excited tone of voice, say “Down.” Then give 
her the treat. After that, when she lies down on command, you can randomly 
reward her.
Although the Sit-Stay is used for relatively short periods, the Down-Stay 
is used for longer periods. Traditionally, the Down-Stay is also taught as a 
safety exercise — to get the dog to stop wherever she is and stay there. For 
example, she finds herself across the road. She sees you and is just about to 
cross the road when a car comes. You need a way to get her to stay on the 
other side until the car has passed.
 
The object of the Down-Stay command is to have your dog respond to your 
command whether she’s up close or at a distance. Pointing to the ground 
won’t work from a distance, so you need to train your dog to respond to an 
oral command. This point is where the Down-Stay command comes in — the 
theory being that the dog is least likely to move in the Down position. Be that 
as it may, you’ll find this command not that hard to teach, and you do want 
to be able to stop your dog in her tracks.
Go lie down, doggy!
Go Lie Down is a useful command when you want your dog to go to a specific 
spot and remain there for an extended period until you release him. Use the 
command whenever you don’t want him underfoot, such as at mealtimes or 
when you have visitors and don’t want him making a pest of himself.
Select the spot where you want him to hang out — his crate, bed, chair, 
whatever:
 
1. Depending on your needs, you can also use a movable object — a dog 
bed, crate pad, or blanket, which allows you to change locations.
 
 Assume that you’re going to use a dog bed.
 
2. Take your dog to the bed and tell him, “Go lie down.”
 
 You may have to coax him with a treat.
 
3. When he lies down on the bed, praise him, give him the treat, count to 
five, and release him.

420
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
4. Repeat until he readily lies down on the bed.
 
5. Next, start 3 feet from the bed, give the command “Go lie down,” and 
lure him onto the bed with a treat.
 
6. Praise him when he lies down, give him the treat, count to ten, and 
release him.
 
7. Repeat several times, gradually increasing the time between the 
praise and the giving of the treat, from a count of 10 to a count of 30.
 
 Stop for now — you’re getting bored and so is he. Come back to it 
another time.
For your next session, review the last progression two or three times and 
then send him from 3 feet. Stand still, but motion him to go to his bed. He 
may surprise you and actually go to his bed and lie down. If he does, praise 
him enthusiastically and give him a treat. If he just stands there with a 
befuddled look on his face, put one finger through his collar, guide him to his 
bed, and, when he lies down, praise him and give him a treat. You may have 
to repeat this process several times until he responds to the command.
When your dog responds reliably from 3 feet, gradually and over the course 
of several sessions, increase the distance from the bed, as well as the length 
of time — up to 30 minutes — you want him to stay there. If he gets up 
without being released, just put him back (finger through the collar).
The Go Lie Down command, although practical, isn’t the most exciting 
exercise. Use common sense, and don’t make it drudgery.
 
You must release him from the spot when he can move again. If you forget, 
he’ll get into the habit of releasing himself, thereby undermining the purpose 
of the exercise.
Dashing Your Dog’s Dashing Habits
 
Almost as annoying as unrestrained greeting behavior, but far more dangerous, 
is the dog’s habit of dashing through doors just because they’re open, racing 
up and down stairs — ahead of or behind you — and jumping in and out 
of the car without permission. These behaviors are dangerous to your dog 
because she may find herself in the middle of the road and get run over. 
They’re dangerous to you because you may get knocked over or down the 
stairs.
Prevent such potential accidents by teaching your dog to sit and stay while 
you open the door and to wait until you tell her it’s okay to go out.

421

Door and stair manners
After your dog knows the Sit-Stay, you can easily teach her door manners:
 
1. Put your dog on leash, using the dead ring of the training collar, and 
review the Sit-Stay test described in “Teaching the Basics” earlier in 
the chapter.
 
2. Neatly fold the leash, accordion style, into your left hand, and 
approach the closed door you normally use to let her out.
 
 Follow the same procedure as you did for sequence 1 of the Sit-Stay. 
Place yourself in such a way that you can open the door without your 
dog having to get out of its way.
 
3. With a little upward tension on the collar, tell her to stay and open 
the door.
 
 Release the tension, and she should stay. If she doesn’t, apply a little 
upward tension. Close the door and try again.
 
4. When your dog stays without any tension on the leash facing the open 
door, slowly walk through the door.
 
 If she tries to follow, apply upward tension on the leash to remind her to 
stay. Repeat until she stays without having to be reminded.
 
5. Walk through the door and release her so she can follow you.
 
6. Repeat the entire sequence off leash, beginning with Step 1.
You’ll find that after several repetitions, she begins to get the message and 
will sit and stay on her own as you approach the door.
 
Motion means more to dogs than words, so make sure that you stand still 
when releasing your dog. For this exercise, you don’t want her to associate 
your moving with the release. Dogs are also time conscious, so vary the 
length of time you make her wait before releasing her.
Some people prefer to go through the doorway first, while others want the 
dog to go through first. It makes no difference, as long as your dog stays until 
you release her. Practice through doors your dog uses regularly, including 
the car door, especially when exiting the car. Every time you make her sit and 
stay, you reinforce your position as pack leader and the one in charge.
 
If you have stairs, start teaching her to stay at the bottom while you go up. 
First Sit her and tell her to Stay. When she tries to follow, put her back and 
start again. Practice until you can go all the way up the stairs with her waiting 
at the bottom before you release her to follow. Repeat the same procedure 
for going down the stairs.

422
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
After your dog has been trained to wait at one end of the stairs, you’ll 
discover that she’ll anticipate the release. She’ll jump the gun and get up just 
as you’re thinking about releasing her. Before long, she’ll stay only briefly 
and release herself when she chooses. It may happen almost as soon as 
she grasps the idea, or it may take a few weeks or even months, but it will 
happen.
When it does, stop whatever you’re doing and put her back, use the stairs, 
turn, count to ten, and release her. Don’t let her get into the habit of releasing 
herself. Consistency is just as important here as it is in teaching any other 
exercise.
The doorbell and guests
Your dog now knows to sit and stay when you open the door. It’s doubtful, 
however, that he’ll obey these commands when the doorbell rings or 
someone knocks on the door. The doorbell usually causes an immediate 
charge amid barking. Even though most people want their dog to display his 
protective side, they then also want him to stop, sit, and stay so they can 
answer the door.
To accomplish this goal, you need to enlist the aid of a friend or neighbor to 
ring the doorbell.
 
1. Agree on a time and then put your dog on leash.
 
 When the bell rings and your dog goes through his antics, tell him to Sit 
and Stay.
 
 To help make your helper’s arrival as traditional as possible, have her 
ring the doorbell only once. Ask her to wait for you to open the door.
 
2. Start to open the door, and when your dog gets up, which he surely 
will, reinforce the Sit-Stay with a check (a quick pull of the leash).
 
 If your dog is an excitable soul, you may have to put him on the live ring 
of his training collar before he takes you seriously. Less excitable dogs 
catch on after two or three attempts.
 
3. When your dog stays, open the door and admit your accomplice.
 
 At this point, your dog wants to say hello. Again, reinforce the Stay and 
have your helper approach him while holding out the palm of her hand.
 
4. Let your dog sniff the palm and then have your helper ignore him.
 
 You may have to be right next to your dog to reinforce the Sit-Stay.
 
5. You need to repeat this procedure several times until the dog is 
reliable and holds the Sit-Stay while you open the door.
 
 Remember to release him. Successful training depends on who is more 
determined and persistent — you or your dog.

423
 Chapter 3: Basic Training and Beyond
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
The procedure to teach your dog not to jump on people is the same. Follow 
the same progressions as you did for the doorbell, and when he wants to 
jump on your helper, reinforce the Stay command. After several repetitions, 
he should be steady enough to try him off leash. The key to your ability to 
control him is a reliable Sit-Stay.
Having said that, you also need to remind your guests not to get your dog all 
riled up with vigorous petting or active solicitations to play. The less excitement, 
the better. The proper way to greet a dog on a Sit-Stay is to let him sniff the 
palm of the hand and perhaps give a little scratch under the chin. A dog 
doesn’t like to have the top of his head patted any more than kids do.
 
When teaching a new command, you may have to repeat it several times 
during the initial introduction before your dog catches on. After the first 
session, teach him to respond to the first command. Give the command, 
and if nothing happens, show your dog exactly what you want by physically 
helping him. Consistency is the key to success.
Setting the Tone for Proper 
Table Manners
Teaching your dog table manners is your responsibility, and you have to 
remember only one rule: Don’t feed the dog from the table. This concept 
sounds a lot simpler than it is, especially in a multiperson household. 
Moreover, don’t ever underestimate your dog’s ability to train you.
 
Every time you reward your dog’s efforts with a treat from the table, you’re 
systematically teaching her not to take no for an answer.
When she was a puppy, nobody thought much about occasionally slipping 
her something from the table. But now she is 6 months old, almost fully 
grown, and has started to beg at the table. Because her begging is no longer 
Paying attention to inflection
Give commands in a normal tone of voice. 
For example, when giving the Sit command, 
remember that it’s “Sit!” — the command — 
and not “Sit?” — the question.
When releasing, say “Okay!” in a more excited 
tone of voice, as in, “That’s it, you’re all done!”
Unless impaired, a dog’s sense of hearing is 
extremely acute, and when giving a command, 
there’s absolutely no need to shout. In fact, the 
opposite is true — the more quietly you give 
your commands, the quicker your dog learns to 
pay attention to you.

424
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
cute and is embarrassing when you have guests, the family resolves to put a 
stop to it.
At first, your dog doesn’t believe you’re serious; after all, you were the one 
who started it in the first place. She digs a little deeper into her repertoire 
of begging routines. She may sit up, nudge you, paw you, or whine in the 
most pathetic tone as though she’s near death’s door from starvation. Sure 
enough, little Sally takes pity on her and slips her something.
As this scenario repeats itself, often with longer intervals before someone 
gives in, your dog is systematically being trained to persevere at all cost and 
never give up. Looking at it from her point of view, you’re rewarding, even 
encouraging, the very behavior you want to stop.
When you stop rewarding the undesired behavior (begging), your dog will 
stop begging at the table. As soon as you stop giving in to your dog, her 
efforts will decrease, until over time, and provided you don’t have a relapse, 
she’ll stop begging altogether. You have extinguished the undesired behavior 
by refusing to reward it.
You can also save yourself all this aggravation by teaching your dog the Go 
Lie Down command so you can enjoy your meals in peace. (See “Go lie down, 
doggy!” earlier in this chapter.)
Walking Your Dog
Taking your dog for a nice, long walk is balm for the soul and good exercise 
for both of you, provided he doesn’t drag you down the street. Teaching him 
to walk on a loose leash makes your strolls with your dog a pleasure rather 
than a chore.
You want to be able to take your dog for a walk on leash and have him remain 
within the length of his leash without pulling. A leisurely stroll is an important 
daily routine, and for many dogs, it’s the only opportunity to get some fresh air.
Even better from the dog’s perspective is a good run in the park or the 
woods. For this privilege, your dog has to learn to come when called. You can 
teach him to respond to the Come command by playing the Recall Game.
Another command you want your dog to learn is Leave It. The command 
tells the dog to ignore whatever interests him at the time. The object of his 
interest can be a cat, another dog, a person, or something on the ground. 
Leave It is especially useful when your dog discovers something disgusting 
he perceives as edible.

Even if you don’t ordinarily take him for walks, the well-trained dog knows 
how to walk on a leash without pulling your arms out. For example, at least 
once a year, you have to take him to the vet. If he’s been trained to walk on 
leash, the visit will go much more smoothly than if he bounces off the end of 
the leash like a kangaroo.
 
Dogs pull on a leash because they’re more interested in the sights and scents 
in their environment than in you. Your job is to teach your dog to become 
aware of and respect your existence at the other end of the leash.
Born to pull
To teach your dog not to pull, you need her training collar, her leash, and a 
few treats. Attach the leash to the live ring of the training collar (or to the 
gentle leader). Take her to an area without too many distractions — you 
don’t need other people and dogs (especially loose dogs) in the vicinity right 
now — and where you can walk in a straight line or in a circle (about 30 feet 
in diameter).
Perform these steps:
 
1. Put the loop of the leash over the thumb of your right hand and make 
a fist.
 
2. Place your left hand directly under your right.
 
 Hold the leash in both hands as though it were a baseball bat. Plant both 
hands firmly against your belt buckle.
 
3. Say “Let’s go” and start walking.
 
4. Just before she gets to the end of the leash, say “Buddy, easy,” (using 
her name instead) make an about-turn to your right, and walk in the 
opposite direction.
 
 Be sure that you keep your hands firmly planted. As a safety precaution, 
don’t put your entire hand through the loop of the leash or wrap it 
around your hand. If your dog catches you unaware and makes a dash, 
she may cause you to fall. By having the loop over your thumb, you can 
just let go, and it’ll slide off.
 
5. Step 2 produces a tug on your dog’s collar and turns her in the new 
direction.
 
 As she scampers to catch up with you, tell her what a clever dog she is, 
and give her a treat. Before you know it, she’ll be ahead of you again, 
and you’ll have to repeat the procedure. When you make your turn, do 
it with determination. Be sure that you keep your hands firmly planted 

426
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
against your belt buckle. Make your turn, and keep walking in the new 
direction. Don’t look back, and don’t worry about her; she’ll quickly 
catch up. Remember to praise and reward her when she does.
 
The first few times you try this exercise, you’ll be a little late — she’s already 
leaning into her collar. Try it again. Concentrate on your dog, and learn to 
anticipate when you have to make the turn. Always give her a chance to 
respond by saying, “Buddy, easy” before you make the turn. You need to 
repeat this sequence several times over the course of a few training sessions 
until she understands that you don’t want her to pull. Your goal is to teach 
her to walk within the perimeter of her leash without pulling.
Most dogs quickly learn to respect the leash, and with an occasional 
reminder, they become a pleasure to take for a walk. Some, on the other 
hand, don’t seem to get it. If your dog seems particularly dense about this 
simple concept, or if the training collar or gentle leader just don’t cut it, you 
may need to use a pinch or prong collar (see Chapter 6 of Book I for more on 
pinch collars). Put your dog in a position where you can praise her.
How readily your dog responds to her collar depends on these factors:
 
 How distracted she is by what’s going on around her, including scents 
on the ground
 
 Her size and weight in relation to your size and weight
 
 Her personality
 
 Her touch sensitivity
The pinch collar is an equalizer for these factors. It lets you enjoy training your 
dog without becoming frustrated or angry. Your dog, in turn, will thank you 
for maintaining a positive attitude and for praising her when she responds 
correctly.
Heeling on leash
Heeling and walking on a loose leash are two different exercises. When you 
take your dog for a walk to give him exercise or to do his business, he’s on 
his own time. He can sniff, look around, or just aimlessly wander about, 
as long as he doesn’t pull. For those times when you walk him on a busy 
sidewalk or in an area with traffic, he needs to learn the Heel command.
Heeling means your dog has to walk at your left side, the traditional position, 
while paying strict attention to you and staying with you as you change 
direction or pace. When your dog is heeling, he’s on your time, not his own. 
His responsibility is to focus on you, and you have to teach him to accept 

427
 Chapter 3: Basic Training and Beyond
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
that responsibility. He has to learn to heel whether you make a right turn 
or a left turn, do an about-face turn, run, or walk slowly. The key to teaching 
heeling is to get him to pay attention to you.
 
Heeling is used for walking your dog in traffic — when you need absolute 
control — and for competitive obedience events. The American Kennel Club 
(AKC) definition of heeling is walking “close to the left side of the handler 
without swinging wide, lagging, forging, or crowding,” either on a loose leash 
or off leash.
Teaching your dog to sit at heel
Before teaching your dog to heel with both of you walking, you’re going to 
teach him what to do when you stop, which is called the Automatic Sit at 
Heel:
 
1. Attach your leash to the gentle leader/head collar or to the live ring of 
your dog’s training collar and have him sit at your left side with both 
of you facing in the same direction while you put the leash over your 
right shoulder.
 
2. Say “Buddy, heel.”
 
3. Take a step forward on your right foot, and then a step with the left 
past the right; drop down on your right knee, put your right hand 
against your dog’s chest, and fold him into a Sit at Heel position.
 
 Use the same technique to sit your dog described in Chapter 2 of Book 
IV, and avoid the temptation to push down on his rear. Keep your hands 
in place as you tell him how clever he is.
Your dog already knows the Sit command (right?), but you’re now showing 
him exactly where you want him to sit. Practice the Sit at Heel about five 
times or until both of you feel comfortable with this maneuver (see Figure 3-2).
Teaching heeling
To teach heeling, choose a location relatively free of distractions (preferably 
a confined area, such as your backyard), and follow these steps:
 
1. Attach your leash to the live ring of your dog’s training collar and 
have him sit at your left side with both of you facing in the same 
direction while you put the leash over your right shoulder.
 
 You need to allow about 4 inches of slack so there’s no tension on the 
leash when you start.
 
2. Make a funnel with both hands around the leash.
 
 Keep both hands about waist high and close to your body. The object is 
not to touch the leash until necessary.

428
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
Figure 3-2: 
Preparing 
to teach 
heeling on 
leash.
 
 
3. In a pleasant, upbeat tone of voice, say “Buddy, heel” and start to 
walk.
 
 Move out briskly, as though you’re late for an appointment. Walk in a 
large, clockwise circle or in a straight line.
 
4. When your dog leaves your left side, close your hands around the 
leash and bring him back to Heel position.
 
 You’ll notice that as soon as both of you are in motion, your dog wants 
to get ahead of you. Close your hands on the leash, and firmly bring him 
back to your left side. Work on keeping his shoulder in line with your left 
hip. Anytime he gets out of position, bring him back and tell him how 
clever he is.
 
5. After about ten steps, stop and place him in a Sit at Heel, and verbally 
praise him.
 
 It’ll take you a few tries to get the hang of it. At first, you’ll be a little 
slow on the uptake. He’s joyfully bounding ahead of you, the leash has 
fallen off your shoulder, and you’re scrambling to get it back. Just start 
over and work on anticipating what your dog is going to do.

429
 Chapter 3: Basic Training and Beyond
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
 
When heeling your dog, walk briskly and with determination, as though 
you’re trying to catch the next train home. The more energy you put into 
your pace, the easier it is to keep your dog’s attention focused on you. If you 
dawdle, so does your dog. By paying attention to your dog, you’ll discover 
when you need to bring him back to Heel. If you can see his tail, you’ve 
waited too long.
Your initial goal is to be able to heel your dog for ten paces without having to 
touch the leash. How long it takes you depends on these factors:
 
 Your dog
 
 What your dog was bred to do
 
 His response to the training collar
 
 Your attitude
Generally, if you have a Shetland Sheepdog, you’ll reach that goal in maybe 
five minutes; if you have a Fox Terrier, you’ll work on it considerably longer.
When your dog heels without your having to touch the leash for ten paces, 
gradually increase the number of steps before a halt. Bring him back to 
Heel whenever necessary, and then praise him. After about five training 
sessions, he should be getting the idea, at least in an area relatively free from 
distractions.
Changing direction
When you and your dog have pretty much gotten the hang of heeling, your 
next step is to introduce her to changes of direction while heeling. In this 
section, you find out about the three essential turns — a right turn, an 
about-turn to the right, and a left turn.
Right turn
To stay with you when you’re making a right turn, your dog needs to speed 
up. At this stage in your training, she isn’t yet giving you 100 percent of her 
attention, and you’re going to anticipate that she needs help with the right 
turn.
 
If you want your dog to pay attention to you, you have to pay attention to 
your dog. Discovering how to anticipate what she’s going to do is the first 
step to successful heeling. Just before you make the turn, enthusiastically 
say her name, make the turn, and keep moving. Using her name causes her 
to look up at you, and she then notices that you’re changing direction, which 
causes her to stay with you. Without giving her that cue, as you make the 
turn and go one way, she’ll probably keep going the other direction.

430
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
About-turn
An about-turn is a right turn times two. When you make your turn, keep your 
feet together so she can keep up. As you did for the right turn, use her name 
just before you make the turn, to encourage her to stay with you.
 
If your dog has a particularly difficult time remaining at your side for the 
right turn or about-turn, you can use a treat or other object of interest to 
help guide her around. Hold the treat in your right hand as you’re heeling. 
Before you make the turn, show it to your dog by bringing the treat directly 
in front of her nose and using it to guide her around the turn, and then give 
her the treat.
This approach has a potential drawback. Some dogs become overly stimulated 
when they know you have a treat in your hand. Make no mistake about it, 
she knows. If you see that your dog becomes difficult to control under such 
circumstances, you may want to eliminate use of the treat. The hassle isn’t 
worth the potential benefit.
Left turn
To make the left turn without bumping into her, she needs to slow down as 
you make the turn and then resume normal speed after you make the turn. 
Just before you make the turn, slow down. With your left hand, draw back on 
the leash, make the turn, bring your hand back to position, and resume your 
normal brisk pace. Practice heeling and doing the turns for a few times as a 
regular part of your daily outings.
Changing pace
You need to teach your dog to change pace with you while heeling. He has to 
learn that whether you walk slowly or quickly, he must stay in Heel position.
 
For the slow pace, cut the speed of your pace in half, but maintain the same 
length of stride. As you go into the slow pace, draw back on the leash to keep 
your dog in Heel position. For the fast pace, double the speed of your normal 
pace, again keeping the length of your stride the same. Just before you go 
into a fast pace, use your dog’s name in an excited tone of voice to encourage 
him to stay with you.
You’re still working with the leash over your shoulder. By now, you’ll also 
be able to tell whether he is actually heeling. If heeling properly, he doesn’t 
swing wide on right turns and about-turns, bump into you on the left turn, 
fall behind you as you go into a fast pace, or get ahead of you as you go into a 
slow pace.

Winning the Game of 
Coming When Called
One of the greatest joys of owning a dog is going for a walk in a park or the 
woods and letting her run, knowing she’ll come when called. A dog who 
doesn’t come when called is a prisoner of her leash and, if she gets loose, a 
danger to herself and others. This section offers some proven rules for 
helping you and your dog realize the benefits of coming when called.
Follow these basic rules to encourage your dog to come to you when you 
call her:
 
 Exercise, exercise, exercise. Many dogs don’t come when called 
because they don’t get enough exercise. At every chance, they run off 
and make the most of this unexpected freedom by staying out as long as 
possible.
 
 Consider what your dog was bred to do, and that tells you how much 
exercise she needs. Just putting her out in the backyard isn’t good 
enough. You have to participate. Think of it this way: Exercise is as good 
for you as it is for your dog. A good source for exercise requirements is 
The Roger Caras Dog Book: The Complete Guide to Every AKC Breed, 3rd 
Edition (M. Evans & Co.).
 
 Whenever your dog comes to you, be nice to her. One of the quickest 
ways to teach your dog not to come to you is to call her to punish her or 
to do something the dog perceives as unpleasant. Most dogs consider 
it unpleasant to be called just before they’re left alone in the house or 
given a pill. In these circumstances, go and get your dog instead of 
calling her to you.
 
 Another example of teaching your dog not to come is taking her for a 
run in the park and calling her to you only when it’s time to go home. 
Repeating this sequence several times teaches the dog that the party 
is over. Soon she may become reluctant to return to you when called 
because she isn’t ready to end the fun. You can prevent this kind of 
unintentional training by calling her to you several times during her 
outing, sometimes giving her a treat, sometimes just a word of praise. 
Then let her romp again.
 
 Teach her to Come as soon as you get her. Ideally, you acquired your 
dog as a puppy, which is the best time to teach her to come when called. 
Start right away. But remember, sometime between 4 and 8 months of 
age, your puppy begins to realize there’s a big, wide world out there. 
While she’s going through this stage, keep her on leash so she doesn’t 
learn that she can ignore you when you call her.

432
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
 When in doubt, keep her on leash. Work to anticipate when your dog 
is likely not to come. You may be tempting fate by trying to call her after 
she has spotted a cat, another dog, or a jogger. Of course, sometimes 
you goof and let her go just as another dog appears out of nowhere.
 
 Resist the urge to make a complete fool of yourself by bellowing “Come” 
a million times. The more often you holler “Come,” the quicker she 
learns she can ignore you when she’s off leash. Instead, patiently go to 
her and put her on leash. Don’t get angry with her after you’ve caught 
her, or you’ll make her afraid of you, and she’ll run away when you try to 
catch her the next time.
 
 Make sure that your dog always comes to you and lets you touch her 
collar before you reward. Touching her collar prevents the dog from 
developing the annoying habit of playing “catch” — coming toward you 
and then dancing around you, just out of reach. So teach her to let you 
touch her collar before you offer a treat or praise.
Training your dog to come when called
You need two people, one hungry dog, one 6-foot leash, plenty of small 
treats, and two whistles (optional). Some people prefer to train their dog to 
come to a whistle instead of using the verbal command “Come.” Some people 
train their dog to do both.
What works best depends on the dog, and you may want to experiment. 
Consider trying the verbal command first, because you may need to call your 
dog sometime but don’t have your whistle. You can then repeat the steps, 
using a whistle, which goes very quickly because your dog already has some 
understanding of what he’s supposed to do.
For this exercise, you need to be inside the house, with your dog on a 6-foot 
leash. You and your partner sit on the floor, 6 feet apart, facing each other, 
and your partner gently restrains the dog while you hold the end of the leash.
 
1. Call your dog by saying, “Buddy, come” and use the leash to guide 
him to you.
 
 Avoid the temptation to reach for your dog.
 
2. When he comes to you, put your hand through his collar, give him a 
treat, pet him, and praise him enthusiastically.
 
 Now you can — and should — pet him so he understands how happy 
you are that he came to you. This situation is different from the Sit or 
the Down earlier in this chapter, when you want him to remain in place, 
and petting him will cause him to get up.

433
 Chapter 3: Basic Training and Beyond
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
 
3. Hold him and pass the leash to your partner, who says, “Buddy, 
come,” guides the dog in, puts his hand through the collar, gives him 
a treat, and praises the dog.
 
 Keep working on this exercise until your dog responds on his own to 
being called and no longer needs to be guided in with the leash.
 
4. Repeat the exercise with your dog off leash, gradually increasing the 
distance between you and your partner to 12 feet.
 
5. Have your partner hold him by the collar while you go into another 
room and then call your dog.
 
6. When he finds you, put your hand through the collar, give him a treat, 
and praise him.
 
 If he can’t find you, slowly go to him, take him by the collar, and bring 
him to the spot where you called. Reward and praise.
 
7. Have your partner go into another room and then call the dog.
 
8. Repeat the exercise until the dog doesn’t hesitate in finding you or 
your partner in any room of the house.
 
9. Take your dog outside to a confined area, such as a fenced yard, 
tennis court, park, or school yard, and repeat Steps 1, 2, and 3.
Now you’re ready to practice by yourself. With your dog on leash, take him 
for a walk. Let him sniff around, and when he isn’t paying any attention to 
you, call him. When he gets to you, give him a treat and make a big fuss over 
him. If he doesn’t come, firmly check him toward you (you may have to use 
the live ring of his training collar), and then reward and praise him. Repeat 
until he comes to you every time you call him. After he’s trained, you don’t 
have to reward him with a treat every time, but do so randomly.
Adding distractions
Most dogs need to be trained to come in the face of distractions, such as 
other dogs, children, joggers, food, or friendly strangers. Think about the 
most irresistible situations for your dog, and then practice under those 
circumstances.
Put a 12-foot leash on your dog (you can tie two 6-foot leashes together) and 
take her to an area where she’s likely to encounter her favorite distraction. 
When she spots it (jogger, bicycle, other dog, whatever), let her become 
thoroughly engrossed, by either watching or straining at her leash, and then 
call her. More than likely, she’ll ignore you. Give a sharp tug on the leash and 
guide her back to you. Praise and pet her enthusiastically. Repeat three times 

434
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
per session until the dog turns and comes to you immediately when you call. 
If she doesn’t, you may have to change your training equipment.
Some dogs quickly learn to avoid the distraction by staying close to you, 
which is fine. Tell her what a clever dog she is, and then try with a different 
distraction at another time.
 
Repeat in different locations with as many different distractions as you can 
find. Try it with someone offering your dog a tidbit as a distraction (don’t let 
the dog get the treat), someone petting the dog, and anything else that may 
distract her. Use your imagination. Your goal is to have her respond reliably 
every time you call. Until she’s steady on leash, she most certainly won’t 
come off leash.
Advancing to off-leash distractions
How you approach adding off-leash distractions depends on your individual 
circumstances. For example, take your dog to an area where you aren’t likely 
to encounter distractions in the form of other dogs or people. Let him off 
leash, and allow him to become involved in a smell in the grass or a tree. 
Keep the distance between you and him about 10 feet. Call him, and if he 
responds, praise enthusiastically and reward. If he doesn’t, avoid the 
temptation to call him again. Don’t worry; he heard you but chose to ignore 
you. Instead, slowly walk up to him; firmly take him by his collar, under his 
chin, palm up; and trot backward to the spot where you called him. Then 
praise and reward.
After he’s reliable with this exercise, try him in an area with other distractions. 
If he doesn’t respond, practice for the correct response with the 12-foot leash 
before you try him off leash again.
Can you now trust him to come to you in an unconfined area? That depends 
on how well you’ve done your homework and what your dog may encounter 
in the real world. Understanding your dog and what interests him helps you 
know when he’s likely not to respond to the Come command.
 
Let common sense be your guide. For example, when you’re traveling and 
have to let him out to relieve himself at a busy interstate rest stop, you’d be 
foolhardy to let him run loose. When in doubt, keep him on leash.

Mastering the “Leave It” Command
You’d prefer it if your dog didn’t pick up anything from the ground that she 
perceives as potentially edible. What dogs find fascinating and, apparently, 
delicious, people often find disgusting. And if your dog gets hold of something 
rotten, she may get sick. The Leave It command is a good start for such 
situations.
 
Teaching this command is a wonderful opportunity to find out more about 
how your dog’s thought processes work. You can truly see the wheels turning. 
Depending on how quickly she catches on, you may want to practice this 
exercise over the course of several sessions. Keep the sessions short — no 
more than five minutes at a time, and follow these steps:
 
1. Hold a treat between your thumb and index finger.
 
2. With your palm facing up, show the treat to your dog.
 
 She’ll try to pry it loose. Say “Leave it,” close your hand into a fist, and 
turn it so that your palm now faces down. (See Figure 3-3.)
 
3. Observe your dog’s reaction.
 
 She may stare fixedly at the back of your hand, she may try to get to the 
treat by nuzzling or nibbling your hand, or she may start barking. Ignore 
all these behaviors. You’re looking for the first break in her attention 
away from your hand. She may make eye contact with you or look away.
 
4. The instant she breaks her attention away from your hand, say 
“Good” and give her the treat.
 
5. Repeat until your dog looks at you or away from your hand when you 
give the command and turn your hand over.
 
 You’re teaching her that looking at you and not at your hand is 
rewarded with a treat.
 
6. To find out whether she is responding to the command or to the turn-
ing of your hand, repeat Step 1 without turning your hand.
 
 If she responds, praise and reward. If she doesn’t, close your hand into a 
fist and wait for the break in attention. Repeat until she responds to the 
command.
 
7. Make yourself comfortable on the floor and show your dog a treat; put 
it on the floor and cover it with your hand.
 
 When her attention is on your hand or she tries to get to the treat, say 
“Leave it.”

436
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
Figure 3-3: 
Working on 
the Leave It 
command.
 
 
8. Wait for the break in attention, and then praise and reward.
 
9. Repeat Steps 6 and 7, but cover the treat with just your index finger. 
Then try it when placing the treat between your index and middle 
finger.
 
10. When successful, place the treat 1 inch in front of your hand, and 
repeat Steps 6 and 7.
 
 Here you need to be watchful: She may be faster at getting to the treat 
than you can cover it.
 
11. Put the dog on leash and stand next to her (Heel position), neatly 
fold the leash into your left hand, and hold your hand as close to her 
collar as is comfortable without any tension on the leash.
 
 Make sure that the amount of slack in the leash isn’t so much that her 
mouth can reach the floor.
 
12. Hold the treat in your right hand and show it to her, and then casually 
drop the treat.
 
 When she tries to get to the treat, say “Leave it.” If she responds, praise 
her, pick up the treat, and give it to her. If she doesn’t, check straight up. 
Repeat until she obeys the command.
 
 Test her response by taking off the leash and dropping a treat. If she 
makes a dive for it, don’t attempt to beat her to it or yell “No.” She’s 
telling you she needs more work on leash.

437

Shows
Now go outside — but first you need to do some preparation. Select a food 
item that’s readily visible to you in the grass or the ground, such as some 
crackers or popcorn. Drop four or five pieces of food in the area where you’re 
taking her for the big test. Put some of your regular treats in your pocket, 
and take her for a walk on leash in the area where you left the food. As 
soon as her nose goes to the food, say “Leave it.” If she responds, praise 
enthusiastically and give her a treat. If she doesn’t, check straight up.
 
If she manages to snag a cracker or kernel of popcorn, you’re too slow on the 
uptake. Practice walking around the food-contaminated area until she ignores 
the food on command.
Your dog should now know and obey the Leave It command. Test her off 
leash, and her response will tell you whether she needs more work. Still, 
as with any other command, you need to review it with her periodically on 
leash.

Teaching Your Dog Tricks
In This Chapter
 Doing tricks that show happiness and affection
 Playing games together
 Teaching paw tricks
 Getting your dog to roll
 Teaching begging tricks
 Encouraging stretches
L
ike people, every dog has different likes and dislikes, games they enjoy, 
and routines that they count on. When your training comes from a 
consistent, patient, and understanding place that takes these canine 
preferences into consideration, your dog will master tricks and activities 
quickly and enthusiastically.
Teaching interactive skills is your first trick. And as you’ll see, it isn’t 
complicated at all. In this chapter, you find out some tricks you can teach 
so your dog uses those barking, chewing, and jumping instincts in a socially 
acceptable way, and some simple tricks and games you can play together.
Before you dive into the dog tricks in this chapter, keep the following tips in 
mind:
 
 Know when to practice. Some games are designed to burn energy. Play 
these when your dog is full of beans. Other tricks are just for fun; when 
your dog catches on, she’ll want to practice as much as you.
 
 Keep the sessions short and sweet — no more than five to ten minutes. 
Several short lessons are better than one long one. With a positive 
attitude and the building-block approach, your dog can master these 
techniques in no time.
 
 Try a clicker. In Chapter 2, I discuss the use of a clicker. Although this 
little hand-held device isn’t mandatory for trick training, it can be useful 
when teaching complex tricks like the ones in this chapter. The sharp 
sound paired with a tasty food reward helps your dog know exactly

 Avoid forcing your dog to do certain tricks. Tricks like rolling over and 
begging are very entertaining, but please don’t force your dog if she’s 
not into it. Some dogs love to act silly; others don’t or can’t do it without 
discomfort. How do you know? If your dog naturally rolls around or 
easily sits back on her haunches, you have the green light! If rolling on 
the floor is beneath her standards or physical capabilities, don’t force it.
Some Simple Moves: Tricks 
for a Happy, Loving Dog
One of the fastest ways to get addicted to trick training is to teach your dog 
some easy tricks that showcase that puppy love. And dogs, like people, love 
to succeed, so the surest way to get your dog addicted to trick training is 
to start with a few surefire winners. Here are a few tricks that everyone can 
master — people and dogs of all ages.
Wag Your Tail
If you’re happy and you know it, wag your tail. Teaching your dog how to wag 
his tail on command is so easy. If a tennis ball brings the tail into action, hold 
up a ball; if food gets the tail to wag, use that. Catch your dog wagging, praise 
him for it, and think of a clever cue word to command each time (like “Wag”). 
Use your cue word in a positive, inviting tone and watch your dog come alive.
Now add a hand signal like waving your right hand back and forth. Start 
out with a pronounced sweep, and then phase off until you can make small 
motions with your index finger.
If you’re in front of a crowd, you can ask really difficult questions and tell 
your dog that if he agrees, all he has to do is wag his tail. It goes like this: “I’m 
going to ask you a hard question and if you agree, all you have to do is wag 
your tail. Ready? Would you like everyone to give you a hug?” Signal your 
dog, and voilà — a surefire crowd pleaser.
Give Me a Hug
 
Give Me a Hug is a breed-selective exercise. If your dog is injured, has 
dysplasia, or is skeletally challenged (like a Basset, a Bulldog, or a giant 
breed), avoid this trick. And don’t forget — if your dog refuses, move on.

441
 Chapter 4: Teaching Your Dog Tricks
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
You can teach this command in several ways. If your dog loves to wrapher 
paws around you, you can reinforce this behavior when it’s happening by 
using a clicker or you can cue your dog by luring her and pairing her 
cooperation with a word like “Hug.” Reward your dog when she’s in the hug 
position — this method works best for calm dogs who are not prone to 
excessive jumping.
For jumpy dogs, try a more sedate method. Ignore the behavior when she 
jumps all over you and then sit with her and organize it this way:
 
1. Kneel down on the floor or sit in a chair and give your dog the “Sit” 
command.
 
 Check to make sure that your dog is sitting square on the floor, not 
leaning to either side.
 
2. Lift your dog’s front paws gently and place them on your shoulders as 
you say “Hug.”
 
 Give your dog a thorough pet and/or a reward.
 
3. Say “Okay” and help her down.
Do Steps 1 through 3 only three times per session — stop if your dog 
becomes too energetic or starts to nip. Leave the leash on and give a tug on 
the leash as you say “Shhh!” if your dog gets too excited while on two paws. 
Also, try practicing “Hug” when your dog has less energy.
The silent signal for Give Me a Hug is to cross your arms over your chest and 
tap your shoulders with your fingers. You can demonstrate the signal each 
time you say “Hug.” Be patient while teaching this sign language — it may 
take a while for your dog to make the connection.
Kisses!
Getting your dog to give you kisses is a real delight — unless you hate dog 
kisses. You can teach this trick quickly by association, simply saying “Kisses” 
whenever you’re getting a licking.
If your dog is licking out of control, make it more of a two-step process:
 
1. First teach your dog “Enough” to signal him to stop licking.
 
 Keep a short (8- to 12-inch) leash on your dog and say “Enough” in a 
pleasant but serious tone. If your dog doesn’t listen, tug the leash as you 
withdraw your attention.
 
 When discouraging licking, look away and not at your dog. If you look at 
your dog, you’re essentially saying, “Do it again!”

442
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
2. Teach your dog to lick on cue.
 
 To teach your dog to lick you, take a frozen stick of butter and rub it 
on the back of your hand. During a period when your dog is calm, go to 
him, extend your hand, and command “Kisses” as he licks your hand. 
When you’ve had enough, just say so — “Enough!”
 
 To teach your dog to give someone else a kiss, such as the next-door 
neighbor or a member of your audience, use a stick of butter during the 
teaching phase. Ask a few people to help you out, and rub the backs of 
their hands with butter before you instruct your dog to give them a kiss. 
Have them extend their hands to your dog and say “Kisses” as you point 
to the buttered hand. Soon your dog will be seeking out hands to kiss, 
butter coated or not. This trick is handy if you have kids over; putting 
butter on their hands encourages licks, not jumping.
 
When your dog knows the trick, you can add a hand signal: Rub your right 
index finger on the back of your left hand, as though your finger is your dog’s 
tongue.
Introducing Interactive Play
Dogs love to play. The more you can let go and roll with their enthusiasm, 
the more fun you’ll have. Some games, like tug of war and wrestling, inspire 
confrontation, so use the games in this section instead to increase your fun. 
Interactive activities like Hide and Seek and Catch Me can build your bond 
and inspire respect.
Hide and Seek
Hide and Seek is a great game and also reinforces that indispensable “Come” 
command. You need one to four players and a treat cup, and your dog needs 
to know his name and the “Come” command. “Stay” also comes in handy.
Start with this game inside, one-on-one:
 
1. While your dog is occupied, go into an adjoining room with a treat 
cup; call out his name and shake the cup.
 
 Use a disposable plastic cup filled halfway with small treats, such as 
Cheerios.
 
2. When you hear him running, say “Come” clearly.
 
 Praise him, offer a treat, and let him return to whatever he was doing, 
putting the treat cup away — or he may never leave your side.

443
 Chapter 4: Teaching Your Dog Tricks
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
 
3. Increase the level of difficulty by calling him from two rooms away.
 
 You should still be in sight, not hard to find.
 
4. After a couple of days of hiding in plain sight around the house and 
calling from room to room, go into the adjoining room and hide 
behind a chair.
After your dog catches on to this game, you can increase the difficulty of 
your hiding places and add another teammate. Eventually, your two-legged 
geniuses can play a game to see who gets found first and who gets found last. 
Gradually phase off using your treat cups.
Where’s Sally? The name game
Teaching your dog everyone’s name couldn’t be easier. Pick one person at a 
time and have the person sit across the room with a treat cup. Instruct your 
dog to find that person by name. For example, say “Where’s Sally?” and have 
Sally shake the cup the moment she hears her name. Progressively ask Sally 
to distance herself from you, having her in various rooms of the house so 
your dog will always be curious to find her location.
After your dog is eager to track Sally (and her treat cup), reintroduce her 
nearby — but phase off using treats. Sally can call and encourage your dog 
with praise instead. Soon just her name will inspire enthusiasm.
The Shell Game
Dogs love to be included in the Shell Game. Whether you’re sitting at home 
or on an adventure, you can use shells, cups, or even sand piles to hide your 
dog’s treat or toy under one of three stacks. After you shift the stacks about, 
ask your dog, “Where’s your bone?” or “Where’s your toy?” If your dog’s 
confused, pretend to sniff each pile — he’ll copy your example and find the 
bone or toy soon enough.
Catch Me
Games that encourage your dog to focus on and follow you are a real prize 
when it comes to training and having fun. These games also reinforce the 
extinction of bad habits, such as nipping and jumping.
To play Catch Me, a variation of the children’s game Red Light, Green Light, 
you need one or two players and a dog toy. Your dog needs to know “Sit,” 
“Wait,” “Down,” “Stay,” “Okay,” and “No.”

444
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
1. Turn and face your dog from about 3 to 6 feet away; say “Catch me” 
and then turn and run.
 
2. After a few feet, pop back to face your dog and command “Wait!”
 
3. Treat your dog when she stops; then say “Okay, catch me,” and run 
again.
 
4. Now that she’ll stop, try another quick command like “Sit” or “Down,” 
luring your dog into position if she’s confused by the excitement.
 
5. Follow each stationary command with “Okay, catch me” to continue 
the game.
 
6. When you’re through, tell your dog “Okay” and give her a favorite 
toy.
 
 Keep the game short, just one or two minutes.
 
Some dogs get too excited or overwhelmed by this game. If yours isn’t 
cooperating, try a different game. If she goes wild, racing in a big circle 
playing hard to get, guess what — this isn’t the game for you.
Don’t high-energy games encourage mouthing and jumping? If it escalates the 
dog’s bad behavior uncontrollably, leave it out. If your dog enjoys the game 
and you can curb naughtiness with a sharp “No,” then go for it. Catch Me is a 
fun activity and sharpens your dog’s impulses, teaching her to follow — but 
not jump or nip at you.
Digging for China
Have you considered hiring your dog out to the local excavating company? 
The prerequisite, of course, is to teach him to dig on command. Equip 
yourself with a clicker, garden gloves, and treats, and then follow these 
directions to play Digging for China:
 
1. Find a private area in your yard to teach your dog to dig; bury some 
treats 1 inch under the ground to pique his interest.
 
2. Start blissfully digging yourself, unearthing the treats as you go and 
handing them to your dog.
 
3. Reward your dog for joining in, saying “Go dig!”
 
4. Now try hiding a few treats or a toy before bringing your dog to his 
digging spot; then give the command “Go dig.”
 
 Like an archeologist discovering treasures, he’ll unearth them with 
obvious delight.
You may be worried that without your approval, your dog will unearth your 
shrubbery and carpets. However, although there’s no guarantee, most dogs 

445
 Chapter 4: Teaching Your Dog Tricks
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
who are reinforced for digging in one area usually stick to it. By teaching 
your dog to dig in specific locations, you may be able to discourage him from 
digging in other places.
Playing with the Plain Ol’ Paw
Nothing like starting with a classic: Giving a paw. Some dogs are naturally 
predisposed to giving a paw, so much so that you’re probably wondering 
how to teach “No paw” (see the sidebar “Getting dogs to keep their paws to 
themselves”).
After your dog masters “Paw,” you can really start being creative, teaching 
her to wave, give high fives, and turn out the lights. But everyone’s got to get 
started somewhere — after you master the basic “Paw,” the sky’s the limit.
Doing the basic Paw
To teach the basic “Paw,” first get your dog (on a leash if he’s antsy) and 
some favorite treats, and go into a quiet room. Then do the following:
 
1. Kneel or sit in front of your dog.
 
2. Command “Sit,” positioning your dog’s hindquarters if necessary, and 
offer praise.
 
3. You can try two methods at this point:
 
• Physical: Using a thumb, press your dog’s shoulder muscle gently 
until his front leg lifts. Then lay your hand under his foot pad as 
you say “Paw.”
 
• Treat-based: Hold a treat in a closed hand a couple of inches 
in front of your dog’s foot. When he paws it, open your hand to 
reward him. With each repetition of this step, gradually raise your 
hand to your dog’s elbow. Now add the Paw step. Keep the treat in 
your other hand, as you extend your closed hand. As he hits your 
hand, say “Paw” and gently grasp his paw with an opened palm. 
Treat him the moment your palm connects to his paw.
 
4. Now signal and command “Paw.”
 
 Is he catching on? If not, help him complete the Paw by pressing his 
shoulder blade gently. Praise him warmly, whether he caught on or 
needed your help.
The hand signal for Paw is to stretch out your hand, as if to shake hands.

446
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Paw variations: Shaking things up
Shaking paws is great, but you can easily teach a few variations that will 
delight you, your pup, and any onlookers. In this section, you find some new 
cue words and variations on the basic Paw.
Say Thank You
Hold out your hand as if to shake hands. At first, say, “Paw — Thank you.” 
Fairly soon she’ll respond to both your signal and your new directional cue. 
Praise your dog for placing her paw in your hand and give her a treat.
Now get a human pal to help you out. As your human pal extends a hand, 
command “Paw — Say thank you” and encourage your dog to offer her 
paw to your friend. Now you’re ready to spread your dog’s good manners 
everywhere.
The hand signal for Say Thank You is the same as for the Paw trick — extend 
your hand to the dog with your palm up.
Wave
A dog who knows how to wave hello and goodbye — miraculous, you say? 
Actually, it’s not hard to teach at all. Here’s how:
 
1. Place your dog in a sit-stay and show her that you have a treat in your 
left hand.
 
2. Standing in front of her, say, “Paw” and signal with your right hand 
(as if you were going to shake hands).
 
3. As she lifts her paw, wave your signal hand and say “Paw — Wave” as 
you reward her with the treat.
 
4. Repeat this, slowly weaning off the initial Paw signal in place of a 
wave signal, simply waving to your dog while saying, “Wave hello” or 
“Wave bye-bye!”
Other One
As your dog gets into the Paw trick, you may notice that he favors eitherhis 
left or right paw. To prevent having a one-dimensional dog, teach the cue 
Other One. Here’s how:

447
 Chapter 4: Teaching Your Dog Tricks
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
 
1. Say “Paw” and lovingly praise your dog when he raises his paw.
 
2. Extend your hand to the other paw and say, “Other one,” using the 
treat-on-on-the-floor trick or shoulder press to inspire hiscooperation.
 
 Hold the treat in a closed hand a couple of inches in front of your dog’s 
foot until he paws it, or press the shoulder muscle gently with your 
thumb until he lifts his paw, as described earlier in the section “Doing 
the basic Paw.”
 
3. If your dog lifts his favored paw, use a sound such as “Nope” and 
repeat your original request while you put pressure on the shoulder 
muscle of the other leg.
 
 When your dog lifts the other paw, praise, treat, and give him a big hug 
(if your dog likes that sort of thing).
The hand signal for Other One is to stretch out your hand to the specified paw.
Right Paw, Left Paw
By using Other One to get your dog to pay attention to which hand you 
extend, you can pull off a trick that makes it seem as if your dog can tell her 
right paw from her left, the little genius!
While in a quiet room, decide which paw your dog gives most frequently. For 
this example, say it’s the right paw. Exaggerate the Paw hand signal as you 
hold your right hand to her right side and say, “Right paw.” Praise and offer 
a treat. Have your dog do this right three times in a row so she gets plenty of 
positive reinforcement. If by chance your dog swaps and offers a left paw, say 
“Nope” and wait to reward until she offers the right paw.
Now for the other paw. Exaggerate your hand signal toward the left side and 
say “Left paw.” Your dog will probably try the right paw. If she does, say 
“Nope — Other One.” Show her physically if you have to. Practice three lefts, 
and then stop.
The next time you go to practice, start with “Right paw,” accentuating your 
signal. Help your dog out if you must. Do three rights; then three lefts, 
accentuating the left signal. Soon your dog will catch on, and you can mix it 
up: two rights, two lefts, two rights, one left, one right, and so on. Vary the 
pattern each time and keep these mind-puzzler sessions short. As your dog 
becomes clued in to your body language, you can exaggerate the hand signal 
less and less.

Celebrating success: High Five 
and Go for Ten
Getting your dog to give you five — or ten — is easy to teach, and dogs love 
it. Afterward, you’ll both have something to celebrate. Here’s how these 
tricks work:
 
 High Five: To teach High Five, simply hold your hand palm out at the 
same height you normally do when you say, “Paw.” If the command High 
Five gets a puzzled look, then say, “Paw” to request the action and say, 
“High Five” as the dog’s paw makes contact with your hand. Drop the 
Paw command when your dog makes the connection. Slowly lift your 
hand higher to accentuate the High Five.
 
 When asking for the High Five, stay within your dog’s height capabilities. 
If you hold your hand too high, your dog will leap up to try to please 
you, but you don’t want to encourage jumping. High Five is a three-
paws-on-the-floor trick.
 
 Go for Ten: This trick involves two hands and two paws. When saying 
“Go for ten,” keep your hands at about the level of your dog’s head. Any 
higher will encourage jumping. At first your dog may only reach up to 
hit you with one paw . . . after all, that’s what he’s used to. Reaching 
up will encourage him to stretch up and bring his other paw off the 
floor — at this point, tuck your free hand under his paw and praise him 
the moment both paws connect with your hands.
 
 Some dogs simply can’t sit up on their hind legs. You know if your dog 
can’t do Go for Ten. So what? You love him anyway.
Hit It! Targeting paw tricks with 
lights, doors, and music
After your dog knows how to Paw, you can teach her to target an object and 
then use the object’s placement to help her learn to play music, close doors, 
and work the light fixtures . . . before you know it, your dog will be saving you 
a bundle in electric bills.
Hit It
After your dog knows Paw (see the earlier section, “Doing the basic Paw”), 
establish a target object, such as a container lid or business card. Then do 
the following to teach your dog to strike it with his paw:

449
 Chapter 4: Teaching Your Dog Tricks
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
 
1. Present the target object in the palm of your hand and command 
“Paw.”
 
2. The moment your dog hits the object, say, “Hit It”; give your dog a 
treat (or click and treat) and offer praise.
 
3. Phase off holding the object flat in your hand, holding it at the same 
level but pinched between your thumb and forefinger.
 
 Repeat this until you’re able to hold the object out and your dog will 
paw it when directed with the Hit It command.
Your next goal is to place the object in various locations to encourage 
your dog to do things like turn out the lights and close doors. This section 
includes three tricks that do just that.
Close It
After your dog learns how to Hit It, you can parlay that one behavior into a 
whole host of cool, helpful, and unique tricks, such as closing the cabinet, 
turning out the lights, and playing the piano! Though these tricks might 
sound like magic, it all boils down to the placement of the target object.
When teaching your dog to close cabinets and doors, she may be initially 
startled by the sound the door makes as it shuts. Before asking her to tidy 
up for you, place her in a Sit-Stay next to the hinge and give her a treat as 
you open and shut the door gently. She will soon get used to the sound of its 
opening and shutting.
At first, hold the target object near a cabinet door at what would be a normal 
Paw level for your dog — about her elbow. Do a couple Paws (see the earlier 
section, “Doing the basic Paw”), holding your hand near the door. Next, 
encourage her to paw the object by saying “Hit it.” If she has a light touch, 
encourage her to really whack the object by egging her on and withholding 
the reward until she does.
Next, tape the object to the outside of the opened cabinet door. Kneel close 
to your dog and point to the object. Reward each attempt to strike the door 
with her paw. After two days, withhold the reward until a successful closing.
Over the course of four days, gradually start combining the new command 
with the familiar cue: Hit It — Close It. Phase out the Hit It command so Close 
It will mean just that.
Lights
Teaching your dog to turn out the lights requires blending the Hit It command 
with a jumping sequence. If your dog is tall and agile enough to reach the 
switch, he’ll be more than happy to oblige you.

450
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
To begin, get a light switch like the ones on your wall. Use your target object 
to teach your dog to Paw It and to get comfortable with its feel. Tape the 
target object above the fixture and hold the fixture in your hand initially.
At first, hold the switch at a normal Paw level — about your dog’s elbow —
and pair the command Hit It with “Lights” as you encourage his cooperation 
with praise and rewards. This will seem awkward at first for your dog, who 
isn’t used to things moving when he paws them. Use your praise to encourage 
him and rewards to emphasize the moment his paw connects with the 
switch.
Separately teach your dog to jump up on the wall by the switch. Pat the wall 
and teach Up, guiding your dog there with a treat if necessary. At first, all 
your dog needs to do to earn a reward is jump up and stand against the wall.
Gradually lift your practice switch higher and higher until it’s at the height 
of the real switch. Each time, prompt your dog with the command Hit It — 
Lights. At first, reward and praise your dog if he touches the switch. After 
four days of practice, reward him only if he activates the switch. When he’s 
got it down pat, phase off the Hit It command and emphasize Lights.
Now that you’ve connected the dots, try this trick in the real world. Move to 
other switches in your home, using the pretend switch step if your dog acts 
confused.
Piano
All you need to teach your dog to play the piano is a keyboard, a target 
object, and the Paw command. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Teach your dog to paw a target object.
 
 See the earlier section, “Hit it: Targeting paw tricks with lights, doors, 
and music.”
 
2. Place the keyboard on the ground and place your target object on it.
 
3. Pair the command Hit It with “Piano.”
 
4. Move the object to various spots on the piano.
The hand signal for this trick is to pretend your fingers are tapping an 
imaginary keyboard.

Roll Over
Dogs who are as comfortable on their backs as they are on their paws really 
groove with Roll Over. How will you know whether your dog qualifies? He’ll 
roll anywhere, anytime, and often of his own volition.He’ll sleep on his back. 
He’ll scratch his back by rolling on the carpet. He’ll come in with a grass-
stained coat from rolling in the yard.
Although teaching Roll Over requires some patience, it demonstrates the 
importance of sequencing — breaking the sum of a trick into parts and then 
linking the parts to perform the trick.
Before you begin, bring your dog into a quiet room and place treats on a 
nearby table. Find your clicker if you’re using one. Here are the three training 
sequences:
 
1. First sequence: Call your dog to you and put him in a Down-Stay. Kneel 
next to your dog and scratch his belly until he lies on one side. As he 
does so, say, “Roll”; then reward and praise him. Repeat this sequence 
10 to 20 times until your dog responds comfortably to this direction.
 
2. Second sequence: Repeat the preceding steps. Then take a treat and 
circle it from under your dog’s chin to just behind his ear. As his head 
twists to follow the treat, his body will rock to the side. Say, “Roll,” offer 
a treat, and praise him. Repeat this sequence 10 to 20 times until your 
dog responds quickly.
Getting dogs to keep their paws to themselves
Is your dog too paw-expressive? It happens to 
the best of them. If your dog constantly paws, 
you have two options: Ignore her, or use a mild 
correction. Ignoring is self-explanatory; you 
may simply walk away. If that doesn’t work, try 
one of the following corrections:
  Keep a short tab (a very short loop of leash) 
on your dog and snap it downward while 
saying, “Not now.” (You can buy a short 
lead — 8 to 12 inches — at a pet supply 
store.)
  Say “No” and command “Sit.”
Remember that dogs usually paw because they 
want something: a treat, a toy, or attention. 
Avoid giving in to your dog’s pestering. You’re 
just teaching her that it works. Wait for more 
mannerly behavior, such as sitting quietly or 
lying down, before you give your dog what she 
wants.

452
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
3. Final sequence: Repeat the preceding steps. Now circle the treat slowly 
backward over the back of your dog’s head as you say, “Roll Over.”
 
 When your dog is first learning to roll over, he may need some help. 
Guide him over by gently pushing his top front leg to the other side as 
you say the command.
 
 Click (or say “Yes!”) and give your dog a treat whenever he does a full 
roll, whether you helped your dog or not.
As soon as your dog gets the full roll sequence, practice a few times and then 
quit on a high note.
Roll Over with a hand signal
When your dog is comfortable rolling over, you can teach a simple hand 
signal to prompt this trick:
 
1. Continue to kneel next to her when commanding “Roll Over,” but 
lean backward in the direction you want her to roll.
 
2. Hold your index finger parallel to the floor, and draw small circles in 
the air as you give your verbal command.
 
3. Help your dog initially if she seems confused, praising her as you 
assist and jumping up with her to end the trick.
 
4. As soon as she responds to the cue without your help, stand up and 
give the command and the hand signal, always accentuating your 
hand signal.
 
 Your end goal is to direct your dog from a standing position. Gradually 
move up from a kneeling position to a one-kneed bend to eventually 
standing up, as you overaccentuate your hand signal.
After your dog seems able to follow the command, you can teach her to keep 
on rolling or to jump up after the first roll. Using enthusiastic body language, 
you can easily communicate when you want your dog to jump up. Toss your 
arms in the air and jump like a bunny when you’re encouraging your dog to 
leap up.
If you want your dog to continue rolling, lean in the direction she’s rolling 
and exaggerate your signal initially.
Pump your clenched fist in an enthusiastic hooray to signal your finishing roll!
Roll Over from a distance
When your dog knows the hand signal — drawing circles in the air with your 
index finger — you’re ready for control at a distance. Here’s how to cue your 
dog to roll from farther away:

453
 Chapter 4: Teaching Your Dog Tricks
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
 
1. Place your dog in a Down-Stay and stand back 3 feet.
 
2. Use your hand signal, leaning your body in the direction you’re 
sending your dog, as you command “Roll Over.”
 
 If your dog looks confused, go to him calmly and help out, getting back 
into your starting position as he finishes the trick.
 
 When he performs on his own, give him a jackpot — a whole fistful — of 
treats and end with a fun game.
 
3. Back up 2 feet at a time during your subsequent practice sessions, 
until your dog will roll over at a reasonable distance from you.
Visualization helps you teach a trick, so create a picture in your mind of your 
dog performing the trick flawlessly. Can dogs read minds? Who can prove 
they can’t?
Ain’t Too Proud to Beg
“Beg,” “Ask nicely,” “Put up your paws” — take your pick of a verbal 
command — they all mean the same thing! Getting your dog to sit up on 
her back legs (or haunches) is a real charmer. Some dogs come by this trick 
fairly easily. Others aren’t as coordinated and need help up. Either way, this 
section explains how to teach your dog to beg.
The naturals: Teaching the art of begging
Some dogs are born beggars. Your dog may have even discovered the begging 
trick by himself during one of his more-successful ploys to get attention. If 
your dog is a natural beggar, praise him each time he offers you the begging 
behavior. Soon you’ll have a smart aleck on your hands who sits up at every 
opportunity, and you’ll have no trouble getting him to beg on cue.
Here’s how to teach the begging trick:
 
1. Command “Sit” and make sure that the dog is sitting squarely (not 
leaning to either side).
 
 If your dog is relatively coordinated but often gets a little too excited 
about food rewards —he’s jumping, turning inside out, and basically 
unable to sit still — make him part of the “Corner Crew”: Start the dog 
out in a corner of the room to help him feel more secure. Tuck his back 
end toward the wall. The walls on either side help limit and guide his 
movements. If he’s super-excited, practice when his energy is lower, 
such as late in the evening or after a good romp.

2. Take a treat and hold it an inch above his nose.
 
3. As he stretches to sniff the treat, bring it back slowly between his ears 
as you command, “Ask Nicely.”
 
 The dog should rise up to follow the path of the treat.
 
4. Click (or say “Yes!”) and reward the dog’s split-second attempt to sit up.
 
 After he catches on, hold out on rewarding treats for performances that 
are more balanced.
 
The hand signal for this trick is to move your palm upward, facing the sky. 
Start your hand at your hip and move it to your chest level.
Bowser bracers: Begging for a little help
If your dog is not that, uh, coordinated, you need to be a more active 
participant in the learning phase of begging. Try this approach:
 
1. Sit your dog squarely (not leaning to either side) and instruct “Stay.”
 
 Stand directly behind her tail with your heels together and your toes out 
to either side of her spine.
 
2. Hold a treat above her nose and bring it upward and back toward 
her ear.
 
3. Give the command “Ask nicely,” and as your dog begins to rise, brace 
her back with your legs for support.
 
4. Click (or say “Yes!”) and reward the slightest lift.
 
 Gradually hold out for routines that are more balanced (though still 
supported).
 
5. When you see that she can balance well with your help, try supporting 
the dog with just your knees.
 
 Eventually, she’ll perfect a steady balance while supported by your 
knees.
 
6. Withdraw your support in increments until you’re just standing there 
cheering your pal on.
 
 Fairly soon, you can begin to step away. See how she shines!

Expanding Your Repertoire 
with Stretching Tricks
Stretching is a simple trick to teach because you can reinforce it simply by 
catching your dog in the act. Of course, you can build on the simple stretch 
technique in this section and get your dog to even take a bow after he’s done 
performing.
Super stretching
Certain tricks don’t involve more than catching your dog acting normally and 
attaching a cue word to the behavior. The Stretch trick is one of these. To 
teach your dog the “Stretch” command, just follow these easy steps:
 
1. Watch your dog as she wakes up, is excited in play, or is preparing to 
rest.
 
2. Use the command word “Stretch” as she stretches forward.
 
3. Praise and reward her enthusiastically.
Taking a Bow
Of course, no performance is complete without a bow. To teach your dog to 
bow, utilize all three of the following approaches. Soon all of them will meld 
together and your dog will be dazzling his audience to the very end of the act.
 
 Caught in the act: Whenever you catch your dog stretching his front 
paws with his bum in the air, command “Bow” as you flip twirl your arm 
out for a signal. Praise enthusiastically.
 
 Or if your dog’s feeling spunky and playful and crouches on his front 
legs with his bottom in the air, take a bow as you command “Bow.” 
Praise enthusiastically and reward him with his favorite game.
 
 Jury-rigged: Take your dog aside into a quiet room with some favorite 
treats and a clicker if you have one. Hold his belly up as you hold the 
treat to the ground, just in front of his paws, and command “Bow.” 
Slowly fade off the belly hold, simply using the cue word Bow.

456
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
 Smush face: In a quiet room, take a treat and hold it against your dog’s 
nose. Press the treat gently back and downward, thus encouraging your 
dog to bend forward on his elbows to get the reward. As he does, say 
“Bow” and reward him!
 
Other cues words besides Bow fit the stretching behavior just as well. Your 
dog can learn multiple words for the same behavior. Just make sure that you 
start with one command cue before adding others, and always use the same 
hand signal.

I
n an introductory agility class, you find out how to direct your dog 
through a simple agility course, navigating obstacles with commands and 
body cues. This chapter gives you an overview of some of the obstacles in an 
agility course and prepares you for the adventures that lie ahead. If you want 
to pursue teaching more tricks, check out Dog Tricks and Agility For Dummies 
by Sarah Hodgson (Wiley).
Planning for a Good Training Session
After you’ve decided to take the plunge into agility, you’ll be sharing the 
journey with other participants in various stages of learning. Some will be 
way ahead of you, making you feel like an eternal freshman. But in time, you’ll 
find yourself lending a hand to a new team, and you’ll realize — “Hey! We’re 
getting somewhere!”
 
In the meantime, keep the following advice in mind as you get started:
 
 Make it simple. Many of the obstacles have adjustable heights, so start 
at the lowest position. This ensures your dog’s safety and success.
 
 Find a helper. Many introductory steps require an extra set of hands. 
Partner up with another newbie, and you’ll be doing each other a favor.

458
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
 Use leash control to start. Keep your dog on leash in the beginning, and 
listen to your instructor. Think of holding the leash as holding a child’s 
hand: In the early days of agility, it will make you both feel more secure. 
Your dog will need to be off leash eventually to execute the course, but 
the leash is helpful when directing your dog in the early stages. Wait 
until your dog really understands the program and your instructor tells 
you it’s okay to go off leash.
 
 Keep your lessons short and sweet. If you’re taking a group class, 
chunks of time will be spent listening to your instructor and taking turns 
with the various participants. Your dog won’t be “on” for long stretches 
of time. If you’re practicing on your own, a good rule of thumb is to do 
three to five repetitions on no more than three obstacles. Use lots of 
treats and end each practice session with a game. Though every dog is 
different, and some breeds or personality types might enjoy hours of 
practice, these dogs are the exception — most dogs burn out (physically 
and mentally) when pressed to perform.
 
 Stay positive. Throughout the learning phase, you’ll have days where 
you feel confused and awkward. Confusion is a little contagious, and 
your dog may catch it like a cold. She’ll show her confusion by acting up 
or racing around. If you compound the problem by showing frustration, 
your dog will misunderstand your displeasure and begin to associate it 
with the equipment or the activity. She’ll want to go home, where 
everything is predictable and safe.
 
 Listen to your dog. Some days, everything will be going right. Your 
dog will be eager, your signals will be crystal clear, and the sun will 
be shining. Other days, your dog will bolt, your knees will hurt, and 
everything will be just . . . muddy. On those days, lighten your practice 
load: Simplify the routine, end on a high note, and toss in the towel until 
another day.
 
 As you practice, be mindful of your dog’s stress signals. Repetitive 
motions such as scratching, lip-licking, and barking can be a sign that 
your dog is losing focus or has overexerted herself. If you’ve just started 
your practice session, see whether a walk, ball toss, or some soothing 
pats will get her on track. If you’ve been out on the course a while or the 
weather is extreme, go home and chill. No one — dog or person — likes 
to be pushed beyond their limits.
 
 Have fun. Agility is about having fun and being together. Repeat it 
like a mantra — “Having fun and being together. Having fun and being 
together!”
 
 Keep it slow and simple, and smile! Remember the three-part cardinal 
rule when introducing any new obstacle: Keep it slow and simple, and 
don’t forget to smile!

The Jumps: Taking a First Leap 
into Agility Training
Most dogs love to jump. Teaching them to do it on command can be the 
easiest step in agility, but there’s more to a good jumper than meets the eye. 
Dogs must not only clear the object but also be able to take a jump at any 
angle and land squarely.
This section gives you advice on setting up the jumps for training. It also 
explains how to get your dog used to clearing obstacles — at your direction — 
in different combinations and from various angles. Finally, you get some 
quick tips for tackling the specific kinds of jumps you’ll see in an agility trial.
Setting up the jumps for training
 
Regardless of competition jumping heights, set your jumps very low for 
training purposes. Make each one easy to clear and fun to do. A jump for a 
novice jumper should be below the dog’s elbow. Got a toy breed? Set the bar 
on the ground to start. When arranging a set of jumps, leave enough space 
between them for a proper five-stride approach and a clear landing.
 
Repetitive stress on your dog’s body increases the risk of injury.
As you and your dog get more comfortable with the jumps, you should vary 
the height to keep your dog ever mindful of the jump set in front of him. 
Lower the jump during routine practice or on days when the workout is 
demanding.
Going over: Making the jumps
To teach your dog the agility jumps, you follow a step-by-step process that 
ends with your ability to direct your dog to any jump from various locations 
on the field.
Step 1: Calling your dog over the jump
Your dog’s first introduction to jumping should be easy and fun. Set up a low 
jump, say “Over,” and trot over the jump with your dog. As you move with 
her, try to get a feel for her movement — ideally give her five full strides to 
clear the jump and three more when she lands before interrupting her 
movement. Praise and reward her enthusiasm.

460
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Now you’re ready to have her jump on her own:
 
1. Have your helper stand and hold your dog in front of the jump as you 
walk to the far side of the jump.
 
 Stand, but don’t turn around and face her.
 
2. Twist back and make eye contact with your dog; wave a toy or treat 
cup from the hand on the same side.
 
3. Call, “Over — Come,” as your helper releases your dog.
 
4. Click or call out a praise word like “Yes!” as your dog clears the jump.
 
 Reward and praise your dog from the side you’ve twisted from when she 
reaches you.
 
Practice twisting, calling, and rewarding your dog from either side. This 
conditions her to move toward either the right or the left side as you indicate, 
which will become important as you sequence to other prepositioned 
obstacles.
Step 2: Running alongside
Next, your dog will learn to take jumps as you run alongside him next to the 
jump. Here’s how to accomplish this step in jump-training:
 
1. Hold your dog in front of the jump and let him watch your helper 
execute the next step.
 
2. Ask your partner to walk ahead of you, indiscreetly placing a toy or 
treat on the far side of the jump.
 
 Place the reward several strides past the jump to allow your dog to land 
squarely. Have your helper ready to remove it in case your dog races 
around the jump.
 
3. Release your dog as you say “Over!” and run with him toward the 
jump. Let him run just ahead of you and take the jump as you navigate 
to either side of the jump.
 
 As you shout “Over,” signal, too, with an exaggerated bowling motion 
directed at the jump. Your signal arm should be closest to the jump.
 
4. Click or shout your praise as your dog clears the jump.
 
 As he lands, let him enjoy his reward and/or break for a favorite game!
 
 If your dog runs around the jump, have your helper remove the reward 
quickly. Calmly return your dog to his starting position, and show him 
the baited target before you release him. If he still dodges the jump, try 
trotting over the jump with him to let him see the reward, but don’t let 
him have it until he’s cleared the jump on his own.

461
 Chapter 5: The Ins and Outs of Agility Training
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
Practice running and signaling from both directions. You dog should be 
comfortable jumping with you strategically positioned anywhere on the field.
Step 3: Encouraging your dog to run ahead
The term Velcro dog refers to a dog who clings to her owner and can’t think 
well or enthusiastically on her own. Although your dog’s affections may 
reassure you, discourage overdependence by teaching her to go forward and 
tackle life . . . one obstacle at a time.
Set the jump very low or lay it on the ground. Then follow these steps:
 
1. Have your helper set the lure just beyond the jump or set the target on 
the other side of the jump yourself.
 
2. Send your dog out with “Go on over” as you let her go.
 
 Click or mark the moment she clears the jump. If your dog races around 
the jump, have your helper remove the reward before she reaches it.
 
3. Follow your dog past the obstacle and then turn to play with, praise, 
and reward her for her efforts.
Phase out placing the target on the far side of the jump. But don’t forget to 
praise and reward your dog enthusiastically when she clears the jump.
Step 4: Setting up multiple jumps
Now you’re ready for multiple jumps. Lay them out in a direct line, allowing 
your dog five paces between each one.
Go back to Step 1, working with your assistant to help your dog understand 
your new focus. Place the treat at the end of the jump sequence and keep the 
hurdles low to ensure success and safety.
Step 5: Adding angles
Enter “dog agility” in the search box on YouTube (www.youtube.com), and 
watch a competitive run. Notice how each jump’s placement sets up the 
overall performance.
Before you think sequencing, however, practice your jumps one at a time. 
Teach your dog how to approach and clear each one from any angle, as you 
encourage him to watch you for direction. Send or run your dog over jumps 
at different angles, varying your position to the left or the right to simulate a 
competitive agility experience.

462
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Working on specific types of jumps
A professional course includes many different types of jumps. Here are some 
tips on approaching specific kinds of jumps:
 
 Single jump and panel jump: These jumps are straightforward: A single 
bar or flat, wall-like board is positioned for your dog to jump over. Your 
main goal is to build your dog’s success rate and enthusiasm so she 
doesn’t become a “bar knocker.” Dogs who clip the jump or dislodge a 
bar lose points or, worse, are disqualified in competition.
 
 Keep the jumps low, giving your dog room to clear each one. Positively 
reward each step of this learning phase. Your enthusiasm and patience 
will ensure that your dog learns to jump high and clear.
 
 Spread jump: Spread jumps are a spread-out arrangement of several 
ascending bar jumps that your dog must clear. When practicing, keep 
the bars low to ensure your dog’s success every step of the way.
 
 Broad jump: These low, angled boards are spread out on the ground to 
simulate a wide environmental obstacle that your dog must jump over. If 
you’re experienced in trial obedience, you’ll notice the similarity.
 
 Tip the boards on edge so they’re progressively more pronounced and 
harder to walk over. After your dog is jumping up and across them, you 
can lay them down one at a time, back to front, till the series is laid flat.
 
 If your dog hits the boards, try laying an uncomfortable surface over 
them, such as chicken wire.
 
 Tire: A “tire” obstacle is usually an elaborate hoop suspended in a 
wooden frame. This jump may jar your dog’s concentration. When first 
introducing the tire, make sure that it’s braced tightly to prevent both 
motion and sound as your dog acclimates to it. Stay positive, and use 
plenty of tantalizing food lures and toys. Lower the tire to floor level and 
kneel down as you bait your dog to come through the circle.
 
 If your dog’s still resistant, use a leash to steady her and lead her 
through. Toss a toy or treat ahead of her, or let her watch a favorite 
friend manage the obstacle. Leash her and cheerfully guide her through 
several times. After she’s coming through when you call her, raise the 
tire slightly. Good with that? Go back and practice Steps 1 through 4 in 
“Going over: Making the jumps.”
 
 Never force your dog through this obstacle. Frustration will ensure one 
thing: She’ll never get near a hoop again. Watch your temper.

Going Through Tunnels
The difficulty here isn’t so much teaching a dog to run through a tunnel as it 
is teaching him to avoid it to work on other obstacles.
There are two different types of tunnels:
 
 Open-ended: A 15- to 20-foot-long open-ended tunnel that can be 
positioned straight or curved
 
 Closed: A 12- to 15-foot-long closed tunnel or chute with a barrel opening 
and a collapsible fabric tail that a dog must push through to get out
Make sure that each tunnel is secured: Flexible tie-downs are best. You can 
make one with an overlying strap or tether that’s affixed to sand-filled water 
jugs on either side. Dogs who love the tunnels are called tunnel suckers. 
Introducing open-ended tunnels
Begin training on the straight, open-ended tunnel. Let your dog explore the 
tunnel as you walk along the outside of it together. Look down the hollow as 
though you were exploring a cave. If your dog grows wary, avoid looking at 
or reassuring her — your attention will reinforce her concern. Instead, crawl 
into the opening in sheer amazement, rewarding any sign of confidence.
Two unusual-looking tunnels are used to compete for UKC titles. The hoop 
tunnel and crawl tunnel are open frames that your dog must navigate in the 
same way she moves through the tunnels discussed in the following sections.
 
When practicing your tunnel runs, direct your dog from both the right and 
left side. Later, your position will help orient her toward the next obstacle.
Step 1: Calling your dog through
Ask a helper to assist you. If possible, scrunch up the tunnel to shorten its 
length. Then proceed as follows:
 
1. Ask your helper to hold your dog at the mouth of the tunnel.
 
2. Walk around to the opposite end, kneel down, and wave toys or treats 
as you call out to your dog.

464
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
3. Have your helper release your dog when you shout, “Tunnel!”
 
 If your dog shoots through, reward and praise him enthusiastically. If he 
balks, stay calm and do whatever it takes to fan his enthusiasm . . . find 
more tasty treats, use a host of favorite toys, or position his favorite dog 
friend at the far end of the tunnel.
Super-sized tall breeds will need to scrunch to get into the large tunnel. To 
encourage your large breed into the tunnel, make it as short as possible. Lure 
him in with a tantalizing treat or favorite toy.
Step 2: Running alongside
The next step is to teach your dog to run through the tunnel as you run 
alongside it.
 
1. Set up and secure the tunnel in a straight line.
 
2. Hold your dog at the mouth of the tunnel while your helper maneuvers 
to the far end with a baited target.
 
 When your helper has your dog’s attention, ask him to set the target on 
the ground.
 
3. Release your dog, saying “Tunnel!” with enthusiasm. Thrust the arm 
closest to your dog forward in a bowling motion.
 
 If your dog ducks in, run alongside her, cheering her on as you do so 
she can better orient herself to your position as she exits. Reward her 
enthusiastically. If your dog runs around the tunnel or is confused, ask 
your helper to remove the reward, ignore her, and start over again.
 
Practice running along both sides of the tunnel. As you learn sequencing, the 
side you’ll stand on will depend on the location of the other obstacles.
 
This obstacle is very, very exciting. Some dogs get wound up and forget their 
manners. To help ground your dog, let her drag a light leash. Should she start 
to zoom off, you’ll have an easy way to stop her. Laugh it off; then up the 
quality of your food rewards or practice just before mealtime.
Step 3: Sending your dog out
Next, you teach your dog to race ahead of you to take the tunnel:
 
1. Keep the tunnel straight and shortened.
 
2. Stand way back, and run toward the tunnel saying “Go on–Tunnel!”
 
3. Slow your pace so that your dog gets ahead of you.
 
4. Ask a friend to toss a treat pouch or a toy to your dog as he emerges 
from the tunnel (or, if you’re fast enough, greet him yourself!).

The chute: Introducing closed tunnels
The closed tunnel is slightly more complicated than the open version. Here 
your dog must run into an open barrel without being able to see her way out. 
What’s blocking her view? A collapsed fabric tail, known as the chute. 
 
Make sure that your dog doesn’t get tangled in the chute. Fluff it before and 
after each use.
Getting your dog to navigate a closed tunnel is similar to the preceding 
section on open-ended tunnels, but with the following variations.
Step 1: Variations on the call-through
If possible, get your dog used to going through the tunnel without the cloth 
section attached. Remove the cloth section and call your dog through the 
barrel. Repeat Steps 1 through 3 as outlined in the previous section on open 
tunnels. When your dog’s familiar with the equipment, place the collapsible 
section on the barrel and proceed:
 
1. Fold the fabric section back like a pant cuff, making it as short as 
possible.
 
2. Hold the fabric open so that your dog is able to see through the 
tunnel.
 
3. Have your helper hold your dog back; then call your dog through as 
described in the earlier section, “Step 1: Calling your dog through.”
 
 Praise and reward him enthusiastically as soon as he enters the chute.
 
4. After your dog is confidently racing through the tunnel, drop the 
fabric on his back gently as he exits the chute.
 
5. Gradually drop it earlier and earlier — using your cheerful enthusiasm 
to reassure him that everything is okay.
Some dogs freak out when the chute covers their head. Delay this as long as 
possible — when you’re first dropping the fabric, make sure that it doesn’t 
cover his eyes.
 
You can practice a game of peek-a-boo with a lightweight towel and some 
favorite treats. Toss the towel over your dog’s head and say, “Peek-a-boo,” as 
you whisk it off and reward her.
Step 2: Variations on running alongside
Here you repeat Step 1, but you enlist the help of a friend, freeing you to run 
alongside your dog.

466
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
1. Ask your friend to fold back and hold the chute open.
 
2. Have her wave the baited target so your dog sees it, and then drop it 
on the ground at the end of the opening.
 
3. Shout “Chute” and signal with your full-arm swing (the bowling 
motion) as you release your dog and let her race through.
 
4. Run out to meet and congratulate your dog with praise and play.
 
5. Have your friend lengthen and drop the fabric as you did in the 
preceding section.
 
Run on either side of the chute to condition your dog to locate you as he 
moves through.
Step 3: Variations on sending your dog out
When your dog is comfortable moving through the chute, you’re ready for 
the last step. Ask your friend to hold the tunnel open for the first send-outs.
 
1. Stand back and run toward the tunnel, shouting “Go on — Chute” as 
you signal and release your dog from your grasp.
 
2. Slow your pace to let her race on ahead of you.
 
3. Ask your helper to toss a toy or treat bag down so that your dog is 
rewarded the moment she emerges.
 
 Alternatively, run alongside the chute and do this yourself. When you 
reach your dog, play with and reward her some more.
Modifying tunnel positions
In competition, your dog will have to navigate the tunnel on-course. At higher 
levels, the open tunnel may be curved so that your dog will have to run to 
an opening that’s out of sight. Here are a couple exercises to challenge your 
dog’s tunnel comprehension:
 
 Curved open tunnel: Curve the tunnel, both to the left and right. Send 
your dog from either side, conditioning him to take your direction from 
anywhere on the field.
 
 Hidden opening: From the same curved layout, gradually angle back 
away from the curve so you’re sending your dog around the tunnel 
to enter it. Use dramatic bowling signals to urge your dog to navigate 
around to the opening. Toss a toy/treat out as he races through. Bend 
the tunnel the other way and work the same exercise from the opposite 
side.

Waiting on Tables
The table obstacle tests your dog’s ability to put on the brakes. While the 
rest of the agility course is pure form, function, and speed, the table is the 
one obstacle where your dog must come to a complete stop and hold a 
specific position for a full five seconds.
If you’re planning on getting some equipment to practice at home, put “table” 
near the top of your list. Why? The skills you teach here have side benefits 
in everyday life: For instance, when the doorbell rings or your dog sees a 
squirrel, the table can help ground your overstimulated dog. A dog who 
has mastered the table has been taught the obstacle with a fine balance of 
patience and enthusiasm. You can spot this dog a mile away. She’ll
 
 Run directly to the table without hesitation.
 
 Quickly respond to “Sit” or “Down” as directed.
 
 Stay steady as a rock, yet be poised to spring on her release cue.
 
 Fly off tilt and onto the next obstacle, when given the cue.
But aren’t you supposed to be teaching your dog to stay off the table? Well, 
yes, when it comes to your furniture, but the agility table is a different type 
of table. It’s low and square with a roughened surface area to prevent slip-
ping (you can even jury-rig a table out of a low, sturdy, resurfaced coffee 
table — sanded and coated with sand-textured paint or nonslip vinyl strips). 
The height of the table is adjustable to your dog’s height.
Step 1: Encouraging quick positioning
The first step is done off the table: You need to speed up your dog’s reaction 
time to the “Sit” and “Down” commands. Use your dog’s favorite lures and 
a clicker or word cue to highlight his speediest renditions. Begin with the 
speedy “Sit.” When your dog gets the knack of that, move on to the speedy 
“Down.” Follow these steps:
 
1. Give the “Sit” or “Down” command as you lure your dog into position.
 
2. Reward your dog’s initial cooperation — no matter what his speed.
 
3. Then withhold the treat for faster positioning, urging him with faster 
luring motions and more urgent tones.
 
4. When he nails his first speedy posture, give him a jackpot reward — a 
fistful of treats.

468
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Step 2: Going to the table
After your dog has mastered the speedy “Sit” and “Down,” teach her to run to 
the table and get on it with eager enthusiasm.
 
Make table time special by pulling the table out when practicing, but storing 
it away when not in use.
When you first approach the table, let your dog explore it . . . allow her to 
sniff it, put her paws on it, jump on it, and so on. If your dog gives you a 
double-take, do your best to erase her skepticism by staying enthusiastic and 
encouraging your dog to climb up. You’re ready for the send-off.
 
1. Ask a friend to stand behind the table with a loaded target disc — an 
object laced with a treat.
 
 Have your friend wave the object to get your dog’s attention.
 
2. Stand back 5 to 10 feet. Shout “Table” as you let your dog go.
 
3. Mark the moment she lands on the table with a clicker or a praise cue 
such as “Yes,” or “Good!”
 
 Let her have the reward by approaching behind her and praising galore.
Always use your release word, for example, “Okay,” to end the praise fest. 
You’re conditioning your dog to get off when she hears the word cue. 
Increase your dog’s understanding by practicing from different angles and 
increasing the send-off distance.
After you’ve accomplished all this, try practicing solo:
 
1. Show your dog the target and place it back and slightly off the table’s 
center.
 
2. Bring your dog back, and then release her with the command, 
“Table!”
 
3. Run with her to the table. If she leaps on, mark it with your word cue 
and/or clicker, and stop in front of the table and praise her.
 
 If she’s hesitant or runs by, move to the opposite side and encourage 
her to get on from the front.
 
 If she ducks behind and tries getting up on the far side, put her on a 
short tab leash and calmly maneuver her back to the front side.
 
4. When she has mastered jumping on the table, send her from different 
angles and distances.
 
 Always release your dog from the table with “Okay.”

Agility, and 
Shows
 
Some dogs approach the table with such force and excitement that they slip 
off. If this happens to your dog, shout her name as she nears the table.
Now phase out your use of the target object:
 
1. Put the object up on the table without lures.
 
 Mark the moment she hits the target, and then run up and reward her by 
hand.
 
2. Remove the target altogether.
 
 Reward your dog instead with a marker cue (click or word) and treats.
Step 3: Practicing table positions
When your dog is super-happy about the table, you’re ready to introduce 
your stationary commands, combining quick positioning (Step 1) with going 
to the table (Step 2):
 
1. Bring out the table. Practice a few familiar runs (see the preceding 
section) to stoke your dog’s enthusiasm.
 
2. Send your dog to the table by commanding “Table!” When all four 
paws hit the table, direct “Sit.”
 
 Verbalize clearly and with urgency. Command from an upright 
posture — your dog may misconstrue any bending forward as 
threatening.
 
3. Cue or click and reward your dog the instant he nails the posture.
 
 At this stage, get close enough to your dog to treat him while he’s in 
position. Otherwise, you’ll be conditioning a position-pop-up — a big 
no-no in this sport.
 
4. Work on the quick “Down” the same way you approached the “Sit” 
cue in Steps 1 through 3.
Your only focus at this point is to teach quick positioning.
Step 4: Holding — 1-2-3-4-5 go
When your dog will assume whatever posture you direct on the table, you’re 
ready for the final move: holding still. In trial, the judge will stand near you 
and count to five: Initially, vary the holding time from five toten seconds.

470
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
You can practice this move at home with or without a table. Do your quick 
“Sit” or “Down,” count out loud, and then release with “Okay!” Use a more 
urgent tone than that of your everyday command voice so your dog will know 
these short counts to five are different than your other, lengthier, expectations. 
Follow these steps:
 
1. On every third “Table” run, add the command “Stay” after your “Sit” 
or “Down” positioning cue.
 
 Vary the stay time from 5 to 10 seconds.
 
2. Hold the treat in your hand while your dog holds the position, giving 
her the food just before you release with “Okay!”
 
3. Is your dog holding her stay? Ask someone to volunteer as the 
judge — standing next to the table and counting “1-2-3-4-5 GO!”
The bottom line? You don’t want this obstacle to dampen your dog’s 
enthusiasm for agility. Make it a fun and exciting challenge, and your dog 
will look forward to it as much as the other obstacles on the field!
Acing the A-frame
The A-frame is a truly beautiful thing. To condition your dog’s movement, 
practice the dismount first (known as back-chaining) to help your dog learn 
to run through the contact zones (colored areas your dog must touch). After 
this is accomplished you can work on your approach to and motions over the 
frame as you chain together the rest of the steps, as follows:
 
1. Find a helper for the initial learning stages.
 
2. Lower the frame to its lowest point.
 
3. Put your dog on leash, and surprise him with food or toys.
 
 When practicing on leash, do your best to keep the leash loose. A 
tightened collar can throw your dog off balance and slows your dog on 
the very obstacles for which he needs momentum the most.
 
4. Lure him up the frame saying a chosen command, such as “Frame!” or 
“Climb!”
 
 If your dog balks, ease off. Let him watch other dogs manage the frame. 
Climb it yourself. Do whatever it takes to help him overcome that initial 
trepidation.
 
5. Don’t allow your dog to stop on the obstacle, even as you’re rounding 
the top of it.
 
 Encourage him to move quickly as you lure him forward.

471
 Chapter 5: The Ins and Outs of Agility Training
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
 
6. After your dog is cooperating on leash, raise the frame to its normal 
position (5 to 6 feet).
Perfected that? Is your dog excited to scale the A-frame? You’re in good 
shape. Now you’re ready to practice off leash. Your helper should continue 
to spot your dog. Move toward the frame, using your familiar command and a 
bowling signal with the arm closest to the obstacle.
 
If at any point your dog reverts back or tests the crazy jump-off maneuver, 
back-chain it, and start over. Stay happy — you need your dog’s pumped 
enthusiasm to complete all the obstacles on an agility course.
Staying Balanced on the Dog Walk
The dog walk is a bit precarious. A raised, 12-foot-long, 4-foot-high, 12-inch-
wide bridge extends between two planks — a balance beam for dogs. Mindful 
of their footing, few dogs will fall off if they walk it, but you will eventually be 
asking for speed. A slow and steady training regime ensures that your dog 
will be more mindful of her footing when you speed things up. Here’s how to 
get your dog ready for the dog walk, both on and off the agility course.
Off-course
Introduce this fun game in a nondistracting setting. Here’s what to do:
 
1. Lay a wooden plank along the floor.
 
 Ideally, set the plank against a wall to discourage darting.
 
2. Use treats to lure your dog (or puppy) onto the plank on leash.
 
3. Guide him down the entire length of the board, praising and treating 
your dog as you go.
 
4. Lead him straight off the end — straight off, every time.
 
5. When he’s comfortable with this exercise, begin to use your agility 
command word: “Plank!” or “Walk it!”
 
6. Direct your dog to run the plank in both directions, pairing the 
command with a bowling arm signal whenever possible.
 
7. Remove the leash, but keep enforcing the entire run — straight off, 
every time.
 
8. Elevate one end of the dog walk a few inches (use a big book or a 
brick). It will seem awkward. Go back to Step 2. Lure your dog on 
leash as you command and reward him. Proceed through Step 7, using 
this configuration.

472
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
 
9. Now elevate both ends and repeat Steps 2 through 7.
 
 Got that? You’re ready for the real deal!
On-course
When possible, introduce your dog to using the Baby Dog Walk — it’s lower 
and safer than the raised version, and it seems less scary to your dog. Here’s 
how it works:
 
1. Find a helper to spot your dog on the opposite side of the plank.
 
2. Lure your dog on leash, as you did for the A-frame (see the earlier 
section, “Acing the A-frame”).
 
 
If your dog is hesitant, create a Hansel-and-Gretel pathway with favor-
ite treats. Use this grazing method a few times (and only if necessary) 
to encourage your dog’s enthusiasm on this obstacle. Hold the leash 
loosely to prevent unconsciously slowing your dog’s 
progression.
When your dog can manage this obstacle with comfort, you’re ready to try 
the official dog walk. For the raised dog walk, repeat the preceding steps, 
asking your helper to channel your dog’s movements to prevent early slipping. 
If your dog does fall, stay as calm and cheerful as possible. As they say in 
horseback and bike riding: If you fall off, get up, get back on.

S
o you think that you have the best dog in the world? Your Bichon, 
Border Collie, Pug, or Portuguese Water Dog is perfect, and you want 
everyone to know it. Fortunately for you, a whole sport is dedicated to doing 
just that — the fascinating world of dog shows.
Conformation trials, or dog shows, are sporting events in which dogs compete 
against other canines to see who is top dog. Although dogs today can compete 
in a whole host of events — agility, flyball, herding, and earthdog among 
them — a dog’s overall appearance and structure is judged in conformation.
Shows of all sizes and shapes take place in the United States each year; 
leading the pack is the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, one of the most 
famous dog shows in the world. Held each year in New York City, this show 
has been running since 1877 and draws an interesting mix of fierce competitors 
(including the humans), unified fanciers, and devoted spectators.
Dog shows like Westminster are popular and very competitive, and the whole 
scene can seem quite overwhelming for beginners — even people who simply 
buy a ticket so they can sit back and watch. This chapter helps answer 
questions about the different types of shows, the breed standards, and how 
to get started, plus it aims to give you enough information to help you decide 
whether dog showing is right for you and your dog.

Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Discovering the World of Dog Shows
Some basic information about dog shows is helpful in understanding this 
fascinating and sometimes strange world. Hype and glitz aside, keep in mind 
the original goals of the sport set down by canine devotees more than a 
hundred years ago.
Achieving high standards
According to the American Kennel Club (AKC), breeders must work to 
“produce a dog who most closely conforms to the breed standard.” In 
competitions of conformation, judges examine dogs and rank them according 
to how closely each compares to the dog described in the breed’s official 
standard, a description of the characteristics that allow a breed to perform 
the function for which it was bred. Standards often include a description of 
general appearance, as well as detailed specifications on the following:
 
 Structure: Size, proportion, color, coat, and so on
 
 Temperament: The personality, described in such terms as “alert,” 
“even-tempered,” “cheerful,” “confident,” and “reliable”
 
 Movement: How a breed should move (“at a gallop,” “powerful,” 
“purposeful”)
Despite the razzle-dazzle, dog shows are not beauty contests. When it comes 
to conformation, the standard rules. How else can judges objectively choose 
one magnificent, gorgeous dog over another?
Breeds were developed to perform specific duties, and a written standard 
describes the ideal structure for the breed. Terriers, for example, needed a 
rough, protective coat to allow them to chase vermin under brush and 
underground. A long-legged, smooth-coated breed just wouldn’t hold up to 
the work of chasing down rats and badgers.
Standards for breeds are developed and maintained by the breed’s national 
club, and those breeds registered by the AKC are included in the AKC’s 
Complete Dog Book. The AKC’s Web site, www.akc.org, lists each breed’s 
standard and includes a link to the breed’s parent club.
Who can compete?
Not just any good-looking pooch can compete in a conformation event. To be 
eligible to compete, a dog must be
 
 A purebred.

475
 Chapter 6: Best in Show: Showing Your Dog
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
 
 Registered with a kennel club. For an AKC-sponsored event, a dog must 
be individually registered with the American Kennel Club. In other 
words, the dog must have papers proving its registration as a purebred. 
(See the nearby sidebar, “The kennel clubs: Playing for papers.”)
 
 The correct age, often 6 months or older.
 
 Intact (not spayed or neutered).
Because conformation has always been about judging a dog’s potential as 
breeding stock, show dogs are required to be intact — whether or not you 
plan to breed your own. Serious health risks are associated with intact dogs, 
and individual owners need to decide whether showing a dog is worth the 
potential health problems.
Don’t despair if one of these requirements excludes your dog from competi-
tion. Not to compare apples to oranges, so to speak, but altered cats have 
been able to compete in a special class at pet shows for years, and some 
shows offer a special altered class for competition. Three kennel clubs offer 
signs of hope for pups that don’t fit the standard show mold:
 
 The United Kennel Club offers, in addition to its purebred registry, a 
program to all dogs who are spayed or neutered — including mixed 
breeds, purebred dogs of unknown pedigree, and purebred dogs with 
“faults” that disqualify them from UKC breed standards. Included in the 
program are trials for agility and obedience, dog sports, weight pulls, 
and the group’s junior program.
 
 The Canadian Kennel Club allows unregisterable dogs of CKC breeds 
to participate in competitive events, as long as the owner has obtained 
a Performance Event Number from the organization. Such dogs must be 
spayed or neutered.
 
 The American Kennel Club has a program for spayed and neutered 
mixed breeds (see Chapter 8 in Book V), as well as a program for 
unregistered dogs of AKC breeds. For more information, go to www.
akc.org/reg/ilpex.cfm.
The Mixed Breed Dog Clubs of America (MBDCA), a national registry for 
mixed breeds, provides many opportunities for mixes, which must be altered 
to participate. In addition to obedience, lure coursing, tracking, and other 
performance events, mixed breeds can compete in conformation. Before dogs 
can earn an MBDCA championship title, they must earn the organization’s 
obedience titles, ensuring a mix of both brains and beauty.
Individual breed clubs may also be making changes to accommodate owners 
who are not interested in breeding or, for some other reason, want to show 
an altered dog. For example, the Australian Shepherd Club of America allows 
spayed and neutered Aussies to compete in all club programs, including an 
Altered Conformation Program, in which dogs can earn points toward breed 
championships.

Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Types of conformation dog shows
You’re faced with a host of new terminology as soon as you start looking into 
dog shows. All-breed, specialty, group — what do they all mean? Here’s a head 
start on the three types of conformation dog shows:
 
 All-breed shows: An all-breed show offers competitions for more than 
150 breeds and varieties of dogs recognized by the AKC or one of the 
other major dog registries. These shows are the ones you’re most likely 
to see on TV. The first-place dog from each of the seven breed groups 
competes in a final round to be Best in Show. The Westminster Kennel 
Club Dog Show is one of the best-known all-breed shows.
The kennel clubs: Playing for papers
Dogs who compete in conformation must be 
registered with a kennel club. But what does 
that really mean? A dog can be registered with a 
kennel club if it is the offspring of two purebreds 
of the same breed. Such a dog gets papers — 
paperwork that certifies the dog as a purebred. 
Does this mean that a dog with papers is better 
or healthier than a dog without papers? Nope, 
not necessarily. Kennel clubs register dogs as 
a way to track them. You can register your dog 
with one club or with many, depending on the 
breed and where you live (owners near the 
border of Canada and the United States may 
choose to register with both the AKC and the 
CKC). Although there are countless kennel 
clubs in the world, these clubs are a few of the 
big players:
 American Kennel Club (AKC), oldest and 
largest in the United States, with more than 
160 breeds
 United Kennel Club (UKC), second-oldest in the 
United States, with more than 300 breeds
 States Kennel Club (SKC), formed in the 1980s, 
with limited geographic reach
 American Rare Breed Association (ARBA), a 
newer registry, with limited geographic 
range
 Canadian Kennel Club (CKC), somewhat aligned 
with the AKC, with 175 breeds
 Kennel Club (in Great Britain), the oldest kennel 
club in the world and organizer of the Crufts 
show
 Federation Cynologique Internationale (FCI), 
with member clubs from European, Asian, 
and Latin American countries

477
 Chapter 6: Best in Show: Showing Your Dog
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
 
 Specialty shows: Often hosted by breed clubs, specialty shows are 
open only to dogs of a specific breed or to varieties of one breed. For 
example, the Border Collie Society of America specialty show is for, 
not surprisingly, Border Collies only.
 
 Group shows: These shows are for dogs who belong to one of the AKC’s 
seven groups: Hound, Herding, Sporting, Non-Sporting, Terrier, Working, 
Toy, and Miscellaneous. Beagles, for example, are in the Hound Group, 
so they compete with other hounds such as Bassets, Bloodhounds, and 
Dachshunds.
Dog shows can be indoors or outdoors, benched or unbenched. In a benched 
show, dogs are kept on assigned benches when not in the show ring. This 
arrangement gives visitors attending the show a better chance at seeing 
the breeds and talking to breeders and handlers. Few shows these days are 
benched; Westminster is one of them.
But wait — there are shows and there are matches. In the three types of 
shows, dogs compete for points toward a championship. Matches are more 
informal, and dogs do not earn points toward a championship. Don’t discount 
this level of competition, though; matches can be very useful for practicing 
and getting your feet wet in the ring. Dogs can enter three types of matches:
 
 Workshop: The most informal type of match, in which dogs are not 
judged by breed or group. Judges typically give advice, not ribbons.
 
 Fun match: The next level up from a workshop. Dogs are judged by 
breed, usually with ribbons awarded.
 
 Sanctioned match: The most formal type of match, the closest thing to a 
sanctioned show. Clubs use sanctioned matches as part of the approval 
process for being able to hold shows.
You can check the events calendar of different breed clubs to find out when 
matches and shows are being held in your area. Many dog magazines also list 
dates for upcoming shows.
A group by any other name
This book primarily refers to the AKC breed 
groups, and other clubs break down the breeds 
differently. The UKC has eight groups that are 
based on purpose: Companion, Guardian, Gun 
Dog, Herding Dog, Northern Breed, Scenthound, 
Sighthound and Pariah, and Terrier. The FCI 
relies on ten groups. The Canadian Kennel Club 
uses the same seven groups as the AKC.

Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Getting to know the cast of characters
Putting on a dog show is no small feat. Consider the time and energy involved 
in scheduling and coordinating what are often multiday events. Although 
many people work hard behind the scenes to make a show a success, you 
can familiarize yourself with a few of the key characters you’ll come across in 
the world of dog shows.
 
 Breeders: More than a matchmaker, the breeder is responsible for the 
health of the father (sire) and mother (dam), as well as any puppies in 
the litter. Breeders must have a thorough knowledge of AKC regulations 
and breed standards; they are also responsible for seeing to it that the 
proper AKC documentation is submitted for new puppies. Although a 
breeder is there at the start of a show dog’s life, a breeder may or may 
not be an owner or handler.
 
 Owners: An owner is typically the person who decides whether to show 
a dog. Does a dog conform to the breed standard? Is the dog trainable? 
Will the dog have a winning personality in the ring? An owner considers 
a number of factors — time and expense among them — before launching 
a dog on a show career. An owner may or may not be a breeder or 
handler. It’s becoming more common for people to be more interested 
in showing than breeding, and that’s fine.
 
 Handlers: The person in the ring with a show dog is the handler. Some 
handlers are professionals (sometimes referred to as agents). A good 
handler is well versed in the breeds and understands all the rules of 
competition. Handlers are not limited to showing — most devote a lot of 
time to training and grooming. A handler can show one dog or many.
 
 Judges: A judge is the person who examines the dogs in a show and 
awards them based on how closely they match the breed standard. 
Judges need to be breed experts, able to examine everything from a 
dog’s teeth and muscles to the way the dog moves and behaves. Judges 
have to meet various requirements to be approved by a registry; 
although they vary, most judges have to be active in the dog fancy for 
at least ten years, with dogs whom they’ve bred having gone on to 
championship level.
Though some people take on multiple roles — breeder, owner, and handler — 
a dog usually has more than one person involved in its show career.
Understanding the basics of competition
Sure, there’s camaraderie with other fanciers and bonding between dogs and 
owners, but the goal for most dogs who compete in conformation shows is to 
win points toward a championship. Depending on the show and sponsoring 
kennel club, points are accumulated based on some fairly complicated 

479
 Chapter 6: Best in Show: Showing Your Dog
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
formulas, some of which change each year (see your club’s Web site for 
details). For example, to become an AKC champion, with a Champion of 
Record title, dogs must earn 15 points, with two stipulations:
 
 Points must be awarded by at least three different judges.
 
 Points must include two majors — shows in which at least three points 
are awarded.
The number of championship points awarded at a show depends on the 
number of males and females of the breed actually in competition. The more 
entries, the greater the number of points that can be won, with five points 
being the maximum number awarded to any dog at any show. A dog who 
earns a Champion of Record title can compete for Best of Breed and Best of 
Show awards. So just as in any other sport, points are important.
The following simplified description explains a complicated process (entire 
books are devoted to it), but you can use this information as an introduction 
to the way competition works. In a show, dogs are divided by breed first and 
then by gender. For example, a Greyhound is separated from other breeds 
and then divided into groups of males and females. At that point, the males 
and females are divided into seven regular classes:
 
 Puppy: Dogs between 6 and 12 months of age are usually divided into 6 
to 9 months and 9 to 12 months. Dogs in this class have not yet achieved 
champion status.
 
 12 to 18 Months: For dogs 12 to 18 months old. These dogs have not yet 
achieved champion status.
 
 Novice: For dogs 6 months and over who have not won three first prizes 
in the Novice class or a first prize in the Bred By Exhibitor, American-
bred, or Open classes. The dog may also not have been awarded any 
championship points as a puppy.
 
 Amateur-Owner-Handler: A new AKC class (started in 2009) for dogs at 
least 6 months of age who are not champions. Dogs must be handled by 
the owner of the dog, and that person cannot have been, at any point, a 
professional dog handler, an AKC-approved conformation judge, or an 
assistant to a professional handler.
 
 Bred By Exhibitor: For dogs who are exhibited by their owner and 
breeder. These dogs have not yet achieved champion status.
 
 American-Bred: For dogs born in the United States from a mating that 
occurred in the United States. These dogs have not yet achieved 
champion status.
 
 Open: A catchall class, and typically the biggest of a show, for any 
dog registered with the AKC who is at least 6 months old and not yet a 
champion.

480
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
After the male (dog) and female (bitch) winners are chosen in each class, 
they are brought back and judged against each other to determine which 
dog is the best of those winning dogs, known as the Winners Dog and the 
Winners Bitch. Judges award championship points to these dogs, from 1 to 5, 
depending on the number of dogs competing.
The Winners Dog and the Winners Bitch then compete with each other and 
with any dogs who have already earned their champion title, called the Best 
of Breed Competition. Three awards are usually given during this part:
Looking back: A short history of dog shows
Undoubtedly, people have been comparing 
their dogs to others since ancient canines first 
became companions. What began as friendly 
get-togethers of breeders eventually morphed 
into informal dog shows, but it wasn’t until 
June 1859 that the first official dog show took 
place. The location was the English town of 
Newcastle-on-Tyne, and the competitors were 
Pointers and Setters, with 60 dogs shown. Other 
shows soon followed in Birmingham, England, 
with Spaniels and then Hounds included.
Not to be outdone, fanciers in the United States 
began organizing their own dog shows, and the 
first was held in Chicago in 1874. Three years 
later, the Westminster Kennel Club held its first 
show, with more than 35 breeds competing. The 
club has held the annual Westminster Kennel 
Club show for more than 133 years, making it 
the second-longest continuously held sporting 
event in the country.
Another big player entered the scene in 1884 
when the American Kennel Club (AKC) was 
established; the group’s primary goal was as a 
dog registry, to maintain the breeding records 
of purebred dogs in the United States; today the 
organization maintains the records of more than 
15,000 events a year. The United Kennel Club 
(UKC) followed on the heels of the AKC in 1898. 
The group’s founders believed it was important 
to focus more on the original function of the dog 
breeds. Although the UKC held dog shows, the 
shows were geared more toward performance 
events such as gun dog and obedience 
competitions.
After brief stints with AKC rules, Canadian 
dog shows were held under the rules of the 
Canadian Kennel Club and have remained that 
way since 1896. The Fédération Cynologique 
Internationale, the World Canine Organisation, 
recognizes 83 member countries and licenses 
international shows in those countries. One of 
these shows, the World Dog Show, held annually 
since 1971, is hosted by a different country 
each year. Billed as the world’s largest 
dog show, Crufts, run by England’s Kennel 
Club, hosts an estimated average 28,000 canine 
competitors each year, with about 160,000 
spectators and visitors.
Dogs shows are big business, and some of 
the larger organizations televise competitions 
and build interactive Web sites for fanciers. 
With thousands of dogs and their entourages, 
New York City is taken by storm each February 
when the Westminster Dog Show hits 
Madison Square Garden. The canine version 
of the Super Bowl brings with it great fanfare, 
extensive television coverage, and media 
events. Dog show culture probably peaked in 
the limelight when the hilarious film spoof Best 
in Show was released in 2000.

Deciding If Showing Is Right for You
Maybe you’ve been to a dog show or two and loved the camaraderie, or 
your friend shows her dog and has raved about the experience. Maybe 
you’ve dreamed about showing a dog since you were a teen and saw the 
Westminster show on television. Whatever it was, it got you thinking about 
getting a show dog or showing the dog you already have.
Take some time to think about whether you have what it takes to be a show 
dog’s human. Are you outgoing enough to mix with other show people? Do 
you like to travel with your dog? Keep in mind that most newcomers to 
showing will lose and lose badly. It will most likely take some time before a 
win comes your way. Are you prepared for the mental beating your confidence 
will take? Are you the type who can smile as the awards are handed out to 
others? Will you be able to make sure that your dog doesn’t feel as though 
she let you down? Be honest and give these questions some thought.
What about your pooch? If you’re thinking about showing a dog you already 
have, consider the dog’s temperament and tolerance for excitement. If your 
dog has never even been to a dog park, let alone a loud, crowded arena full 
of other dogs, she may be in for a shock. Puppies destined for showing are 
socialized and trained from an early age, both of which help with temperament 
and tolerance of noise and crowds.
A good way to test both you and your dog is to try a local workshop or fun 
match (see the earlier section, “Types of conformation dog shows”). Some 
dogs may enjoy a smaller outdoor setting but will tremble or yawn their way 
through a large indoor match. And if you don’t have a dog to show, maybe 
someone you know has an experienced dog you can take for a test run.

482
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Taking it all in: Being an 
informed spectator
As with any sport, it’s a good idea with dog showing to spend some quality 
time watching from the sidelines. Attend as many different types of shows as 
possible and really soak it all in. 
 
 Grab a show catalog: The show catalog is the official listing of the dogs 
entered in a show, categorized by breed. Dogs are assigned a number in 
the catalog; the dog’s name, registration number, date of birth, parentage, 
and owner are typically listed.
 
 Check out the grooming area: Talk to professional groomers, whether 
about your current dog or a breed you may be interested in owning.
 
 Look at the dogs: Compare different dogs of the same breed at a specialty 
show, or many different breeds at an all-breed show. What looks good to 
you? As tempting as it may be, don’t pet any dog unless given 
permission (some of those doggie do’s take hours to perfect!).
 
 Try to follow the action: Use your show catalog to track the progress of 
the show — the breeds, groups, judges, and winners.
 
 Chat with anyone and everyone: Here’s your chance to schmooze with 
people who have experience. Ask questions, listen, and take it all in.
Pros of showing
People have strong opinions about nearly everything having to do with dogs, 
and dog showing is no exception. The advantages of being involved with dog 
showing vary with the people you talk to. Some pros include the following:
 
 Better bonds: Owners who show their dogs spend a good deal of time 
with each other, helping to ensure a strong bond.
 
 New friends: People who enter the show world are likely to meet a 
host of new people, some of whom may turn out to be lifelong friends, 
supporters, and even mentors.
 
 Education: Understanding the complex world of dog showing can take 
years. Look at it as a learning experience, with regard not only to dogs, 
but also to life (winning, losing, playing nice, and so on).
 
 Breed insight: Being surrounded by dogs of the same breed may give 
you valuable insight about the breed and ways to improve the health of 
your dog or, if you’re a breeder, future dogs.

Cons of showing
Dog showing is not without its downsides, as even the most ardent fanciers 
will attest. Others see more controversy in the sport. Some cons include the 
following:
 
 Ego: Yours, not the dog’s. Though dog showing should be about 
promoting good health and temperament in dogs, that focus can be 
eclipsed by breeders, owners, and handlers who think it’s all about 
them.
 
 The money: Though most breeders don’t make much, if any, money on 
breeding, dog showing is big business. Some people are discouraged by 
others in shows who are motivated more by financial gains than interest 
in dogs.
 
 Your money: Or lack thereof. It costs money to pay entry fees for shows, 
buy equipment, and foot the bills for travel.
 
 Breeding issues: Some believe that dog showing encourages unhealthy 
breeding practices. In 2009, the BBC refused to broadcast the annual 
Crufts Dog Show, citing concerns that intensive breeding of pedigree 
dogs in the United Kingdom is leading to health problems in breeds 
such as Boxer dogs with epilepsy and Pugs with breathing problems. 
The Kennel Club, which runs Crufts, has since introduced regulations to 
encourage responsible breeding.
 
 The scene: Sabatoge, snarkiness, rumors, and fakery are alleged issues 
of dog shows, although these problems are certainly not typical of the 
general dog-showing community.
Considering Junior Showmanship
Think you’re too young to show your dog? 
Perhaps not. Junior Showmanship competitions 
typically are open to boys and girls who 
are at least 9 years old and under 18. These 
competitions give young fanciers the chance 
to develop handling skills, practice good 
sportsmanship, and learn about dogs and dog 
showing. In fact, many professional handlers 
started off in Junior Showmanship, so it’s a 
good way to get experience early on, and 
maybe even decide whether a career as a pro 
handler is in the cards. Conceived as Children’s 
Handling in the 1920s, Junior Showmanship 
competitions vary according to kennel club; the 
UKC’s youngest class is for 2- and 3-year-olds! 
Though the junior competitions share some 
similarities with the adult competitions, judges 
evaluate the children’s handling methods, but 
not the animals.

484
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Of course, these points are just some food for thought, and individuals are 
responsible for making their own decisions.
Getting in Gear to Show
After you’ve decided to enter the wonderful world of dog showing, you 
need to prepare yourself and your dog before bounding into the ring. The 
homework items to check off your list include the following:
 
 Register your dog: Dogs must be registered with a kennel club before 
they can compete. You can register your dog with one club or many 
(see this chapter’s sidebar “The kennel clubs: Playing for papers”), but 
if you’re like many people, you’ll show your dog at AKC events, so your 
dog must be registered with the AKC. Club rules vary, but for a new 
puppy to register, both the puppy’s sire and dam must have papers. 
Typically, a breeder is responsible for registering the new litter, and you 
work with the breeder to register your individual puppy.
 
 Join your local breed club: Local clubs are a great resource for 
information on classes for conformation, handling, obedience, agility, 
and other activities. Depending on where you live, clubs can be all-breed 
or breed specific. Search for a state-by-state listing of clubs affiliated 
with the AKC at www.akc.org/clubs/search/index.cfm.
 
 See a vet: A vet checkup is a critical piece of the preparation puzzle. 
Your vet may be able to offer helpful advice about your dog’s show 
potential and spot issues that may get in the way of a successful show 
career. Your vet can also guide you in the area of vaccinations, ensuring 
that your dog is healthy and able to join the pack. However, a vet may 
not be an expert on any specific breed standard.
 
 Get some identification: You’re not likely to lose your dog, but it’s best 
to be prepared. Collars with identification tags are one option, tattoos 
another, but many people prefer a recent technology, microchipping. No 
technique is foolproof, so your best bet for bringing Fido home safe may 
be to use more than one method.
 
 Make nutrition a priority: All dogs should be fed quality nutritional 
food, but a dog getting ready for competition needs to be in top form, 
both inside and out. The right foods will help keep your show dog trim 
and his coat shiny (see Chapter 1 in Book II for more on food).
 
 Begin a grooming regimen: Although the level and intensity of grooming 
varies from breed to breed, bathing, brushing, scissoring, and plucking 
are important parts of a dog’s show life. If you’re showing a Poodle or 
Bichon, you may need to take a grooming course or hire a groomer. It’s 
never too early to get started, though. Go to shows, get advice from 
groomers, and try out a bath or two.

485
 Chapter 6: Best in Show: Showing Your Dog
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
 
 Get an anatomy lesson: Personality, charm, and temperament are 
factors that help sway a judge in the ring, but conformation is really 
about how closely the dog conforms to the breed’s official standard. The 
standard refers to how the breed’s form follows its original function, and 
it has everything to do with hocks, rib cages, tails, ears, and shoulders — 
and, critically, how a dog moves in the ring. Familiarize yourself 
with the breed standard and the basic terms of dog anatomy (see the 
illustration in this book’s color insert).
 
 Make friends: Plenty of Web sites and books offer advice on showing, 
but one of the best ways to get advice is to meet and talk to actual show 
people. These folks are doing exactly what you want to do, and many 
are happy to share their personal stories and tips for getting ahead. 
Mentoring is a big thing in the show world, and you may find someone 
willing to take you on as an apprentice, so to speak.
 
 Submit your entry forms: Dog showing comes with a daunting amount 
of paperwork. Be sure to carefully complete all entry forms. Then be 
certain to send them in on time so they are received before the entry 
period closes.
 
 Set some goals: Thinking about your goals will better prepare you 
for the amount and level of work you’re in for when it comes to dog 
showing. Will showing be a hobby? A career? Something in between? 
Be realistic when it comes to your dog — not every pup is destined to 
be a champion. Preparing for fun matches will be very different from 
preparing for your dog’s debut at Westminster.
Packing: Checking your list twice
Packing for a show is no small matter. You 
need plenty of gear, and it’s a big nuisance if 
you forget something. Although your list may be 
different, here’s one to get you started:
  Grooming equipment (tack box or bag, 
grooming table, supplies)
  Regular collar and lead
  Show collar and lead
  Bait (treats)
  Water bowl and gallon jugs of water
  Crate and/or exercise pen
  Dog bed or blanket
  Cart to carry equipment
  Tarp, canopy, or umbrella for shade
  Chair
  Towels
  Bags or other method of scooping poop
  Confirmation of entry paperwork and show/
parking pass
  Show clothes/apron
  Extra shoes/socks/hosiery
  Sunscreen
  Cooler with lunch and drinks

486
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Throwing yourself into training
As with any sport, dog showing requires a fair amount of training. Neither 
you nor your dog will be very happy — or successful — if you show up and 
compete without first training. To get yourself and your pooch in top form, 
consider the following:
 
 Obedience training: A prerequisite. Impeccable behavior is a must 
for any dog, but especially those at a dog show. No nipping or jumping 
allowed. Given the excitement, crowds, doggie hormones, and noise — 
not to mention the somewhat invasive poking of the judges — a show 
dog needs to have passed obedience training with flying colors. Start 
early; many breed clubs offer training classes.
 
 Conformation and handling classes: Another prerequisite, especially if 
you plan to handle your dog yourself. Although you’ll do some training 
at home, classes taught by experienced handlers give novices a chance 
to do the following:
 
• Practice their dogs in a controlled showlike setting
 
• Use show-style collars and leads
 
• Get used to being surrounded by other dogs
 
• Learn to stack, or pose your dog to best show off his conformation 
and features
 
• Learn the secrets of gaiting, or moving your dog around the ring in 
a trot
 
 Your dog will need to use his manners in class (no impolite sniffing, 
please) and you’ll need to make sure that your dog’s shots are up-to-
date.
 
 Conditioning: You guessed it, a prerequisite. A swimmer needs to do 
laps, a soccer player needs to run on the track, and a show dog needs to 
do whatever it takes to stay fit. The type of conditioning a dog needs will 
vary. For some, conditioning means regular walks; for others, it means 
herding trials or a treadmill. Check with your veterinarian for guidance.
Mastering the stack
A good conformation class teaches you a lot about stacking, but practice 
really makes the difference when you’re presenting to a judge. Although most 
dogs are stacked with all four feet square and even, some breeds are stacked 
differently, so be sure to find out if your breed’s pose is unusual in any way. 
Small breeds are stacked on a table. Some tips for great stacking practice 
include the following:

487
 Chapter 6: Best in Show: Showing Your Dog
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
 
 Practice often — once a day, if possible — but keep sessions short, 
about three minutes. A weekly class is helpful until you’re both at ease.
 
 Use a mirror so you can see what the judge will be seeing, and set your 
dog facing to your right.
 
 Always handle your dog gently.
 
 Don’t mess around with your dog’s feet — dogs don’t like it. Instead, 
when placing the front or back legs into position, hold the leg above the 
elbow (for the front) and above the hock (for the rear), and move the 
entire leg into place.
 
 Use lots of praise. Then add some more.
 
 Practice the free stack, letting your dog pose herself. Bait (a treat) is 
useful for this move; some say that tossing a piece of bait for a dog to 
catch can help put a dog in a nice free stack.
This practice is important for both you and your dog. Neither one of you will 
be able to look relaxed or natural if you’re nervous — and a judge is likely to 
notice.
Getting ahead with gaiting
Gaiting doesn’t come naturally to most people or their dogs, so classes are 
critical in getting this part of the competition down. Not surprisingly, practice 
makes perfect. During competition, you’re asked to go around; all the dogs 
then trot around the ring at once, as well as gait individually. Gaiting gives 
the judge the greatest chance of seeing your dog’s best qualities and structural 
features. Keep the following tips in mind as you practice gaiting:
 
 Control the lead, holding it taut but not tight. Keep excess lead tucked 
into your hand, to prevent it from distracting your dog or the judge.
 
 Use a command that lets your dog know what’s going on: “Let’s go,” 
“Let’s show,” or some other phrase.
 
 Watch the dailies — that is, view some video of your gaiting techniques. 
Too bouncy? Collar too low? Watching both of you from a different 
perspective gives you a chance to make corrections before you get into 
the ring.
 
 Figure out the best speed for your breed. Faster is not always better. 
When you find that speed, practice until you can match it with some 
consistency.
 
 Learn the patterns — “take them around,” “up and back,” “triangle,” “L,” 
and “T.” Then practice them.
 
 Praise and encourage your pup. Stay positive!

488
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Good gaiting comes from practice and experience, but remember one other 
point: Listen. If you miss what a judge is saying, you miss out on the chance 
to show him what your gait is made of.
Choosing a handler
Yes, it’s possible to do it alone — be the breeder, groomer, handler, secretary, 
travel agent, chauffeur, and pooper scooper. But it’s not easy. Many in 
the dog show world rely on a team of people to help ensure a successful 
dog-showing experience. Because some handlers take care of everything 
from transportation, to grooming, to piloting around the show ring, a 
professional handler can be a key component in any team.
A professional handler has the skill and knowledge to present your dog in the 
ring as a winner. In general, the dog show handler’s job includes the following 
tasks:
 
 Grooming your dog according to the breed standard
 
 Presenting your dog in the ring when called
 
 Moving the dog around the ring to show him off to his best advantage
 
 Making sure that your dog looks good at all times
The best handlers have a way of disappearing in the ring so the spotlight 
stays only on the dog. Good handlers have a knack for making it fun, which 
can make all the difference for some dogs, giving them that extra gleam in 
their eyes or extra something in their trot. Handlers may also take care of 
other aspects of showing:
The question of bait: To use or not to use?
The show ring is a place of great commotion 
and excitement, and it’s not unusual for a dog 
to get distracted by another dog or sounds from 
the crowds. Handlers rely on bait, an edible 
treat of some sort, to entice a dog or get a 
dog’s attention when necessary, often when 
stacking. Bait can be bits of cooked liver or 
steak, cheese, sausage, or even popcorn — 
whatever makes your dog pay attention. 
Handlers carry bait in a pouch or in a pocket 
and dole out a piece to achieve an alert look 
or have a dog stay focused (some handlers 
hold the bait in their mouth, but that’s an 
individual choice). Bait is not allowed at 
all shows, however. If you’re showing at a 
UKC event, you can’t have food in the ring. 
Alternatives to edible bait include balls and 
any toys with squeakers. Edible or not, you may 
have to test a few different methods before 
you find the one that works best.

Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
 
 Boarding, conditioning, grooming, and training
 
 Getting your dog to and from the show (if you choose not to attend)
The fees handlers charge vary; some charge per class entry, per day, with 
additional charges per each point won, and more for dogs who go on to win 
Best of Breed or Best in Show. Expect to pay more for handling a dog who 
requires extensive or finicky coat care.
Breeders and local breed clubs can suggest where to find handlers. The 
Professional Handlers’ Association (www.phadoghandlers.com) has 
membership requirements and a code of ethics; the AKC also has a program 
for handlers who commit to following the organization’s criteria and standards 
for professional handlers.
Competing: Let the Games Begin!
You’ve done your homework, your pooch is primped and poofed, and you’re 
prepared in every way possible. It’s show time!
Arriving at the show
Your first show will be a whirlwind of emotion, nerves, and excitement. You 
need to keep your head about you to take care of a few important steps:
 
 Get settled: Because most shows today are unbenched, you want to find 
the area for exhibitors so you can set up for the day; benched shows 
assign each exhibitor a section of bench. Take your dog for a quick walk 
to see the layout, and then secure her in her crate or pen and take care 
of unpacking.
 
 Check in: Visit the check-in table or ring and pick up your armband 
from the ring steward (judge’s assistant); have your entry confirmation 
handy. Stash your armband somewhere safe or put it on, securing it in 
an armband holder or with a rubber band.
 
 Study the catalog: Although you’ll probably buy at least the first few 
catalogs for the shows you attend, you can also look through the catalog 
available at the superintendent’s table. Check your dog’s listing to make 
sure that it’s correct; your pooch’s wins will be tracked in this way.

490
Book IV: Training, Agility, and Shows 
Entering the ring
This moment can be nerve racking, so try to relax and follow the lead of the 
ring steward. The steward, sometimes a volunteer, is responsible for getting 
each class into and then out of the ring. You’re called in by your number (the 
one on your trusty armband) or by group. If you go in by group, you can pick 
your spot in the line; if you’re called by number, you have no choice. Give 
your dog one last look, but too much fussing may make him nervous.
When you’re in the ring you’re in the hands of the judge. Hopefully, you’ve 
watched the judge with other classes and have a good idea of her routine. 
You take your place, stack your dog, and wait for what comes next.
Judging: The process
Most judges share a fairly simple routine when it comes to show time. Some 
room exists for variation, so it’s always a good idea to get a preview before 
it’s your turn. This section presents a typical scenario.
When a class of dogs first enters the show ring, the judge stands back and 
looks at a dog from a distance to get a general impression. Then he begins an 
individual examination, usually in the direction of head to toe, starting with 
the eyes, ears, and mouth. While in the mouth region, a judge often looks 
at the number of teeth (missing teeth can mean a disqualification in some 
breeds), as well as the dog’s bite, or how the teeth come together.
Dressing the part
The dress code for dog showing is a serious 
matter. Although proper, smart attire is a must, 
a dog show isn’t a fashion show for you. What 
you wear needs to help your dog look her best, 
not detract attention from your dog. Simple 
and conservative works best, with solid colors; 
the color of your suit needs to complement 
your dog’s coat but not be the same color. 
For example, don’t wear a black suit if you’re 
showing a black Labrador — the judge may not 
be able to see the outline of your dog. Men wear 
dress trousers, a shirt, and sometimes a jacket. 
Women choose skirts, dresses, or slacks, and 
some top it all off with a jacket. Typically, the 
formality of dress matches the formality of the 
show. Of course, whatever you wear has to 
be practical and comfortable — skirts with 
sufficient length and shoes with rubber soles.

491
 Chapter 6: Best in Show: Showing Your Dog
Book IV
Training, 
Agility, and 
Shows
When the judge is done with the head area, he “goes over” the rest of the 
dog, judging coat texture and feeling the parts of the dog’s body: hips, 
shoulders, ribs, and so on. By using his hands, especially with heavy-coated 
breeds, he can tell a great deal about a dog’s bone structure and musculature. 
If a judge thinks a dog may be too big or small for the standard, he may ask 
for a measuring wicket to check the shoulder height.
When judging male dogs, a judge has to make sure that there are two fully 
descended testicles. At this moment, many handlers try to distract their dog, 
often with some bait. Distraction isn’t a bad idea, because most dogs — male 
or female — don’t like to have their nether regions examined.
When that business is over, it’s time to move. The judge asks the handler 
to trot the dog in a pattern that allows him to see the animal from every 
direction — from the front, rear, and side. Throughout this part of the 
judging, the judge is watching the smoothness of the dog’s gait and structure 
and deciding how well the dog can perform in its original function.
A dog may be disqualified for a number of reasons: missing teeth, a missing 
testicle, or some other physical trait defined in the standard. Aggression 
toward a judge or another dog is not a good sign and may also spell 
disqualification.
You’ve spent weeks or months preparing, and the whole experience may 
take only about two minutes per dog. Then the judge may simply point to the 
winners or, if the class is large, ask for additional gaiting for some dogs so he 
can compare them a final time before making his decision and handing out 
the ribbons. Game over.
Playing nice: Good sportsmanship
Whether your dog wins or loses, practicing good sportsmanship is essential. 
Think back to the lessons of childhood: “Play nice,” “Don’t brag,” “Don’t 
pout,” and “If you can’t say something nice, then don’t say anything at all.”

I
t’s crazy and wonderful how many different breeds of 
dog there are, and these chapters introduce you to all 
the ones the American Kennel Club recognizes — plus 
some surprising mixes that are gaining in popularity.

Chapter 1
Profiling the Toy Group
In This Chapter
 Getting the scoop on Toys
 Discovering tiny dogs with big personalities
 Finding a Toy that suits you and your life
L
ooking for a canine companion that packs a lot of personality into a 
small package? A pooch that fits in a pocketbook? A dog who’s happy 
walking around the block rather than over the river and through the woods? 
A Toy may be just what you need. From the tiny Chihuahua to the perky 
Papillon, 21 little Toy breeds have a great deal to offer.
Although a few started out as rodent hunters, Toys were primarily bred 
to be companions for the wealthy and as elegant accessories of royalty. In 
many cases, though not all, the Toy breeds are smaller versions of larger 
counterparts (the Toy Poodle from the Standard Poodle, say, or the Pug from 
the Mastiffs). However, the Miniature Pinscher, which does look like a “Mini 
Me” Doberman Pinscher, was not bred down in size from the Doberman.
Because the Toy breeds were developed from so many other groups, it’s 
impossible to characterize them together. Although Toys are typically mild 
mannered and sweet, their personalities are quite different. Compare the 
sensitive nature of the Italian Greyhound, for example, to the fearless Min Pin 
or the spunky Brussels Griffon.
The Toy breeds’ small sizes make them perfect for any lap, but also for any 
home — even the smallest studio apartment. Toys are very popular with city 
dwellers, especially people who live in condos or retirement communities 
that impose size limits on pets. A Toy’s small size also makes it transportable, 
which means you can pick up and carry your petite pooch with you wherever 
you go, even on many airlines. Try that with a Labrador Retriever!

496
Book V: Meet the Breeds 
Don’t be fooled by the small stature of a Toy, though; many are tougher 
than you think. Nearly all Toy dogs make decent little watchdogs: They will 
certainly let you know (by barking, most likely) that a stranger has entered 
their territory. Top alert breeds include the Affenpinscher, Brussels Griffon, 
Chihuahua, Toy Manchester Terrier, Min Pin, Pomeranian, and Yorkshire 
Terrier. Keep in mind, of course, that their greatest strength is probably their 
bark (as opposed to the implied bite of a German Shepherd, for example).
Toys are an ideal choice for many because of their minimal exercise needs. 
That’s not to say that they should lie around eating canine bon-bons all day. 
Even the tiniest Toy needs a short daily walk, romp, or play session to stay 
fit. On the other hand, elderly owners or others who can’t walk their dog 
every time it needs to go out manage to train their pooch to use puppy pads 
or a litter box. Toys also require less grooming and vacuuming time in 
general (smaller dogs, smaller shedding surface).
Older people find great comfort in the affectionate and devoted nature of the 
Toy breeds. A source of companionship and comfort for the lonely, Toys also 
do well with the physically challenged. Toys are excellent therapy dogs, and 
many nursing homes have live-in Toys that provide great joy to residents, 
who benefit from the endless snuggles.
A Toy breed is likely to cost less to maintain than a large breed (they eat less 
food). On the other hand, Toy breeds tend to live longer (mid-tolate teens 
for many), so the cost differences may not be significant in the long run. 
Although not a major consideration, insurance liability is a factor for some 
people. Certain homeowner insurance policies restrict coverage, or charge 
more, for specific large dogs. A Toy breed saves you the hassle of dealing 
with a change or increase in your insurance coverage.
Clearly, the Toy breeds have a lot to offer many types of people — not 
everyone, though. People who probably shouldn’t get a Toy breed include 
the following:
 
 Families with young children (six and under): Toys can be fragile, and 
most may not be able to stand up to the horseplay and extra-big hugs of 
little tykes. Even a Toy dog will have to defend itself with a nip if a small 
child is pulling its tail or poking. Better safe than sorry.
 
 Busy people who aren’t home much: Toys breeds exist to be canine 
companions. They love their people and do best with plenty of attention, 
whether on your lap, at your feet, or sitting nearby.
 
 Active people looking for running partners: Although an Italian 
Greyhound enjoys a jog, most toys do better with a walk or play session. 
Some Toys are sensitive to overheating; others have trouble breathing.
 
Unless you’re interested in getting into the show ring, pet owners should look 
for a larger-sized individual within a breed. Though too big for competition, 
they may be sturdier.

Breeds
Affenpinscher
History/Evolution: One of the oldest of the Toy 
breeds, the Affenpinscher is believed to have 
originated in Germany in the 1600s; the name 
means “monkeylike terrier” in German. In their 
early years, Affenpinschers excelled at hunting 
rodents on farms and in homes. The breed’s 
hunting skills come from its Terrier roots, but 
its wiry hair stems from the German Pinscher. 
Less common today, this monkey-faced breed is 
still a beloved companion, amusing owners with 
playful antics.
Size: Tiny, 8 to 11 inches, average 7 to 9 pounds.
Color: Black, gray, silver, black and tan, beige, 
red.
Temperament: Inquisitive, bold, alert, 
mischievous. Loyal and affectionate with family 
and friends, but will bark when threatened or 
attacked. Fearless for its size.
Energy level: Medium to medium high. Can be 
busy.
Best owner: Active owner with a sense of 
humor.
Needs: Exercise and play (indoors or out), 
socialization, regular brushing, and periodic 
clipping and stripping.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Brussels Griffon
History/Evolution: The Brussels Griffon 
originated in Belgium in the early 1800s, the 
result of crossing the Affenpinscher and the 
Belgian street dog. The breed’s cocky demeanor 
served it well as a guard of cabs in Brussels, 
attracting customers and deterring robbers. 
It was crossed with the Pug in the late 1800s, 
accounting for the head type and the breed’s 
smooth-coated individuals, known as Petit 
Brabancon. Recognized by the AKC in 1910, the 
Brussels Griffon is known for its sensitive nature 
and comical ways.
Size: Small, 9 to 11 inches, 8 to 10 pounds.
Color: Red, beige, black and tan, black.
Temperament: Intelligent and confident, 
sometimes to the point of self-importance. 
Usually enjoys other pets; protects with a fierce 
bark. May experience separation anxiety.
Energy level: Low to medium.
Best owner: Upbeat, patient trainer; a family, 
preferably with older children.
Needs: Exercise and mental stimulation, fenced 
yard, some brushing, patience with housetraining.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Cavalier King 
Charles Spaniel
History/Evolution: The Cavalier King Charles 
Spaniel, a descendant of European toy Spaniels, 
was a pet of aristocratic families during Tudor 
times. In the 1700s, King Charles II favored it 
so much it was given its royal name. The breed 
changed over the years until the 1920s, when 
an American fancier generated enough breeder 
interest to revive the original spaniel. The first 
Cavaliers were sent to America in 1952, but the 
AKC didn’t recognize the breed until 1996.
Size: Small, 12 to 13 inches, 13 and 18 pounds.
Color: Red and white, tricolor, black and tan, 
mahogany red.
Temperament: Gentle, sweet, and easy to 
please. An affectionate, nonaggressive breed 
that is friendly with other dogs, pets, and 
strangers.
Energy level: Medium.
Best owner: Active seniors, families with 
considerate children.
Needs: Exercise, regular grooming, and 
cuddling.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Chihuahua
History/Evolution: Although much of the 
Chihuahua’s history is based on speculation, 
most believe that the tiniest of the toys 
descended from the Techichi, a dog ancient 
Aztecs used as companions and in religious 
ceremonies. The Chihuahua of today, both 
smooth- and long-coated varieties, differs from 
the native dog, perhaps due to breeding with 
dogs introduced by New World explorers. 
Thanks to its size and saucy personality, the 
Chihuahua is one of the most popular breeds in 
the U.S.
Size: Tiny, 6 to 9 inches, less than 6 pounds.
Color: Any color.
Temperament: Lively, alert, and swift, with 
a Terrier-like sense of confidence and self-
importance. Intense devotion is common. Some 
bark.
Energy level: Medium to high.
Best owner: A gentle person with time for daily 
companionship.
Needs: Little exercise or grooming needed, but 
warmth is appreciated; urban living suits its 
minimal space requirements.
Life expectancy: 16 to 18 years.

Chinese Crested
History/Evolution: It’s no easy task to trace the 
origins of the Chinese Crested, but the breed 
appears to have evolved from African hairless 
dogs, which the Chinese bred down in size as 
early as the 13th century. Chinese Cresteds are 
thought to have sailed with Chinese mariners, 
serving as ratters during times of plague. By the 
late 1800s, a handful of American breeders had 
begun to popularize the Chinese Crested with 
dog show enthusiasts; the AKC recognized the 
breed in 1991.
Size: Small, 11 to 13 inches, about 10 pounds.
Color: Any color or combination of colors.
Temperament: A devoted companion; alert, 
gentle, playful, and sensitive. Agreeable with 
dogs, other pets, and strangers.
Energy level: Medium to high.
Best owner: Someone with dander allergies.
Needs: Hairless varieties require regular skin 
care (including sun block) and protection from 
cold; dogs with a powder-puff coat require 
normal brushing.
Life expectancy: 15 to 16 years.

English Toy 
Spaniel
History/Evolution: Like its relative, the Cavalier 
King Charles Spaniel, the English Toy Spaniel 
was a beloved companion of royalty and 
families of privilege in Europe. Mary, Queen of 
Scots, is believed to have favored this spaniel; 
the story goes that one of the dogs even refused 
to leave her side at the scaffold. Though English 
Toy Spaniels are perfectly content as lapdogs, 
they retain their natural hunting instinct. The 
breed achieved AKC recognition in 1886.
Size: Small, 10 to 11 inches, 8 to 14 pounds.
Color: Red and white, tricolor, black and tan, 
mahogany red.
Temperament: Not overly active, but bright and 
interested, willing to please. May be shy with 
strangers or in new situations.
Energy level: Low.
Best owner: Loving, calm owner who is open to 
plenty of lap time.
Needs: Long coat needs brushing twice weekly.
Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years.

Havanese
History/Evolution: A descendant of breeds 
brought to Cuba from Spain, the Havanese is 
Cuba’s national dog. By the mid-18th century, 
the breed’s popularity included such notable 
companions as Queen Victoria and Charles 
Dickens. Some Cubans who left the country 
during the Cuban revolution brought their 
Havanese with them, and a handful ended up in 
the U.S. By the end of the 1970s, the breed was 
gaining popularity, and the AKC recognized it 
in 1996.
Size: Small, 8
1⁄2 to 11
1⁄2 inches, 7 to 13 pounds.
Color: All colors.
Temperament: Busy, curious, trainable and 
intelligent; affectionate with all — animals and 
humans alike.
Energy level: Medium.
Best owner: Someone who wants a small dog 
who isn’t too yappy or too fragile for kids. 
Nonshedding coat is okay for people with 
allergies.
Needs: Brushing every other day, exercise in 
the form of walks or play sessions.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Italian Greyhound
History/Evolution: The smallest of the 
sighthounds, the Italian Greyhound is believed 
to have originated more than 2,000 years ago 
in the Mediterranean basin. During the 16th 
century, the breed was in high demand in Italy 
and came to be known as the Italian Greyhound. 
Its appeal spread through Europe, and the 
breed was often depicted in Renaissance 
paintings. A true greyhound, the Italian 
Greyhound is as skilled at hunting as it is 
comfortable as a lapdog and companion.
Size: Small to medium, 13 to 15 inches, 8 to 12 
pounds.
Color: Any color, but no brindle markings or the 
tan markings normally found on black-and-tan 
dogs of other breeds.
Temperament: Gentle, sensitive, and timid with 
strangers but devoted to its family; like its 
sighthound relatives, likes to run and chase.
Energy level: High, but mellows with age.
Best owner: Family with gentle children, 
owners who can give daily exercise and plenty 
of attention.
Needs: Daily exercise, sprints in a fenced area, 
regular brushing of teeth.
Life expectancy: 13 to 15 years.

Japanese Chin
History/Evolution: The Japanese Chin 
originated in China, where it was prized by 
the aristocracy. The Chin eventually moved 
to Japan via a royal gift. In 1853, Commodore 
Perry brought the first of the breed to Europe in 
1853 as a gift to Queen Victoria. The Chin made 
its way to the U.S., although the supply was 
temporarily cut off during World War I. Playful 
and entertaining, the Chin has enjoyed some 
popularity in the United States, but most of its 
devotees are in Japan.
Size: Tiny, 8 to 11 inches, 4 to 7 pounds.
Color: Black and white, red and white, black and 
white with tan points.
Temperament: Sensitive, intelligent, and willing 
to please. Devoted dogs who will follow their 
owners anywhere.
Energy level: Adaptable.
Best owner: Seniors or invalids interested in 
close companionship.
Needs: Sensitive to heat and humidity — 
air conditioning a must. Prolific shedders 
requiring twice-weekly combing. Suited to 
apartment living.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Maltese
History/Evolution: The most ancient of the 
toys, the Maltese has been popular for centuries 
with people of wealth. As with other ancient 
breeds, the origin of the Maltese remains a 
mystery; the dogs appear in Greek art dating 
back to the fifth century. Most associate the 
breed with the Isle of Malta. Maltese likely were 
distributed as exotic items of trade from Malta, 
eventually making their way throughout the 
civilized world. The breed was recognized by 
the AKC in 1888.
Size: Tiny, 9 to 10 inches, 4 to 6 pounds.
Color: Pure white.
Temperament: Gentle, playful, and energetic; 
fearless for its small size. Showers affection on 
family and friends.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Someone with a lot of time for 
a dog.
Needs: Lots of attention; extensive daily care of 
long, silky coat; frequent dental care. Apartment 
living is fine with walks and playtime.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Miniature Pinscher
History/Evolution: Despite its name, the 
Miniature Pinscher is not a miniature version 
of the Doberman Pinscher. Native to Germany, 
the Min Pin is most likely the result of breeding 
the German Standard Pinscher with the Italian 
Greyhound and the Dachshund. Though it 
originated several centuries ago and has been 
bred extensively in Germany and Scandinavia, 
the Miniature Pinscher did not become popular 
in the United States until the 1920s.
Size: Tiny, 10 to 12
1⁄2 inches, 8 to 10 pounds.
Color: Black or chocolate with rust-red mark-
ings, or solid red.
Temperament: Energetic, busy, and inquisitive, 
sometimes aggressive if not well trained; fear-
less watchdog. Usually affectionate with family, 
reserved with strangers.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Active owner with fenced yard and 
ability to supervise; families with older children.
Needs: Lots of exercise and activity in areas 
where the curious dog can be left alone when 
necessary (think toddler).
Life expectancy: 14 to 15 years.

Papillon
History/Evolution: The dog who became the 
Papillon started off as the dwarf spaniel of 
the 16th century. Though its name — French 
for “butterfly,” for the butterfly effect of dog’s 
fringed ears — and much of its development can 
be traced to France, the breed gained a good 
deal of its popularity in Spain and Italy. Both 
erect-eared and drop-eared Paps can be born in 
the same litter and are judged together by the 
AKC, which first represented the breed in 1935.
Size: Tiny, 8 to 11 inches.
Color: Parti-color or white with patches of any 
color(s).
Temperament: Happy, obedient, and playful. 
Friendly toward other pets, and strangers, but a 
capable watchdog.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Fun-loving, active owner who can 
take charge.
Needs: Playtime, positive training methods, 
twice-weekly brushing of coat, regular teeth 
brushing.
Life expectancy: 14 to 18 years.

Pekingese
History/Evolution: With legends that can be 
traced back to ancient Chinese dynasties, the 
Pekingese is truly a regal creature. The small, 
maned dogs resembled the symbol of Buddha, 
the lion, and were developed to accentuate 
this resemblance. Later, Queen Victoria was 
given one, causing great demand for the dogs in 
Britain. First registered by the AKC in 1906, the 
Pekingese continues its role as charming, loyal 
companion.
Size: Small, less than 14 pounds (dogs 6 pounds 
and under are called sleeves, because they 
could be carried in the sleeves of their Chinese 
masters).
Color: All colors, but the exposed skin of the 
muzzle, nose, lips, and eye rims is black.
Temperament: Regal, intelligent, independent, 
and self-important. Affectionate to family; often 
aloof with strangers. May not be sturdy enough 
for a child’s handling.
Energy level: Low.
Best owner: Low-key owner who is a gentle and 
patient trainer, and tolerant of snoring.
Needs: Leisurely walks or indoor romps, regular 
combing, air conditioning, daily cleaning around 
nose wrinkle and hind end.
Life expectancy: 13 to 15 years.

Pomeranian
History/Evolution: A descendant of the Spitz 
family of dogs, the Pomeranian gets its name 
from the historical region of Pomerania (split 
today between Germany and Poland), where the 
Poms served as able sheepherders. The breed 
gained popularity after Queen Victoria brought 
one back from a trip to Italy, and a smaller-size 
Pomeranian then became more fashionable. 
Today the animated, fox-faced Pom remains a 
popular show dog and companion.
Size: Tiny, 8 to 11 inches, 3 to 7 pounds.
Color: Red, orange, cream and sable, black, 
brown and blue, brindle, beaver, white, and 
parti-color.
Temperament: Extroverted, busy, and curious. 
Attentive and playful; reserved with strangers. 
Can bark a lot.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Loving, gentle family/owner.
Needs: Minimal daily exercise, but lots of atten-
tion; twice weekly brushing, training, supervi-
sion with young children, secure fenced yard.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Pug
History/Evolution: Much of the Pug’s origins 
are a mystery, but the miniature mastiff-type 
dog appears to have been developed in 
ancient Asia. A favorite pet of Tibetan Buddhist 
monasteries, the Pug was brought by traders 
to Holland. By the late 1700s, the breed had 
arrived in France, where Napoleon’s imprisoned 
wife, Josephine, used her Pug to deliver 
messages to Napoleon. The Pug’s official motto, 
multum in parvo, meaning “a lot in a little,” suits 
it well. In 1885, the AKC accepted the Pug for 
registration.
Size: Small, 10 to 11 inches, 14 to 18 pounds.
Color: Fawn or black.
Temperament: Adaptable, even-tempered, 
pleasant, playful; exudes charm and dignity.
Energy level: Low to medium.
Best owner: One with plenty of time for 
interaction and who can tolerate wheezing 
and snoring.
Needs: Low heat and humidity; minimal coat 
care; daily cleaning of facial wrinkles.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Shih Tzu
History/Evolution: Although the Shih Tzu is 
typically associated with China, many believe 
the breed was brought to the Chinese court 
from Tibet. The Shih Tzu as we know it was 
most likely developed in China around the late 
1800s during the reign of Dowager Empress 
Cixi. The breed faced extinction during the 
Communist Revolution, but 14 dogs imported 
to England formed the foundation of every Shih 
Tzu today. The Shih Tzu remains a gentle and 
devoted companion.
Size: Small, 8 to 11 inches, 9 to 16 pounds.
Color: All colors.
Temperament: Positive, playful, and affectionate; 
sweet, occasionally stubborn.
Energy level: Low to medium.
Best owner: Everyone from families to seniors, 
but a patient trainer with time for daily 
grooming or funds for professional appointments.
Needs: Socializing, daily exercise, positive 
training methods, diligent grooming.

Silky Terrier
History/Evolution: Developed in Australia in 
the late 1800s, the Silky Terrier is the result 
of crosses between Yorkshire Terriers from 
England and Australian Terriers. Known as 
the Syndey Silky Terrier, the Australian Silky 
Terrier and, finally, in the United States in 1955, 
the Silky Terrier. This toy breed’s pleasant and 
inquisitive nature has made it a moderately 
popular companion.
Size: Small, 9 to 10 inches, 8 to 11 pounds.
Color: Blue and tan.
Temperament: Alert, feisty, inquisitive, and 
playful. Terrier instincts make it an adept 
hunter. Intelligent, stubborn, mischievous. 
Tends to bark a lot.
Energy level: Medium to high.
Best owner: Relatively active owner with a 
fenced yard for exploring.
Needs: Daily exercise (games of fetch or walks 
with family), training and socialization, regular 
bathing and brushing, routine dental care, and 
attention.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Toy Fox Terrier
History/Evolution: The Toy Fox Terrier was 
developed in the early 1900s by American 
fanciers who crossed small Smooth Fox Terriers 
with Toy breeds such as Miniature Pinschers 
and Manchester Terriers. The breed retains the 
working abilities of the Terrier but has a mild 
and amusing character that makes these dogs 
wonderful home companions. Accepted by the 
AKC in 2001, the Toy Fox Terrier does well on 
the farm, in the show ring, and in conformation, 
agility, and obedience trials.
Size: Small, 8
1⁄2 to 11
1⁄2 inches, 3 to 7 pounds.
Color: Tricolor; white, chocolate, and tan; white 
and tan; white and black, all with predominately 
colored head.
Temperament: Alert, spirited, determined. 
Animated, playful, loyal; may not warm to 
strangers right away.
Energy level: Medium to high
Best owner: Active individual or family with 
post-toddler children.
Needs: Exercise, training and attention to divert 
it from digging and barking; fenced yard for 
hunting and exploring.
Life expectancy: 13 to 14 years.

Yorkshire Terrier
History/Evolution: Despite its long coat and 
lovely looks, the Yorkshire Terrier began as a 
hunter of rats and other vermin in Yorkshire, 
England. The breed is the result of crosses that 
likely include the Waterside Terrier, Clydesdale 
Terrier, Paisley Terrier, and Black-and-Tan 
English Terrier. The Yorkshire Terrier soon 
became a popular show dog and companion 
of the wealthy. Don’t be fooled, though — the 
breed is still a Terrier, with Terrier instincts.
Size: Tiny, 8 to 9 inches, 5 to 7 pounds.
Color: Blue and tan.
Temperament: Busy, inquisitive, and bold; can 
be stubborn and surprisingly aggressive for its 
size. May bark a lot, but can be trained not to.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Active owner or family with gentle, 
considerate children.
Needs: Daily short, leashed walks or play 
sessions; firm and fair discipline, brushing every 
other day, routine dental care, attention.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Chapter 2
Profiling the Working Group
In This Chapter
 Defining the Working category
 Getting to know the workers
 Understanding the needs of sled dogs
 Socializing a protective breed
T
he Working Group is a formidable assemblage, made up of dogs of great 
strength, courage, and devotion. The AKC category of Working Dog 
describes breeds that were originally bred for jobs other than herding or 
hunting: carting, sledding, guarding, and rescuing. Though many machines 
now do these jobs (snowmobiles rather than sledding dogs, for example), 
plenty of Working breeds are still doing their jobs throughout much of the 
world.
The breeds in the Working Group are built to perform tough tasks. They 
are sturdy and strong and capable of carrying heavy loads. They are brave 
enough to guard against predators and intruders, as well as accompany 
soldiers into war. They have specialized skills that allow them to dive 
underwater, perform rescues, and detect drugs and explosives. These breeds 
are intelligent and able to think for themselves, a true asset when a dog must 
act alone to get a job done.
Though they excel at these tasks, the Working breeds are typically large to 
giant — Great Dane, Akita, Mastiff, and Doberman Pinscher, to name a few — 
which may make them a challenge for the average person interested in a pet. 
Fortunately, they are also quick to learn, and early and proper training can 
help a dog stay on track as a home companion. Without training, however, 
the typical owner will be challenged to control such large and powerful dogs. 
Socialization should be done early and throughout a dog’s life, to prevent the 
dog from becoming overprotective, especially if you ever plan to bring new 
people into your life.

508
Book V: Meet the Breeds 
Working dogs may be similar in size, but they vary greatly in other aspects 
of appearance. From the corded white coat of the Komondor to the baggy, 
smooth coat of the Neapolitan Mastiff, the dogs of the Working Group 
have quite a range of hair types. Being workers, of course, coat type has 
everything to do with job performance: The Komondor’s cords protect it 
from the elements and allow it to blend in with its flock; the Neapolitan 
Mastiff’s unusual appearance is enough to stop any intruder in his tracks.
In general, Working dogs are territorial and make excellent guard dogs 
because of their physical size and the volume of their bark. What burglar 
would hear the booming alarm bark of a Rottweiler and decide to come on in?
Despite their size, some of the Working breeds are perfectly content with 
a minimal amount of exercise and can even live happily in a small home or 
apartment. The Mastiff types, for example, don’t require strenuous exercise 
and can do well with a daily leisurely stroll. The sled dogs are a different 
story, however, and are quite active. Be prepared for more exercise and play 
if you have an Alaskan Malamute, Samoyed, or Siberian Husky. Dogs like the 
Portuguese Water Dog, the Boxer, and the Standard Schnauzer also benefit 
from more activity than others in the Working Group.
Whether guardian or powerhouse, Working dogs love nothing better than 
having a job to do. For some that means being a drug-sniffing police dog, a 
therapy dog at a nursing home, or a sled dog in the Iditarod. For others, it 
means keeping a careful eye on a backyard full of children. And nothing is 
better than celebrating a job well done with a well-deserved snooze at your 
master’s feet.

Akita
History/Evolution: The largest of Japan’s seven 
native breeds, the Akita specialized in hunting 
and guarding. Beloved in Japan as loyal pets and 
companions, the breed was named one of the 
country’s national monuments in 1931. Helen 
Keller brought the first Akita to the U.S. when 
she returned from a trip to Japan; American 
servicemen also brought back the dogs from 
World War II. Recognized by the AKC in 1972, 
the Akita continues to gain admirers.

Alaskan Malamute
History/Evolution: One of the oldest sled dogs, 
the Alaskan Malamute evolved in Alaska. There 
they hunted with native peoples for seals and 
polar bears, and then hauled the catch back to 
the village. The arrival of white settlers brought 
mixed breeding until the 1920s, when people 
interested in sled dog racing began to breed the 
traditional malamutes. A noted contributor to 
Admiral Byrd’s trek to the South Pole in 1933, 
the AKC recognized the breed in 1935.
Size: Large; females 23 inches, 75 pounds; males 
25 inches, 85 pounds.
Color: Light gray to black, red, or sable with 
white markings, also all white; brown eyes 
(unlike the blue eyes of its Siberian cousin).
Temperament: Affectionate, friendly, playful, 
and loyal. Behaves well if given enough exercise; 
can be territorial with other pets.
Energy level: Low to medium.
Best owner: Active owner with time for ade-
quate exercise (long walks, runs) maintaining 
firm, consistent methods of training.
Needs: Daily doses of vigorous exercise, daily 
brushing, cool climate.
Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years.

Anatolian 
Shepherd Dog
History/Evolution: More guard dog than 
herder, the Anatolian Shepherd Dog has origins 
in ancient Turkey, with probable ties to the 
Tibetan Mastiff and Roman Mallosian war dogs. 
The dogs served as staunch defenders of 
livestock and are still valued for their hardiness, 
loyalty, and independence. The breed became 
more widely known and appreciated by the 
1980s; the AKC accepted it in 1996.
Size: Giant; females from 27 inches, 80 to 120 
pounds; males from 29 inches, 110 to 150 
pounds.
Color: Fawn, brindle, tricolor, white, black 
mask.
Temperament: Serious about its job as 
protector, yet calm and easygoing. Intelligent, 
adaptable, and territorial; may perceive 
children as part of flock to be guarded.
Energy level: Low (except when a threat is 
perceived).
Best owner: Strong owner in a rural or 
suburban home.
Needs: A job (guard, patrol, slipper fetcher) and 
socialization from an early age; daily exercise 
and securely fenced yard.
Life expectancy: 10 to 13 years.

Bernese Mountain 
Dog
History/Evolution: The Bernese Mountain 
Dog is perhaps the most well known of the 
four varieties of Swiss Mountain Dogs, distinct 
from the other three by its long, silky coat. A 
hardy dog who can thrive in cold weather, the 
Bernese Mountain Dog retains its original skills 
as a draft dog, herder, and watchdog. Prized in 
Switzerland for centuries, the breed is now 
popular throughout Europe and the United 
States, and acquired AKC recognition in 1937.
Size: Large; females 23 to 26 inches, 70 to 100 
pounds; males 25 to 271⁄2 inches, 70 to 120 pounds.
Color: Tricolor (black with white and rust 
markings).
Temperament: Alert, good natured, and calm. 
Extremely devoted, does well with children; 
gets along with other pets but is aloof with 
strangers.
Energy level: Low to medium.
Best owner: Families who include a dog in the 
family’s schedule and activities.
Needs: Daily moderate exercise and twice-
weekly coat brushing; quality time with human 
family (isolation leads to bad habits and 
unhappiness).
Life expectancy: 8 to 10 years.

Black Russian 
Terrier
History/Evolution: Developed in the mid-1900s 
in the Soviet Union, Black Russian Terriers 
were bred to be large, highly trainable dogs 
who could work with security forces as guard 
dogs. The breed is the result of crossings 
with many breeds, primarily Airedale Terrier, 
Giant Schnauzer, and Rottweiler. Spreading

Boxer
History/Evolution: Boxer origins trace back to 
the 16th century, with ancestors that include 
Tibetan fighting dogs, central European hunting 
dogs, and bulldogs. Today’s Boxer owes much 
of its development to German breeders in the 
1800s. One of the first breeds to serve as police 
and military dogs in Germany, by 1900 the 
Boxer had become a beloved pet. Recognized 
by the AKC in 1904, the Boxer soared in 
popularity in the 1940s to its current high 
ranking.

Bullmastiff
History/Evolution: The Bullmastiff was 
developed in England in the 1800s to help 
gamekeepers keep poachers out of estates and 
game preserves. The dog needed to track 
quietly and pin and hold poachers without 
mauling them. The winning combination of size, 
speed, and ferociousness turned out to be 60 
percent Mastiff and 40 percent Bulldog. Today, 
as a companion, the Bullmastiff still can be 
counted on for its watchdog abilities. The AKC 
recognized the breed in 1933.

Doberman Pinscher
History/Evolution: The Doberman Pinscher, 
which originated in Germany around 1900, 
gets its name from Louis Dobermann, a tax 
collector who wanted a dog to accompany 
and protect him as he worked. The German 
Pinscher, Rottweiler, Black and Tan Terrier, and 
Weimaraner were probably used to develop 
the Doberman. Intelligence and ability makes it 
among the finest police dogs, guard dogs, and 
war dogs. A noted show dog, the Doberman has 
also become a beloved and loyal family pet.

Dogue de Bordeaux
History/Evolution: Although the history of the 
Dogue de Bordeaux is steeped in mystery, it is 
generally agreed that the ancient breed shares 
its ancestry with Molossers such as Mastiffs and 
Bulldogs. The Dogue de Bordeaux was a prized 
hunter, fighter, and guardian, found in homes 
of wealthy French. The breed suffered setbacks 
during the French Revolution and World War II, 
but rebounded and realized its fame in the U.S. 
after one of its kind co-starred in the 1989 film 
Turner and Hooch.

German Pinscher
History/Evolution: Although the German 
Pinscher resembles other Pinschers and the 
Doberman, it is more closely associated with 
the Standard Schnauzer. Traced to Germany in 
the 1600s, the German Pinscher was known as 
a hard-working ratter around stables. It faced 
extinction after World War II but was rescued 
by dedicated breeders. It was accepted into 
the Working Group of the AKC in 2003. These 
dogs are loyal, high-energy companions that

Giant Schnauzer
History/Evolution: Developed in Germany, 
the Giant Schnauzer is joined in the Schnauzer 
breed by the Miniature and Standard Schnauzers. 
Through crossings with smooth-coated cattle 
dogs, sheepdogs, Great Danes, and probably 
others, the breed developed into a capable

Dane’s origins can be traced to ancient 
crossings that included English Mastiff, Irish 
Wolfhound, and Greyhound. By the 14th 
century, Great Danes were prized in Germany as 
swift and powerful wild boar hunters. As time 
went on, the breed gained in popularity with 
wealthy landowners because of its imposing 
and noble appearance. Though their size can be 
limiting, Great Danes continue to impress show 
people and pet owners alike.
Size: Giant; females 30 inches or more, 100 to 
135 pounds; males 32 inches or more, 145 to 185 
pounds.

Great Pyrenees
History/Evolution: The Great Pyrenees gets its 
name from the European mountain range where 
it has long guarded flocks of sheep, but its origins 
can be traced to Asia Minor around 10,000 BC. 
In medieval France, the imposing white dogs 
were prized by royalty and nobility. Although 
the Great Pyrenees has suffered setbacks,

Komondor
History/Evolution: The Komondor is a breed 
that has worked for centuries guarding livestock 
in Hungary. The breed’s unusual coat allows it 
to blend in with sheep and also serves as 
armor against the jaws of predators. Although 
uncommon everywhere but in Hungary, 
Komondors were brought to the U.S. in 1933 
and have been effectively used in the to guard 
livestock and fend off coyotes and bobcats. As 
pets, Komondors require extra consideration 
for their corded coat and independent nature.

Kuvasz
History/Evolution: An ancient breed, the 
Kuvasz can trace its origins to Hungary in the 
Middle Ages and Tibet and Turkey before that; 
the name probably is derived from the Turkish 
kawasz, meaning “armed guard of the nobility.” 
Although the Kuvasz declined during the two 
World Wars, breeders continued the breed. 
Kuvaskok (plural) were brought to the U.S. in 
the 1930s; the AKC recognized the breed in 
1935. Today the Kuvasz remains a noble 
addition to family and farm.

Mastiff
History/Evolution: Evidence of ancient Mastiffs 
is peppered with uncertainty, but traces of the 
giant breed are found in Egyptian monuments 
and in images of Roman gladiators. Later, the 
English prized them watchdogs against wolves 
and thieves. Today’s Mastiffs are descendants 
of a noble line of dogs from the Lyme Hall 
Mastiffs of England. Although some believe the 
Mastiff arrived in the U.S. on the Mayflower, 
more concrete evidence suggests the late 1800s. 
Sometimes called “Old English Mastiff.”

Temperament: Devoted and courageous 
guardian, but good natured, docile, and 
surprisingly gentle; well mannered as a house 
pet and not overly excitable.

Neapolitan Mastiff
History/Evolution: An ancient breed with roots 
going back to war dogs used by the Romans, the 
Neapolitan Mastiff retreated into obscurity until 
the breed was rediscovered in Italy in the 1940s. 
With its massive size and imposing look created 
by its loose folds of skin, the Neapolitan is a 
daunting and commanding guard of livestock, 
estate, master, and family. The AKC recognized 
the Neapolitan Mastiff as a member of the 
Working Group in 2004.
Size: Giant; females 24 to 29 inches, 110 pounds; 
males 26 to 31 inches, 150 pounds.
Color: Gray, black, mahogany and tawny; with 
or without brindling.
Temperament: Watchful, steady, and loyal to 
owner; calm yet wary. Good with children, but 
can be overprotective, and massive size can 
cause accidents. Does not get along with other 
dogs.

Newfoundland
History/Evolution: The exact origin of the 
Newfoundland is unclear, but the breed is 
widely believed to have developed on the 
coast of Newfoundland. Thanks to webbed feet, 
powerful muscles, and a thick coat, the dogs 
excelled in the island’s cold waters and were 
used to drag heavy fishing nets. On land the 
dogs are superb draft and pack dogs. Beloved 
for its easygoing, sweet temperament and 
working ability, it has fans in the U.S. and 
Canada as well as throughout Europe.
Size: Giant; females 26 inches, 100 to 120 
pounds; males 28 inches, 130 to 150 pounds.
Color: Black, brown, gray, and white and black.
Temperament: Sweet, calm, gentle, intelligent, 
and patient. Ideal for training. Friendly to all, 
but will protect family if threatened.
Energy level: Medium to low at maturity.

Dog
History/Evolution: Bred to help fishermen, the 
Portuguese Water Dog is native to Portugal, 
where its name Cao de Agua means “dog of 
water.” Exceptional swimmers and divers, 
the dogs would guard boats, dive for fish, and 
retrieve broken nets. Although technology has 
taken over its duties, the Portuguese Water Dog 
is proving itself as a family companion. This 
nonallergenic breed is enjoyed by those with 
allergies; President Obama and the First Family 
adopted a Portuguese Water Dog in 2009.
Size: Medium; females 17 to 21 inches, 34 to 50 
pounds; males 19 to 23 inches, 42 to 60 pounds.

Rottweiler
History/Evolution: The Rottweiler probably 
originated from Roman dogs who drove and 
guarded the cattle that accompanied Roman 
soldiers on marches. Some of the dogs settled 
in Germany, where the herding and guarding 
instincts were further developed. Dog fanciers 
reestablished the breed after a brush with 
extinction; in the 1990s the Rottweiler was the 
second-most-popular breed in the U.S. A current 
concern is that the powerful, highly territorial 
dogs are not always placed in suitable homes.
Size: Large; females 22 to 25 inches, 80 to 
100 pounds; males 24 to 27 inches, 95 to 135 
pounds.
Color: Black, with rust to mahogany markings.
Temperament: Alert, confident, and imposing. 
Self-assured, aloof, and protective of home and 
family; not likely to form immediate friendships.
Energy level: Medium.
Best owner: Strong, confident owner with a 
fenced yard; someone able to administer fair 
and consistent discipline.
Needs: Daily exercise, obedience training, 
and socialization. Happiest as protector, 
herder, service dog, obedience competitor, 
therapy dog.
Life expectancy: 8 to 10 years.

Saint Bernard
History/Evolution: The Saint Bernard is 
believed to have origins in the Molossian dogs 
brought to Switzerland by the Romans, but 
the dog’s most relevant history began in the 
mid-1600s. At that time, the original Saint 
Bernard was introduced to the Hospice, a 
refuge for travelers crossing the Swiss Alps. The 
dogs proved invaluable; guarding, carting, and 
locating and rescuing lost travelers and people 
trapped in avalanches. Saint Bernards saved 
more than 2,000 lives during their service in 
the Alps.
Size: Giant, 130 to 180 pounds; females 251⁄2 
inches and up; males 271⁄2 inches and up.
Color: Red and white, with the red in varying 
shades.
Temperament: Devoted, gentle, dignified, and 
patient. Willing to please, but can be stubborn. 
Protective nature should be controlled, not 
encouraged.
Energy level: Medium to low.
Best owner: Confident, strong owner who can 
provide a cool living environment.
Needs: Daily exercise (to prevent obesity), 
outside time in a fenced yard (except when it’s 
hot), obedience training, weekly brushing, drool 
patrol.
Life expectancy: 8 to 10 years.

Samoyed
History/Evolution: The Samoyed has remained 
relatively unchanged for centuries. Reindeer 
herder, work dog, guardian, and companion of 
the nomadic Samoyed peoples of northwestern 
Siberia, the Samoyed possesses great intelligence 
and strength. Samoyeds were included in sled 
teams that explored Antarctica and the South 
Pole. Although the breed’s primary purpose has 
changed from reindeer herder to sled puller 
and companion, the Samoyed has retained its 
gentle, protective temperament.
Size: Medium; females 19 to 21 inches, 38 to 50 
pounds; males 21 to 24 inches, 50 to 65 pounds.
Color: White (can have cream or biscuit-colored

Siberian Husky
History/Evolution: The Siberian Husky was 
bred as a sled dog and has retained the 
endurance and willingness to work. Sled dogs 
were the primary means of transportation in 
northeastern Asian subarctic communities, and 
Huskies were utilized during the Alaskan Gold 
Rush and early long-distance sled races. Air 
travel and snowmobiles have largely replaced 
them, but the dog’s agreeable temperament and 
a growing interest in recreational races such as 
the Iditarod have kept its popularity high.
Size: Medium; females 20 to 21 inches, 35 to 
50 pounds; males 21 to 231⁄2 inches, 45 to 60 
pounds.
Color: All colors, from black to white, usually 
with markings; brown, blue, parti-colored eyes.

Schnauzer
History/Evolution: Of the three Schnauzers — 
Miniature, Standard, and Giant — the Standard 
is the prototype. It may be the result of 
crossings between Wire-Haired Pinschers, black 
German Poodles, and Gray Wolf Spitz. With 
early jobs that included guard, rat catcher, and 
yard dog, the Standard Schnauzer went on to 
work with German police and as dispatch 
carriers and Red Cross aides. Although still 
at work in some sheep ranches, the Standard 
Schnauzer is a beloved and loyal companion.
Size: Medium; females 171⁄2 to 181⁄2 inches,

Tibetan Mastiff
History/Evolution: Although much of the history 
of the Tibetan Mastiff is lost, the breed is believed 
to be the basic stock from which most modern 
working breeds developed. The Tibetan Mastiff 
was prized by Tibetans living in the Himalayas; 
the massive dogs were traditionally tied to gates 
or stakes and let loose at night to protect livestock 
and masters. A few Tibetan Mastiffs trickled out 
of the region, eventually gaining the attention of 
fanciers in England and beyond.
Size: Giant; females 24 inches and up, 80 to 
110 pounds; males 26 inches and up, 90 to 150 
pounds or more.
Color: Black, brown, and gray, with or without 
tan markings, and shades of gold.

Profiling the Herding Group
In This Chapter
 Characterizing the Herders
 Running circles around the competition
 Choosing a breed for your own flock
 Transitioning from farm to split-level
T
o see a Herding dog in action is to see something quite amazing.
Whether by staring, nipping, stalking, circling, or barking, Herding breeds 
have an incredible ability to control the movement of other animals. The 
work requires great endurance, with constant running and patrolling to keep 
herds or flocks together. These breeds are highly intelligent and able to work 
with a shepherd or rancher to follow commands, but they are also perfectly 
capable of thinking on their own when necessary.
Created in 1983, the Herding Group is the newest AKC classification, made 
up of breeds that were formerly members of the Working Group. Although 
the group is diverse, the breeds are known for their stamina and obedience, 
and are able to follow the signals of their master and execute them with great 
skill.
The job of herder should not be taken lightly; some farmers use one dog to 
herd more than a thousand animals at a time!
Consider the diminutive Cardigan Welsh Corgi: At about a foot tall, this 
remarkable dog can drive an entire herd of cows to their destination. Never 
losing sight of the job at hand, a Corgi runs circles around a herd, moving 
cows together and collecting strays that may escape from the group.
The Shetland Sheepdog, only slightly larger than the Corgi, was bred down to 
its current small size to better control the smaller livestock common to the 
rugged Shetland Islands of the British Isles. The dogs were hardy enough to 

524
Book V: Meet the Breeds 
endure the harsh climate and smart enough to even be left in charge of the 
animals when the farmers weren’t around.
Today most Herding dogs live as household pets, with little or no contact 
with farm animals. With or without livestock, these dogs are still instinctual 
herders and will herd whoever and whatever they can, including other dogs 
and children.
Herding breeds need socialization and close contact with humans, and they 
should have access to both home and yard.
Members of the Herding Group are described as follows:
 
 Loyal
 
 Energetic
 
 Smart
 
 Territorial
 
 Inclined to chase
Herding dogs are happiest when they have a job to do. People who live 
with herders find that exercise, training, and activities such as agility, and 
obedience activities and training provide an outlet for all the energy they 
possess.
Because they are alert and protective, Herding breeds are capable watchdogs 
in the home. Some, such as the German Shepherd and Malinois, are excellent 
police and military dogs and are used in search-and-rescue efforts.

Australian Cattle Dog
History/Evolution: The Australian Cattle Dog 
was developed in Australia in the 1800s when it 
became clear that European herding dogs could 
not withstand the country’s rough terrain and 
climate. Australian cattlemen needed a dog who 
could herd a wilder type of cattle; crosses may 
have included Dingos, Highland Collies, Black 
and Tan Kelpie, and the Dalmatian. Though the 
breed was slow to catch on in the U.S., it has 
proved an untiring and effective herder. The 
AKC recognized the breed in 1993.
Size: Medium, 35 to 45 pounds; females 17 to 19 
inches; males 18 to 20 inches.
Color: Blue or red (mottled or speckled), with 
or without black, blue, or tan markings.
Temperament: Intelligent, independent, 
tenacious, energetic, hardy, and untiring. Loyal 
and protective; suspicious of strangers. Needs a 
job. Herds children, sometime with nips.
Energy level: High.
Best Owner: Active owners with time and 
energy for hard, daily exercise; a family with 
older children and a fenced yard.
Needs: A lot of physical and mental activities 
(more than a walk — think agility course and 
obedience lessons), opportunities to herd, 
regular brushing.
Life expectancy: 10 to 13 years.

Australian Shepherd
History/Evolution: Despite its name, the 
Australian Shepherd probably originated in the 
Pyrenees Mountains between Spain and France; 
the name comes from association with shepherds 
who came from Australia to the western U.S. in 
the 1800s. Ranchers continued to develop the 
breed to its current high level of versatility, 
intelligence, and trainability. Appearances in 
movies, television shows, and rodeos helped 
boost popularity. The breed excels as guide, 
hearing, therapy, and search-and-rescue dogs.
Size: Medium; females 18 to 21 inches, 40 to 55 
pounds; males 20 to 23 inches, 50 to 65 pounds.
Color: Blue merle, red (liver) merle, and black 
or red, all with or without copper and/or tan 
markings.
Temperament: Bold, alert, confident, indepen-
dent, and smart; difficult if lacking a challenge. 
May try to herd children and small animals by 
nips.
Energy level: Medium to high.
Best Owner: Active owner in a rural or 
suburban home.
Needs: Daily workouts with mental and physical 
challenges (agility, flyball, obedience, tracking, 
freestyle), fenced yard, weekly brushing, 
companionship.

Bearded Collie
History/Evolution: Developed in Scotland, the 
Bearded Collie may trace its ancestors to the 
Komondor, British Isles herding dogs, and the 
Poland Lowland Sheepdog. In Scotland, the 
energetic Beardies were tireless sheepherders 
and later gained popularity as show dogs. The 
AKC recognized the breed in 1977. The Bearded 
Collie has loads of fans who enjoy the breed 
as a companion who likes plenty of activity, 
whether in the form of agility, Frisbee, or

Beauceron
History/Evolution: The Beauceron is a French 
herding dog dating back to the 1500s, highly 
valued as a farm dog, drover, and guardian 
of sheep and family. In 1863, the breed was 
differentiated into long-coated (Briard) and 
short-coated (Beauceron). During World War 
I and II, the military used them as messenger 
dogs and mine detectors. Although the breed 
has been relatively unknown outside of France, 
the Beauceron has recently begun to gain the 
attention of fanciers in the U.S. and elsewhere.
Size: Medium to large, 65 to 85 pounds; females 
24 to 261⁄2 inches; males 251⁄2 to 271⁄2 inches.

Belgian Malinois
History/Evolution: The Belgian Malinois shares 
a foundation with other Belgian sheepherding 
breeds, including the Belgian Sheepdog and 
the Belgian Tervuren — Belgian dogs share 
a breed standard in all countries except the 
U.S. Developed in the city of Malines, Malinois

Belgian Sheepdog
History/Evolution: Known as the 
Groenendael, or Chien de Berger 
Beige in most parts of the world, the Belgian 
Sheepdog traces its origins to the late 1800s. 
Like all Belgian shepherds, the breed was an 
accomplished herder and guard. In the early 
1900s Belgian Sheepdogs were gaining a 
reputation as police dogs. During World War I 
and II, they served as sentry dogs, message 
carriers, and ambulance dogs. Today they con-
tinue to serve society well, as guide and therapy 
dogs and as devoted companions.
Size: Medium to large; females 22 to 24 inches, 
40 to 60 pounds; males 25 to 26 inches, 50 to 75 
pounds.

Book V: Meet the Breeds 
Belgian Tervuren
History/Evolution: One of the four Belgian 
shepherd breeds, the Belgian Tervuren’s 
protective instincts and herding abilities made 
it an ideal dog for rural farmers in Belgium. The 
dogs continued as beloved companions even 
after machines gradually took over the breed’s 
farm duties. A drop in numbers nearly caused 
the Belgian Tervuren to disappear by 1930, but 
fanciers have rescued the breed to its current 
moderate popularity.
Size: Medium to large; females 22 to 24 inches, 
45 to 60 pounds; males 24 to 26 inches, 65 to 80 
pounds.
Color: Fawn to mahogany, with black overlay.
Temperament: Alert and energetic; affectionate 
and possessive with family, but observant 
and aloof with strangers. Given exercise and 
challenges, can be well-mannered companion. 
May nip at children’s heels.
Energy level: High.
Best Owner: Active, confident owner who has 
time for training.
Needs: Strenuous daily activity (jogging, serious 
play or working session) and mental challenges 
of obedience, agility, tracking; regular brushing 
and interaction; fenced yard.
Life expectancy: 10 to 14 years.

Border Collie
History/Evolution: The Border Collie is the 
consummate sheepdog. The energetic breed’s 
origins can be traced back to the 1800s, in the 
border country between Scotland and England. 
One accomplished individual, named Hemp, is 
considered the father of the breed; his herding 
skills were considerable, especially his 
intimidating stare. Although many of the breed’s 
devotees wanted to keep the Border Collie out 
of the show ring, the AKC recognized it in 1995. 
Studies suggest that the Border Collie may be 
the most intelligent dog.
Size: Medium; 18 to 20 inches, 30 to 45 pounds.
Color: Black, blue, chocolate, and red, with or 
without white markings or merling.
Temperament: Energetic, intelligent, and an 
intense worker who can be destructive if not 
sufficiently challenged. Loves to chase (not the 
best choice for families with children).
Energy level: High.
Best Owner: Active owners with time for 
exercise or someone who lives on a farm.
Needs: Daily exercise, a job, obedience training, 
fenced yard, regular brushing.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Bouvier des Flandres
History/Evolution: Bouvier means “cowherd” in 
French, and that’s exactly what the Bouvier des 
Flandres did best. Because early individuals of 
the breed were strictly working dogs, the dogs 
came in a variety of sizes and colors. Interest in 
the breed developed in the early 1900s, and an 
accepted standard soon followed. Although the 
Bouvier des Flandres is not extremely popular, 
it is recognized for its excellence in dog shows 
and herding trials.
Size: Large; females 231⁄2 to 261⁄2 inches, males 
241⁄2 to 271⁄2 inches, 60 to 90 pounds.
Color: Fawn to black, salt and pepper, gray, and 
brindle.
Temperament: Steady, resolute, and fearless. 
Loyal, devoted, and protective; reserved with 
strangers and can be aggressive with strange 
dogs. Independent and confident, but willing to 
please.
Energy level: Medium to high.
Best Owner: Strong, confident owner with time 
for training, exercise, and grooming.
Needs: Daily interaction and exercise (herding 
is ideal, but running and playing work), fenced 
yard, cool climate, early training, and regular 
brushing and grooming.
Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years.

Briard
History/Evolution: Records of the Briard, the 
oldest of the four French sheepdog breeds, date 
back to the 1300s. Though the Briard originally 
defended estates and flocks against wolves 
and human intruders, its role developed into 
more of a peaceful herder. The tale goes that 
the breed surfaced in the U.S. with either the 
Marquis de Lafayette or Thomas Jefferson. 
In 1922 the AKC registered the first litter of 
Briards. The breed is still a popular sheepherder 
in France.
Size: Large; females 22 to 251⁄2 inches, 50 to 
65 pounds; males 23 to 27 inches, 75 to 100 
pounds.
Color: Black, gray, and tawny.
Temperament: Naturally protective, fearless, 
reserved with strangers; loyal, loving, gentle 
with friends and family. Intelligent and 
independent, easily trained. May try to herd 
children.
Energy level: Medium.
Best Owner: Firm, confident owner.
Needs: Daily exercise (long walk or jog, play 
session) and interaction (training), early 
training and socialization, frequent brushing to 
prevent matting.
Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years.

Book V: Meet the Breeds 
Canaan Dog
History/Evolution: The Canaan Dog has a long 
and eventful history, beginning in ancient times 
in the biblical Land of Canaan as an adept guard 
and herd dog of the ancient Israelites; when the 
Israelites were dispersed by the Romans 2,000 
years ago, many dogs survived on their own or 
lived with Bedouins, who raised them as guard 
and livestock dogs. Later, Canaan Dogs were 
trained as sentry dogs, messengers, and land 
mine locators. The first Canaan Dogs arrived in 
the U.S. in 1965.
Size: Medium; females 19 to 23 inches, 35 to 45 
pounds; males 20 to 24 inches, 45 to 55 pounds.
Color: White with black, brown, or red markings; 
brown or black, with or without white markings.
Temperament: Devoted, docile, and willing to 
please family; reserved and aloof with strangers. 
Alert, vigilant, and territorial; vocal and 
persistent.
Energy level: Medium.
Best Owner: Active owner in a suburban or 
rural home.
Needs: Plenty of exercise and mental and 
physical challenges; secure fencing, training, 
human contact, weekly brushing, and early 
socialization.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Collie (rough and smooth)
History/Evolution: Long used as herding dogs 
in Scotland and England, the Collie became 
fashionable after Queen Victoria was smitten 
with the breed in 1860. Two varieties of Collie 
exist: rough coated and smooth, the smooth 
and rough varieties are identical in standard 
except for their coats. Settlers brought Collies 
to the U.S. to work sheep farms, and the breed 
continued its rise in popularity. Lassie, the most 
famous rough-coated Collie of all time, further 
solidified the breed’s place in popular history.
Size: Medium to large; females 22 to 24 inches, 
50 to 65 pounds; males 24 to 26 inches, 60 to 75 
pounds.
Color: Sable and white, tricolor, blue merle, and 
white.
Temperament: Sensitive, intelligent, gentle, 
and mild mannered. A devoted family dog; 
especially good with children, but may nip at 
heels. Some bark when left alone.
Energy level: Medium.
Best Owner: Active family.
Needs: Daily exercise (herding is an excellent 
choice), close bonding with family, gentle 
handling, weekly brushing.
Life expectancy: 10 to 13 years.

German Shepherd Dog
History/Evolution: The product of much 
development, the German Shepherd Dog is the 
result of breeder efforts to produce the ideal 
herder and guarder of flocks. The German 
Shepherd possesses it all: strength, dependability, 
intelligence, and courage. Off the farm, the 
breed was quick to prove itself a capable police 
and war dog, and later as a guide, search-and-
rescue dog, and show dog. Thanks to movie 
stars such as Strongheart and Rin Tin Tin, the 
breed’s popularity soared in the 1920s and 1930s.
Size: Large; females 22 to 24 inches, 60 to 70 
pounds; males 24 to 26 inches, 75 to 95 pounds.
Color: All colors except white; typically black 
and tan, sable, and black.
Temperament: Direct, fearless, and protective but 
not hostile; suspicious of strangers. A poised, 
intelligent guardian. Devoted to family; dogs 
from well-bred lines are great with children.
Energy level: Medium.
Best Owner: Active, confident owner or family.
Needs: Daily mental and physical challenges 
(exercise, play sessions, and learning), fenced 
yard, obedience, close human contact, lots of 
brushing (heavy shedder).
Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years.

Old English Sheepdog
History/Evolution: A relatively new breed, the 
Old English Sheepdog originated in the 1800s 
in the west of England, probably a descendant 
of the Scotch Bearded Collie and the Russian 
Owtchar. The dogs drove sheep and cattle to 
market, and were known as “Bobtail” because of 
their docked tails (a sign that they were working 
dogs and exempt from taxes). The dog’s coat 
insulates it from cold, heat, and dampness. 
Though the profuse coat can be a deterrent, the 
Old English Sheepdog is an ideal house dog.
Size: Large; females 21 inches and up, 60 to 
80 pounds; males 22 inches and up, 70 to 90 
pounds.
Color: Gray, grizzle, blue, or blue merle, with or 
without white.
Temperament: Energetic, adaptable, intelligent, 
gentle, and clownish. Devoted, thrives on 
companionship; protective of family members 
and will herd children. Can be headstrong or 
bossy.
Energy level: Medium.
Best Owner: Active, confident owner; families, if 
someone has time for grooming.
Needs: Daily exercise (consider herding), 
fenced yard, human contact, serious brushing 
every other day to prevent matting.
Life expectancy: 10 to 13 years.

Norwegian Buhund
History/Evolution: The Norwegian Buhund 
traces its history to the Vikings, with whom 
they traveled by sea and land; remains of 
the earliest Buhunds were found in a Viking 
grave from about the year 900. The modern 
Norwegian Buhund resembles the refined 
Buhunds of Norway, which guarded farms and 
herded sheep. Today’s Buhund still works with 
livestock and guards home and family — and is 
happy lying at an owner’s feet at the end of the 
day. The AKC recognized the breed in January 
2009.
Size: Medium; females 16 to 171⁄2 inches, 26 to 
35 pounds; males 17 to 181⁄2 inches, 31 to 40 
pounds.
Color: Wheaten, with or without black mask; 
black.
Temperament: Energetic, lively, with great 
stamina; quick learners. Alert, self-confident, 
and independent, but affectionate with people.
Energy level: High.
Best Owner: Active, firm owner or family in a 
suburban or rural home.
Needs: Daily exercise and lots of playtime 
(running/walking, herding, Frisbee, agility), firm 
obedience training, fenced yard, and family 
contact.
Life expectancy: 13 to 15 years.

Polish Lowland Sheepdog
History/Evolution: Known to much of the world 
as the Polish Owczarek Nizinny, the Polish 
Lowland Sheepdog goes by the nickname PON. 
The breed’s origins go back to the early history of 
Poland, with crossings that may include Tibetan 
Terrier and Puli. Because the PONs were smaller 
than some of the larger flock-guarding dogs, they 
didn’t scare the sheep as much and had better 
endurance. The PON survived World War I and 
remains a valued sheepherder and companion; its 
size makes it suitable to apartment life.
Size: Medium, 30 to 50 pounds; females 17 to 19 
inches; males 18 to 20 inches.
Color: Any color.
Temperament: Self-confident, independent, 
willful; more serious than its appearance. 
Affectionate, but territorial and wary with 
strangers. Barks often. Good with children, 
especially when raised with them.
Energy level: Medium to high.
Best Owner: Active, firm, and consistent 
owners.
Needs: Daily exercise for mind and body 
(herding and agility are ideal), fenced yard, firm 
training, socialization, considerable brushing 
and combing of coat.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Puli
History/Evolution: Some believe that Tibetan 
Terriers and sheepdogs of France and Germany 
played a role in this breed’s development in 
Hungary in the Middle Ages. The Puli’s small 
size, speed, and agility made it an excellent 
sheepherder; the unusual corded coat is the 
breed’s natural protector. Crossbreeding nearly 
led to the Puli’s extinction, but Puli devotees 
worked to reconstitute the breed in the early 
1900s. Today the Puli is more a trusted 
watchdog and companion than sheepherder.
Size: Medium, 30 to 35 pounds; females 16 
inches; males 17 inches.
Color: Rusty black, black, gray, and white.
Temperament: Energetic, curious, and smart. 
Protective of family, suspicious, and watchful; 
barks and can be aggressive toward other dogs. 
Home loving and affectionate.
Energy level: High.
Best Owner: Active owner who can handle firm 
and fair training.
Needs: Daily exercise, a job to do (herding 
children or sheep), serious coat care (cording 
and cleaning), training.
Life expectancy: 12 to 16 years.

Pyrenean Shepherd
History/Evolution: Remains of ancient 
sheepherding dogs have been found in the 
Pyrenees Mountains of Southern France, and 
many Pyrenean Shepherds still herd in those 
mountains, but exact origins remain unclear. 
The dogs are relatively small, and so are quicker 
and require less food than larger sheepherder 
dogs. Two varieties exist: Rough-Faced and 
Smooth-Faced. First brought to the U.S. in the 
19th century, the breed earned AKC recognition 
in the Herding Group in January 2009.
Size: Medium; between 15 and 21 inches, 15 to 
30 pounds.
Color: Fawn or fawn with a black overlay, 
brindle, and gray; solid black and blue merle.
Temperament: Energetic and active, dominated 
by a love of work. Devoted and affectionate with 
immediate family, but distrustful of strangers. 
Strong barking instinct.
Energy level: High.
Best Owner: Active owner able to devote time 
to training.
Needs: Daily exercise, fenced yard, inclusion 
in owner’s/family’s activities, training, early 
socialization, regular brushing.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Shetland Sheepdog
History/Evolution: The Shetland Sheepdog’s 
history goes back to the Border Collie, which 
was brought to the Scotland’s Shetland Islands 
and crossed with other breeds to develop the 
Sheltie. The miniature Shetland proved itself to 
be a hard worker, protecting home, flock, and 
herd — and found its way into the hearts (and 
homes) of farm families. The breed earned it 
AKC recognition in 1911 and has continued to 
excel as a dedicated worker, loyal companion, 
and able competitor in obedience, herding, and 
agility trials.
Size: Small to medium; 13 to 16 inches.
Color: Black, blue merle, and sable, with white 
and sometimes tan marking.
Temperament: Loyal, affectionate, and obedient; 
devoted to family and excellent with children. 
Intelligent and highly trainable. Reserved 
toward strangers and barks a lot.
Energy level: Medium to high.
Best Owner: Family or active owner who has 
time for keeping company with a dog.
Needs: Daily exercise and activity (agility, 
herding, conformation), lots of family contact, 
early socialization, brushing every other day.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14-plus years.

Swedish Vallhund
History/Evolution: The Swedish Vallhund is an 
ancient breed with origins that go back to the 
Vikings, when it was known as the Vikingarnas 
Hund, or “Viking Dog.” A small, powerful, sturdy 
breed, the Swedish Vallhund excels as cattle 
drover, watchdog, ratter, and general farmhand. 
Although the Corgi and the SV share some 
similarities, the SV is longer legged and not as 
stocky. The dog faced extinction in Sweden in 
1942 but was rescued by a devoted fan. The 
AKC recognized the breed in 2005.
Size: Small to medium; 12 to 16 inches, 25 to 35 
pounds.
Color: Gray through red and combinations of 
these colors in various shades.
Temperament: Alert, fearless, intelligent. 
Responsive, devoted, and affectionate; loves 
attention and craves leadership. Can be 
overprotective if not trained and socialized; 
may bark a lot.
Energy level: Medium.
Best Owner: Active owner with yard or time for 
daily walks.
Needs: Daily exercise, early socialization and 
training, regular brushing.

Cardigan Welsh Corgi
History/Evolution: The older of the two Corgi 
breeds, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi was brought 
to Cardiganshire (South Wales) from Central 
Europe by the Celts around 1200 BC. Later the 
Corgis served their masters well by driving cattle 
from the farmers’ meager acreage out to the 
common land owned by the Crown. Although 
the breed became less useful when the land was 
sold off and fenced in, it has survived, with the 
Cardigan and the Pembroke officially divided 
into two types in 1934.
Size: Small to medium, 101⁄2 to 121⁄2 inches; 
females 25 to 35 pounds; males 30 to 45 pounds.
Color: All shades of red, sable, and brindle; also 
blue merle or black, both with or without tan or 
brindle points; white markings common.
Temperament: Loyal, affectionate, and even 
tempered; devoted to family, but reserved with 
strangers. Fun and high spirited, with a love of 
antics and tricks. Barks.
Energy level: Medium.
Best Owner: Active owner with time for 
exercise.
Needs: Daily exercise (walk, herding, or play 
session), fenced yard, regular brushing.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Pembroke Welsh Corgi
History/Evolution: The Pembroke Welsh Corgi’s 
history goes back to Pembrokeshire in South 
Wales, where it was brought over by Flemish 
weavers around 1100. Though it shares some 
obvious similarities with the Cardigan Corgi, 
the Pembroke has a shorter body than the 
Cardigan; pointed, erect ears, compared to the 
Cardigan’s rounded ears; and a shorter tail than 
the Cardigan’s. Like the Cardigan, the Pembroke 
is a high-spirited, amiable herder that makes a 
fine farmhand, competitor, and home companion.
Size: Small; 10 to 12 inches, 25 to 30 pounds.
Color: Red, sable, fawn, black and tan; with or 
without white markings.
Temperament: Bold, active (more easily excited 
than the Cardigan Corgi), and quick witted. 
Devoted, amiable, and willing to please. Alert; 
reserved with strangers. Barks. May nip at 
heels.
Energy level: Medium.
Best Owner: Active owner or family.
Needs: Daily physical and mental exercise 
(herding sessions are ideal, but walks or off-
leash training sessions work), weekly brushing, 
human companionship.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Chapter 4
Profiling the Hound Group
In This Chapter
 Characterizing the Hounds
 Learning to live with a super sniffer
 Setting your sights on Sighthounds
 Pursuing the best breed for your lifestyle
D
ogs are known for their keen eyesight and acute sense of smell. After 
all, who hasn’t seen a pup take off after a leaf skittering down a path? 
And what about those wet noses poked out of car windows? Dogs love to set 
their sniffers on a scent. But Hounds, by far, boast the best of these senses.
Most Hounds are bred to be hunters — to spot quarry or follow a trail and 
then have the stamina to keep going for as long as it takes. Part of the Hound 
group’s appeal is that the breed is independent, with instincts so strong that 
commands often aren’t necessary. These dogs understand their job and are 
happy and focused on doing it.
For owners, the problem lies in the fact that a Hound may not be inclined to 
obey a command when one is given, especially if there’s an enticing scent on 
the breeze or a squirrel making a mad dash across the yard. Worse yet is the 
unleashed Hound who sets its sights on the squirrel and takes off without 
regard to safety.
Though all Hounds live to pursue prey, the group is a diverse lot. From the 
showy Afghan to the stocky Basset, the Hounds come in all shapes, sizes, 
colors, and coat types. Consider the Pharaoh Hound: Its stately form, going 
back to ancient times, is built like a Greyhound for speed, but with large, 
upright ears that can home in on animals underground. The Otterhound is a 
sturdier dog built for hunting in and around cold water, equipped with large, 
webbed feet for slippery terrain and a rough coat with an oily undercoat that 
protects it from brambles and chilly English streams.

538
Book V: Meet the Breeds 
Hound temperaments vary as widely as looks. Although all are wired to hunt, 
most are happy to hit the couch or curl up at your feet at the end of the day. 
The desert Hounds such as the Saluki and Pharaoh tend to be aloof and less 
demonstrative. Feisty dogs in small packages, the Dachshund and Basenjis, 
are confident, bold, and often described as Terrier-like. Friendly are the 
Beagles, and Coonhounds are known for their sweet and mellow natures.
Hunters are an obvious choice for Hound ownership, but plenty of athletic 
people — runners, hikers, and other sporty types — can give a Hound the 
outlet he needs for sniffing and chasing. This chase instinct is strong, so all 
Hounds need leashed outings and secure fencing.
Some Hounds, Foxhounds and Beagles among them, produce a unique sound 
called baying — that chattering howl you may have heard in movies when 
Hounds are hunting. Be sure you can live with this sound before bringing one 
of these Hounds into your life.
The Hound Group is divided into two subgroups:
 
 Sighthounds: Also called Gazehounds, these Hounds are some of the 
fastest breeds around, bred to spot and chase prey. The Sighthounds, 
which tend to be sleeker than their Scenthound cousins, include the 
Afghan, Basenji, Borzoi, Greyhound, Ibizan, Irish Wolfhound, Pharaoh, 
Saluki, Scottish Deerhound, and Whippet. Today’s Sighthounds are 
rarely used for hunting; most, however, excel at lure coursing, running 
with their human partners, or competing on racetracks. The typical 
Sighthound is quiet, aloof, and calm.
 
 Scenthounds: Whether they’re tracking scent in the air or on the 
ground, Scenthounds are driven by the need to sniff down prey. 
These dogs typically are solidly built and include the Basset, Beagle, 
Black and Tan Coonhound, Bloodhound, Dachshund, American and 
English Foxhounds, Harrier, Norwegian Elkhounds (though of the Spitz 
family), Otterhound, Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen, Plott, and Redbone 
Coonhound. This group tends to be social; dogs often work in packs and 
live and play together. The group’s sociable nature has helped earn the 
Scenthounds a reputation for being amiable and adaptable companions.
With both talented nose and eyes, the Rhodesian Ridgeback fits into the 
Sighthound and Scenthound groups.

developed in Afghanistan; in the early 1900s, it 
was brought to England. Primarily a coursing 
Hound, the Afghan was a fast, agile, and 
accomplished hunter that at times was paired 
with specially trained falcons. The breed’s 
dignified appearance and silky coat helped 
bring it into the spotlight in the show ring. 
Although the glamorous Afghan was fashionable 
in the 1970s, the breed’s popularity has since 
dwindled.
Size: Large; females 25 inches, 50 pounds; males 
27 inches, 60 pounds.
Color: Any.
Temperament: Aloof and dignified, but with a 
clownish side. Independent hunter. Not overly 
demonstrative with family, reserved with 
strangers.
Energy level: Medium, higher when young.
Best owner: Active owner in a suburban or rural 
home.
Needs: Daily exercise (long walks, sprints, and 
runs), fenced yard, leash, regular and consistent 
coat care.
Life expectancy: 12 years.

American Foxhound
History/Evolution: A native U.S. breed, the 
American Foxhound traces its origins to 
the late 1600s and early 1700s, when it was 
developed from various Hound breeds imported 
from France, England, and Ireland. George 
Washington, who ran a breeding program for 
the breed, is sometimes called the father of 
the American Foxhound. Although the breed’s 
great speed and agility have made it a popular 
choice for hunters, the American Foxhound 
has experienced limited popularity as a pet for 
nonhunters.
Size: Large, 40 to 65 pounds; females 21 to 24 
inches; males 22 to 25 inches.
Color: Any.

Basenji
History/Evolution: The lightly built Basenji 
was used for hunting game in its native 
Central Africa and was prized for its speed and 
intelligence and for its very specialized trait: 
Known as the “Barkless Dog,” the Basenji is a 
silent hunter. However, the Basenji emit joyful 
yodels during play and when greeting family.

Beagle
History/Evolution: Though details of the 
Beagle’s origins are somewhat uncertain, 
Beagle-type dogs were used to hunt rabbits in 
England as early as the 14th century. The sturdy 
breed has undergone changes, but today’s 
Beagle comes in two height varieties. Beagles 
are still used for hunting in packs, but they are 
equally valued for their merry personality and 
loyal companionship. Their intelligence, 
compact size, and care-free coat have made 
them one of the most popular breeds in the U.S.

Black and Tan 
Coonhound
History/Evolution: An all-American breed, the 
Black and Tan Coonhound was developed from 
other Scenthounds used to hunt raccoons and 
bears in rugged terrain. Following in the footsteps 
of their Bloodhound ancestors, the Black and 
Tan trails with nose to the ground and is a 
determined hunter even in the worst conditions. 
The dog’s deep voice enables a hunter to find 
him after he’s treed his quarry. Registered with 
the AKC in 1945, the breed is favored more for 
hunting than as a show dog or pet.
Size: Large, 65 to 100 pounds; females 23 to 25 
inches; males 25 to 27 inches.
Color: Coal black with tan markings.
Temperament: Mellow, even tempered, calm;

Bloodhound
History/Evolution: One of the oldest 
Scenthounds (some have traced the 
Bloodhound to Mediterranean countries in the 
third century), most believe that the breed was 
developed in Europe during the Middle Ages. 
The name refers to blooded hounds, meaning 
they were of pure blood and noble breeding. 
The Bloodhound’s trailing skills in the field of 
law enforcement have earned the breed high 
honors. This highly recognizable dog excels in 
shows and trailing but has enjoyed moderate 
popularity as a pet.

Sighthound, the Borzoi was developed by the 
Russian aristocracy. Known as the Russian 
Wolfhound before 1936, the Borzoi was 
originally bred to hunt wolves, often in packs of 
more than a hundred dogs. The first Borzoi was 
brought to the U.S. from England in 1889; today 
the breed is prized for its beauty and talent in 
the show ring, as well as its skill in lure coursing. 
Farmers in Western states still rely on the 
Borzoi to control coyote populations.

Dachshund
History/Evolution: Developed hundreds of 
years ago in Germany, the Dachshund was bred 
to be a fearless, long-bodied dog who could 
dig a badger out of its burrow and kill it (the 
breed’s name means “badger dog” in German). 
The Dachshund has a sharp sense of smell 
and is an eager hunter, both above and below 
ground. One of the most popular AKC breeds, 
the friendly Dachshund comes in three 
different coat varieties (smooth, wirehaired, 
and longhaired) and can be miniature or 
standard size.

English Foxhound
History/Evolution: Breeding records for the 
English Foxhound date back to the late 1700s in 
Great Britain, where the breed was developed 
to have great stamina and trailing skills. By the 
late 1800s, foxhunting had become extremely 
popular with the wealthy, who built up great 
fanfare around the hunts. The English Foxhound 
was brought to the U.S. and bred with other 
dogs to create the American Foxhound. Many 
people still regard the English Foxhound as the 
first choice when pursuing a traditional hunt.
Size: Large, 24 to 26 inches; females 60 to 80 
pounds; males 75 to 90 pounds.

Greyhound
History/Evolution: With origins going back 
to ancient Egypt, the Greyhound is one of 
the oldest breeds known. Important breed 
developments were made in Great Britain when 
the Greyhound was kept and bred by royalty. 
The Greyhound pursued game by using both 
vision and speed, and was used to hunt deer, 
fox, and hare. Spanish explorers brought 
the breed to the U.S. in the 1500s; the AKC 
recognized the Greyhound in 1885. Today the 
Greyhound is regarded as a sweet and lively 
companion.

Harrier
History/Evolution: Developed in England during 
the Middle Ages, the Harrier was bred to hunt 
hare in packs. The sturdy, large-boned breed 
was tireless and tough but not particularly 
fast, making it a good companion for hunters 
on foot. Harriers have been used in the United 
States for hunting since Colonial times. Though 
not ranked particularly high by the AKC, the 
Harrier serves as a family companion and fine 
competitor in tracking and agility.
Size: Medium; 19 to 21 inches, 45 to 60 pounds; 
females slightly smaller than males.
Color: Any.
Temperament: Outgoing, intelligent, friendly;

Ibizan Hound
History/Evolution: The Ibizan Hound’s roots 
can be traced back to the days of ancient Egypt, 
when sea traders are believed to have brought 
Hounds to the island of Ibiza off the coast of 
Spain. A skilled runner and jumper, the Ibizan 
was used in packs to hunt rabbits in the rough 
terrain of its native land. The elegant Hound 
with amber eyes was brought to the U.S. in the 
mid-1950s. Though a rare breed, the Ibizan is a 
highly regarded competitor and makes an 
excellent family pet.
Size: Large; females 221⁄2 to 26 inches, 45 
pounds; males 231⁄2 inches to 271⁄2 inches, 50 
pounds.

Irish Wolfhound
History/Evolution: An ancient breed, the Irish 
Wolfhound can be found in records dating 
back to AD 391, when royal gifts of the giant 
hunters were made to Rome. Irish Wolfhounds 
fought with their masters, guarded castles, and 
hunted wolves and elk, nearly to the point that 
the dogs’ own existence was at risk. Breeders 
restored the Irish Wolfhound in the 1800s. 
Potential owners must consider the amount of 
space and attention required to keep the Irish 
Wolfhound happy and healthy.
Size: Large; females 30-plus inches, 105 pounds; 
males 32-plus inches, 120 pounds.
Color: Gray, brindle, red, black, white, and fawn.

Norwegian Elkhound
History/Evolution: Though the Norwegian 
Elkhound has its roots in the Spitz family, the 
breed’s tracking abilities have earned it a place 
of honor in the Hound Group. An ancient breed 
that hunted with the Vikings, the Norwegian 
Elkhound is hardy and has the stamina to 
outlast moose, bear, and hunter alike. The 
breed is devoted to the chase but also thrives 
on human companionship, making it a good 
candidate for an active family’s pet.
Size: Medium; females 19 1⁄2 inches, 48 pounds; 
males 201⁄2 inches, 55 pounds.
Color: Gray.
Temperament: Playful, bold, independent. Alert

Otterhound
History/Evolution: Although the Otterhound 
was used to prevent otters from preying on 
fish in the rivers and streams of England, the 
breed’s origins are believed to be in France. 
Otter hunting has since been banned, but the 
Otterhound has found a place with some as an 
amiable companion. The breed’s webbed feet 
help facilitate its love of being in the water, 
whether it’s a river, pool, or puddle. The AKC 
recognized Otterhounds in 1909.
Size: Large; females 23 to 26 inches, 65 to 
100 pounds; males 24 to 27 inches, 75 to 115 
pounds.
Color: Any — usually black and tan, grizzle, red, 
liver and tan, tricolor, or wheaten.
Temperament: Boisterous, amiable, easygoing; 
good with children. May be stubborn and less 
than responsive to training, especially when 
outdoors and a scent is detected.
Energy level: Medium to high as a youngster.
Best owner: Hunter or some other outdoorsy 
type.
Needs: Daily exercise, leash, fenced yard, 
training, companionship (human and canine),

Petit Basset 
Griffon Vendéen
History/Evolution: The Petit Basset Griffon 
Vendéen, or PBGV, originated in the Vendéen 
area of France around the 16th century. Closely 
related to both the Basset Hound and the Grand 
Basset Griffon Vendéen, the low, rough- or 
wire-coated breed was developed to hunt small 
game such as hare over difficult terrain. The 
AKC recognized the PBGV in 1990; since then, 
the breed’s fuzzy appearance and merry manner 
have drawn many fans.
Size: Small to medium; females 12 to 14 inches, 
25 to 35 pounds; males 13 to 15 inches, 30 to 45 
pounds.

Pharaoh Hound
History/Evolution: With origins that can be 
traced back to Egypt circa 3000 BC, the Pharaoh 
Hound is truly an ancient breed. The Pharaoh of 
today bears a close resemblance to its Egyptian 
ancestors: noble, graceful, powerful, and fast. 
The breed has also retained its unique tendency 
to “blush,” with nose and ears turning a rose 
color when the dog is excited. The Pharaoh 
Hound is prized for companionship, hunting, 
lure coursing, and obedience.
Size: Medium to large; females 21 to 24 inches; 
males 23 to 25 inches.
Color: Tan to chestnut, with white markings.

Plott
History/Evolution: When 16-year-old Johannes 
Georg Plott immigrated to America with five 
Hanoverian Hounds in 1750, he probably had 
no idea that a noted hunting dog breed would 
bear his name less than 200 years later. Plott, 
who settled in the mountains of North Carolina, 
developed the powerful breed to hunt boar and 
bear. His dogs earned a reputation for their 
skills, and subsequent crossings only improved 
the breed. Today the Plott is the state dog of 
North Carolina and is used for coonhunting.
Size: Medium to large; 23 to 25 inches, 50 to 60 
pounds.
Color: Brindle, blue, may have black saddle.

Rhodesian Ridgeback
History/Evolution: Developed in South Africa, 
the Rhodesian Ridgeback is the result of 
crossings between European hunting dogs and 
a native dog who had a ridge of hair growing 
down its back. European settlers developed the 
breed to hunt in the African wild and guard the 
farm and family. Originally bred to hunt lions — 
earning its earlier name of African Lion Hound — 
the Rhodesian Ridgeback is still a formidable 
hunter and competitor. Its good looks and 
protective nature have made it a popular pet.
Size: Large; females 24 to 26 inches, 70 pounds; 
males 25 to 27 inches, 85 pounds.
Color: Light wheaten to red wheaten.

Saluki
History/Evolution: The swift and noble Saluki is 
perhaps the most ancient domesticated breed 
of dog, its image visible on pottery from Iran 
circa 3500 BC. Arab nomads used the Saluki 
to run down gazelles, Egyptians depicted the 
breed on tombs and mummified Saluki remains 
to be buried with pharaohs, and English hunters 
relied on Salukis to course hare. Today the 
Saluki’s talents are a bit less dangerous, serving 
as exotic companions and graceful competitors 
in the show ring.
Size: Large, 40 to 70 pounds; females usually 23 
to 28 inches; males 23 to 29 inches.
Color: White, cream, fawn, golden, red, grizzle

Scottish Deerhound
History/Evolution: An accomplished deer 
hunter since at least the 16th century, the 
Scottish Deerhound was valued for its hunting 
prowess by Scottish nobility; for a time it could 
not be owned by anyone ranking lower than 
earl. The breed faced extinction, but breeders 
revived it in the early 1800s. Though relatively 
rare, the Scottish Deerhound can still be found 
in lure-coursing events, in the show ring, and in 
homes of people who have room for such a 
noble giant.
Size: Giant; females 28-plus inches, 75 to 95 
pounds; males 30 to 32-plus inches, 85 to 110 
pounds.
Color: Dark blue gray, gray, brindle, yellow and 
sandy red, and red fawn.

good-size backyard.
Needs: Daily exercise, leash, fenced yard, care 
to prevent bloat, human companionship, soft 
bedding, combing with occasional scissoring 
and stripping.

Whippet
History/Evolution: The Whippet is a medium-
sized Sighthound developed in England in the 
1700s, most likely from small Greyhounds and 
other smaller dogs. At times peasants used 
the Whippet for poaching rabbits, as well as in 
“snap dog” contests, in which dogs competed 
to see which could “snap up” as many rabbits 
as possible before they escaped from a circle. 
Today some people race Whippets; others 
believe the dog belongs in the show ring, in 
lure-coursing events, or in the home.
Size: Medium; females 18 to 21 inches, 20 to 30 
pounds; males 19 to 22 inches, 25 to 40 pounds.
Color: Immaterial.
Temperament: Amiable, gentle, friendly, 
devoted, and demonstrative. Good with 
children. Not good with harsh correction or 
rough treatment. Intense chaser.
Energy level: Moderate.
Best owner: Active, athletic owner.

yards, leash, soft bedding, warmth (coats or 
sweaters a requirement for the cold), minimal 
grooming.

Chapter 5
Profiling the Terrier Group
In This Chapter
 Getting to know the Terriers
 Choosing a Terrier that isn’t a terror
 Understanding the Terrier’s needs
I
n name and in spirit, the dogs of the Terrier Group are down to earth. 
The name terrier is derived from terra, Latin for “earth.” Farmers relied on 
Terriers to control pests — mice, rats, foxes — in fields and stables. These 
dogs were developed to pursue and kill vermin, and many did so by digging, 
or “going to ground,” after their prey. These Terriers had to be energetic, 
brave, and tenacious. For many Terriers, survival depended on their ability 
to fend for themselves.
During the group’s history, some were bred for sport, to kill rats in pit 
contests, and later to fight against each other. Fortunately, such activities are 
no longer legal, but the breeds as a group have retained their original feisty 
nature.
Today’s Terriers appeal to people who are looking for a lot of dog in a small 
package. In general, dogs in this group have a good disposition and can 
become attached to their families.
However, Terriers are not for everyone. True, they are engaging, but they 
require an owner with enough spunk to cope with the Terrier’s distinctive 
personality. On top of that, a Terrier’s level of high-energy play can be 
overwhelming to some people.
Although they don’t demand a lot of attention, a Terrier is likely to become 
bored and destructive without activities to challenge the body and mind. One 
way to fulfill the challenge is to test your dog in Terrier trials. Earthdog tests 
allow Terriers to test their skills in man-made tunnels and courses. Border, 
Wire Fox, Lakeland, and Scottish Terriers are just some of the breeds who 
live for the moment when they’re set loose to pursue some sort of critter 
scent or caged prey.

Book V: Meet the Breeds 
With their strong prey instinct intact, typical Terriers have little tolerance 
for other mammals, including other dogs, gerbils, and cats. They are also 
confident and cocky when challenged, displaying a “You talking to me?” 
attitude. This is good news for someone looking for a protective breed; even 
the smallest of the Terriers will bark to alert you to visitors, whether it’s a 
messenger at the door or a squirrel at the gate.
In general, Terriers are
 
 Feisty
 
 Self-assured
 
 Busy
 
 Inquisitive
 
 Bold
 
 Tenacious
 
 Dominant
Terriers range greatly in size and shape — the fluffy Westie and the muscular 
Bull Terriers bear little resemblance, although all have strong jaws to take on 
prey.
The Australian, Border, and Cairn Terriers are on the small side; the Airedale 
and American Staffordshire are bigger. The vermin-catching Terriers are 
roughly divided into long-legged and short-legged breeds.
Although coats can be smooth or coarse (wiry), medium or long, most 
Terriers are known for their wiry coats that need to be maintained with a 
special grooming technique known as stripping (see the chapters in Book III 
for information on different aspects of grooming).

Airedale Terrier
History/Evolution: Known as the “King of 
Terriers,” the Airedale is the largest of the 
group. Like other Terriers, it is believed to be a 
descendant of the extinct Old English Terrier. 
English hunters fancied its versatile hunting 
skills (badger, otter, and fox are just a few of 
the breed’s quarry). The Airedale’s intelligence, 
protective nature, and looks earned it many 
admirers when it was imported to the U.S. 
Whether companion, police dog, show dog, or 
hunter, the Airedale is truly a champion.
Size: Medium to large; males 23 inches, females 
slightly smaller; 45 to 70 pounds.
Color: Tan with black.
Temperament: Bold, adventurous, intelligent; 
can be headstrong. Good ability to learn, if 
things are kept fun and interesting. Protective; 
some can be domineering.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Outdoorsy owner in a suburban or 
rural home.
Needs: Daily vigorous exercise (long walks, 
hunting excursion), leash, obedience training, 
plenty of interaction, twice weekly combing plus 
scissoring and shaping.
Life expectancy: 10 to 13 years.

American Staffordshire 
Terrier
History/Evolution: Both the American 
Staffordshire Terrier (AmStaff) and the 
Staffordshire Bull Terrier descended from 
the Bulldog and a game Terrier breed. The 
powerful AmStaff was used in the illegal sport of 
dog fighting in England in the 1800s. Although 
sweet and docile, improper handling and training 
by people for fighting has left the AmStaff with 
a less than favorable reputation. Because of its 
intelligence and build, the AmStaff excels at 
obedience, agility, tracking, and conformation.
Size: Medium; females 17 to 18 inches, males 18 
to 19 inches; 40 to 75 pounds.
Color: Almost any solid, particolored, or 
brindled.
Temperament: Playful, affectionate, and friendly, 
but protective of family; can be aggressive with 
other dogs. Stubborn and prone to destructive 
behaviors if not properly exercised.
Energy level: Medium to high.
Best owner: Active owner with previous 
training experience.
Needs: Daily exercise, leash, secure fences, 
bonding and socialization, a job, early training, 
minimal grooming
Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years.

Australian Terrier
History/Evolution: Developed in Tasmania, the 
Australian Terrier was the first native breed 
to be recognized and shown in that country. A 
versatile dog, the Australian Terrier was bred 
to be an all-purpose companion and worker, 
able to control livestock, manage pests such as 
snakes and rats, and guard against intruders. 
Suited to life on the farm, in the city, or some-
where in between, the Australian Terrier thrives 
on equal doses of activity and companionship.
Size: Small; 10 to 11 inches, 14 to 18 pounds.
Color: Sandy, red, or blue and tan.
Temperament: Self-confident, spirited, and 
courageous. Keen and alert, although easier to 
quiet than some other Terriers. Friendly and 
affectionate; adaptable.
Energy level: Medium to high as puppies, 
mellows later.
Best owner: Family or active owner who enjoys 
training.
Needs: Daily exercise (walk or romp in park), 
leash, fenced yard, companionship, weekly 
combing plus twice yearly stripping.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Bedlington Terrier
History/Evolution: Named for England’s 
Bedlington Mining Shire, where it was developed 
in the 1800s, the Bedlington Terrier is one of the 
more unusual members of the Terrier Group. 
The lamblike appearance of the breed is 
deceiving; the Bedlington was bred to be a fast 
and skilled hunter of rat, badger, and other 
vermin. The Bedlington’s curly, woolly coat 
requires work and skill to maintain, but owners 
of the breed often rely on professional 
groomers to keep their dog’s coat in top 
condition.
Size: Medium; females 15 to 161⁄2 inches, males 
16 to 171⁄2 inches; around 20 pounds.
Color: Blue, sandy, liver — each with or without 
tan points.
Temperament: Gentle, mild, and tractable; a 
loyal family pet. Good with children and other 
pets (except squeaky rodents); reserved with 
strangers.
Energy level: Medium.
Best owner: Active family or individual.
Needs: Daily exercise, leash, fenced yard, plenty 
of companionship, regular ear cleaning, comb-
ing once or twice a week, grooming to maintain 
shape.
Life expectancy: 15 to 16 years.

Border Terrier
History/Evolution: The Border Terrier may be 
the oldest of Britain’s Terriers, originating in the 
1700s in the border country between England 
and Scotland. The breed was used to hunt fox, 
which were considered a nuisance to farmers. 
The agile Terrier was fast enough to keep up 
with horses on a hunt, but small enough to 
go underground after a fox. Today the Border 
Terrier excels in agility and earthdog trials; the 
people-oriented breed makes a fine home 
companion.
Size: Small; females 111⁄2 to 14 inches, 12 to 
16 pounds; males 12 to 151⁄2 inches, 12 to 20 
pounds.

independent, curious chaser in the field. Good 
with children and pets other than rodents. 
Enjoys digging and barking.

Best owner: Active family or owner.
Needs: Daily exercise, leash, securely fenced 
yard, weekly brushing plus stripping about four 
times a year.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Bull Terrier
History/Evolution: Bull baiting and dog 
fighting were in vogue in England in the early 
1800s, and patrons worked to breed dogs into 
fighting champions. Crosses between Bulldogs, 
various Terriers, and Dalmatians yielded the 
Bull Terrier, which captured the attention of 
the public. Despite the breed’s somewhat 
unapproachable appearance, the Bull Terrier is 
a friendly and fun-loving dog who has become 
popular as a devoted family pet and exceptional 
competitor in agility and conformation.
Size: Medium; 21 to 22 inches, 50 to 70 pounds.
Color: White, colored variety may be brindle or 
any color.
Temperament: Playful, mischievous, natural 
clowns; may be too exuberant for young 
children. Prone to bursts of energy; can be 
destructive chewers. May be aggressive with 
other dogs and small animals.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Active owner in a suburban or rural 
home.
Needs: Daily mental and physical exercise, 
leash, fenced yard, human companionship, 
obedience training, minimal grooming.
Life expectancy: 11 to 14 years.

Cairn Terrier
History/Evolution: With roots that lie in the Isle 
of Skye and the Highlands of Scotland, the Cairn 
Terrier was originally grouped with Scottish 
and West Highland White Terriers; the breeds 
began to be separated in the early 1900s. The 
Cairn was skilled at hunting prey such as fox 
that lived in the ledges and rock piles (cairns) 
that dotted the farming countryside. A working 
Terrier, the Cairn likes to be busy; today’s dogs 
excel in agility and tracking trials. Made famous 
by Toto in the Wizard of Oz.
Size: Small; females 91⁄2 inches, 13 pounds; males 
10 to 12 inches, 14 pounds.

Good with children, but may be aggressive with 
other dogs. Enjoys chasing and digging; some 
bark.

Needs: Daily exercise, leash, secure fencing (to 
prevent digging), obedience training, weekly 
brushing.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Dandie Dinmont 
Terrier
History/Evolution: Named after Dandie 
Dinmont, a character in Sir Walter Scott’s 1814 
book Guy Mannering, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier 
is an interesting combination of unusual but 
dignified appearance and hunting prowess. 
Overflowing with confidence for such a small 
dog, the Dandie would take on otters, badgers, 
and foxes without hesitation. Although the 
Dandie has retained its strong hunting instincts, 
the breed has somewhat “retired,” instead 
serving as a loyal family pet and companion.
Size: Medium to small; 8 to 11 inches, 18 to 24 
pounds.
Color: Pepper or mustard.
Temperament: Intelligent, dignified, independent. 
Affectionate with family but reserved with 
strangers; aggressive toward strange dogs. 
Good with kids if raised with them. Bold, 
determined, a hunter in the field.
Energy level: Moderately high.
Best owner: Active, confident owner in a 
suburban or rural home.
Needs: Daily exercise (walk or exploring in a 
safe area), leash, secure fencing (some will dig), 
obedience training, twice weekly brushing plus 
regular scissoring and shaping.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Glen of Imaal Terrier
History/Evolution: One of the four Terrier 
breeds native to Ireland, the Glen of Imaal 
Terrier was a working Terrier, able to survive in 
a difficult terrain and conditions. These tough 
canines not only hunted rats, foxes, and 
badgers, but they worked the turnspit at the

numbers dwindled for a time, the Terrier’s 
charm and spirit ensured its survival into 
modern times.

Irish Terrier
History/Evolution: Though the Irish Terrier’s 
origins are uncertain, clues have led some to 
believe that the old Black and Tan Terrier and 
the Irish Wolfhound may have contributed to 
this long-legged Irish breed. Black and tan, gray, 
and brindle were once common colors, but the 
solid red became standard in the late 1800s. 
A bold, courageous, and intelligent breed, the 
Irish Terrier was used as a messenger and 
sentinel during World War I. The breed is 
uncommon today.
Size: Medium; 18 to 20 inches, 25 to 27 pounds.
Color: Shades of red or wheaten.

with strangers. Aggressive toward other animals.
Energy level: High outdoors but calm indoors.
Best owner: Active owner in a suburban or rural 
home.

Kerry Blue Terrier
History/Evolution: Developed in Ireland, the 
Kerry Blue Terrier was an all-purpose farm 
dog — herding livestock, hunting vermin, and 
retrieving over land and water. It wasn’t until 
the 1920s that the breed became known outside 
of Ireland. Kerry Blues are born black, but the 
breed’s striking coat changes color with 
maturity. Though the breed has experience 
limited popularity as a pet, it has excelled as a 
police dog, as well as in herding and trailing.

Lakeland Terrier
History/Evolution: One of the oldest working 
Terrier breeds, the Lakeland Terrier was used 
by farmers in the lake districts of England to kill 
troublesome fox and vermin. With its narrow 
frame, the breed was able squeeze into rocky 
dens to chase after quarry; later, when fox 
hunting became fashionable, the Lakeland 
Terrier joined the hunt scene. Although this 
former working breed is best known today as a 
show dog or companion, Lakelands also do well 
in earthdog trials.
Size: Medium to small; 13 to 15 inches, 14 to 20 
pounds.
Color: Blue, black, liver, red, and wheaten; the 
wheaten may have a saddle of blue, black, liver,

Manchester Terrier 
(Standard)
History/Evolution: Developed in England, the 
Manchester Terrier is a descendant of the 
oldest Terrier breed, the Black and Tan. The 
breed’s development centered on Manchester, 
and it was officially dubbed “Manchester 
Terrier” in 1860. In 1959, the Toy and the 
Standard Manchester were classified as one 
breed with two varieties. The Manchester is 
well suited to home life; however, its hunting 
instincts come to life when it detects a rodent 
or some other small creature that needs to be 
chased.
Size: Small to medium; 15 to 16 inches, 12 to 22 
pounds.
Color: Black with mahogany tan.
Temperament: Observant, busy, independent,

off-lead romp in a secure area), leash, fenced 
yard, consistent obedience training, soft 
bedding, minimal coat care.
Life expectancy: 15 to 17 years.

Miniature Bull Terrier
History/Evolution: Truly a smaller version 
of the Bull Terrier, the Miniature Bull Terrier 
shares the Bull Terrier’s early history. When the 
Bull Terrier breed was developed in the 1800s, 
many were as small as today’s Miniatures; 
eventually, differences in size led breeders 
to divide the Bull Terriers into the Miniature 
and Standard groups. The AKC accepted the 
Miniature Bull Terrier in 1991.
Size: Small; females 12 to 14 inches, males 13 to 
15 inches; 15 to 35 pounds.
Color: White or colored — any color, including 
brindle.
Temperament: Lively, playful, mischievous, 
fearless. Even tempered, sweet, but not overly 
devoted. Independent and stubborn. May be too 
boisterous for small children.
Energy level: Moderate.
Best owner: Confident owner with time for daily 
walks and play.
Needs: Daily exercise, leash, fenced yard, 
patient obedience training, a rodent-free home 
(for example, hamsters and guinea pigs), 
occasional brushing.

Miniature Schnauzer
History/Evolution: Developed in Germany in 
the 1800s, the Miniature Schnauzer may have 
been the result of crossing Affenpinschers and 
Poodles with small Standard Schnauzers. The 
Miniature, the smallest and the most popular 
of the Schnauzers, was exhibited in Germany 
as a distinct breed in 1899; the AKC separated 
the Standard and Miniature in 1933. Today the 
breed is prized for its protective nature, charm, 
and dapper good looks.
Size: Small; 12 to 14 inches, 13 to 20 pounds.
Color: Salt and pepper, black and silver, and 
solid black.
Temperament: Alert, spirited, playful, and

Norfolk Terrier
History/Evolution: For much of their early 
history in England, the Norfolk Terrier and the 
Norwich Terrier were believed to be different 
varieties of the same breed — the Norfolk with 
drop ears and the Norwich with prick ears. Not 
until the 1930s did breeders begin to separate 
the varieties. Though today’s Norfolk is not the 
ratter of its heyday, the breed still loves a good 
chase when out and about with its owner.
Size: Small; 9 to 10 inches, 11 to 12 pounds.
Color: Red, wheaten, black and tan, and grizzle.

Norwich Terrier
History/Evolution: Developed in England, the 
Norwich Terrier and Norfolk Terrier were once 
believed to be separate varieties of the same 
breed; eventually, the two were separated into 
distinct breeds (see Norfolk Terrier), with the 
prick-eared dog as the Norwich. Though 
small, the Norwich was an eager worker and 
a formidable force in ratting and fox hunting. 
Today the breed excels in the show ring but has 
experienced limited popularity as a pet.

Parson Russell Terrier
History/Evolution: Named for the Reverend 
John Russell, an English huntsman of the 1800s, 
the Parson Russell Terrier was first bred to 
hunt fox. Subsequent crossings led breeders 
to change the name to the more commonly 
recognized Jack Russell Terrier, but the AKC 
reinstated the original name in 2003. The 
breed’s weatherproof coat can be wire-haired 
or smooth. Although the breed has experienced 
a jump in popularity (as “Eddie” on the sitcom 
Frazier), it is not a breed for everyone.
Size: Small; 12 to 14 inches, 13 to 17 pounds.
Color: White; white with black or tan markings, 
or a combination of these; tricolor.
Temperament: Outgoing, friendly, energetic,

strangers and older children; may have issues 
with other dogs. Thrives on exercise and 
activity. An escape artist.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Active owner with training 
experience.
Needs: Daily mental and physical exercise, 
leash, fenced yard, training. Weekly brushing 
for the smooth type; the broken coat also needs 
occasional hand stripping.
Life expectancy: 13 to 15 years.

Scottish Terrier
History/Evolution: The Scottish Terrier’s early 
history is confusing, at best, but it’s clear that 
the feisty, bearded “Scottie” was one of a rugged 
group of Terriers used to hunt vermin in the 
Highlands of Scotland. Like other Terriers, the 
Scottie is a fast, strong breed that excelled at 
pursuing prey. The Scottish Terrier has enjoyed 
great popularity over the years, with admirers 
such as King James VI and President Theodore 
Roosevelt, and President George W. Bush.

Sealyham Terrier
History/Evolution: Developed in the 1800s in 
Wales, the Sealyham Terrier was named after 
the estate of a noted breeder of the time. A 
small package of power and determination, 
the Sealyham was an exceptional hunting dog, 
facing badgers, foxes, and otters without fear. 
Although the breed was once a fashionable 
accessory, associated with Alfred Hitchcock, 
Cary Grant, and Elizabeth Taylor, its popularity 
has waned.
Size: Small; 101⁄2 inches; females 21 to 22 pounds, 
males 23 to 24 pounds.
Color: White with lemon, tan, or badger markings.
Temperament: Friendly, charming, playful,

Skye Terrier
History/Evolution: One of the oldest Terrier 
breeds, going back to the 1500s, the Skye 
originated off the coast of Scotland on the Isle of 
Skye. Farmers relied on the plucky, long-haired 
Skye to hunt vermin such as fox, badger, and 
otter. The Skye’s popularity surged in the 
mid-1800s when Queen Victoria declared her 
affection for the breed. The Skye brings its 
natural enthusiasm to whatever task it takes 
on — agility competitor, tracking champion, or 
loyal home companion.

inches, males 11 to 14 inches; 25 to 40 pounds.

Smooth Fox Terrier
History/Evolution: Though its ancestry is 
somewhat uncertain, the Smooth Fox Terrier 
originated in England in the 1700s. With its 
keen nose, excellent eyesight, and stamina, the 
Smooth Fox Terrier helped farmers eradicate 
vermin such as foxes. Until 1984, the Smooth 
and the Wire Fox Terriers were considered one 
breed with two varieties. Though the breed isn’t 
used much for hunting today, the Smooth Fox 
Terrier is highly trainable and does well in 
agility and earthdog trials.
Size: Medium; females 14 to 151⁄2 inches, 15 to 
18 pounds; males 15 to 151⁄2 inches, 18 to 20

Soft Coated 
Wheaten Terrier
History/Evolution: One of the three large Terriers 
of Ireland, the Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier is 
prized for its abundant silky coat. Earlier in its 
history, the breed was developed as an all-purpose 
farm dog who could herd, guard, and hunt. The 
Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier came to the United 
States in 1946, and the AKC recognized it in 1973. 
The breed is versatile — a fine competitor in obe-
dience and agility trials, as well as an affectionate 
companion in the home.

pounds; males 18 to 19 inches, 35 to 40 pounds.

Staffordshire Bull Terrier
History/Evolution: The Staffordshire Bull 
Terrier’s history begins in England in the 1800s, at 
a time when popular sports included rat killing 
and dog fighting. The breed, developed from 
crossings between the Bulldog and the Black and 
Tan Terrier, was fearless, quick, and strong for its 
size. Today less a fighter than lover, the Staffie’s 
temperament has earned him a spot in many 
families as a devoted and affectionate companion. 
The breed earned AKC recognition in 1974.
Size: Medium; 14 to 16 inches; females 24 to 34 
pounds, males 28 to 38 inches.
Color: Red, fawn, white, black, blue, or brindle; 
may have white markings.
Temperament: Amiable, fun loving, docile; 
good with children, but may be too strong and 
lively for little ones. Intelligent and determined; 
owners may need to earn respect with training. 
Perceived association with pit bulls will keep 
intruders away.
Energy level: Medium to high.
Best owner: Active owner with training experience.
Needs: Daily exercise, leash, fenced yard, sturdy 
chew toys, human companionship; early, fair, 
and consistent training; low heat and humidity, 
weekly brushing.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Welsh Terrier
History/Evolution: The Welsh Terrier originated 
in Wales in the 1700s, one of only two Terriers 
native to that country. The compact breed was 
renowned for its gameness and hunted otter, 
fox, and badger. Little has changed about the 
Welsh Terrier in appearance and spirit, and 
owners of today’s Welsh Terriers need to be 
mindful of the breed’s tendency to take off 
and chase. The breed was first brought to the 
United States in 1888.
Size: Medium; 15 to 151⁄2 inches, 20 to 25 pounds.
Color: Black and tan.
Temperament: Spirited, alert, friendly, and 
mischievous; will create own fun if not provided 
with outlets. Good with considerate children, 
but not as much with strangers and other pets 
(cats beware!). Tends to dig and bark.
Energy level: Medium to high.
Best owner: Active family, including a “master” 
with training experience.
Needs: Daily walk or play session, leash, fenced 
yard, obedience training and socialization, 
patient housetraining, combing two to three 
times a week plus shaping every three months.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

West Highland 
White Terrier
History/Evolution: The West Highland White 
Terrier originated in Scotland in the 1800s, 
one of the Scottish Terriers used to hunt fox, 
badger, and other pests. The compact but hardy 
“Westie” was originally known as the Poltalloch 
Terrier, after the home of a Westie breeder; 
the breed was also known for a time as the 
Roseneath Terrier, named for the estate of the 
Duke of Argyle. The confident Westie excels in 
competitions and has become one of the most 
popular pet Terriers.
Size: Small; females 10 inches, 13 to 18 pounds; 
males 11 inches, 15 to 20 pounds.
Color: White.
Temperament: Affectionate, happy, friendly, 
devoted. Alert, curious, determined, loves to 
bark and dig. Good with considerate children 
but not with small animals.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Active owner or family.
Needs: Daily exercise (short to moderate walk, 
backyard game), leash, fenced yard, consistent 
training, combing two to three times a week 
plus shaping every three months.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Wire Fox Terrier
History/Evolution: A descendant of the 
rough-coated Black and Tan Terrier, the Wire 
Fox Terrier was developed in England in the 
1800s to go to ground for fox and other small 
game. Until 1984, the Smooth and the Wire Fox 
Terriers were considered one breed with two 
varieties. Today the Wire Fox Terrier excels in 
the show ring as well as earthdog trials. Owners 
with patience, some training experience, and a 
sense of humor find the breed to be a delightful 
home companion.
Size: Medium; females 14 to 16 inches, 15 to 20 
pounds; males 15 to 17 inches, 20 to 25 pounds.
Color: Mostly white, with black and tan markings.
Temperament: Playful, energetic, adventurous, 
mischievous. Vocal and loves to dig. Thought to 
be scrappier with other dogs than the Smooth 
variety. Good with children, but best for those 
under 6.
Energy level: High, mellows with time.
Best owner: Active owner in a rural or suburban 
home.
Needs: Daily hike, long walk, vigorous play 
session, leash, fenced yard, early and obedience 
training and socialization, combing two to three

 Getting to know the modern hunters
 Understanding the finer points of the breeds
 Choosing a breed that suits your lifestyle
 Learning to live with an energetic dog
T
he “sporting” in Sporting Dogs is less about soccer and baseball than it 
is about hunting. The dogs of the Sporting Group — the Pointers, Setters, 
Retrievers, and Spaniels — were bred to be active, alert, and athletic hunting 
companions. Their primary purpose: to search for and retrieve game. For 
some, this meant flushing small game out of brush; for others, it meant diving 
into icy waters to retrieve fallen waterfowl. The Sporting breeds are known as 
the modern hunters of the canine world because they accompanied hunters 
with guns rather than nets.
Thanks to supermarkets and convenience stores, today’s Sporting dogs are 
not a critical part of stocking the icebox. If you don’t hunt, you’ll need to 
divert your Sporting dog’s boundless energy in other directions. Consider 
jogging, field trials, brisk walks, play sessions, and obedience training as 
potential hunting alternatives. Because Sporting breeds typically are gentle, 
enthusiastic, and eager to please, they’re well suited to family life — as long 
as they get a good dose of strenuous exercise each day. Without it, you risk 
damage to your backyard and home.
If you’re happy to spend a weekend at home reading a good book or 
devoting an entire day to your model airplanes, a Sporting dog probably is 
not the breed for you. If, however, you and your dog can start the day with 
a good jog and then head out in the afternoon for a short hike, your companion 
will happily settle down at your feet for an evening of popcorn and the latest 
movie release. Sporting dogs are real social animals who were bred to enjoy 
working closely with people. Without their people, these breeds are not 
happy campers. Ever seen the look in a black Lab’s eyes as he waits for his 
owner to come out of a store? Dogs such as Spaniels and Retrievers crave 
interaction with humans and truly appear to suffer if ignored or left alone too 
long.

Book V: Meet the Breeds 
The Sporting breeds have long been admired for their instincts and skills 
in water and woods. This group is divided into four types: Pointers, 
Retrievers, Setters, and Spaniels. The breeds presented in this chapter are 
grouped according to these types, each with its own talents and physical 
characteristics. Pointers, Retrievers, and Setters are large; Spaniels run 
smaller. Retriever coats range from short to medium, and most Pointers 
have short hair (some are wiry). The Setters have long hair, and the Spaniels’ 
coats range from medium to long, some with gorgeous curls.
When you’re not out hiking or hunting with your Sporting breed, you may 
find a fenced yard to be a useful part of satisfying your dog’s need for fresh 
air and room to explore. Even better, head out there for a game of catch 
or fetch. You’ll be amazed at how long your dog is capable of playing; 
Retrievers, in particular, are perfectly happy to fetch sticks, balls, Frisbees, 
and so forth for you until your arm is numb.

Brittany
History/Evolution: Named for the French 
province where it originated around 1900, the 
Brittany may have been the result of crosses 
between native Brittany Spaniels and English 
pointing dogs. A fine hunter with a strong nose, 
the Brittany became popular in France, arriving in 
the U.S. in 1925. Equally suited for sport and 
companionship, the Brittany’s popularity has 
surged. Originally called the Brittany Spaniel, the 
“Spaniel” was dropped in 1982 because the breed’s 
hunting style is more like a Setter than a Spaniel.
Size: Medium; 171⁄2 inches to 201⁄2 inches, 30 to 40 
pounds.
Color: Orange and white, liver and white (white 
can be clear or roan).
Temperament: Alert, quick, and curious; loves 
to run and play. Independent but responsive, 
eager to please, affectionate. A good house pet 
if given mental and physical exercise.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Hunter, an active family in a 
suburban or rural home.
Needs: Abundant and daily exercise (runs, 
obedience), fenced yard, regular brushing once 
or twice a week.
Life expectancy: 12 to 13 years.

Pointer
History/Evolution: Though unclear, the 
Pointer’s lineage likely can be linked to 
Greyhounds, Foxhounds, Bloodhounds, and a 
type of setting Spaniel. Pointers were first used 
in the mid-1600s in England to point hares for 
Greyhound coursing. Pointers later became 
popular for recreational bird hunting and, in the 
19th century, as show dogs. Today’s Pointers 
still have the stamina, determination, and skill 
of capable hunters, but are also treasured as 
family dogs and companions.
Size: Large; females 23 to 26 inches, 35 to 65 
pounds; males 25 to 28 inches, 55 to 90 pounds. 
(Field-trial lines tend to be smaller than show 
lines.)
Color: Liver, lemon, black, orange; all with or 
without white.
Temperament: Alert, independent, and dignified. 
Happiest with a job (obedience, agility, field 
trials); can be destructive if not exercised 
enough. Exuberant but tolerant of children.
Energy level: Medium to high.
Best owner: Hunter or active, outdoorsy owner.
Needs: Vigorous physical and mental exercise 
every day, fenced yard, plenty of outside time, 
companionship, regular brushing.
Life expectancy: Field lines 10 to 12 years; show 
lines 12 to 14 years.

German Shorthaired 
Pointer
History/Evolution: Various scent and track 
breeds were crossed to produce what became 
the German Shorthaired Pointer in the late 1800s. 
Proficient with trailing, retrieving, and pointing 
game of many varieties, the German Shorthaired 
Pointer eventually became known as an ideal 
all-purpose hunting dog. First recognized by the 
AKC in 1930, the breed remains a gifted hunter as 
well as a loyal, obedient companion.
Size: Medium; females 21 to 23 inches, 45 to 60 
pounds; males 23 to 25 inches, 55 to 70 pounds.
Color: Liver, liver and white ticked, spotted or 
roan.
Temperament: Intelligent, active, enthusiastic 
about hunting. Devoted, friendly, and willing to 
please. Playful and loving, but can be too 
boisterous for small children.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Hunter or active family in a 
suburban or rural home.
Needs: Consistent exercise and mental 
stimulation to prevent boredom and destructive 
behaviors, gentle training, fenced yard, minimal 
brushing.
Life expectancy: 14 to 16 years.

German Wirehaired 
Pointer
History/Evolution: With traces of Griffon, 
Pointer, German Shorthair, and Poodle, the 
German Wirehaired Pointer is an accomplished 
and versatile hunter. Able to withstand weather 
and water, the German Wirehaired can point 
and track game, retrieve waterfowl from water 
or land, and serve as a reliable guard dog. 
Recognized by the AKC in 1959, the breed enjoys 
moderate popularity in the United States, but not 
nearly as much as it has in its native Germany.
Size: Medium to large; females smaller, but not 
less than 22 inches; males 24 to 26 inches.
Color: Solid liver, liver and white; may have 
spots, roaning, and ticking.
Temperament: Energetic, rugged, independent, 
and driven. Prone to boredom and destructive-
ness if not physically and mentally challenged. 
Loyal and affectionate; aloof and protective, but 
not unfriendly to strangers.
Energy level: Medium to high.
Best owner: Active, outdoor-oriented person.
Needs: Regular exercise or a job to do, training, 
fenced yard, human companionship, minimal 
grooming.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Chesapeake Bay 
Retriever
History/Evolution: The Chesapeake Bay 
Retriever’s history begins in 1807 in Maryland 
with the arrival of two Newfoundlands who 
were rescued from an English brig shipwrecked 
off the coast. Crossings with various retrievers 
and others eventually produced the Chessie, a 
breed that excels at retrieving waterfowl both 
on land and in water. The Chesapeake Bay 
Retriever’s reputation later spread beyond the 
Bay, and the AKC recognized the breed in 1885. 
The Chessie is a true working dog who requires 
a master who is a skilled trainer.
Size: Large; females 21 to 24 inches, 55 to 70 
pounds; males 23 to 26 inches, 65 to 80 pounds.
Color: Brown, from straw to reddish sedge.
Temperament: Hardy, intelligent, and active, 
with a love of water. Independent but eager to 
learn. Strong willed and protective; reserved 
with strangers.
Energy level: Medium to high.

Curly-Coated Retriever
History/Evolution: One of the oldest of the 
Retrievers, the Curly-Coated Retriever is 
believed to have roots in such breeds as the 
English Water Spaniel, a smaller Newfoundland, 
and the Poodle, from which it gets its tightly 
curled coat. Developed in England to be a 
multipurpose hunting Retriever, the Curly is 
favored for its excellent field ability, endurance, 
and courage. Unsurpassed in the water, the 
Curly-Coated makes a fine family companion 
when challenged with exercise and activity.
Size: Medium to large; 22 to 27 inches, 55 to 75 
pounds.
Color: Black or liver.
Temperament: Eager, self-confident, and 
steadfast; determined in the field, sensitive at 
home. Independent; sometimes appears aloof or 
self-willed.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Hunter or active, outdoorsy owner 
in suburban or rural home.
Needs: Daily exercise (swimming and retrieving 
are best) and training to prevent boredom 
(and undesirable behaviors), fenced yard, 
companionship, and occasional combing.
Life expectancy: 8 to 12 years.

Flat-Coated Retriever
History/Evolution: The Flat-Coated Retriever’s 
history can be traced to the 1800s, to dogs who 
served fisherman by retrieving fish and objects 
from the cold waters of Newfoundland. Crosses 
with these Retrievers and British Setters and 
Pointers eventually led to the Flat-Coated, 
which had the skills of both water dogs and 
bird dogs. Originally suited for hard work in 
the field, the Flat-Coated is an enthusiastic 
competitor and family member.
Size: Medium to large, 60 to 70 pounds; females 
22 to 231⁄2 inches; males 23 to 241⁄2 inches.
Color: Black, liver.
Temperament: Lively, sweet, eager to please, 
outgoing, and playful; one of the most devoted 
breeds. Known for its ever-wagging tail. 
Determined in the field, with a great desire to 
hunt.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Hunter, athlete, or active family.
Needs: Vigorous exercise and mental challenges 
(agility and obedience), fenced yard, early and 
consistent training, family bonding, occasional 
brushing and bathing.
Life expectancy: 10 years.

Golden Retriever
History/Evolution: The Golden Retriever was 
developed in Scotland in the late 1800s as a 
hunting dog. Lord Tweedmouth, who wanted 
a Retriever suited to the Scottish terrain and 
climate, is credited with the breed’s beginnings. 
The Golden’s popularity grew, and the breed 
was brought to the United States in the 1920s. 
Although the breed is still valued for its hunting 
abilities, its intelligence, beauty, and eager-to-
please attitude has made it one of the top 
breeds in the U.S.
Size: Medium; females 211⁄2 to 221⁄2 inches, 55 
to 65 pounds; males 23 to 24 inches, 65 to 75 
pounds.
Color: All shades of gold, from pale to rich 
reddish gold.
Temperament: Friendly, devoted, and obedient; 
eager to please as a family companion, with 
excellent rapport with children. Active and 
boisterous; needs exercise and activity.
Energy level: Medium to high; field lines higher 
than show lines.
Best owner: Active, social family in suburban or 
rural home.
Needs: Daily physical and mental exercise (games, 
retrieving, obedience), human interaction, fenced 
yard, twice-weekly brushing.

Labrador Retriever
History/Evolution: Originally from 
Newfoundland in the 1800s, Labs were bred to 
work with fisherman to pull nets and retrieve 
fish. Later the dogs were honed to be game 
retrievers. Although black Labs were initially 
preferred, chocolate and yellow were accepted 
by the early 1900s. The breed’s intelligence and 
adaptability has propelled it into such canine 
careers as guide dog, search and rescue, and 
police work. Extremely gentle and eager to 
please, the Lab is incredibly appealing as a pet 
and remains the most popular breed in the U.S.
Size: Large; females 211⁄2 to 231⁄2 inches, 55 to 70 
pounds; males 221⁄2 to 241⁄2 inches, 65 to 80 pounds.
Color: Black, yellow, and chocolate.
Temperament: Outgoing, amiable, gentle, and 
obedient; nonaggressive toward all. Intense in 
the field, but calm and playful as a home 
companion; patient with kids.
Energy level: High, especially in puppyhood.
Best owner: Active owner or family in suburban 
or rural home.
Needs: Daily physical and mental challenges 
to stay occupied (and avoid pudginess), 
obedience training, secure fencing (around 
yards and pools), weekly brushing.
Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years.

Nova Scotia Duck 
Tolling Retriever
History/Evolution: The smallest of the retrievers, 
the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever was 
developed in the 1800s to toll and retrieve 
waterfowl. Tolling — having dogs play and 
retrieve sticks or balls along the shoreline — 
aroused the curiosity of ducks offshore and lured 
them within gunshot range. The first Tollers 
arrived in the U.S. in 1984, and the AKC recognized 
the breed in 2001. Since their arrival, the dogs 
have proven themselves as able retrievers, 
skilled competitors, and loyal companions.
Size: Medium; females 17 to 20 inches, 35 to 42 
pounds; males 18 to 21 inches, 45 to 52 pounds.
Color: Any shade of red, usually with white 
markings.
Temperament: Energetic, playful, alert, outgoing, 
ready for action; fast learners but bored easily. 
Affectionate and gentle; boisterous when young. 
Good with other animals and children.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Active owner or family in a 
suburban or rural home.
Needs: Lots of exercise, play, and activity; a job 
to do, fenced yard, weekly brushing.
Life expectancy: 11 to 13 years.

Book V: Meet the Breeds 
English Setter
History/Evolution: With a history going back 
400 years, the English Setter is one of the oldest 
gundog breeds. Likely developed from Spaniels, 
the breed would find birds and crouch down 
or “set,” allowing the hunter to (before guns) 
throw a net over the catch. Breeders developed 
the English Setter into two types: the Laverack 
(show setters) and the Llewellin (field setters). 
An elegant and accomplished Sporting dog, the 
English Setter is also a fine show dog, agility 
competitor, therapy dog, and companion.
Size: Medium to large; females 24 inches, 50 to 
55 pounds; males 25 inches, 60 to 65 pounds. 
Color: Orange, blue, lemon, or liver belton 
(white background with colored flecks or roan 
shading), tricolor.
Temperament: Athletic and energetic; a calm 
housedog with enough exercise. Gentle, 
affectionate, and laid back; exuberant, but 
good with children. Thrives on human contact, 
though not a good obedience student.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Active owner or family with a 
suburban or rural home.
Needs: Vigorous daily exercise (hard runs), 
fenced yard, companionship, brushing every 
two to three days (with occasional clipping and 
trimming).
Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years.

Gordon Setter
History/Evolution: The Gordon Setter’s origins 
can be traced to the 17th century in Scotland; 
its name comes from the fourth Duke of Gordon, 
who kept many of the dogs at his castle. Known 
at times as the Gordon Castle Setter and the 
Black and Tan Setter, the breed is the heaviest of 
the three setters. Hunters favored the sturdy and 
muscular Gordon for its bird-setting and retrieving 
skills. Though not as popular a pet as the other 
setters, the Gordon is a lively and devoted 
companion that thrives on exercise and love.
Size: Large; females 23 to 26 inches, 45 to 70 
pounds; males 24 to 27 inches, 55 to 80 pounds.
Color: Black with tan (mahogany or chestnut) 
markings.
Temperament: Intelligent, fearless, and capable 
bird dog. Alert, energetic, and enthusiastic; 
devoted to family. Can get bored or frustrated 
without enough exercise and activity.
Energy level: High, calmer when mature.
Best owner: Athletic, confident owner.
Needs: Daily exercise (a 3-mile walk plus a short 
run), fenced yard, firm and consistent obedience 
training, human interaction, daily brushing to 
prevent mats.
Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years.

Irish Red and 
White Setter
History/Evolution: Although the Irish Red and 
White Setter is rare in the U.S., recognized by 
the AKC only in 2007, the breed has a long 
history that began in 17th-century Ireland. A 
valuable hunting dog and companion, the breed 
was known for its power and skill in the field. 
Thought to be the older of the two Irish Setters, 
the Red and White’s popularity was eclipsed 
by that of the solid-red Irish Setter. It faced 
extinction by the end of the 1800s, but devotees 
revived the breed in the early part of the 1900s.
Size: Large, 50 to 75 pounds; females 221⁄2 to 24 
inches; males 241⁄2 to 26 inches.
Color: White with solid red patches.
Temperament: Friendly, spirited, determined; 
can be high strung without proper exercise. 
Good with children.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Hunter, active owner in a suburban 
or rural home.
Needs: Daily exercise (long walks or off-leash 
runs); fenced yard; early, firm, and consistent 
training; brushing two to three times a week.
Life expectancy: 11 to 15 years.

Irish Setter
History/Evolution: A probable blend of spaniels, 
pointers, and other setters, the Irish Setter 
was developed by Irish hunters who needed 
a skilled bird-setting and retrieving dog large 
enough to be seen from a distance. Originally 
bred as red and white, the solid red of the Irish 
Setter gained favor in the 1800s. The breed’s 
elegant, striking looks have made it a champion 
in the show ring; its good-natured attitude and 
clownish personality have made it a beloved 
companion.
Size: Large; females 25 inches, 60 pounds; males 
27 inches, 70 pounds.
Color: Mahogany or chestnut red.
Temperament: Tireless hunter and an amiable 
companion if exercised enough. Rollicking 
personality, full of gusto, eager to please. Good 
with children, but may be a bit rambunctious 
for toddlers.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Active owner or family in a 
suburban or rural home.
Needs: Lots of exercise (minimum one hour of 
exertion a day), a social life, brushing every two 
to three days, consistent and gentle training 
methods, fenced yard.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

American Water 
Spaniel
History/Evolution: The history of the American 
Water Spaniel is something of a mystery, but 
the breed is likely a product of ancestors that 
include the Irish Water Spaniel and the Curly-
Coated Retriever. Developed in the mid-1800s in 
the Great Lakes region of the U.S., the American 
Water Spaniel was, and is, a remarkable hunting 
companion, the first American breed that could 
retrieve from boats. Although the AKC recognized 
the breed in 1940, it is still uncommon in the 
show ring or the home. It’s the state dog of 
Wisconsin.
Size: Medium, 15 to 18 inches; females 25 to 40 
pounds; males 30 to 45 pounds.
Color: Solid liver, brown, or dark chocolate.
Temperament: Intelligent, friendly, and fun 
loving; a good family dog if given enough 
exercise (if not, prepare for barking and digging). 
Whining and drooling can be a problem.
Energy level: High, calmer when mature.
Best owner: Hunter of upland birds or 
waterfowl, active family in suburbs or country.
Needs: Daily exercise (swims are appreciated), 
fenced yard, human attention, short obedience 
sessions, weekly brushing, attention to ears 
(clean regularly).
Life expectancy: 10 to 15 years.

Clumber Spaniel
History/Evolution: One of the oldest of the 
Spaniels, the Clumber dates back to 18th-century 
France and counts the Basset Hound and the 
Alpine Spaniel among its ancestors. The breed 
was valued for its low build, quiet nature, and 
slow gait, which helped it approach game very 
closely. English nobility favored the breed and 
discouraged its popularity with commoners. 
Although the Clumber is one of the original 
nine breeds recognized by the AKC, it remains 
generally unknown to the public.
Size: Medium; females 17 to 19 inches, 55 to 70 
pounds; males 18 to 20 inches, 70 to 85 pounds.
Color: White with lemon or orange markings.
Temperament: Gentle, affectionate, and 
devoted; the most low key of the spaniels. 
Intelligent and independent; may be aloof with 
strangers.
Energy level: Medium.
Best owner: Hunter, social family in suburban 
or rural home.
Needs: Daily exercise (long walk or leisurely 
hike), fenced yard, positive training, tolerance 
for shedding and drool, brushing two to three 
times a week.
Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years.

Cocker Spaniel
History/Evolution: The American Cocker Spaniel 
is derived from the English Cocker Spaniel, which 
was brought to the United States in the late 1800s. 
Wanting a smaller dog for small game birds such as 
quail, breeders likely crossed the English Cocker 
and smaller dogs to produce the American version; 
the two varieties were separated into two breeds 
in 1946. Although few hunt with the Cocker today, 
the breed — one of the most popular of all time — 
is a favorite at shows and treasured as a pet.
Size: Small, 24 to 28 pounds; females 14 inches; 
males 15 inches.
Color: Solids — black, black and tan, silver, buff, 
red, chocolate, chocolate and tan; parti-color — 
black and white, red and white, chocolate and 
white, tricolor.

English Cocker Spaniel
History/Evolution: The English Cocker Spaniel 
is one of the oldest land Spaniels, a descendant 
of the original spaniels of Spain. In the 1800s, 
the Spaniels were divided based on size and 
hunting ability. The English Cocker, a small land 
Spaniel, was used to hunt woodcock. Fanciers 
worked to differentiate the English Cocker from 
the American type that was gaining recognition; 
the two breeds were accepted as separate 
breeds in 1946. Today the English Cocker is an 
active Sporting dog and loyal companion.
Size: Medium; females 15 to 16 inches, 26 to 32 
pounds; males 16 to 17 inches, 28 to 34 pounds.
Color: White with black, blue, liver, or red 
markings with roaning or ticking; solid black, 
liver, or red with or without tan markings.
Temperament: Affectionate, cheerful, and 
devoted; sociable and likes its humans. More of 
a hunter than the American Cocker Spaniel and 
needs a bit more exercise.
Energy level: High as a puppy, medium as 
matures.
Best owner: Active, social person or family.
Needs: Daily exercise, socialization, consistent 
brushing and combing, monthly clipping, 
special attention to eye and ear care, 
companionship.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

English Springer 
Spaniel
History/Evolution: English Springer Spaniels 
and Cocker Spaniels were originally born in the 
same litters, and not until 1902 did the English 
Kennel Club separate the breeds. English 
Springers, the larger of the two, were used in 
the field for flushing or “springing” animals in 
hiding. The Springer Spaniel continues to 
thrive, gaining popularity with hunters as a 
versatile, vigorous gundog who can both flush 
and retrieve game. Many consider the breed to 
be the ideal family canine companion.
Size: Medium; females 19 inches, 40 pounds; 
males 20 inches, 50 pounds.
Color: Black and white, liver and white, or 
tricolor; may have ticking.
Temperament: Cheerful, playful, and energetic; 
affectionate and devoted to family. Good as a 
house pet if outlets for energy are provided.
Energy level: Medium-high.
Best owner: Active owner in a suburban or rural 
home.
Needs: Daily mental and physical exercise 
(hunting preferred, but obedience sessions and 
field outings will do), fenced yard, twice-weekly 
brushing plus clipping every couple months.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Field Spaniel
History/Evolution: Originating in England in the 
mid-1800s, the Field Spaniel shares its beginnings 
with the Cocker Spaniel but was deemed a 
separate breed in 1892. The long-eared Spaniel 
survived misdirected breeding efforts that 
nearly brought it to the point of extinction. 
Dedicated breeders revived the breed in the 
mid-1950s, honing not only its looks, but its 
hunting abilities. Though admired for its level 
headedness, the Field Spaniel remains one of 
the rarest breeds in the U.S.
Size: Medium, 35 to 50 pounds; females 17 
inches; males 18 inches.
Color: Black, liver, golden liver, roan.
Temperament: Cheerful, affectionate, fun 
loving, and willing to please. Independent, but 
happy to have human companionship and a job. 
May be reserved with strangers.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Hunter, active owner with training 
experience.
Needs: Daily exercise, fenced yard, human 
companionship, inclusion in family activities, 
weekly brushing, tolerance of sloppiness (eating 
and drinking) and shedding.
Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years.

Irish Water Spaniel
History/Evolution: The largest Spaniel, the Irish 
Water is an interesting blend of several dogs: a 
Poodle-like coat, a Retriever’s fetching instincts, 
a Spaniel’s affectionate nature, and a Sporting 
dog’s love of water. The Irish Water Spaniel has 
a smooth face framed with curls 
and its body covered in dense, water-repellent 
ringlets, ending with a signature “rat tail.” An 
adept water retriever, the breed entered the 
American and British show rings in the late 
1800s. Though popular for a time, the Irish 
Water Spaniel is relatively rare these days.
Size: Medium; females 21 to 23 inches, 45 to 58 
pounds; males 22 to 24 inches, 55 to 65 pounds.
Color: Liver.
Temperament: Energetic, enthusiastic, even 
clownish. Can be independent and stubborn; 
needs patient, firm training. Alert and inquisitive; 
reserved with strangers.
Energy level: High as puppy.
Best owner: Hunter, outdoorsy type.
Needs: Daily mental and physical exercise 
(runs, strenuous play, obedience sessions), 
brushing and combing two times a week, 
scissoring every few months.
Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years.

Sussex Spaniel
History/Evolution: The Sussex Spaniel owes it 
name to the kennel in Sussex, England, that was 
an important part of the breed’s development in 
the early 1800s. This small land Spaniel, though 
not as fast as others of its type, had a good nose 
and was skilled at working through dense 
underbrush. Unfortunately, the breed’s popularity 
with hunters was short lived, and the Sussex 
came close to extinction during the 1900s. 
Still rare, the Sussex is treasured by people 
who appreciate its lovely coat and deceptively 
somber expression.
Size: Small to medium; 13 to 15 inches, 35 to 45 
pounds.
Color: Rich golden liver.
Temperament: Cheerful, and mellower than 
other spaniels. Calm in the home, but may bark 
or howl if left out of activities. Fine with animals 
and children.
Energy level: Medium.
Best owner: Family or owner in a suburban or 
rural home.
Needs: Daily exercise (a walk or backyard 
romp), fenced yard, human attention, obedience 
training, early socialization, brushing two to 
three times a week.
Life expectancy: 11 to 12 years.

Welsh Springer Spaniel
History/Evolution: The exact origins of the 
Welsh Springer Spaniel are unclear, but the 
breed likely was developed around the 1600s in 
Wales. The breed enjoyed a rise in popularity 
as a hunting dog of the nobility but lost footing 
as the English Springer and other Spaniels came 
into favor. Brought to the U.S. in the late 1800s, 
the Welsh Springer gained AKC recognition in 
1906. The breed is an accomplished all-purpose, 
all-terrain hunter that excels beyond the field 
into the show ring and home.
Size: Medium, 35 to 45 pounds; females 17 to 18 
inches; males 18 to 19 inches.
Color: Red and white.
Temperament: Active, steady, easygoing. Loyal, 
affectionate, and totally devoted to family, but 
independent; reserved with strangers. Usually 
gentle with children.
Energy level: High as puppy, mellows with age.
Best owner: Active, loving owner in a suburban 
or rural home.
Needs: Daily exercise (long walks and strenuous 
games), socialization, fenced yard, weekly 
brushing, and occasional trims with scissors.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Spinone Italiano
History/Evolution: The Spinone Italiano’s 
origins are somewhat mysterious, although 
most experts credit the Piedmonte district of 
northwest Italy with its development. Theories 
abound; some link the dog to coarse-haired 
Italian Setters, dogs left behind by Greek traders, 
and even French Griffons. Italy’s all-purpose 
hunting dog, the Spinone Italiano is an excellent 
retriever that can hunt on any terrain. Although 
popular in Italy and some other European 
countries, it has not taken off in the U.S.
Size: Large; females 22 to 25 inches, 70 to 80 
pounds; males 23 to 27 inches, 80 to 90 pounds.
Color: White, orange and white, orange roan, 
chestnut and white, chestnut roan.
Temperament: Gentle, devoted, eager to please, 
and affectionate; cautious about new people and 
situations, but good with children. Calmer than 
most pointing breeds.
Energy level: Medium.
Best owner: Hunter, athletic owner in suburban 
or rural home.
Needs: Daily exercise (long walk or off-leash 
run), fenced yard, socialization, training, 
weekly brushing and occasional hand stripping, 
tolerance of messy beard.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Vizsla
History/Evolution: The Vizsla’s history can 
be traced to Hungary in the Middle Ages. The 
country was rich in game, and the Vizsla’s 
superior nose, speed, and hunting ability met 
the needs of the hunters. The breed excelled at 
both pointing and retrieving and was a favorite 
of barons and warlords by the 1700s. Although 
the Vizsla’s numbers declined by the end of the 
World Wars, devotees worked to reestablish the 
breed; the AKC recognized the Vizsla in 1960.
Size: Medium, 45 to 65 pounds; females 21 to 23 
inches; males 22 to 24 inches.
Color: Golden rust.
Temperament: Lively, active, highly trainable; 
a natural hunter. Gentle, affectionate. Well-
developed protective instinct. Can be frustrated 
and destructive without enough exercise.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Hunter, athlete, or active family in 
suburbs or country.
Needs: Strenuous daily exercise (long runs), 
fenced yard, lots of outdoor activity with its 
family, regular brushing to control shedding.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Weimaraner
History/Evolution: Developed in Germany in 
the 19th century, the Weimaraner is believed to 
be a descendant of the Bloodhound and early 
pointing breeds. Originally bred to be an all-
around gundog who could hunt wolves, deer, 
and bear, the Weimaraner later transitioned 
to more of a bird dog and hunting companion. 
The distinctly gray dogs were highly valued, 
and breeding was strictly managed to keep lines 
pure. Not until 1929 did the first Weimaraners 
leave Germany, when an American was allowed 
to bring two to the U.S.
Size: Large; females 23 to 25 inches, 50 to 70 
pounds; males 25 to 27 inches, 70 to 85 pounds.
Color: Mouse gray to silver gray.
Temperament: Friendly, fearless, and obedient; 
can be stubborn or headstrong, but learns 
easily. Needs to run and hunt. Good with 
children, but may overwhelm little ones.
Energy level: Very high.
Best owner: Hunter or outdoorsy, confident 
owner.
Needs: Serious daily exercise, fenced yard, 
human companionship, obedience training, 
brushing.
Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years.

Wirehaired 
Pointing Griffon
History/Evolution: The history of the 
Wirehaired Pointing Griffon begins in the 
mid-1880s. Eduard Korthals of Amsterdam is 
credited with developing the breed, which 
he hoped would be a dog who could hunt in 
marshes and other terrain. He took the dog 
to France, where it was well received and 
quickly gained a following. Known for a time 
as the Russian Setter, the Griffon gained AKC 
recognition in 1887. Today the breed still has 
loyal followers who value it for its pointing and 
retrieving as well as for its companionship.
Size: Medium to large, 50 to 60 pounds; females 
20 to 22 inches; males 22 to 24 inches.
Color: Chestnut, solid or with roaning.
Temperament: Skilled, independent field dog, 
easily trained. Outgoing, eager to please, 
comical, and amiable in the home with enough 
exercise. Generally friendly toward others.
Energy level: Medium to high.
Best owner: Hunter, athletes in suburban or 
rural home.
Needs: Daily exercise (jogging, field runs, 
games), fenced yard, consistent training, weekly 
brushing and some hand stripping, attention to 
ear care.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Chapter 7
Profiling the Non-Sporting Group
In This Chapter
 Defining a diverse group
 Championing some consummate companions
 Finding a breed to suit everyone’s needs
O
kay, so what’s the deal with the Non-Sporting Group? Is it truly a group 
made up of non-sporting types, or is it a catchall category of groupless 
pooches?
In truth, the answer may be a bit of both. The Non-Sporting Group was created 
back in the early days of dog shows, when all the other breeds were neatly 
classified in the Sporting Group. Now that we have several other groups to 
choose from, each of these Non-Sporting breeds could probably fit — or 
almost fit — into another group. But what’s done is done, and there they 
remain.
Members of this group are wonderfully diverse, with great variety in 
appearance, size, temperament, and conformation. The group’s 17 breeds 
have backgrounds that can be traced to retrievers, mastiffs, spaniels, Nordic 
dogs, and more. As far as origins go, the breeds came from all over the 
globe — the Shiba Inu from Japan, the Tibetan Spaniel from the Himalayas of 
Tibet, the Keeshond from the Netherlands, and the Boston Terrier from, well, 
Boston.
These days most of the Non-Sporting breeds dedicate themselves to careers 
as devoted companions, but going back to their roots, these dogs were 
workers of all types: ratters, guard dogs, retrievers, performers, fighters, 
hunters, carriage dogs, herders. Two were lapdogs extraordinaire (a cushy 
job, for sure), and one was even a “good luck” companion.
Because they come from such different stock and were developed for such 
different purposes, the breeds in the Non-Sporting Group are quite distinct in 
appearance and character. Talk about a smorgasbord of personalities, not to 
mention a cornucopia of ears, tails, and coat types!

American Eskimo Dog
History/Evolution: A member of the Spitz 
family, the American Eskimo Dog, or “Eskie,” 
descended from a variety of German spitz, 
with influences from other spitzes such as 
the Keeshond and Pomeranian. Known for its 
beauty, intelligence, and agility, the Eskie was 
an extremely popular performer in traveling 
circuses throughout the U.S. Today’s Eskies are 
primarily companion dogs, although some com-
pete in conformation, obedience, and agility.

Bichon Frise
History/Evolution: Originating in the Medi-
terranean area in the 13th century, the Bichon 
Frise is believed to be the descendant of large 
water spaniels and small, often white, dogs. 
Spanish sailors traded the cheerful breed and 
transported dogs from continent to continent, 
and Bichons found their way into French royal 
courts and Spanish paintings. In the late 1800s, 
the breed fell out of favor, but it survived by 
performing with street artists and in circuses 
and fairs. Bichons make excellent pets.
Size: Small; 91⁄2 to 111⁄2 inches, 14 to 16 pounds.
Color: White.
Temperament: Playful, cheerful, friendly, and 
affectionate. Good with children, other dogs and 
pets, and strangers. Doesn’t like to be alone. 
Some bark a lot.

Boston Terrier
History/Evolution: An all-American dog, the 
Boston Terrier was developed in the 1800s in 
Boston, the result of a cross between an English 
Bulldog and an English Terrier; the Bulldog 
(named Hooper’s Judge) became the ancestor 
of nearly all true Bostons. The breed is nick-
named “the American gentleman” because of 
its characteristically gentle disposition. Highly 
intelligent, the Boston Terrier is an unrivaled 
companion, ranking as one of the most popular 
breeds since the early 1900s.
Size: Small; 15 to 25 pounds.
Color: Brindle, seal, or black, all with white 
markings.
Temperament: Friendly, lively, gentle. Intelligent, 
well mannered, and playful. Reserved with 
strangers and other dogs. Some bark.
Energy level: Moderate to high, mellows 
with age.
Best owner: Active owner with plenty of time 
for companionship.
Needs: Daily exercise, fenced yard, positive 
reinforcement, low heat and humidity, human 
interaction, occasional brushing, patience with 
snoring.
Life expectancy: 10 to 14 years.

Bulldog
History/Evolution: Bulldogs are so gentle it’s 
hard to imagine the life these dogs led in their 
early history, when bull baiting was popular. 
The dogs’ role was to attack the bull, grabbing 
it by the nose. Fortunately, dog fighting became 
illegal, and breeders bred out ferocity while 
retaining the Bulldog’s distinctive physical 
characteristics. The efforts paid off within a few 
generations; today the Bulldog’s lovable dispo-
sitions and adorable mugs make it one of the 
most popular breeds.
Size: Medium to large; 40 to 60 pounds.
Color: Red brindle, brindle, white, red, fawn, 
and piebald.
Temperament: Kind, amiable, mellow, comical. 
Willing to please but can be stubborn. Forms 
bonds and is good with children.
Energy level: Low.
Best owner: Mellow family or individual.
Needs: Daily exercise (a short walk will do), air 
conditioning, motivational training, tolerance 
of drooling and snoring, daily cleaning of facial 
wrinkles.
Life expectancy: 8 to 10 years.

Chinese Shar-Pei
History/Evolution: The Chinese Shar-Pei goes 
back to ancient China, when the dogs were 
general farm dogs, used for hunting, herding, 
and guarding. The Chinese believed the breed’s 
characteristic scowl and black pigmented 
mouth would scare off evil spirits. Although 
most dogs were eliminated after China became 
communist, some Shar-Peis survived in other 
countries. American fanciers rescued the breed 
from extinction, and the breed is one of the 
most recognizable in the U.S.
Size: Medium; 18 to 20 inches, 45 to 60 pounds.
Color: Any solid color.
Temperament: Dignified, sober, self-assured, 
self-possessed. Independent and stubborn. 
Devoted and protective; suspicious of strangers 
and aggressive with other dogs. 
Energy level: Low to moderate.
Best owner: Confident owners with previous 
training experience.
Needs: Daily mental and physical exercise, 
training and socialization, weekly brushing, 
attention to ears and wrinkles, regular nail 
clipping.
Life expectancy: 8 to 12 years.

Chow Chow
History/Evolution: Though its origins are 
unclear, the Chow Chow can be traced back to 
ancient China. An all-purpose working dog, the 
powerful and lionlike dog was used for guarding, 
hunting, and herding. The name Chow Chow 
was adopted after the breed was brought to 
England, and its popularity rose after Queen 
Victoria took an interest. Like the Shar-Pei, the 
Chow Chow is known for its blue/black tongue 
and makes an extremely protective and loyal 
companion.
Size: Medium, 17 to 20 inches; females 50 to 65 
pounds; males 60 to 75 pounds.
Color: Red, black, blue, cinnamon, and cream.
Temperament: Serious, independent, dignified; 
devoted to family, not demonstrative. 
Suspicious of strangers and aggressive with 
other dogs.
Energy level: Low.
Best owner: Confident owner who doesn’t need 
a cuddly canine.
Needs: Daily exercise (casual walks), low heat 
and humidity, socialization, firm training, daily 
brushing for rough coats and weekly for smooth 
coats (more when shedding).
Life expectancy: 8 to 12 years.

Dalmatian
History/Evolution: The Dalmatian’s origin is a 
mystery, but we do know that the breed served 
as war dogs, sentinels, shepherds, ratters, 
retrievers, and even circus dogs. The Dalmatian 
found its true calling as a coach dog in Victorian 
England, protecting horses and adding a touch 
of style. When the auto arrived, the Dalmatian 
continued as a coach dog for horse-drawn fire 
engines. Movies with Dalmatians have spurred 
their popularity, but most people are unpre-
pared for the training involved.
Size: Medium to large; 19 to 23 inches, 45 to 60 
pounds.
Color: White with black or liver spots.
Temperament: Outgoing, energetic; daily 
exercise ensures better manners. Good with 
children when raised with them. Reserved with 
strangers; can be aggressive with dogs.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Active owner in a suburban or rural 
home.
Needs: Daily strenuous exercise, leash, fenced 
yard, consistent training, lots of attention and 
companionship, soft bedding, regular brushing.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Finnish Spitz
History/Evolution: Originally known as the 
Finnish Cock-Eared Dog and the Finnish Barking 
Bird Dog, the Finnish Spitz excelled at hunting 
birds and small game; hunters relied on the 
vocal breed to alert them to prey. Although 
interbreeding threatened the breed’s survival, 
two Finnish sportsmen were able to salvage 
the “Finkie.” More of a companion in the U.S., 
the breed is still used for hunting in Finland. 
With its erect years and plumed tail, the Finnish 
Spitz resembles a lively red fox.
Size: Medium; females 151⁄2 to 18 inches, 23 
pounds; males 171⁄2 to 20 inches, 29 pounds.
Color: Shades of golden red.
Temperament: Active, lively, friendly, eager; 
good with children but often devoted to one 
person. Aloof with strangers, aggressive with 
strange dogs. Barks.
Energy level: Moderate.
Best owner: Active owner or hunter.
Needs: Daily exercise, leash, fenced yard, 
human interaction, reward training, tolerance 
of barking, brushing twice a week (more when 
shedding).
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

French Bulldog
History/Evolution: The French Bulldog 
probably owes much of its good looks to the 
English Bulldog. English lacemakers fancied toy 
versions of the bulldogs, taking their dogs with 
them when they were displaced to France. With 
their small size and “bat ears,” the little bull-
dogs became popular; in the late 1800s, 
they became known as French Bulldogs. The 
clownish breed continues to be prized for its 
affectionate nature and even disposition.
Size: Small; 11 to 14 inches, 20 to 28 pounds.
Color: A variety — often brindle, cream, 
black-masked fawn, and pied.
Temperament: Amiable, sweet, adaptable, well 
behaved. Affectionate and cuddly. Alert and 
active, but not boisterous or barky.
Energy level: Moderate.
Best owner: Senior citizen or family.
Needs: Minimal daily exercise, leash, tolerance 
of drooling and snoring, cleaning of facial 
wrinkles, weekly brushing, low heat and 
humidity.
Life expectancy: 9 to 11 years.

Keeshond
History/Evolution: One of the spitz breeds, 
the Keeshond has a history that can be traced 
to Holland in the 1700s, where it served as a 
watchdog on the barges and riverboats of the 
Rhine River. The breed, named for Kees de 
Gyselaer, the leader of the Dutch Patriot party, 
became a symbol of that party. Although many 
of the dogs were disposed of when the party 
lost, the breed survived, aided by farmers and 
boatmen. The Keeshond is now the national dog 
of Holland.
Size: Medium; females 17 inches, 35 pounds; 
males 18 inches, 40 to 45 pounds.
Color: Gray, black, and cream.
Temperament: Outgoing, friendly, intelligent, 
affectionate; thrives in a family. Alert but a 
friend to all; good with children and other dogs.
Energy level: Medium.
Best owner: Family in a home with a backyard.
Needs: Daily moderate exercise, companionship, 
brushing once or twice a week and more when 
shedding.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Lhasa Apso
History/Evolution: The Lhasa Apso originated 
in Tibet’s Himalayan Mountains near the city 
of Lhasa. The bold, hardy dogs served as 
watchdogs in Buddhist monasteries; Buddhists 
believed that the souls of lamas entered the 
dog’s bodies when they died. The breed was 
first brought to the U.S. around 1930, as gifts 
of the 13th Dalai Lama. With a cloak of hair 
that parts down the back from head to tail, the 
Lhasa is not a breed for those who don’t care 
for grooming.
Size: Small; 10 to 11 inches, 11 to 18 pounds.
Color: All.
Temperament: Independent, alert, bold; 
stubborn but trainable. Content after exercise. 
Good with older children; reserved with 
strangers.
Energy level: Low to medium.
Best owner: Dog groomer in training.
Needs: Daily exercise, leash, early socialization 
and training, dedicated grooming (brushing 
every or every other day).
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Lowchen
History/Evolution: The Lowchen’s history 
began about 400 years ago, most likely in 
Germany, where the breed served as a foot 
warmer and companion to ladies of the court. 
The name means “little lion dog” in German; 
the breed’s trademark is its traditional lion 
trim, with the coat left untrimmed on the 
forequarters (the mane) and clipped close on 
the hindquarters. Although the breed nearly 
disappeared in the 19th century, dedicated 
breeders ensured its continued existence.
Size: Small; 12 to 14 inches, 12 to 18 pounds.
Color: Any.
Temperament: Affectionate, lively, devoted, 
outgoing, inquisitive. Intelligent, highly 
trainable. Alert; may bark or dig a lot.
Energy level: Medium.
Best owner: Retiree or quite family.
Needs: Daily exercise, mental challenges 
(obedience, agility), plenty of attention; 
brushing or combing every other day, clipping.
Life expectancy: 14 to 16 years.

Poodle (Standard 
and Miniature)
History/Evolution: Today’s Poodles were 
developed in Germany as water retrievers; the 
trademark poodle clip was designed by hunters 
to help the dogs move through the water, the 
remaining hair left on to keep vital organs warm. 
The breed, which became popular in France, 
comes in three varieties: Standard (the oldest), 
Miniature, and Toy. The Poodle’s low-shed 
coat may reduce allergic reactions but requires 
extensive grooming. Poodles are one of the top 
ten most popular breeds.
Size: Small and large; Miniature 10 to 15 inches, 
12 to 20 pounds; Standard 22 to 27 inches, 40 to 
80 pounds.
Color: Blue, gray, silver, brown, café-au-lait, 
apricot, cream
Temperament: Miniature is playful, responsive, 
obedient, devoted; good with children, may 
bark a lot. Standard is intelligent, obedient, 
active, playful; good with older children.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Active owners with dedication to 
grooming.
Needs: Daily exercise (more for Standards), 
mental challenges (obedience), leash, fenced 
yards, companionship, daily grooming plus 
clipping and scissoring every five weeks.
Life expectancy: Miniature, 14 to 16 years; 
Standard 10 to 13 years.

Schipperke
History/Evolution: It’s possible that this bold 
dog originated in Belgium, a smaller version 
of a black Belgian Sheepdog. Schipperke dogs 
worked as watchdogs and ratters on river 
barges, where the breed likely got the name 
Schipperke, after the Flemish word schip, meaning 
“boat.” Known for its mischievous expression, 
bold nature, and watchdog qualities, the 
Schipperke does well with supervision and 
training. Enjoys conformation, agility, and 
obedience competitions.
Size: Small; females 10 to 12 inches, males 11 to 
13 inches; less than 18 pounds.
Color: Black.
Temperament: Active, confident, curious. 
Interested in everything, faithful watchdog; 
protective, reserved with strangers. May bark.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Active owner with time for training.
Needs: Daily exercise, mental challenges, leash, 
fenced yard, patient housetraining, air condi-
tioning, weekly brushing (more during sheds).
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Shiba Inu
History/Evolution: The Shiba Inu is the smallest 
and perhaps oldest of the six dog breeds native 
to Japan. Of Spitz heritage, the Shiba was 
originally developed for hunting small game and 
boar. Although the bombing raids of World War 
II and distemper nearly caused the breed to die 
out, bloodlines were interbred to produce the 
breed as it is known today. Alert watchdogs 
and adaptable companions, the Shiba Inu has 
established itself as the number-one companion 
dog in Japan.
Size: Small to medium; females 131⁄2 inches to 
151⁄2 inches, males 141⁄2 inches to 161⁄2 inches; 18 
to 25 pounds.
Color: Red, red sesame, black/tan, black 
sesame, and brindle; may have white markings.
Temperament: Bold, spirited, headstrong. 
Adaptable and well mannered if properly 
exercised. Reserved with strangers; an excellent 
watchdog.
Energy level: Moderate.
Best owner: Active owner in a rural or suburban 
home.
Needs: Daily vigorous exercise, leash, fenced 
yard, early and continuing obedience training, 
socialization, brushing once a week.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Tibetan Spaniel
History/Evolution: Originating in Tibet in 
ancient times, Tibetan Spaniels were prized as 
pets and companions in Tibetan monasteries. 
Like the other two Tibetan breeds — the Lhasa 
Apso and Tibetan Terrier — the Tibbies were 
highly valued. The lionlike dogs were excellent 
watchdogs and would sit on monastery walls 
and bark when strangers or wolves approached. 
Tibbies are popular primarily in Tibet but are 
found in conformation, obedience, and agility 
rings in the U.S. 
Size: Small; 10 inches, 9 to 15 pounds.
Color: All.
Temperament: Outgoing, friendly, intelligent. 
Aloof with strangers, alert; excellent alarm 
system. Good; considerate with children and 
other dogs.
Energy level: Medium to high.
Best owner: Retiree with time for socializing.
Needs: Daily exercise (minimal), leash, twice-
weekly combing and brushing (more during 
seasonal shed).
Life expectancy: 15 to 18 years

Tibetan Terrier
History/Evolution: The Tibetan Terrier was 
bred and raised in Tibetan monasteries 
almost 2,000 years ago. The dogs, developed 
to withstand the harsh terrain and climate of 
the remote “Lost Valley” of Tibet, were often 
given as a “luck bringer” to safeguard visitors 
on the return trip. One such visitor returned to 
England with a dog, obtained another, and then 
began a breeding program. The Tibetan Terrier 
is not a terrier at all, having only been given the 
name because of its terrier size.
Size: Medium to small; 14 to 17 inches, 18 to 30 
pounds.
Color: Any.
Temperament: Devoted, sensitive, and 
affectionate; Intelligent, independent, even 
mischievous. Cautious and reserved with 
strangers. Best with gentle children.
Energy level: Moderate, low to moderate 
with age.
Best owner: Family with older children.
Needs: Daily exercise, fenced yard, leash, 
brushing or combing twice a week, patient 
training.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Profiling the Mixed Breeds
In This Chapter
 Deciphering the mixed breeds
 Looking at the history of mixes and crossbreeds
 Taking on designer dogs
 Getting to know some popular crosses
W
hat is a mixed breed? A mutt? A devoted companion? A Cockapoo? 
How about a Chiweenie? The answer to all these questions is yes. 
Although mixed breeds sometimes get an undeserved bad rap from the more 
snooty purists, these types of pooches have legions of devoted fans and are 
becoming increasingly popular, no doubt because of the relatively recent 
trend of so-called “designer dogs,” such as Goldendoodles, Puggles, and 
Schnoodles.
Mixed breeds are nothing new. From the dawn of canine history, intact male 
and female dogs have met and, during the heat of the moment, started 
something new. The results of these couplings come in a rainbow of colors, 
weigh from 5 to 95 pounds, and have coats that are wiry or silky, long or short, 
straight or curly. But what they do have in common is their uniqueness — no 
two are alike.
Mixed breeds taken to the next level are called designer dogs, combinations 
of two purebred dogs. These pups are purposely crossed (no random unions, 
thank you) to create a specific appearance and temperament. The idea of 
designer mixes took off in the 1990s, thanks to a crossbred pioneer called the 
Labradoodle, a mix of Labrador Retriever and Poodle. Once an accessory of 
celebrities, today’s crossbreeds are often sought after by people with deep 
pockets who are looking for small, agreeable, or low-allergy versions of 
purebreds.
This chapter tells the story of mixed breeds, from Heinz 57 to designer, 
including the famed Labradoodle. Though trendy today, designers are not 
without controversy, so their pros and cons are both considered. Because all 
mixes — intentional and unintentional — combine the characteristics of the 
parent breeds, this chapter covers the general characteristics of the various 
dog groups and gives profiles of 17 mixed breeds and designer dogs.

594
Part V: Meet the Breeds 
Introducing the Mixed Breeds
The mixed breeds are a diverse lot — mutts and designers, companions and 
competitors. By definition, a mixed breed is a dog conceived by two different 
purebreds or mixed breeds (or a purebred and a mixed breed). Because the 
terminology is important and can seem confusing, some additional definitions 
may be in order:
 
 Purebred: Dog with ancestors who are members of a recognized breed; 
the ancestry of a dog remains consistent over many generations.
 
 Crossbred: Dog who is the offspring of two different purebred dogs of 
different breeds. The Cockapoo, a cross between a Poodle and a Cocker 
Spaniel, is a well-known crossbreed.
 
 Hybrid: Although the word hybrid technically refers to the result of 
crossing animals of two different species (horse and zebra, for example), 
it is generally accepted to use the term interchangeably with crossbred.
 
 Designer dog: The name associated with crossbred dogs deliberately 
developed, most during the last few decades (see this chapter’s “Delving 
into Designer Dogs” for more information).
Some mixed breeds may be more mixed than others. In fact, a mix may have 
some purebred ancestors in its lineage; other mixes come from a long line of 
mixed breeds. In many cases, a mix’s ancestors are vague, at best, and some 
are simply identified by the most recognizable breed of the mix — “Shepherd 
mix,” “Beagle mix,” or “Lab mix,” to name a few.
Making sense of mixed breed history
Take a look at the history of nearly any purebred dog, and you’ll read about 
breeders who played the mating game, introducing other breeds to early 
purebreds to improve coat, temperament, height, weight, strength, and so 
on. Along the way, some accidental intermingling occurred as well.
So if mixed breeds have been around for so long, then what’s all the fuss 
about crossbreeds, hybrids, and designer dogs? Consider the Silky Terrier, 
developed in Australia in the late 1800s by crossing native Australian Terriers 
with Yorkshire Terriers imported from England. The breeders were successful 
in improving the Australian’s coat color, and a standard was developed and 
accepted in 1926. Although the breed hasn’t topped the Yorkshire in terms of 
popularity, the Silky earned its place with the AKC as a breed and continues 
to attract followers.

595
 Chapter 8: Profiling the Mixed Breeds
Book V
Meet the 
Breeds
The mating game continues today. In the 1950s, it was the Cockapoo and the 
Pekapoo. Then came the Labradoodle in the late 1980s (see “The mix heard 
’round the world” sidebar). Breeders discovered that certain crossbreeds 
had traits that made them popular companions, so they worked to produce 
dogs who had these characteristics:
 
 Low-shedding, low-dander coats, a benefit for people with allergies
 
 Fewer physical problems found in some purebreds, such as the breathing 
issues of short-nosed breeds like the Pekingese, Shih Tzu, and Pug
 
 Improved temperament and trainability
At play here is the concept of hybrid vigor, which means that careful breed-
ing of mates from two different breeds can result in a stronger or improved 
mix. Although some breeders use the term indiscriminately when discussing 
mixed breeds, offspring likely will have a combination of good and bad traits 
from both parent breeds.
Hitting the big-time
With all the attention focused on mixed breeds these days, it’s no surprise 
that organizations are getting involved. Since 1978, the not-for-profit Mixed 
Breed Dog Clubs of America (MBDCA) has supported owners of mixed 
breeds. Unlike the American Hybrid Club of America, the MBDCA is an actual 
club, not just a registry, and has members and elected officers as well as a 
The mix heard ’round the world
When Wally Conron, a breeding manager for 
an Australian guide dog association, set out 
to help a visually impaired woman find a guide 
dog that her allergic husband could live with, he 
had no idea he was embarking on an adventure 
in genetics that would change the way people 
think of mixed breeds. It seemed simple enough: 
Breed a Labrador Retriever (the center’s choice 
for guide dogs) with a Poodle, a breed known 
for a low-shed, curly coat.
After a good deal of trial and error, in the 
late 1980s, Wally found himself with the 
Labradoodle, a crossbreed with a Poodle-type 
coat and Labrador-type temperament. The 
Labradoodle has led to a great deal of change 
in the dog breeding world. This dog was the 
first mixed breed that people were willing to 
pay thousands of dollars to have. It’s the breed 
that launched the careers of many other Poodle 
hybrids. It’s also the breed that replaced the 
classic Scottish Terrier game token in a special 
edition of the Monopoly board game. Go figure.

596
Part V: Meet the Breeds 
code of ethics. Under the code, all members must agree to spay and neuter 
their mixes. Through the club, which has a limited number of local chapters 
throughout the United States, owners of mixed breeds can enter their dogs in 
competitions of obedience, conformation, tracking, and more.
After years of consideration, the American Kennel Club announced in 2009 that 
it was creating a program for mixed breeds. Owners of mixes can now enroll 
their pets and receive an AKC competition card. Since April 2009, enrolled dogs 
have been able to compete in mixed breed classes at stand-alone AKC agility 
and obedience events, as well as in rally events, the organization’s newest 
performance competition. Although the mixed breeds will not be registered as 
breeds with the AKC, this move signals a big step for all mixes.
Delving into Designer Dogs
With catchy names and celebrity owners, designer dogs have certainly 
captured attention. Some people are taken by the dogs’ unique looks; people 
with allergies are interested in particular designers strictly for the promise 
of a low-sneeze companion. Why else, some would ask, would anyone pay 
thousands of dollars for a dog they could just as easily find at an animal 
shelter?
Now, most mixed breeds — as wonderful as they are — are products of 
unplanned coupling. When handled responsibly, designer dog mixes are bred 
for specific characteristics, whether appearance, temperament, or both.
Although they have quickly risen in popularity, designer dogs are not without 
controversy. This section covers the pros and cons of designer dogs.
The Pros
Because such a wide variety of designer dogs are available, prospective 
owners may be able to find a dog who suits their individual needs — size, 
coat, temperament, protective nature, and so on.
Many of the designer dogs are bred to have specific characteristics, and in 
doing so, breeders may reduce or eliminate certain problems associated with 
the purebred parents.
Some people believe that the offspring of two different breeds will have 
hybrid vigor and, because of greater genetic diversity, may be less likely to 
inherit generic diseases carried from one purebred generation to the next — 
problems including epilepsy, hip dysplasia, and dental issues. Of course, this 
theory applies to all mixed breeds, not just hybrids and designer dogs.

597
 Chapter 8: Profiling the Mixed Breeds
Book V
Meet the 
Breeds
The Cons
Although each designer dog is bred to have specific traits, there are no 
guarantees. The mating game is a game of chance, and breeders can’t 
determine which traits the hybrid offspring will inherit from the parents. 
This truth applies to both appearance and personality. In fact, in some cases, 
offspring may inherit negative traits from both parents.
Designer dogs are pricey, which is a major drawback for many people. Many 
designer dogs cost as much as or more than purebred dogs, with price tags 
that can reach into the thousands of dollars, particularly for trendy breeds.
Although the idea of hybrid vigor — that mixing two breeds can improve the 
offspring’s health — has some truth, it is not an absolute. A designer dog’s 
health cannot be guaranteed to be better than the health of the purebred 
parents.
Many people believe that the practice of breeding designer dogs is contributing 
to the already overwhelming problem of unwanted dogs in this country. Dogs 
who are less than desirable or unsellable may end up in shelters, taking up 
much-needed space and resources.
Some people worry that the trendy nature of designer dogs will lead to 
unscrupulous breeding practices by breeders who see this fad as a quick way 
to make a buck. This type of breeder is not concerned about health, of either 
the parents or the offspring.
Getting Some Breed Insight
A certain degree of the unknown arises when it comes to predicting the 
outcome of a pairing between mixed breeds. The same is true, perhaps to a 
lesser extent, with crossbreeding. Will your Shepadoodle be more German 
Shepherd or Poodle? Your Beagalier more Beagle or Cavalier King Charles 
Spaniel?
Compounding the unpredictable nature of crossbreeding is the sheer number 
of combinations that are possible (just because a hybrid is possible doesn’t 
mean it’s a good idea). The American Canine Hybrid Club, a registry service 
for hybrid dogs, currently lists nearly 600 different crossbreeds (www.achclub.
com/modules.php?name=Breeders). This chapter can cover a mere 
fraction of these crosses, but understanding the personality and appearance 
of some of the breed groups can help you understand a mix, whether it’s a 
cross of two breeds or a mixed breed of unknown descent. Other chapters in 
this book profile the seven groups the American Kennel Club uses to categorize 
dogs. Although all dogs are individuals, look to these chapters for insight 
about the general characteristics of each group:

598
Part V: Meet the Breeds 
 
 Sporting: Includes the Retrievers, Setters, and Spaniels; 27 breeds.
 
 Hound: Includes Sighthounds like the Greyhound and Afghan, and 
Scenthounds such as the Basset and the Beagle; 23 breeds.
 
 Working: Includes breeds such as the Bullmastiff and Newfoundland 
that were developed for guarding and pulling sleds; 26 breeds.
 
 Terrier: Includes energetic dogs such as the Bedlington and Scottish 
Terriers that were bred to hunt and kill vermin; 27 breeds.
 
 Toy: Includes small breeds such as the Maltese and Pekingese that were 
developed as lapdogs and companions; 21 breeds.
 
 Non-Sporting: Includes an eclectic variety, such as Dalmatian and 
Poodle crosses; 17 breeds.
 
 Herding: Includes a variety of dogs, like the Chow Chow and the Shiba 
Inu; 17 breeds.
 
In addition to the 20 crossbreeds profiled in this chapter, looking at some 
general characteristics of some of the popular types of mixes may be helpful 
when it comes time to choose your special mix.
Poodle pairings
Beginning with the Cockapoo and the Labradoodle, some of the most popular 
crossbreeds have been dogs with a Poodle parent. Poodles have a lot to offer 
when it comes to crossbreeding — four sizes, high intelligence and trainability, 
and a low- to no-shed coat that makes the breed very appealing to people 
with allergies. Other poodle crosses include the following:
 
 Goldendoodle (Golden Retriever and Poodle)
 
 Yorkiepoo (Yorkshire Terrier and Poodle)
 
 Shepadoodle (German Shepherd and Poodle)
 
 Pekapoo (Pekingese and Poodle)
 
 Schnoodle (Schnauzer and Poodle)
 
 Terripoos (various terriers and Poodle)
Pug pairings
Currently the most popular cross is the Puggle, an appealing mix of Pug and 
Beagle that first rose to stardom in cities, often attached to such celebrities 
as Uma Thurman and James Gandolfino. Pugs typically are sweet, loyal, and

intelligent, with easy-to-care-for coats. Unfortunately, their short noses make 
them prone to respiratory problems. The Puggle often inherits the longer 
snout of the beagle, which reduces or eliminates the breathing problems 
associated with the Pug. Other Pug mixes include these:
 
 Pugland (West Highland Terrier and Pug)
 
 Pugshire (Yorkshire Terrier and Pug)
 
 Bassug (Basset and Pug)
 
 Buggs (Boston Terrier and Pug)
Toy pairings
The Puggle appeals to many because of its compact size. Other diminutive 
and Toy breeds have become popular crossbreed candidates because of 
their small stature. Known as pocket dogs, they are usually a cross between 
two Toy breeds, such as Maltese, Pekingese, and Shih Tzu; many tend to have 
good personalities and longevity. Though they may look like fluffy accessories, 
these Toy crosses require the same care as any dog. Some of the smallest 
hybrids include these:
 
 Silkese (Maltese and Silky Terrier)
 
 Yorkinese (Yorkshire Terrier and Pekingese)
 
 Poshies (Pomeranian and Shetland Sheepdog)
 
 Snorkie (Miniature Schnauzer and Yorkshire Terrier)
Bichon Frise pairings
With a low-shed, low-dander coat, the Bichon Frise is a likely candidate for 
crossings. A small, white dog with a perky personality, the Bichon has been 
matched with Toy breeds to produce dogs who may inherit some of the 
breed’s qualities. Bichon hybrids include these:
 
 ChiChon (Bichon Frise and Chihuahua)
 
 Havachon (Bichon Frise and Havanese)
 
 Maltichon (Bichon Frise and Maltese)
 
 Pekachon (Bichon Frise and Pekingese)
 
 Poochon (Bichon Frise and Poodle)
 
 Shihchon (Bichon Frise and Shih Tzu)

Part V: Meet the Breeds 
Border Collie pairings
Border Collies are hardy, intelligent, and highly trainable dogs, and hybrids 
of this breed are often developed to take advantage of these qualities. Bred 
more for intelligence than coat type, Border Collie crosses are typically 
focused and hardworking. The Borador, a cross with the Labrador Retriever, 
is one of the most popular of the Border mixes.
The Border Jack is a cross between the Border Collie and Jack Russell (now 
Parsons Russell) Terrier. With the speed of the terriers and the trainability of 
the Border Collies, the Border Jack has the best of both breeds — and loves 
to prove it in the competition arenas of flyball and agility.
 
For more information on many of these crossbreeds, read this chapter’s 
individual breed profiles, which include details on size, temperament, 
history, and needs.
Playing detective
Not sure of your mixed breed’s ancestry? Join 
the club. It’s not uncommon for mixes to be a 
puzzling blend of a little of this and a little of 
that. But you may just figure out the breeds that 
make up your dog by doing a bit of research. 
Look at photos of purebreds to see if you can 
find similarities in appearance. You say that 
your dog’s tongue is spotted? Chances are, 
a Chow Chow or Chinese Shar-Pei is part 
of your pooch’s family tree. Your canine 
companion has a short nose and snores like 
your grandfather? Hmm . . . check out the Pug, 
Pekingese, or other brachycephalic types. The 
same goes for personality. Traits associated 
with Herders, Hounds, Terriers, and the other 
groups can tip you off to your dog’s origins. If 
you’re willing to put down some cash, you can 
check out companies that test dog DNA for you, 
such as www.canineheritage.com.

Aussiedoodle
History/Evolution: Also known as the 
Aussiepoo, the Aussiedoodle is a cross of the 
Miniature or Standard Australian Shepherd 
and the Toy, Miniature, or Standard Poodle. 
Although the Australian Shepherd is a heavy 
shedder, the Aussiedoodle may inherit the 
Poodle’s low-shedding, low-dander coat — a 
plus for people with allergies. Aussiedoodles 
may also retain the Australian Shepherd’s herd-
ing skills and merle coat colors.
Size: Varies: A miniature Aussiedoodle is about 
13 to 18 inches, 15 to 30 pounds; a medium or 
large Aussiedoodle is about 20 to 30 inches, 25 
to 50 pounds.
Color: A variety, including black, blue merle, 
red merle, and red.
Temperament: Intelligent, even tempered, 
energetic, loyal. Reserved with strangers; 
patient with children when raised with them.
Energy level: Active without being hyper.
Best owner: Active family in a rural or suburban 
home.
Needs: Daily exercise (brisk walk, agility), leash, 
fenced yard, socialization, regular grooming 
(shaggy or poodle clip), training, ear cleaning 
(removing hair).
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Bagel
History/Evolution: The Bagel is a cross between 
the Beagle and the Basset Hound. Though not 
as popular as some of the more well-established 
mixes, the short-coated Bagel has the loving 
personality one would expect from two Hounds, 
plus the potential for some stubbornness. The 
crossing may prove beneficial to some problems 
associated with the long-backed Basset. 
Potential owners should ask about back problems 
as well as epilepsy, inherited in Beagles.
Size: Small to medium; 10 to 15 inches, 20 to 50 
pounds.
Color: Tricolor hound colors.
Temperament: Loving, devoted, even tempered. 
Also independent and willful. Usually good with 
children and other dogs and pets.
Energy level: Medium.
Best owner: Active family.
Needs: Daily exercise, leash, fenced yard, early 
socialization, training, regular brushing.
Life expectancy: 10 to 15 years.

Beagalier
History/Evolution: A cross between a Cavalier 
King Charles Spaniel and a Beagle, the Beagalier 
was first bred in Australia in the 1990s, focused 
on reducing the Beagle’s scent-hunting drive 
and wandering tendencies. The crossbreed may 
have a positive effect on health problems 
associated with the Cavalier, including heart 
conditions and other issues related to the 
shortened face. The typical Beagalier has a 
good temperament and resembles both parent 
breeds.
Size: Small to medium; 12 to 16 inches, 10 to 25 
pounds.
Color: Black, white, or tricolor.
Temperament: Sweet, intelligent, playful, good 
natured, calm; good with considerate children. 
May get distracted by scents. Does not like to 
be alone.
Energy level: Medium.
Best owner: Active individual or family in 
suburban or rural home.
Needs: Daily exercise, leash, fenced yard, 
regular brushing (both parent breeds are 
shedders), obedience training.
Life expectancy: 12 to 14 years.

Borador
History/Evolution: The Borador’s combination 
of Border Collie and Labrador Retriever seems 
to make sense. The two breeds excel at agility 
and trainability, raising breeders’ hopes that 
they’ll come up with a flyball or agility champion. 
Plus, the Lab influence may help to mellow out 
the Border Collie’s need to chase and work all 
the time. The Borador pairing typically yields a 
friendly, easy-to-train breed with an attractive 
short or medium-length coat.
Size: Medium to large; 17 inches, 35 to 45 
pounds.
Color: Varies; typically black with white Border 
Collie markings on nose, paws, and neck.
Temperament: Sweet, affectionate, friendly. 
Some herd children; may be overexuberant at 
times. Loyal to family, not usually aggressive to 
strangers.
Energy level: Medium.
Best owner: Active owner in suburban or rural 
home.
Needs: Daily mental and physical exercise (long 
walks, fetch, agility), leash, fenced yard, chew 
toys, weekly brushing.
Life expectancy: 12 years.

Border Shepherd
History/Evolution: Like the Borador, the Border 
Shepherd’s combination of Australian Shepherd 
and Border Collie was made in the hopes of 
creating a canine performance champion. 
Also known as the Border-Aussie, the Border 
Shepherd is high energy and intense and may 
not be particularly friendly; look for parents 
with good temperaments who enjoy human 
companionship. The breed has a short-to-
medium coat that sheds.
Size: Medium; 15 to 22 inches, 35 to 55 pounds.
Color: Varies; includes black and white, blue 
merle, red merle, and tricolor.
Temperament: Energetic, intelligent, intense, 
trainable. Reserved with strangers; some can be 
snappy and less tolerant of children.
Energy level: High.
Best owner: Athlete or someone who enjoys 
performance training.
Needs: Daily strenuous exercise, job or activity 
(flyball, agility), socialization, obedience, weekly 
brushing (more when shedding).
Life expectancy: 10 to 15 years.

Cavachon
History/Evolution: The Cavachon (or 
Cavashon) is a cross between the Cavalier 
King Charles Spaniel and the Bichon Frise. The 
Bichon, like the Poodle, has a high-maintenance 
but low-shedding and low-dander coat. The 
Cavalier is small and sweet tempered, so 
Cavachons may suit allergy sufferers looking 
for a small, good-natured companion. Research 
and careful screenings help identify potential 
health issues, such as eye problems found in 
both breeds.
Size: Small; 11 to 17 inches, 12 to 25 pounds.
Color: Black and white, red and white, sable and 
white; solid or tricolor.
Temperament: Affectionate, intelligent, lively, 
good natured. Family oriented, nonaggressive. 
Good with considerate children. Loves family 
activities.
Energy level: Medium.
Best owner: Family or owner who enjoys 
grooming.
Needs: Daily exercise (walk, fetching games); 
leash, socialization, housetraining; regular 
bathing, brushing, clipping, and grooming.
Life expectancy: 10 to 12 years.

Cockapoo
History/Evolution: Bred since the 1950s, the 
Cockapoo is one of the older crossbreeds. Two 
types exist: the American Cockerpoo (Poodle 
crossed with American Cocker Spaniel) and 
English Cockapoo (Poodle crossed with English 
Cocker Spaniel). The cross varies in size, 
depending on the size of Poodle. Cockapoos 
may inherit the Poodle’s low-shedding, low-
dander coat and the sweet disposition of the 
Cocker. The Cockapoo Club of America was 
founded to assist breeders.
Size: Small, but ranges: Teacup, less than 6 
pounds; Toy, less than 12 pounds; Miniature, 13 
to 18 pounds; Maxi, more than 19 pounds.
Color: All combinations of colors.
Temperament: Affectionate, vigorous, loyal, 
friendly. Intelligent and trainable. Usually fine 
with children and other animals. People 
oriented; may bark if left alone.
Energy level: Low to medium, but playful.
Best owner: Active family.
Needs: Daily exercise, leash, early socialization 
and training, daily brushing and combing plus 
professional grooming several times a year, 
regular ear care.
Life expectancy: 12 to 15 years.

Goldador
History/Evolution: Two extremely popular 
breeds — the Labrador Retriever and the 
Golden Retriever — are crossed to get the 
Goldador, a large dog known for its good 
temperament and intelligence. Bred for its

low-dander dogs — the Maltese and the Shih 
Tzu — the Maltese Shih Tzu was developed in 
Australia in the 1990s. Also known as the 
Mal-Shi or Malt-Tzu, this small crossbreed may

Puggle
History/Evolution: A recent star in the world of 
crossbreeds, the Puggle is a cross between two 
popular breeds, the Pug and the Beagle. This 
sturdy dog with a distinctive face may inherit 
the Pug’s good nature and the Beagle’s longer 
snout, which may help to reduce the breathing 
problems often associated with the Pug’s 
brachycephalic head. Urban dwellers attracted 
to the compact size of the Puggle need to 
provide it with plenty of exercise and attention.
Size: Small; 13 to 15 inches, 18 to 30 pounds.
Color: Fawn, tan, red, black, lemon; may have 
white markings and a black mask.

Schnoodle
History/Evolution: A cross between the 
Schnauzer and the Poodle, the Schnoodle was 
developed in response to demand in the 1980s 
for Poodle mixes. Schnoodles vary in size 
and temperament, depending on the parents 
involved. Schnoodles may inherit the Poodle’s 
coat and intelligence; health issues such as 
skin conditions, eye problems, and epilepsy 
may occur. Some breeders work with multigen-
erational lines, with the goal of developing the 
Schnoodle as a recognized breed.
Size: Varies greatly — parents may be Toy, 
Miniature, or Standard Poodles crossed with 
Miniature, Standard, or Giant Schnauzers.
Color: Gray, silver, black, apricot, brown, white; 
often a mix.

Part V: Meet the Breeds 
Shepadoodle
History/Evolution: With less than a decade of 
breeding, the Shepadoodle is a relatively new 
mix — a cross between the German Shepherd 
and the Poodle. The Poodle parentage may help 
reduce the shedding associated with German 
Shepherds. Both breeds are intelligent and do 
well with a dominant owner. Some believe the 
cross has potential as a working dog, perhaps in 
herding or as a therapy dog. Be aware of genetic 
problems such as eye disease and hip dysplasia.
Size: Varies: Standard size 20 to 28 inches, 50 to 
90 pounds; Miniature 17 to 20 inches, 20 to 50 
pounds.

Shihchon
History/Evolution: The Shihchon (also Bi-Tzu 
and Zuchon) is a cross between the Shih Tzu 
and the Bichon Frise. The Shihchon coat may 
have the low-shedding, low-dander qualities 
of the Bichon; it may also benefit from having 
fewer problems associated with the brachyce-
phalic head of the Shih Tzu. The mix doesn’t 
like to be alone and enjoys the company of 
humans, whether on a lap or on a neighborhood 
walk, making it an ideal companion for retirees.
Size: Small; 8 to 11 inches, 9 to 16 pounds.
Color: Any.
Temperament: Energetic, social, outgoing, and 
affectionate. Good with older children. Usually 
nonaggressive but alert; will bark to announce 
visitors.

Yorkiepoo
History/Evolution: The Yorkiepoo (also 
Yorkipoo) has been bred for a decade or so, the 
result of a cross between the Yorkshire Terrier 
and the Toy or Miniature Poodle. Like other 
Poodle crosses, the Yorkiepoo may be low-
shedding and is often soft and silky. The typical 
small size of the dog is appealing to older 
owners and people who live in apartments; keep 
in mind, however, that the Yorkiepoo is a lively 
dog who still needs exercise.
Size: Small; 7 to 15 inches, 4 to 14 pounds.
Color: Many, including white, sable, cream, 
silver, tan, chocolate, and black.
Temperament: Energetic, playful, curious, self-
confident; Intelligent and trainable; some may 
be stubborn. Alert and watchful; tends to bark.
Energy level: Medium.

Some of a dog’s body parts have familiar, human-sounding names, but some are particular to the species.

Training classes are a terrific 
way for your dog to socialize, 
exercise, and have loads of 
fun — and they’re usually 
just as fun for people.
Dogs respond to praise for a job well done — go ahead 
and kiss, hug, pat, ruffle the ears, and scratch under 
the chin whenever your dog does what you want.
Using treats to enhance dog training is a 
great strategy, especially for dogs who love 
food. Gradually stop giving treats when the 
dog performs as desired and replace with 
enthusiastic praise.

Agility training takes play 
instincts to a much higher 
level, into the realm of sports 
technique. Dogs appreciate 
the chance to up their game as 
much as human athletes do.
You’re never too young to begin agility 
classes, as this happy puppy illustrates — 
in fact, the younger a dog starts, the more 
refined and ingrained agility skills become.

Most dogs retain the instincts that assist in the jobs they were bred for, even if those jobs are now obsolete. These dogs have 
been genetically developed to hunt foxes, and they are still very good at their jobs.
A sheep herding dog knows just how to handle stubborn livestock with a stern hand without actually doing them harm.

These sled dogs are obviously in 
ecstasy pulling their sled through 
winter landscapes.
The primal hunting instinct to chase and capture easily translates to games that are 
a blast for canine and human alike.

Dog show judges check and examine every aspect of show competitors.
All show dogs must conform to breed standards, including color, size, and body form.

Breeding dogs involves getting 
out of the way so the mother can 
provide for her young.
Regular check-ups and staying up 
to date on vaccinations are key to 
taking care of a dog.
Most dogs don’t like vet visits 
any more than people like going 
to the hospital.

When it comes to dogs and leisure time, the 
more the merrier. Be sure to socialize your dog 
as much as possible.
Many dogs are happiest in the company 
of other dogs and often develop lifelong 
friendships.
Dogs and kids have 
always been best 
buddies. Kids teach 
dogs tolerance and 
patience toward 
people, and dogs 
teach kids respect 
and responsibility for 
other beings.
