Preface
Preface
Research, development and industrialisation of renewable energy are currently moving at a rapid pace 
worldwide. Biofuels play significant roles in decarbonisation of our future energy needs and act to mitigate 
deleterious impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. Liquid transportation biofuels (bioethanol and biodiesel) 
now represent key contributors to the bioenergy portfolios in many countries. National governmental 
obligations and international directives are mandating the blending of biofuels in petrol (gasoline) and 
diesel and these are acting as great stimuli to this industrial sector. Bioethanol – fermentation-derived 
fuel alcohol – is the world’s leading transportation biofuel and is mainly produced from starch (as in 
the US) and sugar (as in Brazil) feedstocks. However, the future lies with more sustainable fermentation 
substrates, including biowastes from agriculture and woody biomass. Lignocellulose-to-ethanol processes 
still pose many scientific and technological challenges, but we are now moving from demonstration 
pilot-plants to full scale industrial facilities. 
This book provides a timely overview of biomass-to-bioethanol conversion technologies and is aimed 
mainly at advanced undergraduate students of biological and environmental sciences. I hope that readers 
will find it useful.

Introduction

1.1	
What is bioethanol?
Bioethanol is fermentation alcohol. That is, it refers to ethyl alcohol (ethanol – see Fig 1.1) produced 
by microbial fermentation processes, as opposed to synthetically produced ethanol from petrochemical 
sources. It is produced through distillation of the ethanolic wash emanating from fermentation of 
biomass-derived sugars. It can be utilised as a liquid fuel in internal combustion engines, either neat or 
in blends with petroleum (see Table 1.1).

Introduction
The flash point of ethanol is the lowest temperature (i.e. 12.8°C) where enough fluid can evaporate to 
form an ignitable concentration of vapour and characterises the temperature at which ethanol becomes 
flammable in air. The ignition point of ethanol is the minimum temperature at which it is able to burn 
independently (i.e 425°C). Ethanol has a high octane rating (99), which is a measure of a fuel’s resistance 
to pre-ignition, meaning that internal combustion engines using ethanol can have a high compression 
ratio giving a higher power output per cycle. Regular petrol (gasoline) has an average octane rating of 
88. Ethanol’s higher octane rating increases resistance to engine knocking, but vehicles running on pure 
ethanol have fuel consumption (miles per gallon or kilometres per litre) 10–20% less than petrol (but 
with no loss in engine performance/acceleration). 
In the 1920s, Henry Ford designed his famous Model T-Ford, the world’s first 
mass-produced car, to run on ethanol.

Introduction
Bioethanol can also be used in ethanol gels (domestic cooking), fuel for electric power, in fuel cells 
(thermo-chemical action), in flueless fires (eg. http://www.kost-alcohol.com/flueless.html) and in power 
co-generation systems. Anhydrous bioethanol has additional applications as a progenitor for other 
chemical commodities such as ETBE (ethyl tertiary butyl ether, a gasoline additive) and polyethylene 
terephthalate, PET (packaging, bottles).
Bioethanol represents the largest volumetric production of any microbially-produced 
biofuel, with current annual worldwide production around 100billion litres (Renewable Fuel 
Association). The global leaders in bioethanol are USA with current production approaching 
~50billion litres (from maize) and Brazil with ~35billion litres (from sugarcane).
Bioethanol is an example of a renewable transportation fuel, the other major one being biodiesel from 
plant oils or animal fat (not covered further in this book). Table 1.3 outlines the pros and cons of ethanol 
as a biofuel.
Pros
Cons
CO2 neutral 
Reduced dependence on oil 
Allows agricultural diversification 
Clean burning, low toxicity 
Higher flash points (better fire safety) 
Better biodegradability 
Co-generation of electricity 
Low GHG emissions (~65% less than petrol) 
Food-to-fuel is unethical
Economics driven by oil price, which is dynamic
Un-sustainability of some biomass sources
Unfavourable energy balances
Inefficiency of fermenting microbes
Hydroscopic nature of liquid
Higher fuel consumption (c.f. petrol)
Some residues, emissions may be harmful
Table 1.3 Some pros and cons of ethanol as a biofuel
The main advantages of bioethanol are that the fuel is renewable and that is not a net contributor to 
greenhouse gas emissions (unlike fossil fuels). This is due to the fact that the biomass cultivated for 
bioethanol is able to re-fix (by photosynthesis) the carbon dioxide produced during bioethanol production 
and combustion. 
Drawbacks include the fact that agricultural land may be used for biomass production for biofuel and 
this may impact adversely on food security. In addition, the use of genetically-modified organisms has 
a perceived detrimental environmental impact from the general publics’ perspective. However, as will 
be outlined later in this book, these disadvantages can be ameliorated by using “second generation” 
feedstocks (eg. from waste lignocellulosic material) together with modern chemical technology and 
biotechnology. It has also been recently reported that future biofuel production in the EU can be secured 
without increasing the overall land area used for food crops (see www.biofuelsnow.co.uk).

Introduction
The predominant microorganism responsible for ethanolic fermentations is the yeast species, Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae, but other yeasts and certain bacteria have future potential (see Chapter 4). 
Yeasts like S. cerevisiae are described as ethanologenic, in that they have a propensity to 
convert sugars via a metabolic pathway known as glycolysis to ethanol, carbon dioxide, and 
numerous other secondary fermentation products.

Other microbial biofuels are biogas (methane from bacterial anaerobic digestion), biobutanol (a 
re-emerging technology using Clostridium spp. of bacteria) and biohydrogen (future potential), and 
are summarised in Fig 1.2. Recent research (eg. Steen et al, 2008) has also shown that S. cerevisiae can 
be genetically engineered (using Clostridium spp. genes) to produce n-butanol, and several companies 
are developing butanol (and isobutanol) production processes form yeast (eg. Gevo Inc – http://www.
gevo.com/; Butalco – www.butalco.com). It is important to note that butanol exhibits several advantages 
over ethanol as a fuel, not least its better combustibility, amenability to storage and transportation and 
miscilibility with diesel.
1.2	
Economic aspects
The cost of bioethanol production is variable depending on the source of biomass (Table 1.4). If we assume 
that production costs for gasoline are 0.25 Euro/L, then this emphasizes the need to have governmental tax 
rebates in closing the price gap between biofuel and fossil fuels. Economic drivers for the production and 
consumption of all biofuels are inextricably linked to the global price of oil. This is obviously a dynamic 
situation (with increasing oil prices improving the case for biofuels) but Table 1.4 provides examples of 
bioethanol produced from various feedstocks and compares their production costs. It is apparent that 
for first-generation bioethanol feedstocks, Brazilian sugarcane represents one of the cheapest.

Introduction
The figures presented in Table 1.4 are approximations due to fluctuating raw material costs. For example, 
the US corn ethanol production costs are based on $4 bushel corn (32 lbs of starch and 2.8 gals of 
ethanol). The 2010 cost of sugar cane is at a historial high and current ethanol production costs from 
this feedstock are estimated at around $0.35 per litre. Lignocellulosic biomass costs are highly feedstock 
dependent (eg. waste wood and paper costs will vary widely depending on locality and transport costs). 
Lignocellulose-to-ethanol production costs would be expected to become lower in the future as new 
technology improves the overall conversion processes (see Chapters 3 and 4). 
Biomass feedstock costs represent the predominant expenditure in bioethanol production, with first-
generation feedstocks generally 50–80% of total costs, whilst for lignocellulose bioethanol processes, 
the feedstock costs are only ~40% of total costs (Petrou and Pappis, 2009). The total value of second-
generation bioethanol in the US is estimated to grow from 380 million Euro in 2010 to over 13,000 
million Euro by 2020.
Fuel ethanol prices are negotiated between the buyer and seller and those prices are not publicly 
reported. Information on historical price data can be obtained from: www.usda.gov; www.opisnet.
com; www.platts.com; www.dtnethanolcenter.com; www.jordan-associates.com; www.kingsman.com; 
www.argusmediagroup.com. 
1.3	
Energy balances
Biofuel production and consumption requires a positive net energy ratio (NER) to maintain environmental 
sustainability. It may be expressed as the energy from produced ethanol per energy used for its production, 
or (from Coombs, 1986):
 
                Energy in ethanol expressed as higher heating value  
NER =   
                    Energy content of all non-biological inputs 
Bioethanol produced from lignocellulosic biomass and other biowaste materials generally 
result in very favourable (i.e positive) NER values.
A similar useful parameter in this regard is the Net Energy Balance (NEB), which is the ratio of the ethanol 
energy produced to the total energy consumed (in biomass growth, processing and biofuel production). 
Table 1.3 summarises energy balances from the production of bioethanol from sugarcane, maize and 
lignocellulose, and it is apparent that of the first-generation biomass sources, sugar cane represents the 
most favourable feedstock with respect to energy balance.

Table 1.3 Energy balances for bioethanol production from different feedstocks
Energy balance values <1 mean that bioethanol production is unfeasible from energetic standpoint and 
is indicative of excess of fossil energy used to produce bioethanol. For maize (corn) ethanol processes in 
North America (USA), typical values are 1–2:1, whilst for sugarcane ethanol processes in South America 
(Brazil) typical values are 5–10:1. Figures are variable due to different geographic, climatic and agricultural 
reasons, but for Brazilian sugarcane ethanol operations, a typical energy balance of 8 (i.e. 8 times energy 
production in comparison to inputs) and GHG reductions of 90% (compared to only 30% for ethanol 
from corn) are achievable ((Amorim, Basso & Lopes, 2009; Basso and Rosa, 2010). Brazilian bioethanol 
plants that combust residual bagasse to steam for electricity generation have very favoiurable energy 
balances. Brazil is thus considered to be a sustainable biofuel producer (see: http://bioenergytrade.org/
downloads/sustainabilityofbrazilianbioethanol.pdf and http://english.unica.com.br/). 
Calculations of energy balances in bioethanol production depend on several factors, for example, 
whether or not fossil fuel usage in agronomic practices and co-generation of energy from by-products 
are included. Nevertheless, there is scope to reduce energy inputs from the bioprocessing (rather than 
biomass cultivation) perspective, particularly through adoption of modern biotechnology. Mousdale 
(2008) has discussed energy balances in bioethanol production – see 9. Further Reading.

Bioethanol

Introduction
There is unprecedented potential for bioethanol production mainly due to factors such as:
•	 Significant variation in world crude oil prices (but generally an upward trend)
•	 International security concerns in regions containing crude oil resources (Middle East, 
Russia, Central America and Nigeria)
•	 Desire to improve farm incomes (in both developed and developing nations) and generally 
boost rural economies
•	 Environmental concerns (Kyoto and Bali Agreements) and potential to mitigate climate 
change through greenhouse gas emission reductions
•	 Potential for energy access in underserved areas – urban poor, rural off-grid communities
•	 Potential to improve trade balances
A US Report (see http:/www.bio.org/EconomicImpactAdvancedBiofuels.pdf) has analyzed how growth 
of an advanced biofuel industry impacts on job creation, economic output, energy security and investment 
opportunities. For example, biofuels industry could create 29,000 new jobs and $5.5 billion in economic 
growth over the next three years and could ultimately create 800,000 new jobs by 2022 with a positive 
effect on output of $148.7 billion. It is estimated that in the US, the cumulative total of avoided petroleum 
imports over the period 2010–2022 would exceed $350 billion. To stimulate the further development 
of US bioethanol, regulators should approve the deployment of E15 (15% ethanol, 85% gasoline) and 
to extend the tax credit for all ethanol feedstocks. Both public and private investment will be needed to 
commercialise global advanced biofuels and in Europe, development of second generation biofuels will 
be supported by the European industrial BioEnergy Inititative (see http://www.biofuelstp.eu/eibi.html).
For the UK, climate change issues, together with agricultural diversification and security of fuel supply 
are the primary driving forces for bioethanol. Additionally, the UK government’s Renewable Transport 
Fuel Obligation (RTFO) has set challenging targets for biofuel production (see Chapter 2). 
One of the key challenges for the 21st century is to reduce dependence on finite supplies of oil, coal and 
gas, and move to renewable bioenergy sources. The main drivers for augmenting production of renewable 
transportation fuels like bioethanol are: maintenance of future fuel security; enhancement of the rural 
economy; and safeguarding the environment/reducing greenhouse gas emissions (see Chapter 8).
Crops grown specifically for biofuels, may provide part of the solution. Nevertheless, there are emerging 
concerns about environmental sustainability, biodiversity and the competition with food production 
(see Chapter 7).
Industry is increasingly turning to residual biomass as a source of biofuel, and there 
is interest to utilize biowastes which are currently not exploited. Second-generation 
bioethanol refers to alcohol produced from fermentation of non-food biomass sources, 
such as lignocellulosic hydrolysates, and this topic is covered further in Chapters 3 and 4.

Global production of bioethanol
Fig 2.2 summarises total global bioethanol production volumes and it is apparent that Brazil and the US 
are the dominant industrial players, accounting for 87% of global biofuel production (2008), driven by 
government support (see: ‘Global Biofuel Market Analysis’ http://www.marketresearch.com). 
Brazil was the first country to embrace large-scale bioethanol production, via their government’s Proalcool 
programme that was initiated in 1975 to exploit sugar cane fuel alcohol as a gasoline substitute in 
response to rising oil prices. Brazil is now the world’s second biggest producer with around 30 billion 
litres/annum (2008) from sugar cane and is the world’s biggest exporter of fuel ethanol. The number 
of sugarcane bioethanol plants in Brazil will increase over 400 in the next few years and production is 
expected to reach 37 billion litres/year (from 728million tons of sugar cane) by 2012–2013 (Amorim, 
Basso and Lopes, 2009; Basso and Rosa, 2010). 
Brazilian bioethanol
In Brazil, ethanol blends are mandatory (E20 to E25) and anhydrous ethanol (E100) is also 
available from thousands of filling stations. In addition, there are 6 million flex-fuel vehicles 
in Brazil and 3 million able to run on E100. Bioethanol now accounts for ~50% of the Brazilian 
transport fuel market, where gasoline may now be regarded as the “alternative” fuel.

Bioethanol

Global production of bioethanol
The USA is the world’s largest bioethanol producer (Fig 2.1). In late 2008, the production capacity of 
fuel alcohol from 180 US biorefineries was 13.6 billion US gallons (51.5 billion litres), with 31 billion 
litres in construction or expansion and set to commence production in 2009 (Ingeldew, Austin, Kelsall 
& Kluhspies, 2009). Fig 2.3 provides some bioethanol statistics from US production up to 2007 and this 
demonstrates the very rapid rise over recent years. For example, The Energy Information Administration 
(EIA) have shown that US bioethanol production increased 29% between 2009 and 2010 for the Jan/
May period (Biofuel and Industrial News Issue 39 – 19 Aug 2010 www.hgca.com).
The predominant bioethanol feedstock in the US is maize (corn). If the annual corn crop (currently 
~12 billion bushels) was all (i.e. starch and cellulose) processed to ethanol the total biofuel obtainable 
would be ~120 billion litres (at 7 gallons/bushel). The US Department of Energy Roadmap requires 40 
billion gallons (~150 billion litres) of bioethanol by 2030. However, total replacement of liquid fossil 
fuels would require 200 billion gallons of biofuels (Abbas, 2010). 
Although corn is the predominant bioethanol crop in North America, the US 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has designated that sugar cane ethanol is 
an “Advanced Renewable Fuel” and it is anticipated that by 2022 around 15billion 
gallons (~57billion litres) of American bioethanol will be sugar cane-derived.

Fig 2.3 US Fuel Ethanol Production to 2007 
(6 Billion Gallons = 22.71 Billion liters. From Abbas, 2010)
Table 2.1 summarises some international bioethanol production developments. Worldwide bioethanol 
production has been predicted to increase at 5% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) from 
2009–2018, with significant growth potential for biofuels in India and China. This prediction is reinforced 
by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, see: http://www.oecd.org) 
and UN FAO food agency, which forecast that global bioethanol production would double between 
2007–2017 reaching 125 billion litres. 
Further information on global bioethanol industrial developments can be obtained from 
various websites and e-newsletters (eg. Biofuel & Industrial News from www.hcga.com;

Bioethanol developments
China
China is already the world’s third largest producer of ethanol (90% from corn) and has ambitious 
future growth targets for bioethanol from second generation waste biomass. Current Chinese 
targets for bioethanol (10million tons by 2020) are considered conservative (Yan et al ,2010). Current 
bioethanol plants in china employ corn, wheat and cassava, but sweet sorghum and sugar cane have 
future potential. Regarding second generation feedstocks, COFCO (China National Cereals, Oils and 
Foodstuffs Corporation) is investing 50 million Yuan (U.S.$6.5 million) to build a cellulosic ethanol 
pilot plant in Zhaodong, in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, with an annual capacity of 
5,000 tonnes. Another cellulosic ethanol pilot plant with a production capacity of 10,000 tonnes is 
being planned in the Yucheng area of Shandong (see: http://www.biofuels.apec.org).
India
India accounts for around 4% of global bioethanol production (2m kilo litres in 2006) from sugar 
cane and has plans to expand its production, especially using cellulosic substrates (for example, 
see http://www.praj.net and http://www.rellife.com/biofuels.html). In February 2009, India and the 
US exchanged a memorandum for cooperation on biofuels development, covering the production, 
utilization, distribution and marketing of biofuels in India  
(see: http://www.indiaembassy.org/newsite/press_release/2009/Feb/1.asp)
Russia
In Russia, information on bioethanol production is provided by the Russian National Biofuels 
Association (see: http://www.biofuels.ru).
Nigeria
In Nigeria, a recent analysis of sugarcane and sweet sorghum as bioethanol feedstocks has concluded 
that the latter crop is better suited in terms of its adaptability to harsh climatic and cultivation 
conditions (Nasidi et al, 2010).
Australia
Information about bioethanol production in Australia is available from the Biofuels Association of 
Australia (see: http://www.biofuelsassociation.com.au). 
Colombia
In Colombia, sugar cane, rather than maize, has been identified as the most promising feedstock to 
boost their domestic bioethanol production based on environmental and economical considerations 
(Quintero et al, 2008).
Japan/Asia 
Pacific
Regarding Japan and Asia Pacific, in comparison to Brazil, the US and Europe bioethanol 
production industry in these countries is in its infancy (see: http://www.biofuels.apec.org; 
http://www.biofuels.apec.org/me_japan.html; ISSAAS, 2007). In fact, Japan is the second-largest 
importer of ethanol (to meets its E10 mandates) as it lacks the conditions for large scale bioethanol 
production. [Walter et al 2008]
Table 2.1 Selected international bioethanol production
In Europe, bioethanol production is a steep increase (see Fig 2.4) and the main producers of bioethanol 
are France, Germany and Spain (Fig 2.5) using predominant feedstocks of cereals (mainly wheat) and 
sugarbeet. Figures from eBIO, the EU ethanol industry body, show EU fuel ethanol production increased 
from 2.8 bn litres in 2008 to 3.7bn litres in 2009, a rise of 31%. France (1.25bn litres) and Germany 
(750M litres) were the largest producers with Spain third (465M litres), seeing increases in annual 
production of 25%, 32% and 46% respectively. EU bioethanol 2010 plant capacity was 7.7bn litres in 
2010, and projections (F.O.Licht, 2007) for 2011 show an increase to 8.3bn litres as new plants come on 
line, particularly in Spain and Germany.

 Fig 2.5 Main European fuel ethanol producers (2010) in million litres 
(Information from: Biofuel & Industrial News, Aug 19, 2010 www.hgca.com)
The UK saw a small decline in bioethanol production from 75M litres in 2008 to 70M litres in 2009, 
although much higher figures are expected for 2010 as a major bioethanol plants (see Table 2.2 ) come 
on stream. Most UK domestic demand for bioethanol currently depends on imports but these will lessen 
as the UK bioethanol industry sector matures. A recent (August 2010) report from the UK Renewable 
Fuel Agency (RFA) indicated that in the first month of the 2010/11 Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation 
(RTFO) period, 141 million litres of biofuel were supplied (representing only ~1.6% of total road 
transport fuel, against a UK annual target of 3.5%). More biodiesel (65%) was supplied than bioethanol 
(35%). The most widely reported source of bioethanol used in UK transport fuels was sugarcane from 
Brazil (39% of bioethanol supplied). Future UK capacity is predicted to grow rapidly from 70M litres 
in 2009 to 470M litres in 2010 and 890M litres in 2011. (Further information from F.O.Licht (2007);

Table 2.2 Some UK industrial bioethanol developments
The first tanker of UK bioethanol (sold to Shell) left the Ensus wheat-bioethanol plant at Wilton in 
Teesside, England in March, 2010. The Renewable Energy Association (REA) have reported (2009) 
that the UK has potential to deliver up to 80% of the biofuels needed to fulfil European obligations in 
a sustainable way without increasing overall land used for arable crops. The EU’s Renewable Energy 
Directive (for which the UK is a signatory) states that 10% of road transport fuels must come from 
renewable sources by 2020, and the UK intends to “increase biofuels steadily from 2010 up to the level 
required in 2020” (RAE). [biofuelsnow.co.uk 22/10/09].

National and international directives 
Various national governmental obligations and international directives on biofuel usage are acting as 
stimuli for the bioethanol industrial sector.

Bioethanol
27 
Global production of bioethanol
In the US, The American Energy Policy Act of 2005 created a Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) that 
required refiners to “use an increasing percentage of renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel in their 
fuel mix, as well as creating new incentives for ethanol production from sugar, cellulose and other non-
traditional feedstocks”. Subsequently, in 2009 the USA consumed around 42 bn litres (11.1 billion gallons) 
of ethanol, and that amount is expected to rise significantly in future years due to US federal mandates. 
The Renewable Fuel Standard was expanded when the US Congress passed the Energy Independence 
and Security Act of 2007, requiring the use of 9 billion gallons of renewable fuel in 2008, growing to 
more than 15 billion gallons in 2012 and 36 billion gallons (136.2 billion litres) by 2022. Importantly, a 
ceiling of 15 billion gallons (56.8 billion litres) has been set for the amount that can be produced from 
corn starch (see US EIA, 2008). Additional targets have been set for 80 billion litres of biofuels from 
other conventional feedstocks (such as sugar cane) as well as non-conventional cellulosic feedstocks.
In Brazil, bioethanol is now the preferred road (and potentially avaiation) transportation fuel. Bioethanol 
production is also accelerating in other South American countries and information is available covering 
statistics, production, sustainability, feedstocks, governmental policy and other information for bioethanol 
in Latin America (see http://www.top-biofuel.org).

Bioethanol
28 
Global production of bioethanol
In Europe, volumetric output of ethanol is increasing year-by-year, primarily in response to 
governmental obligations (eg. the UK’s Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation, RTFO see http://www.
renewablefuelsagency.gov.uk) and European Commission directives. A European Directive (#2003/30/
EG) from May, 2003 imposed on European Union member states an objective to have 5.75% biofuel 
substitution of fossil fuels by the end of 2010. On February 4, 2009, a European Parliament resolution 
entitled: “2050: The future begins today – Recommendations for the EU’s future integrated policy on climate 
change” (2008/2105(INI)) – established a range of measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 
25–40% by 2020 and a reduction of at least 80% by 2050. The report advocates that the EU Members 
States should invest in research on advanced biofuels, among other technologies.
In July 2008, the European Parliament’s Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety 
recommended (July 2008) that biofuel targets for the year 2020 to be 8% of fossil fuel useage. The previous 
target, outlined in the European Commission’s January 2007 “Renewable Energy Roadmap” was 10%. 
Current EU policy on biofuels must be viewed in a global perspective, with growing competition for 
productive land alongside an increasing need for renewable transportation fuels. 
In the UK, the RTFO applies to road transport across the whole of the UK and “requires suppliers of fossil 
fuels to ensure that a specified percentage of the road fuels they supply in the UK is made up of renewable 
fuels. The target for 2009/10 is 3.25% by volume.” (Renewables Fuel Agency). Following The Gallacher 
Review (2008), in April 2009, The RTFO Amendment Order (2009) amended the targets as follows: “the 
level of the renewable transport fuel obligation by slowing the rate of increase (from 2.5% to 5% of total fuel 
supplied) in the amount of renewable transport fuel for which evidence of supply in the United Kingdom”. 
The Gallagher Review has stated that the EU’s biofuels target for 2010 of 10% by energy 
“is unlikely to be met sustainably and the introduction of biofuels should therefore be slowed 
while we improve our understanding of indirect land-use change and effective systems are 
implemented to manage risks”. The Renewable Fuels Agency has therefore proposed that (UK) 
targets higher that 5% should only be implemented beyond 2013/14 if biofuels are shown 
“to be demonstrably sustainable (including avoiding indirect indirect land-use change)”.
Proposed rates of increase in UK biofuel-fossil fuel blends will rise to a maximum of 5% by 2013/14. 
(see Table 2.2). There will be a further review of UK biofuel targets in 2011/12 to coincide with the EU’s 
review of member states’ progress on biofuel targets. Those obligated by the RTFO include refiners, 
importers and any others who supply >450,000 litres/year of relevant hydrocarbon oil for UK road 
transport. Biofuels pertinent to the RTFO include bioethanol, biodiesel, pure plant oil, biogas (methane), 
biobutanol, bio-ETBE and HVO (hydrogenated vegetable oil, also referred to as renewable diesel).

Current and emerging status
Shortly after September 11, 2001 then President George Bush announced that the US would break its 
“addiction to oil”, meaning that American national security was now linked to energy security. By 2009, 
increasing concerns about climate change provided additional momentum to develop sustainable and 
secure alternatives to oil (see: http://domesticfuel.com/2009/12/31/the-ethanol-decade/). 
According to the Renewable Fuels Association (see http://ethanolrfa.org), biofuels came of age in the 
2000s. This is exemplified by bioethanol production increments year-on-year – for example: the US 
produced 5.3 billion litres (1.4 bn gal) of bioethanol in 1999 in 54 plants, rising to over 40 bn litres (10.6 
bn gal) in 2009 in more than 200 plants and predicted to reach 136 bn litres by 2022. Today, bioethanol 
is blended in more that 80% of US motor fuels. Importantly, the US bioethanol industry supports nearly 
500,000 jobs and in 2008 generated an estimated $12 billion in federal tax revenues and $9 billion in 
state and local revenues. In addition, American oil imports from OPEC have been reduced by more 
than 300 million barrels a year.
Nevertheless, in the US, there is a need to break through the 10% blend wall and eventually move on 
to blends of 12%, 13%, 15% and beyond, while expanding the vehicle fleet and infrastructure for E85.
In the EU, a European Biofuels Technology Platform (see: http://biofuelstp.eu) has been established to 
contribute to: 
•	 the development of cost-competitive world-class biofuels value chains,
•	 to the creation of a healthy biofuels industry, and
•	 to accelerate the sustainable deployment of biofuels in the EU through a process of 
guidance, prioritisation and promotion of research, technology development and 
demonstration.
International trade in ethanol is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade, mainly with exports 
from Brazil to the US and the EU.

Global production of bioethanol
Opportunities exist for exploiting second-generation (non-food) bioethanol substrates based on 
lignocellulosic biowastes generated from agriculture, industry and forestry activities but these approaches 
are fraught with key scientific and technological constraints (see sections 3.2 and 4.5). Current and 
emerging trends in bioethanol production from lignocellulosic materials in various countries (Korea, 
China, Canada, Brazil, India, Malaysia and Europe) have been discussed in a recent Special Issue of 
Bioreource Technology on lignocellulosic bioethanol edited by Pandey (2010).
Bio-based transportation fuels offer many developing countries new economic 
opportunities, and will lessen their dependence on energy imports. Importantly, however, 
biofuel production must be sustainable and must not threaten biodiversity or directly 
compete with food production. Future biofuel policies should set clear sustainability criteria 
and promote development of second-generation bioethanol.
Further issues regarding future trends in global bioethanol production, and the scientific and technological 
challenges still to be overcome, are discussed in Chapter 8.

Bioethanol feedstocks
3	 Bioethanol feedstocks
3.1	
First generation feedstocks (starch and sugar-based)
In general, bioethanol can be extracted from every sort of carbohydrate material that has the typical formula 
of (CH2O)N . These can be divided in three main groups: sugary, starchy and lignocellulosic biomass.
First-generation feedstocks for bioethanol production primarily refer to plant biomass (or phytomass) 
sources that are also sources of human and animal nutrition, namely: cereal starches and sugar crops. 
Table 3.11 summarises both first and second generation resources for bioethanol and Fig 3.11 summarises 
first generation crops for bioethanol. Further information is available from Pasha and Rao (2009) and 
Monceaux (2009).

Sucrose-based materials are predominantly derived from sugar cane (Saccharum sp.) and sugar beet 
(Beta vulgaris L.), whilst starch-based materials are predominantly derived from cereal crops such 
as maize, wheat and other cereals. Simple-sugar based feedstocks for bioethanol production include 
sugar cane, sugar beet and sweet sorghum and these crops represent a readily fermentable sugar source 
(comprising mainly sucrose, fructose and glucose) whilst cereal starches require pre-hydrolysis to obtain 
sugars that can be fermented by yeast. Thus, fermentation can be carried out without accomplishment 
of prior hydrolysis or other pre-treatments because the sugar is available in disaccharides (containing 
one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose) which can be metabolised directly by enzymes 
present in yeast. For this reason, the conversion of sucrose-containing feedstocks is the easiest and most 
efficient compared with other feedstocks and the costs of the process are relatively low compared to the 
commodity price. 
Another simple-sugar containing material is whey, a by-product of cheesemaking. Whey comprises 
around 5% w/v lactose which is a disaccharide of glucose and galactose. S. cerevisiae cannot directly 
ferment lactose (due to a lack of β-galactosidase and other lactose-utilising enzymes) unless lactose is 
hydrolysed to its component monosacchrides or the yeast is genetically modified. Some natural lactose-
fermenting yeasts do exist, notably Kluyveromyces marxianus, but to date they have only been employed 
on a large scale for potable ethanol fermentations (eg. in Ireland, New Zealand and USA (California 
and Minnesota).

Table 3.12 shows the main macromolecular constituents of major starchy crops. The main crop for 
bioethanol production in North America is Zea mays (maize, or corn), whilst in Europe it is wheat. Most 
US (>80%) corn is cultivated in the mid-west states (mainly Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and 
Indiana – see NCGA, 2010). Such crops are high in starch which is described as an alpha-polysaccahride 
comprising D-glucose monomers existing in two forms: amylase and amylopectin (see Fig 3.43).

Bioethanol
35 
Bioethanol feedstocks
Bioethanol production from cereal grains comprises the following main stages: milling, starch hydrolysis, 
yeast fermentation, distillation (to ~95% ethanol) and water removal from ethanol (to 99.9% or absolute 
ethanol). It is possible to produce 1L anhydrous ethanol from ~3kg wheat. Table 3.13 compares the 
potential ethanol yields from typical starch and sugar crops, wheat and sugarbeet, respectively. It is 
apparent in this case that wheat yields a greater level of ethanol when compared to sugar beet on a weight 
basis, but that on an acerage basis, sugar beet is more productive.

Table 3.13 Key parameters for bioethanol production from starch and sugar
Other main starchy crops include Hordeum vulgare (barley), Sorghum bicolor, Triticale (a hybrid of wheat 
(Triticum) and rye (Secale) first bred in Scottish and Swedish laboratories during the late 19th century) 
and Cassava. “Sugarcorn”, a hybrid cross between sugar cane and maize is under development by a US 
company, Targeted Growth Inc (www.ethanolproducer.com, January 2009). 
Inulin-rich root crops such as Jerusalem artichoke have also been considered as potential bioethanol 
feedstocks as they can be grown in nutrient-poor soils. Inulin is a polyfructan (polymer of β-2,1 linked 
fructose monomers) that can be hydroysed by inulinases to fermentable fructose, or directly fermented 
by certain yeasts (eg. Kluyveromyces marxianus).
3.2	
Second generation feedstocks (cellulose-based)
The use of first generation feedstocks to meet growing demands for future biofuel production is ultimately 
unsustainable and there are severe limitations to starch and sugar-based ethanol production. For example, 
if the US was to replace all gasoline with 10% ethanol, around 46% of the current maize crop would be 
required and this is obviously untenable. Non-food, or second generation, feedstocks for bioethanol are 
therefore the future due to abundance, ethical considerations and favourable economics.

Bioethanol feedstocks
Second generation raw materials for bioethanol production typically refer to non-food biomass sources, 
mainly lignocellulosic biomass. This represents the most abundant form of carbon on Earth (estimated 
annual production at 1010 MT, Sanchez and Cardona, 2008), and encompasses 2 main categories of 
feedstocks:
1.	 Waste materials (straws, corn residues (stover, fibres and cobs), woody wastes/chippings, 
forestry residues, old paper/cardboard, bagasse, spent grains, municipal solid waste (MSW), 
agricultural residues (oilseed pulp, sugar beet pulp).
2.	 Energy crops such as SRC (short rotation coppice, eg. basket willow Salix viminalis) and 
energy grasses Miscanthus gigantum, switchgrass (Panicum vigratum), reed canary grass 
(Phalaris arundinaceae), giant reed (Arundo donax), ryegrass, etc) growing on inferior 
agricultural land and contaminated industrial land.
Table 3.21 summarises some key parameters for major lignocellulosic feedstocks for bioethanol 
production.

Residues from maize (corn) processing include corn stover which comprises the maize stalk and leaves. 
For every kg of maize cropped, almost the same amount of stover is left in the field. This can be utilised 
in agricultural practices to prevent soil erosion, but simultaneous saccharification and fermentation 
(SSF) processes (see Chapter 4) can be used to produce bioethanol from stover. However, the amount of 
non-utilisable lignin in stover is high and varies between 17–26% dry wt. Other problems in converting 
cellulosic biomass to ethanol include: collection, pretreatment and conversion.
Energy crops 
These are fast growing plants that can be exploited for bioethanol production and which are not 
utilised as food sources. Examples include:
•	
Switchgrass (Pancium virgatum) is a perennial C4 plant grown in USA currently as fodder crop or for 
soil conservation but can be de-lignified for bioethanol production.
•	
Reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L) is a perennial grass that grows widely. Its stem 
components (dry wt) comprise: hexoses (38–45%); pentoses (22–25%); lignin (18–21%)
•	
Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L) comprises mainly cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, pectin and protein.
•	
Miscanthus x giganteus (hybrid of M. sinensis and M. sacchariflorus) is a perennial grass with a low 
need for fertilzers and pesticides with a broad temperature growth range. Previously used as an 
ornamental landscaping, but now an attractive biomass source for biofuels For example, potential 
ethanol from miscanthus is around twice that from corn on an acreage basis 
(From Arshadi & Sellstedt, 2008; Long, 2006; Grooms, 2008; Pilgrim, 2009; Pyter et al, 2009)
Lignocellulose: cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin
Woody biomass comprises major components of cellulose, hemicellulose (that can both be hydrolysed 
to fermentable sugars) and lignin (that cannot be converted to fermentable sugars). Fig 3.21 provides 
the basic structure of these components and Table 3.22 summarises lignocellulose composition from 
major biomass sources. In the context of bioethanol production, “biomass” refers to phytomass (trees, 
plants) that has a mole ratio formula of the main elements: CH1.4O0.6, whilst the chemical impirical 
formulae of biomass main constituents are: Cellulose C6H10O5; Hemicellulose C5H8O4; Lignin C6H11O2.

Cellulose is described as a beta-polysaccharide of glucose (in β-(1,4)-linkages) with an average molecular 
mass of ~100,000Da and hemicellulose a complex (highly branched) polymer with an average molecular 
mass of 30,000Da consisting of xylose and arabinose (pentose sugars) and glucose, mannose and galactose 
(hexose sugars). In softwoods, the hemicellulose sugar backbone is mannose with glucose and galactose 
side-chains; whilst in hardwoods and grasses, the backbone is xylan with side chains of arabinose and 
glucuronic acid. In hardwood species (eg. Salix) some of the xylose units are acetylated (OH groups 
replaced by O-acetyl groups) and during pre-treatment (see 3.4) this can give rise to high levels of acetic 
acid that can inhibit subsequent yeast fermentations.

Bioethanol

Bioethanol feedstocks
Lignin (see Fig 3.21) is the secondary plant cell wall material which is a very tough, recalcitrant material 
comprising a 3-D network of di- and mono-methoxylated, and non-methoxylated phenylpropanoid units 
(derived from the corresponding p-hydroxycinamyl alcohols). Following acid hydrolysis of lignocellulosic 
biomass, acid-insoluble lignin remains, but a portion of it (i.e. acid-soluble lignin) may be released into 
the hydrolysis liquor. For bioethanol production processes, some adverse impacts of acid-soluble lignin 
components include cellulase inhibition and fermentation inhibition (due to formation of pre-treatment 
derived phenolic degradation products – see Chapter 4).
In addition to the principal components of lignocellulose (i.e. cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) 
of various biomass sources provided in Table 3.22, other minor components such as ash (inorganic 
minerals), pectins (highly-branched polysaccharides of galacturonic acid and its methyl esters), acids 
and extractives (extracellular, non-cell wall material) will be present.

Other cellulosic raw materials/feed stocks include food wastes and food/beverage processing residues 
(Kim and Dale, 2004). For example, spent grains (SG), the residue remaining after extraction of wort, 
are a major by-product of brewing and distilling, and provide lignocelluose-rich biomass as a potential 
source of sugars for fuel ethanol fermentations. White et al (2008) have shown that dilute acid and 
enzyme treatments can convert the hemicellulose and cellulose fractions to glucose, xylose and arabinose. 
Fermentation of this hydrolysate by non-Saccharomyces yeasts such as Pichia stipitis and Kluyveromyces 
marxianus results in favourable ethanol conversion yields (g ethanol/g substrate). 
Biotechnology and chemical technology research holds the key to enhancement of future 
developments in sustainable bioethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass.
3.3	
Bioethanol feedstocks with future potential 
Marine macroalgae (seaweeds) demand minimal use of agriculture areas and fresh water for cultivation, 
and represent an interesting biomass resource for bioethanol (Horn et al, 2000a; 2000b). Their attraction as 
biomass sources for biofuels stems from the fact that seaweeds have growth rates and primary production 
rates far in excess than those of terrestrial plants. As low-input, high-yielding biomass, seaweeds 
may represent an example of third generation feedstocks for bioethanol production. Brown seaweeds 
(Phaeophyta) in particular contain storage polysaccharides which are substrates for microbial degradation. 
They contain high amounts of carbohydrates such as alginic acid (structural) and laminaran and mannitol 
(storage) that can potentially be fermented to ethanol. Alginate typically makes up 30–40% of the dry 
weight in giant brown seaweeds (kelp). Laminarin is a linear polysaccharide of 1,3–β-D-glucopyanose 
and can relatively easily be hydrolysed to fermentable glucose. Unlike lignocellulosic biomass, they 
have low levels of lignin and cellulose making them more amenable for bioconversion to energy fuels 
than terrestrial plants. Fermentations of hydroysates derived from the fast-growing Macrocystis spp and 
Laminaria spp.hold the greatest potential for marine macroalgal bioethanol (eg. see www.ba-lab.com).

Bioethanol

Bioethanol feedstocks
Another substance present in great quantities in the sea is chitin which is a polysaccharide consisting 
of N-acetyl glucosamine monomers. Chitin is a very hard, semi-transparent substance found naturally 
in the exoskeletons of crabs, lobsters and shrimps. Its structure resembles that of cellulose except one 
hydroxyl group is replaced by an acetyl amine group. It has been described as “cellulose of the sea”and 
has potential for bioconversion into chemical commodities, including ethanol. 
Limited production of bioethanol is also possible by processing “waste” alcoholic beverages such as 
beer (eg. Merrick & Co., Colorado, USA – www.ethanolproducer.com June 6, 2008). Waste baked foods 
(eg. bread) also have potential for bioconversion to fuel alcohol (eg. Finnish company St1 Biofuels, 
www.st1.eu).
A major co-product of biodiesel production is glycerol, which has the potential to be converted to ethanol 
by certain bacteria (see Dharmadi et al, 2006) and yeasts such as. Candida magnoliae, Zygosaccharomyces 
rouxii and Pachysolen tannophilus (see www.glyfinery.net). 
Municipal Solid Waste
Other forms of potentially fermentable waste materials include municipal solid waste (MSW) 
which is collected for disposal by urban communites in developed countries. MSW represents 
one of the lowest cost feedstock sources for cellulosic bioethanol production. It comprises: paper/
cardboard, kitchen and vegetation organic waste and possesses a higher heating value of 12.7 
MJ/dry kg. There are therefore opportunities for combined disposal and energy recovery from 
MSW. It has been reported (Shi et al, 2009) that >80 billion litres of MSW paper-derived cellulosic 
ethanol can be produced worldwide. This would result in replacing over 5% of global gasoline 
consumption. 
Several pilot facilities are developing new routes to bioethanol from both commercial waste and 
biodegradeable municipal solid waste (BMSW) (see: www.biofuelstp.eu/bioethanol; www.biofuelstp.eu/
spm2/pdfs/poster_PERSEO.pdf; Li and Khraisheh, 2009) and a Canadian company (GreenField Ethanol 
Inc., Edmonton, Alberta) is developing one of the first MSW-to-ethanol facilities. [Ethanol Producer 
Magazine, 1/7/08].

Sugar cane contains ~15% sucrose and once this is pressed from the canes following chopping and 
shredding is readily fermented by Saccharomyces yeasts. The juice can be processed either into crystalline 
sugar or directly fermented to ethanol, as per many industrial plants in Brazil (see Fig 3.41).

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Bioethanol
44 
Bioethanol feedstocks
For sugar production, the juice is clarified with lime and evaporated to form crystals that are centrifuged, 
leaving a syrupy brown liquid by-product known as molasses. Molasses represents an almost complete 
fermentation medium as it comprises sugars (sucrose, glucose, fructose), minerals, vitamins, fatty 
acids, organic acids etc. (see Table 3.41). Additional nitrogen in the form of di-ammonium phosphate 
and is commonly added. The more sucrose from sugarcane stalks that is removed for crystalline sugar 
production, the poorer the quality of molasses and some molasses contains excess levels of salts and 
inhibitors produced during heat treatments (furfurals, formic acid and browning reaction products). 
For bioethanol fermentations, molasses is diluted to 20–25% total sugar (measured in oBrix) treated with 
sulphuric acid and heated to 90°C for impurity removal prior to cooling, centrifugation, pH adjustment 
and addition of yeast. 
Sugar cane juice can either be directly fermented, clarified following heat (105°C) treatment, or mixed with 
molasses in different proportions. Constituents in molasses that are important for bioethanol production 
include: sugar content: sugar % (w/w) and degrees Brix (oBrix), colour, total solids, specific gravity, crude 
protein, free amino nitrogen, total fat, fibre, minerals, vitamins and substances toxic to yeast.
The yeast S. cerevisiae is the predominant microorganism employed in industrial molasses fermentations, 
but another yeast, Kluyveromyces marxianus and a bacterium, Zymomonas mobilis, have potential in this 
regard (see Senthilkumar and Gunasekaran, 2008).

Cereal crop processing
For processing of starch-based materials, cereal cooking, starch liquefaction and amylolysis are the main 
stages prior to fermentation. In North America, 2 major maize processes are differentiated: dry and wet 
milling (see Fig 3.42). In wet milling, maize kernels are soaked in water (or dilute acid) to separate the 
cereal into starch, gluten, protein, oil and fibre prior to starch conversion to ethanol. In dry milling, from 
which most US bioethanol is made, maize kernels are finely ground and processed without fractionation 
into component parts. Recent developments in both dry and wet milling have been discussed by O’Brien 
and Woolverton (2009).
Starch-bioethanol (from US maize) currently dominates global fuel alcohol production, but the projected 
use of maize for ethanol production is expected to level-off (at around 6 billion bushels) unless “idle”land 
can be used to grow more cereal for production of biofuels (Abbas, 2010).

Fig 3.42 Dry and wet milling corn processes for bioethanol 
(From Abbas, 2010 reproduced with permission)
The principal stages in dry mill bioethanol processes encompass:
1.	 Milling (maize kernels ground to a fine powder or meal
2.	 Liquefaction (water is added to the maize meal and temperature increased in the mash to 
solubilize starch)
3.	 Saccharification (enyzymatic hydrolysis of starch liberates simple sugars, mainly glucose)
4.	 Fermentation (starch hydrolysate is fermented by yeast to ethanol, CO2 and secondary 
metabolites)

5.	 Distillation (the fermented wash, or beer, at around 10%v/v ethanol is distilled to ~96% v/v 
ethanol with the solid residues processed into animal feed)
6.	 Dehydration (water remaining in the ethanolic distillate is removed by molecular sieves to 
produce anhydrous ethanol)
Starch hydrolysis
In order for starch to be converted to ethanol by yeast (S. cerevisiae) it has to be de-polymerised 
to constituent saccharides such as glucose and maltose. In traditional beverage fermentation 
industries such as brewing, this is partially accomplished using endogenous enzymes, mainly 
α- and β-amylases, present in malted barley. However, for bioethanol production, more complete 
starch hydrolysis is required (see Fig 3.44) and this is conducted using exogenous (microbially-
derived) amylolytic enzymes including de-branching enzymes such as amyloglucosidase (or 
glucoamylase).
Starch is an alpha-polysaccahride comprising D-glucose monomers arranged in two basic formats: 
amylose and amylopectin (see Fig 3.43) and plant starches generally contain 10 to 25% amylose and 75 
to 90% amylopectin (depending on the biomass source).
Industrial enzymes used as processing aids in starch-to-ethanol bioconversions (see Table 3.42) are 
produced by microorganisms (bacteria such as Bacillus spp. and fungi such as Aspergillus spp.) grown in 
closed fermentation tanks by specialist companies (eg. Novozymes, Genecor). The industrial production 
and purification of amylolytic enzymes for bioethanol production have been discussed by Nair et al, 2008).

3.4.2	
Lignocellulose processing
3.4.2.1 Lignocellulose pretreatments 
For lignocellulose-based material processing for bioethanol production, more complex and demanding 
technology is required due to the tough, recalcitrant nature of the material compared with sugar and 
starch based biomass. Cellulose crystallinity, and its sheathing by hemicellulose, together with the lignin 
“sealant” all contribute to the recalcitrance of ligncellulosic material. After all Nature designed this 
material for a purpose! 
The following represent the principal stages in lignocellulose-to-ethanol processes:
1.	 Pre-processing by mechanical removal of dirt, debris and shredding (eg. stover, straw, 
grasses) into smaller particles (Sokhansanj and Hess, 2009)
2.	 Pre-treatment (see Table 3.43, and note that a single pre-treatment method does not exist 
for all biomass forms)
3.	 Solid-liquid separation (hemicellulose sugars are separated from solid fibrous material 
comprising cellulose and lignin)
4.	 Cellulose hydrolysis (cellulase attack on crystalline cellulose to liberate glucose)
5.	 Fermentation (ideally of all C5 pentoses and C6 hexoses to ethanol)

6.	 Distillation (the fermented wash, or beer, is distilled to ~96% v/v ethanol with the solid 
residues comprising lignin and dead yeast combusted for energy or converted to co-
products for animal feed or agronomical use)
7.	 Dehydration (water remaining in the ethanolic distillate is removed by molecular sieves to 
produce anhydrous ethanol)
Fig 3.45 outlines the basic features of lignocellulosic pre-treatment processes. Detailed consideration of 
pre-treatment technologies has been provided by Pandey (2010), Laxman and Lachke (2009), Alvira et 
al (2009) and Mosier et al (2005).

Fig 3.45 Basic features of lignocellulose pre-treatments
The following criteria are characteristic of an effective pre-treatment method: 
•	 preservation of pentose sugars from the hemicellulosic fraction,
•	 limitation of lignin degradation products,
•	 minimisation of energy input and 
•	 employment of low cost materials and methods. 
Pre-treatments employed can be divided into physical, chemical and biological methods (see Table 3.43), 
but there is a strong inter-dependence of these processes. There is not a perfect pre-treatment method 
employed and remaining bottlenecks include generation of inhibitory chemicals (acids, furans, phenols), 
high particle load, high energy input and efficient separation of soluble sugars from solid residues. 
Specific pre-treatment conditions are required for individual feedstocks and mechanistic models can 
help in the rational design of such processes (Zhang et al, 2009). It is especially important to optimise 
lignocellulose pre-treatment methods because they are one of the most expensive steps in the overall 
conversion to bioethanol. For example, Mosier et al (2005) reported that pre-treatment accounts for ~30 
UScents/gallon of cellulosic ethanol produced.

Fundamentally, pre-treatment methods should render cellulose more amenable to enzymolysis by 
disrupting its crystalline structure and in order to do this, the lignin “seal” needs to be broken.
Pre-treatment methods
 Examples
Physical
Milling (mechanical comminution), microwave irradiation, ultrasound, thermal 
processes (pyrolysis, steam explosion), thermochemical processes (weak acid, 
high temperature), extrusion 
Chemical
Alkali-pretreatment, ammonia fibre expansion (AFEX) technologies, organosolv 
(ACOS), liming, sulphur dioxide, wet oxidation, CO2 explosion, SO2 explosion, 
ozonolysis, H2O2 delignification, supercritical fluid and ionic liquid pre-treatments.
Biological
Microbial (eg. white-rot fungi such as Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trametes 
versicolor) and enzymatic (eg. peroxidase and laccase) pretreatments 
(de-lignification).
Table 3.43 Lignocellulose pre-treatment and fractionation technologies 
(Further information from Moesier et al, 2005 and Alvira et al, 2009)
By cominuting the material by physical pre-treatment the surface is enlarged proportionately to its volume 
and makes it more accessible for enzymes or chemicals which hydrolyze the substrate. However, this 
process is energy-intensive and expensive and may not always be feasible (Alvira et al, 2009).
Pyrolysis involves treating lignocellulosic materials to >300°C to produce gaseous product and residual 
char. 
Ultrasound (eg. 36 KHz frequency) can be employed to pretreat wastepaper to enhance subsequent 
cellulolytic ability of enzymes (Ingram and Wood, 2001).
Steam explosion (or hydro-thermolysis, or autohydrolysis) is commonly employed and this involves 
treatment of biomass with high pressure steam (160–260°C, 0.69–4.83 MPa pressure) followed by rapid 
decompression to degrade hemicellulose and transform lignin, increasing cellulose hydrolysis potential. 
Liquid hot water (LHW) treatments and wet oxidation (hot water plus oxygen) also involve high 
temperatures (eg. 200°C), but lower energy input technologies such as AFEX (ammonia fibre/freeze 
explosion involving impregnation with high-pressure ammonia followed by decompression – see Balan 
et al, 2009), ARP (ammonia recycling percolation – see Kim et al, 2009) and ACOS (acid catalyzed 
organosolv saccharification (cooking in aqueous alcohols, with an acid catalyst –see http://acos-biomass-
refining.com/) processes are attractive.
Lime pre-treatments using calcium hydroxide with high temperature and pressure (see Mosier et al, 
2005) selectively reduce lignin contents of biomass without affecting carbohydrate content.

Combined physico-chemical approaches include the use of concentrated hydrochloric acid (CHAP) or 
dilute sulphuric acid at 200°C. 
Ionic liquids (eg. n-butyl-methy-lilidazolium chloride) which are stable liquid salts up to 300°C can 
solubilise cellulose within a few hours.
Other pre-treatment methods include ozonization which has been used effectively to improve enzymolysis 
of straws (ozone, a powerful oxidant, degrades lignin and slightly solubilises hemicellulose – see Garcia-
Cubero et al (2009). 
3.4.2.2 Lignocellulose hydrolysis and saccharification
To render lignocellulose amenable to fermentation, pretreated lignocellulose requires hydrolysis and 
saccharification to liberate fermentable sugars. 
To maximise sugar release, pretreated lignocellulosic material the hemicellulose fraction is subjected 
to mild acid hydrolysis followed by cellulolysis with enzymes. The following is an example of dilute 
sulphuric acid hydrolysis (for softwoods):
1.	 0.7% H2SO4 at 190°C for 3minutes (to recover pentose sugars)
2.	 0.4% H2SO4 at 215°C for 3minutes (for more acid-resistant cellulose)

More concentrated acid treatments (eg. 30–70% H2SO4) can be employed at lower temperatures (40°C), 
but they are more time-consuming (2–6 hours). Different approaches for acid hydrolysing lignocellulose 
have been discussed by Mousdale (2008) and Anish and Rao (2008). Acid hydrolysis of lignocellulose 
has a major disadvantage in that chemicals inhibitory to yeast in the subsequent fermentation stages are 
produced following degradation of sugars (see 4.6). For example, hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) from 
glucose and furfural and acetic acid from xylose. 
Cellulolysis using enzymes usually occurs at pH 4.8 and 45–50°C) and the enzymes are produced 
(by specialist enzyme companies such as Novozymes, Genecor, DSM, Danisco) from bacteria (eg. 
Cellulomonas fimi, Clostridium thermocellum, Bacteriodes cellulosolvens) or fungi (eg. Trichoderma reesei). 
The following stages are involved in enzymatic degradation of cellulose:
•	 Adsorption of the enzyme to the cellulose surface
•	 Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose to liberate sugars
•	 Desoprtion of cellulose
Cellulases degrade the β-1,4-D-glucan bonds in cellulose to yield predominantly glucose, and also some 
cellobiose (glucose disaccharide) and cello-oligosaccharides (see Sukumaran, 2008). “Cellulase” is a 
collective term for 3 major types of celluloytic enzyme activity:
1.	 Endo-β-1,4-glucanase (expose reducing and non-reducing ends within cellulose)
2.	 Exoglucanases (acting on reducing and non-reducing ends of cellulose)
--
Cellodextrinases (liberating glucose) 
--
Cellobiohydrolases (liberating cellobiose and cello-oligosaccharides)
3.	 β-Glucosidases (liberates glucose from cellobiose)
The activity of cellulase decreases during hydrolysis and this may be mitigated using surfactants (eg. 
Tween 80, polyoxyethylene glycol) to modify cellulose surface properties and minimise irreversible 
binding of the enzyme. Recycling of enzymes can increase cellulolysis and decrease costs. Cellulase 
activities are end-product inhibited by cellobiose and glucose and this may be reduced by: using high 
enzyme concentrations; supplementary β-glucosidases; ultrafiltration to remove produced sugars and 
SSF (see below). 
Depending on the source of lignocellulose, the following enzymolysis approaches can be employed:
•	 SHF separate hydrolysis and fermentation (biomass pretreated with cellulase)
•	 SSF (simultaneous saccharification and fermentation)
•	 DMC (direct microbial conversion) where the fermenting microbe also produces cellulose

SSF using, for example, the fungus Trichoderma reesei together with the yeast S. cerevisiae, involve 
simultaneous yeast fermentation of sugars produced by fungal cellulose hydrolysis. Compromise 
temperatures of ~38°C are employed (between the optima for hydrolysis, 45–50°C, and fermentation, 
30°C). Compared with 2-stage SHF processes, SSF has the following advantages: increased hydrolytic 
rates by yeast sugar utilisation to minimise cellulose inhibition; lower requirement for enzyme; lower 
sterility requirements; shorter times for bioprocessing and lower reactor volume since a single reactor 
is used. However, drawbacks include: inappropriate temperature for hydrolysis and fermentation and 
ethanol inhibition of enzymes. Sun & Cheng, 2002; Rudolf et al (2009)
DMC approaches may encompass cellulase production, cellulose hydrolysis and fermentation in a single 
integrated step that has been termed consolidated bioprocessing (CBP – see Lynd et al, 2005). Chapter 4 
covers lignocellulosic bioethanol fermentation aspects in more detail.
3.5	
Alternative routes to ethanol
Biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass may be achieved via two main routes:
1.	 Biological (as discussed in Chapters 3 and 4)
2.	 Thermochemical 
Biomass-to-liquid (BTL) processes involving thermochemical conversions utilise pyrolysis/gasification 
technologies to produce “syngas” (CO + H2) which acts as a progenitor for a wide range of biofuels, 
including bioethanol (eg. www.lanzarech.co.nz; Syntec Biofuel; Enerkem, Range Fuels; Gulf Coast 
Energy). For example, a Canadian facility (Enerkem Inc) has been reported to produce 360L of ethanol 
from woody waste using thermochemical gasification and catalytic conversion (see Ethanol Producer 
Magazine, January, 2009) and Range Fuels (http://www.rangefuels.com/) have reported (August 2010) 
production of cellulosic methanol using non-food biomass in Georgia, USA in the first phase of an 
operation to ultimately produce ~230 million litres of ethanol. Some anaerobic bacteria (eg. Clostridium 
spp.) can produce ethanol from syngas (eg. BRI Energy, Arkansas, USA).
Such technologies have a high demand for fossil fuel energy compared with biochemical routes to 
ethanol. These have been discussed in greater detail by Klass (1998) and Goyal, et al, 2008) and are not 
the focus of this book. 
Regarding ethanol production from non-biomass sources, “synthetic” ethanol from petrochemical 
sources is well-established (eg. Pasha & Rao, 2009). For example, indirect ethylene hydration to ethanol 
involves a three-step process using sulphuric acid:

Bioethanol
55 
Bioethanol feedstocks
1.	 The hydrocarbon feedstock containing 35–95% ethylene is exposed to 95–98% sulphuric 
acid in a column reactor to form mono- and diethyl sulphate.
CH2=CH2 + H2SO4→CH3CH2OSO3H
2(CH2=CH2)2SO2 + H2SO4→(CH3CH2O)2SO2
2.	 This is subsequently hydrolyzed with enough water to give 50–60% aqueous sulphuric acid 
solution:
CH3CH2OSO3H + H2O →CH3CH2OH + H2SO4
3.	 The ethanol is then separated from the dilute sulphuric acid in a stripper column. The last 
step of this process is to concentrate the sulphuric acid and recycle to the process.
Direct hydration of ethylene was commercialized in 1947. In this process, an ethylene-rich 
gas is combined with water and passes through a fixed-bed catalyst reactor, in which ethanol 
is formed according to the following reaction.
CH2=CH2 + H2O →CH3CH2OH
The ethanol is then recovered in a distillation system.

Both direct and indirect hydration of ethylene gives rise to undesirable by-products such as diethyl ether, 
which reduce the quality of ethanol. Other processes to make ethanol synthetically are not commercially 
important.

Microbes for fermentation 
The yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is the predominant industrial microorganism responsible 
for alcoholic fermentations. This organism, also known as baker’s or brewer’s yeast, is a 
unicellular microfungus that plays important roles in industry, the environment and medical 
science. It has been exploited for millennia in food and beverage fermentations and is the 
main “cell factory” in modern bioethanol production processes.
In addition to S. cerevisiae, non-Saccharomyces yeasts have potential in bioethanol fermentation processes 
and these are summarized in Table 4.1. Table 4.2 summarises some ethanologenic bacterial for use in 
bioethanol fermentations.

conditions.
Incapable (unless genetically modified) 
of fermenting pentose sugars (eg.

Numerous ethanologenic bacteria are known, some of which 
(eg. Zymomonas mobilis) produce ethanol more effectively than

stressful environment in large-scale bioethanol plants, and 
ethanol productivities are generally quite low.

Geobacillus stearothermophilus is a thermophile which ferments 
C5 and C6 sugars including short polymers at temperatures in 
excess of 60oC with yields ~80% theoretical maximum. It has 
been genetically modified to produce ethanol rather than lactate 
and formate (see www.tmo-group.com). Not particularly ethanol 
tolerant (~5% v/v). Attributes discussed by Candy (2009) 
Escherichia coli (with Z. mobilis genes encoding pyruvate 
decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase) and Erwinia 
chrysanthemi (with pyruvate decarboxylase genes) also have 
potential
G. stearothermophilus 0.40
E. coli 0.41
E. chrysanthemi 0.45
Table 4.1 Candidate bacteria for bioethanol fermentations
Ethanologenic microorganisms possess the key fermentative enzyme, pyruvate decorboxylase (see 4.2), 
and many yeasts, but few bacteria, express this activity. Zymomonas spp. (Z. mobilis and Z. palmae) are 
the only bacteria naturally (i.e. without genetic engineering) producing ethanol as the main fermentation 
product under anaerobic conditions.

Fermentation aspects
Microbes for lignocellulosic hydrolysate fermentations are subject to intense research activity. For 
example, Mousdale (2008) has listed over 30 US patents taken out in recent years for genetically 
engineered yeasts and bacteria that can produce ethanol from such feedstocks.
Genetic manipulation strategies with bioethanol yeasts are designed to:
•	
expand metabolic pathways and alleviate of metabolic blocks (expand substrate use by 
gene cloning, address issue of redox imbalances, eliminate/reduce or down-regulate 
feedback inhibition reactions, redirecting C flux through pathways to improve efficiency)
•	
circumvent sugar transport limitations (eg. glucose repression, new sugar transport 
permeases)
•	
overcome lignocellulosic hydrolysate toxicity 
•	
reduce recycling of process water in fermentation make up (high gravity fermentations)
Note that some non-GM approaches to improve the fermentation performance of bioethanol yeasts 
exist, including:
--
use of hexose and pentose-fermenting co-cultures (S.cerevisiae + Pichia stipitis)
--
immobilisation technology (yeast and enzyme (eg. xylose isomerase) immobilisation)
--
selection of indigenous (distillery resident) robust yeast strains
--
mineral preconditioning of yeast (Mg, Zn enrichment)
--
sterol pre-enrichment (pre-oxygenation, mild aeration)
--
improving ethanol tolerance (by nutrient (ethanol) adapatation in chemostats)
For existing and emerging industrial bioethanol fermentations, Fig 4.1 represents the main desirable 
characteristics of the fermenting microbe, and most of these are currently met by the yeast, S. cerevisiae.

Fermentation aspects
4.2	
Fermentation – theoretical aspects
Yeasts, in particular strains of S. cerevisiae, are the premier organisms for bioethanol production and 
the following section focuses on aspects of yeast physiology (nutrition, growth and metabolism) as they 
pertain to alcohol fermentations. (See Walker, 1998; 2009; 2010 for more information on yeasts).
In order to grow and ferment, yeast cells require a range of essential nutrients. These can be categorized as:
•	 macronutrients (sources of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur, phosphorus, potassium, and 
magnesium) required at the millimolar level in growth media; 
•	 micronutrients (sources of trace elements such as Ca, Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn) required at the 
micromolar level. 
Most yeasts grow quite well in simple nutritional media, which supplies carbon and nitrogen-backbone 
compounds together with inorganic ions and a few growth factors. The latter are organic compounds 
required in very low concentrations for specific catalytic or structural roles in yeast, but are not used as 
energy sources. Growth factors for yeast include vitamins, which serve vital functions as components 
of coenzymes; purines and pyrimidines; nucleosides and nucleotides; amino acids; fatty acids; sterols; 
and other miscellaneous compounds (e.g., polyamines and choline). 
Most yeasts thrive in warm, dilute, sugary, acidic, and aerobic environments. Industrial S. cerevisiae 
strains grow best from 20–30ºC and between pH 4.5 and 5.5. Concerning oxygen requirements, 
S. cerevisiae is not, strictly speaking, a facultative anaerobe and is generally unable to grow well 
under completely anaerobic conditions. This is because oxygen is needed as a growth factor for 
membrane biosynthesis, specifically for fatty acid (e.g., oleic acid) and sterol (e.g., ergosterol) 
biosynthesis.
S. cerevisiae species reproduces asexually by budding and sexually following the conjugation of cells of 
the opposite mating type. It is ellipsoid in shape with a large diameter of 5–10 µm and a small diameter 
of 1–7 µm. It is a eukaryotic microorganism that portrays the ultrastructural features similar to that of 
higher eukaryotic cells and possesses a nucleus, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, 
vacuoles, microbodies, and secretory vesicles. The growth of budding yeasts such as S. cerevisiae is 
concerned with how cells transport and assimilate nutrients and then integrate numerous component 
functions in the cell in order to increase in mass and eventually divide. Budding coincides with the 
onset of DNA synthesis, followed by localized weakening of the cell wall to allow the extrusion of the 
cytoplasm in an area bounded by new cell-wall material. In S. cerevisiae, multilateral budding is common 
in which daughter buds emanate from different locations on the mother cell surface. In S. cerevisiae, cell 
size at division is asymmetrical, with buds being smaller than mother cells when they separate. Under 
ideal (laboratory-optimised) conditions, S. cerevisiae can reproduce approximately every 90min, but in 
industrial fermenters the budding cycle takes considerably longer due to the stressful physico-chemical 
environment.

Fermentation aspects
For alcoholic fermentations conducted by S. cerevisiae, the principal fermentable sugars derived from first-
generation feedstocks are: sucrose, glucose and fructose (in sugarcane juice and in molasses), glucose and 
maltose (in cereal starch hydrolysates) and those derived from second generation feedstocks are glucose, 
xylose and arabinose (in lignocellulose hydrolysates). Note, however, that S. cerevisiae does not readily 
ferment the pentose (5-carbon) sugars xylose and arabinose and various microbiological and molecular 
genetic approaches have been adopted to enable efficient fermentation of these compounds (see 4.5). 
The metabolic pathway of glucose to pyruvate is called glycolysis (or, the Embden Meyerhof Parnas 
pathway) and may be summarised as follows:
Glucose + 2ADP + 2Pi+ + 2NAD+ → 2Pyruvate + 2ATP + 2NADH+ + 2H+
Where ATP = adenosine tri phosphate (biological energy)
NAD =   nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (a co-enzyme involved in biological oxidations 
and reductions; NAD+ is the oxidised form and NADH is the reduced form)
Pi =   inorganic phosphate

Fermentation aspects
In terms of chemical stoichiometry, the theoretical conversion to ethanol from glucose is as follows:
 
C6H12O6                                                 2C2H5OH    +    2CO2 
Glucose                                                   Ethanol          Carbon dioxide 
180kg                                                        92kg                    88kg 
For each kilogram of glucose fermented, around 470g of ethanol can be produced (i.e. <50%) representing 
a yield of 92% of theoretical maximum. However, in industrial fermentation practice, the best yields 
obtainable are only around 90% of this theoretical conversion (eg. using sugarcane molasses as feedstock). 
This is because fermentable carbon is diverted to new yeast biomass and minor fermentation metabolites 
(organic acids, esters, aldehydes, fusel oils etc).
The overall glucose-to-ethanol pathway, involving fermentative enzymes, is summarised in Fig 4.2. 
Individual glycolytic enzyme-catalysed reactions have been omitted for clarity. In more biochemical 
detail, it can be stated that fermentative yeasts are able to use sugars in the absence of oxygen as electron 
donor, electron acceptor, and carbon source. In doing so, S. cerevisiae reoxidizes the reduced co-enzyme 
NADH to NAD+ in terminal step reactions emanating from pyruvate.

Fermentation aspects
In the first of the terminal fermentative reactions, pyruvate is decarboxylated to acetaldehyde (catalyzed 
by pyruvate decarboxylase), which is finally reduced by alcohol dehydrogenase to ethanol as follows: 
                                    1                                                         2 
CH3COCOOH                               CH3CHO + CO2                                CH3CH2OH 
    Pyruvate                               Acetaldehyde + CO2                                Ethanol 
 
                                    Enzyme 1   Pyruvate decarboxylase 
                                    Enzyme 2   Alcohol dehydrogenase 
The regeneration of NAD maintains the redox balance and keeps glycolysis proceeding. In essence, the 
glycolytic pathway may be summarised as:
•	 Enzymatic oxidations/phosphorylations of glucose to yield two molecules of pyruvate (i.e. a 
6 carbon sugar is split into 2 pieces of a 3 carbon compound)
•	 Energy is generated (2ATP)
•	 Oxidative processes generate reduced co-enzyme (NADH) 
•	 NAD+ is re-generated by the terminal fermentative enzyme, alcohol dehydrogenase 
Saccharomyces yeasts Zymomonas bacteria both convert sugars to ethanol via homoethanol pathways, 
but by different routes. S. cerevisiae employs the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway, whilst Z. mobilis 
emplys the Etner-Doudoroff pathway (Jarboe, Shanmugam and Ingram, 2009).
Sugars that are fermented by yeast are converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide as the principal 
metabolic products, but during alcohol fermentations (e.g., of beer, wine, distilled spirits and fuel 
alcohol), other fermentation metabolites, in addition to ethanol and carbon dioxide, are produced by 
yeast. For beverage production, these are important in the development of flavour, but for bioethanol 
production, their production by yeast is undesirable (due to loss of ethanol yield). These metabolites 
include: fusel alcohols (e.g., isoamyl alcohol); polyols (e.g., glycerol); esters (e.g., ethyl acetate); organic 
acids (e.g., succinate); vicinyl diketones (e.g., diacetyl); and aldehydes (e.g., acetaldehyde).
The undesirability of production of secondary fermentation metabolites (notably glycerol) in bioethanol 
plants leads to potential loss of ethanol and efforts are made to dissipate this. For example, simultaneous 
saccharification and fermentation (SSF) processes – see 4.2) prevent osmostress and this limits the 
production of glycerol as an undesired by-product. Construction of yeast strains with reduced glycerol 
production is also possible (eg. Guo et al, 2009). Ebert (2009) has calculated that reducing glycerol 
concentration at the end of fermentation by as little as 0.1% (from 1.4 to 1.3%) would produce an 
additional 163,600 gallons of ethanol in a 40MMGY distillery.

Variations of the systems outlined in Table 4.31 are possible and one example of a semi-continuous 
operation is the modified Melle-Boinot system adopted in many Brazilian fuel ethanol plants (Amorim, 
Basso and Lopes, 2009 and section 4.5). Other systems include:
•	 simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF)
•	 direct microbial conversion technologies (DMC) 
•	 very high gravity fermentations (VHG)
4.3.2	
Fermentation monitoring
Irrespective of the fermentation system employed, bioethanol producers seek to achieve fast and efficient 
conversion of available sugars to ethanol. Typical parameters monitored during fermentation include: 
changes in yeast cell density, sugar consumption, pH, temperature, degree of foaming and alcohol. To 
ensure consistency of fermentation performance, distilleries not only monitor, but also control several 
of these parameters, notably temperature and pH. Of particular importance are spirit yield calculations, 
conversion efficiencies (of sugar to ethanol) and the relationship between initial sugar concentration and 
final yield of ethanol. Table 4.32 provides some typical data concerning expected ethanol yields from 
different feedstocks.

Table 4.32 Ethanol yields from sugars derived from different feedstocks 
(Information from Abbas, 2007)
The predicted spirit yield (PSY) predicts how many litres of alcohol can be expected to be made from 1 
tonne of cereal. It is calculated from the extract and fermentability of the cereal. This has been traditionally 
measured in the potable alcohol industry by lab scale process of milling, mashing, fermentation and 
distillation, but more recently near infra‐red analysers can provide rapid predictions. Typical values for 
wheat would be 385–400 litres/tonne. From a more agronomical viewpoint, bioethanol feedstocks may 
also be ranked according to potential ethanol yields per hectare of cultivable land and the following 
provides some examples (Annon, 1986; Gatel & Cormack, 1986):
Sweet sorghum 	
4.0–6.5 tonnes ethanol/ha
Wheat 	
4.8 tonnes ethanol/ha
Jerusalem artichoke 	
4.0–4.7 tonnes ethanol/ha
Sugar beet 	
3.3–3.8 tonnes ethanol/ha
Chicory 	
2.0–3.0 tonnes ethanol/ha
Potato 	
2.0–2.9 tonnes ethanol/ha
4.3.3	
Fermentation: microbiological issues
In order to maximise ethanol fermentation efficiency for bioethanol production, it is important to 
ensure yeast is of good viability and vitality and also to minimise levels of contaminant bacteria. Poor 
yeast quality and the presence of wild yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (mainly Lactobacillus spp.) in the 
fermenting medium can subtract significantly from ethanol yield.
Every molecule of lactic acid made in a fermenter by Lactobacilli that compete with yeast for sugars 
means the loss of a molecule of ethanol. The importance of sterilization of fermenters, yeast mixing 
vessels and associated pipe-work should not be underestimated in an effort to control bacteria.

Fermentation aspects
Lactic acid bacteria are sensitive to acids and many distilleries acid-wash (eg. H2SO4) their yeast slurries to 
reduce bacterial contamination. Major concerns for bioethanol plant operators relate to unwanted microbes 
and additional contamination control measures centre on good plant hygiene and cleanliness involving:
•	 use of preventative antibiotics (although many countries now have strict measures on such 
applications)
•	 chemical cleaners, sanitisers, sterilants (eg. chlorine dioxide, ammonium bifluoride, 
potassium bisulphite, hydrogen peroxide, hop acids), some as alternatives to antibiotics in 
fermenters
•	 heat sterilisation (of raw materials, air, water, vessels). 
Regarding the nature of yeast for bioethanol fermentations, it is crucial to employ the correct strain 
for specific applications and to maintain the strain as a pure culture free from wild yeast and bacterial 
contaminants. Different distilling strains of S. cerevisiae are available from yeast manufacturers (eg. 
Fermentis, Lallemand Ethanol Technology, AB Mauri) as cream, compressed (cake) and dried preparations.

Fermentation aspects
Commercially available strains of S. cerevisiae have now been developed that can produce ethanol at 
relatively high concentrations (>10%v/v), can ferment effectively in high (>20%) solids and are generally 
stable and robust to survive the rigours of industrial fermentations (Fig 4.32). Through careful attention 
to yeast nutritional physiology, it is now possible to produce over 20%v/v ethanol in high gravity wheat 
fermentations (Thomas and Ingledew, 1992).
Some distilleries operate yeast recycling and this circumvents the need to regularly purchase new 
batches of yeast from commercial suppliers. Other plants conduct their own (fairly rudimentary) yeast 
propagation in order to boost biomass required as starter cultures for fermentation. These propagators 
employ vigourous aeration to stimulate yeast growth.
Fig 4.32 Environmental stresses experienced by bioethanol yeasts
There is a need to further develop stress-resistance in industrial yeast strains, particularly with regard to 
temperature and ethanol tolerance, and the ability to withstand chemical inhibitors such as those found 
in lignocellulose hydrolysates (acids, phenols, furans etc – see 4.6). These are topics of intense research 
and development, often involving genetic engineering to enable yeast cells to withstand environmental 
stress and overcome substrate toxicity (eg. Bettiga et al 2008). 
4.4	
Sucrose fermentations
Simple-sugar feedstocks in the form of sugar cane, sugar beet and sweet sorghum provide sugars 
in the form of sucrose, glucose and fructose that can be directly fermented by yeast and these 
crops account for around half of bioethanol produced globally. No extraneous enzymes are 
required to liberate sugars for yeast fermentation, as S. cerevisiae produces the enzyme invertase 
to hydrolyse sucrose into readily-fermentable glucose and fructose.

Fermentation aspects
For sugar juices, ethanol yields are improved following heat treatment and clarification to reduce 
impurities and bacterial and wild yeast contaminants. Mixing clarified juice with molasses improves 
yeast nutrition and fermentation performance. In sugar cane and sugar beet refineries, a dark brown, 
syrupy liquid known as molasses is generated following sucrose crystallisation/centrifugation. The 
more sucrose that is removed, the poorer the molasses quality for alcohol fermentations, but generally 
speaking, molasses represents a nutritional medium for yeast (see section 3.1). Nevertheless, molasses 
does contain some compounds that are formed during sugar processing that can inhibit yeast activity 
during fermentation (potassium salts, browning reaction compounds, furfurals, formic acid etc). 
Some fuel ethanol plants employ diluted molasses (20-25% total sugar) that is treated with sulphuric 
acid (to pH 4.5) and heated to 90°C prior to decanting for impurity removal.
Two basic fermentation systems are employed for sugar-based bioethanol production: 
1.	 Fed-batch addition of substrate with yeast propagation
2.	 Fed-batch addition of substrate with yeast recycle
These systems have been described by Amorim et al (2009) and Monceaux (2009). In the first system, 
each fermenter is pitched with freshly grown yeast (to minimise bacterial contamination) followed by 
controlled addition of sugar substrate. In the second system, recycled acid-washed yeast is introduced 
to sugar-rich substrate every 12 hours or so to achieve very rapid fermentations and minimum yeast 
growth. The yeast recycling consists of treatment with sulphuric acid (to pH 2.2) to minimise bacterial 
contamination. Ethanol concentrations achievable in the latter system are 8–10% v/v. Basso et al (2008) 
have discussed the behaviour of yeasts in Brazilian fuel alcohol plants employing yeast recycling. 
Distillery-resident strains of yeast in such systems exhibit higher tolerances to stress compared with 
cultured strains and have potential as selected starter cultures for Brazilian bioethanol processes.

Starch hydrolysate fermentations
If we take bioethanol-from-maize (Zea mays) as an example of a starch-based process for fermentation 
the several key stages can be outlined. Fig 4.5 outlines a simplified production process of bioethanol from 
maize using the dry-grind process described in 3.1. Such processes are capable (in the US) of producing 
>400 litres of ethanol per tonne of maize (at 63% starch).

The following stages in this process can be summarised:
1.	 Maize grain milling (particle size reduction)
2.	 Mashing and cooking (milled maize mixed with water and heated to gelatinise starch)
3.	 Liquefaction (commercial α-amylase enzymes added to reduce viscosity and produce 
maltose and dextrins)
4.	 Saccharification (commercial glucoamylase added to liberate fermentable sugars from 
dextrins)
5.	 Fermentation (yeast conversion of sugars to ethanol and CO2)
6.	 Distillation (ethanol concentrated to ~95%v/v)
7.	 Dehydration (near-anhydrous ethanol produced using molecular sieves)
8.	 Centrifugation (produces thin stillage and wet cake)
9.	 Evaporation (thin stillage concentrated to a syrup)
10.	Drying (evaporated stillage and wet cake dried and mixed to 90% dry wt DDGS)

Fig 4.5 Ethanol production from maize (dry-grind process)
The maize wet-milling process fractionate the cereal grains into starch, germ, gluten and fibre to yield 
a variety of products. The maize starch slurry is converted (following amylolysis using commercial 
enzymes) by yeast to ethanol and carbon dioxide. DDGS are also generated.

Lignocellulosic hydrolysate fermentations
Fig 4.51 outlines the general scheme for producing bioethanol from lignocellulose and Fig 4.52 
summarises the SSF and SHF processes.
The following outlines the theoretical conversion of cellulose to glucose:
(C6H5O5)n +  nH20    
  nC6H12O6    
 2n CH3CH2OH  +  2nCO2

Ethanol yields (litres/dry metric ton) from the following lignocellulose sources are possible (Sassner 
et al, 2008):
Hardwood: 345 and 121 from hexose and pentose fermentation, respectively
Softwood: 426 and 59 from hexose and pentose fermentation, respectively
Corn stover: 302 and 191 from hexose and pentose fermentation, respectively
From wheat straw, yields of ~300 litres of bioethanol per ton would be expected.

In practice, such conversions are inefficient and improving the overall cellulose-to-ethanol process 
remains a technological challenge, for several reasons including those outlined below.
Lignocellulosic biomass from woody wastes, corn cobs/stover, switchgrass, spent grains, paper waste, 
municipal solid waste etc. can be pre-treated and hydrolysed (section 3.2; Dien and Bothast, 2009) to 
produce fermentable sugars, and cocktails of chemical inhibitors (see Fig 4.55). Such chemicals include 
breakdown products of sugars (furfural and hydroxymethyl furfural) as well as organic acids (namely, 
acetic acid from hemicellulose, formic and levulinic acid from sugar degradation) and lignin-degradation 
products (primarily phenolic compounds such as ferulic and coumaric acids). These compounds can 
act to suppress the activities of yeast (and bacteria) in converting hydrolysate sugars to ethanol. Further 
problems arise due to the presence of heterogeneous C5 and C6 sugar slurries derived from lignocellulosic 
feedstocks as these are not readily fermented by yeast (see below).

Fig 4.51 Schematic view of a generalised lignocellulose-to-bioethanol process (adapted from Sassner et al 2008)
Several systems are employed in processing and fermenting lignocellulosic hudrolysates: batch, 
fed-batch, simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF), simultaneous saccharification and 
co-fermentation (SSCF), separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF), consolidated bioprocessing 
(CBP), drop-add, or continuous cascades. These processes frequently involve enzymatic (or microbial) 
hydrolysis comprising: production of cellulases and hemicellulases; hydrolysis of pre-treated biomass; 
fermentation of hexose (glucose, mannose, galactose) and pentose (xylose, arabinose) sugars. CBP 
processes, developed by Lynd and colleagues (Lynd et al 2002; 2005) permit these bioconversions to 
occur in a single step without the need for a production stage for cellulolytic enzymes.

Fig 4.52 Outline of simultaneous sacchrification and fermentation (SSF) and separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) 
processes for conversion of lignocellulose to bioethanol
When cellulose and hemicellulose polymers are hydrolysed, the resultant monomeric sugars represent a 
mixture of C5 (pentose) and C6 (hexose) sugars. Conventional yeasts like Saccharomyces cerevisiae are 
able to effectively ferment hexoses (mainly glucose), but are unable to metabolise pentose sugars such 
as xylose and arabinose. Fig 4.53 outlines the xylose fermentation pathway in microorganisms.

Fig 4.53 Pathways for microbial xylose utlisation
Various approaches have been adopted to overcome this dilemma. These include:
•	 The use, either singularly or in co-fermentations with other C6-fermenting yeast species, 
of yeasts with pentose-fermenting ability. Examples of such yeasts include: Pichia stipitis, 
Candida shehatae, Kluyveromyces marxianus (see Table 4.51). These yeasts, however, are 
unable to ferment pentoses anaerobically;
•	 Genetic engineering of S. cerevisiae with the metabolic machinery to enable it to ferment 
xylose. Successful cloning of xylose isomerase genes from fungi (eg. Piromyces), other 
yeasts (eg. Pichia stipitis) and bacteria (eg. see Butalco GmbH, http://butalco.com/) into 
S. cerevisiae has been achieved enabling this yeast to effectively ferment xylose (see Fig 4.54 
and van Maris et al, 2006); 
•	 Use of genetically engineered bacteria, such as E. coli, Zymononas, Klebsiella oxytoca, 
Thermoanaerobacetrium, Geobacillus (with xylose-utilising genes).

Fig 4.54 provides a schematic of the approach to engineer S. cerevisiae with foreign xylose isomerise (XI) 
genes. The expression of XI genes, rather than xylose reductase (XR) and xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH) 
avoids accumulation of xylitol and an imbalance of the co-factors NADPH and NAD.

Bettiga et al (2008); Brat et al (2009) and Kuyper et al, 2003) have discussed various molecular biological 
strategies for xylose fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Several of these approaches have been 
successful and there are now some industrial-scale lignocellulosic bioethanol plants in operation. For 
example, in the US: Mascoma, Poet, Range Fuels, Verenium*, Celunol, DuPont; in Canada: Iogen and 
in Europe: DONG (Denmark), TMO (UK, The Netherlands).
* In August 2010, BP acquired Verenium’s cellulosic biofuels business, including Jennings (San Diego, USA) facilities.
Fig 4.54 Xylose fermentation with GM S. cerevisiae expressing xylose isomerise
Some bacterial processes operate at high temperatures and recombinant a Geobacillus spp. can ferment 
straw hydrolysate at 70°C in a continuous fermentation (eg. www.tmo-group.com). For lignocellulosic 
ethanol, such thermophilic bacteria possess some key advantages over yeast-based processes, including 
continuous utilisation of all C5 and C6 sugars at high temperatures at a fast rate. However, some of these 
bacteria are not particularly ethanol tolerant (at levels >8%v/v). Table 4.52 shows some thermophilic 
bacteria with cellulolytic, ethanologenic properties.

For yeast processes, significant challenges remain to engineer yeast strains for lignocellulosic hydrolysates. 
There are also major challenges presented in such hydrolysates due to the presence of chemicals that 
are toxic to the fermentative microorganisms (yeasts and bacteria). The sources of these chemicals are 
outlined in Fig 4.55.

Fig 4.55 Sources of chemical inhibitors derived from acid-hydrolysis of lignocellulose
Rudolf et al (2009) have outlined various methods to alleviate the deleterious effect of chemical inhibitors 
in lignocellulosic hydrolysates. For example, “steam stripping” (see Zhu et al, 2009) or nanofiltration 
membranes (eg. Weng et al, 2010) or polymeric adsorbent materials (eg XAD-4 amberlite resin – see 
Wei et al 2002) can be used to selectively remove inhibitors from the soluble sugar fractions derived 
from biomass hydrolysates. Although modern scientific developments are undoubtedly assisting 
lignocellulose-to-ethanol bioconversions, it should be mentioned that fermentations of wood 
hydrolysates are not particularly new technologies, and there are some examples of industrial scale-
plants in Europe and Siberia that have been operational for many years (eg. Borregaard in Norway – 
http://www.borregaard.com, a company established in 1918; and Tavda Hydroysis Plant in Russia since 
1943 – see http://www.distill.com/woodhydrolysis/woodprocess.html).

Distillation

5.1	
Distillation technology – theoretical aspects
The recovery of ethanol from fermented media is predominantly performed by distillation. “Distillation” 
refers to separation of mixtures of two or more chemicals on basis of differences in their volatility, which 
is the ratio of the partial pressure to the mole fraction in the liquid. For alcohol:
                                  Volatility of alcohol 
Relative Volatility Į = Volatility of water  
The detailed theory of distillation is outwith the scope of this book and the reader is referred to a classic 
text on the subject (Robinson and Gilliland, 1950). Basically, alcohol distillation therefore refers to the 
separation of ethanol from a binary alcohol-water mixture based on their different boiling points (see 
Fig 5.11), and there are some common fundamental principles that pertain to all alcohol distillation 
systems:

Distillation
1.	 A dilute ethanolic solution is fed into the system (a column)
2.	 Heat (usually steam) directly enters the base of the column
3.	 The purified (“overhead”) product with the lower boiling point (i.e. ethanol) is vapourised 
4.	 The higher boiling point product (i.e. dilute aqueous stillage) is received at the bottom of the column
5.	 A water-cooled heat exchanger condenses the alcohol vapour 
6.	 The condensate is split into 2 streams – one is the desired product and the other is the reflux which 
is returned to the top of the tower
The column (as in Fig 5.11) comprises a rectifying section (above the entry point for the fermented 
mixture) and a stripping section (below the entry point) and in this way a relatively pure ethanol 
overhead product and a “bottoms” stillage product can be produced. Fig 5.1 is a very simplified system 
and in practice the column comprises several internal structures called “trays” to permit intimate contact 
between rising ethanol vapour and descending liquid to facilitate their passage and separation.

Distillation
Fig 5.12 shows the ethanol-water equilibrium at atmospheric pressure, where x is the ethanol concentration 
in liquid, and y in the vapour phase. The plot could also be made for mole percent ethanol (Masdon, 
2009) and allows tower distillation units to be analysed by graphical techniques. For example, the 45° line 
(showing points at which the vapour concentration equals the liquid concentration) drawn on Fig 5.12 can 
be used to determine the ranges of compositions that can be separated and the distillation conditions where 
it is not possible to perform a separation. Where the equilibrium curve crosses the 45° line, the mixture 
forms an azeotrope. Fuel ethanol needs to be almost completely dry and simple single-stage distillation 
systems can never produce 100% (or anhyrdrous) ethanol due to the formation of constant boiling ethanol-
water azeotropes. Standard distillation only produces around 96% v/v ethanol and additional approaches 
are needed to completely de-hydrate ethanol (see 5.3) for blending with petrol (gasoline).

Of course, the liquid following fermentation does solely comprise ethanol and numerous yeast secondary 
fermentation metabolites and other compounds are also present that are distilled. Volatile chemicals 
present in distillates are collectively referred to as “congeners” by the potable spirits industry and comprise:
•	 Low volatility congeners. These are the higher alcohols which are often termed usel oils (e.g. 
optically active amyl alcohol, iso amyl alcohol, isobutanol, propanol, 2-phenylethanol) and 
fatty acids (e.g. propionic, isobutyric, isovaleric, hexanoic, octanoic).
•	 Medium volatility congeners. These include esters (e.g. ethyl acetate, ethyl propionate, ethyl 
octanoate, phenylethyl acetate, ethyl palmitate)
•	 High volatility congeners. These include acetaldehyde, diacetyl, acetone, methanol and some 
sulphur compounds

For both potable and fuel alcohol distillation processes, fusel oils (the higher alcohols) need to be 
processed to recover ethanol and a decanter can be used for their separation (and return for further 
rectification) from the water-alcohol stream. Fusel oil may be concentrated by a distillation column 
before feeding the decanter. The main fusel oil constituents (percentage by weight) are: iso-amyl alcohol 
87.3%; iso-butyl alcohol 0.7%; and n-propanol 0.3%.

Distillation technology – applied aspects
Various options are available for the design and optimisation of distillation systems for producing 
bioethanol and these have been discussed in detail by Madson (2009). Tried and tested systems are 
available for distilling ethanol from cereals, sugar cane juice and molasses and other fermentation 
feedstocks. Diverse systems incorporate various modes of batch and continuous distillation encompassing 
standard and multi-column stills.

Bioethanol

Distillation
The basic operation of a continuous alcohol distillation column system involves the following stages:
•	 Steam is sparged at the base of the column 
•	 Dilute alcoholic liquid flows across a feed plate into the column
•	 Downcomer pipes permit the liquid to flow down through a series of sieve plates (trays)
•	 Holes in the sieve plates permit vapours to pass upwards through the column
•	 The stripping section below the feed plate separates the more volatile from the less volatile 
components
•	 The rectifying section above the sieve plates concentrates the more volatile components
Newer systems focus on water recycling, energy conservation and computer control systems for process 
optimisation. Modern technological developments for bioethanol production include vacuum distillation 
and pervaporation using membranes. Because distillation is the major energy-consuming stage in 
bioethanol production, such new technologies are sought to improve overall energy balances in modern 
biorefineries. Another approach is to increase the ethanol concentration in the final beer to be distilled, 
as exemplified by energy consumption figures in Table 5.2.

Anhydrous ethanol methods
Although ethanol is completely miscible in petrol (gasoline), even small amounts of water can quickly 
lead to phase separation (when ethanol will absorb any water present in the system) and this in turn 
can lead to poor vehicle performance and potentially engine damage. Hydrated ethanol at ~96%v/v is 
obtained following distillation of the “beer” (fermented feedstock) is therefore de-hydrated (i.e. to produce 
anhydrous ethanol) for petrol-blending using various approaches outlined in Table 5.3. 
Although various options are available for anhydrous ethanol recovery, the use molecular sieves has 
proved successful on an industrial scale and this approach is commonplace in new bioethanol plants. 
The “sieving” involves the properties of synthetic zeolite resins with pore sizes small enough (0.3nm) that 
permit water molecules (0.28nm diameter) to penetrate, but not ethanol molecules (0.44 nm diameter). 
Swain (2003) has discussed operation of molecular sieves for ethanol dehydration.
Method
Description & comments
Azeotropic distillation
Addition of a solvent (eg. benzene, cyclohexane or monoethylene glycol) to 
break the ethanol-water azeotrope (see 5.1). When the additive is more volatile 
than water, separation is called azeotropic distillation, and when it is less volatile 
than water, it is called extractive distillation. Now seldom used due to solvent 
carcinogenicity/toxicity.
Molecular sieves
Examples include zeolite resins (“molsieves”), and synthetic zeolites (based 
on aluminium silicates) that act as desiccants to selectively adsorb water from 
aqueous ethanol streams Bibb Swain (2009).
Vacuum distillation
Anhydrous ethanol obtained under pressures of 10kPa.
Membrane pervaporation
The use of membranes to recover ethanol by “pervaporation” (ethanol removal 
by vacuum applied at the permeate side of a membrane) conserves energy by 
abolishing energy-expensive distillation. It is possible to concentrate ethanol 
from 80 to 99.5% by pervaporation ((Parisi, 1986). It can also reduce yeast 
ethanol (and inhibitor) toxicity problems if applied during fermentation.
Miscellaneous
eg. Liquid extraction, supercritical fluid extraction, Intermediate Heat pumps 
and Optimal Sidestream Return (IHOSR) technique using an inorganic salt 
(potassium acetate) as entrainer (see Serra et al, 1987)

Distillation
Anhydrous bioethanol can also be used for the production of other fuel additives, such as the high-
octane gasoline component bio-ETBE (1kg of which is composed of 0.4975kg ethanol and 0.5025 kg 
isobutylene).
5.4	
Biorefinery concept 
A biorefinery (term originally coined by Charles Abbas from ADM company in the US, and analogous to 
a petro-refinery) is a singular facility that produces multiple products from biomass and may be defined 
as follows: “A biorefinery processes renewable agricultural feedstocks to higher value added products for use 
as food, feed, fuel, or fiber” (Realff and Abbas, 2004). Biorefining has been defined by the International 
Energy Authority (IEA) as: “The sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of bio-based products 
(food, feed, chemicals, materials) and bioenergy (biofuels, power and/or heat”.
In the current context, a biorefinery comprises integrated biomass conversion technologies to produce, 
not only bioethanol, but other useful and valuable commodities including energy (see Fig 5.4). This 
has been discussed by Pilgrim and Wright (2009) and the range of value-added chemical commodities 
potentially obtainable from a bioethanol biorefinery include: cosmetics, neutraceuticals, bioplastics, 
solvents, herbicides etc. These represent high-value, but low-volume products (as opposed to high-
volume, low-value bioethanol and DDGS). For example, corn stover residues from a corn bioethanol 
plant can be utilised in an additional fermentation step to produce polylactic acid (PLA), a valuable 
commodity in the manufacture of biodegradable films and fibres (Gruber, 2003).

In essence, the biorefinery concept is to exploit the whole biomass, rather than just a component of it, 
using chemical and biotechnologies in a sustainable manner that reduces waste and saves energy. The 
concept of “zero emissions” in biorefining has been discussed by Gravitis (2007).

6.1	
Quality parameters – process and product
Although the bioethanol industry is not regulated to the same extent as the food or pharmaceutical 
sectors, Ebert (2009) has discussed voluntary quality assurance models for fuel ethanol production 
plants, based on:
--
ISO (International Organisation for Standardisation)
--
HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points)
--
USDA PVP (United States Department of Agriculture Process Verification Program)
--
Six Sigma
Quality control monitoring for individual bioethanol plants, based on teamwork and accurate statistical 
analyses of process data, is essential to boost profitability and maintain competitiveness.
In addition to ensuring quality of bioethanol processes, quality parameters of the end product are also 
important. In the US, The American Society for Testing and Materials International (ASTM) approves 
analytical specifications for bioethanol transportation fuel performance quality (Davis, 2009). This 
includes the key parameters to be measured, their units of measurement and their influence on quality. 
For example, pH and water elimination are important parameters for internal combustion engines 
The Renewable Fuels Association (RFA) recommend minimum testing frequencies and methods for 
bioethanol to ensure product quality and consistency and to meet ASTM standards. Table 6.1 provides 
an example of ASTM specification for denatured fuel ethanol and E85.
Additional aspects of bioethanol formulations and specifications for gasoline blends, are described in 6.2.

ASTM publish standards with specifications for the following bioethanol products:
--
ASTM D 4806-07 (Standard specification for denatured fuel ethanol for blending with 
gasolines for use as automotive spark-ignition engine fuel)
--
ASTM D 5798-07 (Standard specification for fuel ethanol (Ed75–Ed85) for automotive 
spark-ignition engines)
These specifications are updated regularly (www.astm.org) and those for denatured bioethanol and E85 
(for 2007) are presented in Table 6.1. The specification for denatured ethanol defines the acceptable and 
unacceptable hydrocarbon denaturants and these are also regulated by the US Alcohol and Tobacco Tax 
and Trade Bureau (TTB) to ensure bioethanol is unfit for human consumption. Gasoline (petrol) is an 
acceptable denaturant, and anhydrous ethanol may be denatured with diethyl phthalate and isopropanol 
(Mansfield et al (1999).
In most countries, bioethanol is blended with gasoline at proportions of 2-10%, thecurrent exception 
being Brazil where all gasoline used contains 20–25% ethanol (E20, E25). For blending with gasoline, 
ethanol requires to be anhydrous. For flex-fuel vehicles, FFVs (and those in Brazil that run on “neat” 
ethanol), hydrated ethanol is used.

Environmental aspects
7	 Environmental aspects
7.1	
Sustainability and climate change
The demand and utilisation of global energy has increased dramatically in recent times, particularly due 
to the rapid rate of industrialisation in developing countries (eg. India and China). Currently, this energy 
is being met primarily by combusting fossil fuels – over 80% of the 13TW of energy used globally. In 
turn, this has led to elevation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (especially carbon dioxide) in the 
atmosphere which is causing global warming and resultant changes in our climate.
“There is now clear scientific evidence that emissions from economic activity are causing changes to 
the Earth’s climate” (Stern, 2007).
The production and use of biofuels such as bioethanol, at the expense of fossil fuels, contribute in a 
meaningful way to reducing GHG emissions. This is because the biomass feedstocks employed fix carbon 
dioxide photosynthetically during their growth and this leads to significant reductions in CO2-equivalent 
GHG emissions compared to oil and gas combustion. Importantly in this context, the combustion of 
road transport fuel is currently responsible for around 20 % of GHG emissions. 
The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have stated that, relative to gasoline, utilisation of corn 
ethanol reduces GHG emissions by at least 20%.and sugar cane ethanol by an average of 61%.(making 
this particular feedstock on a par with cellulosic ethanol emissions). In 2006, the combustion of 4.9 
billion gallons of bioethanol saved ~8 million tons of CO2, which equated to removal of 1.2 million 
automobiles (Pilgrim, 2009).
Significantly, cellulosic ethanol useage reduces emissions far in excess of 60% (Renewable Fuels 
Association, 2010). Regarding the latter, switchgrass-derived ethanol was determined by the EPA to 
reduce GHG emissions by 110%!
According to the Kyoto Agreement, Europe is committed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 8% 
from 2008–2012. The European Parilament’s Directive 2009/30/EC provides some information on GHG 
emissions and savings (compared to fossil fuel combustion) of bioethanol (L 140/88 EN Official Journal 
of the European Union 5.6.2009). Table 7.1 provides a summary of such savings (assuming no net carbon 
emissions from land use change).
Under the EU Renewable Energy Directive, which was established in 2009, the 27-nation bloc was set 
the target of ensuring that 20% of its energy consumption came from renewable sources by 2020. The 
directive also required nations to ensure that renewables accounted for 10% of the energy used in the 
transport sector.

Bioethanol
97 
Environmental aspects
Additional environmental and health benefits of bioethanol production include:
•	 Removal of toxic methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) as a gasoline oxygenate (especially in 
the US)
•	 Ethanol as an oxygenate reduces harmful exhaust pipe emissions due to more complete fuel 
combustion (ethanol contains 35% oxygen)
•	 Toxic and carcinogenic gasoline additives (eg. lead, benzene) are replaced by ethanol
•	 Ethanol is readily biodegradable
Although ethanol is less toxic when combusted compared with petrol or diesel (much less emissions of 
nitrous oxides and carbon monoxide gases and less volatile organic carbon compounds) and is more 
biodegradable in the environment, it should be mentioned that “clean and green” credentials of bioethanol 
have been questioned (eg. by the US Senate Hearing on The National Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals 
Act 1999). Journalists have even gone as far as describing corn ethanol production as the “Big green fuel 
lie” (Howden, 2007) and “Fields of dreams” (Girling, 2008). 
Products from ethanol combustion include formaldehyde and acetaldehyde (known carcinogens), 
may lead to increased levels of atmospheric peroxyacetylnitrate (PAN). Additionally, emissions of 
acetaldehyde may deleteriously affect air quality as this compound is an ozone precursor (Jacobsen 
et al, 2007).
Regarding the question of bioethanol being a sustainable industry, it is apparent that the increasing use 
of cereals and sugar beet crops for biofuel production is ultimately unsustainable (and unethical) due 
to deleterious impacts on human food security as agricultural land is diverted to biofuels. [The World 
Conservation Union in Switzerland have even suggested that the grain required to fill the tank of one 
vehicle with ethanol would be sufficient to feed one person per year.] A possible 1st-generation feedstock 
exception to this is sugar cane (www.iea.org), particularly in Brazil where this may be regarded as a 
sustainable crop. 
European countries are being encouraged to set up certification schemes to ensure biofuels help cut 
emissions and do not threaten biodiversity. The European Palrilament and the Council of the European 
Union have decreed that “Biofuel production should be sustainable” and a relevant section in the legislation 
is presented in Table 7.1.

Environmental aspects
The increasing worldwide demand for biofuels, and the incentives for their use provided for in this 
Directive should not have the effect of encouraging the destruction of biodiverse lands. Those finite 
resources, recognised in various international instruments to be of value to all mankind, should be 
preserved. Consumers in the Community would, in addition, find it morally unacceptable that their 
increased use of biofuels could have the effect of destroying biodiverse lands. For these reasons, it is 
necessary to provide sustainability criteria ensuring that biofuels can qualify for the incentives only 
when it can be guaranteed that they do not originate in biodiverse areas or, in the case of areas 
designated for nature protection purposes or for the protection or rare, threatened or endangered 
ecosystems or species, the relevant competent authority demonstrates that the production of the 
raw material does not interfere with those purposes. The sustainability criteria should consider forest 
as biodiverse where it is a primary forest in accordance with the definition used by the Food and 
Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) in its Global Forest Resource Assessment, which 
countries use worldwide to report on the extent of primary forest or where it is protected by national 
nature protection law. Areas where collection of non-wood forest products occurs should be included, 
provided the human impact is small. Other types of forests as defined by the FAO, such as modified 
natural forests, semi natural forests and plantations, should not be considered as primary forests. 
Having regard furthermore, to the highly biodiverse nature of certain grasslands, both temperate 
and tropical, including highly biodiverse savannahs, steppes, scrublands and prairies, biofuels made 
from raw materials originating in such lands should not qualify for the incentives provided for by 
this Directive. The Commission should establish appropriate criteria and geographical ranges to 
define such highly biodiverse grasslands in accordance with the best available scientific evidence and 
relevant international standards.
Table 7.1 Directive 2009/30/EC of the European Parliament (paragraph 11)
In August 2010, EU Energy Commissioner Gunther Oettinger announced the following 3 measures 
regarding biofuel sustainability:
•	 ‘Sustainable biofuel certificates’ – governments, industry and NGOs are encouraged to 
establish “voluntary schemes”. In order for the schemes to be recognised by the European 
Commision, they must be independently audited. 
•	 ‘Protecting untouched nature’ – the fuels must not be made from raw materials from 
tropical forests or recently deforested areas, drained peatlands, wetlands. For example, the 
Commission said the conversion of a forest to a palm oil plantation would not meet its 
sustainability criteria. 
•	 ‘Promote only biofuels with high greenhouse gas savings’ – biofuels have to deliver savings of 
at least 35% compared with fossil fuels, rising to 50% in 2017 and to 60% by 2018. 
In the UK, the RTFO (Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation) specifies that 80% of biofuel (biodiesel 
and bioethanol) feedstocks should meet “environmental sustainab1ility standards” in the year 2010/11. 
The RTFO’s “Sustainable Biofuel Meta-Standard” specifies certain environmental sustainability criteria 
under the following principles:
Principle 1 Carbon Conservation: Biomass production will not destry or damage large above or below 
ground carbon stocks

Environmental aspects
Principle 2 Biodiversity Conservation: Biomass production will not lead to the destruction or damage of 
high biodiversity areas
Principle 3 Soil Conservation: Biomass production does not lead to soil degradation
Principle 4 Sustainable Water Use: Biomass production does not lead to the contamination or depletion 
of water sources
Principle 5 Air Quality: Biomass production does not lead to air pollution
--
The Meta-Standard also encompasses the following social principles:
--
Biomass production does not adversely affect workers rights and working relationships
--
Biomass production does not adversely affect existing land rights and community relations
However, there are currently limitations on the certification of sustainability standards for several 
feedstock/country combinations. For example, in the first 2010/11 RTFO reporting period, only 23% 
of biofuels in the UK met an environmental standard, compared to a target of 80% (Renewable Fuel 
Agency, August 2010). 
Certified sustainable feedstocks will hopefully become more available in the future over time (as standards 
develop in response RTFO-led demand and general increasing concern about the sustainability of 
agricultural commodities). 
Waste biomass and lignocellulosic materials – the second-generation feedstocks – represent the most 
sustainable and ethically acceptable sources for future bioethanol production. They also offer the greater 
cost reductions compared with starch and sugar crops for bioethanol (www.iea.org). The use of degraded/
contaminated land for growth of energy crops (eg. switchgrass) for bioethanol biomass is particularly 
attractive in this regard and has been highlighted in the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC. 
The use of E85 derived from switchgrass grown on abandoned/marginal cropland has even been deemed 
to be “carbon negative” whilst cellulosic ethanol in general leads to further GHG emissions compared 
with first generation feedstocks.(Yan et al, 2010). 
7.2	
Energy and water conservation
The bioethanol industrial sector requires to be proactive on environmental issues, from both sociological 
(public perspectives) and regulatory (governmental) viewpoints (Delano, Kohl and Roddy, 2009). 
Particular issues relate to water and energy conservation and effective treatments of solid and liquid 
residues.

Environmental aspects
In addition to potentially deleterious impacts on food security, bioethanol production in certain areas 
of the world may compete with supplies of fresh water. For example, the US Department of Energy has 
estimated that for corn ethanol, 830L of fresh water is needed to produce 2.7 kg of corn from which 1L 
of bioethanol is produced.
Modern plants pay special attention to the principal energy and water consuming activities and 
employment of technologies to facilitate their reduction. Examples include:
--
Biological waste treatment (eg. anaerobic digestion for biogas)
--
Membrane filtration and reverse osmosis (for water recycling and removal of organics)
--
Water re-use (eg. wastewater/condensate treatments to provide makeup water for fermentation)
--
Hot water recovery systems (eg. from still condensers)
--
Contaminated air emission controls (to reduce hazardous air pollutants)
--
Electricity self-sufficiency (eg. combustion of residues and biogas)
According to a survey covering the 2001–2006 period (compiled by Argonne National Laboratories*, 
www.anl.gov) US bioethanol plants were able to reduce their water consumption by 26.6%, their use of 
electricity by 15.7%, and their total use of energy by 21.8%. 
* A U.S. Department of Energy laboratory managed by University of Chicago Argonne, LLC.

Bioethanol
101 
Environmental aspects
Comprehensive life-cycle analyses are required to appraise the operations and environmental management 
of bioethanol plants. A key facet of biofuels versus fossil fuels centres on energetic favourability, and 
bioethanol production and consumption should be characterised by a positive energy balance (see  
section 1.3). 
7.3	
Co-products: generation and utilisation
The bioethanol industry generates a variety of so-called co-products (residues) during the processing 
of feedstock to ethanol (e.g. CO2, fusel oils, cereal residues, bagasse, stillage, spent yeast etc). The main 
co-products from cereal (maize) bioethanol production are DDGS (distillers’ dried grains with solubles) 
and DWG (distillers wet grains). In the US ~65% of maize residues for animal feed is DDGS and 35% 
is DWG. These products (in USA) are mainly used as components (up to 40%) in livestock feed (beef 
and dairy cattle, ~85% of consumption); but can also be incorporated in feeds for non-ruminants such 
as poultry (~5%) and swine (~10%). Distillers’ dried grains without solubles may also be employed as 
animal feed, but such products are lower in protein that DDGS (Pilgrim, 2009; Corrigan and Mass, 2009). 
The nutritional composition of typical DDGS from a dry-grind bioethanol production process are 
summarized in Table 7.31.

Regarding another major co-product from bioethanol production plants, namely carbon dioxide, may 
be “scrubbed” (further purified) prior to liquefaction and sold for carbonated beverages or for use in 
greenhouses. Large-scale bioethanol facilities (eg. ADM, Decatur, USA) may employ carbon sequestration 
technology to mitigate CO2 emissions. This involves injection of CO2 into deep-drilled porous sandstone. 
Another application involves utilisation of fermentation-derived CO2 in photosynthetic microalgal 
bioreactors for biodiesel production. Development of CO2 sequestration technologies can be encouraged 
either by taxing C-pollution, or positive trading of C-credits (eg. providing a market value for CO2). 
7.4	
Effluent treatment and control
Wastewaters from bioethanol plants with high biological oxygen demands (BOD) cannot be discharged 
directly into watercourses due to detrimental impacts on aquatic flora and fauna. 
BOD tests measure the concentration of biodegradable organic matter in a sample of water and 
gauges water quality, or its polluting “power”. COD is chemical oxygen demand and measures all the 
organic compounds in a water sample that can be oxidised to form CO2 (expressed as mg/L) which 
indicates the mass of oxygen consumed per litre of water.

Environmental aspects
Both BOD and COD values for distillery wastewaters are required by local authorities and can be used 
to inform the design of discharge treatment facilities. Stillage (residue from distilling operations) is 
particularly polluting due to its: high BOD; dissolved solids content (5–10%); low pH (being acidic in 
nature). Evaporation of thin stillage concentrates it to a syrupy thick stillage that can be added to spent 
grains (as in DDGS) to augment protein content of animal feed. Evaporator condensate from this process 
is still high in BOD and requires further treatment, and together with other wastewater streams can be 
treated using biological and membrane systems. A detailed description of the science and technology 
of such systems is outwith the scope of this book, but AD processes for bioethanol wastewaters is 
summarised in Fig 7.5.
Biological wastewater treatment encompasses both aerobic and anaerobic microbiological strategies to 
reduce pollution. The latter process, anaerobic digestion (AD), also provides energy in the form of biogas 
(methane). For example, as well as reducing the soluble COD by >90% AD systems can also produce 
0.35m3 CH4/kg soluble COD. Conventional slurry AD systems can take a significant amount of solids 
but are slow to operate (taking days or weeks). Additionally, 1/3 of original solids left as digestate (or 
biosolids) need to be disposed off. High-rate systems operate faster (hours and days) and require that 
suspended solids concentrations are <1000mg/l. These produce smaller amounts of biosolids.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The resultant biogas can be used as follows:
•	 Heating of anaerobic digester, useful in small week influent systems, i.e. operating on spent 
lees and steep water
•	 Direct firing in existing boiler, modifications to burner required.
•	 Reciprocating gas engine, robust and site maintainable technology, production of electricity 
and heat
•	 Support fuel for biomass boiler
•	 Gas Turbine, external maintenance support generally required, electricity and useful heat in 
exhaust gases
Biogas may have relatively high concentrations of H2S, hydrogen sulphide, which at levels >1% is toxic, 
corrosive and malodorous. H2S levels can be controlled using iron sponge (which forms stable iron 
sulphide) or by chemically scrubbing with NaOH. Biological desulphurication treatments are also 
possible.

Depending on the receiving waters, more extensive treatments following anaerobic digestion may be 
required, particularly to control ammoniacal nitrogen which is toxic to aquatic life. For example, aerobic 
bacterial nitrification to convert ammonia to nitrite, followed by further oxidation to nitrate.

Global trends and issues
In 2008, global production of liquid biofuels (bioethanol and biodiesel) was ~87 gigalitres which equates 
to almost the total volume of liquid fuel consumed by Germany that year (Sommerville et al, 2010). 
Looking to the future, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) have forecast that renewable 
fuels may account for 8.5% of global energy use by 2030. Worldwide bioethanol production, research 
and development continues apace, with predictions (eg. Walter et al, 2008) of this particular biofuel 
replacing 20% of gasoline usage by 2030 (total 566 Gl). Current production is still heavily dominated 
by US and Brazilian bioethanol from maize and sugarcane, respectively, but Asian bioethanol is growing 
rapidly. However, increased production from starch and sugar feedstocks is unsustainable due to socio-
economic factors including public awareness on issues such as food-to-fuel, the rising cost of cereals 
and diminishing biodiversity.

Future prospects for Bioethanol
The International Energy Agency (IEA) have stated that starch and sugar beet crops have limited ability 
to act as oil substitutes and climate change mitigators (www.iea.org and Sims et al, 2008). Additionally, 
it may be argued (with the exception of sugar cane processes in Brazil) that 1st-generation bioethanol is 
faced with severe economic and environmental constraints, including:
--
contribution to higher food prices (by competing with food crops)
--
production is not cost-effective (without government subsidies)
--
limited GHG reduction benefits 
--
dubious sustainability criteria
--
potential negative impacts on biodiversity
--
competition for scarce water resources
It is therefore apparent that non-food/feed biomass (especially lignocellulosic residues and biowatses) 
needs to be exploited further to meet future rising global demand for fuel alcohol (eg. Royal Society 
of Chemistry, 2007; Sommerville et al, 2010; Pilgrim and Wright, 2009). Full industrial exploitation of 
cellulose-to-ethanol conversion technologies that are economically and energetically feasible are now a 
reality following successful operation of pilot scale/demonstration facilities, especially in the US – for 
example, Abengoa Bioenergy Biomass (Kansas); Ceres Inc (Califronia); BBI BioVentures (Colorado); 
Coskata (Florida); Frontier Renewable Resources (Michigan); Poet (Iowa and South Dakota); Range 
Fuels (Georgia); Verenium (Louisiana). Recent further developments in lignocellulosic biomass pre-
treatment and fermentation will bring second generation bioethanol processes closer to commercial 
reality on a global scale (see http://biofuels.abc-energy.at/demoplants; Burkheisser, 2009). European 
industrial initiatives include Inbicon (Denmark); BioGasol (Denmark); Abengoa (Spain); TMO (UK and 
The Netherlands). Several European Commission funded collaborative research projects are focusing 
on novel bioprocesses for cellulose-to-ethanol conversions (see www.biofuelstp.eu/cell_ethanol/html). 
Displacing 20% of gasoline by 2030 will necessitate significant increases in volumetric bioethanol 
production from lignocellulosic materials, as well as fostering biofuel technologies in developing countries 
and enhancing international biotrade. In the future, bioethanol plants that use cereal starch or sugar 
can be adapted to biorefineries that process the entire biomass, including lignocellulosic residues, by 
integrating both first and second generation ethanol technologies. Table 8.1 summarises projected (until 
the year 2020) bioethanol production from 1st and 2nd generation biomass feedstocks in different countries. 
The economic impact of increased bioethanol from lignocellulose is apparent from the US where this 
market is expected to grow from 125M Euros in 2010 to 13,000M Euros in 2020.

Table 8.1 Projected bioethanol production from 1st and 2nd generation feedstocks

[Information from Renewable Fuels Association (RFA); US Department of Energy; www.i-sis.org.uk/BiofuelRepublicBrazil.php;  
Ethanol Producer Magazine and Chicago Board of Trade; USDA ERS (2008)]
Fig 8.1 provides some projected data for the year 2022 for bioethanol production from US maize (ultising 
both starch and lignocellulosic components). Data in Fig 8.1 have assumed that: corn residues can be 
effectively bioprocessed to ethanol; 50% stover can be collected; sugar-to-ethanol is close to theoretical 
conversion; and 25billion bushel corn crop (300 bushels/acre) can be harvested. It also compares whole 
corn ethanol with potential yields obtainable from energy crops.
Abbas (2010) has estimated that to replace all US transportation fuels with ethanol, over 800billion litres 
would be required and if this was to come from first-generation feedstocks (maize) then this would 
necessitate 500million acres of cultivable land. As this currently stands at 473 million acres, it is apparent 
that the future lies with second-generation feedstocks, and especially lignocellulosic wastes and energy 
crops. The Biotechnology Industry Organisation (BIO) in the US have predicted that cellulosic ethanol 
will reach “technology maturity” beyond 2020. Projecting even further ahead, it has been estimated that 
US and world cellulosic bioethanol production could reach 178 and 203 Gl, respectively, by 2030 (US 
Department of Energy and International Energy Authority).

Future prospects for Bioethanol
Somerville (2010) and his colleagues at the University of California at Berkeley have recently determined 
that if sugar cane bagasse-to-ethanol conversion technologies become more readily available, Brazil 
could potentially produce up to 750billion litres of bioethanol (by comparison current first-generation 
Brazilian sugar cane ethanol production is ~30billion litres). This represents a substantial proportion of 
global transportation fuels 
In the US, it has been predicted that cultivating energy crops such as Miscanthus on less than half of 
the land currently under the Conservation Reserve Program would be sufficient to meet the 136billion 
litres of biofuels mandated in the US by 2022. 
8.2	
Future challenges
It is clear that bioethanol offers great benefits for safeguarding the environment, boosting the rural 
economy and ensuring fuel security. Nevertheless, there are significant scientific, technological, 
sociological and political challenges facing future bioethanol production. Increasing ethanol’s worldwide 
share of gasoline consumption to ~20% by 2030 will require industrialisation of second-generation 
(cellulosic) technologies and the challenges to be faced in meeting such targets have been summarised in 
Table 8.2. Several of these challenges are being overcome and the pending implementation of improved 
lignocellulose-to-ethanol technologies will provide opportunities to use new biofuel feedstocks that reach 
beyond current crops – and avoid encroachment of agricultural land that is currently used for food.

*Major advances in metabolic engineering of yeast cells have been made in recent years, particularly with regard to conferring the 
following properties on S. cerevisiae for bioethanol (and potentially also biobutanol) production:
•	 Expressing xylose (& arabinose) fermenting enzymes
•	 Expressing amylolytic & cellulolytic enzymes
•	 Reduced glucose-repression
•	 Reduced glycerol, xylitol & arabitol biosynthesis
•	 Acetic acid as electron acceptor (no glycerol, more ethanol – Medina et al, 2010)
•	 Stress & inhibitor tolerance (Alper et al, 2006; Nevoigt, 2008)
•	 Metabolic engineering for n-butanol fermentation (Steen et al, 2008)
Nevertheless, although such engineered strains perform well under laboratory conditions, successful 
scale-up to more stressful industrial conditions is fraught with difficulties, and further research is required 
regarding development of robust yeasts that can survive and thrive in large-scale fermenters.

Major challenges in efficiently converting lignocellulose to ethanol are being addressed globally by 
intensive research in academia and industry. In Europe, the EBTP (European Biofuels Technology 
Platform) is engaging with industrialists, researchers and policy makers to map out a strategic research 
agenda for deployment of sustainable biofuels in the EU (www.biofuelstp.eu). Recent EU Directives 
(Renewable Energy Directive 2009/28/EC) have specifically stipulated the usage of non-food cellulosic 
and lignocellulosic material for biofuel production and this awaits Member State Implementation into 
national legislation by December 2010. It is apparent that global production of cellulosic ethanol will 
not become fully commercialised without governmental support.
In addition to considering large-scale industrial bioethanol production, the future may also 
incorporate small-scale production units, including “community bioferineries” and even “do-it-yourself” 
micro-refinery units. An example of the latter is the E-Fuel 100 Microfueler launched in the US by 
E-Fuel Corp in 2008. Such portable devices require yeast and a fermentable feedstock (sugar, waste 
beer, cellulosic waste) and following fermentation, ethanol is produced using solid-state distillation 
technology (see www.efuel100.com and Baker, 2010). In the US, federal law permits individuals to 
produce and use E100 in their own vehicles up to 10,000 gal per year.
In addition to scientific and technological challenges facing future bioethanol production, there are also 
important geo-political and ethical challenges to be overcome. Regarding the former, potential solutions 
lie in fostering production in developing countries and enhancing international ethanol trade.

Future prospects for Bioethanol
The following represent the most important ethical challenges raised by increasing future bioethanol 
production:
•	 Economics (affordability)
•	 Food-to-fuel (changes in agricultural land use) 
•	 Genetic engineering (employment of GM-feedstocks)
•	 Local environment (localisation/building of new biorefineries; demands on fresh water)
•	 Bio-business (potential monopolisation of bio-resources or patents)
The land use issue is a controversial one, and there is widespread misconception that the huge Brazilian 
bioethanol industry is leading to Amazonian rainforest destruction. However, the vast majority of 
Brazilian cultivation of sugarcane (and the bioethanol distilleries) are located in Sao Paulo state, using 
degraded pasture land. Therefore, sugar cane-derived ethanol in Brazil is not linked to deforestation and 
represents the most sustainable and perhaps the most ethical biofuel currently being produced. Globally, 
biofuels account for a small proportion (<3%) of total cultivated land (USDA-ERS, 2008). 
Concerning the impacts of biofuels on human food security, and food-to-fuel ethics, a recent World 
Bank report ‘Placing the 2006/08 Commodity Price Boom in Perspective’ (see Biofuel and Industrial 
News Issue 39 – 19 Aug 2010) concluded that the impact of biofuels on food prices was not as large as 
initially thought. 
Nevertheless, emerging second-generation bioethanol (especially from biowastes) may be regarded 
as being the most ethically acceptable. Nowadays, biofuels have a bad press, meaning that scientists, 
industrialists and policy makers need to more clearly communicate benefits of renewable transport 
fuels, and openly discuss ethical issues, to wider audiences (including environmental pressure groups).
