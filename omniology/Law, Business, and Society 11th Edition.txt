v
Broadly, our adjustments for this eleventh edition were designed to refresh the book and 
achieve increased reader interest, but more specifically this edition is directed to the 
 nation’s ongoing debate about how much government we need in our lives, particularly in 
our business lives. Although the general structure and philosophy of the book are un-
changed, we have made significant revisions.
WHAT’S NEW
Chapter 1, a survey of the economic continuum from capitalism to collectivism and their 
various mutations, has been thoroughly rewritten and updated to reflect the striking eco-
nomic developments of recent years in the United States and around the world.
 
Chapter 1 includes discussions of the subprime mortgage fallout and the law’s response, 
as well as the critics’ views of big banks and their treatment as being “too big to fail.” 
 Recent Wall Street alleged abuses are also discussed, and new data on the wealth gap, 
poverty, and overall quality of life in the United States are offered. China’s ongoing bal-
ance between the free market and state oversight is also explored. 
 
Chapter 2 explores the recent financial crisis as an ethics scandal and legal challenge. 
Various new vignettes, anecdotes, questions, and other features aid this exploration. 
 
Chapter 3 offers a critical view of expanding corporate power addressing tax avoidance, 
state incentives, and politics. Corporate social responsibility issues such as guns and gun 
sales are explored, along with the Toyota sudden acceleration case, and fast-food labor 
 issues, which are explored from a legal perspective in subsequent chapters as well. 
 
Chapter 4 includes a discussion of the Rutgers University cyberbullying case and ques-
tions that will elicit student discussion on the controversial sentence, as well as antibully-
ing legislation. “Stand your ground,” the George Zimmerman trial for the killing of 
Trayvon Martin, and the “Castle Doctrine” are the subject of a Practicing Ethics box. Crit-
ics’ views of the Roberts Court are updated, along with discussion of the Walmart class 
action aftermath, firms’ billing practices, and access to justice. Service of process through 
social media and the use of small claims to sue big corporations is also explored, along 
with an updated look at the Japanese practice of law.
 
Chapter 5’s discussion of the ongoing Federalism debate is updated, and its analysis of 
free speech has been simplified and clarified, and the takings debate is revisited. Along 
with a new search and seizure case discussion, changes in the law governing gay and les-
bian rights, including marriage, are discussed. 
 
Chapter 6 offers updates on the Facebook ownership and Huffington Post blogger pay dis-
putes, a clarified example of unjust enrichment, and questions on recent cases such as the 
 Modern Family cast’s contract dispute. Also covered are the recent claims against Lance Arm-
strong by his former sponsors following his television admissions of wrongdoing. Further, the 
 Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA) and websites’ terms of sale are added subjects. 
Preface

vi  Preface
 
Chapter 7 includes updates and an accompanying question regarding the Walmart tram-
pling death for the opening Practicing Ethics section, as well as an update on the battery 
charge against a Valdosta State University professor for shutting a laptop on a student’s 
fingers. A discussion of the 2014 jury verdict in a defamation lawsuit stemming from Yelp 
postings, and a 2013 negligence case involving an assault in a bowling alley parking lot 
have also been added. The closure of Blitz, the red gasoline can maker, is discussed to 
raise the larger question of whether litigation or corporate greed are to blame for the pres-
sures facing high-risk businesses. The recent legal issues raised by video game makers’ 
use of college football players’ images are discussed in light of recent developments. The 
Toyota saga as it extends to electric throttle systems is also discussed.
 
Chapter 8 explores the 2012 U.S. Supreme Court decision in National Federation of 
Independent Business v. Sebelius, and its view of the commerce clause versus taxation 
power of the U.S. Congress. A new case on indecency is included. TARP and Dodd–Frank 
developments are reviewed. 
 
Chapter 9 includes discussion of “distorporations,” as well as discussions of the SEC’s 
recent social media guidance on Regulation FD, its approach to settlements, its lift on the 
ban to advertise for unregistered securities, and new approach to settlements. Recent 
white-collar criminal cases against SAC and Goldman Sachs’ Rajat Gupta are also dis-
cussed, as is Delaware’s attempt to gain exclusive jurisdiction over incorporation. 
 
Chapter 10 includes a recent Robinson–Patman case: The intersection between antitrust 
and intellectual property is further explored and clarified.
 
Chapter 11 updates antitrust developments with Apple, Google, and Microsoft and pro-
vides an overview of recent legal scrutiny applied to mergers.
 
Chapter 12’s drug testing sections are reorganized for clarity and flow, and a new “pri-
vacy at work” case highlights personal privacy in the small, private-sector workplace. Re-
cent legal developments are highlighted, such as updated discussions on the 2010 Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act, the EEOC 2012 criminal background check guide-
lines, and a recent case raising questions on the utility of such pre-employment measures 
in preventing workplace violence, a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court decision impacting the 
FMLA rights of state workers, updated examples including a new example of constructive 
discharge, as well as more recent surveys and statistics. 
 
Chapter 13 includes the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent decisions impacting retaliation 
and employers’ affirmative defense for sexual harassment, which is, in turn, highlighted by 
a 2014 federal case. An updated discussion on sexual-orientation discrimination protec-
tions that includes the Spring 2014 social-media-fueled, successful campaign to oust a 
CEO who had contributed to an anti-gay marriage political group, as well as the EEOC’s 
GINA Enforcement Guidance, is offered. Updates on the cases against A&F found in the 
opening Practicing Ethics discussion, as well as updated survey results and statistics, are 
offered. The discussion of the EEOC’s “right to sue” letters is clarified as well. 
 
Chapter 14’s discussion of unfair labor practices in management is reorganized to in-
clude a fuller discussion of recent applications of the NLRA, to, for example, at-will em-
ployment clauses, dress codes, and social media postings. The good-faith bargaining 
explanation has been clarified and updated, as well as the Boeing dispute. 
 
Chapter 15 offers a discussion of the consumer protection issues associated with for-
profit schools. Legal and ethical issues raised by payday loans operations are also  explored. 

Preface  vii
The ongoing struggles at the governing agencies such as FDA, CFPB, and CPSC are also 
discussed.
 
Chapter 16 offers an updated discussion of free speech, encompassing social media and 
Internet service providers. Emerging issues of effective regulation of multinational enter-
prises are discussed, as well as the SEC’s extraterritorial powers under the Dodd–Frank 
Act. Updates on accounting standards, including the status of the convergence project be-
tween IFRS and GAAP and the PCAOB on the global stage, are also included. 
 
Chapter 17 sheds light on the complexity of environmental issues through current ex-
amples, such as the impact of burning of forests in Indonesia to accommodate palm oil 
plantations on air pollution levels in Singapore and southern Malaysia. Cap-and-trade pro-
grams, tax incentives, “green growth” examples, and updated statistics and enforcement 
settlements are also discussed. 
 
Chapter 18 updates include cybersecurity, the digital divide, the FCC’s recent rules on 
net neutrality, legal issues stemming from “revenge porn” websites, price discrimination, 
cross-device tracking, market response to the use of copyrighted material, top-level  domain 
name sales (TLDS) as an ethical issue, and the effort to make state sales tax uniform to 
support interstate, online sales transactions.
OVERVIEW
This text is directed to courses at both the upper-division undergraduate and masters levels 
in the legal environment of business, government and business, and business and society. 
Authors of textbooks in these areas often rely on a single discipline (for example, law, 
economics, or management) as the foundation for their efforts. In this text we take an inter-
disciplinary approach, using elements of law, political economy, international business, 
ethics, social responsibility, and management. This large task necessarily requires certain 
trade-offs, but we hope the product will more accurately capture the fullness of the busi-
ness environment.
 
Our primary goal is to produce an interesting, provocative reading experience. Naturally, 
accuracy and reasonable comprehensiveness cannot be  sacrificed. Our feeling, however, is 
that a law text can be both intellectually and emotionally engaging without sacrificing 
substantive ends. To meet our objective we have presented the bulk of the book in the 
form of contemporary legal and ethical conflicts emerging from  today’s news. We have 
provided scholarly results, surveys, polls, data, anecdotes, and other specific details that 
lend credibility, immediacy, and interest to the reading  experience.
 
The book is divided into five units, as follows:
 
Unit I—Business and Society. We do not begin with the law. Rather, in Chapter 1 
(Capitalism and the Role of Government), Chapter 2 (Business Ethics), and Chapter 3 (The 
Corporation and Public Policy: Expanding Responsibilities), we describe some of the eco-
nomic and social forces that shape our legal system.
 
The goals of Unit I are to (a) enhance student awareness of the many societal influences 
on business, (b) establish the business context from which government regulation arose, 
and (c) explore the roles of the free market, government intervention, and individual and 
corporate ethics in shaping business behavior.

viii  Preface
 
The student must understand not merely the law but the law in context. What forces 
have provoked government intervention in business? What alternatives to our current 
“mixed economy” might prove healthy? These considerations help the students respond to 
one of the critical questions of the day: To what extent, if any, should we regulate  business?
 
Unit II—Introduction to Law. Chapter 4 (The American Legal System) and Chapter 5 
(Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights) survey the foundations of our legal system. 
Here we set out the “nuts and bolts” of law, combining cases and narrative. Then with 
Chapter 6 (Contracts) and Chapter 7 (Business Torts and Product Liability), we examine 
the foundations of business law.
 
Unit III—Trade Regulation and Antitrust. Chapter 8 (Government Regulation of 
Business) raises the book’s central policy inquiry: When should the government intervene 
in business practice? Chapter 9 (Business Organizations and Securities Regulation), Chap-
ter 10 (Antitrust Law—Restraints of Trade), and Chapter 11 (Antitrust Law— Monopolies 
and Mergers) survey the core of government oversight of business.
 
Unit IV—Employer–Employee Relations. Chapter 12 (Employment Law I: Employee 
Rights), Chapter 13 (Employment Law II: Discrimination), and Chapter 14 (Employment 
Law III: Labor–Management Relations) are intended not only to survey the law in those 
areas, but also to introduce some of the sensitive and provocative social issues that have 
led to today’s extensive government intervention in the employment relationship.
 
Unit V—Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations. Two of the closing 
chapters of this book—Chapter 15 (Consumer Protection) and Chapter 17 (Environmental 
Protection)—emphasize the dramatic expansion of the public’s demands for socially re-
sponsible conduct in business. Chapter 16 (International Ethics and Law) provides an 
overview of the legal and ethical issues emerging from global business practice, and Chap-
ter 18 (Internet Law and Ethics) surveys some cyberlaw and ethics problems.
ACCREDITATION
Our text conforms to Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) 
International accreditation standards.
 
Two chapters are devoted exclusively to ethics, and ethics themes emerge throughout 
the book. The chapter on employment discrimination should be quite helpful in aiding 
students’ understanding of diversity issues.
 
Furthermore, as required by the rapidly changing nature of commerce and as recom-
mended by the AACSB, the text devotes extensive attention to legal and ethical issues 
arising from international business. Various topics throughout the text (for example, com-
parative economic systems, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and global pollution) afford 
the student a sense of the worldwide implications of American business practice, and 
Chapter 16 is entirely devoted to international themes.
PHILOSOPHY
As noted, our primary goal is to provoke student thought. To that end, we place heavy 
emphasis on analysis. We consider the questions we ask more important than the answers 
to those questions. We introduce the student to existing policy in the various substantive 

areas, to encourage understanding and retention, as well as careful thought about the 
desirability of those policies.
 
Our book takes a strong public policy orientation. Attention in Unit I to political 
economy and ethics is a necessary foundation on which the student can build a logical 
understanding of the regulatory process. Thereafter, those business and society themes 
persist throughout the book. In virtually every chapter, we look beyond the law itself to 
other social and environmental forces. For example, in the antitrust chapters economic 
philosophy is of great importance. Antitrust is explored as a matter of national social 
policy. We argue that antitrust has a good deal to do with the direction of American life 
generally. Law is at the heart of the fair employment practices section, but we also pre-
sent material from management, sociology, history, and popular culture to treat fair em-
ployment as an issue of public policy rather than as a series of narrower technical legal 
disputes. These multidimensional approaches characterize most chapters as we attempt 
to examine the various topics as a whole and in context. At the same time, the law 
 remains the core of the book.
KEY FEATURES/DEPARTURES
Approximately 150 “boxes” and ethics vignettes place the law in a practical context and 
offer many provocative opportunities for discussion.
 
Ethics and social responsibility are at the heart of the text rather than an afterthought to 
meet accreditation standards.
 
International issues receive extensive attention.
 
Law cases are long enough to clearly express the essence of the decision while chal-
lenging the reader’s intellect.
 
The law is studied in the economic, social, and political context from which it springs.
 
Critics of business values and the American legal system receive attention.
 
Approximately 200 selected websites, including suggested online videos, appear in this 
edition, and each chapter includes at least one Internet Exercise.
 
Perhaps the key pedagogical tactic in the book is the emphasis on questions rather than 
on answers.
INSTRUCTOR’S MANUAL
A package of supplementary materials is included in the instructor’s manual. Those mate-
rials include (1) chapter outlines, (2) general advice regarding the goals and purposes of 
the chapters, (3) summaries of the law cases, (4) answers for the questions raised in the 
text, and (5) a test bank.
TEST BANK
Instructors can test students using a vast bank of test questions divided by chapter.

Capitalism and the 
 Role of Government
After completing this chapter, students will be able to:
1. Describe capitalism and its relationship to individual rights.
2. Compare and contrast capitalism and collectivism.
3. Differentiate between communism and socialism as collectivist philosophies.
4. Evaluate arguments regarding government’s proper role in the global, technology-based economy.
5. Describe the primary characteristics of a “mixed economy.”
6. Analyze the impact of capitalism on equality, fairness, and community in American and 
global society.
7. Discuss the theory and practice of privatization.
8. Discuss the current state of capitalism in China and Russia.
9. Describe the income and wealth gaps in America.
Part One—Introduction
Are you a capitalist? If so, what role, if any, should the law play in 
your business life? How much government does America need? 
These themes, examining the relationship between government and 
business in America, are the core of this text. Since the fall of the Soviet Union and the 
general decline of communist influence, free market reasoning has dominated worldwide 
economic discourse. Indeed, noted theorist Francis Fukuyama argued that capitalism and 
Western democracy had so thoroughly proven their worth that the capitalism/collectivism 
debate was over.1 Democracy and markets, Fukuyama claimed, were so clearly triumphant 
that no new forms of civilization are likely to emerge. Thus, he said, we are at the end of 
history. Events, however, have challenged Fukuyama’s bold thesis. The Great Recession, 
including the subprime mortgage crisis, the stunning power of the Wall Street banks, and 
the continuing turmoil of globalization have raised grave doubts about the economic

r eliability of capitalism. Likewise, government’s failure to send corrupt bankers off to jail, 
rampant greed, and the Occupy Wall Street movement have magnified longstanding doubts 
about the morality of capitalism.
Capitalism Challenged: Economics
We will briefly examine the economic and moral turmoil of contemporary American capi-
talism, but more detail on most of these topics will be provided in subsequent chapters.
The Great Recession
In late 2008, America’s financial markets seemed near collapse. Lending had essentially 
frozen. A powerful Wall Street bank, Lehman Brothers, went broke while Bear Stearns 
and Merrill Lynch, also Wall Street titans, faced failure and were sold. American and 
global financial markets panicked and appeared unable to correct themselves. Fearing a 
Great Depression as occurred in the 1930s, the federal government had, during both the 
George W. Bush and Barack Obama administrations, essentially flooded the market with 
cash, took on much of the debt held by endangered banks, and, through its Troubled Asset 
Relief Program (TARP), bailed out failing giants such as Goldman Sachs, General Motors, 
and Chrysler: companies that were deemed “too big to fail.” Additional stimulus measures 
included tax reductions, bond sales, infrastructure and “green” projects, and enhanced un-
employment benefits. Depending on how the word stimulus is defined, government expen-
ditures to prop up the endangered economy ranged from perhaps $1.7 trillion2 to $4.7 
trillion3 or more. Most of the TARP money has been repaid, but economists differ both on 
the need for the stimulus efforts and on their success.
Subprime Mortgages
The financial community’s near collapse had been most directly ig-
nited by the subprime mortgage crisis; a situation in which the na-
tion’s housing bubble burst and millions of Americans were no 
longer able to pay their home mortgages. Instead of continuing their 
sometimes meteoric rise in value, those homes had plunged in price and much of the total 
real estate market had essentially imploded. The resulting mountain of bad debt could not 
be managed by the American financial institutions that were holding it; fear paralyzed the 
lending markets, and the government felt obliged to step in to prevent a greater financial 
tragedy. Whereas greed and inept management were instrumental in the subprime debacle, 
the role of financial fraud remains unclear. Some big civil penalties have been imposed, 
and criminal investigations undertaken.

Big Banks
America’s biggest banks, including the five largest—JPMorgan Chase, 
Bank of America, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs—were 
deemed “too big to fail” during the subprime mortgage crisis, and they 
remain a grave threat should the economy falter again. In 2001, 
The nation’s housing bubble 
burst.
America’s biggest banks were 
deemed “too big to fail.”

4  Unit One  Business and Society
 the  assets of the five biggest American banks totaled about 25 percent of all U.S. bank assets 
whereas today that number exceeds 50 percent.4 The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer Protection Act (see Chapter 8) includes provisions designed to reduce the likeli-
hood of big bank failures, but implementation of the new law has been troubled. Federal regu-
lators in 2013 proposed requiring the biggest banks to increase their capital on hand 
substantially to guard against unexpected losses and reduce the risk to the American economy. 
Globalization
Globalization represents the international flowering of capitalism; the power of free mar-
kets has been embraced, enthusiastically or reluctantly, almost everywhere on Earth. That 
power raised new threats, of course, including the spread of America’s corporate influence 
and values around the globe (see Chapter 3). Now, however, globalization seems to be 
entering a new phase. In a “hyper-connected,” “flat” world, we are all linked together in an 
economic and cultural intimacy scarcely imaginable a few decades back, but new evidence 
suggests that a period of “de-globalization” may be emerging. International trade and 
money flows are slowing or actually declining.5 Globalization has succeeded in raising 
wages significantly in emerging powers such as China and India. As a result, manufactur-
ing jobs are returning to America in surprising numbers. Of course, globalization is not 
vanishing, but its economic advantages are shifting and new nationalistic urges threaten to 
slow the pace of global linkages. 
Capitalism Challenged: Morality
Beyond fears about capitalism’s economic performance, particularly its instability and 
harshness, critics point to capitalism’s indecencies. 
Wall Street Abuses
Certainly many Americans are puzzled, if not angered, by the gov-
ernment’s inability to criminally punish the big banks and bankers 
who profited so handsomely in the events that led to the nation’s 
economic collapse and who, in several cases, had to be bailed out 
with public money following the collapse. (For more, see Chap-
ter 2.) Those same bankers have not only escaped jail, but they con-
tinue to earn stunning sums of money. Responding, however, to harsh publicity, among 
other factors, some of the big banks have either cut or curbed executive pay. In 2013, at 
Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, compensation costs were falling and Morgan’s 
high-profile CEO, Jamie Dimon, took a 2012 pay cut of 50 percent, down to $11.5 million. 
The cut, at least in part, served as a signal to regulators and investors that the board of di-
rectors was in charge following a troubled year that included a $6 billion trading loss.6 
Greed
CEO salaries for the top 200 U.S. corporations (not limited to bankers) rose 16 percent in 2012. 
Among those top 200 CEOs, the average income was 273 times the income of the average 
worker—up from a 20 to 1 ratio in 1965.7 The average CEO’s daily salary at those 200 biggest

banks and bankers.

Chapter One  Capitalism and the Role of Government  5
firms now exceeds the average annual salary of their workers.8 Actual salaries have often re-
mained limited or flat in recent years, but stock-based pay has fueled an overall rise.
 
Congress showed its concern about CEO pay in a Dodd-Frank provision requiring the 
Securities and Exchange Commission to give shareholders a “say on pay” by writing new 
rules requiring periodic shareholder voting on executive compensation. At this writing, 
“say on pay” seems to have encouraged attention to CEO pay, but a shareholder backlash 
has not yet materialized.9
 
Anger with corporate greed and perceived abuse of power led to a grassroots global pro-
test movement labeled Occupy Wall Street. Hundreds of peaceful protesters (mostly young, 
often college-educated and jobless) camped in New York’s financial district in 
late 2011 to “restore democracy” while denouncing the “greed” and “corruption” 
of the “upper 1 percent.” The movement then spread to many other American cit-
ies and around the globe. Occupy Wall Street gained enormous publicity as a leftist assault 
on corporate America and the wealthy, but the movement sputtered—perhaps for want of a 
clear, coherent message. Occupy Wall Street continues its efforts, but at least for the pre-
sent, the attention of the broader American public has been lost. (See occupy.org.)

Questions
1. Thomas Hoenig, a member of the board of directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, observed: “[Americans] realize that more must be done to address a threat 
that remains increasingly a part of our economy: financial institutions that are ‘too big 
to fail.’”10 Do you agree that our concentrated financial sector is a threat that must be 
addressed? Explain.
2. Journalist/lecturer Richard Doak laments what he believes to be unfair and excessive 
pay to executives: “Executive greed has perverted risks, rewards. . . . The American 
system has been rigged to over-enrich those at the top.”11 What do you think? Is greed 
the culprit? Has the system been “rigged,” or can we continue to count on the market to 
properly dist ribute pay? Explain.
Capitalism Challenged: America in Decline?
The economic and moral challenges to our capitalist system, the rise of China, and the 
ongoing political dysfunction in Washington, DC, have combined to shake our faith in 
America’s future. When asked in a 2013 Gallup Poll if the nation’s best days are ahead of 
us or behind, Americans were split with 47 percent seeing the best as yet to come whereas 
50 percent said we hav e already witnessed our peak.12 Some critics attribute the nation’s 
problems to fundamental flaws in capitalism and in the American character. Michael 
Occupy Wall Street

6  Unit One  Business and Society
Moore’s 2009 documentary movie, Capitalism: A Love Story, assails capitalism as “evil.”13 
Moore was questioned about his movie:
Wall Street Journal: Why call the movie “Capitalism: A Love Story?” You don’t seem to 
love very much about capitalism. Mr. Moore: It is a love story about the well-to-do. They 
happen to love their money very much. Now they love our money and they want all our 
money and our homes. It’s about their love.14
Political scientist Benjamin Barber believes that capitalism drags us into 
decadence by encouraging us to buy as many unnecessary products as we 
can manage, thus replacing historical principles of hard work and deferred 
gratification with infantile hungers for anything that might promise comfort. In 
America’s version of capitalism, as Barber sees it, we find liberty in commerce. We can buy 
whatever we want; therefore, we are free.15 But that undemanding vision of liberty means we 
have no sense of obligation for social and political ideals greater than self-satisfaction.16 Ask-
ing no more of us than unbridled consumption may undermine democracy itself, as columnist 
Rod Dreher argues:
Democracy requires virtue. So does a healthy capitalism. A nation that cannot govern its 
own appetites will, in time, be unable to govern itself. An economy that divorces economic 
activity from the restraining virtues that make for good stewardship will implode.17
Vast Resources
Although America has been grievously shaken by the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and the 
Great Recession, shouldn’t we find encouragement in the nation’s extraordinary strengths 
and resources? We remain dominant in economic, military, and international affairs, and, 
as Goldman Sachs recently told its clients, we should recognize “the  key economic institu-
tional, human capital and geopolitical advantages the U.S. enjoys over other economies.”18 
In particular, Goldman pointed to America’s attractiveness as a location for investment, 
the nation’s vast natural resources (especially arable land, oil, and gas), a workforce that is 
younger and more energetic than those of our chief rivals, and our continuing leadership in 
innovation.19 Commentator David Brooks says that America is merely in one of its peri-
odic economic pauses, but he is sure that: “The gospel of success will recapture the imagi-
nation.”20 Brooks summarized our fundamentally commercial nature:
Walt Whitman got America right in his essay, “Democratic Vistas.” He acknowledged the 
vulgarity of the American success drive. He toted up its moral failings. But in the end he ac-
cepted his country’s “extreme business energy,” its “almost maniacal appetite for wealth.” 
He knew that the country’s dreams were all built upon that energy and drive, and eventually 
the spirit of commercial optimism would always prevail.21

Chapter One  Capitalism and the Role of Government  7
Purpose: What Do We Hope to Accomplish?
Until this point, we have provided a brief reminder of some of the big challenges facing 
America’s capitalist system. The balance of this chapter more carefully examines the phil-
osophical nature of free market capitalism, introduces some alternatives to the free market, 
and asks where America’s political economy is headed. Chapter 1 thereby serves as a 
foundation for the book’s detailed investigation of the following questions:
1. What is the proper ethical/social role of business in American life?
2. How much, if any, government regulation of business is necessary to secure that 
role?
Markets and Governments
We certainly cannot understand America’s system of laws without a firm  appreciation for 
the principles of capitalism from which those laws spring. We have embraced an evolving 
capitalist, democratic approach to life. Other cultures have placed less faith in the market 
and more in government planning.
 
In this chapter we will explore the full economic spectrum, moving from a laissez-faire, 
free market approach on the extreme right to a brief reminder of command economy prin-
ciples on the far left. The bulk of our attention, however, will rest where the world is at this 
 moment. Most nations are practicing varying combinations of markets and rules that we 
can label mixed economies.
 
The pure free market approach assumes that we can operate our business system and 
our society at large free of all but foundational legal mechanisms such as contract and 
criminal law. The wisdom of the market—our individual judgments, in combination with 
our individual consciences—would “regulate” American life. Most forms of government 
including regulatory agencies, consumer protection, environmental rules, occupational 
 licensure, zoning restrictions, antitrust law, and all but the most basic government services 
would be eliminated.
 
Of course, today’s global debate is not so much about capitalism versus communism 
as about the mixed economy—that is, about what combination of capitalism and govern-
ment best serves the needs of America and the world. Substantially open markets have 
shown themselves to be the stronger vehicle for productivity, efficiency, and personal 
freedom. Are open markets also the stronger vehicle for improving living conditions for 
all citizens, for maximizing democracy, for discouraging crime and corruption, and for 
building strong communities? Are America and the world best served by the speed and 
efficiency of largely unrestrained markets, or do we still need the “civilizing” influence 
of government rules?
Law
Finally, this chapter should be read as a platform for the study of law that commences in 
Chapter 4. Once a society settles on some broad political and economic principles, it 
employs the law as a primary method of social control. So to understand the law, we 
need to understand its roots in the economic, political, and social preferences of America 
and the world.

8  Unit One  Business and Society
Questions—Part One
1. The John Templeton Foundation recently asked a number of prominent thinkers the 
 following question: “Does the free market corrode moral character?” Answer that question. 
[See www.templeton.org/market]
2. Former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009 said a “new era is starting” 
after the “definite defeat of capitalism.”22 Is capitalism dead (or dying)? Explain.
3. Scholar Robert Skidelsky applauds capitalism for overcoming scarcity, organizing 
 production, and lifting many out of poverty, but he thinks capitalism, at least in rich 
countries like the United States, has also produced a culture where our main occupation 
has become the production and consumption of unnecessary goods. He asks whether 
capitalism can succeed if it continues to produce “more of the same, stimulating jaded 
appetites with new gadgets, thrills, and excitements? . . . Do we spend the next century 
wallowing in triviality?”23 What do you think?
Part Two—Capitalism: Reduce Government?
Capitalism in America was built on the strong philosophical foundation of personal free-
dom and private property rights. Our great natural resources and personal ambition led to 
extraordinary prosperity. Monopolistic abuse followed, however, and government grew to 
curb the power of big business. Thus, America’s substantially free market was gradually 
constrained by government regulation. The proper balance between open  markets and gov-
ernment intervention remains perhaps the central public policy debate in American life.
 
Should we consider a return to a purer form of capitalism; largely free of government 
oversight? Can we, in large measure, do without government regulation of business? The 
controversial philosopher and novelist Ayn Rand was an uncompromising advocate of free 
market principles. She believed the necessary categories of government were only three in 
number: the police, the armed services, and the law courts. Rand’s philosophy of Objectiv-
ism contends that the practice of free market principles is necessary for a  rational, moral life. 
Rand’s views and the quality of her writing are heavily criticized, but she has been cited as a 
powerful influence by some of America’s leading corporate and political figures. Her books, 
including Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, are among the best-selling novels of all 
time. Indeed, Atlas Shrugged is one of the most influential business books in history, and 
 according to a national survey, has been read by over 8 percent of American adults.24
[For the trailer of a 2011 documentary treatment of Atlas Shrugged, see http://www
. youtube.com/watch?v=Tv29SXnd2dk&feature=related]
Big business leaders, who so often are the villains of contemporary 
American life, are the great heroes of Rand’s writing, in which she cham-
pioned “the virtue of selfishness” and rejected self-sacrifice. Commenta-
tor Stephen Moore explained Rand’s core theme in Atlas Shrugged:
Politicians invariably respond to crises—that in most cases they themselves created—by spawn-
ing new government programs, laws and regulations. These, in turn, generate more havoc and 
poverty, which inspires the politicians to create more programs . . . and the  downward spiral 
Big business leaders are

Chapter One  Capitalism and the Role of Government  9
Man’s Rights
R E A D I N G
fact that society stood above the moral law. . . . Thus, politi-
cally, all these systems were variants of an amoral society.
 
The most profoundly revolutionary achievement of the 
United States of America was the subordination of society to 
moral law.
 
The principle of man’s individual rights represented the ex-
tension of morality into the social system—as a limitation on 
the power of the state . . . The United States was the first moral 
society in history.
 
All previous systems had regarded man as a sacrificial 
means to the ends of others, and society as an end in itself. 
The United States regarded man as an end in himself, and so-
ciety as a means to the peaceful, orderly, voluntary coexist-
ence of individuals. All previous systems had held that man’s 
life belongs to society, that society can dispose of him in any 
way it pleases, and that any freedom he enjoys is his only by 
favor, by the permission of society, which may be revoked at 
any time. The United States held that man’s life is his by right, 
that a right is the property of an individual, that society as such 
has no rights, and that the only moral purpose of a government 
is the protection of individual rights.
 
A “right” is a moral principle defining and sanctioning a 
man’s freedom of action in a social context. There is only one 
fundamental right (all the others are its consequences or cor-
ollaries): a man’s right to his own life . . . 
 
America’s inner contradiction was the altruist-collectivist 
ethics. Altruism is incompatible with freedom, with capitalism, 
and with individual rights . . . 
 
It was the concept of individual rights that had given birth 
to a free society. It was with the destruction of individual 
rights that the destruction of freedom had to begin.
 
A collectivist tyranny dare not enslave a country by an out-
right confiscation of its values, material or moral. It has to be done 
by a process of internal corruption. . . . The process entails such a 
growth of newly promulgated “rights” that people do not notice 
the fact that the meaning of the concept is being reversed . . . 
Ayn Rand
If one wishes to advocate a free society—that is, capitalism—
one must realize that its indispensable foundation is the princi-
ple of individual rights. If one wishes to uphold individual 
rights, one must realize that capitalism is the only system that 
can uphold and protect them.
* * * * *
Every political system is based on some code of ethics. The 
dominant ethics of mankind’s history were variants of the 
 altruist-collectivist doctrine which subordinated the individual 
to some higher authority.
* * * * *
Under all such systems, morality was a code applicable to the 
individual, but not to society. Society was placed outside the 
moral law, and the inculcation of self-sacrificial devotion to 
social duty was regarded as the main purpose of ethics in 
man’s earthly existence.
 
Since there is no such entity as “society,” since society is 
only a number of individual men, this meant, in practice, that 
the rulers of society were exempt from moral law; subject only 
to traditional rituals, they held total power and exacted blind 
obedience—on the implicit principle of “The good is that 
which is good for society . . . ”
 
This was true of all statist systems, under all variants of the 
altruist-collectivist ethics. . . . As witness: the theocracy of 
Egypt, with the Pharaoh as an embodied god—the unlimited 
majority rule or democracy of Athens—the welfare state run 
by the Emperors of Rome—the Inquisition of the late Middle 
Ages—the absolute monarchy of France—the welfare state of 
Bismarck’s Prussia—the gas chambers of Nazi Germany—the 
slaughterhouse of the Soviet Union.
 
All these political systems were expressions of the altruist-
collectivist ethics—and their common characteristic is the 
r epeats itself until the productive sectors of the economy collapse under the  collective weight of 
taxes and other burdens imposed in the name of fairness, equality and do-goodism.25

If some men are entitled by right to the products of the 
work of others, it means that those others are deprived of 
rights and condemned to slave labor.

Observe, in this context, the intellectual precision of the 
Founding Fathers: they spoke of the right to the pursuit of hap-
piness—not of the right to happiness. It means that a man has 
the right to take the actions he deems necessary to achieve 
his happiness; it does not mean that others must make him 
happy . . . 
 
Property rights and the right of free trade are man’s only 
“economic rights” (they are, in fact, political rights)—and 
there can be no such thing as “an economic bill of rights.” . . . 
 
And while people are clamoring about “economic rights,” 
the concept of political rights is vanishing . . . 
 
Such is the state of one of today’s most crucial issues: 
political rights versus “economic rights.” It’s either-or. One 
destroys the other. But there are, in fact, no “economic rights,” 
no “collective rights,” no “public-interest rights.” The term indi-
vidual rights is a redundancy: there is no other kind of rights 
and no one else to possess them.
 
Those who advocate laissez-faire capitalism are the only 
advocates of man’s rights.

The Democratic Party platform of 1960 summarizes the switch 
boldly and explicitly. It declares that a democratic  administration 
“will reaffirm the economic bill of rights which Franklin 
Roosevelt wrote into our national conscience 16 years ago.”
 
Bear clearly in mind the meaning of the concept of rights 
when you read the list which that platform offers:
1. The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries 
or shops or farms or mines of the nation.
2. The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and 
clothing and recreation.
3. The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a 
return which will give him and his family a decent living.
4. The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in 
an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and 
domination by monopolies at home and abroad.
5. The right of every family to a decent home.
6. The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to 
achieve and enjoy good health.
7. The right to adequate protection from the economic fears 
of old age, sickness, accidents, and unemployment.
8. The right to a good education.
A single question added to each of the above eight clauses 
would make the issue clear: At whose expense?
 
Jobs, food, clothing, recreation (!), homes, medical care, 
 education, etc. do not grow in nature. These are man-made 
values—goods and services produced by men. Who is to pro-
vide them?

Capitalism in Practice—“Privatization” in America and Abroad
Championed in the 1980s by President Ronald Reagan in the United States and Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher in Great Britain, nations across the globe along with many 
American states and cities have turned to privatization both to address financial problems 
and to satisfy ideological preferences for smaller governments.
 
Most commonly, privatization follows two patterns: (1) contracting out where govern-
ment, in effect, turns over a portion of its duties, such as garbage collection, to a private 
firm; and (2) the sale or lease of public assets, such as an airport, to a private party. 
 Privately operated prisons, now rather common across America, are a primary example of 
the privatization movement. Of course, privatization also brings worries about job losses, 
reduced services, reduced responsiveness to consumers, corruption, and so on.
 
Price-driven, free market solutions range from highly pragmatic cost savings to exotic 
proposals for changing long-standing traditions. Greece, currently the most visible privati-
zation example, faces a collapsing economy and  an unemployment rate exceeding 25 per-
cent. Desperate for cash, Greece has been forced by its lenders to begin selling public 
property such as land, ports, airports, roads, water utilities, the national lottery, and banks 
to receive a multibillion euro bailout. At this writing in 2013, Greece’s privatization plan 
faces legal and operational difficulties, and fears have erupted that Greek oligarchs along 
with Chinese and Russian interests will buy many of the nation’s prized assets.
 
Struggling American governments likewise see privatization as a solution for financial 
distress. At this writing, the state of Louisiana has privatized four formerly state-operated 
hospitals and plans to do the same with five of the six public hospitals that remain. Several 
thousand hospital workers have lost their jobs, although many are expected to be rehired 
by the private firms that took over operations. Of course, wages and benefits may be lower 
in the privatized arrangement. State officials say the privatization plan will save millions 
of dollars while improving medical care.
 
Citing free market efficiency and personal freedom while challenging moral conven-
tions, privatization supporters envision major changes to daily life. For example, some 
doctors and others are arguing for lifting the federal ban on organ sales as a way of ad-
dressing the current donor shortage. The  resulting increase in supply would save many 
lives, but others fear the privatized approach would exploit the poor and vulnerable and 
discourage altruistic donors.30 Professor  Stephanie Coontz pushes the free market argu-
ment further by challenging the need for the state’s permission to marry. For most of 
 Western history,  marriage was a private contract, and Coontz wonders if the time has come 
to let couples, gay or straight, decide entirely on their own if they want to join together to

assume the pr otections and obligations of a  committed  relationship.31 In each of these 
 examples, the underlying idea is that the market can make decisions more efficiently and 
 effectively than government while also maximizing personal freedom. [For a large data-
base supportive of privatization, see http://reason.org/areas/topic/privatization]
Space Travel
Trying to save money while emerging from the Great Recession, the U.S. government has 
retired its shuttle rockets and will  encourage the continuing development of private-sector 
rockets that are expected to carry on space exploration and travel in cooperation with the 
 government. Presumably, space will be “commercialized” with companies hauling space 
travel customers and exploiting vast mineral resources that may lead to a new “gold rush.” 
SpaceX, a pioneer in the industry, carried supplies to the International Space Station in 
2012. Several other private firms are seeking space contract work and at least one is selling 
tickets to the moon. Critics, however, think the private sector is unlikely to be able to meet 
the enormous safety and financial hurdles involved in sustained space travel.32
Room for Big Ideas
SpaceX founder Elon Musk (the cocreator of PayPal and the founder of Tesla, the electric 
car company) recently said he is working on a vertical liftoff passenger jet as well as a 
project called a Hyperloop, a tube that would be capable of moving people from San 
F rancisco to Los Angeles in 30 minutes.
Question
Is a market-based culture of freedom and daring necessary to the creation and sustenance 
of these very big ideas, or is a blend of the market and government necessary? Explain. 
See David Brooks, “Temerity at the Top,” The New York Times, Septem ber 20, 2012 
[http://www.nytimes.com/].
Toll Roads, Parking Meters, and Congestion Pricing
Should users pay fees for access to highways? Private companies are building, maintain-
ing, and operating new toll roads in places such as northern Virginia and suburban San 
Diego to the Mexican border. Taking the privatization movement a step further, state and 
local governments are selling or leasing existing roads to private companies. Indiana, for 
example, leased its 157-mile Indiana East–West Toll Road to an international group for 
$3.8 billion for 75 years. The new operators can raise tolls each year by 2 percent, the in-
flation rate, or the increase in GDP; whichever is hig her.33
 
Critics worry, however, about declining service, excessive tolls, too much profit for the 
investors, pricing poorer drivers out of access to the roads, and trading secure government 
jobs with benefits for low-wage private-sector jobs without benefits.34 Nonetheless, increas-
ing government revenue problems suggest that transportation privatization will continue. 
[For labor union opposition to privatization, see http://www.afscme.org/issues/76.cfm]
 
The privatization movement is extending beyond toll roads to other infrastructure re-
sources. Chicago sold control of its parking garages to Morgan Stanley for $563 million35 and 
entered a 75-year, $1.15 billion lease arrangement with private investors who control and man-
age its 36,000 parking meters.36 A 2012 report concludes that Chicago’s parking cost in the 

14  Unit One  Business and Society
downtown Loop will be about $6.50 per hour in 2013, the highest rate in the United States.37 
Many believe the parking deal has turned out to be a financial disaster for the city.38 
 
While adding to and upgrading infrastructure through privatization, governments and 
their agents are also turning to pricing/market mechanisms to reduce demand for that infra-
structure. One expanding initiative is congestion pricing that involves making a service 
more expensive at times of peak demand in order to curb that demand. Employing new 
technology and the law of supply and demand, San Francisco is experimenting with a plan 
that may raise on-street parking to as much as $6 per hour in high-demand areas during 
busy hours of the day while lowering prices in less congested areas and during less frantic 
hours. At least 10 metropolitan areas have in place or are contemplating so-called HOT 
lanes or Lexus Lanes where, for a fee, drivers can move to an express lane with reduced 
traffic and higher speeds. In some locales, those lanes are also available without charge to 
motorists in car pools, motorcyclists, buses, and hybrid vehicles.
Questions
1. Author Joan Didion referred to our highways as America’s only communion. Would it 
be a social/ethical wrong to adopt widespread “congestion fees,” privately operated toll 
roads, and “Lexus Lanes” that would permit those with money to avoid the democracy 
of the highways? Explain.
2. Governing Magazine labeled golf courses “perhaps the most non-essential of the non-
essential public services.”39 Studies show that payrolls for city-operated golf courses 
are about 13 percent higher than for privately operated courses.40 Why do we subsidize 
golf, and should we continue doing so? Explain.
3. a.  The U.S. Postal Service currently loses a few billion dollars annually. Should we 
privatize the postal service?
 
b.  Would UPS, for example, want to assume responsibility for delivery to every home 
in America? Explain.
Schools
Is capitalism the answer to poor school performance? The idea was unthinkable a few dec-
ades ago, but some increasingly frustrated parents and school boards have adopted a free 
market “fix.” Schools are experimenting with market-based approaches such as for-profit 
web-based classes, open  enrollment (students attend the school of their choice regardless of 
their place of residence), charter schools (funded by taxes but freed of much government 
oversight), and vouchers  (students “spend” their taxpayer-provided dollars on the school of 
their choice). The hope is that competition will push all schools to higher achievement levels, 
but a 2010 evaluation of Milwaukee, Wisconsin’s Parental Choice Program, the biggest and 
oldest voucher and charter school experiment in America, found that achievement growth 
rates were about the same as in the public schools, a result that is consistent with a number of 
other studies.41 In Dallas, Worcester, Massachusetts, and other districts, 
direct payments to students of $100 to $500 per year for improved test 
performance have produced some success. Although experts believe the 
payments alone do not lift results, but when combined with tutoring and 
other support tactics, learning may be strengthened.42

performance.

Chapter One  Capitalism and the Role of Government  15
Privatization a Success?
Privatization often brings substantially reduced costs and improved expertise, but some-
times the transition does not work well. Fury might be the best word to describe consumer 
reaction to the higher rates and poor service that accompanied Chicago’s parking meter 
privatization, but Indiana has used the money from its toll road leases to fund a popular, 
10-year highway improvement program.43 Some privatization  efforts, such as Florida’s 
plan to lease its “Alligator Alley” toll road, fail because of an absence of private-sector 
bids.44 Some projects do not generate the anticipated savings. Although more than 30 states 
contract with private prisons, a 2011 study in Arizona found little or no savings in doing so 
even though private prisons often “cherry pick” the least expensive prisoners.45
Privatize Higher Education?
The Anderson School of Management at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) 
received permission in 2013 to substantially privatize its prestigious MBA program. The 
program will be allowed to raise tuition, keep most of its income, and spend that income on 
attracting yet more skilled professors and students thus raising its academic profile to better 
compete with Harvard University, Stanford University, and the like. Anderson leaders also 
believe the self-sufficiency/privatization decision will allow them to raise more money in 
contributions, some of which are contingent on the change. Tuition, currently over $96,000 
for the two-year program, is projected to rise to “market rates” for top-tier schools (e.g., 
nearly $130,000 for Stanford). A few other UCLA programs were already privatized and the 
University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business became self-sufficient in 2002.
 
Those opposing Anderson’s privatization fear that UCLA’s responsibilities for the gen-
eral welfare may be replaced by the more self-interested goals of those running the pro-
gram, its donors, and the business community. Perhaps, for example, a privatized MBA 
program would be more likely to allow admission to a major donor’s child, shape its re-
search agenda to conform to the interests of corporate donors, diminish its attention to 
community needs or eventually replace merit-based admission with an auction allowing 
space to the highest bidders. Of course, the long-term interest of the Anderson School is in 
taking only those steps that strengthen the school’s performance and reputation in a highly 
competitive MBA market, and even in its self-sufficient/privatized mode, the Anderson 
School continues to be a part of UCLA and the University of California system.

18  Unit One  Business and Society
Part Three—Collectivism: Increase Government?
The term collectivism embraces communism and socialism and similar philosophies on the 
left side of the political/economic spectrum. Collectivist systems feature economic coop-
eration and varying degrees of centralized control as contrasted with cap italism’s eco-
nomic individualism and political freedom.
Communism
Although China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam, and a few other nations continue to practice 
communism, the balance of the world has clearly rejected Marxist-Leninist totalitarianism. 
China is rapidly and enthusiastically embracing free market practices, with continuing 
state direction; a strategy that some label state capitalism, as discussed below. Chinese 
enthusiasm for elements of free market practice should not be misunderstood, however. 
The communist state remains firmly in charge.
 
Fidel Castro’s departure from the Cuban presidency in favor of his brother Raul has resulted 
in initial free market reforms. For the first time in 50 years, Cubans are now allowed to buy and 
sell houses freely as well as used cars. Cubans can own cell phones and other electronic de-
vices, some state land is being distributed for private farming, and some 
private cabs are being licensed. Some 400,000 people now hold p rivate-
sector jobs such as scooter repair, barber, and produce vendor in the 
180 government-approved employment categories. Restaurants, snack 
bars, and other small shops are springing up. However, the bureaucratic pace is extremely slow, 
and Cuba remains firmly communist/ socialist. Most of the 11 million Cubans continue to lead a 
spare, government-supported existence, and political liberty is nonexistent.
 
Communist Vietnam is also embracing elements of capitalism. Nike, Samsung, and 
smartphone component suppliers for Apple are among the manufacturers drawn to Vietnam 
for its relatively low wages and stable political environment. New York Times reporter Keith 
 Bradsher says that many Asian executives and some in America, believe that communism 
encourages the societal stability they value.46 Perhaps America’s investment presence in 
Vietnam, our enemy in a fierce war of the 1970s, is encouraging evidence of the healing 
power of international trade? More cynically, perhaps host-country political practices don’t 
trouble foreign investors unless those practices threaten the bottom line?
Communist Principles
Despite the decline of communism, we need to briefly remind ourselves of some Marxist fun-
damentals, among which the core promise of economic justice for all remains a particularly 
powerful motivator. Lenin, not Marx, created the communist dictatorship in Russia. Lenin and 
the other communist totalitarians, most notably Stalin in the Soviet Union and Mao in China, 
did horrific damage. However, Marx, along with Freud and Einstein, is among the thinkers who 
most profoundly shaped the 20th century. For our purposes, Marx’s central message concerns 
the severe abuses that can accompany unrestrained capitalism. Marx was particularly concerned 
about the growing imbalance between rich and poor. Moreover, he felt that the pursuit of wealth 
and self-interest would erode society’s moral core. More broadly, Marx built an e conomic inter-
pretation of history, arguing that “the mode of production in material life  determines the general 
Cubans can own 
cell phones.

Chapter One  Capitalism and the Role of Government  19
Socialism
Communism appears to have run its course philosophically and pragmatically, but the 
problems that generated its appeal—poverty, oppression, the rich-poor gap, and so on— 
remain. Hence government intervention in the market continues to be needed. The ques-
tion is: How much government is appropriate? Socialists provide one answer by rejecting 
communist totalitarianism and embracing democracy while calling for aggressive govern-
ment intervention to correct economic and social ills. Historically, socialism has often 
been  associated with democratic governments and peaceful change, whereas communism 
has been characterized by totalitarianism and violent revolution.
 
Socialists aim to retain the benefits of industrialism while abolishing the social costs 
often accompanying the free market. The government is likely to be directly  involved in 
regulating growth, inflation, and unemployment. In the contemporary Western world, Aus-
tria, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, South Africa, Finland, and France are among the nations 
where socialist principles have retained a significant presence. Those nations have now 
embraced free markets, but socialist welfare concerns remain influential.
Socialist Goals
A critical distinction between socialists and capitalists is that the former believe a society’s 
broad directions should be carefully planned rather than left to what some take to be the 
whimsy of the market. Furthermore, socialists are convinced that problems of market 
Communism to Capitalism: A Bumpy Road
People in former communist nations in Eastern Europe, including Romania, Poland, Hun-
gary, the Czech Republic, and Russia, report mixed feelings as they look back on the years 
following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War between the former Soviet 
Union and the Western European/American allies. When dictatorships were replaced by 
democracy, the initial reaction was euphoria, but in subsequent years some nostalgia for the 
certainties of communism has emerged. A Czech professor  summarized the current feel-
ings of disappointment: “People here admired the freedom and prosperity of the Western 
world. Now what they see is materialism, corruption, inflation,  lawlessness—and they can’t 
find spiritual or material prosperity.”48 High unemployment, poverty, and harsh cuts in public 
spending have dashed the high hopes for post-communist prosperity. Many in Eastern  Europe 
yearn for the comfort of state-provided health care and education and state- subsidized 
goods and services, but the evidence suggests they tend to forget about the poor quality of 
those goods and services, state censorship, the absence of freedom, and fear of the state.

 failure (inadequate information, monopoly, externalities, public goods, and so on—see 
Chapter 8) mean that the free market is simply incapable of meeting the needs of all 
 segments of society. The socialist agenda includes these elements:49
1. Liberty. To the capitalist, socialism appears to harshly restrain individual freedom. 
To the socialist, the freedoms of capitalism are largely an illusion, accessible only to the 
prosperous and powerful.
2. Social welfare. Socialists reserve much of their concern for the condition of the lower 
class—poverty, exploitation, cultural deprivation, and so on. Socialists believe that the econ-
omy must be directed toward the general interest rather than left free to multiply the welfare of 
successful capitalists. Hence, socialists advocate income supports, free education, free health 
care, generous sick pay, family planning, and the like to correct the failures of capitalism.
3. Fulfilling work. Socialists object to the harshness of working life where a large seg-
ment of society is chained to degrading labor.
4. Community. Socialists seek a communitarian approach to 
life where the excessive individualism of capitalism is muted by a 
concern for the welfare of all.
5. Equality. Class distinctions are anathema to the socialist. All 
humans are equally meritorious, and distinctions among them are 
inherently unjust.
6. Rationality. Socialists fear the “irrationality” of a society based on competition and 
unrestrained pursuit of industrial growth.
 
As explained in the account that follows, poverty and claims of corporate exploitation 
have allowed socialism to regain a tentative foothold in parts of South America.
Socialists seek a

approach to life.
Socialism in South America
Recently deceased President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez hoped to build a “21st century 
socialism” in South America that would elevate the poor—forgotten by “savage 
 capitalism”—while leading his country and neighbors, including Bolivia, Ecuador, Hondu-
ras, and Nicaragua away from American dominance. He wanted to destroy what he saw as 
centuries of plundering, humiliation, and discrimination against indigenous people by 
monied interests, particularly American multinationals. Chavez said that world power is 
shifting from America:
The uni-polar world has collapsed. The power of the U.S. empire has collapsed. 
Everyday, the new poles of world power are becoming stronger. Beijing, Tokyo, 
Tehran. . . . It’s moving toward the East and toward the South.50
Chavez nationalized many companies, drove out ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, and 
redistributed land from the government and private owners to the poor. While Chavez said 
he would “bury” Venezuelan capitalism, the private sector continues to control about two-
thirds of the Venezuelan economy.
 
With strong oil prices, Chavez had a steady and generous revenue stream that allowed him 
to dramatically increase state funding of social projects. The government claims to have cut 
poverty in half, and Chavez inspired many Venezuelans to engage in civic life and to feel a new

Coping with Capitalism—China and Russia
China—Economics
China and some other nations practice what is sometimes labeled “state capitalism” in 
which the government is the dominant economic force as it intervenes in and shapes the 
market to further the state’s political goals. The result has been something of an economic 
miracle as China has blended its large but shrinking system of state-owned enterprise with 
the explosive power of the free market (guided by the government) to sprint ahead of Japan 
and become in 2010 the globe’s second ranking economy as measured by gross national 
product.
 
China’s new president,  Xi Jinping, has indicated that his nation of 1.3 billion people 
must boost market-based competition, but at the same time, he appears resolute in his com-
mitment to the Communist Party. With economic growth slowing, labor shortages, pollu-
tion and corruption mounting, and the transition from a middle- to high-income economy 
in the offing, China’s leadership generally recognizes that adjustments are necessary. En-
trenched interests, however, make change difficult. 
 
State-owned firms control about 30 percent of the Chinese economy with about 120 gi-
ants controlled by the central government and about 150,000 smaller, state-owned compa-
nies.51 Huge sectors of the economy are dominated by government entities, as explained by 
the Los Angeles Times:
Need a cellphone plan? Choose from the trio of state-owned giants: China Mobile, China 
Telecom and China Unicom. Looking to fly? You’re most likely to take one of the three ma-
jor state carriers: Air China, China Southern and China Eastern. Upset about gas prices? 
They’re determined by a government duopoly of PetroChina and Sinopec.52
Problems
As noted, China faces many problems, particularly as it attempts to balance its export-led 
economy with increased domestic consumer spending. Stunning levels of environmental 
pollution; stock market manipulation; dangerous foods and drugs; rampant piracy of soft-
ware, movies, and music; and government corruption are among those difficulties. Basic 
social support structures like affordable access to health care, unemployment insurance, and 
concern for the nation’s welfare. Critics say he stifled dissent, took control of almost every 
government institution, and subjected the nation to double-digit inflation, food and power 
shortages, a devalued currency, and a murder rate that has doubled in recent years. 
 
At this writing in 2013, Chavez has been succeeded by former Vice President Nicolas 
Maduro, who seems to share Chavez’s ideology. Ecuador’s popular leftist president, 
 Rafael Correa, easily won reelection in 2013. At the same time, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and 
other South American nations are governed by market-based regimes.

pensions remain inadequate. More broadly, China’s income gap between rich and poor is 
estimated to be among the world’s largest, although China has reduced the disparity in re-
cent years.53 Furthermore, China has instituted new environmental rules, corruption crack-
downs, and social service initiatives.
Changing Labor Markets
Low wages, often difficult working conditions, and a rapidly shrinking supply of young 
laborers (the result of strict family planning policies) have caused unrest among work-
ers leading to occasional strikes and some increase in wages, although those wages re-
main low relative to the economy’s overall health. China’s reliance on cheap labor to 
drive its economy is threatened as other nations are able to undercut the Chinese advan-
tage. Despite China’s renewed global prominence and its stunning economic advances, 
record numbers of professionals reportedly leave annually. Well-paid in her job at a 
multinational, Chen Kuo, age 30, explained why she had decided to leave China for 
Australia:
It’s very stressful in China—sometimes I was working 128 hours a week for my auditing 
company. . . . And it will be easier raising my children as Christians abroad. It is more free in 
Australia.54
China—Politics
Freedom Of course, China remains a dictatorship governed by the Communist Party. 
Repression is common. The government controls the media as evidenced by censorship 
battles between the Chinese government and Internet news sources such as Google, The 
New York Times, and Bloomberg, each of which has been blocked at 
times. China uses its “Great Firewall” of Internet censors to filter 
search results, particularly those addressing politically sensitive 
themes such as official corruption, democracy, Tibetan freedom, 
Taiwan, and the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown (during which 
troops killed hundreds of protesters during prodemocracy demonstrations in Beijing). An 
estimated 30,000 to 50,000 regulators monitor the web in China with certain sites such as 
Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter blocked from public access.55
Reforms Even as China has rejected calls to guarantee freedom of speech and move 
toward democracy, the Communist Party leadership recognizes the need for gradual 
change. In a bid to stimulate a slowing economy, China announced in late 2013 that it 
would open state industries to greater private-sector competition while also easing some 
limits on foreign investment. Further, the government has an-
nounced plans to abolish its system of “reeducation” through forced 
labor, and to ease its one-child per family policy. The rule of law is 
increasingly powerful in Chinese life as the number of lawyers in 
China more than doubled from 1997 to 2008.56 Still Communist Party bosses use the law 
as a means of social control, repression remains common, and governance by the rule of 
law, where no person or political party is above the law, is not yet the case in China.57

Question
Technology entrepreneur and academic Vivek Wadhwa, in assessing emerging economic 
trends, asked, “Does China own the future—or does the United States?”59 Answer Wadh-
wa’s question.
Russia—Economics
A Western visitor to modern Moscow must be hard-pressed to imagine that this thriving, 
consuming, competitive place was once the global center of communism, the dour capital 
of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and the home of America’s nuclear enemy. 
After the fall of the USSR and the ideological defeat of communism, Moscow embraced 
consumer capitalism, a change described by The Christian Science Monitor:
The heavy, block buildings of Russia’s capital are no longer covered in banners of Lenin, 
Marx, and Engels. Instead, enormous billboards advertise watches, cars, clothing—items 
 unimaginable in Soviet times. Capitalism has taken hold with a vengeance.60
Russia remains a developing nation with a total economy about one-eighth the size of the 
U.S economy.61 Nonetheless, Russia’s economic performance since the late 1990s has 
been impressive. With only a brief bump during the Great Recession, Russi a has used its 
vast natural resources (Russia leads the world in oil production and is second in natural 
gas) to buy increased prosperity and achieve a balanced budget with near full employment. 
At this writing in 2013, however, growth has slowed and Russian president, Vladimir 
 Putin, has proposed borrowing from Russian pension reserves to modernize the famous 
Trans-Siberian Railway, build a superhighway around Moscow, and build a 500-mile 
high-speed rail line between Moscow and Kazan, a regional capital.62 Putin’s economic 
plan also includes a slowdown in the planned privatization of state-owned banks, utilities, 
Visit Mom and Dad
“The son has forgotten the mother,” 78-year-old Li Lanyu said recently in a Chinese court 
where she complained about her 60-year-old son’s failure to visit her regularly and bring 
needed grain and cooking oil.58 China’s Buddhist heritage commands extraordinary re-
spect for parents, but effective July 1, 2013, a new Chinese law requires attention to par-
ents 60 and older and living on their own. Family members “should often visit or send 
regards to their parents,” and they must attend to their parents’ “spiritual needs” and must 
not “overlook” or “neglect” them. The law does not specifically define those new expecta-
tions. Some Chinese are troubled that their nation may have reached the point where it 
must force filial piety by law, but others suspect the state is simply looking for a way to 
sustain a swelling elderly population as the workforce shrinks, in part as a consequence of 
the official “one child” population control policy.
 
At this writing, a judgment in Li’s lawsuit has not been rendered, but in a similar case, 
a judge recently ordered a woman to visit her 77-year-old mother every two months and on 
major holidays.

oil companies, and other enormous assets. The Russian government controls about 50 per-
cent of the nation’s economy,63 a presence that many economists believe must be reduced 
if Russia is to encourage foreign investment and maintain a vibrant economic future.
 
A big threat to Russia’s long-term economic welfare and national stability is its aging 
population, now at about 143 million and growing slightly, but projected to decline to 
116 million by 2050.64 Life expectancy declined to 69.7 years in 2012 (as compared with 
78 in the United States and 83 in Japan).65 Russia’s population dilemma is at least signifi-
cantly attributable to a national culture of drinking and smoking that has contributed to a 
life expectancy for Russian men of only 60 years.66 
Russia—Politics
Russia’s future economic success is intimately tied, of course, to its political processes. 
The state needs to win over foreign multinational investors who fear political tyranny and 
domestic corruption. Maplecroft, the British political risk consulting firm, in 2011 ranked 
Russia 186th out of 196 countries in political risk to business (1 being least risky) and 
 according to Transparency International, Russia is the world’s most  corrupt major econ-
omy, ranking 154th out of 178 countries (1 being least corrupt).67
 
The Russian government’s centralization of economic power has been accompanied by 
tightened control over politics, courts, activists, and the mass media. A 2012 law imposes a 
$9,000 fine on those taking part in unsanctioned demonstrations that damage people or 
property.68 At this writing in 2013, hundreds of Russian civil organizations (e.g., support-
ing voting rights) have been subjected to “inspections” for “politi-
cal activity.”69 Recent legislation bans the “propaganda of 
nontraditional sexual relations” and imposes fines for holding gay 
pride rallies or providing information about the gay community to 
minors.70 The Russian people, nonetheless, express strong support for President Putin, 
even as they acknowledge a wide gap between what is and what should be in Russian elec-
tions, judicial systems, free press, and the like.71 Critics question whether state capitalism 
as practiced in Russia can succeed in the face of political repression, routine corruption, 
and abuse of the rule of law.72 
Questions
1. China wants to curb its population growth, while Russia has sought to increase its num-
ber of children. China’s government allows each couple to have only one child, al-
though exceptions are permitted for those living in rural areas and for minorities. Heavy 
fines may be imposed on those who violate the rules. In Russia, then President Dmitri 
Medvedev, in his 2010 State of  Russia speech, called for a baby bonus, better health 
care, and free land for women who will have a third child. Why would governments 
make commands on childbearing practices?  Is this acceptable? Explain.
2. Can China maintain its closed, centrally controlled political system while enjoying the 
benefits of its somewhat open economic markets? Explain.
3. In 2014, in response to Russian military action in Ukraine, the United States imposed 
 sanctions—travel bans and asset freezes—on several Russian government officials as well 
as business executives and companies.  What impact might these sanctions have?  Should 
such sanctions be a part of an international response to a government’s actions?  Explain.

Gender Equality
Sweden aggressively encourages gender equality. Believing boys have an unfair edge, 
eradication of gender stereotypes has become a key ingredient in Swedish education. At 
Stockholm’s “Egalia” (equality) preschool, for example, the staff avoids using the words 
“him” or “her” and addresses all children as “friends.” Children’s books often feature 
 homosexual couples, single parents, or adopted children and classics like Cinderella are 
shunned. Egalia’s methods are controversial, even in Sweden.

Part Four—Middle Ground? A Mixed Economy (The Third Way)
Communism has failed. Socialist principles, to the extent that they require central plan-
ning, bloated bureaucracies, and restraints on personal freedom, are discredited. An era has 
passed, but the shape of the future is unclear. The state capitalism of China, Russia, and 
other nations has little appeal in America and Western Europe and yet America’s brand of 
free market capitalism has lost a great deal of luster in the recent financial collapse and the 
ongoing Great Recession. Some middle ground in free market and welfare state principles 
may be the next step, but the appropriate mixture is proving elusive. For years, the Nordic 
states of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland practiced their market socialism or so-
cial democracy with such success that it was labeled a “Third Way” between the harsher 
extremes of capitalism and communism. Their welfare states provided healthy economic 
growth with cradle-to-grave social care for all in a system emphasizing the collective 
 welfare over individual preferences.
Sweden
Life expectancy in Sweden is 81.28 years, as compared with about 78.62 years in the 
United States.73 The government provides education, health care, child care, maternity 
and paternity leave, unemployment protection, and more. Government incentives pro-
mote preferred behaviors. For example, the Swedish government will pay 80 percent of 
a parent’s salary (capped at $65,000) for up to 13 months of parental leave from work. 
Fathers are required to take at least two months of that leave time 
to receive government benefits. Some employers, such as the in-
ternational clothing retailer H&M, make up the difference in pay 
if the salary of the parent on leave exceeds the government’s pay-
ment. H&M favors the parental leave policy as an opportunity for employees to try out 
new jobs, and each H&M employee has a designated substitute should leave be needed. 
Overall, the parental leave policy has contributed to Sweden’s standing as a world 
leader in gender equality. About 72 percent of working-age Swedish women work at 
least part  time.74
H&M favors the parental 
leave policy.

26  Unit One  Business and Society
Taxes To pay for its cradle-to-grave welfare benefits, Sweden takes about 45 percent of 
its national income (gross domestic product-GDP) in taxes, while the United States, in 
contrast, has one of the developed world’s lowest total tax burdens at about 27 percent of 
GDP in recent decades, but down to about 24 percent during the recession.75 In order to 
keep its economy healthy, Sweden has followed a policy of comparatively low total corpo-
rate taxes (22 percent76 as compared with a U.S. rate of 39.2 percent, federal and state 
combined, although with loopholes included, the U.S. effective rate is an estimated 
29.2 percent.77 As a result, Sweden’s economic performance over the past 20 years has 
been among the strongest in the world, supporting, for example, a health care system that 
exceeds U.S. health care on almost all performance measures but costs less than half as 
much per person (although waiting times for some nonemergency services might be con-
siderably longer in Sweden).78 Even so, the pressure of globalization has been felt in 
 Sweden where a more moderate and somewhat right-center government has pushed aside 
the left-leaning Social Democrats and has significantly lowered taxes, privatized some 
state-dominated companies, and reduced unemployment by encouraging work over wel-
fare. Business regulations have been dramatically reduced, and tens of thousands of long-
term unemployed welfare recipients have been pushed back into the  labor market. Sweden 
hopes to maintain its core welfare commitment in combination with an entrepreneurial 
spirit more like America’s. The result is an economy of relatively low unemployment, low 
inflation, and high GDP growth.79
 
One expert attributes the Third Way success to “lavish” spending on research and de-
velopment and higher education.80 Thus, for Sweden and the other Scandinavian states, 
wise government spending is a key ingredient in a successful market-based economy. We 
should remember, of course, that Sweden is a small, homogeneous nation. Replicating its 
policies in the United States would be difficult. And the Swedes are, of course, not free 
from difficulties. Angry, youths rioted in Stockholm and other communities in 2013 pro-
testing lack of jobs in their communities and discrimination. At this  writing, the distur-
bances have quieted.
Speeding Ticket
Ferrari-driving millionaire, “Roland S.” was fined $290,000 in 2009 for speeding 60 miles per 
hour through a small village in Switzerland where the speed limit was 30. In their verdict, which 
was subject to appeal, judges labeled the driver a “traffic thug.” The fine reflected a 2007 Swiss 
law allowing judges to hand down fines in certain misdemeanor cases based on personal income 
and wealth. “Roland S.” was worth some $20 million, and he was a repeat offender. The 
maximum Swiss fine is $1 million, while Germany permits as much as a $16 million fine. 
France, Austria, and the Nordic nations also permit punishments based on personal wealth.

Would you favor penalties in America based on income and wealth? Explain.

Chapter One  Capitalism and the Role of Government  27
American Capitalism in Europe?
Does the European Union—ranging broadly from the  Scandinavian Third Way to 
 Germany’s cooperative, but increasingly aggressive  capitalism—have a better long-term 
vision for  personal and societal welfare than the United States? Is America’s more libertar-
ian “cowboy capitalism” better adapted to the  globe’s demands than the “coordinated, 
stakeholder capitalism” characteristic of much of Europe? The evidence is mixed. In 
building entrepreneurial spirit, personal freedom, and personal wealth and income, the 
United States is the clear world leader, but the EU’s very powerful, 28 nation, over 
500 million person bloc generates a gross national product slightly larger than the United 
States and more than three times that of India or  Japan.81 For Europeans, however,  quantity 
seems to be less important than quality.  Europeans choose to work less than Americans, 
and as they see it, enjoy life more. Their economy is less flexible than ours and typically pro-
duces fewer jobs, but it is also less harsh.82 Universal health care, job protection, and strong 
unemployment  benefits are part of the European identity. 
Welfare Reform Europe’s warmer, more communal values and practices are inviting, but 
the ongoing recession has resulted in a EU unemployment rate of more than 12 percent (as 
compared with about 7 percent in the United States) and the need for Eurozone economic 
bailouts of nearly bankrupt economies in Ireland, Greece, Spain, and Portugal. Youth 
(age 15–24) unemployment at over 23 percent for the EU generally83 and nearing 60 percent 
in Spain and Greece has produced something approaching a “lost generation”84 in some 
countries. In Italy more than 40 percent of 25- to 34-year-olds continue to live at home.85
 
These struggles have also sharpened the divide between the more prosperous northern 
European nations (Germany’s unemployment rate is about 5.4 percent) and the struggling 
south (unemployment in Greece and Spain exceeds 26 percent).86 Austerity, that is, higher 
taxes and sharp cutbacks in government spending, has been implemented in the struggling 
nations. In France, for example, dramatic government spending cuts in 2013 and beyond 
may challenge the nation’s generally comfortable lifestyle. Public spending amounting to 
about 57 percent of GDP had produced a protected population with strong family support, 
low poverty, and generous pensions, but for the present at least the French government has 
concluded that it simply cannot afford that approach. Social programs will not be dismem-
bered but painful cutbacks seem to be unavoidable.87
 
Germany, on the other hand, has been able to balance a rather generous social safety net 
(long-term care, vacations, pensions, etc.) with a very robust and highly skilled manufactur-
ing sector, and an effective government to produce job security and a comfortable life. 
 Germany has managed its budget carefully, adopted reforms such as an increased retirement 
age, and maintained a strong market-based economy to support its social programs.88 
EU Failure? The Great Recession has shaken the European Union—so much so that 
Yale professor Nicholas Sambanis recently asked in The New York Times, “Has ‘Europe’ 
Failed?”89 He argued that the European Union’s problems extend beyond economics to its 
very identity. Can the union remain united or will its citizens, particularly in the wealthier 
nations, identify more with their native homeland than with the EU? Compounding their 
economic challenges, many European nations are struggling to assimilate immigrants and

to become comfortable with growing Muslim populations, as pointedly noted by German 
chancellor Angela Merkel:
This multicultural approach, saying that we simply live side by side and live happily with 
each other, has failed. Utterly failed.90
Contrasting Values
Obviously, both Europe and America are struggling in this troubled time, but which vision 
of life seems most promising over the long term? American commentator and social activist 
Jeremy Rifkin contrasted the American and European “Dreams”:91
American Dream 
vs. 
European Dream
Wealth/Individual success 
vs. 
Quality of life
Growth 
vs. 
Sustainable development
Property/Civil rights 
vs. 
Social/Human rights
Live to work 
vs. 
Work to live
Religiosity/Piety 
vs. 
Declining faith
Strong military 
vs. 
Build peace
Rifkin thinks the European strategy is the better one. What do you think? Which of those 
two lists of values is more comfortable and inspiring for you? Which is more likely to meet 
the demands of the ongoing global competition and evolution? [For an argument that the 
United States is better positioned than either the European Union or China for the long-
term economic future, see Ian Bremmer and Nouriel Roubini, “Whose Economy Has It 
Worst?” The Wall Street Journal, November 12–13, 2011, p. C3].
Is the Welfare State a Key to Personal Happiness?
Denmark turns out to be the happiest place on Earth, according to a 2013 United Nations 
study of global happiness in 156 countries. The top of the happiness list  includes: 1. Denmark, 
2. Norway, 3. Switzerland, 4. The Netherlands, and 5. Sweden, all northern European states 
with strong welfare principles. The United States ranks 17th on the list, ahead of the United 
Kingdom (22), France (25), and Japan (43). Most of the various  happiness studies find the 
Scandinavian countries at or near the top of the list. Why? One theory, according to research-
ers, is that basic needs are satisfied in those countries to a higher degree than elsewhere.
 
What matters most? Broadly, good health, education, freedom, and wealth are associated 
with happiness, but wealth seems to increase happiness only up to a point. According to a 
2010 study, happiness basically peaks at about $75,000 in the United States, but life satis-
faction keeps rising with increasing income. Another 2010 study found that getting richer, 
in and of itself, does not make a nation happier in the long run. Simply “hanging out” with 
friends and family seems to be critical to the Danes’ being first in the world level of happi-
ness. Ninety-two percent of Danes belong to some kind of social club, and the government 
 encourages these get-togethers by helping to pay for them. Likewise, while Danes value 
nice things, they are said to be a “post-consumerist” society where c onsumption is not a

high priority. Their extraordinarily high taxes (around 50 percent of income) may also play 
a role in the happiness quotient in that income is substantially leveled, allowing careers to be 
chosen more on the basis of interest rather than money and also  allowing everyone to “hold 
his/her head high” regardless of occupational status.  Finally, experts point particularly to the 
Danes’ very high quotient of trust, which may be a product of the cradle-to-grave security pro-
vided by the government. For example, mothers often leave their babies unattended in stroll-
ers outside shops and restaurants. Of course, Denmark has the advantage of being a small, 
homogenous nation largely free of America’s worldwide responsibilities.
Purpose? A 2011 Wall Street Journal survey of happiness research raised a cautionary note 
by drawing a distinction between a purposeful life and a happy life. Mounting evidence 
suggests that people who focus on a meaningful life, while sometimes sacrificing happiness 
feelings in the moment, may be healthier, live longer, and have a greater sense of well being 
over time than people who focus on short-term feelings of happiness by eating a good meal, 
going to a movie, enjoying a big game, etc. Noting that symptoms of depression, paranoia, 
and psychopathology steadily increased in American college students from 1938 to 2007, 
San Diego State University researchers have offered as a plausible explanation America’s 
increasing emphasis on pleasure, materialism, and status and decreasing attention to 
community and meaning in life. For noted scholar and consultant Michael Porter’s Social 
Progress Index, a measure of “the extent to which countries provide for the social and 
environmental needs of their citizens,” see www.socialprogressimperative.org/.
Questions
For several decades, tiny Himalayan nation of Bhutan has sought to measure itself, not by 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), but by Gross National Happiness (GNH), calculated from the 
nation’s “four pillars” of sustainable development, environmental protection, cultural preserva-

captured global attention, although Bhutanese leaders have cautioned that pursuit of GNH

2. Americans feel a great deal of faith in the free market. Explain some of the weaknesses 
in the market. That is, where is the free market likely to fail?
3. Writing in Dissent, Joanne Barkan says, “[A]lmost all Swedes view poverty, extreme ine-
qualities of wealth, and the degradation that comes with unemployment as unacceptable.”94
a. Do you agree with the Swedes? Explain.
b. Why are Americans more tolerant of those conditions than are the Swedes?
4. Scholars Daron Acemoglu, James A. Robinson, and Thierry Verdier have argued that the 
United States would hurt world growth if it adopted the “cuddly capitalism” of  Scandinavia. 
For the United States to maintain its vital role of chief global innovator, Acemoglu and 
Verdier say that America must maintain an economic system that generously rewards suc-
cessful innovators which “implies greater inequality and greater po verty (and a weaker 
safety net) for a society encouraging innovation.”95 Do you agree? Explain.
5. a.  Should an American citizen’s primary duty be to herself or himself or to all other 
members of society? Explain.
b. Should all humans be regarded as of equal value and thus equally worthy of our 
 individual support? Explain.
c. Can social harmony be achieved in a nation whose citizens fail to regard the state as 
a “superfamily”? Explain.
6. a. In your view, is an individual’s possession of extravagant wealth a moral wrong?
b. Would economic justice require that we treat “being rich” as a social wrong? 
 Explain.

7. In questioning Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane, The Wall Street Journal 
described professional football as “socialist” and baseball as “capitalist”:
The NFL (National Football League) has been successful as a socialist league, equally 
 divvying up the league’s revenue among all the teams. Major league baseball, on the other 
hand, is a capitalist league, with a clear divide  between big-market and small- market teams.96
a. Do you think some of major league baseball’s financial rules have to be changed to 
better balance the playing field?
b. Is “socialism” or “capitalism” the better system for professional sports? Explain.
 8. In 2011, Denmark sought to improve citizen health by imposing a “fat tax” based on the 
amount of saturated fat in foods. The tax raised the price of a hamburger, for example, by 
about 40 cents.97 The tax failed and was soon repealed. Explain why the fat tax failed.
Part Five—America’s Economic Future: Where Are We Going?
How Much Government? Should we expand our faith in free market capitalism, or do 
we need to move our present mixed economy a bit closer to the welfare state model, which 
itself is under great pressure? Or must a new model emerge? In sum, how much govern-
ment do we need? To think further about those questions, let’s briefly examine some of the 
key indicators of America’s economic and social health.

Chapter One  Capitalism and the Role of Government  31
Good News Of course, Americans have a great deal to be proud of. We enjoy extraordi-
nary material comfort along with healthy, generally safe lives. As the Los Angeles Times 
reported, since 1980 the percentage of those earning $100,000 or 
more, in today’s dollars, has doubled, the average size of our 
homes has doubled in the past 50 years to about 2,200 square feet, 
and the total hours spent working have declined steadily for over 
150 years.98 We are inventive, adventuresome, free, and zealously democratic. Roughly 
half of all patents are earned by Americans, minorities now hold high-ranking political 
office, and more women than men are earning college degrees.99 Much of the world 
strives to achieve America’s blend of entrepreneurial capitalism along with intellectual 
and pop culture leadership. And we should not forget that  capitalist America is among the 
most generous of global cultures. Indeed, recent polling data ranked the United States 
first among the nations of the world in helping others (donations, volunteering, and aiding 
strangers).100
The American Dream at Risk?
America is strong but struggling. Globalization and new technology, in the short run at least, 
have chipped away at our job market. Labor unions have lost much of their power. Our 
multinational giants seem to be more interested in investing abroad than in America. 
 
The core of America—the middle class—and the very idea of the American Dream 
seem at risk. From the time the Great Recession hit bottom in mid-2009 to mid-2012, a 
period of recovery, median household income in America fell about 5 percent101 and new 
data show that the size of the middle class (annual household incomes in 2010 between 
$39,000 and $118,000 for a family of three) fell from 61 percent of all adults in 1971 to 
51 percent of all adults in 2010.102 (A portion of that change reflected Americans moving 
to the upper class.) The middle class struggle has been particularly damaging to those 
younger than 35, whose net worth, for the typica l family, fell by 68 percent between 1984 
and 2009, after adjusting for inflation.103
 
In a broad sense, should we have doubts about the top-to-bottom fairness of our Ameri-
can system? Let’s examine some concerns.
Overall Quality of Life
According to a United Nations 2013 report on overall quality of life (based on income, life 
expectancy, etc.), we are doing very well, ranking third behind Norway (1st) and Australia 
(2nd),104 but when the scores are adjusted for inequality in health, education, and income 
the United States ranks 16th in the world in overall human development behind 
Norway(1st), Australia (2nd), and Sweden (3rd), among others.105 
One score of particular note was America’s 22nd place ranking in 
gender equality where limited female roles in politics and relatively 
poor maternal health reduce the American performance.106
 
In general, the United States ranks well on standard economic measures and not so well on 
standard social measures. Our 2012 estimated GDP per capita of $50,700 ranked 14th in the 
world behind smaller, more specialized economies such as Qatar (1st at $103,900 and 
America’s 22nd place 
ranking in gender equality.
Americans have a great deal 
to be proud of.

N orway (9th at $55,900) and well ahead of our chief industrial rivals such as Germany (29th 
at $39,700) and Japan (38th at $36,900).107
 
In 2013 estimated life expectancy, on the other hand, the United States ranked 51st at an 
estimated 78.62 years while Japan, for example, ranked 3rd at an estimated 84.19 years.108 
Among the most discouraging U.S. performances is in the category of infant mortality (the 
probability of dying between birth and age one per 1,000 live births) 
where 50 nations do a better job of keeping babies alive than we 
do.109 For some years, the United States has led the world in pro-
ducing prisoners, but the U.S. prison population declined in 2012 
for the third straight year.110 On the other hand, violent crime rose in 
2012 for the first time since 2006.111
 
Some trends portend a worrisome future. The United States ranks fifth in the world in 
total spending for education, but young adult college completion rates have fallen to 14th 
globally, national K–12 test scores are only middling by international norms, and just half 
of 3-year-olds are enrolled in preschool (as compared with 90 percent in France, Italy, and 
Norway).112 Family structures are changing dramatically. A record 40 percent of house-
holds with children under 18 include a mother who is either the sole or primary source of 
income with two-thirds of those being single mothers.113 Marriage itself is in d ecline, par-
ticularly among those who are not well educated.114 The economically and socially produc-
tive institution of marriage with children apparently is becoming a sort of luxury item for 
growing numbers of middle Americans.115
Poverty
Four out of five U.S. adults, for at least a part of their lives, are on welfare, unemployed, or 
facing near poverty, according to a 2013 study.116 Fifteen percent of Americans fall below the 
official government poverty line ($23,021 for a family of four in 2011), but that number un-
derstates the magnitude of the problem.117 Economic insecurity is spreading throughout the 
country, increasingly reaching white families and pressing even those in the upper half of 
America’s income stream as median debt levels have increased and median net worth has 
fallen.118 America’s children are particularly at risk. A 2013 United Nations study of the well-
being (material goods, education, etc.) of children in 29 of the world’s “rich” countries 
ranked the United States 26th, just ahead of Lithuania, Latvia, and Romania with northern 
European countries at the top of the list.119 The result of these dismal economic conditions is 
that poor people, as commentator Paul Krugman explained, live in a separate America:
Living in or near poverty has always been a form of exile, of being cut off from the larger 
society. . . . To be poor in America today, even more than in the past, is to be an outcast in 
your own country.120
 Of course, America’s poorer people live better than the bulk of the citizens of the world, 
but the struggle is quite real, nonetheless. Even those who are employed often live a peril-
ous life on the edge of collapse, as BusinessWeek explained:
[M]ost (of the working poor) labor in a netherworld of maximum insecurity, where one 
missed bus, one stalled engine, one sick kid means the difference between keeping a job and 
getting fired, between subsistence and setting off the financial tremors of turned-off tele-
phones and $1,000 emergency-room bills. . . .121
The United States has led
the world in producing 
prisoners.

Historically we have accepted difficulties for a significant share of the population in the 
belief they would move up if they worked hard. Unfortunately, those prospects seem to be 
dimming. As Forbes recently reported, many of the fastest growing jobs (e.g., health aid, 
tradespeople, assistants/helpers) do not pay well and most do not 
require a college education.122 Thus, many Americans lead surpris-
ingly harsh lives, and their prospects for the future are not as bright 
as the American Dream suggests.
Most do not require a college 
education.
Pets or People?
We may not take the best care of our disadvantaged fellow Americans, but we seem to be 
unstinting in generosity toward our pets. Americans in 2011 spent nearly $61 billion on 
their pets, a sum that exceeds the gross domestic product of all but about 70 nations. 
Question
Would our money for pets be more wisely spent on impoverished children? Explain.

[http://www.photius.com/rankings/economy/gdp_official_exchange_rate_2013_0.html]
The Gaps
Extravagant wealth, side-by-side with punishing poverty, is perhaps the greatest disap-
pointment and injustice, from the critics’ point of view, in the global advance of capitalist 
principles.
 
The wealthiest 1 percent of Americans now have a greater collective net worth than the 
bottom 90 percent.123 The six heirs of Walmart founder, Sam Walton, have as much wealth 
as the bottom 100 million Americans.124 The wealth gap is not surprising when we note 
that the incomes of the upper 1 percent of households rose nearly 20 percent in 2012 com-
pared to a 1 percent increase for the bottom 99 percent.125 Income inequality in the United 
States is the largest among Western industrialized countries.126 Furthermore, although 
many Americans do move up and down the income and wealth ladders, the odds of climb-
ing are now lower in the United States than in almost all developed nations.127 We should 
note, however, that the rich–poor gap has been growing in most industrial nations, includ-
ing the Scandinavian states.128
 
Average CEO pay has risen from about 20 times the average worker’s pay in 1965 to 
about 273 times today (down from a high of 383 in 2000).129 Hedge fund manager John 
Paulson earned an estimated $5 billion in 2010, perhaps the biggest investment killing in 
history.130 To put his stunning income in perspective, $5 billion would allow him, for ex-
ample, to nearly pay the full operating costs for the Chicago public schools (with more 
than 41,000 employees and over 400,000 students) for a year.131 [For a discussion of recent 
research challenging the mainstream findings on income inequality, see Thomas B. Edsall, 
“What If We’re Looking at Inequality the Wrong Way?” The New York Times, June 26, 
2013 at http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/]

Community
Thus we see that American capitalism, despite its extraordinary success, is criticized for 
problems of poverty, inequality, and unfairness, among others. Perhaps the more interest-
ing concern, however, is mounting evidence that our lives are increasingly solitary, distant, 
alone, and unshared. The market is driven by and rewards individual achievement. Could 
that struggle for success be depriving us of the full satisfaction of our humanity? A 2006 
study found that even trivial exposure to money changes our goals 
and behaviors such that our sense of self-sufficiency is elevated and 
our social interests may decline,132 whereas a 2008 study showed 
that how people spend their money may be just as important in hap-
piness as how much money they have. Specifically, the study dem-
onstrated that spending money on  others rather than on oneself 
produced greater levels of happiness.133
 
Whether a product of capitalist impulses or not, we do have evidence of declining so-
cial connections. Only 30 percent of Americans, according to a 2008 study, report a close 
confidant at work, down from nearly 50 percent in 1985, and workers in many other na-
tions are much more likely to have close friends at work than are Americans. American 
workers report inviting 32 percent of their “close” colleagues to 
their homes, while Polish and Indian workers report inviting more 
than double that percentage.134 More worrisome perhaps are find-
ings from a 2011 study where Americans reported an average of 
only two discussion confidants in their lives, down from a mean of 
three in 1985. That decline, however, could reflect a shrinking in those whom we classify 
as suitable for an important discussion rather than an actual reduction in our number of 
close friends.135
Spending money on others 
rather than on oneself 
produced greater levels 
of happiness.
Americans reported only 
two discussion confidants in 
their lives.
What forces have caused the growing income and 
wealth gaps in America? Libertarian scholar Charles 
Murray in his controversial book, Coming Apart: The 
State of White America, 1960–2010 looks at the blue-
collar, white working class for some answers. He points 
to declining moral values in that group as a crucial fac-
tor in American inequality and reduced mobility. He pro-
vides evidence of an alarming fall in white working-class 
social capital (neighborliness and civic engagement) 
prompted by decreasing industry, community, religion, 
and marriage. Murray does not ignore similar problems 
in the black working class, but his focus is on white 
people. 
Questions
1. Do you agree with Murray that the erosion of traditional 
middle-class morals/values helps explain inequality in 
contemporary America?
2. What other forces might have contributed to increasing 
inequality in American life?
3. Based on your personal sense of fairness, is a large 
and growing gap in income and wealth in America an 
ethical wrong? Explain.

The Moral Decline of White 
Working-Class America?

Chapter One  Capitalism and the Role of Government  35
Declining Social Capital?
In his now famous book, Bowling Alone, Robert Putnam meticulously documented the 
decline of what he labeled social capital, the community and commitment bonds that 
seem to emerge in a culture where people regularly interact with one another.136 Put-
nam’s book explains that virtually every measure of social interaction, from voting to 
picnics to playing cards, to church attendance, to membership in social clubs fell sig-
nificantly from roughly 1975 to 2000. The most vivid example was a decline of 40 per-
cent in league bowling from 1980 to 2000 although the total number of bowlers 
increased by about 10 percent; thus the notion of “bowling alone.” Even the tradition 
of inviting others to visit one’s home as dinner guests fell by about 40 percent. Criti-
cism of Putnam’s thesis was abundant with many saying he focused too much on 
“older” activities such as social clubs and not enough on emerging interests such as 
Internet groups.137
 
Putnam’s more recent research has produced no convincing evidence of rising commu-
nity engagement among adults, but he acknowledges they are reaching one another in dif-
ferent ways from the past, principally through social media.138 In contrast to Putnam’s 
discouraging assessment, Americans say they trust their neighbors (76 percent) and talk 
with them frequently (44 percent); these self-reported measures of neighborliness have 
been rising recently.139 
An Opportunity Gap and Declining Community? 
Putnam has for the last few years been collecting data about the growing gap in opportuni-
ties among socioeconomic classes of American children. In decades past, parents with high 
school educations invested money and time in their children at much the same level as 
college-graduate parents, but today a large gap has grown in both resources, favoring, of 
course, the more affluent families. Specifically, the more comfortable class of children 
receive about one hour per day more time with their parents than do less  advantaged chil-
dren. A generation ago, Putnam says, participation in extracurricular activities varied little 
by social class, but today participation has risen sharply for affluent children while falling 
sharply among those less well-off. One of the results of this opportunity divide is that chil-
dren of the well-off express increasing trust in those around them while that trust has “col-
lapsed” among the less well-off children.140 
 
Likewise, young products of affluent America have steadily deepened their community 
engagement (going to church more, better connecting to their parents, volunteering) 
while the less affluent young whites have withdrawn or never undertaken that engage-
ment. That disparity in involvement is not present among young blacks, but the overall 
engagement gap between whites and blacks is wide.141
Questions
1. Is Putnam correct about (a) declining social capital in America and (b) a growing op-
portunity gap between affluent and less well-off children? Explain.
2. American Dan Lawton commenting on his first trip to Africa:
In Ghana, I have danced, eaten, and spoken with more strangers in six weeks than I 
would have in America in six years, And this paradox—that despite its material wealth

and technological might America is so standoffish and lonely—has been burning a hole 
in my head.142
a. Do you agree that Americans are “standoffish and lonely”?
b.  If so, do you have any explanation for that condition?
Since publishing Bowling Alone, Robert Putnam has said 
we need to develop new kinds of connections when old 
ones die. Electronic links often are considered part of the 
problem, but he believes they could also be part of the 
 solution. Indeed, a 2008 survey of American adults found 
60 percent saying that new technologies had not affected 
the closeness of their families and a 2011 study found that 
self-reported feelings of empathy were higher among col-
lege students the more time they spent on Facebook. On 
the other hand, a 2009 Pew report found that social net-
working users are 26 percent less likely than others to turn 
to their neighbors for companionship. MIT professor 
Sherry Turkle says we have sacrificed conversation for 
“mere connection”:
We’ve become accustomed to a new way of being 
“along together.” Technology-enabled, we are able to 
be with one another, and also elsewhere, connected to 
wherever we want to be. We want to cust omize our 
lives. We want to move in and out of where we are 
because the thing we value most is control over where 
we focus our attention.”143
Questions
1. In your view, is Turkle correct? Explain.
2. How might our ethical standards and performances be 
affected by excessive reliance on social technology?

Technology and Loneliness
Too Much Capitalism? Or Too Little?
Has America placed too much faith in the market and too little in government? Is the alleged 
decline in community in some sense a product of capitalism itself? Are poverty, inequality, 
crime, and the Wall Street collapse inevitable by-products of a “selfish, greedy” market? 
Even some conservatives are concerned:
“What I’m concerned about is the idolatry of the market,” says conservative intellectual 
William Bennett, a former education secretary and author of The Book of Virtues. He worries 
particularly that the market for popular music and movies with sexual or 
violent content has a corrosive effect. “Unbridled capitalism . . . may not 
be a problem for production and for expansion of the economic pie, but 
it’s a problem for human beings. It’s a problem for . . . the realm of 
 values and human relationships.”144
The dilemma, in brief, was expressed by a 20-year-old Cuban student and communist 
organizer: “Capitalism is more efficient . . . But it is not more fair.”145
 
Can robust capitalism be sustained if it produces not just efficiency and growth but also 
extreme income and wealth gaps, corruption, and injustice? Can we tolerate capitalism’s 
“Capitalism is more 
 efficient . . . But it is not 
more fair.”

Chapter One  Capitalism and the Role of Government  37
collapses and injustices? Can we improve the market through judicious regulation? Or 
must we look for new answers? 
A “Remix” Needed?
Clearly, we have had at least a free market detour in the United States. The government 
has stepped in to bail out a failing economy. Does that shift to the left signal the sharp 
decline of markets? Almost certainly not. According to a 2013 nationwide Marist Poll, 
55 percent of Americans favor free enterprise and fear expanded government regulation of 
business.146 Perhaps some form of “re-mix” is needed. Journalist Anatole  Kaletsky re-
minds us that capitalism is adaptive, reinventing itself through crises.147 Scholar Robert 
Skidelsky, in reviewing Kaletsky’s 2010 book, Capitalism 4.0: The Birth of a New Econ-
omy,148 summarized Kaletsky’s view of the evolution of capitalism:
Laissez-faire Capitalism 1.0, inspired by Adam Smith, lasted from the Napoleonic wars to 
the First World War, the Russian Revolution and the mass unemployment of the 1930s. Then 
came the Capitalism 2.0 of John Maynard Keynes, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal and 
the welfare state, which eventually provoked Capitalism 3.0 in the 1970s in reaction to rising 
inflation. Capitalism 3.0, a modified return to laissez-faire, has just self-destructed, leaving 
the door open to Capitalism 4.0.149
Kaletsky thinks his Capitalism 4.0 should involve smaller, smarter governments, less reli-
ance on theory, and greater recognition of the need for pragmatic change.
A New World Consensus?
Notwithstanding Kaletsky’s hope for a more rational market–government balance, other 
thinkers say the world is already reshaping itself into two conflicting forms of capitalism. 
 
In his book The End of the Free Market,150 political scientist Ian Bremmer says capi-
talism may have established its claim as the best economic system, but the world is still 
in conflict over whether Western capitalism is the best political-social-economic sys-
tem. As New York Times columnist David Brooks explained in reviewing Bremmer’s 
work, the world now seems to be divided into a pair of general camps. Democratic 
capitalism in the United States, Japan, Denmark, and other nations favors business to 
create wealth and government to regulate as needed. State capitalism in countries such 
as China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia employ the market to build wealth, which, in turn, is 
controlled and distributed by the state for its political purposes. As we saw in our dis-
cussion above of China and Russia, state capitalism varies in its practices across na-
tions, but private enterprise, state-owned corporations, and sovereign wealth funds 
(huge aggregations of capital controlled by the government for investment purposes) all 
may play a role. The two systems trade with each other for mutual advantage but are 
economic and political rivals.151
 
We do not know what comes next, of course, but Oxford University professor Timothy 
Garton Ash sees the likelihood, in the short term at least, of a fractured, somewhat con-
flicted world:
The result? Not a uni-polar world, converging on a single model of liberal democratic 
capitalism, but a no-polar world, diverging toward many different national versions of often 
illiberal capitalism. Not a new world order but a new world disorder. . . .152

Questions—Part Five
1. As you see it, is Western democratic capitalism or state capitalism more likely to pre-
vail over the long term? Explain.
2. Roger Cohen, writing in The New York Times, made the interesting point that India, as 
of 2010, had more cell phones than toilets; 563.7 million people connected to modern 
communication, but only 366 million had access to modern sanitation. He says this 
imbalance could be seen as “skewed development” favoring private goods over public 
necessities. In India and in America, he sees a kind of schizophrenia where we are in-
creasingly autonomous, wanting to be left alone; our technology connecting us, allow-
ing us to feel no need for government until a crisis, like the recent meltdown, arrives. 
Then many desperately plead for the government to save us.153
a.  Are we giving too much attention to private needs and too little, via government and 
taxes, to public goods? Explain.
b.  Can we have an autonomous, free market culture, substantially contemptuous of 
government, and still maintain a stable, healthy, and fair national and global com-
munity? Explain.
3. a.  Is America deliberately seeking to convert the balance of the globe to American, free 
market, democratic values?
b.  Would all nations be well served if they adopted American, free market, democratic 
values? Explain.
4. In what ways might American culture be viewed as offensive and threatening to 
Muslims and others around the globe?
Individualism Up, Morality Down?
Scholars now have access to a giant Google database of 5.2 million books published be-
tween 1500 and 2008. They can type in a word and see how frequently it has been used 
over the years. One study looking at 1960 to 2008 found individualistic words (e.g., self, 
standout, unique) were used more frequently over those 48 years whereas communal 
words (e.g., collective, common good, band together) declined in use. Another study found 
that general moral terms (e.g., virtue, decency, conscience) and words associated with 
moral excellence (e.g., honesty, patience, compassion) receded in use over the course of 
the 20th century.
Questions
1. Do you see a link between increasing attention to individualism and declining attention 
to morality? Explain.
2. Do you think government can or should do anything about these changing social condi-
tions and the link between them, if it does exist? Explain.

problem of capitalist economies is that almost no one fully trusts capitalists.”154
a. Do you agree? Why?
b. Do you think free market capitalism is the best economic system? Explain.
c. Do you think that multinational companies have more power than national govern-
ments? Explain.
 3. a.  In your mature years, do you expect to be as wealthy as your parents, or more so? 
Explain.
b. Do you think you deserve to be as wealthy as your parents, or more so, or less so? 
Explain.
 4. According to a 2011 Congressional Budget Office study, the share of government 
benefits going to the bottom fifth of Americans has declined from 54 percent in 
1979 to 36 percent in 2007.155 According to the conservative Tax Foundation, in 
2010, 60 percent of Americans were receiving more in government benefits than 
they paid in taxes.156 (Of course, many of those people paid higher taxes in subse-
quent years.) 
a. Other than aid to those who are poor, disabled and/or aged, what government ben-
efit programs are you aware of that provide support to working and middle-class 
Americans? 
 b. Do you think it is “fair” that more than half of Americans receive more in govern-
ment benefits than they pay in taxes? Explain. 
 5. a.  Noted economist Lester Thurow argued that the economic demands of the market 
are destroying the traditional two-parent, nuclear family. Explain his argument.
b. Child development authority Benjamin Spock likewise blamed capitalism for the 
“destruction of the American family,” but his reasoning differed from Thurow’s:
The overriding problem is excessive competition and our glorification of it. It may 
 contribute to our rapid technological advancement, but it has done so at a great 
price. We are taught to be rugged individualists, and we are obsessed with getting 
ahead. The family gets lost in this intense struggle. In a healthy society, family 
should come first, community second, and our outside jobs third. In this country, 
it is the other way around.157
 
 Comment.
c. If Spock was correct, how did we reach this condition?
 6. Scholar Donna Wood points to America’s poor showing in Gallup’s emotional well-
being polls of 150 countries that find the United States 68th in sadness, 75th in anger,

89th in worry, and 145th in stress (150th being the lowest ranking). Wood also points 
to America’s poor showing in health and other measures of social well-being and asks 
why America scores so poorly on these measures.158 What do you think?
 7. We often read that many college professors actively criticize capitalism and support 
welfare state principles.
a. Has that been your experience? Explain.
b. If that assessment is accurate, how do you account for the leftist inclinations among 
intellectuals?
 8. Should we reduce the government’s presence throughout our lives? Consider a couple 
of possibilities.
a. Facing severe financial problems, the state of Nevada was thinking of expanding 
legal prostitution from its current rural areas to the gambling centers, Las Vegas 
and Reno. Do you think legal prostitution managed by the market but subject to 
reasonable health and safety regulation would be a good policy for your state or any 
state? Explain.
b. The bitter, ongoing debate about same-sex marriage raises the question of whether 
the state’s role in marriage should be eliminated. Explain why the state should or 
should not be involved in regulating marriage. See “Why Do We Need the State’s 
Permission to Get Married Anyway?” The Wall Street Journal, January 14, 2010 
[http://blogs.wsj.com/2010/01/14/why-do-we-need-to-ask-the-state-for-permission
-to-get-married-anyway/].
 9. If we are fundamentally selfish, must we embrace capitalism as the most accurate and, 
therefore, most efficient expression of human nature? Explain.
 10. About 57 percent of college students are female. In 2010, 36 percent of women in their 
late 20s had earned a bachelor’s degree, as compared with about 27.8 percent of males 
of the same age.159 How do you explain those gaps and what, if a nything, do they por-
tend for the future of America? 
 11. New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof wrote what he called a “blunt” and 
 “politically incorrect truth” about global poverty:
It’s that if the poorest families spent as much money educating their children as they 
do on wine, cigarettes and prostitutes, their children’s children’s prospects would be 
transformed.160
He told about one Congolese family that is eight months behind on its $6 per month 
rent and is unable to pay for mosquito netting ($6 each) or the $2.50 per month school 
tuition for each of their three school-age children. But the parents do spend $10 per 
month on cell phone expenses, and the father does drink several times weekly at a cost 
of about $1 per night.161
a. What solutions would you suggest to protect children from the ill-advised financial 
choices of their fathers and mothers?
b. Do you think poor parental choices are a significant feature of child suffering in the 
United States? Explain.
c. Do you think reduced government in the United States would likely lead to in-
creased personal responsibility? Explain.

Chapter One  Capitalism and the Role of Government  41
 12. Commentator Thomas Friedman reflects on the Islamic terrorists’ hatred for America:
Their constant refrain is that America is a country with wealth and power but “no values.” 
The Islamic terrorists think our wealth and power is unrelated to anything in the soul of this 
country. . . . Of course, what this view of America completely misses is that American power 
and wealth flow directly from a deep spiritual source—a spirit of respect for the individual, 
a spirit of tolerance for differences of faith or politics, a respect for freedom of thought as 
the necessary foundation for all creativity, and a spirit of unity that encompasses all kinds 
of differences. Only a society with a deep spiritual energy, that welcomes immigrants and 
worships freedom, could constantly renew itself and its sources of power and wealth.162
a. Do you agree that the “spiritual source” Friedman cites is the foundation for American 
success? Explain.
b. Is America without a meaningful “soul”? Explain.
 13. a.  Make the argument that America’s free market economy is better for children than 
the welfare state approach in northern Europe.
b. Do you think that argument is correct? That is, do you think children are better off 
in America’s free market or in northern Europe’s welfare state? Explain.
 14. The intellectual Adolph Berle once said, “A day may come when national glory and 
prestige, perhaps even national safety, are best established by a country’s being the most 
beautiful, the best socially organized, or culturally the most advanced in the world.”163
a. Is government intervention necessary to achieving Berle’s goal? Explain.
b. If faced with a choice, would most Americans opt for Berle’s model or for a nation 
preeminent in consumer goods, sports, and general comfort? Explain.
 15. Marketing research firm GfK Roper and policy advisor Simon Anholt annually rank 
the 50 most admired nations globally. The United States has ranked at the top of that 
list in recent years. Their research shows that we can think of countries as being either 
primarily useful (competent, efficient, smart) or primarily decorative (stylish, sexy, 
attractive) or both.164
a. List some nations that you take to be primarily useful and some that you believe to 
be primarily decorative. Which do you prefer?
b. Do you regard the United States as primarily useful or primarily decorative or both? 
Explain.
 16. Benjamin Barber, writing in The Atlantic, saw two possible political futures, which he 
labeled the “forces of Jihad” and the “forces of McWorld”:
The first is a retribalization of large swaths of humankind by war and bloodshed . . . 
 culture is pitted against culture, people against people, tribe against tribe—a Jihad in the 
name of a hundred narrowly conceived faiths against every kind of interdependence. . . . 
The second is being borne in on us by the onrush of economic and ecological forces that 
demand integration and uniformity and that mesmerize the world with fast music, fast 
computers, and fast food—with MTV, Macintosh, and McDonald’s pressing nations 
into one commercially homogeneous global network: One McWorld tied together by 
technology, ecology, communications, and commerce.165
a. Does either of these scenarios make sense to you? Explain.
b. Which would you prefer? Explain.

 17. Critics argue that socialism requires a uniformity, a “sameness” that would destroy the 
individuality Americans prize.
a. Are Americans notably independent and individualistic? Explain.
b. Explore the argument that socialism would actually enhance meaningful individualism.
 18. Hilda Scott wrote a book to which she affixed the provocative title Does Socialism 
Liberate Women?
a. Answer her question. Explain.
b. Are minority oppression and oppression of women inevitable by-products of capi-
talism? Explain.
 19. In Wisconsin, members of the Old Order Amish religion declined to formally educate 
their children beyond the eighth grade. The U.S. Supreme Court held that their First 
Amendment right to freedom of religion was violated by the Wisconsin compulsory 
education statute, which required school attendance until the age of 16. Chief Justice 
Burger explained:
They object to the high school, and higher education generally, because the values they 
teach are in marked variance with Amish values and the Amish way of life; they view 
secondary school education as an impermissible exposure of their children to a “worldly” 
influence in conflict with their beliefs. The high school tends to emphasize intellectual 
and scientific accomplishments, self-distinction, competitiveness, worldly success, and 
social life with other students. Amish society emphasizes informal learning-through-
doing; a life of “goodness,” rather than a life of intellect; wisdom, rather than technical 
knowledge; community welfare, rather than competition; and separation from, rather 
than integration with, contemporary worldly society.166
a. Have the Amish taken the course we should all follow? Explain.
b. Could we do so? Explain.
 20. Distinguished economist Gary Becker argued for a free market approach to America’s 
immigration difficulties:
In a market economy, the way to deal with excess demand for a product or service is 
to raise the price. This reduces the demand and stimulates the supply. I suggest that the 
United States adopt a similar approach to help solve its immigration problems. Under 
my proposal, anyone willing to pay a specified price could enter the United States 
 immediately.167
 
 Comment.
 21. Management scholars Rabindra Kanungo and Jay Conger remark that “‘Altruism’ is a 
word rarely associated with the world of business,” but they ask, “Does altruism have 
a place in our business lives? And does it make good economic sense?”168 Answer 
their questions.

Part One—Introduction to Ethics
Can we count on self-regulation (ethics) as a useful means of controlling managerial/ 
corporate behavior? Put another way, can we count on the free market as discussed in 
Chapter 1, along with managerial and corporate ethics, to guide business conduct such that 
government regulation (law) can be significantly reduced?
 
This chapter will examine the ethical climate of business and the role of ethics in busi-
ness decision making. Our goal here is not to teach morality but to sensitize the reader to 
the vital role honor plays in building a sound career and a responsible life.

Chapter Two  Business Ethics  51
The Financial Crisis: A Corporate Scandal?
Corporate misconduct has been a staple of the news in this 21st century. The nation’s (and 
the world’s) ongoing financial crisis, the most threatening since the Great Depression, 
 appears to have been the product of a variety of forces including inadequate government 
regulation, dangerously easy credit, overextended borrowers, real estate speculation, greed, 
and a collapsed housing market (for more, see Chapter 8). The facts may never be fully 
clear, but the International Monetary Fund has estimated that worldwide losses attributable 
to the U.S. residential and commercial real estate market collapse at about one trillion 
 dollars or $142 per person in the entire world.4 The larger financial recession that 
 accompanied the real estate collapse resulted in additional trillions in losses in the United 
States alone.5 The portion of those losses attributable to fraudulent and unethical transac-
tions produced, in part, by the kind of pressure that Maggie Hardiman faced will never be 
known. Of course, no law is broken when lenders merely show poor judgment or borrowers are 
unable to pay, but the subprime collapse allegedly involved intentionally fraudulent schemes.
Too Big to Jail? 
As of this writing in 2013, one of the continuing frustrations of the 2008 financial meltdown 
and the widespread financial misconduct of recent years is the fact that America’s big banks 
have been largely untouched by criminal prosecution. Money laundering, mortgage fraud, 
foreclosure fraud, big rigging, and more have been discovered, but prosecutions have not 
followed. In fairness we note that tens of billions of dollars in settlements and civil penalties 
have been achieved. For example, in 2013, JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $13 billion to 
settle federal civil charges directed to questionable mortgage practices including allegations 
that the bank had failed to tell investors what it knew of the risks associated with some of its 
Maggie Hardiman cringed as she heard the salesmen 
knocking the sides of desks with a baseball bat as they 
walked through her office. Bang! Bang “‘You cut my 
[expletive] deal!’” she recalls one man yelling at her. 
“‘You can’t do that.’” Bang! The bat whacked the top 
of her desk.1
Hardiman was an appraiser for New Century Financial in 
2004 and 2005. Her job was to weed out bad mortgage 
 applications. She says most of the applications she re-
viewed had problems, but if she turned them down, “all 
hell would break loose” and “her bosses often overruled 
her and found another appraiser to sign off on it.” She 
says the pressure to approve loans was immense: “The 
stress in the place was ungodly. It was like selling your 
soul.” Hardiman says she was fired for refusing to approve 
weak loans.2
 
New Century was the nation’s leading specialized sub-
prime mortgage lender in 2006 with $51.6 billion in loans. To 
achieve that volume, New Century and others often sold 
subprime mortgages with “teaser” adjustable rates to 
Americans with poor credit. Then when housing values 
 began to fall and adjustable rates went up, many new 
homeowners were unable to make their payments. New 
Century filed for bankruptcy protection in 2007, laid off over 
5,000 employees, and admitted it underreported the number 
of bad loans it had made.3
Question
Do you think the pressure to produce—to approve weak 
loan applications in this instance—that Maggie Hardiman 
says she faced is routine in American business practice, or 
was this episode an exception to the norm? Explain.

mortgage-backed securities. The settlement is the largest sum a single firm has ever agreed 
to pay the government, but it amounts to only about one-half of Chase’s profits for a year, 
and the bank says over half of the settlement will be tax deductible. The bank did not admit 
to a violation of the law, and criminal charges are yet possible. 
 
At this writing, however, criminal action against the big banks has not been broadly 
achieved. Why? Proving criminal wrongdoing “beyond a reasonable doubt”— and particu-
larly proving the required intent to commit a crime—are daunting burdens. Thus, the gov-
ernment often leaves the wrongdoing to regulators who can pursue civil causes of action 
with their more modest standard of proof. Bigger policy considerations, however, are also 
influencing the government’s policy. U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder may have re-
cently revealed the reasons behind the federal government’s seeming reluctance to act:
I am concerned that the size of some of these institutions becomes so large that it does 
 become difficult for us to prosecute them when we are hit with indications that if we do 
 prosecute—if we do bring a criminal charge—it will have a negative impact on the national 
economy, perhaps even the world economy. . . . I think that is a function of the fact that some 
of these institutions have become too large.6
Holder later said he had been misconstrued and that no bank is too big to prosecute. In any 
case, the government moves very carefully against giants in banking and industry. Indeed, 
the lesson of Arthur Andersen, the venerable public accounting firm that was put out of 
business on obstruction of justice charges during the Enron bankruptcy of the early 2000s, 
is made more sobering by the 28,000 jobs that were lost. Most of those who lost their jobs 
at Arthur Andersen had nothing to do with the alleged wrongdoing, and the Arthur 
 Andersen conviction was later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court. Of course, the gov-
ernment can and does pursue individuals engaging in Wall Street fraud. Powerful finan-
ciers such as Bernie Madoff, Allen Stanford, and Raj Rajaratnam have been sentenced to 
long jail terms, and the government has become increasingly  aggressive in some areas of 
prosecution such as insider  trading (see Chapter 9). Still, some sense of justice unfulfilled 
accompanies the continuing economic pain of the financial collapse.
Nonetheless, Wall Street’s ethical reputation, if not its criminal record, clearly has been 
undermined. Nearly 70 percent of Americans say “most” of those on Wall Street would be 
willing to break the law to make “a lot of money” if they felt they 
could get away with it.7 Warren Buffet’s long-time investments part-
ner, Charlie Munger, was particularly condemnatory in his assessment 
of Wall Street: “The whole damn industry lost its moral moorings.”8
“The whole damn industry 
lost its moral moorings.”
A Conscience at Goldman Sachs?
“It makes me ill how callously people still talk about ripping off clients,” mid level 
 Goldman Sachs executive Greg Smith wrote in The New York Times as he was resigning 
from the firm in 2012. Smith’s commentary, “Why I Am Leaving Goldman Sachs,” 
claimed that the Goldman Sachs culture had become “toxic,” and that the “interests of the 
client continue to be sidelined in the way the firm operates and thinks about making 
money.” Smith, 33, a Stanford graduate and finalist for a Rhodes scholarship, wrote that he

A Pattern of Abuse
Of course, the subprime mortgage crisis was not the first instance of morally unhinged corpo-
rate conduct. We give lengthier attention to corporate crime later in the chapter, but for now we 
should put the subprime scandal in context by remembering some of the most prominent corpo-
rate and white-collar missteps of recent years. The subprime scandal is reminiscent of the 
savings and loan crisis of the 1980s when $150 billion evaporated, in part because of 
criminal behavior. The corporate greed of the Enron era played out on worldwide tele-
visions as some of the great titans of American commerce shuffled off to prison. Tyco 
Chief Executive Officer Dennis  Kozlowski is infamous for his $2 million birthday bash 
for his wife on Sardinia and his $6,000 shower curtain. Kozlowski, currently serving up 
to 25 years in prison on charges of looting millions from Tyco, 
reportedly begged in 2012 for parole but was denied.9 Most 
breathtaking was Bernard Madoff’s colossal Ponzi scheme that 
stole as much as $65 billion (in paper gains) before Madoff was caught and sent to prison in 
2009 on a sentence of 150 years. [For a comprehensive archive of the  Enron story, see http:
//archive.wn.com/2007/12/23/1400/enronfiles]
His $6,000 shower curtain.
was once proud of Goldman Sachs’s culture of teamwork, integrity, humility, and concern 
for clients, but that spirit, he said, had been lost. 
 
Goldman Sachs says that regular employee feedback contradicts Smith’s characteriza-
tions. Critics say Smith was angry because he had been denied a promotion and raise prior 
to his departure. Others simply saw Smith as naïve. One Goldman client told The New 
York Times that the company had traded against its clients for years. “Come on, that is 
what they do and they are good traders, so I do business with them.” And a Bloomberg 
editorial satirized Smith’s view that the firm was too concerned about making money:
If you want to dedicate your life to serving humanity, do not go to work for  Goldman 
Sachs. That’s not its function, and it never will be. Go to work for  Goldman Sachs if 
you wish to work hard and get paid more than you deserve even so. . . .
Questions
1. A friend of Smith’s characterized his resignation and public condemnation of Goldman 
Sachs as the “ultimate act of loyalty.” What did he mean?
2. a. What did Smith mean when he spoke of Goldman Sachs’s “culture”? 
 
b. In seeking a job after graduation, will you be looking for a company whose 
“ culture” matches your values? Explain. 
 
c. Do you think you would give up the approximately $500,000 per year that Smith 
reportedly was making because your employer’s culture was not consistent with your 
values? Explain.
3. a. Should Goldman Sachs’s purpose be service to humanity? 
 
b. Would that approach work in the marketplace? Explain.

Of course, we should not condemn the American business community based on the 
misconduct of some. The problems are serious, but former General Electric CEO Jack 
Welch and his wife, Suzy, remind us that the business community is the source of much of 
America’s greatness:
Business is a huge source of vitality in the world and a noble enterprise. Thriving, decent 
 companies are everywhere, and they should be celebrated. They create jobs and opportunities, 
provide revenue for government, and are the foundation of a free and democratic society. . . .10
Ethics Survey
We can see that executive wrongdoing has been a significant problem in recent years, but 
what about questionable employee behavior? Should some commonplace worker practices 
be considered unethical? The Ethics Officer Association and the Ethical Leadership Group 
sampled a cross section of workers at large companies nationwide. How would you respond?
1. “Is it wrong to use company e-mail for personal reasons?”
2. “Is it wrong to play computer games on office equipment during the workday?”
3. “Is it OK to take a $100 holiday food basket?”
4. “Due to on-the-job pressure, have you ever abused or lied about sick days?”

America’s Moral Climate
Perhaps more than ever, Americans are questioning the nation’s moral health. Spec-
tacular corporate corruption as noted above, steroid use by professional athletes, an 
economy seemingly permanently tilted toward the rich, government officials paying 
more attention to reelection than to the general welfare, sexual abuse of children by 
clerics and teachers, and so on cause us to question our decency as a society. Gallup’s 
2012 poll of American values and beliefs found 73 percent of respondents saying that 
our moral values are deteriorating and a 2013 NBC poll showed that 43 percent of 
Americans believe “a decline in moral values” is the number-one source of our prob-
lems as a nation (50 percent said that economic pressures are the principal source of our 
problems as a nation).11
 
Sociologist David Callahan’s book The Cheating Culture: Why More Americans Are 
Doing Wrong to Get Ahead argues that we are a society in moral decline.12 The result of 
this winner-take-all ethos, Callahan thinks, is a nation increasingly falling into two groups: 
a “winning class” who cheated their way to the top and an “anxious class” who fear falling 
behind if they too do not cheat.13
 
Cheating, in one form or another, does seem to be routine in American life. But we find 
a glimmer of good news in scholar Dan Ariely’s 2012 book The (Honest) Truth about Dis-
honesty: How We Lie to Everyone—Especially Ourselves, which shows, through a serious 
of experiments, that almost all of us cheat, but most of us cheat only a little.14 We may be 

Chapter Two  Business Ethics  55
further pleased to learn that wealthier people, according to a 2012 study, cheat more than 
poorer people as revealed in a series of experiments:
People driving expensive cars were more likely than other motorists to cut off drivers and 
pedestrians at a four-way-stop intersection in the San Francisco Bay area, . . . researchers ob-
served. Those findings led to a series of experiments that revealed that people of higher so-
cioeconomic status were also more likely to cheat to win a prize, take candy from children 
and say they would pocket extra change handed to them in error rather than give it back.15
 
The study also found that wealthier people were more likely to condone unethical con-
duct and to value greed. We should note, however, that the study has been criticized for 
alleged methodological problems.16
 
Do you think Callahan is correct: Is America in moral decline? Or are we basically 
good people who tend to cheat only a little, as Ariely found? [For the Josephson Institute 
of Ethics, see http://www.josephsoninstitute.org]
Sex or Cell Phone?
Cell phone practices may offer some insights about what we value most in life. Consider 
these recent study results:
• A 2013 survey found more than twice as many Americans were willing to give up sex 
for a week as to give up their cell phones. Men ages 18 to 34 were least willing to give 
up sex; five times less likely than women of the same age. The latter favored their cell 
phones.17
• Twelve percent of U.S. mothers between the ages of 18 and 35 (“Millennial moms”) 
admit to having used their cell phones while having sex.18
• Fourteen percent of cell phone users in 15 nations (15 percent of Americans) admit to 
having interrupted sex to answer their cell phones. Almost half of those responding 
worldwide and about one-third of Americans thought their cell phones said as much 
about them as their cars.19
College Students
In perhaps the largest cheating scandal in school history, about 125 Harvard University 
undergraduates were investigated for collaborating on a 2012 take-home examination in a 
course on government. More than half of those students were forced to withdraw from 
school and others were placed on probation.20 Certainly we should not be surprised about 
the Harvard episode because cheating appears to be epidemic. Business st udents seem to 
be particularly suspect. A large 2006 survey found 56 percent of graduate students in busi-
ness admitted to cheating at least once in the previous year, the largest percentage of any 
discipline surveyed.21 Among nonbusiness graduate students, 47 percent admitted cheat-
ing.22
 
Ninety-five percent of 3,000 undergraduate business students polled in 31 universities 
admit they cheated in high school or college, although only 1 to 2 percent admit having done 
so “frequently.”23 Academic ethics expert Donald McCabe’s surveys find about 75 percent of 

56  Unit One  Business and Society
college students cheating on either a test or a paper at some point, with business majors, 
 fraternity and sorority members, and male students being among those most likely to cheat.24 
The cheating evidence is discouraging, but some evidence of change should also be noted. 
High school students who said they had cheated on an examination in the past year declined 
from 59 percent in 2010 to 51 percent in 2012.25 Harvard MBA students have received a great 
deal of attention for their voluntary campaign to sign “The MBA Oath,” a pledge that  Harvard 
MBAs will act ethically, “serve the greater good,” and avoid advancing their own “narrow 
ambitions” at the expense of others.26 Now an international oath project pledges higher stand-
ards of integrity and service by business leaders. [See www.theoathproject.org]

Questions
1. If you were to sign an ethics oath as a student, do you think your behavior as a student 
and thereafter would improve? Explain.
2. Do you think ethics instruction, religious commitment, or higher natural intelligence 
would reduce academic cheating? Explain. See James M. Bloodgood, William H.  Turnley, 
and Peter Mudrack, “The Influence of Ethics Instruction, Religiosity, and Intelligence on 
Cheating Behavior,” The Journal of Business Ethics 82, no. 3 (2008), p. 557.
3. Professor Robert A. Prentice argues: “Those who choose to attend business school 
on the assumption that an MBA will help them change jobs, make more money, and 
therefore be happier are very likely misinformed.” Do you agree? Explain. See 
 Robert A. Prentice, “What’s an MBA Worth in Terms of Happiness?” The Chronicle 
of Higher Education, November 8, 2009 [http://chronicle.com/article

Changing Values?
Contemporary cheating behaviors offer a stark and unflattering contrast to the views of a 
1928 Princeton University freshman writing home:
Father, you suggest that the greatest benefit from college is to be found in . . . habits of intel-
lectual diligence and application. I am nonetheless putting my chief emphasis on the study of 
right and wrong.27
UCLA’s annual survey of college first-year students provides further evidence of chang-
ing values among young people. Responding to the 2012 survey, a record 81 percent of 
first-year students valued wealth as a goal, but only 46 percent sought a “meaningful 
philosophy of life.” That result is essentially a reversal of the 1971 survey when 37 per-
cent of freshmen identified being “very well off financially” as an essential or very im-
portant objective, and 73 percent felt the same about “developing a meaningful 
 philosophy of life.”28 The college experience, however, seems to strengthen some 
 important ethical values. A 2010 UCLA study found that students were more likely as 
juniors than as freshmen to say that “they wanted to develop a meaningful philosophy of 

Chapter Two  Business Ethics  57
life, seek beauty, become a more  loving person, and attain inner harmony.”29 Broadly, 
as compared with their freshmen attitudes, college juniors are more likely to be  engaged 
in a spiritual quest and more likely to be “caring” persons.30 On the other hand, The 
 Atlantic in 2013 reported on a growing body of evidence claiming we are in the midst of 
a “narcissism epidemic.”31 One study based on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory of 
college students nationwide, responding to such statements as “I think I am a special 
person,” concluded that the average college student today is about 30 percent more self-
absorbed than the average student in 1982.32 One of the study 
leaders, Jean Twenge of San Diego State University, remarked: 
“We need to stop endlessly repeating ‘you’re special,’ . . . Kids 
are self-centered enough already.”33 [The UCLA freshmen survey

repeating, ‘you’re special.’”
Too Little Studying = Cheating?
According to the 2011 National Survey of Student Engagement, business majors spend 
less time studying than students in any other broad field. Nearly half of senior business 
majors say they study fewer than 11 hours per week outside of class. According to the Col-
legiate Learning Assessment national essay test, business majors in their first two years of 
college improve their writing and reasoning skills less than any other major. 
Questions
1. Can you explain why business majors apparently study less, on average, than students 
in other majors?
2. Can you explain why business students’ writing and reasoning skills apparently in-
crease less than those of any other major during the first two years of college? 
3. The evidence, as noted above, indicates that business students cheat more than those 
majoring in other fields. What relationship, if any, do you see between student study 
patterns and student cheating patterns? Put another way, do you think cheating in 
 business schools would decline if students studied more? Explain.
4. Do you think that studying ethics, as you are assigned to do in this chapter and in this 
book, is likely to materially improve the ethical quality of your professional life 
 following graduation? Explain.

Part Two—Analyzing Ethical Dilemmas
Ethics Theories
We have looked in a preliminary way at some business ethics issues and at America’s 
moral climate. Now we turn to an overview of the primary philosophical theories  employed 
in examining ethics problems. Ethics, of course, involves judgments as to good and bad, 
right and wrong, and what ought to be. Business ethics refers to the measurement of busi-
ness behavior based on standards of right and wrong, rather than relying entirely on princi-
ples of accounting and management. (In this discussion, the word morals will be used 
interchangeably with the word ethics. Distinctions certainly are drawn between the two, 
but those distinctions are not vital for our purposes.)
 
Finding and following the moral course is not easy for any of us, but the difficulty may 
be particularly acute for the businessperson. The pressure to produce is intense, and the 
temptation to cheat may be great. Although the law provides very useful guides for 
 minimum comportment, clear moral answers frequently do not exist. Therefore, when the 
businessperson faces a difficult decision, a common tactic is simply to do what he or she 
takes to be correct at any given moment. Indeed, in one survey of ethical views in business, 
50 percent of the respondents indicated that the word ethical meant “what my feelings tell 
me is right.”34
 
Philosophers have provided powerful intellectual support for that approach. Existential-
ists, led by the famed Jean-Paul Sartre, believe standards of conduct cannot be objec-
tively  discovered or rationally justified via ethical theory and reasoning. No actions are 
inherently right or wrong. Thus, each person may reach his or her own choice about 
ethical principles. Personal freedom is the defining characteristic of every person. Each 
of us is, therefore, fully and exclusively responsible for our own moral decisions.35 That 
view finds its roots in the notion that humans are only what we will ourselves to be. If 
God does not exist, there can be no human nature, because there is no one to conceive 
that nature.
In Sartre’s famous interpretation, existence precedes essence. 
First humans exist; then we individually define what we are—our 
essence. Therefore, each of us is free, with no rules to turn to for 
guidance. Just as we all choose our own natures, so must we choose our own ethical pre-
cepts. Moral responsibility belongs to each of us individually.
Existence precedes essence.
Responsibility
Indian spiritual, political, and civil rights leader, Mahatma Gandhi, viewed moral respon-
sibility quite differently from Sartre. Gandhi’s view: “All humanity is one undivided and 
indivisible family, and each one of us is responsible for the misdeeds of all the others.”36 
Whose view makes more sense to you?

Chapter Two  Business Ethics  59
Universal Truths?
Have we then no rules or universal standards by which to distinguish right from wrong? 
Have we no absolutes? Philosophers seek to provide guidance beyond the uncertainties of 
ethical relativism. We will survey two ethical perspectives, teleology and deontology, 
which form the core of the philosophical approach to ethical analysis. Before proceeding 
to those theories, we will note the important role of religion in ethics and take a brief look 
at two additional formulations—libertarianism and virtue ethics—that have been increas-
ingly influential in contemporary moral analysis.
1. Religion. Judeo–Christian beliefs, Islam, Confucianism, Buddhism, and other faiths 
are powerful ethical voices in contemporary life. They often feature efforts such as the 
Golden Rule to build absolute and universal standards. Scholarly studies indicate that most 
American managers believe in the Golden Rule and take it to be their most meaningful 
moral guidepost. From a religious point of view, the deity’s laws are absolutes that must 
shape the whole of one’s life, including work. Faith, rather than reason, intuition, or secu-
lar knowledge, provides the foundation for a moral life built on religion. [For worldwide 
coverage of ethics issues, see http://www.bbc. co.uk/ethics]
Spirituality at Work
Many businesses directly practice Christian principles in the workplace. Hobby Lobby, for 
example, closes its 525 stores on Sunday, donates Christian counseling services, and buys 
holiday ads promoting the Christian faith. The top boss of the family-owned business, 
David Green, says, “We’re Christians and we run our business on Christian principles.”37 
Responding to employees’ personal and spiritual needs and sometimes fulfilling the reli-
gious convictions of the owners, many U.S. companies provide on-the-job chaplains.
 
We should note, however, that the growing spirituality movement in business often 
does not involve religion at all. Rather, managers may see spirituality as an expression of 
the whole person and a part of the broader search for meaning in life. Business, they think, 
must acknowledge the soul to maximize performance.
Questions
1. Do you think corporate America must now make room for spirituality and the soul in 
the workplace to maximize success? Explain.
2. Must we believe in God to be moral? Explain.
3. The Affordable Care Act (Obamacare; s ee Chapter 8) requires companies with 50 or 
more full-time employees to provide health insurance—including birth control 
 coverage—for employees or pay a fine. Hobby Lobby and its owners sued the federal 
government for an exemption from that law. In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that 
requiring family-owned corporations like Hobby Lobby to pay for insurance coverage 
for contraception violates the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. The 
law aside, do you think that corporations and owners should be excused, on religious 
grounds, from providing contraception coverage? Explain.

60  Unit One  Business and Society
2. Libertarianism. Contemporary philosopher Robert Nozick (1938–2002) built an 
ethical theory rooted in personal liberty. For him, morality coincided with the maximiza-
tion of personal freedom. Justice and fairness, right and wrong are measured not by equal-
ity of results (such as wealth) for all, but from ensuring equal opportunity for all to engage 
in informed choices about their own welfare. Hence Nozick took essentially a free market 
stance toward ethics.
3. Virtue ethics. In recent years, an increasing number of philosophers have argued that 
the key to good ethics lies not in rules, rights, and responsibilities but in the classic notion of 
character. As Plato and Aristotle argued, our attention should be given to strategies for en-
couraging desirable character traits such as honesty, fairness, compassion, and generosity. 
Aristotle believed that virtue could be taught much as any other skill. Virtue ethics applauds 
the person who is motivated to do the right thing and who cultivates that motivation in daily 
conduct. A part of the argument is that such persons are more morally reliable than those who 
simply follow the rules but fail to inspect, strengthen, and preserve their own personal virtues. 
[For an overview of virtue ethics, see http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/]
Teleology or Deontology—An Overview
Religion, libertarianism, and virtue provide crucial ethical lessons. Philosophers have 
 further clarified ethical theory by defining two broad analytical systems, teleology and 
deontology, that capture much of our current understanding about how to engage in careful 
ethical analysis.
 
Teleological ethical systems (often referred to as consequentialist ethical systems) are con-
cerned with the consequences, the results, of an act rather than the act itself. A teleological 
view of life involves ends, goals, and the ultimate good. Duty and obligation are subordinated 
to the production of what is good or desirable. For the teleologist/consequentialist, the end is 
primary and that end or result is the measure of the ethical quality of a decision or act.
 
To the deontologist, on the other hand, principle is primary and consequence is second-
ary or even irrelevant. Maximizing right rather than good is the deontological standard. 
The deontologist might well refuse to lie, as a matter of principle, even if lying would 
maximize good.
 
Deontology, derived from the Greek word meaning duty, is directed toward what ought 
to be, toward what is right. Similarly, deontology considers motives. For example, why a 
crime was committed may be more important than the actual consequences of the crime. 
Relationships among people are important from a deontological perspective  primarily 
 because they create duties. A father may be bound by duty to save his son from a burning 
building, rather than saving another person who could do more total good for society.
 
The distinction here is critical. Are we to guide our behavior by rational evaluation of 
the consequences of our acts, or according to duty and principle—that which ought to be? 
Let’s take a closer look at utilitarianism, the principal teleological ethical theory, and 
 formalism, the principal deontological ethical theory.
Teleology
Utilitarianism In reaching an ethical decision, good is to be weighed against evil. A 
 decision that maximizes the ratio of good over evil for all those concerned is the ethical 
course. Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) were the chief 

Chapter Two  Business Ethics  61
intellectual forces in the development of utilitarianism. Their views and those of other 
utilitarian philosophers were not entirely consistent. As a result, at least two branches of 
utilitarianism have developed. According to act-utilitarianism, our goal is to identify the 
consequences of a particular act to determine whether it is right or wrong. 
 Rule-utilitarianism requires us to follow those rules that generate the greatest value for 
society. Thus the rule-utilitarian may be forced to shun a particular act that would result 
in greater immediate good (punishing a guilty person whose constitutional rights have 
been violated) in  favor of upholding a broader rule that results in the greater total good 
over time (maintaining constitutional principles by freeing the guilty person). In sum, the 
principle to be followed for the utilitarian is the greatest good for the greatest number. 
[For an extensive database exploring utilitarianism, see http://www.hedweb.com
/philsoph/utillink.htm]
Deontology
Formalism The German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) developed perhaps 
the most persuasive and fully articulated vision of ethics as measured not by consequences 
(teleology) but by the rightness of rules. In this formalistic view of ethics, the rightness of 
an act depends little (or, in Kant’s view, not at all) on the results of the act. Kant believed 
in the key moral concept of “the goodwill.” The moral person is a person of goodwill, and 
that person renders ethical decisions based on what is right, regardless of the consequences 
of the decision. Moral worth springs from one’s decision to discharge one’s duty. Thus the 
student who refuses to cheat on exams is morally worthy if his or her decision springs from 
duty, but morally unworthy if the decision is merely one born of self-interest, such as fear 
of being caught.
 
How does the person of goodwill know what is right? Here Kant propounded the cat-
egorical imperative, the notion that every person should act on only those principles that 
he or she, as a rational person, would prescribe as universal laws to be applied to the 
whole of humankind. A moral rule is “categorical” rather than “hypothetical” in that its 
prescriptive force is independent of its consequences. The rule guides us independent of 
the ends we seek. Kant believed that every rational creature can act according to his or her 
categorical imperative because all such persons have “autonomous, self-legislating wills” 
that permit them to formulate and act on their own systems of rules. To Kant, what is right 
for one is right for all, and each of us can discover that “right” by exercising our rational 
faculties.
Questions
1. Fifty-year-old Wesley Autry, waiting with his two young daughters in January 2007 at 
a New York City subway station, saw a man collapse and fall off the passenger platform 
into the space between the train rails. The headlight of a train appeared. Mr. Autry im-
mediately jumped on top of the fallen man holding him down while the train passed 
over them, inches above Autry’s head. Asked later why he jumped to the rescue, Autry 
said: “I did what I felt was right.”38 What form of ethical reasoning did Autry seem to 
employ in making his courageous decision?
2. British priest Tim Jones caused a big stir by telling his congregation in 2009 that shop-
lifting is sometimes morally permissible for desperate people. In a sermon, Jones said 

62  Unit One  Business and Society
that shoplifting can be justified when a person is in real need, is not greedy and takes 
only what is necessary to get by. Later Jones said: “The point I’m making is that when 
we shut down every socially acceptable avenue for people in need, then the only avenue 
left is the socially unacceptable one.”39
a. Was Jones arguing from a teleological/consequentialist or a deontological/formalist 
point of view? Explain.
b. Do you agree with Jones? Explain.
3. In March 2013 as Tiger Woods’s golf game was recovering from a long period of poor 
performance (by his standards), Nike released an ad with Woods’s picture and the cap-
tion “Winning Takes Care of Everything,” a remark Woods reportedly made many 
times in reference to his golfing performance. Critics attacked  Woods and Nike saying 
the ad implied that golf victories would cancel out the shortcomings and misconduct of 
Woods’s past, including his failed marriage, repeated infidelities and generally per-
ceived arrogant, rude behavior. 
a. Is the ad an example of consequentialist or formalist thinking? Explain.
b. In assessing the moral quality of an individual’s life, can we properly weigh exem-
plary productivity against extensive wrongdoing? Consider cyclist Lance Arm-
strong, who has acknowledged having cheated by engaging in forbidden doping 
measures. Can we, nonetheless, consider Armstrong a “good person” in light of the 
enormous contribution he has made as an advocate for cancer research and as an in-
spiration to those who suffer from cancer? Explain. 
c. In your view, was Nike wrong to run the “Winning Takes Care of Everything” ad? 
Explain.
Using Ethical Reasoning: Two Cases
Obviously, ethical theory does not provide magical answers to life’s most difficult ques-
tions. Those theories are useful, however, in identifying and sorting the issues that lead to 
better decision making. Apply those theories to the Toyota and Malden Mills cases that 
follow, as you think about when layoffs are ethical.
Are Layoffs Unethical? Case One—Toyota
Despite its highly publicized product defect problems and the global financial crisis, 
 Toyota has tried to continue its half-century-old policy of not laying off permanent 
 employees. When Toyota halted production in some of its U.S. plants in 2008, the 4,500 
idled workers were kept on with full pay and benefits at a cost estimated at more than $50 
million.  Toyota executive Norm Bafunno said the retention decision was easy because the 
 company used the economic slowdown as an opportunity to retrain its team members. 
Bafunno said Toyota used a shared sacrifice approach:
During these times, we suspended all overtime, we suspended all variable compensation (bo-
nuses), we suspended pay raises, and in addition, for our senior leadership team . . . base pay 
was reduced . . . everyone needs to sacrifice together.
 
As Latondra Newton, general manager of Toyota’s Team Member Development Center 
in Erlanger, Kentucky said: “We’re not just keeping people on the payroll because we’re 

Chapter Two  Business Ethics  63
nice. At the end of all this, our hope is that we’ll end up with a more skilled North  American 
workforce.”
 
Despite its protective policies, Toyota has laid off thousands of temporary workers and 
in 2010, its Fremont, California plant was shut down leaving 4,700 workers without jobs. 
Toyota’s lifetime employment policy suffered another jolt in 2012 when 8 percent of its 
workforce at its Melbourne, Australia, factory reportedly were laid off owing to declining 
demand for some models.
Questions
1. Do you share Toyota’s vision that all workers should sacrifice in order to avoid layoffs 
for permanent workers?
2. If so, are you a “socialist”?
3. If not, are you selfish?
4. Broadly, is shared sacrifice a moral wrong? Explain.

Are Layoffs Unethical? Case Two (Part I)—Aaron Feuerstein 
and Malden Mills
Fabric manufacturer Malden Mills of Lowell, Massachusetts, provided 3,100 high-paid 
manufacturing jobs in the Boston area when a 1995 fire destroyed most of the plant. The 
next morning Aaron Feuerstein, CEO of the family-controlled mill, announced that the 
business would be rebuilt and all employees would retain their jobs. Feuerstein said that 
keeping all of the workers through the rebuilding process was “the right thing to do and 
there’s a moral imperative to do it, irrespective of the consequences.” Apparently, Feuer-
stein was significantly influenced by his Jewish heritage. In his youth, Feuerstein report-
edly memorized in Hebrew the Leviticus passage: “You are not permitted to oppress the 
workingman because he is poor and needy.”
 
The new plant was designed to expand production of the company’s patented and 
very successful Polartec fabric. Following the fire, makeshift production lines were de-
veloped in warehouses and about 85 percent of the employees returned to work with the 
remaining 400 workers or so remaining idle but paid. The new plant, machinery, and 
business losses cost Feuerstein some $300 million, much of which was covered by insur-
ance. Feuerstein was convinced that the big investment would pay in the long run and 
since he had a highly successful, patent-protected product and since the company was 
family-owned and thus under no immediate pressure to perform, he felt he could afford 
to do what his long-time family investment in the community and workers seemed to 
require. Professor Michael Useem, commenting on Feuerstein’s commitment to his 
workers, said that the idea had appeal: “The thinking is: employees can be seen as an 
ultimate competitive advantage. If you treat them well, they’ll pay you back in really 
hard work later on.”

Questions
1. Aaron Feuerstein became something of an overnight national hero by protecting his 
workers. Feuerstein said, “It was the right thing to do and there’s a moral imperative to 
do it, irrespective of the consequences.”
a. Was Feuerstein employing utilitarian or formalist reasoning? Explain.
b. In your view, was he correct to say that the consequences, in this instance, did not 
matter? Explain.
2. Commenting on Feuerstein’s approach to his employees’ needs, Wharton School professor 
Michael Useem said, “The thinking is: employees can be seen as an ultimate competitive 
advantage. If you treat them well, they’ll pay you back in really hard work later on.”40
a. Was Useem expressing formalist or utilitarian reasoning?
b. In a 1986 pastoral letter, the U.S. Catholic bishops argued that “every economic  decision 
and institution must be judged in light of whether it protects or undermines the dignity of 
the human person.”41 Does the thinking summarized by Useem undermine that dignity 
and as such require rejection under either utilitarian or formalist reasoning? Explain.
3. If you were a successful entrepreneur with the flexibility of Aaron Feuerstein, would 
you operate your business like an extended family? Explain.

Are Layoffs Unethical? Case Two (Part 2)—Aaron Feuerstein, 
Malden Mills, and Bankruptcy
In November 2001, Malden Mills was forced to enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings 
(see Chapter 15) for the purpose of reorganizing its finances under court protection. At the 
time, Malden Mills was bearing a $140 million debt load. Lenders demanded the bankruptcy 
action as a condition for extending an additional $20 million to keep the company afloat. In 
late 2003, Malden Mills emerged from bankruptcy. Creditors controlled the board of direc-
tors with Aaron Feuerstein occupying the family’s one seat. Malden’s precarious financial 
position was the product of a variety of forces: Customers were lost during the rebuilding 
after the fire, cheaper fleece substitutes entered the market, the company took on substantial 
debt in rebuilding and in keeping on its employees following the fire, and the company prob-
ably overbuilt following the fire. As a result, the Malden Mills workforce shrunk to 
1,200 employees. Then in 2007, Malden Mills was once again forced into bankruptcy and 
was purchased by Chrysalis Capital partners, a private-equity firm that renamed the company 
Polartec LLC. Aaron Feuerstein’s association with the company ended with the sale.
Questions
1. The Wall Street Journal raised the question, “Are layoffs moral?”42
a. Should we establish a universal, formalist rule forbidding layoffs of all hard-working, 
competent employees, or should we rely on utilitarian reasoning, libertarian thought, 
virtue theory, or religious beliefs to answer that question? Explain.
b. Is morality irrelevant to the question of when layoffs are necessary? Explain.

Chapter Two  Business Ethics  65
2. Do you think it would be accurate and fair to say that Feuerstein’s ethical choice to 
protect his employees led to the decline of his business? Explain.
3. Did Feuerstein make an error in judgment in relying on an absolute principle—that is, 
the protection of his workers at all costs? Explain.
4. How might Feuerstein’s workers have benefited by being laid off immediately  following 
the fire?
5. John MacKenzie, in a letter to The New York Times, said he had a duty to help Aaron 
Feuerstein and Malden Mills: “Of course I have an ethical obligation to buy from 
 Malden Mills if I have a choice and if my purchase can make a difference. It would 
 reward Mr. Feuerstein for what he has done and what he is trying to do, and the system 
needs more of that.”43 Do you have a duty to buy only from the most ethically responsi-
ble sellers? Explain.

Part Three—Managerial Misconduct?
Corporate Ethical Climate
Given the subprime mortgage crisis, a strong sense of misconduct on Wall Street, and our 
ongoing recession-related problems, we should not be surprised that public attitudes to-
ward big business are not positive. A global survey of 30,000 people in 2012 found only 
18 percent of the public trusts business leaders to tel l the truth. Unfortunately, government 
leaders scored even lower at 13 percent.44 In Gallup’s 2012 poll of confidence in major in-
stitutions only 21 percent of Americans expressed a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confi-
dence in big business and in banks. For some perspective, we should note that Congress 
ranked last among the 16 institutions surveyed by Gallup with only 13 percent of Americans 
expressing a great deal or quite a lot of confidence.45
 
Mistrust of the America n business community is supported by ample evidence of cor-
porate misconduct, but some new evidence is more encouraging. According to a large 
2011 national survey, 45 percent of for-profit employees witnessed misconduct at work 
(lying to employees, misuse of company resources, etc.), but that number compares with 
49 percent in 2009 and 55 percent in 2007. Thirty-four percent of 
employees reported a negative view of their supervisors’ ethics.46
In assessing America’s corporate ethical climate, we should keep 
in mind ethicist Chris MacDonald’s reminder that ethical behavior 
in business is, in many ways, at an historical high.
 
Businesses, he argues, are more transparent and more accountable than ever before, 
and, as he says: “Workplaces, while still far from perfect, are less sexist, less racist, and 
generally more civilized and humane than at any time in history” (in considerable part as a

Questions
At this writing in 2013, British Petroleum (BP) is on trial in New Orleans to assign blame 
for the massive 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The spill threat-
ened marine life while also severely damaging the Gulf’s economic, recreational, and aes-
thetic contributions to American life. The Gulf appears to be healing itself more quickly 
than expected and the economic consequences have been mitigated by BP payments. 
 Although the  company continues to carry a stigma in the American market, it seems fair to 
say that media attention and public concern have abated. 
 
Soon after the 2010 spill, a critic at a locally owned Des Moines, Iowa, BP station be-
rated customers and the station owner by saying: “Do you realize you’re buying from a 
company that’s polluting the Earth?”
1. Should we blame local BP station owners for the Gulf spill? Explain.
2. Should we boycott those stations? Explain.
3. Several years have passed. BP has been brought to trial and has made significant repara-

Why Do Some Managers Cheat?
Moral Development
Scholars argue that some individuals are better prepared to make ethical judgments than 
others. Psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg built and empirically tested a comprehensive 
theory of moral development in which he claimed that moral judgment evolves and 
 improves primarily as a function of age and education.
 
Kohlberg, via interviews with children as they aged, was able to identify moral 
 development as movement through distinct stages, with the later stages being improve-
ments on the earlier ones. Kohlberg identified six universal stages grouped into three 
levels:
1. Preconventional level:
 
Stage 1: Obey rules to avoid punishment.
 
Stage 2:  Follow rules only if it is in own interest, but let others do the same. Conform to 
secure rewards.
2. Conventional level:
 
Stage 3:  Conform to meet the expectations of others. Please others. Adhere to stereo-
typical images.
 
Stage 4: Doing right is one’s duty. Obey the law. Uphold the social order.
66  Unit One  Business and Society

Chapter Two  Business Ethics  67
3. Postconventional or principled level:
 
Stage 5:  Current laws and values are relative. Laws and duty are obeyed on rational 
calculations to serve the greatest number.
 
Stage 6:  Follow self-chosen universal ethical principles. In the event of conflicts, prin-
ciples override laws.48
 
At Level 3 the individual is able to reach independent moral judgments that may or may 
not conform with conventional societal wisdom. Thus the Level 2 manager might refrain 
from sexual harassment because it constitutes a violation of company policy and the law. 
A manager at Level 3 might reach the same conclusion, but his or her decision would be 
based on independently defined universal principles of justice.
 
Kohlberg found that many adults never pass beyond Level 2. Consequently, if Kohlberg 
was correct, many managers may behave unethically simply because they have not reached 
the upper stages of moral maturity.
 
Kohlberg’s model is based on extensive longitudinal and cross-cultural studies over 
more than three decades. For example, one set of Chicago-area boys was interviewed at 
3-year intervals for 20 years. Thus the stages of moral growth exhibit “definite empirical 
characteristics” such that Kohlberg was able to claim that his model had been scientifically 
validated.49 Although many critics remain, the evidence, in sum, supports Kohlberg’s gen-
eral proposition. [For a link to an overview of moral development and moral education, see 
http://www.davidsongifted.org/db/Resources_id_11335.aspx]
Feminine Voice One of those lines of criticism requires a brief inspection. Kohlberg col-
league Carol Gilligan contends that our conceptions of morality are, in substantial part, 
gender-based.50 She claims that men typically approach morality as a function of justice, 
impartiality, and rights (the ethic of justice), whereas women are more likely to build a 
morality based on care, support, and responsiveness (the ethic of care). Men, she says, tend 
to take an impersonal, universal view of morality as contrasted with the feminine “voice” 
that rises more commonly from relationships and concern for the specific needs of others. 
 Gilligan criticizes Kohlberg because his highest stages, 5 and 6, are structured in terms of 
the male approach to morality while the feminine voice falls at stage 3. Furthermore, 
 Kohlberg’s initial experimental subjects were limited to young males. The result, in Gilligan’s 
view, is that women are underscored. Of course, a danger in the ethic of care is that it 
might be  interpreted to restore and legitimize the stereotype of women as care giving 
subordinates not deserving of moral autonomy.51 Subsequent research both challenges52 
and supports53 Gilligan’s view.
Reason or Emotion?
Controlled or automatic? We have seen that Kohlberg and Gilligan (and most moral 
 philosophers) take the position that moral decision making is the controlled product of 
analysis, deliberation and experience. In recent years, however, new psychological and 
neuroscience evidence has supported an alternative theory of morality that involves 
 decision making by emotion or intuition. The emotion/intuition approach claims that moral 
decision making is an automatic, nonreflective process in which our minds, when confronted 
with a moral question, instantaneously generate feelings of approval or disapproval.54 

68  Unit One  Business and Society
Brain-scanning experiments have provided support for the automatic emotion/intuition 
 hypothesis.55 Some scientists speculate that controlled moral reasoning may be little more 
than an after-the-fact method of justifying conclusions already reached automatically via 
emotions/intuitions.
 
Moral theorist Marc Hauser extends the emotion/intuition thesis in his book Moral 
Minds.56 He claims that our brains are biologically endowed with a moral faculty that has 
evolved over eons and is designed to reach very rapid judgments about right and wrong 
based on unconscious processes that are involuntary and universal. Thus, when we judge 
an action to be morally right or wrong, Hauser says we are doing so instinctively, using our 
inborn moral faculty. Even babies seem to make moral judgments. Experiments show that 
6- and 10-month-old infants overwhelmingly prefer helping charac-
ters (objects manipulated like puppets in helping/hindering situa-
tions) over neutral characters and neutral characters are preferred 
over those who actively hinder others.57
 
The emotion/intuition/ biological theory provides a stern challenge to Kohlberg and to 
our faith in moral reasoning generally. Psychologist Jonathan Haidt compares the intuitive, 
moral machinery of the brain with an elephant and conscious moral reasoning with a small rider 
on the elephant’s back.58 Other scholarly evidence, however, continues to support a very 
robust role for rational moral decision making,59 and reasoning may at times override in-
tuitions, as Haidt himself acknowledges.60 Overall, moral decision making may be the 
product of a dual process system employing both automatic emotions (produced deep in 
the brain in its older structures) and controlled reasoning (produced in the newer, frontal 
lobes of the brain.61 [For more, see the website YourMorals.org, where Haidt and his col-
leagues invite you to “learn about your own morality, ethics, and/or values, while also 
contributing to scientific research.”]
Moral Identity?
The moral development story does not end with an understanding of moral reasoning and 
moral emotion. Neither of those forces, according to current research, adequately explains 
why some among us are moved, after reaching a moral judgment, to take moral action.62 
Early evidence suggests that a critical feature in total moral development, including the 
will to act, involves what is labeled moral identity. In general, moral identity involves the 
degree to which moral concerns are central to our sense of self. As Professor Sam Hardy 
explains it, a person might have a stronger sense of moral identity if that identity is  centered 
more on moral virtue than on amoral virtues such as creativity.63 Some studies find that 
those with stronger moral identities are more likely to engage in good behaviors such as 
volunteering or showing respect for members of “out-groups.”64 Remember, however, that 
the moral identity evidence remains quite tentative.
Organizational Forces
Obviously, individual character influences corporate misconduct, but organizational cul-
ture is also important.65 Unfortunately, only 10 percent of American companies demon-
strate the characteristics that are associated with a “strong ethical culture,” according to a 
2007 Ethics Resource Center study.66 Similarly, Ethisphere Institute, in its 2012 ranking of 
Even babies seem to make 
moral judgments.

Chapter Two  Business Ethics  69
the world’s most ethical companies, reviewed 5,000 nominees and identified 145 (102 of 
which were American) that met its standards. Ethisphere bases it rankings on what it calls 
an Ethics Quotient derived from nominees’ codes of ethics, regulatory and legal infrac-
tions, sustainable investment policies, corporate citizenship, and more.67 [For the Business 
Roundtable Institute for Corporate Ethics, see http://www.corporate-ethics.org/]
 
Pressure to cheat is often cited as evidence of an organization’s ethical culture. A near-
record 13 percent of American for-profit workers “perceived pressure to compromise 
standards in order to do their jobs,” according to the 2011 National Business Ethics Sur-
vey.68 Thirty graduates of the Harvard Business School agreed to in-depth interviews about 
their on-the-job ethics experiences, including the pressure to cheat felt by their  bosses:
I really feel for people who are middle management, with a wife and four kids, under finan-
cial strain. . . . You see it happen all the time, that people are indicted for fraud or larceny. 
You can empathize with their situation. The world is changing fast. And 
a lot of people have been blindsided by it—so they’ve done things that 
they don’t like. I can’t say that will never happen to me. It’s easy for me 
as a single person. . . but when you’re desperate, you’re desperate. [My 
boss] was not willfully unethical. It was the pressure of the time. . . . 
I have no idea what pressures were on him to drive the project. It prob-
ably wasn’t [his] initiative to fudge the numbers. There may have been a good intention at 
some point in the organization. But as it got filtered through the organization, it changed. 
Some executive may have said, “This is an interesting project.”  Unfortunately this got 
translated as, “The vice president really wants this project.” This sort of thing can happen 
a lot. Things start on high. As they go down they are filtered, modified. What was a posi-
tive comment several levels above becomes “do this or die” several levels down.69 [For a 
variety of business ethics links, see http://www.ethics.ubc.ca/resources/business/]
The Boss
Top corporate bosses have hit a particularly rough patch in American life. Many have been 
disgraced by various scandals, and a number of them are in jail. Wall Street executives are 
accused of bringing the economy to near collapse while continuing to collect big bonuses. 
Although business leaders often blame these trust woes on a “few bad apples,” the 2013 
Edelman Trust Barometer (a survey of 26,000 people in 26 countries) found that only 
18 percent of respondents “would trust a business leader to tell the truth in a complex situ-
ation.”70
 
Notwithstanding the current cynicism, we know that bosses are crucial in setting the 
ethical climate in an organization. The Wall Street Journal reviewed retired corporate chief 
Herb Baum’s leadership book:
In The Transparent Leader, Herb Baum argues that a climate of integrity is crucial to the 
success of a public company and that it begins at the top.
Mr. Baum . . . is at the top himself, but he drives a VW Beetle to work, he tells us, 
and doesn’t have a reserved parking space. Not that he minds: He arrives at 5 am, ahead 
of the crowd. He espouses straight talk, solid values, and hiring literally good people—as 
opposed to people who are merely good at their jobs. His catchall term for this ethos is 
“transparency.”
“[My boss] was not willfully 
unethical. It was the pressure 
of the time.”

70  Unit One  Business and Society
How to create it? Mr. Baum rightly insists that it has to come from the chief executive’s 
office. He emphasizes valuing people by keeping an open door, communicating honestly, 
 listening carefully, and making sure that integrity permeates every aspect of the company. 
Hypocrisy is anathema: “A lot of CEOs, including me, are overpaid,” he says bluntly—and 
at one point he distributed his annual bonus to Dial’s lowest-paid employees.71

Bill Hawkins: A Tough Decision
Bill Hawkins, CEO at Medtronic ($14.6 billion, Minneapolis-based medical device 
maker), faced a critical ethical decision-making moment in 2007 when he learned that 
Medtronic’s Sprint Fidelis leads might have been malfunctioning at an unacceptably 
high rate. Leads are very thin wires that connect implanted heart defibrillators to the 
heart thus allowing a shock to be delivered from the defibrillator to the heart muscle. 
Sprint Fidelis leads (Sprint was the brand name for Medtronic’s leads and Fidelis was 
the particular model of lead) were the company’s newest, and thinnest, model. Medtronic 
began receiving reports of fractures in the Sprint Fidelis leads. Those fractures might 
prevent a needed shock from reaching the heart, or patients might receive random 
shocks. 
 
Hawkins had been with Medtronic for about five years and had been serving as president 
and chief operating officer for about two months when he learned in March 2007 that one 
hospital was reporting problems with the leads. According to Hawkins, Medtronic’s internal 
experts and an independent physician advisory board investigated and the company con-
cluded that  monitoring should continue but the leads should not be removed from the 
 market. In  October 2007, when Hawkins had been CEO for two months, he received new 
data showing that the Fidelis lead’s resistance to fracture was 97.7 percent versus 99.1 for 
the previous model; a statistically insignificant difference, but a gap that would become 
statistically significant over time if the fracture rates remained constant. After consultation 
with other company officers and an independent physician advisory board, Hawkins felt 
that the  Fidelis was displaying a negative trend, but he wanted more deliberation. Various 
Medtronic leaders met for  discussion, as did the physicians. The next day they met again 
by teleconference and after 90 minutes of discussion, the decision was reached to voluntarily 
recall the Sprint Fidelis.
 
The leads had been on the market for about 38 months and 268,000 had been 
 implanted. The day the recall was announced, Medtronic had its worst day on the stock 
market in 23 years with a 12 percent decline and its market share in the category fell 
from 51 to 47 percent. By March 2009, Medtronic’s physician panel had identified 
13 deaths that might have been associated with the lead fractures. Within two years, 
however, Medtronic had largely recovered from the episode, a software package had 
been developed that would alert patients that a lead might be fracturing, and a favora-
ble U.S.  Supreme Court decision was offering Medtronic substantial shelter from 
 lawsuits.
 
Hawkins described how Medtronic’s culture influenced him and his company:
Our founder wrote in 1960 that the purpose of our company is to “alleviate pain, 
restore health, and extend life.” I am not being coy when I say that I take this very 

Chapter Two  Business Ethics  71
personally and that our company is strongly influenced by this sense of mission. 
During the course of our Fidelis discussions, not once did we talk about what 
might happen to the stock price or market share if we suspended distribution. The 
conversation was about our responsibility to do the right thing.72
Questions
1. Beyond market share and stock market prices, what considerations would have 
 influenced Hawkins’s decision?
2. Some critics have said that Hawkins’s decision could not be considered difficult 
 because lives were at risk. Do you agree that Hawkins’s decision was, in fact, easy? 
Explain.

Bank Robber to Boardroom
Some bosses go wrong but correct their lives—none more dramatically than James Joseph 
Minder, 74-year-old former chairman of Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. In his twenties, 
Minder was the notorious “Shotgun Bandit” of Michigan. He committed dozens of armed 
holdups, some while a student at the University of Michigan. On one occasion he terror-
ized employees before stealing $53,000 from a branch of Manufacturers National Bank. 
He served time in prison and was free of trouble, he says, after 1965. After release from 
prison in 1969, he spent 20 years successfully setting up group homes and programs for 
troubled children and young adults. After retiring in the 1990s, Minder got involved in the 
gun industry and eventually became chairman of handgun manufacturer, Smith & Wesson. 
Then in 2004 a reporter came to his home asking about his past, a life he had not hidden 
but one he had not advertised either. At first he denied he was the “Bandit,” but he recon-
sidered and decided, “I had better tell the truth.” He later told the other members of the 
Smith & Wesson board, and resigned as chairman.

5. Kansas City Royals pitcher Gil Meche, 32 years old and troubled by a shoulder in-
jury, decided in 2011 to retire from baseball. The decision would not be considered

reported to spring training, gone through the motions and collected their big pay-
checks. Meche said, “When I signed my contract, my main goal was to earn it. Once 
I started to realize I wasn’t earning my money, I felt bad.” Meche thought he had al-
ready earned enough from the Royals: “Making that amount of money from a team 
that’s already given me over $40 million for my life and for my kids, it just wasn’t the 
right thing to do.”
a. Would you do the same as Meche if you were similarly situated? Explain.

Chapter Two  Business Ethics  73
Part Four—Business Ethics in Practice
Introduction: Corporate/White-Collar Crime
Having established a general foundation in ethical climate and theory, we turn now to cor-
porate misconduct in practice. Forty-five percent of U.S. respondents to Pricewaterhouse-
Coopers’ (PwC) 2011 economic crime survey reported that their organization had suffered 
fraud in the previous 12 months.74 Presumably reflecting increasing workforce participa-
tion and increasing opportunities, women in the United States constituted 40 percent of the 
perpetrators in internal fraud cases as opposed to 19 percent in other nations.75 Ernst & 
Young’s 2013 survey of officers and employees in 36 nations in Europe, Africa, the 
 Middle East, and India found 42 percent of senior managers and directors knew of 
 instances of accounting fraud in their organizations during the previous 12 months.76
 
The U.S. government struggles to curb corporate crime, but in 2012, corporate pay-
ments to the government to settle fraud charges reached a record total of about $8 billion.77 
Critics are not satisfied, however, partly because, as a New York Times headline said, “Cor-
porate Fraud Cases Often Spare Individuals.”78 With notable exceptions, including Ponzi 
master Bernie Madoff and numerous insider trading cases (see Chapter 9), the government 
has often been slow to go after bosses. As we noted previously in this chapter, that ten-
dency has been particularly evident in the case of the big banks and their bosses, but we 
need to remember that the task of linking particular people to instances of wrongdoing can 
be extremely difficult and expensive. 
 
Because of those difficulties and expenses, the government has recently turned with 
frequency to what are called “deferred prosecution” or “nonprosecution” agreements with 
corporations and individuals. The New York Times explained:
Deferred and non-prosecution agreements are contracts with the government in which a 
company (or individual) undertakes specified actions in exchange for charges being dis-
missed or not filed altogether. The terms usually require payment of a fine, continued coop-
eration with any investigations or trials and a commitment to enhance internal controls.79
Deferring charges is a common prosecution practice, especially in alcohol and drug cases, and 
deferrals avoid destroying corporations and the jobs they provide. Critics of corporate crime 
deferrals, however, say “it is the rare case when senior management pays any price.”80 
Is Theft Sometimes OK?
A shopper wrote a letter to the editor explaining how he felt after observing what appeared 
to be a theft:
[A]t Wal-Mart I saw a person try to put an item in their jacket. At first I thought 
this person was a jerk. . . . But after I returned home, I became convinced that it 
was OK to steal. . . . When I compare the theft of a $15 item to the grand larceny 
by corporate America, which ran Enron into the ground, which reaps record oil 

74  Unit One  Business and Society
Prevention or  Enhanced Punishment
Responding to public outrage over Enron, WorldCom, and other stunning and destruc-
tive corporate scandals, Congress and the president approved the 2002 Sarbanes–Oxley 
Act (SOX) to attack corporate crime by publicly traded companies. Among its provi-
sions, the bill:
• Establishes an independent board to oversee the accounting profession.
• Requires corporate executives to personally certify the accuracy of their financial re-
ports.
• Creates new crimes and raises penalties.
• Requires publicly traded companies to establish internal control systems designed to 
assure the accuracy of financial information.
• Requires publicly traded companies to disclose whether they have adopted an ethics 
code for senior financial management, and if not, why not.
SOX is often criticized as a drain on company resources and an impediment to economic 
growth, but most organizations seem to have settled in to the SOX requirements and often 
praise its effects. In a 2010 survey of 400 business executives, 87 percent said SOX is 
good for private enterprise,81 and a 2009 Securities and Exchange Commission study con-
cluded that the benefits of SOX exceeded its costs.82 Worrisome, perhaps, is the apparent 
underutilization of SOX in response to our financial crisis as reported by The Wall Street 
Journal in 2012:
As the Sarbanes–Oxley Act turns 10 years old, the law’s biggest hammer—the threat of jail 
time for corporate executives who knowingly certify inaccurate financial reports—is going 
largely unused.83
Over the past decade, the government has applied the false certification provisions of SOX 
to at least 200 individuals, but no executive from any of the big banks suspected of mis-
leading the public during the financial crisis has been prosecuted under SOX.
 
Of course, these cases are difficult to win, but critics such as University of San Diego 
law and finance professor Frank Partnoy are skeptical:
Could it really be the case that the number of high-level criminal actions at Wall Street firms 
over the last decade is zero? Could the firms really be that clean?84
profits,. . . which occupies the seats of go vernment and takes bribes, I now see the 
act of stealing a small gift . . . as heroic.
Questions
1. What do you think the letter writer meant when he applied the label “heroic” to the ap-
parent theft?
2. Should we be more aggressive in pursuing corporate fraud? Explain.

Chapter Two  Business Ethics  75
Sentencing
Federal sentencing guidelines, issued by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, provide 
ranges (e.g., 10–12 months imprisonment) within which judges are advised to impose 
sentences. Relying on the crime’s “offense level” and the defendant’s criminal history, 
the punishment range for each category of both white-collar and street crime is estab-
lished. The guidelines are designed to provide greater predictability and consistency in 
punishment. Companies must develop programs to prevent and detect crime, provide 
ethics training, and monitor the success of compliance efforts. Companies involved in 
crimes may receive reduced penalties if they have effective compliance programs in 
place. Responsibility for compliance rests explicitly with the board of directors and 
top-level executives. Directors and officers complying with the guidelines may receive 
leniency while those engaging in aggravating behaviors such as a leadership role in 
crime may face increased punishment. Of course, the challenges of maintaining close, 
effective compliance in extended, complex giants such as Enron and McDonald’s are 
formidable.85 
 
Recent Supreme Court decisions have diminished the power of the guidelines by sig-
nificantly restoring federal judges’ authority to deviate from them. Judges who follow the 
guidelines are presumed to have acted reasonably, but departures from the guidelines are 
now permissible on a case-by-case basis.
Too Lenient?
Federal judge Sandra Beckwith in Ohio stretched sentencing latitude to the maximum in 
her 2011 sentencing of Michael E. Peppel, former chair and CEO of technology firm 
MCSi. Peppel pleaded guilty to fraud resulting in estimated damages of $18 million. The 
sentencing guidelines called for 8 to 10 years of incarceration, but the judge handed 
down a sentence of seven days in jail and three years of supervised release. The judge 
had responded to evidence of Peppel’s 100 letters of support, strong role in the commu-
nity, business expertise, five children, and other family needs. On appeal, however, the 
Sixth Circuit ruled that Judge Beckwith had abused her discretion. The appeals court 
specifically rejected the reasoning that Peppel’s professional skills and capacity to con-
tribute to society justified a lighter sentence. Following the appeals decision, Judge 
Beckwith sentenced Peppel to two years in prison, three years of court supervision, and 
a $5 million fine.
Question
 
Critics of increased government activism regard the free market as the best protection 
against corporate misconduct. They see SOX, the sentencing guidelines, and aggressive 
prosecution as government-inflicted drags on the economy. Do you agree? Explain.

Global Bribery
Estee med clothier Ralph Lauren Corp. reportedly bribed Argentine customs officials with 
about $600,000 worth of perfume, dresses, and cash from 2004 to 2009 to facilitate pas-
sage of company products into the country. Lauren officials say they reported the miscon-
duct as soon as they learned of it. Lauren agreed in 2013 to pay $1.6 million in fines to 
resolve federal bribery charges and entered into a nonprosecution agreement with the 
 government.86 
 
In many cultures, the payment of bribes—baksheesh (Middle East), huilu (China), vzy-
atku (Russia), mordida (South America), or dash  (Africa)—is accepted as a necessary and, 
in some cases, a lawful way of doing business. American firms and officers wishing to 
succeed abroad have faced great pressure to  engage in practices that are illegal and unethi-
cal in the American culture.
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the chief federal weapon against bribery 
abroad, was enacted in 1977 in response to disclosure of widespread bribery by American 
firms. In brief, the FCPA provides that U.S. nationals and businesses acting anywhere in 
the world, foreign nationals and companies acting in U.S. territory, and foreign companies 
listed on a U.S. stock exchange are engaging in criminal conduct if they offer or provide 
money or anything of value to foreign government officials to obtain or retain business or 
otherwise secure “any improper advantage.” In addition, the FCPA requires rigorous 
 internal accounting controls and careful recordkeeping to ensure that bribes cannot be 
concealed via “slush funds” and other devices. The act does not  forbid “grease” pay-
ments to foreign officials or political parties where the purpose of the payments is “to 
expedite or to secure the performance of a routine governmental action,” such as pro-
cessing papers (like visas), providing police protection, and securing phone service. 
Likewise a “small gift or token of esteem or gratitude” ordinarily is permissible. And 
those accused may offer the affirmative defense that the alleged payoff was lawful in the 
host country or was a normal, reasonable business expenditure directed to specific 
 marketing and contract performance activities. Criminal penalties include fines of up to 
$2 million for companies, while individuals may be fined $250,000 and imprisoned for 
as long as five years. The U.S. Justice Department has recently shown some leniency in 
FCPA cases where alleged violators have strong ethics and compliance programs in 
place. [For a summary of the FCPA, see http://fcpaenforcement.com/explained
/ explained.asp]
Controversy
The FCPA has been controversial from the outset. Some businesspeople see it as a 
blessing both because it is an honorable attempt at a firm moral stance and because it 
is often useful for an American businessperson abroad to say, “No, our laws forbid me 
from  doing that.” On the other hand, some consider the act damaging to our competi-
tiveness. Now other  nations are recognizing that corruption is a great risk to the global 
economy. Once believing that bribery aided the poor, most industrial countries are 
now moving toward the zero  tolerance view held by the United States. In addition to 
the FCPA, the United States also participates in several other anticorruption initiatives 

Chapter Two  Business Ethics  77
including the U.N. Convention against Corruption, the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, 
and the Inter-American  Convention. [For details on the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, 
see www.oecd.org]
United S tates Corruption Total corporate sanctions under the FCPA reached a record 
$1.7 billion in 2011.87 Corporate titans such as Pfizer and Tyco have recently agreed to pay 
penalties totaling tens of millions of dollars. Microsoft reportedly is under investigation in 
connection with alleged bribery schemes in China, Italy, and Romania.88 By far the most 
publicized FCPA news, however, involves ongoing investigations of Walmart’s alleged 
bribes in Mexico designed to win approval for new stores, including one near ancient 
pyramids. A New York Times 2012 report headlined “How  Wal-Mart Used Payoffs to Get 
Its Way in Mexico”89 has generated ongoing investigations by Congress, the federal Secu-
rities and Exchange Commission, the Justice Department, and Walmart itself. Even as the 
facts continue to be revealed, the Times has reported that 19 stores in Mexico were associ-
ated with bribes and that Walmart was often the aggressor in these alleged deals:
The Times’s examination reveals that Wal-Mart de Mexico was not the reluctant victim of a 
corrupt culture that insisted on bribes as the cost of doing business. Nor did it pay bribes 
merely to speed up routine approvals. Rather, Wal-Mart de Mexico was an aggressive and 
creative corrupter, offering large payoffs to get what the law otherwise prohibited. It used 
bribes to subvert democratic governance—public votes, open debates, transparent proce-

The United States ranked only 19th in Transparency International’s 
2012 Corruption Perceptions Index, which aggregates data provided 
by experts and business leaders to assess the perceived level of public 
sector corruption around the globe. The countries perceived to be least 
corrupt were Denmark, New Zealand, and Finland. Most of northern 
and Western Europe as well as Canada were perceived to be less 
 corrupt than the United States. France (22), China (80), and Russia 
(133) were among the nations ranking lower than the United States.91
Bribery in Daily Life
Bribery seems to be a routine cost of living in some countries:
Like many Russians, Nikolai can’t even count the number of bribes he 
has paid in his life. He remembers the big ones, like the $1,000 he paid 
to avoid mandatory military service or the $1,200 he gave his wife’s ob-
stetrician to ensure her a place at one of Moscow’s state-run maternity 
hospitals. But the small ones, like the dozens of $10 to $20 bribes he’s 
handed to traffic police over the years, are instantly forgotten.
Whether it’s getting your child into a good school, passing your driving test or even mak-
ing sure you get medical treatment, there are few areas of life in Russia where a well-placed 
bribe isn’t essential. Experts say corruption in Russia is endemic, especially in the corporate 
world—where big companies, both domestic and foreign, often have to shell out hundreds 
of thousands of dollars to get permission for a project or win a government c ontract.92

R ussian think tank INDEM estimates that, on average, Russian businesses spend 7 percent 
of their budgets on bribes.93 Interestingly, Russia has recently strengthened its antibribery 
laws. China executed the former head of its food and drug agency in 2007 for allegedly ac-
cepting $850,000 in bribes from Chinese pharmaceutical companies, but bribery continues 
to be a routine feature of business practice in China. The World 
Bank estimates that bribes to government officials globally total 
$1 trillion annually.94 Frustration with routine, petty bribery expecta-
tions in India led to the establishment of an online site [ipaidabribe
.com] where bribes can be reported anonymously, offering both a 
place to vent frustration and a venue for collecting information that 
will help in implementing reforms. 
China executed the former 
head of its food and drug 
agency for allegedly accept-

Banadex, a subsidiary of Cincinnati-based Chiquita Brands 
International, paid bribes to Colombian rebels over a pe-
riod of years, including $1.7 million from 1997 to 2004 to the 
AUC (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia), a right-wing Co-
lombian terrorist group. Chiquita, one of the world’s lead-
ing banana producers with operations in 70 nations, 
learned of the payments in 2000, but allowed them to con-
tinue. Reliable reports indicated that thousands of people 
had been killed, tortured, raped, or “disappeared” by the 
AUC (now disbanded). At the time, terrorists in Colombia 
were holding Americans for ransom or killing some of 
them, and years earlier four Chiquita employees had been 
killed by left-wing guerillas. The bribes, then lawful under 
American and Colombian law, were thought necessary to 
protect employees and company property at Chiquita’s 
 Colombian operations.
 
In 2003, Chiquita allegedly “stumbled across” news 
that the AUC had in 2001 been designated a “foreign ter-
rorist organization” by the U.S. government, which meant 
payments thereafter were unlawful. The payments con-
tinued, however, despite warnings from outside counsel 
to discontinue them or face the risk of felony charges. 
Chiquita said that stopping the payments would have en-
dangered its employees. By 2003, Chiquita’s operations in 
Colombia were its most profitable. The bribe payments 
were stopped in 2004 when a new CEO arrived. Chiquita 
soon sold its  Colombian interests. Chiquita had earned 
about $50 million in profits from the time AUC was desig-
nated a terrorist  organization until the period when the 
payments ceased.
 
In 2007, Chiquita entered a guilty plea to the felony of 
engaging in transactions with terrorists. A federal judge 
sentenced Chiquita to $25 million in fines and five years 
probation. Some evidence suggests Chiquita may have 
delayed its decision to stop payments by nearly one 
year as it waited for the U.S. government to review the 
security  implications of a Chiquita withdrawal from 
Colombia. U.S. Justice Department officials denied that 
claim, and in 2007 they concluded their investigation by 
deciding not to bring criminal charges against former 
Chiquita officials.
 
Families of Colombians killed or tortured by the ter-
rorists along with human rights groups have filed sev-
eral civil lawsuits against Chiquita for supporting the 
terrorists who allegedly used the bribe money to buy 
weapons. During the period of Chiquita payments to 
AUC, some 4,000 Colombians were killed in the banana-
growing region of Colombia. An Organization of Ameri-
can States investigation concluded that 3,000 Central 
American rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition 
reached the terrorists after allegedly being  unloaded at 
a Colombian port by Banadex. Colombian  officials argue 
that Chiquita was not a victim of extortion and that the 
company knew AUC was using the bribery proceeds to

Whistle Blowing
Whistle blower Bradley Birkenfeld was awarded a $104 million government payment 
in 2012 for telling the Internal Revenue Service how his employer, Swiss bank UBS, 
helped thousands of Americans evade taxes. Birkenfeld’s inside information helped 
the U.S. government crack open Swiss banking secrecy. As a 
result, at least 33,000 Americans have voluntarily disclosed their 
offshore accounts, resulting in perhaps $5 billion in revenue for 
the Internal Revenue Service.95 UBS avoided prosecution by 
paying $780 million and disclosing useful information to the 
federal government. Birkenfeld had been sentenced in 2009 to 40 months in prison for 
fraud in withholding information from federal investigators, but he was released early. 
Birkenfeld reportedly also told a court that he had smuggled diamonds for a client in 
a tube of toothpaste.96 Despite those alleged misdeeds, the government decided to 
make the big payment to Birkenfeld to avoid discouraging other potential whistle 
blowers.97 
 
Many federal statutes include whistle blower provisions and the federal False Claims 
Act rewards those who help stop fraud involving government contracts. Whistle blowers 
typically are entitled to 10 to 30 percent of the recovery from the wrongdoer. Whistle 
blowing appears to be on the rise following the passage of the 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Pro tection Act (see Chapter 8) which includes a cash re-
ward for those whose information regarding federal securities law violations leads to a 
recovery exceeding $1 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission received 
about 3,000 tips in the first year of the program.98 [For an overview of whistle blower 
activity and protections, see http://www.whistleblowers.org/ and for a law firm dedi-
cated to representing whistle blowers as well as their stories, see http://www

violations, partly out of fear of retribution. A recent survey found 
that 73 percent of full-time American employees observed wrong-
doing on the job, but only about 36 percent of those employees actu-
ally reported that wrongdoing to bosses.99
 
James Nordgaard, a hedge fund trader, said his former employer, Paradigm Capital, 
“embarked on a campaign of retaliation” against him after he blew the whistle on what he 
says were “trading violations.” Nordgaard says he was removed from his trading desk, 
isolated in a room “with little ventilation” and subsequently demoted.100 Dodd–Frank ex-
pressly forbids discharge, demotion, and other forms of retribution against securities law 
whistle-blowers; other federal laws, such as Sarbanes– Oxley, provide varying degrees of 
protection in some other areas of  enforcement.
Questions
1. Why is the role of “squealer” or whistle-blower so repugnant to many Americans?
2. a.  How would you feel about a classmate who blew the whistle on you for cheating on 
an examination?
b. Would you report cheating by a classmate if it came to your attention? Explain.
Ethics Codes
Most big companies have voluntarily developed ethics codes; some providing rather de-
tailed “dos and don’ts” about employee conduct and others consisting of more generalized 
statements of principles. Section 406 of Sarbanes–Oxley—specifically requires publicly 
traded companies to adopt a code of ethics for senior financial officers or to explain why 
they have not done so. Section 406 defines a code of ethics as written standards that are 
reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote such behaviors as honest con-
duct, full disclosure in reports, compliance with all applicable laws and rules, prompt re-
porting of violations, and methods for conforming to the code’s expectations. [For the 
Ethics Officers Association, see http://www.eoa.org]
 
Responding to SOX and other pressures, an increasing number of companies have pre-
pared more detailed codes, displayed them more prominently, required employees to read 
and sign the codes, and created training methods to more firmly integrate ethical expecta-
tions into company decision making. Companies that can show well-developed ethical 
systems, including codes of conduct and compliance with those codes, may receive more 
sympathetic treatment from the justice system if criminal problems emerge. [For the Ethics 
Resource Center, see http://www.ethics.org/]
 
Are codes effective in practice? Research on that question is mixed, although a 2011 
study of 392 international companies found a positive relationship between the quality 
(topics covered, tone, commitment to corporate values, nonretaliation provisions, etc.) of 
codes of conduct and ethical performance. Companies that maintained high-quality codes 
of conduct were found to rank highly in corporate citizenship, sustainability, ethical behav-
ior, and public perception of the firm.101 [For information on global corporate governance 
and citizenship, see http://www.conference-board.org/]

dream home she had found. The sales climate was tough, but she had one remaining 
prospect,  inner-city Lincoln School, which could make especially good use of new edu-
cational materials. Lincoln had no budget for discretionary purchases, but Mary consid-
ered “donating” $1,000 to the school in return for which they would make the purchases 
that would put her over the top. She knew her donation would help disadvantaged students

Assuring an Ethical Culture at Raytheon
Jay Stephens, general counsel, and Patti Ellis, vice president for business ethics and com-
pliance, at defense contractor Raytheon, outlined some strategies for building an ethical 
commitment throughout a complex organization:
• Aim High. The Board of Directors and top leaders must set the ethics tone and push it 
down through the company.
• Keep Learning. Raytheon’s 70,000 employees are regularly educated about ethics.
• Discuss. Talking about ethics buil ds trust in the organization.
• Keep It Real. Each year employees receive four ethics videos featuring dilemmas that 
may be encountered on the job.
• Step Back. Don’t be driven to wrongdoing by deadlines. If not sure what to do, em-
ployees are encouraged to pause and think.

 5. A group of 12 employees at a real estate office in south Florida chipped in $20 each 
toward the purchase of lottery tickets for a March 2013 Powerball drawing. One em-
ployee, Jennifer Maldanado, an administrative assistant who had been working in the 
office for only two weeks had not even received her first paycheck yet, so she declined 
to join the pool. The group of 12 won $1 million, which came to over $83,000 each. 
Laurie Finkelstein Reader, the team leader in the office, said that winning was not go-
ing to be as much fun for the group without Maldanado, so she texted the other win-
ners, and they all agreed to give a portion (undivulged) of their winnings to 
Maldanado.105
a. Morally speaking, is sharing winnings more commendable than keeping all for one-
self? Explain.
b. Could this real estate office operate effectively if workers shared their earnings as 
well as their lottery winnings? Explain.
c. Morally speaking, would sharing earnings be the more commendable approach to 
the office’s pay policies? Explain.
d. Most of the office workers who shared with Maldanado were women. Do you think 
women are more inclined to share than men? If so, are women more worthy of 
moral approval than are men? Explain.

beyond high-paying Wall Street opportunities. An online campaign labeled “Stop the 
Brain Drain” gathers signatures and pushes for changes in campus recruiting practices. 
The prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology has created an entrepreneurship 
center to provide  support for students seeking work with start-ups and other smaller 
ventures. Bill Aulet, who heads the center, explained some of his reasoning: “Once it 
became clear that financial instruments were a big cause of the [financial] crisis, and 
that’s what our incredibly intelligent students were being used for, we thought, ‘Boy, 
can’t they be used to do more useful things?’”108 
a. Would we be better off as a nation if more of our brighter students shunned Wall 
Street jobs? Explain.
b. What will you do? Explain.
 8. A pharmacist in Lexington, Kentucky, refused to stock over-the-counter weight reduc-

of one of your suppliers. You find out that this supplier discriminates illegally against 
minorities, although no legal action has been taken. Assume further that this supplier

Chapter Three  The Corporation and Public Policy: Expanding Responsibilities  91
Outdoor adventurer Yvon Chouinard and his wife, Ellen 
Pennoyer, in 1972, founded Patagonia, Inc., the sports 
clothing and outdoor gear retailer. Privately owned, 
 Ventura, California-based Patagonia with annual revenues 
that recently reached $540 million is the product of entre-
preneurial drive and a corporate culture practicing 
“green” business and “management by absence.”
 
Chouinard, was an early advocate of doing business in an 
environmentally friendly way, including for example, placing 
notes in Patagonia catalogs encouraging customers to buy 
only what they need. Chouinard’s 2005 memoir, Let My People 
Go Surfing, explains his commitment to a workplace where 
capitalism, ethics, and fun can coexist. Chouinard minimizes 
workplace monitoring, believing lightly supervised employees 
will complete their work responsibly. Good surf and fresh 
snow are embraced at Patagonia where employees are free 
to take breaks for fun. Patagonia is often recognized as one of 
the best companies to work for in America.
 
Chouinard has become famous for his sense of social 
responsibility and his leadership in the environmental 
movement. Since 1985, Patagonia has donated 1 percent of 
its annual sales to environmental groups. Chouinard’s 2012 
book, The Responsible Company, details methods for mak-
ing money while avoiding undue societal damage.
 
Chouinard threatened to leave Patagonia in 1994 when he 
learned that the cotton bought by the company often was 
produced by industrial farming that used toxic chemicals and 
was having, he felt, a devastating effect on the Earth. That 
cotton figured in 20 percent of the company’s sales, but 
 Patagonia changed over to organic cotton and persuaded 
others such as Nike and Timberland to begin to do the same. 
Chouinard said that Patagonia went a year without making a 
profit while the company found organic suppliers, overcame 
bankers’ resistance, and found new gins and mills. The big-
ger point is that the switch was profitable and the right thing 
to do, a concept often missed by corporate America, he said.
 
Patagonia clothing is made in China, Thailand,  Vietnam, 
and a number of other countries along with limited produc-
tion in the United States. In establishing ties with a new 
manufacturing partner, Patagonia’s Social and Environmen-
tal Responsibility team does a comprehensive analysis and 
follows up with constant audits,  visits, and corrective meas-
ures to assure a safe, healthy, environmentally sound opera-
tion. Patagonia refuses to contract with companies 
employing workers under the age of 15, the minimum  age 
acceptable to the International Labor Organization. All work-
ers must be paid “a legal minimum wage,” but Patagonia 
admits to falling short of its goal of a “living wage” for all 
those who make its products. [For more detail about 
 Chouinard and Patagonia, see, e.g., Seth Stevenson, “Amer-
ica’s Most Unlikely Corporate Guru,”The Wall Street Journal 
Magazine, May 2012, p. 86.]
Questions
1. Is Chouinard correct that companies can treat workers 
well, respect the environment, and still make money? 
Explain.
2. If he is correct, why aren’t all companies following the 
Patagonia model?

Yvon Chouinard and Patagonia
Introduction
The Yvon Chouinard/Patagonia story expresses the central mission of this chapter; the 
examination of the corporation’s duties, if any, beyond providing the best products and 
services at the lowest price. We ask in this chapter whether the corporation must make a 
broad contribution to the general societal welfare beyond the performance required by the 
market. Put another way, must the corporation fulfill the role of citizen with all of the 
 responsibilities that corporate wealth and power suggest? Clearly, tomorrow’s leaders

The extraordinary wealth of America’s corporate institutions is such that they tower over 
most countries of the world by some measures of economic might. If we compare corporate 
revenue with gross national product, (a common approach, but one that somewhat over-
states the size of corporations relative to countries) Walmart is the 25th largest economic 
entity in the world and 42 of the 100 largest economic entities are corporations.2
 
ExxonMobil, number two on the Fortune 500 list, is often cited as an example of threaten-
ing and sometimes abusive corporate power. Highly respected investigative journalist Steve 
Coll released  Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power3 his 2012 book detailing a 
company that operates much like a nation, as described by  reviewer Adam Hochschild:
[T]his book isn’t so much a story of ExxonMobil’s influence over the American government. 
Rather, it’s a picture of a corporation so large and powerful—operating in some 200 nations 
and territories—that it really has its own foreign policy.

must understand the increasingly complex and interdependent relationship between  business 
and the larger society. We explore the changing nature of that relationship in four parts: 
(1) criticism of corporate America, (2) the emergence of the expectation of corporate social 
responsibility, (3) the management of social responsibility, and (4) the examination of some 
specific business and society issues.
Part One—Corporate Power and Corporate Critics
Corporate critics have long argued that the public interest has not been well served by 
America’s big corporations. We recognize that colossal size and the economies of scale 
that accompany it have been critical to American competitiveness in today’s tough global 
market. At the same time, that very size, the critics say, permits continuing abuse of the 
American public. Of course, we recognize that big companies are a fixture of the American 
landscape. However, a reminder of the specifics may be useful. (This chapter’s examina-
tion of corporate America is limited to the critics’ objections to corporate conduct. The 
legal standards governing corporate practice are addressed primarily in Chapter 9.)
 
Walmart is now the largest company in America (see Table 3.1) and the first service com-
pany to hold the top spot. Walmart is, by a wide margin, America’s number-one employer 
with some 2.2 million workers globally, 1.4 million of whom work in the United States.1

Chapter Three  The Corporation and Public Policy: Expanding Responsibilities  93
. . . ExxonMobil has its own armies. . . . In Chad, its 2,500 security men patrolled the countryside 
in white radio-equipped S.U.V.’s, watching for guerrillas as the company set up an intelligence 
operation bigger and better than the local C.I.A. station. In the war-[w]racked Niger Delta, it gave 
boats to the Nigerian Navy, deployed its own vessels at sea to scout for pirates and “recruited, 
paid, supplied and managed sections of the Nigerian military and police.”4
Another reviewer reminds us, however, that Coll’s book portrays ExxonMobil as possess-
ing “an honorable if rigid culture that seeks to supply a product . . . that a functioning soci-
ety actually must have.”5
 
Predictably, we have a conflicted view of big corporations. Sixty-seven percent of 
Americans express a favorable opinion, according to a 2012 nationwide survey, but 
76 percent say too much power is concentrated in a few large companies. In a bit of a sur-
prise, younger Americans responding to the survey had a slightly more favorable attitude 
toward big business than did their elders.6
The Corporate State— Economics
Perhaps the most pressing and immediate fear about corporate power is that it threatens 
America’s economy rather than strengthens it. Mounting evidence shows an ongoing shift 
in the distribution of national income from workers to owners, and economists are increas-
ingly concerned that concentrated power is reducing America’s legendary and crucial 
power to innovate and thereby improve life for all.7
 
We see most of America’s 50 states fighting feverishly among themselves to attract 
new corporate investment. The states compete by improving their “business climates” with 
incentives such as reduced taxes, reduced regulations, and cash grants. According to The 
New York Times, those incentives total at least $80 billion per year.8 Of course, that corpo-
rate investment brings new jobs, an expanded tax base, and better lives in many ways, but 
the critics are concerned about the point at which incentives become unjustified corporate 
welfare.
 
Sometimes communities have mixed feelings about their success in generating corpo-
rate investment. Quincy, Washington, for example, was able to attract a massive Microsoft 
data center with the help of substantial incentives only to find that the company allegedly 
polluted the local environment with exhaust from giant, backup diesel generators while 
disputing utility penalties, as reported by The New York Times:
In an attempt to erase a $210,000 penalty the utility said the company owed for overestimat-
ing its power use, Microsoft proceeded to simply waste millions of watts of electricity, re-
cords show. Then it threatened to continue burning power in what it acknowledged was an 
“unnecessarily wasteful” way until the fine was substantially cut. . . .”9
Taxes
Ingeniously exploiting tax code loopholes, Apple reportedly shielded at least $74 billion 
in profits from U.S. taxation for the years 2009 to 2012 by  setting up affiliates in Ireland 
that had no employees and no physical offices.10 Those  affiliates  received most of Apple’s 
European and Asian profits, but since they were incorporated in Ireland, they were 

94  Unit One  Business and Society
 exempt from immediate U.S. taxation. Then Apple reportedly demonstrated that the 
 affiliates were managed from Apple’s headquarters in California, thus  exempting the 
profits from Irish taxes.11 
 
Apple was not alone in its tax avoidance success. A 2011 study found that 78 of Amer-
ica’s biggest publicly traded companies paid no federal income taxes in at least one of the 
three years studied. The corporate share of American taxes has fallen in recent years to 
about 1.3 percent of the gross domestic product, a decline from 6 percent during the 1950s 
(part of that decline is due to a reduction in the number of businesses filing taxes as corpo-
rations).12 Nonetheless, many experts argue that we should lower or do away with corpo-
rate taxes. America’s combined federal and state corporate tax rates are now considered 
the highest in the world at 39.2 percent.13 “Loopholes,” however, allow American corpora-
tions to pay an actual rate of about 29.2 percent, which is somewhat below average glob-
ally, according to a U.S. Treasury Department analysis.14 Regardless of rates and loopholes, 
we should remember that many large corporations do pay very significant amounts of 
taxes. ExxonMobil paid about $31 billion in federal income taxes in 2012, ranking it first 
among American companies in payments, while Chevron ($20 billion) and Apple ($14.21 
billion) ranked second and third.15

loopholes at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sknt-UBRhxo]
Misconduct/Incompetence?
When Fox News asked Americans in a recent poll to say whether a series of people and in-
stitutions were helping or hurting the economy, the lowest score went to corporate chief  ex-
ecutives. By almost six to one, voters said corporate chiefs had done more to hurt than to 
help the economy—a worse rating than accorded the president, congressional Republicans or 
Democrats, labor unions or lawmakers affiliated with the tea party.16
Some polls17 place more blame with politicians than with the business community, but 
the stunning scandals and financial failures of recent years (the subprime loan collapse, 
Bernard Madoff’s $65 billion Ponzi scheme, Wall Street’s meltdown, Enron, World-
Com, and so on) have strengthened doubts about corporate honor and competence. As 
we discussed in Chapter 2, the big banks in particular have been harshly criticized. Roll-
ing Stone magazine said, “Financial crooks brought down the world’s economy. . . .”18 A 
New York Times headline ran, “On Wall Street, a Culture of Greed Won’t Let Go.”19 
New York Times columnist Eduardo Porter cites a recent Gallup Poll finding that only 
one in five Americans has much trust in banks and asks, “Have corporations lost what-
ever ethical compass they once had?”20 Or perhaps, he says, we are simply paying closer 
attention in these troubled times.
Monopoly and More
To the critics, a big portion of the corporate power problem is attributable to the structure 
of our economy, a structure they believe to be so concentrated that many industries and 
companies are no longer fully responsive to market commands. Further, those industries 
and companies are so powerful that the government cannot meaningfully regulate them, 
the critics say. Barry C. Lynn’s 2010 book, Cornered: The New Monopoly Capitalism and 

Chapter Three  The Corporation and Public Policy: Expanding Responsibilities  95
the Economics of  Destruction, makes the claim that much of America’s economy is dom-
inated by shared monopolies allowing producers and retailers to charge inflated prices 
because of a lack of meaningful competition. He points to domination by two or three 
giants in a wide array of consumer product markets: beer, toothpaste, pet foods, milk, and 
so on. Walmart and other retail goliaths cooperate so closely with their suppliers in pric-
ing, shelf space assignments, and other details, that, Lynn claims, real competition simply 
doesn’t exist in many product lines.21 (For much more detail about monopoly problems 
and antitrust law, see Chapters 10 and 11.)
 
Likewise, complaints about the corporate role in pollution, discrimination, white-collar 
crime, misleading advertising, and so on remain commonplace. But in a democratic, free-
market society such as America’s, presumably we all must share some of the blame for our 
 problems. If we are not happy with, for example, Walmart’s treatment of its employees, we 
are free to shop elsewhere. Arguably, then, the role of business in American life merely 
 reflects the values of the American people. 
 
Furthermore, as we continue to think about the corporate power theme, we should 
note the ongoing decline in the number of American public corporations (those whose 
securities are offered for sale to the general public). Public companies have driven 
capitalism since their invention in the mid-1800s, but their numbers have been shrink-
ing in the United States. Scandals, increasing regulation, and alternative business 
forms, such as partnerships (see Chapter 9), are among the forces that have combined 
to reduce public corporation numbers. Increasingly, investment money is being raised 
privately rather than through open sales on stock markets. Whether we are seeing the 
twilight of public companies is highly debated, but we should not be surprised to see a 
continued reshaping of the business landscape in ways that may put a new slant on 
corporate power concerns.
Globalization
When the Rana Plaza eight-story garment factory collapsed outside Dhaka, Bangladesh, 
on April 24, 2013, at least 1,127 workers were killed, but perhaps a new global  awareness 
of sweatshop working conditions and careless, if not abusive, international supply chains 
may have emerged. A Bangladeshi government report concluded that the building had 
been constructed with substandard materials and a disregard for building co des. Upper 
floors were illegally added to the building and large power generators installed on those 
floors shook the building when they were switched on. On the day of the collapse, 
 factory owners apparently ordered workers to enter the building 
despite cracks in the walls and other evidence of safety hazards.22 
The collapse was one in a long line of accidents and fires in the 
Bangladeshi garment industry that provides  desperately-need jobs 
but is caught in a race to the bottom to provide the globe’s 
 cheapest labor.
 
Our tightly-interconnected, highly efficient global supply systems have brought  millions 
of jobs, substantial capital, and vital first steps on a path toward prosperity for currently 
struggling nations such as Bangladesh. Only China exceeds Bangladesh’s $20 billion 
 annual apparel export business. But globalization of the garment industry and many others 
has also brought new challenges, particularly for the wealthy, powerful Western

 manufacturers who profit spectacularly from cheap labor in less developed nations. Major 
brands such as Gap, H&M, and Walmart are among the many that are supplied by garment 
factories in Bangladesh. 
 
Who is responsible, and what should be done? At this writing, two apparel groups 
(a largely European collective including H&M and an American group headed by 
Walmart and The Gap) have reached a preliminary safety agreement with government 
and labor groups. Tentative requirements include factory inspections by experienced 
personnel, a limit to the number of machines per floor, and exits at intervals not to 
exceed 25 meters. The two apparel groups have committed to sharing the cost of the 
safety improvements. Meanwhile, the Bangladeshi government has taken initial steps 
toward raising the $38 per month minimum wage while many companies have quickly 
looked toward alternative supplier sites in countries such as Cambodia and Guatemala. 
Of course, other countries and other companies face similar problems. For example, 
Apple has been harshly criticized for abusive labor conditions in its Chinese supplier 
factories, including accusations of child labor, unlawful overtime, harsh discipline, 
and unsafe working conditions. 
Question
Canada’s Loblaw Companies Limited, owner of the Joe Fresh brand, was among the compa-
nies whose clothing was produced at the collapsed factory. (Loblaw quickly announced that it 
would pay compensation to the families of victims.) Ethics expert Chris MacDonald responded 
to the tragedy by saying, “I’m still shopping at Joe Fresh. . . and with a clear conscience.”23
 
Can we all continue to shop for cheap clothing while maintaining a clear conscience? 
Explain.
Globalization Fears  The garment factory tragedy vividly illustrates the critics’ worry 
that global free trade is merely an opportunity for America’s giant corporations to exploit 
cheap, powerless labor abroad. Further, the outsourcing of good, high-paid factory jobs 
from the United States to less developed nations has fundamentally challenged and 
changed life in this country. 
 
In general, we can see that concerns about corporate domination of American life are 
now being applied to the entire globe. With the triumph of capitali sm, in its various permu-
tations (see Chapter 1), the world has come to understand that free markets usually are more 
efficient decision makers than government rules. As a result, national boundaries are reced-
ing in importance, technology is shrinking the globe, multinational companies are treating 
the world as one big marketing opportunity, less developed countries are trying to improve 
their living standards by connecting to that market, financial assets are flowing freely and 
almost instantaneously from one edge of the globe to another, and the world is becoming 
one highly greased, interconnected mass market. 
 
Clearly, the universal advance of American corporate interests has produced problems, 
but enormous gains have also been achieved. The interesting question for our purposes is 
whether globalization brings with it new responsibilities for American corporations such 
as those raised in the wake of the garment factory deaths in Bangladesh. As McDonald’s, 
Apple, and American popular culture capture the attention of the global populace, does 
that increasing “Americanization” or “Westernization” bring new corporate duties? For 

Chapter Three  The Corporation and Public Policy: Expanding Responsibilities  97
example, does the corporate community bear any responsibility for the ongoing conflict 
between Western and Muslim values? For the most part, governments are expected to 
 address questions of that nature, but as globalization has magnified corporate power, we 
must wonder whether corporations won’t increasingly be expected to fulfill expanded, and, 
doubtless, uncomfortable new roles. Harvard Business School professor Christopher 
 Bartlett explains:
[T]hose leading today’s multination corporations must become much more attuned to the 
ways in which their actions can and do impact the fragile social, political, and economic 
 environments in which they operate worldwide. Yet far too often these powerful companies 
have been so focused on their core economic role that they have ignored the huge social and 
political impact they have.24 
Corporations as Psychopaths?
The 2004 movie documentary The Corporation argues that the corporation has become the 
dominant institution in American life, exceeding the influence of both religion and govern-
ment. One result is that corporations often demonstrate the “traits of the prototypical psy-
chopath.” The contemporary corporation is depicted as an “exploitative monster” driven 
not by the greater good but by its first responsibility to stockholders.
Questions
1. In your view are corporations more powerful than government, religion, our educa-

2. According to some polls, nearly three-quarters of Americans think corporations have 
too much power. Do you agree that corporations are too powerful? Explain.

The Corporate State—Politics
We turn now to politics, where, critics argue, big money enables the business community 
to disproportionately influence the electoral and law-making processes.
 
In recent decades, the corporate community has taken an increasingly direct role in the 
political process. As a result, corporate critics have been concerned that the financial weight 
of big business will undermine our pluralist, democratic approach to governance.
 
Corporate funds cannot lawfully be given directly to candidates for federal office. 
 However, corporations (as well as labor unions, special interest groups, and others) can 
lawfully establish political action committees (PACs) to solicit and disburse voluntary 
campaign contributions. That is, corporations can solicit contributions from employees, 
shareholders, and others. That money is then put in a fund, carefully segregated from 
 general corporate accounts, and disbursed by the PAC in support of a political agenda pre-
ferred by officers, managers, or shareholders. Although PAC contributions are voluntary, 

98  Unit One  Business and Society
corporate employees often feel pressured to participate. Unlike the federal rules, about 
one-half of the states allow corporations to lawfully donate corporate funds to  parties and 
candidates for state elections. 
 
The role of conventional PACs in the political process has re-
ceded in importance following a momentous U.S. Supreme Court 
decision in the 2010 Citizens United case25 The Supreme Court’s 
highly controversial 5–4 ruling held that federal laws limiting cor-
porate campaign contributions violated corporate free speech rights. Essentially, the deci-
sion allows corporations, labor unions, and some other aggregations to spend unlimited 
organizational funds for candidates and causes so long as they do not coordinate that 
spending with parties and/or candidates.
 
The five “conservative” justices in the Citizens United majority, treating dollars as 
speech, saw political spending limits as a direct denial of liberty guaranteed by the 
First Amendment. Corporations and labor unions were viewed by the Court as associa-
tions of individuals that should possess the same constitutional rights as the individu-
als themselves. Previous high court rulings had frequently recognized that First 
Amendment rights extend to corporations and that corporations are persons for some 
legal purposes. The four dissenters, from the “liberal” wing of the Court, argued that 
corporations and unions, in many other ways, are not treated as people and doing so in 
the case of political contributions could  allow those organizations to dominate and 
further corrupt the political process.
 
In practice, Citizens United and other court decisions have allowed rapid changes in the 
nature of the national political process by opening the door to gushers of personal and cor-
porate money funneled through Independent Expend iture PACs (usually called Super 
PACs) and nonprofit 501(c)4 Social Welfare Organizations. The latter groups, such as 
volunteer fire departments, must be designed to serve the common good if they want to 
maintain their preferred Internal Revenue Service status which exempts them from paying 
federal income taxes on the money they raise. These organizations can make political con-
tributions in support of their goals as long as political activity is not their primary purpose. 
Thus, 501(c)4 groups are created to receive giant sums of money in support of a social 
welfare cause such as reduced government spending and a portion of that money typically 
is then spent on political advertising. For some, the 501(c)4 groups are particularly attrac-
tive because contributors’ names need not be disclosed while the names of Super PAC 
donors, on the other hand, must be revealed.
Corporate Influence
Independent groups, including various forms of Super PACs, spent more than 
$1  billion in trying to influence the 2012 national election in which President Obama 
secured his second term. Much of that money came from corporations and wealthy 
individuals. Were those big-money contributors able to “buy” the election? Did the 
broadly condemned Citizens United decision lead to corporate domination of the 
 electoral process? The direct and immediate answer to those questions based upon 
 results from the 2012 election was a resounding “no.” The critics’ worst fears simply 
were not realized. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for example, spent nearly 
$24 million backing conservative candidates in 15 U.S. Senate races, but only two of 
The Supreme Court’s highly 
controversial 5–4 ruling.

Chapter Three  The Corporation and Public Policy: Expanding Responsibilities  99
those  candidates prevailed.26 The Chamber spent more than $7 million in 22 U.S. 
House of Representatives races and enjoyed four wins.27 
 
Despite those 2012 results, big money, of course, will continue to be a powerful force 
in electoral performance. Moreover, that money shapes the subsequent legislative process, 
as argued by Ezra Klein of The Washington Post:
If you step back, then, two things are happening simultaneously among the key interest 
groups in American politics. Labor is getting weaker. And corporations, in part due to Citi-
zens United, are getting much stronger. The electoral effect of that is obvious: It favors Re-
publicans. But the legislative effect is, perhaps, more significant: It favors corporate interests 
in Congress, as Democrats will have to be that much more solicitous of business demands in 
order to keep from being spent into oblivion.28 
Change the Law?  Many Americans are arguing that we should amend the U.S. Constitu-
tion to make it clear that money does not constitute speech and that corporations are not 
entitled to the inalienable rights of persons. Congress has considered but to this point re-
jected legislation requiring, in brief, the disclosure of all those giving more than $10,000 to 
political causes. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering a rule 
requiring all publicly held corporations to reveal their political spending. PACs already 
must do so, but the proposed SEC rule would reach the aforementioned “social welfare” 
groups and would include trade associations such as the Chamber of Commerce. 
 
In considering these concerns about corporate political spending, we need to remember 
that labor unions and other groups also have a big monetary voice in the political process. 
Thus, as The Wall Street Journal argues, corporations need to be sure that their voices are 
heard in the political process:
[P]oliticians have created a gargantuan state that is so intrusive that busi nesses have no alter-
native than to spend money to defend themselves and their shareholders. . . . Liberals want 
business to disarm unilaterally.29
Furthermore, a recent study found that “corporate political efforts generally have positive 
effects on a firm’s market value and its shareholder returns.”30 Arguably, then, corporations, 
in looking out for shareholder welfare, need to be very active in the political process.
Boycott Target?
The Citizens United decision seems to have given a legal and psychological boost to corpo-
rate political contributions, but the risks can be significant. Minnesota-based  Target’s 
$150,000 contribution in 2010 to MN Forward, a group supporting a conservative candi-
date for  Minnesota governor was angrily assailed by some company  employees and 
many Minnesota progressives. The specific objection was that the candidate  indirectly sup-
ported by Target was an outspoken opponent of gay marriage. Target said it supported the 
candidate’s strong pro-business policies. Nonetheless, protesters rallied against the company 
and urged a boycott of Target stores. Target issued an apology, reaffirmed its commitment to 
diversity, and promised a review process for political  donations. Then in 2012, Target upset 
those on the other side of the gay marriage debate by selling T-shirts to raise money for a 
group that supported lawful gay marriage.

Lobbying
Lobbying is an essential ingredient in big business strategy. Lobbying also often serves 
the very useful role of efficiently educating busy politicians about the vast array of  issues 
they must address but cannot possibly master without assistance. Of course,  lobbying is 
not confined to the business community. Labor unions, consumer and environmental in-
terest groups and myriad others battle to have their voices heard. So lobbying serves a 
valuable role in government. Unfortunately, that role is often thoroughly corrupt. The 
clubby, personal nature of the lobbying process with its revolving door of politicians be-
coming lobbyists and lobbyists taking important government roles often undermines the 
democratic process.
 
Part of the blame for the nation’s disastrous subprime mortgage crisis, for example, 
doubtless rests with lenders’ ability to exert influence over government decision making. 
The Washington Post recently reported about former mortgage giant Countrywide Finan-
cial Corp.’s practice of making discount loans to former and current member s of Congress 
and to executives at the taxpayer-backed mortgage company, Fannie Mae. While extend-
ing those favors, Countrywide was lobbying to block legislation that would have decreased 
the sale of subprime mortgages. Indeed, when Countrywide employees resisted making 
loans to Jim Johnson, CEO of Fannie Mae from 1991 to 1998, because he reportedly had a 
low credit score, Countrywide CEO Angelo Mozillo rejected those concerns saying, “Jim 
Johnson continues to be a source of many loans for our company and this is just a small 
token of appreciation for the business that he sends to us.”31
Lobbying by the Numbers
Total lobbying spending in Washington, D.C. for 2012 was about $3.3 billion and more 
than 12,000 individuals were registered as lobbyists.32 Both numbers reflect a pattern of 
declines from previous years spurred, in part, by changes in federal lobbying rules. The 
Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 was part of the most comprehen-
sive lobbying and ethics reform effort in the federal government in many years. Studies 
and expert opinion, however, indicate that some of those who influence government are 
able to avoid registering as lobbyists by turning from direct legislative contact to new 
 influence-peddling tactics such as social media campaigns.33 Furthermore, the “revolving 
door” between Congress and lobbying firms remains robust with more than 340 former 
members of Congress and nearly 3,700 former government staffers working in lobbying or

in  a related field, according to a 2011 report.34 The biggest spenders among lobbyists con-
tinue to be business groups with the Chamber of Commerce at the top with nearly $17 
million in expenditures in the first quarter of 2013.35
Buy Votes?
In the end, does all of the corporate money buy votes? In many cases, apparently not. 
A  recent, highly respected study of lobbying results found that most lobbying simply 
maintains the status quo; that is, nothing happens. The study concluded that opposing 
lobbyists and interest groups hold each other in check about 60 percent of the time. 
Thus, lobbyists, over a four-year period are successful in influencing policy about 
40 percent of the time. The study also concluded that money influenced outcomes only 
when heavily weighted to one side.36 
 
On the other hand, when lobbying is succe ssful the payoff can be enormous. Just two 
weeks after agreeing to pay $762 million in penalties for marketing fraud, Amgen, the 
world’s largest biotechnology company, was able to celebrate, nonetheless, when Con-
gress included language in a financing bill that gave Amgen and others two additional 
years to sell a particular class of drugs without government price controls.37 The delay is 
expected to cost Medicare up to $500 million.38 Amgen, with 74 Washington lobbyists, 
reportedly was the only company arguing aggressively for the delay.39 The New York 
Times decried the deal: “This dreadful episode is a classic example of the power of spe-
cial interests to shape legislation and shows how hard it may be to carry out the reforms 
needed to cut health care costs.”40 
 
A Sunlight Foundation study of 200 corporations found that those firms investing heav-
ily in lobbying enjoyed lower federal tax rates.41 Lobbying influence even extends to writ-
ing the law itself, as The New York Times reported in 2013 about a bill that is under 
consideration at this writing:
Bank lobbyists are not leaving it to lawmakers to draft legislation that softens financial regu-
lations. Instead, the lobbyists are helping to write it themselves. One bill that sailed through 
the House Financial Services Committee this month—over the objections of the Treasury 
Department—was essentially Citigroup’s. . . . Citigroup’s recommendations were reflected 
in more than 70 lines of the House committee’s 85-line bill. Two crucial paragraphs, pre-
pared by Citigroup in conjunction with other Wall Street banks, were copied nearly word for 
word. (Lawmakers changed two words to make them plural.)42 
Of course, Congress benefits from lobbyists’ expertise in drafting legislation dealing with 
highly technical dimensions of American life, including the financial services industry.

The Corporate State—Social Issues and Institutions
Clearly, the business community’s influence in America’s economic and political life is enor-
mous, but the critics’ concerns do not end there. The corporate message, they say, pervades 
and shapes American life. Business products and services, business marketing, and business 
values saturate and dominate all corners of American life, the critics claim.43

Schools
Advertising and Promotion  Seeking quality education for their own needs and for the 
nation, corporations now prepare model curricula and lesson plans while donating money 
and other resources to improve school performance. Sometimes, however, those contribu-
tions can be unbalanced and self-serving while commercializing the classroom setting. 
Scholastic, the world’s largest publisher of children’s books, decided to revise its approach 
to corporate-sponsored projects after being criticized by the Boston advocacy group Cam-
paign for a Commercial-Free Childhood. Scholastic had distributed learning materials 
from the coal industry, for example, that saluted the benefits of coal but failed to mention 
its environmental hazards. Brita, which sells water filters, had sponsored a Scholastic pro-
gram featuring the environmental hazards of plastic water bottles. Those programs and 
some others sponsored by corporate interests reportedly have been removed from Scholas-
tic’s materials and a new vetting process is in place to review corporate contributions.44
 
Faced with public resistance to increased school funding, administrators in many school 
districts are selling ad space on school buses, websites, buildings, textbook covers, and 
even report cards. Critics worry that advertising in school settings encourages materialism, 
celebrates dubious values, and discourages critical thinking. Timothy Wysong, the trans-
portation director at a Texas school district that sells bus advertising says, however, that 
students do not pay much attention to the ads and when they do notice they approve: 
“‘They might refer to themselves as the Chick-fil-A bus, for example,’ he said. ‘It’s a little 
identity for them.’”45 
 
Channel One has supplied educational programming and television sets to schools that 
agree to show the programming and accompanying ads on a regular basis. About 5 million 
children watch Channel One. The 12-minute telecasts include two minutes of ads. Channel 
One says that advertisers do not influence the news content, and the programming has won 
awards for excellence.46 A 2006 study of middle school students, however, demonstrates 
the commercial risks of Channel One. The students remembered more of the ads than they 
did the news programs, and the students reported buying or having their parents buy prod-
ucts advertised on Channel One.47 (The study made no effort to separate the influence of 
Channel One ads from other ads that the students might have encountered.) [For the Chan-
nel One news, see http://www.channelone.com]
Manage Public Schools  Many K–12 school districts across the country (e.g., Philadelphia, 
Chicago, and Gary, Indiana) have contracted with private companies such as EdisonLearning 
to consult with or operate some of their struggling public schools. Furthermore, Edison and 
several other national, for-profit companies are competing from state to state to offer new, 
online schools. More than 30,000 Ohio students, for example, are enrolled in online schools.48 
The hope is that competition and for-profit efficiencies will improve educational quality 
while lowering costs, but the results to date have not been particularly encouraging,49 and 
critics see these efforts as a dangerous expansion of corporate values and authority.
Higher Education  Big business is also accused of turning college campuses into market-
ing and development opportunities, as The New York Times vividly described:

stuffed animals in tow, is feeling some freshman angst. A few friendly upperclassmen

spring into action. But wait: there is something odd, or at least oddly corporate, about 
this welcome wagon. These U.N.C. students are all wearing identical T-shirts from 
American Eagle Outfitters. Turns out three of them are working for that youth clothing 
chain on this late August morning, as what are known in the trade as “brand ambassa-
dors” or “campus Evangelists”—and they have recruited several dozen friends as a vol-
unteer move-in crew.50
An estimated 10,000 students work on campus marketing Red Bull, Hewlett-Packard PCs, 
and much more, in unprecedented sales campaigns. As The Times observed, “Corporations 
have been pitching college students for decades on products from cars to credit cards. But 
what is happening on campuses today is without rival, in terms of commercializing every-
day college life.”51
 
From kindergarten through graduate school, education is increasingly viewed as a prod-
uct to be marketed and consumed on the road to prosperity in the corporate state. Recently, 
Gene D. Block, chancellor of the University of California at Los Angeles, criticized those 
who encourage students to measure and evaluate the college experience as a financial 
equation:
Universities, particularly those supported with public funds, exist to serve society. Asking 
students to choose a future based on a salary scale does not serve society and, often, does not 
serve the individual. Students need freedom and encouragement to find their passions and 
strengths. Framing decisions about college as a cost-benefit analysis will not encourage the 
creativity and risk-taking that has made this nation great.52
Questions
The Wall Street Journal recently talked with critics, including corporate recruiters who are 
increasingly skeptical about the value of an undergraduate business degree:
[N]ow faculty members, school administrators and corporate recruiters are questioning the 
value of a business degree at the undergraduate level. The biggest complaint: The undergrad-
uate degrees focus too much on the nuts and bolts of finance and accounting and don’t de-
velop enough critical thinking and problem-solving skills through long essays, in-class 
debates and other hallmarks of liberal-arts courses.53

Religion
The ideas of management guru Peter Drucker have become the unexpected intellectual founda-
tion of the megachurch movement in America. The giant churches with thousands of parishion-
ers in cavernous halls have applied Drucker’s business principles to their “businesses”:
Bill Hybels, the pastor of the 17,000-strong Willow Creek Community Church in South Bar-
rington, Illinois, has a quotation from Mr. Drucker hanging outside his office: “What is our 
business? Who is our customer? What does the customer consider the value?”54
 
Churches now routinely employ standard business practices 
such as advertising, promotional giveaways, and marketing cam-
paigns.  Religion, in some sense, has become a product. Some  pastors

preach the “prosperity gospel” that material success is a mark of God’s favor. The Reverend 
Troy Gramling, pastor of the Potential Church in Fort Lauderdale, Florida is building a 
global congregation. He says he has tried to copy the success of Starbucks’ branding strat-
egy, and he once attracted new members by giving away $10 Starbucks gift cards.55
 
Megachurch pastor David Platt questions the commercial  direction of contemporary religion 
in his book, Radical: Taking Back Your Faith from the American Dream. Platt says the mega-
churches have taken on corporate characteristics in competing for mar-
ket share by serving as social centers while offering day care and 
comfortable entertainment. Platt asks his followers to put a cap on their 
consumer lives, believing that our pursuit of the materialist American 
Dream cannot be reconciled with an authentic spiritual life.56
 
To many Christians, Jesus is a pop-culture icon and thus is the inspiration for a vast ar-
ray of commercial expressions including T-shirts, license plates, dolls, video games, flip 
flops, perfume, golf balls, scripture chocolates, and much more. The marriage of religion 
and commerce has even reached the business of sports where “Faith Nights” have become 
popular promotional devices at professional ball games. Several major league baseball 
teams have sponsored Faith Nights, but that  approach has been  particularly successful in 
the minor leagues where Christian entertainers, player  testimonies, faith trivia quizzes, and 
bobbleheads of Samson and other biblical  characters draw big crowds. [For a review of

Culture
Does America possess a cultural life? For decades, the concern was that so-called high 
culture—classical music, opera, ballet, and the like—would give way to rock and roll, 
television, and video games. Now that battle is over; Americans (and the world) have 
clearly voted for The Voice and American Idol.
Corporate America has been generous in its financial and organi-
zational support for the traditional intellectual culture. At the same 
time, corporate bottom-line concerns appear to the critics to be 
steadily degrading America’s cultural life.
 
For example, the world-fam ous art extravaganza Art Basel 
 Miami Beach, a financial blessing to artists, is widely criticized for its celebration of 
money, consumer excess, and sometimes wretched taste. Much of that excess, according to 
the critics, is attributable to corporate sponsors, as The New York Times explained:
In Miami Beach, at the main fair, the consumer-oriented glitter abounds this week:  coffee carts 
with $20-a-glass Ruinart Champagne; Davidoff cigar rollers; BMW’s  artist-designed cars; and 
Takashi Murakami’s $70,000-and-up commissioned portraits. One could almost imagine that the

one line and an unprintable expletive on the next—had an invisible subtitle telling the wealthy 
V.I.P.’s who had come to shop, “I’m Talking to You—Yeah, You!”57
 
Even popular culture (rock, movies, television, hip hop, and so on), already considered a 
wasteland, has been further debased the critics say, not merely by a mindless market (that’s us), 
but by limitless corporate greed, indifference to quality, and relentless consolidation.
 The Los Angeles Times asked: “Are the Corporate Suits Ruining 
TV?”58 As the Times explained, “Your TV may receive 200 channels, 
but virtually every one of them is owned by one of six big companies—
NBC Universal, Disney, Time Warner,  Viacom/Paramount, Sony, and 
News Corp.”59 Similarly, one 850-station giant, Clear Channel, dominates and, critics say, 
 debases the radio industry by its “McDonald’s approach to programming” that makes one sta-
tion virtually indistinguishable from another regardless of locale.60 Syndicated shows and 
 national DJs replace independent programming decisions and local personalities resulting in 
increasingly standardized playlists and programs.
 
Perhaps we should applaud corporate America and its acutely tuned marketing machine that 
efficiently provide us with precisely what we want, even if what we want is unlikely to meet the 
critics’ approval. But what if we are mistaken? The consequences for the value of our lives 
might be devastating. Consider, for example, a recent study confirming what your parents have 
told you: “[M]usic has, indeed, become both more homogeneous and louder over the dec-
ades.”61 The 2012 study found that today’s popular music relies largely on the same 10 most 
popular chords that were the foundation of music in the 1950s.  The sound itself has changed, 
however, in that songs are about nine decibels louder on average; apparently part of a “loudness 
race” designed to catch our attention over the noise clutter of our lives.62 
 
But does it matter that current popular music all sounds pretty much the same? Or that 
reality TV is a central feature of American daily life? Or that relentless violence seems to 
be the primary message of the video gaming industry? Does it matter that America’s cor-
porate powers quickly step back from the edgy hip hop message when it strays too far from 
the mainstream, as described in a 2013 New York Times  commentary?
Three times in recent weeks large companies have [severed] ties with rappers they had previ-
ously happily paid to endorse their products: Reebok dropped Rick Ross over objectionable 
lyrics, and PepsiCo’s Mountain Dew did the same to Lil Wayne, just days after it had cut 
short an ad campaign it had worked on with Tyler, the Creator.63
Sports
Former National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) president Myles Brand, speaking at 
an ethics conference, made the argument that “College sports is not a 
 business. It’s about educating young men and women in the field and in 
the classroom.”64 College men’s basketball coaching  legend Bob 
Knight did not agree:
If it isn’t a business then General Motors is a charity. College sports has turned into one of 
the biggest businesses in the whole sports industry. I use the word industry because that’s 
what sport is. . . .65
Knight’s point of view seems indisputable today as college sports programs at the highest level 
are in an increasingly desperate race for money. Most of that money, of course, is tied to and

driven by another enormous industry: television. Louisiana State University chancellor Michael 
Martin wryly spoke to the power of the networks by saying, “I think w e could end up with two 
enormous conferences, one called ESPN and one called FOX.”66 Sports commentator Eric 
Crawford concurred with Martin by saying, “We’re not far away now. We even have a set of 
sub-conferences: Nike, Adidas, Reebok and Under Armour. College sports today are not about 
college and, increasingly, they are not about sports. It’s all business.”67
 
Of course, profit-seeking in collegiate sports is not without its benefits. Thousands of 
students complete college every year who might otherwise not have done so, funding is 
provided for many unprofitable sports including women’s programs, and sports revenues 
often support academic programs. The market has spoken loudly and clearly for the excite-
ment of college sports, but is the market mistaken?
What Have We Lost? The conversion of athletics, both professional and collegiate, from 
sport to business is  essentially an accomplished fact, but its significance remains unclear. 
What have we lost when the innocence and idealism of sports are forfeited in favor of 
profit? Or are innocence and idealism simply a myth? Perhaps we are better off when cor-
porate and personal profit—the free market—drives sports. Or is the pursuit of profit the 
route to the slow but sure death of meaningful sports?
Marketing  Novelist Bill Morris recently bemoaned the “tsunami” of commercialism in col-
lege football.68 In writing about the football b owl season, Morris pointed to the “dozens of 
brand names being spray-painted onto fields,” ranging from the well-known—Allstate and 
Tostitos—to the largely unknown—Gildan and BBVA Compass.69 This explosion of advertis-
ing caused Morris to argue that we should all pause to think about what the college bowl season 
says about the nation’s soul.70 Florida Atlantic University apparently was untroubled by meta-
physical doubts when it accepted $6 million to name its new football facility GEO Group Sta-
dium. GEO Group operates private prisons. David Ridpath, a sports administration professor 
and member of the Drake Group, a network of professors that lobbies for integrity in sports, 
said he felt “ambivalent” about that particular naming deal: “The short answer is, I understand 
to an extent. But it does appear we’re prostituting ourselves to the highest bidder regardless of 
what they represent. Again—the sanctity of higher education matters little when the dollars are 
needed.”71
High School Next? Business values and practices having spread from professional 
sports to college athletics, we should not be surprised, although perhaps we should be 
 dismayed, that the same influences are rapidly emerging in high school sports as well. Elite 
high school teams travel the country to play in special events, more and more games are 
televised, and high school sports facilities attempt to mimic the glow of college and profes-
sional experiences. In Texas, where football is particularly celebrated, the Allen High 
School Eagles play in a new stadium that cost about $60 million.72
 
Will high school football emerge as the next great sports marketing opportunity? Some 
business leaders think so:
“I think high school sports is the next iteration where fans are going,” said Ira Stahlberger, 
senior vice president of strategic partnerships for Intersport . . . “The market follows where 
the fans are. People are extremely passionate about the NFL. They are extremely passionate 
about college football. Next is high school football.”73

I. Beer .
At this writing, 22 of the 120 major college football stadi-
ums sell beer at football games, a total that has more than 
doubled in the past 10 years. During the 2012 season, West 
Virginia University reported a net profit of $520,000 in its 
first year of stadiumwide beer sales. Bowling Green State 
University reportedly nets about $20,000 to $25,000 per sea-
son. For some schools, beer is sold largely to make the to-
tal experience more attractive to fans. The National 
Collegiate Athletic Association bans beer sales and 
 alcohol-related signs at its championship events.74
Questions
1. Do you think universities that sell beer at football 
games are hypocritical in that those same schools en-
ergetically discourage binge drinking by students? 
 Explain. 
2.  Do you think beer sales at collegiate football games is a 
good policy? Explain.
II. Nike.
Timothy Egan in The New York Times commented on 
 Nike’s relationship with Pittsburg Steelers quarterback 
Ben Roethlisberger, who was accused in 2010 of sexual 
assault on a 20-year-old woman:
Is there anything creepier than a big, beer-breathed 
celebrity athlete exposing himself in a night club and 
hitting on underage girls, all the while protected by an 
entourage of off-duty cops? Well, yes. It’s the big, 
corporate sponsor—Nike, in this case—that continues 
to sell product with the creep as their role model.”75
No criminal charges were filed in the case, but Roethlis-
berger was suspended by the National Football League for 
four games, and the owner of the company that marketed 
“Big Ben’s Beef Jerky” reportedly ended his company’s en-
dorsement relationship with the quarterback. Roethlisberger 
had been accused of similar misconduct in other episodes.
Questions
1. Was Nike wrong to retain its endorsement relationship 
with Roethlisberger? Explain.
2. Prior to Roethlisberger’s appearance with the Steel-
ers in the 2011 Super Bowl, Ward Headley, president 
of a Cincinnati-based sports marketing company, said 
the quarterback’s endorsement future would be 
bright, despite past problems, if Pittsburg were to win 
the game:
To me, winning cures everything. Not just to me, but the 
reality is to corporate America and to people, winning is 
the answer.76
 
The Green Bay Packers won that game, but 
Headley’s judgment that winning nullifies past 
transgressions seems to be accurate. Should we 
condemn corporate America or the American people 
for being so willing to forgive winners’ past 
wrongdoing? Explain.

The Sports Business and Compromised Values?
America’s Soul?
Critics contend that the power of the business community has become so encompassing 
that virtually all dimensions of American life have absorbed elements of the business ethic. 
Values commonly associated with businesspeople (competition, profit-seeking, reliance on 
technology, faith in growth) have overwhelmed traditional humanist values (cooperation, 
individual dignity, human rights, meaningful service to society). In the name of wealth, 
efficiency, and productivity, the warmth, decency, and value of life 
have been debased. We engage in meaningless work. Objects domi-
nate our existence. We operate as replaceable cogs in a vast, bureau-
cratic machine. Indeed, we lose ourselves, the critics  argue. Charles 
Objects dominate our 
existence.

Reich, former Yale University law professor, addressed the loss of self in his influential 
book of the Vietnam War era, The Greening of America:
Of all of the forms of impoverishment that can be seen or felt in America, loss of self, or 
death in life, is surely the most devastating. . . . Beginning with school, if not before, an indi-
vidual is systematically stripped of his imagination, his creativity, his heritage, his dreams, 
and his personal uniqueness, in order to style him into a productive unit for a mass, techno-
logical society. Instinct, feeling, and spontaneity are repressed by over-whelming forces. As 
the individual is drawn into the meritocracy, his working life is split from his home life, and 
both suffer from a lack of wholeness. Eventually, people virtually become their professions, 
roles, or occupations, and are henceforth strangers to themselves.77
Some interesting empirical evidence supports Reich’s view that we have become hollow men 
and women dominated by the demands of big institutions. The Harris Alienation Index meas-
ures feelings of economic inequity (the rich get richer, and the poor 
get poorer), feelings of powerlessness (being left out and not counting 
for much) and feelings that those running the country do not really 
care about the welfare of others. Those responses are combined into 
an alienation “score.” That score stood at a low of 29 in its first year, 1966, and has generally 
been rising since with the 2011 score of 63 among the highest ever.78
 
Actor and conservative commentator Ben Stein, speaking in 2006, lamented an increas-
ingly divided America where the interests of corporations and the wealthy are dominant 
and the well-being of others is in danger of being forgotten:
The Saturday before Memorial Day I spoke to a gathering of widows and widowers, parents 
and children of men and women in uniform who have lost their lives in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
The person who spoke before me was a beautiful woman named Joanna Wroblewski, whose 
husband of less than two years—after four years of dating at Rutgers—had been killed in 
Iraq. She cried as she spoke. . . . She spoke of her devotion to her country and her husband’s 
pride in the flag. . . . 
 
Are we keeping the faith with Joanna Wroblewski? . . . Are we maintaining an America 
that is not just a financial neighborhood, but also a brotherhood and a sisterhood worth los-
ing your husband for? Is this still a community of the heart, or a looting opportunity? Will 
there even be a free America for Mrs. Wroblewski’s descendants, or will we be a colony of 
the people [foreign lenders] to whom we have sold our soul?79

1. A brief analysis of social media advertising techniques employed to promote Ford, 
Mello Yello, Grey Poupon, and Sephora emphasized the value and power of those ads 
on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media. The article, entitled “4 Examples of How

3. In 1980 Ted Peters, an associate professor of systematic theology at the Pacific  Lutheran 
Seminary and the Graduate Theological Union, asked:
How will the advancing postindustrial culture influence the course of religion? It is my 
 forecast that religion will become increasingly treated as a consumer item. Because our 
economy produces so much wealth, we are free to consume and consume beyond the point 
of satisfaction. There is a limit to what we can consume in the way of material goods—new 
homes, new cars, new electronic gadgets, new brands of beer, new restaurants, and so on. So 
we go beyond material wants to consume new personal experiences—such as broader travel, 
exotic vacations, continuing education, exciting conventions, psychotherapy, and sky diving.
What will come next and is already on the horizon is the consumption of spiritual 
 experiences—personal growth cults, drug-induced ecstasy, world-traveling gurus, training 
in mystical meditation to make you feel better, etc. Once aware of this trend, religious entrepre-
neurs and mainline denominations alike will take to pandering their wares, advertising how 
much  spiritual realities “can do to you.” It will be subtle, and it will be cloaked in the noble 
language of personal growth, but nevertheless the pressure will be on to treat religious experi-
ence as a commodity for consumption.81
a. Is Peters’s forecast coming true? Explain.
b. Is marketing necessary to the survival and growth of religion? Explain.
c. Is marketing a threat to the legitimacy and value of religion? Explain.
4. In your opinion, which of the following will be the biggest threat to America in the 
 future: big government, big labor, or big business?
5. Do you think allegiance to the company will become more important than allegiance to the 
state? Is that a desirable direction? Raise the arguments on both sides of the latter question.
6. As expressed in BusinessWeek, “Increasingly, the corporation will take over the role of 
the mother, supplying day care facilities where children can be tended around the 
clock.”82 How do you feel about the corporation as mother? Explain.
Part Two—Corporate Social Responsibility
Introduction
We have seen that the business community is intensely criticized. Journalist Daniel Seligman 
put it this way:
A standard view of the American corporation . . . is that it is an efficient deliverer of goods 
and services, yet also a wellspring of social injustice. Driven by a narrow calculus of profits, 
it is oblivious to the common good. And so, the litany goes, it degrades the environment, 
promotes unsafe products, skimps on workplace safety and . . . lays off workers who have 
given it years of service.83
 
That broadly shared perception of business misdeeds or indifference, in conjunction with 
the growing influence of business values throughout American life, has led in recent  decades 
to the development of the doctrine of corporate social responsibility (CSR—sometimes also 
referred to as corporate citizenship). We can express the issue this way: Must business 
 decision making include consideration not merely of the welfare of the firm but of society as 

110  Unit One  Business and Society
a whole? For most contemporary readers, the answer is self-evident—of course business 
bears a social responsibility. Business has enjoyed a central and favored role in American 
life. As such, it must assume a measure of the burden for the welfare of the total society. In-
deed, businesspeople themselves now generally endorse businesses’ responsibility to help 
solve society’s problems. The popular appeal and potential power of CSR is evident, for ex-
ample, in a 2008 PricewaterhouseCoopers survey finding that 88 percent of millennials will 
choose employers based on strong social responsibility values and that 86 percent would 
think about leaving a company whose CSR values did not meet their expectations.84 Similar 
philosophies such as the triple bottom line (giving close accounting attention to social and 
environmental performance as well as financial performance) and the sustainable corpora-
tion (operating the business with a  focus on environmentally sensitive practices that will 
husband scarce resources and maintain a healthy community now and in the future) have 
powerful appeal to many students and managers.
 
Before turning to a more detailed analysis of corporate social responsibility practice, 
let’s think about options you might employ to direct your forthcoming professional life 
toward socially responsible, ethically sustainable business practice. Social enterprise or 
social entrepreneurship is a movement in which people launch nonprofits and businesses 
or take jobs using entrepreneurial and managerial skills for the purpose, in part, of address-
ing social problems.
Social Enterprise/Social Entrepreneurship
Drew Chafetz, in his mid-twenties and a huge soccer fan, did not turn directly to the job market 
following college graduation. Rather, he cofounded love.futbol [see http://www.lovefutbol
.org], an organization to help build safe soccer fields for children in impoverished nations 
who otherwise might be forced to play in the streets or other unsafe spaces. Since founding 
love.futbol in 2006, Chafetz and his cofounder, Alfredo Axtmayer, have encouraged about a 
dozen communities in Guatemala and Brazil to build durable, low-maintenance, concrete 
soccer pitches, and several other projects are in development. Chafetz says that love.futbol’s 
core competency is not building fields but empowering and mobilizing communities to build 
their own. Love.futbol provides materials and direction, but communities must provide the 
land, project planning, and volunteer labor necessary for success.85
 
Others share Chafetz’s social welfare goals but are pursuing them from a profit-seeking 
direction. T-shirt and hoodie maker Sevenly, for example, donates $7 to charitable causes 
for each item sold. Beer halls, pledged to donate their profits to charity, are springing up 
around America and in other nations. Some of those committed to social welfare simply 
seek jobs that allow them to apply their expertise and z eal directly to community causes. 
Dawn Carpenter gave up her high-paying job at JP Morgan to work for a small District of 
Columbia community bank whose customers include D.C. Habitat for Humanity and 
Bread for the City. Carpenter said she “needed to put over two decades of experience to 
work for my mission.”86 Still others believe they can make socially responsible contribu-
tions by taking mainstream, high-paying jobs that help build power stations in developing 
nations, improve financing opportunities for inner-city entrepreneurs, or enable medical 
care to more affordably reach poorer patients, for example. [For an introduction to B

A New Ideology
The ascendance of the social responsibility doctrine represents a striking ideological 
shift. Historically, business was expected to concentrate on one goal—the production 
and distribution of the best products and services at the lowest possible prices. Busi-
ness was largely exempt from any affirmative duty for the resolution of social prob-
lems until the 1950s when business scholars and critics began to encourage a broader 
conception of corporate duty. Now in the 21st century, expectations for business in 
society have been radically  altered. Profit-seeking remains central and essential, but 
for most businesspeople, the sometimes awkward ingredient of social responsibility 
must be a consideration. [For the Business for Social Responsibility home page, see 
www.bsr.org]
What Is Social Responsibility?
The sweeping notion of corporate social responsibility is not readily reduced to a brief 
definition, but Davis and Blomstrom some years ago captured the core ingredients: “The 
idea of social responsibility is that decision makers are obligated to take actions which 
protect and improve the welfare of society as a whole along with their own interests.”87 
More systematically, the social role of business can be thought of as an ideological 
 continuum, corresponding roughly to the familiar American political spectrum of 
 conservative/Republican views on the right, moderates in the middle, and liberal/Democrats 
on the left. Figure 3.1 depicts that continuum and is best understood by reading “backward” 
from right to left. On the right side of the spectrum lies the free-market view holding that 
profit maximization is the best measure of social responsibility. Across the middle

(long-term company interest) lies a hybrid, blended perspective where profits are the first 
consideration, but where satisfied workers, customers, and community members are also 
of importance, within some reasonable limits, to secure the firm’s long-term survival. On 
the left side of the spectrum lies the triple bottom-line/sustainability movement that calls 
for a revolutionary re-visioning of corporate goals and practices such that profit maximiza-
tion is only one of three key measures of success. Triple bottom-line advocates specifically 
call for managerial and accounting practices that respect and measure the firm’s social and 
environmental performance just as the firm’s financial performance is respected and meas-
ured. The goal is to ensure the long-term viability (sustainability) of the organization and 
the total society.
 
Now let’s examine the continuum in a bit more detail. [For the “Global Reporting  Initiative” 
on sustainability practices around the world, see http://www.globalreporting.org]
Profit Maximization Here the dominant concern lies in maximiz-
ing shareholders’ interests. Those shareholders, after all, are the 
owners of the firm. They are taking the  financial risk. Hence, from 
a profit maximization point of view, the only responsible and moral 
course of behavior is to reap the highest return possible, within the 
law. Nobel  prize–winning economist Milton Friedman was the most 
prominent advocate of the profit maximization view:
[In a free economy] there is one and only one social responsibility of business—to use its 
 resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits, so long as it stays within 
the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition, without 
 deception or fraud.88
 
Friedman, employing free-market reasoning, believed the firm that maximizes its profits 
is necessarily maximizing its contribution to society. Furthermore, he argued that any dilu-
tion of the profit-maximizing mode—such as charitable contributions—is a misuse of the 
stockholders’ resources. The individual stockholder, he contended, should dispose of assets 
according to her or his own wishes. Finally, he asked how managers could be  expected to 
know what the public interest is.
 
Herbert Stein, former chair of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers, 
shared  Friedman’s doubts about the idea of social responsibility, but Stein’s concerns 
were of a more pragmatic nature. He argued that business is simply ill suited for solv-
ing social problems:
Efficiency in maximizing the nation’s product . . . is not the only objective of life. But it is 
the one that private corporations are best qualified to serve. I don’t want to be a purist about 
this. I don’t object to corporations contributing to the United Givers Fund. . . . But to rely on 
 corporations’ responsibility to solve major social problems—other than the problem of how 
to put our people and other resources to work most efficiently—would be a wasteful diver-
sion from their most important function. Our other objectives can be better served in other 
ways, by individuals and other institutions.89
Long-Term Company Interest Across the broad middle ground of our social respon-
sibility continuum lie those firms, doubtless the great majority, who believe that a 
strong bottom line, in many cases, requires considerations beyond the immediate, 
The only responsible and
moral course of behavior is
to reap the highest return
possible, within the law.

Chapter Three  The Corporation and Public Policy: Expanding Responsibilities  113
short-run, profit-maximizing interests of the firm. In a sense, these managers are 
merely taking a longer term view of profit maximization. They recognize the impera-
tive of a strong return on the shareholder’s investment, but they also believe that 
achieving that return may  require heightened sensitivity to the welfare of  employees, 
consumers, and the community. Furthermore, they often embrace the view that so-
cially responsible behavior, within  reasonable bounds, is simply the “right thing” to 
do. [For the United Nations’ initiative to encourage responsible corporate citizenship, 
see http://www.unglobalcompact.org]
Triple Bottom Line/Sustainability Managers are being pushed to adopt a bigger, 
broader conception of social responsibility, an approach that will produce a sustaina-
ble, enduring global community where our resources are not dangerously depleted or 
damaged. This expanded standard is explained by social responsibility expert Steve 
Rochlin:
The new corporate citizenship challenges executives to find alternatives to zero-sum solu-
tions that often emphasize shareholder value at the cost of social and environmental welfare. 
Instead, the new corporate citizenship challenges companies to deliver not just financial 
 returns but also environmental and social value—together marking the pillars of what is 
called a “triple bottom line.”. . .
The new corporate citizenship requires business transparency and accountability regard-
ing the ways in which business practices generate benefits and costs for issues ranging from 
 employee diversity, community development, working conditions, clean air and water, 
 human rights, poverty, and corruption.90
 
The triple bottom-line/sustainability approach employs free-market principles and recog-
nizes the necessity for financial success but also argues that social and environmental 
 responsibilities are of equal importance. According to sustainability advocates, corporations 
giving close attention to both social and economic duties have a powerful competitive 
 advantage that will contribute to organizational and societal sustainability. 
 
Building a just, healthy, sustainable future makes a lot of sense, but reasonable 
people continue to differ about the most effective path to that goal. For many compa-
nies, shorter term profit motives continue to dominate. Recent research findings show 
American firms lagging behind their European counterparts in sustainability perfor-
mance with no American firms in the top 10 globally.91 Nonetheless, progress is evi-
dent. Some big American corporations are appointing sustainability officers and 
committing themselves to global sustainability projects. For example, Muhtar Kent, 
Coca-Cola CEO, spoke recently of his company’s close attention to improved prac-
tices in water, packaging, energy conservation, and climate. He went on to specifically 
cite one small but illustrative step forward:
Preeti Gupti, for example, is a mother of three in rural India. In the town of Agra, about 
125 miles south of Delhi, she has a small store in her home, which lacks reliable electrical 
service. With a solar-powered Coca-Cola cooler, she can now sell cold beverages, stay 
open later and help her children study after dark. Her income has also increased, creating 
still more opportunities for her children.92

Social Responsibility Pyramid
Professor Archie Carroll proposed another way of visualizing socially responsible business 
practice as depicted in Figure 3.2. Socially responsible business practice necessarily begins 
at the foundation of the pyramid with the duty to make a profit in a lawful fashion; but 
 simultaneously the socially responsible firm moves (up the pyramid) beyond the funda-
mental demands of economics and law to pursue the ethical course of action—the behavior 
best suited to the demands of virtue and moral principle. In striving for profitable, lawful, 
ethical conduct, that company may also choose to engage in discretionary philanthropic 
(charitable) efforts (money, time, facilities, programs) to build a better community. While 
the social responsibility pyramid has been criticized and revised, it remains a useful way of 
thinking about corporations’ expanding duties.93 [ISO, the International Organization for 
Standardization, has developed a set of guidelines for socially responsible corporate 
 behavior labeled ISO 26000. For an overview of ISO 26000, see http://www.iso.org/iso

“Green” Jeans?
The ocean of apparel that Americans buy annually is the product of globe-spanning supply 
chains that consume enormous amounts of water, energy, chemicals, cotton, oil, and other 
resources while casting off equally enormous amounts of waste. Now the Sustainable 
 Apparel Coalition, which represents more than one-third of the global apparel and footwear 
industries and includes such prominent companies as Adidas, Columbia Sportswear, Levi, 
and Walmart, is building a system to measure the environmental impact of the apparel 
production process. The Coalition is attempting to measure the apparel industry’s environ-
mental footprint, including water, energy, greenhouse gas, waste, chemicals, and toxicity. 
The Coalition hopes to build a database of scores assigned to all elements of every gar-
ment’s life cycle—including cotton producers, dye suppliers, textile mill owners, shippers, 
retailers, and consumers—based on various social and environmental measures. The re-
sulting scores could be used by apparel companies to choose materials and suppliers, and 
eventually the Coalition hopes a sustainability score can be calculated for all garments so 
consumers can make buying choices with those scores in mind.
Question
Think about shopping. Assume you are considering two pairs of jeans of equal style and 
quality, one with a favorable sustainability score, one without. Assume the jeans without 
the favorable score are priced at $50. How much more would you be willing to pay for the 
jeans with a favorable score? 
 
a. Nothing more. 
 
b. $1 
 
c. $5 
 
d. $10

Toyota and the Social Responsibility Pyramid
As perhaps the most respected name in the automobile industry, Toyota’s safety strug-
gles of recent years have caused the powerful company to thoroughly review its prac-
tices and philosophies. Toyota has topped the U.S. auto industry in safety recalls in 
three of four recent years. Some 90 deaths have been associated with alleged Toyota 
problems. Toyota has agreed to pay well over $1 billion to settle claims that electronic 
malfunctions caused some of its cars to suddenly accelerate without warning. Toyota 
had previously paid nearly $50 million in fines for failing to inform regulators 
promptly about evidence of safety problems. Hundreds of personal injury and wrong-
ful death lawsuits remain to be resolved. These problems led to a decline in market 
share, resale value, and quality ratings.
 
Thus, in applying Carroll’s Social Responsibility Pyramid reasoning, we see that 
 Toyota has struggled to fulfill its economic responsibilities, and has failed to meet at 
least some of its legal responsibilities. Furthermore, in its careful and doubtless  painful 
self- examination, Toyota has raised doubts about its own ethical performance. 
 President Akio Toyoda has  acknowledged that quality had been sacrificed for faster 
growth and profits. Toyoda said, “[S]ome people just got too big-headed and focused 
too excessively on profit.” Trying to  restore its performance and ethical/reputational 
posture, Toyota has delegated more decision making a uthority to subsidiaries, 
 overhauled its quality control methods, and expanded the power of executives in

Corporations Practicing Social Responsibility
Obviously we have no shortage of social problems both domestically and globally. In 
 recent years the corporate community seems to have become increasingly convinced that it 
needs, for various reasons, to take a more active role in addressing those problems. Those 
efforts can take many forms.
• 
American corporations responded quickly to the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti by 
promising $43 million in aid within 72 hours after the quake struck.94
• 
Walt Disney Company announced in 2012 that it would be phasing out junk food ads 
on its child-focused television channels, websites, and radio stations.95
• 
McDonald’s is requiring its pork suppliers to phase out sow gestation crates (metal 
stalls so small that pigs cannot turn) in favor of more humane arrangements.96
• 
The six-story Bullitt Center in Seattle opened in 2013 as an experiment in sustain-
ability. The $30 million building—featuring composting toilets, an absence of on-
site parking, a stairway designed to allow magnificent views of Puget Sound, and 
a slow elevator that requires a key card for use—is expected to achieve both water 
and energy self- sufficiency.97
Many social responsibility advocates, including Google, believe that an entrepreneurial, 
profit-seeking, capitalist approach is the best route to correcting social problems.
Google’s Multiple CSR Strategies
Google hopes to use capitalism to make life better around the world. Google, through 
its $2 billion charitable arm, Google.org, makes many generous charitable contribu-
tions, but its version of CSR reaches beyond philanthropic efforts to attack some of the 
world’s  biggest problems (specifically, the environment, global poverty, and global 
health) by  investing in businesses, lobbying for political causes, and directing portions 
of its employees’ time to developing  business and technology solutions for those prob-
lems. Google aids nonprofits by providing Google products free or at steep discounts 
and helps with disaster relief by making storm paths, emergency numbers, and dona-
tion opportunities readily accessible. Google.org has invested $45 million in recent 
years in an array of renewable energy projects hoping to back projects with break-
throu gh potential.

Google is only one of many companies that have expanded their CSR efforts from 
 giving to building. Many of those companies view social responsibility as workable only if 
it contributes to the strategic mission of the business and ultimately to the bottom line. 
Nike, for example, turned aggressively to social responsibility measures as a way of restor-
ing its brand image after criticism for its use of global sweatshop labor. Consumers are 
willing to pay higher prices at Whole Foods Market, the healthy food grocery chain, in part 
because of the company’s reputation for good works. Goldman Sachs hopes to make 
money while doing good by investing in the nation’s first “social impact bonds,” innova-
tive financing arrangements designed to leverage private money to underwrite social pro-
grams. One Goldman Sachs bond program of up to $7 million helps finance early childhood 
education for at-risk children in Salt Lake City, and a $9.6 million investment is using be-
havioral therapy intervention in an effort to reduce recidivism among male prisoners at 
Rikers Island, New York City’s primary jail. Goldman will profit on these bond arrange-
ments only if the projects’ goals (improved educational results and reduced recidivism) are 
achieved. Savings from the performance improvements will be used to pay back Goldman 
Sac hs and other investors.98
Questions
1. In general, we understand decisions to lay off employees when companies are losing 
money, but how should we feel about profitable companies that lay off employees? 
Powerful executive, Barry Diller, in 2009, condemned “preemptive” layoffs:
The idea of a company that’s earning money, not losing money, that’s not, let’s say, 
 “industrially endangered,” to have just cutbacks [sic] so they can earn another $12 mil-
lion or $20 million or $40 million in a year where no one’s counting is really a horrible 
act when you think about it on every level.99
Do you think a socially responsible company that operates at a profit would engage in 
layoffs? Explain.
2. Some critics argue that Wall Street’s financial collapse in 2008–2009 was, at least in 
part, a product of male “group think.” They claim that men take excessive risks and 
women are more comprehensive thinkers. Hence, they say the financial community 
needs more women:
Barnard College president Deborah Spar dubbed our predicament [the Wall Street crash] a 
“one gender crash,” and The New York Times’ Nicholas Kristof wonders if we might all have 
been better off had it been “Lehman Brothers and Sisters.”100
Do finance companies have a social responsibility to hire more women? Explain.
Finding an Employer with a Conscience
Surveys of young people in recent years suggest that employers trying to replace millions of 
retiring baby boomers may need to demonstrate a social commitment in order to be fully 
competitive in the hiring market. One of those surveys found that two-thirds of respondents 
18 to 26 prefer jobs that would permit them to make a contribution to nonprofit groups.

CSR: Two Big Questions
I. Is CSR Good Business? 
The evidence is at least mildly supportive of the idea that the market rewards socially 
responsible performance by business. A 2009 meta-analysis of 251 studies found a 
“positive but small” relationship between corporate social performance and corporate 
financial performance.101 A 2012 study looked directly at the question of whether 
“high-sustainability” firms (committed to CSR) achieve better financial performance 
than otherwise comparable “low-sustainability” firms (committed to traditional profit 
seeking). The authors found that $1 invested in a high-sustainability portfolio in 1993 
would have grown to $22.60 by 2010 but to only $15.40 for a low-sustainability 
 portfolio.102 Consumers themselves have mixed sentiments about CSR with 35 percent 
of North American respondents and 46 percent of all global responders to a 2012 sur-
vey indicating they would pay extra for products and services from socially responsi-
ble companies.103
II. Do We Have a Better Alternative? Creating Shared Value
Michael Porter, highly influential professor and corporate consultant, and others have re-
cently been arguing for moving beyond CSR to a business model labeled creating shared 
value (CSV). They see creating shared value as a new form of capitalism that enhances 
economic competitiveness while simultaneously advancing social returns. They argue that 
CSR has often been treated merely as a necessary expense and a way to improve a firm’s 
reputation. According to Porter and others, moving beyond philanthropy, good citizenship, 
and sustainability to integrating social value into the creation of economic value is the 
most effective way of achieving social progress. 
 
Nestlé, for example, strives to create shared value by making nutritious, profitable prod-
ucts while protecting scarce water resources and helping coffee growers secure financing 
and improve production. Nestlé and other shared value advocates are identifying those 
opportunities where social and economic value creation align, thus enabling them to 
achieve favorable sustainability results for communities while also making money for 
shareholders. Low-cost cell phones, for example, can be profitable while serving poorer 
populations. Shared value advocates see businesses as the most powerful institutions for 
social change, but they also expect those businesses to recognize that their goal must be 
creating shared value rather than profit per se.104

Chapter Three  The Corporation and Public Policy: Expanding Responsibilities  119
Questions
1. Construct a list  of the arguments for and against social responsibility for business.
2. In a recent commentary, ethicist Chris MacDonald explained the idea that businesses 
must earn and maintain an unwritten “social license” to operate. That is, businesses must 
secure the support and goodwill of the community. MacDonald then asked what steps a 
business can take to maintain its “social license” to operate. Answer MacDonald’s 
question.
Part Three—Managing Social Responsibility
Stakeholder Approach
As the principle of social responsibility has become increasingly acceptable to the 
 corporate community, the nature of the debate has shifted to identifying new duties and 
assessing whether the corporation is meeting those duties. Many corporations, particularly 
those of great size, are confronting the practical notion of how best to manage the firm’s 
response to social issues. Corporations are increasingly considering what scholars have 
labeled the stakeholder model of social responsibility. Under that model, the corporation 
identifies all of the groups (stockholders, customers, employees, communities, govern-
ments, unions, schools, and the like) that may significantly affect the firm’s performance 
or be affected by it. These are groups with a “stake” in the activities of the corporation. Of 
course, we have wide divisions of opinion about how expansive the list of stakeholders 
should be; and once identified, we have wide divisions of opinion about the extent of the 
corporation’s duties toward those stakeholders. To stakeholder advocates, simply maxi-
mizing the interests of the primary stakeholders, that is, the shareholders, would not satisfy 
the corporation’s social duties.
 
That more expansive view of social responsibility was emphasized in a 2010 discussion 
among corporate leaders who were thinking about how to restore the public’s confidence 
in business after the financial collapse and scandals of recent years. First among the 
group’s recommendations was “A New Stakeholder Approach”:
Companies should talk less about benefits to shareholders and short-term profits and instead 
focus on customer needs, investment in workers and sustainability (from ecology to educa-
tion). We talk too much about benefits we provide to shareholders. We should be talking 
about benefits provided to our employees, customers and to the public. This will boost public 
confidence in business.105
Manage or Collaborate? Whereas many companies now acknowledge the impor-
tance of their stakeholder relationships, their dominant goal often amounts to little 
more than controlling those relationships. An alternative and arguably more “progres-
sive” approach to stakeholders involves a collaborative strategy in which stakeholder 
relationships are regarded as being mutually defined, cooperative, and reciprocal. The 
firm endeavors to understand and balance the interests and needs of all stakeholders 

120  Unit One  Business and Society
with the view that this collaborative effort results in enhanced firm performance over 
the long term while building a healthier society.
 
A. G. Lafley, two-time Procter & Gamble CEO, has thoroughly and personally em-
braced stakeholder practice. Making money remains Lafley’s first job, but he has led P&G 
on a broader mission, partly to ensure the company’s continuing success. He came to think 
of consumers as citizens who often are concerned about P&G’s approach to global warm-
ing or its animal-testing methods. Lafley, in fact, dealt directly with groups such as Green-
peace and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Lafley also extended his 
stakeholder engagement to worldwide relief efforts on behalf of P&G. Those are citizen-
ship responsibilities, he said, that go with P&G’s big role in the changing global economy 
and global political environment. “At P&G, we believe part of our responsibility is to give 
back to the communities in which we work, whether it’s the safe drinking water program 
that we’ve provided to the developing world or Pampers vaccinations for neonatal  tetanus,” 
Lafley said.106
 
As Lafley recognizes, profit now rests not merely in providing the best product or 
service at the lowest price, but in understanding and dealing with the complex inter-
play among the corporation, government, and society. Thus today’s manager is likely 
to be increasingly involved in identifying and addressing social issues and stakeholder 
concerns.
Stakeholder Results Assessing the success of social responsibility efforts is very diffi-
cult, but various measurement systems have emerged including, most prominently, Social 
Accountability 8000 (SA8000), the first global standard measuring companies’ social and 
environmental records. Social Accountability Accreditation Services in New York City 
accredits companies that meet the SA8000 standards in the areas of child labor, forced 
 labor, health and safety, freedom of association, discrimination, disciplinary practices, 
working hours, collective bargaining wages, and management systems. As of 2012, nearly 
3,200 facilities employing nearly 2 million employees in 66 countries had been certified.107

tive at www.globalreporting.org]
Bhopal: A Social Responsibility Failure?
One way of measuring the results of stakeholder activism is to review how the business 
community responds when wrongs occur. The devastating 1984 chemical spill at Bhopal, 
India, was one of the great tragedies in global industrial history. Water entered a methyl 
isocyanate storage tank at a Union Carbide plant producing an uncontrollable chemical 
reaction and a toxic cloud that spread across nearby slums. Up to 3,000 people were killed 
immediately and between 15,000 and 30,000 in total have perished. Nearly 600,000 people 
have qualified for compensation as a result of health problems attributed to the leak. Union 
Carbide reached a settlement in 1989 with the Indian government that absolved the 
 company of liability and sent over $500 million to India, including $1,500 for each death 
and $550 for each contaminated person. Claims totaled $3 billion, and litigation continues 
over a quarter of a century later. Union Carbide maintained that the gas release resulted 
from sabotage.

Chapter Three  The Corporation and Public Policy: Expanding Responsibilities  121
 
Thousands of tons of toxic waste remain in the former factory and the nearby soil, and 
apparently it continues to pollute groundwater, kill crops and cause birth defects, cancer, and 
more. Both the governmental and corporate responses have been slow and frustrating to 
local residents. Indeed, Satinath Sarangi, a metallurgist and activist, argues that the 
 fundamental problem is the close relationship between the two. The New York Times 
 explained Sarangi’s view:
Union Carbide got off easy in the 1980s because pesticides were a cornerstone 
of [India’s] “green revolution” policy to enhance agricultural productivity, 
 [Sarangi] said. A quarter of a century later, multinationals continue to wield 
enormous influence over governments that measure progress solely in economic 
terms. “If you are an ordinary person, you can’t depend on your government, 
judiciary or regulatory bodies to protect you from corporate crime.” [Sarangi] 
said.108
Nonetheless, these cataclysmic events can produce a dramatic and positive corporate 
 response as The Wall Street Journal reported about Bhopal:
The chemical leak . . . spurred a revolution in approaches to safety, pollution, 
and community relations that have made chemical plants in the United States 
more accessible and more accountable to their neighbors. New laws forced 
plants to disclose safety and pollution data. And an army of community activists 
won new powers.109 [A 2013 movie, Bhopal:  A Prayer for Rain, is inspired by the 
Bhopal chemical disaster.]

Shareholder Approach
Stakeholder theory and corporate social performance have gained great credibility 
with academics and many managers. Others, however, argue that profits and share-
holders must remain the consuming concerns of management, and that a skilled focus 
on the bottom line will, incidentally but inevitably, result in the greatest good for soci-
ety. That is, the company that maximizes its profits necessarily does not only what is 
best for its shareholders but also what is best for society generally. The shareholder/
stakeholder debate is well  illustrated by the heated competition between massive re-
tailers Walmart and Costco. Each week Walmart saves money for millions of 
 Americans by its relentless focus on the bottom line and hence on the interests of its 
shareholders. Costco, on the other hand, has drawn great praise 
from management scholars for its close attention to worker wel-
fare. Costco workers average just under $21 per hour while 
Walmart pay averages about $13 per hour for full-time 
Walmart pay averages about 
$13 per hour.

122  Unit One  Business and Society
 employees;  over half of those workers earn less than $25,000 annually.110 About 88 
percent of Costco workers have company-sponsored health insurance, whereas 
Walmart reports “more than half ” of its workers have company plans.111 Costco’s em-
ployee turnover is about 24 percent versus  about 37 percent for Walmart.112 Both com-
panies have generally been performing well in the stock market during the recent 
economic uptick, and both are showing earnings gains, although Costco’s recent sales 
growth has exceeded Walmart’s.113 Walmart has maintained a strong stock market po-
sition, in part, by relentless cost cutting, but some observers see problems in that ap-
proach. Although Walmart added 455 U.S. stores in the past five years, its total U.S. 
workforce declined by 1.4 percent, a boost in operating efficiency but one that may be 
hurting customer satisfaction. Walmart has ranked last or tied for last among depart-
ment and discount stores in the American Customer Satisfaction Index for the past six 
years.114 Nonetheless, Walmart’s tough, bottom-line, shareholder focus continues to 
generate remarkable results for the world’s largest corporation.
Critics
Walmart, the target of relentless criticism, is accused of wide-
spread sex discrimination and failure to pay legally mandated 
overtime. (Costco has faced similar problems.) Entire communi-
ties have banished  Walmart’s big boxes. Walmart is dealing with 
a bribery scandal in Mexico (see Chapter 2). In response to these 
public relations shortcomings, Walmart has initiated new sustainable, green practices 
including slashing solid waste and greenhouse-gas emissions and significantly reduc-
ing energy consumption. Those  efforts are part of a larger “good works” and public 
relations campaign that includes food donations and support for a universal health 
care policy in America. Walmart also points to its success in providing economic op-
portunities for its massive and often modestly educated workforce, 61 percent of 
whom are women and 32 percent minorities.115 Walmart’s big contribution, however, 
is in saving money for all Americans: an  estimated $30 billion per year, or the equiva-
lent of $270 per American family.116
 
Clearly, Walmart has felt harsh, market-based pressure to respond to social issues, but 
its shareholder orientation is intact and remains a strategic contrast to Costco’s stakeholder 
approach.

Questions
1. Retired Costco CEO James Sinegal says high employee pay makes for good business. 
How can that be so?
2. Professor William Beaver writes, “And what of the stakeholder model? Beyond gener-
ating some academic interest, perhaps the best that can be said is that although corpora-
tions will not be unmindful of their other stakeholders, the latter’s concerns will remain 
a distant second to those holding the share.”117 Will shareholders or other stakeholders 
dominate corporate thought in the coming years? Explain.
Walmart is accused of wide-
spread sex discrimination.

3. In 1999, Bob Thompson sold his road-building firm for $422 million. Then he divided 
$128 million among his 550 workers, more than 80 of whom became millionaires. 
Thompson explained his generosity by saying, “I wanted to go out a winner, and I 
wanted to go out doing the right thing.”118
a. Which management strategy, Walmart’s low wages or Thompson’s bonuses, is the 
more socially responsible? Explain.
b. Can Walmart, a publicly traded company owned by its shareholders, practice the 
same kind of generosity to employees that Thompson followed in distributing money 
that was literally his own? Explain.

d. Do you agree with Thompson that he did the “right thing”? Explain.
Part Four—Social Responsibility Cases 
Case One: Guns
Does the gun industry bear any portion of the blame and responsibility for Adam Lanza’s 
decision to murder 20 children and 6 adult staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary School 
in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14, 2012? Lanza, who also killed his mother and 
himself, carried into the school a Bushmaster XM15 assault rifle along with two handguns. 
Efforts to pass new federal gun control legislation have, at this writing, been unsuccessful, 
but many scholars and journalists have suggested that the firearms industry should police 
itself as a means of reducing gun violence. They argue that the industry has been negligent 
in failing to take measures that would reduce the distribution of guns to criminals. Cornell 
University  business ethics lecturer Dana Radcliffe commented on the industry’s position:
The U.S. rate of homicide by firearms is over thirty times that of Britain and Australia. Gun 
violence is a national plague. . . . However, this problem. . . is of no concern to the compa-
nies that make the weapons used in gun-related crimes. With regard to taking measures to 
keep their products out of the hands of criminals, their only responsibility is minimal compli-
ance with the law. Beyond that, they have no obligation to try to prevent their dealers and 
distributors from engaging in illegal or suspicious sales.120
When many guns used in crimes come from a particular source, law 
enforcement officials suspect possible gun trafficking. Police, 
 lawmakers, and others have pressed the firearms industry to enforce 
policies voluntarily in their distribution chain that would reduce the 
number of guns diverted into criminal use. Radcliffe argues that the 
gun industry must do so:
If the gun industry could act to reduce significantly the availability of their weapons to 
 criminals, then it is reasonable to think it should do so. The commonsense assumption that 
gun makers have a special responsibility to help combat gun violence was expressed in an 
affidavit by Robert Hass, a former Smith & Wesson executive. As he put it, “[T]he nature of 
Reduce the number of guns 
diverted into criminal use.

124  Unit One  Business and Society
the product demands that its distribution be handled in such a way as to minimize illegal and 
 unintended use.”121
Indeed, Smith & Wesson agreed in 2000 to take gun safety steps including forbidding its dis-
tributors from selling at gun shows unless background checks were conducted for all sales.122 
Smith & Wesson products were boycotted immediately, the safety plan was never enforced, 
and in 2012 Smith & Wesson was inducted into the National Rifle Association’s “Golden Ring 
of Freedom,” a group of donors who have given $1 million or more to the NRA.123 
 
Congress and President George W. Bush substantially shielded the gun industry from 
liability in 2005 through the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which immu-
nizes gun manufacturers and sellers from most civil claims (such as negligence and public 
nuisance) arising from the unlawful misuse of firearms. The gun industry argues that obey-
ing the law, which does not impose a duty to police distributors and dealers, satisfies cor-
porate responsibilities. Furthermore, they remind us that guns are 
not intrinsically evil, and those who fire guns must bear primary re-
sponsibility for the results. Expressing its frustration with new state 
gun-control legislation, gun manufacturer PTR Industries announced in 2013 that it was 
leaving Connecticut for the more gun-friendly climate of South Carolina. John McNamara, 
PTR’s vice president of sales said, “One hundred percent of our product line is illegal in 
Connecticut. They just want to collect our tax dollars on a product that they don’t think is 
safe to own.”124
Case One Questions
1. a.  What did Robert Hass mean when he said “[T]he nature of the product demands that 
its distribution be handled in such a way as to minimize illegal and unintended use”? 
b. Do you agree with Hass? Explain.
 
c.  Do gun manufacturers have a social responsibility for their products beyond the 
 demands of the market and the law? Explain.
2. Following the Newtown murders, Cerberus Capital Management, a very large invest-
ment firm, decided to seek a buyer for one of its companies, Freedom Group, which 
makes the Bushmaster rifle that was used in the school shootings. Apparently, the 
 California State Teachers’ Retirement System, which has $750 million invested with 
Cerberus, encouraged the sale. Cerberus said the sale was designed to meet its obliga-
tions to investors. Following Newtown, Dick’s Sporting Goods suspended sales of what 
it called modern sporting rifles, and Walmart reportedly removed ads from its website 
for guns similar to the one used in Newtown.
 
a.  Do those decisions appear to represent a shareholder or stakeholder approach to 
management? Explain.
 
b.  As you develop your own financial portfolio, should you decline to hold investments 
in gun companies? Explain.
3. Law professors Lucinda M. Finley and John G. Culhane, writing in The New York Times, 
recently advocated imposing a  new tax on gun manufacturers and importers.125 The tax 
would be applied to each gun sold, and the proceeds would be used to create a compensa-
tion fund for innocent gun violence victims. What do you think of that idea? Explain.
Guns are not intrinsically evil.

Social Responsibility Cases Two to Four: Wages
Case Two: Fast-Food Pay Unfair/Unconscionable?
Caroline Durocher, a fast-food server at a Taco Bell restaurant in 
Seattle, Washington, joined co-workers in walking off the job in 
late May 2013, thus shutting down the restaurant. Seattle became 
at least the seventh U.S. city facing strikes by fast-food workers. 
Durocher made $9.19 per hour and worked about 27 hours per week. She had been 
working on an associate of arts degree and had hopes of becoming a psychologist, but 
economic  difficulties forced her to leave school. Durocher explained why she went on 
strike:
My employer has pushed and pushed my co-workers and me and gotten everything they can 
out of us. This week we joined together and pushed back. I was one of the first fast-food 
workers to walk off the job . . . in Seattle, and . . . more workers are continuing to take a 
stand for a raise to $15 an hour and the right to organize without retaliation. We work in one 
of the fastest growing industries in the nation, and our companies are making huge—even 
 record—profits, but we don’t see enough of that money. We barely earn enough to pay for 
basics like rent, food and transportation to and from work. I have worked low-wage jobs 
since I was 16 years old, and now, at 21, am reluctantly sharing a studio apartment with my 
dad, working the late shift at Taco Bell.126
Seattle strikers also targeted Wendy’s, McDonald’s, Subway, and others. Chicago, New 
York City, St. Louis, and Detroit are among the other cities where fast-food workers 
went on strike, rallied, and demonstrated for $15 per hour wages and the right to organ-
ize without retaliation. The National Restaurant Association, responding to the strikes, 
said that the fast-food industry offers an entry to the American Dream and argued that 
margins are tight:
It’s important to remember that a typical restaurant operates on an average of 3–4 per-
cent pretax profit margin, and more than 90 percent of restaurants are small businesses. 
Any additional labor cost can negatively impact a restaurant’s ability to hire or maintain 
jobs.127
The U.S. Census Bureau’s poverty threshold is about $23,000 for a family of four.128 
 Fast-food workers nationally—median age 28, two-thirds of whom are women—
when working 40 hours weekly, average about $8.76 per hour ($18,000 annually), a sum 
lower than all other reported occupations.129 Big box retailers and fast-food 
chains are projected to provide 7 of 10 available jobs in the next decade as the U.S. econ-
omy is expected to continue reducing middle-class jobs while corporate wealth grows.130
Case Two Questions
1. a.  Should the socially responsible company pay low-wage, fast-food workers more 
than the market requires? Explain.
b. Is the free market the best measure of a “fair” wage for all? Explain.
Caroline Durocher joined co-
workers in walking off the job.

126  Unit One  Business and Society
2. Do you find anything morally amiss in an American economy that pays so poorly for 
hard-working, but low-skilled, fast-food labor?  Explain.
3. Should we, as consumers, blame ourselves for the low wages of  fast-food workers? 
Explain.
Case Three: Pay More Than the Law Requires?
In 2010, during very difficult economic times, the Hobby Lobby retail chain with 455 stores 
in 36 states raised its company minimum wage for full-time employees to $11 per hour, nearly 
$4 more than the $7.25 required under federal law. Why did the company raise its wages well 
beyond the law’s requirements? David Green, the CEO of the privately owned corporation, 
said, “We have always tried to be a company that serves their employ-
ees.”131 Hobby Lobby had raised its minimum wage to $10 per hour in 
2009, and the results were so positive that the company decided to 
provide another raise in 2010. Green  explained the company’s 
 reasoning:
We’re 100 percent excited about what we’ve done. We have had single mothers who were 
able to quit their second jobs. We have had employees come up and cry. The math of it said 
it would have cost us millions of dollars. But the results from the employees showed us dif-
ferently; it really didn’t cost anything because retention is important.132
Case Three Questions
1. How can it make good business sense to pay employees more than the law and the mar-
ket require?
2. Would you do as Hobby Lobby did? Explain.
Case Four: Making a Profit—Reduce Wages?
Three hundred workers at the Mott’s apple juice plant (a Dr Pepper Snapple subsidi-
ary) in Williamson, New York, waged a 16-week strike when the company demanded 
a $1.50 per hour pay cut even though Snapple had produced a $555 million profit in 
the previous year (2009)133 and increased its dividend by 67 percent in May 2010.134 
Snapple claimed the wage cut was justifiable to increase competitiveness, because the 
workers were averaging $21 per hour while other similar workers were averaging 
$14.135 The union, on the other hand, noted that the area suffers from nearly a 50 per-
cent poverty level.136 The strike ended in September 2010 with a three-year deal freez-
ing rather than reducing wages. Snapple dropped a demand to freeze pensions for 
current employees, but new hires will join a 401(k) plan instead of receiving a pen-
sion. Snapple will save money on retirement plans. Both sides reportedly considered 
the result a victory.
Case Four Questions
1. Dr Pepper Snapple argued that it had a responsibility as a public company to seek con-
cessions from its workers. Explain that argument.
2. Is it wrong in your judgment for a profitable company to seek wage concessions from 
its workers? Explain.
Hobby Lobby raised its 
 company minimum wage 
to $11 per hour.

Questions

128  Unit One  Business and Society
Chick-fil-A, a privately held company, is always closed on Sundays, has given 
millions to Christian causes, and includes the glorification of God among its cor-
porate purposes.140
a. In your view, is the operation of a privately held business on Christian principles a 
moral wrong? Explain.
b. Would you consider it to be a moral wrong if Chick-fil-A actively opposed gay and 
lesbian marriage? Explain.
c. As a business matter, how should Chick-Fil-A handle the objections to its fran-
chise’s support of the seminar?
 6. Worried about Junior misbehaving? Here’s an answer:
Call a board meeting. As crazy as it sounds, some Americans are trying to keep 
tabs on the kids by bringing business strategies into the traditional family meet-
ing. They’re hashing out everything from vacations to disputes over toys with 
techniques that seem right out of a management textbook: mission statements, 
rotating chairmanships, motivational seminars, even suggestion boxes. The most 
corporate of clans hire professional meeting facilitators, just to smooth over family 
squabbles.141
a. List some of the strengths and weaknesses of the business approach to raising 
children.
b. Do you regard the business approach in the home as a promising development or 
another encroachment of business values into life outside of work? Explain.
 7. Sam Wong, speaking during his sophomore year at Iowa State University:
Materialism, like patience, is a virtue. Ever since my parents bought me my first 
Transformer, almost everyone has tried to convince me that owning a lot of toys 
wouldn’t make me happy. Oh, how wrong they were. Toys make me very, very 
happy. That’s why today I have more of them than ever. I own every Nintendo. I 
own two CD-R burners. My drum set cost as much as a semester of school. I drive a 
Miata. What’s more, I’m not ashamed to be a consumer. I consider it part of my 
American heritage, and I’m proud of it.142
 
 Do you share Wong’s values? Explain. Is materialism in America’s best interests? 
 Explain.
 8. Knights Apparel, a privately held, Spartansburg, South Carolina, clothing company is 
the leading supplier of college logo apparel to American universities. Knights works 
closely with the Worker Rights Consortium, a group of 186 universities that lobbies 
for fair treatment for workers in the plants that produce college-logo goods. Knights 
contracts with 30 factories worldwide. One of those plants, Alta Gracia in the 
 Dominican Republic, is a Knights experiment in social responsibility. Knights is pay-
ing Alta Gracia workers a “living wage” of about $2.83 per hour while the Dominican 
minimum wage is about 85 cents per hour. The factory was remodeled, including 
 ergonomic chairs for workers and bright lighting. Unionization is permitted, and work-
ers are treated with respect. T-shirts cost about $4.80 to produce, about 20 percent 
more than if Knights paid the minimum wage. Knights sells the shirts at $8 wholesale, 
and the normal retail price is about $18. Knights will achieve a lower than usual profit 

Chapter Three  The Corporation and Public Policy: Expanding Responsibilities  129
margin on the Alta Gracia apparel.143 The big question is whether customers will pay 
as much for the Knights clothing as for premium brands like Nike that are similarly 
priced. [For the Alta Gracia home page, see http:// altagraciaapparel.com]
a. Would you forgo the Nike clothing of similar price and quality to support the Alta 
Gracia brand? Explain.
b. Do you, as a student, have a responsibility to protest if your college logo appears on 
sportswear made in low-wage sweatshops? Explain.
c. Have you ever inquired about the manufacturing source of a product you were consider-
ing, or have you declined, as a matter of principle, to buy certain garments or other 
items because you believe the manufacturer engages in unfair labor practices? Explain.
 9. Should American companies refuse to do business in countries that:
a. Do not practice democracy?
b. Routinely practice discrimination?
c. Tolerate or even encourage the abuse of children? Explain.
10. In criticizing General Motors, Ralph Nader is reported to have said,
Someday we’ll have a legal system that will criminally indict the president of 
 General Motors for these outrageous crimes. But not as long as this country is 
 populated by people who fritter away their citizenship by watching TV, playing 
bridge and Mah-Jongg, and just generally being slobs.144
a. Is the citizenry generally unconcerned about unethical corporate conduct? Explain.
b. To the extent that corporations engage in misdeeds, does the fault really lie with the 
corporate community or with society at large?
11. The forepart of this chapter discusses the very substantial power exercised by Ameri-
ca’s giant corporations. One conglomerate, Samsung, accounts for approximately one-
fifth of the South Korean economy. Samsung, well-known for electronics production, 
also builds roads, operates hotels, and sells insurance, among other activities. Critics 
say Samsung destroys smaller competitors, fixes prices, and avoids criminal punish-
ment. “You can even say the Samsung chairman is more powerful than the South 
 Korean President,” said Woo Suk-hoon, host of a popular economics podcast. “Korean 
people have come to think of Samsung as invincible and above the law.”145 Of course, 
Samsung generates hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes the world’s best-selling 
smartphone, the Galaxy.
a. If not already the case, do you envision a future in which a relatively small number 
of corporations dominate world economics? Explain. 
b. Would we be better off if that domination were to transpire? Explain.
12. Abercrombie & Fitch, the  clothing retailer, declines to offer women’s clothing in plus 
sizes and continues to direct its business toward young, good-looking customers. A & 
F received harsh, widespread criticism in early 2013 when a 2006 Salon interview 
with its CEO Michael S. Jeffries surfaced and went viral:
In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool 
kids. . . .Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American 
kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don’t belong [in our 
clothes], and they can’t belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely. . . .”146

130  Unit One  Business and Society
a. Do you think Abercrombie’s business is harmed by its “exclusionary” policies? 
 Explain.
b. Should Abercrombie’s business be hurt by its exclusionary policies? Explain.
c. Do you decline to shop at Abercrombie? Explain.
13. Michael Vick, Kobe Bryant, Tiger Woods, and other high-profile athletes have been 
entangled in very serious legal problems. Disgraced cyclist, Lance Armstrong, has 
admitted to persistent cheating. Many major league baseball players have been linked 
to steroid use. Should you refuse to watch these tarnished athletes and refuse to buy 
products they endorse? Explain.
14. Make the argument that corporations are not well-suited to be stakeholder driven, “do-
gooders” looking out for the general welfare of society.
 15. You are the sole owner of a neighborhood drugstore that stocks various brands of 
toothpaste. Assume that scientific testing has established that one brand is clearly su-
perior to all others in preventing tooth decay.
a. Would you remove from the shelves all brands except the one judged best in decay 
prevention? Explain.
b. What alternative measures could you take?
c. Should the toothpaste manufacturers be required to reveal all available data regard-
ing the effectiveness of their products? Explain.
 16. The Santa Monica, California, City Council in 2013 approved a “Sustainability Bill of 
Rights” striving for a clearer environment and asserting that corporations do not have 
special privileges under the law that supersede community rights. The ordinance also 
requires a report every two years detailing the city’s progress toward its Sustainable 
City Plan. According to councilmember Kevin McKeown, the ordinance shifts power 
away from the business community in a way that had not previously happened in the 
environmental movement. He blamed “unrestrained capitalism” for harming the envi-
ronment.147 In your view, should all communities adopt a “Sustainability Bill of 
Rights” confirming the importance of sustainability and asserting the supremacy of 
community rights over corporate authority? Explain.
17. Approximately $10 million is expended annually for alcohol ads in college newspa-
pers. Many millions more are expended in other youth-oriented publications such as 
National Lampoon and Rolling Stone. The beer industry sponsors many campus ath-
letic contests. Brewers have established promotional relationships with rock bands. 
Is beer and liquor advertising directed to the youth market unethical? Explain.
 18. U.S. corporations routinely outsource programming, customer support, data entry, and 
various back-office jobs to lower-paid workers in countries as diverse as India, Romania, 
and Ghana. Now higher-paying, increasingly sophisticated jobs are also moving abroad. 
Some countries develop technical specialties, as is the case with Sri Lanka that has an 
abundance of well-trained accountants who do work for giants such as HSBC and Aviva. 
That work sometimes involves routine bookkeeping, but it also entails sophisticated 
 derivatives pricing and risk management. In the United States, accounting salaries aver-
age just under $60,000 while $5,900 is the norm in Sri Lanka.148

Chapter Three  The Corporation and Public Policy: Expanding Responsibilities  131
a. Is outsourcing good for America? Explain.
b. Are you confident that you will be competitive in the American market of the future 
where outsourcing seems destined to strip away big pieces of the job market? 
 Explain.
 19. Former General Motors vice president John Z. DeLorean wrote in his book, On a 
Clear Day You Can See General Motors:
It seemed to me then, and still does now, that the system of American business often 
produces wrong, immoral, and irresponsible decisions, even though the personal moral-
ity of the people running the business is often above reproach. The system has a differ-
ent morality as a group than the people do as individuals, which permits it willfully to 
produce ineffective or dangerous products, deal dictatorially and often unfairly with 
suppliers, pay bribes for business, abrogate the rights of employment, or tamper with the 
democratic process of government through illegal political contributions.149
a. How can the corporate “group” possess values at odds with those of the individual 
managers?
b. Is DeLorean merely offering a convenient rationalization for corporate misdeeds? 
Explain.
c. Realistically, can one expect to preserve individual values when employed in a 
corporate group? Explain.
20. Do you agree or disagree with the following statements? Explain.
a. “Social responsibility is good business only if it is also good public relations and/or 
preempts government interference.”
b. “The social responsibility debate is the result of the attempt of liberal intellectuals 
to make a moral issue of business behavior.”
c. “‘Profit’ is really a somewhat ineffective measure of business’s social effectiveness.”
d. “The social responsibility of business is to ‘stick to business.’ ”150

Introduction
Presumably we can agree that some business behavior is bad for society. This text exam-
ines what should be done to change that behavior. In the United States, four basic options 
exist: Let the market “regulate” the behavior; leave the choice to the individual decision 
maker’s own ethical dictates; pass a law; or rely on some combination of the market, eth-
ics, and law. Market regulation was discussed in Chapter 1. Self- regulation through ethics 
was explored in Chapters 2 and 3. This chapter begins the discussion of the legal regula-
tion of business with a brief outline of the American legal system. We will also look at al-
ternative conflict resolution processes such as negotiation, mediation, and arbitration that

The Importance of Law to the Private 
Enterprise System
R E A D I N G
 
In a democracy, law is important to business for another 
reason quite separate from its function in establishing owner-
ship rights and facilitating promise keeping necessary to their 
transfer: It provides the formal expression of democratic 
 social will. That expression implicates private enterprise in a 
plethora of ways, including regulation of the environment, 
 employment laws, securities regulation, consumer protection 
statutes, and product liability. As contemporary society 
 becomes increasingly diverse, law grows, not diminishes, in 
its importance to private enterprise; and in spite of valid 
 concerns about the impact of law on efficiency, future busi-
ness managers will need to know more, not less, about how 
law affects business operations. No evidence suggests any 
other conclusion.

Question
As reported by The Wall Street Journal in 2011, a recent 
trend among the major oil companies is to shift investment 
of resources to economically developed countries. This 
strategy is reflected in Royal Dutch Shell’s 2012 Annual Re-
port, which noted Shell’s investments in countries with the 
“necessary infrastructure,” such as, among others, 
 Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Norway, Germany, 
Denmark, and the United States. What role might the law 
play in creating a favorable environment for oil companies’ 
investments?

Deb Ballam
Nobel economist Frederich von Hayek describes the theoreti-
cal importance of law to private enterprise. According to 
Hayek, law that secures property rights in modern society is a 
prerequisite to private enterprise. Without the order of law en-
forcing private property ownership and facilitating the transfer 
of property rights, business enterprise in a complex, heteroge-
neous culture is simply infeasible.
 
The importance of law to the conduct of private enterprise 
is evident in economic developments in . . . the Republic of 
China. In moving from state-controlled to private enterprise, 
[China] faced substantial difficulties arising from the lack of a 
legal system that would secure property ownership and the 
contractual transfer of property rights.
 
 . . . China’s economy has grown steadily in recent years. 
Minxin Pei, a political scientist at Princeton University, 
 explains law’s contribution to that growth: “Legal reform has 
become one of the most important institutional changes in 
China since the late 1970s. . . . Within China, the changing legal 
institutions have begun to play an increasingly important role 
in governing economic activities, resolving civil disputes, 
 enforcing law and order, and setting the boundaries between 
the power of the state and the autonomy of society. . . .”
 
Of course, the importance of law to private enterprise goes 
far beyond its initial support as an institutional framework 
guaranteeing ownership rights. As the market system grows 
more complex both nationally and internationally, the legal 
recognition of promise keeping becomes increasingly signifi-
cant in facilitating business. A condition for emerging econo-
mies entering international trade is learning how to keep 
promises to strangers, and whether enforced through litiga-
tion or arbitration, promise keeping in business requires the 
ordering presence of contract law.
do not resort to the court system. We begin by reminding ourselves of the indispensable 
role of law in supporting business practice.
Law and the Market Whatever we may think about lawyers, judges, and America’s 
 dispute resolution methods, the crucial role of a reliable legal system in fostering and 
maintaining capitalism is indisputable. The following law review excerpt explains.

142  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Part One—Legal Foundations
Objectives of the Law
Americans differ dramatically in their views of the role the law should play in contemporary 
life. For some, the courts and the police primarily act as obstructions to personal freedom and 
to a fully efficient marketplace. Others seek much more law to ensure that everyone who is in 
need is cared for and everyone is sheltered from wrongdoers. Although we may argue about 
the law’s precise path in our lives, most of us can agree on some foundational expectations for 
a fair, efficient legal system. Certainly we expect the law to maintain order in our diverse, rap-
idly changing society. Of course, we rely on law to peacefully, fairly, and intelligently  resolve 
conflict. Perhaps less obvious, but no less important, the law serves to preserve  dominant val-
ues. Americans differ about core values, but we have reached a workable accord about our most 
fundamental beliefs. Some of those, such as freedom of speech, press, and  religion, are guaran-
teed by our Bill of Rights, thus setting a steady foundation for an enduring nation. We can see 
that the law is a vital force in guaranteeing freedom. (But freedom can be confusing: Are you 
free to smoke wherever you wish, or do I have a right to smoke-free air?)
Justice
Broadly, we count on the law to achieve and preserve justice. The pursuit of justice often relies 
on honorable, efficient government. The World Justice Project’s 2013 “Rule of Law Index” 
ranks governmental quality by such measures as criminal and civil justice, order and security, 
open government, and limited corruption. Among the 97 countries studied, Sweden ranked 
particularly well. In most categories, the United States ranked in the bottom half of the 29 high-
income nations studied.1 Perhaps the study is correct in the sense that America still has abun-
dant room for improvement. Nonetheless, Americans can properly be proud of a long struggle 
to build a more just society for all. Efforts, for example, to curb discrimination, guarantee due 
process, reduce violence, protect those in need, maintain order and  security, build fair, efficient 
regulatory systems and respect the rights of all are central practices in an extraordinarily com-
plex and rapidly evolving American culture. As you read this chapter, ask yourself repeatedly, 
“Does this rule (this procedure, this case) contribute to the search for 
justice?” In the end, all legal studies must involve the search for justice.

Question
In 2010, a New York City lower court judge ruled that a four-year-old girl can be sued for 
negligence. According to The New York Times, the young girl was riding her bicycle with 
training wheels on a Manhattan sidewalk. She joined in a race against a five-year-old boy 
during which the children struck an 87-year-old woman who suffered a hip  injury requir-
ing surgery. The woman died three months later of unrelated causes. Both children were 
under the supervision of their mothers.
The girl’s attorney argued that she was too young to be responsible for negligent actions 
and that she was not engaging in an adult activity at the time of the injury. The judge cited

Cyberbullying 
In the fall of 2010, 20-year-old Rutgers University student Dharun Ravi secretly activated 
the webcam in his dorm room so that he and a friend could watch his roommate, 18-year-
old Tyler Clementi, engage in a romantic encounter with another male. Ravi used texts and 
Twitter to encourage friends to watch a second planned video that did not occur. Clementi 
subsequently committed suicide. In March 2012, Ravi was convicted of invasion of pri-
vacy and bias intimidation, among other crimes, and sentenced to 30 days in jail, 300 hours 
of community service, and  a fine of $10,000 to be paid to hate crime victims. 
 
The Tyler Clementi Higher Education Harassment Act, reintroduced in Congress in 
February 2013, would require colleges and universities receiving federal student aid fund-
ing to have and distribute a policy prohibiting harassment. Prohibited harassment would 
include cyberbullying of enrolled students by other students, faculty, and staff based on, 
among other things, actual or perceived, sexual orientation. 
Questions
1. Do you think the Tyler Clementi Higher Education Act should be enacted? Explain.
2. Co-sponsors of the bill, New Jersey senator Frank Lautenberg and New Jersey repre-
sentative Rush D. Holt, pointed to the actions and subsequent firing in 2013 of Mike 
Rice, head basketball coach at Rutgers University, as proof of the need for such antibul-
lying legislation. Rice was videotaped making slurs regarding sexual orientation to 
players and engaging in other harassing conduct. Do you agree? Explain.
3. Although he was not charged with causing Clementi’s death, Ravi was facing a possible 
10 years in state prison. Do you think Ravi’s actual sentence was fair or too light? Explain.

Primary Sources of Law
U.S. law is a vast, constantly growing, and mutating body of rules and reason. That law is 
derived from four primary sources: constitutions, statutes, regulations, and cases (called 
the common law or judge-made law).
cases dating back to 1928 in concluding that the girl could be sued. The judge noted that 
children under the age of four are conclusively presumed to be incapable of negligence, 
but he was  unwilling to extend that presumption to the girl who was three months shy of 
her fifth birthday. (The other child and his mother did not seek dismissal of the negligence 
action against them.)
As a matter of justice, do you think a four-year-old child should be the subject of a neg-
ligence action? Explain. See Alan Feuer, “4-Year-Old Can Be Sued, Judge Rules in Bike 
Case,” The New York Times, October 28, 2010 [http://www.nytimes.com/].

144  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Constitutions
These are the supreme expressions of law at both the federal and state levels of government. 
All other law is subordinate to federal constitutional law. Among other things, constitutions 
prescribe the general structure of governments and provide protection for individual rights. 
Chapters 5 and 8 give extensive attention to the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
Statutes
These are laws that are adopted by legislative bodies, particularly Congress and the state 
 legislatures. City councils enact statutes that usually are called ordinances. Legislators and the 
statutes they enact shape the policy direction of U.S. law. Of course, legislators are not free of 
constraints. Federal legislation cannot conflict with the U.S. Constitution, and state legislation 
cannot violate either federal law or the constitutions of that state and the nation.
Regulations
Administrative agencies include such bodies as the Federal Trade Commission and the 
Securities and Exchange Commission at the federal level, and a Public Service Commis-
sion (to regulate utilities) and a Human Rights Commission (to address discrimination 
problems) at the state level. These agencies have the specialized expertise to carry out 
much of the day-to-day business of government. Among other duties, they produce and 
oversee regulations that add the details needed to implement the broader mandates pro-
vided by federal and state statutes. (For more detail, see Chapter 8.)
Common Law (Also Called Case Law or Judge-Made Law)
Our case law has its roots in the early English king’s courts, where rules of law gradually 
developed out of a series of individual dispute resolutions. That body of law, the common 
law, was imported to America where it is has grown and evolved as the courts address the 
constantly changing legal requirements of our complex society.
 
The development of English common law and American judicial decisions into a just, 
ordered package is attributable in large measure to reliance on the doctrine of stare decisis 
(let the decision stand). That is, judges endeavor to follow the precedents established by 
previous decisions. Following precedent, however, is not mandatory. As societal beliefs 
and practices change, judges are called on to not only interpret precedent, but to create new 
law as cases reflecting these changes are brought. For example, a U.S. Supreme Court de-
cision approving racially separate but equal education was eventually overruled by a Su-
preme Court decision mandating integrated schools. Nonetheless, the principle of stare 
decisis is generally adhered to because of its beneficial effect. It offers the wisdom of the 
past and enhances efficiency by eliminating the need for resolving every case as though it 
were the first of its kind. Stare decisis affords stability and predictability to the law.
The Case Law: Locating and Analyzing
To prepare for the Nichols case, which follows, a bit of practical guidance should be use-
ful. The study of law is founded largely on the analysis of judicial opinions. Except for the 
federal level and a few states, trial court decisions are filed locally for public inspection 
rather than being published. Appellate (appeals court) opinions, on the other hand, are 

Chapter Four  The American Legal System  145
generally published in volumes called reports. State court opinions are found in the reports 
of that state, and in a regional reporter series published by West Publishing Company that 
divides the United States into units, such as South Eastern (S.E.) and Pacific (P.).
 
Within the appropriate reporter, the cases are cited by case name, volume, reporter 
name, and page number. For example, Nichols v. Niesen, 746 N.W.2d 220 (Wisc. S. Ct. 
2008) means that the opinion will be found in volume 746 of the North Western Reporter, 
2nd series, at page 220 and that the decision was reached in 2008 by the Wisconsin 
 Supreme Court. Federal court decisions are found in several reporters, including the Fed-
eral Reporter and the United States Supreme Court Reports. In practice, of course, those 
cases can most readily be found via a standard search engine or in online databases such as 
LexisNexis and Westlaw. [For broad databases of law topics, see http://www.findlaw.
com, http://www.yahoo.com/government/law or www.justia.com]
Briefing the Case
Most students find the preparation of case briefs (outlines or digests) to be helpful in mas-
tering the law. A brief should evolve into the form that best suits the individual student’s 
needs. The following approach should be a useful starting point:
1. Parties 
 Identify the plaintiff and the defendant at the trial level. At the appeals level, 
identify the appellant (the party bringing the appeal; Nichols, in this instance) 
and the appellee (the other party on appeal; Niesen, in this instance).
2. Facts  
Summarize only those facts critical to the outcome of the case.
3. Procedure 
How did the case reach this court? Who won in the lower court(s)?
4. Issue  
Note the central question or questions on which the case turns.
5. Holding 
How did the court resolve the issue(s)? Who won?
6. Reasoning 
Explain the logic that supported the court’s decision.
Nichols v. Niesen
746 N.W.2d 220 (Wisc. S. Ct. 2008)
issue upon review is whether a claim for common-law negli-
gence should be permitted against social hosts under these 
circumstances.
I
On June 5, 2004, the Nichols were in a motor vehicle on County 
Trunk Highway J in Columbia County, Wisconsin, when that 
 vehicle was struck by another motor vehicle, driven by Beth 
Carr (Carr), which had crossed the highway’s center line. The 
Nichols alleged that the accident was caused by Carr’s “fail-
ure to properly manage and control the vehicle she was oper-
ating, due in part to the voluntary ingestion by her of 
intoxicating beverages.” As a result of the accident, Shannon 
Justice N. Patrick Crooks
The court of appeals allowed the claim of Shannon, Lee, 
Brooke, and Brittney Nichols (the Nichols) to proceed against 
the Niesens for common-law negligence. The Nichols claimed 
that the Niesens were social hosts, who did not provide any 
alcoholic beverages to underage guests, but allegedly were 
aware that minors were on their property consuming alcoholic 
beverages. After leaving the Niesens’ premises, one of these 
guests allegedly caused injuries while driving intoxicated. The 
circuit court had granted the Niesens’ . . . motion to dismiss 
the Nichols’ complaint, after concluding that the complaint 
failed to state a claim in common-law negligence. The primary 
L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E

146  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Nichols “suffered very  severe personal injuries,” and Brittney, 
Brooke, and Lee Nichols “suffered injuries requiring medical 
care and treatment.”
 
On the night of June 4, 2004, and into the early morning of 
June 5, 2004, the Nichols alleged that “a large gathering of un-
derage high school students” congregated and consumed al-
cohol at the premises controlled by the Niesens. . . . [T]he 
Nichols alleged that “the Niesens were aware that the minors 
on their property were consuming alcohol.” The Nichols did 
not allege that the  Niesens knew, in advance, that the  students 
would be consuming alcohol. The Nichols contended that the 
Niesens “had a duty to supervise and monitor the activities on 
their property” and that they were negligent because they 
failed to do so.
 
The Nichols contended that the consumption of alcohol by 
Carr was a substantial factor in causing the accident. Defend-
ant Michael Shumate (Shumate), “or one or more adult resi-
dents of his household[,]” not the Niesens, was alleged to 
have provided the alcohol that was consumed by Carr on the 
Niesens’ property. There was no allegation that Shumate was 
at the Niesens’ property.
II (OMITTED-ED.)
III
On review, the Nichols claim that the Niesens’ conduct was 
negligent, and that it was reasonably foreseeable that some-
one drinking on the Niesens’ property would cause an 
 accident. . . .
 
[T]he Niesens argue that knowledge of someone drinking 
on one’s premises does not create a foreseeable risk of harm 
to others, and that public policy issues preclude liability in 
cases such as this one. The Niesens argue that the court of 
appeals created a new basis of liability for social hosts in 
 Wisconsin. They argue that social hosts have never been held 
liable in Wisconsin solely because they were aware that an 
underage person had been consuming alcohol. To allow the 
court of appeals’ decision to stand would mean that liability 
would apply to any social hosts who knew of underage drink-
ing, regardless of where the alcohol was possessed or con-
sumed, which would lead to liability with no sensible stopping 
point. The Niesens argue that they had limited involvement 
with the party outside of their alleged knowledge of underage 
drinking at the party, and, as a result, they should not be held 
liable. To hold social hosts liable in such circumstances would 
place an unreasonable burden on social hosts. The Niesens 
argue that a reasonable person would not foresee that knowl-
edge of some unidentified underage person drinking would 
create an unreasonable risk to others. Rather, a reasonable 
person would conclude that any such risk was created by the 
provider of the alcohol and the underage drinker. The Niesens 
contend that, because they played no role in procuring or 
 furnishing the alcohol, a negligence analysis should not be 
 applied to their actions in this matter. Finally, the Niesens 
 argue that the legislature, not the judiciary, is the branch of 
Wisconsin’s government that should impose any new liability 
on social hosts who do not provide alcoholic beverages to 
 underage guests.
 
Whether the Nichols’ complaint states a claim for com-
mon-law negligence depends on whether they sufficiently 
pled facts, which if proven true, would establish all four re-
quired elements of an actionable negligence claim. First, the 
plaintiff must establish “the existence of a duty of care on the 
part of the defendant. . . .” Second, the plaintiff must establish 
that the defendant breached that duty of care. Third, the plain-
tiff must establish “a causal connection between the defend-
ant’s breach of the duty of care and the plaintiffs injury. . . .” 
Fourth, the plaintiff must establish that he or she suffered an 
actual loss or damage that resulted from the breach.
* * * * *
 
The court of appeals framed the issue for the first element of 
the test for common-law negligence as “whether the Niesens 
owed a duty to refrain from knowingly permitting minors to 
consume alcohol on their property, thus enabling them, includ-
ing Carr, to drive away from their property while intoxicated.” 
As a result, the court held that the first factor had been met 
because “it was reasonably foreseeable that permitting un-
derage high school students to illegally drink alcohol on the 
Niesens’ property would result in harm to some person or 
something,” and because the Nichols had adequately “alleged 
the Niesens had a duty to refrain from knowingly permitting 
underage high school students from engaging in illegal alco-
hol consumption on their property.”
 
[T]he court of appeals also determined that the Nichols 
had appropriately alleged the second factor of an actionable 
common-law negligence claim, which is that the Niesens had 
breached a duty of care that they owed to the Nichols. The 
court stated, “Because the Nichols’ complaint alleges the 
Niesens knowingly permitted and failed to supervise underage 
alcohol consumption on their property, it alleges ‘a breach of 
their duty to exercise ordinary care.’” . . . 
 
The court also held that the Nichols had established the third 
factor of a common-law negligence claim by showing “a causal 
connection between the defendant’s breach of the duty of care 
and the plaintiff’s injury. . . .” That court stated, “The Nichols 
have sufficiently alleged that the Niesens’  permitting underage 
alcohol consumption on their property was a substantial factor in 
causing the automobile accident that resulted in their injuries.”

Chapter Four  The American Legal System  147
 
The fifth public policy factor upon which recovery against a 
negligent tortfeasor may be denied is when “allowing recovery 
would be too likely to open the way to fraudulent claims. . . .”
 
The sixth, and here perhaps the most significant, public pol-
icy factor upon which recovery against a negligent tortfeasor 
may be denied is when “allowing recovery would have no 
 sensible or just stopping point. . . .”
* * * * *
 
Here, the Niesens and their insurer argue that there would 
be no sensible or just stopping point if the court of appeals’ 
decision stands. They claim that the decision of the court of 
appeals would put tort law on the path of strict liability for any-
one who owns property in Wisconsin, and who knows even 
scant details of an underage person consuming alcohol on the 
property under his or her control. They argue that the next 
step, beyond such a proposed expansion in common-law neg-
ligence liability, may be to include in the framework of liability 
not just social hosts but anyone who knows that an underage 
person was drinking on property that is not even under their 
control, or to include anyone, not just property owners, who 
knows that any underage individual has had too much to drink.
 
We note that there is no allegation by the Nichols here that 
the Niesens knew Carr was intoxicated, impaired, or unable to 
safely drive a vehicle. The Niesens argue that they could not 
have foreseen that people coming onto their property, who al-
ready had broken the law before they arrived, would break the 
law again after leaving. The Niesens could not reasonably 
have foreseen that an underage guest who they were not spe-
cifically aware was intoxicated, and who arrived at the prem-
ises under their control with alcohol purchased elsewhere, 
would cause foreseeable harm to others.
 
We agree with the Niesens . . . that allowing recovery here 
would have no sensible or just stopping point.
* * * * *
 
If the Nichols’ claim were allowed to proceed, the expan-
sion of liability might also include liability for parents who al-
legedly should have known that drinking would occur on their 
property while they were absent, based on the proclivities of 
teenagers in a given area to consume alcohol. Imposing such 
liability would be only a short step away from imposing strict 
liability upon property owners for any underage drinking that 
occurs on property under their control. As Judge David G. Dei-
ninger stated in his dissent in the court of appeals, “if liability 
is permitted to extend to parents and property owners who fail 
to ‘supervise and monitor the activities on their property,’” as 
the Nichols contend of the Niesens, “then parents or other 
owners of property occupied by sixteen- to twenty-year-olds” 
 
The court of appeals further held that the Nichols had 
 appropriately alleged the fourth factor of a common-law 
 negligence claim, that they had suffered an actual loss or 
damage that resulted from the Niesens’ breach. . . .
 
For purposes of our public policy analysis, we will assume, 
without deciding, that the court of appeals was correct in holding 
that the Nichols had stated a common-law negligence claim. 
[E]ven if a plaintiff adequately establishes all four elements of a 
common-law negligence claim, Wisconsin courts have “reserved 
the right to deny the existence of a negligence claim based on 
public policy reasons. . . .“ As a result, “even if all the elements 
for a claim of negligence are proved, or liability for negligent 
conduct is assumed by the court, the court nonetheless may 
preclude  liability based on public policy  factors.” This is so 
because ‘“negligence and liability are distinct concepts.’”
 
In turning to our analysis of the public policy factors that 
bear on the Nichols’ common-law negligence claim against 
the Niesens, it is instructive to note what is not alleged by the 
Nichols. The Nichols do not allege that the Niesens  provided 
alcohol to Carr, that the Niesens were aware that Carr 
 (specifically) was consuming alcoholic beverages, that the 
 Niesens knew or should have known that Carr was intoxi-
cated, or that the Niesens knew or should have known that 
Carr was not able to drive her motor vehicle safely at the time 
of the accident We note that there also is no  allegation by the 
Nichols that the Niesens aided, agreed to assist, or attempted 
to aid Carr or any other person in the procurement or 
 consumption of alcohol on premises under their control. There 
also are no allegations that the Niesens knew in advance that 
any underage individuals would be drinking.
* * * * *
 
If one or more of the public policy “factors so dictates, the 
court may refuse to impose liability in a case.”
 
The first public policy factor upon which recovery against 
a negligent tortfeasor may be denied is when “the injury is too 
remote from the negligence. . . .”
 
The second public policy factor upon which recovery 
against a negligent tortfeasor may be denied is when “the 
 injury is too wholly out of proportion to the tortfeasor’s 
 culpability. . . .”
 
The third public policy factor upon which recovery against 
a negligent tortfeasor may be denied is when “in retrospect it 
appears too highly extraordinary that the negligence should 
have brought about the harm. . . .”
 
The fourth public policy factor upon which recovery 
against a negligent tortfeasor may be denied is when “allow-
ing recovery would place too unreasonable a burden upon the 
tortfeasor. . . .”

cart while Mr. LaMarre was trying to take his seat. LaMarre 
fell and sustained serious injuries. The LaMarres filed a law-
suit against the Plummers and the Fort Mitchell Country Club. 
Should the country club be  liable for LaMarre’s injuries? 
 Explain. See Fort Mitchell Country Club v. LaMarre, 394 S.W.3d 
89 7 (Ky. 2012).
4. Nichols, age 26, and Dobler, a minor, were guests at 
 Maldonado’s party. Dobler was served alcohol and, while 
intoxicated, repeatedly hit Nichols with a hammer. Nichols 
sued Maldanado for negligence in serving alcohol to a 
 minor. The jury found for Nichols. Maldanado appealed. 
How would you rule on that appeal? Explain. See Nichols v. 
Dobler, 655 N.W.2d 787 (Mich. Ct. App. 2002).
5. Richard Paul Dube suffered serious injuries when the 
 vehicle he was driving was struck head-on by a vehicle 
being driven in the wrong direction on a Massachusetts 
highway by Ravindra Bhoge. Bhoge had earlier in the 
evening  consumed a number of drinks with three friends at 
a bar. Bhoge and his friends met regularly on Fridays after 
work to drink at local bars. Each person took turns paying 
the bill, or on some occasions, payment would be equally 
 divided. On the night of the accident Bhoge drank enough 
that the trial judge inferred that Bhoge’s intoxication would 
have been apparent. Bhoge’s three friends said they saw 
nothing to indicate that Bhoge was  impaired, although 
Bhoge had left his coat behind in the bar on a particularly 
cold evening, and he was outside the bar for 45 minutes 
prior to his departure. Bhoge indicated to his friends that 
he was “okay” as they all prepared to leave in their 
 vehicles. Dube sued Bhoge’s three friends claiming they 
were social hosts and were negligent in permitting Bhoge 
to continue drinking. How would you rule on Dube’s claim? 
 Explain. See Dube v. Lanphear & Others, 868 N.E.2d 619 
(2007). [For the National Center for State Courts, see http://
www. ncsconline.org/]
would “be well-advised to never leave home, or if they must, 
to ensure that all underage persons go elsewhere as well. . . .” 
As a result, even assuming that the Nichols had pled a viable 
claim for common-law negligence against the Niesens using 
the four-factor test, we are satisfied that the Nichols’ claim 
should be barred on public policy considerations, since allowing 
recovery here would have no sensible or just stopping point.
* * * * *
 
Liability has never been applied to conduct like that of the 
Niesens, and liability has required active, direct and affirmative 
acts, such as the provision of alcohol. Neither the legislature nor 
this court has expanded liability to social hosts who have not 
provided alcohol to minors. The legislature is the  appropriate 
governmental branch to expand liability if it  desires to do so. As a 
result for the reasons stated herein, we reverse the court of ap-
peals, and hold that such an expansion of liability should come 
from the legislature, if it is to occur at all.

Classifications of Law
We can divide the law into some categories that will help us better understand the many 
legal domains and processes.
Substantive and Procedural Law
Substantive laws create, define, and regulate legal rights and obligations. Thus, for example, 
the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbids discrimination in employment and other matters 
(see Chapter 13).

Chapter Four  The American Legal System  149
 
Procedural law embraces the systems and methods available to enforce the rights speci-
fied in the substantive law. So procedural law includes the judicial system and the rules by 
which it operates. Questions of where to hear a case, what evidence to admit, and which 
 decisions can be appealed fall within the procedural domain. [For a “community built, freely 
available legal dictionary and encyclopedia,” see http://www.law.cornell.edu/wex]
Law and Equity
Following the Norman conquest of England in 1066, a system of king’s courts was estab-
lished in which the king’s representatives settled disputes. Those representatives were 
 empowered to provide remedies of land, money, or personal property. The king’s courts 
became known as courts of law, and the remedies were labeled remedies of law. Some liti-
gants, however, sought compensation other than the three provided. They took their pleas 
to the king.
 
Typically the chancellor, an aide to the king, would hear these petitions and, guided by the 
standard of fairness, could grant a remedy (such as an injunction or specific performance—
see the glossary of legal terms in the back of the book) specifically appropriate to the case. 
The chancellors’ decisions accumulated over time such that a new body of  remedies—and 
with it a new court system, known as courts of equity—evolved. Both court systems were 
adopted in the United States following the American Revolution, but today actions at law and 
equity are typically heard in the same court.
Public Law and Private Law
Public law deals with the relationship between government and the citizens. Constitutional, 
criminal, and administrative law (relating to such bodies as the Federal Trade Commission) 
fall in the public law category. Private law regulates the legal relationship among individu-
als. Contracts, agency, and commercial paper are traditional business law topics in the 
private category.
Civil Law and Criminal Law
The legislature or other lawmaking body normally specifies that new legislation is either 
civil or criminal or both. Broadly, all legislation not specifically labeled criminal law falls 
in the civil law category. Civil law addresses the legal rights and duties arising among 
 individuals, organizations such as corporations, and governments. Thus, for  example, a 
person might sue a company raising a civil law claim of breach of contract. Criminal law, 
on the other hand, involves wrongs against the general welfare as formulated in specific 
criminal statutes. Murder and theft are, of course, criminal wrongs  because society has 
forbidden those acts in specific legislative enactments. (For a brief discussion of business 
and white-collar crime and the federal sentencing guidelines, see Chapter 2.)
Crimes Crimes are of three kinds. In general, felonies are more serious crimes, such as 
murder, rape, and robbery. They are typically punishable by death or by imprisonment in a 
federal or state penitentiary for more than one year. In general, misdemeanors are less serious 
crimes, such as petty theft, disorderly conduct, and traffic offenses. They are  typically pun-
ishable by fine or by imprisonment for no more than one year. Treason is the special situation 
in which one levies war against the United States or gives aid and  comfort to its enemies.

150  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Elements of a Crime In a broad sense, crimes consist of two elements: (1) a wrongful act 
or omission (actus reus) and (2) evil intent (mens rea). Thus, an individual who pockets a 
pen and leaves the store without paying for it may be charged with petty theft. The accused 
may defend, however, by arguing that he or she merely absentmindedly and unintention-
ally slipped the pen in a pocket after picking it off the shelf to consider its merits. Intent is 
a state of mind, so the jury or judge must reach a determination from the objective facts as 
to what the accused’s state of mind must have been.
Criminal Procedure In general, criminal procedure following an arrest, and an initial 
appearance before a magistrate, (and in some cases a preliminary hearing) is structured as 
follows: For misdemeanor cases, prosecutors typically file what is called an information, a 
formal expression of the charges. The information may be reviewed by a magistrate before 
issuance. For felony cases, the process begins with the prosecuting officials either filing an 
information or seeking an indictment by bringing their charges before a grand jury of citi-
zens to determine whether the charges have sufficient merit to justify a trial.
 
After an indictment or information, the individual is brought before the court for ar-
raignment, where the charges are read and a plea is entered. If the individual pleads not 
guilty, he or she will go to trial, where guilt must be established beyond a reasonable 
doubt. In a criminal trial, the burden of proof is on the state. The defendant is, of course, 
presumed innocent and is entitled to a jury trial, but she or he may choose to have the case 
decided by the judge alone. If found guilty, the defendant can, among other possibilities, 
seek a new trial or appeal errors in the prosecution. If found innocent, the defendant may, 
if necessary, invoke the doctrine of double jeopardy under which a person cannot be pros-
ecuted twice in the same tribunal for the same criminal offense. [For an extensive criminal 
justice database, see https://www.ncjrs.gov/]
Miranda Warnings
The 1966 Miranda v. Arizona U.S. Supreme Court decision provided that a suspect in po-
lice custody must be told:
 
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you 
in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, 
one will be appointed for you.
 
If warnings are not properly provided, any statements made by the suspect and any 
evidence derived from those statements cannot subsequently be used in court. The warn-
ings are highly controversial, and the current Supreme Court appears to be inclined to relax 
the Miranda requirements.
 
Michigan police informed a suspect, Van Thompkins, of his Fifth Amendment rights 
against self-incrimination including the right to remain silent. Thompkins said he under-
stood, but he did not say he wanted the questioning to stop or that he wanted a lawyer. 
Rather, he sat through two hours and 45 minutes of questioning without speaking until 
an officer asked: “Do you pray to God to forgive you for shooting that boy down?” 
Thompkins said, “Yes.” He did not speak further, and he did not sign a confession. He was 
later convicted of murder, that verdict being based largely on his one-word reply. The 
U.S. 6th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the conviction, ruling that the use of the 

Chapter Four  The American Legal System  151
incriminating answer violated Thompkins’s Fifth Amendment rights, as defined and 
required by Miranda.
 
The case, Berghuis v. Thompkins, then reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 2010 where 
the Court chipped away at the Miranda requirements in a 5–4 reversal of the Court of Ap-
peals ruling. The Court said, “A suspect who has received and understood the Miranda 
warnings and has not invoked his Miranda rights waives the right to  remain silent by mak-
ing an uncoerced statement to the police.” The Court’s decision requires a criminal suspect 
to explicitly and unambiguously tell the police he or she wants to remain silent. Merely 
remaining silent had previously been treated as an  invocation of the right to remain silent, 
but the Court’s Thompkins ruling changed that practice and, in the view of critics, ill advis-
edly diminished rights previously guaranteed to defendants.
 
The Supreme Court further relaxed the Miranda requirements in two other 2010 decisions 
(Florida v. Powell and Maryland v. Shatzer), but in 2011, the Court strengthened Miranda 
protection for young people when it ruled that the police must consider the age of a suspect in 
deciding whether Miranda warnings must be issued. In J.D.B. v. North  Carolina, a 13-year-old 
Chapel Hill, North Carolina, student confessed to a pair of home break-ins  during a half hour of 
questioning by police officers and school administrators in a middle school conference room. 
The warnings were not issued and J.D.B. was not  permitted to call his grandmother, who was 
his guardian. The state, however, claimed J.D.B. was not in  custody and therefore the warnings 
were not required. In general, a suspect is considered not to have been in custody if a “reason-
able person” under the circumstances would have felt free to leave. The North Carolina courts 
ruled that J.D.B. was not in custody, but the U.S. Supreme Court held that the police must 
consider the suspect’s age when deciding if custody has been achieved such that the warnings 
are required. The case was returned to North  Carolina to determine whether J.D.B., given his 
age, was in custody during the questioning.
Questions
1. Do you think Thompkins’s response of “yes” to the police inquiry should have been 
admissible in court against him? Explain.
2. In general, do you think the Miranda warnings offer too much protection for criminal 
 suspects? Explain.

Questions—Part One
1. Jonathan Rauch argued that America is making a mistake in allowing what he calls 
 Hidden Law to be replaced by what he calls Bureaucratic Legalism. Hidden Law refers 
to unwritten social codes, whereas Bureaucratic Legalism refers to state-provided due 
process for every problem. Thus, universities formerly expected insults and epithets 
among students to be resolved via informal modes such as apologies, while today many 
universities have written codes forbidding offensive or discriminatory verbal conduct. 
Similarly, four  kindergarten students in New Jersey were suspended from school for 
three days  because they were observed “shooting” each other with their fingers serving 
as guns.
a. Should we leave campus insults and school-yard finger “shootings” to the Hidden 
Law? Explain.
b. Can you think of other examples where we have gradually replaced Hidden Law 
with Bureaucratic Legalism?
c. Rauch argued that the breakdown of one Hidden Law, the rule that a man must 
marry a woman whom he has impregnated, may be “the most far-reaching social 
change of our era.” Do you agree? Explain. See George Will, “Penalizing These 
Kids Is Zero Tolerance at a Ridiculous Extreme,” The Des Moines Register,

 neighborhood. Although the 911 operator told Zimmerman 
that he should not follow Martin, Zimmerman apparently got 
out of his car when Martin began to run. Although it was dark, 
eyewitness accounts reported seeing two men fighting and 
then seeing one of them laying on the grass, apparently shot.2 
On July 13, 2013, a jury found Zimmerman not guilty of second-
degree murder and manslaughter based on Florida’s 205 
stand-your-ground law.3 
 
Under Florida’s stand-your-ground law, those who 
“reasonably believe” that force—even deadly force—is 
necessary to protect against death or great bodily harm 
may use such force instead of retreating.4 This ex-
panded right to defend oneself now exists in more than 
30 states. As The Wall Street Journal reported in 2012, 
justifiable homicide nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, 
whereas overall U.S. homicide rates declined.5 A 2012 
study by an  economics professor and PhD student at 
Texas A&M  University concluded that stand-your-
ground laws do not deter burglary, robbery, or aggra-
vated assault.6

 including vagrancy, pornography, and gambling? Should we regulate those practices in 
any way? Explain.
3. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, as of 2013, at least 
29 states had either enacted or introduced legislation prohibiting the practice of “sex-

by minors.8
a. What objections would you raise to a criminal law forbidding sexting by minors?
b. Is this an area where the government should simply refrain from intervention? 
Explain.
4. A Rhode Island man pleaded guilty to child molestation. As an alternative to impris-
onment and as a condition of his probation, the judge ordered him to purchase a 
newspaper ad displaying his picture, identifying himself as a sex offender, and 
 encouraging others to seek assistance. One Florida judge has sentenced hundreds of 
shoplifters to carrying in public a sign that reads: “I stole from this store.” Constitu-
tional law expert Jonathan Turley says “creative sentencing” is growing, a trend he 
disapproves of and regards as a strategy for entertaining the public more than 
 deterring crime.9
a. What objections would a defendant’s lawyer raise to these public humiliation 
 punishments?
b. Would you impose a “humiliation sentence” if you were the judge? Explain.
Part Two—The Judicial Process
Most disputes are settled without resort to litigation, but when agreement cannot be 
reached, we can turn to the courts—a highly technical and sophisticated dispute resolution 
mechanism.
State Court Systems
While state court systems vary substantially, a general pattern can be summarized. As 
shown in Figure 4.1, at the base of the court pyramid in most states is a trial court of 
 general jurisdiction, commonly labeled a district court or a superior court. Most trials—
both civil and criminal—arising out of state law are heard here, but certain classes of cases 
are reserved to courts of limited subject-matter jurisdiction or to various state administra-
tive agencies (such as the state public utilities commission and the workers’ compensation 
board). Family, small claims, juvenile, and traffic courts are examples of trial courts with 
limited jurisdiction. At the top of the judicial pyramid in all states is a court of appeals, 
ordinarily labeled the supreme court. A number of states also provide for an interme-
diate court of appeals located in the hierarchy between the trial courts and the highest 
 appeals court.

District Courts
The Constitution provides for a Supreme Court and such inferior courts as Congress shall 
authorize. Pursuant to that authority, Congress has established at least one district court for 
each state and territory. The 94 district courts serve as the foundation of the federal judicial 
system. These are trial courts where witnesses are heard and questions of law and fact are 
resolved. Most federal cases begin in the district courts or in a federal administrative 
agency (such as the Federal Communications Commission). Congress has also provided 
for several courts of limited jurisdiction, including the U.S. Tax Court and the U.S. Court 
of International Trade.

Chapter Four  The American Legal System  155
Courts of Appeals
Congress has divided the United States geographically into 11 judicial circuits and the 
District of Columbia and has established a court of appeals for each. Those courts hear 
 appeals from the district courts within their circuit and review decisions and enforce orders 
of the various federal administrative agencies. In addition, the U.S. Court of Appeals for 
the Federal Circuit hears, among others, all patent appeals and all appeals from the U.S. 
Court of Federal Claims (monetary claims against the United States).
Supreme Court
The Supreme Court consists of nine justices. Those justices (along with the federal district 
and appeals court judges) are appointed for life by the president and confirmed by the Sen-
ate. Almost all of the Supreme Court’s work consists of reviewing lower court decisions, 
principally from the courts of appeal with a small number from state high courts. Virtually 
all parties seeking Supreme Court review must petition the Court for a writ of certiorari, 
which commands the lower court to forward the trial records to the Court.
 
Decisions regarding those petitions are entirely discretionary with the Court. Typically it 
will hear those cases that will assist in resolving conflicting courts of appeal decisions, as 
well as those that raise questions of special significance about the Constitution or the na-
tional welfare. Petitions to the Supreme Court in recent years typically total approximately 
8,000 cases per year. Formal, written opinions, however, are  issued in only about 70 to 
90 cases, a decline from, for example, 175 in 1986. Thus, in terms of numbers alone, the 
Court has backed away from its more activist approach of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.
Critics
Questions of “judicial activism,” the liberal/conservative balance on the Supreme Court, 
the politics of the justices, and the justices’ deference to big business interests have made 
the Court a target for criticism.   Journalist E. J. Dionne, Jr. has writ-
ten about the “Court’s Defense of the Powerful:”
The United States Supreme Court now sees its central task as comfort-
ing the already comfortable and afflicting those already afflicted.10
More specifically, the current Court is accused of being particularly friendly to 
 business interests and free market values. A 2013 scholarly study ranked the 36 jus-
tices who served on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1946 to 2011 by their pro-business 
vote rate; the five most conservative justices on the current Court were in the top 10.11 
On the other hand, several decisions in late 2010 and early 2011 supported fired work-
ers, expanded antidiscrimination law, and ruled against the Chamber of Commerce 
position in four of the five cases the Chamber addressed.12
Ideological Rulings?
We want to believe that the Supreme Court reaches its decisions in a rational, objective 
fashion relying on the commands of the Constitution and precedent to maintain a consist-
ent, fair, orderly judicial system free of political influence. A study by the Brookings Insti-
tution provided “striking evidence of a relationship between the political party of the

is “the most conservative

appointing president and judicial voting patterns.”13 Critics say that those  conservative 
ideological inclinations have led the Roberts Court to at times abandon  traditional judicial 
restraint and decide issues that were broader than required by the case before it.14
 
In 2012, Justice Scalia drew criticism for reading aloud his dissenting opinion that crit-
icized President Obama’s immigration policy; both conservative and liberal observers 
voiced concerns that Scalia’s political pronouncements undermined the integri ty of his 
opinion.15
 
Of course, public respect for the fairness and the rationality of Supreme Court decisions 
could be undermined if they come to be viewed as the product of liberal or conservative 
 political/ideological views, rather than dispassionate, lawyerly analysis. Shortly before Jus-
tice Scalia read his controversial dissenting opinion described above, a New York Times and 
CBS News poll showed that three-quarters of Americans believe the Supreme Court justices’ 
decisions may be influenced by their political views.16 Declining respect for Supreme Court 
rulings would undermine the rule of law in America and perhaps threaten democracy itself.17

Jurisdiction
A plaintiff may not simply proceed to trial at the court of his or her preference. The plain-
tiff must go to a court with jurisdiction—that is, a court with the necessary power and au-
thority to hear the dispute. The court must have jurisdiction over both the subject matter 
and the persons (or, in some instances, the property) involved in the case.
Subject-Matter Jurisdiction
Subject-matter jurisdiction imposes bounds on the classes of cases a court may hear. The 
legislation or constitution creating the court will normally specify that court’s jurisdic-
tional authority. State courts of general jurisdiction, for example, may hear most types of 
cases, but a criminal court or probate court is limited in the subject matter it may hear.
 
Whereas the outer bounds of federal jurisdiction are specified in the Constitution, Con-
gress has further particularized that issue by statute. Essentially, the federal district courts 
may hear two types of cases: (1) those involving a federal question and (2) those involving 
diversity of citizenship and more than $75,000.
 
Federal question jurisdiction exists in any suit where the plaintiff’s claim is based on the 
U.S. Constitution, a U.S. treaty, or a federal statute. Thus litigants can bring cases to the federal 
courts involving, for example, the federal antitrust statutes, federal criminal laws, constitutional 
issues such as freedom of the press, and federal tax questions. Federal question jurisdiction does 
not require an amount in controversy exceeding $75,000.  Furthermore, federal and state courts 
have concurrent jurisdiction for some federal questions. Thus, some federal question cases are 
 decided in state courts applying federal law. Federal courts can also hear cases involving state 
laws. Congress has accorded the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over certain subjects, 
 including federal criminal laws, bankruptcy, and copyrights.
 
Under diversity jurisdiction, federal district courts may hear cases involving more than 
$75,000 where the plaintiff(s) and the defendant(s) are citizens of different states. (Corpo-
rations are treated as citizens both of their state of incorporation and the state in which their 

Chapter Four  The American Legal System  157
principal place of business is located.) Diversity cases may also be heard in state courts, 
but plaintiffs frequently prefer to bring their actions in federal courts. The quality of the 
federal judiciary is generally believed to be superior to that of the states, and the federal 
courts are considered less likely to be influenced by local bias.
Personal Jurisdiction
Judicial authority over the person is known as in personam jurisdiction. In general, a state 
court’s powers are limited to the bounds of the state. Broadly, we can say that state court 
jurisdiction can be established in three ways: (1) When the defendant is a resident of the 
state, a summons may be served at that residence. (2) When the defendant is not a resident, 
a summons may be personally served should he or she be physically present in the state. 
(3) Most states have legislated “long-arm” statutes that allow a state or federal court to 
secure jurisdiction against an out-of-state party where the defendant has committed a tort 
in the state or where the defendant is conducting business in the state. Hence, in an auto 
accident in Ohio involving both an Ohio resident and a Kentucky resident, the Ohio 
 resident may sue in Ohio and use the long-arm statute to achieve service of process over 
the defendant living in Kentucky.
 
A state court may also acquire jurisdiction via an in rem action. In that instance the 
 defendant may be a nonresident, but his or her property, which must be the subject of the 
suit, must be located within the state.
 
The following case involves a dispute about the commercial use of the name of 
 celebrated actor and former California governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Arnold Schwarzenegger v. Fred 
Martin Motor Company
374 F. 3d 797 (9th Cir. 2004)
I. BACKGROUND
Schwarzenegger is a resident of California. When 
Schwarzenegger brought this suit, he was a private citizen and 
movie star, best known for his roles as a muscle-bound hero of 
action films and distinctive Austrian accent. As  explained in his 
complaint, Schwarzenegger was generally cast as the lead 
character in so-called star-driven films. One of Schwarzeneg-
ger’s most popular and readily recognizable film roles is that of 
the title character in “The Terminator” (1984). . . .
 
Fred Martin is an automobile dealership incorporated 
under the laws of Ohio and located in Barberton, Ohio, a few 
miles southwest of Akron. There is no evidence in the re-
cord that Fred Martin has any operations or employees in 
California, has ever advertised in California, or has ever sold 
Circuit Judge Fletcher
Arnold Schwarzenegger, an internationally known movie star 
and, currently, the governor of California, appeals the district 
court’s dismissal of his suit against Fred Martin Motor Com-
pany (“Fred Martin”), an Ohio car dealership, for lack of per-
sonal jurisdiction. Fred Martin had run a series of five full-page 
color advertisements in the Akron Beacon Journal, a locally 
circulated Ohio newspaper. Each advertisement included a 
small photograph of Schwarzenegger, portrayed as the “Ter-
minator,” without his permission. Schwarzenegger brought 
suit in California, alleging that these unauthorized uses of his 
image infringed his right of publicity. We affirm the district 
court’s dismissal for lack of personal jurisdiction.
L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E

158  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
a car to anyone in California. Fred Martin maintains an Inter-
net website that is available for viewing in California and, for 
that matter, from any Internet cafe in Istanbul, Bangkok, or 
anywhere else in the world.
 
In early 2002, Fred Martin engaged defendant Zimmerman 
& Partners Advertising, Inc. (“Zimmerman”) to design and 
place a full-page color advertisement in the Akron Beacon 
Journal, a local Akron-based newspaper. The advertisement 
ran in the Akron Beacon Journal five times in April 2002. Most 
of the advertisement consists of small photographs and de-
scriptions of various cars available for purchase or lease from 
Fred Martin. Just below a large-font promise that Fred Martin 
“WON’T BE BEAT,” the advertisement includes a small, but 
clearly recognizable photograph of Schwarzenegger as the 
Terminator. A “bubble quotation,” like those found in comic 
strips, is drawn next to Schwarzenegger’s mouth, reading, 
“Arnold says: ‘Terminate EARLY at Fred Martin!’” This part of 
the advertisement refers to a special offer from Fred Martin to 
customers, inviting them to close out their current leases 
 before the expected termination date, and to buy or lease a 
new car from Fred Martin.
 
Neither Fred Martin nor Zimmerman ever sought or 
 received Schwarzenegger’s permission to use his photograph 
in the advertisement. Schwarzenegger states in his complaint 
that, had such a request been made, it would have been 
 refused. The advertisement, as far as the record reveals, was 
never circulated outside of Ohio.
 
Schwarzenegger brought suit against Fred Martin and Zim-
merman in Los Angeles County Superior Court alleging six state 
law causes of action arising out of the unauthorized use of his 
image in the advertisement. He claims that the defendants 
caused him financial harm in that the use of his photograph to 
endorse Fred Martin “diminishes his hard earned reputation as 
a major motion picture star, and risks the potential for overex-
posure of his image to the public, thereby potentially diminish-
ing the compensation he would otherwise garner from his 
career as a major motion picture star.”  According to 
Schwarzenegger’s complaint, his compensation as the lead 
actor in star-driven films was based on his ability to draw 
crowds to the box office, and his ability to do so  depended in 
part on the scarcity of his image. According to his complaint, if 
Schwarzenegger’s image were to become ubiquitous—in ad-
vertisements and on television, for example—the movie-going 
public would be less likely to spend their money to see his films, 
and his compensation would diminish accordingly. Therefore, 
Schwarzenegger maintains, it is vital for him to avoid “over-
saturation of his image.” According to his complaint, he has 
steadfastly refused to endorse any products in the United 
States, despite being offered substantial sums to do so.
 
Defendants removed the action to federal district court in 
California, and Fred Martin moved to dismiss the complaint for 
lack of personal jurisdiction. The district court granted Fred 
Martin’s motion, and Schwarzenegger appealed.
II. PERSONAL JURISDICTION
For a court to exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresi-
dent defendant, that defendant must have at least “minimum 
contacts” with the relevant forum such that the exercise of 
jurisdiction “does not offend traditional notions of fair play and 
substantial justice.” International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 
U.S. 310, 316. (1945)
A. General Jurisdiction
Schwarzenegger argues, quite implausibly, that California has 
general personal jurisdiction over Fred Martin. For general ju-
risdiction to exist over a nonresident defendant such as Fred 
Martin, the defendant must engage in “continuous and sys-
tematic general business contacts,” Helicopteros Nacionales 
de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466 U.S. 408 (1984) that “approximate 
physical presence” in the forum state. Bancroft & Masters, 
223 F. 3d at 1086. This is an exacting standard, as it should be, 
because a finding of general jurisdiction permits a defendant 
to be haled into court in the forum state to answer for any of its 
activities anywhere in the world.
 
Schwarzenegger contends that Fred Martin’s contacts 
with California are so extensive that it is subject to general 
 jurisdiction. He points to the following contacts: Fred Martin 
regularly purchases Asian-made automobiles that are 
 imported by California entities. However, in purchasing these 
automobiles, Fred Martin dealt directly with representatives in 
Illinois and New Jersey, but never dealt directly with the 
 California-based importers. Some of Fred Martin’s sales con-
tracts with its automobile suppliers include a choice-of-law 
provision specifying California law. In addition, Fred Martin 
regularly retains the services of a California-based direct-mail 
marketing company; has hired a sales training company, 
 incorporated in California, for consulting services; and main-
tains an Internet website accessible by anyone capable of us-
ing the Internet, including people living in California.
 
These contacts fall well short of the “continuous and 
 systematic” contacts that the Supreme Court and this court 
have held to constitute sufficient “presence” to warrant 
 general jurisdiction. Schwarzenegger has therefore failed to 
establish a prima facie case of general jurisdiction.
B. Specific Jurisdiction
Alternatively, Schwarzenegger argues that Fred Martin has suf-
ficient “minimum contacts” with California arising from, or re-
lated to, its actions in creating and distributing the advertisement 

Chapter Four  The American Legal System  159
such that the forum may assert specific personal  jurisdiction. 
We have established a three-prong test for analyzing a claim of 
specific personal jurisdiction:
(1) The nonresident defendant must purposefully direct his 
activities or consummate some transaction with the forum 
or resident thereof; or perform some act by which he 
purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting 
activities in the forum, thereby invoking the benefits and 
protections of its laws;
(2) the claim must be one which arises out of or relates to 
the defendant’s forum-related activities; and
(3) the exercise of jurisdiction must comport with fair play 
and substantial justice, i.e., it must be reasonable.
 
The plaintiff bears the burden of satisfying the first two 
prongs of the test. If the plaintiff fails to satisfy either of these 
prongs, personal jurisdiction is not established in the forum 
state. If the plaintiff succeeds in satisfying both of the first two 
prongs, the burden then shifts to the defendant to “present a 
compelling case” that the exercise of jurisdiction would not be 
reasonable. For the reasons that follow, we hold that 
Schwarzenegger has failed to satisfy the first prong.
1. Purposeful Availment or Direction Generally
Under the first prong of our three-part specific jurisdiction test, 
Schwarzenegger must establish that Fred Martin either purpose-
fully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities in Cali-
fornia, or purposefully directed its activities toward California.
* * * * *
 
A showing that a defendant purposefully availed himself of 
the privilege of doing business in a forum state typically consists 
of evidence of the defendant’s actions in the forum, such as ex-
ecuting or performing a contract there. By taking such actions, 
a defendant “purposefully avails itself of the privilege of con-
ducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the ben-
efits and protections of its laws.” Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 
235, 253 (1958). In return for these “benefits and  protections,” a 
defendant must—as a quid pro quo—“submit to the burdens of 
litigation in that forum.” Burger King, 471 U.S. at 476.
 
A showing that a defendant purposefully directed his con-
duct toward a forum state, by contrast, usually consists of evi-
dence of the defendant’s actions outside the forum state that 
are directed at the forum, such as the distribution in the forum 
state of goods originating elsewhere.
2. Purposeful Direction
Schwarzenegger does not point to any conduct by Fred Martin 
in California related to the advertisement that would be readily 
susceptible to a purposeful availment analysis. Rather, the 
conduct of which Schwarzenegger complains—the unauthor-
ized inclusion of the photograph in the advertisement and its 
distribution in the Akron Beacon Journal—took place in Ohio, 
not California. Fred Martin received no benefit, privilege, or 
protection from California in connection with the advertise-
ment, and the traditional quid pro quo justification for finding 
purposeful availment thus does not apply. Therefore, to the 
extent that Fred Martin’s conduct might justify the exercise of 
personal jurisdiction in California, that conduct must have 
been purposefully directed at California.
* * * * *
 
Here, Fred Martin’s intentional act—the creation and pub-
lication of the advertisement—was expressly aimed at Ohio 
rather than California. The purpose of the advertisement was 
to entice Ohioans to buy or lease cars from Fred Martin and, in 
particular, to “terminate” their current car leases. The adver-
tisement was never circulated in California, and Fred Martin 
had no reason to believe that any Californians would see it and 
pay a visit to the dealership. Fred Martin certainly had no rea-
son to believe that a Californian had a current car lease with 
Fred Martin that could be “terminated” as recommended in 
the advertisement. It may be true that Fred Martin’s intentional 
act eventually caused harm to Schwarzenegger in California 
and Fred Martin may have known that Schwarzenegger lived 
in California. But this does not confer jurisdiction, for Fred 
Martin’s express aim was local. We therefore conclude that 
the advertisement was not expressly aimed at California.
CONCLUSION
We hold that Schwarzenegger has established neither general 
nor specific jurisdiction over Fred Martin in California. 
Schwarzenegger has not shown that Fred Martin has “con-
tinuous and systematic general business contacts,” Helicop-
teros, 466 U.S. at 416, that “approximate physical presence” in 
California, Bancroft & Masters, 223 F. 3d at 1086, such that it 
can be sued there for any act it has committed anywhere in 
the world. Further, while Schwarzenegger has made out a 
prima facie case that Fred Martin committed intentional acts 
that may have caused harm to Schwarzenegger in California, 
he has not made out a prima facie case that Fred Martin ex-
pressly aimed its acts at California.
 
Affirmed.

Schwarzenegger’s claim was settled out of court in 2004 when 
the Fred Martin Motor Company issued a written apology and

negotiations failed, Burger King ordered the franchisees 
to vacate the premises. They declined to do so, and con-
tinued to operate the franchise. Burger King brought suit 
in a federal district court in Florida. The defendant fran-
chisees argued that the Florida court did not have per-
sonal jurisdiction over them because they were Michigan 
residents and because the claim did not arise in Florida. 
However, the district court found the  defendants to be 
subject to the Florida long-arm statute, which extends ju-
risdiction to “[a]ny person, whether or not a citizen or 
resident of this state” who, “[b]reach[es] a  contract in this 
state by failing to perform acts required by the contract to 
be performed in this state.” The franchise contract pro-
vided for governance of the relationship by Florida law. 
Policy was set in Miami, although day-to-day supervision 
was managed through various district offices. The case 
ultimately reached the U.S. Supreme Court.

Venue
Once jurisdictional authority—that is, the power to hear the case—is established, the 
proper venue (geographic location within the court system) comes into question. Ordinar-
ily, a case will be heard by the court geographically closest to the incident or property in 
question or to where the parties reside. Sometimes one of the parties may seek a change of 
venue based on considerations such as unfavorable pretrial publicity or the pursuit of a 
more favorable legal climate. The importance of venue is evident in a 2010 decision 
 forcing Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum to defend itself in an environmental dis-
pute in California rather than in Peru where the conflict emerged. Members of the Achuar 
tribe, indigenous to the Amazon rain forest, brought a class action in 
Los Angeles against Occidental alleging the oil company dumped 
 millions of gallons of waste water into their rivers and contaminated 
their land with waste.18 A California federal district court  dismissed 
the Achuar claim, but the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of  Appeals  reversed 
the district court. The appeals court ruled, among other things, that 
Occidental had failed to demonstrate that Peru was the more convenient  forum for the 
lawsuit.19 On April 22, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Occidental’s petition for

 review.20 The Achuar plaintiffs want the case tried in California, in part,  because the Peru-
vian courts have a history of favoring corporate interests in conflicts with natives. At this 
writing, the case is expected to go forward in Los Angeles.
Standing to Sue
All who wish to bring a claim before a court will not be permitted to do so. To receive 
the court’s attention, the litigant must demonstrate standing to sue. That is, the person 
must show that her or his interest in the outcome of the controversy is sufficiently 
 direct and substantial as to justify the court’s consideration. The litigant must show 
that she or he is personally suffering, or will be suffering, injury. Mere interest in the 
problem at hand is insufficient to grant standing to sue. We all suffer injustices. We all 
have complaints in life. But have we suffered an injury to a legally protected right or 
interest? That is the  question in the Mayer case that arose out of “Spygate,” an alleged 
 National Football League cheating scandal.21

could support a right to relief under the law. Put another 
way, he did not have standing to sue. Mayer then appealed 
to the Third Circuit Federal Court of Appeals.

(I-III OMITTED-ED.)
IV
The District Court, while noting that Mayer alleged numerous 
theories of liability in this case, appropriately turned to the 
 following dispositive question: namely, whether or not he 
stated an  actionable injury (or, in other words, a legally 
 protected right or interest) arising out of the alleged “dishon-
est” videotaping program undertaken by the Patriots and the 
NFL team’s head coach.
* * * * *
FACTS
In an episode popularly known as “Spygate,” an employee 
of the New England Patriots National Football League team 
was caught videotaping New York Jets’ sideline signals, in 
violation of NFL rules, during a 2007 game with the Jets. The 
taping was later discovered to have been part of an illicit 
taping program that reportedly had been ongoing since the 
2000 season. The NFL penalized the Patriots and their 
coach, Bill Belichick. Mayer sued on behalf of himself and a 
class of Jets season ticketholders claiming the improper 
conduct  violated the contractual expectations and rights of 
the ticketholders who had paid to observe an honest 
 football game played in conformance with the rules. Mayer 
lost at trial where the federal district court ruled that he 
had failed to demonstrate an actionable injury; that is, he 
was unable to show the court that the facts he asserted 
L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E

162  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
 
Initially, we consider how tickets to sporting and other 
entertainment events have been treated in the past. New 
Jersey has generally followed a so-called “license” 
 approach#. . . .  
 
Although it did not use the specific term “license,” the 
ticket stub provided by the Patriots nevertheless appears 
consistent with this traditional approach. For example, it 
 unambiguously stated that “[t]his ticket only grants entry into 
the stadium and a spectator seat for the specified NFL 
game.” The stub further made clear that the Jets and the 
owners of the stadium retain sole discretion to refuse admis-
sion or to eject a ticket-holder. . . . Given that Mayer was 
never barred or expelled from any game at Giants Stadium, 
much more is needed to establish a cognizable right,  interest, 
or injury. . . .
 
Mayer possessed either a license or, at best, a contractual 
right to enter Giants Stadium and to have a seat from which to 
watch a professional football game. In the clear language of 
the ticket stub, “[t]his ticket only grants entry into the stadium 
and a spectator seat for the specified NFL game.” Mayer actu-
ally was allowed to enter the stadium and witnessed the 
“specified NFL game[s]” between the Jets and Patriots. He 
thereby suffered no cognizable injury to a legally protected 
right or interest.
 
Accordingly, we need not, and do not decide, whether a 
ticket-holder possesses nothing more than a license to enter 
and view whatever event, if any, happens to transpire. Here, 
Mayer undeniably saw football games played by two NFL 
teams. This therefore is not a case where, for example, the 
game or games were canceled, strike replacement players 
were used, or the professional football teams themselves did 
something nonsensical or absurd, such as deciding to play 
basketball.
* * * * *
 
Furthermore, we do recognize that Mayer alleged that he 
was the victim, not of mere poor performance by a team or 
its players, but of a team’s ongoing acts of dishonesty or 
cheating in violation of the express rules of the game. Never-
theless, there are any number of often complicated rules and 
standards applicable to a variety of sports, including 
 professional football. It appears uncontested that players of-
ten commit intentional rule infractions in order to obtain an 
#A license, for our purposes, is generally defined as “[a] permission . . . 
to commit some act that would otherwise be unlawful; esp., an 
agreement that it is lawful for the licensee to enter the licensor’s 
land to do some act that would otherwise be illegal, such as 
hunting game.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1002 (9th ed. 2009).
 advantage over the course of the game. . . . Mayer further 
does not appear to contest the fact that a team is evidently 
permitted by the rules to engage in a wide variety of arguably 
“dishonest” conduct to uncover an opponent’s signals. For 
example, a team is apparently free to take advantage of the 
knowledge that a newly hired player or coach takes with him 
after leaving his former team, and it may even have  personnel 
on the sidelines who try to pick up the opposing team’s 
 signals with the assistance of lip-reading, binoculars, note-
taking, and other devices. In  addition, even Mayer acknowl-
edged in his amended complaint that “[t]eams are allowed to 
have a limited number of their own videographers on the 
sideline during the game.”
 
In fact, the NFL’s own commissioner did ultimately take 
 action here. He found that the Patriots and Belichick were 
guilty of violating the applicable NFL rules, imposed sanctions 
in the form of fines and the loss of draft picks, and rather 
harshly characterized the whole episode as a calculated at-
tempt to avoid well-established rules designed to encourage 
fair play and honest competition. At least in this specific con-
text, it is not the role of judges and juries to be second-guessing 
the decision taken by a professional sports league purportedly 
enforcing its own rules. . . .
 
This Court refuses to countenance a course of action that 
would only further burden already limited judicial resources 
and force professional sports organizations and related indi-
viduals to expend money, time, and resources to defend 
against such litigation. . . .
 
In conclusion, this Court will affirm the dismissal of 
 Mayer’s amended complaint. Again, it bears repeating that 
our reasoning here is limited to the unusual and even 
unique circumstances presented by this appeal. We do not 
condone the conduct on the part of the Patriots and the 
team’s head coach, and we likewise refrain from assessing 
whether the NFL’s sanctions (and its alleged destruction of 
the videotapes themselves) were otherwise appropriate. 
We further recognize that professional football, like other 
professional sports, is a multi-billion dollar business. In 
turn, ticket-holders and other fans may have legitimate is-
sues with the manner in which they are treated. . . . Signifi-
cantly, our ruling also does not leave Mayer and other 
ticket-holders without any recourse. Instead, fans could 
speak out against the Patriots, their coach, and the NFL it-
self. In fact, they could even go so far as to refuse to pur-
chase tickets or NFL-related merchandise. However, the 
one thing they cannot do is bring a legal action in a court of 
law.

Class Actions
In some instances, multiple plaintiffs may join together to represent themselves and all 
others who are similarly situated to file a single lawsuit alleging similar harm arising from 
the same, or substantially the same, wrong. The high cost of litigation, the great uncer-
tainty of victory and the likelihood of small individual recoveries have made the class ac-
tion a very useful tool for plaintiffs. Of course, the class action also enhances judicial 
efficiency by bringing many claims together in one case.
 
Several recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have impacted the viability of the class ac-
tion in business disputes. For example, a small group of Walmart employees sued the 
company for sex discrimination on behalf of a nationwide class of 1.5 million female em-
ployees; Walmart challenged the class action certification. The Court held that the claims 
against Walmart did not share enough common elements to tie together the millions of 
employment decisions affecting women at Walmart. As a matter of company policy, dis-
cretion over pay and promotions rested with local managers at the 4,000 or so company 
stores; without a specific employment practice that tied all of their claims together, the 
class lacked the necessary commonality.22
 
The Supreme Court’s decision led to regional class-action suits by female Walmart 
workers; at this writing, Walmart has successfully challenged class certification in these 
cases.23 In two 2013 decisions regarding antitrust class actions, the Supreme Court under-
scored its ruling in Dukes. In Comcast v. Behrend, the Court held that class certification 
requires courts to examine carefully whether classwide damages can be proved.24 Further, 
in American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant, the Court held that a waiver of class 
arbitration was enforceable even when arbitrating a claim individually would cost far more 
than the potential recovery.25

 complaint. The complaint specifies (1) the parties to the suit, (2) evidence as to the court’s 
jurisdiction in the case, (3) a statement of the facts, and (4) a prayer for relief (a remedy).
 
The complaint is filed with the clerk of court and a summons is issued, directing the 
defendant to appear in court to answer the claims alleged against him or her. A sheriff or 
some other official attempts to personally deliver the summons to the defendant. If per-
sonal delivery cannot be achieved, the summons may be left with a responsible party at the 
defendant’s residence. Failing that, other modes of delivery are permissible, including a 
mailing. Publication of a notice in a newspaper will, in some instances, constitute good 
service of process. Ordinarily, a copy of the complaint accompanies the summons, so the 
defendant is apprised of the nature of the claim.
 
The defendant has several options. He or she may do nothing, but failure to respond 
may result in a default judgment in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant may choose to 
 respond by filing a demurrer or a motion to dismiss, the essence of which is to argue that 
even if the plaintiff’s recitation of the facts is accurate, a claim on which relief can be 
granted has not been stated.
 
Alternatively, the defendant may file with the court an initial pleading, called an  answer, 
wherein the defendant enters a denial by setting out his or her version of the facts and law, 
or in which the defendant simply concedes the validity of the plaintiff’s position. The 
answer may also contain an affirmative defense, such as the statute of limitations or the 
statute of frauds that would bar the plaintiff’s claim. The defendant’s answer might include 
a counterclaim or cross-claim. A counterclaim is the defendant’s assertion of a claim of 
action against the plaintiff. A cross-claim is the defendant’s assertion of a claim of  action 
against a codefendant. In some states, these would be labeled cross-complaints. In the 
event of a counterclaim or the assertion of new facts in the answer, the plaintiff will 
 respond with a reply. The complaint, answer, reply, and their components are the pleadings 
that serve to give notice, clarify the issues, and limit the dimensions of the litigation. [For

Chapter Four  The American Legal System  165
Motions
As necessary during and after the filing of the pleadings, either party may file motions with 
the court. For example, a party may move to clarify a pleading or to strike a portion deemed 
unnecessary. Of special importance is a motion for a judgment on the pleadings or a  motion 
for summary judgment. In a motion for a judgment on the pleadings, either party simply 
asks the judge to reach a decision based on the information in the pleadings. The judge will 
do so only if the defendant’s answer constitutes an admission of the accuracy of the plain-
tiff’s claim, or if the plaintiff’s claim clearly has no foundation in law.
 
In a motion for a summary judgment, the party filing the motion is claiming that no facts are 
in dispute. Therefore, the judge may make a ruling about the law without taking the case to trial. 
In a summary judgment hearing, the court can look beyond the pleadings to hear evidence from 
affidavits, depositions, and so on. These motions avoid the time and expense of trial.
Discovery
Discovery is the primary information-gathering stage in the pretrial process. That information 
clarifies the trial issues, promotes pretrial settlements, and helps prevent surprises at the trial, 
among other things. Discovery may consist of depositions (recorded, sworn testimony in prep-
aration for trial), physical and mental examinations, answers to written questions (interroga-
tories), requests for access to documents and property to inspect them prior to trial, and 
admissions (agreement by the parties to stipulated issues of fact or law prior to trial).
 
The era of electronic communication and storage has added important new expectations 
and burdens to the discovery process by requiring that litigants exchange all relevant elec-
tronically stored information (ESI) during the discovery phase. Individuals and companies 
must be able to produce ESI from all sources, including e-mail, files, scanned handwritten 
notes, stored records, voice mail, fax data, instant messages, spreadsheets, videos, Power-
Point presentations, and so on.
Pretrial Conference
Either party may request, and many courts require, a pretrial meeting involving the attor-
neys, the judge, and occasionally the parties. Usually following discovery, the conference

After U.S. rapper Trammar Dillard, known as Flo Rida, allegedly failed to appear at a 2011 
music festival in Newcastle, Australia, the festival organizer, Mothership Music, sued him 
in an Australian court for breach of contract. After apparent attempts to serve notice on the 
performer personally  failed, the Australian judge gave Mothership Music permission to 
serve Flo Rida by Facebook. Flo Rida appealed the ruling, and the Australian appellate 
court agreed with the defendant that he had not been properly served. The appellate court 
noted that the Facebook page used may not have actually belonged to the defendant; fur-
ther, the posting may not have come to Flo Rida’s attention.

is designed to plan the course of the trial in the interests of efficiency and justice. The 
 participants seek to define the issues and settle the dispute in advance of trial. If no settle-
ment is reached, a trial date is set.
The Judge and Jury
The federal Constitution and most state constitutions provide for the right to a jury trial in 
a civil case (excepting equity actions). Some states place dollar minimums on that guaran-
tee. At the federal level and in most states, unless one of the parties requests a jury, the 
judge alone will hear the case and decide all questions of law and fact. If the case is tried 
before a jury, that body will resolve questions of fact, but all questions of law will be re-
solved by the judge who will also instruct the jury as to the law governing the case.
 
Jurors are selected from a jury pool composed of a cross section of the community. A panel 
is drawn from that pool. The individuals in that panel are questioned by the judge, by the at-
torneys, or by all to determine if any individual is prejudiced about the case such that he or she 
could not reach an objective decision on the merits. The questioning process is called voir dire.
 
From an attorney’s point of view, jury selection is often not so much a matter of finding 
jurors without bias as it is a matter of identifying those jurors who are most likely to reach 
a decision favorable to one’s client. To that end, elaborate mechanisms and strategies have 
been employed—particularly in criminal trials—to identify desirable jurors. For example, 
sophisticated, computer-assisted surveys of the trial community have been conducted to 
develop objective evidence by which to identify jurors who would not admit to racial 
prejudice but whose “profile” suggests the likelihood of such prejudice.
 
After questioning, the attorneys may challenge for cause, arguing to the judge that the 
individual cannot exercise the necessary objectivity of judgment. Attorneys are also af-
forded a limited number of peremptory challenges, by which the attorney can have a po-
tential juror dismissed without the judge’s concurrence and without offering a reason. 
Peremptory challenges may not be used to reject jurors on the basis of race or gender.
Facebook the Jury Pool
Social media, such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter, can be a valuable source of infor-
mation to attorneys as they try to shape the composition of juries. Information that might 
not be revealed in voir dire sometimes comes to light online. Jury consultant Amber 
 Yearwood in San Francisco discovered online that a member of a jury pool was highly 
opinionated and often dispensed medical and sex advice, a personality not well suited to 
the client’s cause. The prospective juror was dismissed.

Times, February 22, 2011, p. A2.
Misleading the Jury?
The case that follows examines allegations of trial misconduct by the plaintiff’s attorney in 
an apparent effort to prejudice the jury.

and highly prejudicial comments made by plaintiff’s counsel in 
the course of this trial only served to incite the jury’s passion 
and sympathy and effectively prevented a fair and dispassion-
ate consideration of the evidence. Plaintiff’s counsel referred 
to Theising, a German national with an apparent accent, as 
someone who exhibited an “attitude of hatred” and made 
forced analogies to Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. While 
the issue of this case was sexual orientation discrimination, 
plaintiff’s counsel presented to the jury inappropriate matters 
involving African Americans, Latinos, and Jews that went far 
beyond any permissible boundaries and served no other 
 purpose than to incite the jury’s passions. Similarly, plaintiff’s 
counsel elicited testimony about an alleged physical attack by 
an assistant to Cortez on an employee dying of AIDS and 
 extensive testimony from several witnesses regarding the 
consumption of alcoholic beverages by Cortez, Hoffman, and 
Theising which was highly prejudicial with little or no proba-
tive value.
 
We find that the aggregate effect of such comments and 
conduct of plaintiff’s counsel, which cannot be characterized 
as inadvertent or harmless, inflamed the jury’s passion and 
sympathy to such an extent as to render the resulting judg-
ment meaningless. . . . 
 
The trial court erred in refusing to allow defendants to in-
troduce evidence that no other employees were treated abu-
sively . . . and in denying defendants’ requested jury charge on 
mitigation. Likewise, . . .  the trial court made a number of de-
meaning comments in the presence of the jury demonstrating 
a marked antipathy toward defense counsel which, in light of 
the totality of circumstances at trial, warrant a new trial.
 
Were this Court not to reverse and remand for a new trial 
for the reasons stated above, we would have nevertheless re-
versed on the issue of damages. The jury’s grossly excessive 
compensatory and punitive damages awards totaling approxi-
mately $20,000,000 have no rational basis. . . . [Reversed. 
 Remanded to “a different justice.”]
Questions
1. a.  Why did this appeals court reverse the decision of the 
lower court?
 
b. Why was the case remanded to “a different justice”?
2. Did this decision conclude that the plaintiff had not been a 
victim of sexual harassment, wrongful dismissal, or the 
like? Explain.
3. According to this appeals court, what errors were made by 
the judge at trial?
Judges Buckley, Rosenberger, Lerner, Rubin, 
Marlow
[P]laintiff alleges that he was verbally and physically abused 
by defendants because of his sexual orientation and then 
wrongfully discharged when he refused to voluntarily relin-
quish his position at the Supper Club.
 
The Supper Club is a dining and dancing establishment 
 operated by defendant, Edison Associates, L.P. (hereinafter 
 Edison), a limited partnership. Defendant Martin Theising is a 
partner in Edison and defendant Andre Cortez is the general 
manager of The Supper Club and is responsible for its day-to-
day operations. Defendant Oliver Hoffman was an independ-
ent consultant to The Supper Club.
 
In November 1992, plaintiff was hired as The Supper Club’s 
late night manager initially responsible for its disco and later 
for its cabaret until he was discharged in July 1995. Plaintiff 
alleges in his complaint, that during the course of his employ-
ment, he was repeatedly subjected to humiliation and to 
 discriminatory epithets regarding his sexual orientation and 
that, two weeks before he was discharged, he was physically 
held down by Hoffman and another individual while Cortez 
threatened to cut off his ponytail with a pair of scissors.
 
After a lengthy trial, the jury found that plaintiff had been 
subjected to a hostile work environment and had been 
 discharged because of his sexual orientation and that Cortez 
had committed assault and battery. The jury awarded $160,000 
in lost wages, finding that plaintiff could not have mitigated his 
damages. It further awarded $8,000,000 for past pain, suffer-
ing, and emotional distress and $2,000,000 for such future dam-
ages. The jury also awarded punitive damages of $1,000,000 
against The Supper Club, $54,000 against Cortez and $2,200,000 
against Theising with respect to the discrimination claims.
 
Defendants contend that the damages awarded were so 
grossly excessive as to be the result of passion and prejudice 
born of plaintiff’s counsel’s misconduct and judicial error, that a 
mere reduction of the awards would not be an adequate remedy.
 
“When misconduct of counsel in interrogation or summa-
tion so violates the rights of the other party to the litigation that 
extraneous matters beyond the proper scope of the trial may 
have substantially influenced or been determinative of the out-
come, such breaches of the rules will not be condoned.” 
(Kohlmann v. City of New York, 8 AD2d 598, 598.) Although 
 evidence of hostility and harassment to other minorities may 
be relevant to a claim of a hostile work environment based on 
sexual orientation, the cumulative effect of the many irrelevant

168  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
The Trial
The trial begins with opening statements by the attorneys. Each is expected to outline what 
he or she intends to prove. The plaintiff, bearing the burden of proof, then presents 
 evidence, which may include both testimony and physical evidence, such as documents 
and photos. Those are called exhibits.
 
The plaintiff’s attorney secures testimony from his or her own witnesses via ques-
tioning labeled direct examination. After the plaintiff’s attorney completes direct exam-
ination of a witness, the defense attorney may question that witness in a process labeled 
cross- examination. Redirect and recross may then follow. After all of the plaintiff’s 
 witnesses have been questioned, the plaintiff rests his or her case.
 
At this stage, the defense may make a motion for a directed verdict, arguing, in essence, 
that the plaintiff has offered insufficient evidence to justify relief, so time and expense may 
be saved by terminating the trial. Understandably, the judge considers the motion in the 
light most favorable to the plaintiff. Such motions ordinarily fail, and the trial goes forward 
with the defendant’s presentation of evidence.
 
At the completion of the defendant’s case, both parties may be permitted to offer  rebuttal 
evidence, and either party may move for a directed verdict. Barring a directed verdict, the 
case goes forward, with each party making a closing argument. When the trial is by jury, the 
judge must instruct the jurors as to the law to be applied to the case. The attorneys often sub-
mit their views of the proper instructions. In most civil cases, a verdict for the plaintiff must 
be supported by a preponderance of the evidence (more likely than not). After deliberation, 
the verdict of the jury is rendered, and a judgment is entered by the court. [For a company 
providing a virtual jury in advance of trial, see http://www.virtualjury.com]
Experts
In this highly technological and scientific era, one of the biggest dilemmas facing judges 
and juries is the weight to give to expert testimony. Very often, in cases such as medical 
malpractice and product liability (see Chapter 7), the testimony of experts is decisive to the 
outcome; but that testimony varies wildly in its reliability and credibility. The golfing case 
that follows investigates the theme of experience as a qualification for expert testimony.
Nickles v. Schild 
617 N.W.2d 659 (S. D. S. Ct. 2000)
Yankton, South Dakota, to play golf. All three boys were mi-
nors. Both Nickles and Schild had previously received golf in-
structions and had been taught some golfing rules.
 
After playing five holes, Schild and Nickles proceeded to the 
next tee box. Schild’s younger brother was still on the fifth hole 
green retrieving his ball, which Nickles had knocked a short dis-
tance from the green. Schild proceeded to tee up his ball at the 
Justice Gilbertson
Larry Nickles, the guardian of Mark Nickles, appeals the trial 
court’s admission of expert testimony.
FACTS
On May 5, 1996, Jay Schild (Schild), Mark Nickles and Schild’s 
younger brother drove to the Human Services Golf Course in 
L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E

Chapter Four  The American Legal System  169
front center of the tee box and was preparing to hit his next 
drive. In the meantime, Nickles moved off the tee box approxi-
mately 10 feet and was facing the previous green watching 
Schild’s brother. Schild, who had seen Nickles walk off the tee 
box, stepped back from his ball and took three practice swings. 
On the third practice swing, Schild hit Nickles in the head, frac-
turing his skull and permanently injuring his left eye.
 
Guardian (sic) commenced a personal injury action against 
Schild for damages sustained as a result of Schild’s negli-
gence and failure to exercise reasonable care in swinging his 
golf club. Schild denied he was negligent and claimed that 
Nickles was contributory (sic) negligent and assumed the risk 
of his injuries. During trial, Schild called Robert Boldus as an 
expert witness. Boldus was a former member of the Profes-
sional Golfer’s (sic) Association and golf professional at Fox 
Run Golf Course in Yankton, South Dakota. Boldus had often 
given golfing lessons to junior golfers while at Fox Run.
 
Schild asked Boldus whether “as a golf professional,” he 
had “formed any opinions as to what had happened in this 
case?” Nickles immediately requested permission to briefly 
interrogate Boldus for purposes of objecting to his opinion. 
During this interrogation, the following discussion occurred:
Q: (Nickles’s attorney): Mr. Boldus, as a professional golfer, 
a member of PGA or based upon your experience, have 
you had any training in evaluating liability or standards of 
care required in golf liability cases?
A: (Boldus): No, I haven’t.
Nickles then objected to the opinion by Boldus regarding stand-
ards of care or the ultimate issue. The trial judge overruled 
Nickles’s objection and allowed Boldus to give his opinion:
Q: (Schild’s attorney): And could you tell the jury what 
 opinions you have come to?
A: (Boldus): In my opinion it was an accident. But one of the 
players moved, and when you’re in your preshot routine 
if you move, you back away from the ball six inches to a 
foot or one step, and then you take your practice swings. 
My opinion, somehow Mark Nickles had moved in the 
way of the swing and got hit.
Q: (Schild’s attorney): In your opinion did [Schild] violate 
any standards of care?
A: (Boldus): No.
The jury returned a verdict in favor of Schild. Nickles  appealed, 
raising the following issue:
Whether the trial court abused its discretion by permitting 
expert testimony from Boldus.
* * * * *
DECISION
* * * * *
[A]n expert is not limited to testifying only upon those areas in 
which he or she has received formal training. Rather, when 
 giving an opinion, an expert is allowed to draw upon all the 
knowledge, skill, or experience that he or she has accumulated.
 
[W]hile Boldus may not have had any formal classroom 
“training” in the applicable liability standards, it is clear Bol-
dus was no novice at the game of golf. He was a former mem-
ber of the PGA and a golf professional at Fox Run Golf Course 
in Yankton. While at Fox Run, he had often given golf lessons 
to junior golfers, which included golf etiquette and safety. He 
had even previously given golf lessons to Nickles. By any of 
these methods of acquiring the appropriate expertise or com-
bination thereof, he could have qualified himself as an expert 
to testify as to “what happened.”
 
It is quite clear from the testimony of Boldus and his vitae 
that he did have an opinion on the standards of care required 
in golf and the expertise to give such an opinion. The following 
testimony regarding the standard of care applicable to the 
game of golf was elicited from Boldus during direct testimony:
Q: When someone has addressed the ball and stepped back 
and they’re doing their practice swings, what is the per-
son’s duty when they’re doing those practice swings?
A: Well, basically there’s nothing stated that says that you 
have to look around. You should be, when you begin your 
preshot routine, prior to taking your practice swings you 
should look and kind of [get] an idea where people are at 
so they are out of your way so you can take a swing. 
Once you begin your practice swings I think it’s a duty of 
the other person to stay out of the way.
Q: So once, right before you start your preshot routine is 
when you have the duty to check what’s going around?
A: Yes.
Q: And then as you start your preshot routine then it’s the 
duty of those around you to become aware that that’s 
what you’re going to do, to watch?
A: Yes.
* * * * *
Boldus merely described, in his opinion, “what happened in 
this case” and that Schild’s actions did not violate any stand-
ard of care concerning the game of golf. He did not invade the 
province of the jury as Nickles suggests. Boldus did not testify 
as to the ultimate issue of negligence. In fact, Boldus did not 

discuss the issue of liability at all until he was asked upon 
cross-examination, “but one party is liable, aren’t they?” Bol-
dus responded, “I wouldn’t—yah—I don’t know about  liable, 
but somebody [is responsible for that].”
 
Nickles’ objection as to the qualifications of Boldus goes in 
part to formal training concerning the issue of ultimate liability. 
The ultimate liability of one of the parties is not the same as 
standard of care. One can violate a standard of care and still not 
be held liable. There could be further potential questions of con-
tributory negligence, assumption of the risk, financial 
 responsibility of a minor and/or his parents, questions of duty to 
supervise a minor and the like, all of which can have a  decisive 
effect on liability and which clearly are outside the expertise of 
a golf pro and his knowledge of golf standards of care. Boldus 
did not testify as to any of these issues; his testimony was lim-
ited to describing the standard of care for the game of golf.
 
Affirmed.
DISSENT
Justice Sabers
I dissent.
 
I write specially to point out that the majority opinion 
misses the point—not once, but several times.
 
Whether Boldus was qualified as an expert witness is 
 immaterial. The point is that under the pretense of being an 
expert witness, Boldus cannot testify as a fact witness. He 
was not present at the scene. He does not know what 
 happened. Only fact witnesses can testify “as to what hap-
pened?” Therefore, under these circumstances it was totally 
improper for Boldus to testify to his opinion “as to what 
 happened in this case.”
Questions
1. What were Nickles’s objections to the expert, Boldus’s, 
testimony?
2. What objection was raised by the dissenting Justice Sabers?
3. Do you agree with the expert, Boldus, that once a golfer 
has properly started the preshot routine the duty of care 
shifts to those around the golfer to be aware of what is 
happening and to keep themselves out of harm’s way? 
 Explain.
4. Dodge slipped leaving work and claimed that she 
 suffered knee, ankle, and back injuries. Dodge sued the 
workplace cleaning service, but she provided no expert 
testimony to establish that the fall caused the injuries. 
Rather Dodge provided her own explanation of the fall 
and resulting injuries. Did the trial court err in admitting 
Dodge’s lay person testimony? Explain, See Dodge- 
Farrar v. American Cleaning Services Co., 54 P. 3d 954 
(Ida. Ct. App. 2002).
Post-Trial Motions
The losing party may seek a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (judgment n.o.v) on the 
grounds that the jury’s decision was clearly inconsistent with the law or the evidence. Such 
motions are rarely granted. The judge is also empowered to enter a judgment n.o.v on his 
or her own initiative.
 
Either party may also move for a new trial. The winning party might do so on the 
grounds that the remedy provided was inferior to that warranted by the evidence. The 
 losing party commonly claims an error of law to support a motion for a new trial. Other 
possible grounds for a new trial include jury misconduct or new evidence.
Appeals
After the judgment is rendered, either party may appeal the decision to a higher court. 
The winner may do so if he or she feels the remedy is inadequate. Ordinarily, of 
course, the  losing party brings the appeal. As noted, the appealing party is the appel-
lant or the petitioner, while the other party is the appellee or respondent. The appeals 
court does not try the case again. In theory, at least, its consideration is limited to 
mistakes of law at the trial level. The appellant will argue, for example, that a jury 
instruction was erroneous or that the judge erred in failing to grant a motion to strike 
170  Unit Two  Introduction to Law

Chapter Four  The American Legal System  171
testimony alleged to have been prejudicial. The appeals court does not hear new evi-
dence. Its decision is based on the trial record, materials filed by the opposing attor-
neys, and oral arguments.
 
The appellate court announces its judgment and ordinarily explains that decision in 
an accompanying document labeled an opinion. (Most of the cases in this text are ap-
pellate court opinions.) If no error is found, the lower court decision is affirmed. In 
finding prejudicial error, the appellate court may simply reverse (overrule) the lower 
court. Or the judgment may be to reverse and remand, wherein the lower court is over-
ruled and the case must be tried again in accordance with the law as articulated in the 
appeals court opinion. After the decision of the intermediate appellate court, a further 
appeal may be sought at the highest court of the jurisdiction. Most of those petitions 
are denied.
Questions—Part Two
1. What are the purposes and uses of the concept of jurisdiction? Why do we limit the 
courts to which a claim can be taken?
2. Law cases often read like soap operas even as they reveal important truths. A 
woman and man, each married to others, had engaged in a long-term love affair. 
The woman’s husband died, and she pleaded with her paramour to leave his New 
York home to visit her in Florida. She affirmed her love for the man. They made 
arrangements to meet in Miami, but on his arrival at the airport he was served a 
summons informing him that he was being sued. His Florida “lover” sought 
$500,000 for money allegedly loaned to him and for seduction inspired by a prom-
ise of marriage.
a. Does the Florida court have proper jurisdiction over him?
b. What if he had voluntarily come to Florida on vacation? See Wyman v. Newhouse, 
93 F.2d 313 (2d Cir. 1937).
3. Sea Pines, a privately owned suburban community on Hilton Head Island, South 
 Carolina, was designated a wildlife sanctuary by the state legislature. After study, the 
state Department of Natural Resources decided to issue permits to allow limited deer 
hunting on the land to reduce overpopulation. Various environmental groups challenged 
the issuance of the permits. What defense would you expect the state to offer in court? 
Explain. See Sea Pines Ass’n for Protection of Wildlife v. South Carolina Dept. of Nat-
ural Resources, 550 S.E. 2d 287 (S.C. S. Ct. 2001).
Part Three—Criticism and Alternatives
Criticism
To many Americans, our system of justice is neither systematic nor just. With more than 
1.2 million lawyers in a population of over 312 million people, critics argue that excessive, 
unproductive litigation is inevitable.

172  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Too Many Lawyers and Lawsuits?
Many lawsuits are less a search for justice and more a pursuit of big dollars for attorneys, 
the critics claim. A large law firm sued an energy industry executive for unpaid legal bills, 
resulting in a counterclaim asserting that the firm overbilled as a matter of practice. During 
discovery, e-mails between three attorneys at the firm surfaced that included such state-
ments as “That bill shall know no limits.” Even though the firm de-
scribed the e-mail exchange as “unfortunate banter” between 
colleagues, the messages may reflect a larger problem with the ap-
proaches that law firms have to billing.26 A confidential settlement 
ended the litigation.27
Legal critic Philip K. Howard argues that we need fewer lawsuits, fewer rules, and 
greater personal responsibility. He thinks we feel powerless in the face of rules:
Ordinary choices–by teachers, doctors, officials, managers, even volunteers—are paralyzed 
by legal self-consciousness. Did you check the rules? Who will be responsible if there is an 
accident? . . . We have become a culture of rule followers, trained to frame every solution in 
terms of existing law or possible legal risk. . . . 28
Even Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has argued that we have too many lawyers:
Lawyers don’t dig ditches or build buildings. When a society requires such a large number of 
its best minds to conduct the unproductive enterprise of the law, something is wrong with the 
legal system.29
 
Polling results suggest that Americans have deep reservations about our legal system, but 
they also recognize its indispensable role in maintaining a just society. A 2012 survey con-
ducted by the American Tort Reform Association, for example, shows that nine of 10 Amer-
ican voters believe lawsuit abuse is a problem,  and 60 percent believe 
that consumers and small businesses are hurt by it.30 On the other 
hand, a 2007 national poll by the American Association for Justice 
(formerly the American Trial  Lawyers Association) found more con-
cern about corporate abuse than about lawyers and the legal system.31
The Corporate Perspective
The legal system plays an invaluable role in facilitating and stabilizing commercial prac-
tice, but for corporate America the law is also a source of significant expense and abundant 
frustration. As one expert explained, dealing with legal responsibilities and problems has 
become a central ingredient in management practice:
Only a few decades ago, the law was peripheral to the core activities of doing business. When 
I became a business lawyer in the late 1950s, for example, our involvement was generally 
limited to forming a corporation or partnership for a client, providing for the investment 
 capital, doing a lease for an office or factory, and maybe handling a key contract with a CEO 
or a major supplier. . . . Today the law can affect almost every action a manager takes. It has 
moved closer to the core activities of conducting business and succeeding in a red-hot, 
 competitive environment. More people now have “rights” they can assert against your com-
pany, so you face claims from employees, consumers, competitors, and the government. 
“That bill shall know no 
limits”
Nine of 10 American voters 
 believe lawsuit abuse is a 
problem.

Chapter Four  The American Legal System  173
 Consequently, today’s manager needs to know something about employment law, discrimina-
tion claims, sexual harassment rules, product safety issues, the rules of advertising and com-
petition, antitrust rules, environmental law, the value of intellectual property, and more.32

Pants: Abusing the Legal System?
Washington, DC administrative law judge, Roy Pearson, attracted the attention of journal-
ists from around the world by suing his neighborhood laundry for $54 million, down from 
an earlier claim of $67 million, over the alleged loss of the pants belonging to his $1,000 
suit. Pearson thought he was entitled to $18,000 per day for each day the pants were missing 
over a period of nearly four years. Owners Soo and Jin Chung of Custom Cleaners  attempted 
to give Pearson a pair of pants they said were the missing item, but he said the ones offered 
were not his. Pearson brought claims of mental suffering, inconvenience, discomfort, and 
fraud (based on the “Satisfaction Guaranteed” sign at Custom Cleaners). Along the way, 
Pearson had rejected settlement offers that reached $12,000. The Chungs won an easy trial 
victory with the court concluding that Pearson was unable to prove the pants offered to him 
were not his and that the “Satisfaction Guaranteed” sign did not  require the Chungs to 
 satisfy a customer’s unreasonable demands. Pearson was ordered to pay the Chungs’ court 
costs, and the legal fees for the Chungs’ defense were covered by contributions. The 
Chung’s dry cleaner went out of business. Pearson subsequently failed in his bid to be 
 reappointed to his judge’s position. He sued for wrongful discharge and lost at the federal 
district court and then appealed to the federal court of appeals where he also lost.

Criticized in America; Embraced Abroad
The United States is not alone in its ongoing debate about whether more or fewer lawyers 
and lawsuits are needed.
Japan Historically in Japan, lawsuits have seldom been used to settle disputes, as 
 reflected in its relatively small number of attorneys. In March 2011, there was approxi-
mately one attorney for every 4,000 persons in Japan. With the rise of international 
mergers, bankruptcy, patents, and other business disputes, in 2002 Japan became con-
cerned with its lawyer shortage. Through its Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communi-
cations, Japan sought to expand the number of lawyers; with a new bar exam, the 
Japanese bar pass rates went from 2 to 3 percent to between 40 and 50 percent. A recent 

174  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
survey found that  approximately 25 percent of the Japan Bar Association was admitted 
between 2007 and 2012.33
 
In 2012, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications determined that there 
were now too many lawyers in Japan: The influx of new attorneys and the global economic 
crisis had hurt lawyers’ employment prospects. It recommended to the Ministry of Justice 
and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports and Science to reduce the number of law 
schools and law school graduates.34 
A portion of Walmart’s Ethical Standards Program demands 
employee welfare throughout its vast supply chain:
We do not own, operate, or manage any factories. 
Instead, we purchase merchandise from suppliers 
located in more than 60 countries. Our Ethical 
Standards team is dedicated to verifying that these 
supplier factories are in compliance with our 
Standards for Suppliers. These standards cover 
compliance with local and national laws and 
regulations governing compensation, hours of labor, 
forced/prison labor, underage labor, discrimination, 
freedom of association and collective bargaining, 
health and safety, environment, and the right of audit 
by Walmart Stores, Inc.35
Law professor Larry Cata Backer argues that Walmart 
and other global giants are effectively legislating their 
own private law in the form of contract and business re-
lationships and ethics standards governing product 
quality, working conditions and similar matters. 
Walmart’s Standards for Suppliers are the core of its 
global governance system that, according to Backer, is 
“an important emerging phenomenon: the development 
of efficient systems of private law making by nongov-
ernmental organizations that sometimes supplement, 
and sometimes displace traditional legal systems.”36 
Working with the media, nongovernmental organiza-
tions (NGOs), consumers, and investors, Walmart and 
other multinationals, Backer argues, are beginning to 
build independent mechanisms for efficient regulation 
of economic behavior on a global scale that may lead to 
systems of law beyond governments and moderated 
largely by stakeholders.37
Question
Should we welcome and encourage the development of a 
private law system enforced through contractual and ethi-
cal standards by giant multinationals, or should we be con-
cerned that strengthened, strictly enforced private law 
arrangements would place too much authority in the hands 
of already powerful organizations? Explain.

On the Other Hand—Litigation as a Last Resort
Almost everyone seems to be unhappy about lawyers and lawsuits, but at the same time 
Americans expect lawyers and the courts to settle disputes, preserve freedom and justice 
and correct problems not satisfactorily addressed by the market, legislatures, and regula-
tors. Feeling threatened by abusive bosses, corporate fraud, dangerous drugs, defective 
products, environmental decline, and so on, Americans count on the justice system to pro-
tect our pecuniary interests as well as the personal freedom and democracy we prize. Law-
yers and the courts often are the only available weapons to right what we believe to be a 
wrong. So the frustration many feel about exploding litigation may be attributable to us as 
much as to greedy lawyers. Furthermore, laws and lawyers are central to economic 

Chapter Four  The American Legal System  175
 efficiency. Lawyers devise the rules, processes, and structures that permit capitalism to 
operate effectively. As we have read, the balance of the world is coming to recognize that 
law and lawyers are prerequisites to economic stability and progress.
Fewer Trials A National Center for State Courts study of the state courts in 75 of the 
most populous counties revealed that from 1992 to 2005, the number of civil trials de-
creased by more than 50 percent.38 In 2005, approximately 7.4 million civil cases were 
filed in state courts; approximately 27,000 were disposed of through a jury or bench trial.39  
Trials often are an inefficient way of resolving disputes so these numbers may be considered 
very good news. On the other hand, trials are visible  affirmations of the 
indispensability of justice, and they provide the careful reasoning and 
precedents that identify impermissible behavior.
Trials often are an inefficient 
way of resolving disputes.
One of the reasons for the declining number of trials, 
 despite increasing disputes, may be difficulty in affording a 
lawyer in civil suits. The New York Times and other publi-
cations have reported an increasing number of cases 
 going forward with one of the parties serving as a “do-it-
yourself” lawyer.40 Pursuing a claim in a federal district 
court costs an average of $15,000 with more complicated 
cases involving scientific evidence often reaching 
$100,000.41 The expense of bringing lawsuits has attracted 
litigation funders, who invest in business disputes in ex-
change for a portion of the proceeds received by the party 
to whom they have given capital.42 Litigation funders assert 
that they are helping litigants seek justice from wealthier 
opponents and not supporting frivolous lawsuits, which 
would be risky investment.43 One other possible result is 
that some litigants appear to be victimized by lawsuit lend-
ers in a lightly regulated industry where interest rates “
often exceed 100 percent per year.”44
 
A 2012 San Francisco ordinance created a right to civil 
counsel, similar to what criminal defendants receive. 
Those living within 200 percent of the federal poverty line 
and who have a case regarding such key issues as hous-
ing, safety, or child custody would be eligible for free legal 
assistance.45 Although critics may view such programs as 
being best left to private legal aid organizations, support-
ers believe that by providing legal assistance to civil liti-
gants in need, the city will avoid the long-term costs 
arising from self-represented parties, such as court 
delays.46 
Question
While indigent criminal defendants are assured the right to 
counsel under American law, the same is not assured in 
civil disputes. Do you think San Francisco’s Civil Justice 
initiative should be followed throughout the United States?

Reform: Judicial Efficiency
Governments, businesses, lawyers, judges—all are frustrated with the expense and ineffi-
ciency of our overburdened judicial system. Some small businesses are now buying legal 
services insurance or prepaid legal services for a flat monthly fee.
 
Some cities have taken novel approaches to adjudication such as business courts that 
hear only commercial claims, thus allowing jurists to become very efficient in handling 
contract problems, shareholder claims, and the like. Those systems are variations on the 
small claims courts that have long proven effective in settling minor disputes.

176  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Small Claims Courts
Suppose you move out of your apartment and your landlord refuses to return your $500 
damage deposit even though the rooms are spotless. Hiring a lawyer doesn’t make good 
financial sense and is beyond your means anyway, but a small claims court may provide an 
effective solution.
 
Small claims courts, for the most part, resolve relatively minor disputes, like your 
landlord–tenant problem. A wide range of problems, such as divorce or bankruptcy, 
cannot be litigated in small claims courts. Maximum recoveries vary from place to 
place but typically range from a few thousand dollars up to $7,500 or so. To prepare 
for a small claims case, the key is developing and presenting to the judge as much 
credible evidence as possible. If you can present witnesses on your behalf, do so, but 
if not, clearly written memos expressing what the witnesses would have said may be 
acceptable to the judge. You need not hire a lawyer, but in most states you may do so 
if you wish. Should the small claims litigation not work out well for you, an appeal is 
permitted in many states.47
Honda in Small Claims Court
After rejecting a class-action settlement that would have paid Honda Civic hybrid 
owners $100 to $200 ea ch and offer some rebates on a new Honda purchase, in 2012 
Heather Peters sued Honda in small claims court and won $9,867.19 in damages after 
the judge ruled that Honda misled her into thinking her hybrid could get 50 miles per 
gallon, when its fuel economy actually dropped from approximately 42 miles per gal-
lon to 30 miles per gallon after a software update. Honda successfully appealed to the 
Los Angeles County Superior Court. Even though she lost on appeal, Peters prompted 
other customers to file lawsuits against Honda in small claims courts across the United 
States, including in New Bedford, Massachusetts; St. Louis, Missouri; and Arlington, 
Washington.

Alternative Dispute Resolution
Businesses, in particular, are increasingly looking outside the judicial system for dispute 
resolution strategies. Dot-com entrepreneurs are developing interesting new online mecha-
nisms for conveniently addressing Internet-based disputes. Networks of human mediators, 
dispute resolution software, and PayPal dispute resolution are among the online methods 
of settling problems outside of court.
 
Cybersettle is an online system for resolving insurance disputes, often of the fender-
bender or slip-and-fall variety. The parties log on to Cybersettle and type in their monetary 

Chapter Four  The American Legal System  177
demands or offers. The system works 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The  computer 
compares the bids, round by round. When those numbers come within a predetermined 
range, the two sides are notified that a settlement has been achieved. If necessary, a 
telephone facilitator may join the process to help reach the final sum to be paid. 
 Cybersettle has patented its system and says it has settled more than 200,000 transac-
tions and has  facilitated over $1.9 billion in settlements. [See http://www.cybersettle
.com/] In 2011, New York City comptroller John Liu replaced the city’s Cybersettle 
process to settle small personal injury and property damages claims with an in-house 
staff of claims adjusters as a more cost-effective alternative.48 Critics say some  Internet 
legal resources such as http://www.whocanisue.com/, a highly advertised website 
that matches potential  clients with lawyers, may degrade the legal profession and serve 
primarily to generate  litigation.49
What Is Alternative Dispute Resolution?
Of course, any form of negotiation and settlement would constitute an alternative to litiga-
tion, but mediation and arbitration are the most prominent of the substitutes. Given the 
expense, frustration, and risk of lawsuits, we are seeing increasing imagination in building 
other alternative dispute resolution (ADR) options including private trials and minitrials. 
[For many ADR links, see www.hg.org/adr.html]
Mediation
Mediation introduces a neutral third party into the resolution process. Ideally, the parties 
devise their own solution, with the mediator as a facilitator, not a decision maker. Even if 
the mediator proposes a solution, it will likely be in the nature of a compromise, not a de-
termination of right and wrong. The bottom line is that only the disputing parties can adopt 
any particular outcome. The mediator may aid the parties in a number of ways, such as 
opening up communication between them.
Arbitration
In arbitration a neutral third party is given the power to determine a binding resolution 
of the dispute. Depending on the situation, the resolution may be either a compromise 
 solution or a determination of the rights of the parties and a win–lose solution. Even in 
the latter case, however, arbitration may be quicker and less costly than a trial, and the 
arbitrator may be an expert in the subject area of the dispute instead of a generalist, as 
a judge would be. Arbitration is procedurally more formal than mediation, with the 
presentation of proofs and arguments by the parties, but less formal than court 
 adjudication.
 
The arbitrator’s decision ordinarily is legally binding and final, although an increasing 
but still small number of arbitration decisions are reaching court.50
Private Trials
A number of states now permit mutually-agreed-on private trials, sometimes labeled 
“rent-a-judge.” Normally a third party such as a mediation firm makes the necessary 
 arrangements, including hiring a retired judge and jurors. The 
proceedings are conducted much as in a courtroom. Because the 
“Rent-a-Judge”

178  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
 parties are paying, however, the process normally moves along more rapidly, and the 
 proceeding may be conducted in private. Appeals to the formal  judicial system are pro-
vided for in some states. Critics question the fairness of the private system and wonder 
if it will further erode faith in public trials, but the time and money saved can be quite 
substantial.
Mini-trials
In recent years, some corporations have agreed to settle their disputes by holding in-
formal hearings that clarify the facts and the issues that would emerge if the dispute 
were litigated. In the mini-trial, each organization presents its version of the case to a 
panel of senior  executives from each organization. The trial is presided over by a neu-
tral third party who may be expected to issue a nonbinding opinion as to the likely re-
sult were the case to be litigated. The executives then meet to attempt to negotiate a 
settlement. The neutral third party sometimes facilitates that discussion. Mini-trials 
are voluntary and nonbinding, but if an agreement is reached, the parties can formalize 
it by entering a settlement contract.
ADR Assessed
ADR mechanisms generally have been sustained in the courts. ADR—particularly 
 arbitration—is often the required dispute-resolution mechanism for employee complaints 
such as discrimination or harassment. Mandatory arbitration clauses are often included in 
consumer transactions involving loans, credit cards, cable service, auto warranties, broker-
age accounts, insurance and more. Ordinarily, ADR costs less and is resolved more quickly 
than litigation. ADR is less formal and less adversarial than the judicial process. Further-
more, the parties have more control over the proceedings in that they can choose the 
 facilitator, they can choose when and where the dispute will be heard, and they can keep 
the dispute private if they wish. Despite those strengths, alternative dispute resolution has 
some limitations when compared with litigation.
 
A recent study of nearly 4,000 employee arbitration cases found an employee win rate 
of only 21.4 percent, a lower result than in litigation. In arbitration cases won by employ-
ees, the median recovery was $36,500 and the mean was $109,858, both of which are 
substantially lower than awards reported from litigation. On the other hand, arbitration, on 
average, was both quicker and less expensive than litigation.51
A 2011 U.S. Supreme Court decision makes arbitration less functional for consum-
ers by allowing businesses to continue their commonplace practice of requiring arbi-
tration of disputes but forbidding class action arbitration (and litigation) thus 
compelling consumers to individually arbitrate alleged wrongdoing. In that case, Vincent 
and Liza Concepcion complained that AT&T Mobility charged 
them $30.22 in sales tax and other fees for what was advertised 
as a “free” phone. They sought class-action status for themselves 
and  others, but the 5–4 Supreme Court ruling denied that possi-
bility and left the Concepcions and others similarly aggrieved to file individual claims 
for very small amounts of money.52 The case that follows examines whether a manda-
tory arbitration clause in a travel agency contract to climb Mount Kilimanjaro was 
unconscionable under California law.

After her son’s death, Menefee sued GeoEx for wrongful

The trial court found the arbitration provision was uncon-
scionable and on that basis denied the motion.

This appeal timely followed.
DISCUSSION
The question . . . posed here[is] whether the agreement to 
 arbitrate is unconscionable and, therefore, unenforceable.
* * * * *
II. Unconscionability (I omitted-Ed.) 
(1) We turn first to GeoEx’s contention that the court erred 
when it found the arbitration agreement unconscionable. . . .
 
“[U]nconscionability has generally been recognized to in-
clude an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of 
the parties together with contract terms which are unreason-
ably favorable to the other party. Phrased another way, uncon-
scionability has both a ‘procedural’ and a ‘substantive’ 
element.” The procedural element requires oppression or sur-
prise. Oppression occurs where a contract involves lack of 
negotiation and meaningful choice, surprise where the alleg-
edly unconscionable provision is hidden within a prolix printed 
form. The substantive element concerns whether a contrac-
tual provision reallocates risks in an objectively unreasonable 
or unexpected manner. Under this approach, both the proce-
dural and substantive elements must be met before a contract 
or term will be deemed unconscionable. Both, however, need 
not be present to the same degree. A sliding scale is applied 
Judge Siggins
Geographic Expeditions, Inc. (GeoEx), appeals from an order 
denying its motion to compel arbitration of a wrongful death 
action brought by the survivors of one of its clients who died 
on a Mount Kilimanjaro hiking expedition. . . .
BACKGROUND
Jason Lhotka was 37 years old when he died of an altitude-re-
lated illness while on a GeoEx expedition up Mount Kilimanjaro 
with his mother, plaintiff Sandra Menefee. GeoEx’s limitation 
of liability and release form, which both Lhotka and Menefee 
signed as a requirement of participating in the expedition, pro-
vided that each of them released GeoEx from all liability in 
connection with the trek and waived any claims for liability “to 
the maximum extent permitted by law.” The release also re-
quired that the parties would submit any disputes between 
themselves first to mediation and then to binding arbitration. It 
reads: “I understand that all Trip Applications are subject to 
acceptance by GeoEx in San Francisco, California, USA. I 
agree that in the unlikely event a dispute of any kind arises 
between me and GeoEx, the following conditions will apply: (a) 
the dispute will be submitted to a neutral third-party mediator 
in San Francisco, California, with both parties splitting equally 
the cost of such mediator. If the dispute cannot be resolved 
through mediation, then (b) the dispute will be submitted for 
binding arbitration to the American Arbitration Association in 
San Francisco, California; (c) the dispute will be governed by 
California law; and (d) the maximum amount of recovery to 
which I will be entitled under any and all circumstances will 
be the sum of the land and air cost of my trip with GeoEx. I 
agree that this is a fair and reasonable limitation on the dam-
ages, of any sort whatsoever, that I may suffer. I agree to fully 
indemnify GeoEx for all of its costs (including attorneys’ fees) if 
I commence an action or claim against GeoEx based upon 
claims I have previously released or waived by signing this re-
lease.” Menefee paid $16,831 for herself and Lhotka to go on 
the trip.
 
A letter from GeoEx president James Sano that accompa-
nied the limitation of liability and release explained that the 
form was mandatory and that, on this point, “our lawyers, 
L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E

180  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
so that ‘the more substantively oppressive the contract term, 
the less evidence of procedural unconscionability is required 
to come to the conclusion that the term is unenforceable, and 
vice versa.’” . . .
A. Procedural Unconscionability
* * * * *
GeoEx led plaintiffs to understand not only that its terms and 
conditions were nonnegotiable, but that plaintiffs would en-
counter the same requirements with any other travel com-
pany. This is a sufficient basis for us to conclude plaintiffs 
lacked bargaining power.
 
GeoEx also contends its terms were not oppressive . . . 
 because Menefee and Lhotka could have simply decided not 
to trek up Mount Kilimanjaro. It argues that contracts for 
 recreational activities can never be unconscionably oppres-
sive because, unlike agreements for necessities such as med-
ical care or employment, a consumer of recreational activities 
always has the option of foregoing the activity. . . .
(2) While the nonessential nature of recreational activities 
is a factor to be taken into account in assessing whether a 
contract is oppressive, it is not necessarily the dispositive 
factor.
* * * * *
(3) Here, certainly, plaintiffs could have chosen not to sign on with 
the expedition. That option, like any availability of market alterna-
tives, is relevant to the existence, and degree, of oppression. . . .
 
But we must also consider the other circumstances sur-
rounding the execution of the agreement. . . .
 
GeoEx presented its terms as both nonnegotiable and no 
different than what plaintiffs would find with any other 
 provider Under these circumstances, plaintiffs made a suffi-
cient showing to establish at least a minimal level of oppres-
sion to justify a finding of procedural unconscionability.
B. Substantive Unconscionability
With the “sliding scale” rule firmly in mind, we address 
whether the substantive unconscionability of the GeoEx con-
tract warrants the trial court’s ruling.
 
The arbitration provision in GeoEx’s release is . . . one-
sided. . . . It guaranteed that plaintiffs could not possibly obtain 
anything approaching full recompense for their harm by limiting 
any  recovery they could obtain to the amount they paid GeoEx 
for their trip. In addition to a limit on their recovery, plaintiffs, 
 residents of Colorado, were required to mediate and arbitrate 
in San Francisco—all but guaranteeing both that GeoEx would 
never be out more than the amount plaintiffs had paid for their 
trip, and that any recovery plaintiffs might obtain would be de-
voured by the expense they incur in pursing their remedy. The 
release also required plaintiffs to indemnify GeoEx for its costs 
and attorney fees for defending any claims covered by the 
 release of liability form. Notably, there is no reciprocal limita-
tion on damages or indemnification obligations imposed on 
GeoEx. Rather than  providing a neutral forum for dispute reso-
lution, GeoEx’s arbitration scheme provides a potent disincen-
tive for an aggrieved client to pursue any claim, in any 
forum—and may well guarantee that GeoEx wins even if it 
loses. Absent reasonable justification for this arrangement—
and none is apparent—we agree with the trial court that the 
arbitration clause is so one-sided as to be substantively uncon-
scionable.

2. Differentiate procedural and substantive unconscionability.
3. Kalliope and David Valchine entered court-ordered 
 mediation to try to resolve the problems that had led 
them to seek a divorce. Lawyers represented both 
 Kalliope and David at mediation. The mediation led to a 
marital settlement agreement between Kalliope and 
 David. One month later, Kalliope sought to set aside the 
agreement, arguing that she had been coerced by her 
husband, her husband’s attorney, and the mediator. 
 Kalliope testified that the mediator threatened to report 
her to the judge for being uncooperative in refusing to 
sign a reasonable settlement offer. She claimed that the 
mediator also told her that she could sign the agree-
ment and then object to its provisions at the final hear-
ing. See Kalliope Vitakis-Valchine v. David L. Valchine,

Should the settlement be set aside? Explain.
4. Is an arbitration clause as a condition of employment a fair 
method of alternate dispute resolution, if entered know-
ingly and voluntarily? Explain.
5. In an effort to reduce legal expenses, some major banks

what may the number of exonerations recorded in the National Registry of Exon-
erations compared to the U.S. prison population show about the U.S. criminal jus-
tice system? Explain.
b. Trends of the National Registry of Exonerations show both an increase in the num-
ber of those exonerated who had pleaded guilty, as well as an increase in the inves-
tigations  by law enforcement into possible false convictions. What conclusions 
might be drawn from these trends? Explain.
 3. Crowley, who became intoxicated at a postrace party on McRoberts’s boat, was  driving 
after the party and caused a multicar accident that resulted in serious injuries to Culver, 
who was driving one of the other vehicles. Culver’s passenger was killed, and Crowley 
was later convicted of reckless homicide. Culver sued McRoberts for negligence. 
Crowley’s drinking took place in the galley of McRoberts’s 40-foot boat. McRoberts 
did not provide the liquor and McRoberts, who was busy with recording race results, 
was not aware of how much drinking Crowley had done. The Indiana Dram Shop stat-
ute provided that “it is unlawful for a person to sell, barter, deliver, or give away an al-
coholic beverage to another person who is in a state of intoxication if the person knows 
that the other person is intoxicated.” Expert testimony and a blood alcohol reading 
suggested that Crowley may have been visibly drunk, but several  witnesses on the boat 
said they did not observe visible signs of intoxication. Did McRoberts violate the 
 Indiana Dram Shop law, and was McRoberts negligent in  failing to properly supervise 
Crowley? Explain. See Culver v. McRoberts, 192 F.3d 1095 (7th Cir. 1999).
 4. Dubuque, Iowa’s City Council and mayor in 2011 enacted a parental responsibility 
ordinance providing that: “A failure by a parent to exercise reasonable control over the 
parent’s minor which causes the minor to commit an unlawful act is a  violation . . .”

182  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
The ordinance is directed to derelict parents whose negligence or indifference facili-
tates criminal behavior by children and leads to big investments of police time in 
 simply locating parents. A violation initially results in a warning with increasing fines 
(or parenting classes) for violations thereafter. The city’s plan is to provide resources 
to aid parents who are in violation of the ordinance. The city has indicated that 
 “reasonable control” means doing what the average person would do.57
a. What objections would you raise to this ordinance?
b. Do you think a parent would violate the reasonable control standard if his or her  
child failed to come home from the movies by the hour agreed on, but the parent 
then made an effort to find the child? Explain.
c. Is the ordinance a good idea in your judgment? Explain.
 5. In 2013, Megan Thode, a former graduate student, sought $1.3 million in damages 
from Lehigh University for receiving a C+ in a class in which a B or above was needed 
to enroll in the next required course toward her goal of becoming a licensed profes-
sional counselor. Thode’s complaint was based on claims of breach of contract and 
sexual discrimination. The trial judge ruled for the defendant, Lehigh University.58
a. If you were the trial judge, what information would you expect to be presented at 
trial? Explain.
b. What could be the impact of Thode’s lawsuit on student–professor relations and 
grading in college? Explain.
 6. The California Medical Injury Compensation Reform Act (MICRA) of 1975 capped non-
economic damages such as pain and suffering at $250,000; as of this writing, the cap has 
never been adjusted for inflation. Such award caps have been criticized as limiting those 
injured from seeking legal redress, as most attorneys representing plaintiffs in medical 
malpractice actions work on contingency. Further, plaintiffs with permanent injuries will 
be able to collect no more for their pain and suffering than those who will recover fully.59
 
  
As of this writing, a campaign is underway in California to raise the MICRA cap to 
meet inflation, along with other measures to increase patient safety.60

What are the advantages and disadvantages of limiting damages in medical mal-
practice suits? Explain.
 7. In your opinion are attractive criminal defendants likely to receive more favorable 
treatment in the courts than similarly situated but less attractive defendants? 
 Explain.
 8. According to Warren Avis, founder of Avis Rent-a-Car,
We’ve reached a point in this country where, in many instances, power has become 
more important than justice—not a matter of who is right, but of who has the most 
money, time, and the largest battery of lawyers to drag a case through the courts.61
a. Should the rich be entitled to better legal representation, just as they have access to 
better food, better medical care, better education, and so on? Explain.
b. Should we employ a nationwide legal services program sufficient to guarantee 
competent legal aid to all? Explain.

 9. Peremptory challenges may not constitutionally be used to exclude a potential juror 
from a trial on racial or gender grounds.
a. Must a criminal jury reflect the ethnic or racial diversity of the community? 
 Explain. See Powers v. Ohio, 111 S. Ct. 1364 (1991).
b. Could potential jurors lawfully be rejected on the basis of their place of residence? 
Explain. See U.S. v. Bishop, 959 F.2d 820 (9th Cir. 1992).
 10. French journalist Alain Clement offered a partial explanation for Americans’ increas-
ing reliance on lawsuits to resolve conflicts:
Diverse causes explain the growth of the contentious mood in America. One could be 
called the devaluing of the future. In 1911, the Russian political scientist Moise 
 Ostrgorski wrote, “Confident of the future, Americans manifest a remarkable endurance 
to an unhappy present, a submissive patience that is willing to bargain about not only 
civic rights, but even the rights of man.”62
a. What does Clement mean?
b. How do you explain our increased reliance on litigation?
 11. In 1982, a security guard was murdered during a robbery of a south Chicago 
 McDonald’s. Alton Logan was sentenced to life in prison for that murder. At the same 
time, two Chicago public defenders, Dale Coventry and Jamie Kunz, were represent-
ing Andrew Wilson, who was accused of murdering two police officers. Based on a 
tip, Coventry and Kunz suspected that Wilson was the actual murderer in the McDonald’s 
case. They questioned Wilson who admitted that he, not Logan, was the murderer. 
Because of their duties under the attorney–client privilege, Coventry and Kunz felt 
they could not reveal what they knew. Logan, therefore, went to prison an innocent 
man, they believed. The public defenders decided to write the story in a notarized 
 affidavit and lock it in a box in case something should happen that would allow them 
to reveal what they knew. When Wilson died in prison of natural causes in 2008, 
 Coventry and Kunz revealed their client’s confession. After 26 years, Logan was 
 released from prison. He was granted a certificate of innocence; in 2013, the city of 
Chicago agreed to pay Logan $10.25 million.63
a. Why does the legal profession expect lawyers to keep secret their clients’ confiden-
tial communications?
b. Had you been Coventry and Kunz, would you have revealed what you knew in or-
der to immediately secure justice for Logan? Explain.
 12. On July 5, 1884, four sailors were cast away from their ship in a storm 1,600 miles from 
the Cape of Good Hope. Their lifeboat contained neither water nor much food. On the 20th 
day of their ordeal, Dudley and Stevens, without the assistance or agreement of Brooks, cut 
the throat of the fourth sailor, a 17- or 18-year-old boy. They had not eaten since day 12. 
Water had been available only occasionally. At the time of the death, the men were prob-
ably about 1,000 miles from land. Prior to his death, the boy was lying helplessly in the 
bottom of the boat. The three surviving sailors ate the boy’s remains for four days, at which 
point they were rescued by a passing boat. They were in a seriously weakened condition.
a. Were Dudley and Stevens guilty of murder? Explain.
b. Should Brooks have been charged with a crime for eating the boy’s flesh? Explain. 
See The Queen v. Dudley and Stephens, 14 Queen’s Bench Division 273 (1884).

184  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
 13. Tompkins was a citizen of Pennsylvania. While walking on a railroad footpath in that 
state, he was struck by an object protruding from a passing freight train owned by the 
Erie Railroad Company, a New York corporation. Tompkins, by virtue of diversity of 
citizenship, filed a negligence suit against Erie in a New York federal court. Erie ar-
gued for the application of Pennsylvania common law, in which case Tompkins would 
have been treated as a trespasser. Tompkins argued that the absence of a Pennsylvania 
statute addressing the topic meant that federal common law had to be applied to the 
case. Should the federal court apply the relevant Pennsylvania state law, or should the 
court be free to exercise its independent judgment about what the common law of the 
state is or should be? See Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938).
 14. In July 2011, two high-speed trains collided near Wenzhou, China. Shortly after, law 
offices in Wenzhou were notified by the local judicial bureau and lawyers’ association 
to “immediately report” requests for legal assistance and told not to respond “without 
authorization.”64
 
  
In your view, would China benefit from a Western-style approach to litigation? 
 Explain.
 15. Boschetto, a California resident, bought a 1964 Ford Galaxie 500XL advertised on 
eBay from Hansing, a Wisconsin resident. Hansing said the car was in excellent condi-
tion, including an “R code” classification. After delivery to California, Boschetto dis-
covered many problems including the fact that the car was not an “R code.” The parties 
could not reach an out-of-court settlement so Boschetto sued. Hansing moved for dis-
missal of the claim on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction. Does the fact that 
the transaction was conducted via eBay satisfy the jurisdictional requirement? Explain. 
See Boschetto v. Hansing, 539 F.3d 1011 (9th Cir. 2008); cert. den. Boschetto v. 
 Hansing, 129 S. Ct. 1318 (2009).
 16. University of Chicago law professor Richard Epstein pointed out how quickly Americans 
turn to legal remedies rather than relying on informal social customs (negotiation, neigh-
borhood groups, simply accepting small losses and disturbances rather than fighting about 
them) to resolve conflicts. In your view, why are social customs often ineffective in settling 
disputes in this country? Explain.
 17. Judicial reform advocates often argue that the United States should adopt the English 
rule providing that the losing party in a lawsuit must pay the reasonable litigation 
 expenses of the winner.
a. In brief, what are the strengths and weaknesses of the English rule?
b. Would you favor it? Explain. See “Loser Pays, Everyone Wins,” The Wall Street 
Journal, December 15, 2010 [http://online.wsj.com/].
 18. Plaintiff Jonathan Gold was hired to work at defendant Deutsche Bank after completing 
his MBA degree at New York University. Before beginning employment, Gold signed 
various documents, including Form U-4 that the National Association of Securities Deal-
ers (NASD) required all registered representatives to sign. Form U-4 provided for arbi-
tration for all employment disputes. Gold was fired after working about one year. He 
then filed suit claiming sexual harassment based on his sexual orientation. Deutsche 
Bank moved to compel arbitration. Gold resisted arbitration arguing, among other things, 
that Form U-4 was too difficult to understand and that it raised questions in his mind. 

Chapter Four  The American Legal System  185
Gold also showed that Deutsche Bank had certified that it provided Gold with the rele-
vant NASD rules when it had not. Was Gold required to submit his claim to arbitration? 
Explain. See Gold v. Deutsche Aktiengesellschaft, 365 F.3d 144 (2d Cir. 2004); cert. den. 
Gold v. Deutsche Aktiengesellschaft, 543 U.S. 874 (2004).

After completing this chapter, students will be able to:
 1. Recognize the purposes of the U.S. Constitution.
 2. Describe the separation of powers under the U.S. Constitution.
 3. Identify the freedoms protected under the First Amendment.
 4. Describe the powerful role the Bill of Rights plays in protecting personal freedoms.
 5.  Discuss the differences between First Amendment protections of commercial speech versus 
political speech.

We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, 
insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, 
and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish 
this Constitution for the United States of America.
The Preamble to the United States Constitution is both inspiring and touching in its 
expression of the founders’ idealistic goals for America. In reading the Preamble, we 
should reflect on the dream of America and the Constitution’s role in molding and 
 protecting an entirely new image of a nation. That we continue to be guided, more than 
220 years later, by the Constitutions rather few words is testimony to the brilliance and 
wisdom of its creators and to Americans’ determination to build a free, democratic, just 
society. The U.S. Constitution is a remarkable document, so powerful in its ideas and 
images that it has helped shape the entire world. (See the Constitution in Appendix A at 
the back of this text.)

Chapter Five  Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights  189
Creating a Constitution—The United States
You may recall that the Constitution grew out of the 1778 Articles of Confederation. The 
Articles contemplated a “firm league of friendship,” but each state was to maintain its 
“sovereignty, freedom, and independence.” The Articles soon proved faulty. Seven years 
of war had basically bankrupted the colonies. Currency was largely worthless. The 13 new 
states fought over economic resources, interstate disputes were routine, and the federal 
union that emerged under the Articles of Confederation had little real authority. As a result 
of this turmoil, and in an effort to strengthen the Articles, the Constitutional Convention 
was called to order in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787.
 
The decision to convene the Convention may have been a first in world history in that 
the state leaders themselves acknowledged that the existing federal government was faulty, 
the citizenry calmly talked things over, violence was avoided, and the decision was made 
to go forward with the Convention. In the hot Philadelphia summer, with windows and 
curtains closed to assure secrecy (as a means of encouraging open debate), the often 
chubby and usually heavily clothed delegates sweated their way toward a new govern-
ment. All 55 delegates, our Founding Fathers, were white males, 
and most of them were wealthy landowners, but they were also 
 immensely talented with a wide range of interests and experiences.
The delegates agreed that a stronger central government was needed, 
but they were split on just how far that notion should go. Virginia, led 
by the brilliant James Madison, favored a dominant central government with greatly dimin-
ished state authority. Alexander Hamilton wanted to go further yet by, among other things, in-
stituting the presidency as a lifetime office. On the other hand, several states, led by New 
Jersey, wanted to retain strong states’ rights. After weeks of debate, a middle ground began to 
emerge that led toward our current balance of power between big states and small states and 
between all of the states and the federal government. In the end, the delegates reached consen-
sus on a Constitution that guaranteed the revolutionary notion of rule by the people.
 
On September 17, 1787, the great document, one of the most influential expressions in 
human history, was formally signed. Following bitter disputes in some states, the Constitu-
tion was ratified and the new government haltingly moved forward under the leadership of 
George Washington and John Adams.1 [For links to national constitutions around the globe, 
see http://confinder.richmond.edu]
All 55 delegates, our 
Founding Fathers, were 
white males.
A Right to Bear Arms
Addressing one of the most contentious questions in American constitutional history, the 
U.S. Supreme Court in 2008 ruled 5–4 that the Second Amendment guarantees individual 
Americans a fundamental right to bear arms. The Supreme Court’s four conservative jus-
tices, joined by the more moderate Justice Kennedy, ruled that individuals have a constitu-
tional right to keep loaded arms for self-defense, at least in the home. The majority view 
was based on its reading of the historical record associated with the Second Amendment, 
while the four dissenting, liberal justices argued that the Second Amendment guaranteed 
only a collective right to bear arms in a militia.

190  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
 
The decision struck down a District of Columbia law that effectively banned handgun 
possession. Security guard Dick Heller applied for and was denied a permit for a handgun 
in his home located in a dangerous Washington, D.C. neighborhood. He sued the District 
arguing that the gun ban violated his individual rights under the Second Amendment. The 
Court did preserve the constitutionality of “reasonable” gun regulations and Justice Scalia, 
writing for the majority, said nothing in the ruling should “cast doubt on long-standing 
prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons or the mentally ill, or laws forbidding 
the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or 
laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.” “Dangerous 
and unusual” weapons also could be banned.
 
In its 2010 McDonald v. Chicago decision,2 the Supreme Court extended its Heller 
reasoning (applying only to federal jurisdictions) to the states and cities. Much more litiga-
tion remains. Lower court decisions are thus far split on the crucial question of whether 
states may lawfully bar or strictly limit carrying guns in p ublic for self-defense. Recent 
mass murders in a Wisconsin Sikh temple, in an Aurora, Colorado, movie theater, and at 
Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, have energized the national 
debate over gun control. But according to a 2012 Gallup Poll, a record 74 percent of Amer-
icans support the right to own a handgun,3 and Congress rejected new gun control meas-
ures following the Sandy Hook shootings.
Questions
1. As you interpret the Second Amendment, did the Supreme Court reach a correct 
 decision in the Heller case? Explain.
2. In Chicago, 32 public school students died of gunshot wounds in 2009.4 In all of 
 Australia in 2008, by contrast, 30 people died by gun homicide.5 As a matter of public 
policy, did the Supreme Court reach a wise decision in the Heller case? Explain.
3. Six states specifically permit the concealed carrying of weapons on campus by students 
and others with the remaining states about evenly split between those that ban the 
 concealed carrying of weapons on college campuses and those that leave the decision 
to the school. What are your thoughts about student s and faculty members carrying

Structure and Purpose
The Preamble identifies certain goals for our society, such as unity (among the various 
states), justice, domestic tranquility (peace), defense from outsiders, increasing general 
welfare, and liberty. Article I creates Congress and enumerates its powers. Article I, 
 Section 8, Clause 3 is particularly important because it gives Congress the power to regu-
late commerce (the Commerce Clause). Article II sets up the executive branch, headed by 
the president, while Article III establishes the court system. Articles IV and VI, as well as 
the 14th Amendment, address the relationship between the federal government and the 
states. Article VI provides in Clause 2 (the Supremacy Clause) for the supremacy of 
federal law over state law. Article V provides for amendments to the Constitution. The 

Chapter Five  Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights  191
first 10 amendments, known as the Bill of Rights, were ratified by the states and put into 
effect in 1791. The remaining 17 amendments (11 through 27) were adopted at various 
times from 1798 through 1992.
 
From this review we can see that the Constitution serves a number of broad roles:
1. It establishes a national government.
2. It controls the relationship between the national government and the government of 
the states.
3. It defines and preserves personal liberty.
4. It contains provisions to enable the government to perpetuate itself.6
The Founding Fathers—Should We Move On?
Author Mark Kurlansky argues that the Founding Fathers’ great accomplishment is losing 
its luster:
I am sick and tired of the founding fathers and all their intents. The real American 
question of our times is how our country in a little over 200 years sank from the 
great hope to the most backward democracy in the West. The U.S. offers the worst 
healthcare program, one of the worst public school systems and the worst benefits 
for workers. The margin between rich and poor has been growing precipitously 
while it has been decreasing in Europe. Among the great democracies, we use 
 military might less cautiously, show less respect for international law and are the 
stumbling block in international environmental cooperation. Few informed people 
look to the United States anymore for progressive ideas. We ought to do something. 
Instead, we keep worrying about the vision of a bunch of sexist, slave-owning 
18th century white men in wigs and breeches.
Question
As noted on the first page of this chapter, the United States Constitution has been one of 
the most influential documents in global history. In recent decades, however, critics such 
as Kurlansky have criticized our Constitution for being out of touch with the times. They 
criticize our distinguished system of checks and balances as a source of the current politi-
cal gridlock in Washington, and they argue for a Constitution that can more easily be 
amended, among other complaints. They point to empirical evidence showing that consti-
tutional similarities between other nations and the United States have plunged while emu-
lation of the Canadian constitution, in particular, has soared. Canada’s charter guarantees 
equal rights for women and people with disabilities, permits affirmative action, and re-
quires notice of their rights to those who are arrested. Those rights are balanced against 
“such reasonable limits” as “can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic soci-
ety.” Other national constitutions protect the right to food, education, and health care.
 
Do you think our Constitution is out of touch with contemporary times and should 
 specifically be amended to guarantee the personal rights noted above? Explain.

192  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Government Power and Constitutional Restraints
Among other goals, the Constitution was designed to protect the citizenry from the govern-
ment. The Constitution does not protect citizens from purely private concentrations of 
power, such as large corporations. In fact, corporations themselves are often entitled to the 
protections of the Constitution. (Remember the Citizens United discussion in Chapter 3.) 
The Constitution divides governmental power between the federal and state governments. 
Congressional authority is formally limited to certain  enumerated powers (Article I, Sec-
tion 8), such as the authority to regulate commerce. The 10th Amendment provides that 
all power not expressly accorded to the federal government in the Constitution resides 
in the states or the people. Certain constitutional checks or restraints, including the Bill of 
Rights, limit how far Congress can reach even within its enumerated powers. In practice, 
however, those enumerated powers have been expansively interpreted, giving Congress 
extensive authority in American life. Furthermore, in the landmark 1819 Supreme Court 
decision, McCulloch v. Maryland,7 the U.S. Supreme Court interpreted the Necessary 
and Proper Clause (Article I,  Section 8) to afford Congress those implied powers neces-
sary to execute the enumerated powers, thus achieving a workable national government. 
The  McCulloch court also ruled that the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause (Article VI—
“This Constitution and the Laws of the United States . . . shall be the Supreme Law of the 
Land.”) nullifies state action that conflicts with federal law. Thus, in one sweeping deci-
sion, the Supreme Court dramatically expanded the power of Congress and certified the 
federal government’s superior authority relative to the states.
Too Much Government?
Has that federal power and regulation gone too far? Massive federal intervention in 
health care, to combat the “Great Recession,” to deal with the subprime mortgage 
 crisis, and to reform banking practices (see Chapter 8) generated renewed pleas for 
restraints on an “overreaching” federal government. The Tea 
Party movement emerged in 2009, and a heated national debate 
has ensued about the appropriate balance between individual 
rights as  expressed in the free market versus an interventionist 
federal government designed to correct market failures and protect those least able to 
care for themselves.
Separation of Powers
As a further means of controlling the power of government, the Constitution sets up the 
three federal branches and provides mechanisms for them to act as checks and balances on 
each other. The President, Congress, and the courts each have specialized areas of authority, 
as provided for by the Constitution. Congress has the sole power to legislate at the federal 
level, whereas the president, among other things, executes laws, makes treaties, and com-
mands the armed forces; the Supreme Court and the inferior courts have judicial authority 
at the federal level. The result is a system of separation of powers designed to prevent too 
much authority from residing in any one branch. Thus, the president has the power to veto 
acts of Congress; those vetoes can be overridden by a two-thirds vote of each house, and 
the judiciary can find those acts unconstitutional.
The “Tea Party” 
movement emerged.

Chapter Five  Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights  193
 
The role of the judiciary has been a matter of particular controversy in recent years. The 
historic 1803 Marbury v. Madison decision8 was the first time the Supreme Court had de-
clared an act of Congress unconstitutional, and the decision also established the principle 
of judicial review; that is, the power of the courts to consider and, if necessary, invalidate 
congressional and executive branch decisions. Although neither of those powers was ex-
pressly provided for in the Constitution, the Court considered them to be implicit in the 
legal structure created by the Constitution. Critics today argue that the Marbury reasoning 
has been stretched too far and that, in effect, courts have been making law, rather than 
merely interpreting it. Those critics say that federal and state judicial decisions finding a 
“constitutional right” to, for example, abortion or same-sex marriage, have reduced the 
authority of our directly elected legislators and placed too much power in the hands of ju-
rists who are necessarily somewhat removed from the weight of public opinion.9 On the 
other hand, an aggressive judiciary has played a crucial role in the advance of justice and 
the protection of personal freedom. [For the National Constitution Center, see http:// 
www.constitutioncenter.org]
Questions
1.  As noted, the Constitution does not expressly authorize judicial review. Should we, 
therefore, assume that the framers of the Constitution did not intend to afford that power 
to the courts? 
2. In your view, do the courts have too much power in our lives? Explain.
Federalism
The U.S. government is built on federalism principles; that is, the Constitution  provides 
for shared power among national, state, and local governments. A  primary role of the 
Constitution is to balance central federal authority with dispersed state power. The 
 American Civil War was provoked in part because of differing conceptions of federalism. 
Southerners held the view, labeled states rights, that each state was en titled to make its 
own policy decisions about crucial matters such as slavery, while Northerners favored a 
strong central government. That constitutional divide over  federalism persists today. 
Many “conservative” Americans distrust big government and favor bringing power closer 
to the people. They think the federal government has often exercised authority beyond its 
 express constitutional powers. “Liberals,” on the other hand, tend to fear local biases and 
favor a more unified  national approach to issues such as regulation of business, 
 educational policy, medical care, and civil rights.
The Constitution and the New Federalism
After decades of interpreting the Constitution in a flexible, expansive manner that accorded 
great power to the federal government, the Supreme Court in the mid-1990s revisited the 
 federal–state balance of power with some decisions curbing federal authority. No major 
federal initiative was struck down, but the Court signaled legislators and lower courts to 
look more closely at the federal–state level.
 
The new federalism expressed itself in a landmark 2013 U.S.  Supreme Court decision, 
Shelby County v. Holder,10 that challenged the constitutionality of the federal Voting 
Rights Act of 1965 which, among other things, subjected nine mostly southern states to 

194  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
federal  supervision of their election processes because of a long his-
tory of discrimination against minorities in voting practices. Those 
states often gerrymandered election districts and imposed “voter in-
tegrity” rules (e.g., literacy tests, character standards, and onerous 
identification requirements) that officially were designed to assure honesty in elections, 
but often had sought to exclude minorities from voting. 
 
Under the 1965 act any change to voting rules in the covered states required “pre- 
clearance” from the federal government. Shelby County, Alabama, challenged the Voting 
Rights Act, claiming, in brief, that in reauthorizing the act in 2006, Congress exceeded its 
constitutional authority and in so doing violated state and local rights. By a 5–4 vote, di-
vided on familiar conservative–liberal grounds, the Supreme Court ruled for Shelby County 
saying that Section 4(b) of the act, determining which jurisdictions’ voting practices were 
tainted by discrimination and thus required pre-clearance, was based on 40-year-old dis-
crimination data and thus did not necessarily speak to current conditions. The Supreme 
Court acknowledged the effectiveness of the act in reducing voting discrimination, but said 
that discriminatory practices and the states that use them have changed and Congress must 
keep the law up to date. The act and its supporting data can, of course, be revisited, but 
given Congress’s current fractures, analysts do not expect quick action. A number of south-
ern states rushed to enforce or enact new restrictions on voting following the Shelby County 
decision. In response, Attorney General Eric Holder in 2013 filed a federal suit asking that 
Texas get federal permission before making election law changes over the next 10 years.11 
 
Like the voting rights struggle, we are in the midst of a furious immigration dispute pit-
ting global federal control versus individual states that want to address their specific prob-
lems through their own legislation. On the other side of the coin, when a state like 
California, known for its aggressive rules on workplace safety, consumer protection, and 
environmental quality, imposes new restrictions, the business community may fight back 
in Washington, D.C. by seeking federal laws to make uniform rules for all the states, thus 
restraining or preempting California’s protective measures. 12 
Question
California rules, for example, prohibit the sale of eggs laid by hens confined to very small 
cages. What issues would you cite if Congress were to respond to the California standards 
by considering new federal rules?
The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and Business
The Constitution and, in particular, the Commerce Clause profoundly shape the practice of 
American business. Indeed, in some important ways, the Constitution is a commercial docu-
ment reflecting the economic interests of the framers. We will defer further discussion of the 
Commerce Clause and the Supremacy Clause until Chapter 8. In this chapter, we will devote 
our attention primarily to the Bill of Rights, which serves to limit the powers of the federal 
government and the states. When we think of the Bill of Rights, corporations ordinarily do not 
come to mind. Extensive litigation in recent years, however, serves notice that the relationship 
between the corporate “person” and the fundamental freedoms is both important and unclear.
 
The Bill of Rights protects our personal freedoms (speech, religion, and more) from 
encroachment by the federal government. Furthermore, the Supreme Court has ruled that 
Long history of discrimination 
in voting practices.

Chapter Five  Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights  195
the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment, which is directed at the states,  absorbs 
or incorporates those fundamental freedoms and protects them against intrusion by state 
governments. [For the “Guide to Law Online,” prepared by the U.S. Law Library of 
Congress, see http://www.loc.gov/law/help/guide.php]
The First Amendment
Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free 
exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or the press; or the right of the people 
peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.
 
These few words constitute one of the most powerful and noble utterances in history. 
Much of the magnificence that we often associate with America is embodied in the protec-
tions of the First Amendment. Surely we must feel some sense of wonder that our more than 
316 million independent citizens continue to rely on that sentence as a cornerstone of Amer-
ican life. [For the First Amendment Center, see http://www.  firstamendmentcenter.org/]
1. Freedom of Religion
The First Amendment forbids (1) the establishment of an official state religion (the Estab-
lishment Clause) and (2) undue state interference with religious practice (the Free Exercise 
Clause). Government may neither encourage nor discourage the practice of  religion gener-
ally, nor may it give preference to one religion over another. Broadly, the idea of the First 
Amendment is to maintain a separation between church and state. The precise boundary of 
that separation,  however, has become one of the more contentious social issues in contem-
porary life. Prayer in the schools and Ten Commandment displays have received extensive 
publicity, but the debate is widespread. [For the Freedom Forum database on the First 
Amendment, see http://www.freedomforum.org]
Official State Religion?
North Carolina state legislators introduced a resolution in 2013 asserting the state has a 
right to declare an official state religion (presumably Christianity). The bill apparently was 
a response to an American Civil Liberties Union lawsuit saying that Rowan County was 
violating the First Amendment by opening most of its meetings with a prayer. (A federal 
court of appeals in 2011 had ruled that another North Carolina county’s public prayers did 
violate the First Amendment.)13 The bill was quickly withdrawn by the state Speaker of the 
House. The bill’s sponsors employed reasoning that has gained some currency on the right, 
namely that the Establishment Clause applies only to the federal government, not to the 
states. A series of cases, however, seems to have established the First Amendment applica-
tion to state governments.14
 
A 2013 national poll found that 34 percent of Americans would favor establishing 
Christianity as the official state religion in their own state, and 32 percent favor a constitu-
tional amendment that would make Christianity the nation’s official religion.

Official Religion of USA,” Forbes, April 7, 2013 [http://www.forbes.com/].

196  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
God, the Pledge, and Currency
Addressing two long-standing sources of constitutional ferment, three-judge panels of the 
Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2010 ruled that the use of the words “Under God” 
in the Pledge of Allegiance and “In God We Trust” on U.S. currency do not violate the 
 separation of church and state principles of the First Amendment.
 
An atheist, Michael Newdow, said those references amount to an endorsement of 
 religion, thus violating the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Newdow argued 
that the phrase “Under God” was placed in the pledge for religious purposes. Indeed, the 
pledge was amended in 1954 to include the words “Under God,” and some members of 
Congress, at the time, said it was needed to distinguish the United States from  “Godless 
Communists.”15 The panel, however, saw the Pledge of Allegiance 
as an expression of American ideals rather than as a  religious en-
dorsement. Students are not required to recite the pledge.16 As to 
currency, a separate panel said that the phrase “In God We Trust” is simply patriotic and 
ceremonial and has nothing to do with the establishment of religion.17
God and Student Organizations
The University of California Hastings College of the Law refused to recognize a student or-
ganization, the Christian Legal Society (CLS). Hastings said the group’s faith-based rules 
discriminate against gays, lesbians, and others who do not share the group’s religious beliefs. 
The organization’s rules require members to pledge they will not engage in a “sexually im-
moral lifestyle” including “all acts of sexual conduct outside God’s design for  marriage be-
tween one man and one woman.” Thus to Hastings officials, the Pledge  represented 
discrimination based on religion and sexual orientation, whereas CLS members regarded it as 
an expression of faith. CLS challenged Hastings’s policy as a violation of the member stu-
dents’ First Amendment rights to freedom of religion, speech, and association. The U.S. 
 Supreme Court, by a 5–4 margin, ruled in 2010 that the students’ constitutional rights were 
not violated in that the university policy was a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral condition on 
access to student recognition in a public university. The majority reasoned that Hastings was 
concerned about the group’s exclusionary conduct rather than its religious beliefs. That is, all 
student groups must be open to all students. Dissenting justices said the decision supported 
suppression of  unpopular and politically incorrect speech.18
 
According to The Huffington Post, 41 InterVarsity Christian Fellowship campus chapters 
say they were challenged following the CLS decision (many of those disputes were resolved). 
Critics point out that  fraternities and sororities are allowed to discriminate based on gender, but 
overall, campus religious organization s seem to be adapting to the changing legal landscape.19
Godless Communists.
Veils and French Values
France, in 2011, began enforcing its new law forbidding, with some exceptions, the wear-
ing of a garment in public that hides the wearer’s face. The law was promoted as a matter 
of security and of cultural assimilation while it was assailed as an affront to the Muslim 
faith and a political move designed to appeal to voters worried about threats to traditional 
European values and culture. Only an estimated 2,000 women of the 5 million French 
Muslims are believed to wear burqas or niqabs covering the face.

Chapter Five  Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights  197
2. Freedom of Speech
Hustler Magazine publisher Larry Flynt: “If the First Amendment will protect a scumbag 
like me, then it will protect all of you. Because I am the worst.”20
 
Freedom of speech is the primary guarantor of the American approach to life. Not only 
is it indispensable to democracy and personal dignity, but Americans believe that the free 
expression of ideas is the most likely path to the best ideas. We believe in a marketplace of 
ideas just as we believe in a marketplace of goods.
 
Freedom of speech is not absolute. Clearly we cannot freely 
make slanderous statements about others, publicly utter obscenities 
at will, speak “fighting words” that are likely to produce a clear and 
present danger of violence, or yell “Fire” in a crowded theater.
 
At the same time, in general, the state cannot tell us what we can say; that is, the state 
cannot, for the most part, regulate the content of our speech. On the other hand, the state 
does have greater authority to regulate the context of that speech; that is, the state may be 
able to restrict where, when, and how we say certain things if that regulation is necessary 
to preserve compelling state interests. We have broad free speech rights in so-called public 
forums such as downtown business districts, parks, college campuses, and public plazas. 
Even in those places, however, the state may need to impose reasonable time and manner 
regulations. Thus, although the Ku Klux Klan can express hatred for black people (the 
content of the message), the state may restrict where and when and how those expressions 
are made (the context of the message) if necessary for the public safety. [For freedom of 
speech links, see http://gjs.net/freetalk.htm]
What Is Expression?
Expression is not limited to oral and written utterances. Freedom of speech clearly ex-
tends to messages not communicated with words. Disrobing, for example, might well 
constitute expression under some conditions. In Tinker v. Des Moines School District, 
one of the leading free speech cases in American history, the U.S. Supreme Court found 
First Amendment protection for the wearing of a black armband to a high school as a 
protest against the Vietnam War where no evidence of disruption was  presented.21
Free Speech Analysis
How do we decide when the government has violated speech rights? The courts have taken 
numerous approaches to that question. We will look briefly at cases involving content and con-
text issues. Another tool frequently employed by the courts is the balancing test, where the 
judges must try to weigh the interests of the state against the expressive rights of the individual.
We cannot freely yell “Fire” 
in a crowded theater.
 
Following a little more than one year of experience with the veil law, France reported 
that 425 women had been fined $188 each, and 66 others had received warnings. Police 
say they rarely enforce the law because they do not want to enflame existing tensions, but 
some  Muslim women believe the law stigmatizes them and prevents them from moving 
about freely.

Tolerance,” The New York Times, September 1, 2012 [http://www.nytimes.com/].

198  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Content: Vile Words One of the most controversial Supreme Court cases of recent years 
 involved the Topeka, Kansas, Westboro Baptist Church and its practice of protesting at the fu-
nerals of American soldiers killed in service. Pastor Fred W. Phelps and his small  congregation, 
most of whom are family members, contend that battlefield deaths are God’s punishment for 
America’s sins, including homosexuality. The  funeral protests include 
signs displaying messages such as “Thank God for dead soldiers,” and 
“God Hates Fags.” Pastor Phelps and his family picketed the 2006 fu-
neral of Matthew  Snyder, a Marine who had been killed in Iraq. 
 Snyder’s father sued Phelps and Westboro and won a $10.9 million damage award  (reduced by 
the judge to $5 million) based on his claims of invasion of  privacy and intentional infliction of 
emotional distress. That  decision was reversed on appeal, and the case reached the U.S. 
 Supreme Court in 2011 where the church’s First Amendment freedom of expression argument 
prevailed by an 8–1 margin.22 The majority ruled that the Westboro protests addressed matters 
of public importance on a public street at a distance from the funeral (approximately 1,000 feet) 
specified by authorities. The picketing was quiet and without violence.
 
Thus, the Court’s unpopular decision affirmed the longstanding position that the 
 government ordinarily cannot restrict speech based on its content, however tasteless or value-
less. As lawyer and commentator Adam Cohen said about the Westboro speech, “We defend 
it not because these ideas are particularly worthy of being protected, but because all ideas, 
even the most loathsome, are.”23 Recent federal legislation requires demonstrators to be at 
least 300 feet from military funerals from two hours before to two hours after the ceremonies.
Context: Panhandling  Courts have consistently concluded that begging for money on 
the street constitutes expression. The context of the begging, that is, when, where, and how 
the begging is conducted may affect its constitutionality. Thus, for example, some re-
straints on panhandling in the street at stop signs or on aggressive panhandling might well 
be permissible. The content of the message (begging) is not restricted, but for compelling 
reasons, authorities might lawfully shift the time, place,  or manner of the expression.
Balancing Interests: Speech at School Joseph Frederick was across the street from his 
school with many other students watching, with school permission, an Olympic torch pa-
rade when Frederick, a Juneau, Alaska, high school senior, and some friends unfurled a 
large banner reading “Bong Hits 4 Jesus.” The banner was a prank designed to attract at-
tention from television cameras. The school principal, Deborah 
Morse, told Frederick to lower the banner. He refused, and he was 
suspended from school. Frederick sued, and the case reached the 
U.S. Supreme Court. Does the First Amendment protect  Frederick? [See Deborah Morse 
v. Joseph Frederick, 127 S.Ct. 2618 (2007); and Mark W. Cordes, “Making Sense of High 
School School Speech after Morse v. Frederick,” 17 Wm. & Mary Bill Rts. J. 657 (2009)]
Public Sector Workers Off the Job? On the Job?
Remember that the Constitution and Bill of Rights protect us from the government but not 
from, for example, our corporate employer. On the other hand, the First Amendment does gen-
erally shield public-sector workers’ off-the-job expressions when speaking as citizens about 
matters of public concern. Nonetheless, employer restrictions necessary to effective operation 
of the government enterprise may sometimes be permissible, as illustrated by the 2008  dismissal

America’s sins.

of Crystal Dixon, an African-American woman and the University of  Toledo’s interim associ-
ate vice president for human resources. Dixon wrote, in response to another commentary and 
during off-work hours, an op-ed column in the  Toledo Free Press newspaper in which she said, 
among other things, that homosexuals should not be considered civil 
rights victims because they choose their lifestyle whereas race is a mat-
ter of genetics. Dixon’s comments did not mention her job. Soon there-
after Dixon was fired because her views were inconsistent with 
established university goals and values, including its diversity policies. Dixon sued, claiming, 
among other things, that her free speech rights were violated. In 2012, the Sixth Circuit Federal 
Court of Appeals ruled against Dixon, reasoning that the university’s interest in efficient, effec-
tive operations outweighed Dixon’s First Amendment rights since she was a university policy 
maker who spoke on a policy related to her position.24
 
Government employees’ free speech rights are substantially limited on the job. Los 
Angeles Deputy District Attorney Richard Ceballos lost his job in a whistle-blowing epi-
sode. Ceballos sued; the U.S. Supreme Court in 2006 ruled that government employees 
who speak out “pursuant to their official duties” are speaking as employees, not citizens, 
and therefore are not protected by the First Amendment. From discipline, regardless of the 
content of their message. The Court pointed to the government’s need for efficiency and 
order in its workplace.25 In 2014, the United States Supreme Court clarified that public 
workers act as citizens when they testify under oath; therefore, the First Amendment pro-
tects them from retaliation based on their testimony.
Politically Correct Speech
We are largely free of government restraints on what we can say, but should it be so? Is free 
speech often too hurtful to be tolerated? In 2013, celebrity chef Paula Deen lost her Food 
Network job and business relationships with J. C. Penney, Sears, Target, and others when 
she acknowledged that she had, in the past, used the “N-word” in remarks to others. New 
editions of the Mark Twain novels Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer have 
recently been  published with the “N-word” being replaced by the word “slave” in an effort 
to avoid disturbing readers. Disputes about offensive  language often arise in university life 
where the law requires policies to curb and punish civil rights violations, including racial 
and sexual harassment. As a result, many  universities have “speech 
codes” of one form or another  designed to stop hate speech, harass-
ment, bullying, and other  offensive conduct. In 2013, the federal De-
partments of Justice and Education issued a “blueprint” for colleges 
nationwide that, according to critics, redefines sexual harassment to include “unwelcome 
conduct of a sexual nature.”26 The breadth and vagueness of that phrase and other elements 
of the blueprint caused U.S. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) to write to U.S. Attorney General 
Eric Holder asking, among other things, if sexual harassment might arise from, for example, 
a professor showing a movie with sexual content, a student overhearing a joke with sexual 
content, or a student asking another student for a date.27 The government has indicated that 
the blueprint is designed to help students feel comfortable in reporting harassment, and it is 
not intended to alter legal standards for establishing unlawful harassment (see Chapter 13). 
The federal blueprint and campus speech codes are designed to maintain safe, civil learning 
environments that embrace diverse cultures, but critics argue that the restraints are unconsti-
Homosexuals should not be 
considered civil rights victims.

tutional and that they amount to a demand for politically correct speech, that is, speech that 
avoids hurtful words.
Yale  Complaints of a hostile sexual environment and intimidation of female students 
caused Yale University in 2011 to impose a five-year ban on all campus activities for a 
prestigious fraternity that counts both Bush presidents among its alumni. One of the 
complaints involved the fraternity’s pledges chanting, “No means yes! Yes means anal!” 
 outside a women’s dormitory area. Other, more individualized and more  threatening 
concerns were also raised. Following a federal investigation, Yale agreed to changes in 
its harassment policy and reached a settlement that did not involve  disciplinary action.28 
To what extent should university officials and the government be able to curb student 
speech, however infantile and offensive, in order to achieve a  laudable goal?
Maricopa CCC  A number of university speech codes have been 
 invalidated as violations of First Amendment rights.29 Recently, a 
 Maricopa County Community College (Arizona) math instructor won a 
Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals decision involving his right to send 
racially charged e-mails over the school district–maintained server to 
all employees with an e-mail address. Professor Walter  Kehowski sent 
three messages declaring, for example, that: “It’s time to  acknowledge and celebrate the supe-
riority of Western Civilization.” On his university-maintained website, he said, “[T]he only 
immigration reform imperative is preservation of White majority (sic).” A group of Hispanic 
employees then sued the school district claiming that it had failed to properly respond to 
 Kehowski’s remarks, thus allowing the creation of a hostile work environment. The Court of 
Appeals, however, ruled that the e-mails addressed matters of public concern and were 
 protected by the First Amendment and thus could not constitute illegal harassment. The Court 
did note that some workplace harassment, such as  racial insults or sexual advances toward 
 particular individuals, may be prohibited because it lacks the expressive quality of speech 
 directed toward a larger audience.30
“The right to provoke, 
 offend, and shock lies at 
the core of the First 
 Amendment.”
“Be Happy, Not Gay”
Following a day designated to show support for gays and lesbians at her high school in 
Naperville, Illinois, student Heidi Zamecnik wore a T-shirt to school displaying the 
 expression “Be Happy, Not Gay.” The school’s dean forbade the expression at the school. 
Another student, Alexander Nuxoll, unsuccessfully sought to wear a similar shirt. Both 
students objected to homosexuality on religious grounds. The two students subsequently 
sued the school for infringing their free speech rights. The Seventh Circuit U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals reasoned that the forbidden expression did not constitute “fighting 
words” or some other recognized First Amendment exception and ruled that the students 
had a right to wear the shirts and express their opinions.
 
Judge Richard Posner said:
[A] school that permits advocacy of the rights of homosexual students cannot be al-
lowed to stifle criticism of homosexuality. The school argued (and still argues) that 

Chapter Five  Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights  201
banning “Be Happy, Not Gay” was just a matter of protecting the “rights” of the 
 students against whom derogatory comments are directed. But people in our society do 
not have a legal right to prevent criticism of their beliefs or even their way of life.

Ole Miss  Notwithstanding decisions such as Maricopa CCC, colleges and universities 
have sometimes been accorded considerable latitude in dealing with speech issues. The 
Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, for example, upheld the right of the University of Missis-
sippi to ban flags, including the Confederate flag, at campus events.31 Specifically banning 
only the Confederate flag presumably would not have met with the Court’s approval.
George Mason  Many First Amendment scholars believe the correct antidote to hate 
speech is simply more speech; that is, they place their faith in the marketplace of ideas 
rather than in rules, however well intended. The decision that follows demonstrates the 
First Amendment’s role in resolving claims of racism, sexism, and general insensitivity 
springing from a George Mason University fraternity’s “ugly woman contest.” [For a 
vigorous critique of campus “political correctness,” see the Foundation for Individual 
Rights in Education at http://thefire.org/]

events. The involved Fraternity members appeared in the 
 contest dressed as caricatures of different types of women, 
including one member dressed as an offensive caricature of a 
black woman. He was painted black and wore stringy, black 
hair decorated with curlers, and his outfit was stuffed with 
 pillows to exaggerate a woman’s breasts and buttocks. He 
spoke in slang to parody African-Americans.
 
There is no direct evidence in the record concerning the 
subjective intent of the Fraternity members who conducted 
the contest. The Fraternity, which later apologized to the Uni-
versity officials for the presentation, conceded during the liti-
gation that the contest was sophomoric and offensive.
 
Following the contest, a number of students protested to 
the University that the skit had been objectionably sexist and 
racist. Two hundred forty-seven students, many of them mem-
bers of the foreign or minority student body, executed a 
 petition, which stated, “[W]e are condemning the racist and

Sigma Chi has for two years held an annual “Derby Days”

dressed as women. One man in particular wore a black face, 
portraying a negative stereotype of black women.”
 
Dean for Student Services Kenneth Bumgarner discussed 
the situation with representatives of the objecting students 
[and] student representatives of Sigma Chi. [The University de-
cided to impose sanctions on Sigma Chi including] suspension 
from [most] activities for the rest of the 1991 spring semester 
and a two-year prohibition. . . .
 
On June 5, 1991, Sigma Chi brought this action against the 
University and Dean Bumgarner. It requested declaratory 
judgment and injunctive relief to nullify the sanctions as 
 violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Sigma 
Chi moved for summary judgment on its First Amendment 
claims on June 28, 1991.

here is not limited to the classroom.
 
(4) We are committed to teaching the values of equal

We initially face the task of deciding whether Sigma Chi’s 
“ugly woman contest” is sufficiently expressive to entitle it to 
First Amendment protection.
* * * * *
A
First Amendment principles governing live entertainment are 
relatively clear: Short of obscenity, it is generally protected. As 
the Supreme Court announced in Schad v. Borough of Mount 
Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61 (1981), “[e]ntertainment, as well as 
 political and ideological speech, is protected; motion pictures, 
 programs broadcast by radio and television, and live enter-
tainment . . . fall within the First Amendment guarantee.” 
 Expression devoid of “ideas” but with entertainment value 
may also be protected because “[t]he line between the inform-
ing and the entertaining is too elusive.” Winters v. New York, 
333 U.S. 507, 510 (1948).
* * * * *
 
Even crude street skits come within the First Amendment’s 
reach. In . . . Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58, 61–62 
(1970), . . . Justice Black [declared] that an actor participating 
in even a crude performance enjoys the constitutional right to 
freedom of speech.
 
Bearing on this dichotomy between low- and high-grade 
entertainment are the Supreme Court’s holdings relating to 
nude dancing. See Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 111 S.Ct. 2456, 
2460 (1991).
 
[I]n Barnes, the Supreme Court conceded that nude 
dancing is expressive conduct entitled to First Amendment 
protection.
* * * * *
 
. . . [I]t appears that the low quality of entertainment does 
not necessarily weigh in the First Amendment inquiry. It would 
seem, therefore, that the Fraternity’s skit, even as low-grade 
entertainment, was inherently expressive and thus entitled to 
First Amendment protection.
B
The University nevertheless contends that discovery will 
 demonstrate that the contest does not merit characterization 
as a skit but only as mindless fraternity fun, devoid of any artis-
tic expression. It argues further that entitlement to First 
Amendment protection exists only if the production was 
 intended to convey a message likely to be understood by a 
particular audience. . . .
 
As indicated, we feel that the First Amendment protects 
the Fraternity’s skit because it is inherently expressive en-
tertainment. Even if this were not true, however, the skit, in 
our view, qualifies as expressive conduct under the test 
articulated in Texas v.  Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989). It is 
true that the Johnson test for determining the expressive-
ness of conduct requires “‘[a]n intent to convey a particu-
larized message’” and a great likelihood “‘that the message 
would be understood by those who viewed it.’”
* * * * *

Chapter Five  Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights  203
 
[T]he affidavits establish that the punishment was meted 
out to the Fraternity because its boorish message had inter-
fered with the described University mission. It is manifest from 
these circumstances that the University officials thought the 
Fraternity intended to convey a message. The Fraternity mem-
bers’ apology and post-conduct contriteness suggest that they 
held the same view.
* * * * *
 
As to the second prong of the Johnson test, there was a 
great likelihood that at least some of the audience viewing the 
skit would understand the Fraternity’s message of satire and 
 humor. Some students paid to attend the performance and 
were entertained. . . .
* * * * *
 
. . . [W]e are persuaded that the Fraternity’s “ugly 
woman contest” satisfies the Johnson test for expressive 
conduct.
IV
If this were not a sufficient response to the University’s 
 argument, the principles relating to content and viewpoint 
discrimination recently emphasized in R.A.V. v. City of St. 
Paul, 112 S.Ct. 2538 (1992) provide a definitive answer. Al-
though the Court in St. Paul reviewed the constitutional 
 effect of a city “hate speech” ordinance, and we review the 
constitutionality of sanctions imposed for violating Univer-
sity policy, St. Paul’s rationale applies here with equal 
force. Noting that St. Paul’s city ordinance prohibited dis-
plays of symbols that “arouse[d] anger, alarm, or resent-
ment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, or 
gender,” but did not prohibit displays of symbols which 
would advance ideas of racial or religious equality, Justice 
Scalia stated, “The First Amendment does not permit 
St. Paul to impose special prohibitions on those speakers 
who express views on disfavored subjects.”
 
As evidenced by their affidavits, University officials sanc-
tioned Sigma Chi for the message conveyed by the “ugly 
woman contest” because it ran counter to the views the 
 University sought to communicate to its students and the 
 community. The mischief was the University’s punishment of 
those who scoffed at its goals of racial integration and gender 
neutrality, while permitting, even encouraging, conduct that 
would further the viewpoint expressed in the University’s 
goals and probably be embraced by a majority of society as 
well. “The First Amendment generally prevents government 
from proscribing . . . expressive conduct because of disap-
proval of the ideas expressed.”
 
The University, however, urges us to weigh Sigma Chi’s 
conduct against the substantial interests inherent in educa-
tional endeavors. We agree wholeheartedly that it is the 
 University officials’ responsibility, even their obligation, to 
achieve the goals they have set. On the other hand, a public 
university has many constitutionally permissible means to pro-
tect female and minority students. We must emphasize, as 
have other courts, that “the manner of [its action] cannot 
 consist of selective limitations upon speech.” The University 
should have accomplished its goals in some fashion other than 
silencing speech on the basis of its viewpoint.
 
Affirmed.
Questions
1. Is speech that consists merely of entertainment without 
benefit of meaningful ideas protected by the First Amend-
ment? Explain.
2. Explain the Court’s conclusion that the fraternity skit met 
the Texas v. Johnson test of “an intent to convey a particu-
larized message” and a great likelihood “that the message 
would be understood by those who viewed it.”
3. a.  Should racist/sexist remarks be forbidden in college 
classrooms?
 
b.  The Stanford University speech code was ruled uncon-
stitutional and the Superior Court judge in that case said, 
among other things, that the code was “overbroad.”32 
What did he mean?
 
c.  Do we give too much attention to freedom of speech at 
the expense of community civility? Explain.
4. T.W., a minor, was suspended from school for three days 
after he drew a picture of a Confederate flag on a piece of 
paper. The Kansas school, Derby Unified, suspended T.W. 
because it believed he had violated the district’s “Racial 
Harassment or Intimidation” policy, which prohibits stu-
dents from possessing at school “any written material, ei-
ther printed or in their own handwriting, that is racially 
divisive or creates ill will or hatred.” Confederate flags 
were included in a list of prohibited items. The Court found 
that Derby Unified had a history of racial harassment. 
Were T.W.’s First Amendment rights violated? Explain. See 
West v. Derby Unified School District # 260, 206 F.3d 1358 
(10th Cir. 2000); cert. den. 531 U.S. 825 (2000).
5. The U.S. Supreme Court and lower federal courts have re-
peatedly ruled that burning the American flag is speech 
protected by the First Amendment. Congress often consid-
ers a flag protection amendment to the Constitution to 
make flag burning illegal. Would you favor that amend-
ment? Explain.

204  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Commercial Speech
Governments often want to regulate commercial expressions ranging from advertisements 
and billboards to real estate “for sale” signs and circulars placed on car windshields. Does 
the First Amendment protect those messages from government intervention in the same 
manner that it protects political speech? In 1942, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that com-
mercial speech was not entitled to First Amendment protection.33 Subsequently the Court 
changed its stance and extended First Amendment rights to commercial speech, but those 
rights were much more limited than for political speech. In more recent years, the Court 
has been gradually expanding protection for commercial speech.
Corporate/Commercial Speech  Should corporations enjoy full First Amendment rights? Can 
we properly think of corporate political expressions as commercial speech? Or is commercial 
speech limited to those expressions that propose a commercial transaction? Experts differ on 
these questions, but their importance is evident if we think for a moment about the controversial 
2010 Citizens United decision allowing corporations to spend more freely on elections (dis-
cussed previously in Chapter 3).34 In the late 1970s, Justices William Rehnquist and Byron 
White had described corporations as “creatures of the law” possessed of wealth-creation pow-
ers but not entitled to the rights possessed by voters. By contrast, the Citizens United majority 
described corporations as “associations of citizens” deserving of free speech rights in the man-
ner of individuals.35 Justice Scalia said: “To exclude or impede corporate speech is to muzzle 
the principal agents of the modern economy.” “We should celebrate rather than condemn the 
addition of this speech to the public debate.”36 This shift in constitutional interpretation reflects, 
according to a Los Angeles Times analysis, the  President Ronald Reagan-era efforts to reduce 
government regulation of business. All five justices in the Citizens United majority were either 
appointed to the Court by Reagan or worked as young lawyers in the Reagan administration.37 
Hence, shifting political views sometimes influence the course of judge-made law. Do you 
think a corporation should be regarded as a person for First Amendment purposes?
Cigarette Packs and Graphic Warnings
The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently issued rules requiring, among 
other things, graphic antismoking warnings covering the top half of the front and back of 
cigarette packs. The warnings, in color, included, for example, images of a man exhaling 
cigarette smoke through a tracheotomy hole in his throat and a cloud of cigarette smoke 
surrounding a mother kissing her baby. Tobacco companies challenged the warnings as 
violations of their freedom of expression rights. One federal court of appeals upheld the 
constitutionality of the rules, but another struck them down. The FDA decided to rewrite 
its rules in an effort to resolve the First Amendment issues. 
1. In your view, are the tobacco companies’ speech rights violated by the government’s 
warning requirements? Explain. 
2. Should the govern ment require graphic smoking warnings? Explain.

Chapter Five  Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights  205
Animal Cruelty  Commercial speech disputes raise very difficult legal questions in a 
wide variety of  venues. The Supreme Court in 2010 supported the First Amendment 
rights of a business selling videos depicting animal cruelty. Robert 
J.  Stevens advertised and sold pit bull–related videos showing dog 
fights and dogs attacking wild boar. Stevens was criminally indicted 
for violating a federal statute forbidding knowingly creating, sell-
ing, or possessing “a depiction of animal cruelty” to be sold for commercial gain in inter-
state or foreign commerce. Stevens moved to dismiss the indictment saying that the statute 
 violated his First Amendment right to free speech. The Supreme Court, in an 8–1 ruling, 
agreed with  Stevens by finding the federal statute overbroad in that it could legitimately be 
 applied to legal  activities such as hunting or the inhumane treatment of livestock as well as 
to the dog fights Stevens filmed.38
 
In an illustration of the balance of powers concept, Congress and President Obama 
quickly approved new federal legislation designed to attack certain  animal cruelty videos 
while meeting constitutional requirements. The Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 
2010 bans the creation and distribution of obscene animal torture  videos. Those videos 
often depict women in high heels slowly crushing small animals,  images that appeal to 
certain sexual fetishists. By limiting the law to obscene crush videos, Congress and the 
president believe the statute will address the overbreadth problem while fitting the statute 
into the well-settled obscenity exception to the First Amendment’s speech protections.
 
The Bad Frog decision below examines the question of free speech protection for beer 
advertising.
Selling videos depicting 
 animal cruelty.
Bad Frog Brewery v. 
New York State 
Liquor Authority
134 F.3d 87 (2d Cir. 1998)
Bad Frog does not  dispute that the frog depicted in the label 
artwork is making the gesture generally known as “giving the 
finger” and that the gesture is widely regarded as an offensive 
insult, conveying a message that the company has character-
ized as “traditionally . . . negative and nasty.” Versions of the 
label feature slogans such as “He just don’t care,” “An amphib-
ian with an attitude,” “Turning bad into good,” and “The beer so 
good . . . it’s bad.” Another slogan, originally used but now 
 abandoned, was “He’s mean, green and  obscene.”
 
Bad Frog’s labels have been approved for use by the Federal 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and by authorities in 
Judge Newman
BACKGROUND
Bad Frog is a Michigan corporation that manufactures and mar-
kets several different types of alcoholic beverages under its 
“Bad Frog” trademark. This action concerns labels used by the 
company in the marketing of Bad Frog Beer, Bad Frog Lemon 
Lager, and Bad Frog Malt Liquor. Each  label prominently fea-
tures an artist’s rendering of a frog holding up its four-”fingered” 
right “hand,” with the back of the “hand” shown, the second 
“finger” extended, and the other three “fingers” slightly curled.

206  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
at least 15 states and the District of Columbia, but have been 
rejected by authorities in New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.
 
In May 1996, Bad Frog’s authorized New York distributor, 
Renaissance Beer Co., made an application to the New York 
State Liquor Authority (NYSLA) for brand label approval and 
registration. . . .
 
In September 1996, NYSLA denied Bad Frog’s application. . . . 
Explaining its rationale for the rejection, the Authority found that 
the label “encourages combative behavior” and that the gesture 
and the slogan, “He just don’t care,” placed close to and in larger 
type than a warning concerning potential health problems, 
foster a defiance to the health warning on the label, entice 
underage drinkers, and invite the public not to heed 
conventional wisdom and to disobey standards of decorum.
In addition, the Authority said that it 
considered that  approval of this label means that the label 
could appear in  grocery and convenience stores, with 
obvious exposure on the shelf to children of tender age 
and that it 
is sensitive to and has concern as to [the label’s] adverse 
effects on such a youthful audience.
Finally, the Authority said that it 
has considered that within the state of New York, the 
gesture of “giving the finger” to someone has the 
insulting meaning of “**k You,” or “Up Yours,” . . . a 
confrontational, obscene gesture, known to lead to 
fights, shootings, and homicides . . . concludes that the 
encouraged use of this gesture in licensed premises is 
akin to yelling “fire” in a crowded theater, . . . [and] finds 
that to approve this admittedly obscene, provocative 
confrontational gesture would not be conducive to 
proper regulation and control and would tend to 
adversely affect the health, safety, and welfare of the 
People of the State of New York.
 
Bad Frog filed the present action in October 1996 and 
sought a preliminary injunction barring NYSLA from taking any 
steps to prohibit the sale of beer by Bad Frog under the contro-
versial labels. The District Court denied the motion [and Bad 
Frog now appeals the District Court decision].
* * * * *
COMMERCIAL OR NONCOMMERCIAL SPEECH?
In Bad Frog’s view, the commercial speech that receives 
 reduced First Amendment protection is expression that  conveys 
commercial information. The frog labels, it contends, do not 
 purport to convey such information, but instead communicate 
only a “joke.” As such, the argument continues, the labels enjoy 
full First Amendment protection, rather than the somewhat 
 reduced protection accorded commercial speech.
* * * * *
 
NYSLA agrees with the District Court that the labels enjoy 
some First Amendment protection, but are to be assessed by the 
somewhat reduced standards applicable to commercial speech.
 
Bad Frog’s label attempts to function, like a trademark, to 
identify the source of the product. The picture on a beer bottle of 
a frog behaving badly is reasonably to be understood as 
 attempting to identify to consumers a product of the Bad Frog 
Brewery. In addition, the label serves to propose a commercial 
transaction. Though the label communicates no information be-
yond the source of the product, we think that minimal information, 
conveyed in the context of a proposal of a commercial transac-
tion, suffices to invoke the protections for commercial speech. . . .
 
Bad Frog contends that its labels deserve full First Amend-
ment protection because their proposal of a commercial 
transaction is combined with what is claimed to be political, or 
at least societal, commentary.
* * * * *
 
We are unpersuaded by Bad Frog’s attempt to separate the 
purported social commentary in the labels from the hawking of 
beer. Bad Frog’s labels meet the three criteria identified in Bolger 
[463 U.S. 60 (1983)]: the labels are a form of advertising, identify a 
specific product, and serve the economic interest of the speaker. 
Moreover, the purported noncommercial message is not so “in-
extricably intertwined” with the commercial speech as to require 
a finding that the entire label must be treated as “pure” speech.
* * * * *
 
We thus assess the prohibition of Bad Frog’s labels under 
the commercial speech standards outlined in Central Hudson 
[447 U.S. 557 (1980)].
THE CENTRAL HUDSON TEST
Central Hudson sets forth the analytical framework for 
 assessing governmental restrictions on commercial speech:
At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is 
protected by the First Amendment. For commercial speech 
to come within that provision, it at least must concern 
lawful activity and not be misleading. Next, we ask whether 
the asserted government interest is substantial. If both 
inquiries yield positive answers, we must determine 
whether the regulation directly advances the government 
interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than 
is necessary to serve that interest.
* * * * *

Chapter Five  Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights  207
A. Lawful Activity and Not Deceptive
We agree with the District Court that Bad Frog’s labels pass Cen-
tral Hudson’s threshold requirement that the speech “must con-
cern lawful activity and not be misleading.” The consumption of 
beer (at least by adults) is legal in New York, and the  labels can-
not be said to be deceptive, even if they are offensive.
B. Substantial State Interests
NYSLA advances two interests to support its asserted power 
to ban Bad Frog’s labels: (i) the State’s interest in “protecting 
children from vulgar and profane advertising,” and (ii) the 
State’s interest “in acting consistently to promote temper-
ance, i.e., the moderate and responsible use of alcohol among 
those above the legal drinking age and abstention among 
those below the legal drinking age.”
 
Both of the asserted interests are “substantial” within the 
meaning of Central Hudson. States have “a compelling interest in 
protecting the physical and psychological well-being of  minors,” 
and “[t]his interest extends to shielding minors from the influ-
ence of literature that is not obscene by adult standards.”
 
The Supreme Court also has recognized that states have 
a substantial interest in regulating alcohol consumption. We 
agree with the District Court that New York’s asserted con-
cern for “temperance” is also a substantial state interest.
C. Direct Advancement of the State Interest
To meet the “direct advancement” requirement, a state must 
demonstrate that “the harms it recites are real and that its 
 restriction will in fact alleviate them to a material degree” 
[Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U.S. 761, 771 (1993)].
 
(1) Advancing the interest in protecting children from 
vulgarity.
* * * * *
 
NYSLA endeavors to advance the state interest in preventing 
exposure of children to vulgar displays by taking only the limited 
step of barring such displays from the labels of alcoholic bever-
ages. In view of the wide currency of vulgar displays throughout 
contemporary society, including comic books targeted directly at 
children, barring such displays from labels for alcoholic bever-
ages cannot realistically be expected to reduce children’s 
 exposure to such displays to any significant degree.
* * * * *
 
(2) Advancing the state interest in temperance. We agree 
with the District Court that NYSLA has not established that its 
rejection of Bad Frog’s application directly advances the 
state’s interest in “temperance.”
 
NYSLA maintains that the raised finger gesture and the 
slogan “He just don’t care” urge consumers generally to defy 
authority and particularly to disregard the Surgeon General’s 
warning, which appears on the label next to the gesturing frog. 
NYSLA also contends that the frog appeals to youngsters and 
promotes underage drinking.
 
The truth of these propositions is not so self-evident as to 
relieve the state of the burden of marshalling some empirical 
evidence to support its assumptions. All that is clear is that the 
gesture of “giving the finger” is offensive. Whether viewing 
that gesture on a beer label will encourage disregard of health 
warnings or encourage underage drinking remain matters of 
speculation.
 
NYSLA has not shown that its denial of Bad Frog’s applica-
tion directly and materially advances either of its asserted 
state interests.
D. Narrow Tailoring
Central Hudson’s fourth criterion, sometimes referred to as “nar-
row tailoring,” requires consideration of whether the prohibition 
is more extensive than necessary to serve the asserted state in-
terest. Since NYSLA’s prohibition of Bad Frog’s labels has not 
been shown to make even an arguable advancement of the state 
interest in temperance, we consider here only whether the prohi-
bition is more extensive than necessary to serve the asserted in-
terest in insulating children from vulgarity.
* * * * *
 
In this case, Bad Frog has suggested numerous less intru-
sive alternatives to advance the asserted state interest in pro-
tecting children from vulgarity, short of a complete statewide 
ban on its labels. Appellant suggests “the restriction of adver-
tising to point-of-sale locations; limitations on billboard adver-
tising; restrictions on over-the-air advertising; and segregation 
of the product in the store.” Even if we were to assume that 
the state materially advances its asserted interest by shielding 
children from viewing the Bad Frog labels, it is plainly exces-
sive to prohibit the labels from all use, including placement on 
bottles displayed in bars and taverns where parental supervi-
sion of children is to be expected. Moreover, to whatever ex-
tent NYSLA is concerned that children will be harmfully 
exposed to the Bad Frog labels when wandering without pa-
rental supervision around grocery and convenience stores 
where beer is sold, that concern could be less intrusively dealt 
with by placing restrictions on the permissible locations where 
the appellant’s products may be displayed within such stores. 
Or, with the labels permitted, restrictions might be imposed on 
placement of the frog illustration on the outside of six-packs or 
cases sold in such stores.
 
NYSLA’s complete statewide ban on the use of Bad Frog’s 
labels lacks a “reasonable fit” with the state’s asserted  interest 
in shielding minors from vulgarity, and NYSLA gave inadequate 

208  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
consideration to alternatives to this blanket suppression of 
commercial speech.
* * * * *
 
[W]e conclude that NYSLA has unlawfully rejected Bad 
Frog’s application for approval of its labels.

Questions
1. a.  Why did the Court of Appeals conclude that the Bad 
Frog label constituted commercial speech?
 
b. What is the significance of that decision?
2. Why did the Court of Appeals rule in Bad Frog’s favor?
3. A letter to the Buffalo News objecting to the Bad Frog 
decision:
. . . The U.S. Court of Appeals’ reasoning was that

4. In online fantasy sports leagues, fans “draft” current 
professional players in baseball, football, etc. to create 
their own teams that then compete based on the actual 
performance of those players. A Missouri company, 
C.B.C. Distribution and Marketing, Inc., operated a for-
profit online league. In 2005, Major League Baseball 
changed its licensing policies and declined to allow 
C.B.C. a license to continue using the names and statis-
tics of major league baseball players. C.B.C. then sued 
claiming it had a First Amendment right to use the infor-
mation while M.L.B. argued that the information was 
protected by the intellectual property/publicity rights of 
the players. Decide the case. Explain. See C.B.C. Distri-

5. Two Rhode Island statutes prohibited all price advertising 
on liquor in the state, except for price tags and signs within 
a store itself which were not visible on the street. The state 
sought to reduce alcohol consumption. Two licensed liq-

ably contribute to reduced alcohol consumption?

The Fourth Amendment
Antoine Jones, a nightclub owner, was suspected of being associated with an illegal narcotics 
operation. Police lacked a valid warrant but nonetheless put a GPS tracker on Jones’s Jeep and 
followed his movements for four weeks. Jones was arrested in 2005 and in a 2008 trial a jury 
found him guilty of intent to distribute cocaine for which he was sentenced to life in prison. On 
appeal, Jones argued that his conviction should be overturned because the warrantless use of 
the GPS tracker violated his Fourth Amendment right to be protected from unreasonable search 
and seizure. His case reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which unanimously ruled that installing 
a GPS device is, indeed, a search in constitutional law terms.40 The Court did not resolve the 
question of whether a search warrant is required in such situations. Future decisions will ad-
dress that crucial question as the Court tries to achieve a coherent line of reasoning in applying 
the centuries-old Fourth Amendment to the complex new world of high technology.

Chapter Five  Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights  209
The Fourth Amendment provides that:
[T]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against 
unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but 
upon probable cause.
Drug-Sniffing Dog
The Miami-Dade Police Department received a tip that the residence of Joelis Jardines was 
being used to grow marijuana. A drug-sniffing dog was taken to the door of the home. The 
dog signaled the presence of marijuana, a search warrant was obtained, and a search dis-
covered marijuana growing in the house. Jardines was arrested. Did the use of the drug-
sniffing dog constitute an unconstitutional search? Explain. 
Source: Florida v. Jardines, 133 S. Ct. 1409 (2013).
The authorities are under great pressure to cope with America’s crime and terrorism prob-
lems. They must do so, however, within the confines of the Constitution, which is designed 
to protect us all—including criminals and terrorists—from the power of an unfair, over-
reaching government. Two crucial inquiries in search and seizure cases are whether a 
search has, in fact, occurred (as in the Jones and Jardines  cases) and whether the search 
violated the subject’s reasonable expectation of privacy (which is much more likely in 
one’s home than on the street, for example.)
 
Certainly, the most controversial dimension of Fourth Amendment interpretation is the 
exclusionary rule, which provides that, as a matter of due process, evidence secured in 
 violation of the Fourth Amendment may not be used against a defendant at trial. As 
 ultimately applied to all courts by the 1961 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Mapp v. 
Ohio,41 we can see that the exclusionary rule, while a very effective device for discourag-
ing illegal searches, seizures, and arrests, also from time to time has the effect of freeing 
guilty  criminals.
 
The Supreme Court restricted the exclusionary rule in 2006 holding that the govern-
ment need not forfeit evidence collected in constitutionally improper “no knock” 
searches.42 For many years, police conducting a search have been required to knock and 
announce themselves then wait a reasonable time to enter. Michigan police, in executing a 
search warrant, announced themselves but did not wait a reasonable time before entering 
and finding crack cocaine in Booker T. Hudson’s pockets. Hudson was convicted of drug 
violations, and his appeal eventually reached the U.S. Supreme 
Court where Justice  Antonin Scalia, writing the 5–4 opinion up-
holding Hudson’s conviction, expressed concern about guilty de-
fendants who have been allowed to go free  because of the 
exclusionary rule. He concluded that the social harm accompanying the knock and an-
nounce rule was too great as compared with the added privacy offered by the rule. Then in 
2009, the Court, in another 5–4 decision, further limited the exclusionary rule by finding 
that unlawful police conduct does not require the suppression of evidence if the miscon-
duct involved only “isolated negligence.”43

210  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
 
In general, a search warrant issued by a judge is necessary to comply with the Constitution 
in making a narcotics search. A warrantless search is permissible, however, where reasona-
ble, as in association with an arrest or where probable cause exists to believe a drug-related 
crime has been committed but circumstances make securing a warrant  impracticable.  Incident 
to an arrest, a search may lawfully include the person, a car, and the immediate vicinity of the 
 arrest. Furthermore, a police officer may lawfully secure drugs that have been abandoned or 
that are in plain view even though a warrant has not been obtained. Search/privacy problems 
pervade our lives:
1. Vehicle Searches. For nearly 30 years, police officers have commonly understood that 
lawfully arresting an occupant of a vehicle confers the right to search the passenger 
compartment of that vehicle. In a 2009 decision, Gant v. Arizona,44 the U.S. Supreme 
Court significantly diminished that authority by ruling that such searches are permissi-
ble in only two circumstances: 
 
a.  when the individual being arrested is close enough to the vehicle to reach in for a 
weapon or evidence and 
 
b.  when the officer can reasonably believe that the vehicle contains evidence relevant 
to the crime of arrest.
Thus, arrests for routine traffic stops ordinarily would not justify vehicle searches 
while such searches are more likely to be permissible incident to arrests for more seri-
ous crimes.45
2. Cell Phones. An Ohio woman, Wendy Thomas Northern, was hospitalized because 
of a drug overdose. During police questioning she agreed to call Antwaun Smith, 
whom she identified as the source of the drugs. Police arrested Smith, searched him 
and his cell phone, and discovered call records and numbers con-
firming that his phone had been used to talk with Northern. That 
evidence was used at trial against Smith, who argued that the cell 
phone search violated his Fourth Amendment rights. The Ohio 
Supreme Court agreed with Smith and ruled that the cell phone evidence should 
have been suppressed.46 Court decisions supporting cell phone searches have relied 
on well-settled Supreme Court decisions allowing police to conduct searches inci-
dent to lawful arrest. The arrestee’s person and immediate area of control including 
any closed containers in possession of the suspect may be examined by the police to 
ensure their safety and to prevent the destruction of evidence. The Ohio Supreme 
Court declined to treat Smith’s cell phone as a container. The California Supreme 
Court, however, ruled that an arrestee had no reasonable expectation of privacy in 
his cell phone as long as it was with him at the time of arrest.47 In 2014, the U.S. 
Supreme Court held that, unlike wallets or purses, cell phones could not be searched 
upon arrest without a warrant. Why?
3. Testing Students. In 1998, the school board in rural Tecumseh, Oklahoma, insti-
tuted a mandatory random urinalysis drug-testing program for all students participat-
ing in competitive extracurricular activities. The tests checked for illegal drugs but 
not for  alcohol. Test results were not turned over to the police. An honor student, 
Lindsay Earls, challenged the program as a violation of her Fourth Amendment 
rights. A U.S. Court of Appeals agreed with her, ruling that school officials needed 
Police searched him 
and his cell phone.

Chapter Five  Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights  211
to provide  evidence of an “identifiable drug abuse problem.”48 The U.S. Supreme 
Court, however, reversed that decision and held by a 5–4 margin that the school’s 
interest in addressing drug problems outweighed students’ pri-
vacy rights.49 The Court  reasoned that those participating in ex-
tracurricular  activities are subjected to many rules and restrictions 
that diminish their expectation of privacy, and the Court said the 
program is a health and safety measure rather than an assault on personal privacy. 
Some state supreme courts, however, have ruled that school drug testing violates 
state constitutional law,50  but even middle schools in at least eight states are now 
requiring drug testing for students participating in activities ranging from athletics to 
scrapbooking.51
4. Voyeurism and the Surveillance Society. In Washington State, Richard Sorrells and 
Sean Glas were found guilty of violating a state voyeurism statute for taking pictures up 
the skirts of some women who were working and shopping in a public mall. Both men 
appealed their convictions and won a 2002 decision because the voyeurism law did not 
apply, the Washington State Supreme Court unanimously ruled, to actions in public 
places.52 The women had no “reasonable expectation of privacy” in the shopping mall, 
so their privacy could not have been invaded. A federal law, the Video Voyeurism 
 Prevention Act (limited to federal jurisdiction/property), and a number of state laws 
have expanded protection against photographic voyeurism, but those laws may not meet 
constitutional requirements.
5. DNA Samples. Alonzo King was arrested in 2009 on an assault charge and, without 
first obtaining a search warrant, polic e swabbed the inside of his cheek for a DNA 
sample. Several months later his DNA was matched with a 2003 rape case. He was 
then convicted of that rape. He appealed his conviction arguing that he was a victim 
of an unreasonable search in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. Maryland 
law allowed the sampling in cases where the suspect had been arrested, but not yet 
convicted, of serious crimes including burglaries, rape, and murder. The U.S. 
 Supreme Court, in a 2013 ruling, upheld the conviction by a 5–4 vote saying that 
DNA collection is simply a part of the booking process, much like fingerprinting, 
and thus was a minimal intrusion on privacy.53 DNA testing is a valuable tool in 
prosecuting criminals and in exonerating the innocent, but DNA collection by the 
government of suspicionless persons who are presumed innocent at the time raises 
significant privacy issues. In the future, might DNA collection be extended to all 
arrests, or might the government misuse its vast DNA database, at least some of 
which will have been collected from people who are innocent? Over half of the 
states collect DNA upon arrest for serious crimes. [For an overview of privacy is-
sues, see http://epic.org/]

search those admitted to jail for minor violations? Explain. See Florence v. Board of 
Chosen Freeholders, 132 S.Ct. 1510 (2012).
2. Police stopped and arrested McFadden for riding a bicycle on a sidewalk in violation of 
New York City code. A search incident to the stop revealed a firearm. McFadden was 
later convicted of the crime of being in possession of a firearm as a previously con-
victed felon. McFadden appealed, claiming the search was unconstitutional. Was he 
correct? Explain. See United States v. McFadden, 238 F.3d 198 (2001); cert. den. 122 
S.Ct. 223 (2001).
3. a.  Can the police lawfully search an individual’s garbage once it has been placed at the 
curb for disposal? A Connecticut resident, Paul DeFusco, was convicted of drug 
 trafficking based on evidence found in his home. The police conducted the home 
search with a warrant secured on the basis of an informant’s information as well as 
evidence (some short cut straws, glassine baggies, and prescription bottles) turned 
up in sifting through DeFusco’s garbage.
b. Explain the central issue in this case. See State of Connecticut v. Paul DeFusco, 
620 A.2d 746 (Conn. S.Ct. 1993).
4. Tucson, Arizona, police, cruising in an area associated with the Crips street gang, 
stopped a car because its insurance coverage had been suspended. Johnson, a backseat 
passenger, was wearing the blue colors associated with the Crips and Officer Trevizo 
saw that Johnson had a police scanner in his pocket. Trevizo questioned Johnson learn-
ing that he was from a town frequented by the Crips gang, that he had recently been in 
prison and that he had no identification with him. Trevizo asked Johnson to exit the car. 
He did so. Trevizo conducted a pat-down search, and she felt a gun. Johnson struggled 
but he was arrested, and a further search revealed marijuana. Johnson was charged with 
unlawful possession of a gun, possession of marijuana, and resisting arrest. In court, 
Johnson challenged the legality of the search saying it had nothing to do with the traffic 
stop. Did the pat-down violate the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable 
searches and seizures? Explain. See Arizona v. Johnson, 555 U.S. 323 (2009).
Business Searches
Government tries to protect us from business hazards including pollution, defective 
 products, and unsafe workplaces as well as business crimes such as fraud and bribery. To 
do so, government agents often want to enter company buildings, observe working condi-
tions, and examine company books. We know our homes are generally protected from 
searches in the absence of a warrant. Excepting urgent circumstances such as terrorism 
concerns, can the same be said for a place of business? The Supreme Court has answered 
that question:
The Warrant Clause of the Fourth Amendment protects commercial buildings as well as 
 private homes. To hold otherwise would belie the origin of that Amendment, and the 
 American colonial experience. . . . “[T]he Fourth Amendment’s commands grew in large 
measure out of the colonists’ experience with the writs of assistance . . . [that] granted 
sweeping power to customs officials and other agents of the king to search at large for smuggled 
goods.” Against this background, it is untenable that the ban on warrantless searches was not 
intended to shield places of business as well as of residence.54

Chapter Five  Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights  213
Federal Government closed the Naval Undersea  Warfare Center, 
which had been located in the Fort Trumbull area of the City and 
had employed over 1,500 people. In 1998 the City’s unemploy-
ment rate was nearly double that of the State, and its population 
of just under 24,000 residents was at its lowest since 1920.
 
These conditions prompted state and local officials to tar-
get New London, and particularly its Fort Trumbull area, for 
economic revitalization. To this end, respondent New London 
Development Corporation (NLDC), a private nonprofit entity 
established some years earlier to assist the City in planning 
economic development, was reactivated. In January 1998 the 
State authorized a $5.35 million bond issue to support the 
NLDC’s planning activities and a $10 million bond issue toward 
the creation of a Fort Trumbull State Park. In February the 
pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. announced that it would 
build a $300 million research facility on a site immediately 
 adjacent to Fort Trumbull; local planners hoped that Pfizer 
would draw new business to the area. Upon obtaining state-
level approval, the NLDC finalized an integrated development 
plan focused on 90 acres of the Fort Trumbull area.
Justice Stevens
In 2000 the city of New London approved a development plan 
that, in the words of the Supreme Court of Connecticut, was 
“projected to create in excess of 1,000 jobs, to increase tax and 
other revenues, and to revitalize an economically  distressed 
city, including its downtown and waterfront areas” (843 A.2d 
500, 507 [2004]). In assembling the land needed for this project, 
the city’s development agent has purchased  property from will-
ing sellers and proposes to use the power of eminent domain to 
acquire the remainder of the property from unwilling owners in 
exchange for just compensation. The question presented is 
whether the city’s proposed disposition of this property quali-
fies as a “public use” within the meaning of the Takings Clause 
of the Fifth Amendment to the  Constitution.
I
The city of New London (hereinafter City) sits at the junction of 
the Thames River and the Long Island Sound in southeastern 
Connecticut. Decades of economic decline led a state agency in 
1990 to designate the City a “distressed municipality.” In 1996 the

The Fifth Amendment
Takings—Eminent Domain
The Fifth Amendment prohibits the taking of private property for public use without just 
compensation for the owner. In cases where owners do not want to sell, governments often 
use the power of eminent domain to take private property for public uses such as building 
highways, bike trails, and parks, while providing just compensation. But what about the 
situation where the condemned property is to be used for a private purpose? Communities 
across America, hungry for an improved tax base and more jobs, have made the practice 
routine, but are they violating the Fifth Amendment rights of the property owners? The 
following 5–4 Supreme Court decision involves a challenge to a New London, Connecti-
cut, plan to clear a portion of the city to make way for a private-sector office/research park 
along with a waterfront hotel, conference center, residences, a marina, and a river walk. 
Small businesses and residences were to make room for bigger, more successful private 
ventures providing a stronger tax base for New London.

 
The Fort Trumbull area is situated on a peninsula that juts into 
the Thames River. The area comprises approximately 115 pri-
vately owned properties, as well as the 32 acres of land formerly 
occupied by the naval facility (Trumbull State Park now occupies 
18 of those 32 acres). The development plan encompasses seven 
parcels. Parcel 1 is designated for a waterfront conference hotel 
at the center of a “small urban village” that will include restau-
rants and shopping. . . .  Parcel 2 will be the site of approximately 
80 new residences organized into an urban neighborhood and 
linked by public walkway to the  remainder of the development, 
including the state park. This parcel also includes space reserved 
for a new U.S. Coast Guard Museum. Parcel 3, which is located 
immediately north of the Pfizer facility, will contain at least 
90,000 square feet of research and development office space. 
 Parcel 4A is a  2.4-acre site that will be used either to support the 
adjacent state park, by providing parking or retail services for 
visitors, or to support the nearby marina. Parcel 4B will  include a 
renovated marina, as well as the final stretch of the riverwalk. 
Parcels 5, 6, and 7 will provide land for  office and retail space, 
parking, and water-dependent commercial uses.
* * * * *
 
The city council approved the plan in January 2000 and 
designated the NLDC as its development agent in charge of 
implementation. The city council also authorized the NLDC to 
purchase property or to acquire property by exercising emi-
nent domain in the City’s name. The NLDC successfully negoti-
ated the purchase of most of the real estate in the 90-acre 
area, but its negotiations with petitioners failed. As a conse-
quence, in November 2000 the NLDC initiated the condemna-
tion proceedings that gave rise to this case.
II
Petitioner Susette Kelo has lived in the Fort Trumbull area since 
1997. She has made extensive improvements to her house, 
which she prizes for its water view. Petitioner  Wilhelmina Dery 
was born in her Fort Trumbull house in 1918 and has lived there 
her entire life. Her husband Charles has lived in the house 
since they married some 60 years ago. In all, the nine petition-
ers own 15 properties in Fort Trumbull. . . . There is no allega-
tion that any of these properties is blighted or otherwise in poor 
condition; rather, they were condemned only  because they 
happen to be located in the development area.
 
In December 2000 petitioners brought this action in the 
New London Superior Court. They claimed, among other things, 
that the taking of their properties would violate the “public use” 
restriction in the Fifth Amendment. After a seven-day bench 
trial, the Superior Court granted a permanent  restraining order 
prohibiting the taking of the properties  located in parcel 4A 
(park or marina support). It, however,  denied petitioners relief 
as to the properties located in parcel 3 (office space).
 
After the Superior Court ruled, both sides took appeals to 
the Supreme Court of Connecticut. That court held that all of 
the City’s proposed takings were valid.
* * * * *
III
Two polar propositions are perfectly clear. On the one hand, it 
has long been accepted that the sovereign may not take the 
property of A for the sole purpose of transferring it to  another 
private party B, even though A is paid just compensation. On 
the other hand, it is equally clear that a State may transfer 
property from one private party to another if future “use by the 
public” is the purpose of the taking; the condemnation of land 
for a railroad is a familiar example. Neither of these proposi-
tions, however, determines the disposition of this case.
 
As for the first proposition, the City would no doubt be forbid-
den from taking petitioners’ land for the purpose of conferring a 
private benefit on a particular party. Nor would the City be al-
lowed to take property under the mere pretext of a public pur-
pose, when its actual purpose was to bestow a private benefit. 
The takings before us, however, would be executed pursuant to 
a “carefully considered” development plan. The trial judge and 
all the members of the Supreme Court of Connecticut agreed that 
there was no evidence of an illegitimate purpose in this case.
* * * * *
 
On the other hand, this is not a case in which the City is plan-
ning to open the condemned land—at least not in its entirety—
to use by the general public. Nor will the private lessees of the 
land in any sense be required to operate like common carriers, 
making their services available to all comers. But although such 
a projected use would be sufficient to satisfy the public use re-
quirement, this “Court long ago rejected any literal requirement 
that condemned property be put into use for the general public.” 
Indeed, while many state courts in the mid-19th century en-
dorsed “use by the public” as the proper definition of public use, 
that narrow view steadily eroded over time. Not only was the 
“use by the public” test difficult to administer (e.g., what propor-
tion of the public need have access to the property? at what 
price?), but it proved to be impractical given the diverse and al-
ways evolving needs of society. Accordingly, when this Court 
began applying the Fifth Amendment to the States at the close 
of the 19th century, it embraced the broader and more natural 
interpretation of public use as “public purpose.”
* * * * *
 
The disposition of this case therefore turns on the question 
whether the City’s development plan serves a “public pur-
pose.” Without exception, our cases have defined that con-
cept broadly, reflecting our long-standing policy of deference 
to legislative judgments in this field.
214  Unit Two  Introduction to Law

 
In Berman v. Parker, this Court upheld a redevelopment 
plan targeting a blighted area of Washington, D.C., in which 
most of the housing for the area’s 5,000 inhabitants was 
 beyond repair. Under the plan, the area would be condemned 
and part of it utilized for the construction of streets, schools, 
and other public facilities. The remainder of the land would be 
leased or sold to private parties for the purpose of redevelop-
ment, including the construction of low-cost housing.
* * * * *
IV
Those who govern the City were not confronted with the need to 
remove blight in the Fort Trumbull area, but their determination 
that the area was sufficiently distressed to justify a program of 
economic rejuvenation is entitled to our deference. The City has 
carefully formulated an economic development plan that it be-
lieves will provide appreciable benefits to the community, 
 including—but by no means limited to—new jobs and increased 
tax revenue. . . . Given the comprehensive character of the plan, 
the thorough deliberation that preceded its adoption, and the 
limited scope of our review, it is appropriate for us to resolve the 
challenges of the individual owners, not on a piecemeal basis, 
but rather in light of the entire plan. Because that plan unques-
tionably serves a public purpose, the takings challenged here 
satisfy the public use requirement of the Fifth amendment.
 
To avoid this result, petitioners urge us to adopt a new 
bright-line rule that economic development does not qualify as 
a public use. Putting aside the unpersuasive suggestion that 
the City’s plan will provide only purely economic benefits, nei-
ther precedent nor logic supports petitioners’ proposal. Pro-
moting economic development is a traditional and long 
accepted function of government.
* * * * *
 
In affirming the City’s authority to take petitioners’ proper-
ties, we do not minimize the hardship that condemnations may 
entail, notwithstanding the payment of just compensation. We 
emphasize that nothing in our opinion precludes any State 
from placing further restrictions on its exercise of the takings 
power. Indeed, many States already impose “public use” 
requirements that are stricter than the federal baseline.

Affirmed.
AFTERWORD—PROPERTY RIGHTS REVOLUTION?
The Kelo decision was an angry disappointment for property 
rights advocates. A government taking of Americans’ long-time 
homes, even for just compensation, is a powerful and frighten-
ing image. Susette Kelo eventually settled with New London, 
vacated her home and received $442,000. Her “little pink house” 
was disassembled and moved to another lot where it stands as 
something of a national symbol for property rights.
 
Clearly, however, governments need, and have long exer-
cised, substantial authority to take property for economic de-
velopment. Of course, government planning sometimes does 
not work out as expected, and the Pfizer development appears 
to be one of those failures. In 2009, Pfizer announced it was 
abandoning the Fort Trumbull office complex as a cost-saving 
measure. Fourteen hundred jobs were departing. The hotels, 
stores, and condominiums planned for the lots taken from Kelo 
and her neighbors have yet to materialize.
 
Kelo produced one of the angriest backlashes to any 
 Supreme Court decision in history. At least 44 states have 
passed legislation or amended their constitutions to limit 
eminent domain, but the effectiveness of those measures is 
unclear. Some of them still allow takings involving “blighted” 
property, an exception readily subject to abuse, from the 
critics’ point of view. [For property rights analysis and up-
dates and more on the Kelo story, see www.ij.org]

4. Marilyn and James Nollan applied for a permit to replace 
their beachfront home with a larger structure. The California

between the public beaches that lay on both sides of the

authorities took the car she jointly owned with her hus-
band after police arrested him for receiving oral sex from a 
prostitute while parked in the car. A 1925 anti nuisance law 
permitted the seizure, but Tina Bennis claimed it amounted 
to an unconstitutional taking because she was an innocent 
half owner of the 1977 Pontiac for which the couple had 
paid $600. Bennis’s claim eventually reached the U.S. Su-

Chapter Five  Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights  215

216  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Takings—Regulatory
We have seen how the law treats situations where the government uses its power of 
 eminent domain to condemn property for either public or private use and pays just com-
pensation. What happens when the government does not take the property but rather regu-
lates it in a manner that deprives that property of some or all of its economic usefulness? 
For example, without providing just compensation, can a state lawfully limit the amount a 
landlord can charge for rent in an effort to preserve low-income housing? Can the state 
forbid billboards in order to enhance roadside beauty?
 
These regulatory takings, whether temporary or permanent, normally do not require 
government compensation because doing so would severely impair the state’s ability to 
govern in an orderly manner. Nonetheless, in recent years the courts have been more 
 aggressive about requiring just compensation for some regulatory takings. Three broad 
classes of such takings have emerged in court decisions.
1. Total Takings. If a governmental body acts in a way that permanently takes all of 
the economic value of a property or permanently physically invades the property, the tak-
ing  requires just compensation unless the government is (1) preventing a nuisance or 
(2) the regulation was permissible under property law at the time of 
the purchase of the property. When the South Carolina Coastal 
Commission passed erosion rules having the effect of  preventing 
David Lucas from building any permanent structure on his $975,000 
beachfront lots, Lucas sued, claiming a Fifth Amendment violation. 
The U.S. Supreme Court agreed with Lucas and held that a taking 
requiring just compensation had occurred  because the state had de-
prived Lucas of all economically beneficial use of the property, and 
the property did not fall in one of the two exceptions.55
2. Exaction/Mitigation. A second class of regulatory takings 
involves situations where the government allows land development only if the owner ded-
icates some property interest (called an exaction) or money (called a mitigation or impact 
fee) to the government. Thus if you are developing land for housing, the city government 
might require that you devote a portion of that land to parks or pay a fee to help with com-
munity recreation needs. The Supreme Court dealt with just such a case in Dolan v. 
 Tigard.56 Florence  Dolan, owner of a plumbing and electrical supply store in Tigard, 
 Oregon, applied for a city permit to nearly double the size of her store and to pave her 
parking lot. Concerned with increased traffic and water runoff due to the proposed expan-
sion, the city granted the permit, subject to a pair of conditions: (1) Dolan was to dedicate 
the portion of her property that lay within the 100-year floodplain to the city to improve 
drainage for the creek that ran along her property, and (2) she was to dedicate an additional 
15-foot strip of her land adjacent to the floodplain for use as a bicycle path/walkway to 
relieve traffic congestion. Dolan sued and eventually the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that 
government can compel a dedication of private property to public use where it can estab-
lish two  factors: (1) A nexus or relationship  between the government’s legitimate purpose 
(flood and traffic control in Dolan) and the condition imposed (the land Dolan was to 
dedicate to public purposes) and (2) a “rough proportionality” between the burden imposed 
(the land given over to public use) and the impact of the development (increased water

runoff and increased  traffic).57 The Supreme Court ruled that Tigard had failed to meet 
those standards, and Dolan won the case.
A 2013 U.S. Supreme Court decision stretched the Dolan reasoning and strengthened 
property rights. Coy Koontz, Sr., wanted to build on his wetlands property, but the local 
water management district, consistent with Florida law, denied permission. Koontz was 
unwilling to either turn over part of his property for public purposes or pay for improve-
ments on other public land as a way of “offsetting” the environmental damage that would 
have accompanied the development. Koontz sued. The Court, by a 5–4 vote, said the water 
management district’s requirements constituted a taking and were subject to Dolan.58
3. Partial Takings. Government may take part of a piece of property in order to expand a 
road, install a bike path, or establish a buffer zone, for example. These are neither total takings 
nor exactions, but rather fall into a case-by-case analysis that, very briefly, considers the impor-
tance of the government’s goals and the extent of the burden on the property owner.
Zoning in the Sixth Century
Government restraints on property development are not merely a modern imposition, as 
we learn from the following description of a zoning law in the Byzantine Empire:
Next came the first zoning law for the beach. Coastal vistas were so cherished, and 
the competition for them so keen, that by the sixth century the Emperor Justinian 
the Great was compelled to pass an ordinance barring construction within 100 feet 
of the shore to protect sea views.

The 14th Amendment
Due Process
The Due Process Clauses of both the Fifth Amendment (applying to the federal govern-
ment) and the 14th Amendment (applying to the states) forbid the government to deprive 
citizens of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.
Substantive Due Process
Laws that arbitrarily and unfairly infringe on fundamental personal rights and liberties 
such as privacy, voting, and the various freedoms specified in the Bill of Rights may be 
challenged on due process grounds. Basically, the purpose of the law must be so com-
pelling as to outweigh the intrusion on personal liberty or the law will be struck down. 
For example, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a Connecticut statute forbidding the 
use of contraceptives violated the constitutional right to privacy (although the word 
privacy  itself does not appear in the U.S. Constitution).59 By judicial interpretation, the 
14th Amendment Due Process Clause “absorbs” the fundamental liberties of the federal 

218  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Constitution and prohibits state laws (in this case, the Connecticut contraceptive ban) 
that abridge those fundamental liberties such as privacy.
Procedural Due Process
Basically, procedural due process means that the government must provide a fair procedure 
including notice and a fair hearing before taking an action affecting a citizen’s life, liberty, 
or property. A fair hearing might require, among others, the right to present evidence, the 
right to a decision maker free of bias, and the right to appeal. The precise nature of proce-
dural due process depends, however, on the situation. A murder trial requires meticulous 
attention to procedural fairness; an administrative hearing to appeal a housing officer’s de-
cision to banish a student from a dormitory, while required to meet minimal constitutional 
standards, can be more forgiving in its procedural niceties.
Due Process: Void for Vagueness
A statute may violate due process rights if it is so vaguely written that the ordinary person 
cannot understand it. The Skilling case that follows involves a void for vagueness claim 
arising from the infamous Enron fraud scandal that caused the former Houston, Texas, 
 energy giant—then the seventh largest company in America—to  collapse into bankruptcy 
in 2001. Enron founder Ken Lay (now deceased), chief executive  officer Jeffrey Skilling, 
and chief accounting officer, Richard  Causey, were among those indicted for various 
crimes in  association with Enron’s spectacular rise from its founding in 1985 to its collapse 
fewer than 20 years later. Among other  alleged wrongs, Skilling 
was convicted of depriving the corporation and the public of his 
“honest services” by deceiving the investors about Enron’s finances. 
Skilling allegedly pumped up Enron’s share prices by failing to re-
veal the company’s true financial condition. His appeal reached the  Supreme Court in 
2010 where he claimed that pretrial publicity and Enron’s  financial damage to Houston 
poisoned the jury pool and denied him his Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial 
jury. That claim was rejected by the Supreme Court, but Skilling also argued that the lan-
guage of the “honest services” federal statute used to convict him was so vague that he was 
deprived of his due process rights.
Skilling allegedly pumped 
up Enron’s share prices.

Enacted in 1872, the original mail-fraud provision, the predecessor 
of the modern-day mail- and wire-fraud laws, proscribed, without 
further elaboration, use of the mails to advance “any scheme or 
artifice to defraud.” See McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 
356, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987). In 1909, Congress 
amended the statute to prohibit, as it does today, “any scheme or 
artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of 
false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.” 
Section 1341 (emphasis added); Emphasizing Congress’ 
 disjunctive phrasing, the Courts of Appeals, one after the 
other, interpreted the term “scheme or artifice to defraud” to 
include deprivations not only of money or property, but also of 
 intangible rights.
* * * * *
2
In 1987, this Court, in McNally v. United States, stopped the 
 development of the intangible-rights doctrine in its tracks. 
 McNally involved a state officer who, in selecting Kentucky’s 
insurance agent, arranged to procure a share of the agent’s 
commissions via kickbacks paid to companies the official 
 partially controlled. The prosecutor did not charge that, “in the 
absence of the alleged scheme[,] the Commonwealth would 
have paid a lower premium or secured better insurance.” 
 Instead, the prosecutor maintained that the kickback scheme 
“defraud[ed] the citizens and government of Kentucky of their 
right to have the Commonwealth’s affairs conducted  honestly.”
 
We held that the scheme did not qualify as mail fraud. “Rather 
than constru[ing] the statute in a manner that leaves its outer 
boundaries ambiguous and involves the Federal  Government in 
setting standards of disclosure and good  government for local 
and state officials,” we read the statute “as limited in scope to the 
protection of property rights.” “If Congress desires to go further,” 
we stated, “it must speak more clearly.”
3
Congress responded swiftly. The following year, it enacted a 
new statute “specifically to cover one of the ‘intangible rights’ 
that lower courts had protected . . . prior to McNally: ‘the 
 intangible right of honest services.’” In full, the honest-services 
statute stated:
For the purposes of th[e] chapter [of the United States Code 
that prohibits, inter alia, mail fraud, Section 1341, and wire 
fraud, Section 1343], the term “scheme or artifice to 
defraud” includes a scheme or artifice to deprive another of 
the intangible right of honest services.
B
Congress, Skilling charges, reacted quickly but not clearly: He as-
serts that Section 1346 is unconstitutionally vague. To satisfy due 
process, “a penal statute [must] define the criminal offense 
[1] with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can under-
stand what conduct is prohibited and [2] in a manner that does not 
encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”  Kolender v. 
Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983). The 
void-for-vagueness doctrine embraces these  requirements.
 
According to Skilling, Section 1346 meets neither of the two 
due process essentials. First, the phrase “the intangible right of 
honest services,” he contends, does not adequately define 
what behavior it bars. Second, he alleges, Section 1346’s 
“standardless sweep allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries 
to pursue their personal predilections,” thereby “facilitat[ing] 
opportunistic and arbitrary prosecutions.”
 
In urging invalidation of Section 1346, Skilling swims against 
our case law’s current, which requires us, if we can, to construe, 
not condemn, Congress’ enactments.
* * * * *
 
There is no doubt that Congress intended Section 1346 to 
refer to and incorporate the honest-services doctrine recog-
nized in Court of Appeals’ decisions before McNally derailed 
the intangible-rights theory of fraud. . . . Congress enacted 
Section 1346 on the heels of McNally and drafted the statute 
using that decision’s terminology.
* * * * *
 
Satisfied that Congress, by enacting Section 1346, “meant to 
reinstate the body of pre-McNally honest-services law,” we 
have surveyed that case law. In parsing the Courts of Appeals 
decisions, we acknowledge that Skilling’s vagueness challenge 
has force, for honest-services decisions preceding McNally 
were not models of clarity or consistency.
* * * * *
 
Although some applications of the pre-McNally honest-
services doctrine occasioned disagreement among the Courts 
of Appeals, these cases do not cloud the doctrine’s solid core: 
The “vast majority” of the honest-services cases involved of-
fenders who, in violation of a fiduciary duty, participated in 
bribery or kickback schemes.
* * * * *
 
In view of this history, there is no doubt that Congress  intended 
Section 1346 to reach at least bribes and kickbacks.  Reading the 
statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct, we ac-
knowledge, would raise the due process  concerns underlying the 
vagueness doctrine. To preserve the statute without transgressing 
constitutional limitations, we now hold that Section 1346 criminal-
izes only the bribe-and-kickback core of the pre-McNally case law.
* * * * *

 
Interpreted to encompass only bribery and kickback 
schemes, Section 1346 is not unconstitutionally vague. Recall that 
the void-for-vagueness doctrine addresses concerns about 
(1) fair notice and (2) arbitrary and discriminatory prosecutions. . . .
 
As to fair notice, “whatever the school of thought concern-
ing the scope and meaning of” Section 1346, it has always been 
“as plain as a pikestaff that” bribes and kickbacks constitute 
honest-services fraud, Williams v. United States, 341 U.S. 97, 
101, 71 S.Ct. 576, 95 L.Ed. 774 (1951). . . .
 
As to arbitrary prosecutions, we perceive no significant risk 
that the honest-services statute, as we interpret it today, will be 
stretched out of shape. Its prohibition on bribes and kickbacks 
draws content not only from the pre-McNally case law, but also 
from federal statutes proscribing—and defining—similar crimes.
* * * * *
C
It remains to determine whether Skilling’s conduct violated 
Section 1346. Skilling’s honest-services prosecution, the 
 Government concedes, was not “prototypical.” The Government 
charged Skilling with conspiring to defraud Enron’s shareholders 
by misrepresenting the company’s fiscal health, thereby artifi-
cially inflating its stock price. It was the Government’s theory 
at trial that Skilling “profited from the fraudulent scheme . . . 
through the receipt of salary and bonuses, . . . and through the 
sale of approximately $200 million in Enron stock, which netted 
him $89 million.”
 
The Government did not, at any time, allege that Skilling solic-
ited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for 
making these misrepresentations. (“[T]he indictment does not 
 allege, and the government’s evidence did not show, that 
[Skilling] engaged in bribery.”) It is therefore clear that, as we 
read Section 1346, Skilling did not commit honest-services fraud.

Affirmed in part. Vacated in part. Remanded.
AFTERWORD
The Supreme Court returned Skilling’s case to the federal Fifth 
Circuit Court of Appeals where, in 2011, the Skilling saga ap-
peared to be nearing its conclusion. The Fifth Circuit upheld 
Skilling’s conviction finding the honest services error was 
“harmless” in that ample evidence unrelated to the honest 
services charge supported Skilling’s conviction on 19 counts 
of securities fraud, conspiracy, insider trading and making 
false representations.60 At this w riting, Skilling is serving his 
sentence in a Colorado prison, but an agreement was reached 
to reduce his 24-year sentence by 10 years because of a mis-
take in interpreting the federal sentencing guidelines. Skilling 
also agreed to give up about $42 million, all of which will go to 
Enron fraud victims. The case now seems to be at an end, and 
Skilling may depart prison as early as 2017.61
Questions
1. Why did the Court conclude that Skilling did not commit 
honest-services fraud?
2. Why did the Court conclude that the honest services stat-
ute was unconstitutional?
3. How did the Court correct the unconstitutional infirmity in 
the honest-services statute?
Equal Protection
The 14th Amendment provides that no state shall “deny to any person within its 
 jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” The Due Process Clause of the Fifth 
Amendment has been interpreted to provide that same protection against the power of 
the federal government. Fundamentally, these laws forbid a government from treating 
one person (including a corporation) differently from another without a rational basis for 
doing so. Most notably, the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses have played an 
enormous role in attacking discrimination (see Chapter 13), but they can also signifi-
cantly influence routine business practice in many ways. For example, can we lawfully 
impose higher taxes on a gambling casino than we impose on the sale of groceries? Or 
can we require the oil industry to follow more rigorous environmental standards than we 
expect of coal mines? In general, the answer to these questions is yes, but only if the 
legislation can pass the rational basis test. If not, such legislation would be unconstitu-
tional and unenforceable.

Same-Sex Marriage: Equal Rights? 
Edie Windsor, an 83-year-old lesbian, struck an historic but not 
yet definitive blow for gay and lesbian rights when she success-
fully sued the U.S. government to strike down Section 3 of the 
federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Windsor sued be-
cause the government, consistent with DOMA, did not recognize 
her 2007 marriage to Thea Spyer, her long-time partner, who died in 2009. The couple 
had lived together for 40 years in New York City prior to their marriage in Canada. 
New York accepted their marriage, but Section 3 of the 1996 DOMA forbids the fed-
eral government from recognizing same-sex marriage for the purposes of federal laws 
and programs. Consequently, the Internal Revenue Service required Windsor to pay 
$363,053 in taxes on the estate Spyer had left to her. Windsor claimed the federal es-
tate tax exemption for surviving spouses, but because DOMA disallowed recognition 
of the marriage the  federal exemption was not available to Windsor.
 
Windsor’s challenge succeeded when the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013 ruled that Sec-
tion 3 of DOMA was unconstitutional as a denial of equal protection and due process.62 
The Court’s constitutional law reasoning in the case was somewhat undeveloped, but ele-
ments of federalism (the states’ traditional role in regulating marriage versus broad federal 
authority—see Chapter 8 for more about federalism), equal protection (DOMA causes 
some state-sanctioned marriages to be treated differently from others) and substantive due 
process (the statute denies respect and dignity to same-sex married couples) were all 
noted.63 Justice Kennedy, writing for the five-person majority, said that DOMA treated 
same-sex marriages as “second class,” a denial of equal protection.
Edie Windsor struck an 
 historic blow for gay and 
 lesbian rights.

222  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
 
On the same day as the Windsor ruling, the Supreme Court in Hollingsworth v. 
Perry effectively allowed the resumption of same-sex marriages in California.64 Vot-
ers in that state had approved Proposition 8, a ballot initiative prohibiting same-sex 
marriage that was subsequently ruled unconstitutional (on due process and equal pro-
tection grounds) in lower federal court decisions. Proposition 8 proponents took their 
case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled that those proponents did not suffer direct 
injury from Proposition 8 and therefore did not have standing (see Chapter 4) to sue in 
federal court. The Supreme Court dismissed the case and same-sex marriage is ex-
pected to resume in California.
 
Responding to the two same-day decisions, superstar lawyer David Boies said, “Today 
the United States Supreme Court . . . brings us that much closer to true equality.”65 He 
went on to say, “Everything the Supreme Court said in the Defense 
of Marriage opinion ( Windsor) . . . demonstrates that when that case 
finally does come to the Supreme Court on the merits, marriage 
equality will be the law throughout this land.”66 
 
Whether marriage equality is in the offing remains to be seen, but Windsor is having an 
immediate impact. At a practical level, federal marriage benefits under more than 1,000 
federal laws will now be available to same-sex couples who were legally married in states 
recognizing same-sex marriage. Those benefits affect health care, Social Security, hospital 
visitation rights, taxes, immigration, and much more. Sixteen states and the District of 
Columbia permit same-sex marriages, but 33 states forbid them. Lawsuits will be filed 
and, at some point, the Supreme Court presumably will directly address the marriage 
equality question. Public support for same-sex marriage has shifted very rapidly with 
50 percent of Americans favoring those marriages in 2013 whereas only 39 percent sup-
ported them just five years earlier in 2008.67
 
Although the Windsor decision struck down Section 3 of DOMA, it did not address 
Section 2, which allows states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed in 
other states. What happens then to those same-sex couples who are lawfully married 
but who subsequently move to a state that does not recognize their union? Some fed-
eral benefits, such as student aid, are extended according to the law of the place of 
marriage whereas conferral of other benefits, such as Social Security, looks to the law 
of the state of residence.68 Much remains to be litigated. At this writing, for example, 
three same-sex couples—two of whom are unmarried and were denied marriage 
 licenses and one lawfully married in Iowa—are suing in Utah claiming that the state’s 
constitutional amendment 3, defining marriage as a union exclusively between a man 
and a woman, is an unconstitutional denial of equal protection and due process of law. 
In response, Utah’s lawyers said the state has a sovereign right to define and regulate 
marriage. Utah points out that state law does not prevent same-sex marriage, but it 
does prevent those unions from being recognized by the state.69 Many cases of this 
kind are expected around the country as the legal system works its way toward 
 addressing the larger question of whether same-sex marriage prohibitions are 
 impermissible under the U.S. Constitution or whether that question resides with the 
states under federalism principles. That is, which level of government should decide if 
 same-sex couples can be married? Traditionally, the states have done so, but is 
 marriage such a fundamental institution that the federal Constitution’s equal protec-
tion and due process provisions must be invoked?
Marriage equality will be the 
law throughout this land.

Chapter Five  Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights  223
At this writing in 2013, about 94 million Americans (nearly one-
third of the population) live in states that allow same-sex mar-
riage.70 Worldwide about 585 million people (about 8  percent 
of the global population) live in countries where same-sex 
marriage is lawful.71 Those numbers represent extraordinarily 
rapid changes in American and global views of gay and 
 lesbian marriage, but the debate is far from settled.
 
Morally and ethically speaking, which side is “right” 
about same-sex marriage? How do we decide? Consider 
some questions that help us sort through this moral thicket:
1. What issues should one consider in deciding whether 
gay and lesbian marriages are morally defensible?
2. Is a civil union arrangement an acceptable “middle 
ground?
3. If the American people ultimately favor gay and lesbian 
marriage, could we then consider a morally defensible 
practice?
4. Are children at moral risk if raised by same-sex cou-
ples?
5. If scholarly studies ultimately demonstrate that homo-
sexuality and lesbianism are substantially commanded 
by genetic characteristics, would we be morally 
 required to permit same-sex marriage?

Same-Sex Marriage: How Do You Feel?
Stop-and-Frisk
The New York City police department practices a “stop-and-frisk” policy by which a  police 
officer can stop and question those whom the officer reasonably believes to have committed, 
be committing, or be about to commit a felony or serious misdemeanor. Those stopped can be 
frisked for weapons if the officer reasonably believes he or she is in danger of physical injury.
 
The stop-and-frisk police practice is constitutionally permissible if conducted properly, but 
in a 2013 class-action lawsuit, Floyd v. City of New York, federal district court judge Shira 
Scheindlin ruled that stop-and-frisk, as practiced in recent years in New York City, is an imper-
missible violation of citizens’ Fourth Amendment (search and seizure) and 14th Amendment 
(equal protection) rights. The judge ruled that police had routinely stopped innocent people 
without reasonable suspicion and that the police had been engaging in racial profiling. About 
83 percent of the 4.4 million stops between 2004 and 2012 had involved blacks and Hispanics, 
two demographics that make up slightly more than 50 percent of the city population. The city 
argued that the racial pattern of the stops reflected the disproportionate share of crimes commit-
ted by young minority men, but the judge rejected that reasoning saying that comparison would 
be valid only if those stopped were criminals, but 88 percent of those stopped were released 
with no finding of a justification for the stops. Judge Scheindlin did not order a halt to 
 stop-and-frisk, which is an important law enforcement tool if properly employed. She did ap-
point a monitor to ensure police compliance with remedies including the use of body-worn 
cameras by some officers. The case is on appeal at this writing.
Question
Judge Scheindlin said, “It is impermissible to subject all members of a racially defined group 
to heightened police enforcement because some members of that group are criminals.” Do 
you agree? Explain.

breath test with a portable machine. His blood alcohol content was about twice the le-
gal limit. He was charged with driving while intoxicated. Was the warrantless blood 
test an unreasonable search? Explain. See Missouri v. McNeely, 133 S.Ct. 1552 (2013). 
 6. Police officer Hughes, from Council Bluffs, Iowa, saw Sorick, 28 years of age, riding his 
bicycle at 12:35 a.m. without lights in violation of a city ordinance. Hughes stopped 
Sorick, asked if he was carrying a weapon, and then frisked him, at which time he felt 
what he believed to be a baggie containing a hard substance. Hughes asked Sorick what 
the substance was, and Sorick said it was marijuana. Hughes issued a citation for posses-
sion of marijuana. Sorick was found guilty at trial but appealed, claiming the frisk was an 
unreasonable search. Hughes testified that he searched Sorick because Hughes feared for

his safety. The episode was late at night, the street was not lit, Sorick was in close prox-
imity to Hughes, and people in that neighborhood were known to have weapons. Was the 
search lawful? Explain. See Iowa v. Sorick, 810 N.W.2d 896 (Ia. Ct. App. 2012). 
7. James D. Harmon, Jr., owns an apartment building on West 76th Street near Central 
Park in New York City. Three of his apartments are subject to rent control, a long-time 
city program designed to maintain affordable housing in the very expensive Manhattan 
market. The rent-stabilized tenants were paying rent at 59 percent below market rates, 
according to Harmon. 
a. Harmon called rent control “privatized welfare.” Explain what he meant.
b. Harmon challenged the rent restriction. What constitutional law claim(s) was(were) 
raised by Harmon?
c. Who won the case? Explain. See Harmon v. Markus, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 4629; 
cert. den. Harmon v. Kimmel, 132 S.Ct. 1991 (2012).
 8. An Erie, Pennsylvania, public indecency ordinance prohibited knowingly or intention-
ally appearing in public in a “state of nudity.” Pap’s, the owners of Kandyland, an Erie 
establishment featuring totally nude dancers, challenged the constitutionality of the 
ordinance.
a. Explain the nature of that constitutional challenge.
b. Decide the case. Explain. See City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 529 U.S. 277 (2000).
 9. An individual and a group applied to the Chicago Park District for permits to hold rallies 
advocating the legalization of marijuana. The Park District, a municipal agency, required a 
permit to conduct a public assembly, parade, or other event involving more than 50 indi-
viduals. Applications for permits had to be processed within 28 days, and denials had to be 
clearly explained. Denials could be appealed to the general superintendent and then to 
the courts. The Park District denied some of the permits for pro-marijuana rallies. Those 
 denied filed suit, claiming the Park District permit rules were unconstitutional.
a. What constitutional challenge was raised by the plaintiffs?
b. Decide the case. Explain. See Thomas and Windy City Hemp Development Board v. 
Chicago Park District, 534 U.S. 316 (2002).
 10. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was asked if the judicial system had “gone 
off in error” by applying the equal protection requirements of the 14th Amendment to 
sex discrimination and sexual orientation discrimination. Scalia  responded, “Yes, 
yes. . . . Certainly the Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex. 
The only issue is whether it prohibits it. It doesn’t. . . .”72
a. Explain why Scalia believes the 14th Amendment does not forbid discrimination 
based on sex and sexual orientation.
b. Do you agree with Scalia? Explain.
 11. Lancaster, California, located about 45 miles from Los Angeles, was trying to build its 
 local economy but was tripped up by the U.S. Constitution. Costco, a big-box  retailer, 
wanted to expand into next-door space leased to 99 Cents Only Stores. Costco told the city 
it would move to Palmdale if it could not expand. Lancaster tried to buy 99 Cents’ lease, 
but the company refused. Lancaster then used its power of eminent domain to condemn the 
99 Cents property for the purpose of making it available to Costco. The city noted that 
blight might follow if Costco left, and the city contrasted 99 Cents’ under $40,000 per year

in sales taxes generated with Costco’s more than $400,000. 99 Cents then sued the city 
seeking an order blocking the effort to take the 99 Cents property.
a. How would you have ruled on the case when it was tried in 2001? Explain.
b. Would the result be any different today after the Supreme Court’s 2005 decision in 
the Kelo (New London, Connecticut) case? Explain. See 99 Cents Only Stores v. 
Lancaster Redevelopment Agency, 237 F.Supp.2d 1123 (C.D. Cal. 2001). Appeal 
dismissed, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 4197.
 12. Long Island, New York, resident Stephanie Fuller was secretly videotaped by her 
landlord, who had installed a video camera in the smoke detector above her bed. 
 Fuller’s landlord was found guilty of trespassing and was fined $1,500 and sentenced 
to 280 hours of community service.
a. Why was the landlord not charged with a more serious felony offense?
b. After Fuller’s experience, New York enacted a criminal unlawful surveillance statute; 
the statute includes language forbidding secret surveillance in places where the victim 
has “a reasonable expectation of privacy.” What significance attaches to that language?
13. Former North Carolina State University basketball stars Tom Gugliotta and Chris 
 Corchiani were ejected from North Carolina State’s arena during a 2012 game with 
 Florida State University. Referee Karl Hess asked a police officer to eject the two men 
who were seated immediately behind the scorer’s  table. Hess said he requested the ejec-
tions because of excessive demonstration by the two men that incited the crowd. Both 
men said they had not used inappropriate language. The Atlantic Coast Conference rep-
rimanded Hess for not following conference protocol in the incident. Home game man-
agement officials rather than a security officer should have been involved in ejecting the 
fans. Does the First Amendment protect speech uttered at sporting events? Explain.
 14. Milwaukee prostitutes, who had been arrested on multiple occasions, sued to block the 
city from enforcing a court-ordered injunction that permanently enjoined them from 
engaging in certain specified activities in certain specified areas of the city. They 
were prohibited from “engaging in beckoning to stop, or engaging male or female 
passersby in conversation, or stopping or attempting to stop motor vehicle operators 
by hailing, waving of arms or any other bodily gesture, or yelling in a loud voice” and 
other such activities. The women challenged the order on constitutional grounds.
a. Explain the nature of that constitutional challenge.
b. Decide the case. Explain. See City of Milwaukee v. Burnette, 637 N.W.2d 447 
(Wis. App. 2001); 638 N.W.2d 590 (Wis. S.Ct. 2001).
15. Jennifer O’Brien, a tenured teacher in the Paterson, New Jersey, schools with an un-
blemished performance record, was assigned to teach first grade in a school populated 
primarily by minority students. After a time, O’Brien concluded that several students in 
the class had behavioral problems that were disturbing the learning environment. Some 
students were hitting each other, one struck O’Brien, and another stole money from 
O’Brien and other students. O’Brien felt administrators had not responded adequately 
to her complaints, and she posted on her own Facebook page after school hours: “I’m 
not a teacher—I’m a warden for future criminals.” Parents and others were outraged. 
Protests followed. O’Brien said her remarks were not a commentary on race or ethnicity 
but were legitimate concerns about the behavior of some students. O’Brien was 

Chapter Five  Constitutional Law and the Bill of Rights  227
 dismissed from her teaching position. She sued, claiming, among other things, her ac-
tions were protected by the First Amendment. Decide the case. Explain. See In the Mat-
ter of the Tenure Hearing of Jennifer O’Brien, State Operated School District of the 
City of Paterson, Passaic County, 2013 N.J. Super. Unpub. LEXIS 28 (Sup. Ct. of N.J. 
App. Div. 2013).
 16. Paul Palmer submitted three shirts to his Waxahachie, Texas, school for approval 
under the school’s dress code. Two of the shirts said “John Edwards for President” 
and one said “Freedom of Speech” on the front and had the text of the First 
Amendment on the back. The shirts were rejected as violations of the school’s 
dress code that did not  allow shirts with printed messages except for those related 
to the school and those smaller than two inches by two inches. Political messages 
were permitted on pins,  buttons, bumper stickers, and the like. The dress code was 
designed to curb gang problems, reduce distractions, encourage professional dress, 
and maintain a safer, more orderly learning environment. Palmer sued the school 
claiming a violation of his First Amendment freedom of speech rights. Decide that 
case. Explain. See Palmer v. Waxahachie Independent School District, 579 F.3d 
502 (5th Cir. 2009); cert. den. Palmer v. Waxahachie Independent School District, 
130 S.Ct. 1055 (2010).
 17. The sons of a murder victim brought a wrongful death/negligence action against a 
magazine, Soldier of Fortune, alleging that it had published an ad creating an unrea-
sonable risk of violent crime. A former police officer had placed the ad offering his 
services as a bodyguard under the heading “Gun for Hire.” The ad resulted in the 
 officer being hired to kill the plaintiffs’ father. The ad included the phrases “professional 
mercenary,” “very private,” and a statement indicating that “all jobs” would be considered, 
but it also included a list of legitimate jobs that involved the use of a gun. The plaintiffs 
won the negligence action and were awarded a $4.3 million judgment. Soldier of Fortune 
appealed on First Amendment grounds. Decide. See Braun v. Soldier of Fortune  Magazine, 
Inc., 968 F.2d 1110 (11th Cir. 1992); cert. den. 113 S.Ct. 1028 (1993).
 18. The Madisonian idea of the First Amendment was to protect serious political  discourse. 
Now the First Amendment often protects hate speech and commercial babble. In a 
1996 book review and commentary, lawyer Paul Reidinger raised the concern that we 
may have “too much” free speech. Reidinger said, “The question these days is not 
whether government threatens free speech, but whether free speech threatens us. . . . 
[T]here is a tidal wave of fetid speech washing over the American landscape.” Has the 
marketplace of ideas failed? See Paul Reidinger, “Weighing Cost of Free Speech,” 
ABA Journal 82 (January 1996), p. 88.

Preface: The Role of Contracts in a Complex Society
A capitalist, free-market system cannot operate effectively and fairly without a reliable foun-
dation in contract law. At the practical level, all buyers and sellers must be confident that the 
deal they are about to make will be completed as specified, or that they will have a remedy 
available if it is not completed. Otherwise, the legal risk in making deals would act as a drag 
on the commercial process, reducing certainty and depreciating the extraordinary efficiency 
of the free market. At the philosophical level, the fundamental point of a contract is personal 
freedom. Contract law gives each of us a reliable mechanism for freely expressing our prefer-
ences in life. From buying a tube of toothpaste, a car, or a house, to paying tuition, to accept-
ing an employment offer, to franchising a  business, to borrowing millions of dollars, to 
adopting a child, and so on, the direction and value of our lives are shaped and protected to a 
significant degree by our contractual choices. To a considerable extent, we define ourselves 
by the contractual choices we make, and contract law protects those choices. The indispensa-
ble role of  contract law is revealed in the remarkable Facebook story that follows.

232  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Sharing Facebook?
Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO, developed the fabulously successful social network while 
still a student at Harvard. However, prior to Facebook becoming a publicly traded company 
in 2012, Zuckerberg’s ownership was challenged twice. In 2011, entrepreneur  Paul Ceglia, 
for whom Zuckerberg apparently agreed to write computer code while at Harvard, claimed 
that he and Zuckerberg entered into a contract in 2003 that entitled Ceglia to a 50 percent 
share in the company. In 2013, Ceglia’s lawsuit was dismissed based on a federal judge’s 
conclusion that there was “clear and convincing evidence” that the contract on which Ceglia 
based his complaint was forged. In 2012, Ceglia pleaded not guilty to federal charges of mail 
and wire fraud for forging evidence in his lawsuit. [For the alleged  Ceglia–Zuckerberg con-
tract, see “Work for Hire Contract” at http:// www.businessinsider.com/mark-zucker-
bergs-facebook-contract-with-paul-ceglia]
 
The battle between Zuckerberg and his college business partners, twins  Cameron and 
Tyler Winklevoss, over the rights to the Facebook idea was the subject of the 2010 
movie, The Social Network. The twins claim Zuckerberg stole their social networking 
idea. Zuckerberg denied that accusation, but the parties reached a settlement of about 
$65 million in 2008. The twins sued, however, to have the settlement overturned on the 
grounds that Facebook had not provided accurate valuation information during the set-
tlement process. A court of appeals panel in 2011  rejected the twin’s request; the Win-
kelvoss twins later dropped their U.S. Supreme Court appeal of that decision.
 
Also in 2011, Boston software developer Wayne Chang sued the Winklevoss twins 
for breach of contract, among other claims. Chang believes he is entitled to a share of the 
Winklevoss–Zuckerberg settlement (currently valued at around $160 million) based on 
a partnership and other understandings he claims to have entered with the twins  during 
their Harvard years to create and operate a social networking site named ConnectU.

Part One—Building a Binding Contract
Introduction
We make promises routinely in our lives. Some of those create bind-
ing  contracts; some do not. You promise, for example, to meet a friend 
after class, but you break your promise. Could your friend sue you in 
court for breach of contract? Doubtless your answer is “no” and, 
Have you breached 
a contract?

Chapter Six  Contracts  233
 barring unusual circumstances, you would be correct. But why? This raises the central ques-
tion in this chapter: Under what circumstances do promises become enforceable contracts? 
For the most part, the answer to that question has been provided by court decisions (the com-
mon law) accumulating over the many centuries of evolving contract law stretching from the 
ancient Middle East to  England and across the Atlantic to America. Those centuries of deci-
sions have provided a  substantially fair, consistent, and predictable body of contract law, 
particularly in a culture where the parties normally dealt with each other face-to-face, often as 
acquaintances. As business transactions became more complicated, the parties more and more 
distant from each other, and the comparative power between individuals and corporations 
 evermore  unbalanced, the need for government intervention increased. State legislatures 
 began to impose new rules on what had been purely private transactions. Look, for example, 
at state and federal regulation of employment contracts/relationships governing working con-
ditions such as hours of work, safety on the job, break time, and more (as explained in detail 
in Chapter 12). State laws and court decisions resulted, to some extent, in a confusing, ineffi-
cient patchwork of laws that didn’t conform to the reality of complex, contemporary business 
practice. As a result, the Uniform Commercial Code, a body of rules on commercial law 
across the United States, was developed and then adopted by state legislatures.
The Uniform Commercial Code
The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) and the 
American Law Institute (ALI) developed, for state-by-state approval, the Uniform 
 Commercial Code (UCC), a body of rules designed to render commercial law consistent 
across the 50 states. The UCC has been adopted in 49 states, and Louisiana has adopted 
portions of it. With a set of uniform, predictable rules, business can be practiced with 
 confidence and minimal legal confusion.
 
The UCC is divided into a series of articles addressing the multitude of potential issues 
that arise in complex commercial practice. For our purposes the most important of those 
 articles is Number 2, Sales, which governs all transactions involving the sale of goods. Sec-
tion 2-105 of the UCC defines goods as tangible, movable, things. Hence cars, clothing, ap-
pliances, and the like are covered. Real estate, stocks, bonds, money, and so forth are not 
covered. Nor are contracts for services governed by the UCC. Of course, many transactions 
involve both goods and services. Characteristically, in determining whether the UCC applies, 
the courts have asked whether the dominant purpose of the contract is to provide a service or 
to sell a good. Appendix B, at the back of the text, sets out the complete Article 2.
 
The first question, then, in contract disputes is whether the UCC or the common law 
governs the situation. Throughout this chapter, you should remember that the UCC is 
 always controlling (1) if the transaction is addressed by the UCC—that is, it involves a 
contract for the sale of goods—and (2) if a UCC rule applies to the issue in question. On 
the other hand, the judge-made, common law of contracts continues to govern transactions 
(1) not involving the sale of goods or (2) involving the sale of goods but where no specific 
UCC provision applies. Increasingly, in non-UCC cases, the courts are analogizing to 
UCC reasoning to render their judgments; that is, the common law is borrowing or absorb-
ing UCC principles. This chapter, while focusing primarily on the common law of 
 contracts, will introduce the role of the sales article in the practice of business. Article 2A 
of the UCC governs leases of goods. In essence, Article 2A mimics the sales article except 

234  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
that it governs leases of goods rather than sales. Because of space constraints, Article 2A 
will not receive further attention in this text. In 2011, the NCCUSL/ALI withdrew the 
2003 recommended revisions to Articles 2 and 2A; no state had yet adopted these revi-
sions, and the prospect for adoption was dim.
What Is a Contract?
Legally enforceable contracts must exhibit all of the following features:
1. Agreement. A meeting of the minds of the parties based on an offer by one and an 
 acceptance by the other. The determination as to whether the parties have actually 
reached agreement is based on the objective evidence (the parties’ acts, words, and so 
on) as a “reasonable person” would interpret it rather than on an effort to ascertain the 
subjective or personal intent of the parties.
2. Consideration. The bargained-for legal value that one party agrees to pay or provide to 
secure the promise of another.
3. Capacity. The parties must have the legal ability to enter the contract; that is, they must 
be sane, sober, and of legal age.
4. Genuineness of assent. The parties must knowingly agree to the same thing. Their 
minds must meet as shown by the objective evidence. If that meeting does not occur 
because of, for example, mistake or fraud, or the like, a contract does not exist because 
the parties’  assent was not real.
5. Legality of purpose. The object of the contract must not violate the law or public policy.
Contracts embracing these five features are enforceable by law; therefore, they are distin-
guishable from unenforceable promises. As explained later, some contracts must also be in 
writing to be enforceable.
Classification of Contracts
Contracts fall into a series of sometimes overlapping categories. These categories reveal 
the rather well-ordered logic of our contract system (see Figure 6.1).
Contract Formation
1. Bilateral and unilateral contracts. A bilateral contract emerges from a situation in 
which both parties make promises. A unilateral contract ordinarily involves a situation in which 
one party makes a promise and the other acts in response to that promise. For example, as you 
establish your new restaurant, you promise a college friend that if he completes his degree, you 
will hire him. He can accept your promise—or offer—by the act of completing college.
2. Express and implied contracts. When parties overtly and explicitly manifest their 
intention to enter an agreement, either in writing or orally, the result (if other  requirements are 
fulfilled) is an express contract. For example, in managing the accounting department at an 
insurance firm, you sign a form contract with a local computer store ordering a new  computer. 
In turn, the supplier’s signature on the form creates an express, bilateral agreement.

Chapter Six  Contracts  235
Contract Formation
 
1. Bilateral/unilateral
 
 
a. Bilateral contract—a promise for a promise.
 
 
b. Unilateral contract—a promise for an act.
 
2. Express/implied
 
 
a. Express contract—explicitly stated in writing or orally.
 
 
b. Implied-in-fact contract—inferred from the conduct of the parties.
 
 
c. Quasi-contract—implied contract created by a court to prevent unjust enrichment.
Contract performance
 
 
1. Executory contract—not yet fully performed.
 
 
2. Executed contract—fully performed by all parties.
Contract enforceability
 
 
1. Valid contract—includes all of the necessary ingredients of a binding contract.
 
 
2. Unenforceable contract—contract exists, but a legal defense prevents enforcement.
 
 
3. Void contract—no enforceable contract at all.
 
 
4. Voidable contract—one party has the option of either enforcing or voiding the contract.
FIGURE 6.1
Classification 
of Contracts
 
If, on the other hand, you ask your local computer service to repair a computer that is down 
and one of the service’s technicians does so, you have probably entered an implied-in-fact con-
tract. A court would infer a promise by you to pay a reasonable price in return for the service’s 
promise to make a commercially reasonable effort to repair the computer. The contract is in-
ferred on the basis of the facts—that is, by the behavior of the parties.
 
Suppose in managing the accounting department at the insurance firm, you receive a pre-
mium payment for  a policy that was not issued by your company, but rather by your rival firm. 
In these circumstances, it would be unfair for you to be able to keep the unearned money; 
therefore, the courts construct an implied-in-law or quasi-contract permitting the actual insurer 
to collect the money. This unusual situation in which the court infers the existence of a con-
tract is employed only when necessary to  prevent unjust enrichment (as would have been the 
case if you were to collect an insurance premium without having issued a policy).
Contract Performance
1. Executory contracts. A contract is labeled executory until all parties fully perform.
2. Executed contracts. When all parties have completed their performances, the 
contract is executed.
Contract Enforceability
1. Valid contracts. A valid contract meets all of the established legal requirements and 
thus is enforceable in court.
2. Unenforceable contracts. An unenforceable contract meets the basic contractual re-
quirements but remains faulty because it fails to fulfill some other legal rule. For example, an 
oral contract may be unenforceable if it falls in one of those categories of contracts, such as 
the sale of land, which must be in writing (see the Statute of Frauds later in this chapter).

236  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
3. Void contracts. A void contract is, in fact, no contract at all because a critical  legal re-
quirement is missing; usually it is either an agreement to accomplish an illegal purpose (such as 
to commit a crime) or an agreement involving an incompetent (such as an individual judged by 
a court to be insane). In either case what is otherwise an enforceable contract is in fact void.
4. Voidable contracts. A voidable contract is enforceable but can be canceled by one 
or more of the parties. The most common voidable contracts are those entered by  minors 
who have the option, under the law, of either disaffirming or fulfilling most contracts 
( explained later).
Can I Change My Mind?
Australian Vin Thomas placed his 1946 World War II Wirraway plane for sale on eBay. 
The plane reportedly is one of only five in the world still flying. Peter Smythe, also of 
Australia, matched the $128,640 reserve price moments before the online auction ended in 
2006. Thomas then declined to convey the airplane to Smythe apparently because Thomas 
had already agreed to sell the plane to another party for $85,800 more than Smythe’s bid. 
The case involved, among others, a pair of issues frequently arising in contracts law dis-
putes: (1) Did the facts (the eBay auction) create a contract? (2) Can Thomas change his 
mind about selling the plane to the highest bidder?
 
Answer those questions according to the U.S. contract law that follows.
The Agreement: Offer
Characteristically, an offer consists of a promise to do something or to refrain from doing 
something in the future. A valid offer must include all of these elements:
1. Present intent to enter a contract.
2. Reasonable definiteness in the terms of the offer.
3. Communication of the offer to the offeree.
Intent
Assume that you are the purchasing manager for a trucking firm, and you need a small used 
van to do some local light hauling. Because time is of the essence, you decide to  bypass the 
normal bidding process and go directly to the local dealers to make a quick purchase. At the 
first lot you find a suitable van. In discussing it, the sales manager says, “Well, we don’t usu-
ally do this, but since you’ve been such a good customer, I’ll tell you, we paid $10,000 for 
this one so I guess we are gonna need about $11,000 to deal with you.” You say, “Fine. 
That’s reasonable. I’ll take it.” The manager then says, “Now wait a minute, I was just talk-
ing off the top of my head. I’ll have to punch up the numbers to be sure.”
 
Do you have a deal at that point? The core question is whether the sales manager made 
an offer. Normally, language of that kind has been treated by the courts as preliminary 
negotiation lacking the necessary intent to constitute an offer. Of course, if no offer exists, 
you cannot accept, and no contract can emerge absent further negotiation.

Gambling
In 2006, Troy Blackford, a Des Moines, Iowa, truck driver, won $9,387 gambling at  Prairie 
Meadows casino. Blackford tried to collect the winnings, but his request was denied by the 
casino. Officials said that he had been banned from the casino since 1996, and the ban had 
not been lifted. (In the 1996 episode, Blackford had punched a slot machine and was 
 belligerent with casino security.) Blackford sued the casino.

2. Decide the case. Explain.

Advertisements The question of intent sometimes arises with 
 advertisements. In buying the van for your business, suppose 
you were responding to an ad that said, “2010 full-size Ford 
cargo van, $20,000.” Is that ad language an offer such that you 
can accept by promising to pay $20,000? Ordinarily, ads do not 
constitute offers, but rather are treated by the courts as invita-
tions to deal. Were an ad actually treated as an offer, it would put 
the seller in the commercially impracticable position of being 
required to provide the advertised product at the advertised price 
to everyone who sought one, regardless of available supply. Presumably, that open-ended 
duty was not the seller’s  intent when issuing the ad. It follows then that the buyer, in respond-
ing to an ad, is technically making an offer, with the seller free to accept or decline.
 
On the other hand, courts have held that some ads do manifest a present intent to make 
an offer. The critical terms in those ads must be highly specific and complete, leaving 
nothing open for negotiation.
Suppose you were responding 
to an ad that said, “2010 full-
size Ford cargo van, $20,000.” 
Is that ad language an offer 
such that you can accept by

A Jet Fighter from Pepsi?
A 1995 Pepsico promotion offered merchandise in exchange for points earned by buying 
Pepsi-Cola. The television ad showed a teenager modeling some of the available merchan-
dise. A Pepsi T-shirt was displayed for 75 points and a leather jacket for 1450 points. At 
the end of the ad, a U.S. Marine Corps Harrier “jump jet” landed outside a school, and the 
boy said, “Sure beats the bus.” The ad said the jet was redeemable for 7 million points. 
John D. R. Leonard, at the time a 21-year-old business student in Seattle, Washington, 
joined five investors in writing a check to Pepsi for $700,008.50 and demanded the 7 mil-
lion Pepsi points. Pepsi returned the check and said it had no intention of giving Leonard 
the $24 million jet. Leonard sued. Who wins? Explain.

238  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Definiteness
Suppose you have completed a management training program for a “big box” retailer. In 
your first assignment as an assistant manager, your boss asks you to seek bids and make the 
other arrangements (subject to her approval) to resurface the store’s large asphalt parking 
lot. You secure bids, and the lowest bidder offers to complete the work “later this summer” 
for $120,000. You briefly explain the offer to your boss, who tells you to take care of all the 
details. You are busy with other matters and you put off the parking lot project for a couple 
of weeks. When you get back to the contractor, he says, “Sorry, man, we hadn’t heard from 
you, and we got another deal.” Can you hold that contractor to his initial offer?
 
One of the requirements of a binding offer is that all of its critical terms must be suffi-
ciently clear that a court can determine both the intentions of the parties and their duties. 
Clearly, in the asphalt case, many critical details—such as precisely when the work would be 
done, the quality of the surfacing material, its thickness, and the like—had not been estab-
lished. Consequently, no offer existed. In a contract for the sale of goods, UCC 2-204 relaxes 
the definiteness standard by providing that “one or more terms” may be missing but the court 
can find a contract, nonetheless, where (1) “the parties have intended to make a contract” and 
(2) “there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.” Under the UCC, the 
courts can actually fill in missing terms such as specifying a  reasonable price where the con-
tract had omitted a stipulation. The following case involving Mariah Carey, the pop music 
star, demonstrates some of the problems that can arise when an  understanding is indefinite.
 
The alleged basis of the oral contract is that on at least three 
occasions, twice in the family car and once on Vian’s boat, Vian 
told Carey, “Don’t forget the Mariah dolls,” and “I get the Mariah 
dolls.” According to Vian, on one occasion Carey responded 
“okay” and on other occasions she merely smiled and nodded. 
Although Carey admits Vian mentioned the dolls two or three 
times, she testified that she thought it was a joke. For 30 years 
plaintiff has been in the business of designing, producing, and 
marketing gift and novelty items. Although it is not clear from the 
evidence the parties have submitted, it will be assumed that the 
alleged contract was formed after defendant turned 18. Under 
New York law, an oral agreement can form a binding contract. . . . 
In determining whether a contract exists, what matters are the 
parties’ expressed intentions, the words and deeds that consti-
tute objective signs in a given set of circumstances.
 
Therefore, the issue is whether the objective circum-
stances indicate that the parties intended to form a contract. 
Without such an intent, neither a contract nor a preliminary 
Judge Mukasey
Defendant Mariah Carey is a famous, successful and apparently 
wealthy entertainer. Plaintiff Joseph Vian was her stepfather 
before she achieved stardom, but at the start of this litigation 
was in the process of becoming divorced from  defendant’s 
mother. He claims defendant agreed orally that he would have a 
license to market singing dolls in her  likeness. . . . Plaintiff claims 
that he and Carey had an oral contract for him to receive a 
 license to market “Mariah dolls.” These dolls would be statu-
ettes of the singer and would play her most popular songs. 
Plaintiff claims that the contract was in consideration of his fi-
nancial and emotional support of defendant, including picking 
her up from late-night recording sessions, providing her with the 
use of a car, paying for dental care, allowing her to use his boat 
for business meetings and rehearsals, and giving her various 
items, including unused wedding gifts from his marriage to her 
mother, to help furnish her apartment.

Chapter Six  Contracts  239
agreement to negotiate in good faith can exist. In making such 
a determination, a court may look at “whether the terms of the 
contract have been finally resolved.” In addition, a court may 
consider “the context of the negotiations.” Plaintiff has ad-
duced no evidence that defendant ever intended by a nod of 
her head or the expression “okay” to enter into a complex 
commercial licensing agreement involving dolls in her likeness 
playing her copyrighted songs. The context in which this con-
tract between an 18-year-old girl and her stepfather allegedly 
was made was an informal family setting, either in the car or 
on plaintiff’s boat, while others were present. Vian’s own ver-
sion of events leads to the conclusion that there was no rea-
son for Carey to think Vian was entirely serious, let alone that 
he intended to bind her to an agreement at that time. He ad-
mits he never told her he was serious. The objective circum-
stances do not indicate that Carey intended to form a contract 
with plaintiff. Although plaintiff’s five-page memorandum of 
law fails to raise the possibility, plaintiff also has not shown 
that Carey intended to be bound to negotiate with plaintiff at 
some later date over the licensing of “Mariah dolls.”
 
There can be no meeting of the minds, required for the 
formation of a contract, where essential material terms are 
missing. Thus, even if the parties both believe themselves 
to be bound, there is no contract when “the terms of the 
agreement are so vague and indefinite that there is no ba-
sis or standard for deciding whether the agreement had 
been kept or broken, or to fashion a remedy, and no means 
by which such terms may be made certain.”
 
. . . The word “license” was not even used. As defendant 
points out, no price or royalty term was mentioned, nor was 
the duration or geographic scope of the license, nor was Car-
ey’s right to approve the dolls. Plaintiff admits he would not 
have gone ahead without defendant’s approval, thus conced-
ing the materiality of that term.
* * * * *
 
In sum, plaintiff has not raised a triable issue of fact as to 
the existence of a contract. Defendant’s motion for summary 
judgment is granted.
Questions
1. Why did the court find for Carey?
2. As noted in the text, in UCC cases judges fill in contract 
terms where the parties clearly intended a deal. Should the 
court here fill in the missing terms to provide the neces-
sary definiteness? Explain.
3. Pilgrim Village Company had employed Petersen as a con-
struction manager at a specified annual salary and “a 
share of the profits.” Petersen worked at salary for several 
years and then asked for a 10 percent share of the profits. 
The company refused, and Petersen sued seeking “some 
share of the profits.” How should the court rule on 
 Petersen’s claim? Explain. See Petersen v. Pilgrim Village, 
42 N.W.2d 273 (Wis. S.Ct., 1950).
Communication
As explained, an effective offer must be the product of a present intent, it must be definite, 
and it must be communicated to the offeree. Communication of an offer expresses the 
 offeror’s intent to make that offer. Suppose a friend tells you that your neighbor has  offered 
to sell his classic jukebox for $10,000. You call your neighbor and say, “I accept. I’ll be 
right over with the $10,000.” Do you have a deal? No. The owner did not communicate the 
offer to you. The fact that it was not communicated to you may suggest that your neighbor 
does not want to sell or does not want to sell to you.
Duration of an Offer Communication of an offer affords the offeree the opportunity to 
create a contract by accepting that offer, but how long does that opportunity last? Here are 
some general rules:
1. The offeror may revoke the offer anytime prior to acceptance. (Some exceptions are 
explained later.) Normally, revocation is effective on receipt by the offeree. Under com-
mon law the offeror has the right to revoke at any time prior to acceptance, even if he or 
she expressly promised to keep the offer open for a specified period.
2. The offer may specify that it is open for an express period (such as 10 days).

240  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
3. Where a time limit is not specified in the offer it will be presumed to be open for a 
 reasonable period.
4. An offer expires if rejected or on receipt of a counteroffer.
Irrevocable Offers
Some kinds of offers may not be revoked. We will note three of them.
1. Option contracts. When an offeror promises to keep an offer open for a specified period 
and, in return, the offeree pays consideration (usually money), the parties have created an 
option contract, which is a separate agreement and is enforceable by its terms. For exam-
ple, a friend has offered to sell to you his customized car that you have long cherished, but 
you want to think about it for a few days. You might enter an option contract with your 
friend under which you pay $100 for the seller’s promise to keep the offer open for seven 
days. You are under no obligation to buy the car, but the seller is under a binding obliga-
tion not to withdraw the offer or sell to another during the seven days.
2. Firm offers. Under the UCC, if the owner of that customized car is a dealer (a merchant) 
and he made a written, signed offer to sell that car (a good) to you, indicating that his offer 
would remain open for seven days, he is bound to that promise whether you paid consid-
eration for it or not. That situation is labeled a firm offer as specified in UCC 2-205, which 
also provides that such offers will be kept open for a reasonable period if the agreement 
does not mention a time, but that period cannot exceed three months.
3. Offers for unilateral contracts. A problem sometimes arises when the offeror attempts 
to revoke a unilateral offer after the offeree has begun to perform. For example, your 
neighbor invites you to rake her leaves for $10, and then, when you are virtually done, 
she yells from the doorway, “Oh, sorry, I changed my mind. You go home now.” 
 Historically, the offeror (the neighbor, in this case) was free to revoke at any time, but 
the modern position holds that the offeror normally cannot revoke if the offeree (you) 
has commenced performance. If that performance is then completed (you ignore your 
neighbor’s admonition to go home, and you finish the raking), the offeror (your neigh-
bor) is bound to perform fully by paying the $10.
The Agreement: Acceptance
Suppose you are in training with a large real estate firm and your boss has authorized you 
to enter negotiations to buy a parcel of farmland that your company hopes to develop for 
housing. After preliminary discussions, you extend a written offer to the owner indicating, 
among other terms, that your company is willing to pay $10,000 per acre for a 10-acre 
parcel. Assume the owner responds by writing, “I accept your offer at $10,000 per acre, 
but I need to keep the two-acre homesite.” The offeree has used the word accept, but does 
the response constitute a legally binding acceptance?
 
The general rule is that an effective acceptance must be a mirror image of the offer; that 
is, ordinarily its terms must be the same as those in the offer. Here the offeree has changed 
the terms of the offer and in so doing has issued a counteroffer, thus extinguishing the 
original offer.

Chapter Six  Contracts  241
Communication of Acceptance
An offer may be accepted only by the offeree—that is, the person to whom the offer was 
directed. Because unilateral offers are accepted by performance, no communication of 
 acceptance beyond that performance ordinarily is necessary. In the case of a bilateral con-
tract (a promise for a promise), acceptance is not effective until communicated.
 
Broadly, acceptance can be accomplished by a “yes” communicated face-to-face, by a 
nod of the head or some other appropriate signal, by phone, or by other unwritten means, 
unless the law of the state requires writing in that particular kind of transaction.
Mailbox Confusion sometimes arises when the parties are not dealing face-to-face. In 
general, acceptance is effective upon dispatch by whatever mode of communication has 
been explicitly or implicitly authorized by the offeror. This well-settled position is labeled 
the mailbox rule and means, among other things, that an acceptance is effective when sent 
even if never received. [For one professor’s review of the mailbox rule and related rules, 
see http://www.tomwbell.com/teaching/KMailbox.pdf]
Authorization The offeror controls the acceptance process and may specify an exclusive 
manner in which an acceptance must be communicated. If so, a contract is not created if the 
acceptance is communicated in anything other than the stipulated fashion. Traditionally, if the 
offeror did not give an express authorization to a means of communication, an acceptance by 
the same or faster means than that used by the offeror was implied. Implied authorization might 
also arise from such factors as prior dealings between the parties and custom in their industry.
Modern View Under the UCC the rules have relaxed a bit. If no specific instructions for 
acceptance are included in the offer, the offeree is free to accept in any reasonable manner 
within a reasonable period, and acceptance is effective upon dispatch. Even when the 
means chosen are “unreasonable,” acceptance is effective on dispatch under the UCC 
1-201(38) if it is actually received in a timely manner.
Consideration
Earlier we identified the five key ingredients in an enforceable contract: agreement, con-
sideration, capacity, genuineness of assent, and legality of purpose. Having examined the 
agreement (offer/acceptance) process, we turn now to consideration. As noted earlier, con-
sideration is the bargained-for legal value that one party agrees to pay or provide to secure 
the promise of another. It is what the promisor demands and receives in exchange for his 
or her promise. Consideration is used by the courts to distinguish a contract (enforceable) 
from a gratuitous promise (unenforceable). The promisee must suffer a legal detriment; 
that is, the promisee must give up something of value (an act or a promise) or must refrain 
from doing something that she or he has a legal right to do in order to enforce the promise 
offered by the promisor. Each party, then, must pay a “price” for a contract to be enforce-
able. In sum, consideration consists of a detriment to the promisee that is bargained for by 
the promisor.
 
The classic case that follows explores the idea of consideration and demonstrates that 
consideration can have legal value without involving monetary loss to the promisee.

27 N.E. 256 (N.Y. 1891)
up with this kind of fare. I was here in the cholera season 
‘49 and ‘52 and the deaths averaged 80 to 125 daily and 
plenty of smallpox. I wanted to go home, but Mr. Fisk, the 
gentleman I was working for, told me if I left then, after it 
got healthy he probably would not want me. I stayed. All the 
money I have saved I know just how I got it. It did not come 
to me in any mysterious way, and the reason I speak of this 
is that money got in this way stops longer with a fellow that 
gets it with hard knocks than it does when he finds it. Willie, 
you are 21 and you have many a thing to learn yet. This 
money you have earned much easier than I did besides 
acquiring good habits at the same time and you are quite 
welcome to the money; hope you will make good use of it. I 
was 10 long years getting this together after I was your age. 
Now, hoping this will be satisfactory, I stop . . .

W.E. STORY
P.S.—You can consider this money on interest.
 
The nephew received the letter and thereafter consented 
that the money should remain with his uncle in accordance 
with the terms and conditions of the letter. The uncle died on 
the 29th day of January 1887, without having paid over to his 
nephew any portion of the said $5,000 and interest.
* * * * *
 
The defendant contends that the contract was without con-
sideration to support it, and, therefore, invalid. He asserts that the 
promisee by refraining from the use of liquor and tobacco was not 
harmed but benefited; that that which he did was best for him to 
do independently of his uncle’s promise, and insists that it follows 
that unless the promisor was benefited, the contract was without 
consideration. A contention, which if well founded, would seem to 
leave open for controversy in many cases whether that which the 
promisee did or omitted to do was, in fact, of such benefit to him 
as to leave no consideration to support the enforcement of the 
promisor’s agreement. Such a rule could not be tolerated, and is 
without foundation in the law.
* * * * *
 
“In general a waiver of any legal right at the request of 
 another party is a sufficient consideration for a promise” 
(Parsons on Contracts).
 
Pollock, in his work on contracts, says, “Consideration 
means not so much that one party is profiting as that the other 
abandons some legal right in the present or limits his legal 
freedom of action in the future as an inducement for the prom-
ise of the first.”
FACTS
In 1869 William E. Story Sr. promised his nephew, W.E. Story 
II, that he would pay the nephew $5,000 upon his 21st birthday 
if the nephew would refrain from drinking liquor, using to-
bacco, swearing, and playing cards or billiards for money until 
he reached that 21st birthday. The nephew agreed and per-
formed his promise, but the uncle died in 1887 without paying 
the money, and the administrator of the estate, Sidway, de-
clined to pay the $5,000 plus interest. The nephew had as-
signed (sold) his rights to the money to Louisa Hamer, who 
sued W.E. Story Sr.’s estate. Hamer, the plaintiff, won at the 
trial level, lost on appeal, and then appealed to the New York 
Court of Appeals.

When the nephew arrived at the age of 21 years and on the 
31st day of January 1875, he wrote to his uncle informing him 
that he had performed his part of the agreement and had 
thereby  become entitled to the sum of $5,000. The uncle 
 received the letter and a few days later and on the sixth of 
February, he wrote and mailed to his nephew the following 
 letter:
Buffalo, February 6, 1875
W.E. Story, Jr.
Dear Nephew:
Your letter of the 31st came to hand all right, saying that you 
had lived up to the promise made to me several years ago. I 
have no doubt but you have, for which you shall have five 
thousand dollars as I promised you. I had the money in the 
bank the day you was 21 years old that I intend for you, and 
you shall have the money certain. Now, Willie I do not 
intend to interfere with this money in any way till I think you 
are capable of taking care of it and the sooner that time 
comes the better it will please me. I would hate very much 
to have you start out in some adventure that you thought all 
right and lose this money in one year. The first five thousand 
dollars that I got together cost me a heap of hard work. You 
would hardly believe me when I tell you that to obtain this I 
shoved a jackplane many a day, butchered three or four 
years, then came to this city, and after three months’ 
perseverance I obtained a situation in a grocery store. I 
opened this store early, closed late, slept in the fourth story

being in the building but myself. All this I done to live as 
cheap as I could to save something. I don’t want you to take

Now, applying this rule to the facts before us, the prom-
isee used tobacco, occasionally drank liquor, and had a legal 
right to do so. That right he abandoned for a period of years 
upon the strength of the promise of the testator that for such 
forbearance he would give him $5,000. We need not specu-
late on the effort which may have been required to give up 
the use of those stimulants. It is sufficient that he restricted 
his lawful freedom of action within certain prescribed limits 
upon the faith of his uncle’s agreement, and now having fully 
performed the conditions imposed, it is of no moment 
whether such performance actually proved a benefit to the 
promisor, and the court will not inquire into it, but were it a 
proper subject of inquiry, we see nothing in this record that 
would permit a determination that the uncle was not bene-
fited in a legal sense.

Questions
1. a. What detriment, if any, was sustained by the nephew?
 
b. What benefit, if any, was secured by the uncle?
 
c.  As a matter of law, do we need to inquire into the 
 uncle’s benefit? Explain.
2. Lampley began work as an at-will (can be dismissed or can 
quit at any time) employee of Celebrity Homes in Denver, 
Colorado, in May 1975. On July 29, 1975, Celebrity announced 
a profit-sharing plan for all employees if the company 
reached its goals for the fiscal year, April 1,1975, to March 
31, 1976. Lampley was dismissed in January 1976. Celebrity 
distributed its profits in May 1976. Lampley sued when she 
did not receive a share of the profits. Celebrity argued that 
its promise to share its profits was a gratuity, unsupported 
by consideration. Decide. Explain. See Lampley v. Celebrity 
Homes, 594 P.2d 605 (Col. Ct. App. 1979).
3. An accident in the early 1960s rendered Hoffman paraple-
gic. At Hoffman’s invitation, Thomas lived with and pro-
vided extensive physical care for Hoffman until Hoffman’s 
death in 2004. Thomas did not pay rent and Hoffman paid 
for Thomas’ food, provided her with a car and cell phone, 
and made occasional cash payments to Thomas. While 
never married, the couple exchanged rings in 2002 and 
Thomas testified that she felt they “lived as man and wife.” 
Thomas filed suit seeking $44,625 for services rendered to 
Hoffman. According to the trial court, her claim was based 
on the theories of “express or implied contract of employ-
ment” or “unjust enrichment.” Thomas lost at the trial 
level. How would you rule on appeal? Explain. See In Re 
Estate of Hoffman, 2006 Ia. App. LEXIS 473. [For a detailed 
analysis of Hamer v. Sidway, see http://www.law.smu

Chapter Six  Contracts  243
Adequacy of Consideration
With certain exceptions, the courts do not, as Judge Parker indicated in the Hamer case, 
inquire into the economic value of the consideration in question. Legal sufficiency  depends 
not on the value of the consideration but on whether the promisee suffered a detriment in 
some way. To hold otherwise would put the courts in the place of the market in deciding 
the value of transactions. We are all free to make both good and bad bargains.
 
On the other hand, the courts will rule that consideration is found wanting in situations 
of pretense or sham where the parties have clearly agreed on token or nominal considera-
tion in an effort to present the transaction as a contract rather than a gift. Likewise, an 
 extreme inadequacy of consideration will sometimes cause the court to question a contract 
on the grounds of fraud, duress, or unconscionability (all are discussed later in this chap-
ter). In these instances, the agreements would be unenforceable because of a failure of 
consideration. These cases are uncommon, however, and the courts rarely  inquire into the 
adequacy of consideration.
Appearance of Consideration
Some agreements appear to be accompanied by consideration, but in fact, that appearance 
turns out to be an illusion. Hence, if one agrees to perform a preexisting duty, c onsideration 

244  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
would be found wanting. For example, if you were to pay your neighbor $50 to keep his 
dog chained when outdoors and a city ordinance already requires dogs to be chained if 
outdoors, your promise would be unenforceable because your neighbor already had a pre-
existing duty under the law to keep his dog chained. So performance of a preexisting legal 
duty does not constitute consideration because no legal detriment or benefit has arisen.
 
Similarly, preexisting duties sometimes arise from contracts. Suppose you hire a contrac-
tor to resurface the parking lot at your real estate office. You agree on a price of $12,000. 
With a portion of the work completed, the contractor asks you to amend the agreement to add 
$2,000 because the project is requiring more time than anticipated. You agree. The work is 
completed. Could you then legally refuse to pay the additional $2,000? The answer is yes 
because the contractor failed to provide consideration for the modification of your contract. 
He was under a preexisting duty to finish the contract; hence, he did not sustain a legal detri-
ment in the modified agreement. Note, however, that UCC section 2-209(1) provides that “an 
agreement modifying a contract within this Article needs no consideration to be binding.”
 
Suppose you learn from your neighbor that your friend Ames wants to sell his house. 
You, as a realtor, find a buyer for the house and make all of the necessary arrangements for 
the sale out of regard for your friendship with Ames. Then when the transaction is com-
plete, Ames says, “Well, this has been great of you, but I don’t feel right about it. When I 
get my check for the sale, I’ll pay you $2,000 for your hard work. I really appreciate it.” 
What if Ames does not then pay the $2,000? Do you have recourse? No. This is a situation 
of past consideration, where the performance—arranging the sale of your friend’s house—
was not bargained for and was not given in exchange for the promise and thus cannot 
constitute consideration. In effect, the performance was a gift. Of course, past considera-
tion is really not consideration at all. In some states, courts enforce promises to pay for 
benefits already received where doing so amounts to a moral obligation that must be en-
forced to prevent injustice.
Substitutes for Consideration
When necessary to achieve justice, the courts sometimes conclude that a contract exists 
even though consideration is clearly lacking. Moral obligation and quasi-contract (dis-
cussed earlier) are two such instances, but the most prominent of these substitutes for 
consideration is the doctrine of promissory estoppel, in which the promisor is “stopped” 
from denying the existence of a contract where the promisee has detrimentally relied on 
that promise. Promissory estoppel requires the following:
1. A promise on which the promisor should expect the promisee to rely.
2. The promisee did justifiably rely on the promise.
3. Injustice can be avoided only by enforcing the promise.
 
Consider the following. You have been a part-time employee of a small fast-food chain 
restaurant while attending college. Upon graduation, you tell the manager of the restaurant 
that you think you could handle your own franchise. He says you need to get more experience 
and advises you to take a full-time position with the company. You do so. Everything goes 
well, and when you next approach the manager, he says, “If you can come up with the $50,000 
and a good location, we will get you in a franchise right away. But you’ve gotta move on this. 
Maybe you better quit your job with us and concentrate on this thing.” You take his advice and 

Chapter Six  Contracts  245
quit your job. You raise the $50,000 and find a vacant building to rent in a good location for a 
franchise. You show the building to the manager, and he agrees that it looks like a favorable 
location and one that can easily be converted to the company’s needs. He says, “Looks like 
you have everything in place. If you can come up with $50,000 more we will make this thing 
happen.” You refuse and decide to bring suit against the fast-food chain for breach of contract. 
The chain defends by saying that you did not provide consideration for its promise. No formal 
financing arrangement was ever agreed to, and you had not committed yourself to any fran-
chising obligations. Under these circumstances you may well prevail using a promissory 
 estoppel claim. In brief, you would argue that you had changed your position in reliance on the 
franchisor’s promises and that relief is necessary to prevent injustice. [For a similar case see 
Hoffman v. Red Owl Stores, 133 N.W.2d 267 (Wis. S.Ct. 1965).]
Capacity
Having examined two of the required ingredients in an enforceable contract, agreement 
and consideration, we turn now to a third, capacity to contract. To enter a binding agree-
ment, one must have the legal ability to do so; that is, one’s mental 
condition and maturity must be such that the agreement was entered 
with understanding and in recognition of one’s own interests. The 
three primary areas of concern are intoxication, mental impairment, 
and minority (infancy/youthfulness), with minority being much the 
more common area of dispute.
Intoxication
Assume you have been drinking to celebrate your 21st birthday. You enter a contract with a 
friend to sell him your autographed Michael Jordan basketball card for $200. You  receive 
the money and turn over the card. Later, when sober, you regret the deal. Will a court nullify 
that contract on the grounds of your intoxication? That decision depends on whether you 
were sufficiently intoxicated that you did not understand the nature and purpose of the con-
tract. If the objective evidence suggests that you did not understand the transaction, the 
contract would be considered voidable, in which case you could probably disaffirm the con-
tract and demand the return of the card, although courts are often not sympathetic with 
 people who attempt to escape contracts made while intoxicated. In most states, if you recov-
ered the card, you would be required to return the $200 to your friend.
 
If on recovering your sobriety, your friend argued that the contract was invalid because 
of your intoxication, and he demanded the return of his $200 in exchange for the card, you 
could then ratify (affirm) the contract and hold him to it. If the contract had been for one of 
life’s necessaries (food, shelter, clothing, medical care, tools of one’s trade, or the like), 
you would have been liable for the reasonable value of that necessary.
Mental Incompetence
In most cases an agreement involving a mentally incompetent person is either void or 
 voidable. The transaction would be void—that is, no contract would exist—where the 
 impaired party had been adjudged insane. If the impaired party was unable to understand 
The three primary areas of 
concern are intoxication, 
mental impairment, and 
 minority.

246  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
the purpose and effect of the contract but had not been legally adjudged insane, the  contract 
would be voidable (void in some states) at the option of the impaired party. The competent 
party cannot void the contract, and the impaired party would have to pay the reasonable 
value of any necessaries received under the contract.
Minority
Minors may complete their contracts if they wish, but they also have an absolute right to rescind 
most of those contracts. They may rescind until they reach adulthood and for a reasonable time 
thereafter. (Many states have enacted statutes forbidding minors from 
 disaffirming some classes of contracts such as those for marriage, stu-
dent loans, and life insurance.) The minor has a right of recovery for 
everything given up in meeting the terms of the contract.  Similarly, the 
minor must return everything that remains in her or his possession that 
was received from the contract. In many states, if nothing of the 
 bargained-for consideration remains or if its value has been depreciated, 
the minor has no duty to replace it but can still recover whatever she or 
he put into the contract. If not disaffirmed in a reasonable time after the minor reaches the age of 
majority, the contract is considered to be ratified, and the minor is bound to its terms. The minor 
is also liable for the reasonable value (not necessarily the contract price) of necessaries purchased 
from an adult. That is, a minor must pay the adult the reasonable value of contracted-for items 
such as food, clothing, shelter, medical care, basic education, and tools of the minor’s trade.
 
Despite the flexibility accorded to minors entering contracts, the adults who are parties 
to those contracts are bound to them and do not have the power to disaffirm. Hence, adults 
put themselves at risk when they choose to bargain with minors. As noted, in many states 
a minor need not make restitution if the consideration is lost, destroyed, or depreciated. On 
the other hand, the case that follows illustrates the growing view that minors do have some 
monetary obligation after disaffirming a contract.
Minors may complete their 
contracts if they wish, but 
they also have an absolute 
right to rescind most of those 
contracts.
 
In December 1987, nine months after the date of pur-
chase, the truck began to develop mechanical problems. A 
mechanic diagnosed the problem as a burnt valve, but 
could not be certain without inspecting the valves inside 
the engine. Dodson did not want, or did not have the money, 
to effect these repairs. He continued to drive the truck de-
spite the mechanical problems. One month later, in Janu-
ary, the truck’s engine “blew up” and the truck became 
inoperable.
 
Dodson parked the vehicle in the front yard at his parents’ 
home, where he lived. He contacted the Shraders to rescind 
Justice O’Brien
In early April of 1987, Joseph Eugene Dodson, then 16 years of 
age, purchased a used 1984 pickup truck from Burns and Mary 
Shrader. The Shraders owned and operated Shrader’s Auto 
Sales in Columbia, Tennessee. Dodson paid $4,900 in cash for 
the truck, using money he borrowed from his girlfriend’s 
grandmother. At the time of the purchase there was no inquiry 
by the Shraders, and no misrepresentation by Dodson, con-
cerning his minority. However, Shrader did testify that at the 
time he believed Dodson to be 18 or 19 years of age.

the purchase of the truck and requested a full refund. The 
Shraders refused to accept the tender of the truck or to give 
Dodson the refund requested.
 
Dodson then [sued] to rescind the contract and recover 
the amount paid for the truck. Before the circuit court could 
hear the case, the truck, while parked in Dodson’s front yard, 
was struck on the left front fender by a hit-and-run driver. At 
the time of the circuit court trial, according to Shrader, the 
truck was worth only $500 due to the damage to the engine 
and the left front fender.
 
The case was heard in the circuit court in November 1988. 
The trial judge, based on previous common-law decisions, and 
under the doctrine of stare decisis, reluctantly granted the re-
scission. The Shraders were ordered, upon tender and 
 delivery of the truck, to reimburse the $4,900 purchase price to 
Dodson. The Shraders appealed.
 
[T]he rule in Tennessee is in accord with the majority rule 
on the issue among our sister states. This rule is based on the 
underlying purpose of the “infancy doctrine,” which is to pro-
tect minors from their lack of judgment and “from squandering 
their wealth through improvident contracts with crafty adults 
who would take advantage of them in the marketplace.”
 
There is, however, a modern trend among the states, either 
by judicial action or by statute, in the approach to the problem 
of balancing the rights of minors against those of innocent 
merchants. As a result, two minority rules have developed that 
allow the other party to a contract with a minor to refund less 
than the full consideration paid in the event of rescission.
 
The first of these minority rules is called the “Benefit Rule.” 
The rule holds that, upon rescission, recovery of the full pur-
chase price is subject to a deduction for the minor’s use of the 
merchandise. This rule recognizes that the traditional rule in 
regard to necessaries has been extended so far as to hold an 
infant bound by his contracts, where he failed to restore what 
he has received under them to the extent of the benefit actu-
ally derived by him from what he has received from the other 
party to the transaction.
 
The other minority rule holds that the minor’s recovery of 
the full purchase price is subject to a deduction for the minor’s 
“use” of the consideration he or she received under the con-
tract, or for the “depreciation” or “deterioration” of the con-
sideration in his or her possession.
 
We are impressed by the statement made by the Court of 
Appeals of Ohio:
At a time when we see young persons between 18 and 21 
years of age demanding and assuming more responsibilities 
in their daily lives, when we see such persons emancipated, 
married, and raising families; when we see such persons 
charged with the responsibility for committing crimes; when 
we see such persons being sued in tort claims for acts of 
negligence; when we see such persons subject to military 
service; when we see such persons engaged in business 
and acting in almost all other respects as an adult, it seems 
timely to reexamine the case law pertaining to contractual 
rights and responsibilities of infants to see if the law as 
pronounced and applied by the courts should be redefined.
* * * * *
 
We state the rule to be followed hereafter, in reference to a 
contract of a minor, to be where the minor has not been over-
reached in any way, and there has been no undue influence, 
and the contract is a fair and reasonable one, and the minor has 
actually paid money on the purchase price, and taken and used 
the article purchased; that he ought not be permitted to recover 
the amount actually paid, without allowing the vendor of the 
goods reasonable compensation for the use of, depreciation, 
and willful or negligent damage to the article purchased, while 
in his hands. If there has been any fraud or imposition on the 
part of the seller or if the contract is unfair, or any unfair advan-
tage has been taken of the minor inducing him to make the pur-
chase, then the rule does not apply. Whether there has been 
such an overreaching on the part of the seller, and the fair 
 market value of the property returned, would always, in any 
case, be a question for the trier of fact. . . .
 
This rule is best adapted to modern conditions under which 
minors are permitted to, and do in fact, transact a great deal of 
business for themselves, long before they have reached the age 
of legal majority. Many young people work and earn money and 
collect it and spend it oftentimes without any oversight or restric-
tion. The law does not question their right to buy if they have the 
money to pay for their purchases. It seems intolerably burden-
some for everyone concerned if merchants and businesspeople 
cannot deal with them safely, in a fair and reasonable way.
* * * * *
 
We note that in this case, some nine months after the date of 
purchase, the truck purchased by the plaintiff began to  develop 
mechanical problems. Plaintiff was informed of the probable na-
ture of the difficulty, which apparently involved internal problems 
in the engine. He continued to drive the  vehicle until the engine 
“blew up” and the truck became inoperable. Whether or not this 
involved gross negligence or intentional conduct on his part is a 
matter for determination at the trial level. It is not possible to 
 determine from this record whether a counterclaim for tortious 
damage to the vehicle was asserted. After the first tender of the 
vehicle was made by plaintiff, and refused by the defendant, the 
truck was damaged by a hit-and-run driver while parked on plain-
tiff’s property. The amount of that damage and the liability for that 

248  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
amount  between the purchaser and the vendor, as well as the fair 
market value of the vehicle at the time of tender, are also an issue 
for the jury.

disagreement over replacement of a motor. White then 
 disaffirmed his contract with Valencia and refused to pay

caused the damage to the motor, but the court held that 
White could disaffirm the contract and required Valencia

Genuineness of Assent
Sometimes parties appear to have concluded a binding contract, but the courts will allow 
them to escape that obligation because they had not, in fact, achieved an agreement. They 
had achieved the appearance of agreement, but not the reality. That situation arises when the 
contract is the product of misrepresentation, fraud, duress, undue influence, or mistake. 
 Ordinarily, such agreements are voidable and may be rescinded by the innocent party  because 
of the absence of genuine assent, the fourth of five ingredients in a binding contract.
Misrepresentation and Fraud
An innocent untruth is a misrepresentation. Intentional untruths constitute fraud. In either case, 
a party to a contract who has been deceived may rescind the deal, and restitution may be se-
cured if benefits were extended to the party issuing the untruth. The test for fraud is as follows:
1. Misrepresentation of a material fact.
2. The misrepresentation was intentional.
3. The injured party justifiably relied on the misrepresentation.
4. Injury resulted.
Note that the test requires a misrepresented fact. In general, misrepresented opinions are not 
grounds for action, but many courts are now recognizing exceptions to that rule,  especially 
when the innocent party has relied on opinion coming from an expert.
If you are selling a house that allegedly is 
“haunted,” does your failure to reveal the ghostly 
presence constitute a misrepresentation? The 
Stambovsky case that follows  addresses that unu-
sual question.
You are selling a house that 
allegedly is “haunted.”

Stambovsky v. Ackley et al.
169 A.D.2d 254 (S.Ct. N.Y., App. Div., 1st Dept. 1991)
involving a house possessed by poltergeists conjures up vi-
sions of a  psychic or medium routinely accompanying the 
structural engineer and Terminix man on an inspection of 
every home subject to a contract of sale. It portends that the 
prudent attorney will establish an escrow account lest the 
subject of the transaction come back to haunt him and his 
client—or pray that his malpractice insurance coverage ex-
tends to supernatural  disasters. In the interest of avoiding 
such untenable consequences, the notion that a haunting is 
a condition which can and should be ascertained upon rea-
sonable inspection of the premises is a hobgoblin which 
should be exorcised from the body of legal precedent and 
laid quietly to rest.
 
It has been suggested by a leading authority that the 
 ancient rule which holds that mere nondisclosure does not 
constitute actionable misrepresentation “finds proper 
 application in cases where the fact undisclosed is patent, or 
the plaintiff has equal opportunities for obtaining information 
which he may be  expected to utilize, or the defendant has no 
reason to think that he is acting under any misapprehension” 
(Prosser, Torts Section 106, at 696 [4th ed 1971]). However, 
with respect to transactions in real estate, New York adheres 
to the doctrine of caveat emptor and imposes no duty upon the 
vendor to disclose any  information concerning the premises 
unless there is a confidential or fiduciary relationship between 
the parties or some conduct on the part of the seller which 
constitutes “active concealment.” Normally, some affirmative 
misrepresentation or partial disclosure is required to impose 
upon the seller a duty to communicate undisclosed conditions 
affecting the premises.
 
Common law is not moribund. . . . Where fairness and com-
mon sense dictate that an exception should be created, the 
evolution of the law should not be stifled by rigid application of 
a legal maxim.
 
The doctrine of caveat emptor requires that a buyer act pru-
dently to assess the fitness and value of his purchase and oper-
ates to bar the purchaser who fails to exercise due care from 
seeking the equitable remedy of rescission. For the purposes of 
the instant motion to dismiss the action . . . plaintiff is entitled to 
every favorable inference which may reasonably be drawn from 
the pleadings, specifically, in this instance, that he met his obliga-
tion to conduct an inspection of the premises and a search of 
available public records with respect to title. It should be appar-
ent, however, that the most meticulous inspection and the search 
would not reveal the presence of poltergeists at the premises or 
unearth the property’s ghoulish reputation in the community. 
Justice Rubin
Plaintiff, to his horror, discovered that the house he had re-
cently contracted to purchase was widely reputed to be pos-
sessed by poltergeists, reportedly seen by defendant seller 
and members of her family on numerous occasions over the 
last nine years. Plaintiff promptly commenced this action 
seeking rescission of the contract of sale.
 
The unusual facts of this case clearly warrant a grant of 
equitable relief to the buyer who, as a resident of New York 
City, cannot be expected to have any familiarity with the folk-
lore of the Village of Nyack. Not being a “local,” plaintiff 
could not readily learn that the home he had contracted to 
purchase is haunted. Whether the source of the spectral 
 apparitions seen by defendant seller are parapsychic or psy-
chogenic, having reported their presence in both a national 
publication (Readers’ Digest) and the local press (in 1977 and 
1982,  respectively), defendant is estopped to deny their exist-
ence and, as a matter of law, the house is haunted. More to 
the point, however, no divination is required to conclude that 
it is defendant’s promotional efforts in publicizing her close 
encounters with these spirits which fostered the home’s 
reputation in the community. In 1989, the house was included 
in five-home walking tour of Nyack and described in a 
 November 27th newspaper article as “a riverfront Victorian 
(with ghost).” The impact of the reputation thus created goes 
to the very essence of the bargain between the parties, 
greatly impairing both the value of the property and its poten-
tial for resale.
 
While I agree that the real estate broker, as agent for the 
seller, is under no duty to disclose to a potential buyer the 
phantasmal reputation of the premises and that, in his pursuit 
of a legal remedy for fraudulent misrepresentation against the 
seller, plaintiff hasn’t a ghost of a chance, I am nevertheless 
moved by the spirit of equity to allow the buyer to seek rescis-
sion of the contract of sale and recovery of his down payment. 
New York law fails to recognize any remedy for damages 
 incurred as a result of the seller’s mere silence, applying in-
stead the strict rule of caveat emptor. Therefore, the theoreti-
cal  basis for granting relief, even under the extraordinary facts 
of this case, is elusive if not ephemeral.
 
From the perspective of a person in the position of plain-
tiff herein, a very practical problem arises with respect to 
the  discovery of a paranormal phenomenon: “Who you 
gonna’ call?” as a title song to the movie “Ghostbusters” 
asks. Applying the strict rule of caveat emptor to a contract 
L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E

250  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Therefore, there is no sound policy reason to deny plaintiff relief 
for failing to discover a state of affairs which the most prudent 
purchaser would not be expected to even contemplate.
* * * * *
 
Where a condition which has been created by the seller 
materially impairs the value of the contract and is pecu-
liarly within the knowledge of the seller or unlikely to be 
discovered by a prudent purchaser exercising due care 
with respect to the subject transaction, nondisclosure con-
stitutes a basis for rescission as a matter of equity. Any 
other outcome places upon the buyer not merely the obliga-
tion to exercise care in his purchase but rather to be omnis-
cient with respect to any fact which may affect the bargain. 
No practical purpose is served by imposing such a burden 
upon a purchaser. To the contrary, it encourages predatory 
business practice. . . .
* * * * *
 
In the case at bar, defendant seller deliberately fostered the 
public belief that her home was possessed. Having undertaken 
to inform the public-at-large, to whom she has no legal relation-
ship, about the supernatural occurrences on her property, she 
may be said to owe no less a duty to her contract vendee. . . . 
Where, as here, the seller not only takes unfair advantage 
of the buyer’s ignorance but has created and perpetuated a 
 condition about which he is unlikely to even inquire, enforce-
ment of the contract (in whole or in part) is offensive to the 
court’s sense of equity. Application of the remedy of rescis-
sion, within the bounds of the narrow exception to the doctrine 
of caveat emptor set forth herein, is entirely appropriate to 
 relieve the unwitting purchaser from the consequences of a 
most unnatural bargain.
 
Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court, New York 
County (Edward H. Lehner, J.), entered April 9, 1990, which dis-
missed the complaint should be modified and the first cause of 
action seeking rescission of the contract reinstated.
DISSENT
Justice Smith (dissenting).
I would affirm the dismissal of the complaint. . . .
* * * * *
“It is settled law in New York State that the seller of real prop-
erty is under no duty to speak when the parties deal at arm’s 
length. The mere silence of the seller, without some act or 
conduct which deceived the purchaser, does not amount to a 
concealment that is actionable as a fraud. . . .”
 
The parties herein were represented by counsel and dealt 
at arm’s length. . . . There is no allegation that defendants, by 
some specific act, other than the failure to speak deceived the 
plaintiff. . . .
 
Finally, if the doctrine of caveat emptor is to be discarded, 
it should be for a reason more substantive than a poltergeist. 
The existence of a poltergeist is no more binding upon the 
 defendants than it is upon this court.
 
Based upon the foregoing, the [lower] court properly dis-
missed the complaint.
Questions
1. a.  According to the court, did the defendant seller engage 
in a fraudulent misrepresentation in failing to disclose 
the “ghostly” condition of her house?
 
b.  The plaintiff won this case on equitable/fairness 
grounds. Explain the court’s reasoning.
 
c.  Do you agree with the court’s equity/fairness reasoning? 
Explain.
 
d.  Did the real estate agent engage in fraud for failing to 
disclose the house’s haunted reputation? Explain.
2. a. What did the court mean by the phrase “caveat emptor?”
 
b.  Why did the court find for the plaintiff buyer, even 
though “caveat emptor” seemed to be the controlling 
law in this situation?
 
c.  Would the buyer have been successful in a misrepre-
sentation claim if the seller had said: “This house is so 
peaceful. We never have any disturbances.”?
 
d.  The defendant seller had fostered the belief that her house 
was haunted. Did that promotional effort by the  defendant 
influence the court’s decision making? Explain.
3. Explain dissenting Justice Smith’s objection to the majority’s 
ruling.
4. In 2007, soon after moving from California into the home 
she had bought in Pennsylvania, Janet Milliken learned 
that previous occupants, Konstantinos Koumboulis and his 
wife, died in an apparent murder/suicide after Koumboulis 
allegedly shot his wife and himself in the house. The sell-
ers, Kathleen and Joseph Jacono, had later bought the 
home in a real estate auction. Milliken filed a complaint 
against the Jaconos and the real estate firms involved in 
her purchase of the house, alleging fraud and misrepre-
sentation for failure to disclose the murder/suicide. Mil-
liken stated in her opening brief that after she and  her 
family had moved into the home, various paranormal 
events had occurred. How should the court rule? Explain. 
See Milliken v. Jacono, 60 A.3d 133 (Pa. 2012).

Chapter Six  Contracts  251
Duress
Sometimes genuine assent is not secured and a contract may be rescinded because one of 
the parties is forced to agree. Fear lies at the heart of a duress claim. The party seeking to 
escape the contract must establish that a wrongful act was threatened or had occurred, 
causing the party to enter the contract out of fear of harm such that free will was precluded. 
Increasingly, courts are also setting aside contracts on the grounds of economic duress. For 
example, suppose you know that one of your regular customers depends on your timely 
delivery of steel to his factory and that he cannot expeditiously find an alternative supply. 
Therefore, you tell your customer that delivery will be delayed until he agrees to pay a 
higher price for the steel. If he agrees, the resulting contract probably could be rescinded 
on the grounds of economic duress.
Undue Influence
Under some circumstances, the first party to an apparent contract can escape its terms by 
demonstrating that the second party so dominated her will that she (the first party) did not 
act independently. These claims are most common in cases involving those who are old or 
infirm and who lose their independence of thought and action to the undue influence of a 
caregiver or adviser.
Toy Yoda
Former Hooters waitress Jodee Berry sued Gulf Coast Wings for not awarding a new 
 Toyota as a prize for her victory in an April 2001 sales contest. Berry alleged that her man-
ager told the waitresses in their Florida Hooters that the server selling the most beer would 
be entered in a drawing (involving other Hooters locations) with the winner receiving a 
new Toyota. At one point during the contest, the manager allegedly said he did not know 
whether the winner would receive a Toyota car, truck, or van, but he did know that the 
 winner would be required to pay registration fees. At the close of the contest, the manager 
told Berry that she had won. He blindfolded her and took her to the restaurant parking lot. 
He laughed when Berry found, not the car she expected, but a doll based on the character 
Yoda in the Star Wars movie (a toy Yoda). Berry did not laugh, but she did sue. The case 
was settled out of court. The terms of that settlement were not disclosed, but Berry’s 
 lawyer did say that she would be able to afford whatever Toyota she wanted.
Questions
1. What contract-based causes of action did Berry bring in this case?
2. Defend Hooters.
3. Make the argument that the Hooters manager never actually made an offer to the waitresses.
4. If an offer was made, how did Berry accept that offer?
5. Make the argument that the offer and acceptance, if they existed, were not supported by 
consideration.

252  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Mistake
Most of us, on taking a new job, operate at least for a time in fear that we will make a 
 mistake. Assume you are new to your job and are preparing a bid that your company will 
submit in hopes of securing the general maintenance contract for a large office building. In 
preparing the bid, you inadvertently submit a final price of $50,000 
rather than $500,000. What happens? Do you lose your job?
In some cases, mistakes involving critical facts can be grounds 
for rescinding contracts. A mutual mistake is one in which both 
parties to the contract are in error about some critical fact. With 
exceptions, either party can rescind those contracts because genuine assent was not 
achieved. Your erroneous bid, however, is a unilateral mistake; that is, only one party to 
the contract made an error. The general rule is that those contracts cannot be  rescinded. 
However, if you are able to show that the other party to the contract knew or should have 
known about your mistake, many courts would allow you to rescind. Certainly you would 
make that argument in this instance because the $50,000 bid presumably is dramatically 
out of line with the other bids and at odds with reasonable business expectations about 
the value of the contract. In cases where an error is made in drafting a contract, and both 
parties are unaware of the error (a mutual mistake), the courts will reform the contract 
rather than void it. That is, the contract will be rewritten to reflect what the parties 
 actually intended.
You inadvertently submit a 
 final price of $50,000 rather 
than $500,000. What happens?
$4,934 Discount on Alitalia?
The Italian national airline, Alitalia, was charging more than $5,000 for trans-Atlantic, 
round-trip, business class airfares in 2006, but by mistake a fare was briefly listed online at 
$66.00. About the same time, Marriott was offering rooms at a New York City hotel for 
$24.90 when the intended price was $249.00. Alitalia honored 509 reservations at an ex-
pected cost of about $2.6 million. Marriott, however, raised the $24.90 rate to the intended 
$249.00. Errors of this kind happen with some frequency in the travel industry.
Questions
1. As a matter of business practice, how would you have dealt with your company’s error 
had you been in charge at Alitalia or Marriott?
2. As a matter of law, was Alitalia or Marriott obligated to honor the low prices?

Legality of Purpose
Having examined agreement, consideration, capacity, and genuineness of assent, we turn 
now to the final requirement for the creation of a binding contract: legality of purpose (see 
Figure 6.2). Illegality refers to bargains to commit a crime or a tort (such as a deal with a 
coworker to embezzle funds from one’s employer); but more broadly, illegality involves 
bargains that are forbidden by statute or violate public policy. We can identify three general 

Chapter Six  Contracts  253
categories of illegal agreements: (1) contracts that violate statutes, (2) contracts that are un-
conscionable, and (3) contracts that violate public policy. In general, the effect of an  illegal 
contract is that it cannot be enforced, and the courts will not provide a remedy if its terms are 
unfulfilled. With exceptions, the parties to illegal deals are left where the courts find them.

Modern Family Contract Feud
On July 24, 2012, cast members of the popular and Emmy Award–winning television 
comedy Modern Family filed a breach of contract lawsuit against producer 20th Century 
Fox, seeking to have their current contracts declared null and void under California law 
prohibiting enforcement of a personal service contract after seven years. Shortly after the 
lawsuit was filed, Fox agreed to enter into new agreements with the cast members, who 
then dropped the lawsuit. If the lawsuit had gone to trial, what issues would have to be 
decided? Who would have won? Explain.
Sources: California Labor Code Sec. 2855; and Joe Flint, “Cast of Modern Family Strikes New Deal,” Los Angeles 
Times, July 27, 2012 [www.latimes.com].
2. Unconscionable contracts. Certain agreements are so thoroughly one-sided that fair-
ness precludes enforcing them. Problems of unconscionability often 
arise in situations in which the bargaining power of one of the 
 parties is much superior to the other—where one can, in effect, 
“twist the arm” or otherwise take advantage of the other. Both the 
common law of contracts and UCC 2-302 give the courts the power 
to modify or refuse to enforce such deals.
3. Public policy. The courts may decline to enforce certain otherwise binding contracts be-
cause to do so would not be in the best interest of the public. For example, an agreement 
between the local convenience stores to charge $5.00 for a gallon of gasoline would be a 
restraint of trade (price fixing) and as such would be contrary to public policy and to anti-
trust laws (see Chapter 10) and thus would be unenforceable.  Similarly, suppose as a 
condition of being hired for a job you must sign an agreement providing that you will not 
Certain agreements are so 
 thoroughly one-sided 
that fairness precludes 
 enforcing them.
1. Contracts violating statutes. As noted, a contract to commit a crime or a tort is illegal and 
unenforceable. The states have also specified certain other agreements that are illegal. 
Those provisions vary from state to state, but they commonly include antigambling 
laws, laws forbidding the conduct of certain kinds of business on Sundays (blue laws), 
laws forbidding usury, and laws forbidding the practice of certain professions (law, real 
estate, hair care) without a license.

254  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
leave your employer to work for one of your employer’s competitors. These noncompete 
clauses (see Chapter 12) are common and may be fully lawful depending largely on 
whether the time and geographic restrictions imposed are reasonable. If unreasonable, the 
courts will either not enforce the clause or will alter it to achieve a fair result.
 
Another commonplace public policy concern is the exculpatory clause, limited liability 
clause, or release. If you participate in any potentially hazardous activity such as attending a 
professional hockey game, whitewater rafting, joining a school field trip, or entering an 
amusement park you may be required to agree to release others of any liability for harm that 
might befall you. If you own or manage a potentially hazardous enterprise such as a water 
slide, bungee tower, or even a health spa, you may try to protect yourself from litigation 
should a customer be hurt by including a release in the customer agreement. Often, such 
agreements are enforceable in the manner of any other contractual provision, but sometimes 
they are not. Many factors can influence that decision, including how sweeping the exculpa-
tion is, whether it was knowingly entered, and the relative bargaining power of the parties. The 
case that follows examines an airline contract clause limiting liability for lost luggage.
Hanson v. America West 
Airlines  
544 F.Supp.2d 1038 (U.S. 
Dist. Ct. Central Dist. Cal. 2008)
 
According to Plaintiff, as soon as he got to San Francisco, 
he went to the baggage counter, spoke to Defendant’s em-
ployee, Leanne Miller (“Miller”), and informed her of the prob-
lem. Miller told him that the airplane with his Head was in 
flight, and could not be checked until it landed in Southern 
California. Plaintiff offered to fly to Southern California to re-
gain his Head, but Miller told him not to do that. According to 
Plaintiff, he informed Miller of the importance and value of the 
Head, and she replied that all efforts would be made to re-
cover the Head and that it would receive “special treatment.”
 
Plaintiff asserts that about 45 minutes later, Miller called 
him with the good news that the Head had been found in 
 Orange County. Plaintiff “remained willing” to go retrieve his 
Head, but Miller replied that it would be sent to San Francisco. 
According to Plaintiff, Miller then informed him of the special 
security procedures that would be taken to protect and deliver 
the Head. Plaintiff told Miller that Plaintiff’s friend Craig Grossman 
would be at the airport to pick up the Head. Grossman waited 
for the Head at the San Francisco airport, but it never arrived 
and has not been found since. While hearts may be left in San 
Francisco, heads apparently are left in Orange County, or are 
simply lost or stolen.
Judge Guilford
BACKGROUND
Plaintiff David Hanson (“Plaintiff”) has lost his head. More spe-
cifically, Plaintiff has lost an artistically and scientifically valu-
able robotic head modeled after famous science fiction author 
Philip K. Dick (“Head”). Dick’s well-known body of work has 
resulted in movies—such as Total Recall, Blade Runner, Minor-
ity Report, and A Scanner Darkly, and a large group of admirers 
has grown following his death in Orange County, California, in 
1982. His stories have questioned whether robots can be human 
so it seems appropriate that Plaintiff reincarnated Dick as a 
 robot which included the Head, valued at around $750,000.
 
Plaintiff lost his Head on one of Defendant’s planes when fly-
ing from Texas to San Francisco with a connection in Las Vegas. 
Plaintiff brought the Head onto the plane in a carry-on duffel bag 
and stored it in the overhead bin. Plaintiff fell asleep during the 
flight from Texas to Las Vegas, and woke up when the plane 
 arrived in Las Vegas. On waking, Plaintiff immediately left the 
plane to catch his connecting flight to San Francisco. Perhaps 
because he had just woken up, Plaintiff lacked the total recall to 
remember to retrieve the Head from the overhead bin.
L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E

 
Plaintiff sued Defendant in California state court for conver-
sion, negligence, and involuntary bailment. Defendant removed 
the case to federal court, and here moves for summary judgment.
ANALYSIS
1. Contractual Liability Limitations
Defendant argues that it contractually limited its liability for 
loss of Plaintiff’s goods. . . .
 
Federal common law allows a carrier to limit its liability for 
lost or damaged goods if the contract limiting liability offers 
the shipper (1) reasonable notice of the limited liability, and 
(2) a fair opportunity to buy higher liability.
* * * * *
 
If the contract states the limited liability provision and a 
means to avoid it, the contract is considered prima facie valid. 
Defendant has satisfied the elements of an enforceable limited 
liability provision under federal common law. The Contract of 
Carriage provides that “liability of loss, delay, or damage to 
baggage is limited as follows unless a higher value is declared 
in advance and additional charges are paid.” The contract 
later provides that the monetary limit is “USD 2,800.00 per tick-
eted passenger for checked baggage.” More specifically for 
this case, the Contract of Carriage provides that Defendant 
“assumes no responsibility or liability for baggage, or other items, 
carried in the passenger compartment of the aircraft.” Plaintiff 
admits that he was aware of the limited liability provision. Thus, 
Defendant provided Plaintiff with reasonable notice of limited 
liability and a fair opportunity to buy higher liability.
2. Plaintiff’s Arguments
Plaintiff argues that Defendant is liable for the lost head  because 
(1) there was a material deviation from the Contract of Carriage 
and (2) Plaintiff’s discussion with Miller altered the terms of the 
original Contract of Carriage or created a new contract.
2.1 Material Deviation Doctrine
* * * * *
[T]he material deviation doctrine states that where a carrier 
effects a fundamental breach of a contract by materially devi-
ating from the contract’s terms, the carrier is liable for damage 
to or loss of the shipped goods. Cases have further defined the 
boundaries of this doctrine. For example, in Nipponkoa Ins. 
Co., Ltd., v. Watkins Motor Lines, Inc., 431 F.Supp.2d 411 
(S.D.N.Y. 2006), a carrier promised to take special measures to 
protect a shipment of laptop computers, including using high 
security locks and video surveillance. The court found that the 
carrier breached that promise by failing to use either high se-
curity locks or video surveillance. The court held that the car-
rier was responsible for the loss of the computers under the 
material deviation doctrine. The court explained that the doc-
trine applies when a carrier breaches a “separate, risk-related 
promise” about the shipment of goods. The court emphasized 
that the agreement was specific and that the carrier deviated 
from the expressly agreed-upon security measures.
* * * * *
 
The Ninth Circuit has limited the material deviation 
 doctrine. In Vision Air, for example, a carrier destroyed two 
trucks by using an inadequate pulley system to transport them. 
Vision Air, 155 F.3d at 1167–68. The Ninth Circuit held that even 
if that behavior constituted gross negligence or recklessness, 
it did not constitute a material deviation. “[W]e reject the 
 notion that mere negligence may constitute an unreasonable 
deviation . . . we reject the notion that gross negligence or 
recklessness may constitute an unreasonable deviation.” The 
court emphasized that only “more culpable misconduct” could 
be considered a deviation.
 
In the cases just discussed, the courts focused on the actual 
express terms of the agreement, showing that the material devia-
tion doctrine applies only when the shipper makes a “separate, 
risk-related promise,” and then breaches that promise.
 
With these boundaries, Plaintiff’s argument that Defendant 
materially deviated from the original Contract of Carriage fails. 
There were no provisions in the original Contract of Carriage 
directly concerning transporting the Head. Indeed, the original 
Contract of Carriage declaimed any responsibility for carry-on 
baggage. Further, nothing in the original Contract of Carriage 
made provisions for travelers leaving baggage on the airplane. 
Thus, Defendant did not breach a “separate, risk-related 
promise” in the original Contract of Carriage, and is not liable 
under this theory.
2.2 Altered or New Contractual Terms and Agency Law
Plaintiff also argues that Miller either altered the terms of the 
original Contract of Carriage or created a new contract with 
Plaintiff, and that Defendant is liable under the new or altered 
contract.
 
Agents can bind their principals only if they have actual or 
apparent authority to do so. Actual authority may be either ex-
press or implied. If a principal specifically authorizes an agent 
to act, the agent has express authority to take that action. If a 
principle “merely states the general nature of what the agent 
is to do, the agent is said to have implied authority to do acts 
consistent with the direction.”
 
Miller did not have express authority to contract with 
Plaintiff. The original Contract of Carriage provided that:
No employee of U.S. Airways has the authority to waive, 
modify, or alter any provisions of these terms of 
Chapter Six  Contracts  255

256  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
transportation or any applicable fares/charges unless 
authorized by a corporate officer of U.S. Airways. U.S. 
Airways-appointed agents and representatives are only 
authorized to sell tickets for air transportation on U.S. 
Airways pursuant to the terms of transportation and 
applicable fares/charges of U.S. Airways.
There is no evidence that Miller was either a corporate officer 
of Defendant or that she was authorized by such an officer to 
modify the terms of transportation. Thus, under the Contract of 
Carriage, Miller had no express authority either to change the 
terms of the contract or to create a new contract. Indeed, Miller 
had express authority only to “sell tickets for air transportation.” 
Likewise, there is no evidence that Miller had implied authority.
 
The Contract of Carriage also leads to the conclusion that 
Miller had no apparent authority to change the terms of the 
contract or to create a new contract. “Apparent authority 
 results when the principal does something or permits the 
agent to do something which reasonably leads another to be-
lieve that the agent had the authority he purported to have.” 
Hawaiian Paradise Park Corp., 414 F.2d at 756 (9th Cir. 1969). 
Only the acts of the principal, not of the agent, give rise to ap-
parent authority. Plaintiff argues that Miller’s station behind a 
desk near the baggage claim area led Plaintiff to reasonably 
believe that Miller had the authority to make contracts for the 
delivery of lost baggage. The Court disagrees.
 
Plaintiff is a frequent flyer and was aware of the applicable 
tariffs. Thus, before he lost his Head and spoke with Miller, he 
was aware of the tariff limiting Miller’s authority. Aware of that 
tariff, he could not reasonably conclude, based on Miller’s po-
sition behind a desk, that she suddenly had authority to con-
tract with him.
* * * * *
 
Plaintiff cannot rely on representations altering the con-
tract or creating a new contract when those representations 
were made by someone whose authority had been expressly 
limited by contract. The Court must find that Miller had neither 
actual nor apparent authority to either alter the Contract of 
Carriage or create a new contract.
2.3 Even Under the New Terms Alleged, Liability Has Not 
Been Established
Even if Miller had authority to alter the Contract of Carriage or 
create a new contract, Defendant would still not be liable for the 
lost Head because there is no evidence that Defendant 
breached the contract even under the new terms alleged. Plain-
tiff alleges new terms that provided for tagging and boxing the 
Head, informing everyone of the value, and scheduling the Head 
on the next flight. But Plaintiff presents no evidence that such 
terms were breached. Instead, Plaintiff offers theories of 
 Defendant’s potential conduct, such as, “potentially informing 
the wrong crew of the value of the HEAD” and “potentially in-
forming the thief of the high value of the HEAD.” These theories, 
while heady, are insufficient.
 
At best, Plaintiff’s theory is that, since the Head did not arrive 
at its destination, Defendants must have done something wrong. 
This is not evidence of a breach or material deviation. Defendant 
may have done everything as promised, only to fall victim to a 
head hunting thief or other skullduggery. Alternatively, Defendant 
could have been negligent, and still not have committed a funda-
mental breach. The possibility of such negligence is “considered 
an inherent risk of shipping.” Information Control, 73 Cal. App. 3d 
at 641. Thus, even if Plaintiff’s discussion with Miller altered or 
created a new contract, there is no evidence establishing 
 Defendant’s liability based on breach or material deviation.
CONCLUSION
Philip K. Dick and other science fiction luminaries have often 
 explored whether robots might eventually evolve to exercise free-
dom of choice. But there is no doubt that humans have the free-
dom of choice to bind themselves in mutually advantageous 
 contractual relationships. When Plaintiff chose to enter the 
 Contract of  Carriage with Defendant he agreed, among other 
things, to limit Defendant’s liability for lost baggage. Failing to show 
that he is entitled to relief from that agreement, Plaintiff is bound 
by the terms of that contract, which bars his state law claims.
 
The Court must GRANT Defendant’s Motion. But it does so 
hoping that the android head of Mr. Dick is someday found, 
perhaps in an Elysian field of Orange County, Dick’s homeland, 
choosing to dream of electric sheep.
Questions
1. As a matter of law, why did America West win this case?
2. Why was this Contract of Carriage not considered unfair 
and one-sided and thus unenforceable?
3. Why did America West’s behavior not constitute a “material 
deviation” from the Contract of Carriage?
4. Ning Yan went to Gay’s fitness center to use a one-week 
complimentary pass. On each visit he signed in on a sheet 
that contained a standard exculpatory clause including this 
language: “I also understand that Vital Power Fitness Center 
assumes no responsibility for any injuries and/or sicknesses 
incurred to me. . . .“ On February 18, 1999, Yan fell from a 
treadmill and sustained a severe head injury. He later died 
from that injury. No one witnessed the fall. Yan’s estate 
claims he struck his head against a window ledge because 
the treadmill was placed too close to the window. If he did 
strike the window ledge, who would likely win this case? 
 Explain. See Xu v. Gay, 668 N.W.2d 166 (Ct. App. Mich. 2003).

Chapter Six  Contracts  257
In May 2010, British Petroleum (BP) oil company was in the 
midst of frantic efforts to stop the oil flowing into the Gulf of 
Mexico from its doomed Macondo 252 well while also try-
ing to clean up the immense quantity that escaped after 
the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling vessel. 
“Several hundred” shrimpers, oyster harvesters, and oth-
ers making their living from the Gulf signed contracts with 
BP to work as paid volunteers in the cleanup process. 
Among the provisions in those contracts were promises by 
the volunteers not to file legal claims against the oil com-
pany should they sustain damages of any kind in the 
cleanup process. The provisions, which many of those 
signing may not have fully understood, included promises 
not to sue in case of accident or injury and not to talk to 
anyone about the disaster or cleanup without BP approval. 
Those provisions also required a 30-day notice before pur-
suing legal claims against BP, even in the event of an 
emergency. Reportedly, BP also expected workers to add 
the oil giant to their personal insurance policies so that 
worker injuries or damages would fall to each worker’s in-
surance rather than to BP. Commercial fisherman and 
United Commercial Fisherman’s Association president, 
George Barisich, filed suit to block enforcement of the 
 restrictive promises and U.S. District Judge Helen 
 Berrigan ruled the offending provisions were overbroad 
and “unconscionable” and declared them null and void. BP 
and the Fisherman’s Association soon reached an agree-
ment removing the waiver language and agreeing not to 
enforce those provisions in contracts already signed. BP 
officials said the provisions were a “mistake,” and they or-
dered the provisions removed as soon as they learned 
about them.
Questions
1. a.  Were BP’s protective provisions “wrong” as a matter 
of ethical business practice? Explain.
 
b.  If you were a boss or lawyer at BP, would you have 
included those protective provisions? Explain.
2. a.  If you were a boss and you knew you could compel 
an employee to accept a pay cut in order to  enhance 
an already healthy bottom line, would you do so? 
Explain.
 
b.  In your personal life, do you think you have made 
agreements with friends that were  “one-sided” and 
“unconscionable” because of your possession of 
superior leverage of some kind?
 
c. If so, were you “wrong” to do so. Explain.

Part Two—Interpreting and Enforcing Contracts
We have examined the five ingredients in a binding contract: agreement, consideration, 
capacity, genuineness of assent, and legality of purpose. Having established those condi-
tions, a contract may have been created, but the door to contract problems has not been 
closed. Contracts sometimes must fulfill writing formalities to be enforceable. Third par-
ties may have claims against some contracts. And what happens when a party to a contract 
does not perform as called for by the agreement?
In Writing?
Certainly a common belief is that agreements must be in writing to 
be enforceable; but in most cases, oral contracts are fully enforcea-
ble. The exceptions, however, are important. Oral contracts are

subject to misunderstanding or to being forgotten, and fraudulent claims can readily arise 
from oral understandings. Consequently, our states have drawn on the English Statute of 
Frauds in specifying that the following kinds of contracts, in most cases, must be in writ-
ing to be enforceable:
1. Collateral contract. Assume you have just graduated from college, and you want to 
get started in a small printing business. You secure a bank loan on the condition that you 
find a creditworthy third party as a guarantor for the loan. Jacobs, a family friend, agrees 
with the bank to pay the debt if you fail to do so. Jacobs’ promise to pay the debt must be 
in writing to be enforceable.
2. The sale of land. Broadly, land is interpreted to include the surface itself, that 
which is in the soil (minerals) or permanently attached to it (buildings), and growing crops 
when accompanying the transfer of land. Thus, if a building was permanently attached to a 
lot you seek for the aforementioned printing business, that building would need to be in-
cluded in the written contract, but if you contracted to have a building constructed on your 
lot, you would not need (at least for the purposes of the Statute of Frauds) to execute a 
written agreement with the building contractor because you would not be contracting for 
an interest in land. A long-term lease (normally more than one year) for that land and 
building would, in most states, need to be in writing. All of these principles simply reflect 
the special role of land in our view of wealth and freedom.
3. Promises that cannot be performed within one year. This requirement springs 
from a concern about faulty memories, deaths, and other impediments to the satisfactory 
conclusion of long-term contracts. The courts have interpreted this provision narrowly, in 
effect saying that such a contract need not be in writing if it is possible, according to its 
terms, to perform it within one year from the day of its creation. It follows then that a con-
tract for an indefinite period (such as an employment contract “for the balance of the em-
ployee’s life”) need not be in writing to be enforceable. (It is possible that the employee 
will die within one year.)
4. Contracts for the sale of goods at a price of $500 or more. With exceptions, 
under both the English-derived Statute of Frauds and UCC 2-201, contracts for the sale of 
goods (having a value of $500 or more under the UCC) must be in writing to be enforce-
able. Under the UCC, informal writing will suffice so long as it indicates that a contract 
was made, it contains a quantity term, and it was signed “by the party against whom en-
forcement is sought.” Section 2-201 provides exceptions for certain transactions of $500 
or more in goods in which a contract will be enforceable even though not in writing.
5. Contracts in consideration of marriage. The mutual exchange of marriage 
promises need not be in writing, but any contract that uses marriage as the consideration to 
support the contract must be in writing to be enforceable. Such contracts would include, 
for example, prenuptial agreements that are entered prior to marriage and serve the pur-
pose, among others, of specifying how the couple’s property will be divided in the event of 
a divorce. Those contracts must be in writing to be enforceable.
6. Executor/administrator’s promise. When an individual dies, a representative is 
 appointed to oversee the estate. A promise by that executor/administrator to pay the 
 estate’s debts must be in writing if the payment will be made from the executor/ 
administrator’s  personal funds. Thus, where the executor of an estate contracts with an 

Chapter Six  Contracts  259
Failure to Comply A fully performed oral contract, even though not in compliance with 
the Statute of Frauds, will not be rescinded by the courts. However, incomplete oral con-
tracts that fail to comply with the statute are unenforceable. If a party to an unenforceable 
oral contract has provided partial performance in reliance on the contract, the courts will 
ordinarily provide compensation under quasi-contract principles for the reasonable value 
of that performance. [For more on the Statute of Frauds, see www.expertlaw.com/library/
business/statute_of_frauds.html]
The Parol Evidence Rule
Suppose you are the purchasing manager for a large manufacturer. You entered a written 
contract for 50 new personal computers. During negotiations, the seller said they would 
“throw in” 10 new printers if they got the computer order, but you failed to include a provi-
sion for the printers in the contract. Is your boss about to have a fit? Perhaps, because you 
probably will not be able to introduce evidence of that oral understanding to alter the terms 
of the written contract. In general, whenever a contract has been reduced to writing with 
the intent that the writing represents a complete and final integration of the parties’ inten-
tions, none of the parties can introduce parol evidence (oral or written words outside the 
“four corners” of the agreement) to add to, change, or contradict that contract when that 
evidence was expressed/created at the time of or prior to the writing. The written agree-
ment is presumed to be the best evidence of the parties’ intentions at the time they entered 
the contract. (The parol evidence rule under UCC section 2-202 is essentially the same as 
the common-law provisions discussed here.)
Exceptions Parol evidence may be admissible under the following exceptional  circumstances:
1. To add missing terms to an incomplete written contract.
2. To explain ambiguities in a written contract.
E-mail Exchanges and Statute  of Frauds
The Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, widely adopted by state legislatures, gives elec-
tronic records and signatures the same legal power as paper documents and manually signed 
signatures. Under Tennessee’s adoption of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, attor-
neys’ exchange of e-mails setting forth proposed settlement terms to resolve a family dispute 
over the ownership of a parcel of land was determined to create a signed, binding agreement, 
satisfying the state’s Statute of Frauds. See Waddle v. Elrod, 367 S.W.3d 217 (Tenn. 2012).

Frauds? Explain.

Contract’s Terms: Paper versus Website?
Fadal Machining Centers, a machine and machine parts manufacturer, sued Compumachine, 
one of its distributors, for breach of contract. Under the distributorship agreement, a hard 
copy of which was attached to Fadal’s complaint, any legal action arising out of the contract 
would be heard in a California federal district court. The agreement also stated that Fadal 
could establish the terms of sale on occasion. Each of the fifteen allegedly unpaid invoices 
referred to Fadal’s website for the terms and conditions of sale. The terms found on the web-
site under the label “Contract” in large bold type, included an arbitration clause and a state-
ment that they would prevail over any other agreement. Should Fadal’s claim be heard in the 
California federal district court, or be submitted to arbitration? Decide and explain.

Third Parties
We turn now to the rights and duties of those who are not parties to a contract but hold le-
gally recognizable interests in that contract. Those interests arise when (1) contract rights 
are assigned to others, (2) contract duties are delegated to others, or (3) contracts have 
third-party beneficiary provisions.
Assignment of Rights
Ordinarily, a party to a contract is free to transfer her or his rights under the contract to a 
third party. Thus, if Ames owes Jones $500 for work performed, Jones can assign that right 
to Smith, who can now assert her right to collect against Ames. That transfer of rights is 
labeled an assignment (see Figure 6.3). Jones, the party making the transfer, is the as-
signor; Smith, the one receiving the right, is the assignee; and Ames, the party who must 
perform, is the obligor. Ames, the obligor, must now perform the contract for the benefit of 
the assignee; that is, Ames must pay the $500 to Smith. The completed assignment then 
extinguishes the assignor’s rights under the contract.

Some contracts are not assignable without consent of the obligor. That would be the 
case where the obligor’s duties are materially altered by the assignment. For example, if 
you have a contract to serve as a personal fitness trainer for a busy chief executive officer, 
your contract could not be assigned without your consent to another CEO, or movie star, or 
the like because the highly personal and specific obligations under the contract would nec-
essarily be materially altered with a different client.
Delegation of Duties
The parties to a contract may also delegate their duties under the contract to one or more third 
parties. Assume Allen has secured a contract to install windows in Boyd’s new office building 
(see Figure 6.4). Allen could delegate that duty to another contractor, Harms (although Allen 
would more commonly simply enter a subcontracting arrangement without actually transfer-
ring the underlying contract). A delegation of duty leaves Harms, the delegatee (the one to 
whom the duty is delegated), primarily responsible for performance; but Allen, the obligor/
delegator (the one who made the delegation), remains secondarily liable in case Harms, the 
delegatee, fails to fulfill the duty to Boyd, the obligee (the one to whom the duty is owed under 
both the original contract and the delegation). As with the assignment of rights, some contrac-
tual duties, particularly those of a personal service nature, cannot be delegated without consent.
Third-Party Beneficiary Contracts
Normally, those not a party to a contract have no rights under that contract. As we have seen, 
however, third parties may be assigned rights or delegated duties under a contract. A third party 
may also enforce a contract where that contract was expressly intended to benefit the third 
party. An agreement of that nature is a third-party beneficiary contract. Third-party beneficiar-
ies are of three kinds: creditor, donee, and incidental. In general, creditor and donee beneficiar-
ies can enforce contracts made by others for their benefit; incidental beneficiaries cannot do so.
Creditor Beneficiary Assume you decide to expand your used-car business by advertising on 
television. Your ads appear on TV; therefore, you owe the local television station $2,000. 
Rather than paying the bill directly, you transfer a used car to your friend Gleason, with the 
understanding that he will pay off your bill with the television station. Thus, the station be-
comes the creditor beneficiary of the contract between you and Gleason, and the station can sue 
Gleason for that money if necessary while you remain secondarily responsible for the payment.

262  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Donee Beneficiary When the promisee’s primary purpose in entering a contract is to 
make a gift to another, that third party is a donee beneficiary of the contract. The most 
common of these situations involves an ordinary life insurance policy for which the 
owner (the promisee) pays premiums to the life insurance company (the promisor), which 
is obliged to pay benefits to the third party upon the death of the promisee/ policy owner. 
If necessary, the third-party beneficiary can sue the insurance company for payment.
Incidental Beneficiary Often a third party receives benefit from a contract although 
conferring that benefit was not the contracting parties’ primary purpose or intent. For 
example, assume a General Motors car dealer enters into a contract to buy land adja-
cent to your used-car lot for the purpose of opening a large dealership. You would 
benefit immensely from the spillover effect of the large, adjacent dealership. In such a 
situation, you would be an incidental beneficiary of the land sale contract because that 
contract was not intended for your benefit. If the landowner or the GM dealer failed 
to perform, you, as an incidental beneficiary, would have no legal rights against either 
of them.
 
The case that follows involves a third-party claim by Gill Plumbing against its subcon-
tractor, Jimenez. The dispute arose out of a dormitory construction contract where the 
general contractor, Gilbane Building, had hired Gill to do the dormitory plumbing and 
Gill, in turn, had hired Jimenez to install some portion of that plumbing.
Jimenez v. Gilbane Building 
Company, et al. 
693 S.E.2d 126 (Ga. Ct. App. 2010)
filed a fourth-party action against Jimenez. The parties have 
since been realigned. Currently, both Belfor and Gilbane 
have claims against Gill Plumbing, and Gill Plumbing has a 
third-party claim against Jimenez for the costs of the reme-
diation and repair.
 
In its third-party claim, Gill Plumbing asserts that it had a 
written agreement with Jimenez that included an indemnity 
agreement, and that the damages to the dormitory resulted 
from negligent work performed by Jimenez. Jimenez denied 
that he entered into a valid and enforceable contract or an 
indemnity agreement with Gill Plumbing and denied the neg-
ligence. The trial court granted Gill’s motion for partial sum-
mary judgment against Jimenez, finding that he was liable 
“for indemnification to Gill Plumbing” “in the amount, if any, 
of damages proven to have resulted from Mr. Jimenez’s 
 defective work.” Jimenez appeals this ruling and contends 
that “no contract existed between Mr. Jimenez and the

Judge Adams
The background facts are that Gilbane Building Company 
was the general contractor for the construction of a new 
dormitory at Georgia Southern University. Gilbane hired Gill 
Plumbing as the plumbing contractor, and Gill Plumbing, in 
turn, hired Jose Alfredo Jimenez to perform plumbing instal-
lation work. The building was completed in July 2005, but in 
October, after the dormitory was occupied by students, a 
pipe failed causing extensive water damage to the dormitory 
and to some students’ personal belongings. Gilbane was 
forced to hire Belfor USA Group, Inc., to perform remediation 
and repair work. Belfor’s $990,060.63 bill for the services has 
not been paid.
 
Belfor filed this action against Gilbane, Gilbane filed a 
third-party action against Gill Plumbing, and Gill Plumbing

 Appellee as a matter of law” or, at least, that there are mate-
rial issues of fact regarding the contract and the indemnity 
agreement.
 
Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine is-
sue of material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a 
matter of law. . . .
 
There is no question that the parties had an oral agree-
ment. The issue before us is whether there was an enforcea-
ble written agreement and, if so, what were the terms of that 
agreement. The undisputed facts show that Jimenez was 
hired by Gill Plumbing to perform plumbing services in the 
 “Eagle Village” construction project at Georgia Southern 
 University, that he performed plumbing services, and that he 
has been paid for the work in the amount of $167,000.
 
Jimenez has never worked for any company other than Gill 
Plumbing and the two have worked together for at least 15 years. 
On September 15, 2004, Jimenez signed two documents, 
which, Gill Plumbing contends, constitute the parties’ entire 
written agreement; Jimenez has signed other documents for 
Gill Plumbing in the past. The first document is contained on 
one page, it is dated September 15, 2004, and it has Jimenez’s 
typewritten name and his signature. The main body of the 
document is as follows:

(Emphasis supplied.) Jimenez’s signature appears below 
the following words, which are written on the side of the 
above chart:

I certify the work for which above payment is requested 
has been completed according to the plans and 
specifications and in compliance with the terms of our 
contract and all labor and material bills applicable to 
this job have been paid to date and that Federal income, 
social security, and unemployment taxes have been 
withheld and will be paid when due on all employees 
employed by me on this job.
_____________/s/_____________ CONTRACTOR
Notably, this first document does not name Gill Plumbing 
anywhere, and the “affidavit” is written in the past tense, as 
if the project had already been completed, but as of the 
date on the document, Jimenez’s work at Eagle Village had 
not begun. The second document—“Exhibit A”—is two 
pages long, and it begins as follows:
INSURANCE AND INDEMNITY SUBCONTRACTOR 
AGREEMENT
The Work performed by the Subcontractor shall be at the 
risk of the Subcontractor exclusively. To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, Subcontractor shall indemnify, 
defend (at Subcontractor’s sole expense) and hold 
harmless Contractor, the Owner (if different from 
Contractor), affiliated companies of Contractor, . . . 
from and against any and all claims for . . . damage to 
property . . . which arise or are in any way connected 
with the Work performed, Materials furnished, or 
Services provided under this Agreement by 
Subcontractor or its agents. . . .
The exhibit goes on to require the “Subcontractor” to ob-
tain commercial general liability insurance in the amount of 
$1,000,000, and to meet other related requirements. The ex-
hibit is signed by Jimenez on the second page over the 
word “Subcontractor,” but it is not dated. Also, the docu-
ment does not include Gill Plumbing’s name anywhere. 
 Finally, Jimenez never performed any work at Eagle Village 
that could be called “Set Out” as stated on page one of the 
document.
 
Jimenez contends the three-page document is not an en-
forceable agreement because it does not state who the other 
party is or mention Gill Plumbing’s name; it does not include 
a promise by Gill Plumbing, or anyone else, to pay him; it 
does not specify the location or address where the work is to 
be performed; it leaves several terms undefined; it does not 
specify the time for performance; it does not direct Jimenez 
to  perform any work at all; and although it mentions addi-
tional documents, none are attached or defined. He argues 
the  “sub-labor affidavit” found on page one of the document 

264  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
is written in the past tense, suggesting that the work was 
 already completed when, in fact, it had not begun as of the 
only date indicated on the document. He also complains that 
the indemnification provision fails to identify who should be 
indemnified and that it fails to define the terms “subcontractor,” 
“contractor,” or “owner.” Finally, Jimenez contends he can-
not read or communicate well in English and he did not know 
what he signed.
In Georgia,
The first requirement of the law relative to contracts is that 
there must be a meeting of the minds of the parties, and 
mutuality, and in order for the contract to be valid the 
agreement must ordinarily be expressed plainly and 
explicitly enough to show what the parties agreed upon. A 
contract cannot be enforced in any form of action if its 
terms are incomplete or incomprehensible.
 
Bagwell-Hughes, Inc. v. McConnell, 224 Ga. 659, 
661–662 (164 SE2d 229) (1968). But “[a]n objection of 
indefiniteness may be obviated by performance on the 
part of one party and the acceptance of the performance 
by the other.” Aukerman v. Witmer, 256 Ga. App. 211, 216 
(1) (568 SE2d 123) (2002). Nevertheless, performance as a 
cure has its limits:
 
Performance does not cure the deficiencies in an 
agreement that is so vague, indefinite, and uncertain “as 
to make it impossible for courts to determine what, if 
anything, was agreed upon, therefore rendering it 
impossible to determine whether there had been 
performance.”
 
Razavi v. Shackelford, 260 Ga. App. 603, 605 (1) (580 
SE2d 253) (2003).
Here, the attendant and surrounding circumstances show that 
Jimenez entered into an agreement with Gill Plumbing, that he 
performed work, and that he was paid by Gill Plumbing. The 
three-page document shows that the work was to be performed 
on the “Eagle Village” project; it stated the amount to be paid for 
each phase of the work, and the total equaled the amount that 
Jimenez was paid for the work. And Jimenez attended weekly 
safety meetings. Thus, there is some evidence of performance 
consistent with the three-page document. But there is also evi-
dence of performance that is inconsistent with the three-page 
document. Jimenez did not perform some of the work listed in 
the document, and the document suggests that the work had 
already been completed when the document was signed.
 
In addition, the document is ambiguous at best, and the 
rules of construction do not resolve the ambiguity. Jimenez is 
identified as the “subcontractor” in the indemnification agree-
ment, which provides that he is to identify the “contractor” and 
others. Yet, the first page of the three page document identifies 
Jimenez as the “contractor,” suggesting that he should indem-
nify himself. And there are two contractors who are parties to 
the lawsuit and other contractors on the entire project.
* * * * *
 
Here, among other problems, it is impossible to tell from 
the terms of the written document who Jimenez may have 
promised to indemnify, and that fact has not been made 
 sufficiently clear by either the rules of construction or any 
 performance under the agreement. The trial court erred by 
granting partial summary judgment in favor of Gill Plumbing on 
the purported indemnification agreement. Jury issues remain 
on the terms of the parties’ agreement.
 
Judgment reversed.
Questions
1. Explain what the trial court meant in finding that Jimenez 
was liable “for indemnification to Gill Plumbing” “in the 
amount, if any, of damages proven to have resulted from 
Mr. Jimenez’s defective work.”
2. Why did the court conclude that Gill did not have an 
 enforceable agreement with Jiminez?
3. Why did the appeals court overturn the trial court’s 
 summary judgment?
Discharge
At some point, obligations under a contract come to an end. When that moment arrives, we 
say the duties of the contracting parties have been discharged. In this section, we examine 
some of the methods of contract discharge. Discharge can occur in many ways, but the 
most important of these are (1) conditions, (2) performance or breach, (3) lawful excuses, 
(4) agreement, and (5) by operation of law.

Chapter Six  Contracts  265
Discharge by Conditions
Sometimes a contract is useful to one or more of the contracting parties only if some 
future event occurs or fails to occur. Under those circumstances, the parties may write 
into the contract a clause providing that performance is required only if the specified 
condition  occurs or fails to occur. Otherwise, the duty to perform is discharged. Those 
conditions take three forms: conditions precedent, conditions subsequent, and condi-
tions concurrent.
Conditions Precedent A conditions precedent clause specifies that an event must occur 
before the parties to the contract are obliged to perform. Assume you are attempting to 
establish a business booking rock-and-roll acts for performances. 
You sign a deal with the rock group Passion Pit, providing for a 
performance “contingent upon obtaining satisfactory lease arrange-
ments for the university field house within 14 days.” If you are un-
able to achieve an acceptable lease, both parties are discharged from performance 
requirements under the contract.
Conditions Subsequent A conditions subsequent clause excuses performance if a future 
event transpires. Thus, in the Passion Pit example, the band might include a clause provid-
ing that the agreement will be null and void if any member of the band is ill or otherwise 
unable to perform on the contracted evening. Hence in a contract with a condition subse-
quent the parties have bound themselves to perform unless a specified event occurs; 
whereas in a contract with a condition precedent the parties have no binding duties until 
the specified event occurs.
Conditions Concurrent Here the contract simply specifies that the parties are to perform 
their duties at the same time. Each performance is dependent on the other. So if Passion Pit 
performs as contracted, you have a simultaneous duty to pay for the band’s performance. 
Your duty to pay is conditioned on Passion Pit’s performance and vice versa.
Express or Implied Conditions Another way of classifying the aforementioned  conditions 
is to treat them either as express or implied. Express conditions are those explicitly agreed to 
by the parties, as in the situation where you, a concert promoter, expressly conditioned 
 performance on your ability to secure the university field house for the concert. Express 
 conditions are often prefaced by words such as when, if,  provided, and so forth.
 
Implied-in-fact conditions are not explicitly stated in the contract but are derived by the 
court from the conduct of the parties and the circumstances surrounding the bargain. Sup-
pose you contract to remove snow from your neighbor’s driveway during the winter. An 
implied-in-fact condition of your neighbor’s duty to pay would be that you would com-
plete the work within a reasonable period.
 
Implied-in-law conditions (also called constructive conditions) are those that, although 
not expressly provided for in the contract or not able to be reasonably inferred from the 
facts, the court imposes on the contract to avoid unfairness. Hence, if you contracted to put 
a new roof on your neighbor’s house but your written contract did not include a date for 
payment, the court might imply a contract clause providing that your neighbor need not 
pay you until the job is complete.
You sign a deal with the rock 
group Passion Pit.

266  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Discharge by Performance or by Breach of Contract
Complete performance is, of course, the normal way of discharging a contract. Failure to 
fully perform without a lawful excuse for that failure results in a breach of contract. The 
consequences of both full performance and breach of contract can be described in four parts.
Complete Performance—No Breach of Contract Here we find the most common 
method of discharge—the situation in which the parties simply do precisely what the con-
tract calls for: pay $500, provide a particular product, present the deed for a piece of land, 
and so on. When fully performed, a contract has been executed.
Substantial Performance—Nonmaterial Breach of Contract In some cases complete 
performance is not achieved because of minor deviations from the agreed-on perfor-
mance. Most notably in construction contracts and in many personal or professional ser-
vice contracts, the courts have recognized the doctrine of substantial performance. For 
example, assume a contractor painted a house as agreed, except that he replaced the Ben-
jamin Moore paint called for in the contract with a Sherwin-Williams paint of comparable 
quality. Assuming the variation has not materially altered the end product and assuming 
that the variation was not the result of bad faith, the court will enforce the contract as writ-
ten, but require a deduction for any damages sustained as a consequence of the imperfect 
performance.
Unacceptable Performance—Material Breach of Contract When a party falls beneath 
substantial performance and does not have a lawful excuse for that failure, a material 
breach of contract has occurred. No clear line separates substantial performance (a non-
material breach) from unacceptable performance (a material breach). Such decisions must 
be made case by case. We can say that material breaches are those that fall short of what 
the nonbreaching party should reasonably expect—that is, full performance in some cases 
and substantial performance in others. A material breach discharges the nonbreaching 
party’s duties and permits that party to sue for damages or rescind the contract and seek 
restitution.
Whose Ring?
Barry Meyer and Robyn Mitnick became engaged on August 9, 1996, at which time Barry 
gave Robyn a custom-designed, $19,500 engagement ring. On November 8, 1996, Barry 
asked Robyn to sign a prenuptial agreement, but Robyn refused. The parties agree the 
 engagement ended at that point, but they each blame the other for the breakup. Robyn did 
not return the ring, and Barry sued for its return.
Questions
1. Explain each party’s argument using contract principles.
2. Does it matter who was “at fault” in the breakup? Explain.
3. Who gets the ring? Explain.
Source: Meyer v. Mitnick, 625 N.W.2d 136 (Ct. App. Mich. 2001).

Chapter Six  Contracts  267
Advance Refusal to Perform—Anticipatory Breach of Contract Sometimes one of the 
parties, before performance is due, indicates by word or deed that she or he will not 
 perform. Normally an anticipatory breach (also called anticipatory repudiation) is the 
equivalent of a material breach, discharging the nonbreaching party from any further 
 obligations and allowing the nonbreaching party to sue for damages, if any.
When Has a Breach of Contract Occurred? When Should the 
Law Intervene in a Contract?
The brief case that follows raises many claims, including breach of contract, but it also serves 
as an interesting test of the role of law. Should sports fans be able to secure a  remedy through 
contract law when an event merely does not meet their expectations? The idea seems prepos-
terous and another instance of abuse of the legal system, but consider the facts.
The case deals with ex-convict and former heavyweight boxing 
champion Mike Tyson and his famous 1997 bout with then-champion 
Evander Holyfield, a fight ended by  disqualification in the third 
round when Tyson bit both of Holyfield’s ears. Incensed pay-per-

Duke University Breached Its Contract with a Student?
Andrew Giuliani (son of former New York mayor, Rudy Giuliani) was recruited by Coach 
Rod Myers to play golf at Duke University. Coach Myers allegedly said that Giuliani 
would be given “life-time access” to Duke’s “state-of-the-art” training facilities when he 
became a Duke alum, and that he would be able to compete for the  opportunity to play 
against the best golfers in the NCAA. Giuliani said those promises and others were instru-
mental in his decision to attend Duke. Giuliani alleged that Duke “promised to provide 
[Mr. Giuliani] with various educational services, lodging, and a right of access to the 
 Athletic Department’s Varsity program and facilities.” Coach Myers unexpectedly passed 
away in the spring of 2007 and Coach O.D. Vincent took over. Vincent decided to cut the 
squad in half and announced that he was canceling Giuliani’s golf eligibility. Vincent 
pointed to several incidents of alleged bad behavior by Giuliani. Vincent then presented 
Giuliani with a written agreement setting out the steps that would have allowed Giuliani to 
rejoin the team. Giuliani refused to sign the agreement. Giuliani then filed a breach of 
contract suit against Duke University and Vincent.
Questions
1. Giuliani claimed that his contractual right to play golf at Duke was based on 
(a) Coach Myers’s oral statements and (b) Duke’s Student-Athlete Handbook, the 
Duke Student Bulletin, the Duke Athletic Policy Manual, and the NCAA Division I 
Manual. Giuliani lost the case. Why did the Court reject Giuliani’s contract claims?
2. Could you successfully sue your university for breach of contract if you were dismissed 
from school because of low grades? Explain. See, for example, Bissessur v. The Indi-
ana  University Board of Trustees, 581 F.3d 599 (7th Cir. 2009).

3. Defects discovered in the Michelin tires to be used by 14 of 
the 20 teams in a Formula One race at the Indianapolis 
Speedway caused those teams to withdraw prior to the

was completed, but fans sued for breach of contract 
claiming the race was not what they had purchased tickets 
to see and that the race advertising had indicated that 
20 cars would be racing. Decide the case. Explain. See 
Bowers v. Federation Internationale de L’Automobile, 489 
F.3d 316 (7th Cir. 2007).
4. Pelullo promoted boxers and boxing matches through 
his company, Banner Productions. In 1999 Echols signed 
an agreement with Banner giving Echols a $30,000 
 bonus and giving Banner “the sole and exclusive right to 
secure all professional boxing bouts” for Echols. Banner 
was to provide no fewer than three bouts per year, and 
Echols was to be paid not less than a specified minimum 
amount for each fight, but the payments could be 
 lowered or the whole agreement canceled, at Banner’s 
option, if Echols lost a fight. Echols lost a championship 
bout, and Banner said it would thereafter negotiate 
each purse on a bout-by-bout basis. Echols continued to 
fight for Banner, but various disputes over purses arose, 
and Echols sued. Among other claims, Echols argued 
that the agreement was unenforceable for indefinite-
ness. Decide that claim. Explain. See Echols v. Pelullo, 
377 F.3d 272 (3d Cir. 2004).
Judge Ramos
Plaintiffs claim that they were entitled to view a “legitimate 
heavyweight title fight” fought “in accordance with the 
 applicable rules and regulations” of the governing boxing 
commission—that is, a fight that was to end either in an 
 actual or technical knockout or by decision of the judges 
 after 12 rounds—and that they are entitled to their money 
back because the fight ended in a disqualification. Many 
 legal theories are invoked in support of this claim—breach of 
contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair 
dealing, unjust enrichment, breach of express and implied 
warranties, tortious interference with contractual relations, 
“wantonness,” fraud, negligent representation—none of 
which have merit. Plaintiffs are not in contractual privity with 
any of the defendants, and their claim that they are third-
party beneficiaries of one or more of the contracts that 
 defendants entered into among themselves was aptly 
 rejected by the motion court as “contrived.” Nothing in these 
contracts can be understood as promising a fight that did not 
end in a disqualification. The rules of the governing commis-
sion provide for disqualification, and it is a possibility that a 
fight fan can reasonably expect. Plaintiffs could not reason-
ably rule out such a possibility by the boxer’s and promoters’ 
public statements predicting a “sensational victory” and 
“the biggest fight of all time,” and assuming other represen-
tations were made promising or implying a “legitimate fight,” 
there can be no breach of warranty claim absent privity of 
contract between plaintiffs and defendants and also  because 
defendants provided only a service. Nor is a claim of fraud 
supported by plaintiffs’ allegations that the boxer’s former 
trainer predicted that the boxer would get himself disquali-
fied if he failed to achieve an early knockout and that the 
boxer came out without his mouthpiece in the  beginning of 
the round that he was disqualified. Plaintiffs’ claim for unjust 
enrichment was properly dismissed by the motion court on 
the ground that plaintiffs received what they paid for, namely,

(N.Y. S.Ct. App. Div. 2000)

($50–$60 each) claiming they were “ripped off” or “scammed” by Tyson. They sued 
Tyson, fight promoters, and fight telecasters. A lower court dismissed the complaint for 
failure to state a cause of action. The plaintiffs appealed.

Chapter Six  Contracts  269
Discharge by Lawful Excuses (for Nonperformance)
Sometimes contracts are discharged lawfully even in the event of nonperformance. This 
can occur when performance is either impossible or impractical.
Impossibility After agreement is reached but performance is not yet due, circumstances 
may be so altered that performance is a legal impossibility. In such situations nonperform-
ance is excused. Impossibility here refers not simply to extreme difficulty but to objective 
impossibility; that is, the contracted-for performance cannot be accomplished by anyone. 
Notable examples of such situations are a personal service contract where the promisor has 
died or is incapacitated by illness, a contract where the subject of the agreement was ren-
dered illegal by a change in the law subsequent to the agreement but prior to its perfor-
mance, or a contract where an ingredient essential to performance has been destroyed and 
no reasonable substitutes are available. [For more on impossibility of performance, see 
www.west.net/~smith/imposbl.htm]
Commercial Impracticability Akin to the doctrine of impossibility is the situation in 
which duties are discharged because of unforeseen events that render performance exorbi-
tantly expensive or thoroughly impractical. Commercial impracticability is specifically 
provided for in UCC 2-615, which reads, “Delay in delivery or nondelivery in whole or in 
part by a seller . . . is not a breach of his duty under a contract for sale if performance as 
agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the nonoccurrence 
of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made. . . .”
 
The UCC’s commercial impracticability standard is more easily established than the 
impossibility doctrine of the common law, but note that only exceptional and unforeseea-
ble events fall within the impracticability excuse for nonperformance. Mere changes in 
market conditions do not give rise to commercial impracticability. Historically, the com-
mercial impracticability doctrine had been applied only to transactions involving the sale 
of goods, but now we see courts increasingly willing to apply it to other kinds of contracts 
as well.
Discharge by Agreement
A contractual discharge is sometimes achieved by a new agreement arrived at after enter-
ing the original contract. These agreements take a variety of forms, but one—accord and 
satisfaction—will serve here to illustrate the general category. Parties reach an accord 
when they agree to a performance different from the one provided for in their contract. 
Performance of the accord is called satisfaction, at which point the original contract is 
discharged. A binding accord and satisfaction must spring from a genuine dispute between 
the parties, and it must include consideration as well as all of the other ingredients in a 
binding contract.
Discharge by Operation of Law
Under some circumstances, contractual duties are discharged by the legal system itself. 
Among those possibilities: (1) The contractual responsibilities of a debtor may be 
 discharged by a bankruptcy decree. (2) Each state has a statute of limitations that specifies 
the time within which a performing party can initiate a lawsuit against a nonperforming 
party. For the UCC statute of limitations, see 2-725.

270  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Remedies
We have looked at the elements of a binding contract and at those circumstances that dis-
charge a party’s duties under a contract. Now our concern is with what happens when one of 
the parties does not fulfill his or her contractual duties—that is, when the contract is 
breached. Remedies are provided in both law and in equity (see Glossary and Chapter 4).
Remedies in Law
In general, a breach of contract allows the nonbreaching party to sue for money damages. 
The general goal of remedies law is to put the parties in the position they would have oc-
cupied had the contract been fulfilled. Normally, the best available substitute for actual 
performance is monetary damages.
Compensatory Damages In brief, the plaintiff in a breach of contract action is entitled to 
recover a sum equal to the actual damages suffered. The plaintiff is compensated for her losses 
by receiving a sum designed to “make her whole,” to put her where she would have been had 
the contract not been breached.
 
Sale of Goods A breach involving a sale of goods is governed by the UCC. Typically 
the measure of compensatory damages would be the difference between the contract price 
and the market price of the goods at the time and place the goods were to be delivered (see 
UCC 2-708 and 2-713). Suppose you are working for a newly established computer manu-
facturer, and you have contracted with the Internal Revenue Service to deliver 1,000 laptop 
computers at $1,500 each, although the current market price is $1,600. If you fail to make 
that delivery, damages could be assessed in the amount of $100,000 ($100 3 1,000), which 
is the additional amount the IRS would need to pay to make the substitute purchase.
Consequential Damages The victim of a breach may be able to recover not just the direct 
losses from the breach but also any indirect losses that were incurred as a consequence of 
that breach. Such consequential damages are recoverable only if they were foreseen or were 
reasonably foreseeable by the breaching party. For example, if you 
contract for a well-known local band to play for the grand opening of 
your new bar and dance club and the band fails to appear, you may 
be able to recover damages for any lost profits that you can attribute 
to the band’s absence. Those lost profits are a reasonably foreseeable 
consequence of the breach. Of course, you will have some difficulty in specifying the prof-
its lost and in proving that the loss was attributable to the band’s failure to perform.

new bar and the band fails 
to appear.

Chapter Six  Contracts  271
Incidental Damages The costs incurred by the nonbreaching party in arranging a substi-
tute performance or otherwise reducing the damages sustained because of the breach are 
recoverable as incidental damages. They would include such items as phone calls and 
transportation expenses.
Nominal Damages In some cases of breach, the court will award only an insignificant 
sum, perhaps $1.00 (plus court costs), because the nonbreaching party has suffered no 
 actual damages. The point of nominal damages is to illustrate the wrongfulness of the 
breach.
Punitive Damages Sometimes when the breaching party’s conduct is particularly repre-
hensible, the court will penalize that wrongful behavior by awarding punitive damages to 
the injured party. The idea is to deter such conduct in the future. Normally punitive dam-
ages cannot be awarded in breach of contract cases except when provided for by statute or 
when the breach is accompanied by a tort such as fraud (as where one buys a defective car 
having reasonably relied on the falsehoods of a salesperson).
Rescission and Restitution In some instances, including a material breach, mistake, 
fraud, undue influence, and duress, the wronged party may rescind (undo) the contract. 
The effect of a contract rescission is to return the parties to the positions they occupied 
before they entered the agreement. Generally, both parties must then make restitution to 
each other by returning whatever goods, property, and so forth were transferred under the 
contract or an equivalent amount of money.
Mitigation Obviously the law should penalize a breaching party, as we have discussed, 
but you may be surprised to learn that the law also imposes expectations on the victim (the 
non breaching party). Specifically, the nonbreaching party is required to take reasonable 
steps toward mitigation—that is, to minimize her or his damages. What happens, for ex-
ample, if you are wrongfully dismissed in breach of contract from your first job after col-
lege? You are expected to mitigate your damages by seeking another job. You need not 
take an inferior job, nor must you disturb your life by moving to another state or commu-
nity, but you must take reasonable measures to minimize your claim against your former 
employer.

272  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Liquidated Damages We have reviewed both the legal penalties for breach and the duty 
to mitigate damages. The law also offers the opportunity to provide some control over the 
penalty for breach by including in the contract a liquidated damages clause. Here you and 
the other party to the contract agree in advance about the measure of damages should either 
of you default on your duties. That clause is fully enforceable so long as it is not designed 
to be a penalty but rather a good faith effort to assess in advance an accurate measure of 
damages. A valid liquidated damages clause limits the nonbreaching party to recovery of 
the amount provided for in that clause.
Remedies in Equity
Where justice cannot be achieved via money damages alone, the courts will sometimes 
impose equitable remedies. The chief forms of equitable remedy in contract cases are spe-
cific performance, injunction, reformation, and quasi-contract.
Specific Performance In unusual circumstances the court may order the breaching party 
to remedy its wrong by performing its obligations precisely as provided for in the contract. 
Normally that specific performance is required only where the subject matter of the con-
tract is unique and thus cannot be adequately compensated with money. Examples of such 
subject matter might include a particular piece of land, an art work, or a family heirloom. 
By contrast, specific performance would not be available in contracts involving conven-
tional personal property such as a television or a car unless those items were unique (such 
as a one-of-a-kind Rolls Royce).
 
Normally the courts will not grant a specific performance remedy in personal service 
contracts (such as an agreement by a cosmetic surgeon to perform a face-lift). If the sur-
geon refused to perform, specific performance probably would not be ordered. The quality 
of the surgery likely would not be equal to what had been bargained for; courts do not want 
to be in the position of supervising the completion of contracts, and as a matter of public 
policy, we do not want to put parties, in this case, the surgeon, in a position that amounts 
to involuntary servitude.
Injunction An injunction is a court order that may either require or forbid a party to per-
form a specified act. Injunctions are granted only under exceptional circumstances. Perhaps 
the most common of those are the noncompetition agreements. For example, you take a 
computer programming job that will afford you access to company secrets. To protect itself, 
the company expects you to sign an agreement specifying that you will not take employment 
with a competing firm for one year after departure from your employer. If you should quit 
and seek to work for a competitor within one year, your former employer might be able to 
secure an injunction preventing you from doing so until the year has passed.
Reformation Reformation is an equitable remedy that permits the court to rewrite the 
contract where it imperfectly expressed the parties’ true intentions. Typically such situa-
tions involve a mutual mistake or fraud. Thus, if the parties sign a contract to sell a lot in a 
housing development, but the contract is written with an incorrect street address for the lot, 
an equity court could simply correct the error in the contract.
Quasi-Contract What happens if one party has conferred a benefit on another, but a con-
tract has not been created because of a failure of consideration, the application of the

Liberal journalism blog aggregator and opinion site The 
Huffington Post was sued in a class action in 2011 on the 
grounds that the blog had failed to pay the more than 9,000 
bloggers who had provided content for the blog over a pe-
riod of years. In submitting copy to The Huffington Post, 
bloggers knew they would not be paid, but presumably they 
valued the professional/political/personal exposure afforded 
by publication. The lawsuit, however, claimed the agree-
ment to provide content without compensation had resulted 
in unjust enrichment for Huffington. AOL purchased The 
Huffington Post earlier in 2011 for $315 million; the bloggers 
sought approximately a third of the purchase price, assert-
ing their contributions had made The Huffington Post that 
valuable an acquisition. In 2012, a federal judge dismissed 
the lawsuit, concluding that the bloggers had not expected 
money in return for their contributions to The Huffington 
Post. 
Question
The law aside, does The Huffington Post have a moral 
duty to compensate the bloggers who knowingly gave 
away their content when that content subsequently 
proved to be instrumental in building Huffington into a 
valuable property? Explain. Do you feel a duty to pay oth-
ers when you are the beneficiary of “unjust enrichment?” 
Explain.

 statute of frauds, or something of the sort? To prevent unjust enrichment, the court might 
then imply a contract as a matter of law. For example, assume a lawn service mistakenly 
trims your shrubs and you watch them do so, knowing that they are supposed to be caring 
for your neighbor’s lawn. You have not entered a contract with the lawn service, but a 
court might well require you to pay the reasonable value of trimming your shrubs. To do 
otherwise would unjustly enrich you.

mately one half hour before the housing bids were due, Virginia Metal Industries 
quoted Campbell Co. a price of $193,121 to supply the necessary doors and frames. 
Campbell, using the Virginia Metal quote, entered a bid and won the contract. Virginia 
Metal refused to supply the necessary doors, and Campbell had to secure an alternative

shot in the process. The Rowleys sued Dimmick for damages; Dimmick countersued 
for breach of contract, seeking $160,000 to cover hospital bills and $75,000 for pain 
and suffering. Dimmick said the Rowleys had broken their promise to keep him hid-

other problems. Blette tendered a $752.54 check and wrote an accompanying letter saying 
that the payment was to settle her forthcoming March, April, and May rent minus her al-
leged damages. She also wrote that if the check were cashed her terms were being 
 accepted. ANC wrote back saying it would cash the check but that her demands were un-

employee accidentally sprayed gasoline while at Weaver’s station. Weaver had one 
and one half years of high school education. The trial record provides no evidence that 
Weaver read the lease, that American’s agent asked him to read it, or that Weaver’s 
attention was drawn to the “hold harmless” clause. The clause was in fine print and 
contained no title heading. Is the contract enforceable against Weaver? Explain. See

markup in a line item for “materials package.” Although the markup did not increase 
the agreed-upon price, Landes refused to continue payments to Flynn, and construc-
tion halted. Flynn filed a mechanic’s lien for approximately $28,000. Flynn testified 
that his job as general contractor were nearly completed at the time he left, with 
 arrangements having been made with various subcontractors to complete the  remaining

 11. Preference Personnel, a North Dakota corporation, entered a contract with Peterson 
to help him find employment in the tax law field. The contract provided that the 
employer would pay the placement fee, unless Peterson voluntarily quit within 
9 days, in which case he would be responsible for the fee, which was 20 percent of one 
year’s salary. Peterson was placed in a job with an annual salary of $60,000, but he 
quit after one month. Peterson refused to pay the fee, and Preference sued for breach 
of contract. The lower court found that Peterson breached the contract, but at the time 
of the contract, Preference Personnel’s state-required license to operate had been 
 allowed to lapse. The court, therefore, dismissed the Preference claim ruling that the 
agreement was unenforceable as a matter of public policy. Preference appealed. Rule 
on that appeal. Explain. See Preference Personnel, Inc. v. Peterson, 710 N.W.2d 383

wich shop: “Landlord agrees not to enter into a lease, . . . for a bakery or restaurant 
reasonably expected to have annual sales of sandwiches (emphasis added) greater than 
ten percent (10%) of its total sales . . . ” Panera asked a Massachusetts Superior Court 
to block the Shopping Center from leasing space to a Qdoba Mexican Grill on the 
grounds that a lease with the Grill would violate the terms of the Panera lease. How 
should the Court rule? Explain. See White City Shopping Center, LP v. PR Restau-

Despite his 6’5,” 270-pound frame, Jdimytai Damour, 34, was 
no match for the unruly crowd of an estimated 2,000 Black 
Friday, 2008 shoppers at a Long Island, New York,  Walmart. 
The crowd, some of whom had been waiting for many hours,

through crushing Damour to his death and injuring others. 
Damour had no experience with crowd control and report-

barriers were not employed and security personnel report-
edly were inside the store rather than being outside to moni-
tor and manage the crowd.  Police had been on the scene for 
30 minutes at 3 AM, but the crowd of 400 at the time was or-
derly and the police left. Walmart argued that it had taken 
appropriate and sufficient safety measures, but authorities 
subsequently questioned those measures and compared 
them unfavorably with other retailers’ approaches.
 
Without admitting guilt, Walmart avoided criminal charges 
by agreeing to pay $400,000 into a victims’ compensation fund, 
along with $1.5 million to local  social services causes. 
Walmart also agreed to build  improved holiday crowd man-
agement plans for all of its New York stores. (Changes also 
were to be implemented nationwide on a store-by-store 
 basis.) The federal Occupational Safety and Health Adminis-
tration (OSHA; see Chapter 12) imposed a $7,000 fine for failing 
to maintain a safe workplace; Walmart lost its appeal of the 
OSHA fine. Damour’s family sued Nassau County officials and 
Walmart. To avoid criminal prosecution in Nassau County, 
Walmart agreed to improve its Black Friday crowd control, 
donate approximately $1.2 million to local community 
 programs, and create a $400,000 victims’ compensation fund.

Trampled to Death
Part One—Torts: An Introduction
We have looked at the Walmart Black Friday story as an ethics dilemma. Now we turn to the 
law that resolves personal injury claims like those asserted against Walmart. From the Damour 
family’s point of view, Walmart’s Black Friday promotion and the subsequent crowd stampede 
involved both torts and crimes. Torts are civil wrongs not arising from contracts. Torts involve 
breaches of duty to particular persons causing loss or injury, while crimes are regarded as public 
wrongs breaching duties to society as a whole (although, of course, they are most commonly 
directed at a specific  person or persons). Crimes are prosecuted by the state; tort actions are ini-
tiated by individuals. Criminal law punishes wrongdoers, but the point of tort law is to make 
whole an injured party. At the same time, many acts can be treated either as a civil wrong (a tort) 
or as a crime, or both. For example, a physical attack on another can, of course, lead to criminal 
charges, but it can also produce civil tort claims, most commonly assault and battery.

Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  279
 
The injured party in a tort litigation can seek compensatory damages to make up for the 
harm suffered. Those damages may consist of medical expenses, lost income, and pain and 
suffering, among other possibilities. In some cases, punitive damages may be awarded to 
punish the wrongdoer and to discourage others from similar behavior.
Tort Categories
Fundamentally, torts are of three kinds: (1) intentional, (2) negligent, and (3) strict liabil-
ity. Intentional torts involve voluntary acts that harm a protected interest. Intent is estab-
lished by showing the defendant meant to do the act that caused the harm. The plaintiff 
need not show that the harm itself was intended. The defendant would be liable for all 
reasonably foreseeable injuries from that intentional act.
 
To explain, if you run an advertisement defaming a fast-food competitor by saying its 
food processing does not meet government standards, but you cannot prove the truth of 
your allegations, you will probably be guilty of the intentional tort of injurious falsehood 
(product disparagement).
 
Negligence involves situations in which harm is caused accidentally. Intent is absent, 
but because of one party’s carelessness, another has suffered injury. Thus, if one of your 
employees is making a delivery for the printing business you are managing, and carelessly 
runs a red light, striking another car, the employee appears to be guilty of negligent con-
duct for which both she and your firm may be subject to civil damages. Furthermore, you 
and/or your firm might bear responsibility if, for example, you hired her knowing that she 
had been a careless driver in the past.
 
A detailed discussion of negligence law follows in Part Two of this chapter, but for 
the moment we should notice that negligence concerns are ubiquitous in our lives, 
ranging from traffic accidents, to inadequate snow clearance from our sidewalks, to 
failure to keep dangerous kitchen utensils away from children, to ill-timed golf shots, 
and on and on.  Negligence ordinarily is the core claim for those suffering a personal 
injury caused by the carelessness of another. Broadly, negligence litigation involves 
an analysis of when that alleged carelessness amounts to a breach of the “duty of due 
care.” For  example, can an injured party properly bring a negligence claim against 
homeowners when parts of their dismantled but not yet stowed away trampoline blow 
into the nearby road causing a passing driver to crash? The Iowa Supreme Court said 
“yes” because the homeowners had a duty to exercise reasonable care to see that ob-
structions did not reach the roadway and they breached that duty by creating a foresee-
able risk in dismantling the trampoline but failing to secure the parts over the passage 
of several weeks time. [For the Court’s complete  negligence analysis, see Thompson v. 
Kaczinski, 774 N.W.2d 829 (Ia. S.Ct. 2009).]
 
Strict liability is, in essence, a no-fault concept where an individual or organization is re-
sponsible for harm without proof of carelessness. Strict liability expands the reach of the law 
beyond instances where carelessness (negligence) must be established to situations where 
actual proof of breach of the duty of due care; that is, proof of negligence, is not  required 
because the risks inherent in that situation are so great. Strict liability is limited to “unreason-
ably dangerous” products and practices about which we have decided, as a  matter of social 

280  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
policy, that responsibility for injury will automatically attach without  establishing blame. 
Thus, if a product is (1) defective and (2) unreasonably dangerous and someone is hurt, strict 
(absolute) liability may attach even though fault is not established. Strict liability is explained 
in the Gallagher case below and in greater detail in Part Two of this chapter.
Tort Law
Selected Intentional Torts against Persons
Suppose you are warehouse manager for a plumbing supply business, and a subordinate 
does a poor job with some work, which in turn brings your boss down on you. In your 
frustration, you call the subordinate into your office where you chastise him and then light 
up a cigar and casually but pointedly blow smoke in his face. Could he file a tort claim 
against you for your insulting behavior? Let’s look at the law in this area. (Of course, many 
states forbid workplace smoking.)
Battery
Intentionally touching another in a harmful or offensive way without legal justification or the 
consent of that person is a battery. Merely touching another’s clothing or touching an occu-
pied car may constitute a battery. Our concern here is with civil wrongs, but perhaps the most 
interesting recent battery allegation involves a criminal claim.  Believing his  student, Krista 
 Bowman, was Web surfing in class, Professor Frank J. Rybicki of 
 Valdosta State University (Georgia) reportedly asked her to be atten-
tive. Rybicki apparently believed  Bowman continued to surf. Bowman 
claims that Rybicki then closed the laptop on her  fingers,  injuring one 
or more of them.  Bowman filed a criminal battery charge against 
 Rybicki, who was arrested, but later found not guilty by a jury. [For 
more details, see Scott Jaschik, “Not Guilty, and Not Long Employed,” 
Inside Higher Education,  August 25, 2011, at www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/08/25/
jury_rejects_charges_against_professor_in_case_of_student_laptop]
Assault
Intentionally causing another to reasonably believe that he or she is about to be the victim 
of a battery is an assault. The battery need not occur and the victim need not be frightened, 
but an assault nonetheless transpires if the victim reasonably anticipated a substantially 
imminent  battery. Thus, raising one’s hand as if to strike another even though the blow 
never transpires constitutes the tort of assault if the victim reasonably thought herself to be 
in immediate danger.
False Imprisonment
If you have anticipated a career in retailing, you may have given thought to the problem of 
shoplifters and strategies for preserving your inventory without yourself violating custom-
ers’ rights. The statutory and common (judge-made) law of most states now protects store 
managers and owners from false imprisonment claims if they justifiably detain a suspected 
shoplifter for a reasonable period and in a reasonable manner. Broadly, false imprisonment 
occurs when someone is intentionally confined against his or her will; that is, his or her 
Krista Bowman was Web 
surfing in class. Bowman 
claims Professor Rybicki 
closed the laptop on her 
 fingers.

Nine Hours on Grounded Plane: False Imprisonment?
Catherine Ray and her husband were flying from Oakland, California, to Dallas, Texas, in 2006 
when their American Airlines plane was rerouted to Austin, Texas, because of bad weather in 
Dallas. Their flight landed in Austin around noon, refueled, and began to depart, but the 
weather problems had then closed the Dallas airport. After an hour on the ground, a bus took 
some passengers to the terminal, but Ray and her husband chose not to deplane because, 
 according to Ray’s testimony, the pilot said the flight would likely resume in about an hour 
and anyone who left the plane “would be on their own,” a remark Ray interpreted to mean that 
departing passengers would need to fund their further transportation, something the Rays 
could not afford. Two to three hours later another bus arrived and, according to Ray, passen-
gers were told that bus offered their last chance for departure. The Rays decided to remain on 
the plane. Catherine Ray testified that deteriorating conditions on the plane included little food 
and drink, agitated passengers, and at least some nonfunctioning lavatories. About 6 pm, the 
pilot said he could no longer fly because he had reached his maximum duty hours. Lightning 
in Austin delayed ground crew work, but at about 9 pm, the plane was taken to a gate where 
Ray and all other passengers deplaned. Some time after deplaning, food and lodging vouchers 
were provided. Ray and her husband decided to spend the night in the terminal. They flew 
from Austin the following morning. Ray subsequently filed a civil action for false imprison-
ment, among other claims. How would you rule on that claim? Explain.

Father of the Child?

nity tests, however, he learne d he was not the father. Can Dier sue Peters for fraud? What 
additional facts might you need to know before making a decision? Explain.

freedom of movement is restricted. That restriction might include being shut in a room, 
being bound, being threatened, and so on. Even a moment could conceivably constitute 
imprisonment, although simply sending a customer, for example, through a more distant 
store exit ordinarily would not meet the test.
Fraud
Intentional misrepresentations of facts, sometimes identified by the formal title of deceit, 
can lead to tort claims. We discuss fraud in the contracts (Chapter 6) and consumer protec-
tion (Chapter 15) chapters. For now, simply note the general test for fraud:
1. A material fact was misrepresented.
2. The misrepresentation was intentional.
3. The injured party justifiably relied on the misrepresentation.
4. Injury resulted.

282  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Defamation
Uttering an untruth about another may constitute a tort. Slander is the spoken form of the 
tort of defamation. Libel is defamation in print or some other tangible form such as a pic-
ture, movie, or video. Most courts also treat defamatory radio and television statements as 
forms of libel. The basic test for establishing defamation includes:
1. A false statement.
2. Harm to the victim’s reputation.
3. Publication of the statement. (The statement must reach someone other than the one 
being defamed.)
 
The law’s interest here is in protecting reputations. Any living person or any organization 
can be the victim of defamation, although public figures such as politicians or actors face the 
additional burden of proving malice if they are to be successful in a defamation claim. Malice 
generally requires a showing of actual knowledge of the falsehood or reckless disregard for the 
truth. Libel or slander about a company’s products or property often is treated as the tort of in-
jurious falsehood, which is discussed below.
 
A one-star review on Yelp led to a lawsuit against the reviewer. In 2011, after contrac-
tor Christopher Dietz completed plumbing, painting, and other work on her Fairfax, 
 Virginia, home, Jane Perez posted a scathing review of Dietz’s contracting firm on the 
online review site Yelp. Perez claimed that her house had been 
damaged, that she was billed for work not done, and that jewelry 
had disappeared from her home. Dietz rebutted online that Perez 
had stolen his goods and services by not paying him and did not 
 allow him to pick up valuable items from her house. Claiming 
Perez’s negative reviews on Yelp as well as on Angi e’s List (an-
other online review site) caused him to lose business and suffer personally, Dietz filed a 
defamation lawsuit against Perez seeking $750,000 in damages. At trial, the jury decided 
that both Dietz and Perez had defamed each other, but neither was awarded damages.1
 
In general, a claim of slander requires a showing of actual harm, such as job loss. Some 
statements, however, are so inherently damaging that actual injury need not be shown. 
Those statements are labeled slander per se and include allegations of serious sexual mis-
conduct, commission of a serious crime, professional incompetence, or having a loathsome 
disease. Similarly, libel, leaving a more permanent stain, generally does not require a 
showing of actual harm.
 
Truth acts as a complete defense to a defamation claim. Hence, if we tell the truth about 
others, we cannot be guilty of the tort of defamation, regardless of our evil intentions. 
 Furthermore, many statements are protected because of the circumstances in which they 
are made. We label these protections either absolute or qualified privileges. An absolute 
privilege to defame  includes, for example, remarks by government officials in the course 
of their duties or by participants in a trial. A qualified privilege to defame protects, most 
notably, former employers providing references for a job applicant. In that instance, the 
reference will not be treated as defamatory, even though false, unless it was motivated by 
malice. [For an overview of online defamation law for bloggers, see www.eff.org/issues

Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  283
Invasion of Privacy
A key ingredient in personal freedom is the right to be left alone. Our courts recognize a 
right of recovery in tort law when we are the victims of some kind of unconscionable 
 exposure of our private lives. Invasion of privacy takes four forms:
1. Misappropriation of a person’s name or likeness. When an individual’s name or 
 image is wrongfully used without permission for commercial purposes (called a misap-
propriation) that person probably has a cause of action for invasion of privacy. Typi-
cally, this tort involves a company’s use of a celebrity’s name or picture to imply that 
he or she has endorsed a product even though no such approval was secured. A celeb-
rity’s name or likeness may also be wrongfully used in the product 
itself, such as in a video game. In 2013, a federal appeals court ruled 
that Ryan Hart, former Rutgers University quarterback, could sue 
Electronic Arts (EA), maker of a college football video game, for 
allegedly misappropriating his likeness through animation.2 EA 
soon settled with Hart and other college athletes with similar claims. 
Although the settlement’s terms are confidential, EA announced it would not  release 
that video game in 2014.3
2. Intrusion. An intentional invasion of a person’s solitude is labeled an intrusion if it 
would be highly offensive to a reasonable person. Physical intrusions such as opening 
an employee’s mail or more subtle strategies such as an electronic probe of an em-
ployee’s bank account are examples of tortious intrusion.
3. Public disclosure of private facts. We believe that certain elements of one’s life, such 
as debt payment practices or sexual preferences, are, with rare exceptions, no one else’s 
business. If the disclosure would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and the 
College athletes claiming 
EA’s college football video 
game featured their animated 
likenesses.
An Angry Dad
On September 24, 2008, Ed Doherty, a franchisee/owner of about 80 Applebee’s restaurants 
in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania said in a newspaper interview that he treats 
employees “with dignity and respect” and offers “a great opportunity for them to have a 
good job.” Previously, Michael Murray had represented his daughter, Erin Duby, a former 
Applebee’s employee, in an arbitration claim alleging that she was sexually harassed by 
managers and other employees. In December 2007, Murray rejected a settlement offer aris-
ing out of the arbitration process.
 
Murray then posted an online response to Doherty’s interview by saying that “women . . . 
are routinely sexually harassed and that this behavior is condoned by high-level manage-
ment at Doherty Enterprises right up to the top.” He warned that “any reader who has a 
daughter, wife, etc. working for Doherty are [sic] more than likely being subjected to simi-
lar treatment.” Doherty then sued Murray on defamation grounds.
 
Was Doherty a victim of defamation? Explain.

Counsel, May 20, 2009.

284  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
subject of the disclosure is not a matter of public importance, the tort of public disclo-
sure of private facts might be invoked. In these cases, the truth may not constitute a 
complete defense.
4. False light. When claims are published about another that have the effect of casting the 
victim in a false light in the public mind, a tort claim may emerge. False light claims 
involve injury to one’s mental or emotional well-being rather than one’s reputation. 
Again, the claim would need to be highly offensive to the reasonable person. The courts 
have struggled to differentiate defamation and false light claims, and we will not pursue 
the distinction further here.
Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress
Employment terminations (firings), drug tests, and sexual harassment cases have  become 
particularly fertile grounds for emotional distress claims, although it should be understood 
that the courts have demanded compelling evidence of outrageous conduct causing severe 
emotional pain. Thus, Mahmoud Abdul-Malik, a ramp agent for AirTran at the Atlanta, 
Georgia, airport was unsuccessful in his intentional infliction of emotional distress claim 
against his employer after he was fired for allegedly threatening to blow up the house of 
another employee. Abdul-Malik claimed that his distress from being fired caused him to 
lose sleep and gain weight, but the Georgia Court of Appeals ruled, among other things, 
that those problems did not rise to the level of severity needed for a successful claim. [For 
the full case, see Abdul-Malik v. Airtran Airways, 678 S.E.2d 555 (2009); cert den. 
Mahmoud Abdul-Malik v. Airtran Airways, Inc., 2009 Ga. LEXIS 711 (Ga. S.Ct.).]
Selected Intentional Torts Against Property
We will briefly examine four prominent tort claims arising from wrongs to property.
 
Trespass to real property (land and immovable objects attached to it) occurs with the 
intentional entry on to the land of another without consent. Trespass to personal property 
(movable property; all property other than real property) involves an intentional interfer-
ence with a person’s right to enjoy his or her personal property—for example, the manager 
of a parking lot refuses for a day to return a car to its owner in the mistaken belief that the 
owner has not paid his monthly bill.
 
More serious and extensive interference with personal property may be labeled a 
 conversion. For example, if the parking lot company kept the car for months, and it 
 suffered damage during the impoundment, a conversion probably occurred.
 
Injurious falsehood, sometimes called trade libel, is a form of defamation that is  directed 
against the property of a person. Thus, falsely claiming that a competitor’s product is defective 
or harmful might constitute injurious falsehood. As with defamation, the statement must be 
false and it must be published. Damages must result. Often malice/intent must also be shown.
 
Nuisance is the situation in which enjoyment of one’s land is impaired because of some 
tortious interference. That interference often takes the form of light, noise, smell, or vibration. 
Here, the owner is not deprived of the land and the land has not been physically invaded, but 
the full enjoyment of the land cannot be achieved because of the interference. The case that 
follows involves the owner of an historic Baltimore, Maryland, home who raises both strict 
liability and nuisance claims in a dispute over alleged damage to her home from nearby pile 
driving. [For the Jurist Torts Guide, see http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/sg_torts.htm]

permanent seismic stations and five mobile geophones were 
placed in the surrounding neighborhood to ensure that vibrations 
were monitored and did not exceed the limits established by the 
engineers. During the course of the defendants’ activities, there 
was only a single recorded vibration that exceeded the limits.
 
The case proceeded to trial on December 15, 2006. The 
plaintiff testified that she heard and felt vibrations from the pile 
driving in her home. She further testified that cracks began to 
develop in her plaster walls and in other portions of her home 
soon after the pile driving began and that no cracks occurred 
once the pile driving was completed. She was not aware of any 
other residents in the area who made claims or filed lawsuits for 
damage to their homes as a result of the vibrations caused by 
the defendants’ pile driving. No evidence of any other claims or 
suits on account of pile driving vibrations was presented at trial.

On December 21, 2006, the jury returned a verdict in 
 Gallagher’s favor. The jury found that: (1) pile driving caused 
damage to Gallagher’s home, and HV Pierpont and HV Devel-
opment were responsible for the pile driving; (2) the pile 
 driving created a public nuisance; (3) the pile driving created a 
private nuisance; and (4) Gallagher suffered damages in the 
amount of $ 55,189.14.
 
After the jury’s verdict was announced, the defendants 
 renewed their motions for judgment. . . . By Order entered 
on August 20, 2007, the circuit court granted the defendants’ 
motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict [The judge 
overruled the jury–Ed.] on all claims. Gallagher [appealed].

STRICT LIABILITY IN MARYLAND
* * * * *
[The Restatement of Torts,] Section 519, sets forth the general 
principle upon which courts have held defendants to be liable 
regardless of fault: “One who carries on an abnormally dan-
gerous activity is subject to liability for harm to the person, 
land or chattels of another resulting from the activity, although 
he has exercised the utmost care to prevent the harm.”

In summary, Maryland recognizes strict liability, [and] adopts 
the definition of abnormally dangerous activity as set forth in 
Judge Rubin
THE PROCEEDINGS BELOW
On June 14, 2005, Gallagher sued HV Pierhomes LLC and HV 
Development & Contracting Co. The initial complaint con-
tained claims for negligence, strict liability, and public and 
private nuisance. On December 21, 2005, Gallagher filed an 
amended complaint, which abandoned the negligence claim. 
All of Gallagher’s claims for relief arose out of the pile driving 
operations conducted by the defendants on the site of the for-
mer Key Highway Shipyard. Gallagher contended that vibra-
tions from the pile driving damaged her home, located at 
423 East Hamburg Street in Baltimore. Key Highway; a row of 
mixed use properties; Covington Street; a retaining wall; and a 
solid earthen wall, on which Gallagher’s house rests, separate 
Gallagher’s house from the pile driving site.
 
The Key Highway Shipyard, formerly owned by the  Bethlehem 
Steel Corporation, was used to repair naval (sic) ships during 
World War II and through the Vietnam War. A shipyard of some 
sort has operated at this location from the beginning of the 20th 
century until 1982, when Bethlehem Steel closed the facility.
 
The defendants demolished the original shipyard piers, 
which were built 40 to 50 years ago and constructed new piers 
in the same location, by driving piles into the Baltimore Inner 
Harbor. The defendants built 58 townhomes on these new piers. 
Pile driving was the only method of constructing the new town-
homes in this particular location because the U.S. Army Corps 
of Engineers would not allow the Inner Harbor to be “back 
filled.” The pile driving of which Gallagher complained occurred 
periodically between September 2003 and October 2004.
 
The plaintiff’s home was constructed shortly before the War 
of 1812. She testified that no pile driving was conducted in the 
area during the years she lived in the house, beginning in 1997, 
until the defendants’ activities commenced in September 2003. 
Previously, pile driving was used to build the Seagirt Marine 
Terminal, the Dundalk Marine Terminal, as well as the Pratt 
and Light Street Pavilions, which are located across from the 
plaintiff’s residence in the Inner Harbor.
 
Before the defendants began their project, permits were re-
ceived from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Maryland De-
partment of the Environment, and the City of Baltimore. The 
permitting process took approximately two years. Pile driving on 
the site began only after geotechnical studies were  conducted by 
engineering firms. During the course of actual pile driving, two 

286  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Section 519 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977). In many, 
but not all cases, the “thrust of the doctrine is that the activity be 
abnormally dangerous in relation to the area where it occurs.”
STRICT LIABILITY IN PILE DRIVING CASES
The circuit court acknowledged that “whether pile driving is 
an abnormally dangerous activity has yet to be determined by 
the Maryland Court of Appeals.” The circuit court neverthe-
less concluded, after applying sections 519 and 520 to the 
facts of the case, that the Court of Appeals would hold that the 
pile driving activity in this case would not warrant the applica-
tion of strict liability.
 
In the 1984 revision of Dean Prosser’s landmark treatise, 
Professor Page Keaton observed that varying formulations of 
strict liability have been applied by some courts to hold that 
pile driving is an abnormally or unreasonably dangerous activ-
ity warranting liability without fault. The reasoning of these 
decisions, as well as the results, is far from uniform. Some 
courts consider pile driving to be no different than blasting, 
and therefore dangerous enough to warrant strict liability 
 regardless of the place in which it occurs. Others have taken a 
more fact-based approach, considering the activity in con-
junction with the locale and the type of harm that resulted.
 
For example, in Caporale v. C.W. Blakeslee & Sons, Inc., 
149 Conn. 79, 175 A.2d 561 (1961), the Supreme Court of 
 Connecticut held that pile driving activity during the construc-
tion of the Connecticut turnpike in 1958 and 1959, in close 
proximity to the plaintiff’s business premises, warranted the 
application of strict liability. The Connecticut court analogized 
pile driving to blasting and aligned itself with those courts that 
imposed strict liability not only for flying debris but also for the 
vibrations caused by the explosive force of the blast. The 
 Connecticut court noted, but declined to follow, a line of New 
York decisions, illustrated by Fagan v. Pathe Industries, Inc., 
274 A.D. 703, 86 N.Y.S.2d 859, 863-64 (App. Div., 1st Dept. 1949), 
that  rejected strict liability for pile driving where the damage 
was caused only by vibrations.
* * * * *
STRICT LIABILITY IN THIS CASE
* * * * *
The appellant argues that pile driving should be considered ab-
normally dangerous simply because it produces uncontrollable 
vibrations, similar to blasting. She also asserts that pile driving 
created an abnormal risk to persons, such as  Gallagher, who 
have historic homes, and that damage resulting from the inevita-
ble emission of vibration cannot be eliminated through the 
 exercise of due care. Although some courts have adopted this 
view, others have declined to impose strict liability for vibrations 
 resulting from blasting (as opposed to flying debris).
 
The circuit court, after reviewing the evidence presented 
at trial, concluded that the defendants’ pile driving in the Inner 
Harbor did not involve a high degree of risk of harm to the 
 person, land or chattels of another, . . . . We agree. Comment g 
to section 520 states: “The harm threatened must be major in 
degree, and sufficiently serious in its possible consequence to 
justify holding the defendant strictly liable for subjecting 
 others to an unusual risk.” The risk of harm proven in this 
case, relatively minor damage to a 200-year-old home from the 
vibrations of the pile driving, simply is not a high degree of risk 
which requires the application of strict liability. . . .
 
[A] plaintiff must show that the defendants’ pile driving 
was likely to produce significant harm, not simply that she suf-
fered some harm as a result of the pile driving activity.
 
After considering the factors of section 520 of the 
 Restatement, we agree with the circuit court’s conclusion 
that the pile driving in this case was not an abnormally dan-
gerous activity.
NUISANCE
Gallagher also contends that the defendants’ conduct inter-
fered with the use and enjoyment of her land, amounting to a 
public and private nuisance. The circuit court disagreed, con-
cluding that Gallagher’s evidence of a private or public nui-
sance was insufficient as a matter of law.
 
Under Maryland law, to sustain a private nuisance claim 
“there must be a substantial interference with the plaintiff’s 
reasonable use and enjoyment of its property.” Exxon Corp. v. 
Yarema, 69 Md. App. 124, 151, 516 A.2d 990 (1986), cert. denied, 
309 Md. 47, 522 A.2d 392 (1987). In Yarema, we held that the 
defendants’ “contamination of ground water imposed crippling 
restrictions not only on the contaminated land but on all the 
property adjacent to the land.” A private nuisance requires the 
interference to be “substantial and unreasonable and such as 
would be offensive or inconvenient to the normal person.”
 
Nothing of that order occurred in this case. The defendants’ 
activity was reasonable in time, place, manner, and duration and 
did not substantially interfere with Gallagher’s use and enjoyment 
of her land. . . . Residents of Baltimore City must accept the 
 occasional annoyance and discomforts incidental to city life.
 
The elements of a public nuisance were discussed by the 
Court of Appeals in Tadjer v. Montgomery County. Quoting Dean 
Prosser, the Court of Appeals said: “To be considered public, 
the nuisance must affect an interest common to the general 
public, rather than peculiar to one individual, or  several.”

The circuit court concluded that the evidence produced at 
trial was insufficient to prove a public nuisance under these 
standards. We agree.

Questions
1. a.  The plaintiff, Gallagher, brought three causes of action 
in her amended complaint. List them.
 
b. Why do you think the jury ruled in favor of Gallagher?
 
c.  Why did Gallagher lose at the trial level even though the 
jury had ruled in her favor?
 
d.  Explain why the appeals court upheld the judgment 
against Gallagher.
 
e. Who do you think should have won this case? Explain.
2. Rattigan and Horvitz owned a house and prime ocean-
front lot in Beverley Farms, Massachusetts. The house 
was rented during the summer months. Wile owned an 
adjacent undeveloped oceanfront lot. The only land ac-
cess to Wile’s lot was through the Rattigan/Horvitz lot. 
Rattigan and Horvitz successfully challenged Wile’s ap-
plication for a building permit and thereafter, Wile be-
gan a series of retaliatory acts, including putting several 
portable toilets on his lot immediately adjacent to the 
Horvitz swimming pool, landing his helicopter on his va-
cant lot, placing debris such as a rusted crane bucket, 
broken cement, and the bed of a pickup truck on his 
property, and holding parties (not attended by Wile) for 
150 to 200 guests from the local youth shelter. Some of 
these tactics by Wile were sporadic rather than persis-
tent. Were Rattigan and Horvitz the victims of a nui-
sance? Explain. See Rattigan v. Wile, 841 N.E.2d 680 
(Mass. S. Judicial Ct. 2006).
Selected Intentional Tort Defenses
Let’s take a brief look at a few of the more significant defenses to the intentional torts that 
we have been examining.
Consent
Clearly, if you consent to the use of your picture in an advertising campaign and you 
 subsequently feel that your public image has been harmed, you will have difficulty in pur-
suing a tort claim. Of course, if you gave permission under mistake, fraud, or duress, your 
consent was not meaningful.
Mistake
As store security manager, you are radioed by a clerk to “stop the guy in the New York 
Yankees cap” on suspicion of shoplifting. After stopping someone fitting that description, 
you later discover that someone else, also wearing a Yankees cap, was the actual suspect. 
If the store is sued for false imprisonment, can it successfully raise a mistake defense? 
 Unless protected under state law, probably not. Having acted intentionally, you and, by 
extension, your employer probably will bear responsibility. Of course, false imprisonment 
does not occur unless the detention was unreasonable.
 
On the other hand, mistake can be a good defense, particularly in instances in which 
events happen rapidly. Say, for example, a store’s security personnel broke up what looked 
like an assault and battery in the mall parking lot, only to discover that the incident was 
merely horsing around by the parties. A mistake defense might be appropriate here.
Necessity
In what we would broadly label emergency situations, one may intentionally commit a tort and 
yet be excused. A case of public necessity might involve, for example, a person breaking into 
an unoccupied building late at night because he saw a fire burning inside. An example of a 
Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  287

288  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
private necessity is when a defendant intrudes on the property of  another to save himself only; 
he might thereafter raise a necessity defense against the tort claim of trespass.
Self-Defense
Suppose your career has taken you into retail management, and you have now decided to 
buy your own hardware store. You encounter the ups and downs that characterize entrepre-
neurial life, but you become particularly frustrated by the theft and vandalism that seem so 
much a part of small business. Finally, in an effort to stop the breaking, entering, and mi-
nor theft that has troubled your business, you build a trap in your store. You take up a few 
floorboards in a rear entryway where vandals have broken in, and you pound nails (points 
facing up) into those boards. Then you cover the nail points with some soft felt so they are 
not visible; but when stepped on, the nails will pierce the felt and stab the feet of any in-
truder. Suppose your trap works, and an intruder is injured. Suppose the intruder then sues 
you for his injury. Could you cite self-defense of your property as an excuse? What if a 
police officer stepped on a nail responding to an alarm at your business? The Katko case 
that follows looks at the self-defense theme.
Katko v. Briney, 
183 N.W.2d 
657 (Ia. S.Ct. 1971)
 
Katko sued the Brineys and secured a jury verdict of 
$30,000. The Brineys appealed to the Iowa Supreme Court.

Chief Justice Moore
The primary issue presented here is whether an owner may 
protect personal property in an unoccupied, boarded-up farm-
house against trespassers and thieves by a spring gun capa-
ble of inflicting death or serious injury.
 
We are not here concerned with a man’s right to protect 
his home and members of his family. Defendant’s home was 
several miles from the scene of the incident to which we refer.

Plaintiff testified he knew he had no right to break and 
enter the house with intent to steal bottles and fruit jars 
therefrom. He further testified he had entered a plea of 
guilty to larceny in the nighttime of property of less than $20 
value from a private building. He stated he had been fined 
$50 and costs and paroled during good behavior from a 
60-day jail sentence. Other than minor traffic charges this 
was plaintiff’s first brush with the law. . . .
 
The main thrust of the defendants’ defense in the trial court 
and on this appeal is that “the law permits use of a spring gun 
FACTS
The Brineys, defendants/appellants in this case, owned an un-
occupied farmhouse. During the period from 1957 to 1967, tres-
passers broke into the house, broke windows, and stole some 
items. The Brineys boarded windows and erected “no trespass-
ing” signs on the land. On June 11, 1967, the Brineys  attached a 
20-gauge, loaded shotgun to a bed in the house, pointing the 
barrel toward the bedroom door. They attached a wire to the 
trigger and the bedroom doorknob so that the gun would fire if 
the door were opened. At first, Mr. Briney directed the gun so 
that it would hit an intruder in the stomach, but agreed with 
Mrs. Briney’s suggestion to lower the barrel so that it would 
strike an intruder’s legs. The gun could not be seen from the 
outside, and no warning about it was posted.
 
Katko, the plaintiff/appellee, worked in an Eddyville, Iowa, 
gas station. He and a friend, McDonough, had found antiques—
old bottles and fruit jars—on their first trip to the Briney house, 
which Katko considered to be abandoned. On their second trip, 
they entered the house through a window. Katko opened the 
bedroom door and was shot in the right leg. Much of that leg, 
including part of the tibia, was blown away. Katko was hospital-
ized for 40 days. His leg was in a cast for approximately one 
year, and he was required to wear a brace for an additional 
year. His leg was permanently shortened by the trauma.

in a dwelling or warehouse for the purpose of preventing the 
unlawful entry of a burglar or thief.” . . .
 
In the statement of issues the trial court stated plaintiff 
and his companion committed a felony when they broke and 
 entered defendant’s house. In instruction 2 the court referred 
to the early case history of the use of spring guns and stated 
under the law their use was prohibited except to prevent the 
commission of felonies of violence and where human life is in 
danger. The instruction included a statement that breaking 
and entering is not a felony of violence.
 
Instruction 5 stated, “You are hereby instructed that one may 
use reasonable force in the protection of his property, but such 
right is subject to the qualification that one may not use such 
means of force as will take human life or inflict great bodily injury. 
Such is the rule even though the injured party is a trespasser and 
is in violation of the law himself.”
 
Instruction 6 stated, “An owner of premises is prohibited 
from willfully or intentionally injuring a trespasser by means 
of force that either takes life or inflicts great bodily injury; 
and therefore a person owning a premise is prohibited from 
setting out ‘spring guns’ and like dangerous devices which 
will likely take life or inflict great bodily injury, for the purpose 
of harming trespassers. The fact that the trespasser may be 
acting in violation of the law does not change the rule. The 
only time when such conduct of setting a ‘spring gun’ or a 
like dangerous  device is justified would be when the tres-
passer was committing a  felony of violence or a felony pun-
ishable by death, or where the trespasser was endangering 
human life by his act.” . . .
 
The overwhelming weight of authority, both textbook and 
case law, supports the trial court’s statement of the applica-
ble principles of law.
 
Prosser on Torts, Third Edition, pages 116–18, states,
[T]he law has always placed a higher value upon human 
safety than upon mere rights in property; it is the 
accepted rule that there is no privilege to use any force 
calculated to cause death or serious bodily injury to 
repel the threat to land or chattels, unless there is 
also such a threat to the defendant’s personal safety 
as to justify a self-defense . . . spring guns and other 
man-killing devices are not justifiable against a mere 
trespasser, or even a petty thief. They are privileged 
only against those upon whom the landowner, if he 
were present in person, would be free to inflict injury 
of the same kind.
* * * * *
 
In Hooker v. Miller, 37 Iowa 613, we held defendant vineyard 
owner liable for damages resulting from a spring gun shot al-
though plaintiff was a trespasser and there to steal grapes. At 
pages 614, 615, this statement is made: “This court has held that 
a mere trespass against property other than a dwelling is not a 
sufficient justification to authorize the use of a deadly weapon by 
the owner in its defense; and that if death results in such a case 
it will be murder, though the killing be actually necessary to pre-
vent the trespass. . . .”
 
In Wisconsin, Oregon, and England the use of spring guns 
and similar devices is specifically made unlawful by statute.

Part Two—Product Liability
Introduction
We have examined intentional torts against both persons and property. Now we turn to tort 
and contract claims arising from products.
 
How does the law handle the situation where a wheel falls off a car, or a lighter  explodes 
in a consumer’s face? Product liability lawsuits deal with cases where buyers, users, and in 
Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  289

290  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
some cases bystanders are injured or killed by defective products. Those harmed may have 
causes of action in torts (negligence or strict liability) or contracts (breach of warranty). If 
so, the manufacturers, distributors, and sellers of that product must then defend themselves 
against often enormously expensive claims. Part Two of this chapter explains product 
 liability law and raises some of the public policy considerations that have caused critics to 
call for legal reforms to reduce the burden of product liability lawsuits. [For a product 
 liability overview, see http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/Products_liability]
Product Liability and Business Practice When Blitz USA, manufacturer of the familiar 
red plastic gasoline cans, filed for bankruptcy and shut its Oklahoma factory, The Wall 
Street Journal described Blitz and its employees as the “latest victims” of trial lawyers 
after spending millions on product liability lawsuits, which, in turn, increased its product 
liability insurance costs.4 Plaintiffs in these lawsuits sought damages for serious burn inju-
ries and deaths suffered when Blitz gas cans exploded after gasoline vapors outside the can 
were ignited. The claims alleged that these “flashback” explosions could have been pre-
vented had “flame arrester” shields been installed in the cans.5 
 
Why did Blitz not add the flame arrester to its plastic gasoline cans? Predictably, the  answers 
to that question offered by trial lawyers and Blitz executives vary greatly. According to lawyers 
responding to The Wall Street Journal editorial, these shields were included in Blitz’s metal 
gasoline cans but were removed from their plastic containers, and arguably cost less than $1.00 
per can.6 A lawyer representing plaintiffs against Blitz contended that the company dropped 
plans to add the arresters to their plastic cans as a money-saving maneuver shortly before being 
acquired by a private equity firm.7 Blitz  asserted that adding a flame arrester would not have 
been effective. This defense was successful in a Texas case involving a man who died in an 
explosion when he poured gasoline from a Blitz can onto a fire; however, a federal judge sub-
sequently ruled that internal documents later uncovered might have eliminated that defense if it 
had been presented at trial.8 For example, in 2005, Blitz’s then-CEO, Rocky Flick, wrote a 
2005 memo entitled “My Wish List,” in which he indicates his desire that Blitz cans would 
soon include a “device to eliminate flashback from a flame source.”9 Blitz was ordered to pay 
sanctions and to give the court’s opinion and order to each plaintiff who had sued Blitz in the 
previous two years.10 Flick countered that Blitz executives believed the flame arresters, if in-
stalled, would cause other safety problems, such as creating a false sense of security when pour-
ing gas on an open flame.11
 
Whether you believe that corporate greed or trial lawyers were to blame, Blitz’s 
 closure offers a cautionary tale on the importance of anticipating litigation expenses as a 
part of business strategy. [For a general database on defective products, see http://

Justice for Consumers and for Toyota
As we have seen, product liability law can sometimes be devastating to a company or in-
dustry. As harsh as the consequences may be, the law is often the only recourse for those 
wronged by defective products, and it is one of the most effective methods of curbing 
dangerous business practices. Toyota’s massive product liability dispute has blemished the 
company’s quality image while also apparently threatening the safety of many Toyota 

Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  291
customers. Along with financial losses, Toyota has faced allegations of causing hundreds 
of injuries and deaths. Several safety problems have been raised, but the core allegation is 
that some Toyota vehicles accelerate suddenly and uncontrollably. The plaintiffs attribute 
the problem to defects in the electronic throttle control, but a federal study released in 
2011, concluded that the likely culprits were mechanical defects in the accelerator system 
and floor mats that trapped the accelerator pedal. Plaintiffs also argue that Toyota failed to 
disclose what it knew about the acceleration problem, and that Toyota was negligent in 
failing to install a brake-override system that would automatically release the throttle if the 
brake is depressed. Toyota reportedly discussed the override system with the federal gov-
ernment in 2007 but did not begin installations until 2010. Toyota acknowledges some 
problems with floor mats, but argues that many of the incidents are attributable to operator 
error. In one case, a $10 million settlement was reached following the deaths of four in a 
California accident after the Lexus they were driving sped out of control in a sudden 
 acceleration episode that apparently stemmed from an oversized floor mat trapping the 
 accelerator. 
 
In July 2013, Toyota settled a class-action lawsuit for financial losses for $1.6 billion. 
In October 2013, an Oklahoma jury found Toyota’s electronic throttle system led to injury 
and death in a car crash. At this writing, Toyota is seeking to negotiate a settlement of 
hundreds of personal injury and wrongful death actions.
Question
Could the market alone protect us satisfactorily from dangerous products, or do you think 
the threat of very costly lawsuits is necessary to force American manufacturers to be fully 
responsible in monitoring the safety of the products they build? Explain.

Negligence
The three major product liability causes of action are negligence, breach of warranty, and 
strict liability. In dangerously simplified terms, negligence is a breach of the duty of due 
care. A negligent act is the failure to do what a reasonable person would do or doing what 
a reasonable person would not do. Thus, a producer or distributor has a duty to exercise 
reasonable care in the entire stream of events associated with the development and sale of 
a product. In designing, manufacturing, testing, repairing, and warning of potential dan-
gers, those in the chain of production and distribution must meet the standard of the rea-
sonably prudent person. Failure to do so constitutes negligence. Some decisions also 
extend potential liability to situations in which a product is being put to an unintended but 
reasonably foreseeable misuse.
 
Historically, consumers dealt face-to-face with producers and could bring breach of con-
tract claims if injured by a defective product. However, the development in the modern era 
of multilayered production and distribution systems eliminated that contractual relationship 

292  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
between producer and consumer, making it difficult for consumers to sue producers. Then 
in a famous 1916 decision (McPherson v. Buick Motor Co.),12 the New York high court 
ruled that a consumer could bring a negligence claim against the manufacturer of a defec-
tive automobile even though the consumer did not purchase the car directly from that manu-
facturer. That view has since been broadly adopted, thus permitting victims of negligence to 
bring actions against all careless parties in the chain of production and distribution.
Donald Trump Owes a Duty?
In 1996, Mark Merrill entered a clinic for compulsive gamblers and wrote to Trump Indiana, 
a casino in Gary, Indiana, asking that he be evicted if he ever entered to gamble. Merrill’s 
name appeared on Trump Indiana’s eviction list. Nonetheless, Merrill later gambled at the 
casino suffering substantial losses. In December 1998 and January 1999, Merrill robbed 
banks, apparently to cover his gambling losses. He was convicted of bank robbery, but 
while in prison he filed suit claiming Trump Indiana was negligent in failing to keep him 
from gambling at the casino. Rule on Merrill’s negligence claim. Explain. The four-part 
negligence test that follows will help you resolve Merrill’s claim.
Source: Mark Merrill v. Trump Indiana, Inc., 320 F.3d 729 (7th Cir. 2003).
Negligence Test
To establish a successful negligence claim, the plaintiff must meet each of the following 
requirements:
1. Duty. The plaintiff must establish that the defendant owed a duty of due care to the 
plaintiff. In general, the standard applied is that of the fictitious reasonable man or 
woman. That reasonable person acts prudently, sensibly, and responsibly. The standard 
of reasonableness depends, of course, on the circumstances of the situation.
2. Breach of duty. The plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant breached the duty of 
due care by engaging in conduct that did not conform to the reasonable person standard. 
Breach of the duty of due care may result from either the commission of a careless act 
or the omission of a reasonable, prudent act. Would a reasonable man or woman 
 discharge a firearm in a public park? Would a reasonable person foresee that failure to 
illuminate one’s front entry steps might lead to a broken bone? More formally, we 
might think of reasonable behavior as decision making that weighs the costs and benefits 
of acting or not acting. The reasonable person “takes precautions against harms when 
doing so costs less than the discounted value of the harms risked.”13
3. Causation
a.  Actual cause. Did the defendant’s breach of the duty of due care in fact cause the 
harm in question? Commonly, the “but for” test is applied to determine cause in fact. 
For example, but for the defendant’s failure to stop at the red light, the plaintiff 
 pedestrian would not have been struck down in the crosswalk.

Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  293
b.  Proximate cause. The plaintiff must establish that the defendant’s actions were the 
proximate cause of the injury. As a matter of policy, is the defendant’s conduct 
 sufficiently connected to the plaintiff’s injury as to justify imposing liability? Many 
injuries arise from a series of events—some of them wildly improbable. Did the 
 defendant’s negligence lead directly to the plaintiff’s harm, or did some intervening 
act break the causal link between the defendant’s negligence and the harm? For 
 example, the community’s allegedly negligent maintenance resulted in a blocked 
road, forcing the plaintiff to detour. While on the detour route, the plaintiff’s vehicle 
was struck by a plane that fell from the sky when attempting to land at a nearby airport. 
Was the community’s negligence the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury?14
4. Injury. The plaintiff must have sustained injury, and, due to problems of proof, that injury 
often must be physical. [For a tort law library, see www.findlaw.com/01topics/22tort]
The case that follows asks whether a bowling alley is liable for a patron’s injuries resulting 
from an altercation on its premises.
Hoyt v. Gutterz Bowl &

down. Hoyt and Brittain ignored the waitress’s warning, and 
thus she requested and secured permission from Gutterz’s 
owner, Rodney Atkinson, to discontinue serving them. 
 Atkinson, who had been preparing food in the kitchen, went to 
the bar area to assess the situation. Hoyt and Brittain com-
plained to Atkinson that they were no longer being served and 
continued to taunt Knapp.
Shortly thereafter, Atkinson grew concerned that an alter-
cation might occur. He requested that Hoyt and Brittain 
leave.

Hoyt finished his beer and exited the tavern. As Hoyt walked 
through the parking lot toward his vehicle, [Knapp] . . . struck 
him in the back of the head, knocking him unconscious. Hoyt 
suffered several injuries including a compound fracture of his 
ankle. Knapp admitted to police who later arrived on the scene 
that he had struck Hoyt, but claimed he had done so in self-
defense.

Justice Hecht
Defendant—appellee Gutterz Bowl & Lounge (Gutterz) is a 
bowling alley and tavern located in Guthrie Center, Iowa. On 
March 20, 2009, Curtis Hoyt and several members of his con-
struction crew finished work and went to Gutterz for refresh-
ments. Curtis Knapp was also a customer at Gutterz that 
afternoon. Hoyt soon came to believe that Knapp was scowl-
ing at him. Hoyt and Knapp had formerly been friendly, but ten-
sion had arisen between them as a result of Hoyt’s alleged 
mistreatment of the sister of Knapp’s friend. 
* * * * *
[T]he staff of Gutterz had [no] knowledge of this history 
 between Hoyt and Knapp.
After consuming a few beers, Hoyt and coworker Chris Brittain 
approached and verbally confronted Knapp. Knapp did not re-
spond and continued to scowl at Hoyt. The waitress serving 
Hoyt and Brittain observed their behavior with concern and 
threatened to discontinue serving them unless they calmed 
L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E

294  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
 
Hoyt filed this action alleging that Knapp and Gutterz 
were liable for the injuries he sustained when Knapp as-
saulted him. Gutterz moved for summary judgment, alleging 
Gutterz owed Hoyt no duty of reasonable care, there was 
no evidence of a breach of any duty, and the assault by 
Knapp and Hoyt’s injury were not foreseeable. The district 
court granted Gutterz’s motion for summary judgment and 
dismissed Gutterz from the lawsuit. 
* * * * *
 
The court of appeals reversed the district court’s summary 
judgment ruling. 
* * * * *
III. DISCUSSION
Hoyt contends the district court erred in concluding as a mat-
ter of law that Gutterz did not breach a duty of reasonable care 
under these circumstances. Further, Hoyt contends, the 
 district court erred in its consideration of foreseeability of 
 injury to Hoyt in making its summary judgment ruling.
* * * * *
A. Duty 
[T]he determination of whether a duty is owed under par-
ticular circumstances is a matter of law for the court’s 
 determination.
* * * * *
 
Traditionally . . . a property owner “is ordinarily under no 
duty to exercise any care until he knows or has reason to 
know that the acts of the third person are occurring, or are 
about to occur.”
* * * * *
 
That general proposition was subject to the caveat that a 
duty would be imposed in scenarios where the property owner 
knew or had reason to know of a likelihood of third party con-
duct that could endanger visitors or where the place or char-
acter of the business was such that the property owner should 
reasonably anticipate careless or criminal conduct by third 
parties.
* * * * *
 
Recently . . . we examined a scenario in which the trampo-
line of a landowner had been blown by high winds into a 
nearby roadway, obstructing the travel of and causing injury to 
a driver. . . . We questioned and then rejected an assessment 
of foreseeability of risk in determining whether the landowner 
owed the driver a duty.
* * * * *
 
Instead . . . no-duty rulings should be limited to exceptional 
cases in which “an articulated countervailing principle or policy 
warrants denying or limiting liability in a particular class of cases.”
* * * * *
 
Removing foreseeability from the duty analysis, we must 
consider whether some principle or strong policy considera-
tion justifies exempting Gutterz, or the class of tavern owners 
in general, from the duty to exercise reasonable care. . . . [W]e 
cannot discern . . . any such considerations compelling 
 exemption of tavern owners from the duty. 
* * * * *
 
Accordingly, we conclude Gutterz owed Hoyt a duty of 
 reasonable care under the circumstances presented here. We 
now turn to the question of whether Hoyt raised a genuine is-
sue of material fact regarding the alleged breach of this duty.
B. Reasonable Care
* * * * *
 
While taverns are not insurers of patrons’ safety against 
third-person criminal attacks, various jurisdictions have 
 explained taverns must make reasonable efforts to maintain 
order and supervise and control patrons.
* * * * *
 
That a tavern may create a physical environment where 
instances of misconduct are likely to take place raises con-
verging questions of reasonable care and the appropriate 
scope of liability for the defendant. . . . In a tavern, for ex-
ample, the environment may foreseeably bring about the 
misconduct of a third party, resulting in injury to a plaintiff. 
While the foreseeability of misconduct raises an issue of 
the appropriate level of care, it also raises the issue of 
whether the harm suffered by the plaintiff is within the 
range of risks that may make the defendant’s conduct neg-
ligent in failing to exercise that care. 
* * * * *
 
Here, the district court found that Gutterz exercised rea-
sonable care as a matter of law, based largely on the notion 
that the information available to Gutterz at the time failed to 
suggest any possibility of harm to Hoyt. 
* * * * *
 
[W]e disagree that the record established as a matter of 
law that an injury to Hoyt was unforeseeable. Gutterz’s duty of 
reasonable care applied . . . to risks arising from Hoyt’s con-
duct, as well as those created by a third party’s conduct, 
whether innocent, negligent, or intentional.
* * * * *

Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  295
 
[B]ars are business venues in which alcohol-fueled 
 disturbances causing injury and even death are known to 
occur. 
* * * * *
 
Given the . . .  general tenor of bar behavior, and 
 Atkinson’s own testimony regarding concern about a phys-
ical altercation, we conclude that a reasonable person 
might find the risk of harm to Hoyt foreseeable. Accord-
ingly, that Hoyt may have initiated the conflict cannot serve 
as the basis for summary judgment that Gutterz acted 
 reasonably under the circumstances.
* * * * *
 
Hoyt contends that Gutterz could have exercised rea-
sonable care by any of the following: (1) calling the police 
when the conflict developed, (2) escorting Hoyt to his vehi-
cle in the parking lot, or (3) verifying that Knapp was not 
lying in wait in the parking lot. Gutterz contends that it did 
escort Hoyt to his vehicle, and that its precautions here 
were reasonable as a matter of law. . . . [R]esolution of the 
factual dispute is best left to the fact finder. . . .

[Reversed]
DISSENT
WATERMAN, Justice joined by Cady, C. J., and 
Mansfield, J.
I respectfully dissent. . . . Uncontroverted facts establish the 
defendant acted reasonably as a matter of law.
 
There is no evidence or claim that prior fights or third-
party criminal acts showed a need for a bouncer or other 
 security at Gutterz. Bars are not insurers strictly liable for 
 injuries on their premises inflicted by others. 
* * * * *
 
Having kicked out the troublemakers—Hoyt and his 
 companion—what else should Gutterz have done? How was 
the bar negligent? The majority concludes a jury could find 
Gutterz negligent for failing to call the police. But, no crime 
had (yet) been committed, and Hoyt exited the bar when told 
to leave. Knapp was not threatening anyone or misbehaving 
in any way. At that point, why call the police? From Gutterz’s 
standpoint, the incident had been defused by Hoyt’s depar-
ture. The majority also argues Atkinson should have done 
more to ensure Hoyt left the parking lot safely. This theory 
assumes Atkinson reasonably should have foreseen Knapp 
would attack Hoyt. Knapp had not so much as even raised 
his voice. 
* * * * *
 
I would affirm the district court’s summary judgment in 
 favor of Gutterz.
Questions
1. Why did the Iowa Supreme Court conclude that Gutterz 
owed a duty of reasonable care to Hoyt? According to 
the Court, when would a landowner not owe a duty of 
reasonable care to a plaintiff? Describe a scenario in 
which a landowner would not owe such a duty to an 
injured party.
2. Why should Hoyt, who initiated the conflict with Knapp in 
the Gutterz bar area, be able to recover from Gutterz for 
his resulting injuries? Explain.
3. Both the majority and dissenting opinions offer that 
 taverns are not ensurers of safety of their patrons 
against injury caused by third parties. On what point 
does the dissenting opinion disagree with the majority? 
Do you agree with the majority or dissenting opinion? 
Explain.
4. Jerry Colaitis, 47, went with his family to a Benihana steak-
house in Munsey Park, New York. The Benihana chain is 
well-known for hibachi-style cooking with diners gathered 
around a rectangular wooden table with a hot grill in the 
middle from which the chef, as a form of  entertainment, 
often casually tosses pieces of cooked food at the diners. 
Mrs. Colaitis claimed that the chef struck and burned some 
family members with pieces of tossed food. Mr. Colaitis 
asked the chef to stop, but as he was speaking a piece of 
shrimp was tossed his way, causing Mr. Colaitis to jerk 
away from it resulting in two wrenched vertebrae in his 
neck. Mr. Colaitis underwent a corrective operation then 
suffered a post-operative complication that resulted in a 
blood-borne infection that caused Mr. Colaitis’ death. The 
Colaitis family sued  Benihana for negligence causing the 
death. At trial, the head chef at the Munsey Park restau-
rant conceded that the food tossing practice could be dan-
gerous. The restaurant discontinued the practice. During 
the last year of his life, Mr. Colaitis had suffered from 
 fevers that were not associated with his surgery. How 
would you rule on the Colaitis’ negligence claim? Explain.

296  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
5. Johnny Burnett, described by his mother, Sheila 
 Watters, as a devoted “Dungeons & Dragons” player, 
killed himself. (The record did not disclose his age at the 
time of death.) Watters blamed the death on her son’s 
absorption in the game. She claimed that “he lost 
 control of his own independent will and was driven to 
self-destruction.”
 
 
“Dungeons & Dragons” is an adventure game set in 
an imaginary ancient world; the players assume the 
roles of various characters as suggested by illustrated 
booklets. The play is orchestrated by a player labeled 
the “Dungeon Master.” The outcome of the play is de-
termined by using dice in conjunction with tables pro-
vided with the game. The game’s materials do not 
mention suicide or guns. More than 1 million copies of 
the game have been sold, many to schools where it is 
used as a learning tool.
 
 
In federal district court, Watters brought a wrongful 
death claim against TSR, the manufacturer of 
“ Dungeons & Dragons.” The plaintiff’s complaint al-
leged that TSR  violated its duty of care in two ways: It 
disseminated  “Dungeons & Dragons” literature to 
“mentally fragile  persons,” and it failed to warn that the 
“possible consequences” of playing the game might 
 include “loss of control of the mental processes.” 
 Decide. Explain. See Watters v. TSR, Inc., 904 F.2d 378 
(6th Cir. 1990).
6. Plaintiff was seven months pregnant and the mother of 
17-month-old James. She was standing on the sidewalk, 
and James was in the street. A truck being negligently 
driven bore down on the boy, running him over. The 
shock caused the mother to miscarry and suffer actual 
physical and emotional injury. She brought suit against 
the driver for harm to herself and the infant child.
 
a. What is the issue in this case?
 
b.  Decide the case. Explain. See Amaya v. Home Ice, Fuel 
& Supply Co., 379 P.2d 513 (Cal. S.Ct. 1963). But also see

7. Is a fireworks manufacturer liable for harm to children 
who ignited an explosive that had failed to detonate in the 
town public display the previous day? Explain.
8. An individual took his car to Quality Pontiac in 
 Albuquerque, New Mexico, for repairs and was told to 
leave the car unlocked with the keys in the ignition. The 
lot was fenced, but the gate was unlocked. Billy Garcia 
entered the car lot at 9 PM, apparently looking in the 
cars for something to steal. Garcia stole the individu-
al’s car. The next day at approximately 11 AM, a deputy 
sheriff observed Garcia driving quickly through a 
school zone and pursued him, engaging his sirens and 
emergency lights. Garcia sped the car up to 90 miles an 
hour and collided with Herrera’s car, killing one 
 occupant and seriously injuring the other; Herrera and 
others sued Quality Pontiac. The complaint included an 
affidavit of a sociologist asserting that Albuquerque’s 
car theft rate was the second highest in the United 
States, and that a significant portion of cars stolen had 
been left unlocked and with keys in the ignition. 
 Further, stolen cars were highly likely to be involved in 
joy riding, and nearly 17 percent of stolen cars were 
involved in accidents shortly after the theft. Should 
Quality Pontiac be held liable? Explain. See Herrera 
et al. v. Quality Pontiac, 73 P.3d 181 (N.M. S.Ct. 2003).
Classes of Negligence Claims
Negligence claims emerging from defective products fall into three categories of analysis: 
(1) manufacturing defects, (2) design defects, and (3) inadequate warnings.
Manufacturing Defects
McDonald’s sells a billion cups of coffee each year, in part because its coffee is ex-
tremely hot—180 to 190 degrees—which is exactly what its customers prefer and which, 
McDonald’s believes, produces tastier coffee than the 140 to 145 degrees normally 
achieved at home. In 1992, then 79-year-old Stella Liebeck ordered coffee at an 
 Albuquerque, New Mexico,  McDonald’s drive-through. Her grandson, who was driving, 
296  Unit Two  Introduction to Law

Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  297
pulled forward and stopped so that Liebeck could add cream and sugar to her coffee. The 
dashboard of the car was slanted so that the coffee could not be set on it. Liebeck, there-
fore, placed the coffee between her legs, and while trying to get the top off the container, 
she spilled the coffee on her lap, resulting in third-degree burns. She was hospitalized, 
required skin grafts, and was disabled for two years. She sought a settlement with 
 McDonald’s, but according to her family, McDonald’s offered only $800.15 Liebeck sued, 
accusing McDonald’s of gross negligence for selling coffee that was “unreasonably 
 dangerous” and “defectively manufactured.”16
 
Liebeck was awarded $200,000 in compensatory and $2.7 million in punitive damages. The 
jury found Liebeck 20 percent responsible for her own injury, thus reducing her  compensatory 
award to $160,000. The judge subsequently reduced the punitive award 
to $480,000. The parties then settled out of court for an undisclosed 
amount. According to news reports, the jury awarded Liebeck $2.7 mil-
lion in punitive damages because of what it perceived to be  McDonald’s 
callous attitude toward the accident and because of the more than 700 
previous coffee-burn claims that had been filed against McDonald’s. A McDonald’s human 
factors engineer testified that the number of hot coffee burns was “statistically insignificant” 
when compared with the billions of cups sold by McDonald’s annually.17 [For the “actual facts” 
on the Liebeck/McDonald’s episode, see www.lectlaw.com/files/cur78.htm]
[For the Hot Coffee trailer, see http://hotcoffeethemovie.com]
 
A British High Court justice, however, viewed the hot coffee situation quite differently:
Persons generally expect tea or coffee purchased to be consumed on the premises to be 
hot. . . . They accordingly know that care must be taken to avoid such spills.18
[For a  practical guide to the law of accidents and injuries, see www.nolo.com

The number of hot coffee 
burns was “statistically 
 insignificant.”
McDonald’s “Exploding” Chicken Sandwich
Frank Sutton bought a McDonald’s fried chicken sandwich at the Daniel Boone Truck Stop in 
Duffield, Virginia, on August 8, 2005. When he bit into the sandwich, Sutton said,  “the grease 
from the inside of the chicken sandwich spread out all over my bottom lip, my top lip, down 
onto my chin.” Sutton immediately dropped the sandwich. His wife dabbed his face with ice as 
blisters formed on his lips.  Sutton reported the incident to a pair of McDonald’s employees, one 
of whom reportedly said, “This is what happens to the sandwiches when they aren’t drained 
completely.”  Sutton’s lips continued to bother him. He went to a doctor who provided lip balm 
and told Sutton to avoid excessive exposure to sunlight. Sutton thereafter sued McDonald’s and 
the local franchise owner, Roth, for negligence, among other claims. At trial in a Virginia 
 federal district court, Sutton testified that he thought the sandwich was “negligently  prepared” 
or  “defective,” but the judge rejected Sutton’s negligence claim reasoning that Sutton failed to 
establish the standard of care that Virginia product liability law requires.  (Using either federal 
standards, state standards, or reasonable consumer expectations,  Sutton was required to demon-
strate a standard of care that was breached leading to his  injury.) The judge also ruled that 

298  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
Res Ipsa As we see with the McDonald’s cases, allegedly improper manufacturing of prod-
ucts often generates negligence claims. However, the extremely complex process of produc-
ing, distributing, and using a product sometimes so obscures the root of the injury in question 
that proof of fault is nearly impossible to establish. In those circumstances, many courts have 
adopted the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur (the thing speaks for itself), which in some cases 
permits the court to infer the defendant’s negligence even though that negligence cannot 
be proved—that is, the facts suggest that the plaintiff’s injury must have resulted from the 
 defendant’s negligence, but the circumstances are such that the plaintiff is unable to prove 
negligence. A showing of res ipsa loquitur requires that (1) the injury was caused by an instru-
mentality under the control of the defendant, (2) the accident ordinarily would not happen 
absent the defendant’s negligence, and (3) there is no evidence of other causes for the 
 accident.19
Design Defects
From Cessna’s single-engine airplanes to five-gallon buckets (which may hold liquid suf-
ficient to drown a child) to automobile seat belts and on across the spectrum of American 
products, manufacturers must think about designing products to anticipate and avoid con-
sumer injury. Two principal lines of analysis have emerged in these cases: (1) The risk–utility 
test holds that a product is negligently designed if the  benefits of a product’s design are 
outweighed by the risks that accompany that design. (2) The consumer expectations test 
imposes on the manufacturer a duty to design its products so that they are safe not only for 
their intended use but also for any reasonably foreseeable use.
 
In 1997 members of the American Law Institute, a group of legal experts, approved the 
Restatement of the Law Third, Torts: Products Liability, which does not constitute law but 
represents those experts’ best judgment about what the law should be. They have recom-
mended to the courts a design defect standard that supports the balancing/risk–utility 
model and gives much less attention to consumer expectations. Furthermore, a product 
would be considered defective in design only if its foreseeable risks could have been re-
duced or avoided by a reasonable alternative design and if failure to include that design 
makes the product not reasonably safe. That is, plaintiffs would need to show that some 
better design was available and was not incorporated in the product in question. The case 
that follows involves, according to the California Supreme Court, a risk–benefit argument 
by the plaintiffs seeking civil damages after a mass murder.20
 Sutton was contributorily negligent (contributed to his own harm) by failing to “exercise rea-
sonable care to see that [he wasn’t] eating something too hot.” Sutton appealed to the Fourth 
Circuit Court of  Appeals.

variety of handguns, but seemed mainly interested in a “high-
capacity type” gun, “something relatively compact that holds 
a lot of rounds.” He gave no indication he had previously heard 
of the TEC-9 or the Intratec brand . . . Later that day, he returned 
the weapon, stating that he wanted a new gun instead.
 
On April 25, 1993, Ferri bought a new TEC-DC9 from Super 
Pawn, a gun store in Las Vegas, Nevada. . . . Ferri questioned 
[another] customer about the TEC-DC9. . . . The customer 
said that people at a shooting range would “probably laugh 
at” Ferri if he used a TEC-DC9 “because it wasn’t really an 
accurate weapon” and that a .22-caliber gun was better for 
“plinking” than a gun because ammunition for the former 
was much cheaper. Ferri nevertheless chose the TEC-DC9.
 
Ferri purchased another TEC-DC9 on May 8, 1993, at a Las 
Vegas gun show. . . .
 
To purchase the new weapons, Ferri showed an appar-
ently valid Nevada driver’s license and answered required 
questions about his criminal history and residency. All of the 
distributors and retailers were licensed by the federal Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and [s]o far as the record 
shows, all of the transactions were legal . . . other than Ferri’s 
misrepresentations as to his state of residence.
 
On July 1, 1993, Ferri entered 101 California Street carrying 
the TEC-9/DC9s and a .45-caliber Norinco Model 1911A1 pistol 
in a large briefcase and another bag. He had added to the 
 TEC-DC9’s Hell-Fire brand trigger systems that made the 
weapons fire in rapid bursts, and he was equipped with 
 hundreds of rounds of ammunition preloaded into 40- to 
50-round magazines. He went to the 34th floor, to the office of 
a law firm he held a grudge against, and started shooting. 
 During his rampage, he killed eight people and wounded six on 
three different floors, and then killed himself.
* * * * *
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs’ first amended complaint asserted a cause of 
 action against Navegar for “common law negligence.” In 
this claim, plaintiffs alleged that Navegar knew or should 
have known that (1) the TEC-9/DC9 is a “small, easily con-
cealable military,  assault weapon; (2) it has “no legitimate 
sporting . . . or self-defense purpose and is particularly well 
adapted to a military-style assault on large numbers of people”; 
(3) it is “disproportionately associated with criminal activity”; 
(4) it is “more attractive to criminals” because of its “firepower” 
and “other features”; (5) its “firepower was likely to be 
Justice Chin
On July 1, 1993, Gian Luigi Ferri killed eight people and 
wounded six—and then killed himself—during a shooting 
rampage at 101 California Street, a high-rise office building in 
San Francisco. Survivors and representatives of some of 
 Ferri’s victims (plaintiffs) sued defendant Navegar, Inc., which 
made two of the three weapons Ferri used.
 
We granted review to determine whether plaintiffs may 
hold Navegar liable on a common law negligence theory.
* * * * *
 
Navegar advertised the TEC-9/DC9 in a number of gun- 
related magazines and annuals. . . . A typical advertisement 
claimed that in light of the TEC-9/DC9’s design features— 
including “32 rounds of firepower,” a “‘TEC-KOTE’ finish,” and 
“two-step disassembly for easy cleaning”—the weapon is 
“ideal for self-defense or recreation,” “stands out among 
high-capacity assault-type pistols,” and “delivers more gutsy 
performance and reliability than ANY other gun on the mar-
ket.” Navegar also distributed an advertising brochure or cat-
alog describing its guns and accessories, which it mailed to 
anyone interested and, on at least one occasion, printed in 
special issue magazines. In a page describing the TEC-KOTE 
finish, Navegar claimed the finish provided “natural lubicity 
[sic] to increase bullet velocities, excellent resistance to fin-
gerprints, sweat rust, petroleum distillates of all types, gun 
solvents, gun cleaners, and all powder residues. Salt spray 
corrosion resistance, expansion and contraction of the metal 
will not result in peeling of finish.” A different brochure adver-
tising to retailers used the slogan, “Intratec: Weapons that are 
as tough as your toughest customer.”
 
Navegar included a manual with each TEC-9/DC9 it sold. 
The 1993 manual contained safety warnings, technical infor-
mation, and operating instructions. It also claimed the gun was 
“a radically new type of semi automatic pistol,” which was 
“designed to deliver a high volume of firepower” and, “thanks 
to its dimensions and designs,” could “be used in modes of 
fire impossible with most handguns.” Regarding the latter 
claim, the manual described and illustrated several recom-
mended shooting positions, including “hipfire at shortest 
range,” a two-handed hold with the nontrigger hand placed on 
the upper part of the magazine well.
 
In early 1993 Ferri, a Southern California resident, bought a 
[used] TEC-9 from the Pawn & Gun Shop in Henderson, 
 Nevada. . . . According to the salesperson, Ferri looked at a wide

 enhanced by the addition of products such as high-capacity 
magazines” and “the Hell-Fire trigger  system”; and (6) it 
“would be used to kill or injure innocent persons in violent 
criminal acts such as the mass killing committed by Ferri.” 
Plaintiffs also alleged that Navegar “acknowledges that 
publicity surrounding the [TEC-9/DC9s] reputation as a 
weapon favored by criminals increases its sales.” Thus, 
plaintiffs alleged, Navegar “acted negligently by manufac-
turing, marketing, and making available for sale to the gen-
eral public” the TEC-9/DC9.
* * * * *
 
Navegar moved for summary judgment. As to common law 
negligence, it argued it owed plaintiffs no duty not to advertise 
the TEC-9/DC9 and that plaintiffs had no evidence Ferri saw or 
was affected by a Navegar advertisement.
 
In opposing the motion, plaintiffs argued that Navegar had 
misconstrued the ordinary negligence claim. They explained 
that, contrary to Navegar’s assertion, their negligence claim 
did “not depend on whether” Navegar had a “duty . . . not to 
advertise” or “whether there is a causal link between Nave-
gar’s advertising and plaintiffs’ injuries.” From the start, plain-
tiffs have made clear their ordinary negligence claim is not 
based on Navegar’s negligent advertising but rather its deci-
sion to “‘make available for sale to the general public guns . . . 
which [it] knew or should have known have “no legitimate 
sporting or self-defense purpose” and which are “particularly 
well-adapted to a military-style assault on large numbers of 
people.”’ Simply put, Navegar breached a duty of care by mak-
ing the TEC-9 available to the general public, i.e., “by releasing 
the weapons for sale to the general public even though it 
knew or should have known that the TEC-9 was particularly 
attractive to criminals and particularly suited for mass kill-
ings.” Plaintiffs concluded their argument regarding duty by 
asserting that “Navegar breached a legal duty to forebear 
[sic] distributing the TEC-9 to the general public given the like-
lihood that doing so would lead to the sort of violent criminal 
act that occurred at the 101 California Street Building.”
 
As to causation, plaintiffs also argued that in light of their 
negligence theory, “whether Ferri actually saw or was influ-
enced by any particular Navegar advertising is immaterial.” 
They explained, “The ordinary negligence claim is directed to 
Navegar’s conduct in making the TEC-9 available to the public. 
It is that unreasonable conduct that was a substantial factor in 
causing plaintiffs’ injuries, not Navegar’s marketing efforts.” 
“Navegar’s advertising is only material to the ordinary negli-
gence claim in that it underscores that the criminal use of the 
weapon was foreseeable to Navegar. . . . Plaintiffs are not 
 alleging that Ferri was induced to purchase the TEC-DC9s or to 
commit the 101 massacre by any particular advertisements. 
The significance of the advertisements is what they say about 
[Navegar’s] knowledge of [its] market.”
* * * * *
DISCUSSION
* * * * *
[I]n the trial court, Navegar argued in effect that the Legisla-
ture, through section 1714.4, established an exception that 
applies in this case. Section 1714.4 provides; “(a) In a prod-
ucts liability action, no firearm or ammunition shall be 
deemed defective in design on the basis that the benefits of 
the product do not outweigh the risk of injury posed by its 
potential to cause serious injury, damage, or death when dis-
charged. (b) For purposes of this section: (1) The potential of 
a firearm or ammunition to cause serious injury, damage, or 
death when discharged does not make the product defective 
in design. (2) Injuries or damages resulting from the dis-
charge of a firearm or ammunition are not proximately 
caused by its potential to cause serious injury, damage, or 
death, but are proximately caused by the actual discharge of 
the product. (c) This section shall not affect a products liabil-
ity cause of action based upon the improper selection of 
 design alternatives.” . . . Navegar argues that this statute, by 
establishing a state policy of exempting manufacturers of 
 legal, nondefective firearms “from liability for their criminal 
use,” bars plaintiffs’ negligence claim.
 
Plaintiffs respond that section 1714.4 “has no application to 
this case because it is not a products liability action.” Plaintiffs 
assert that they “seek to hold Navegar liable for its negligent 
conduct, not for making a defective product,” and that they 
“make no assertion that Navegar should be liable because the 
risks posed by the TEC-9 outweigh its benefits.” . . . [W]e reject 
plaintiffs’ argument that section 1714.4 is inapplicable because 
this case “is not a products liability action.”. . .
 
[C]ontrary to the assertion of plaintiffs, the record demon-
strates that plaintiffs do, in fact, seek to hold Navegar liable 
precisely because, as the trial court stated, the TEC-9/DC9’s 
“potential for harm substantially outweighs any possible ben-
efit to be derived from [it].” In their brief, plaintiffs assert that 
Navegar is liable because it “designed and widely distributed 
a weapon uniquely suited for mass killing and lacking legiti-
mate civilian uses.”
 
Using the words of the risk–utility test for both products li-
ability theories, plaintiffs essentially allege, argue, and hope to 
prove that the TEC-9/DC9 is defective in design. Thus this is a 
products liability action based on negligence, which asserts 
that the TEC-9/DC9 was defective in design because the risks 

Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  301
of making it available to the general public outweighed the 
benefits of that conduct, and that defendants knew or should 
have known this fact.
* * * * *
 
Finally, we also conclude that the evidence in the record 
regarding Navegar’s promotional activities and the literature it 
distributed with the TEC-9/DC9 does not save plaintiffs’ negli-
gence claim. As we have previously explained, in opposing 
Navegar’s summary judgment motion, plaintiffs insisted that 
“their ordinary negligence claim” was not “directed to” or 
“based on Navegar’s negligent advertising but rather its deci-
sion to make [the TEC-9/DC9] available for sale to the general 
public. . . .” Plaintiffs also insisted that it was Navegar’s “un-
reasonable conduct” in “making the TEC-9 available to the 
public . . . that was a substantial factor in causing [their] inju-
ries, not Navegar’s marketing efforts.” Thus, they maintained, 
“whether Ferri actually saw or was influenced by any particu-
lar Navegar advertising is immaterial.”. . . . Plaintiffs are not 
alleging that Ferri was induced to purchase the TEC-DC9s or to 
commit the 101 massacre by any particular advertisements. 
The significance of the advertisements is what they say about 
[Navegar’s] knowledge of [its] market.”
* * * * *
 
In any event, the evidence in the record fails to raise a tri-
able factual issue as to whether Navegar’s advertising and 
literature were substantial factors in causing plaintiffs’ inju-
ries. Regarding this question, plaintiffs’ counsel asserted at 
oral argument that “Navegar’s liability does not depend on its 
telling the public, here’s a great gun to commit a crime,” but on 
its “communicating a message that people who want above all 
else in their weapons firepower, the capacity to shoot many, 
many rounds without the need to reload, and to use that gun in 
a combat fashion, this is the gun for you.”
* * * * *
 
To the extent plaintiffs rely on allegedly more inflammatory 
aspects of Navegar’s advertising, they fail to raise a triable 
factual issue regarding causation. For example, they offer no 
evidence, direct or circumstantial, that Ferri ever saw the pro-
motional materials sent to dealers, which used the phrase 
“tough as your toughest customer,” or the early version of the 
TEC-KOTE product brochure description, which promised “ex-
cellent resistance to fingerprints.” Moreover, plaintiffs do not 
dispute that (1) San Francisco police inspectors did “not re-
call” finding “any TEC-DC9 magazine advertisement in Ferri’s 
apartment” and found “no evidence” that any advertisement 
caused Ferri to travel to Nevada to purchase the TEC-DC9s; 
(2) “there is otherwise no Navegar magazine advertisement in 
the possession of the City and County of San Francisco as 
 evidence collected in the 101 California Street shootings”; 
(3) the salesman at the Pawn & Gun Shop in Henderson, 
 Nevada, where Ferri bought the used TEC-9, “never” saw Ferri 
in possession of any advertisement or literature for the TEC-9 
or TEC-DC9, and never heard Ferri mention he had seen any 
advertisement for the TEC-9 or TEC-DC9; (4) when Ferri bought 
the first new TEC-9/DC9, he had no firearms advertisement or 
other type of literature in his possession and did not ask for the 
TEC-9/DC9 by name; and (5) when Ferri bought the second 
new TEC-9/DC9, he indicated he already owned another 
TEC-9/DC9. Plaintiffs have failed to produce, or show that they 
will be able to produce at trial, substantial evidence “that 
Navegar’s marketing style was ‘a factor’ in” Ferri’s conduct. . . .
 
In arguing to the contrary, plaintiffs cite evidence that Ferri 
went to Nevada, where the TEC-9/DC9 was available, to buy 
guns for his planned attack and that the two stores where he 
bought TEC-9/DC9s had Las Vegas Yellow Pages advertise-
ments picturing, among other guns, assault weapons. Al-
though this evidence does tend to show Ferri sought to 
purchase high-firepower guns, it does not tend to show Ferri 
went to Nevada or the stores in search of a TEC-9/DC9 or other 
assault pistol in response to Navegar’s marketing efforts. The 
existence of various high-firepower rifles and pistols would 
have been so widely known from other sources (especially to 
a reader of gun magazines as, apparently, Ferri was) as to ren-
der unjustified any inference that Navegar’s marketing efforts 
were a substantial factor in motivating Ferri’s decision to seek 
such a gun. Thus, we agree with the trial court that “the links 
plaintiffs seek to establish between advertisements and car-
nage amount to little more than guesswork.” . . .
 
Accordingly, we conclude the trial court properly granted 
Navegar summary judgment. . . . In section 1714.4, the Legisla-
ture has set California’s public policy regarding a gun manu-
facturer’s liability under these circumstances. Given that

claim.
 
Reversed.
DISSENTING OPINION BY JUSTICE WERDEGAR
I cannot accept the majority’s conclusion that plaintiffs are 
statutorily barred from suing the maker of the semiautomatic 
assault weapon used to massacre the victims in this case.
* * * * *
 
Civil Code section 1714.4 bars product liability actions against 
gunmakers based on the risk–benefit theory of product defect. 
The legislative policy behind the statute might, at most, be 

302  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
deemed also to encompass negligence claims that are sub-
stantially identical to risk–benefit product defect claims. 
Plaintiffs’ claim is neither. Plaintiffs’ claim of negligence is, at 
bottom, that defendant Navegar, Inc., acted without due care 
in distributing the TEC-9/DC9 to the general civilian public 
rather than restricting its sales to police and military units that 
might have a legitimate call for such a military-style assault 
pistol. Plaintiffs do not claim that the TEC-9/DC9 is defective; 
nor do they even claim that defendant acted negligently simply 
by making the TEC-9/DC9. Plaintiffs allege negligence, rather, 
in Navegar’s selling that firearm on the general civilian market 
knowing it would attract purchasers likely to misuse it, rather 
than restricting sales to buyers with a lawful use for the tools 
of assaultive violence. . . . This theory of negligence, resting on 
the allegation that particular marketing choices by Navegar 
were imprudent, is not substantially identical to a claim of 
product defect and thus is within neither the letter nor the 
spirit of Civil Code section 1714.4.
 
Navegar’s conduct was allegedly negligent not because 
its gun was defective but because, in light of the gun’s known 
attractiveness to violent users and the lack of a compelling 
need for its availability on the civilian market, a reasonably 
careful distributor would have restricted sales to groups un-
likely to misuse the firearm. Civil Code section 1714.4 simply 
does not address such a negligent distribution claim.

AFTERWORD
Subsequent to the Merrill v. Navegar decision, Congress and 
President Bush enacted a 2005 law, the Protection of Lawful 
Commerce in Arms Act, to substantially shield firearms manu-
facturers and dealers from civil claims when guns are used in 
violent crimes.
Questions
1. a.  Why did the California Supreme Court rule in favor of 
Navegar in this case?
 
b. Explain the plaintiffs’ cause of action.
 
c. Explain the dissenting opinion.
 
d.  Argue that the plaintiffs’ claim did not involve a risk–
benefit analysis of the kind forbidden by the California 
statute.
2. In your opinion, should gun manufacturers be liable for 
the criminal use of their products? Explain.
3. Some observers argued that a decision for the plaintiffs in 
the Merrill/Navegar case would have led to a product lia-
bility “slippery slope.” Explain that argument. Do you 
agree with it? Explain.
4. Hollister was badly burned when her shirt came into contact 
with a burner as she leaned over her electric stove. She 
sued the store where she bought the shirt, claiming that it 
was defectively designed. What proof will Hollister need to 
provide to win her defective design claim? See Hollister v. 
Dayton-Hudson, 188 F.3d 414 (6th Cir. 1999).
Warnings
Warnings seem to be everywhere in our lives. Some of them seem downright silly—so 
much so that the Foundation for Fair Civil Justice [www.foundationforfairciviljustice
.org/] hosts a “Wacky Warning Labels” contest. Leading recent entries included these:
“Remove child before folding”—on a child car safety seat!
“Harmful if swallowed”—a warning on a brass fishing lure with a three-pronged hook.21
Even though the use of warnings can be abused, we should remember that they help  protect 
us from foreseeable dangers. For example, in 2007, the federal Consumer Product Safety 
Commission (see Chapter 15)  ordered warnings on all new generators and generator pack-
aging after recording 94 deaths in 2005 from generator-related carbon monoxide poisoning 
with at least 83 more deaths in 2006 and 43 in 2007.22
 
A product may be considered defective because of inadequate warnings when reasona-
ble warnings would have reduced or avoided the foreseeable risks and the failure to warn 
resulted in a product that was not reasonably safe. Courts might also consider the feasibil-
ity of an effective warning and the probable seriousness of the injury. The case that follows 
raises a failure to warn product liability claim.
302  Unit Two  Introduction to Law

White v. Victor Automotive 
Products 
2010 Mich. App. LEXIS 914 
(unpublished)
closed.1 Tools were under the car and the bandage was found 
wrapped around the muffler. White was found near the exit to 
the  garage. The police report stated in pertinent part:
In the garage I observed the Buick to be elevated on a 
jack stand. Underneath the Buick I observed a small, 
rolling platform, that is used to enable a subject to crawl 
underneath a vehicle and assist with mobility while 
working on the vehicle. I further observed an activated 
utility light as well as several tools and accessories lying 
on the floor. On the rear trunk area of the Buick, I 
observed an empty package that contained a muffler 
repair kit. By looking at the picture on the muffler repair 
kit, and observing the muffler underneath the Buick, it was 
apparent that the victim had in fact used the kit as its 
contents were on the muffler.
 
When Detective Steinaway arrived, I assisted in his 
investigation. During the investigation, I collected the empty 
package from the Buick to be placed as evidence at LCSD. 
While reading instructions listed on the back of the 
package, it appeared as though the victim went step by step 
with the directions. The final instruction on these directions 
was to turn on the automobile and allow it to run for 
approximately ten minutes, which would in turn allow the 
bonding agent applied to the muffler to heat up and activate 
properly. This could be a possible explanation for why the 
vehicle’s ignition was activated and running. While reading 
the warning label on the package listed directly below the 
instructions, it did not advise of the dangers of carbon 
monoxide. [Emphasis added.]
An autopsy confirmed that White died of asphyxiation from 
carbon monoxide.
Plaintiff’s complaint alleged two violations of the duty to 
warn. First, plaintiff alleged that “Defendants breached their 
duty of care . . . in failing to include an instruction with the 
product that vehicles should not be run in an enclosed 
space or must be moved outside before starting the engine 
as directed [in the instructions].” Second, that “Defendant’s 
breached their duty of care . . . in failing to warn of the 
dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning.”

After a hearing, the trial court granted summary disposition to 
defendants, concluding:
[I]t’s clear that the material risk of death due to carbon

Douglas B. Shapiro)
1. Summary of Facts and Proceedings
Plaintiff’s decedent, Craig White, purchased a muffler repair 
kit manufactured and marketed by defendants. The kit 
 included a metal patch to be placed over the hole in the 
 muffler, a strip of “bandage” to be wrapped around the patch 
and the muffler to hold the patch in place, and mechanic’s 
wire to wrap around and secure the bandage. The packaging 
 described the product as a “Muffler and Tail Pipe Repair 
Kit” and stated, “Just wrap it on for instant repair.” The 
 instructions included with the kit, however, directed the user 
to “start the engine and run at idle for at least 10 minutes” 
 after applying the “bandage.” The instructions provided with 
the kit read in total:
INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Allow exhaust system and muffler to cool to a touch.
2.  Clean surface of muffler or pipe to be repaired with 
sand paper, steel wool, or wire brush.
3.  Cover holes with included metal heat shield, or by using 
metal or tin can.
4. Open foil packet containing bandage.
5.  Wrap bandage completely around damaged area, 
overlapping each wrapping at least 3/4 inch. Note: 
Large repairs may require more than one bandage to 
adequately cover repair.
6. Secure bandage with mechanic’s wire enclosed.
7. Start engine and run at idle for at least 10 minutes.
8. Bandage will cure with heat from exhaust system.
WARNING: Always wear safety classes and cloth or leather 
gloves when working on exhaust systems. Rust and debris 
can injure eyes and skin. Flush eyes thoroughly with water 
if contacted–for skin use soap and water. Never work 
on vehicle suspended in air NOT supported by adequate 
jack stands.
IF SWALLOWED, DRINK WATER AND GET IMMEDIATE 
MEDICAL ATTENTION. [Emphasis in original.]
 
White attempted to perform the muffler repair on April 29, 
2005. According to the testimony of White’s wife and son, 
when they left the house at about 11:00 A.M., White was in the 
driveway, working on the muffler. When they returned at about 
2:15 P.M., they found White dead in the garage with the car up 
on a floor jack, the motor running and the garage door

remains unknown. 

304  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
enclosed garage would be obvious to the reasonably prudent 
user of a muffler repair kit. I don’t think you can really argue 
that much about it. . . . I think it would be obvious and that 
would be to the general public, and it would be especially 
obvious to someone who used motors. Granted he may have 
been an . . . outboard engine mechanic, but nevertheless, it 
seems to me that he was in a position especially to know this 
even more than an average citizen. But nevertheless, to a 
reasonably prudent person it would be obvious this was a 
highly dangerous thing. I think it is common knowledge that 
it’s a dangerous thing and—especially when you look at so 
many other options he would have had, like just open the 
garage door, might have been a lot better.
Plaintiff now appeals.
* * * * *
A. REASONABLY PRUDENT PRODUCT USER
[T]he first issue is whether a reasonable juror could find that 
the material risk of remaining in a closed garage with a run-
ning automobile while the muffler bandage cures is or should 
be “obvious to a reasonably prudent product user.”. . .
* * * * *
 
Given the lack of an obvious risk of harm contained within 
the product’s appearance or function, defendants argue that 
no reasonable person could fail to know that remaining pre-
sent while running a car in a closed garage while the muffler 
bandage cured carried with it a risk of material harm. For rea-
sonable minds not to differ on the issue, it would have to be 
obvious that the exhaust contained carbon monoxide or other 
injurious chemicals and that exposure for a period long 
enough for the muffler bandage to cure created a material risk 
of harm.
 
A fact finder may ultimately conclude that defendants are 
correct that a reasonably prudent person would be aware that 
automobile exhaust contains carbon monoxide or other injuri-
ous chemicals and that exposure for a period long enough for 
the muffler bandage to cure creates a material risk of harm. 
However, defendants have not provided any evidence from 
which such a conclusion may be drawn. . . .
 
At the time of the motion, plaintiff had proffered several 
 articles and data that significant numbers of people, as many as 
100 per year die, from accidental carbon monoxide poisoning in 
Michigan in a manner that supports plaintiff’s claim that the 
 danger of exposure to automobile exhaust is not necessarily 
 “obvious to a reasonably prudent user.” Plaintiff also presented 
an expert affidavit in this regard. Finally, plaintiff submitted 
 warnings from devices that create carbon monoxide exhaust.
* * * * *
 
In contrast to plaintiff’s presentation, the defense did 
not proffer any evidence supporting its contention that a 
reasonable person would know that carbon monoxide is 
present in automobile exhaust or that an exposure long 
enough for the muffler bandage to cure presents a material 
risk of harm.
* * * * *
 
Defendants provided no evidence in the present case that 
a reasonable person would know that an exposure to auto-
mobile exhaust in a garage for the time needed to cure the 
muffler repair presented a risk of material harm. Indeed, the 
only evidence in the record at this time is the data provided by 
plaintiff that significant numbers of people die from acciden-
tal carbon monoxide poisoning and the affidavit from plain-
tiff’s expert supporting plaintiff’s claim that the danger was 
not  obvious. Under these circumstances, defendants were 
not  entitled to summary disposition on the question of 
whether the risk of material harm from carbon monoxide 
 inhalation from running an automobile long enough to cure 
this muffler  product is or should be obvious to a reasonably 
prudent  product user.
* * * * *
 
We take no position on whether a reasonably prudent user 
knows that automobile exhaust contains carbon monoxide nor 
that a exposure long enough to cure the muffler bandage can 
cause material harm. . . . Rather, we hold that there was insuf-
ficient evidence in the record as it presently exists to make 
that determination as a matter of law. . . .
 
Reversed and remanded.
Judge Kirsten F. Kelly Dissenting
I disagree with my colleagues’ conclusion that the trial court’s 
grant of summary disposition in this matter was premature. . . . 
[R]unning the engine of a car in a small, enclosed space, such 
as a garage, is an obvious material risk to a reasonably pru-
dent product user and would be especially obvious to a person 
like decedent whose employment involved servicing and re-
pairing engines. I would affirm the trial court.
* * * * *
Questions
1. Do you agree with the lower court that the risk of carbon 
monoxide poisoning from running a car in an enclosed 
 garage would be obvious to the reasonably prudent user? 
Explain.

Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  305
2. Why did the plaintiff win this case on appeal?
3. Michigan law bars liability in these situations if the risk “is 
or should be a matter of common knowledge to persons in 
the same or similar positions.” Craig White had some, 
 unspecified experience in servicing and repairing marine 
engines. He had also served as an “engine dynamo techni-
cian” and a “marine technician.” Is that background, in 
and of itself, sufficient to establish that the carbon monox-
ide risk was a matter of “common knowledge” to White? 
Explain.
4. Bresnahan, age 50 and 5’8” tall, was driving her Chrysler 
LeBaron, equipped with a driver’s side air bag, at between 
25 and 30 miles per hour. She was seated less than one 
foot from the air bag cover. Bresnahan was distracted by 
police lights and rear-ended a Jaguar, triggering the 
 LeBaron air bag, which broke Bresnahan’s arm and 
caused various abrasions. The vehicle did not include a 
warning about the danger of sitting too close to the air bag. 
Was the vehicle defective because of the absence of a 
warning? Explain. See Bresnahan v. Chrysler Corp., 65 Cal. 
App. 4th 1149 (1998).
5. Laaperi installed a smoke detector in his bedroom, prop-
erly connecting it to his home’s electrical system. Six 
months later, Laaperi’s house burned and three of his 
children were killed. A short circuit, which caused the 
fire, also deprived the A.C.-powered smoke detector of 
electricity. Thus, the detector did not sound a warning. 
Laaperi then claimed that Sears, Roebuck, where he 
purchased the detector, was guilty of negligence for 
failing to warn him that a fire might disable his smoke 
detector such that no warning would issue. How would 
you rule in this case? See Laaperi v. Sears, Roebuck & 
Co., 787 F.2d 726 (1st Cir. 1986).
Negligence Defenses: Introduction
Even if the plaintiff has established all of the necessary ingredients in a negligence claim, 
the defendant may still prevail by asserting a good defense. The two most prominent legal 
defenses in these cases are (1) comparative or contributory negligence and (2) assumption 
of the risk.
A trampoline at the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house at the University of Denver led 
to a broken neck and paralysis when a 20-year-old fraternity member, Oscar Whitlock, 
unsuccessfully attempted a flip at 10 pm in the dark. Whitlock 
had extensive experience with trampolines. The day of the acci-
dent he had slept until 2 pm after drinking that morning until 
2 am. The trampoline was located in front of the house on uni-
versity land that was leased by the fraternity. The trampoline had 
been used over a 10-year period by students and community members. A number of 
injuries had resulted. The university kept its own trampoline under lock and key 
 because of safety concerns.
 
At trial the jury found the university 72 percent at fault, with the remainder of the blame 
lying with the plaintiff/student. He recovered 72 percent of $7,300,000 ($5,256,000). On 
appeal the judgment was upheld but the dissent argued that the university had no duty to 
warn against obvious risks, saying that “no reasonable person could conclude that the 
plaintiff was not at least as negligent as the defendant.” Hence the dissent was saying, in 
effect, that the plaintiff had assumed the risk and, in any case, was himself arguably more 
negligent than the university.23
 
The Colorado State Supreme Court then reviewed the appeals court decision and re-
versed on the grounds that the university did not maintain a “special relationship” with the 
Oscar Whitlock unsuccessfully 
attempted a flip at 10 pm 
in the dark.

plaintiff that would have justified imposing a duty of due care on the university to ensure 
safe use of the trampoline.24
Questions
Assume you own an amusement park.
1. Would the dissent’s reasoning in the Whitlock court of appeals decision apply to the 
trampoline in your amusement park business? Explain.
2. Would a warning and close supervision protect you from liability under the court of 
 appeals decision? Explain.
3. Would you have the duty of due care for your customers that the Supreme Court said 
the University of Denver did not have for Whitlock? Explain.
Negligence Defenses: Rules
Let’s look more closely at the central defenses in negligence cases.
Comparative Negligence
Most states have adopted comparative negligence as a defense; an approach that 
 involves weighing the relative negligence of the parties. Though the formula varies 
from state to state, typically the plaintiff’s recovery is reduced by a percentage equal to 
the percentage of the plaintiff’s fault in the case. Assume a plaintiff sustained $10,000 
in injuries in an accident. If the plaintiff’s own negligence is found to be 20 percent 
responsible for the injuries, then the plaintiff’s recovery will be reduced to $8,000. In 
many states, however, when the plaintiff is more than 50 percent at fault, she or he will 
be barred from recovery.
Contributory Negligence
Rather than employing the comparative negligence doctrine, a few states continue to 
 follow the historic rule that any contribution by the plaintiff to his or her own harm consti-
tutes a complete bar to recovery. This is called contributory negligence. If the plaintiff is 
found to have contributed in any way to his or her injury, even if that contribution is 
 minuscule, he or she is unable to recover.
Assumption of Risk
A plaintiff who willingly enters a dangerous situation and is injured, in many states, 
will be barred from recovery. For example, if a driver sees that the road ahead is 
flooded, he  probably will not be compensated for the injuries sustained when he loses 
control as he attempts to drive through the water. His recovery is barred even though 
the road was flooded owing to operator error in opening a floodgate. The requirements 
for use of the  assumption of risk defense are (1) knowledge of the risk and (2) volun-
tary assumption of the risk. Assumption of the risk and contributory negligence are 
distinguishable in that the former is based on consent whereas the latter is rooted in 
carelessness. Increasingly, states that have adopted the comparative negligence doc-
trine do not treat assumption of the risk as a complete bar to recovery, but rather as a 
factor in negligence balancing.

Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  307
Do Cheerleaders Assume the Risk of Injury?
Underlying the assumption of the risk doctrine is one of the central philosophical themes 
in this book: To what extent should the law/government shield us from life’s risks? Depart-
ing for a moment from product liability considerations, how should the law resolve dis-
putes arising from potentially hazardous recreational activities entered freely? Gabriella 
Ballou, then-9th grader and experienced cheerleader, allegedly improperly performed the 
“prep cradle twist” causing her head to miss the safety mat and strike the floor. An expert 
witness testified that the stunt was inadequately supervised, among other problems. Should 
Ballou be able to recover for injuries she sustained in high school cheerleading tryouts, or 
should she be deemed to have assumed the risks attendant to that activity?

Warranties
As explained previously, negligence claims often are difficult to prove. For that reason and 
others, a wronged consumer may wish to bring a breach of warranty claim in addition to or 
in place of a negligence action. A warranty is simply a contractually based guarantee. If the 
product does not conform to the standards of the warranty, the contract is violated 
(breached), and the wronged party is entitled to recovery. [For the text of the Uniform 
Commercial Code, Article II, Sales, see Appendix B at the back of this text. For the UCC, 
in total, see www.law.cornell.edu/ucc]
Express Warranties
An express warranty exists if a seller of goods states a fact or makes a promise regarding 
the character or quality of the goods. (Some lease arrangements are also covered by 
 warranty law, but we will limit our discussion to the sale of goods.) Warranties are gov-
erned primarily by the Uniform Commercial Code. The UCC is designed to codify and 
standardize the law of commercial practice.
 
UCC 2–313. Express Warranties by Affirmation, Promise, Description, Sample
 
1. Express warranties by the seller are created as follows:
 
a.  Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates 
to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express 
 warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.
 
b.  Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain 
 creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.
 
c.  Any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an 
 express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample or model.
 
The UCC 2–313 standard is straightforward: The seller who seeks to enhance the 
 attractiveness of her product by offering representations as to the nature or quality of the 

308  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
product must fulfill those representations or fall in breach of contract and pay damages. 
[At this writing, the various state legislatures are considering changes to the UCC.]
Puffing
Perhaps the area of greatest confusion in determining the existence and coverage of an 
express warranty is distinguishing a seller’s promise from a mere expression of opinion. 
The latter, often referred to as sales talk or puffing, does not create an express warranty. 
The UCC requires an affirmation of fact or promise. Hence, a statement of opinion is not 
covered by the code. For example, the sales clerk who says, “This is the best TV around,” 
would not be guaranteeing that the television in question is the best available. The sales-
person is expressing a view. We, as consumers, seem to be quite patient with sellers’ exag-
gerations. If, on the other hand, the clerk said, “This TV is rated at 1080 pixels,” when in 
fact it offered only 768 pixels, a breach of warranty action might ultimately be in order. 
The reasonable expectations test is to be applied in such situations. An expression of opin-
ion coming from an expert may well create an express warranty because the buyer should 
reasonably be able to rely on the expert’s affirmations. That would particularly be the case 
if the buyer is not knowledgeable about the product.
Implied Warranties
When a seller enters a contract for the sale of goods an implied warranty arises by opera-
tion of law. That is, an implied warranty automatically attaches to the sale of goods unless 
the warranty is disclaimed (disavowed) by the seller.
 
Two types of implied warranties are provided:
 
UCC 2–314. Implied Warranty: Merchantability; Usage of Trade
(1) Unless excluded or modified (Section 2–316), a warranty that the goods shall be mer-
chantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to 
goods of that kind. Under this section the serving for value of food or drink to be consumed 
either on the premises or elsewhere is a sale.
 
UCC 2–315. Implied Warranty: Fitness for Particular Purpose
Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for 
which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller’s skill or judgment to 
select or furnish suitable goods, there is unless excluded or modified under the next section 
an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.
 
The implied warranty of merchantability is a powerful tool for the wronged consumer. 
If the seller is a merchant regularly selling goods of the kind in question, the warranty of 
merchantability automatically accompanies the sale unless the warranty is excluded via a 
disclaimer (explained below). The warranty arises even if the seller made no certification 
as to the nature or quality of the goods. UCC 2–314 enshrines the consumer’s reasonable 
expectation that only safe goods of at least ordinary quality will appear on the market.
 
The implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose likewise arises by operation of 
law, but only when the seller (merchant or not) knows (or has reason to know) that the 
goods are to be used for a specific purpose, and the seller further knows that the buyer is 

Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  309
relying on the seller’s judgment. If those conditions obtain, the warranty exists automati-
cally unless disclaimed. For example, Chris Snapp engages an audio products clerk in a 
discussion regarding the proper sound system for Chris’s classic Austin Healey 3000 
sports car. Chris explains the joy he expects to receive in driving his car along the winding 
Kentucky roads with the convertible top down and his songs booming. Unfortunately, the 
audio system selected on the clerk’s advice proves insufficiently powerful to be heard 
clearly above the rushing wind. Should Chris recover for breach of the implied warranty of 
fitness for a particular purpose? Merchantability?
Disclaimers
Express warranties may be disclaimed (excluded) or modified only with great difficulty. In 
any contract displaying both an express warranty and language disclaiming that warranty 
(for example, sold “as is” or “with all faults”), the warranty will remain effective unless the 
warranty and the disclaimer can reasonably be read as consistent.
 
Implied warranties may be excluded or modified by following either of the two patterns 
explained in UCC sections 2–316(2) and (3)(a).
 
2.  Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchanta-
bility or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a 
writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of 
 fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous.
 
3. Notwithstanding subsection (2)
 
a.  unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by 
expressions like as is, with all faults, or other language which in common under-
standing calls the buyer’s attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain 
that there is no implied warranty.
 
Finally, when a buyer, before entering a contract, inspects the goods (or a sample 
thereof) or declines to inspect, no implied warranty exists with regard to defects that should 
have been apparent on inspection. See UCC 2–316(3)(b).
Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act
The federal Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act extended and clarified UCC warranty rules. 
Congress found that warranties were often vague, deceptive, or simply incomprehensible 
to the average purchaser. The act, administered by the FTC, applies only to consumer 
products and only to written warranties. It does not require offering an express written 
warranty, but where such a warranty is offered and the cost of the goods is more than $10, 
the warranty must be labeled full or limited. A full warranty requires free repair of any 
defect. If repair is not achieved within a reasonable time, the buyer may elect either a 
 refund or replacement without charge. If a limited warranty is offered, the limitation must 
be conspicuously displayed.
 
If a warranty is offered on goods costing more than $15, the warrantor must “fully and 
conspicuously disclose in simple and readily understandable language the terms and condi-
tions of the warranty.”
 
The effect of the Magnuson–Moss Act has not been entirely consistent with Congress’s 
hopes. In practice, many sellers have either offered limited warranties or eliminated them 
entirely.

310  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
 
In many states, implied warranty law has been incorporated within broader product 
 liability actions reflecting an emerging preference for treating personal injury and property 
damages as torts rather than contract-based (warranty) claims. The Hodges case that 
 follows, however, finds the Kansas Supreme Court examining a breach of warranty claim 
under conventional contracts reasoning. Notice that the Kansas court struggles, as other 
courts have, in determining when the warranty of merchantability should apply to used 
goods.
Hodges v. Johnson 
199 P.3d 1251 (Kansas S.Ct. 2009)
 
In May 2005, the air conditioner failed a third time. After 
checking the air conditioning system for leaks, Anderson  informed 
the Hodgeses that the Mercedes’ evaporator,  condenser, and 
compressor needed to be replaced. Anderson explained that 
these repairs would cost approximately $3,000 to $ 4,000.
 
At some time around May 2005, a mechanic who worked 
for Anderson told the Hodgeses that Johnson had requested 
that the mechanic put a product called Super Seal into the 
Mercedes’ air conditioner in May 2003 (when he was using the 
car as his personal vehicle). The mechanic explained that the 
use of Super Seal complicated the current repair of the air 
conditioner and that the mechanic personally would not 
 recommend Super Seal or apply it unless requested.
 
Johnson testified that he did not recall any problems with 
the Mercedes’ air conditioner after the mechanics added 
 Super Seal in May 2003, though he could not recall whether 
additional Freon was added during that time. Johnson further 
testified that the air conditioning problem in 2003 only involved 
the car’s evaporator.
 
Anderson identified the condenser as the main problem 
with the Mercedes’ air conditioner in 2005. Anderson testified 
during the pendency of this case that he could not determine 
whether the problem with the Mercedes’ air conditioner 
 existed at the time that the Hodgeses bought the car from 
Johnson or occurred at some time later.
 
The Hodgeses asked Johnson to pay to repair the air 
 conditioning unit in the Mercedes. Johnson refused.
 
Shortly thereafter, the Hodgeses filed an action in small 
claims court against Johnson, alleging he caused them 
 damages of $3,474—Anderson’s estimate of the repair costs. 
The small claims court found in favor of the Hodgeses and 
awarded them $3,474 damages, plus $56 in costs and interest.

FACTS
Jim Johnson owns a car dealership in Saline County that sells 
high-end, used vehicles. In January 2005, Johnson sold Dr. 
Merle Hodges and Melissa Hodges a 1995 Mercedes S320 
with 135,945 miles for $17,020 (the sales price of $ 15,900 plus 
tax). Johnson had been driving the Mercedes as his personal 
vehicle for roughly 2 years before the sale. Johnson testified 
before the district court in this case that he told the Hodgeses 
when they purchased the Mercedes that it was a nice car in 
good condition. Dr. Hodges testified that Johnson said the car 
“was just pretty much a perfect car” and that Johnson “loved 
driving it.”
 
At the time the Hodgeses bought the Mercedes from John-
son, there was no discussion about the operation of the air 
conditioning, heating, or other components of the vehicle. 
Both Dr. Hodges and Johnson testified that they had no reason 
to believe that the air conditioner did not work when the Mer-
cedes was sold to the Hodgeses.
 
In February 2005, about a month after he had bought the 
car from Johnson, Dr. Hodges noticed that the vent in the 
 Mercedes did not circulate cool air and that the car emitted a 
strange smell. In March of the same year, the Hodgeses 
 noticed that the Mercedes’ air conditioning did not work 
and contacted the Hodgeses’ mechanic, Virgil Anderson. 
 Anderson added Freon to the air conditioner. About a month 
later, the air conditioner again was not working; Anderson 
added more Freon. The Hodgeses contacted Johnson to notify 
him of the air conditioning problem, and Johnson told them 
that some older vehicles may need a yearly boost of Freon to 
work properly.

Johnson appealed to the district court. [T]he district 
court also found in favor of the Hodgeses, noting that “while 
[Johnson] may not have known of the failure of the air condi-
tioning unit[,] . . . there is an implied warranty of merchanta-
bility,” and Johnson “is responsible to the plaintiffs to 
provide a car that is merchantable.” The court therefore 
 entered a judgment in favor of the Hodgeses for $3,474, 
 together with costs of $56 plus interest. The court found that 
attorney fees were not warranted because Johnson’s 
 actions did not rise “to a level of misrepresentation.”
 
[Both parties appealed] to the Court of Appeals. . . . The 
Court of Appeals reversed . . . and held as a matter of law that 
the implied warranty of merchantability on a used vehicle 
 extends only to “the operation of major components that are 
necessary for the vehicle to operate, such as the engine and 
transmission.” The court further held that “it is the respon-
sibility of the buyer to ensure that the components incidental 
to operation are in working condition.”

This court granted the Hodgeses’ petition for review.
IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY
Kansas’ implied warranty of merchantability is contained in K.S.A. 
84-2-314, which states that “a warranty that the goods shall 
be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the 
seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.” K.S.A. 
84-2-314(1). The statute further states that in order for goods to 
be “merchantable,” they must be “at least such as . . . are fit 
for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used.” 
K.S.A. 84-2-314(2)(c).
* * * * *
ANALYSIS
The comments to K.S.A. 84-2-314 make clear that this implied 
warranty of merchantability applies by operation of law to “all 
sales by merchants” and “arises from the fact of the sale.” 
K.S.A. 84-2-314, Kansas Comment 1. Applying this standard to 
the facts before us, it is clear that the transaction in this 
case—the sale of the Mercedes by Johnson to the Hodgeses—
fits within the implied warranty. There is no dispute that John-
son is a merchant dealing in the sale of used vehicles or that the 
Mercedes is a “good” within the meaning of the statute. Thus, 
when Johnson sold the Mercedes to the Hodgeses, he implicitly 
warranted that the Mercedes would be “merchantable.”
* * * * *
 
The Court of Appeals majority recognized that the sale of 
the Mercedes triggered the implied warranty but concluded 
as a matter of law under K.S.A. 84-2-314(2) that the vehicle’s 
air conditioner was not covered by the warranty because the 
air conditioner did not affect the vehicle’s merchantability. To 
reach this conclusion, the majority employed a three-part 
 syllogism: First, for goods to be merchantable under the 
 statute, they must be “fit for the ordinary purposes for which 
such goods are used.” K.S.A. 84-2-314(2)(c). Second, the 
 majority concluded that the primary purpose for which used 
vehicles are used is transportation; thus only the major 
 components of a vehicle that bear upon its ability to effectively 
transport people from one location to another affect the 
 vehicle’s merchantability. Finally, the majority interpreted our 
past cases involving the warranty of merchantability in the 
sale of used vehicles to suggest that the warranty may not 
 apply “unless a major component or several components are 
defective, causing the vehicle to become virtually inoperable.” 
39 Kan. App. 2d at 225.
 
Applying this syllogism, the Court of Appeals majority de-
termined that the air conditioner was not a major component 
of the Mercedes and thus did not impair the primary purpose 
for which used cars vehicles are employed:
 
“An air conditioner is not a major component of a car 
that is 10 years old with over 135,000 miles on it, and does 
not fall within the implied warranty of merchantability. We 
find no  implied warranty of merchantability, considering the 
age of the car, the high mileage, and the fact that the 
Hodges provided no proof that the air conditioner did not 
work when they purchased the vehicle.” Hodges, 39 Kan. 
App. 2d at 225.
 
This conclusion is not supported by the case law. Although 
it may be that the implied warranty of merchantability does not 
extend to some components of a used vehicle in a particular 
transaction, this is a case-by-case determination in most 
cases—not a question of law. . . .
 
The Court of Appeals majority’s approach is similarly 
 unsupported by the statutes. K.S.A. 84-2-314(2)(c) defines 
 merchantable goods as goods that are “fit for the ordinary 
purposes for which such goods are used.” (Emphasis 
added.) The Court of Appeals interpreted this provision to 
mean that a used vehicle must be fit for the primary pur-
pose of transportation. This interpretation is inconsistent 
with the plain language of K.S.A. 84-2-314(2)(c), which 
clearly contemplates goods that may be put to more than 
one use. Although there can be little doubt that the primary 
purpose of a vehicle is transportation, the Court of Appeals’ 
opinion ignores the reality that a buyer may purchase a par-
ticular vehicle for a number of other  purposes—among 
which may be safety, fuel economy, utility, or comfort in 
traveling to and from various destinations.

312  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
 
Contrary to the Court of Appeals’ conclusion, the extent of 
a merchant’s obligation under the implied warranty of mer-
chantability depends on the circumstances of a transaction. . . . 
The determination as to whether the implied warranty has 
been breached turns on a number of factors, including “[t]he 
buyer’s knowledge that the goods are used, the extent of their 
prior use, and whether the goods are significantly dis-
counted.” 230 Kan. at 457.
 
The broad range of used goods that may be covered by the 
implied warranty of merchantability underscores the wisdom 
of this court’s previous recognition that a “late model, low 
mileage car, sold at a premium price, is expected to be in far 
better condition and to last longer than an old, high mileage, 
‘rough’ car that is sold for little above its scrap value.” Dale, 
234 Kan. at 844. In this case, we have a 1995 Mercedes S320 
with 135,945 miles selling for $17,020 in 2005. Johnson related to 
the buyer that it was a nice car in good condition; Dr. Hodges 
testified that he was told the car “was pretty much a perfect 
car.” In short, this vehicle falls somewhere between the 
 extremes of a “late model, low mileage car, sold at a premium 
price” and “an old, high mileage, ‘rough’ car . . . sold for little 
above its scrap value.” 234 Kan. at 844.
 
The question remaining to be resolved is not the existence of 
this warranty, but rather the extent of the seller’s obligation under 
the warranty. Because this case does not involve either extreme 
on the spectrum of used vehicles, the resolution of this question is 
not a question of law, but rather a factual determination. . . .
 
After hearing the evidence in this case, the district court 
 determined that the Hodgeses were entitled to judgment 
against Johnson for the sum of $3,474, together with costs of 
$56 and  interest, and thus affirmed the award of the small 
claims court.
 
To demonstrate a breach of the implied warranty of 
 merchantability, a plaintiff must show that the purchased goods 
were defective, that the defect was present when the goods 
left the seller’s control, and that the defect caused the injury 
sustained by the plaintiff. The circumstantial evidence in this 
case is sufficient to establish that the defect in the air condi-
tioner existed at the time of sale. In 2003, 2 years before the 
Hodgeses purchased the vehicle, the Mercedes’ air conditioner 
failed while Johnson was using it as his personal vehicle. 
 Johnson insisted that his mechanic, against the mechanic’s 
 advice, use a product called Super Seal to fix the problem. The 
Hodgeses discovered that the air conditioner was again defec-
tive as soon as the weather became warm enough to require 
climate control. The use of the Super Seal, the strong odor ema-
nating from the vehicle’s ventilation system immediately after the 
sale, and the complete breakdown of the air conditioner when 
the buyer first attempted to use it all tend to establish that it was 
defective at the time of sale. While Johnson may not have known 
that the Mercedes’ air conditioner was defective when he sold 
the vehicle to the Hodgeses, there is no requirement that a buyer 
establish that the seller knew of a defective component at the 
time of sale to trigger the implied warranty.
 
With regard to damages, there is no question that the com-
plete failure of the air conditioner’s operation led to the buyer 
replacing it. As this court has concluded:
. . . As concerns used or secondhand goods it is generally 
understood that the measure of damages is the cost of 
repair when repair is possible.” International Petroleum 
Services, 230 Kan. at 460.
* * * * *
 
We find that there is substantial competent evidence to 
support the district court’s conclusion that the implied 
 warranty of merchantability in this transaction was not  limited 
to only the Mercedes’ major components affecting transporta-
tion, but rather extended at a minimum to the  vehicle’s air con-
ditioning unit. We also find that there was substantial 
competent evidence to demonstrate that the air conditioning 
unit was defective at the time of sale and that the required re-
pairs would cost $3,474. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of 
Appeals’ reversal of the district court’s judgment in favor of 
the Hodgeses and affirm the district court’s  decision.

Strict Liability
Sometimes things happen that businesses can neither prevent nor even explain and yet 
 liability may attach. For example, imagine you are operating a clothing store. A customer 
enters and decides to try on a pair of slacks. You show her to the dressing room. Soon 
after, you hear a scream from the room. As it turns out, your cus-
tomer has been bitten by a spider. Not surprisingly, she thinks the 
blame lies with your store. She sues, but her negligence and breach 
of warranty claims are rejected by the court. (Can you explain why 
she loses?) Finally, she raises a strict liability in tort argument, but the court denies that 
claim also. Read the overview of strict liability that follows and think about why the court 
denied her claim. See Flippo v. Mode O’Day Frock Shops of Hollywood, 449 S.W.2d 692 
(Ark. S.Ct. 1970).
Strict Liability: Overview
Negligence and warranty claims are helpful to the harmed consumer. However, rapid 
changes in the nature of commercial practice, as well as an increasing societal concern for 
consumer protection, led the legal community to gradually embrace yet another cause of 
action. Strict liability in tort offers the prospect of holding all of those in the chain of

3. Priebe bought a used car without a warranty (sold as is). 
The seller, Autobarn, told Priebe that the car had not been 
in any accidents. After driving the car more than 30,000 
miles, Priebe crashed the car. Priebe sued Autobarn claim-
ing the car was dangerous to drive because of a previous, 
undisclosed accident. Priebe did not show that Autobarn 
had knowledge of the previous accident; nor did Priebe 
show that the value of the car was reduced by the previous 
accident. Priebe sued for breach of warranty. Decide. 
 Explain. See Priebe v. Autobarn, 240 F.3d 584 (7th Cir. 2001).
4. Douglas Kolarik alleged that he used several imported, 
 pimento-stuffed green olives in a salad. In eating the salad, 
he bit down on an olive pit and fractured a tooth. The olive 
jar label included the words “minced pimento stuffed.” The 
defendants are importers and wholesalers of Spanish 
 olives that reach the defendants in barrels and are then 
inspected for general appearance, pH and acid level and 
then washed and placed in glass jars suitable for distribu-
tion for the purpose of retail sales.
 
a.  What legal claim would be expected from the plaintiff 
based on the “minced pimento stuffed” language?
 
b.  Decide that claim. Explain. See Kolarik v. Cory Interna-

314  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
 distribution liable for damages from a defective product, rather than imposing the entire 
burden on the injured consumer. Manufacturers and sellers are best positioned to prevent 
the distribution of defective products, and they are best able to bear the cost of injury by 
spreading the loss via pricing policies and insurance coverage.
 
Strict liability as an independent tort emerged in 1963 in the famous California case of 
Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.25 In the ensuing 40 years, most states have 
adopted strict liability in concept. The essence of the strict liability notion is expressed in 
Section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. In brief, 402A imposes liability where 
a product is sold in a defective condition, unreasonably dangerous to the user. Here is the 
402A test:
1.  One who sells any product in a defective condition, unreasonably dangerous to the user or 
consumer or to his property, is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the 
ultimate user or consumer, or to his property, if
a.  the seller is engaged in the business of selling such a product, and,
b.  it is expected to and does reach the user or consumer without substantial change in the 
condition in which it is sold.
2. The rule stated in Subsection (1) applies although
a. the seller has exercised all possible care in the preparation and sale of his product, and
b.  the user or consumer has not bought the product from or entered into any contractual 
relation with the seller.
 
Thus, we see that strict liability does not require proof of negligence on the part of the 
defendant. Strict liability law focuses on the condition of the product, rather than the conduct 
of the parties. Therefore, a seller who is free of actual fault may, nonetheless, be liable for 
injuries caused by a defective and unreasonably dangerous product. The Aim N Flame lighter 
case that follows considers the conditions under which a strict liability claim may be raised.
Calles v. Scripto-Tokai, 
832 N.E.2d 409 (Ill. S.Ct. 2007)
result of the fire, Jillian suffered smoke inhalation. She was 
hospitalized and died on April 21.
 
Calles filed suit against Tokai, designer and manufacturer 
of the Aim N Flame, and Scripto-Tokai, distributor (collectively 
Scripto), alleging that the Aim N Flame was defectively de-
signed and unreasonably dangerous because it did not con-
tain a child-resistant safety device. According to the 
complaint, a safety device was available, inexpensive, and 
would have reduced the risk that children could ignite the 
lighter. Calles’ claims sounded in strict liability.
 
Thereafter, Scripto filed a motion for summary judgment. . . . In 
her deposition, Calles admitted she was aware of the risks and 
dangers presented by lighters in the hands of children, and, for 
Justice Burke
On March 31, 1998, plaintiff Susan Calles resided with her four 
daughters, Amanda, age 11, Victoria, age 5, and Jenna and Jil-
lian, age 3. At some point that night, Calles left her home with 
Victoria to get videos for Amanda. When she left, the twins 
were in bed and Amanda was watching television. Calles re-
turned to find fire trucks and emergency vehicles around her 
home. It was subsequently determined by a fire investigator, 
Robert Finn, that Jenna had started a fire using an Aim N 
Flame utility lighter Calles had purchased approximately one 
week earlier. The Aim N Flame was ignited by pulling a trigger 
after an “ON/OFF” switch was slid to the “on” position. As a

Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  315
this reason, she stored the Aim N Flames on the top shelf of her 
kitchen cabinet. Calles further admitted that the Aim N Flame op-
erated as intended and expected.
 
In opposition to Scripto’s motion for summary judgment, 
Calles offered affidavits from several experts. . . . All of [the] 
experts opined that the Aim N Flame was defective and un-
reasonably dangerous because it lacked a child-resistant 
design. They also opined that a technologically and 
 economically feasible alternative design, which included a 
child-resistant safety device, existed at the time the Aim N 
Flame was manufactured. Several of the experts averred 
that Scripto was aware of the desirability of a child-safety 
device because it knew children could operate the Aim N 
Flame. Further, according to these experts, Scripto owned 
the technology to make the Aim N Flame child resistant in 
1994 and 1995.
 
With respect to the cost of an alternative design, . . . the 
 Consumer Product Safety Commission, the regulatory body for 
lighters, estimated the increased cost of adding a safety  device 
to the lighter would be $ 0.40 per unit. However [one of Calles’ 
experts estimated],  the cost would have been negligible.
 
Calles also offered evidence of the dangerousness of light-
ers in the hands of children and Scripto’s awareness of such 
dangers. . . . Scripto admitted they had been named as defend-
ants in 25 lawsuits filed between 1996 and 2000 for injuries that 
occurred between 1992 and 1999 under circumstances similar 
to this case.
 
The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of 
Scripto. . . .
 
On appeal, the appellate court reversed [the trial court’s 
summary judgment in favor of Scripto. . . . ]
STRICT LIABILITY
This court adopted the strict liability doctrine set forth in 
 section 402A of the Second Restatement of Torts. Under this 
doctrine, strict liability is imposed upon a seller of “any prod-
uct in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the 
user or consumer or to his property.” The test outlined in 
 section 402A for determining whether a product is “unreason-
ably dangerous” is known as the consumer-expectation test. 
This test provides that a product is “unreasonably dangerous” 
when it is “dangerous to an extent beyond that which would 
be contemplated by the ordinary consumer who purchases it, 
with the ordinary knowledge common to the community as to 
its characteristics.”
* * * * *
 
An ordinary consumer would expect that a child could 
 obtain possession of the Aim N Flame and attempt to use it. 
Thus, a child is a reasonably foreseeable user. Likewise, an 
ordinary consumer would appreciate the consequences that 
would  naturally flow when a child obtains possession of a 
lighter.
 
Under the facts of this case, the Aim N Flame performed as 
an ordinary consumer would expect—it produced a flame 
when used in a reasonably foreseeable manner, i.e., by a child. 
This leads to the inescapable conclusion that the ordinary 
consumer’s expectations were fulfilled. . . . Thus, as a matter 
of law, no fact finder could conclude that the Aim N Flame was 
unreasonably dangerous under the consumer-expectation 
test. Therefore, Calles cannot prevail under this theory.
 
This does not end our analysis, however. Though the Aim N 
Flame satisfies the consumer-expectation test, it may, none-
theless, be deemed unreasonably dangerous under the risk–
utility test.
RISK–UTILITY TEST
Under the risk–utility test, a plaintiff may prevail in a strict lia-
bility design-defect case if he or she demonstrates that the 
magnitude of the danger outweighs the utility of the product, 
as designed.
* * * * *
 
Under the risk–utility test, a court may take into considera-
tion numerous factors. In past decisions, this court has held 
that a plaintiff may prove a design defect by presenting evi-
dence of “the availability and feasibility of alternate designs at 
the time of its manufacture, or that the design used did not 
conform with the design standards of the industry. . . .”
 
Calles presented specific and detailed evidence as to the 
likelihood of injury and the seriousness of injury from lighters 
which do not have child-safety devices.
 
Factors which would favor Scripto and a finding that the 
product is not unreasonably dangerous are the utility of the 
Aim N Flame and the user’s awareness of the dangers. As to 
the utility of the Aim N Flame, it is both useful and desirable to 
society as a whole—it serves as an inexpensive alternative 
source of fire. . . . With respect to the user’s awareness of the 
dangers, there is no question, based on Calles’ deposition tes-
timony, that it was obvious to her that the lighter could come 
into the hands of a child and the dangers and risks that situa-
tion would pose.
 
In connection with the remaining relevant factors, we find 
that these neither weigh for nor against a finding of unreason-
ably dangerous. Calles claims that a substitute product was 
available, but the only evidence she relies upon is the fact Bic 
introduced a child-resistant utility lighter in March 1998, the 
very same month of the incident here. This is insufficient to 

316  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
demonstrate that a substitute product was available at the 
time of the manufacture of the Aim N Flame.
 
Calles offered expert affidavits regarding the availability 
and feasibility of an alternative design, including product 
impairment and cost factors, along with industry standards. 
Each expert opined that a feasible alternative design 
 existed.
* * * * *
 
There is nothing in our record showing Scripto provided 
any amount as to the increase in cost of incorporating a 
safety device. Apparently . . . an internal Scripto memoran-
dum estimated the cost increase would be $0.03 per unit. In 
light of the foregoing, we conclude that the question of 
whether there was a feasible alternative design available 
cannot be determined on the basis of the record as it cur-
rently stands.
 
Lastly, with respect to the user’s ability to avoid the dan-
ger, Calles testified she put the Aim N Flames on the top shelf 
of her kitchen cabinet. However, she also acknowledged she 
could have left them on the counter.
* * * * *
 
Based on a review of the foregoing factors, reasonable per-
sons could differ on the weight to be given the relevant factors 
and thus could differ on whether the risks of the Aim N Flame 
outweigh its utility. Therefore, reasonable persons could differ 
as to whether the Aim N Flame is unreasonably dangerous, and 
we cannot say that Scripto was entitled to judgment as a matter 
of law. As such, we affirm the appellate court’s decision revers-
ing the trial court’s decision granting summary judgment in fa-
vor of Scripto on the strict liability claims.

Questions
1. a.  Explain the plaintiff Calles’ claim that the Aim N Flame 
lighter was defective and unreasonably dangerous.
 
b. Explain the court’s resolution of Calles’ claim.
2. What evidence must a plaintiff provide to maintain a 
 successful defective design product liability claim?
3. Is the manufacturer excused from liability if the product’s 
danger is obvious or if the product is used in an unintended 
but foreseeable fashion?
4. In a case similar to Calles [Griggs v. Bic Corp., 981 F.2d 1429 
(3rd Cir. 1992)] the court, employing a negligence analysis, 
found that the central question was whether the foreseeable 
risk was unreasonable. The court noted that residential fires 
started by children playing with lighters are estimated to 
take an average of 120 lives each year, and total damages 
amount to $300–$375 million or 60–75 cents per lighter sold.
 
a. Is the foreseeable risk unreasonable, in your judgment?
 
b. How did you reach your conclusion?
 
c.  In your view, are the parents the responsible parties in 
these episodes? Explain.
5. Alison Nowak, a 14-year-old girl, tried to spray her hair 
with Aqua Net. Because the spray valve on the recently 
purchased aerosol can would not work properly, she punc-
tured the can with an opener. She was standing in her 
kitchen near a gas stove at the time, and the cloud of spray 
that gushed from the can ignited. She was severely 
burned. Nowak sued Faberge, the maker of the spray, on 
strict liability grounds. Although the back of the can con-
tained the warnings, “Do not puncture,” and “Do not use 
near fire or flame,” the jury determined that Faberge had 
not adequately warned of the fire hazard and awarded her 
$1.5 million. Faberge appealed. Decide. Explain. See 
Nowak v. Faberge USA Inc., 32 F.3d 755 (3d Cir. 1994).
Strict Liability: Coverage
All of those engaged in the preparation and distribution of a defective product may be 
 liable for any harm caused by the defect, regardless of proof of actual fault. Further-
more, the courts have extended strict liability coverage to reach injured bystanders. 
Coverage generally extends to both personal injuries and property damage, but in 
some states the latter is excluded. Some states limit strict liability recovery to new 
goods, and some have limited liability to a designated period (for example, 15 years) 
after the manufacture or sale of the product.
 
Furthermore, the Restatement of the Law Third, Torts recommends applying strict liability 
claims to manufacturing defects but not to design and warning defect cases. Thus, in  effect, the 
316  Unit Two  Introduction to Law

Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  317
latest Restatement recommends applying the reasonableness, fault-based analysis  explained 
 earlier in the negligence material to all defective design and failure to warn cases. Of course, 
the courts may choose to stick with the current expansive use of the strict liability doctrine.
Strict Liability: Defenses
Assumption of risk and product misuse are both good defenses and, if factually supported, in 
many states can act as a complete bar to strict liability recovery. Assumption of the risk 
 involves the plaintiff’s decision to proceed to use the product despite obvious dangers associ-
ated with that use. Thus, if a pilot decided to fly knowing that the plane’s wing flaps were not 
operating properly, she may well have assumed the risk if she subsequently crashed. When 
the product is used improperly, or its directions are ignored, or it is used in an unforeseeable 
way, the defendant would raise the misuse defense. Suppose you find yourself late for class 
and you decide to save time by drying your tennis shoes in your microwave or ironing your 
clothes after you have put them on your body. If the microwave blows 
up or you burn yourself with the iron, not only have you had a very 
bad day, you probably would not be able to sue successfully for 
 damages because you likely would be found to have misused the 
products. Some courts, however, hold those in the chain of distribution liable for foreseeable 
misuses. Because strict liability is a no-fault theory, contributory negligence ordinarily is 
not a recognized defense. [For the “evolution” of product liability laws, see www

Video Games and The Basketball Diaries
Michael Carneal, a 14-year-old high school freshman in Paducah, Kentucky, brought a 
.22-caliber pistol and five shotguns to Heath High School on December 1, 1997, where he 
shot and killed three students and wounded a number of others. Carneal regularly played 
violent video games such as Doom and Quake, and viewed violent Internet sites. He also 
watched violent movies including The Basketball Diaries, in which a high school stu-
dent dreams of killing his teacher and other students. The parents of the dead children sued 
several video game, movie production, and Internet content providers raising negligence 
and strict liability claims. Who should win that case? Explain.

Part Three—Product Liability and Public Policy
Giant tort awards involving products such as asbestos and breast implants have bank-
rupted businesses. When we hear about a $28 billion punitive damage award in 2002 
for a 64-year-old smoker suffering from lung cancer, we may wonder if the justice 
system has lost its bearings.26 We may not understand that those giant awards are 

318  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
 almost always  dramatically reduced.27 Furthermore, awards in big class action cases 
often come in the form of product coupons or gifts to charity.28 The Wall Street  Journal 
reported, for example, that exploding tires on Ford Explorers resulted in a 2008 class 
action settlement for 1,647 eligible claimants of $500 toward the purchase of a new 
Explorer and $300 toward the purchase of any other Ford vehicle. Only 148 of the 
 eligible claimants redeemed a coupon, while the attorneys who led the litigation 
 received about $19 million in fees.29 Nonetheless, the threat of tort litigation signifi-
cantly affects business decision making and, in some instances, actually prevents 
products from reaching the market.
 
Because of those problems, many critics, particularly in the business community and 
among free market advocates, have argued for tort reform. They want to change the legal 
system in ways that would reduce the heavy costs of personal injury claims. The proposed 
reforms vary widely, but common prescriptions include: limiting class actions, reducing or 
eliminating punitive damages, curbing attorneys’ fees, penalizing frivolous lawsuits, and 
imposing “loser pays” rules requiring the losing party in a civil lawsuit to pay the other 
party’s legal fees and related costs.
 
Are big tort judgments harming the American economy and distorting justice, or are 
lawsuits Americans’ only effective protection against callous corporations? Consider some 
of the evidence.
For Tort Reform Consultants Towers Watson estimated that 2010 tort costs (not limited 
to product liability) for the United States totaled $264.6 billion: a sum amounting to a “tort 
tax” of $857 per year for every  American.30 As a result, critics say, American businesses 
must struggle with  rising costs, innovation is reduced, and new jobs are less plentiful. Crit-
ics are particularly frustrated that much of the tort money goes to lawyers rather than to the 
injured plaintiffs. Although U.S. tort costs increased by 5.1 percent 
in 2010, the Towers Watson report attributed that rise to the Deep-
water Horizon oil rig explosion and resulting oil spill in the Gulf of 
Mexico; not accounting for that event, tort costs actually decreased 
overall by 2.4 percent, extending the decrease seen in 2009. The Towers Watson report 
also noted that a weakened economy has offered less opportunity for tort actions, most 
notably in the commercial auto industry, despite the well-known products liability actions 
against Toyota discussed previously.31 A number of states have imposed caps on punitive 
damages while, as noted in Chapter 5, the U.S. Supreme Court has handed down several 
decisions curbing punitives. [For further criticism of tort claims and our legal system 
generally, see overlawyered.com or www.legalreform-now.org/. For a critique of the 
2009 Towers Watson (formerly Towers Perrin), see J. Robert Hunter and Joanne Doro-
show, “Towers Perrin: ‘Grade F’ for Fantastically Inflated ‘Tort Cost’  Report,” www
.consumerfed.org/elements/www.consumerfed.org/file/Insurance%
20Report%20Towers%20Perrin%202010(1).pdf]
Against Tort Reform Can we rely on the market and managerial ethics to protect us from 
dangerous products? Lawyers Mark Robinson and Kevin Calcagnie, writing in The Wall 
Street Journal, point to the long-running battle over Toyota’s sudden acceleration prob-
lems as evidence that the market alone does not adequately protect consumers from 
A “tort tax” of $857 per year 
for every American.

Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  319
 dangerous products.32 Robinson and Calcagnie argue that nearly a decade passed by before 
Toyota and the federal government began to aggressively examine the several thousand 
sudden acceleration claims.33 Improvements in products such as air bags, seat belts, tires, 
tobacco products, antidepressants, and many more have been encouraged by product 
 liability litigation, as Robinson and Calcagnie note.34
 
More broadly, those opposing tort reform say that the tort burden simply is not of the 
magnitude suggested by the critics. Lawsuits, consuming less than 2 percent of spend-
ing, constitute a modest part of the cost of doing business; product liability claims are a 
small fraction of the total legal landscape; and studies show that insurance costs do not 
decline appreciably when damages are capped.35 Furthermore, only about 3 percent of 
tort cases ever make it to trial; those cases that are settled before judgment often  involve 
reasonable sums of money36 and punitive damages are awarded in only about 3.3 per-
cent of tort cases won by plaintiffs.37 Even ardent defenders of tort practice often agree, 
however, that the system needs to be improved so that lawyers do not gobble up so 
much of the money themselves and so that the system produces a more consistent, pre-
dictable form of justice.38 [For a debate among prominent legal scholars about the value 
of product liability law, see A. Mitchell Polinsky and Steven Shavell, “The Uneasy 
Case for Product Liability,” 123 Harvard Law Review 1437 (2010); John C.P. Goldberg 
and Benjamin C. Zipursky, “The Easy Case for Products Liability Law: A Response to 
Professors Polinsky and Shavell,” 123 Harvard Law Review 1919 (2010); and A.

Kids Need to Swing?
Aggressive public safety programs and the threat of lawsuits have made playground 
swings, particularly the tall 16-footers, a vanishing delight. Tall swings and slides 
along with sliding poles are rapidly being replaced by safer but less thrilling playground 
devices. U.S. playground safety standards, widely adopted in the 1990s, called for new 
safety surfaces to cushion falls with the result that the swings became very costly. A 
swing set once costing $800 now costs $4,000. Thus, government rules and the threat of 
lawsuits have made playgrounds safer while reshaping childhood fun and virtually 
eliminating the challenge of overcoming the terror of big swings and slides. Are we 
better off?

Big Case: Lead Paint?
A helpful way to look at tort reform is to consider one of the massive claims that have 
emerged periodically as plaintiffs attempt to prove themselves wronged by a defective 
product or wrongful conduct. Tobacco smokers, Ford Explorer drivers, Vioxx users, and 
victims of gun violence are among those who have made headlines pursuing alleged 

320  Unit Two  Introduction to Law
 corporate wrongdoers. Lead paint, banned since 1978, often produces developmental 
 difficulties, including IQ deficiencies, learning disabilities, hyperactivity, and impaired 
hearing, when ingested or inhaled by children. Ordinarily, lead paint is troublesome only 
when it is reduced to flakes or dust; commonly in buildings that have not been properly 
maintained. While the potential for exposure to lead has declined dramatically in recent 
years, an estimated several hundred thousand young children, often living in old, inner city 
housing have been victims:
Crawling across the wooden floor of his mother’s Brooklyn (New York) apartment, Jaylin 
paused to lick his chubby hand, swallowing flecks of toxic paint. The boy’s mother had no 
idea the poison lurked within the cracks of the baseboard.39
 
Should paint manufacturers be responsible for the harm caused by paint applied  decades 
back by willing consumers before anyone fully understood the long-term hazards? What 
about owners and landlords who failed to properly maintain painted surfaces? Even if we 
can establish responsibility, how do we apportion damages when we cannot identify the 
specific producers of the paint in question? Or should we expect the paint manufacturers to 
share the damages burden according to the percentage each holds in the market (a product 
liability claim labeled market share liability)?
Lead paint lawsuits have been pursued in a number of states. In most cases, the plaintiffs 
have been states and municipalities that have sued paint manufacturers or landlords/property 
owners for creating a public nuisance (a significant interference with a right common to the 
general public such as the public health, public safety, or public peace). Market share liability 
claims have also been raised in some instances, but most claims  under both theories of recov-
ery have been rejected in court. For example, a unanimous Rhode Island Supreme Court in 
2008 overturned a jury verdict against three paint companies when the Court concluded that 
“however grave the problem of lead poisoning is in Rhode Island, public nuisance law  simply 
does not provide a remedy for this harm.”40 Lawsuits continue, however, and in 2009, a 
 Mississippi jury ruled that Sherwin-Williams paint  company was  liable for illnesses suffered 
by a young boy who had eaten paint chips. The jury awarded $7 million in damages, but 
Sherwin-Williams successfully appealed that verdict.41  However, in 
2014, the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed a trial court’s grant of 
summary judgment to Sherwin-Williams in another case brought by 
five adults who as minor children, attended a local Head Start 
 program to which Sherwin-Williams sold paint used on its playground equipment, causing 
injury to the plaintiffs.42

Fast Food = “Fat” Lawsuits?
Fortune magazine’s February 2003 issue asked “Is Fat the Next Tobacco?” Fortune and 
many other publications suggested that fast-food companies might soon be buried in 
lawsuits like those attacking the tobacco industry. Although the prospect of blaming 
McDonald’s, Wendy’s, and others for obese people’s health problems caused dismay, 
those lawsuits, for the most part, have not materialized. Most of the handful of cases 
filed have been unsuccessful, and those that did gain some traction were based in 

Chapter Seven  Business Torts and Product Liability  321
Too Much Law?
Perhaps we rely too much on the law. Clearly, legal intervention often is necessary to 
achieve justice. At the same time, that intervention sometimes can be inefficient and 
 unproductive. As we conclude this chapter, give some thought to the cases you have read. 
On balance, do you think legal intervention was necessary in those situations, or would our 
society be stronger if we resolved more of those problems through private arrangements 
such as arbitration, as we discussed in Chapter 4, or risk assignment provisions included in 
contracts when we buy a new product?
[For the American Tort Reform Association, see www.atra.org]
 mislabeling and consumer fraud. Furthermore, at least 24 states have passed “cheese-
burger bills”  providing some protection for fast-food companies facing obesity  lawsuits. 
However, in vetoing the Minnesota state legislature’s Personal Responsibility in Food 
Consumption Act, Minnesota governor Mark Dayton observed that although he 
 supported the bill’s intent, he believed the bill would create too broad an exemption 
from liability for food manufacturers and sellers.

 1. Cotillo, a power lifter with 10 years experience, attempted to lift 530 pounds during an 
American Powerlifting Association–sponsored meet, organized by Duncan, the faculty 
sponsor of the local high school’s weightlifting club and Taylor, the APA president. 
Lifters were allowed to use spotters of their own choice or those provided by the meet. 
Cotillo used those provided by the meet, who were high school students with weight-
lifting experience. As Cotillo attempted the lift, Duncan was positioned “in the mid-
dle,” and a student was on each side of the bar. Cotillo dropped the weight shattering

his jaw and causing other injuries. The spotters were in the proper positions to provide 
assistance, but they could not do so quickly enough to prevent injury. Cotillo then sued 
Duncan, the APA, and the APA Board, claiming, among other things, that the spotters 
were improperly trained. The spotters had received some instruction prior to the meet, 
but the record was unclear as to whether the training was improper or inadequate.
a. What was Cotillo’s cause of action?
b. Defend Duncan et al.
c. Decide the case. Explain. See American Powerlifting Association v. Cotillo, 934 
A.2d 27 (Ct. App. Md., 2007).
 2. Stopczynski, age 17, had used her neighbor’s pool “hundreds of times.” Stopczynski 
and her neighbor’s nephew, a 34-year-old male, went to the pool. Stopczynski was 
noticed floating face down in the pool. She had broken her neck, apparently from 
 diving into the four-foot deep, above-ground pool. She died a few hours later. The 
pool originally had stickers around the edge that said “no diving,” but that edge had 
been replaced and the stickers were gone. Stopczynski’s mother sued the property 
owner, Woodcox, for negligence. Decide the case. Explain. See Stopczynski v. Woodcox, 
258 Mich. App. 226 (2003).
 3. Soon after Granny’s Rocker Nite Club opened in the mid-1980s, it began having a 
weekly “fanny” contest, which involved male and female volunteer contestants com-
peting for cash prizes by dancing. The audience judged the contest. While attending 
the fanny contest on April 4, 1990, plaintiff Jeffrey Loomis got into a fight with an-
other patron. Loomis’s right ear was bitten and torn.
 
  
Loomis’s claim against Granny’s Rocker had two counts, one based on the Illinois 
Dramshop Act and one based on negligence. The jury found for the defendant on the 
dramshop count, but it found that Granny’s Rocker was negligent in failing to have 
adequate security to stop a physical altercation on the nights of the fanny contests 
when it knew or should have known that such contests would result in a large and 
rowdy group of patrons. Granny’s Rocker appealed. Decide the appeal. Explain, See 
Loomis v. Granny’s Rocker Nite Club, 620 N.E.2d 664 (Ill. App. 1993).
 4. Thomas Woeste died as a result of contracting a bacteria after eating about one dozen 
raw oysters at the Washington Platform Saloon & Restaurant. The bacteria, vibrio 
vulnificus, is naturally occurring in oysters harvested in warm waters. Most people are 
unaffected by the bacteria, but those with weakened immune systems like Woeste can 
be susceptible to illness or death. Washington Platform’s menu contained the follow-
ing warning:
There may be risks associated when consuming shell fish. . . . If you suffer from chronic 
illness of the liver, stomach or blood. . . or if you have other immune disorders, you 
should eat these products fully cooked.
 
  
Woeste ordered and ate the oysters without opening the menu and reading the 
 warning. A civil lawsuit was filed against Washington Platform alleging that the res-
taurant was both negligent and strictly liable for failure to adequately warn. Decide 
that case. Explain. See Woeste v. Washington Platform Saloon & Restaurant, 836 
N.E.2d 52 (Ohio Ct. App., First App. Dist. 2005).

 6. Sandage loaded a car on a transport trailer. The car door could not be fully opened 
because of a support bar on the trailer. He suffered a back injury when he squeezed out 
of the car. The trailer had been modified to add several feet to its length, and support 
poles, including the one in question, had been added. Sandage sued the company that 
modified the trailer. Sandage sued in strict liability and negligence. Decide the case. 
Explain. See Sandage v. Bankhead Enterprises, Inc., 177 F.3d 670 (8th Cir. 1999).
 7. In 1995, a young Oklahoma couple shot and paralyzed a store clerk, Patsy Byers. The 
young couple had repeatedly viewed Oliver Stone’s 1994 movie Natural Born Killers, 
which is about a young couple who go on a killing spree. The Byers family sued Stone 
and Warner Brothers movie studio, the film distributor. Should a filmmaker and 
 studio be liable for the alleged copycat behavior of those viewing a movie? Explain.
  8. A deputy sheriff drove his marked police cruiser through a Burger King drive-through 
in Vancouver, Washington. After ordering his hamburger, he decided to check his 
food. When he pulled into a nearby parking lot and lifted the bun, he found what 
looked like spit on the meat patty. DNA testing later confirmed that the substance was 
spit belonging to an employee at the Burger King. The deputy sheriff brought a prod-
uct liability and negligence lawsuit against Burger King and its franchisee, alleging 
that he suffered emotional distress as a result of the incident, including vomiting and 
sleeplessness. Should contaminated food be the basis for such a lawsuit? Decide. 
 Explain. See Bylsma v. Burger King (Wash. 293 P.3d 1168 2013). 
 9. Plaintiffs Dr. Arthur Weisz and David and Irene Schwartz bought two paintings at auc-
tions conducted by Parke-Bernet Galleries, Inc. The paintings were listed in the auc-
tion catalog as those of Raoul Dufy. It was later discovered that the paintings were 
forgeries. The plaintiffs took legal action to recover their losses. Parke-Bernet de-
fended itself by, among other arguments, asserting that the conditions of sale included 
a disclaimer providing that all properties were sold “as is.” The conditions of sale were 
15 numbered paragraphs embracing several pages in the auction catalog. The bulk of 
the auction catalog was devoted to descriptions of the works of art to be sold, includ-
ing artists’ names, dates of birth and death, and, in some instances, black-and-white 
reproductions of the paintings. It was established at trial that plaintiff Weisz had not 
previously entered bids at Parke-Bernet, and he had no awareness of the conditions of 
sale. Plaintiffs David and Irene Schwartz, however, were generally aware of the condi-
tions of sale. Is the Parke-Bernet disclaimer legally binding on the plaintiffs? Explain. 
See Weisz v. Parke-Bernet, 325 N.Y.S.2d 576 (Civ. Ct. N.Y.C. 1971), but see Schwartz 
v. Parke-Bernet, 351 N.Y.S.2d 911 (1974).

boosted the passenger aboard, but as they did so a package carried by the passenger 
fell beneath the wheels of the train and exploded. The package, unbeknownst to the 
employees, contained fireworks. The force of that explosion caused a scale many feet 
away to topple over, injuring the plaintiff, Palsgraf. Palsgraf sued the railroad on neg-
ligence grounds.
a. Defend the railroad.
b. Decide. Explain. See Palsgraf v. Long Island R.R., 162 N.E. 99 (N.Y. 1928).
 12. On September 8, 2009, Coomer went to the Kansas City Royals baseball game with 
his father. Instead of sitting in their ticketed seats, Coomer and his father sat in open 
seats six rows behind the third base dugout, to be closer to the game. Between the third 
and fourth innings, the Royals had a promotional event called the “Hotdog Launch,” 
which it had held at home games for several years. The Royals mascot launched 20 to 
30 hotdogs at the fans, either by throwing or fired through an air gun. The hotdogs shot 
out of the air gun were wrapped in bubble wrap and the ones thrown  by hand were 
typically wrapped in foil. As the mascot prepared to throw hotdogs from behind his 
back in Coomer’s direction, Coomer looked over at the scoreboard just before some-
thing hit him in the face. The impact caused a detached retina and other eye problems, 
leading to two surgeries. Coomer brought a personal injury lawsuit against the Kansas 
City Royals.
a. How might the baseball team defend itself? Explain.
b. Decide the case. Explain. See Coomer v. Kansas City Royals, 2013 Mo. App. 
LEXIS 46 (2013).
 13. Diane Elsroth was visiting her boyfriend, Michael Notarnicola, in the home of his 
 parents. Diane complained of a headache, and Michael provided a Tylenol that his 
mother had bought earlier that week. Michael noted nothing unusual about the Tylenol 
packaging. After consuming two Tylenol capsules, Diane went to bed. She died during 
the night. The medical examiner concluded that the Tylenol had been contaminated with 
potassium cyanide. The murder was not solved. The evidence established that the tam-
pering with the Tylenol occurred after the product left the manufacturer’s control. The 
packaging included a foil seal glued to the mouth of the container, a “shrink seal” around 
the neck and cap of the container, and a box with its ends glued shut. The manufacturer, 
McNeil, a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, knew through its research 
that a determined, sophisticated tamperer could breach the packaging and reseal it in a 
manner that would not be visible to the average consumer. John Elsroth sued McNeil on 
behalf of Diane’s estate. Was the Tylenol packaging defective in design? Explain. See 
Elsroth v. Johnson & Johnson, 700 F. Supp. 151 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).
 14. Jennifer Strange, a 28-year-old mother of three living in Sacramento, California,

urinating. The prize was a Nintendo Wii game console. She drank nearly 2 gallons in 
three hours. She commented on her pain to the disc jockeys (DJs); one DJ commented 
she looked like she was pregnant. Listeners called in to warn of the dangers of water

intoxication. The DJs replied, “We are aware of that,” and later said the contestants 
had signed a release so “we’re not responsible.” During the show, the DJs jokingly 
discussed the risks. “Maybe we should have researched this before,” one DJ added.43 
Apparently, these warnin gs were not shared with the contestants.44 Strange finished 
second in the contest, called in sick to work, and died a few hours later. The Strange 
family sued the radio station’s owners and its parent company for wrongful death.45 
Did the radio station cause Strange’s death? Explain.
 15. Joseph Birdsong and Bruce Waggoner both purchased iPods manufactured by Apple, 
Inc. Their iPods came equipped with detachable earbuds. Birdsong and Waggoner 
sued Apple for, among other claims, breach of implied warranty of merchantability, 
alleging the iPod is defective because of an unreasonable risk of hearing loss created 
by the supplied earbuds, which are designed to be placed in consumers’ ears. Birdsong 
and Waggoner did not allege they or other consumers had suffered hearing loss. Apple 
includes a warning with each iPod regarding the risk of permanent hearing loss. De-
cide. Explain. See Birdsong v. Apple, Inc. 590 F.3d 955 (9th Cir. 2009).
 16. On July 5, 2005, Dr. Smriti Nalwa took her nine-year-old son and six-year-old daughter 
to Great America amusement park in California where they went on the park’s Rue le 
Dodge bumper car ride. The ride consisted of small, two-seat, electrically powered ve-
hicles that moved around a flat surface. Each car was ringed with a rubber bumper and 
had a padded interior and seatbelts for both driver and passenger. The driver of each car 
controlled its steering and acceleration. Nalwa rode as a passenger in a bumper car her 
son drove, while her daughter drove a car by herself. The bumper car in which Nalwa 
was riding was bumped from the front and then from behind. Feeling a need to brace 
herself, the plaintiff put her hand on the car’s “dashboard.”  According to her son, 
“something like cracked” before his mother cried out; her wrist was fractured. The Rue 
le Dodge ride was inspected annually for safety by state safety regulators, and was in-
spected daily by the park’s maintenance and ride operations staff. On the morning of 
Nalwa’s injury, the ride was found to be working normally. Although other injuries had 
been reported in 2004 and 2005, Nalwa’s was the only fracture reported. Nalwa brought 
a personal injury lawsuit against the owner/operator of the park.
a. What defense might be raised in this case? Explain.
b. Should that defense be successful? Explain. See Nalwa v. Cedar Fair, 55 Cal. 4th 
1148.

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  331
Part One—An Introduction
Americans were shocked and searching for answers 
when Adam Lanza, 20, shot and killed 20 children, six 
Sandy Hook Elementary School staff members, his mother, 
and himself in Newtown, Connecticut on December 14, 
2012. One of the initial areas of concern was the video 
game industry. Lanza reportedly was “enthralled” by vio-
lent video games, including one called School Shooting, 
although the state’s official investigation of the shooting 
was unable to establish a motive for his behavior.1
 
Even though video games are subject to an industry-
wide rating system, a number of states have also legislated 
restrictions on minors’ access to violent video games. 
 California, for example, approved a 2005 law forbidding the 
sale or rental of violent video games to minors.2 The video 
game industry sued to block the law; that challenge 
reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 2011 where the Califor-
nia law was struck down as a violation of free speech 
rights.3 The Court ruled that the statute was a content-
based restraint on speech requiring California to establish 
a compelling reason for the law; a standard the state could 
not satisfy. Studies linking violent video games and harm to 
children have not established a clear causal relationship 
between the two. The majority further reasoned that video 
games are like books, plays and other forms of protected 
expression. Video games, they said, communicate ideas 
and even social messages. While the state has the power 
to protect children, that power does not extend to restrict-
ing the ideas children can receive. Some justices pointed 
specifically to the vagueness of the law that left uncer-
tainty about which games would have been restricted by 
the law.4
Video Game Addiction?
Notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s conclusion that 
 California was unable to show a sufficient link between 
 violent video games and damage to children, some of the 
evidence about video game use generally is disquieting. For 
example, a 2009 Iowa State University study found that 
 almost one in ten American children, ages 8 to 18 are 
 addicted to video games (the study was not limited to 
games) in much the way some people are addicted to 
drugs or gambling.5 And a 2013 Io wa State University study 
of 227 juvenile offenders in Pennsylvania found a strong 
association between violent video game use and juvenile 
violence and delinquency, even when controlling for a his-
tory of violence and for psychopathic traits among those 
studied.6 [For the Entertainment Software Rating Board, see

Questions
1.  In your judgment, are violent and sexually explicit vid-
eos harmful to children?
2. Ethics expert Chris MacDonald said that the video 
game industry should not be proud of selling “gory 
games” to kids. He has argued that video games are 
“fertile terrain for industry self-regulation. . . .” “Such 
a move toward social responsibility might go some 
distance toward proving that the video game industry 
is worthy of the constitutional protections it enjoys.” 
See Chris  McDonald, “In Praise of Self-
Regulation,” Canadian Business, July 14, 2011 [www.
canadianbusiness.com/].
 
a.  In your judgment, has the video game industry 
breached its social responsibility to American con-
sumers? Explain.
 
b.  Would an ethical, socially responsible video store 
owner decline to sell violent or sexually explicit vid-
eos if evidence revealed that those videos often 
reach children? Explain. 
3. a.  Will the free market and industry ethics satisfactorily 
protect society from any harm that may emerge from 
video game playing or is legal intervention necessary? 
Explain.
 
b.  Should the First Amendment protect video games 
from government oversight? Explain.
4. a.  Do we need to protect children from video games, 
whether violent or not? Explain.
 
b.  If so, would government intervention be the most 
 effective way of offering that protection? Explain.

5. Daniel Akst asks, “Part of the fun of video games is the 
chance to inhabit an exciting fictional world. So do 
people who play these games feel free to behave im-
morally toward the characters on screen?”  Answer 
Akst’s question. See Daniel Akst, “In Playing Video 
Games, Morality Rules,” The Wall Street Journal, 
 October 9, 2012 [http://blogs.wsj.com/].
How Much Government?
In this chapter and all those that follow our central question will be: How much govern-
ment do we need? In the first three chapters we looked at the role of the free market and 
ethics as “regulators” of business behavior. In Chapters 4 through 7 we introduced the 
foundations of the American legal system. Now we turn to the role the law plays in sup-
plementing the market and ethics/self-regulation. The alleged link between video game use 
and social problems, including violence, is one relatively small example of an enormous 
array of disputes about the optimal balance between unconstrained business practice and 
government intervention in the market. America’s ongoing financial struggles, health care 
reform, the near-death of giants such as General Motors, the Gulf Oil spill, accommodat-
ing immigration, climate change—these are several of the most visible areas of public 
policy concern. Do we need more rules to address these problems or does the market in 
combination with corporate ethics/social responsibility provide the most efficient, effec-
tive  response? How do we decide when a new rule is needed?
Why Regulation?
Market Failure
In theory, government intervention in a free enterprise economy would be justified only 
when the market is unable to serve the public interest—that is, in instances of market fail-
ure. Market failure is attributed to certain inherent imperfections in the market itself.
Imperfect Information
Can the consumer choose the best pain reliever in the absence of complete information 
about the characteristics of the competing products? An efficient free market presumes rea-
soned decisions about production and consumption. Reasoned decisions require adequate 
information. Because we cannot have perfect information and often will not have adequate 
information, the government, it is argued, may impose regulations either to  improve the 
available information or to diminish the unfavorable effect of inadequate  information. 
Hence, we have, for example, labeling mandates for consumer goods,  licensure require-
ments for many occupations, and health standards for the processing and sale of goods.
 
The 2001 Nobel Prize for economics was awarded to three Americans whose research in-
dicates that markets cannot behave as theorized—that is, rationally and efficiently—in part 
because buyers and sellers often do not have the information they need to make the best 
decisions. Put another way, their research demonstrates that we often face situations of 
 asymmetric information where some parties to a transaction simply know more than the other 

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  333
 parties to that transaction, with the result that optimal efficiency cannot be achieved. Further-
more, recent research in behavioral economics suggests that we often pursue social goals and 
act in other altruistic ways that are contrary to our direct, personal economic  interests. More 
alarmingly, a new line of research suggests that decision making among male financial traders 
is significantly influenced by testosterone levels, thus supporting the revisionist view that fi-
nancial decisions may prove to be less a product of rational calculus than we have long be-
lieved.7 Thus, while our free market system assumes rational decision making, we might 
more  accurately recognize that we operate with limited or bounded rationality. Hence, 
government intervention might be appropriate.
Monopoly
Of course, the government intervenes to thwart anticompetitive behaviors throughout the mar-
ketplace. (That process is addressed in Chapters 10 and 11.) Historically, the primary concern 
in this area was how to deal with the so-called natural monopoly where a single large firm, such 
as a utility, was more efficient (a natural monopoly) than several small ones. Today, attention 
in the monopoly area is largely directed to anticompetitive conduct such as price fixing and 
abuse of market dominance that results in a reduction of open,  efficient competition.
Externalities
When all the costs and benefits of a good or service are not fully internalized or absorbed 
by producers or consumers, those costs or benefits fall elsewhere as what economists have 
labeled externalities, neighborhood effects, or spillovers. Pollution is a characteristic exam-
ple of a negative externality. The environment is used without charge as an ingredient in the 
production process (commonly as a receptacle for waste). Consequently, the product is un-
derpriced. The producer and consumer do not pay the full social cost of the product, so 
those remaining costs are thrust on parties external to the transaction. Government regula-
tion is sometimes considered necessary to place the full cost on those who generated it, 
which in turn is expected to result in less wasteful use of resources. Positive externalities 
are those in which a decision maker does not receive the full benefit of a decision because 
a portion of those benefits “spill over” on to third parties (often society at large) who were 
not direct participants in the decision. An example of such a positive externality is a busi-
ness firm that landscapes its grounds and develops a sculpture garden that benefits the firm 
but also benefits the neighborhood. Positive externalities ordinarily are not the subject of 
regulation. [See the work of Nobel Prize-winning economist Ronald Coase for the view 
that, under certain conditions, solutions for negative externalities and other market failures 
could be more efficiently and effectively resolved through private negotiations than 
through government intervention.]
Public Goods
Some goods and services cannot be provided through the pricing system because we have 
no method for excluding those who choose not to pay. For such public goods, the added 
cost of benefiting one person is zero or nearly so, and, in any case, no one can effectively 
be denied the benefits of the activity. National defense, insect eradication, street lighting, 
and pollution control are examples of this phenomenon. Presumably most individuals 
would refuse to voluntarily pay for what others would receive free. Thus, in the absence of 
government regulations, public goods would not be produced in adequate quantities.

334  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
Regulatory Life Cycle?
These market failures and other forces, to be explained later, sometimes lead to government 
intervention such as the Clean Air Act (see Chapter 17) or the Occupational Safety and 
Health Act (see Chapter 12). Looking at the historical record, law school dean Joseph  Tomain 
argued that a rather predictable pattern or life cycle typically emerges when the  government 
decides to regulate an industry. Stage One in Tomain’s life cycle is the free market itself, the 
period when government regulation is absent from the market in question. In Stage Two, a 
market failure is identified, suggesting the need for government intervention. In Stage Three, 
government regulation is imposed in the form of a rule (such as a  minimum drinking age). In 
Stage Four, regulatory failure occurs because, in brief, we believe the benefits of the rule in 
question no longer exceed its costs. In Stage Five, the government may respond with regula-
tory reform to correct the failure, or it may move to Stage Six, where the regulation in 
 question is simply eliminated. The market, thus fully deregulated, has returned to Stage One 
(the free market) and the regulatory life cycle is complete.8
 
Wall Street’s financial collapse and our ongoing recession seem to support Tomain’s 
regulatory cycle hypothesis. Ben Bernanke, former Federal Reserve chair, attributed our 
recent housing bubble and the subsequent financial collapse to regulatory failure.9 Rather 
than deregulation as a solution, however, Bernanke called for (and, generally, received) 
greater financial oversight authority for the Federal Reserve; that is, he called for greater 
supervision by the government as the best way to prevent a future financial calamity. Of 
course, Bernanke’s many critics believe excessive government intervention was the root 
cause of the housing collapse and that reduced, rather than increased, regulation is the 
 better remediation. [To read about and submit comments on proposed rules affecting small 
businesses, see www.sba.gov/advo/laws/law_regalerts.html]
Steroids
The steroid scandal in baseball allegedly involving Roger Clemens, Barry Bonds, Jason Giambi, 
and other major league stars led the The Des Moines Register to argue for the value of regulation:
Businesses forever complain about being regulated, but the truth is that reasonable reg-
ulation is good for business. It’s easier to sell insurance to people who know regulators 
are helping keep the insurance companies solvent. It’s easier to sell stocks to investors 
who think the SEC is on the job and easier to sell food to shoppers who trust the labels 
the FDA requires. Name an industry, and a case can be made that regulation helps it.
 
Unfortunately, the barons of baseball never figured that out. The owners and 
players in big-league baseball resisted any regulation of performance-enhancing 
chemicals in their business.
* * * * *
Baseball had slipped in the affections of many Americans even before the scandal. 
Now, it’s doubtful the sport can ever reclaim its good name.
Question
In your view, should the government regulate performance-enhancing drug use in sports, or 
will self-regulation by the sports be sufficient?

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  335
Philosophy and Politics
Correction of market failure arguably explains the full range of government regulation of 
business, but an alternative or perhaps supplemental explanation lies in the political pro-
cess. Three general arguments have emerged.
1. One view is that regulation is necessary for the protection and general welfare of the 
public. We find the government engaging in regulatory efforts designed to achieve a 
more equitable distribution of income and wealth (such as Social Security and the min-
imum wage). Many believe government intervention in the market is necessary to stabi-
lize the economy, thus curbing the problems of recession, inflation, and unemployment. 
Affirmative action programs seek to compensate for racism and sexism. We even find 
the government protecting us from ourselves, both for our benefit and for the well-being 
of the larger society (consider seat belt requirements).
2. Another view is that regulation is developed at the request of industry and is operated 
 primarily for the benefit of industry. Here the various subsidies and tax advantages 
 afforded to business might be cited. In numerous instances, government regulation has 
been effective in reducing or entirely eliminating the entry of competitors. Government 
regulation has also permitted legalized price-fixing in some industries. Of course, it 
may be that regulation is often initiated primarily for the public welfare, but industry 
eventually “captures” the regulatory process and ensures its continuation for the benefit 
of the industry. On the other hand, some corporations seek government standards so 
they can do what is best for society without being undercut by their less socially respon-
sible competitors.
3. Finally, bureaucrats who perform government regulation are themselves a powerful 
force in maintaining and expanding that regulation.
Bring Back Danger?
We often count on government rules to shelter us from dangers with which the market 
seems  ill-suited to deal. Hence, we created the federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
to protect us from dangerous food, drugs, and medical devices (see Chapter 15). But some-
times rules do harm. Indeed, safety may not always be in our best interest. Some critics 
 argue that boys, in particular, need a certain amount of danger in their lives. Brothers Conn 
and Hal Iggulden wrote The Dangerous Book for Boys as a manual of activities for boys. 
Their book describes how to make a bow and arrow, hunt and cook a rabbit, build a tree 
house, set a trip wire, and so on. They believe our “safety culture” has gone a bit too far. 
They point to that bygone era when every boy had a jackknife. They believe that taking 
risks is important to a boy’s joy and maturation.
Questions
1. Do you agree with the Iggulden brothers that we should allow boys to experience a 
 certain amount of danger in their lives?
2. How about girls? [See Andrea Buchanan and Miriam Peskowitz, The Daring Book for 
Girls. For an online discussion about giving children greater freedom, see http://

336  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
The Constitutional Foundation of Business Regulation
The Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution broadly specifies the power accorded 
to the federal government to regulate business activity. Article I, Section 8 of the 
 Constitution provides that: “The Congress shall have the power . . . to regulate 
 Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian 
Tribes.” State authority to regulate commerce resides in the police power specified by 
the Constitution. Police power refers to the right of the state governments to promote 
the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare by regulating persons and prop-
erty within each state’s jurisdiction. The states have, in turn, delegated portions of the 
police power to local government units.
Commerce Clause Examined
The Commerce Clause, as interpreted by the judiciary, affords Congress exclusive juris-
diction over foreign commerce. States and localities, nevertheless, sometimes seek in vari-
ous ways to regulate foreign commerce. For example, a state may seek, directly or 
indirectly, to impose a tax on foreign goods that compete with those locally grown or 
manufactured. Such efforts are unconstitutional violations of the Commerce Clause and 
thus are unenforceable.
 
Federal authority over “commerce among the several states,” that is, interstate com-
merce, affords the federal government very broad power to regulate commercial activities 
across the United States and was designed to create an open, effectively borderless market 
throughout the nation, wherein goods would move freely among the states, unimpeded by 
state and local tariffs and duties. The Constitution does not, however, expressly forbid 
state regulation of interstate commerce. As with foreign commerce, the states and localities 
pass laws to influence interstate commerce, often to favor local economic interests. The 
judiciary has aggressively curbed those efforts, and in the process, the reach of the federal 
government has been dramatically expanded. Even purely intrastate activities can be regu-
lated by the federal government if they have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. In 
the 1942 case Wickard v. Filburn,10 the U.S. Supreme Court, in interpreting a federal 
 statute regulating the production and sale of wheat, found that one farmer’s production of 
23 acres of homegrown and largely home-consumed wheat, in combination with other 
similarly situated farmers growing and consuming wheat locally, could substantially affect 
the interstate wheat market by reducing demand for that wheat among those such as 
 Wickard, who grew it locally. Thus, a local product could be subject to federal regulation. 
In 2005, the Supreme Court affirmed the Wickard reasoning in an interesting California 
case, Gonzalez v.  Raich,11 involving the federal government’s constitutional authority to 
regulate the use of medical marijuana.
 
In 1996, California decriminalized the doctor-approved medical use of marijuana. 
The federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA), on the other hand, forbids the use, cultiva-
tion, or possession of marijuana for any purpose. A Californian, 
 Angel Raich, who, under a doctor’s prescription, used marijuana 
for pain control, challenged the application of the CSA against 
 California medical marijuana users. The heart of her claim was 
Angel Raich used marijuana 
for pain control.

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  337
that the  Commerce Clause does not give the federal government the authority to regulate 
the  noncommercial cultivation and personal, medical use of marijuana that does not 
cross state lines. She won at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, but the U.S. 
Supreme Court, by a 6–3 vote, ruled against Raich. Addressing the central question, the 
Court reasoned that the wholly intrastate use of marijuana had a substantial effect on 
 interstate commerce in marijuana and thus was subject to federal regulation, as the Court 
had ruled decades earlier in Wickard. Personal consumption of marijuana, even for med-
ical purposes, has the potential to displace demand for marijuana in the illegal interstate 
market, thus substantially affecting interstate commerce. 
 
Nearly half of the states have reduced their restraints on marijuana use, and in two 
states, Washington and Colorado, voters have “legalized” adult, recreational consump-
tion of the drug. The result is a conflicting patchwork of laws and enforcement practices 
that includes a recent federal government decision to shut down hundreds of California 
medical  marijuana dispensaries believed not to be restricting their operations to lawful 
medical marijuana sales. At this writing, the federal Justice Department has announced 
that it will not sue to challenge the Colorado and Washington marijuana laws, but it still 
expects the states to impose careful regulations restricting sales to minors, among other 
considerations.
Too Much Federal Power?
Dissenting in Raich, Supreme Court Justice Thomas warned:
If Congress can regulate this under the Commerce Clause, then it can regulate virtually 
 anything—and the federal government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers.12
Perhaps seeking to demonstrate that the Constitution does not accord unlimited power to 
the federal government, the Supreme Court in recent years has issued two particularly 
noteworthy Commerce Clause decisions. In the 1995 United States v. Lopez case,13 the 
Supreme Court clearly spoke for states’ rights. In 1990 the federal government approved 
the Gun-Free School Zones Act, which forbade “any individual knowingly to possess a 
firearm at a place that [he] knows . . . is a school zone.”14 Congress claimed that gun pos-
session in school zones would increase  violence, retard learning, and  discourage travel, 
thus affecting commerce. Lopez, a  12th-grade San Antonio, Texas, 
student carried an unloaded,  concealed gun into his high school and 
was charged with violating the act. His case reached the Supreme 
Court, where he claimed and the Court agreed that  Congress did 
not have the constitutional authority to regulate the matter. By a 
5–4 vote, the Court held that the possession of a gun at a school is 
not an economic activity that could, even if repeated elsewhere, have a substantial effect 
on interstate commerce.
 
Strengthening its Lopez reasoning, the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2000 Brzonkala 
case15 ruled by a 5–4 vote that Congress exceeded its Commerce Clause authority in 
 approving some portions of the federal Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). The law 
allowed women who had been victims of gender-based violence to sue in federal court 
even though the crimes did not directly involve more than one state. In debating VAWA, 
A 12th-grade San Antonio, 
Texas, student carried an 
 unloaded, concealed gun into 
his high school.

338  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
Congress held hearings and developed a record on the aggregate economic impact of 
 violence against women, including driving up medical costs and discouraging women 
from traveling and from holding jobs, but the Supreme Court said Congress did not have 
the power to regulate noneconomic violent crime because it does not have a substantial 
effect on interstate commerce. To rule otherwise, the Court said, might “obliterate” the 
constitutional distinction between federal and state/local authority.
The case involved a woman, Brzonkala, who claimed she was raped by two football 
players, Morrison and Crawford, when all three were students at Virginia Polytechnic 
Institute:
Brzonkala alleges that soon after she met Morrison and Crawford, the two defendants 
pinned her down on a bed in her dormitory and forcibly raped her. Afterward, Morrison 
told Brzonkala, “You better not have any f* *ing diseases.” And, subsequently, Morrison 
 announced publicly in the dormitory’s dining hall, “I like to get girls drunk and f* * * the 
s* * * out of them.”16
After Brzonkala complained to the university, Morrison was found 
guilty of abusive conduct by the VPI judicial committee and was 
suspended for one year, but that punishment was subsequently 
lifted. Brzonkala then sued for civil damages in federal court  under 
the VAWA. As explained above, Brzonkala eventually lost, however, when the  Supreme 
Court invalidated the portions of the VAWA that she was relying on by ruling that the 
acts of violence the VAWA was aimed at did not have a substantial effect on interstate 
commerce. [For the federal Violence Against Women Office and for discussion of the 
2013 congressional reauthorization and strengthening of VAWA, see www.ovw.usdoj
.gov/]
Obamacare
In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court, by a 5–4 vote, upheld the constitutionality of the 
Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), but the decision raised further doubts about the fed-
eral government’s Commerce Clause power.17 The core of the Supreme Court review 
involved what is called the “individual mandate:” a requirement in the bill forcing most 
Americans to maintain “minimum essential” health insurance. The mandate was chal-
lenged on the grounds that it violated the Commerce Clause by attemp ting to regulate 
in activity (commanding action from those who are not buying health insurance) rather 
than regulating already existing interstate activity. The Court, by a 5–4 margin, ruled 
that the individual mandate was, indeed, a violation of the Commerce Clause. The 
Court reasoned that construing the Commerce Clause to allow Congress to regulate in-
activity would open up potentially expansive new territory to congressional interven-
tion. Nonetheless, the case turned out to be a victory for Obamacare. The Court, once 
again by a 5–4 margin, ultimately upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate 
on the grounds that it constituted a tax on those who do not have health insurance.  In as 
much as Congress clearly has the constitutional authority to “lay and collect Taxes” 
(Article I, Section 8, Clause 1—See the Constitution in Appendix A at the back of this 
text), the Court ruled that Obamacare’s individual mandate is constitutionally 
 permissible.
Brzonkala claimed she was 
raped by two football players.

 highway signs within the state, soliciting patronage for the 
motel; it accepts convention trade from outside Georgia, and 
approximately 75 percent of its registered guests are from out 
of state. Prior to passage of the act the motel had followed a 
practice of refusing to rent rooms to Negroes, and it alleged 
that it intended to continue to do so. In an effort to perpetuate 
that policy this suit was filed.
 
The appellant contends that Congress in passing this act 
exceeded its power to regulate commerce under [Article I] of 
the Constitution of the United States. . . .
 
The appellees counter that the unavailability to Negroes of 
adequate accommodations interferes significantly with interstate

Our Guns: Feds Must Stay Out?
Gary Marbut of Missoula, Montana, hopes to manufacture .22-caliber rifles he calls 
Montana Buckaroos. He wants to produce and sell the guns exclusively in Montana 
from materials originating in Montana.” He has also drafted and promoted the  Montana 
Firearms Freedom Act, which has been adopted in Montana and which provides, gen-
erally, that Montana guns cannot be subject to federal regulation if made and sold only 
on an intrastate basis. Other states have approved similar legislation. Marbut (and oth-
ers) recently brought suit seeking a court order affirming the right in Montana to man-
ufacture and sell guns free of federal regulation. Marbut lost at the federal district court 
and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, but he hopes to reach the Supreme Court to 
challenge Wickard v. Filburn and federal regulatory authority.

The classic decision that follows illustrates the importance of Commerce Clause reason-
ing. In this case Congress used its economic authority under the Commerce Clause to open 
public accommodations (hotels, restaurants, and the like) to all persons, thus reshaping 
American social and racial practices.
Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  339

court sustained the constitutionality of the sections of the act 
under attack and issued a permanent injunction. . . . It 
 restrained the appellant from “[r]efusing to accept Negroes as 
guests in the motel by reason of their race or color” and from 
“[m]aking any distinction whatever upon the basis of race or 
color in the availability of the goods, services, facilities, privi-
leges, advantages, or accommodations offered or made avail-
able to the guests of the motel, or to the general public, within 
or upon any of the premises of the Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.”
2. THE HISTORY OF THE ACT
. . . The act as finally adopted was most comprehensive, 
 undertaking to prevent through peaceful and voluntary set-
tlement discrimination in voting, as well as in places of 
 accommodation and public facilities, federally secured 
programs, and in employment. Since Title II is the only portion 
under attack here, we confine our consideration to those 
public accommodation provisions.
3. TITLE II OF THE ACT
This Title is divided into seven sections beginning with Sec-
tion 201(a), which provides,
All persons shall be entitled to the full and equal enjoyment 
of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and 
accommodations of any place of public accommodation, as 
defined in this section, without discrimination or 
segregation on the ground of race, color, religion, or 
national origin.
4. APPLICATION OF TITLE II TO HEART 
OF ATLANTA MOTEL
It is admitted that the operation of the motel brings it within the 
provisions of Section 201(a) of the act and that appellant re-
fused to provide lodging for transient Negroes because of 
their race or color and that it intends to continue that policy 
unless restrained.
 
The sole question posed is, therefore, the constitutionality 
of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as applied to these facts. . . .
 
[Part 5 omitted.]
6. THE BASIS OF CONGRESSIONAL ACTION
While the act as adopted carried no congressional findings, 
the record of its passage through each house is replete with 
evidence of the burdens that discrimination by race or color 
places upon interstate commerce. . . . This testimony  included 
the fact that our people have become increasingly mobile with 
millions of people of all races traveling from state to state; that 
Negroes in particular have been the  subject of discrimination 
in transient accommodations, having to travel great distances 
to secure the same; that often they have been unable to obtain 
accommodations and have had to call upon friends to put 
them up overnight; and that these conditions have become so 
acute as to require the listing of available lodging for Negroes 
in a special guidebook which was itself “dramatic testimony to 
the difficulties” Negroes encounter in travel. These exclusion-
ary practices were found to be nationwide, the Under Secre-
tary of Commerce testifying that there is “no question that this 
discrimination in the North still exists to a large degree” and in 
the West and Midwest as well. This testimony indicated a 
qualitative as well as quantitative effect on interstate travel by 
Negroes. The former was the obvious impairment of the Negro 
traveler’s pleasure and convenience that resulted when he 
continually was uncertain of finding lodging. As for the latter, 
there was evidence that this uncertainty stemming from racial 
discrimination had the effect of discouraging travel on the part 
of a substantial portion of the Negro community. This was the 
conclusion not only of the Under Secretary of Commerce but 
also of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Agency, who 
wrote the Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee that it 
was his “belief that air commerce is adversely affected by the 
denial to a substantial segment of the traveling public of ade-
quate and desegregated public accommodations.” We shall 
not burden this opinion with further details since the volumi-
nous testimony presents overwhelming  evidence that discrim-
ination by  hotels and motels impedes interstate travel.
7. THE POWER OF CONGRESS OVER 
INTERSTATE TRAVEL
The power of Congress to deal with these obstructions de-
pends on the meaning of the Commerce Clause.
* * * * *
 
In short, the determinative test of the exercise of power by the 
Congress under the Commerce Clause is simply whether the ac-
tivity sought to be regulated is “commerce which concerns more 
States than one” and has a real and substantial relation to the 
national interest. Let us now turn to this facet of the problem.
* * * * *
 
The same interest in protecting interstate commerce 
which led Congress to deal with segregation in interstate car-
riers and the white-slave traffic has prompted it to extend the 
exercise of its power to gambling, to criminal enterprises, to 
deceptive practices in the sale of products, to fraudulent se-
curity transactions, and to racial discrimination by owners and 
managers of terminal restaurants. . . .
 
That Congress was legislating against moral wrongs in 
many of these areas rendered its enactments no less valid. In 
framing Title II of this act Congress was also dealing with what 
it considered a moral problem. But that fact does not detract 
from the overwhelming evidence of the disruptive effect the 
racial discrimination has had on commercial intercourse. It

Supremacy Clause
Sometimes state or local law conflicts with federal law. As we discussed in Chapter 5, 
such situations are resolved by the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution (Article VI, 
paragraph 2), which provides that: “This Constitution and the Laws of the United States 
. . . shall be the Supreme Law of the Land.” As explained in Chapter 5, ours is a federal-
ist form of government wherein we divide authority among federal, state, and local units 
of government. Conflicts are inevitable, but each level of government brings strengths to 
the process. State rules benefit from being enacted by bodies very close to the people 
Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  341
was this burden which empowered Congress to enact appro-
priate legislation, and, given this basis for the exercise of its 
power, Congress was not restricted by the fact that the par-
ticular obstruction to interstate commerce with which it was 
dealing was also deemed a moral and social wrong.
 
It is said that the operation of the motel here is of a purely 
local character. But, assuming this to be true, “[i]f it is interstate 
commerce that feels the pinch, it does not matter how local 
the operation which applies the squeeze.”
* * * * *
 
Thus the power of Congress to promote interstate com-
merce also includes the power to regulate the local incidents 
thereof, including local activities in both the states of origin 
and destination, which might have a substantial and harmful 
effect upon that commerce. One need only examine the evi-
dence which we have discussed above to see that Congress 
may—as it has—prohibit racial discrimination by motels serv-
ing travelers, however “local” their operations may appear.
* * * * *
 
The only questions are (1) whether Congress had a rational 
basis for finding that racial discrimination by motels affected 
commerce, and (2) if it had such a basis, whether the means it 
selected to eliminate that evil are reasonable and appropriate. 
If they are, appellant has no “right” to select its guests as it 
sees fit, free from governmental regulation.
* * * * *
 
It is doubtful if in the long run appellant will suffer eco-
nomic loss as a result of the act. Experience is to the contrary 
where discrimination is completely obliterated as to all public 
accommodations. But whether this be true or not is of no con-
sequence since this Court has specifically held that the fact 
that a “member of the class which is regulated may suffer 
economic losses not shared by others . . . has never been a 
barrier” to such legislation. . . .
 
We, therefore, conclude that the action of the Congress in 
the adoption of the act as applied here to a motel which 
 concededly serves interstate travelers is within the power 
granted it by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, as in-
terpreted by this Court for 140 years. . . .

Questions
1. In your judgment, does the Commerce Clause afford the 
federal government the authority to regulate a local busi-
ness like the Heart of Atlanta motel? Explain.
2. Should the federal government regulate local business to 
further the cause of racial equity? Explain.
3. What arguments were offered by the government to establish 
that the Heart of Atlanta racial policy affected interstate com-
merce? Are you persuaded by those arguments? Explain.
4. What test did the Court articulate to determine when 
 Congress has the power to pass legislation based on the 
Commerce Clause?
5. Ollie’s Barbecue, a neighborhood restaurant in Birming-
ham, Alabama, discriminated against black customers. 
McClung brought suit to test the application of the public 
accommodations section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to 
his restaurant. In the suit, the government offered no evi-
dence to show that the restaurant ever had served inter-
state customers or that it was likely to do so. Decide the 
case. See Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U.S. 294 (1964).
6. Juan Paul Robertson was charged with various narcotics 
offenses and with violating the federal Racketeer Influ-
enced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) by investing 
the proceeds from his unlawful activities in an Alaskan 
gold mine. He paid for some mining equipment in Los An-
geles and had it shipped to Alaska. He hired seven out-of-
state employees to work in the Alaskan mine. Most of the 
resulting gold was sold in Alaska, although Robertson 
transported $30,000 in gold out of the state. He was con-
victed on the RICO charge, but appealed claiming that the 
gold mine was not engaged in or affecting interstate com-
merce. Was Robertson’s gold mine engaged in or affecting 
interstate commerce? Explain. See United States v. Juan 
Paul Robertson, 115 S.Ct. 1732 (1995).

themselves. On the other hand, optimal efficiency, especially for the business commu-
nity, often demands one uniform federal rule rather than a patchwork of 50 state rules.18
 
In the event of an irreconcilable conflict between federal and state law, the Supremacy 
Clause, as interpreted by the courts, provides that federal law will preempt  (supersede) 
state or local law rendering it unconstitutional. In general, Supreme Court decisions have 
affirmed the federal government’s regulatory authority even when faced with conflicting 
state rules. Were it not so, we would have great difficulty in achieving a unified national 
policy on any issue. Recent Supreme Court preemption decisions have been split, some 
allowing state law to stand despite conflicts with federal law, others  being struck down.19
 
Regardless, the federalism doctrine has become a major source of conflict between 
states’ rights activists and those favoring more unified, federal doctrine. Tea Party 
 supporters and others are making the case for a renewal of atten-
tion to the Tenth Amendment command: “The powers not dele-
gated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it 
to the States, are reserved to the States, respectively, or to the peo-
ple.” The challengers believe the federal government often reaches 
beyond its constitutional authority.

Nullification
A number of states have passed or are considering laws to at least partially nullify (render 
void and inoperative) federal laws they believe to be unconstitutional extensions of federal 
power. State laws “legalizing” recreational marijuana use are an example of attempts to at 
least partially nullify federal laws. Other nullification efforts address, for example, the 
federal Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), gun control laws, and federal abortion laws. 
Although states do have some power to resist federal laws, most constitutional law au-
thorities and the relevant Supreme Court decisions [see, e.g., Ableman v. Booth, 62 U.S. 
506 (1859)] hold that state governments do not have general nullification power. 
Question
When confronting federal laws they believe to be unconstitutional, should states have the 
right to pass their own laws that would nullify those federal laws? Explain. For some ad-
vice on that question as well as a brief history of nullification, see Robert A. Levy, “The 
Limits of Nullification,” The New York Times, September 3, 2013 [w ww.nytimes.com/].
Part Two—State and Local Regulation of Interstate Commerce
As noted, the states via their constitutional police power have the authority to regulate com-
merce within their jurisdictions for the purpose of maintaining public health, safety, and 
morals. We have seen, however, that the Commerce Clause accords the federal government 
broad authority over commerce. As explained, the federal government has exclusive author-
ity over foreign commerce. Purely intrastate commerce, having no significant effect on inter-
state commerce, is within the exclusive regulatory jurisdiction of the states and localities. Of 
course, purely intrastate commerce is uncommon. The confusion arises in the middle ground 

of interstate commerce where regulation by the federal government or state governments or 
both may be permissible. Although federal government regulation of interstate commerce is 
pervasive, it is not exclusive, especially in matters involving the states’ police powers.
 
Our concern in this section is with commerce that is clearly interstate in nature but is, 
nonetheless, subjected to state and/or local regulation. The issue is whether that regulation is 
unconstitutional because it (1) discriminates against interstate commerce or (2) unduly bur-
dens interstate commerce such that the burden imposed clearly exceeds the local benefits.
 
In the Granholm case that follows, we see elements of the continuing conflict between 
federal and state control of interstate commerce, especially in matters of health and safety 
(police power). At the commercial level, the case is about another 
classic conflict: free trade versus protectionism. Can states lawfully 
protect their local wineries from out-of-state competition? The lower 
courts were divided on the question of whether the Commerce Clause 
of the federal constitution is violated when a state permits in-state 
wineries to ship directly to in-state customers while not permitting out-of-state wineries to do 
the same. Historically, only a few states had allowed wineries to ship directly to customers, 
but gradually about half of the states allowed direct shipments, resulting in a confusing situ-
ation where some states allowed all shipments, some permitted in-state shipments only, and 
some forbade all shipments. In the 5–4 decision that follows, the U.S. Supreme Court nar-
rowly resolved the split in the lower courts. The central question facing the Court was the 
conflict between the requirements of the Commerce Clause versus the requirements of the 
Twenty-First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. That amendment ended Prohibition in 
1933 and gave the states broad authority to regulate the sale of alcohol.
Can states lawfully protect 
their local wineries from

Granholm v. Heald 
544 U.S. 460 (2005)
I
Like many other states, Michigan and New York regulate the sale 
and importation of alcoholic beverages, including wine, through 
a three-tier distribution system. Separate licenses are required 
for producers, wholesalers, and retailers. . . . We have held 
 previously that states can mandate a three-tier distribution 
scheme in the exercise of their authority under the Twenty-First 
Amendment. As relevant to today’s cases, though, the three-tier 
system is, in broad terms and with refinements to be discussed, 
mandated by Michigan and New York only for sales from out-of-
state wineries. In-state wineries, by contrast, can obtain a 
 license for direct sales to consumers. The differential treatment 
between in-state and out-of-state wineries constitutes explicit 
discrimination against interstate commerce.
 
This discrimination substantially limits the direct sale of 
wine to consumers. . . . From 1994 to 1999, consumer  spending 
Justice Kennedy
These consolidated cases present challenges to state laws 
regulating the sale of wine from out-of-state wineries to 
consumers in Michigan and New York. The details and 
 mechanics of the two regulatory schemes differ, but the ob-
ject and effect of the laws are the same: to allow in-state 
wineries to sell wine directly to consumers in that state but 
to prohibit out-of-state wineries from doing so, or, at the 
least, to make direct sales impractical from an economic 
standpoint. It is evident that the object and design of the 
Michigan and New York  statutes is to grant in-state winer-
ies a competitive advantage over wineries located beyond 
the states’ borders.

on direct wine shipments doubled, reaching $500 million per 
year, or 3 percent of all wine sales. . . . [T]he number of small 
wineries in the United States has significantly increased. At 
the same time, the wholesale market has consolidated. . . . The 
increasing winery-to-wholesaler ratio means that many small 
wineries do not produce enough wine or have sufficient con-
sumer demand for their wine to make it economical for whole-
salers to carry their products. This has led many small 
wineries to rely on direct shipping to reach new markets. 
Technological improvements, in particular the ability of winer-
ies to sell wine over the Internet, have helped make direct 
shipments an attractive sales channel.
 
Approximately 26 states allow some direct shipping of 
wine, with various restrictions. Thirteen of these states have 
reciprocity laws, which allow direct shipment from wineries 
outside the state, provided the state of origin affords similar 
nondiscriminatory treatment. In many parts of the country, 
however, state laws that prohibit or severely restrict direct 
shipments deprive consumers of access to the direct market.
 
The wine producers in the cases before us are small win-
eries that rely on direct consumer sales as an important part 
of their businesses. Domaine Alfred, one of the plaintiffs in the 
Michigan suit, is a small winery located in San Luis Obispo, 
California. . . . Domaine Alfred has received requests for its 
wine from Michigan consumers but cannot fill the orders be-
cause of the state’s direct shipment ban. . . .
 
Similarly, Juanita Swedenburg and David Lucas, two of 
the plaintiffs in the New York suit, operate small wineries in 
Virginia (the Swedenburg Estate Vineyard) and California 
(the Lucas Winery). Some of their customers are tourists 
from other states, who purchase wine while visiting the 
wineries. If these customers wish to obtain Swedenburg or 
Lucas wines after they return home, they will be unable to 
do so if they  reside in a state with restrictive direct ship-
ment laws. . . .
A
We first address the background of the suit challenging the 
Michigan direct shipment law. Most alcoholic beverages in 
Michigan are distributed through the state’s three-tier system. 
Producers or distillers of alcoholic beverages, whether lo-
cated in state or out of state, generally may sell only to li-
censed in-state wholesalers. Wholesalers, in turn, may sell 
only to in-state retailers. Licensed retailers are the final link in 
the chain, selling alcoholic beverages to consumers at retail 
locations and, subject to certain restrictions, through home 
delivery.
 
Under Michigan law, wine producers, as a general matter, 
must distribute their wine through wholesalers. There is, 
 however, an exception for Michigan’s approximately 40  in-
state wineries, which are eligible for “wine maker” licenses 
that allow direct shipment to in-state consumers. The cost of 
the license varies with the size of the winery. For a small win-
ery, the license is $25. Out-of-state wineries can apply for a 
$300 “outside seller of wine” license, but this license only 
 allows them to sell to in-state wholesalers.
* * * * *
B
New York’s licensing scheme is somewhat different. It chan-
nels most wine sales through the three-tier system, but it too 
makes exceptions for in-state wineries. As in Michigan, the 
result is to allow local wineries to make direct sales to con-
sumers in New York on terms not available to out-of-state 
wineries. Wineries that produce only from New York grapes 
can apply for a license that allows direct shipment to in-state 
consumers. These licensees are authorized to deliver the 
wines of other wineries as well, but only if the wine is made 
from grapes “at least seventy-five percent the volume of 
which were grown in New York state.” An out-of-state 
 winery may ship directly to New York consumers only if it 
becomes a licensed New York winery, which requires the 
establishment of “a branch factory, office, or storeroom 
within the state of New York.”
* * * * *
C
We consolidated these cases and granted certiorari on the 
following question: “Does a state’s regulatory scheme that 
permits in-state wineries directly to ship alcohol to consum-
ers but restricts the ability of out-of-state wineries to do so 
violate the Commerce Clause in light of Section 2 of the 
Twenty-First Amendment?”
II
A
Time and again this Court has held that, in all but the narrowest 
circumstances, state laws violate the Commerce Clause if they 
mandate “differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state 
 economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the 
 latter.” This rule is essential to the foundations of the Union. The 
mere fact of nonresidence should not foreclose a producer in 
one state from access to markets in other States. States may 
not enact laws that burden out-of-state producers or shippers 
simply to give a competitive advantage to in-state businesses. 
This mandate “reflects a central concern of the Framers that 
344  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  345
was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Conven-
tion: the conviction that in order to succeed, the new Union 
would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic Balkani-
zation that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later 
among the States under the Articles of Confederation.”
* * * * *
B
The discriminatory character of the Michigan system is obvious. 
Michigan allows in-state wineries to ship directly to consumers, 
subject only to a licensing requirement. Out-of-state wineries, 
whether licensed or not, face a complete ban on direct ship-
ment. The differential treatment requires all out-of-state wine, 
but not all in-state wine, to pass through an in-state wholesaler 
and retailer before reaching consumers. These two extra layers 
of overhead increase the cost of out-of-state wines to Michigan 
consumers. The cost differential, and in some cases the inability 
to secure a wholesaler for small shipments, can effectively bar 
small wineries from the Michigan market.
* * * * *
 
The New York scheme grants in-state wineries access to 
the state’s consumers on preferential terms. . . . In-state pro-
ducers, with the applicable licenses, can ship directly to con-
sumers from their wineries. Out-of-state wineries must open a 
branch office and warehouse in New York, additional steps 
that drive up the cost of their wine.
* * * * *
 
We have no difficulty concluding that New York, like Mich-
igan, discriminates against interstate commerce through its 
direct shipping laws.
III
State laws that discriminate against interstate commerce face 
“a virtually per se rule of invalidity.” The Michigan and New 
York laws by their own terms violate this proscription. The two 
states, however, contend their statutes are saved by Section 2 
of the Twenty-First Amendment, which provides,
The Transportation or importation into any State, Territory, 
or possession of the United States for delivery or use 
therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws 
thereof, is hereby prohibited.
* * * * *
 
State policies are protected under the Twenty-First 
Amendment when they treat liquor produced out of state the 
same as its domestic equivalent. The instant cases, in 
 contrast, involve straightforward attempts to discriminate in 
favor of local producers. The discrimination is contrary to the 
Commerce Clause and is not saved by the Twenty-First 
Amendment.
IV
We still must consider whether either state regime “advances 
a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served 
by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.” The states of-
fer two primary justifications for restricting direct shipments 
from out-of-state wineries: keeping alcohol out of the hands of 
minors and facilitating tax collection.
 
The states claim that allowing direct shipment from out-
of-state wineries undermines their ability to police underage 
drinking. Minors, the states argue, have easy access to 
credit cards and the Internet and are likely to take advantage 
of direct wine shipments as a means of obtaining alcohol 
 illegally.
 
The states provide little evidence that the purchase of 
wine over the Internet by minors is a problem. Indeed, there is 
some evidence to the contrary. A recent study by the staff of 
the FTC found that the 26 states currently allowing direct 
shipments report no problems with minors’ increased access 
to wine.
* * * * *
 
Even were we to credit the states’ largely unsupported 
claim that direct shipping of wine increases the risk of under-
age drinking, this would not justify regulations limiting only 
out-of-state direct shipments. As the wineries point out, 
 minors are just as likely to order wine from in-state producers 
as from out-of-state ones. Michigan, for example, already 
 allows its licensed retailers (over 7,000 of them) to deliver 
 alcohol directly to consumers. . . .
 
The states’ tax collection justification is also insufficient.
* * * * *
 
Michigan and New York benefit from provisions of fed-
eral law that supply incentives for wineries to comply with 
state regulations. The Tax and Trade Bureau has authority 
to revoke a winery’s federal license if it violates state law. 
Without a federal license, a winery cannot operate in any 
state. . . .
 
These federal remedies, when combined with state licens-
ing regimes, adequately protect states from lost tax revenue.
* * * * *

If a state chooses to allow direct shipment of wine, it must do 
so on evenhanded terms. Without demonstrating the need for 

Summary of State and Local Regulation
The federal government receives greater attention, but state and local rules have an  enormous 
impact on business practice. The states are primarily responsible for regulating the insurance 
industry and are heavily involved in regulating banking, securities, and liquor sales. Many busi-
nesses and professions—from psychology to funeral preparation to barbering to the practice of 
medicine—require a license from the state. Public utilities (gas, electricity, sewage disposal) are 
the subject of extensive regulation governing entry, rates, customer service, and virtually all of 
the companies’ activities. All states have some form of public service commission charged with 
regulating utilities in the public interest. Many states seek to directly enhance competition via 
antitrust legislation. Many states have passed laws forbidding usury, false advertising, stock 
discrimination, New York and Michigan have enacted regula-
tions that disadvantage out-of-state wine producers. Under 
our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, these regulations [are 
unconstitutional].

Afterword
Approximately 40 states and the District of Columbia now al-
low wineries to ship directly to residents, although those 
shipments are often limited to just a few cases or to small 
wineries, and the Granholm decision applied to wineries 
only so retailers, in most states, still cannot ship directly to 
consumers.20 The alcohol industry continues to resist an 
open market preferring instead the three-tier producer, 
wholesaler, retailer distribution system that has been in 
place for decades, in part, to restrict access by minors and 
to encourage a broader selection of products while affirm-
ing states rights. Despite Granholm, a maze of state rules 
continues to discourage online wine sales. Only about 5 per-
cent of U.S. retail wine sales are achieved by direct ship-
ment to consumers.21

3. In 1988, Oneida and Herkimer counties in upstate New 
York created a Solid Waste Management Authority and 
enacted a “flow control ordinance” requiring that all 
waste generated within their borders was to be delivered 
to the  Authority’s newly created waste processing facili-
ties. In 1995, six waste haulers and a trade association 
sued the Authority and the counties claiming that the flow 
control ordinance and associated regulations violated 
the Commerce Clause by discriminating against inter-
state commerce. The plaintiffs provided evidence that 
they could dispose of the waste much less expensively at 
out-of-state facilities. How would you rule in this case? 
Explain. See United Haulers Assn., Inc. v. Oneida-
Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority, 127 S.Ct

4. North Dakota rules required those bringing liquor into 
the state to file a monthly report, and out-of-state distill-
ers selling to federal enclaves (military bases, in this 
instance) were required to label each item indicating 
that it was for consumption only within the enclave. The 
United States challenged those rules after sellers said

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  347
Big Soda Ban 
Inspired by then-mayor Michael Bloomberg, the New York City Board of Health in 2012 
approved a ban on the sale of sugary drinks in containers over 16 ounces in restaurants, 
stadiums, theaters, and other establishments regulated by the city health department. The 
rule did not forbid refills. According to the city, a switch from 20- to 16-ounce drinks by 
New Yorkers would “save” 2.3 million pounds per year.22 Americans drink much more 
soda than residents of other nations, and the U.S. bill for diabetes is about $245 billion an-
nually.23 Opponents see the rule as more government overreach by a “nanny state” deter-
mined to diminish personal freedom. A New York Times poll found about 6 in 10 New 
Yorkers opposed the ban.24 Some critics even consider the ban a discriminatory and pater-
nalistic attack on minority populations who tend to suffer most from obesity-related prob-
lems. The New York Times has pointed out, however, that many of the minority groups 
opposing the ban are the beneficiaries of tens of millions of dollars in beverage industry 
scholarships, conferences, and financial literacy classes.25
 
The contentious soda ban was struck down by a local state court judge in 2013, deter-
mining the rule wasn’t founded in fact and was riddled with loopholes and exceptions, 
making it unlawfully “arbitrary and capricious.” The judge also found that the board of 
health “trespassed” on the legislative powers of the New York City Council, thus “eviscer-
ating” the constitutional separation of powers doctrine.26
Questions
1. In 2014, New York state’s highest court declined to reinstate the soda ban. Would you 
approve of a nationwide soda ban? Explain. See Michael Grynbaum, “New York’s Ban 
on Big Sodas is Rejected by Final Court,” The New York Times, June 27, 2014 [www

2. a.  New Republic senior editor Timothy Noah: “[E]ven as liberals and conservatives 
profess to hate the idea of government paternalism, both practice it.” Provide some 
examples of government restrictions on individual choices as favored by liberals 
and as favored by conservatives. 
 
b.  Do you support these restraints? Explain. See Timot hy Noah, “Nanny Dearest,” The 
New Republic, June 8, 2012 [www.tnr.com/article/politics/magazine/103938/

3. Professor David B. Agus asks: “[W]hen does regulating a person’s habits in the name 
of good health become our moral and social duty?” Answer his question. See David B.

Licensure Local regulation is much less economically significant than state regulation. Lo-
cal government intervention in business typically involves various licensure requirements. 
For example, businesses like bars and theaters are often required to  obtain a local permit to 
operate. More broadly, more than 1,000 of America’s  occupations (medicine, law, building 
fraud, and other practices harmful to the consumer. [For the “largest Internet compilation” of 
state government materials, see www.hg.org/index.html]

348  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
construction, electrical work, and so on) can be practiced only by those who have secured 
licensure from federal, state, and/or local authorities. Licensure is to protect the public from 
unsafe, unhealthful, and substandard goods and services, but critics contend that licensure is 
often designed to block the entry of competitors and that the  benefits of licensure are ex-
ceeded by its costs in increased prices, decreased services, and administrative overhead. 
 
Benedictine monks at St. Joseph Abbey outside New Orleans recently challenged a state 
licensure rule when they were ordered by the Louisiana State Board of Embalmers and 
 Funeral Directors to close their business of building and selling caskets. The funeral industry 
cited a Louisiana regulation making it a crime for anyone other than state-licensed funeral 
directors to sell coffins in Louisiana. The monks sued and won when the Fifth U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals held that the funeral directors did not provide a rational basis for the chal-
lenged rule. Judge Patrick Higginbotham wrote that the rule “adds nothing to protect con-
sumers and puts them at a greater risk of abuse including exploitative prices.”27 Other courts 
have upheld state regulatory policy in similar cases, but the state funeral directors’ petition 
for review to the U.S. Supreme Court was rejected, and the monks can continue their work.
Cabs Need Rules?
New Orleans recently imposed new rules on all taxi cabs used to pick up passengers at 
Louis Armstrong International Airport. The rules require, among other things, credit card 
machines in the cabs, GPS devices, security cameras, working air conditioners, working 
meters, and drivers who speak English. In 2014, cabs cannot be older than seven years, 
regardless of condition. New Orleans has capped its “certificates of public necessity and 
convenience” (cab licenses) at 1,600. New Orleans also decided to treat the Certificates of 
Public Necessity (or CPNCs) as a “privilege” rather than as property. The average price for 
a CPNC in the secondary market reportedly is about $26,000. Legal challenges to the new 
rules have been unsuccessful, as of this writing. 
Questions
1. Explain the significance of treating a CPNC as a “privilege” rather than as a property 
right.
2. Why do most cities closely regulate the cab industry?

Rules and Community Welfare Most of us would say, in the abstract, that we need less 
government in our lives, but when we are the victims of problems that the market is ill-
suited to resolve, those rules become much more attractive. The case that follows shows 
how Tampa, Florida, tried to apply its rules to the age-old problem of adult entertainment 
businesses but with a new twist—product distribution by the Internet rather than by face-
to-face commerce.

 
Please be aware that the property is zoned RS-60 
Residential Single Family, and an adult use business is not 
permitted use. You should advise your client to cease 
operation at that location.
 
Thereafter, in April of 1999, Dan and Sharon Gold Marshlack 
[owners of the property located at 2312 W. Farwell] appealed 
the zoning coordinator’s decision to Tampa’s Variance Review 
Board. On or about July 13, 1999, the Variance Review Board 
conducted a hearing. At the hearing, Voyeur Dorm’s counsel 
conceded the following: that five women live in the house; that 
there are cameras in the corners of all the rooms of the house; 
that for a fee a person can join a membership to a Web site 
wherein a member can view the women 24 hours a day, seven 
days a week; that a member, at times, can see someone dis-
robed; that the women receive free room and board; that the 
women are part of a business enterprise; and that the women 
are paid. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Variance Review 
Board unanimously upheld the zoning  coordinator’s determina-
tion that the use occurring at 2312 West Farwell Drive was an 
adult use. Subsequently, Mr. and Mrs. Marshlack filed an ap-
peal from the decision of the  Variance Review Board to the City 
Council. The Tampa City Council . . . unanimously affirmed the 
decision of the Variance Review Board.
 
Voyeur Dorm filed this action in the middle district of 
 Florida. The City of Tampa and Voyeur Dorm then filed cross-
motions for summary judgment. The district court granted 
Tampa’s motion for summary judgment, from which Voyeur 
Dorm now appeals.
ISSUE
1. Whether the district court properly determined that the al-
leged activities occurring at 2312 West Farwell Drive consti-
tute a public offering of adult entertainment as contemplated 
by Tampa’s zoning restrictions.
 
[Issues 2. and 3. are omitted.—Ed.]
DISCUSSION
The threshold inquiry is whether section 27-523 of Tampa’s 
city code applies to the alleged activities occurring at 2312 
West Farwell Drive. Because of the way we answer that in-
quiry, it will not be necessary for us to analyze the thorny con-
stitutional issues presented in this case.
* * * * *
 
Tampa argues that Voyeur Dorm is an adult use business 
pursuant to the express and unambiguous language of 
Circuit Judge Dubina
This appeal arises from Voyeur Dorm L.C.’s alleged violation of 
Tampa’s City Code based on the district court’s characteriza-
tion of Voyeur Dorm as an adult entertainment facility.
BACKGROUND
Voyeur Dorm operates an Internet-based Web site that pro-
vides a 24-hour-a-day Internet transmission portraying the 
lives of the residents of 2312 West Farwell Drive, Tampa, 
Florida. Throughout its existence, Voyeur Dorm has em-
ployed 25 to 30 different women, most of whom entered into 
a contract that specifies, among other things, that they are 
“employees,” on a “stage and filming location,” with “no 
reasonable expectation of privacy,” for “entertainment pur-
poses.” Subscribers to “voyeurdorm.com” pay a subscrip-
tion fee of $34.95 a month to watch the women employed at 
the premises and pay an added fee of $16.00 per month to 
“chat” with the women. From August 1998 to June 2000, Vo-
yeur Dorm generated subscriptions and sales totaling 
$3,166,551.35.
 
In 1998 Voyeur Dorm learned that local law enforcement 
agencies had initiated an investigation into its business. In re-
sponse, counsel for Voyeur Dorm sent a letter to Tampa’s zon-
ing coordinator requesting her interpretation of the city code 
as it applied to the activities occurring at 2312 West Farwell 
Drive. In February of 1999, Tampa’s zoning coordinator, Gloria 
Moreda, replied to counsel’s request and issued her interpre-
tation of the city code:
* * * * *
It is my determination that the use occurring at 2312 W. 
Farwell Dr., is an adult use. Section 27-523 defines adult 
entertainment as “Any premises, except those businesses 
otherwise defined in this chapter, on which is offered to 
members of the public or any person, for a consideration, 
entertainment featuring or in any way including specified 
sexual activities, as defined in this section, or 
entertainment featuring the displaying or depicting of 
specified anatomical areas, as defined in this section; 
‘entertainment’ as used in this definition shall include, but 
not be limited to, books, magazines, films, newspapers, 
photographs, paintings, drawings, sketches or other 
publications or graphic media, filmed or live plays, dances 
or other performances distinguished by their display or 
depiction of specified anatomical areas or specified 
anatomical activities, as defined in this section.”
Voyeur Dorm v. City of Tampa
265 F.3d 1232 (11th Cir. 2001); cert. den. 122 S.Ct. 
1172 (2002)
L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E

 Section 27-523 and, as such, cannot operate in a residential 
neighborhood. In that regard, Tampa points out that members 
of the public pay to watch women employed on the premises; 
that the employment agreement refers to the premises as “a 
stage and filming location;” that certain anatomical areas 
and sexual activities are displayed for entertainment; and 
that the entertainers are paid accordingly. Most importantly, 
Tampa asserts that nothing in the city code limits its applica-
bility to premises where the adult entertainment is actually 
consumed.
 
In accord with Tampa’s arguments, the district court spe-
cifically determined that the “plain and unambiguous lan-
guage of the city code . . . does not expressly state a 
requirement that the members of the public paying considera-
tion be on the premises viewing the adult entertainment.” 
While the public does not congregate to a specific edifice or 
location in order to enjoy the entertainment provided by Vo-
yeur Dorm, the district court found 2312 West Farwell Drive to 
be “a premises on which is offered to members of the public 
for consideration entertainment featuring specified sexual ac-
tivities within the plain meaning of the city code.”
 
Moreover, the district court relied on Supreme Court and 
Eleventh Circuit precedent that trumpets a city’s entitlement 
to protect and improve the quality of residential neighbor-
hoods. Sammy’s of Mobile, Ltd. v. City of Mobile (noting that 
it is well established that the regulation of public health, 
safety, and morals is a valid and substantial state interest); 
Corn v. City of Lauderdale Lakes (noting that the “Supreme 
Court has held [that] restrictions may be imposed to protect 
‘family values, youth values, and the blessings of quiet 
 seclusion’”).
 
In opposition, Voyeur Dorm argues that it is not an adult 
use business. Specifically, Voyeur Dorm contends that section 
27-523 applies to locations or premises wherein adult enter-
tainment is actually offered to the public. Because the public 
does not, indeed cannot, physically attend 2312 West Farwell 
Drive to enjoy the adult entertainment, 2312 West Farwell 
Drive does not fall within the purview of Tampa’s zoning 
 ordinance.
 
The residence of 2312 West Farwell Drive provides no 
 “offering [of adult entertainment] to members of the public.” 
The offering occurs when the videotaped images are 
 dispersed over the Internet and into the public eye for con-
sumption. The city code cannot be applied to a location that 
does not, itself, offer adult entertainment to the public.
* * * * *
 
It does not follow, then, that a zoning ordinance designed 
to restrict facilities that offer adult entertainment can be 
 applied to a particular location that does not, at that location, 
offer adult entertainment. Moreover, the case law relied upon 
by Tampa and the district court concerns adult entertainment 
in which customers physically attend the premises wherein 
the entertainment is performed. Here, the audience or 
 consumers of the adult entertainment do not go to 2312 West 
Farwell Drive or congregate anywhere else in Tampa to enjoy 
the entertainment. Indeed, the public offering occurs over the 
Internet in “virtual space.” While the district court read Sec-
tion 27-523 in a literal sense, finding no requirement that the 
paying public be on the premises, we hold that section 27-523 
does not apply to a residence at which there is no public offer-
ing of adult entertainment.

Questions
1. a. Why did the court rule against Tampa?
 
b.  Make the argument, as the lower court did, that the 
Tampa statute does apply to Voyeur Dorm.
 
c.  Why was Tampa concerned about Voyeur Dorm operat-
ing in a residential neighborhood?
 
d.  Does Tampa have any additional legal grounds for chal-
lenging Voyeur Dorm? Explain.
2. The city government in Cedar Falls, Iowa, home of the Uni-
versity of Northern Iowa, declined to renew the liquor li-
cense of a local bar after 58 of 100 “bar checks” over a 
period of nearly two years found minors drinking illegally. 
One hundred and seventy four alcohol-related tickets were 
issued over that period.28
 
a.  Could the free market satisfactorily protect the public 
from the various risks associated with excessive drink-
ing by college-age students, or are rules necessary?
 
b.  Would you vote to renew this bar’s liquor license? Explain.
3. Two Dallas, Texas, ordinances were challenged in court. 
One gave the police very broad authority to deny licenses 
to “adult” businesses such as bookstores. The other, 
which was directed at prostitution, barred motel owners 
from renting rooms for fewer than 10 hours.
 
a.  What challenges would you raise against these 
 ordinances?
 
b.  How would you rule? Explain. See FW/PBS Inc v. City of 
Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990).
4. The Los Angeles municipal code prohibits some types of 
new billboards and restricts the size, placement, and illu-
mination of others. The Los Angeles code seeks to “pro-
mote public safety and welfare” by “providing reasonable 
protection to the visual environment” and by ensuring that 
350  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  351
billboards do not “interfere with traffic safety or otherwise 
endanger public safety.” One provision of the code specifi-
cally forbids new “Freeway Facing Signs” located within 
2,000 feet of and “viewed primarily from” a freeway or an 
on-ramp/off-ramp. Another forbids, with exceptions, new 
“supergraphics,” large format signs projected onto or 
hung from building walls. The Los Angeles rules allow new 
signs in some portions of the city while banning them in 
others.
 
a.  The billboard rules were challenged on constitutional 
grounds. Explain those grounds and rule on the 
 constitutionality of the rules. See World Wide Rush v. 
City of Los Angeles, 606 F.3d 676 (9th Cir. 2010).
 
b.  Should Los Angeles simply allow the market to deter-
mine where billboards are placed? Explain.
5. Tattoo and body piercing statutes sometimes require liabil-
ity insurance, licensing, training, and health inspections, 
and parents are to accompany minors. Does each of those 
requirements seem appropriate to you? Explain.
6. a.  Can we rely on the market to protect teens from exces-
sive tanning? Explain.
 
b. Has the market failed? Explain.
Questions—Parts One and Two
1. Matthew Hale, a law school graduate, was denied a license to practice law in Illinois 
because Hale was an avowed racist and the leader of a white supremacist group. A state 
panel assessed the character and general fitness of all those who had passed the bar 
exam and graduated from law school and decided that Hale’s active racism disqualified 
him. Illinois is one of 32 states with character and fitness standards. Hale appealed on 
First Amendment grounds, among others. Should Hale be excluded from the practice of 
law, or should we let the market decide his fitness? Explain.
2. City officials in Machesney Park, Illinois required nine-year-old Gregory Webb to tear 
down his makeshift tree house on the grounds that it was a nuisance. Webb had built the 
structure from lawn chairs, leftover carpet, and a pet carrier, among other objects. The 
city was criticized for its decision.
a.  Why would a city choose to exercise its police power over nuisances in this seem-
ingly trivial case?
b.  What would you do if you were the city planning and zoning director and thus 
 responsible for the situation?
3. Notwithstanding the successful deregulation efforts in recent decades, the larger trend 
in the United States over the past 50 years, and particularly since the financial crisis of 
recent years, has been increased government regulation of business. How do you 
 explain that trend?
4. As a safety measure, Arizona enacted a statute that limited the length of passenger 
trains to 14 cars and freight trains to 70 cars. Trains of those lengths and greater were 
common throughout the United States. The Southern Pacific Railroad challenged the 
Arizona statute.
a. What was the legal foundation of the Southern Pacific claim?
b. Decide the case. Explain. See Southern Pacific Railroad v. Arizona, 325 U.S. 761 (1945).
5. At this writing in 2013, a Florida state senate committee has passed new rules for para-
sailing, a largely unregulated commercial recreational activity. The new rules, if fully 
approved, would require insurance for operators, an onboard observer, and allow opera-
tion only when winds do not exceed 20 miles per hour.

In 2012, a Connecticut woman dropped from her harness to her death while parasailing 
near Pompano Beach, Florida. Such deaths  are unusual with several dozen having been 
estimated worldwide in the past 30 years, but Florida has seen four in the past two 
years.
a. How would you argue that parasailing deaths often constitute a market failure?
b. Would you vote for a parasailing rule, or would you leave parasailing safety to the 
market? Explain.
Part Three—Administrative Agencies and the Regulatory Process
Introduction to Administrative Agencies29
Suppose you start a business: a small, relatively simple business, perhaps a restaurant. You 
quickly come to realize that the government is going to be your partner in that business. 
Taxes, wages, hours, sanitation, safety, advertising, zoning—at every turn a government 
rule shapes the conduct of your business. In many cases those rules are created and 
 enforced by administrative agencies, a powerful subset of government little understood by 
the public but immensely influential in every corner of American life.
The Federal Agencies
Federal law defines an agency as any government unit other than the legislature and the 
courts. Thus, the administrative law governing those agencies technically addresses the 
entire executive branch of government. Our attention, however, will be directed to the 
prominent regulatory agencies (Federal Trade Commission, Federal Communications 
 Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the like) rather than the various 
executive departments (Agriculture, Defense, and so on) and nonregulatory welfare 
 agencies (Social Security Administration and Veterans Administration). We will focus on 
the federal level, but administrative law principles are generally applicable to the conduct 
of state and local governments. At the state level, public utility commissions and the 
various state licensure boards for law, medicine, architecture, and the like are examples of 
administrative agencies. At the local level, one might cite planning and zoning boards and 
property tax assessment appeals boards. [To search for federal government information 
on the World Wide Web, see www.gpoaccess.gov/index.html or www.fedworld.gov]
History
Congress established the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), the first federal regulatory 
agency, in 1887 for the purpose of regulating railroad routes and rates. The Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA—1907) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC—1914) followed, 
but federal regulation became pervasive only in response to the Great Depression of the 1930s. 
Congress created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC—1934), the Federal 

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  353
Communications Commission (FCC—1934), the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB—1940; 
abolished 1985), and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB—1935), among others, 
as a response to the widely shared belief that the stock market crash and the Depression 
were evidence of the failure of the free market.
 
The next major burst of regulatory activity arrived in the 1960s and 1970s when 
 Congress created such agencies as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
(EEOC—1965), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA—1970), the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA—1970), and the Consumer Product Safety 
Commission (CPSC—1972).
 
Note that the work of most of the early agencies was directed to controlling entire 
 industries such as transportation or communications and that the primary purpose of most 
of those agencies was to address economic concerns. Then with the arrival of the prosper-
ity and social turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s, Congress built a rather massive array of 
new agencies directed not to economic issues but to social reform in such areas as 
 discrimination, the environment, job safety, and product safety.
 
The free market enthusiasm of the 1980s resulted in strenuous efforts to deregulate the 
economy and reduce the influence of the federal agencies and the government generally. 
Now, in the early 21st century we have been in a period of general respect for the free 
 market, but current problems in the finance industry, particularly in home mortgages, have 
resulted in aggressive new rules, as explained below.
Creating the Agencies
Federal agencies are of two kinds: executive and independent. Executive agencies usually 
are located within the departments of the executive branch of the government. The Federal 
Aviation Administration, for example, is a part of the Department of Transportation. Our 
primary interest is in the independent agencies (FTC, FCC, and SEC). Congress created 
those agencies via statutes labeled enabling legislation and accorded them substantial 
 authority to regulate a specified segment of American life. The FTC, for example, is 
 empowered by its enabling legislation to pursue unfair trade practices. The president has 
direct authority over the executive agencies while the independent agencies are intended to 
operate with less fear of interference. In practice, of course, the president and Congress 
have substantial influence on all the agencies.
 
In creating an agency, Congress delegates a portion of its authority to that body. 
 Congress acknowledges the existence of a problem and recognizes that it is not the appro-
priate body to address the specific elements of that problem—hence the agency. The pres-
ident, ordinarily with the advice and consent of the Senate, appoints the administrator or 
the several commissioners who direct each agency’s affairs. Commissioners are appointed 
in staggered terms, typically of seven years’ duration. The appointment of commissioners 
for most of the independent agencies must reflect an approximate political balance  between 
the two major parties.
 
In effect, Congress has created a fourth branch of government. Possessing neither the time 
nor the expertise to handle issues arising from nuclear power, product safety, racial discrimi-
nation, labor unions, and much more, Congress wisely established “mini governments” sup-
ported by the necessary technical resources and day-to-day authority to address those 
complicated problems.

354  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
Agency Duties
The authority of the federal regulatory agencies falls broadly into three categories.
1. Control of supply. Some agencies control entry into certain economic activities. 
The Federal Communications Commission grants radio and television licenses. The Food 
and Drug Administration (see Chapter 15) decides which drugs may enter the American 
market. The Securities and Exchange Commission (see Chapter 9) acts as a gatekeeper, 
preventing the entry of new securities into the marketplace until certain standards are met. 
The general concern is that the market alone cannot adequately protect the public interest.
2. Control of rates. Historically, those federal agencies charged with regulating utili-
ties and carriers (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, ICC, and CAB) set the prices to 
be charged for the services offered within their jurisdictions, but the deregulation move-
ment resulted in the elimination of the CAB and the ICC and a general decline in agency 
rate-setting. The federal government decided to reduce or eliminate its authority in deci-
sions such as the price of airline tickets, cable TV rates, and long-distance telephone rates.
3. Control of conduct.
a. Information. Agencies commonly compel companies to disclose consumer informa-
tion that would otherwise remain private. Warning labels, for example, may be mandated.
b. Standards. Where simply requiring information is deemed inadequate for the public 
needs, the government may establish minimum standards that the private sector must meet. 
A ladder might be required to safely hold at least a specified weight, or workers might law-
fully be exposed to only a specified maximum level of radiation.
c. Product banishments. In rare circumstances, products can be banned from the 
 market. The Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the flame retardant Tris (used 
in children’s sleepwear) because of evidence of the product’s cancer-causing properties.
Questions
1. The phrase “government regulation” embraces many functions. Define it.
2. Is the federal regulatory process limited in its goals to the correction of market failures? 
Should it be so limited? Explain.
Operating the Agencies
As we have noted, the administrative agencies act as mini governments, performing quasi-
executive, quasi-legislative (rule-making), and quasi-judicial (adjudicatory) roles broadly 
 involving control of supply, rates, and conduct in large segments of American life. Agency 
action is guided generally by the 1946 Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which Congress 
enacted to provide a framework for agency rule-making and to detail broad standards for 
 judicial review of agency decisions. Let’s look at how those agencies practice their business.
Executive Functions
The basic executive duty of the various agencies is to implement the policy provided for in 
the enabling legislation and in the agencies’ own rules and regulations. A large part of 

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  355
agency activity consists of performing mundane, repetitive tasks. Agencies enter into con-
tracts, lease federal lands, register securities offerings, award grants, resolve tax disputes, 
settle workers’ compensation claims, administer government benefits to the citizenry, and 
so on. Of course, a big part of the agencies’ executive duties is the protection of the public 
by ensuring compliance with laws and regulations. Therefore, most agencies spend a great 
deal of time conducting inspections and investigations and collecting information.
 
Most agencies offer informal advice, both in response to requests and on their own ini-
tiative, to explain agency policy and positions. Each year the Federal Trade Commission, 
for example, receives many complaints about alleged fraud in advertising, telemarketing, 
identity theft, Internet commerce, and so on. Supervisory duties, including most notably 
the active and close attention given to the banking industry, are a further illustration of 
agency executive duties.
Legislative Functions
The agencies create rules that, in effect, are laws. These rules provide the details necessary 
to carry out the intentions of the enabling legislation. In day-to-day business practice, the 
rules are likely to be much more important than the original congressional legislation. The 
Occupational Safety and Health Act calls for a safe and healthful workplace, but the rules 
necessary for interpreting and enforcing that general mandate come, not from Congress, 
but from OSHA.
Rules
Agencies enact three types of rules: (1) procedural, (2) interpretive, and (3) legislative. 
Procedural rules delineate the agency’s internal operating structure and methods. Interpre-
tive rules offer the agency’s view of the meaning of those statutes for which the agency has 
administrative responsibility. Internal Revenue Service regulations are an example of in-
terpretive rules. Legislative rules are policy expressions having the effect of law. The 
agency is exercising the law-making function delegated to it by the legislature. Federal 
Trade Commission rules providing for a cooling-off period of three business days within 
which the buyer may cancel door-to-door sales contracts are an example of agency law-
making that significantly affects business behavior.
The Rule-Making Process
The Administrative Procedure Act provides for both informal (often called “notice and 
comment”) and formal rule-making processes for legislative rules. Under both approaches, 
the process begins with the publication of a Notice of Proposed Rule Making in the  Federal 
Register (a daily publication of all federal rules, regulations, and orders). Thereafter, in the 
case of informal rule making, the agency must permit written comments on the proposal 
and may hold open hearings. To enhance participation in the rule-making process, the 
 federal government provides an online portal where the public can comment on proposed 
rules [see www.regulations.gov]. Having received public comments, the agency either 
discontinues the process or prepares the final rule.
 
In the case of formal rule-making, after providing notice, the agency must hold a public 
hearing conducted with most of the procedural safeguards of a trial, where all interested 
parties may call witnesses, challenge the agency evidence, and so on.

Hybrid Rule-Making Although not specifically provided for in the APA, agency rule-
making now is often achieved by a compromise (hybrid) process that combines elements 
of formal and informal rule-making. Hybrid rule-making is informal rule making with ad-
ditions in the form of some trial elements (more oral testimony and hearings) that have the 
effect of providing a more detailed record without all of the procedural requirements of 
formal rule-making.
 
Whether by formal, informal, or hybrid procedures, final agency rules are published in 
the Federal Register and later compiled in the Code of Federal Regulations. [To search the 
Federal Register, see www.gpoaccess.gov/fr/index.html]
Challenging an Agency Rule
At this writing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is in the midst of a long-
running dispute with Congress and the courts about the Commission’s interest in continued 
relaxation of rules limiting a single company’s ownership (called cross-ownership) of ra-
dio stations, television stations, and newspapers in the same market.30 The rules were de-
signed to protect communities from media monopolies and to increase diversity in the 
marketplace of ideas.31 The FCC, however, points to the Internet and other technological 
advances that reduce the threat of media monopoly, thus providing some space for in-
creased  cross-ownership. On the other hand, the critics, including many in Congress, main-
tain a firm stance against most further consolidation. They note the FCC’s 1996 decision 
to lift its limit on how many radio stations one company could own 
nationally. The result was the  development of the Clear Channel 
network (currently about 850 stations) that has been broadly criti-
cized for “homogenizing” radio and sharply reducing local pro-
gramming. Notwithstanding the continuing struggle over media 
ownership, we should remember that the FCC and other agencies often successfully 
achieve voluntary arrangements with those being regulated.32
The cross-ownership debate illustrates a pair of economic policy questions at the core 
of this text: Will the market and corporate social responsibility provide for the nation’s 
best interests? Or are legal restraints necessary to prevent too much concentration of power 
and authority in too few hands? [For a “source of regulatory news, analysis, and opinion,” 
see RegBlog at www.law.upenn.edu/blogs/regblog/]
Judicial Functions
Although informal procedures such as settlements are preferred, agencies commonly must 
turn to judicial proceedings to enforce agency rules. The National Labor Relations Board 
may hold a hearing to determine if an employee was wrongfully dismissed for engaging in 
protected union activities. The Federal Communications Commission may decide whether 
to remove a radio license because of a failure to serve the public interest. The Federal 
Trade Commission may judge whether a particular ad is misleading.
Rule-Making or Adjudication?
Many issues facing agencies could properly be resolved either by rule-making or by adju-
dication. Characteristically, however, an adjudication addresses specific parties involved in 
a specific present or past dispute. Rule-making ordinarily involves standards to be applied 
Clear Channel has 
been  criticized for 
“homogenizing” radio.

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  357
to the future conduct of a class of unspecified parties. The rule-making/adjudication deci-
sion is discretionary with the agency (subject to judicial review) and is based on the nature 
of the issue and fairness to the parties. Regardless, the agencies are, in effect, “making 
law” either by setting a judiciallike precedent in the case of an adjudication or by passing 
a rule that has authority much like a law.
Administrative Hearing
Typically, after an investigation, a violation of a statute and/or rule may be alleged. Af-
fected parties are notified. An effort is made to reach a settlement via a consent order, in 
which the party being investigated agrees to steps suitable to the agency but under which 
the respondent makes no admission of guilt (thus, retarding the likelihood of subsequent 
civil liability).
Administrative Law Judge
Failing a settlement, the parties proceed much as in a civil trial. Ordinarily the case is heard 
by an administrative law judge (ALJ). The respondent may be represented by counsel. Par-
ties have the right to present their cases, cross-examine, file motions, raise objections, and 
so on. They do not have the right to a jury trial, however. The ALJ decides all questions of 
law and fact and then issues a decision (order). In general, that decision is final unless ap-
pealed to the agency/commission. After exhausting opportunities for review within the 
agency, appeal may be taken to the federal court system.
The Minerals Management Service (MMS) was a federal 
agency charged with collecting oil and gas royalties from 
companies drilling on federal lands. A 2008 Interior Depart-
ment internal investigation concluded that several MMS 
officials “frequently consumed alcohol at industry func-
tions, had used cocaine and marijuana, and had sexual 
relationships with oil and gas company representa-
tives.”33 Reportedly, MMS staffers took gifts from oil and 
gas officials with “prodigious frequency.”34 Some MMS 
decisions, while less vivid than the sex,drugs, and payoffs, 
were of much more far reaching consequence. The MMS 
reportedly gave British Petroleum’s Gulf of Mexico oil 
lease a “categorical exclusion” that exempted the lease 
from a detailed environmental impact analysis in 2009.35 
BP’s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded in 2010, 
leading to the calamitous oil spill that polluted much of 
the Gulf of Mexico. MMS, now disbanded, has been re-
placed by two new federal agencies, but its misconduct 
is a particularly lurid and frustrating example of the risk 
that agencies will be improperly influenced (captured) by 
the industries they are intended to regulate.
 
Scholars argue that agency capture is a form of gov-
ernment failure that can occur when regulators are too 
cozy with the industry being regulated or when industry 
representatives have the interest and resources to offer 
detailed advice on agency business while the public 
voice, being much less focused, is seldom or never heard 
by the agency. Political scientists argue that regulatory 
capture of both agencies and congressional committees 
sometimes produces a stable, nearly impregnable, iron 
triangle. Powerful interest groups (often businesses), oc-
cupy one corner of the triangle, congressional commit-
tees are at another corner, and agency bureaucrats 
occupy the third. In the resulting alliance, each group cul-
tivates its own welfare by providing political support (from 
interest groups to members of Congress) writing favorable 
P R A C T I C I N G  E T H I C S
Agency Capture, Iron Triangles, and 
Revolving Doors?

358  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
laws (from Congress to interest groups) and by agency 
enforcement of those laws in ways favorable to the inter-
est groups and Congress. The likely  result is diminished 
attention to the public good.
 
Regulatory capture is facilitated by a revolving door 
wherein agency officials often come from the very indus-
try they are hired to regulate and agency regulators often 
leave government to work for the industry formerly regu-
lated. A 2011 study found that nearly 5,400 congressional 
employees left government work to become federal lob-
byists during the previous 10 years.36  Troublesome as 
these government/industry ties may seem, we should 
 remember that we want and need close associations 
 between government agencies and the  industries being 
regulated. Each benefits from the expertise of the other. 
Further, federal conflict of interest laws do impose some 
restrictions on private-sector work following government 
service.37
Controlling the Agencies
Although agency influence in business practice and in American life generally is enor-
mous, none of these agencies and their thousands of employees is directly accountable to 
the people, and all of them operate under necessarily broad grants of power. What is to 
keep them from abusing their discretion or from being “captured” by special interests? Just 
as with our constitutional system generally, certain checks and balances constrain agency 
conduct while allowing the latitude necessary to achieve effectiveness.
Executive Constraints
As noted, the president appoints the top administrators for the various agencies, thus 
 significantly influencing the conservative or liberal slant of the agency. Furthermore, the 
president obviously has great influence in the budget process.
 
Recent presidents have strengthened executive oversight of agency action by requiring 
cost-benefit analyses for new rules (President Clinton) and commanding agencies to cite a 
specific market failure before issuing a new rule (President George W. Bush). President 
Obama has maintained the cost-benefit expectation and he has introduced a new initiative 
to get rid of what he has labeled “dumb” rules. Recently, President Obama ordered all 
 federal agencies to eliminate outdated rules that “stifle job creation and make our economy 
less competitive,” and he has asked Congress for authority to consolidate a number of fed-
eral agencies.38 [For an OMB “watchdog” see www.ombwatch.org/]
Congressional Constraints
Congress creates and can dissolve the agencies. Congress controls agency budgets and thus 
can encourage or discourage particular agency action. Broadly, Congress oversees agency 
 action, and agencies often check with Congress before undertaking major initiatives. Congress 
can directly intervene by amending the enabling legislation or by passing laws that require 
agencies to take specific directions. The difficulty in balancing congressional and agency 
 authority is well illustrated by an important 2001 Supreme Court decision involving the  federal 
Clean Air Act (CAA). The case, Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc.39 raised the 
question of whether Congress had improperly delegated its authority to the Environmental 
Protection Agency and whether the EPA must take the cost of implementing clean air regula-
tions into consideration when developing new rules. A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that 

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  359
Congress had built into the CAA constitutionally sufficient limitations on agency action, and 
the Court ruled that Congress clearly did not require the EPA to conduct cost–benefit analyses 
before establishing new rules. Thus the Court concluded that Congress can constitutionally 
offer agencies broad authority in carrying out Congress’s general intentions.
Judicial Review
Agency rules and orders may be challenged in court. Historically, however, the courts 
have taken a rather narrow approach to judicial review. The jurists, being generalists in the 
field of law, have been reluctant to overrule the judgment of specialists, and very crowded 
judicial calendars act as a natural brake on activist judicial review. For those reasons, 
judges readily sustain the judgment of the agency where reasonable. Of course, the courts 
overrule the agencies when appropriate, and review of controversial, high visibility rules 
such as many of those issued by the Environmental Protection Agency is common.
 
Not surprisingly, judicial review of agency decisions raises a variety of technical issues 
of law. Cases turn on questions like these:
1. Does the legislature’s delegation of authority meet constitutional requirements?
2. Has the agency exceeded the authority granted by the enabling legislation?
3. Are the agency’s findings of fact supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole?
4. Was the agency’s decision “arbitrary and capricious” (a standard provided for in the 
Administrative Procedure Act and discussed in the FCC v. Fox case below)?
While these issues are technically important, their detailed exploration is not necessary for 
our purposes. The case that follows will be our only consideration of the formalities of 
 judicial review. This 8–0 U.S. Supreme Court ruling examines the question of when the 
government should regulate distasteful expression over the regulated airways.

Third, ABC’s February 25, 2003, telecast of NYPD Blue dis-
played the nude buttocks of an adult female character for 
about seven seconds and the side of her breast for a moment, 
as she was preparing for a shower. A child portraying her boy-
friend’s son entered the bathroom during the scene. 
 
Then in 2004 the Federal Communications Commission 
sanctioned NBC for the following remark by Bono, who won 
an award at the 2003 Golden Globe Awards show: “This is 
Facts
Three episodes of alleged indecency on network television are 
at issue in this case. First, at the 2002 Billboard Music Awards, 
televised by Fox, Cher made the following unscripted remark: 
“I’ve also had my critics for the last 40 years saying that I was 
on my way out every year. So f*** ‘em.” Second, during the 
Fox telecast of the 2003 Billboard Music Awards, Nicole Richie 
made the following unscripted remark: “Have you ever tried to

 really, really, f***ing brilliant. Really, really great.” The FCC 
found use of the F-word actionably indecent. Reversing prior 
rulings, the Commission ruled that even fleeting expletives, 
like the single use of the F-word by Bono, were actionable. 
The isolated and apparently impromptu nature of the remark 
did not excuse its indecency. 
 
Applying its new policy to the Cher, Richie, and NYPD Blue 
cases, the FCC then ruled that Fox and ABC had violated the 
Commission’s indecency standards by televising fleeting ex-
pletives and fleeting nudity. Fox was not punished, but ABC 
and its affiliates were fined $1.24 million. The Fox case (Fox I) 
then went to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit, which overturned the Commission ruling saying it was 
“arbitrary and capricious” in that the FCC made a 180- degree 
turn regarding fleeting expletives without providing a reasoned 
explanation. Fox I then went to the Supreme Court in 2009 
where the Court of Appeals ruling was reversed with the Court 
saying that a change in FCC policy must be announced, but 
detailed justifications are not required as a matter of law. Fox I 
then returned to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals which 
struck down the Commission’s entire indecency policy finding 
it unconstitutionally vague because it failed to give broadcast-
ers sufficient notice of what would be considered indecent. In 
light of that decision, the Second Circuit vacated the forfeiture 
order against ABC. The federal government sought review of 
both decisions, which was granted by the Supreme Court lead-
ing to the opinion (Fox II) that follows.
Justice Kennedy

I 
A
Title 18 U.S.C. § 1464 provides that “[w]hoever utters any ob-
scene, indecent, or profane language by means of radio com-
munication shall be fined . . . or imprisoned not more than 
two years, or both.” The Federal Communications Commission 
(Commission) has been instructed by Congress to enforce 
§ 1464 between the hours of 6 am and 10 pm.
 
This Court first reviewed the Commission’s indecency policy 
in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978). In Pacifica, 
the Commission determined that George Carlin’s “Filthy Words” 
monologue was indecent. It contained “language that de-
scribes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contempo-
rary community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or 
excretory activities and organs, at times of the day when there 
is a reasonable risk that children may be in the audience.” Id., 
at 732. This Court upheld the Commission’s ruling. 
* * * * *
 
In 2001, the Commission . . . [in describing] what it consid-
ered patently offensive, . . . explained that three factors had 
proved significant: 
 
“(1) [T]he explicitness or graphic nature of the description 
or depiction of sexual or excretory organs or activities; (2) 
whether the material dwells on or repeats at length descrip-
tions of sexual or excretory organs or activities; (3) whether the 
material appears to pander or is used to titillate, or whether the 
material appears to have been presented for its shock value.” 
 
As regards the second of these factors, the Commission 
explained that “[r]epetition of and persistent focus on sexual or 
excretory material have been cited consistently as factors that 
exacerbate the potential offensiveness of broadcasts. In con-
trast, where sexual or excretory references have been made 
once or have been passing or fleeting in nature, this character-
istic has tended to weigh against a finding of indecency.”
* * * * *
B 
It was against this regulatory background that the three inci-
dents of alleged indecency at issue here took place. 
* * * * *
II 
A fundamental principle in our legal system is that laws which 
regulate persons or entities must give fair notice of conduct 
that is forbidden or required. . . . This requirement of clarity in 
regulation is essential to the protections provided by the Due 
Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. . . . It requires the in-
validation of laws that are impermissibly vague. . . . 
 
Even when speech is not at issue, the void for vagueness 
doctrine addresses at least two connected but discrete due pro-
cess concerns: first, that regulated parties should know what is 
required of them so they may act accordingly; second, precision 
and guidance are necessary so that those enforcing the law do 
not act in an arbitrary or discriminatory way. When speech is 
involved, rigorous adherence to those requirements is neces-
sary to ensure that ambiguity does not chill protected speech.
 
These concerns are implicated here because . . . the 
broadcasters claim they did not have, and do not have, suffi-
cient notice of what is proscribed. . . . Under the 2001 Guide-
lines in force when the broadcasts occurred, a key 
consideration was “’whether the material dwell[ed] on or 
repeat[ed] at length’” the offending description or depiction. 
613 F.3d, at 322. In the 2004 Golden Globes Order, issued after 
the broadcasts, the Commission changed course and held that 
360  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  361
fleeting expletives could be a statutory violation. Fox I, 556 
U.S., at 512. In the challenged orders now under review the 
Commission applied the new principle promulgated in the 
Golden Globes Order and determined fleeting expletives and a 
brief moment of indecency were actionably indecent. This 
regulatory history, however, makes it apparent that the Com-
mission policy in place at the time of the broadcasts gave no 
notice to Fox or ABC that a fleeting expletive or a brief shot of 
nudity could be actionably indecent; yet Fox and ABC were 
found to be in violation. The Commission’s lack of notice to Fox 
and ABC that its interpretation had changed so the fleeting 
moments of indecency contained in their broadcasts were a 
violation of § 1464 as interpreted and enforced by the agency 
“fail[ed] to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice 
of what is prohibited.” Williams, supra, at 304.
* * * * *
 
The Commission failed to give Fox or ABC fair notice prior 
to the broadcasts in question that fleeting expletives and mo-
mentary nudity could be found actionably indecent.
 
Therefore, the Commission’s standards as applied to these 
broadcasts were vague, and the Commission’s orders must be 
set aside.

The judgments of the United States Court of Appeals for 
the Second Circuit are vacated, and the cases are remanded.
Questions
1.  Following the Fox I Supreme Court decision in 2009, the case 
went back down to the Second Circuit Court of  Appeals, 
which ruled that the entire FCC indecency policy was un-
constitutional. What constitutional infirmity did the Second 
Circuit cite in striking down the indecency policy?  Explain.
 
Did the Supreme Court in Fox II agree with the Second Cir-
cuit Court of Appeals that the FCC indecency policy was 
unconstitutional in its entirety? Explain.
2. When would an agency ruling be considered “arbitrary or 
capricious?”
3. Balancing First Amendment considerations (not addressed 
by the Supreme Court in the Fox II case) with concerns 
about the social effects of indecent language and behav-
ior, what policy do you personally think the FCC should fol-
low in regulating “fleeting expletives” like those uttered on 
television by Cher and Nicole Richie? Explain.
4. In commenting on the ongoing indecency debate, The New 
York Times argued: “The Supreme Court . . . should end all 
government regulations on the content of broadcasts. 
Technological change has undermined any justification for 
limiting the First Amendment rights of broadcast media 
outlets but not others.”40
Explain what the Times meant about technology eliminating 
the need for government oversight of broadcasting content.
The FCC and Indecency Today
We seem to be in the midst of a cultural war over social values, none of which is more 
hotly contested than the public role of sex in American life. Most famously, perhaps, Janet 
Jackson’s “wardrobe malfunction” (when her right breast was momentarily bared during 
the halftime show of the 2004 Super Bowl) led to a $550,000 FCC fine levied against CBS 
television. In 2011, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the fine, calling the FCC 
action was “arbitrary and capricious” in that it was an unexplained departure from the 
agency’s longtime tolerance of fleeting indecency.41 The Supreme Court declined to re-
view that decision42 and the eight-year exposed breast saga came to an end. Supreme Court 
Chief Justice Roberts, however, reminded us that the courts’ detailed examination of the 
FCC indecency policy has clarified some aspects of the law such that similar episodes may 
be subject to future penalties:
It is now clear that the brevity of an indecent broadcast—be it word or image—cannot 
 immunize it from FCC censure. Any future “wardrobe malfunctions” will not be protected 
on the ground relied on by the cou rt below.43
 
As noted in Fox II, FCC rules forbid indecent materials on conventional broadcast ser-
vices between 6 am and 10 pm—hours when children are likely to be in the audience. The 

362  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
10 pm to 6 am slot, on the other hand, offers a “safe harbor” for indecent programming. 
The rules do not reach subscription services such as programming delivered via satellite 
and cable services.
 
The safe harbor hours are straightforward. Fox II and other cases have brought deeper 
understanding to the notice and due process elements of FCC practice. The Supreme Court, 
however, will likely need to revisit the First Amendment issues that were avoided in Fox I 
and Fox II. Parents and other critics favor sterner broadcast oversight as exemplified in the 
fleeting expletives/nudity situations whereas the broadcast industry and civil liberties ad-
vocates prefer generous room for expression in the media along with aggressive defense of 
First Amendment free speech standards.
Fines for indecency can reach as high as $325,000 per violation. 
That stiff penalty along with the FCC’s broadly drawn indecency 
standards have caused some stations to refrain from broadcasting 
shows with profanity, such as the acclaimed movie, Saving Private 
Ryan. Critics worry that FCC rules, designed to protect viewers—particularly children—
may have a “chilling effect” on the free flow of ideas that is so vital to the nation’s politi-
cal, cultural, and economic health.
 
At this writing in 2013, the FCC is reviewing its indecency policies and enforcement to 
ensure compliance with First Amendment principles. During the period of the review, the 
commission is pursuing only “egregious” indecency cases. The FCC solicited comments 
from the public about its indecency policy, specifically including whether fleeting exple-
tives and brief, nonsexual nudity should be actionable. [For continuing analysis of broad-
cast law, see www.broadcastlawblog.com] 
Fines for indecency can reach 
as high as $325,000.
Parents’ Duty?
Caroline Fredrickson explained the American Civil Liberties Union’s objections to close 
government oversight of broadcasting:
Congress should reject any proposals that would allow the FCC to regulate what the 
public sees on television. Members of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) 
strongly believe that the government should not replace parents as  decision makers 
in America’s living rooms. There are some things the government does well, but 
deciding what is aired on television, and when, is not one of them. Parents already 
have many tools to protect their children, including blocking programs and chan-
nels, changing the channel, or (my personal favorite) turning off the television. . . . 
Our concern is that imposing standards for television programming would be un-
constitutional and damage important values that define America: the right to free 
speech, and the right of parents to decide the upbringing of their children.
Questions
1. Can we realistically expect parents to be able to fully shield their children from  indecent 
broadcasting?
2. Should parents do so? Explain.

Questions—Part Three
1. The Parents Television Council filed 36 indecency complaints with the FCC alleging 
that popular television shows, including Friends and The Simpsons, contained indecent 
scenes that were either sexually explicit or used indecent or profane language. How 
would you vote on the following scenes?
a. In the Gilmore Girls, one character says to another, “You’re a dick.”
b. In The Simpsons, students carry picket signs with the phrases “What would Jesus 
glue?” and “Don’t cut off my pianissimo.”
2. The Parents Television Council contacted sponsors of the April 6, 2005, episode of the 
television program The Shield to complain about a “graphic” scene in which a police 
captain was forced to perform fellatio on a gang member at gunpoint. Kia and Castrol 
were among those sponsors. What would you do if you were in charge of advertising for 
Kia or Castrol, and you received that complaint?
3. Cable television operators use signal scrambling to ensure that only paying customers 
have access to some programming. Congress was concerned that some sexually explicit 
cable programming, even though scrambled, might reach children via signal  “bleeding.” 
Section 505 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 required cable operators to fully 
block sexually oriented channels or to “time channel”—that is, transmit only in hours 
when children are unlikely to be viewing. Most cable operators adopted the latter 
 approach, with the result that for two-thirds of the day no viewers in the operators’ 
 service areas could receive the sexually explicit programming. Section 504 of the 
 Telecommunications Act required cable operators to block undesired channels at 
 individual households on request. A supplier of sexually oriented programming 
 challenged Section 505 on First Amendment grounds. Decide the case. Explain. See 
United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, 529 U.S. 803 (2000).
Part Four—The Federal Regulatory Process Evaluated
Free market advocates want to sharply reduce government, while free market skeptics 
 favor an activist government engaged in preventing and correcting market failure. At this 
writing, President Obama and the Democratic Party have elevated the role of the federal 
government in American life in an effort to correct problems they believe the market cannot 
successfully address. Republicans and Tea Party activists, on the 
other hand, have angrily resisted what they see as an overreaching 
government intruding in matters such as education and energy 
 policy better left to local communities and the market. They believe 
the federal government spent so much money stimulating the failing 
economy and bailing out big banks, car manufacturers, and others 
that the fiscal health of the nation is at risk.
 
The resulting political war has been powerfully projected to the populace through the de-
bate over the 2010 national health care reform law, the Patient  Protection and Affordable 
Care Act (Obamacare). As noted, the Affordable Care Act cleared a big hurdle in withstand-
ing constitutional challenges, but its likely effectiveness is unclear at this writing. 
Republicans and Tea Party 
activists have angrily  resisted 
what they see as an 
 overreaching government.

364  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
The  government projects Obamacare to reduce the total number of uninsured American resi-
dents from 53 million to 30 million and to significantly contain costs. Critics, on the other 
hand, forecast big increases in insurance premiums, doctors retiring early or reducing the ir 
hours, and employers dropping health care coverage. Certainly Obamacare raises new finan-
cial questions for employers. The Affordable Care Act requires companies with 50 or more 
full-time employees to pay a penalty if they do not provide health care coverage for their 
full-time employees (defined as those working at least 30 hours per week). Some organiza-
tions reportedly are cutting employees’ hours to avoid the law’s requirements, but a 2013 
survey found nearly 90 percent of employers do not intend to shift workers from full-time to 
part-time and most companies intend to maintain coverage for their full-time workers.44
TARP
Fearing the collapse of the American economy, the Bush administration in 2008 and the 
Obama administration thereafter loaned over $400 billion in government money to giant 
banks such as Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, insurance colossus AIG, General Motors, 
Chrysler, and many others, large and small. Although much of the Troubled Asset Relief 
Program (TARP) money has been repaid, taxpayers are still expected to lose as much 
$25 billion when the program is eventually concluded. Many financial leaders continue to 
believe the intervention was necessary to save those companies, though free-market advo-
cates are unconvinced. They think TARP subjected the marketplace to a dangerous moral 
hazard; an economics argument claiming that an individual or business that is protected 
from risk (by government intervention, in this case) will increase its risk-taking behavior 
in the  future in the belief that a bailout will follow, if needed. That 
is, if these giant firms are “too big to fail” as federal decision mak-
ers  apparently believed, they will in the future be able to operate in 
less disciplined ways because they can assume, based on the TARP experience, that they 
will be  rescued if necessary for the country’s welfare.
Financial Reform
Concluding that the financial markets needed more effective and thorough oversight in light 
of the nation’s near crash, Congress and President Obama in 2010 approved the Dodd–
Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act to improve America’s  financial 
regulatory structure. Dodd–Frank is primarily directed to large financial institutions whereas 
smaller, community banks are exempt from many of its provisions. As perhaps its chief 
goal, the new law is designed to prevent “systemic risks,”  financial collapses that would 
threaten the entire economy. Toward that objective, a 15-member Financial Stability Over-
sight Council headed by the Secretary of the Treasury monitors the health of the entire U.S. 
financial system. Banks are required to maintain larger capital holdings in order to reduce 
risky lending, provide funds for emergencies, and make becoming dangerously large a less 
attractive direction. Big financial companies must create and update “funeral plans” to pro-
vide for their own quick and orderly shutdown in the event of financial failure. Those 
changes and others seek to prevent a recurrence of the recent collapse that arguably left 
taxpayers with little choice but to bail out failing financial giants. The act also reforms mort-
gage lending practices in an effort to ensure that borrowers actually have the wherewithal to 
repay. The enormous bill (more than 2,300 pages) has many more provisions, including the 
“Too big to fail.”

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  365
creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (see Chapter 15), other mortgage re-
forms, increased oversight of derivatives and hedge funds, new rules for credit rating agen-
cies, a larger shareholder voice in executive pay decisions, and limits (under the so-called 
Volcker Rule) on the amount of a bank’s own assets that can be used for some risky forms 
of proprietary trading (investing the firm’s own money rather than that of its clients).
 
At this writing, more than three years after the enactment of Dodd–Frank, many of its 
provisions have yet to be implemented. Federal regulators are slowly creating new rules, 
and lobbyists for the banking industry and philosophical opposition from free-market poli-
ticians are challenging those rules and restraining funding. Critics believe Dodd–Frank 
threatens small business and consumers by raising borrowing costs and limiting services 
while giving too much power to government.
 
Notwithstanding those complaints about excessive government, many political leaders 
and economists believe Dodd–Frank does not do enough to address its central concern: the 
stability of the American banking system. Six giant firms—Bank of America, Citigroup, 
Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo—hold about 
$9.6  trillion in assets, equal to over 62 percent of the American gross domestic product (up 
from about 14 percent for the six biggest banks in 1994).45 Liberals see the big banks as the 
product of unrestrained capitalism and excessive lobbying power whereas many conserva-
tives also oppose the big banks because they see them as the product of big government 
cronyism and government safety nets (see the aforementioned moral hazard discussion ). 
Of course, the banking industry and many experts believe big banks are necessary to 
achieve big deals in a global economy, and they fear that China might well replace the 
United States as the world’s financial leader if the big banks are downsized.
Bigger Government?
Until the recent subprime mortgage crisis and our ongoing recession, the United States had 
been in a period, since the late 1970s, of deregulation, during which great efforts were 
made to reduce the role of government in big portions of American life. Once tightly con-
trolled industries, energy, transportation, and telecommunications were substantially re-
turned to market forces. The results often included lower prices and increased innovation. 
Republicans and Democrats alike generally embraced the idea that greater efficiency, com-
petitiveness, and freedom would accompany reduced government oversight. Of course, 
government authority remained enormous, and “sensible regulations” in workplace safety, 
the environment, equal opportunity, and consumer protection persisted and often grew. 
Broadly, in the 40 years or so prior to the 2008 economic crisis, there was a decline in 
government efforts to manage some sectors of the economy, accompanied by an increase 
in government efforts to manage social issues such as discrimination and clean air— 
problems the market didn’t seem to be satisfactorily addressing.
 
Now, as we have seen, the threat of a banking collapse and economic chaos for America 
and the world has generated a resurgence in federal economic intervention. Obamacare, 
Dodd–Frank,  and very aggressive Federal Reserve and Treasury Department  policies have 
brought squarely to the attention of the American people the crucial but  divisive question 

366  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
of just how much government we need in our lives. Are our lives excessively regulated or 
insufficiently regulated? Or are government regulations too often ineffective? Consider the 
evidence that follows.
I. Excessive Regulation
In brief, the excessive regulation argument is that government rules reduce business effi-
ciency, curb freedom, and unjustly redistribute resources while expanding the government 
bureaucracy and the taxes/borrowing that fund it. 
 
The Federal Register, the daily journal of federal rules (both final and proposed) along 
with presidential orders, totaled more than 82,000 pages, near records, in 2010 and 2011, 
before falling back to just over 77,000 pages in 2012.46 The conservative American Action 
Forum estimated that about 87 million worker hours (a year’s work for about 43,000 full-
time employees) were required to complete the 2012 paperwork burdens associated with 
the federal government’s rules. 47
 
Federal government civilian employees total about 1.9 million, and a new study sug-
gests those people are paid about $8,000 more annually in salary and about $30,000 more 
annually in benefits than their private sector equivalents.48 (Critics say the study failed to 
properly match job categories and that federal employees are generally better educated and 
older than those in the private sector.)
[For a Cato Institute video, “There Are Too Many Bureaucrats and They Are Paid Too 
Much,” see www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xzd3puYmiM]
 
Perhaps the biggest risk from excessive government is slower economic growth and 
fewer jobs. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce argues that the threat of ever-growing regula-
tions brings such uncertainty to the economy that businesses simply decline to invest out 
of fear that government might impose costly, new rules at any time. The Chamber pointed 
to the $1.8 trillion in cash reserves held by American businesses in 2010 and said: 
 “Businesses are reacting by sitting on capital, afraid to invest or hire.”49 [For an array of 
conservative analyses of tax issues, see www.atr.org. For more detailed criticisms of the 
federal regulatory process, see www.heritage.org or http://cei.org or www.cato.org
/pubs/regulation]
Shrink Big Government?
Given the enormous costs involved and the long-term threat of too much government, 
Americans routinely plead for lower taxes and smaller government, but when it comes to 
actually cutting specific programs that benefit them, sentiments change dramatically. A 
2010 poll found 57 percent of respondents uncomfortable with raising the Social Security 
retirement age to 69 over the next 60 years. About 70 percent resisted cuts to Medicare, 
Social Security, and defense. Peter Hart, a codirector of the poll said: “Everybody wants 
to cut the deficit and cut the spending. But at the end of the day, everybody wants a choice 
that doesn’t affect their well-being.”

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  367
II. Insufficient Regulation
Relentless change and our continuing search for justice mean that new rules are inevitable. 
 Responding, for example, to consumer anxiety over food hazards, Congress and President 
Obama in late 2010 approved the Food Safety Modernization Act, the first big upgrade in 
federal food safety requirements in 70 years (for more, see Chapter 15). Advocates of 
 increased regulation point to the many successes of government intervention: a vast high-
way network, legal equality for minorities and women, cleaner air, safer workplaces, 
greatly diminished child labor, enhanced auto safety, and so on.
Does government intervention pay off? Free market advocates 
say “no” in many instances, but some powerful numbers and re-
spected opinions say “yes.” The federal Office of Management 
and Budget’s 2013 draft “Report to Congress on the Benefits and 
Costs of Federal Regulations” found that the estimated annual benefits of major federal 
rules reviewed by the OMB for which data were available from 2002 to 2012 totaled 
 between $193 billion and $800 billion whereas the estimated costs were between 
$57  billion and $84 billion.50 Legendary investor Warren Buffet weighed in enthusiasti-
cally in a 2010 New York Times letter to “Uncle Sam” applauding what he viewed as a 
necessary and highly successful federal government intervention to save the financial 
markets in 2008 and thereafter. Buffet reminded readers of the economic meltdown the 
nation faced, the giant banks that were teetering, the major industrial companies that 
were running out of money and the millions of Americans whose prosperity was at risk. 
The threat was enormous, as Buffet saw it, and he judged the government to have pro-
vided the proper remedy:
So, again, Uncle Sam, thanks to you and your aides. Often you are wasteful, and 
 sometimes you are bullying. On occasion, you are downright maddening. But in this 
 extraordinary emergency, you came through—and the world would look far different now 
if you had not.51
 
Does regulation actually harm economic growth in America? Considerable evi-
dence suggests that fear is not convincing. For example, the federal Bureau of Labor 
Statistics asks employers why they have laid off workers. In 2010, only 0.3 percent of 
those laid off lost their jobs because of government regulation or intervention.52 A 
Washington Post overview of economists’ judgments as to the effect of regulations on 
job loss found generally that those effects were “minimal.”53 More broadly, the World 
Bank’s 2013 “Doing Business” report placed the United States fourth highest in the 
world in the ease of doing business, ranking behind only Singapore, Hong Kong, and 
New Zealand.54
III. Ineffective Regulation
Just as the market can fail, so can the regulatory system. The sources of that regulatory 
failure are multiple, but one problem is highlighted in a recent Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) report detailing duplication of tasks in the federal government. 
According to the report, 15 different agencies oversee food safety, 80 programs ad-
dress economic development, 82 programs improve teacher quality, 56 help people 
Does government 
 intervention pay off?

368  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
understand finances, and so on.55 Critics further charge that the regulatory process is 
 corrupted by familiar bureaucratic problems including inefficiency, incompetence, 
low productivity, and inconsistent policy enforcement. Of course, the problem of regu-
latory capture, explained earlier in this  chapter, can play a powerful role in ineffectual 
regulation as Jacob Laksin explains in  reviewing Timothy Carney’s book The Big 
Ripoff:
Another myth—debunked by Mr. Carney—holds that regulations are the scourge of 
the  business world. In fact, as he argues, many top companies welcome these rules. 
The airline industry sees burdensome federal oversight as a means of discouraging 
upstart competition. Tobacco giant Philip Morris is only too happy to submit to 
 government curbs on advertising, confident that the effect is to keep smaller,  lesser-known 
 manufacturers on the margins, to the benefit of its already famous  Marlboro, Merit, and 
other brands.56
Your Life: $7 Million?
How much is a life worth? That question is probably the crucial cost–benefit inquiry. 
When imposing new environmental or car safety rules, for example, we are forced to 
think about how much money we should spend to save an additional life. Recently, lead-
ing scholar Kip Viscusi and colleagues put a $7 to $8 million value on human life based 
on what we are willing to pay to save an average American life. (In 2010, the FDA val-
ued a life at $7.9 million, while the EPA put the figure at $9.1 million.)
 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has announced that it 
will recommend the inclusion of rear-view video systems in new cars. New rules were 
called for by Congress in the 2008 Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act. 
The law was named after a two-year-old boy who was killed in the family driveway when 
his father accidentally backed over him. According to NHTSA, backover accidents cause 
an average of 229 deaths and more than 18,000 injuries per year, most involving those 
under 5 or over 70. NHTSA  estimates the rule would save 95 to 112 lives per year and 
prevent 7,000 to 8,000 injuries at a cost of about $11.8 million per life saved. The cost 
would range from $159 to $203 per vehicle or somewhat less if the vehicle is already 
equipped with a display screen, but often the safety features are available only as part of 
more expensive option packages.

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  369
Further Deregulation or Reregulation?
Financial Services
The near collapse of America’s banking system in 2008 offers a superb “test case” to 
 examine the “What Went Wrong?” question posed by The Washington Post:
How did the world’s markets come to the brink of collapse? Some say regulators failed.
Other claim deregulation left them handcuffed. Who’s right? Both are. . . .57
The federal government’s Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission’s study of the financial 
collapse pointed to an array of problems including ineffective government oversight; 
 corporate governance failures; reckless borrowing; lending and investment practices; 
 ethical failures, an unregulated financial derivatives market, and failures in the credit  rating 
agencies (e.g., Fitch Ratings, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s). [For the Commission’s 
report, see http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/]
 
Doubtless many factors contributed to the meltdown, but our primary concern is the  issue of 
market and ethical failure and the resulting need for government intervention. Did the  market 
and self-regulation (ethics and social responsibility) fail? 
 Unsurprisingly, free-market advocates say the  market  performed well. 
They blame the subprime problems on government  intervention, 
 especially easy credit policies designed to  extend home ownership to as many as possible, with 
reduced attention to ability to pay.58 Critics of the free market on the other hand say that de-
regulation was a big factor in the  collapse. For 30 years prior to the  meltdown, the  government 
gradually diminished its oversight of the banking industry in an  effort to allow the market a 
greater voice and to render  American banks more competitive in the global  market. Most prom-
inently  perhaps, the 1933  Glass–Steagall Act was partially  repealed in 1999, thus allowing a 
mingling of commercial and investment banks. In total, the regulatory walls separating com-
mercial banks, investment banks, brokerage firms, insurance, and commodities trading came 
down, giant “financial supermarkets” emerged, and risky investing arguably grew.59
The financial crisis shattered the confidence of some staunch 
free market advocates including former Federal Reserve chair, Alan 
Greenspan, who acknowledged, in 2009, a “breakdown” in self- 
regulation.60 Testifying before Congress, he said:
I made a mistake in presuming that the self-interests of organizations, 
specifically banks and others, were such as that they were best capable 
of protecting their own shareholders and their equity in the firms.61
Whether the market failed or not, we should note general agreement that the government 
failed in its oversight responsibilities. As former Securities and Exchange Commission 
chair, Republican Chris Cox, said: “The last six months (of the financial crisis) have made 
it abundantly clear that voluntary regulation does not work.”62
Regulatory Virtue
Historian John Steele Gordon argues that capitalism needs regulation and that regulation 
has made the country more stable and richer:
Capitalism without regulation and regulators is inherently unstable, Gordon claims, “as 
 people will usually put their short-term interests ahead of the interests of the system as a 
whole, and either chaos or plutocracy will result. . . . The country since the New Deal has 
been a far richer, far more economically secure, far more just society.”63
Did the market fail?
Alan Greenspan 
 acknowledged a “breakdown” 
in  self-regulation.

370  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
The Winner: The Mixed Economy?
Economist and columnist Sebastian Mallaby argues that we should acknowledge a role for 
both the market and government in our mixed economy and recognize that the American 
people will continue to demand more and more from the government (security from 
 criminals and terrorists, clean air, safe food, good schools, and so on).64 Indeed, he argues 
that those public goods in our prosperous society probably matter more than private pleas-
ures such as DVDs and fancy vacations. As a result, government will likely be under great 
pressure to spend more, but we should also “be ruthless about making government and 
markets more efficient.” 65
Young People?
What does the future hold for big government in America? Is Mallaby right that the market 
and government working together are necessary for success in tomorrow’s America? The 
New York Times in 2013 took an interesting look at those questions by interviewing young 
people in the Montana college town of Missoula, a majority of whom see government as a 
constructive force:
Young people absolutely believe that there’s a role for government,” said Matt Singer, a 
founder of Forward Montana. “At the same time, this is not a generation of socialists. They 
are highly entrepreneurial, and know that some of what it takes to create an environment 
where they can do their own exciting, creative things is having basic systems that work.66
According to a Pew Research Center survey, under-30 voters are “the only age group in 
which a majority said the government should do more to fix problems.”67 What role do you 
see for government in your life? Do you think big government is an impediment to your 
happy, prosperous future? Or do you view government as a natural, necessary ally of the 
market?
God Up; Government Down
How much government do we need in our lives? Our answers to this important question 
apparently depend, in part, on our view of God. The Baylor (University) Religion Survey, 
conducted by the Gallup Poll in 2011, found that people who strongly believe “God has a 
plan for me” were much more likely to also believe that “the government does too much.” 
Those people, according to the survey, tend to earn less and to be less educated than those 
who do not believe God has a plan for them. Sociologist Paul Froese, coauthor of the 
study, says the strong believers see the invisible hand of the free market as God at work. 
Those who do not believe in God or who believe God to be more removed from daily af-
fairs tend to be more supportive of government.

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  371
Global Regulation
We should remember that regulation in the United States remains modest relative to the 
balance of the globe. Even though the cost of regulation in the United States is great, gov-
ernment rules are, in fact, less burdensome in America than in most nations. The  Washington 
Post in 2013 reported the critics’ view that France is “drowning in rules and regulations,”68 
and The New York Times in 2012 applied the word abysmal to Greece’s climate for doing 
business while citing a McKinsey & Company study that found start-ups in Greece facing 
“immense amounts of red tape, complex administrative and tax systems and procedural 
disincentives.”69 The global trend, however,  seems to be toward more sensible rules. The 
2013 World Bank Doing Business 2013 report found that significant progress has been 
made in the last 10 years in improving business regulatory practices around the globe. 
Since 2005, the average time to start a business has fallen from 50 to 30 days.70
 
We should also understand that regulation, particularly in the banking sector, is an in-
creasingly cooperative, international process recognizing the value of cutting global red 
tape while also acknowledging the necessity of firm r ules to maintain a healthy global 
economy and prevent future financial crises. The big industrial nations, at this writing, are 
phasing in new measures (labeled Basel III) to promote global finan-
cial stability. At the center of those rules are increased capital ade-
quacy standards that basically require banks to hold 7 percent of 
certain core assets in reserve with the biggest, most deeply interconnected banks being re-
quired to hold up to 10.5 percent. Those reserve funds are meant to both discourage risk 
taking and to be available for use if a crisis occurs. At this writing in 2013, the United States 
is still writing its rules to comply with Basel III. Big banks around the world have made 
progress in building their capital reserves, but objections to Basel III have mounted, imple-
mentation has been slow, and the “too big to fail” problem clearly remains unsolved.
Two Concluding Cases
Let’s close this chapter about government rules by asking if we should have more of them.
Case I. FDA Ban on Menthol Cigarettes?
At this writing, the federal Food and Drug  Administration (see Chapter 15) is considering 
whether it should forbid the use of menthol as a flavoring in cigarette products. All other 
flavored cigarettes were previously banned by the FDA. Antismoking groups say about 
80 percent of black smokers prefer the menthol variety. In general, black smokers have the 
highest rates of smoking-related diseases. Critics also say that menthol cigarettes are par-
ticularly appealing to young people because the flavoring causes a cooling sensation in the 
mouth and hides the harsh cigarette taste. One study found that 45 percent of smokers aged 
12 to 17 used menthol brands. The FDA in 2013 concluded that menthol cigarettes proba-
bly pose a greater health risk than standard brands because their flavoring facilitates addic-
tion and makes quitting harder.
 
Lorillard, maker of Newport, is leading the fight against a ban. Lorillard wants to 
protect the growing popularity of Newport, which accounts for 13 percent of cigarette 
Basel III

372  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
sales. Lorillard has pointed to the thousands of jobs that are at stake, and the company 
argues that a ban would result in a large unregulated black market for the cigarettes. 
Lorillard also disputes the claim that menthol cigarettes pose greater medical risks than 
other  varieties.
Question
1. The website “Hot Air” thinks the government should not intervene in the menthol ciga-
rette market:
Once again, we have the federal government acting as nanny rather than allowing adults to 
make their own decisions. No one forces people to use tobacco products, after all, and we 
have literally spent decades educating people about the dangers. . . .71
 
What do you think the government should do? Explain.

 Journal, January 5, 2011, p. A1.
Case II. Cell Phones: A Deadly Distraction?
Nearly 70 percent of young drivers text behind the wheel and 48 percent admit to access-
ing the Web while driving.72 The federal Department of Transportation reported that 3,331 
people died in distraction-related crashes in 2011.73 Research at the University of Utah 
found that cell phone conversation is a much more dangerous distraction than passenger 
conversation.74 A  Houston Chronicle editorial argued for measures to curb driving 
while using a cell phone:
Even a cursory glance at the statistics is evidence enough that swift, comprehensive action 
must be taken on a national level to curb this reckless, potentially deadly, behavior: Driving 
while using a cell phone incurs a fourfold greater risk of crashing, equivalent to driving 
while drunk (with a 0.08 blood-alcohol level). For texters, the risk is eight times greater. A 
 recent study by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, which videotaped truck drivers 
over 18 months, showed that texting made them 23 times more likely to crash or narrowly 
avoid a crash.75
 
No state forbids all cell phone use while driving, but 39 ban text messaging for all driv-
ers, and 10 states forbid all drivers from using handheld cell phones while driving.76 Are 
these restraints effective? The evidence shows little, if any, reduction in cell phone use 
while driving, despite mounting evidence of the dangers. Of course, the real problem may 
be distractions of all kinds, but survey results find 96 percent of Americans agreeing that 
cell phone use should not be permitted while driving.77

a.  Would you favor government rules forbidding cell phone use while driving? Explain.
 
b. What about text messaging, grooming, eating, and so on? Explain.
2. Technology companies are rapidly bringing powerful information technology to car 
dashboards. Government regulators argue that those products are slowing their efforts 
to reduce hazards from distracted driving. According to National Transportation Safety 
Board chair, Deborah Hersman:
If the technology producers focused more on what is safe than what sells, we’d see highway 
fatalities go down.79
 
Do you agree that technology companies are irresponsibly putting profit before safety in 
developing ever more advanced, and doubtless distracting, technology in cars? Explain.
3. Distinguished economist Herbert Stein, perhaps best known as father of celebrity Ben 
Stein, said that we are desperate for cell phone conversations to ward off our loneliness:
It is the way of keeping contact with someone, anyone who will reassure you that you are not 
alone. You may think you are checking on your portfolio but deep down you are checking on 
your own existence.80
 
a. Are you dependent on your cell phone?
 
b.  If so, should the government discourage that use by, for example, imposing higher 
taxes on cell phone purchases? Explain.

 6. At this writing in 2013, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the 
primary governing body for college athletics, is in the midst of a heated debate about 
proposals for deregulating NCAA oversight practices. A primary area of concern in-
volves the detailed set of rules currently governing the recruiting of high school ath-
letes. The NCAA proposes reducing those rules by, for example, allowing schools to 
make an unrestricted number of phone calls and texts to recruits, allowing any staff 
member (not just coaches) to contact recruits and permitting schools to send unlimited 
print material to recruits.
 
  
Many coaches oppose the changes. Northwestern University head football coach 
Pat Fitzgerald actually favored greater regulation:
The term that makes the hair stand up on the back of my neck is “deregulate.” The ques-
tion we should be asking is how can we re-regulate, get up to the 21st century and make 
best practices in recruiting for all those involved.84

 7. Although frustrating and imperfect, government regulation often leads to better lives. 
We notice, for example, that seat belt use in 2012 reached a record high with 86 per-
cent of motorists buckled up as compared with 58 percent in 199485, and we know that 
smoking bans have directly and quickly led to reductions in heart attacks and other 
ailments.86 “Fracking” technology necessary to our current natural gas drilling boom 
was significantly propelled by more than $100 million in government subsidies and 
much more in tax breaks.87 Given those successes and many others, do we need more 
aggressive government intervention in America’s endangered family life? At first 
glance, most Americans would probably say “no,” but a 2012 University of Virginia 
(UVA) study argued that government intervention is needed to restore the institution 
of marriage among the 60 percent of our population that does not have a college edu-
cation. In the 1980s, about 13 percent of American children were born outside of mar-
riage; now that number is about 44 percent. The UVA study estimates the cost to 
taxpayers at over $100 billion annually when stable families do not develop.88 The 
study suggests, among other things, various tax and welfare policy changes to encour-
age marriage. 
 
  
Is marriage a private and personal affair that should be left free of further govern-
ment intervention? Explain. [For more information, see stateofourunions.org]
 8. The expense of government regulation is not limited to the direct cost of administering 
the various agencies. Explain and offer examples of the other expenses produced by 
regulation.
 9. To the extent the federal government achieves deregulation, what substitutes will citizens 
find for protection?
 10. Pulitzer Prize–winning author and presidential adviser Arthur Schlesinger:
The assault on the national government is represented as a disinterested movement to 
“return” power to the people. But the withdrawal of the national government does not 
transfer power to the people. It transfers power to the historical rival of the national 
 government and the prime cause of its enlargement—the great corporate interests.89
a. Using 19th- and 20th-century American economic history, explain Schlesinger’s 
claim that corporate interests are the primary cause of big government.
b. Do you agree with Schlesinger that we continue to need big government to counter-
act corporate interests and achieve fairness for all in American life? Explain.
 11. Make the argument that increasing government rules and jobs leads to decreasing 
 private-sector businesses and jobs.
 12. One authority estimates that obesity contributes to the deaths of 100,000 Americans annu-
ally.90 A strategy for reducing the health risks of obesity is to impose a tax on high calorie 
junk foods such as soda, donuts, and potato chips. Maine, for example, imposed a 5.5 per-
cent snack tax as a means of closing a budget gap, but that state’s adult obesity rate 

376  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
 doubled during the 10 years the tax was in place.91 Two-thirds of the states already  impose 
a tax (averaging 5.2 percent) on soft drinks, but for a 5-foot-10, 279-pound  person, the 
average weight loss associated with the tax has been about 3 ounces.92
a. What objections would you raise to increased taxes on junk food.
b. Would you support a significant tax, say, 25 percent, on junk food? Explain.
c. Would subsidies to lower the price of healthy food be a more effective strategy than 
taxes on unhealthy food? Explain.
 13. The British government spends about $340 per year per Briton on drug costs whereas 
the United States spends about $800 per year per American. As The Wall Street Journal 
reported, Great Britain is struggling to find ways to curb rocketing health care costs:
Millions of patients around the world have taken drugs introduced over the past decade 
to delay the worsening of Alzheimer’s disease. While the drugs offer no cure, studies 
suggest they work in some patients at least for a while. But this year, an arm of Britain’s 
government health-care system, relying on some economists’ number-crunching, said 
the benefit isn’t worth the cost. It issued a preliminary ruling calling on doctors to stop 
prescribing the drugs. The ruling highlighted one of the most disputed issues in medi-
cine today. If a treatment helps people, should governments and private insurers pay for 
it without question? Or should they first measure the benefit against the cost, and only 
pay if the cost-benefit ratio exceeds some preset standard?93
 
 Should the U.S. government and insurers employ cost-benefit calculations in deciding 
which illnesses and patients receive coverage? Explain.
 14. Joseph Stiglitz, the chief White House economist at the time, argued in 1996 that “a 
huge economic literature” supports his view that “appropriately circumscribed govern-
ment programs can lead to a higher-growth economy.”94 How can government 
 programs stimulate the economy rather than act as a drag on it?
 15. A major issue facing the Federal Aviation Administration is congestion in the airways 
caused by too many planes seeking to take off or land at peak times at high-demand 
airports. How might we solve that problem while maintaining reasonable service?
 16. In calculating the costs and benefits of a new rule, make the argument that added regu-
lation normally slows the economy and leads to increased deaths.
 17. Eighty-three percent of teens had at least one sunburn in 1999, whereas the compa-
rable figure in 1986 was 30 percent.95 “Right now, we’re at the apex of the ‘bronze 
goddess era,’” said Atoosa Rubenstein, editor-in-chief of CosmoGIRL magazine.96 
More than a third of the 17-year-old girls in a recent survey reported going to a tan-
ning salon in the previous year.97 In 2009 the International Agency for Research on 
Cancer classified tanning beds as Group 1 carcinogens, meaning the evidence is suf-
ficient for experts to conclude that the beds cause cancer.98 A scientific review of the 
tanning data found that the risk of melanoma increases by 75 percent if tanning beds 
and lamps are used prior to age 30.99 The American Academy of Dermatology As-
sociation (AADA) has urged the FDA to ban the sale and use of indoor tanning 
equipment for non-medical purposes and has called for state or federal laws to, 
among other things, forbid minors from using tanning devices. Do you support lim-
its on teen tanning?  Explain?

Chapter Eight  Government Regulation of Business  377
 18. A bipartisan coalition labeled “Mayors Against Illegal Guns” released a 2010 study 
finding that 43,000 of the guns confiscated at crimes scenes in 2009 came from out-of-
state gun dealers. Georgia, Virginia, West Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, and Alaska 
were among the largest gun exporters. States with strong restrictions export guns at 
only about one seventh the rate of those with lax rules. About 12,000 Americans 
 annually are murdered by guns.100 Commenting in The New York Times, columnist 
Nicholas Kristof said:
To protect the public, we regulate cars and toys, medicines and mutual funds. So, simply 
as a public health matter, shouldn’t we take steps to reduce the toll from our domestic 
arms industry?101
 
 Adam Lanza, 20, fatally shot 20 children and 6 school personnel at Sandy Hook 
 Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, on December 14, 2012. He also mur-
dered his mother and shot himself. Once again we ask ourselves what can be done to 
reduce gun violence. Do you think firmer gun regulations are needed? Explain.

Introduction
Against a backdrop of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s, 
this chapter provides a brief introduction to some of the fundamental laws governing 
 business—the types and characteristics of available business entities, key corporate 
 governance issues, and business access to capital.

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  383
 
From the outset we need to recognize the overlapping coverage of state and federal 
regulation of business. Historically, state law governed most issues—such as the creation 
of business entities, the powers and duties of management, and capital structure. Still 
 today, the laws that regulate a partnership, both among the partners and with outside 
 parties, are state laws; as are the laws that permit the creation of corporations, those under 
which limited liability companies (LLCs) have been allowed to form and those permitting 
numerous other business forms. The owners of a corporation are called stockholders or 
shareholders because the ownership interests are called shares of stock. The fundamental 
legal duties that corporations, corporate boards, and officers owe to their shareholders are 
defined by the state of incorporation. Over half of all publicly traded companies and more 
than 200,000 private firms are incorporated in Delaware.1 Thus, when state corporate law 
issues are discussed, the corporate law of Delaware often drives the discussion. Part One 
of this chapter will discuss the key characteristics under state law of the most common 
business entity forms.
Delaware Seeks Exclusive Jurisdiction
Delaware gen erates over a third of its total state revenue from taxes and fees related to 
corporate domicile, each corporation paying up to $180,000 annually. In 2013, over 
80 percent of all IPOs were by entities incorporated in that state.2  Whether Delaware’s 
primacy is related to its success in a race to the bottom or a race to the top, corporate man-
agement appreciates the state’s business-friendly Court of Chancery. In June 2013, that 
body upheld a bylaw restricting shareholder lawsuits to the Delaware courts. Many believe 
such bylaws are adopted to give management the “home-field advantage” in that states 
more sympathetic to shareholders are deprived of jurisdiction. Approximately 300 corpo-
rations now have this bylaw, with many more expected if the ruling stands on appeal.3
 
The first decade of the 21st century has been scarred by two systemic failures involving 
corporate actors and the capital markets. The first is commonly referenced by the 2001 
collapse of Enron (although that was not the largest of the corporate failures characterizing 
that era). The second was the financial crisis that struck in the fall of 2008 (which is often 
referenced by the collapse of Lehman Brothers). Contributing to both events were failures 
of corporate management. In each case, Congress responded with significant legislation 
that, in part, imposes additional requirements on the management of publicly held corpora-
tions (corporations with publicly traded shares). These federal laws are the Sarbanes– 
Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) and the Dodd–Frank Act of 2010 (see Chapter 8 also). Part Two 
of this chapter will discuss corporate governance issues specific to public corporations, 
including the relevant provisions of these two federal laws.
 
Part Three will take a closer look at how businesses are financed—particularly their ac-
cess to capital beyond the resources of the initial founders. Although state law plays a role 
here, federal regulation dominates. Triggered by the 1929 stock market crash and the con-
tinuing failure of the capital markets and banking system in the Great Depression of the 
1930s, the federal government, largely under its powers to regulate interstate commerce, 
created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate the securities markets. 

384  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
Part Three of this chapter will focus on federal regulation of the securities markets, includ-
ing relevant changes following the two financial crises of the last decade.
Part One—Business Entities and Their Defining Characteristics
One of the most significant decisions facing the founders of a business is the choice of a 
legal entity to house the business. Among other things, this decision will affect the legal 
relationships among the founders, the relationship between them, and the entity and be-
tween them and various third parties. It will also affect their access to outside capital and 
the tax treatment accorded business profits and losses. Thus, Part One outlines each of the 
principal choices available. It will conclude with a brief discussion of circumstances that 
might favor the use of one form over another, as well as a look at a few lesser-used forms 
and newly emerging forms.
 
 The three traditional business forms are corporations, partnerships, and sole 
 proprietorships. Partnerships and sole proprietorships are default forms. For example, if an 
individual starts a business and takes no active steps to house that business within an entity 
structure, the business will, by default, be classed as a sole proprietorship. Strictly speak-
ing, a sole proprietorship is not a business entity at all—the law treats the business and the 
individual as the same legal person. If, on the other hand, two or more persons join to-
gether to start the business and take no active steps to create an entity structure, the law 
will, again by default, classify the business as a partnership. The only way to establish a 
business as a corporation, or indeed as any of the other entities discussed in this part, is for 
its founders to take deliberate steps, specified by state law, to create the entity.
 
One such other entity is the LLC or limited liability company. An LLC is often referred 
to as a hybrid because it was specifically designed to combine various desired characteris-
tics of corporations with others of partnerships. Another hybrid form is known as a subchap-
ter S corporation, (also called sub-S or S corporations). For state corporate law purposes, it 
is a corporation like any other, but for federal (and most state) income tax purposes the legal 
entity is largely ignored and all of the business tax consequences instead flow through to the 
tax returns of the individual shareholders. This is similar, but not identical, to the way the 
tax consequences of a partnership flow through to the tax returns of individual partners.
 
If we set aside businesses run as sole proprietorships, today more businesses are housed 
in these two hybrid entities, LLCs and S corporations, than in the traditional corporate and 
partnership forms. Based on IRS data for 2010 (the latest data available), LLC returns in-
creased 250 percent from 2001 to 2.1 million, showing about $3 trillion in receipts. S cor-
porations filed 4.1 million returns reporting $6 trillion in revenue. “Traditional” 
corporations (also known as C corporations) filed only 1.7 million returns but were respon-
sible for $20 trillion in receipts.4 
 
Each of these forms will be evaluated below according to the following considerations:
 
Formation and nontax costs. The method of and costs related to bringing a business 
form into existence.
 
Management structure. The degree to which control is centralized in a hierarchical 
structure or is dispersed among owners.

Corporate Constitutional Rights?
Under state law, corporations are legal persons.6 This raises the question of whether 
 corporations have constitutionally protected rights. Over the years, the Supreme Court has 
held that corporations are sometimes entitled to constitutional protections7 and at other times 
not so entitled.8 As discussed in Chapter 1, the issue arose again in Citizens United v. Federal 
Election Com’n, 130 S.Ct. 876 (2010), in which the Court, over a strong dissent, enunciated 
a wide-reaching principle that “the Government may not suppress political speech on the 
basis of the speaker’s corporate identity.” Justice Stevens, with three others, dissented:
The real issue in this case concerns how, not if, [Citizens United] may finance its 
electioneering. Citizens United is a wealthy nonprofit corporation that runs a 
 political action committee (PAC) with millions of dollars in assets. Under [the 
 disputed law], it could have used those assets to televise and promote Hillary: The 
Movie wherever and whenever it wanted to. It also could have spent unrestricted 
sums to broadcast Hillary at any time other than the 30 days before the last 
 primary election. Neither Citizens United’s nor any other corporation’s speech has 
been “banned.” . . . In the context of election to public office, the distinction 
 between corporate and human speakers is significant. Although they make 
 enormous contributions to our society, corporations are not actually members of 
 
Limited liability. The extent to which business owners are personally liable for busi-
ness obligations.
 
Transferability of ownership interests. Whether the business owners can transfer 
their interests without state law restrictions.
 
Duration of existence. The events, including those impacting the business owners, 
which will end the business entity’s existence.
 
Taxes. The way each business form affects the income tax treatment of the business and 
its owners.
 
Capital structure. The impact of the business form on the organization’s ability to 
 access additional capital.

Corporations
Although only 19 percent of all business entities are C corporations, they account for 
67 percent of all business revenue. Together, C and S corporations represent 64 percent of 
all business entities and account for 87 percent of all business revenue.5 There are good 
reasons for their financial success, which will become evident in the discussion to follow.
 
Throughout this discussion, we must keep in mind two very different corporate reali-
ties: the public corporation and the closely held corporation (a corporation with relatively 
few shareholders, the stock of which has no readily available market).

it. They cannot vote or run for office. . . . The financial resources, legal structure, 
and instrumental orientation of corporations raise legitimate concerns about their 
role in the electoral process.
Question
When a corporation funds political speech, for whom is it speaking? Consider these 
 possibilities from the Citizens United majority and dissenting opinions:
[W]ealthy individuals and unincorporated associations can spend unlimited 
amounts on independent expenditures. Yet certain disfavored associations of citi-
zens—those that have taken on the corporate form—are penalized for  engaging 
in the same political speech. Citizens United, supra at 908 (majority opinion).
It is an interesting question “who” is even speaking when a business corpo-
ration places an advertisement that endorses or attacks a particular candidate. 
Presumably it is not the customers or employees, who typically have no say in 
such matters. It cannot realistically be said to be the shareholders, who tend to 
be far removed from the day-to-day decisions of the firm and whose political 
preferences may be opaque to management. Perhaps the officers or directors of 
the corporation have the best claim to be the ones speaking, except their fiduci-
ary duties generally prohibit them from using corporate funds for personal 
ends. Citizens United, supra at 972 (dissent).
Formation and Nontax Costs
To create a corporation, a promoter or incorporator files articles of incorporation with the state 
government. A modest fee is typically charged. The articles have mandatory  elements, such as 
the corporation’s name, the person designated to receive certain communications from the state 
(legal documents such as subpoenas), and a description of the stock the  corporation is permitted 
to issue. Discretionary content like voting rules may also appear in the articles.
 
Once the articles are filed the corporation comes into existence. An organizational 
meeting will then be held at which the initial members of the board of directors will be 
appointed by the incorporators (unless they were already designated in the articles). The 
board will then meet to undertake the corporation’s initial business. Among other things, it 
will appoint officers and adopt bylaws. Bylaws contain key policies and procedures, such 
as how meeting quorums will be determined and the percentage of shareholders that must 
approve major corporate actions like mergers. The issuance of stock will be authorized in 
exchange for contributions of capital, property, or services. [For a large library of business 
forms, see www.lectlaw.com/formb.htm]
 
At least annually the board of directors and shareholders must hold meetings and the 
corporation will have to make brief filings with the state to keep its records up-to-date, 
usually accompanied by a small fee. [To see how Delaware computes this fee, see www
.corp.delaware.gov/fee.shtml]
 
Corporations are separate accounting entities and need to establish books of account. 
The cost of their accounting systems, however, generally reflects their scale of operation, 
rather than the decision to operate in corporate form.

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  387
Selection and Protection of the Corporate Name
Articles of incorporation are filed in the name of the soon-to-be corporation. States require 
corporate names to be distinguishable from names already registered, so it is a good thing 
to check the state’s database in advance for the desired name and reserve it prior to filing 
the articles. Other steps an entrepreneur should consider include:
 
Trademark issues—Will someone sue to stop the use of the chosen name? Check with 
the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office database to see if the name has been trademarked. 
If it has, select a different name. It may be wise to protect the final name selected by 
registering it as a trademark [www.uspto.gov/trademarks/process/index.jsp].
 
Domain name—Do an Internet search on the selected corporate name. Is the name still 
available as a domain name? If yes, register it. If not, what name is available that will 
be effective for customers and others trying to find you? Will customers be confused by 
the website with your preferred domain name?
 
Fictitious name—If the domain name differs from the corporate name and will be used 
separately, it may be prudent to register it with the state as a fictitious name.
 
Doing business in other states—If business will be conducted in other states, the 
 business name database of those states should also be checked and the corporation reg-
istered as a foreign corporation in those states.

Management Structure
One strength of the corporate form, an attribute that has allowed it to become a very effective 
engine of economic growth, is its ability to separate ownership from management.  Shareholders 
contribute the capital that allows the business to be established. In exchange shareholders re-
ceive stock, each share of which represents an ownership unit. Annually, the shareholders meet 
to elect a board of directors. All corporate powers are exercised by or under the authority of the 
board for and on behalf of the shareholders. Typically, boards do not operate the business on a 
day-to-day basis. Rather, they are policy and oversight bodies. To actually run the company, 
boards appoint officers, often a CEO (chief executive officer) or president, secretary, CFO 
(chief financial officer) or treasurer, and several vice presidents. Officers are employees of the 
corporation and they hire the other employees needed to run the business. This hierarchy is 
 referred to as a centralized management structure. Keep in mind that a small corporation will 
likely have this same formal structure, but its operational dynamics may be quite different if, as 
is common, many of the same people who are shareholders are also directors and officers.
 
Both directors and officers have fiduciary duties to the corporation. A fiduciary is a person 
who acts on behalf of another (beneficiary) and is required to do so with great  integrity. 
 (Another fiduciary relationship is parent-to-minor child.) The duty of loyalty  requires a fiduci-
ary to act in the best interests of the beneficiary. This prohibits, for example, directors from 
authorizing the corporation to lease real estate from the board chairman unless the rental terms 
are consistent with the market. Directors and officers also owe the corporation a duty of due

FACTS
Shlensky, a minority stockholder in the Chicago Cubs, sued the 
directors on the grounds of mismanagement and negligence 
because of their refusal to install lights at Wrigley Field, then 
the only major league stadium without lights. One of the direc-
tors, Wrigley (80 percent owner), objected to lights because of 
his personal opinion that “baseball is a ‘daytime sport’ and 
that the installation of lights and night baseball games would 
have a deteriorating effect upon the surrounding neighbor-
hood.” The other directors deferred to Wrigley.
 
The Cubs were losing money. Shlensky attributed those 
losses to poor attendance and argued that without lights the 
losses would continue. His evidence was that the Chicago 
White Sox night games drew better than the Cubs’ day games. 
Shlensky sought damages and an order requiring lights and 
night games. He lost at trial and appealed.

Business Judgment Rule
What happens if the board or CEO makes a decision that causes the stock value to  decline 
by 30 percent? Has the duty of due care been violated? The judicial system has developed 
the business judgment rule to help make that determination. A good statement of the rule, 
which is explored in the Wrigley case below, is:
The rule posits a powerful presumption . . . that a decision made by a loyal and informed 
board will not be overturned . . . unless it cannot be “attributed to any rational business 
 purpose.” [The] shareholder . . . challenging a board decision [must] rebut the . . . presump-
tion [by] providing evidence that directors . . . breached any one of the triads of their fiduci-
ary duty–good faith, loyalty or due care. . . . If a shareholder . . . fails to meet this . . . burden, 
the . . . rule attaches to protect . . . officers and directors and the decisions they make, and 
our courts will not second-guess these business judgments.9

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  389
that the decision is one properly before the directors and the 
motives alleged . . . showed no fraud, illegality, or conflict of in-
terest in their making of that decision.
 
While all . . . courts do not insist that one or more of [these] 
three elements must be present for a stockholder’s derivative 
action to lie, nevertheless we feel that unless the conduct of 
the defendants at least borders on one of [them], the courts 
should not interfere. . . .
* * * * *
 
Finally, we do not agree . . . that failure to follow . . . the other 
major league clubs in scheduling night games constituted negli-
gence. [It] cannot be said that directors, even those of corpora-
tions that are losing money, must follow the lead of [others] in 
the field. Directors are elected for their business . . . judgment 
and the courts cannot require them to forgo their judgment 
 because of the decisions of directors of other companies.

AFTERWORD—DUTY OF CARE
Some states now require proof of intentional misconduct or 
recklessness to establish a breach of the duty of care.
Questions
1. What was the issue in this case?
2. The Cubs added lights in 1988. How could the board be 
meeting its duty of due care both in the 1960s by not erect-
ing lights and in the 1980s by doing so?
Director, Officer, Employee Liability
Wrigley involved a shareholder derivative suit. That action is initiated when the corpora-
tion is being harmed or defrauded and neither the board nor the senior executives will take 
action to protect it. This often involves self-dealing by these parties. The suit is brought by 
a minority shareholder, but any recovery inures to the corporation.
 
These cases are extremely difficult to win in light of the business judgment rule, which 
may apply to the board’s decision not to pursue litigation, as well as to the underlying  action 
that, it is argued, harmed the company. Nevertheless, many such suits are filed in the wake of 
any public corporate disaster. By one count, the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has “triggered more 
than 70 civil lawsuits.”10 With regard to the Deepwater Horizon rig,  shareholders argue that 
the board and executives of British Petroleum “recklessly disregarded accidents and safety 
warnings for years” in violation of their fiduciary duties. Many such lawsuits have also been 
filed by shareholders against directors and officers of companies in the mortgage and finan-
cial services industry that played key roles in the 2008 financial crisis.
 
When an employee or director commits a tort or crime while conducting corporate 
 business, both that person and the corporation are liable for the consequences. The legal 
doctrine that makes the employer liable for an employee’s acts is respondeat superior. 
(For more, see Chapter 12.)
 
Because officers and directors are ultimately responsible for corporate acts and because 
corporations are frequently sued, these persons face a high risk of becoming involved in 
costly litigation. Most corporations, therefore, indemnify (pay for or reimburse) these 
 individuals for the costs incurred to defend such suits. Many states permit indemnification 
even in some cases involving the breach of a fiduciary duty. Delaware, for example, 
 permits indemnification for breaches of the duty of care, although not for breaches of the 
duty of loyalty or for intentional misconduct or knowing violations of the law.11 When the 
SEC resolved its civil suit for securities fraud against Angelo Mozilo, CEO of Country-
wide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage lender before the housing market collapse, 
Countrywide and Bank of America (which bought Countrywide in 2008) paid $45 million 
of Mozilo’s $67.5 settlement.12

As a general rule, a corporation is treated as a legal entity, 
separate and distinct from its shareholders[, who] enjoy lim-
ited liability.
L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E
Limited Liability
To a lawyer there are two types of persons: natural and artificial. Natural persons are peo-
ple. Artificial persons, like corporations, are entities created under the law of a state 
(or  nation), which are considered to have separate legal existence. Corporations can own 
property, be sued, take on debts, and otherwise act as separate entities. As discussed, they 
even have limited constitutional rights. One of the great advantages of this status is that the 
owners of the corporation are generally not responsible for the corporation’s obligations. 
Should the corporation find that its liabilities overwhelm its assets, its creditors cannot 
reach the personal assets of the shareholders. That is, the liability of shareholders is limited 
to the loss of their investment in the corporation, which is the essence of limited liability 
and perhaps the most cherished characteristic of the corporate form. However, for closely 
held corporations, this feature can be severely restricted because lenders are well aware of 
limited liability and usually require the principal shareholders to guarantee the corpora-
tion’s debts. Still, limited liability will exist for other obligations, such as tort claims.
 
Closely held corporations also face the loss of limited liability through application 
of the doctrine known as piercing the corporate veil. This doctrine, explored in the Wolfe 
case that follows, usually has two elements: (1) misuse of the corporate form and 
(2) an unjust result if limited liability is allowed to stand.

bank account. When the corporation received payment from 
third parties, the money was deposited into the proprietor-
ship’s bank account. Even Mr. Wolfe could not distinguish be-
tween the corporation and the  proprietorship. . . .
 
It is clear that the corporation and the proprietorship were 
operated as a single instrumentality under the sole control of 
Mr. Wolfe. Therefore, it was proper for the Service to look to 
Wolfe’s personal assets to satisfy the taxes of his alter ego 
corporation.
Transferability of Ownership Interests
Federal securities laws impose broad restrictions on the transfer of stock, as will be seen in 
Part Three of this chapter. Beyond these (and analogous state) laws, no statutory restric-
tions are generally imposed on stock transfers. It is not uncommon, however, for disposi-
tions to be restricted by contract. For example, an employment contract might require that 
corporate stock granted to an employee be held until the employee leaves the company.
 
A common contractual restriction in closely held corporations is a buy-sell agreement 
which, at a minimum, forces a shareholder to offer his or her stock to the corporation or 
other shareholders before selling it to a third party. [For more on buy-sell agreements, see 
http://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/incorporation-and-legal-structures/faq-regarding-
buy-sell-agreements.html]
Duration of Existence
In general a corporation has indefinite duration. Nothing that transpires in the lives of the 
stockholders automatically affects the corporation’s existence.
 
The termination of a corporation, however, can occur—either voluntarily or involuntarily. 
Voluntary termination requires a vote by the shareholders, who might do so if business pros-
pects are no longer favorable. On termination the corporation is liquidated, which involves 
first satisfying all creditors and then distributing any remaining assets to the shareholders. 
Articles of dissolution are then filed, officially ending the corporation’s existence.
 
Involuntary terminations are caused by the action of a court or of the state corporation 
regulator. A court might end a closely held corporation’s existence if, for example, there is 
an irreconcilable deadlock among the shareholders. A common reason for the state to 
 terminate a corporation is for failure to pay annual fees or make required annual filings.
Taxes
As Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said, “Taxes are what we pay for 
civilized society.”13 But Justice Learned Hand also said, “[T]here is 
nothing sinister in so arranging one’s  affairs as to keep taxes as low 
as possible.”14
Taxation transfers about one-quarter of the United States’ economic output to the 
 government. Virtually everyone wants to minimize tax payments, hopefully by legal tax 
avoidance (careful planning within the law), not by illegal tax evasion (committing fraud 
to lower taxes).
“Taxes are what we pay for 
civilized society.”

392  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
 
Because the corporation is a separate legal entity, it is subject to taxation in its own right. 
This leads to what many would say is the corporation’s greatest disadvantage, double taxation. 
In the United States, a corporation pays tax on its income. When it later distributes its after-
tax income to its shareholders as dividends, the shareholders are taxed on that amount as 
well, hence, “double taxation.” Note, however, that dividends are not mandatory. They are 
paid only after the board declares them, which it is generally not required to do and which it 
legally cannot do if the corporation’s solvency (cash flow and net worth) is insufficient.
 
To illustrate, assume a corporation is subject to income taxes at the rate of 35 percent15 
and its shareholders all face a marginal rate of 33 percent, but a lower rate on corporate 
dividends of 15 percent. On an income of $10 million, the corporation would pay $3.5 million 
in taxes, leaving only $6.5 million for distribution as dividends. If that entire amount were 
distributed, the shareholders would pay $975,000 in taxes. Thus, of the $10 million corpo-
rate income, only $5.525 million can actually be spent by the owners—an effective tax rate 
of about 45 percent. Had it been possible to own the business in a form that was not subject 
to taxation in its own right, the total income taxes would have been $3.3 million, leaving 
$6.7 million available for the owners to spend—21 percent more.16
 
The argument that corporations are necessarily disadvantageous because of double tax-
ation can be misleading, however. There are a variety of circumstances in which  employing 
the corporate form yields clear tax advantages, especially for smaller closely held corpora-
tions. For example, if such a corporation wants to inject much of its net  income back into 
the business rather than distributing it as dividends, the corporate form may permit a lower 
tax rate on those reinvested funds. Another example results from corporations being the 
only form of business that comprehensively permits tax-deductible fringe benefits. [For 
more on fringe benefits, see www.irs.ustreas.gov/pub/ irs-pdf/p15b.pdf]
The Hybrid S Corporation: Limited Liability Without Double Taxation
As previously discussed, many argue that the principal disadvantage of the corporate form 
is double taxation. In response in 1958, Congress amended the Internal Revenue Code to 
establish a separate tax status for some corporations, now known as S corporations. An S 
corporation’s income is taxed only once—to the shareholders on their personal returns—
much like partnerships, which will be discussed below. Also like partnerships, an S corpo-
ration is limited in the deductibility of some fringe benefits. However, unlike partnerships, 
to the extent the S corporation’s income is allocated to its owners as dividends, no self-
employment tax is imposed, which is a tax separate from the income tax with an effective 
tax rate of approximately 13 percent on the first $117,000 of earned income in 2014. The 
Internal Revenue Service, however, routinely challenges attempts to distribute an exces-
sive amount as dividends where inadequate wages have been paid to S corporation owners.
 
Not all corporations can elect to be taxed as an S corporation. It is intended for use by 
smaller companies. Thus, S corporations may issue only one class of stock and may have 
no more than 100 shareholders, which in general may be individuals only. Interestingly, an 
entire family is treated as “one” individual for these purposes. Despite these restrictions, 
one can find S corporations with multi-billion-dollar revenues.
 
Keep in mind that “S” status is relevant only for federal (and some state) tax purposes. In 
all other respects the legal characteristics of S corporations are like all other corporations.

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  393
Capital Structure
Businesses often need access to capital to finance their activities. Capital is of two types: 
debt and equity—two ends of the spectrum with a boundary that can be challenging to iden-
tify. The providers of both debt and equity capital hold claims against the corporation’s 
 assets. However, creditors’ claims are always satisfied before equity holders’ claims.
 
Equity capital (stock) has a long-term horizon. Although any given shareholder 
may intend to hold the stock for only a short period, the stock itself is generally ex-
pected to  exist for the full life of the corporation. Three property rights are associated 
with stock ownership: the right to participate in earnings (that is, dividends), the right 
to participate in assets upon liquidation, and the right to participate in control. There 
are two principal classes of stock: preferred and common. Where only one class exists, 
it is common stock. Common stockholders share all three property rights in proportion 
to their holdings.
 
Preferred stock was created, largely for institutional investors 
(in 2009 institutional investors owned 73 percent of the largest 1000 
US companies17) like pension funds, to fill the gap on the risk-return 
spectrum between long-term debt and common stock. Finance 
professionals find it advantageous to have many different ways to 
combine risk and return. Preferred stock is associated with  “preferences,” which relate to 
distributions. Preferred stockholders are paid their required annual dividend in full before 
any dividends are distributed to the common stockholders. In addition, preferred 
stockholders have a preference upon the corporation’s liquidation. After the creditors are 
satisfied, the preferred stockholders receive the next round of distributions up to their 
stock’s liquidation value (also called redemption value) —typically a few percent over the 
stock’s par value.
 
The cost of these two preferences is the loss of the right to participate in control. Having 
no vote, preferred stockholders cannot elect directors to protect their interests. To help 
ensure that its holders regularly receive dividends, nearly all preferred stock is cumulative. 
This means that if a preferred stock dividend is missed, then before the common stock-
holders get any dividends, the preferred stock arrearage (all dividends not paid in any 
prior year) must be made up. Another protection occasionally granted to preferred stock-
holders is a contingent right to vote if, for example, a dividend is missed twice. This voting 
power would continue until all arrearages have been satisfied.
 
Because preferred stockholders never get more than their required dividends and, upon 
liquidation, little more than the purchase price, all corporate growth inures to the common 
stockholders. If both you and Bill Gates had invested $1 million in Microsoft at the outset, 
you taking preferred stock and Gates taking common stock, your stock would still be worth 
about $1 million, whereas Gates’s stock would be worth tens of billions.
 
Debt capital may be short- or long-term. Companies that provide motherboards to Dell 
are a source of short-term debt capital. They expect to be paid fairly quickly, although not at 
the moment of delivery. They have extended to Dell a very short-term form of debt. The 
long-term debt of a closely held corporation is likely to come from a commercial lender who 
takes a security interest in specified property of the corporation. This is much like an indi-
vidual who takes out a mortgage from a bank secured by the home the individual purchases 
Institutional investors hold 
73 percent of the largest 1000 
US corporations’ stock.

394  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
with the borrowed funds. Large corporations have another alternative for obtaining long-
term debt capital. Just as a public corporation may sell its stock to the public, large corpora-
tions may sell units of debt, called bonds, to the public. A pension plan that holds Dell’s 
20-year bonds is providing long-term debt capital to Dell.
 
Most debt capital specifies an interest rate (or a formula for computing the interest rate) 
to be paid on the principal borrowed, both of which (principal and interest) are required to 
be paid in set amounts, usually over a defined term.
 
Corporations carefully manage their capital structures (the balance between debt and 
equity). If the debt/equity ratio is too high, the corporation may be exposed to severe risk 
because debt obligations must be timely paid without regard to how profitable the business 
operations are. Further, the capital structure must be managed to ensure that debt covenants 
are not breached. A debt covenant is a term in the lending contract that makes the debt im-
mediately payable should the condition specified not be satisfied (such as exceeding a speci-
fied debt/equity ratio). On the other hand, if the ratio is too low, opportunities for positive 
financial leverage (employing funds at a rate of return that exceeds the interest rate on the 
borrowed funds) may be forfeited. Executives also recognize that interest paid on debt is 
tax deductible, whereas dividends paid to shareholders are not. This places a strong em-
phasis on the use of debt capital.
 
If you compare the characteristics of debt capital with preferred and common stock, you 
can readily see that preferred stock indeed does bridge the gap between common stock and 
debt. Increasingly, preferred stock is being issued with more debtlike characteristics. This 
poses serious classification problems for accountants, tax authorities, and bankruptcy courts.

Partnerships
This section discusses traditional, general partnerships. A partnership is two or more 
persons (partners) who carry on a business as co-owners. Recall that this is the default 
entity form for any business with two or more owners that does 
not specifically act to create a separate entity. About 7 percent of 
all businesses are general partnerships, generating less than 1 per-
cent of all revenue. Whereas corporate ownership interests are 
called stock or shares, the equity interest of a partner is called a 
partnership interest.
 
Partnerships are mutual agencies. Every partner is an agent of the partnership with the 
capacity to bind the partnership when acting within the scope of the partnership’s business. 
A general partnership is 
the default entity form for 
any business with two or 
more owners.

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  395
Knowledge held by any partner is deemed held by the partnership. As an agent, each  partner 
is entitled to reimbursement for costs personally incurred in furtherance of the partnership’s 
business. Each partner has the right to examine all partnership records and to demand a 
 formal determination by a court of the value of the partner’s interest (an  accounting).
 
Although the law of partnerships originated in the common law, all states except Loui-
siana adopted the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA), originally developed by the National 
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) in 1914. The UCCUSL 
adopted a revised form of the UPA in 1994 (RUPA), which to date has been adopted by 
37 states, the District of Columbia, and the Virgin Islands. Except as noted, the discussion 
below is based on the provisions of RUPA.
What Is the Law in Your State?
There are significant differences between UPA and RUPA. Which is the law in your state? 
You can find out at www.uniformlaws.org/Act.aspx?title=Partnership%20Act.
Formation and Nontax Costs
Under RUPA a partnership is a separate legal entity, distinct from its partners. However, 
no filing with the state is required to create it. If persons intend to go into business together 
and take no steps to establish a different form, they will automatically be a partnership. 
Mere co-ownership of property, however, does not create a partnership. The co-owners 
must intend to join in the sharing of risks and rewards via the active conduct of business.
 
As will be seen below, the partnership relationship carries substantial risks for the indi-
vidual partners. One might expect the contract that creates and governs the partnership, the 
partnership agreement, to very precisely specify the terms of that relationship. This may 
be true if the partnership agreement is written. However, the vast majority are oral agree-
ments. If disagreements arise over an oral agreement, the partners may find it very difficult 
to establish conclusively what the original agreement was. This will not be helped by the 
fact that when important disagreements arise, the partners often discover that their interests 
have become adverse and that the hopeful emotions shared at formation have been dis-
placed by anger and a sense of betrayal.
 
So if the problems associated with a lack of clarity can be substantial, why are partner-
ship agreements often oral and, even if written, often vague? The answer relates in part to 
the fact that to draft a quality partnership agreement a host of touchy, even unpleasant is-
sues must be concretely addressed. The drafter must ask, “How should the profit-sharing 
arrangement change if a partner becomes ill or fails to meet expectations?” And, “If the 
partnership does not work out, how will the relationship be unwound?” Soon-to-be part-
ners often shy away from tough questions like these; there may be a sense that asking them 
will sour the high spirits in which so many partnerships are born.
 
Partnership agreements also tend to be expensive to draft because of the many opportunities 
for customization, because state law provides only a general framework, and because the per-
sonal risks of being a partner are so significant. Similarly, partnership accounting systems can 
be among the most expensive of all the business forms because of the need to track the

which the jury could have inferred that the work which Rose 
did for Right Away Foods . . . was of the type which did not re-
quire the services of a CPA. However, Rose . . . admitted that 
there was no reason why he could not have rendered [those 
services] as a partner in the accounting firm. . . . In fact in re-
gard to services in connection with mergers and  acquisitions, 
[Parker testified] that he was unaware of any [such work that 
was not] prepared by public accounting firms. The preponder-
ance of all the evidence clearly establishes that Rose . . . per-
formed accounting services for Right Away Foods . . . in 
competition with the partnership. The [jury] was in error.
 
. . . Rose also admitted that he performed accounting ser-
vices for [Payne] for which he billed and received payment 
personally. There is no question that those services were pub-
lic accounting services. His later testimony that he performed 
the services, in effect, after hours, or in addition to his duties 
to the partnership, is of no value in light of the obligations im-
posed by the partnership agreement and by the common un-
derstanding of the term “competition.”
 
 [Reversed and remanded.]
Questions
1. a.  Why was Rose’s work for Right Away Foods considered 
a violation of the partnership agreement?
 
b. Why did Rose’s “after-hours” argument fail?
2. Could Rose operate a gas station without violating the 
partnership agreement?
FACTS
Veal Sr., Beale Jr., Gibson, Parker, and Rose were partners in 
an accounting firm. The partnership agreement permitted 
partners to pursue other business interests so long as doing 
so did not conflict with the partnership practice. Rose per-
formed accounting work for Right Away Foods and Payne, re-
ceiving the compensation personally. Rose’s partners claimed 
that he owed them a share in that he had competed with the 
firm in violation of the partnership agreement. The jury held for 
Rose. The partners appealed.
Chief Justice Nye

The partnership agreement between Rose and the appellants 
provided in part:
Except with the expressed approval of the other partners as 
to each specific instance, no partner shall perform any 
public accounting services . . . other than . . . on behalf of 
this partnership.
 
Partners . . . occupy a fiduciary relationship towards one 
another which requires of them the utmost degree of good 
faith and honesty in dealing with one another. . . .

 customized economic arrangements. However, the partnership form generally requires few, if 
any, annually recurring events such as state filings or statutorily mandated meetings of owners.
Management Structure
By default, management in a partnership is not centralized. Absent an agreement to the 
contrary, each partner has an equal right to participate in control on a one-partner, one-vote 
basis regardless of the size of the partner’s ownership interest. As the number of partners 
grows this can make partnerships unwieldy. In response some partnerships create a central 
management structure by adding provisions to the partnership agreement in which the 
partners yield many of their management rights to a subset of partners (perhaps only one—
a managing partner).
 
Partners owe each other the fiduciary duties of loyalty, confidentiality, sharing informa-
tion, and exercising due care. The Veale case below explores some of these duties.

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  397
Limited Liability
A partnership does not offer limited liability to its owners. The part-
ners are personally  liable for all of the partnership’s obligations 
should it default. This is clearly the greatest disadvantage of the 
partnership form.
Under RUPA partners are jointly and severally liable for both 
contract obligations and torts.18 If a partnership is found liable, the victorious claimant 
must first exhaust the partnership’s assets, but then can proceed to collect the remainder 
from any or all of the partners.19 If a wealthy partner pays the debt, that partner is entitled 
to recoup an appropriate share from the other partners under the right of contribution.
 
Under the doctrine of respondeat superior mentioned previously, the partnership, and 
therefore the partners, are liable for the torts of the partnership’s employees and for the 
unintentional torts of the partners. For example, an individual injured by the negligent 
driving of an employee can sue and recover from the partnership and then from individual 
partners.
 
Under some circumstances, partners may be jointly and severally liable for crimes com-
mitted by partnership employees, but they ordinarily will not be liable for crimes commit-
ted by partners (unless they themselves participated in or authorized the crime).
Transferability of Ownership Interests
Because partnerships are mutual agencies, involve fiduciary relationships, and do not have 
limited liability, without an express agreement to the contrary, the law does not allow a 
partner to transfer a partnership interest to a third person without the unanimous consent of 
the other partners. A partnership interest can be assigned, but the assignment entitles the 
assignee only to the distribution rights of the assigning partner (assignor). The assignee 
has no right to participate in control and does not have the status of partner.
Duration of Existence
Under UPA, a partnership is automatically dissolved, or terminated, upon the death, 
incapacity, bankruptcy, expulsion, or withdrawal of any partner. Thus, events in the 
private lives of the partners can seriously impact the business venture. To minimize 
the harm from such an automatic dissolution, it is common practice to include a provi-
sion in the partnership agreement allowing a partnership to be immediately reformed 
by the remaining partners. The ex-partner’s partnership interest would then be valued 
and paid out.
 
Under RUPA the only event listed above that will automatically dissolve a partnership 
is a partner’s express withdrawal. The remaining events will result in the disassociation of 
the affected partner, but will not dissolve the partnership nor require the formation of a 
new partnership by the remaining partners. The power of any partner to withdraw cannot 
be removed by the partnership agreement, but the right to exercise that power can be cir-
cumscribed and a wrongfully withdrawing partner can be required to compensate the part-
nership for any resulting damages. The remaining partners have a statutory right to resume 
the business as if no dissolution had occurred.20
Partners are personally liable 
for all the partnership’s 
 obligations should it default.

398  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
Taxes
The greatest advantage of the partnership form is the extraordinary range of economic re-
lationships that can be crafted. Whereas a 10 percent shareholder is simply entitled to 10 
percent of whatever distributions are made by the corporation, a partnership agreement can 
detach percentage ownership from the stream of distributions and tax consequences. For 
example, assume L contributes land to a real estate development partnership, K contributes 
knowledge as the general contractor, and C contributes the cash necessary to undertake the 
venture. It would be acceptable to allocate the partnership cash flow as follows: C gets all 
of the net cash flow until C’s initial cash contribution is recouped, then L gets all of the net 
cash flow until the value of L’s contributed land has been distributed, then all three share 
the remaining net cash flow equally.
 
Double taxation does not apply to partnerships because the Internal Revenue Code does 
not treat them as separate taxable entities, whether or not the state has adopted RUPA. The 
partnership’s income is taxed only once—on the personal tax returns of the partners as al-
located under the terms of the partnership agreement. There is a downside risk, however. 
Partners must pay tax annually on their share of the partnership income whether or not any 
cash or property has actually been distributed to them.
 
There are two important negative tax consequences of a partnership. First, fringe bene-
fits provided to partners are generally not business deductions (although fringes provided 
to employees are). Second, all of a partner’s allocable share of ordinary income is subject 
to the self-employment tax (at an effective rate of about 13 percent), as was previously 
discussed in the context of S corporations.
Capital Structure
The sole source of equity is the partners themselves, although new partners can be brought 
into the partnership to infuse new equity capital into the business. Debt capital can be 
raised based on the creditworthiness of the individual partners, as well as by offering assets 
to lenders as collateral for loans.
Question
What characteristics of the partnership form make it particularly desirable as a business 
entity? Particularly undesirable?
Limited Liability Companies
Today, a very popular business form is the limited liability company (LLC). After 1958, an 
S corporation could be elected that combined limited liability for owners with avoidance of 
double taxation. That form was not attractive to many businesses, however, because of the 
one class of stock limitation, the ceiling on the number of shareholders, and the require-
ment that all  economic and tax benefits and  burdens of the enterprise be shared pro rata ac-
cording to stock ownership. Wide displeasure with the lack of a limited liability business 
form that had the flexible tax  characteristics of partnerships led the Wyoming legislature to 
create the limited liability company in 1977. By 1997, LLCs were available nationally and 
are now the  fastest-growing business form in the United States.

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  399
Sole Proprietorships
Sole proprietorships, business ventures undertaken by a single individual, are not enti-
ties—they have no legal existence apart from the owner. However, the same characteristics 
used to evaluate other business forms can be applied to them. A sole proprietorship comes 
into existence by the mere decision of the proprietor to pursue a venture. Thus, it is the 
default business form for single owners. This largely explains why the majority of all busi-
ness endeavors are sole proprietorships, although they generate only 4 percent of all busi-
ness revenue—averaging a little over $50,000. No legal filings or fees are required to 
establish a sole proprietorship, but a business license, sales tax license, fictitious name fil-
ing, or other permits may be required by the state, county, and/or city where the business 
is located. Since there is only one owner, centralization of management automatically ex-
ists. Like a partnership, the owner is personally liable for all obligations of the business.
 
A proprietor may dispose of the proprietorship freely, but such a transfer can be accom-
plished only through the transfer of the assets which underlie the business, not by a transfer 
of the “business” in its own right. Further, the lack of a separate legal entity generally 
 
Although a uniform act for LLCs was first established by the NCCUSL in 1994, only 
nine states ultimately adopted it. In 2006, a revised act was adopted by the NCCUSL, 
which, as of this writing, has been adopted by nine jurisdictions (including the District of 
Columbia). Thus, there is still considerable variation in governing provisions from state to 
state. The general outlines of LLCs are discussed below.
 
To create an LLC, the owners (although some states allow one-member LLCs), called 
members, file articles of organization with the state, much as a corporation files articles of 
incorporation. The equity interests are called members’ interests. An operating agreement, 
which can be oral or written but is most likely to be written, will be prepared which sets 
forth information similar to that often found in partnership agreements. Minor annual fil-
ings and fees are generally required, but statutes do not impose annual meetings on the 
members. The cost of setting up an accounting system for an LLC will be essentially the 
same as for a partnership because LLCs have the same flexibility over economic and tax 
matters as does the partnership form.
 
The management structure of LLCs is extremely flexible: the operating agreement gener-
ally specifies whether it will be centrally managed by managers (manager-managed:  often one 
or two of the members) or member-managed (similar to a partnership). Many states require 
this choice to be set out in the articles of organization. Similarly, a multimember LLC can 
elect upon its creation whether to be taxed like a corporation or like a partnership. (A single-
member LLC will elect between treatment as a corporation or as a sole proprietorship.)
 
LLCs are hybrids because, with regard to limited liability of the owners and the duration of 
existence, they more closely resemble corporations. With regard to transferability of owner-
ship interests and access to equity capital, however, they more closely resemble partnerships. 
In many states it is still an open question whether the limited liability of LLC members can be 
“pierced” as is possible with corporate shareholders. Minnesota’s LLC statute expressly pro-
vides for piercing the veil of LLCs.21 In 2002, the Wyoming Supreme Court held, “We can 
discern no reason, in either law or policy, to treat LLCs differently than we treat corporations. 
If the members and officers of an LLC fail to treat it as a separate entity, they should not enjoy 
immunity from individual liability for the LLC’s acts that cause damage to third parties.”22

400  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
 results in the termination of a sole proprietorship if the owner becomes incapacitated or 
dies. Only a holder of a durable power of attorney, custodian or executor has the legal 
power to continue operations, but either of the latter two would be forced continually to 
seek court approval to perform the activities required to operate the business. This imprac-
tical arrangement would likely destroy the business’s value in short order.
 
A sole proprietorship is not a taxable entity. All of its revenues and expenses will be 
incorporated into the personal tax return of the proprietor. Like partnerships, most fringe 
benefits are not deductible as business expenses and all business income is subject to self-
employment tax. The capital structure issues for a sole proprietorship are similar to those 
of a partnership—without a change in business form, new equity can only come from the 
sole proprietor. Any debt will be based on the creditworthiness of the proprietor and the 
property the proprietor can offer as security.
Other Hybrid Forms
Limited Liability Partnerships
At the same time LLCs were being conceived, the great multinational accounting firms were 
reeling from an episode in which the quality of their audits proved less than advertised—the 
savings and loan collapse of the 1980s. Over $1.6 billion in settlements (a staggering sum for 
that era) was paid out and these firms feared extinction if professional liability damages 
could not be brought under control. Efforts to obtain tort reform that would limit such liabil-
ity failed, so a new approach was sought—the limited liability partnership (LLP). These 
were first enacted in Texas in 1991 at the instigation of a number of its major law firms, who 
also sought relief from professional liability. Within a year, 1,200 law firms became LLPs.23
 
Most states now have some form of an LLP. In spite of the similarity of name and its 
creation in the shadow of LLCs, its closest analogue is a general partnership, not an LLC. 
For example, its governing law is included as Article 10 of RUPA. To bring an LLP into 
existence, a document, called a statement of qualification in RUPA, is filed with the state. 
Minor annual filings and fees are required. LLPs (and their partners) are taxed like a gen-
eral partnership and in all other characteristics most closely resemble partnerships.
 
As originally conceived and as is still true in some states, an LLP partner’s limited lia-
bility extended only to the negligence or malpractice of other partners, while retaining full 
liability for all other partnership obligations. RUPA, and many states, now provide full 
limited liability “whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise” to all partners “solely by 
reason of being” a partner.24 In those states the only individuals who would continue to use 
the general partnership form would likely be those without competent legal advice or who 
are unwilling to pay the modest filing fee.
Professional Limited Liability Companies (PLLCs) and Professional Limited 
Liability Partnerships (PLLPs)
Some states that have established LLPs that confer full limited liability for partners have 
chosen to prohibit their use by licensed professionals such as accountants, lawyers, and 
doctors. As an alternative, they have created entities (variously named depending on the 
state) that closely resemble the original Texas LLP concept. They delegate regulation 

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  401
 relating to malpractice to an appropriate state-licensing body and/or set malpractice insur-
ance standards for the protection of the public.
Limited Partnerships
Limited partnerships have existed for a considerable time in the United States and were 
extremely popular until the advent of limited liability companies. They are entities with 
two classes of owners: general partners and limited partners. General partners have the 
same legal benefits and burdens as the partners of a general partnership. They (often only 
one) are the sole managers of the entity. Limited partners invest in the entity by contribut-
ing capital but do not participate in control (except to a limited extent analogous to share-
holders). In exchange for limited control, they receive limited liability. The principal 
disadvantage of general partner status is unlimited liability. In practice, however, most 
general partners are corporations with minimal capital investment, so unlimited liability is 
little threat unless grounds for piercing the corporate veil exist.
 
Forty-nine states have adopted the Uniform Limited Partnership Act (ULPA) in one of 
its three versions. The latest, ULPA (2001), has been adopted in 18 states and the District 
of Columbia. Limited partnerships come into existence only upon filing a certificate of 
limited partnership. Minor annual filings and fees are required. The law of limited partner-
ships provides that those events that would terminate a general partnership have minimal 
impact on a limited partnership’s existence. In general, a limited partnership is taxed like a 
partnership. However, like an S corporation shareholder, the ordinary income of the lim-
ited partners is not subject to self-employment tax.
Limited Liability Limited Partnerships
State legislation establishing limited liability limited partnerships (LLLPs) is generally 
directed at facilitating the acquisition of limited liability for the general partners of preex-
isting limited partnerships. In some cases, reorganization of an existing limited partner-
ship would have entailed expensive or impassable hurdles. Under ULPA (2001), an LLLP 
is created simply by stating that the limited partnership is an LLLP in the certificate of 
limited partnership.25
Series Limited Liability Companies 
A handful of states, including Delaware, have enacted legislation enabling a new species of 
LLC. The concept is to create a related set of entities (referred to as “series” or “cells”) 
through which the liability risks of different real estate investments or businesses are kept 
separate even though only one entity, the series LLC, is created under state law. This sepa-
ration of liability for different activities is somewhat akin to an S corporation and its rela-
tionship to its wholly owned “qualified subchapter S subsidiaries,” the tax consequences for 
all of which are reported on one federal income tax return. State series LLC statutes permit 
each cell to have different managers and different members.
International Hybrids
Dozens of other business forms exist throughout the world. For the most part, these forms 
are intended to achieve various combinations of the characteristics just discussed. Using 
these criteria, managers operating in a multinational environment should be able to evalu-
ate form-of-business decisions under a variety of regimes.

402  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
Social Businesses on the Horizon?
The concept of a “social business” has been promoted by Dr. Muhammad Yunus, an econo-
mist and winner of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize. The concept occupies a unique place on the 
continuum that runs from for-profit businesses to not-for-profit organizations. A social busi-
ness is distinguished from a for-profit business in that it is formed to further a specific posi-
tive social objective, rather than primarily seeking profit-maximization for its owners. 
Profits are applied to the furtherance of its stated social objective; regular reporting would 
include both financial reporting and identification of concrete progress toward its social 
goals. A social business is distinct from a nonprofit enterprise in at least two key respects: it 
is intended to be an economically self-sustaining enterprise, which means it must adhere to 
commercially reasonable business practices, and its start-up capital is to be returned to its 
founding investors, although without interest. For such businesses to become a reality, an-
other new form is required. Twenty states have adopted “benefit corporation” statutes, and 
another 17 are considering doing so. In such corporations, the directors’ fiduciary duties 
require consideration of nonfinancial interests. [For more information see http://benefit-
corp.net/state-by-state-legislative-status] In addition, 10 states have enacted “low-profit 
LLC statutes.” Such LLCs require the entity’s social mission to take priority over its profit 
objective. [For more information see www.intersectorl3c.com/l3c_tally.html]
Circumstances Favoring a Specific Business Form
Before the rise in the availability of the various hybrid forms discussed, some states re-
quired certain activities to be carried on in the partnership form, most notably the li-
censed professions. The primary concern was that these professionals should not be able 
to escape personal liability for malpractice by incorporating their practices. As noted 
above, all states now offer an alternative to a general partnership for these professions.
 
Today selection of a particular form is driven by market realities, as well as the found-
ers’ desires for certain characteristics that were previously discussed. Some of those mar-
ket realities will now be addressed.
 
One consideration in the selection of an appropriate form is the total capital needed by the 
enterprise. Large businesses need billions of dollars. Only access to global capital markets 
(like the New York Stock Exchange) can fulfill this need. With only fairly recent exceptions 
(see the text box below), the only form of business that has met with success in these markets 
is the C corporation. In contrast, because partnerships do not offer limited liability, freely 
transferable interests, or indefinite life, they are (with few exceptions) not appropriate for 
ventures requiring large amounts of capital accessed via the financial markets.
The Rise of the Distorporation
Even as “regular” corporations continue to dominate the public capital markets, a new trend 
is under way. Noncorporate business forms, such as real estate investment trusts (REITs), 
regulated investment companies (RICs), and master limited partnerships (MLPs) are 

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  403
 increasingly attracting capital. As of 2012, these entities (sometimes described as “distorpora-
tions”) represented 9 percent of all listed companies but absorbed 28 percent of all new eq-
uity. Among the advantages, management is left firmly in control, double-taxation is avoided, 
and all investors enjoy limited liability. On the downside, because these entities generally 
must distribute all of their earnings annually, they are unable to fund growth internally. They 
therefore must return to the capital markets year after year to pursue expansion. Many believe 
distorporations will continue to erode corporate primacy in the securities markets. 26
 
It is not rare to find someone with a great idea but insufficient resources to take the idea 
to market. Some investors, such as venture capitalists, seek out such persons. They will 
usually insist that the venture have limited liability, as would be true with a corporation or 
an LLC. [For more on venture capitalists, see www.nvca.org]
 
Similarly, franchisors normally demand that franchisees operate their franchises in a 
business form with limited liability. A franchise is the right to exploit the franchisor’s in-
tangible assets (trade name and business systems) and to partake of the franchisor’s mar-
keting, purchasing, and other services. The key advantages to the franchisee are a proven 
product or service, turn-key implementation, and access to support. The franchisor gains 
by earning fees and by achieving accelerated market penetration using the capital of others 
(franchisees). Unfortunately, franchisor fraud and oppression are not unusual, so careful 
investigation is essential. Furthermore, premium franchises can be expensive. [For an 
 extensive listing of franchise opportunities and their minimum cash requirements, see

With the development of such business forms as LLCs, LLPs, and S corporations, under 
most circumstances the disadvantages of the general partnership form are so severe that a 
person is usually well advised to avoid it.

Part Two—Corporate Governance in Public Corporations
Public corporations have thousands of shareholders. The vast majority of these sharehold-
ers do not plan to spend their time intimately involved in the company’s business. They 
wish to entrust their resources to the stewardship of the company’s management and return 

404  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
to their personal affairs. To ensure the corporation is acting to further their interests, the 
shareholders elect a board of directors. Public corporation boards generally have both 
 inside and outside directors. Inside directors are senior executives. Outside directors are 
not employed by the company. These boards meet at regular intervals to monitor the 
 corporation’s activities, establish corporate policies, hire and replace corporate executives, 
and make major decisions.
That at least is the textbook description of corporate governance. 
What has become painfully evident from both the accounting scan-
dals of the Enron era and the 2008 collapse of the financial system 
is that reality can be quite different. Enron called the world’s atten-
tion to extraordinary failings in corporate governance, but its  demise 
was not an isolated event. Numerous predecessors failed to alert the 
markets and many more followed, at least three of which were actually larger (WorldCom, 
Parmalat, and Fannie Mae). The 2008 financial crisis made clear the ongoing corporate 
governance problems. The report of the Financial Crisis  Inquiry Commission (the body 
charged by Congress to determine the causes of the financial crisis) identified serious is-
sues As the majority report states, “We conclude dramatic failures of corporate governance 
and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions were a key 
cause of this crisis.”27  In the words of Carl Icahn, “The entirely preventable financial ca-
tastrophe . . . has many culprits: reckless executives who gambled with their company’s 
futures, feckless regulators and somnambulant boards of directors.”28
 
This part of the chapter will consider corporate governance issues, including reforms 
adopted in the wake of both Enron and the 2008 financial crisis, as well as reforms driven 
by the shareholder rights movement.
The Management Pyramid
Corporations have centralized management. At the apex of the management pyramid is the 
board of directors. Immediately below is the CEO. In the next layer are the vice presidents 
and other top officers and executives. This classic management pyramid further expands 
through layers of middle management, finally coming to the base comprised of rank-and-
file employees. The light shed on the boardroom by various government investigations and 
shareholder lawsuits in the Enron era revealed that the pyramid had become inverted at the 
top. Far too frequently, boards simply abdicated responsibility to their CEOs who often held 
the ultimate power because of their strong influence over the board nomination process 
and their control over the information provided to the board. Directorships can be very 
lucrative—tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars annually for attendance at a modest 
number of meetings. Far too few directors were willing to challenge CEO actions out of 
fear of forfeiting their substantial compensation. In addition many conflicts of interest 
were discovered. At Enron, for example, some directors were personal friends of senior 
managers, others were academics whose institutions were receiving substantial contribu-
tions from the company or its officers, and still another was a former senior government 
official who had exempted Enron from the regulation of its principal line of business 
 (dealing with energy derivatives).

The federal legislation passed in the wake of Enron, the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 
(SOX), attempted to address some of these governance issues. To limit the CEO’s control 
of audit information reaching the board, it requires a board audit committee consisting 
exclusively of independent directors—outside directors without conflicts of interest—one 
of whom is required to be a financial expert. SOX gives the audit committee direct respon-
sibility for hiring the outside auditing firm and setting its compensation. It further prohibits 
that firm from also rendering most types of consulting services to audit clients. To limit the 
CEO’s control over board membership SOX requires a nominating committee also com-
posed solely of independent directors.
 
Even after SOX, there are still serious concerns about who truly sits at the top of the 
pyramid. The CEO still controls much of the information that reaches the board. Shortly 
before the financial crisis The Wall Street Journal published a special report on corporate 
governance, headlined “Why CEOs Need to Be Honest with Their Boards: Too Often 
Chief Executives Sugarcoat the Truth. That’s More  Dangerous Than Ever.”29 Many still 
wonder whether boards are active in setting policies and making major decisions or are 
simply following the CEO’s lead. Such concerns seem plausible where, for example, im-
mediately after Lehman Brothers’ CEO announced a $3.9 billion third quarter loss in 2008 
en route to an implosion not long after, he stated, “I must say the board’s been wonderfully 
supportive.”30
 
A logical response to this problem would be to require that the positions of board chair 
and CEO be held by different individuals. “No one can reasonably expect a person to over-
see himself or herself.… The CEO works for the board, not the other way around; the 
continuation of combined roles inhibits the board in exercising its responsibilities because 
it creates an insurmountable imbalance of power.”31 At the time the “Great Recession” 
unfolded in 2008, both positions were more often than not held by a single person in For-
tune 500 companies.32 The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in response to the financial crisis,  
now requires that corporations disclose the reasons for choosing the same person for both 
positions, but does not prohibit the practice.
Question
What should the board’s role be? Consider the following two opinions:
[B]oards [are] supposed to monitor risks, provide judgment and supervise managers on 
 behalf of shareholders.33
Most boards meet one or two days a month and are composed of individuals who also 
hold demanding full-time jobs. Given those circumstances, it’s absurd to believe that board 
members, even the most experienced and best-intentioned of them, will uncover systemic 
flaws or acts of malfeasance. . . . That’s what regulators, outside accountants, and internal 
controls are for—to help boards ferret out excessive risk and wrongdoing.34
The Shareholder Rights Movement
Although shareholders own the corporation, control rests with the board. As noted in the 
discussion of the business judgment rule, state law significantly restricts the shareholders’ 
ability to control management, other than indirectly through the annual election of the board.

406  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
The notion that shareholders can actually exercise control 
through the board election process is doubtful. As stated above, 
shareholders do not select the candidates for board positions; a com-
mittee of the existing board does. Could a dissatisfied shareholder 
offer a different slate of directors for the shareholders to vote on? In 
theory yes; in practice proxy fights are difficult, and expensive.
Management annually solicits proxies from its shareholders. A proxy is written permis-
sion to vote a shareholder’s stock on an issue such as the election of directors. Manage-
ment’s solicitation is done in conjunction with its required notification to shareholders of 
the annual meeting and the cost is thus borne by the corporation. Shareholders wanting to 
propose alternative candidates have to be prepared to bear the entire cost themselves. State 
law gives shareholders the right of access to shareholder lists maintained by the company, 
but often a shareholder will have to sue, at a substantial cost in time and money, to force 
the corporation to comply. If successful, the shareholders involved must incur substantial 
costs to develop for SEC review the solicitation materials.
 
Not surprisingly, proxy fights are rare. Most shareholders who disagree with manage-
ment’s decisions simply sell their shares and invest elsewhere. From society’s and the 
shareholders’ points of view, the management of publicly held corporations proceeds 
largely unchecked, unless securities law violations (discussed in Part Three) are involved. 
Stephen Davis, the executive director of the Center for Corporate Governance at Yale, re-
fers to this as “the myth that boards [are] accountable to shareholders.”35
 
In recent years various proposals to give shareholders more input have been gaining 
ground, largely through the efforts of institutional investors and independent activists. In-
stitutional investors, such as pension funds and mutual funds, have significant influence in 
the capital markets. When the largest U.S. public pension, the California Public Employees’ 
Retirement System (CALPERS), contacts the C-suite at a company in which it holds sub-
stantial stock, management is likely to listen.
Majority Rules
One shareholder reform that has gained significant ground involves the number of votes 
required to elect a director. Many state laws, including Delaware, allow directors to be 
elected by just a plurality of the votes cast in person or by proxy. If the only names before 
the shareholders are management’s slate of directors, management nominees will win even 
if a substantial number of shareholders withhold their votes in protest. In 2006, only 
16 percent of firms in the S&P 500 had any form of majority vote requirement. Within 18 
months the number was 60 percent.36 Unfortunately, the impact is not as great as it might 
first appear. In most cases where management has agreed to a majority vote rule, it has not 
agreed to reject automatically a candidate who has commanded only a plurality, but only 
to review whether or not to seat such a candidate.
Broker Voting
Another area of movement concerns broker voting. Many individual shareholders do not 
hold their shares but leave them on account with their broker. Past practice was that, unless 
the account owner specifically directed otherwise, the broker could vote the shares, which 
typically occurred in a promanagement fashion. That practice has been reversed by the 
The notion that shareholders 
can exercise control is 
doubtful.

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  407
Dodd–Frank Act, which prohibits broker voting unless specific instructions are received 
from the shareholder. The likely consequence is that fewer shares will be voted, shifting 
even greater influence to the large institutional shareholders who do vote.
Proxy Access
One of the most controversial issues of recent years has been proxy access. As previously 
discussed, though it is possible for dissatisfied shareholders to wage a proxy fight, it is usu-
ally not feasible to do so. A cost-effective solution would be to require management to in-
clude shareholder nominees on the company’s ballot sent to shareholders in advance of the 
annual meeting. Although state law does not give shareholders that right, a corporation’s 
bylaws could. To propose such a change would require a shareholder to submit the bylaw 
proposal to the corporation for inclusion in the annual meeting materials. If management 
wants to reject the request for inclusion of the proposal, it becomes a matter subject to regula-
tion by the SEC. The SEC under the Bush administration took the position that management 
was not required to include such proposals in the company’s proxy materials, but in 2006 a 
Federal Circuit Court ruled against the SEC’s interpretation of the relevant regulation.37 In 
response, the SEC opened a rule-making proceeding on proxy access. In August 2010, after 
a change in both the administration and the composition of the SEC, the commission issued 
a new rule permitting shareholder groups (owning at least 3 percent of a company’s stock for 
at least three years) to submit nominees for inclusion in the company’s ballot, with the caveat 
that no more than 25 percent of the board can be elected in this fashion.
Executive Compensation
Executive compensation has long been an issue for shareholders. The 20th-century 
 American economist John Kenneth Galbraith observed that “[t]he salary of the chief executive 
of a large corporation is not a market award for achievement. It is frequently in the nature 
of a warm personal gesture by the individual to himself.” It is also an issue that is likely not 
to go away soon. In the late 1970s CEOs earned 30 to 40 times the income of average 
workers; by 2007, CEOs of large public corporations earned 344 times the income of aver-
age workers.38 The Dodd–Frank Act now requires that the ratio be disclosed annually. It 
also requires disclosure of the relationship between executive compensation and the finan-
cial performance of the company, giving consideration to both stock price and dividends. 
Efforts to control executive compensation appear to have borne lit-
tle fruit. In 2012, the compensation of the top 200 CEOs of publicly 
traded companies increased 16 percent to a median of $15 million.39 
The highest paid was John Hammergren of McKesson, who 
 received $131 million.40 In addition, the average perquisites for the 
100 highest-paid CEOs rose 19 percent to $321,000.41
 
Dodd–Frank also includes a say on pay provision requiring companies to put a separate, 
but nonbinding, resolution before the shareholders to approve the compensation paid to 
senior executives. This seems to have had little practical impact. During 2012, sharehold-
ers upheld about 98 percent of pay proposals.42 Interestingly, the Swiss enacted a law 
providing for a binding shareholder say on pay for its executives.43
By 2007, CEOs of large 
 public corporations earned 
344 times the income of 
 average workers.

408  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
An interesting shareholder derivative case alleging a vio-
lation of the duty of care arose out of CEO Michael Eis-
ner’s hiring, and subsequent firing, of Michael Ovitz from 
his position as president of Walt Disney Co. The suit al-
leged that Eisner and the Disney board had violated their 
duty of care by hiring Ovitz (who had no previous experi-
ence as an executive of a public company in the enter-
tainment industry), as well as when Ovitz was granted a 
no-fault termination. The consequence of invoking the 
no-fault clause in Ovitz’s employment contract was that, 
after barely one year of employment, Ovitz received more 
than $38 million in cash, as well as 3 million stock options. 
Notably, the maximum salary Ovitz could have earned ac-
tually working was $11 million annually. Following a 
three-month trial, the Delaware judge wrote, “For the fu-
ture, many lessons of what not to do can be learned from 
defendants’ conduct here. Nevertheless, I conclude that . . . 
the defendants did not act in bad faith, and were at most 
ordinarily negligent, in connection with the hiring of 
Ovitz. . . . In accordance with the business judgment rule, 
. . . ordinary negligence is insufficient to constitute a vio-
lation of the fiduciary duty of care.” The court also found 
that Ovitz could not have been fired for cause because he 
did not commit gross negligence or malfeasance while 
serving as Disney’s president. Thus, Eisner did not breach 
his duty of care by agreeing to the no-fault termination. In 
2006, ten years after Ovitz was terminated, this decision 
was affirmed on appeal by the Delaware Supreme Court.

Since 2007, as a result of a change in SEC disclosure 
rules, shareholders have been receiving more informa-
tion on executive compensation packages. According to 
one source, executive severance packages typically 
“include a payment of three times salary and bonus, 
 immediate vesting of options and restricted stock 
awards, and, in many cases, payment of taxes owed. . . . 
[D]ozens of executives could have payouts of $100 mil-
lion or more.”
Questions
1. Apart from the legality, is it ethical for a board to agree 
to an executive severance package when an executive 
is terminated for poor performance?
2. Such packages are negotiated as part of the hiring pro-
cess. Would it chill the negotiations for a board to state 
a corporate policy against severance payments under 
such circumstances?

Part Three—Regulation of the Securities Markets
Introduction
As the recent financial crisis has shown, the capital markets are much broader than the 
market for securities, which in turn is far broader than the market for corporate securities. 
Nevertheless, the focus of this part of the chapter is on business access to capital.
 
To amass the capital needed to pursue sizeable business oppor-
tunities, particularly global opportunities, a large number of inves-
tors must be convinced to entrust their wealth to third parties. 
History shows that this trust has often been misplaced, with vast 
sums lost in companies with incompetent or corrupt management. 
As a result the federal government has undertaken to promote the reliability of the U.S. 
securities markets through regulation. The backbone of this regulation grew out of the 
stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. As previously men-
tioned, significant additional regulation has followed the corporate failures of the Enron 
era and the Great Recession of 2008 regulation to which this chapter now turns.
Initial Public Offerings
When a corporation wants to sell a new security through the public capital markets 
(whether debt or equity), if the corporation (issuer) and any of the persons to whom the 
security is offered for sale (offerees) are domiciled in different states (interstate offering), 
federal law governs the sale. If the corporation and all offerees are domiciled in the same 
state (intrastate offering), state law (considered later) applies. If a company has not previ-
ously offered equity securities to the public, the offering is referred to as an initial public 
offering (IPO) or, more colloquially, going public. For example,  on Thursday, 
 November 7, 2013, Twitter went public at $26 a share. It immediately jumped to $45.44 
Conversely, if a private investor seeks to purchase all of the publicly held equity securities 
of a corporation, that company is said to be going private.
 
In this context, the term security embraces both the instruments commonly understood 
to be securities, like stocks and bonds, as well as a much broader class called investment 
contracts. The Howey case that follows defines the term.
Vast sums (have been) lost in 
companies with incompetent 
or corrupt management.

money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits 
solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party. . . .

portunity to contribute money and to share in the profits of a 
large citrus fruit enterprise managed [by respondent. It is] 
offering this opportunity to persons who reside in distant lo-
calities and who lack the equipment and experience requi-
site to the cultivation, harvesting and marketing of the citrus 
products. . . .
 
 [Respondent’s] failure to abide by the statutory and admin-
istrative rules in making such offerings cannot be sanctioned 
under the Act. . . .
Questions
1. Would an investment in Microsoft stock satisfy the defini-
tion of “investment contract”?
2. Why do you think Congress added the term “investment 
contract” to the definition of “security”?
AFTERWORD
Following the Howey case, courts have looked more closely at 
the final criterion, that the investor “is led to expect profits pri-
marily from the efforts” of others [emphasis added], and have 
generally taken a practical view of the requirement. The goal 
has been to distinguish circumstances in which investors will 
be primarily passive from those in which there is a reasonable 
expectation of significant investor control.45 Thus, membership 
units in an LLC may or may not qualify as investment contracts, 
depending on the surrounding facts.46

pooled. The purchasers were mostly non-residents of 
 Florida and were predominantly professional people who 
lacked the knowledge and equipment necessary for the 
 citrus business. They were attracted by the expectation of 
substantial profits.

It is admitted that the mails and instrumentalities of inter-
state commerce are used in the sale of the land and service 
contracts and that no registration statement . . . has ever been 
filed with the [Securities Exchange Commission.]
 
 [The Securities Act of 1933] defines the term “security” to 
include the commonly known [instruments like stocks and 
bonds.] The definition also includes [the term] “investment

tion of whether the land sales contract, the warranty deed and 
the service contract together constitute an  “investment con-
tract” within the meaning of [the Act]. An affirmative answer 
brings into operation the registration requirements. . . .
 
By including an investment contract within the scope of . . . 
the Securities Act, Congress was using a term the meaning of 
which had been crystallized by this prior judicial interpreta-
tion. It is therefore reasonable to attach that meaning to the 
term as used by Congress, especially since such a definition is 
consistent with the statutory aims. In other words, an invest-
ment contract for purposes of the Securities Act means a con-
tract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his 
410  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
1933 Act
The federal law governing initial securities offerings is the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 
Act), which is administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The 1933 
Act does not guarantee the economic merits of any investment opportunity. Rather, it seeks 
(1) to ensure full disclosure of all material facts about the investment opportunity to 
 offerees (potential investors) before they invest and (2) to eliminate fraudulent conduct in 
the markets. Thus, a securities offering that passes muster under the federal securities law 
has not been approved by the government as a good investment. [For more on the SEC, see 
www.sec.gov]
 
To promote full disclosure the 1933 Act forbids any interstate offering of a new security 
until a registration statement has been filed with and approved by the SEC. The  registration 
statement has two parts: the prospectus and the supplemental information. The prospectus 
is the major component and is delivered to offerees to satisfy the requirement for prein-
vestment disclosure. There are three main sections in a prospectus. One contains general 
information about the company: the industry in which it operates, the quality of its 

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  411
 products and services and of its management, its business plan, and so on. Another sec-
tion contains a risk assessment of the business model, local operating conditions (such as 
political instability), and the like. For example, although companies have long been re-
quired to disclose possible impacts on the business from various environmental factors, in 
2010 the SEC began requiring companies to disclose the risks that global climate change 
might pose to their business, such as whether any new law or treaty limiting carbon diox-
ide emissions might increase operating costs.47
 
The third portion of the prospectus is the audited financial statements. An investor’s 
goal is to make money. Investors want to know how well the corporation under considera-
tion has accomplished this in the past so they can estimate its future economic potential. A 
corporation’s ability to make a profit is shown on its income statement, one of the three 
audited financial statements. The income statement shows the company’s revenue and ex-
penses on an annual basis.
 
Because the income statement seeks to measure economic income, it employs accrual 
accounting, which recognizes revenue when earned (not when cash is received) and which 
recognizes expenses in the period in which the related income is reported (regardless of 
when those expenses are paid). Since the income statement focuses only on economic in-
come, a statement of cash flows reconciling the beginning and ending cash balances is also 
presented.
 
The third financial statement, the balance sheet, presents the company’s assets, liabili-
ties, and equity. Although balance sheets have numerous deficiencies (such as the use of 
historical cost rather than current value to measure assets), they attempt to describe the 
corporation’s financial position as of a particular date, such as the end of the year pre-
sented in the income statement.
 
Technically, the financial statements are prepared by the corporation’s management. To 
give comfort to investors that management has prepared these statements properly and 
honestly, independent certified public accountants (CPAs) are engaged to audit them. Au-
dits must be performed in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS). 
GAAS are intended to ensure that the procedures used to investigate the financial state-
ments are thorough. The objective of the investigation is to determine whether the finan-
cial statements are not materially misleading, in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP). GAAP provides the rules for how revenues, expenses, as-
sets, liabilities, and equity are measured and disclosed. One might paraphrase an audit: 
independent experts (CPAs) are supposed to “look hard” (GAAS) and decide whether the 
financial statements accurately measure the income, cash flow, and financial position of 
the corporation (GAAP).
 
The supplemental information portion (the second part) of the registration statement, 
which is not distributed to offerees, describes such matters as how much it is costing to 
“float” the offering and what major contracts exist with unions, suppliers, or customers.
 
The SEC vigorously enforces the 1933 Act’s prescribed relationship between solicita-
tion or sales of a security and the registration process. There are three critical stages. Dur-
ing the prefiling period (before the registration statement has been filed with the SEC), no 
solicitation or sales are permitted. During the waiting period (after the registration state-
ment has been filed, but before it has been approved by the SEC), no sales are permitted 
but a limited amount of solicitation is allowed. Specifically, a tombstone ad (so called

Corporations may use the securities markets to obtain debt 
capital by selling corporate bonds. Bonds are “securities” 
and thus are governed by the federal securities laws. To 
issue new bonds, a corporation will usually seek to have 
the bond rated by a credit rating agency such as Moody’s, 
Standard & Poor’s, or Fitch. Without such a rating it may be 
hard for the corporation to sell a sufficient number of, or to 
obtain the maximum price for, its bonds. Most of the reve-
nues of these agencies come from the fees paid by issuers 
seeking to have their debt rated. These facts raise potential 
conflicts of interest for the agencies—on the one hand they 
are in business to produce credible, independent evalua-
tions of issuers and bonds, but on the other hand they have 
to compete with other agencies for issuers’ business.

 because of its shape) may be published in forums like The Wall Street Journal to make the 
market aware of the upcoming issuance. In addition, a red herring prospectus (name taken 
from the prominent red ink cautionary statement required on its first page) may be 
distributed. This is the draft prospectus included with the filed registration statement. Once 
the SEC approves the registration statement, the posteffective period begins. 
 Solicitations are permitted and sales may be made, but only if the offerees have first 
received the final prospectus.
 
Some companies do shelf registrations that allow them to issue securities in portions 
over a two-year period under a single registration statement. This allows issuers to float the 
securities when market conditions are most favorable, without having to place the entire 
issue shortly after the registration statement becomes effective.
 
Typically not wanting to sell the securities themselves, issuers employ one of two kinds 
of underwriters. A best-efforts underwriter acts as the issuer’s sales agent, does not take title 
to the securities, and earns its profit from sales commissions. A firm-commitment under-
writer purchases the securities at a discount, intending to profit by reselling them. Institu-
tional investors and dealers typically purchase new offerings—the former for investment, 
the latter for resale to retail investors.
Private Placement General Solicitation Ban Lifted
In July 2013 the SEC reversed an 80-year-old prohibition on the general solicitation of 
unregistered securities. Private placements, which comprise over 40 percent of all securi-
ties issuances, can now be advertised to anyone, although only accredited investors (dis-
cussed below) can make purchases. Any means of solicitation, including the internet, is 
permitted. Advocates assert that the new rule promotes the ability of start-ups and small 
businesses to raise capital without going through the onerous registration process. Critics 
counter that allowing speculative start-ups and high-risk hedge funds to solicit investments 
through mass marketing will undermine the integrity of the market.48

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  413
 
It seems clear that such conflicts played a role in the 
recent financial crisis—not from their rating of corporate 
bonds, but from their rating of mortgage-backed securities 
(investment vehicles based on the performance of a pool 
of mortgages). According to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Re-
port, “Failures in credit rating and securitization trans-
formed bad mortgages into toxic financial assets.”49 
Congressional hearings uncovered internal e-mails con-
taining such statements as “sold our soul to the devil for 
revenue” (Moody’s) and “let’s hope we are all wealthy and 
retired by the time this house of cards falters” (Standard & 
Poor’s).50
 
So far the government has accomplished nothing in 
terms of new regulation.51 Nonetheless, the agencies are 
facing a federal suit for fraud52 and have become the sub-
ject of several lawsuits, including one for over $1 billion, all 
related to their top-tier ratings of various mortgage-backed 
securities and other credit derivatives.53
Question
A bondholder would be concerned about whether a corpo-
ration has purchased a favorable bond rating. Should a 
shareholder also be worried? Explain.
Exemptions
Exempt securities and exempt transactions do not require registration with the SEC. The 
most common exempt securities are those issued by governments, charities, educational 
institutions, and financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies. Thus, they 
have little application to most businesses.
 
Certain transactions, however, are also exempt from at least some of the registration 
requirements. Depending on the exemption, the presale disclosures and filings with the 
SEC range from none to something only slightly less than a full registration statement. 
Most exemptions do not permit general advertising or solicitation.
 
Five long-standing categories of exempt transactions were created at least in part as an 
accommodation to small issuers, such as private and closely held businesses, to lessen the 
financial burdens of raising capital. (See the text box to follow for a discussion of the new 
crowdfunding exemption.) For example, all intrastate offerings are exempt transactions. 
There is a statutory exemption for purely private offerings, but it can sometimes be prob-
lematic to determine whether a particular offering will be considered private or public. 
Thus, small issuers are more likely to rely on one of the regulatory exemptions created by 
the SEC. Rules 504 (which exempts transactions with an aggregate offering amount of 
$1 million or less) and 505 (which exempts certain transactions with an aggregate offering 
amount of up to $5 million) are little used. The workforce is Rule S06, for which there is 
no amount limitation, but which can involve only accredited investors and up to 35 sophis-
ticated investors. Accredited investors are individuals with a net worth over $1 million or 
with an income in excess of $200,000 (or married with a combined income of $300,000) 
for at least two years with the expectation of similar income in the current year. A sophis-
ticated investor is one who has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to 
be able to evaluate the merits and risks of an investment (or a person advised by a party 
with such expertise). Institutional investors are also deemed accredited.
 
Note that even when exemptions apply to registration under the 1933 Act, the act’s 
sweeping antifraud provisions (discussed later) still apply.

Retail Securities Crowdfunding Emerges
Securities crowdfunding is the use of the Internet to raise capital, with each contributor 
investing a comparatively small amount. Until recently it has been limited to no-interest 
loans and donations because, if a return is provided (e.g., dividends or interest), the securi-
ties laws require the investment’s registration with the SEC.54
 
Retail Securities crowdfunding was authorized by the 2012 JOBS Act through a new 
registration exemption. Companies will be allowed to raise up to $1 million annually by 
selling stock via the Internet using “intermediaries” (SEC-regulated third parties, which 
will manage the process). Individuals will be limited in the amount they can invest each 
year. For example, those whose annual income and net worth are both less than $100,000 
will be permitted to invest 5 percent of the greater of those amounts (but not more than 
$2,000). Companies must disclose information about their business, their officers and di-
rectors, and how they will use the money. Audited financial statements are required if the 
amount to be raised exceeds $500,000. Nonetheless, the disclosure requirements are sub-
stantially less than those applicable to conventional initial public offerings (IPOs).55
 
The retail securities crowdfunding rules are controversial. Many are concerned about 
hucksters defrauding the naïve and financially unsophisticated investor. Others complain 
of the burdensome transaction and compliance costs. For example, simply raising $100,000 
could cost $18,000, and over five years, $1 million of funding could cost $300,000.56
 
The SEC has not yet finalized the rules that will allow retail securities crowdfunding to 
begin. In frustration, Michigan, Georgia, and Kansas enacted their own versions, and other 
states are considering doing so.57
 
It remains to be seen whether retail securities crowdfunding  can become a viable option 
for “democratizing” the capital markets.
The Secondary Securities Markets
Once a security is issued, it can be sold repeatedly. Such sales may be accomplished on a 
physical exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), where agents of buy-
ers and sellers deal directly with each other. Others may be made on an over-the-counter 
market, where trades occur electronically over a computer network linking dealers across 
the nation. An example is NASDAQ, the National Association of Securities Dealers Auto-
matic Quotation system. [To learn more about these exchanges, see https://nyse.nyx.com/ 
and www.nasdaq.com]
 
The federal law that governs these trades is the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 
Act), which also created the SEC. Its purposes are the same as those of its 1933 counter-
part: (1) to ensure full disclosure of all material information so the market can make in-
formed investment decisions and (2) to prevent fraudulent conduct in the markets. A 
company is generally subject to the 1934 Act’s reporting requirements if it has publicly 
traded securities and it has both more than $10 million in assets and more than 500 nonac-
credited shareholders.58
 
To promote full disclosure, the SEC requires registered corporations to file a variety 
of reports. Annually, each must file a Form 10-K, which includes information very 

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  415
 similar to that found in a 1933 Act registration statement, including audited financial 
statements. Recall, as discussed in Part Two, that the Dodd–Frank Act added new disclo-
sure requirements, such as the ratio of the CEO’s compensation to that of the  median 
compensation for all other employees. To increase the timeliness of information disclo-
sures, the SEC requires additional reports, such as the quarterly Form 10-Q and Form 
8-K. The latter is required whenever a material event occurs, such as a change in control, 
a major asset acquisition or disposition, bankruptcy, a change in auditor, and the resigna-
tion of the director.59 [To retrieve filings for specific corporations, see www.sec.gov
/edgar.shtml]
 
Not only are certain disclosures mandated, but all corporate communications are subject 
to regulatory standards. The SEC’s Regulation FD requires companies to disseminate ma-
terial information in a way that rapidly reaches the general public and gives no one an ad-
vantage. In April 2013, the SEC approved the use of social media such as Twitter and 
Facebook for such dissemination, as long as the company has previously advised the pub-
lic what social media outlets it will use.60
 
Under the 1934 Act, the SEC has the power to suspend trading in any security “when it 
serves the public interest and will protect investors.” Thus, the SEC may suspend trading 
if it suspects price manipulation or has serious questions about a company’s assets or 
 operations.61 Typically, the market price of a security is devastated by a suspension, which 
provides a strong incentive for corporations to avoid misconduct.
Brokers and Online Trading
When individuals want to buy or sell securities listed on an exchange, they may do so 
through an intermediary—a broker. In addition to facilitating trades, brokers may provide 
advisory services and assess the suitability of investments for a particular investor. That is, 
they make recommendations and trades taking into account the investor’s needs, financial 
situation, investment objectives, and risk tolerance.
Occasionally, a broker has faced charges of churning— repeatedly 
and unnecessarily engaging in trades to generate commissions. In 
one case, an 80-year-old woman with Alzheimer’s disease entrusted 
$500,000 to a broker. Fourteen months later, the account was worth 
only $15,000. The broker had engaged in over 300 trades and 
charged the account $94,000 in fees, purchasing only high-tech stocks (versus a balanced, 
conservative portfolio more appropriate to her situation).62
 
One impact of the Internet was the bypassing of full-service securities brokers through 
online trading. In response, most major full-service brokers added online trading services, 
which can be less expensive, but which also tend to leave investors without professional 
guidance.
 
Matters get worse when it comes to day trading. Day traders rarely hold any security 
more than a few hours, earning profits by exploiting volatility, not inherent value. It has 
been reported that only about 10 percent of day traders are successful.63 The SEC has ex-
pressed great concern about advertising that suggests day trading is easy and certain to be 
profitable. It cautions that tips and analyses are frequently false.64 Nonetheless, the market 
has moved inexorably toward global, 24-hour-a-day, electronic trading.

Violating Federal Securities Laws
The consequences for noncompliance with the securities laws are potentially stagger-
ing, including damages and civil and criminal penalties. Some of the provisions most 
commonly violated by corporations and their directors and executives are discussed 
below.
False or Misleading Statements in Required Filings—1933 Act
Perhaps the greatest deterrent to misconduct in the securities laws is the civil liability 
that can be imposed on wrongdoers by harmed investors. The 1933 Act’s Section 11 
establishes this liability with respect to false or misleading registration statements.
 
Virtually anyone with a significant role in preparing the registration statement can be 
sued (the issuer, its directors, its underwriters, and its accountants and other experts). The 
liability can be vast—essentially all damages sustained by investors while the misleading 
registration statements were outstanding. No proof of plaintiff reliance on the content of 
the registration statement is required. Accounting firms and investment bankers, because 
of their “deep pockets,” are often at the top of the list of defendants. Accounting firms have 
paid hundreds of millions of dollars to settle securities fraud suits.
 
The principal defense against a Section 11 claim is due diligence. Every defendant, 
other than the issuer, can raise this defense. The defendant must show that, based on a 
reasonable investigation, he or she reasonably believed that the registration statement was 
not misleading. What constitutes “reasonable” is determined by reference to the conduct 
expected of a prudent person in the management of his or her own property.
 
The due diligence standard for experts (like accountants and lawyers) is much higher. 
Their inquiries must rise to the standards expected of professionals, not merely of prudent 
businesspersons. Thus, at an absolute minimum, an accounting firm that has audited the fi-
nancial statements included in the registration statement must design its audit process to 
comport with GAAS and must evaluate the financial statement content in accordance with 
GAAP. Lawyers, actuaries, appraisers, and other experts whose work has a material impact 
on the registration statement must follow analogous rules established by their professional 
associations and regulators. The BarChris case, below, explores the due diligence defense.
Escott v. BarChris 
Construction Corporation
283 F.Supp. 643 (S.D.N.Y. 1968)
problems. It filed a registration statement (effective May 
1961) for new bonds to raise cash and the bonds were is-
sued. Circumstances were grave when the registration 
statement became effective. BarChris filed for bankruptcy in 
October 1962.
FACTS
Bowling as a leisure activity and sport grew rapidly in the 
1950s. BarChris built alleys. Its revenues grew from $800,000 
in 1956 to $9,165,000 in 1960. By 1962 overbuilding caused 
construction to halt. BarChris ran into serious financial 
L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  417
 
BarChris’s financial statements dated December 31, 1960, 
were included in the prospectus. They were audited by Peat, 
Marwick (predecessor to KPMG) and contained material er-
rors. Revenues and current assets were overstated and con-
tingent liabilities were understated.
 
The prospectus overstated the demand for alley con-
struction. It misrepresented how the proceeds would be 
used (a large portion of which would actually go to pay 
overdue debts and retire loans from officers). It failed to 
note that, because of defaults, BarChris was now operating 
several alleys. Escott and other bondholders sued under 
Section 11 of the 1933 Act, alleging the prospectus was 
 materially misleading. All defendants but BarChris raised 
the due diligence defense.
Judge Mclean
I turn now to the question of whether defendants have proved 
their due diligence defenses. The position of each defendant 
will be separately considered.
Russo
Russo was, to all intents and purposes, the chief executive of-
ficer of BarChris. He was a member of the executive commit-
tee. He was familiar with all aspects of the business. . . . [He] 
knew all the relevant facts. He could not have believed that 
there were no untrue statements or material omissions in the 
prospectus. Russo has no due diligence defenses.
Vitolo and Pugliese
They were the founders. . . . Vitolo was president and Pugliese 
was vice president. Despite their titles, their [control] over 
BarChris’s affairs [was far less] than Russo’s. [They are] each 
men of limited education. It is not hard to believe that for them 
the prospectus was difficult reading, if indeed they read it at 
all. But [the] liability of a director who signs a registration 
statement does not depend upon whether or not he read it or, 
if he did, whether or not he understood what he was reading.
 
And in any case, Vitolo and Pugliese were not as naive as 
they claim to be. They were members of BarChris’s executive 
committee. . . . They must have known what was going on. 
 Certainly they knew of the inadequacy of cash. . . . They knew 
of their own large advances to the company which remained 
unpaid. They knew that they had agreed not to deposit their 
checks until the financing proceeds were received. They 
knew and intended that part of the proceeds were to be used 
to pay their own loans.
 
All in all, [their situation] is not significantly different . . . 
from Russo’s. They could not have believed that the registra-
tion statement was wholly true and that no material facts had 
been omitted. . . . They have not proved their due diligence 
defenses.
Trilling
[Trilling was . . . a CPA and former member of Peat,  Marwick. 
He was BarChris’] controller. He signed the registration state-
ment in that capacity, although he was not a director. . . . 
 
Trilling may well have been unaware of several of the inac-
curacies in the prospectus. But he must have known of some 
of them. . . . I cannot find that Trilling believed the entire pro-
spectus to be true.
 
But even if he did, he still did not establish his due diligence 
defenses. He . . . failed to prove, as to the [nonaudited] parts of 
the prospectus . . ., that he made a reasonable investigation 
which afforded him a reasonable ground to believe that it was 
true. As far as appears, he made no investigation. . . .  This 
would have been well enough but for the fact that he signed 
the registration statement. As a signer, he could not avoid re-
sponsibility. . . . [He has not proved] his due diligence defenses.
Birnbaum
Birnbaum was a young lawyer [employed as in-house counsel. 
He was] secretary and a director. . . . He signed the later 
amendments [to the registration statement], thereby becoming 
responsible for the accuracy of the prospectus. . . . 
 
 . . . He did not participate in the management of the com-
pany. As house counsel, he attended to legal matters of a rou-
tine nature. . . . 
 
One of Birnbaum’s more important duties . . . was to keep 
the corporate minutes. . . . This necessarily informed him to a 
considerable extent about the company’s affairs. . . . 
 
It seems probable that Birnbaum did not know of many of the 
inaccuracies in the prospectus. He must, however, have 
 appreciated some of them. In any case, he made no 
investigation. . . . [He] was entitled to rely upon Peat, Marwick for 
the 1960 figures. . . . But he was not entitled to rely upon [anyone 
else] for the other portions of the prospectus. As a lawyer, he 
should have known his obligations. . . . Having failed to make such 
an investigation, he did not have reasonable ground to believe 
that all these statements were true. Birnbaum has not established 
his due diligence defenses except as to the audited 1960 figures.
Auslander
Auslander was an “outside” director. . . . He was chairman . . . 
of Valley Stream National Bank. [He became a director 
shortly before the sale of the bonds. He signed the 
 registration statement.]
 
 . . . As to the [financial statements], Auslander knew that 
Peat, Marwick had audited [them, so he] believed them to be 
correct. . . . He had no reasonable ground to believe otherwise.

418  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
 
As to the [non-audited portions of the prospectus], how-
ever, Auslander is in a different position. . . . [He] made no in-
vestigation of the accuracy of the prospectus. He relied on the 
assurance of Vitolo and Russo. . . . 
 
It is true that Auslander became a director on the eve of 
the financing. He had little opportunity to familiarize himself 
with the company’s affairs. . . . 
 
Section 11 imposes liability . . . upon a director, no matter 
how new he is. He is presumed to know his responsibility 
when he becomes a director. He can escape liability only by 
using that reasonable care to investigate the facts which a 
prudent man would employ in the management of his own 
property. In my opinion, a prudent man would not act in an 
important matter . . . in sole reliance upon representations of 
persons who are comparative strangers. . . . To say that such 
minimal conduct measures up to the statutory standard would, 
to all intents and purposes, absolve new directors from re-
sponsibility merely because they are new. This is not a sensi-
ble construction of Section 11….
 
Auslander has not established his due diligence defense 
[except as to the financial statements].
Grant
… [Grant’s] law firm was counsel to BarChris in matters pertain-
ing to the registration of securities. Grant drafted the registration 
statement. . . . As the director most directly concerned with writ-
ing [it] and assuring its accuracy, more was required of him in 
the way of reasonable investigation than could fairly be expected 
of a director who had no connection with this work. . . .
 
. . . I find that Grant honestly believed that the registration 
statement was true and that no material facts had been omit-
ted from it.
 
In this belief he was mistaken, and the fact is that for all his 
work, he never discovered any of the errors or omissions 
which . . . could have been detected without an audit. The 
question is whether, despite his failure to detect them, Grant 
made a reasonable effort to that end.
 
. . . BarChris’s affairs had changed for the worse. . . . Grant 
never discovered this. He accepted the assurances of [others] 
that any change which might have occurred had been for the 
better. . . .
 
It is claimed that a lawyer is entitled to rely on the state-
ments of his client. . . . This is too broad a generalization. It is all 
a matter of degree. To require an audit would obviously be 
 unreasonable. On the other hand, to require a check of matters 
easily verifiable is not unreasonable. Even honest clients can 
make mistakes. The statute imposes liability for untrue state-
ments regardless of whether they are intentionally untrue. . . .
 
. . . Grant knew that minutes of certain meetings of the 
BarChris executive committee held in 1961 had not been 
 written up. . . . Grant did not insist that the minutes be written 
up, nor did he look at Kircher’s notes. . . .
 
. . . He knew that BarChris was short of cash, but he had 
no idea how short. He did not know that BarChris was with-
holding delivery of checks already drawn and signed be-
cause there was not enough money in the bank to pay 
them. He did not know that the officers of the company in-
tended to use immediately approximately one-third of the 
financing proceeds in a manner not disclosed in the pro-
spectus, including approximately $1,000,000 in paying old 
debts. . . .
 
Grant was entitled to rely on Peat Marwick for the 1960 fig-
ures. [But as to the rest of the prospectus, Grant] was obliged 
to make a reasonable investigation. I am forced to find that he 
did not make one. . . . Grant has not established his due dili-
gence defenses except as to the audited 1960 figures.
Peat, Marwick
. . . The part of the registration statement . . . made upon the 
authority of Peat, Marwick as an expert was . . . the 1960 [au-
dited financial statements]. But because the statute  requires 
the court to determine Peat, Marwick’s belief, and the grounds 
thereof, “at the time . . . the registration statement became ef-
fective,” . . . the matter must be viewed as of May 16, 1961. . . .
The 1960 Audit
[The audit] was in general charge of a member of the firm, 
Cummings. . . . Most of the actual work was performed by a 
senior accountant, Berardi, [who was about thirty]. He was not 
yet a C.P.A. He had no previous experience with the bowling 
industry. This was his first job as a senior accountant. . . . 
The S-1 Review
The purpose of reviewing events subsequent to the date of a 
certified balance sheet, [an S-1 review,] is to ascertain 
whether any material change has occurred in the company’s 
financial position which should be disclosed in order to pre-
vent the . . . figures from being misleading. The scope of such 
a review [is not] a complete audit.
 
Peat, Marwick prepared a written program [which] con-
formed to generally accepted auditing standards. . . . 
 
Berardi made the S-1 review in May 1961. He devoted a 
little over two days to it. . . . He did not discover any of the 
 errors or omissions. . . . The question is whether, despite his 
failure to find out anything, his investigation was reasonable 
within the meaning of the statute.
 
What Berardi did was not look at a . . . trial balance as of 
March 31, 1961[,] compare it with the audited December 31, 
1960 figures, discuss with Trilling certain unfavorable develop-
ments[,] and read certain minutes. He did not examine any 
[other] “important financial records.” . . .

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  419
 
In substance, what Berardi did is . . . [he] asked questions, 
he got answers which he considered satisfactory, and he did 
nothing to verify them. . . . 
 
Berardi had no conception of how tight the cash position 
was. He did not discover that BarChris was holding up checks in 
substantial amounts because there was no money in the bank to 
cover them. He did not know of . . . the officers’ loans. Since he 
never read the prospectus, he was not even aware that there 
had ever been any problem about loans from officers. . . . 
 
There had been a material change for the worse in 
BarChris’s financial position. That change was sufficiently se-
rious so that the failure to disclose it made the 1960 figures 
misleading. Berardi did not discover it. As far as results were 
concerned, his S-1 review was useless.
 
Accountants should not be held to a standard higher than 
that recognized in their profession. I do not do so here. Berar-
di’s review did not come up to that standard. He did not take 
some of the steps which Peat, Marwick’s written program 
 prescribed. He did not spend an adequate amount of time on a 
task of this magnitude. Most important of all, he was too easily 
satisfied with glib answers to his inquiries.
 
. . . [T]here were enough danger signals in the materials 
which he did examine to require some further investigation on 
his part. Generally accepted accounting standards required 
such further investigation under these circumstances. It is not 
always sufficient merely to ask questions.
 
Here again, the burden of proof is on Peat, Marwick. I find 
that that burden has not been satisfied. I conclude that Peat, 
Marwick has not established its due diligence  defense.
Questions
1. a.  Why were so many defendants not held responsible for 
the misleading audited financial statements?
 
b.  Which defendants were not successful in claiming the 
due diligence defense with respect to these  financial 
statements? Why were they denied the  defense?
2. Does being “new” make any difference in terms of directorial 
liability for a signed registration statement?
3. What would you do differently in the future if you were 
Peat, Marwick?
False or Misleading Statements in Required Filings—1934 Act
Section 18 of the 1934 Act, relating to false or misleading statements in any filing required to 
maintain the registration of a security, is similar to the 1933 Act’s Section 11. However, the only 
defense offered by Section 18 is that the defendant acted in good faith, without knowledge of the 
false or misleading nature of the statement. Furthermore, unlike the 1933 Act’s Section 11 
where reliance by the plaintiff on the false or misleading statements is presumed, under the 1934 
Act’s Section 18 the plaintiff must prove that he or she relied on the statements.
Fraud
Under the 1933 Act’s Section 17(a) and the 1934 Act’s Section 10(b) and its related Rule 
10b-5, it is illegal, in connection with the sale or purchase of any security, to employ any 
scheme or to engage in any practice that defrauds another person 
participating in the  financial  markets. These provisions intention-
ally cast a “broad net” and can reach such Ponzi schemes as the one 
run by Bernard Madoff, who in 2009 was sentenced to 150 years in 
prison for perpetrating a $50 billion fraud. In essence he promised 
very lucrative rates of return to investors, which returns were paid out of funds collected 
from an ever-increasing pool of new investors. When the economy turns down, such 
schemes collapse, revealing just how widespread the phenomenon is. More than 150 im-
ploded in 2009, compared with about 40 in 2008.65
 
Fraudulent acts can be committed by corporate wrongdoers as well. For example, mak-
ing misleading statements about material facts or failing to state material facts in required 
SEC disclosure documents or in other company communications can be fraudulent, pro-
viding powerful grounds for damage suits by harmed investors. Large companies have

paid substantial settlements in lawsuits arising from the recent 
 financial collapse. For example, in 2009 Merrill Lynch settled a suit 
for $475 million with investors who alleged that it had understated 
its subprime debt exposure. Wells Fargo agreed in 2011 to pay $85 
million to settle Federal Reserve claims that the firm pushed borrowers toward unnecessar-
ily costly mortgage loans and falsified data in mortgage applications. In late 2013, J. P. Mor-
gan agreed to pay $4.5 billion to settle charges that it misled investors in a complicated deal 
involving pooled mortgages.66
 
Bringing forward direct evidence of reliance on fraudulent statements can be difficult, so 
the fraud-on-the-market theory has evolved. It is the subject of the Basic, Inc. case below.
Basic Inc. v. Levinson et al. 
485 U.S. 224 (1988)
have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having signifi-
cantly altered the ‘total mix’ of information made available.” . . .
* * * * *
We turn to the question of reliance and the fraud-on-the-mar-
ket theory. Succinctly put:
The fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis 
that, in an open and developed securities market, the price 
of a company’s stock is determined by the available material 
information regarding the company and its business. . . . 
Misleading statements will therefore defraud purchasers . . 
. even if [they] do not directly rely on the misstatements. . . . 
The causal connection between the defendants’ fraud and 
the plaintiffs’ purchase . . . is no less significant than in a 
case of direct reliance on misrepresentations.
* * * * *
 
. . . Requiring proof of individualized reliance from each 
member of the proposed plaintiff class . . . would have pre-
vented . . . a class action, since individual issues . . . would 
have overwhelmed the common ones. The District Court found 
that the presumption of reliance created by the fraud-on-the-
market theory provided “a practical resolution to the problem 
of balancing the [need for] proof of reliance [against] the pro-
cedural [obstacles].” …
 
. . . Reliance provides the requisite causal connection be-
tween a defendant’s misrepresentation and a plaintiff’s injury. 
There is, however, more than one way to demonstrate the 
causal connection. . . .
 
The modern securities markets, literally involving millions 
of shares changing hands daily, differ from the face-to-face 
FACTS
Prior to December 20, 1978, Basic Inc., was a publicly traded 
company primarily engaged in the business of manufacturing 
chemical refractories for the steel industry. As early as 1965 or 
1966, Combustion Engineering, Inc., a company producing 
mostly alumina-based refractories, expressed some interest in 
acquiring Basic, but was deterred from pursuing this inclina-
tion seriously because of antitrust concerns. Beginning in 
1976, Combustion had meetings with Basic concerning the 
possibility of a merger. During 1977 and 1978, Basic made 
three public statements denying merger negotiations. On De-
cember 19, 1978, Basic’s board endorsed the merger.
 
Respondents were former Basic shareholders who sold 
their stock after Basic’s first public denial but before the De-
cember 1978 announcement. They asserted that the defend-
ants issued three false or misleading public statements in 
violation of Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and of Rule 10b-5 and, 
further, that they were injured by selling Basic shares at artifi-
cially depressed prices in a market affected by petitioners’ 
misleading statements and in reliance thereon.
 
Rule 10b-5 provides that it “shall be unlawful [t]o make any 
untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material 
fact necessary . . . to make the statements made . . . not 
 misleading . . . in connection with the purchase or sale of any 
security.”

transactions contemplated by early fraud cases, and our 
 understanding of Rule 10b-5’s reliance requirement must en-
compass these differences.
 
With the presence of a market, the market is interposed 
between seller and buyer and, ideally, transmits information to 
the investor in the processed form of a market price. Thus the 
market is performing a substantial part of the valuation pro-
cess performed by the investor in a face-to-face transaction. 
The market is acting as the unpaid agent of the investor, in-
forming him that given all the information available to it, the 
value of the stock is worth the market price.
* * * * *
 
Presumptions typically serve to assist courts in managing 
circumstances in which direct proof, for one reason or an-
other, is rendered difficult. The courts below accepted a pre-
sumption, created by the fraud-on-the-market theory and 
subject to rebuttal by petitioners, that persons who had traded 
Basic shares had done so in reliance on the integrity of the 
price set by the market, but because of petitioners’ material 
misrepresentations that price had been fraudulently de-
pressed. Requiring a plaintiff to show . . . how he would have 
acted if omitted material information had been disclosed . . . or 
if the misrepresentation had not been made, . . . would place 
an unnecessarily unrealistic evidentiary burden on the Rule 
10b-5 plaintiff who has traded on an impersonal market.
 
. . . The presumption of reliance employed in this case is 
consistent with . . . congressional policy embodied in the 1934 
Act. In drafting that Act, Congress expressly relied on the 
premise that securities markets are affected by information, 
and enacted legislation to facilitate an investor’s reliance on 
the integrity of those markets. . . .
 
. . . Recent empirical studies . . . confirm Congress’ premise 
that the market price . . . on well-developed markets reflects 
all publicly available information, and, hence, any material 
misrepresentations. . . . Because most publicly available infor-
mation is reflected in market price, an investor’s reliance on 
any public material misrepresentations, therefore, may be pre-
sumed for purposes of a Rule 10b-5 action.
* * * * *
 
Any showing that severs the link between the alleged mis-
representation and [the] decision to trade fair market price will 
be sufficient to rebut the presumption of reliance. For example, 
. . . if, despite petitioners’ allegedly fraudulent attempt to ma-
nipulate market price, news of the merger discussions credi-
bly entered the market and dissipated the effects of the 
misstatements, those who traded Basic shares after the cor-
rective statements would have no direct or indirect connec-
tion with the fraud. . . .
 
In summary: . . . It is not inappropriate to apply a presump-
tion of reliance supported by the fraud-on-the-market theory. 
That presumption, however, is rebuttable.

opinion.]

action?

reliance in fact on a material omission?

problem?
AFTERWORD
As noted by the Court in Basic, Inc. and confirmed by the 
 Seventh Circuit, investors who trade with knowledge of alleged 
misrepresentations will not be allowed to use the fraud-on-the-
market theory. Those investors have not relied on the market 
price as an accurate reflection of material information.67 In its 
2014 decision in   Halliburton v. Erica P. John Fund, the Supreme 
Court rejected the defendant’s argument that the efficient mar-
kets hypothesis on which Basics, Inc. is grounded had been 
discredited by the financial crisis and various studies. In re-
sponse, the court noted that Basic, Inc. recognized that markets 
are only imperfectly efficient and “based the presumption on 
the fairly modest premise that ‘market professionals generally 
consider most publicly announced material statements about 
companies, [which] affect [s] stock . . . prices.’”68
Insider Trading
Classical illegal insider trading occurs when an “insider” breaches a fiduciary duty to share-
holders by buying or selling a security while in possession of material, nonpublic information 
about the security. An insider is often a director, officer, or an employee of an issuer, but could 
also be someone who only temporarily has a confidential relationship with an issuer, such as an 

422  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
attorney, accountant, or consultant. The prohibition against trading on undisclosed inside infor-
mation is based on Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act, which prohibits the use of any manipulative 
or deceptive device in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.
 
In recent years, prosecution of insider trading violations has increased substantially and 
headlines have often followed. Publicized incidents have run from sports to sex and from 
intricate and clandestine to sad to ridiculous and nearly everything else along the way:
• In the most high-profile insider-trading case in many years, billionaire Galleon Group 
hedge fund manager, Raj Rajaratnam, was convicted in 2011 on 14 counts of fraud and 
conspiracy that allegedly netted some $65 million in profits and losses averted. Rajarat-
nam allegedly tapped into a web of contacts in top-tier American businesses to secure 
information not publicly known.69
• In a related case, former Goldman Sachs director Rajat Gupta was sentenced in October 
2012 to two years in prison for leaking inside information to Rajaratnam.70
• In November 2013, hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors pleaded guilty to criminal insider 
trading and agreed to pay a record $1.8 billion penalty.71
• A partner at Ernst & Young (EY) developed a relationship with a woman he found 
through a website for those in search of extramarital affairs. She testified against him in 
the trial in which he was convicted of insider trading. She had pled guilty to trading on 
information he passed to her, and she had agreed to cooperate with the government.72
• A respected, retired business school professor from St. John’s University, who was a 
popular lecturer at a number of Wall Street firms, was accused by the SEC of passing 
inside information to another business professor at Pace University.73
• An executive secretary at Walt Disney and her boyfriend were charged with insider 
trading after sending 33 letters to investment firms offering to sell Disney’s quarterly 
earnings reports before they were publicly released. A follow-up e-mail stated, “I was 
thinking $20,000 is a fair compensation but you are free to make an offer.” Multiple 
hedge funds receiving the offer reported it to the SEC.74
 
The Texas Gulf Sulphur case below expresses the rule for those possessing inside 
 information—either disclose the information or refrain from trading until the information is 
public.
SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co.
401 F.2d 833 (2d Cir. 1968)
On April 12, 1964, when the stock had passed $30 and when 
the best estimate was 8 million recoverable tons, TGS issued a 
press release naysaying the rumors. On April 16, a Canadian 
mining journal story, based on an April 13 site visit and inter-
view, put the tonnage at 10 million. On the same day a Canadian 
government official, based on information current through 
April 15, put the tonnage at 25 million in a public  announcement. 
FACTS
On November 12, 1963, TGS drilled a “discovery hole,” K-55-1, 
in Canada which revealed possibly one of the largest ore 
strikes in history. Insiders (geologists at the drill site, certain 
company officers, and so on) began buying TGS stock at 
around $18. Lab testing and further test-hole drilling fully con-
firmed the magnitude of the strike. Rumors began to circulate.

of their stock purchases . . . virtually compels the inference 
that the insiders were influenced by the drilling results. . . .
* * * * *
 
We hold, therefore, that all transactions in TGS stock . . . by 
individuals apprised of the drilling results of K-55-1 were made 
in violation of Rule 10b-5. . . .

. . . Coates, who placed orders . . . immediately after the 
official announcement . . . , [contends that his] purchases were 
not proscribed purchases for the news had already been . . . 
disclosed. We disagree.
 
. . . The reading of [the announcement] . . . is merely the first 
step in the process of dissemination required for compliance 
with the regulatory objective of providing all investors with an 
equal opportunity to make informed investment judgments. . . . 
[A]t the minimum Coates should have waited until the news 
could reasonably have been expected to appear over the me-
dia of widest circulation, the Dow Jones broad tape, rather 
than hastening to insure an advantage to himself. . . .
Questions
1. If you possess undisclosed inside information, what are 
your options for trading in the company’s stock?
2. How soon after disclosure can an insider trade in the stock?
AFTERWORD
As stated by the Texas Gulf Sulphur court, the rule prohibits one 
who has access to information that was available to them only 
for a corporate purpose from trading in corporate securities 
with those who do not have that knowledge. This is the classical 
theory of insider trading. Officers and employees, for example, 
have a fiduciary duty not to use their principal’s—that is, their 
employer’s—information for personal gain.

On this day the stock passed $36. By May 15, it exceeded $58. 
The SEC brought an insider-trading suit.
Judge Waterman
* * * * *
[Rule 10b-5] is based . . . on the justifiable expectation . . . that 
all investors trading on impersonal exchanges have relatively 
equal access to material information. . . . The essence of the 
Rule is that anyone who, trading for his own account [has 
 access] to information intended to be available only for a 
 corporate purpose . . . may not take “advantage of such . . . 
knowing it is unavailable to those with whom he is dealing,” 
i.e., the investing public. Insiders . . . are, of course[,]  precluded 
from so unfairly dealing, but the Rule is also applicable to one 
possessing the information who may not be strictly termed an 
“insider.” . . . [A]nyone in possession of material inside infor-
mation must either disclose it to the investing public [or] ab-
stain from trading in or recommending the securities [while it] 
remains undisclosed. . . .
 
. . . An insider’s duty to disclose [or] abstain . . . arises only 
in “those situations . . . which are reasonably certain to have a 
substantial effect on the market price [if] disclosed.” . . .
* * * * *
 
. . . [W]hether facts are material [will depend] upon a bal-
ancing of both the indicated probability that the event will oc-
cur and the anticipated magnitude of the event. . . . [Here,] 
knowledge of the possibility, which surely was more than mar-
ginal, of the existence of a mine of the vast magnitude indi-
cated by the remarkably rich drill core . . . would certainly have 
been an important fact to a reasonable . . . investor in deciding 
whether he should buy, sell, or hold. . . . 
* * * * *
 
Finally, a major factor in determining whether the K-55-1 
discovery was a material fact is the importance attached to 
the drilling results by those who knew about it. [T]he timing . . . 
Tippees
The insider concept has been extended to include tippees. In some cases, the tipper (the 
insider or an “upstream” tippee) intends to improperly convey the inside information to a 
third party and hopes to derive personal benefit therefrom. In such a case both the tipper 
and tippee are fully liable. In other cases, the tippee is deemed to “misappropriate” the 
inside information from the inadvertent tipper, knowing that it was confidential. This 
would occur, for example, if a psychiatrist learned material inside information during a 
session with a senior corporate executive and traded on that information. Here, the tippee, 

424  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
but not the tipper, would be liable. In the O’Hagan case, below, the U.S. Supreme 
Court approved this second theory, the misappropriation theory, that extends insider trading 
to outsiders.
United States v. O’Hagan
521 U.S. 642 (1997)
when he misappropriates confidential information for securi-
ties trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source 
of the information. Under this theory, a fiduciary’s undisclosed, 
self-serving use of a principal’s information to purchase or sell 
securities, in breach of a duty of loyalty and confidentiality, 
defrauds the principal of the exclusive use of that information. 
In lieu of premising liability on a fiduciary relationship between 
company insider and purchaser or seller of the company’s 
stock, the misappropriation theory premises liability on a 
fiduciary-turned-trader’s deception of those who entrusted 
him with access to confidential information.
 
The two theories are complementary, each addressing ef-
forts to capitalize on nonpublic information through the pur-
chase or sale of securities. . . .
 
In this case, the indictment alleged that O’Hagan, in breach of 
a duty of trust . . . he owed to his law firm . . . and to its client . . . , 
traded on the basis of nonpublic information regarding the client’s 
tender offer . . . . This conduct, the Government charged, consti-
tuted a fraudulent device in connection with the purchase and 
sale of securities. . . .
 
We agree . . . . We observe, first, that misappropriators . . . 
deal in deception. A fiduciary who “[pretends] loyalty to the 
principal while secretly converting the principal’s information 
for personal gain” . . . defrauds the principal.
* * * * *
 
We turn next to the Section 10(b) requirement that the mis-
appropriator’s deceptive use of information be “in connection 
with the purchase or sale of [a] security.” This element is sat-
isfied because the fiduciary’s fraud is consummated, not when 
the fiduciary gains the confidential information, but when, 
without disclosure to his principal, he uses the information to 
purchase or sell securities. . . .
* * * * *
 
The misappropriation theory . . . is also well-tuned to an 
animating purpose of the [1934] Act: to insure honest securities 
FACTS
O’Hagan was a partner in the law firm of Dorsey & Whitney. In 
July 1988, Grand Metropolitan retained the firm to represent it 
in a tender offer for Pillsbury stock. O’Hagan did no work on 
this matter. In August, O’Hagan began purchasing Pillsbury 
stock options. He also purchased Pillsbury stock at $39. When 
the tender offer was announced, the price rose to $60. 
O’Hagan sold his options and stock, making a profit of $4.3 mil-
lion. He used the profits to conceal his previous embezzlement 
of unrelated client trust funds.
 
The SEC investigated. O’Hagan was convicted on securi-
ties fraud. The Eighth Circuit reversed, rejecting liability under 
Rule 10b-5 under the “misappropriation theory.” The Supreme 
Court granted certiorari.
 
Section 10(b) proscribes (1) using any deceptive device (2) 
in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. It does 
not confine its coverage to deception of a purchaser or seller; 
rather, it reaches any deceptive device used “in connection 
with the purchase or sale of any security.”
Justice Ginsburg
* * * * *
 
Under the “traditional” or “classical theory” of insider trad-
ing liability, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are violated when [an] 
insider trades in the securities of his corporation on the basis of 
material, nonpublic information. Trading on such information 
qualifies as a “deceptive device” . . . because “a relationship of 
trust [exists] between the shareholders [and the] insiders who 
have obtained confidential information by reason of their position 
with [the] corporation.” That relationship . . . “gives rise to a duty 
to disclose [or to abstain from trading]”. . . .The classical theory 
applies not only to officers, directors, and other permanent 
 insiders . . ., but also to attorneys, accountants, consultants, and 
others who temporarily become fiduciaries of a corporation.
 
The “misappropriation theory” holds that a person com-
mits fraud “in connection with” a securities transaction . . .

informational disparity is inevitable in the securities markets,

propriator . . . stems from contrivance, not luck; it is a disadvan-
tage that cannot be overcome with research or skill. . . .
 
 [Reversed and remanded.]
Questions
1. Are both insider trading theories needed to fulfill the 1934 
Act’s desire to keep the markets “honest”?
2. Both insider trading theories depend heavily on fiduciary 
relationships. Contrast the parties in the fiduciary relation-
ships under the “classical” and “misappropriation” 
 theories.
3. Would it have made any difference if O’Hagan had estab-
lished with his broker, long before this trading, a portfolio 
diversification plan such that, pursuant to the plan, the 
identical trading would have occurred?
Short-Swing Profits
Closely related to insider trading is liability for short-swing profits. An insider trading case 
requires proof that the insider had material inside information and traded to exploit it. A 
short-swing profit case conclusively presumes that the insider had such information and 
did unlawfully trade on it any time the insider engages in any purchase and sale, or sale and 
purchase, of an equity security issued by the insider’s corporation if both transactions occur 
within a six-month period. The insider’s actual motive is irrelevant. The goal is to prevent 
insiders from taking advantage of company information to secure short-term profits.
Securities Law Enforcement Actions
Most of the securities laws violations just discussed can be enforced against the violators 
by harmed private parties seeking damages and by the government seeking civil and/or 
criminal penalties. The SEC brings civil enforcement actions; the Justice Department 
brings criminal enforcement actions. In fact, all three types of suits can be brought against 
the same defendant for the same violation.
Private Enforcement
In civil damage cases harmed plaintiffs typically join together in a class-action lawsuit (see 
Chapter 4). Since the 1990s, actions taken by Congress and, more recently, decisions of the 
Supreme Court have combined to make the bringing of and prevailing in such suits much 
more difficult for injured plaintiffs. Some history may be illuminating.
 
As a consequence of the savings and loan debacle of the 1980s, major accounting firms 
paid out over $1.6 billion in class-action damages. Responding to these payouts, account-
ing firms and others began intense lobbying to curtail such suits. Among other things, they 
argued that law firms specializing in plaintiffs’ securities actions selected and groomed 
“professional plaintiffs” to bring damage suits in which the allegations of wrongdoing 
were primarily supported by a significant drop in the market price of the securities. Then 
after filing a complaint, it was argued, plaintiffs could proceed to discovery and undertake 
“fishing expeditions” until sufficient facts were accumulated to motivate defendants to set-
tle rather than endure litigation.

426  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
 
Some evidence of long-standing systemic abuse by plaintiffs’ lawyers was revealed in 
September 2007 when William Lerach, a former partner of the law firm of Milberg 
Weiss, pleaded guilty to conspiracy. The allegations were that he and other lawyers in 
the firm had paid illegal kickbacks to individuals to serve as named plaintiffs in securi-
ties actions. This often allowed the firm to be the first to file suit, which in turn resulted 
in Milberg Weiss more frequently representing the lead plaintiff in many class action 
cases. The firm’s payoff was a larger share of any legal fees.75 On April 2, 2008, Melyvn 
Weiss, the senior securities law partner at Milberg Weiss, pleaded guilty to similar 
charges pursuant to a plea bargain. He was sentenced to 30 months in prison and fined 
$10 million.
 
The lobbying against runaway securities class-action suits paid off. In December 1995, 
Congress enacted the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (1995 Act). The 1995 Act 
eliminates joint and several liability for accountants and underwriters whose deep pockets 
have historically attracted plaintiffs’ lawyers. It also increased plaintiffs’ procedural hur-
dles in bringing suit. No fraudulent conduct can be presumed from the simple fact that a 
security’s price dropped precipitously. Plaintiffs in their complaints must state with par-
ticularity both the facts that constitute the alleged violation, as well as facts evidencing 
defendant’s intention “to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.”76
 
In early 2008, the Supreme Court reduced the exposure of some noncorporate 
 defendants to claims of aiding and abetting securities fraud. In instances in which plain-
tiffs allege damage based on fraudulent representations by the corporation, third parties 
who may have aided the fraudulent conduct but whose deceptive acts were not commu-
nicated to the public are not liable to private plaintiffs.77 As discussed below, only the 
government can bring such lawsuits. [For more on securities class-action lawsuits, see 
http://securities.stanford.edu]
Government Enforcement
The government can bring suits for aiding and abetting securities fraud against third par-
ties. The Dodd–Frank Act expanded the government’s reach in such cases to any third 
party who, knowingly or recklessly, substantially assists the primary wrongdoer.
 
Whereas private parties sue to recover damages suffered from the wrongdoing, the 
SEC enforces the law by imposing civil penalties up to $750,000 for individuals and 
$15 million for corporations, as well as forcing defendants to give up ill-gotten gains, 
called disgorgement. The SEC may impose a penalty of up to 300 percent of the profit 
gained or loss avoided by insider trading. In addition to imposing monetary penalties, 
the SEC can issue cease-and-desist orders, obtain injunctions against persons commit-
ting securities fraud, and prohibit violators in the future from serving as officers or di-
rectors of publicly traded companies.
 
In contrast, the Department of Justice seeks criminal sanctions for willful (knowing and 
deliberate) violations of the 1933 and 1934 Acts, including fines of up to $25 million and 
imprisonment for up to 20 years. As with criminal statutes in general, the principal prob-
lem for prosecutors is convincing a jury of the defendants’ guilt beyond a reasonable 
doubt. As a result, civil penalties are often substituted for criminal prosecutions.
 
For decades the SEC has permitted parties to settle charges and claims without admit-
ting guilt. In June 2013, Chair Mary Jo White announced that those committing serious 

Chapter Nine  Business Organizations  and Securities Regulation  427
securities law violations would now be required to admit culpability as a prerequisite to 
settlement. J. P. Morgan was among the first to confront this policy when, in September 
2013, it was forced to admit that it had violated the securities laws by permitting an 
“‘egregious’ breakdown” in control and governance.78
Other Regulatory Oversight
Tender Offers
There are several ways to acquire control of a corporation. Where mergers or direct acqui-
sitions fail, a tender offer (also called a takeover) can be attempted. Alternatively, the 
person seeking to acquire control can mount a proxy fight, as discussed in Part Two, by 
nominating an alternative slate of directors and then soliciting shareholders for their annual 
proxies in preference to returning proxies to current management.
 
In a tender offer, the offeror announces that it wishes to acquire a specific number of 
shares (often the number needed to gain control). It identifies where stockholders who 
want to participate must tender (that is, deliver) their shares. (Shares are returned if the 
tender offer fails.) It also specifies the opening bid price. If less than the desired number 
of shares is tendered, the tender offeror can either walk away or increase the offering 
price. Every tendering shareholder will receive the highest price offered by the tender 
offeror.
 
When faced with a tender offer, the target corporation’s management realizes that a suc-
cessful offer will likely result in its dismissal since the offeror will want to put its own 
management in place. Often the target’s management will not be eager to leave. It will re-
sist, which accounts for the term hostile takeover. Management has a problem, however, 
because it is supposed to act exclusively in the best interests of the shareholders and the 
tender offer may well be in their best interests. To avoid liability, management will gener-
ally try to style its resistance as “looking out for the stockholders.”
 
Management can resist in various ways. It could launch its own tender offer (go pri-
vate). Or it could start using corporate cash to buy back shares in the market, driving up the 
price to discourage the tender offeror. Here management has to worry that it could be 
sanctioned for violating Section 9 of the 1934 Act, which prohibits price manipulation. 
There is a safe harbor: Each day management is permitted to purchase up to 25 percent of 
the security’s average daily trading volume.
 
Another resistance tactic is greenmail, in which the target’s management uses corporate 
cash to buy back the tender offeror’s current stake, with a significant premium to “go 
away.” Changes in the federal tax law have discouraged this technique.
 
Management sometimes puts takeover defenses in place by arranging “disasters” if a 
tender offer is attempted. Two notorious tactics are the crown jewel and poison pill de-
fenses. In general, the crown jewel defense involves the target company selling off its 
most attractive assets (its crown jewels). For example, the target company management 
might arrange for a friendly third party to purchase the target’s critical assets at a reason-
able price should a tender offer be launched, thus making the target company less appeal-
ing to the hostile bidder. At the same time, the target company’s management is protected 
because the third party will continue to make these assets available to the company on 

428  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
“friendly” terms should the tender offer fail and management remains in place. Poison pill 
tactics take a variety of forms but one notable strategy gives current shareholders a tender 
offer-triggered right to buy additional stock at a discount, thus diluting the hostile 
 bidder’s shares.
 
If all else fails, the target’s officers may find comfort in the golden parachutes (severance 
pay packages) they may have negotiated to protect themselves in the event of a takeover. The 
Dodd–Frank Act now requires a shareholder vote on such pay packages.
State Securities Regulation
After the enactment of the 1933 Act, the United States operated under a dual  regulatory envi-
ronment for securities. Both the state and federal governments were entitled to regulate the is-
suance of new securities and their subsequent purchases and sales. Eventually the lack of 
regulatory uniformity among the states led Congress in 1996 to enact the National Securities 
Markets Improvement Act, preempting state registration requirements for securities traded on 
national markets. Then in 1998, Congress mandated that securities fraud claims related to 
 national market securities be litigated only in federal court under federal law. State securities 
regulations, known as blue sky laws, are now only a shadow of their former significance and are 
primarily applicable to solely intrastate offerings. [For more on state securities regulation, see 
www.nasaa.org/about-us/our-role/]
International Securities Regulation
Critics claim the United States is losing its place as the world’s leading financial center, 
citing such evidence as the percentage of large IPOs being listed outside of the United 
States. Aggressive regulation in America is often blamed for driving those IPOs abroad.
 
American securities regulation is the world’s strongest, but whether that will continue 
to be true and whether it is responsible for the growth in foreign securities markets is not 
clear. Other factors undoubtedly contribute to the shift, such as the natural maturation of 
international markets, the speed of overall economic growth elsewhere in the world, and 
the concomitant rise in wealth, especially in Europe and Asia.79 “Because companies want 
to list in the fastest-rising markets, many are staying in their home countries, which have 
often outperformed the United States in recent years.”80 Further, stringent regulation in the 
United States is not necessarily a net disincentive for securities registration here. Foreign 
securities with dual listings in the United States and elsewhere appear to enjoy an advan-
tage in the price they command.81 Finally, as the securities markets in other countries ma-
ture, national regulation seems to be increasing in ways that model U.S. policies.
 
Nothing equivalent to the SEC exists in Europe. In the wake of the recent financial crisis, 
however, the European Union may be moving closer to such a body. In 2010, the EU finance 
ministers endorsed the creation of a supervisory structure for European securities markets, 
the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). It began its work on January 1, 
2011. One role it may eventually be called to play is the regulation of audit firms.82 [For

5. Ivan Landreth and his sons owned all of the stock in a lumber business they operated in 
Tonasket, Washington. The owners offered the stock for sale. During that time a fire 
severely damaged the business, but the owners made assurances of rebuilding and mod-

Timber Company, was formed with the senior Landreth remaining as a consultant on the 
side. The new firm was unsuccessful and was sold at a loss. The Landreth Timber Com-
pany then filed suit against Ivan Landreth and his sons seeking rescission of the first sale, 
alleging, among other arguments, that Landreth and sons had widely offered and then 
sold their stock without registering it as required by the Securities Act of 1933. The dis-
trict court acknowledged that stocks fit within the definition of a security, and that the 
stock in question “possessed all of the characteristics of conventional stock.” However, 
it held that the federal securities laws do not apply to the sale of 100 percent of the stock 
of a closely held corporation. Here the district court found that the purchasers had not 
entered into the sale with the expectation of earnings secured via the labor of others. 
Managerial control resided with the purchasers. Thus, the sale was a commercial venture 
rather than a typical investment. The Court of Appeals affirmed, and the case reached the 
Supreme Court. Decide. See Landreth Timber Co. v. Landreth, 471 U.S. 681 (1985).

Antitrust is a word that is only dimly recognizable to most of us, but antitrust law touches 
all corners of our lives and significantly shapes our economic and social practices reaching 
even amateur athletics, as described below.
C H A P T E R  T E N
Four former college athletes representing a class of more 
than 20,000 former college athletes sued the National 
 Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) seeking to change 
NCAA limits on the amount of aid that student athletes can be 
granted. Under long-time NCAA rules, so-called full-ride 
scholarships were limited to tuition, books, room, and board. 
The athletes claimed they were denied approximately $2,500 
annually because their universities were not allowed, under 
NCAA rules, to pay the “full cost of attendance,” a package 
that would include money for insurance, laundry, school sup-
plies, telephone, travel, and so on, in addition to the “full ride.”
 
The class action involved all those playing “major col-
lege football” (what was Division I-A and is now the Football 
Bowl Subdivision) and “major college basketball” (16 top 
P R A C T I C I N G  E T H I C S
More “Pay” for College Athletes?

Chapter Ten  Antitrust Law—Restraints of Trade  435
conferences) since 2002. Total damages were estimated at 
several hundred million dollars. The lawsuit claimed that the 
NCAA rules constituted a “contract, combination, and 
 conspiracy to fix the amount of financial assistance availa-
ble to student athletes,” thus restraining trade in violation of 
section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act (explained below).
 
The case was settled in 2008 when the NCAA agreed, 
among other things, to set aside $10 million over three years to 
be paid to qualified class members (estimated at 12,000) to 
reimburse them for bona fide, future educational expenses. 
Athletes could apply for up to $2,500 per year for three years. 
The settlement also offers athletes easier access to an exist-
ing NCAA pool of $218 million over the years 2008 to 2013 for 
 legitimate educational expenses beyond the “full ride.”
 
As you read this chapter, think about whether the NCAA 
limit on scholarship funds was, in fact, a violation of antitrust 
law, but for our immediate purposes, think about the athletes’ 
complaint as a matter of right and wrong; of fairness. [For 
more on this case, see www.studentathleteclassaction.com]
Questions
1. Was it unfair to deny athletes the additional $2,500 or so 
that they could “earn” in the market for their services 
(playing “major college” football or basketball)? Detail the 
fairness argument for both the athletes and the NCAA.
2. Should college athletes be free to “sell” their services 
to the highest bidder among America’s colleges and 
universities? Explain.
3. Joseph Agnew and Patrick Courtney earned college 
football scholarships but were injured early in their 
 college careers. Consistent with NCAA rules, both 
players were accorded one-year scholarships with the 
possibility of renewal. Neither Agnew nor Courtney re-
ceived scholarship renewals following their injuries. 
Both players sued the NCAA claiming its rules forbid-
ding multiyear scholarships and imposing caps on the 
number of scholarships given per team prevented them 
from securing scholarships that would have covered 
their full college experience.
 
a.  Explain why the two plaintiffs thought they had been 
wronged by the NCAA rules.
 
b.  Do you agree with the two plaintiffs? Explain. See 
Agnew v. National Collegiate Athletic Ass’n., 683 
F.3d 328 (7th Cir. 2012).
4. Ed O’Bannon, former UCLA basketball star, has been 
leading a group of athletes suing the NCAA on antitrust 
grounds seeking a 50 percent share of NCAA television 
royalties from collegiate athletic contests along with a 
share of licensing fees from football and basketball 
video games. Do you think players should receive a 
share of those two income st reams? Explain. [EA 
Sports, creator of the video games, and Collegiate 
 Licensing Company have settled claims that were 
raised against them in the O’Bannon lawsuit for a re-
ported $40 million, which is expected to result in pay-
ments to players of a few hundred dollars each.]

Part One—The Foundations of Antitrust Law
Antitrust—Early Goals
Antitrust, perhaps more than any other branch of the law, is a product of changing political 
and economic tides. Historically, antitrust law sought to allow every American, at least in 
theory, the opportunity to reach the top. More specifically, antitrust advocates were con-
cerned about the following issues:
1. The preservation of competition. Antitrust law was designed to provide free, open 
markets resulting in enhanced efficiency and increased consumer welfare. The belief 

436  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
was (and generally continues to be) that competition would generate the best products 
and services at the lowest possible prices.
2. The preservation of democracy. Many businesses in competition meant that none of 
them could corner economic, political, or social power.
3. The preservation of small businesses, or more generally, the preservation of the 
American Dream. Antitrust was designed to preserve the opportunity for ordinary 
Americans to compete with the giants.
4. An expression of political radicalism. At least for a segment of society, antitrust laws 
were meant to be tools for reshaping America to meet the needs of all people, thus coun-
teracting, to some degree, the power of big business. [For professors’ analyses of recent 
antitrust developments, see http://lawprofessors.typepad.com/antitrustprof_blog]
Antitrust: Balanced Enforcement?
Campaigning in 2008 for his first term, Barack Obama promised to “reinvigorate antitrust 
enforcement,” following what critics took to be a rather passive antitrust policy during the 
George W. Bush years. The first-term Obama antitrust authorities did increase enforce-
ment actions including challenges to several high-profile mergers. In particular, the Justice 
Department’s Antitrust Division sued to block AT&T’s proposed acquisition of T-Mobile, 
a deal the two companies subsequently abandoned. Likewise, in 2013, the Justice Depart-
ment challenged Anheuser-Busch In Bev’s proposed $20 billion takeover of competitor 
Grupo Modelo SAB and the $11 billion US Air and American Airlines merger. (For the 
results of those challenges, see Chapter 11.) Overall, the Justice Department had a record 
seven antitrust cases in litigation in early 2013.
 
On the other hand, critics were incensed by the Federal Trade Commission’s 2013 clo-
sure of its 19-month inquiry into various Google business practices by deciding not to 
pursue charges stemming from the computer giant’s market power. (For details, see 
 Chapter 11.) And only one monopolization case was pursued during Obama’s first term. 
On balance, the Obama administration can certainly make the case that antitrust has 
achieved renewed visibility and importance, although the Obama approach might best be 
labeled “balanced,” with a preference for settlement over litigation.
Antitrust Enforcement and Statutes
The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission bring relatively few antitrust 
actions, but a government victory sends a powerful message to the business community 
about the risks of anticompetitive behavior. The government prefers to avoid litigation, 
and most cases are settled before going to court. 
Furthermore, the Justice Department practices a 
leniency policy sometimes allowing cooperating 
defendants to avoid criminal prosecution. Private 
parties may also sue under the antitrust laws. Seg-
ments of the economy, such as the securities industry, that are already closely regulated by 
the government can sometimes successfully claim that they are immune from the antitrust 
laws. [For the  Justice Department Antitrust Division, see www.usdoj.gov/atr]
A government victory sends a 
powerful message to the 
 business community.

Chapter Ten  Antitrust Law—Restraints of Trade  437
Sherman Antitrust Act, 1890
Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act forbids restraints of trade, and Section 2 forbids 
monopolization, attempts to monopolize, and conspiracies to monopolize. Two types of 
enforcement options are available to the federal government:
1. Violation of the Sherman Act opens participants to criminal penalties. The maxi-
mum corporate fine is $100 million per violation, whereas individuals may be fined 
as much as $1 million and/or imprisoned for up to 10 years.
2. Injunctive relief is provided under civil law. The government or a private party may 
secure a court order preventing continuing violations of the act and affording appropriate 
relief (such as dissolution or divestiture). Those harmed by a violation of the act also may 
bring a civil action seeking three times the actual damages (treble damages)  sustained.
Clayton Act, 1914
The Clayton Act forbids price discrimination, exclusive dealing, tying arrangements, 
 requirements contracts, mergers restraining commerce or tending to create a monopoly, 
and interlocking directorates. Civil enforcement of the Clayton Act is similar to the 
 Sherman Act in that injured parties may sue for injunctive relief and treble damages. In 
general, criminal law remedies are not available under the Clayton Act. [For links to anti-
trust sites worldwide, see www.justice.gov/atr/contact/ otheratr.html]
Federal Trade Commission Act
The Federal Trade Commission Act created a powerful, independent agency designed to 
devote its full attention to the elimination of anticompetitive practices in American com-
merce. The FTC proceeds under the Sherman Act, the Clayton Act, and Section 5 of the 
FTC Act itself, which declares unlawful “unfair methods of competition” and “unfair or 
deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” The commission’s primary enforce-
ment device is the cease and desist order, but fines may be imposed. [For the FTC Guide 
to Antitrust Laws, see www.ftc.gov/bc/antitrust/index.shtm]
Federal Antitrust Law and Other Regulatory Systems
State Law
Most states, through legislation and judicial decisions, have developed their own antitrust 
laws. Some states have recently become more aggressive in antitrust enforcement, as 
 illustrated by their resistance to the U.S. Supreme Court’s controversial Leegin decision set 
out later in this chapter.
Patents, Copyrights, and Trademarks
Each of these devices offers limited, government-granted, government-shielded market 
strength, thus serving to protect and encourage commercial creativity and product develop-
ment. The resulting antitrust problem essentially amounts to limiting the patent, copyright, 
or trademark holder to the terms of its government-granted privilege, rather than allowing 
that privilege to grow into an unlawful monopoly.

438  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
Antitrust Enforcement Produces Lower Prices?
Antitrust law is often of direct value to consumers as illustrated by a 2008 settlement 
 between the U.S. Justice Department and the National Association of Realtors in which the 
NAR guaranteed that realtors participating in the NAR-affiliated multiple listing services 
(MLS—local cooperative arrangements in which realtors list all of their properties for sale 
in a single database) will allow online real estate agents to have full access to those MLS 
listings. The newer Internet-based agents claimed they had often been blocked by local 
MLS associations from access to listings of houses for sale, thus restricting their  ability to 
fully compete with the traditional brokers. The online brokers, often achieving productiv-
ity efficiencies, are able to charge fees about one percentage point beneath the traditional 
industry standard of 5 to 6 percent of the purchase price, thus generating  substantial con-
sumer savings.

Law of Other Nations
Chapter 11 addresses the practical and ideological significance of international antitrust 
issues in this era of globalization. [For a guide to antitrust resources on the Internet, see 
www.antitrustinstitute.org/content/antitrust-resources]
Part Two—Horizontal Restraints
When competitors collude, conspire, or agree among themselves, they are engaging in 
horizontal restraints of trade. Instead of competing to drive prices down and quality up, 
they may be fixing prices, restricting output, dividing territories, and the like. The various 
horizontal restraints are governed by Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which forbids con-
tracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade. What is a  restraint of trade? In 
the Standard Oil1 decision of 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court articulated what has come to 
be known as the rule of reason. In essence, the Court said that the Sherman Act forbids 
only unreasonable restraints of trade. The  reasonableness of a restraint of trade is largely 
determined by a detailed balancing of the pro- and anticompetitive effects of the situation. 
Thus, the plaintiff must prove the existence of an anticompetitive agreement or conduct 
and also prove that, on balance, the  agreement or conduct harms competition. [For an anti-
trust overview, see http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/antitrust]
 
Some antitrust violations, such as horizontal price fixing, are so injurious to 
 competition that their mere existence ordinarily constitutes unlawful conduct. Plaintiffs 
must prove that the violation in question occurred, but they need not prove that the viola-
tion caused, or is likely to cause, competitive harm. These per se violations are simply 
unlawful on their face.

Chapter Ten  Antitrust Law—Restraints of Trade  439
Horizontal Territorial and Customer Restraints
Principal legislation—Sherman Act, Section 1.
Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint 
of trade or commerce, among the several states, or with foreign nations, is declared to be 
illegal . . .
 
Assume two big companies dominate the wholesale food market in their small state. 
Could they lawfully agree between themselves to divide their state geographically with 
one supplying the eastern half while the other supplies only the western half? Or could 
they lawfully allocate their customers such that one, for example, supplies all small town 
grocers while the other  restricts itself to grocers in the few major cities? Suppliers might 
want to eliminate that competition among themselves, but such arrangements ordinarily 
are per se violations of the Sherman Act since they attempt to nullify the powerful benefits 
of competition.
Horizontal Price Fixing
Principal legislation—Sherman Act, Section 1.
 
Competitors may not lawfully agree on prices. That principle is simple and fundamental 
to an efficient, fair marketplace. Establishing the presence of an unlawful price-fixing 
 arrangement, on the other hand, ordinarily is anything but simple.
Proof
The major dilemma in price fixing and all other Sherman Act Section 1 violations is the 
measure of proof that satisfies the requirement of a contract, combination, or conspiracy. 
Evidence of collusion arises in a variety of ways. For example, LaQuinta Inns entered an 
agreement in 2010 with the Connecticut Attorney General to stop its “call around” prac-
tice. Reportedly, motel managers identified their primary local competition and called 
them frequently to give and receive information about occupancy rates and room charges, 
a practice that is widespread in the motel industry. The fear is that the frequent exchange 
of information, in effect, constitutes collusion to fix prices among the competitors. 
LaQuinta agreed to desist from its call around practices throughout the United States.2 
Broadly, a showing of cooperative action amounting to an agreement may be developed by 
any of the following four methods of proof:
1. Agreement with direct evidence. In the easiest case, the government/plaintiff can 
 produce  direct evidence such as writings or testimony from participants proving the 
existence of collusion.
2. Agreement without direct evidence. Here the defendants directly but covertly agree, 
and circumstantial evidence such as company behavior must be employed to draw an 
inference of collusion.

440  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
Poaching Employees
Seven of America’s most prominent high-tech companies, including Apple and Google, 
recently settled a Justice Department complaint alleging that those companies agreed, 
among other things, not to “cold call” each other’s employees for the purpose of hiring 
those employees (a practice sometimes labeled employee poaching). The companies 
agreed to cancel any such agreements. Then in 2013, a civil class action was filed by a 
group of employees claiming those high-tech companies damaged the employees by vio-
lating antitrust laws. News accounts also allege that deceased Apple cofounder Steve Jobs 
threatened to file a patent lawsuit against tech firm Palm if it did not agree to refrain from 
poaching Apple employees.
Questions
1. Why might high- tech companies be particularly concerned about employee poaching?
2. What antitrust claims would the plaintiffs raise?
3. What damages would the plaintiffs allege?
Sources: In Re High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, No. 11-CV-02509-LHK (N.D.Cal. April 18, 2012);  Daniel 
Antalics, “Federal Court Allows Silicon Valley Employee ‘Poaching’ Suit to Proceed,” Weil, Gotshal & Manges 
LLP, Antitrust Update, Spring 2012; and Reuters, “Jobs Threatened Suit to Prevent Apple Poaching,” CNBC.COM, 
January 23, 2013 [www.cnbc.com].
3. Agreement based on a tacit understanding. In this situation no direct exchange of 
assurances occurs, but the parties employ tactics that act as surrogates for direct 
 assurances and thus “tell” each other that they are, in fact, in agreement.
4. Agreement based on mutual observation. These defendants have simply observed 
each others’ pricing behavior over time, and they are able therefore to anticipate each 
others’ future conduct and act accordingly without any direct collusion but with results 
akin to those that would have resulted from a direct agreement.3
Parallel Conduct
An unlawful conspiracy is to be distinguished from independent but parallel business be-
havior by competitors. So-called conscious parallelism is fully lawful because the com-
petitors have not agreed either explicitly or by implication to follow the same course of 
action. Rather, their business judgment has led each to independently follow parallel paths. 
On the other hand, a conspiracy can sometimes be established by proof that the parallel 
behavior in question was not arrived at independently, but rather was the product of a pre-
ceding agreement.4
Aggressive Enforcement
Both government intervention advocates and free-market champions agree that price fix-
ing cripples the market. So government intervention, at the federal and state levels, and 
damage claims by wronged consumers are sometimes essential to maintain effective com-
petition. Antitrust law, including price-fixing prohibitions, is designed to protect the

 consumer from a variety of commercial arrangements—some well-intentioned, some overt 
 cheating—that nullify the favorable effects of competition. Consider some prominent 
 examples.
• At this writing in 2013, a federal judge has given preliminary approval to a $7.2 billion 
settlement of an eight-year a ntitrust war between the plaintiffs, a coalition of large and 
small merchants, and the defendants, Visa Inc., MasterCard, and their associated banks 
(including, e.g., Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase). The defendants are accused of 
engaging in a price-fixing cartel to set arbitrarily high interchange or “swipe” fees that 
merchants pay to card-issuing banks and credit card companies for processing card 
transactions. (American Express and Discover were not involved in this lawsuit.) The 
settlement provides cash and temporary reductions in swipe fees for some 8 million 
merchants, and it allows small merchants to join together in future bargaining with Visa 
and MasterCard over swipe fees. Merchants will also be able for the first time to charge 
consumers extra for using credit cards. (Some states forbid such surcharges, and com-
petitive pressure may prevent most merchants from assessing them.) The agreement 
does not apply to debit card transaction fees, which were capped by Congress through 
the Dodd–Frank bill (see Chapter 15). Many merchants, including Walmart and Target, 
oppose the settlement arguing the giant card companies and banks will retain the power 
to fix prices. The agreement also limits merchants’ rights to file similar lawsuits in 
the future.
• At this writing, eight companies, including LG Display Co., Sharp Corp., and  Chunghwa 
Picture Tubes, Ltd., have pleaded guilty or have agreed to plead guilty to federal crimi-
nal charges of conspiring to fix prices for about $75 billion in LCD panels and will pay 
fines totaling about $1.4 billion. Twelve executives have been sentenced to a total  of 
more than 13 years in prison. Additional criminal and civil lawsuits around the world 
are likely to produce billions in further payouts. The panels were used in computer 
monitors, notebooks, televisions, and other electronic devices by Apple, Dell, and oth-
ers. Reportedly, the LCD industry was facing an oversupply problem between October 
2000 and August 2001, but despite that market condition, prices began to rise after 
August 2001,  allegedly as a result of the companies working in concert to fix prices. 
The Justice Department described some of the conspiratorial behavior among three of 
the companies:
The three companies . . . allegedly held “crystal” meetings and engaged in communica-
tions about setting prices on the TFT-LCD displays. They agreed to charge predetermined 
prices for the  displays, issued price quotes based on those agreements, and exchanged 
sales information on the display panels, in order to monitor and enforce the agreement, 
the Justice  Department said.5
• According to a federal Justice Department investigation, executives at several major 
Japanese auto parts suppliers met in secret for over 10 years, sometimes speaking in 
code, to fix prices on a variety of parts. Hundreds of millions in fines and prison sen-
tences for several executives have been imposed by U.S. authorities.6

We know that college students drink astonishing amounts 
of alcohol. Each year college students spend about $5.5 bil-
lion on alcohol, most of that on beer. That total exceeds 
what students spend on books, soda, coffee, juice, and 
milk  combined. Could antitrust law affect the consumption, 
or at least the price, of beer? Perhaps. A group of consum-
ers in Madison, Wisconsin, home of the University of 
 Wisconsin, sued some local bars and the Madison-Dane 
County Tavern League, Inc., for price fixing. The plaintiffs 
claimed that the defendant bars had agreed to fix prices by 
adopting a “voluntary ban on drink specials.” The plaintiffs 
pointed to a September 2002 press release from the 
“Downtown Tavern Working Group” announcing that drink 
specials would not be offered after 8 PM on Friday and 
 Saturday nights for “at least a year.” 
 
The defendants said the new policy was a self- 
imposed effort to curb binge drinking, especially by stu-
dents, and that the policy was a response to pressure 
from the city and the University of Wisconsin. Further, 
the defendants said that the press release did not re-
flect an agreement of any kind and thus could not vio-
late the law because all bar owners remained free to do 
as they wished. Eventually, the Wisconsin  Supreme 
Court held that the policy was immune from the antitrust 
laws because the city effectively compelled the ar-
rangement. Given the state legislature’s broad grant of 
regulatory authority over alcohol to municipalities, the 
Court concluded that the legislature must have intended 
the defendant taverns’ actions to be exempt (immune 
from scrutiny) from the antitrust laws.

1. The legality of this arrangement aside, should bar own-

and society? Explain.
4. a.  How would you expect the Supreme Court decision

Daniels Midland, A. E. Staley, and others agreed in 2004 to pay $531 million to settle a

These are only a few of the many examples in recent years of price-fixing conspiracies 
in America and around the world. The effect of these unlawful arrangements is to harm 
competition and raise prices. Antitrust expert John M. Connor has estimated that cartels 
“typically push prices up at least 20 percent and sometimes much more.”8

 competition with one another regarding promotions at the re-
tail level, resulting in a direct reduction of the retail prices of 
cigarettes.
 
Plaintiffs filed this class action lawsuit on April 10, 2000, 
alleging violations of New Mexico antitrust and consumer pro-
tection laws. Defendants filed motions for summary judgment. 
In granting the motion for summary judgment, the district court 
held that Plaintiffs had met their initial burden of showing a 
pattern of parallel behavior, but failed to meet their second 
burden of showing the existence of plus factors that would 
tend to exclude the possibility that the alleged conspirators 
acted independently.
* * * * *
 
On appeal, the Court of Appeals acknowledged that 
 “Marlboro Friday and the industry-wide price reductions that 
occurred afterward represented the triumph of competition 
over oligopolistic price coordination.” Although the Court 
 affirmed summary judgment in favor of Lorillard and Liggett 
because the evidence showed that they had merely acted 
“consistent with conscious parallelism,” the Court reversed 
summary judgment in favor of Philip Morris, RJR, and B&W 
because “we think that a reasonable factfinder could view 
conscious parallelism as a relatively implausible explanation 
for the anticompetitive scenario that played out following 
 Marlboro Friday.”

PROVING THE CONSPIRACY
* * * * *
There is no doubt that the tobacco industry, in which five 
 companies manufacture more than 97% of the cigarettes sold 
in the United States, is a classic oligopoly. Because the 
 cigarette industry is an oligopoly, it is likely that when one 
Justice Chavez
BACKGROUND
The following facts are undisputed. Plaintiffs are “[p]ersons in 
the State of New Mexico . . . who purchased cigarettes indi-
rectly from Defendants, or any parent, subsidiary or affiliate 
thereof, at any time from November 1, 1993 to the date of the 
filing of this action [April 10, 2000].” The original Defendants 
were Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds (“RJR”), Brown &  Williamson 
(“B&W”), Lorillard, and Liggett. The events leading up to this 
lawsuit were set in motion in response to a Philip Morris 
 strategy beginning with an event known as “Marlboro Friday.” 
Prior to Marlboro Friday, Philip Morris, the market leader, 
had been steadily losing market share to discount and deep 
discount cigarettes since 1980, when Liggett pioneered the 
development of generic cigarettes. In an attempt to regain 
market share, Philip Morris announced Marlboro Friday on 
April 2, 1993, “a nationwide promotion on Marlboro that 
 reduced prices at retail by approximately 20 percent, an aver-
age of 40[cents] per pack.” In response, RJR and B&W insti-
tuted similar promotions. As part of its strategy, Philip Morris 
announced on July 20, 1993, that there would be a similar re-
duction on all premium brands, discount brands, and deep 
 discount brands starting on August 9, 1993. Defendants RJR 
and B&W also followed these price reductions. After these 
decreases, Defendants began to increase their wholesale list 
prices on premium and discount cigarettes in near lock-step 
fashion. Some increases were due to settlements with the 
50 states, some because of increases in federal excise taxes, 
and others were simply planned. Even with these increases, 
wholesale list prices did not exceed pre-Marlboro Friday 
 levels until August 3, 1998, or when adjusted for inflation, 
 ongoing settlement costs, and federal excise taxes, the list 
prices did not surpass pre-Marlboro Friday amounts until 
 August 1999. During the time period of the alleged agreement 
to fix prices, 1993 to 2000, Defendants were engaged in

 tobacco company (i.e., Philip Morris) acts in a certain manner 
(i.e.,  Marlboro Friday and subsequent price increases), the 
other firms (RJR, B&W, Lorillard, and Liggett) will determine 
whether it is in their best interest to follow the leader’s  actions. 
As we will discuss below, when Philip Morris began raising 
prices  after Marlboro Friday, RJR’s and B&Ws conduct in fol-
lowing subsequent price increases was just as likely due to 
their own independent analysis of what was in their best inter-
ests as it was the result of an illegal price-fixing agreement. 
Therefore, Plaintiffs must present evidence that tends to 
 exclude the  possibility that Defendants acted independently or 
they cannot meet their  burden of establishing a genuine issue 
of material fact. . . .
 
The United States Supreme Court has explicitly stated that 
“when allegations of parallel conduct are set out in order to 
make a Section 1 claim, they must be placed in a context that 
raises a suggestion of a preceding agreement, not merely 
 parallel conduct that could just as well be independent 
 action.” Bell Atl. Corp., 550 U.S. at 557.
* * * * *
 
[W]e must determine whether Plaintiffs’ proffered 
 evidence of plus factors tends to exclude the possibility 
that Defendants acted independently. Plaintiffs cite to the 
following plus factors, in addition to parallel pricing, as 
tending to exclude the possibility that Defendants acted in-
dependently: (1) the economies of the marketplace, such as 
a highly concentrated market, cigarette fungibility, high 
barriers to entry in the industry, absence of close substi-
tutes, and a history of collusion; (2) a strong motivation to 
conspire, resulting from the desperate times facing the 
cigarette industry, including “a dramatic decline in its sales 
as a result of . . . increased public awareness of the detri-
mental health effects of smoking”; (3) the condensation of 
price tiers to facilitate the conspiracy; (4) actions contrary 
to self-interest, including Philip Morris’s pre-announcing its 
price reductions and Defendants’ failure to attempt to 
 re-widen the price gap by reducing discount prices; 
(5) conspiratorial meetings in other markets; (6) a smoking 
and health conspiracy; (7) the manner in which Defendants 
monitored the conspiracy through Management Science 
Associates (“MSA”); (8) opportunities to conspire; and 
(9) pricing decisions made at high levels.
 
We reject Plaintiffs’ plus factors . . . because Defend-
ants’ conduct is just as consistent with lawful, independent 
action as it is with price fixing, and therefore it does not 
tend to exclude independent conduct. We briefly discuss 
Plaintiffs’ plus factors to address why they do not tend to 
exclude the possibility of independent conduct by 
 Defendants. (1) The majority of the economies of the mar-
ketplace to which Plaintiffs cite are nothing more than in-
herent characteristics of an oligopoly and cannot tend to 
exclude independent action. 
* * * * *
(2) The motivation to conspire cited by Plaintiffs cannot serve 
as tending to exclude independent conduct because “[p]rofit 
is a legitimate motive in pricing decisions, and something more 
is required before a court can conclude that competitors con-
spired to fix pricing in violation of the Sherman Act.” In re 
Baby Food Antitrust Litig., 166 F.3d at 134–35. (3) When Philip 
Morris took action to condense the price tiers, it is just as 
likely that they did so to reduce the price gap and maximize 
profits as to facilitate a price-fixing agreement, and thus this 
does not tend to exclude independent conduct. (4) Plaintiffs 
argue that Defendants took actions contrary to self-interest by 
preannouncing price decisions and failing to re-widen the 
price gap. Philip Morris argues that the June 20, 1993 pre- 
announcement of a price decrease to take effect twenty days 
later was not a signal to the other cigarette manufacturers, but 
was made to allow wholesalers and retailers to avoid an im-
mediate reduction in the value of their inventory and to ac-
commodate the burden of implementing a price reduction.
* * * * *
(5) The alleged conspiratorial meetings in other markets can-
not serve as tending to exclude independent conduct because 
Plaintiffs offered no support to connect the actions in foreign 
markets with the actions in the United States. . . . (6) Similarly, 
concluding that an alleged smoking and health conspiracy fa-
cilitated coordination of a conspiracy in this case would re-
quire the jury to engage in speculation. . . . (7) The manner in 
which Defendants monitored the conspiracy through MSA is 
not evidence tending to exclude independent conduct be-
cause there is an equally rational legal explanation for this 
such as to “devise competitive strategies, gauge the success 
of their promotions, monitor the impact of new styles or pack-
ing on the market, and determine whether increased promo-
tional spending was needed in certain geographic areas to 
compete with competitors’ programs.” . . .
 
Defendants made a prima facie case supporting summary 
judgment by providing evidence of fierce retail competition that 
undermined the plausibility of a price-fixing agreement [and by] 
demonstrating that wholesale prices remained lower than pre-
Marlboro Friday levels and did not exceed pre-Marlboro Friday 
levels until almost five years later. . . . This evidence showed 
that Defendants ‘“had no rational economic motive to conspire,

5. The “Three Tenors,” Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, 
and Jose Carreras, recorded a 1990 World Cup concert, 
distributed by Polygram, and a 1994 World Cup concert, 
distributed by Warner. Polygram and Warner subse-
quently agreed to jointly distribute and share profits from 
the 1998 World Cup Three Tenors concert. The 1998 
 recording  apparently was less “new and exciting” than 
had been hoped. Concerned that sales of the earlier 
 recordings would drain interest from the 1998 recording, 
Polygram and Warner agreed to cease all discounting 
and advertising of the two earlier recordings for several 
weeks surrounding the release of the 1998 album. In 2001, 
the Federal Trade Commission issued complaints against 
Polygram and Warner. Those complaints eventually 
reached the District of Columbia Federal Circuit Court of 
Appeals where Polygram and Warner defended themselves 
by arguing that the agreement was good for  competition 
in that it increased the joint venture’s profitability from 
new recordings, and it eliminated free riding by each 
company (for the 1990 and 1994 recordings) on the joint 
venture’s 1998 marketing.

Refusal to Deal/Group Boycotts
Principal legislation—Sherman Act, Section 1.
 
In America we are free to do business with whomever we prefer, correct? Generally, yes; 
but antitrust problems sometimes emerge. When does a refusal to deal with another raise 
antitrust issues? The clearest problem is a horizontal group boycott where  competitors agree 
not to deal with a supplier, customer, or another competitor. Ford and GM, for  example, 
presumably could not jointly refuse to buy tires from Bridgestone/Firestone. Such 
 arrangements so thoroughly subvert the market that they ordinarily are per se  violations of 
Sherman I and thus do not require a detailed evaluation of competitive harm and benefits, 
although a showing of market power by those in the group may be required. A unilateral 
(individual) refusal to deal by a buyer or a seller sometimes raises antitrust concerns if the 
firm refusing to deal is a  monopolist and harm to competition can be proven,9 but the 
 Supreme Court has severely restricted the use of the doctrine.10

Clarett Boycotted by NFL?
Antitrust shapes all dimensions of our lives, as football running back Maurice Clarett 
learned when he tried to enter the 2004 National Football League draft. Clarett, as a 
freshman, led Ohio State University to an undefeated season in 2002. Clarett was ineli-
gible for college football in his sophomore year because of allegations that he accepted 
improper benefits and lied about doing so. Clarett then tried to enter the NFL draft but 
was barred by a league rule providing that players must have been out of high school for 
three seasons. Clarett sued the NFL, claiming its eligibility rules violated federal anti-
trust laws by, in  effect, allowing competing teams to agree among themselves to boycott 
certain players (including Clarett). Clarett won at the federal district court level, but he 
lost on appeal when the court ruled that the eligibility rule is exempt from the antitrust 
laws. The NFL eligibility rule is the product of a collective bargaining agreement be-
tween the league and the players’ union, the National Football League Players Associa-
tion. Antitrust promotes competition while unions restrict it in various ways, but in 
balancing those competing interests, Congress and the courts have long granted unions 
certain exemptions from antitrust laws. The Supreme Court subsequently declined to 
review Clarett’s case.
 
In 2010, Clarett was released from prison where he had served a three-and-one-half 
year sentence for aggravated robbery and carrying a concealed weapon. Following his 
 release, Clarett played football with the Omaha Nighthawks and published a book about 
his life.
 
A recent battle among the big bank card companies illustrates refusal to deal reasoning 
(although for technical reasons the case was not tried under the refusal to deal/boycott label). 
In 1996, American Express decided to open its own credit card network to compete with 
Visa and MasterCard. No bank, however, was willing to deal with American Express. Why 
would the banks turn down the potential to make more money by working with the respected 
American Express brand? They did so because Visa and MasterCard had rules forbidding 
their members from issuing American Express and Discover cards. Visa and MasterCard 
operate as nonprofit joint venture associations owned by the member banks that issue their 
credit cards. As long as those banks wanted to do business with Visa and MasterCard, the 
two giants, they could not deal with American Express and Discover. Were the Visa and 
 MasterCard refusal to deal rules lawful? No, as it turns out. The antitrust division of the  federal 
Department of Justice sued the two giants for their alleged  exclusionary practices and won in 
the federal courts.11 The six-year struggle turned largely on the finding that continued exclusion 
of Discover, American Express, and others from the market was a  horizontal  restraint that 
would likely harm future competition. A key finding was the conclusion that Visa and Master-
Card, with their collective market share exceeding 70 percent, had market power. American 
Express subsequently sued Visa for damages inflicted by the alleged 
exclusionary practices. In 2007, Visa agreed to pay $2.1 billion to 
settle that lawsuit and in 2008 MasterCard Worldwide agreed to pay 
$1.8 billion to American Express. [For a trade regulation blog, see

had paid to Discon. Discon claimed that the buyer and NYNEX then received a rebate 
from AT&T at the end of the year. Discon argued that NYNEX was able to pass on its

Part Three—Vertical Restraints
We have been studying unfair trade practices by competitors—that is, horizontal restraints 
of trade. Now we turn to antitrust violations on the vertical axis—that is, restraints involv-
ing two or more members of a supply chain (such as a manufacturer and a retailer of that 
manufacturer’s products). Horizontal restraints are those arising from an agreement 
among the competitors themselves, while vertical restraints ordinarily are those imposed 
by suppliers on their buyers. Horizontal restraints, in general, are per se unlawful while 
vertical restraints, in general, are to be resolved under the rule of reason. Horizontal

E-Books: Apple Fixing Prices?
[An ongoing price-fixing case involving Apple’s e-book marketing practices illustrates 
some of the principles of horizontal price fixing, as discussed above, along with elements 
of vertical price fixing (resale price maintenance) discussed below.] 
 
The Kindle e-book reader was introduced by Amazon in 2007, followed by Barnes & 
Noble’s Nook reader (2009) and Apple’s iPad (2010). Amazon priced many of its e-book 
best sellers at a very attractive $9.99 (often below its cost) to increase demand for the 
 Kindle, to solidify its market position, and to encourage broader shopping at Amazon. By 
some measures, Amazon’s share of digital book sales peaked as high as 90 percent of the 
market. Book publishers, including HarperCollins and Penguin, apparently fearing 
 Amazon’s power in the e-book market, allegedly entered negotiations among themselves 
and with Apple to change e-book pricing from Amazon’s “wholesale” model (where 
 Amazon itself set e-book retail prices) to an “agency” model (where the publishers set the 
retail price of books [e.g., $14.99] and the retailers, including Apple and Barnes & Noble, 
kept a 30 percent share). Having achieved an agreement with Apple, the publishers alleg-
edly were able to compel Amazon to accept the same terms. Thereafter, Amazon’s e-book 
market share reportedly fell to about 60 percent.
 
In April 2012, the Justice Department filed a civil complaint against Apple and five 
book publishers claiming that the defendant publishers had conspired among themselves 
and with Apple to fix prices in violation of the Sherman Act. The publishers denied mis-
conduct but reached a settlement with the government. In their defense, the publishers and 
Apple claimed they acted independently in implementing agency pricing. 
 
Relying principally on horizontal price-fixing reasoning, a federal judge in 2013 found 
Apple guilty of colluding with the publishers to fix prices. The judge ordered Apple to mod-
ify its contracts and submit to oversight. Apple is appealing. Critics fear the government 
victory over Apple may restore Amazon to its former position of complete e-book domi-
nance. On the other hand, e-book prices fell after the publishers began settling with the gov-
ernment. Another likely result may be a reduction in the number of physical bookstores.

 restraints eliminate competition thereby undermining the power of the market while verti-
cal restraints sometimes are harmful and sometimes are beneficial to competition and thus 
ordinarily should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

moted Brighton. For example, it ran Brighton advertisements 
and had Brighton days in the store. Kay’s Kloset became the 
destination retailer in the area to buy Brighton products. 
Brighton was the store’s most important brand and once ac-
counted for 40 to 50 percent of its profits.
 
In 1997, Leegin instituted the “Brighton retail pricing and 
Promotion Policy.” Following the policy, Leegin refused to sell 
to retailers that discounted Brighton goods below suggested 
prices. . . . In the letter to retailers establishing the policy, 
Leegin stated:
In this age of mega stores like Macy’s, Bloomingdales, May 
Co. and others, consumers are perplexed by promises of

Petitioner, Leegin Creative Leather Products, Inc. (Leegin), de-
signs, manufactures, and distributes leather goods and acces-
sories. In 1991, Leegin began to sell belts under the brand 
name “Brighton.” The Brighton brand has now expanded into 
a variety of women’s fashion accessories. It is sold across the 
United States in over 5,000 retail establishments, for the most 
part independent, small boutiques and specialty stores. . . . 
Leegin asserts that, at least for its products, small retailers 
treat customers better, provide customers more services, and 
make their shopping experience more satisfactory than do 
larger, often impersonal retailers. [Leegin’s president, Jerry] 
Kohl explained: “[W]e want the consumers to get a different 
experience than they get in Sam’s Club or in Wal-Mart. And 
you can’t get that kind of experience or support or customer 
service from a store like Wal-Mart.”

a manufacturer or distributor seek to influence the price at which the product is resold? 
The primary reasons are fourfold: (1) establishing a minimum price to enhance the 
product’s reputation, (2) helping retailers make a profit sufficient to provide customer 
service, (3) preventing discount stores from pricing beneath full-price retail outlets, 
and (4) preventing free riders.
 
A unilateral specification of a resale price, with nothing more involved, has long 
been permissible. Under the Supreme Court’s 1919 Colgate12 decision, sellers can 
lawfully  engage in resale price maintenance if they do nothing more than announce 
prices at which their products are to be resold and unilaterally refuse to deal with any-
one who does not adhere to those prices. On the other hand, an agreement between a 
seller and a buyer  dictating the price at which the buyer may resell the product was, for 
decades, a per se  violation of the law. Then in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that 
agreements specifying maximum resale prices would no longer be considered per se 
violations and must be  evaluated under the rule of reason.13 In the 2007 Leegin case 
that follows, the Supreme Court overturned a nearly 100-year-old precedent in the 
Dr. Miles case14 to rule that agreements specifying minimum resale prices must also be 
analyzed under the rule of reason; that is, those agreements are no longer per se viola-
tions of the law. Rather, they must be considered on a case-by-case basis weighing 
their pro- and anticompetitive effects.

product quality and support of product which we believe is 
lacking in these large stores. Consumers are further 
confused by the ever popular sale, sale, sale, etc.
 
We, at Leegin, choose to break away from the pack by 
selling [at] specialty stores; specialty stores that can offer 
the customer great quality merchandise, superb service, 
and support the Brighton product 365 days a year on a 
consistent  basis. . . .
 
Leegin adopted the policy to give its retailers sufficient 
margins to provide customers the service central to its distri-
bution strategy. It also expressed concern that discounting 
harmed Brighton’s brand image and reputation.
* * * * *
 
In December 2002, Leegin discovered Kay’s Kloset had 
been marking down Brighton’s entire line by 20 percent. Kay’s 
Kloset contended it placed Brighton products on sale to 
 compete with nearby retailers who also were undercutting 
Leegin’s suggested prices. Leegin, nonetheless, requested 
that Kay’s Kloset cease discounting. Its request refused, 
Leegin stopped selling to the store. The loss of the Brighton 
brand had a considerable negative impact on the store’s 
 revenue from sales.
 
PSKS sued Leegin in the United States District Court for 
the Eastern District of Texas. It alleged, among other claims, 
that Leegin had violated the antitrust laws by “enter[ing] into 
agreements with retailers to charge only those prices fixed by 
Leegin.”

The jury agreed with PSKS and awarded it $1.2 million.

Resort to per se rules is confined to restraints . . . “that would 
always or almost always tend to restrict competition and de-
crease output.” Business Electronics, 485 U.S. at 723 . . .
 
As a consequence, the per se rule is appropriate only after 
courts have had considerable experience with the type of re-
straint at issue, and only if courts can predict with confidence 
that it would be invalidated in all or almost all instances under 
the rule of reason. . . .
III
The Court has interpreted Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. 
Park & Sons Co., 220 U.S. 373 (1911), as establishing a per se 
rule against a vertical agreement between a manufacturer 
and its distributor to set minimum resale prices. . . .
 
The reasons upon which Dr. Miles relied do not justify a 
per se rule. As a consequence, it is necessary to examine . . . 
the economic effects of vertical agreements to fix minimum 
resale prices, and to determine whether the per se rule is 
nonetheless appropriate.
A
Though each side of the debate can find sources to support its 
position, it suffices to say here that economics literature is re-
plete with procompetitive justifications for a manufacturer’s 
use of resale price maintenance.
* * * * *
 
The justifications for vertical price restraints are similar to 
those for other vertical restraints. Minimum resale price main-
tenance can stimulate interbrand competition—the competi-
tion among manufacturers selling different brands of the same 
type of product—by reducing intrabrand competition—the 
competition among retailers selling the same brand. The pro-
motion of interbrand competition is important because “the 
primary purpose of the antitrust laws is to protect [this type of] 
competition.” Khan, 522 U.S. at 15. . . .
 
Absent vertical price restraints, the retail services that en-
hance interbrand competition might be under provided. This is 
because discounting retailers can free ride on retailers who 
furnish services and then capture some of the increased de-
mand those services generate.
 
Resale price maintenance, in addition, can increase inter-
brand competition by facilitating market entry for new firms 
and brands. “[N]ew manufacturers and manufacturers enter-
ing new markets can use the restrictions in order to induce 
competent and aggressive retailers to make the kind of invest-
ment of capital and labor that is often required in the distribu-
tion of products unknown to the consumer.” GTE Sylvania, 433 
U.S. at 55; . . .
 
Resale price maintenance can also increase interbrand 
competition by encouraging retailer services that would not 
be provided even absent free riding. It may be difficult and in-
efficient for a manufacturer to make and enforce a contract 
with a retailer specifying the different services the retailer 
must perform. Offering the retailer a guaranteed margin and 
threatening termination if it does not live up to expectations 
may be the most efficient way to expand the manufacturer’s 
market share by inducing the retailer’s performance and 

Chapter Ten  Antitrust Law—Restraints of Trade  451
 allowing it to use its own initiative and experience in providing 
valuable services.
* * * * *
B
While vertical agreements setting minimum resale prices can 
have procompetitive justifications, they may have anticom-
petitive effects in other cases; and unlawful price fixing, de-
signed solely to obtain monopoly profits, is an ever-present 
temptation. Resale price maintenance may, for example, fa-
cilitate a manufacturer cartel. An unlawful cartel will seek to 
discover if some manufacturers are undercutting the cartel’s 
fixed prices. Resale price maintenance could assist the cartel 
in identifying price-cutting manufacturers who benefit from 
the lower prices they offer. Resale price maintenance, fur-
thermore, could discourage a manufacturer from cutting 
prices to retailers with the concomitant benefit of cheaper 
prices to consumers.
 
Vertical price restraints also “might be used to organize 
cartels at the retailer level.” Business Electronics, at 725–726. 
A group of retailers might collude to fix prices to consumers 
and then compel a manufacturer to aid the unlawful arrange-
ment with resale price maintenance.
 
A horizontal cartel among competing manufacturers or 
competing retailers that decreases output or reduces competi-
tion in order to increase price is, and ought to be, per se 
 unlawful. To the extent a vertical agreement setting minimum 
resale prices is entered upon to facilitate either type of cartel, it, 
too, would need to be held unlawful under the rule of  reason.
* * * * *
 
A manufacturer with market power . . . might use resale 
price maintenance to give retailers an incentive not to sell the 
products of smaller rivals or new entrants. As should be evi-
dent, the potential anticompetitive consequences of vertical 
price restraints must not be ignored or underestimated.
C
Notwithstanding the risk of unlawful conduct, it cannot be 
stated with any degree of confidence that resale price mainte-
nance “always or almost always tend[s] to restrict competi-
tion and decrease output.” Vertical agreements establishing 
minimum resale prices can have either procompetitive or anti-
competitive effects, depending upon the circumstances in 
which they are formed.
 
Respondent contends, nonetheless, that . . . the per se 
rule is justified because a vertical price restraint can lead to 
higher prices for the manufacturer’s goods. . . . Respondent 
is mistaken in relying on pricing effects absent a further 
showing of anticompetitive conduct. . . . For, as has been 
 indicated already, the antitrust laws are designed primarily 
to protect interbrand  competition, from which lower prices 
can later result. . . .
 
Respondent’s argument, furthermore, overlooks that, in 
general, the interests of manufacturers and consumers are 
aligned with respect to retailer profit margins. . . . A manufac-
turer has no incentive to overcompensate retailers with unjus-
tified margins. The retailers, not the manufacturer, gain from 
higher retail prices. The manufacturer often loses; interbrand 
competition reduces its competitiveness and market share be-
cause consumers will “substitute a different brand of the 
same product.” see Business Electronics, at 725. . . .
 
Resale price maintenance, it is true, does have economic 
dangers. If the rule of reason were to apply to vertical price 
restraints, courts would have to be diligent in eliminating 
their anticompetitive uses from the market. This is a realis-
tic  objective. . . .
 
As a final matter, that a dominant manufacturer or  retailer 
can abuse resale price maintenance for anticompetitive 
 purposes may not be a serious concern unless the relevant 
 entity has market power. If a retailer lacks market power, manu-
facturers likely can sell their goods through rival retailers.
* * * * *
 
For all of the foregoing reasons, we think that were the 
Court considering the issue as an original matter, the rule of 
reason, not a per se rule of unlawfulness, would be the appro-
priate standard to judge vertical price restraints.

Leegin in Practice (the Law) The Leegin ruling seems to affirm the Supreme 
Court’s current preference for free-market principles and reduced judicial intervention 
in business practice. Accordingly, more competition and better service should follow, 
but critics think the decision simply allows manufacturers to pressure and cut out 
 discounters with the  result that consumers will pay higher prices. Of course, if anticom-
petitive behavior emerges, it still can be attacked under the rule of reason, but several 
states including California, Kansas, and New York continue to treat resale price mainte-
nance as a per se violation of law. Similarly, the European Union generally forbids resale 
price maintenance, unless clear efficiencies are identified. France, for example, in 2012 
fined Nestlé, Mars, and Colgate-Palmolive nearly $50 million for allegedly applying pres-
sure to their distributors to maintain high pet food prices.
Leegin in Practice (the Business Response) Some product suppliers are using the Leegin 
decision to impose strict pricing policies throughout their chains of distribution. Thus in 
2012, Sony and Samsung required all their U.S. retailers to charge full price for the two 
manufacturers’ televisions. Of course, Sony and Samsung hope to boost their profits by 
reducing discounting, but manufacturers also use resale price maintenance to neutralize a 
series of competitive problems.
 
Commonly, manufacturers are worried that price discounts will  diminish the image of 
their products, but they also want to discourage “free riders,” and they are concerned about 
the new problem of “showrooming” in the age of the smartphone. That is, manufacturers 
want to protect themselves and their chains of distribution both from discounters who free 
ride on the advertising and promotion of full-service retailers and from consumers (show-
roomers) who educate themselves about products in brick-and-mortar stores, such as spe-
cialty shops or Target, and then often buy from an online competitor after making instant 
price  comparisons.
Question
Is the Leegin decision good or bad for consumers? Explain.
Vertical Territorial and Customer Restraints
Principal legislation: Sherman Act, Section 1; Federal Trade Commission Act, Section 5.
 
In addition to price restraints, manufacturers commonly impose nonprice restraints 
 including where and to whom their product may be resold. Those restrictions typically  afford 
an exclusive sales territory to a distributor. Similarly, manufacturers may prevent distributors 
from selling to some classes of customers (for example, a distributor might be forbidden to 
sell to an unfranchised retailer). Of course, such arrangements, necessarily retard or eliminate 
intrabrand competition. Because price and service competition among dealers in the same 
brand ordinarily benefits the consumer, the courts have frequently struck down such arrange-
ments. Still, those territorial and customer allocations also have merits. The GTE Sylvania 
case15 enunciated those virtues and established the position that vertical  restrictions are to be 
judged case-by-case, balancing interbrand and intrabrand competitive effects while recogniz-
ing that interbrand competition is the primary concern of antitrust law. Thus, the rule of 
 reason is to be applied to vertical territorial and customer restraints.

Chapter Ten  Antitrust Law—Restraints of Trade  453
Tying Arrangements
Principal legislation: Clayton Act, Section 3; Sherman Act, Sections 1 and 2; Federal 
Trade Commission Act, Section 5.
Clayton act, section 3. That it shall be unlawful for any person engaged in commerce, in 
the course of such commerce, to lease or make a sale or contract for sale of goods . . . or 
other commodities . . . or fix a price charged therefore, or discount from or rebate upon, 
such price, on the condition, agreement, or understanding that the lessee or purchaser 
thereof shall not use or deal in the goods . . . or other commodities of a competitor or com-
petitors of the lessor or seller, where the effect of such lease, sale, or contract for sale or 
such condition, agreement, or understanding may be to substantially lessen competition or 
tend to create a monopoly in any line of commerce.
 
Tying arrangements (sometimes called “bundling”) are another form of nonprice verti-
cal restraint. Typically, tying arrangements permit a customer to buy or lease a desired 
product (the tying product) only if the customer also buys or leases another, less desirable 
product (the tied product). In a battle between commercial titans, a large class of merchants 
led by Walmart, Sears, and others sued Visa and MasterCard, alleging that the bank card 
associations engaged in unlawful tying arrangements by requiring the merchants to accept 
the associations’ debit cards (the tied product) if they wanted to retain the right to accept 
the very popular Visa and MasterCard charge cards (the tying product). The result, the 
merchant/plaintiffs said, was billions in losses because they were forced to pay higher fees 
for Visa and MasterCard debit cards rather than the lower fees of the competing debit cards 
they would have preferred to accept. The parties reached a $3 billion out-of-court settle-
ment in 2003.16 [See Chapter 11 for a discussion of Microsoft’s alleged practice of tying its 
Internet Explorer browser (the tied product) to its dominant Windows operating system 
(the tying product).]
The Law Tying arrangements raise two primary antitrust concerns: (1) A party who al-
ready enjoys market power over the tying product is able to extend that power into the tied 
product market and (2) competitors in the tied product market are foreclosed from equal 
access to that market.
 
The basic tying violation test is as follows:
1. The existence of separate products. (That is, two products are present rather than one 
product consisting of two or more components, or two entirely separate products that 
happen to be elements in a single transaction.)
2. A requirement that the purchase of one of the products (the tying product) is condi-
tioned on the purchase of another product (the tied product).
3. Market power in the tying product.
4. Substantial impact on commerce in the tied product market. (Some courts require a 
substantial anticompetitive effect in the tied product market.)
 
Proof of all four of those ingredients establishes per se illegality. When all four 
 ingredients cannot be satisfied, the analysis may proceed on a rule of reason basis, 
weighing pro- and anticompetitive considerations. Critics argue that tying arrangements

Cable/Satellite TV Bundling
Consumers often are frustrated because their cable and satellite television services ordinar-
ily come in packages of channels rather than in an “a la carte” menu where the subscriber 
can choose and pay for only the subscriber’s preferred individual channels. In a recent 
California case, a group of consumers sued several television networks and cable and sat-
ellite distributors, including NBC, Fox, and Time Warner Cable claiming, among other 
things, that the defendants engaged in Sherman Act violations. The defendant television 
networks sold television programming to the defendant cable distribution companies in 
bundles rather than on a per channel basis. The distributors, in turn, sold to consumers in 
those prepackaged bundles or on a “tier” basis. The plaintiff consumers claimed the prac-
tice of offering subscriptions only in bundles was unlawful under the Sherman Act.

often enhance consumer  welfare and, as such, the per se approach should be overturned, 
as in the Leegin case.
Franchise Tying?
The following case examines tying allegations in the context of Shell and Texaco gas 
 station franchises. The case turns in part on market definition, a topic that we address 
more thoroughly in Chapter 11. In brief, in order to establish market power in the tying 
product, the market itself must be defined. In doing so we consider the geographic market 
(where the product is sold in commercially significant quantities) and the product market 
(those products that are interchangeable and thus compete, one with the other).

Chapter Ten  Antitrust Law—Restraints of Trade  455
products (the franchises and the credit-card processing 
 services). Rick-Mik contends franchisees could pay lower 
transaction fees from others for credit-card processing. . . .
 
The district court dismissed the antitrust and related state-
law counts. . . .
DISCUSSION
Tying Claim
a. The market power allegations are flawed.
The alleged tying product here is gasoline franchises. Rick-
Mik has a contract for an Equilon franchise to sell Shell 
branded gasoline and diesel. The alleged tied-product is 
credit-card processing services. Rick-Mik alleges it cannot 
get a franchise without the “tied” credit-card processing 
services.
 
Rick-Mik’s complaint does not allege that Equilon has mar-
ket power in the relevant market, which is the market for the 
tying product—gasoline franchises. Indeed, other than stating 
that “[Equilon] rank[s] number one in the industry in branded 
gasoline stations,” there are no specific allegations at all as to 
the franchise market. The complaint alleges nothing about, for 
example, what percentage of gasoline franchises are Equilon’s 
(Shell/Texaco) as compared to other franchises like Chevron, 
Mobil, Marathon Oil, or Union 76. There are no factual allega-
tions as to the percentage of gasoline retail sales that are 
made through non-franchise outlets. There are no factual al-
legations regarding the amount of power or control that 
Equilon has over prospective franchisees. There are no fac-
tual allegations regarding the relative difficulty of a franchisee 
to switch franchise brands.
 
If Equilon lacks market power in the gasoline-franchise 
market, there can be no cognizable tying claim. For, in that 
case, Equilon has no power to force, exploit, or coerce a fran-
chisee to purchase a tied-product such as credit card pro-
cessing (if the processing is a distinct product for tying 
purposes) or to affect competition in the tied-product market. 
Such an arrangement would not raise antitrust concerns.
* * * * *
 
Rick-Mik argues that it alleged sufficient facts to infer that 
Equilon has sufficient economic power in the gasoline- 
franchise market, which has significant barriers to entry. It 
points to statistics indicating Equilon is an important player in 
the  petroleum industry. According to . . . the complaint: 
(1)  Equilon sells petroleum products to approximately 
9,000 Shell and Texaco-branded retail outlets; (2) it ranks first 
in the industry in branded gasoline stations; (3) at 13 percent 
of the market, it ranks first in total gallons of gasoline sold in 
the United States; (4) it has annual gross revenues of approxi-
mately $24 billion; (5) it is number one or two in gasoline mar-
ket share in 17  states; (6) it has four refineries, refining 
approximately 753,000 barrels of petroleum products per day 
and owns a 50 percent interest in Motiva’s three refineries, 
refining  approximately 865,000 barrels of petroleum products 
per day; (7) it owns an interest in approximately 10,000 miles 
of pipeline used to transport its petroleum products through-
out the United States; and (8) it serves, on average, more than 
six  million customers per day and sells approximately 19 bil-
lion gallons of gasoline per year, most of which is purchased 
by customers’ credit or debit cards issued by thousands of 
banks, banking associations and financial institutions 
throughout the United States.
 
All of those allegations, however, relate to the retail gaso-
line market—a market where Rick-Mik is a seller—not the 
relevant market for franchises where it is a buyer. Further, the 
statistics alleged in the complaint do not distinguish between 
franchise-based sales and other potential types of sales (e.g., 
sales by  directly owned outlets or sales to other distributors). 
Thus, the complaint fails to allege market power in the rele-
vant market.
 
Nor is Rick-Mik’s complaint saved by the allegation that 
“Shell and Texaco-branded gasolines are protected by vari-
ous trademarks, copyrights and patents providing Equilon suf-
ficient economic power over Plaintiffs in connection with its 
tying products to appreciably restrain competition in the tied-
product market.” . . . Because intellectual property rights are 
no longer presumed to confer market power, see Illinois Tool-
works Inc., 547 U.S. at 42–43, Rick-Mik’s conclusory allegation 
that Equilon’s intellectual property rights nonetheless do con-
fer market power, unaccompanied by supporting facts, is in-
sufficient.
 
Finally, the complaint’s allegation of a contractual fran-
chise relationship also fails to plead market power. A tying 
claim generally requires that the defendant’s economic 
power be derived from the market, not from a contractual re-
lationship that the plaintiff has entered into voluntarily. See, 
e.g., Queen City Pizza, Inc., 124 F.3d at 443 (“where the de-
fendant’s ‘power’ to ‘force’ plaintiffs to purchase the alleged 
tying product stems not from the market, but from plaintiffs’ 
contractual agreement to purchase the tying product, no 
claim will lie.”)
* * * * *
b. Credit-card processing is not a distinct product.
There is another fatal flaw in Rick-Mik’s complaint. Equilon’s 
franchises are not a separate and distinct product from 
the  credit-card processing services that are part of the 
 franchise.

456  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
 
Franchises, almost by definition, necessarily consist of 
“bundled” and related products or services—not separate 
products.
* * * * *
 
With franchises, “the proper inquiry is . . . whether [the 
 allegedly tied-products] are integral components of the busi-
ness method being franchised. Where the challenged aggre-
gation is an essential ingredient of the franchised system’s 
formula for success, there is but a single product and no tie in 
exists as a matter of law.” Principe v. McDonald’s Corp., 631 
F.2d 303, 309 (4th Cir. 1980).
 
Here, Equilon’s credit card services are an essential part 
of its franchise. Its agreement authorizes Equilon to use 
credit card proceeds to pay off a franchisee’s account (i.e., 
money the franchisee owes Equilon for the gasoline Equilon 
delivers to the franchisee). The agreement also authorizes 
Equilon to charge or refund unauthorized transactions to the 
franchisee, helping secure the integrity of point-of-sale 
transactions.
* * * * *
 
Equilon points to the many other areas which are part 
and parcel of a franchise: signs, advertising, marketing, ap-
pearance, as well as methods of delivery and payment. 
Similarly, the method of receiving and processing credit 
transactions is an integral part of the franchise’s operation. 
The franchise and the method of processing credit transac-
tions are not separate products, but part of a single product 
(the franchise).
* * * * *
 
With franchises, the franchisee knows the contractual 
limitations and duties before entering into the contract. A com-
plaint about such contractual obligations is not an antitrust 
matter.

power to force consumers to bundle the iPod and iTunes 
music. The result, the plaintiffs’ claim, is fewer options

buyer agrees to purchase all of a seller’s output, or both. Exclusive dealing and requirements 
contracts typically are lawful, but antitrust problems can arise depending on harm to com-
petition. By its nature an exclusive deal results in market foreclosure; that is, competitors are 
denied a source of supply or a market for sale. Thus, antitrust issues can emerge depending 
ordinarily on the market share controlled by the parties. In general, however, manufacturers, 
distributors, and retailers have broad latitude in negotiating exclusive deals. We want busi-
nesses to produce and distribute their products in the manner they consider most efficient.
Gore-Tex
The top of the line in waterproof, breathable fabric seems to be Gore-Tex, but its rivals, 
including Columbia Sportswear-owned OutDry, say they have better products but have 
difficulty marketing them because of Gore-Tex’s exclusive dealing arrangements with 
 outdoor clothing and sportswear brands. Gore-Tex allegedly requires those wanting to use 
its products to agree not to use competing brands. The result is an alleged market fore-
closure that allows Gore to control an estimated 70 to 90 percent of the relevant market. 
Gore apparently is being investigated by both the FTC and European Commission antitrust 
authorities. The Wall Street Journal reported that the two Italian brothers who invented 
 OutDry have received enthusiastic responses to their product. Nonetheless, brands say 
 “almost universally” they cannot use OutDry without endangering their relationships with 
Gore. [For more details on the Gore-Tex antitrust story, see Thomas Catan, “Gore-Tex 
Runs into Antitrust Probes,” The Wall Street Journal, June 22, 2011, p. B1.]
American Needle
In 2010, exclusive dealing concerns reached the U.S.  Supreme Court 
when the National Football League was accused of restraint of trade for 
giving Reebok in 2000 an exclusive 10-year right to produce and 
 market nearly all  NFL-trademarked headware. The plaintiff,  American 
Needle, a Downer’s Grove, Illinois, apparel manufacturer, was cut out 
of the premium cap market by the NFL decision. The NFL won at both the trial and federal 
court of appeals level with both courts ruling that the NFL is a single entity (one business rather 
than a collection of competing  teams/businesses) and thus could not have conspired as the 
 Sherman Act requires. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, reversed the lower courts in 2010 by 
a 9–0 margin saying that each of the teams is independently owned and managed and each 
proceeds as a separate, competing economic enterprise pursuing separate economic interests.17
 
A nationwide class action was filed in 2012 on behalf of consumers claiming they have been 
overcharged for NFL gear. The plaintiffs argue that granting the exclusive license to Rebuke 
created a monopoly in licensing and manufacturing NFL team apparel, thereby harming com-
petition and raising prices.18

Mayer Labs, with less than 1 percent of the market, raised antitrust claims against C & D. 
Mayer alleged that C & D had unlawful exclusive dealing arrange ments with some retail 
chains, including 7-Eleven, and Mayer also argued that a C & D program granting 
 kickbacks/rebates to retailers based on the amount of shelf space devoted to C & D 
 products constituted a form of semi-exclusive dealing in that it put a ceiling or quota on the 
amount of shelf space competitors could secure. 
 
The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California ruled for C & D in 2012 
finding, broadly, that Mayer had failed to show that C & D’s marketing strategies had 
foreclosed competition. Despite C & D’s large market share, the court reasoned that Mayer 
failed to show that C & D had market power because no evidence was presented of re-
stricted output, supra-competitive prices, or barriers to entry. Further, the alleged exclusive 
dealing arrangements were of short duration, and they were voluntary. Finally, other chan-
nels of distribution were available to competitors. Thus, competition was not impaired.

Price Discrimination
Principal Legislation: Clayton Act, Section 2, as amended by the Robinson–Patman Act. 
[For the statutory language, see http://assembler.law.cornell.edu/uscode/15/13.html]
 
Price discrimination involves selling substantially identical goods (not services) at 
reasonably contemporaneous times to different purchasers at different prices, where the 
effect is to harm competition. A seller may resist a Robinson–Patman charge by estab-
lishing one of the following defenses: (1) The price differential is attributable to cost 
savings. (In practice, the cost savings defense has been difficult to establish.) (2) The 
price differential is attributable to a good faith effort to meet the equally low price of a 
competitor. (3) Certain transactions are exempt from the act. Of special note is a price 
change made in response to a changing market. Thus, prices might lawfully be altered 
for seasonal goods or perishables.
In recent years, a coalition of independent video stores sued 
Blockbuster claiming that the rental chain and the movie studios 
conspired to drive the small stores out of business. That litiga-
tion failed, as perhaps it should have since the market itself 
seems to have resolved the dispute. Blockbuster declared bank-
ruptcy in 2010. Apparently, its business model did not keep pace with current con-
sumer demand which now favors newer, perhaps more technologically astute 
competitors, Redbox, Netflix, and others. Dish Network then acquired Blockbuster in 
2011for $320 million.
 
The video store cases are among a number in recent years pitting independent operators 
(such as neighborhood bookstores and local pharmacies) against chains (such as Barnes & 
Noble and big hospitals) where the independents claim that suppliers charge their giant 
rivals lower prices than those charged to the small stores. These complaints reflect the 
philosophical battle over the role of antitrust law in a rapidly changing global market.

these remaining plaintiffs devised a plan to gather evidence in 
discovery that might show “that specific plaintiff pharmacies 
lost sales of BNPDs manufactured by defendants to any spe-
cific favored purchaser.” Pursuant to this plan, which came to 
be known as the “matching process,” plaintiffs compiled lists 
of specific BNPD customers who no longer purchased drugs 
from them, and then searched the databases of non-party fa-
vored purchasers (and one favored purchaser who is a party) 
to see whether those same individuals were obtaining the 
same BNPDs from those favored purchasers. 
* * * * *
[O]nly approximately 3% (5,147 of 164,501) of the potential lost 
customers plaintiffs culled from their own records could be 
“matched” to a customer who subsequently filled the same 
prescriptions with one or more favored purchasers. 
* * * * *
The de minimis nature of these results is further illustrated 
when they are broken down and analyzed by defendant. 
United States Magistrate Judge Gold
This complex, long-pending antitrust litigation has been the 
subject of numerous written decisions by various courts. . . . 
 
In short, plaintiffs are a number of individually-owned retail 
pharmacies. Plaintiffs allege that defendants, five manufactur-
ers of brand name prescription drugs (“BNPDs”), offered dis-
counts and rebates to plaintiffs’ competitors but not to 
plaintiffs, and that this constitutes price discrimination in vio-
lation of the Robinson-Patman Act.
BACKGROUND
In 2007, Senior United States District Judge I. Leo Glasser 
granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment “. . . on 
the ground that plaintiffs have failed to show they are enti-
tled to damages.”

After Judge Glasser dismissed the claims of the designated 
parties, approximately 3,700 individual retail pharmacy plain-
tiffs remained. Confronted with Judge Glasser’s decision,

L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E
Should we use antitrust to protect small businesses, thus protecting small towns and an 
historic way of life in America? Or should we accept the dictates of the market, where the 
efficiency of giants like Walmart brings low prices and high quality to all?
 
Free-market advocates condemn price discrimination law as an attack on common, 
 consumer-friendly pricing practices that often result in reduced prices. Why, the critics 
ask, would we assault those who engage in vigorous price competition? Indeed, The Wall 
Street Journal recently labeled the Robinson-Patman Act “a powerful law” that is “losing 
a lot of its punch.”19 From 2006 through 2010, plaintiffs (often small businesses) won just 
4 percent of the Robinson-Patman cases brought in the federal courts; down from 35 per-
cent in the years 1982 to 1993.20 Furthermore, the federal government seldom brings a 
Robinson-Patman action. Nonetheless, as the following case illustrates, smaller businesses 
often do turn to Robinson–Patman in their ongoing struggle against what they believe to be 
the unfair competition of “giants.”

460  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
 According to defendants, when examined in this manner, the 
results are that approximately 88% of plaintiffs’ claims against 
particular defendants are based on five or fewer lost custom-
ers per year. . . . This amounts to only slightly more than 1% of 
the total BNPD transactions conducted by an average retail 
pharmacy during any one year (252/22,000).
 
In short, no matter how analyzed, the matching process 
identified only a de minimis number of lost customers and 
transactions.
* * * * *
DISCUSSION
. . . I now consider whether plaintiffs’ evidence, revealing as it 
does that plaintiffs lost only a trivial number of customers and 
sales to favored purchasers, is nevertheless sufficient to sup-
port a Robinson-Patman Act claim. . . .
The Robinson-Patman Act
* * * * *
In enacting Robinson-Patman, “Congress sought to target the 
perceived harm to competition occasioned by powerful buyers, 
rather than sellers; specifically, Congress responded to the ad-
vent of large chainstores, enterprises with the clout to obtain 
lower prices for goods than smaller buyers could demand.” 
Volvo, 546 U.S. at 175. The purpose of the Act is to prohibit “price 
discrimination only to the extent that it threatens to injure com-
petition.” Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco 
Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 220, 113 S.Ct. 2578, 125 L. Ed. 2d 168 (1993).
* * * * *
1. Competitive Injury
The Robinson-Patman Act prohibits price discrimination only 
“where the effect of such discrimination may be substantially 
to lessen competition.” 15 U.S.C. § 13(a). 
* * * * *
[A]fter reviewing all of the pertinent authorities, . . . I conclude 
that a Robinson-Patman claim requires a showing of substantial 
competitive injury and that the de minimis sales identified by the 
matching process are insufficient to establish such an injury. . . .
2. Antitrust Injury
. . . A plaintiff seeking to recover damages on a Robinson- 
Patman claim must establish an antitrust injury. 
* * * * *
Price discrimination does not entitle a disfavored purchaser to 
“automatic damages.” J. Truett Payne Co. v. Chrysler Motors 
Corp., 451 U.S. 557, 561, 101 S.Ct. 1923, 68 L. Ed. 2d 442 (1981). 
Rather,
* * * * *
 
Because they are essentially unable to match up a signifi-
cant number of the customers they lost with those the favored 
purchasers gained, plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate anti-
trust injury. . . .
CONCLUSION
For all these reasons, defendants’ motion for summary judg-
ment is granted.
Questions
1. Why did the retail pharmacies lose this case?
2. a.  In your opinion, have small pharmacies and small busi-
nesses generally lost significant revenue over the years 
to retail giants such as Walmart and Custom?  Explain.
 
b.  If so, does that loss constitute an antitrust wrong that 
should be remedied by law?  Explain.
3. In what sense does the Robinson–Patman Act arguably 
reduce efficiency, thus harming consumer welfare?
4. Texaco sold gasoline at its retail tank wagon prices to 
 Hasbrouck, an independent Texaco retailer, but granted 
 discounts to distributors Gull and Dompier. Dompier also 
sold at the retail level. Gull and Dompier both delivered 
their gas directly to retailers and did not maintain sub-
stantial storage facilities. During the period in question, 
sales at the stations supplied by the two distributors 
grew dramatically, while Hasbrouck’s sales declined. 
Hasbrouck filed suit against Texaco, claiming that the 
distributor discount constituted a Robinson–Patman vio-
lation. Texaco defended, saying the discount  reflected 
the services the distributors performed for Texaco, and 
that the arrangement did not harm competition. Decide. 
Explain. See  Texaco v. Ricky Hasbrouck, 496 U.S. 543 
(1990).
5. Utah Pie produced frozen pies in its Salt Lake City plant. 
Utah’s competitors, Carnation, Pet, and Continental, some-
times sold pies in Salt Lake City at prices beneath those 
charged in other markets. Indeed, Continental’s prices in 
Salt Lake City were beneath its direct costs plus overhead. 
Pet sold to Safeway using Safeway’s private label at a 
price lower than that at which the same pies were sold 
under the Pet label. Pet employed an industrial spy to infil-
trate Utah Pie and gather information. Utah Pie claimed 
that Carnation, Pet, and Continental were in violation of 
Robinson–Patman. Decide. Explain. See Utah Pie Co. v. 
Continental Baking Co., 386 U.S. 685 (1967).

Chapter Ten  Antitrust Law—Restraints of Trade  461
Predatory Pricing
Principal legislation—Sherman Act, Section 2.
 
Can a giant legally reduce its prices below operating costs until a competing discounter 
drops out of the market and then raise those prices to supracompetitive levels? In 2009, the 
European Commission fined Intel $1.45 billion for predatory pricing and other alleged 
misconduct. Essentially, Intel was accused of reducing prices for its chips by unlawfully 
paying rebates/discounts to computer manufacturers and retailers to persuade them not to 
use rival chips. Among other arguments, Intel claims the rebates had the desirable effect of 
saving money for consumers, but critics say consumer choice was reduced by discouraging 
deals with Intel rivals, resulting in higher prices and potentially reduced quality in the long 
term. Intel also agreed in 2009 to pay Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a smaller, rival 
 chipmaker, $1.25 billion to settle AMD’s allegations of predatory pricing (among other 
claims).21
 
Predatory pricing charges under European precedents have some reasonable probability 
of success, but in the United States they are very difficult to win. The U.S. Justice Depart-
ment claimed that American Airlines engaged in predatory pricing in attempting to mo-
nopolize air travel at the Dallas–Fort Worth Airport from 1995 to 1997. Justice argued that 
American Airlines lowered its prices to drive out seven discount carriers in the expectation 
that it could then recover its losses by charging monopoly prices. A federal court of ap-
peals, however, ruled for American Airlines, holding that the government was unable to 
prove that American had priced its flights below cost (as measured by some appropriate 
formulation, such as average variable cost).22 Thus, the government had failed to satisfy 
the standard U.S. two-part test for establishing predatory pricing:
• Pricing below cost.
• A “dangerous probability” of recouping the losses suffered from the below-cost pricing.23
The American Airlines decision could be seen as a great victory for consumers in that it 
supports the right to cut prices as low as possible. But consider BusinessWeek’s description 
of American’s pricing practices:
. . . Between Dallas and Kansas City, for instance, American’s average one-way ticket was 
$108 before low-cost start-up Vanguard Airlines Inc. entered the market in early 1995. That 
prompted American to cut fares to $80 and almost double the number of daily flights to 14. 
When Vanguard gave up in December 1995, American jacked up prices to $147 and scaled 
back the number of flights. Justice lawyers even had memos from American execs plotting 
the upstart’s demise.24
Antitrust Confronts Intellectual Property
When Google, Pfizer, Monsanto, Adobe, or any other technology innovator, big or small, 
introduces a new product we probably take for granted the resulting boost in the quality of 
our lifestyle, the jobs created, and the promise of additional advances in the future. More 
and more, however, our social and economic welfare is dependent on those  technological 

462  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
breakthroughs. In order to encourage and protect intellectual property innovations, the law 
provides patents and copyrights as shields to preserve the innovator’s rights. (For 
 additional patent and copyright materials, refer to the index in the back of this text.) 
 Preserving those rights, however, can lead to antitrust abuse since a patent or copyright 
often confers market power. In recent years, therefore, the federal government and legal 
experts have given attention to the increasing conflicts between antitrust law and intellectual 
property rights. Antitrust law, designed for smokestack industries, is struggling to adjust to 
our contemporary, knowledge-based economy. 
 
We believe patent and copyright laws encourage innovation and protect  creators’ legiti-
mate property interests, but we also believe in free access to knowledge as something of a 
 personal right and as a necessary precondition to continued progress and prosperity. We need 
the stimulus of antitrust-protected competition to lower prices and maximize consumer 
welfare, but we also need the shelter of intellectual property rights to encourage innovation 
and investment. If we do not use patents and copyrights (and sometimes trademarks) to 
protect intellectual property, will creative efforts be diminished? In providing intellectual 
property protection, however, do we open the door to monopoly behaviors? As one 
 high-tech blog put it, “Can Antitrust Law Stop Abuses of Intellectual Property and Free 
Access to Knowledge?”25 [For more about open global access to knowledge (a2k), see 
http://a2knetwork.org]
 
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that patents should not automatically be treated as 
monopolies.26 Abuse of the market power conferred by a patent, therefore, must be 
proven rather than presumed. And even if market power is established, an antitrust viola-
tion does not occur unless some competitive wrong is identified. As the Supreme Court 
said: “To safeguard the incentive to innovate, the possession of monopoly power will not 
be found unlawful unless it is accompanied by an element of anticompetitve conduct.”27 
Generally, intellectual property disputes are analyzed by the same antitrust reasoning—
monopoly,  exclusive dealing, tying arrangements, etc.—as is applied elsewhere in the 
economy.
 
The most notable current struggle features Apple versus Samsung with each basically 
accusing the other of patent theft involving the iPad2, the Galaxy Tab, and other handheld 
products. Apple won an initial skirmish in a California district court,28 but that decision is 
on appeal at this writing. The jury in that case found that Samsung had unlawfully copied 
certain essential patents (so-called standard essential patents or SEPs) controlled by App le. 
Similar lawsuits are playing out in at least eight other nations. But should the Apple and 
Samsung essential patents be protected by law if doing so accords market power to the pat-
ent holder? Indeed, the Antitrust Division of the federal Justice Department has warned 
patent holders to avoid harming competition by charging unjustified royalties or simply 
denying access to essential patents.29 To critics, some patent holders may be using their 
patent rights (sometimes bought in the open market by “patent trolls” seeking high license 
fees) to harm competition.
 
The Federal Trade Commission addressed these patent/antitrust conflicts in its 2013 
settlement with Google, which agreed to license, under reasonable terms, essential patents 
to its competitors, such as Apple. The settlement came after a lengthy FTC investigation of 
Google’s patent practices and its alleged dominance, particularly in the search engine mar-
ket. (For more on Google as an alleged monopolist, see Chapter 11.)

3. I operate two stores that sell recorded music. My business is being ruined by giant dis-
count store chains that sell their products for less than my wholesale cost. I thought 
there were laws against price discrimination, but I can’t afford the legal fees to fight the 
big corporations. Can you help?

a. Does it work? Explain.
b. How might it be altered?
c. Could we place more reliance on the market? Explain.
d. Do the statutes and case law, as a body, seem to form a rational package? Explain.
e. Should antitrust policy focus exclusively on economic considerations or should 
 social welfare goals (such as maintenance of full employment and the dispersal of 
political power) assume greater importance? Explain.
 2. In recent years, Amazon, Walmart, Target, and others have been dramatically 
 discounting some bestselling books; sometimes selling popular hardcover titles at 
 under $10. In Europe’s major publishing markets other than the United Kingdom, 
most new books, both print and online, must be sold at the price specified by the 
 publisher; that is, discount pricing is forbidden by law.
a. Why would Europeans accept antidiscounting laws that keep new book prices high?
b. How would you expect the antidiscounting laws to affect the prices of used books?
c. Germany, with a population of about 82 million, has about 7,000 bookstores while 
the United States, with a population of over 310 million, has about 11,000 book-
stores. Is America’s literary culture threatened by allowing giant retailers to aggres-
sively discount? Explain.
 3. Subway sandwich shops required all franchisees to employ a computerized point-of-
sale (POS) system. The only approved system was provided by an unrelated company,

 6. Pool Corporation, as the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies in 
the United States and the only distributor with a nationwide distribution system, was 
accused in 2011 by the Federal Trade Commission of abusing its market power by 
pressuring its product manufacturers to refrain from selling to those seeking to enter 
the market as pool supply distributors (and thus competitors of Pool Corporation). The 
FTC found that manufacturers representing about 70 percent of all pool product sales 
declined to sell to new entrants. The FTC calculated that Pool Corporation accounted 
for 30 to 50 percent of most pool supply manufacturers’ sales, making it by a wide 
margin the largest customer of those manufacturers.

Sharp published a list of suggested minimum retail prices, but its written dealership 
agreements with BEC and Hartwell did not obligate either to observe them or to charge 
any other specific price. BEC’s retail prices were often below Sharp’s suggested retail 
prices and generally below Hartwell’s retail prices, even though Hartwell too sometimes 
priced below Sharp’s suggested retail prices. Hartwell complained to Sharp on a number 
of occasions about BEC’s prices. In 1973, Hartwell gave Sharp the ultimatum that 
 Hartwell would terminate his dealership unless Sharp ended its relationship with BEC 
within 30 days. Sharp terminated BEC’s dealership. BEC filed suit alleging that Sharp

Starter also had a minimum order policy specifying that it wouldn’t deal with retailers 
who sought quantities beneath that minimum order. Trans Sport, a retailer, began selling 
Starter jackets to other retailers who did not meet Starter’s requirements. At that point, 
Starter declined to deal further with Trans Sport. Trans Sport then sued Starter.

 Introduction—Google, Microsoft, and Monopoly 
 Google Too Big? 
 Jeffrey Katz, Nextag CEO and Google competitor, thinks so:
Google . . . is the most popular search engine in the world, controlling 82 percent 
of the global search market and 98 percent of the mobile search market. Its annual 
revenue is larger than the economies of the world’s 28 poorest countries combined. 
And its closest competitor, Bing, is so far behind . . . that Google has become, ef-
fectively, a monopoly. 
 
In the United States, Google handles about two-thirds of all web searches, and it report-
edly controls about 75 percent of the search advertising market. Nonetheless, the Federal 
Trade Commission (FTC) ended a 19-month investigation of Google by announcing in 
early 2013 that it would not pursue litigation against the giant. Rather, Google issued a pair

 Microsoft a Monopolist? Is Microsoft an outsized, predatory lawbreaker, an amazing 
force for technological progress, or both?  The U.S. Justice Department, 18 states, and the 
 District of Columbia went to trial against Microsoft in 1998, claiming not that the software 
giant was too big, but that it had violated various antitrust laws in gaining and maintaining 
its market dominance. An epic legal struggle followed with major 
 elements of the American justice system challenging one of the 
world’s richest men, Bill Gates. 
 A federal district court in 2000 and later a federal court of 
 appeals ruled that Microsoft had violated federal antitrust laws by 
maintaining its 95 percent share of the Intel-compatible PC operat-
ing systems market through anticompetitive means (basically using 
its monopoly power to coerce customers to buy other Microsoft 
products such as its browser, Internet Explorer). 1 The district court 
judge ordered Microsoft split into two companies as a remedy for its antitrust wrongs, but 
the court of appeals threw out that order. Thereafter, the case was settled out of court with 
Microsoft agreeing, among other things, to not retaliate unfairly against other software and 
computer makers, to disclose some software code, and to be temporarily monitored by a 
federal judge. 
 
The settlement, though somewhat of a victory for Microsoft, might also be regarded as 
a victory for common sense in allowing Microsoft to go forward with its remarkable work. 
The decision places considerable faith in the market, as it probably should in America; but 
the case also represents a powerful affirmation of the government’s authority to attack 
monopoly behavior no matter how prominent the wrongdoer.  
of promises: (1) Google agreed to desist from scraping. Reportedly, Google, without per-
mission or compensation, was taking (“scraping”) reviews and other data from rival web-
sites for use on its own websites; and (2) Google agreed to ease practices that had 
discouraged advertisers using Google’s AdWords platform from simultaneously using ri-
val platforms. As noted in Chapter 10, Google also agreed to a legally binding Consent 
Order with the FTC to allow competitors fair, reasonable access to essential patents held 
by Google. No action was taken, however, regarding the critics’ biggest concern: Google’s 
alleged “search bias,” in which critics contend that Google’s search results are “rigged” to 
favor its own commercial interests. Nevertheless, the FTC unanimously concluded that 
Google’s search practices were not anticompetitive in that they were designed primarily to 
improve the quality of the product delivered to consumers. 
 
The FTC’s resolution of the Google investigation has been harshly criticized, but sup-
porters note that dissatisfied consumers have a number of choices in the search market. 
Investigations of Google continue in a number of states. Further, the European Union is 
expected to reach a settlement with Google that may include more sweeping concessions 
than those required by the United States.

 Settlements  As it turns out, the federal antitrust charges were only the beginning of 
 Microsoft’s battles. Settlements with Novell, Sun Microsystems, AOL, RealNetworks, and 
others cost Microsoft billions. European Union antitrust enforcers pursued Microsoft for a 
decade before settling their claims in 2009. The EU argument, much like the concerns in 
the United States, was that Microsoft’s market dominance allowed it to  effectively force its 
Windows operating system users to also use its Internet Explorer browser. The settlement 
required Microsoft to provide a pop-up screen that would allow European customers to 
choose among several browsers other than Explorer, thus likely building the  market share 
of rival browsers. Just as the 2009 settlement appeared to have resolved Microsoft’s Euro-
pean problems, the European Commission announced in 2013 that it had fined Microsoft 
over $730 million for breaking the terms of that settlement. Microsoft apologized for what 
it said was a technical problem that had temporarily denied about 15 million users the 
promised choice of browsers. The Microsoft struggles underline the aggressive stance of 
EU antitrust regulators. Since 25 percent of the global market for many products resides in 
the European Union, all big companies must now think more carefully about how their 
practices will be received by EU regulators even if those practices are not of concern to 
United States regulators.  
 The Microsoft saga serves as a reminder of an important truth: Capitalists, for the most part, 
don’t care much for capitalism. Their goal is to make money. And if they can do it without 
messy competition, so much the better. As long as it keeps its monopoly, Microsoft can af-
ford to share the wealth with its onetime rivals. For Microsoft, those fines and payments add 
up to less than a year’s profit from the operating system. For the others, it’s easier to take 
Microsoft’s money than fight. 2  
  The Microsoft battle was about whether a giant bullied its rivals, but 
it was also about the very nature of capitalism—that is, the role of 
managerial ethics, the market, and government in American life. 
The case obliges us to think about what we want America to be and 
what role the law should play in securing that ideal. Most crucially, we should ask our-
selves whether the market and ethics are sufficient to preserve genuine democracy and 
social justice, or whether we must employ antitrust law to attack those great concentrations 
of power that sometimes threaten our core values.  
 Questions 
 1. a.  Do you see increasing concentrations of wealth and power as threats to America’s 
long-term welfare? Explain.  
 
 b.  If that concentration is a concern, is antitrust law the best remedy? 
 2. Does the Microsoft case stand simply for the view that bigness is bad? Explain.  
 3. Critics have argued that technology is eliminating the imperfections of the market, 
 making antitrust law enforcement obsolete in this high-tech era. 
 
 a. Explain that argument. 
 
 b.  Now build the argument that high-tech industries may actually be especially sus-
ceptible to antitrust problems because of the need to maintain equipment 
 compatibility.  
 Whether a giant bullied 
its rivals.  

470  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
 Part One—Monopoly 
 Both the federal district court and the court of appeals in the Microsoft case concluded that 
the computer giant held monopoly power in the Intel-compatible PC operating systems 
market. How did those courts reach that conclusion? How do we know when an organization 
is an unlawful monopolist? An extensive, sophisticated, evolving system of analysis has 
emerged. [For the American Bar Association Antitrust section, see  www.americanbar.org/
groups/antitrust_law.html ]  
 Principal Monopoly Legislation: Sherman Act, Section 2 
 Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with 
any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the sev-
eral States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony punishable by a fine.  
 Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act applies to antitrust cases although the 
wisdom of that use is disputed.  
  Monopoly Defined  From an economic viewpoint, a monopoly is a situation in which one 
firm holds the power to control prices and/or exclude competition in a particular market. 
The general legal test for monopolization is:  
 1. The possession of monopoly power in the relevant market, and 
  2. The willful acquisition or maintenance of that power, as distinguished from growth or 
development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic 
 accident. 3 
 Thus, the critical inquiries are the percentage of the market held by the alleged monopolist 
and the behavior that produced and maintained that market share. Antitrust law does not 
punish efficient companies who legitimately earn and maintain large market shares.  
   
Indeed, high market concentration often promotes competition, whereas a fragmented 
market of many small firms may produce higher prices. (Imagine a retail food market of 
many corner grocery stores and no supermarkets.) Nonetheless, the federal government 
continues to rely strongly on market concentration data (structure) in combination with 
evidence of actual behavior (conduct) to identify anticompetitive situations. Market share 
alone is highly unlikely to lead to antitrust action, but a high market share acquired and/or 
maintained via abusive conduct (as alleged in Microsoft) may be challenged. 
 Oligopoly A few firms sharing monopoly power constitute an oligopoly. Oligopolistic 
markets are common in American life, and they have emerged in some increasingly 
 concentrated global markets as well. A recent   New York Times   headline read: “Rising Beer 
Prices Hint at Oligopoly.”  4  
 
As The New York Times noted, we fear that oligopoly conditions will lead to higher 
prices (along with reduced quality and innovation). In industries such as telecom, food 
processing, credit ratings, and book publishing, we find enormous American and interna-
tional markets dominated by a handful of companies. Of course, oligopolies often produce 
significant efficiencies, and they may leave market space for smaller competitors,  including 

Chapter Eleven  Antitrust Law—Monopolies and Mergers  471
startups. But in many cases, we worry that oligopolies threaten consumer welfare. We see, 
for example, that only four railroads (Burlington Northern Santa Fe, CSX, Norfolk South-
ern, and Union Pacific) control approximately 90 percent of the rail freight market. Rail 
freight rates have been advancing, according to a Fortune inquiry, by about 6 percent per 
year while shipping rates by truck and air have increased about 1 to 2 percent per year.5 
And for the nation’s many “captive” companies (served by one railroad), “rates are sky-
rocketing.”6 Not coincidentally, railroads enjoy government-granted exemptions from 
many antitrust rules. At the same time, a rather obscure federal agency, the Surface Trans-
portation Board, is tasked with oversight of the rail industry. Furthermore, the railroads 
note that they enjoy only modest returns on capital, and they point to the huge investments 
they have made in upgrading their equipment and tracks. The railroads also argue that they 
are in direct competition with truck and air transport, although critics say those options are 
not feasible for many customers.
Apple a Monopoly?
In late April 2012, Business Insider, citing Apple’s dominance in the mobile phone and 
tablet markets, argued that the “decline of Android signals the rise of Apple’s monopoly.” 
In recent years, other critics have pointed to Apple’s nearly 70 percent share of the online 
music market.
 
Then, in mid-November 2012, Michael Wolff wrote in USA Today that “the age of Ap-
ple may be over.” As Wolff explained, Apple became America’s most valuable company 
in 2012 with its shares selling as high as $700, but then Apple’s share price fell back dra-
matically in part because Samsung became a powerful competitor in the smartphone mar-
ket. At the same time, Samsung tripled its tablet share to 18.4 percent while Apple’s tablet 
share fell from 60 to 50 percent in one year .
 
In 2013, the Ninth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals dismissed a class action by iPod 
and iTunes buyers claiming that Apple is a monopolist. Analyst Tim Worstall, writing in 
Forbes, says that we should worry less about monopolies in the tech area because of their 
fleeting nature: “No one actually gets a monopoly for long enough to be able to fleece 
consumers through having that monopoly.” 
Questions
1. In your view, does the government, through antitrust law, have a useful, meaningful 
role to play in regulating high-tech companies such as Apple, Samsung, and Google? 
Explain.
2. Will the market automatically correct, in rather rapid fashion, any monopolistic condi-
tions that may develop in the high-tech arena? Explain.

472  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
 Monopolization Analysis 
 Although the case law is not a model of clarity, a rather straightforward framework for 
monopoly analysis has emerged:  
 1. Define the relevant product market. 
 2. Define the relevant geographic market. 
 3. Compute the defendant’s market power. 
 4. Assess the defendant’s intent (predatory or coercive conduct).  
 5. Raise any available defenses. 
 1. Product Market 
 Here the court seeks, effectively, to draw a circle that encompasses categories of goods in 
which the defendant’s products or services compete and that excludes those not in the 
same competitive arena. The fundamental test is interchangeability as determined primar-
ily by the price, use, and quality of the product in question.  
 
An analysis of cross-elasticity of demand is a key ingredient in defining the product 
market. Assume that two products, X and Y, appear to be competitors. Assume that the 
price of X doubled and Y’s sales volume was unchanged. What does that tell us about 
whether X and Y are, in fact, in the same product market?  
 
Defining the product market is really the process we all go through in routine pur-
chasing decisions. Assume you feel a rather undefined hunger for salty snack food. 
You go to the nearby convenience store. Many options confront you, but for simplic-
ity, let’s confine them to chips, nuts, and popcorn. Of course, each of those food types 
is composed of variations. As you sort through the choices—corn chips, cheese curls, 
peanuts, potato chips, and so on—you employ the criteria of price, use, and quality in 
focusing your decision. In so doing, you are defining the product market for “salty 
snack food.” Products closely matched in price, use, and quality are interchangeable, 
and thus are competitors in the same product market. But, for example, an imported 
salty cheese at $10 per quarter pound presumably is not in the same product market as 
salted sunflower seeds.  
 
Expressed as a matter of elasticity, the critical question becomes something like the 
 following: If the price of potato chips, for example, falls by 10 percent, does the sales vol-
ume of salted nuts likewise fall? If so, we have a strong indication that potato chips and 
salted nuts lie in the same product market and thus are competitors.  
 2. Geographic Market 
 Once the product market has been defined, we still must determine where the product 
can be purchased. The judicial decisions to date offer no definitive explanation of the 
geographic market concept. A working definition might be “any section of the country 
where the product is sold in commercially significant quantities.” From an economic 
perspective, the geographic market is defined by elasticity. If prices rise or supplies are 
reduced within the geographic area in question (New England, for example) and demand 
remains steady, will products from other areas enter the market in a quantity sufficient to 

Chapter Eleven  Antitrust Law—Monopolies and Mergers  473
affect price and/or supply? If so, the geographic market must be broadened to embrace 
those new sources of supply. If not, the geographic market is not larger than the area in 
question (New  England). Perhaps a better approach is to read the cases and recognize 
that each  geographic market must simply be identified in terms of its unique economic 
properties.  
 3. Market Power (Market Share) 
 Does the market share held by the defendant threaten competition? How large that share 
must be to raise monopoly concerns depends on a variety of considerations including how 
fragmented or concentrated the market is.  The Harvard Law Review , however, notes some 
approximate boundaries: 
 Market share above 70 percent typically suffices to support an inference of monopoly power. 
Conversely, courts have rarely found monopoly power when a firm’s market share is below 
50 percent, leaving some uncertainty as to market shares between 50 and 70 percent.  7 
 Market share alone, however, does not establish monopoly power. Barriers to entry, 
 economies of scale, the strength of the competition, trends in the market, and pricing 
 patterns all help to determine whether the market remains competitive despite a single 
firm’s large share. (Why are the courts interested in barriers to entry?) 
 4. Intent (Predatory or Coercive Conduct) 
 Assuming a threatening market share is established, the next requirement is proof of 
an intent to monopolize. Remember that a monopoly finding requires a showing of 
both  market power (structure) and willful acquisition or maintenance of that power 
(conduct). Antitrust law is not designed to attack legitimately earned market power. 
Rather, the  concern lies with those holding monopoly power that was acquired or 
maintained wrongfully. Thus, a showing of deliberate, predatory, coercive, or unfair 
conduct (such as collusion leading to price fixing) will normally suffice to establish 
the requisite intent.  
 
Intel, the dominant microchip maker with 80 to 90 percent of the microprocessor mar-
ket, reached a 2010 settlement of Federal Trade Commission charges that it used unfair 
tactics to earn and maintain that market share. Basically, Intel was accused of providing 
discriminatory rebates to Dell, IBM, HP, and others in return for those purchasers’ agree-
ment not to buy central processing unit chips from Intel’s rival, Advanced Micro Devices 
(AMD). Intel was also accused of designing its chips so that competing processors could 
not run efficiently with them. Among other terms, the FTC settlement prohibits those prac-
tices. In 2009, Intel agreed to pay $1.25 billion to settle claims AMD brought in a patent 
and antitrust lawsuit, and the European Union fined Intel a record $1.45 billion for antitrust 
offenses. [Explain why giving discounts could constitute an antitrust violation and defend 
Intel against those charges. See Edward Wyatt and Ashlee Vance, “Intel Settles with 
F.T.C. on Antitrust,”  The New York Times , August 4, 2010 ( www.nytimes.com/ ); and 
Stephen Labaton, “Intel Facing Antitrust Investigation,”  The New York Times , June 7, 
2008 ( www.nytimes.com )]. 

474  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
 Attempted Monopolization 
 The Sherman Act forbids attempts to monopolize as well as monopoly itself. In the 1993 
 Spectrum Sports decision, 8 the Supreme Court set out a three-part test for attempted 
 monopolization: (1) that the defendant has engaged in predatory or anticompetitive  conduct 
with (2) a specific intent to monopolize and (3) a dangerous probability of achieving 
 monopoly power (by which the court was insisting on evidence of some “realistic” 
 likelihood that monopoly would actually follow). 
 Is Bob Marley a Product Market? 
 Music producer Rock River released remixed Bob Marley and the Wailers recordings in 
2006. Universal Music Group claimed exclusive rights to those recordings and sent “cease 
and desist” orders to music distributors (Amazon, iTunes, etc.) who immediately discon-
tinued sale of the Rock River remix. Rock River then sued Universal alleging attempted 
monopoly of the reggae genre of sound recordings in the United States, among other 
claims. Rock River alleged that Universal “accounted for 81 percent of the reggae sound 
recordings sold, and Bob Marley recordings accounted for 76 percent of the total reggae 
recordings sold.”  
 Questions 
 1. Is reggae music, in your judgment, an identifiable product market? Explain. 
  2.   Universal claimed there were no significant barriers to entry in the alleged reggae 
 music market. Explain why the absence of barriers to entry would be a significant 
 consideration in resolving the case. 
 3. Assuming Universal’s share of the alleged product market was correctly calculated by 
Rock River, who will win this lawsuit? Explain.

 Monopoly Case I 
  The case that follows is a private antitrust action involving a claim by Christy Sports, a 
Utah ski rental company, that Deer Valley Resort Company (DVRC), a ski resort developer/
operator, had monopoly power over Deer Valley Resort’s ski rental business and that 
DVRC abused that power to harm Christy Sports.  
 5. Defenses 
 The defendant may yet prevail if the evidence demonstrates that the monopoly was inno-
cently acquired via “superior skill, foresight, or industry;” that is, the monopoly was earned. 
Sometimes a monopoly may be “thrust upon” the monopolist because the  competition failed 
or because of “natural monopoly” conditions where the market will support only one firm 
or where large economies of scale exist (such as for electricity suppliers).  

 
 DVRC opened a mid-mountain ski rental outlet in 2005. In 
August of that year, the resort notified Christy that, beginning 
the following year’s ski season, the restrictive covenant would 
be enforced and Christy would no longer be allowed to rent 
skis.   Christy believes that DVRC issued the same message to 
Cole’s, leaving DVRC as the only rental ski provider at Deer 
Valley, with the exception of a small operation at the Stein 
Eriksen Lodge, which serves its own lodgers. This leaves that 
  majority of skiers who fly into Salt Lake City and then shuttle to 
Deer Valley with few choices: they can carry  unwieldy ski 
equipment onto the plane, take a shuttle into Park City and 
hunt for cheaper ski rentals in town, or rent from the more 
conveniently located DVRC location. Christy predicts, not 
 improbably, that most consumers will choose the third  option. 
 
 Christy argues that DVRC’s decision to begin enforcing its 
restrictive covenant is an attempt to monopolize the market of 
ski   rentals available to destination skiers in Deer Valley, or, 
alternatively, to the destination skiers in the mid-mountain 
 village itself. It alleges that by eliminating its competitors, 
DVRC will be able to increase prices and reduce output, thus 
 harming consumers. The complaint states that the number of 
skis available for rental mid-mountain will decline by 620 pairs, 
and the price will increase by at least twenty-two to thirty-two 
percent.  
 
 The district court dismissed Christy’s antitrust complaints. 
 II. ANALYSIS 
 * * * * * 
 Christy has alleged that DVRC violated Section 2 of the Sherman 
Act by either actual or attempted monopolization. . . . Under 
both types of Section 2 claims Christy must plead both power 
in a relevant market  and anticompetitive conduct. The relevant 
market, according to Christy’s complaint, is the market for ski 
rentals to  destination skiers in Deer Valley in general or, even 
more narrowly, the market for ski rentals in the mid-mountain 
village. The alleged anticompetitive conduct is the enforce-
ment of the restrictive covenant.  
 
  A great many pages in the briefs are devoted to whether 
the defined market set forth in the complaint–destination skiers 
at   Deer Valley, or alternatively at Deer Valley’s mid-mountain 
village–is too small to constitute a market for antitrust pur-
poses, in light of the proximity of a number of ski rental outlets 
in Park City, just down the road. For purposes of  analyzing the 
complaint, however, we find it not implausible that destination 
skiers who arrive at the resort by bus or shuttle will find it 
 sufficiently inconvenient to travel into town to rent skis that a 
 Circuit Judge McConnell 
 When the Deer Valley Resort Company (“DVRC”) was devel-
oping its world-renowned ski resort in the Wasatch Moun-
tains,  it sold parcels of land within the resort village to third 
parties, while reserving the right of approval over the conduct 
of  certain ancillary businesses on the property, including ski 
rentals. For about years, DVRC granted permission to Cole 
  Sports and plaintiff-appellant Christy Sports to rent skis in 
competition with its own ski rental outlet. More recently, how-
ever, DVRC revoked that permission, presumably in order to 
gain more business for its own newly opened mid-mountain 
ski rental store. The question is whether this revocation vio-
lated the antitrust laws.  
 I. BACKGROUND 
 Deer Valley is one of three resorts in the vicinity of Park City, 
Utah. Many–indeed, “the vast majority,” according to the 
   Complaint of Deer Valley’s patrons are destination skiers who 
fly into Salt Lake City and then take a forty-five minute bus or 
shuttle ride to the resort. The resort itself is divided into two 
areas: the base area, located at the bottom of the   mountain, 
and the ritzier mid-mountain village, located halfway up the 
slope. DVRC has always been the sole provider of ski rentals 
at the base area, but at the mid-mountain village, Christy and 
Cole Sports have operated rental facilities; DVRC  itself opened 
a mid-mountain ski rental facility in 2005.  
 
 Originally, DVRC owned all the property at the mid-mountain 
village, but over the years it has sold parcels to third parties. In 
1990, DVRC sold one such parcel to S.Y. and Betty Kimball, 
subject to a restrictive covenant that prohibited use of the 
 property for either ski rental or real estate sales office pur-
poses without DVRC’s express written consent. The Kimballs 
built a commercial building and leased space in it to Christy’s 
corporate predecessor, Bulrich Corporation. The lease 
 expressly prohibited both the rental of skis and the operation 
of a real estate office. The next year, though, DVRC  gave 
 Bulrich permission to rent skis in return for 15% of the rental 
revenue. When Bulrich merged with another  company in 1994 
and formed Christy Sports, LLC, Christy continued to operate 
the rental business. According to the  complaint, Christy 
stopped paying DVRC 15% of its rental revenue in 1995, though 
the reason for this change is unknown. Christy rented skis at 
the Deer Valley mid-mountain village with no objection from 
DVRC until 2005. During that time,  DVRC was the sole purveyor 
of rental skis at the base area but did not have a ski rental 
 operation at mid-mountain.

successful monopolist over ski rental at  Deer Valley could 
charge supracompetitive prices. The question, we believe, is 
not whether DVRC might be able to raise   prices and reduce 
output by becoming the only purveyor of rental skis at the re-
sort, but whether such a market is legally  cognizable under the 
antitrust laws and whether the decision of a resort owner to 
reserve to itself the right to provide  ancillary services counts 
as anticompetitive conduct.  
 * * * * * 
 
 We begin our analysis with DVRC’s original decision to im-
pose the restrictive covenant.  
 A. IMPOSITION OF THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANT 
  We agree with the defendant that the creator of a resort has 
no obligation under the antitrust laws to allow competitive 
 suppliers of ancillary services on its property. A theme park, 
for example, does not have to permit third parties to open  res-
taurants, hotels, gift shops, or other facilities within the park; it 
can reserve to itself the right to conduct such  businesses and 
receive revenues from them. Accordingly, if it sells land within 
the resort to third parties, the antitrust laws do not bar the re-
sort owner from imposing a covenant against use of the prop-
erty for competitive businesses. This is so even if food, rooms, 
gifts, or other ancillary goods and services would be cheaper 
and more plentiful if the resort owner allowed  competition in 
these businesses.  
 
 This conclusion can be reached either by reference to the 
proper definition of a market or by reference to the absence of 
 anticompetitive conduct. Some courts, faced with cases of 
this sort, have found the market definition implausible. The 
 Seventh Circuit took this approach in  Elliott  v.  United Center, 
 126 F.3d 1003 (7th Cir. 1997), when a peanut vendor   challenged 
a sports arena’s decision to ban outside food and thereby 
 monopolize the market for food concessions within the arena. 
The court rejected that market definition as implausible, 
 saying: 
 The logic of [the] argument would mean that exclusive 
restaurants could no longer require customers to purchase 
their wines only at the  establishment, because the 
restaurant would be “monopolizing” the sale of wine within 
its interior. Movie theaters, which traditionally   (and 
notoriously) earn a substantial portion of their revenue 
from the sale of candies, popcorn, and soda, would be 
required by the antitrust laws to allow patrons to bring 
their own food.  
 * * * * * 
 
 Although discussion of sports arenas . . . seems to suggest 
that Christy’s shortcomings lie with its alleged  geographic 
market, the actual problem lies with its product market. In 
these cases the two are difficult to disentangle because the 
product (rental skis . . .) is intimately related to the location. 
Consumers do not  travel to Deer Valley for rental skis. . . . The 
true  product in these cases is the overall experience. Deer 
Valley offers a cluster of products that combine to create a 
destination ski experience; rental skis are only one small 
 component. . . . 
 
 The complaint alleges nothing to suggest that destination 
skiers  are choosing their ski resort based on the price of rental 
skis, separate and apart from the cluster of services associ-
ated with the destination-ski experience. To define one small 
component of the overall product as the relevant product mar-
ket is simply implausible.  
 
  Alternatively, one could say that the monopolization 
claim would fail because the alleged conduct is not anti-
competitive.  Even if a firm has monopoly power in a relevant 
market, a plaintiff must also show “the willful acquisition or 
  maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or 
development as a consequence of a superior product, busi-
ness acumen, or historic accident.”   Grinnell Corp.,  384 U.S. 
at 570-71. Deer Valley is not required to invite competitors 
 onto its property to rent skis to its patrons, even if a failure 
to do so would mean it is the sole supplier of rental skis at 
the  ski area.  
 
 The Supreme Court has recognized the economic value of 
allowing businesses to decide with whom they will deal, as it 
recently re-emphasized: “[A]s a general matter, the Sherman 
Act ‘does not restrict the long recognized right of [a] trader or 
manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business, freely 
to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with 
 whom he will deal.’”  Verizon Commc’ns, Inc.  v.  Law Offices of 
Curtis V. Trinko, LLP,  540 U.S. 398, 408 (2004).  In  Trinko,   the 
Court  acknowledged that in rare circumstances a refusal to 
 cooperate with competitors might constitute a Section 2 
violation, but that “such exceptions, because of the uncertain 
 virtue of forced sharing and  the difficulty of identifying and 
remedying anticompetitive conduct by a single firm,” should 
be few.  
 
 Having invested time and money in developing a premier 
ski resort that attracts skiers from across the nation, DVRC 
could recoup its investment in a number of ways. It could in-
crease the price of lift tickets, raise room rates, serve only 
 high-priced food, or, as it seems to have chosen, delve more 
deeply into the rental ski market. . . .  This does not mean consum-
ers have no protection. The ski resort industry is  competitive 
(and Christy does not allege otherwise). Families contemplat-
ing ski vacations have many options, and they presumably 
compare quality and price. If they are rational, the price they 
476  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust

Chapter Eleven  Antitrust Law—Monopolies and Mergers  477
are concerned about is the sum of all of their   prospective va-
cation costs, including not just lift ticket prices and resort 
lodging, but air fare, food and drink, apres-ski entertainment, 
ski rentals, and the like. A resort that facilitates lower ski 
rental prices by allowing competition is able to  price other as-
pects of the ski vacation experience more aggressively. The 
competitive discipline comes not from introducing  competition 
with respect to each component of the experience, but from 
competition with other ski resorts with   respect to the entire 
package. Christy has not alleged, and it would not likely be 
plausible to allege, that DVRC’s decision to foreclose competi-
tion in the ski rental business at the mid-mountain village will 
have any effect on the market for ski resort  vacations as a 
whole.  
 
  Indeed, allowing resorts to decide for themselves what 
blend of vertical integration and third-party competition will 
produce the highest return may well increase competition in 
the ski resort business as a whole, and thus benefit consum-
ers. This flexibility about business strategies induces entrants 
into the ski resort business by allowing them to reserve the 
benefits of   their investments to themselves. . . . 
 
 Either line of reasoning–whether based on market 
 definition or lack of anticompetitive conduct–leads to the 
same conclusion. Indeed, they are two sides of the same 
coin: having created a resort destination, antitrust will not 
force a resort developer to share its internal profit-making 
opportunities with competitors. The relevant market 
 requirement reaches this  result by finding implausible a 
market definition that singles out a small component of the 
cluster of services that constitutes   the actual product; the 
anticompetitive conduct requirement reaches it by saying 
that it is not anticompetitive to refuse to  grant access to 
competitors.  
 * * * * * 
 
 Although Christy insists that it has shown anticompetitive 
effects by its allegations of a decline in quantity and increase 
in price of rental skis at the mid-mountain village, this is just a 
repackaging of the argument rejected above.  A resort operator’s 
ability to reserve to itself the operation of ancillary businesses 
within the resort is not dependent on the  quantity of output 
 being as high or the price being as low as they would be if there 
were competition from third parties within the resort. It de-
pends, instead, on either the proposition that a market that in-
volves only one component of an interrelated package of 
services is not a relevant market for purposes of the Sherman 
Act or that it is not anticompetitive  conduct for a resort owner 
to refuse to invite competitors to supply ancillary services 
within its resort. The fact . . .  that fewer skis will be available 
for rental and that prices for rental skis will be higher, does not 
refute either of these legal propositions.

 Monopoly Case II 
 The Syufy case that follows reflects what may be the dominant “ideological” view of mo-
nopoly among federal court judges. The decision embodies the free-market philosophy of the 
Reagan and Bush administrations and their judicial appointees, and it suggests an increasing 
judicial acceptance of the position that dominant market shares may be earned and main-
tained legitimately—particularly where competition can easily enter the market. Remember, 
Chapter Eleven  Antitrust Law—Monopolies and Mergers  477

478  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
however, the Microsoft lesson that a dominant share gained and/or 
maintained by anticompetitive practices is impermissible.  
 The  Syufy case is also notable because Judge Kozinski, in the spirit 
of the facts, managed to insert nearly 200 movie titles in his 25-page 
opinion (only a small portion of which is reprinted here).  
Judge Kozinski managed 
to insert nearly 200 
movie titles.
Soon theaters in Las Vegas were paying some of the highest 
license fees in the nation, while distributors sat back and 
watched the easy money roll in.  
   
It is the nature of free enterprise that fierce, no-holds-
barred competition will drive out the least effective partici-
pants in the market, providing the most efficient allocation of 
productive resources. And so it was in the Las Vegas movie 
market in 1982. After a hard-fought battle among several 
 contenders, Syufy gained the upper hand. Two of his rivals, 
Mann Theatres and Plitt Theatres, saw their future as rocky 
and decided to sell out to Syufy. While Mann and Plitt are 
 major exhibitors nationwide, neither had a large presence in 
Las Vegas. Mann operated two indoor theaters with a total of 
three screens; Plitt operated a single theater with three 
screens. Things were relatively quiet until September 1984; in 
September Syufy entered into earnest negotiations with 
Cragin Industries, his largest remaining competitor. Cragin 
sold out to Syufy midway through October, leaving Roberts 
Company, a small exhibitor of mostly second-run films, as 
 Syufy’s only competitor for first-run films in Las Vegas. 
   
It is these three transactions—Syufy’s purchases of the 
Mann, Plitt, and Cragin theaters—that the Justice Department 
claims amount to antitrust violations. As government counsel 
 explained at oral argument, the thrust of its case is that “you may 
not get monopoly power by buying out your competitors.”. . .  
 DISCUSSION 
 * * * * * 
 [O]f significance is the government’s concession that Syufy was 
only a monopsonist, not a monopolist. Thus the government ar-
gues that Syufy had market power, but that he  exercised this 
power only against suppliers (film distributors), not against con-
sumers (moviegoers). This is consistent with the record, which 
demonstrates that Syufy always treated  moviegoers fairly: The 
movie tickets, popcorn, nuts, and the Seven-Ups cost about the 
same in Las Vegas as in other, comparable markets. While it is 
 Circuit Judge Kozinski 
 Suspect that giant film distributors like Columbia, Paramount, 
and Twentieth Century Fox had fallen prey to Raymond Syufy, 
the canny operator of a chain of Las Vegas, Nevada, movie 
theaters, the U.S. Department of Justice brought this civil anti-
trust action to force Syufy to disgorge the theaters he had pur-
chased in 1982–84 from his former competitors. The case is 
unusual in a number of respects: The Department of Justice 
concedes that moviegoers in Las Vegas suffered no direct in-
jury as a result of the allegedly illegal transactions; nor does 
the record reflect complaints from Syufy’s bought-out com-
petitors, as the sales were made at fair prices and not precipi-
tated by any monkey business; and the supposedly oppressed 
movie companies have weighed in on Syufy’s side. The Jus-
tice Department nevertheless remains intent on rescuing this 
platoon of Goliaths from a single David.  
 
 After extensive discovery and an eight-and-a-half day trial, 
the learned district judge entered comprehensive findings of 
fact and conclusions of law, holding for Syufy. He found, inter 
alia, that Syufy’s actions did not injure competition because 
there are no barriers to entry—others could and did enter the 
market—and that Syufy therefore did not have the power to 
control prices or exclude the competition. . . .  
 FACTS 
 Gone are the days when a movie ticket cost a dime, popcorn a 
nickel, and theaters had a single screen: This is the age of the 
multiplex. With more than 300 new films released every year—
each potentially the next Batman or E.T.—many successful 
theaters today run a different film on each of their 6, 12, or 18 
screens. . . .  
   
Raymond Syufy understood the formula well. In 1981 he 
entered the Las Vegas market with a splash by opening a six-
screen theater. Newly constructed and luxuriously furnished, 
it put existing facilities to shame. Syufy’s entry into the Las 
 Vegas market caused a stir, precipitating a titanic bidding war.

Chapter Eleven  Antitrust Law—Monopolies and Mergers  479
theoretically possible to have a middleman who is a monopolist 
upstream but not downstream, this is a somewhat counterintui-
tive scenario. Why, if he truly had significant market power, 
would Raymond Syufy have chosen to take advantage of the big 
movie distributors while giving a fair shake to ordinary people? 
And why do the distributors, the alleged victims of the monopo-
lization scheme, think that Raymond Syufy is the best thing that 
ever happened to the Las Vegas movie market?  
 * * * * * 
 
There is universal agreement that monopoly power is the 
power to exclude competition or control prices. . . .  
 1. Power to Exclude Competition 
 It is true, of course, that when Syufy acquired Mann’s, Plitt’s, 
and Cragin’s theaters he temporarily diminished the number of 
competitors in the Las Vegas first-run film market. But this 
does not necessarily indicate foul play; many legitimate mar-
ket arrangements diminish the number of competitors. . . . If 
there are no significant barriers to entry, however, eliminating 
competitors will not enable the survivors to reap a monopoly 
profit; any attempt to raise prices above the competitive level 
will lure into the market new competitors able and willing to 
offer their commercial goods or personal services for less. . . .  
 * * * * * 
 
The district court. . . . found that there were no barriers to 
entry in the Las Vegas movie market. . . . Our review of the re-
cord discloses that the district court’s finding is amply sup-
ported by the record.  
 * * * * * 
   
Immediately after Syufy bought out the last of his three com-
petitors in October 1984, he was riding high, having captured 100 
percent of the first-run film market in Las Vegas. But this utopia 
proved to be only a mirage. That same month, a major movie 
distributor, Orion, stopped doing business with Syufy, sending 
all of its first-run films to Roberts Company, a dark-horse com-
petitor previously relegated to the second-run market. Roberts 
Company took this as an invitation to step into the major league 
and, against all odds, began giving Syufy serious competition in 
the first-run market. Fighting fire with fire, Roberts opened three 
multiplexes within a 13-month period, each having six or more 
screens. By December 1986, Roberts was operating 28 screens, 
trading places with Syufy, who had only 23. At the same time, 
Roberts was displaying a healthy portion of all first-run films. In 
fact, Roberts got exclusive exhibition rights to many of its films, 
meaning that Syufy could not show them at all.  
 
By the end of 1987, Roberts was showing a larger percent-
age of first-run films than was the Redrock multiplex at the 
time Syufy bought it. Roberts then sold its theaters to United 
Artists, the largest theater chain in the country, and Syufy con-
tinued losing ground. It all boils down to this: Syufy’s acquisi-
tions did not short-circuit the operation of the natural market 
forces; Las Vegas’s first-run film market was more competitive 
when this case came to trial than before Syufy bought out 
Mann, Plitt, and Cragin.  
 
The Justice Department correctly points out that Syufy still 
has a large market share, but attributes far too much impor-
tance to this fact. In evaluating monopoly power, it is not mar-
ket share that counts, but the ability to maintain market share. 
. . . Syufy seems unable to do this. In 1985 Syufy managed to 
lock up exclusive exhibition rights to 91 percent of all the first-
run films in Las Vegas. By the first quarter of 1988, that per-
centage had fallen to 39 percent; United Artists had exclusive 
rights to another 25 percent, with the remaining 36 percent 
being played on both Syufy and UA screens.  
 
Syufy’s share of box office receipts also dropped off, albeit 
less precipitously. In 1985 Syufy raked in 93 percent of the 
gross box office from first-run films in Las Vegas. By the first 
quarter of 1988, that figure had fallen to 75 percent. The gov-
ernment insists that 75 percent is still a large number, and we 
are hard-pressed to disagree, but that’s not the point.  
 * * * * * 
  The numbers reveal that Roberts/UA has steadily been eating 
away at Syufy’s market share: In two and a half years, Syufy’s 
percentage of exclusive exhibition rights dropped 52 percent 
and its percentage of box office receipts dropped 18 percent. 
During the same period, Roberts/UA’s newly opened theaters 
evolved from absolute beginners, barely staying alive, into a 
big business.  
 * * * * * 
 2. Power to Control Prices 
 The crux of the Justice Department’s case is that Syufy, top gun 
in the Las Vegas movie market, had the power to push around 
Hollywood’s biggest players, dictating to them what prices they 
could charge for their movies. The district court found other-
wise. This finding too has substantial support in the record.  
 
Perhaps the most telling evidence of Syufy’s inability to set 
prices came from movie distributors, Syufy’s supposed victims. 
At the trial, distributors uniformly proclaimed their satisfaction 
with the way the Las Vegas first-run film market operates; none 
complained about the license fees paid by  Syufy. . . . Particularly 
damaging to the government’s case was the testimony of the 
former head of distribution for MGM/UA that his company 
“never had any difficulty . . . in acquiring the terms that we 
thought were reasonable,”. . . explaining that the license fees 
Syufy paid “were comparable or better than any place in the 
United States. And in most cases better.”. . .  
Chapter Eleven  Antitrust Law—Monopolies and Mergers  479

480  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
 
The documentary evidence bears out this testimony. Syufy 
has at all times paid license fees far in excess of the national 
average, even higher than those paid by exhibitors in Los 
 Angeles, the Mecca of Moviedom. In fact, Syufy paid a higher 
percentage of his gross receipts to distributors in 1987 and 
1988 than he did during the intensely competitive period just 
before he acquired Cragin’s Redrock.  
 
While successful, Syufy is in no position to put the squeeze 
on distributors. . . .

Adidas sued the NCAA claiming, among other things, that 
the advertising restrictions constitute an attempted mo-

Sanford Weill, one of the most famous names in banking 
history and the architect of one of the biggest financial 
mergers, the 1998 combination of Citicorp and Travelers 
Group, spoke to America’s ongoing financial crisis in 2012:
What we should probably do is go split up investment 
baking from banking, have banks be deposit-takers, 
have banks make commercial loans and real estate 
loans, have banks do something that’s not going to risk 
the taxpayer dollars, that’s not too big to fail.”
By 2006 Weill had relinquished his Citicorp duties, and his 
colossal bank was reduced to taking huge government 
bailout funds during the recent financial crisis. His strategy 
had failed his bank and arguably threatened the welfare of 
the nation. Weill was reduced, basically, to calling for a 
return to the 1933 Glass–Steagall Act (separating 
 commercial and investment banking), which Congress re-
pealed in 1999, much to the delight of Wall Street bosses.

 It was not inevitable that it should always anticipate increases in the demand for ingots 
and be prepared to supply them. Nothing compelled it to keep doubling and redoubling 
its capacity before others entered the field. It insists that it never excluded competitors;

new opportunity as it opened, and to face every newcomer with new capacity already

blocked any other airline’s access to its CRS, but they had charged fees (in American’s

CRS). United and American each controlled about 12 to 14 percent of the total air trans-

 Part Two—Mergers 
 At this writing in 2013, merger activity remains generally flat following the recession, but 
corporations are holding vast pools of cash so a new merger boom is not out of the ques-
tion. The two most notable recent mergers are the $23 billion takeover of Pittsburgh 
ketchup maker, H.J. Heinz, by 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway, and the $11 billion 
merger of American Airlines and US Airways, creating the world’s largest airline. The 
American Airlines  and US Airways merger had been challenged by the federal Justice 
Department, but a settlement was reached requiring the combined airline (to be called 
American Airlines Group) to sell dozens of take-off and landing slots at key airports to 
discount competitors. At the same time, a private antitrust action has been filed claiming 
the merger may result in higher fares, reduced capacity, and other problems. American and 
US Airways say the merger will lower costs and allow American Airlines Group to better 
compete with entrenched giants Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. The government be-
lieves the settlement, giving low-cost airlines a bigger foothold at key airports, will pro-
duce more competitive pricing.  
 
In general, the Obama Justice Department and the FTC have kept a close eye on poten-
tially threatening mergers. Indeed, government resistance in 2011 caused AT&T, the na-
tion’s second-largest cell phone company, to give up its 2011 plan to acquire T-Mobile 
(fourth largest) for some $39 billion. Had the deal gone through, AT&T and Verizon 
would have controlled two-thirds of all wireless subscribers and about 80 percent of wire-
less revenue.11 Regulators said the merger would have led to higher prices and lower-
quality products in a less-competitive mobile wireless market. Nonetheless, The Wall 
Street Journal criticized the government’s market intervention:  
 Never mind that the FCC [recently] said that wireless competition was thriving and that most con-
sumers have the choice of five or more providers. Or that market leader Verizon and third-largest 
player Sprint weren’t about to roll over. . . . Or that new competitors are entering the market. . . .12  
   
Sometimes mergers and the risk of rising consumer prices may be necessary to save 
failing companies, as was claimed by supporters of the US Airways and American Airlines 

Chapter Eleven  Antitrust Law—Monopolies and Mergers  483
deal. Sterne Agee analyst Jeff Kauffman advised that the bankrupt American could not 
stand alone:
We believe that the stand-alone plan would have left [American] with a disadvantaged in-
frastructure, too small to compete effectively with carriers 40 percent larger for business 
travel, and too large to be a niche carrier and compete with carriers smaller and more 
nimble.13
Thus, some mergers may be consid ered a business necessity, but not infrequently they are 
much better for shareholders than for consumers. The New York Times in 2010 cited a 
study finding higher prices in oil after Pennzoil  acquired Quaker State, in tampons after 
Procter & Gamble bought Tambrands, in  cereal after General Mills acquired Chex 
brands, and in scotch whiskey after the merger of  Guinness and Grand Metropolitan. 14 
Nonetheless, in a global economy where  oligopolies increasingly mark the landscape, 
mergers can make a great deal of economic sense.  
 Why? Technological change, efficiency enhancement, and piles of available cash are 
often important motivators for merger activity; but the big drivers often are growth oppor-
tunities and cost cutting. Many companies have extracted maximum value from their own 
products, making growth possible only by purchasing new lines, and cost savings have 
become essential in fierce global competition.  
 Merger Virtues 
 Mergers often have clearly beneficial effects. Some of the potential virtues of mergers 
include:  
 1. Mergers permit the replacement of inefficient management, and the threat of replace-
ment disciplines managers to be more productive.  
 2. Mergers may permit stronger competition with previously larger rivals. 
 3. Mergers may improve credit access. 
 4. Mergers may produce efficiencies including economies of scale. 
 5. Mergers frequently offer a pool of liquid assets for use in expansion and in innovation. 
 6. Very often, mergers offer tax advantages. 
 7. Growth by merger is often less expensive than internal growth. 
 8. Mergers help satisfy the personal ambitions and needs of management.15 
 In 2011, the federal government approved, with restric-
tions, a merger giving Comcast, the cable TV giant, a con-
trolling interest in the NBC television network. Among 
other concerns, critics feared the merger would allow 
Comcast to arbitrarily favor NBC channels over those of 
competitors. Then in 2013, Comcast announced it was 
 buying the remaining 49 percent of NBCUniversal. From the 
inception of the merger discussions, one of the parties 
most concerned was the Santa Monica,  California-based 
Tennis Channel, which feared Comcast would favor its 
own sports channels (Golf Channel and NBC Sports Net-
work) over the Tennis Channel and other independents.

 Merger Problems 
 Many studies show that mergers often fail in the sense that they do not add value to the 
merging companies. Experts generally estimate the merger failure rate, measured in 
 various ways, at between 50 and 80 percent. As  CNN.com 
 described it, “Mergers Fail More Often than Marriages.”  16 In 
 addition to those frequent financial failures, other merger hazards 
should be noted:  
 1. Too much power is being concentrated in too few hands. 
 2. A particular merger, although not threatening in and of itself, may trigger a merger 
 movement among industry competitors. 
 3. Higher market concentration may lead to higher prices. 
 4. Innovation may be harmed. 
 5. Some companies are so large that they can significantly shape political affairs. 
 6. Some companies may have become so large that we cannot allow them to fail. 17 
When Should the Government Intervene? The U.S. Justice Department faced that 
question in reviewing Anheuser-Busch InBev’s (ABI) proposed $20.1 billion acquisition 
of the 50 percent of Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo not already owned by ABI.18 In 
early 2013, the Justice Department filed civil antitrust charges to block that deal; later 
that year the case was settled when ABI agreed to sell all of Grupo Modelo’s U.S. assets 
(including beers such as Corona and Pacifico) and some other holdings to  Constellation 
Brands, one of the world’s largest wine companies.
 
Justice’s core concern was that the acquisition would eliminate Modelo as a restraint on 
ABI’s capacity to raise prices, increase its market share, and coordinate pricing policies with 
the remaining brewers. Justice noted that ABI had been raising prices with regularity and that 
even small price increases could lead to billions in total increased costs for consumers.19 The 
“Mergers Fail More Often 
than Marriages.”
   
The Tennis Channel filed a complaint with the Federal 
Communications Commission alleging that Comcast is vio-
lating the law and the terms of the merger agreement by 
favorable placement for the Golf Channel and NBC Sports 
Network while leaving the Tennis Channel on a little-
watched sports tier. Comcast says the channel place-
ments reflect market realities and a long-term contract 
signed when the Tennis Channel was a start-up. In 2012, 
the FCC ruled for the Tennis Channel finding that Comcast 
was violating federal antidiscrimination carriage rules. At 
this writing, the case is on appeal at the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the D.C. Circuit (Case No. 12-1337) where the pri-
mary questions appear to be the statute of limitations for 
such complaints and whether restrictions on Comcast’s 
treatment of the Tennis Channel would violate Comcast’s 
freedom of speech.   
 Questions 
 1. Do you think Comcast has a responsibility to treat the 
independent Tennis Channel the same as its own affili-
ate sports networks, including the Golf Channel and 
NBC Sports Network? Explain.  
 2. If you were running a business would you treat all of 
your customers the same, regardless of their contribu-
tions to your bottom line? Explain.   
3. In your view, should the government require Comcast 
to treat the Tennis Channel as well as it treats its own 
sports channels? Explain.

Justice Department also feared that the absorption of Modelo could result in reduced innova-
tion. The settlement apparently diminished those Justice Department reservations. 
 
ABI, SABMiller, and Grupo Modelo jointly control 72 percent of the $80 billion U.S. beer 
market.20 ABI, the world’s largest brewer, is the product of a 2008 merger between Anheuser-
Busch and InBev, a Belgian-Brazilian goliath. The international brewing market has been con-
solidating rapidly such that a few companies are now dominant. ABI itself reportedly has 
announced a total of 15 takeovers since the middle of 2008.21 Of course, small craft breweries 
have been an exploding market, although they still account for only about 6 percent of sales.22
 
On the other hand, the acquisition likely will help ABI reduce costs, a matter of particular 
concern for Budweiser whose sales have slumped for 25 consecutive years.23 Further, the ac-
quisition will strengthen ABI for what The New York Times has referred to as “the big beer fight 
of the 21st century;” the competition for lucrative new markets in China, India, Latin America, 
and the wealthier nations in Africa.24 International competiti on is already fierce with ABI chal-
lenged by Denmark’s Carlsberg, Britain’s SABMiller, and Japan’s Asahi. Thus, ABI and many 
experts argue that the merger is simply part of a much larger global pattern of consolidation 
necessary to operate efficiently. Indeed, since InBev acquired Anheuser-Busch, the new or-
ganization cut costs by several billion dollars and instituted tighter organizational controls.  
 Merger Law: Overview 
 Mergers are addressed by the Sherman Act, Section 1; but the Clayton Act, Section 7, 
 offers the primary legislative oversight: 
 That no person engaged in commerce shall acquire the whole or any part of the stock or the 
assets of another person engaged also in commerce where the effect of such acquisition may 
be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend to create a monopoly.  
 
Technically, a merger involves the union of two or more enterprises wherein the 
 property of all is transferred to the one remaining firm. However, antitrust law embraces 
all those situations in which previously independent business entities are united—whether 
by acquisition of stock, purchase of physical assets, creation of holding companies, 
 consolidation, or merger. 
 
Mergers fall, somewhat awkwardly, into three categories: 
 1. A horizontal merger involves firms that are in direct competition and occupy the same 
product and geographic markets. A merger of two vodka producers in the same 
 geographic market would clearly fall in the horizontal category. Would the merger of a 
vodka producer and a gin producer constitute a horizontal merger?  
 2. A vertical merger involves two or more firms at different levels of the same channel of 
distribution, such as a furniture manufacturer and a fabric supplier.  
 3. A conglomerate merger involves firms dealing in unrelated products. Thus, the 
 conglomerate category embraces all mergers that are neither horizontal nor vertical. An 
example of such a merger would be the acquisition of a pet food manufacturer by a 
book publisher. (Conglomerate mergers currently receive little attention from the 
 government, and we will not examine them further.) 

486  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
 Premerger Notification  Under the Hart–Scott–Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (HSR), 
mergers and acquisitions must be reported to the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice 
Department if those deals exceed certain dollar thresholds that change annually in accord with 
the gross national product. [For more HSR threshold details, see  www.ftc.gov/bc/hsr/index
.shtm  ] The parties are barred from closing the merger until 30 days after they have made the 
required HSR filing unless the waiting period is shortened (as it often is) or lengthened by the 
FTC or the Justice Department. The merging firms are required to provide documentation 
about the merger’s impact on competition. The waiting period gives the government time and 
information by which to determine whether the merger should be challenged.  
 Remedies  After the HSR review, the government may decide that the merger is not 
threatening, and it will be allowed to proceed. The government may, on the other hand, 
conclude that the merger is anticompetitive. If the parties persist with a disfavored merger, 
the government can file suit. The preferred action, however, is to work out an agreeable 
settlement. A settlement might involve one of the parties selling some of its assets as we 
saw in the US Airways and American Airlines settlement explained above, or agreeing to 
forgo business in some geographic segment of the market for a time. Rental car stalwart 
Hertz, in 2012, secured FTC approval for its $2.3 billion acquisition of Dollar Thrifty (par-
ent of the Dollar and Thrifty car rental brands) only after agreeing to sell both its Advan-
tage car rental business and 29 existing Dollar Thrifty on-airport locations. The FTC feared 
reduced competition at 72 airports nationwide. Hertz has a 26 percent share of the U.S. 
airport car rental market and Thrifty h olds a 12 percent share. Enterprise is the largest car 
rental company, trailed by Hertz and Dollar Thrifty, while fourth-place Advantage is now 
expected to become an effective competitor in the market.25 
 
In cases where negotiation fails and the government decides to sue, it can ask the court 
for a remedy, such as an order stopping the merger or an order requiring divestiture of 
certain assets. Government litigation is infrequent, but the resulting message to the 
 business community is powerful. Furthermore, private parties commonly use the antitrust 
laws to sue for treble damages when they believe a merger has harmed them unlawfully. 
The threat of those private actions as well as government oversight helps maintain a mar-
ketplace where consumers are offered the benefits of vigorous competition including lower 
prices, improved quality, and innovation. [To read summaries of recent  developments in 
antitrust law, see  Antitrust Today at  www.antitrusttoday.com/ ]

“Mega-Mergers,” at  www.businessinsider.com/stephen-colbert-att-2011-3] 
 Horizontal Analysis 
 Horizontal mergers raise anticompetitive risks because direct rivals seek to join  together. 
Horizontal merger analysis ordinarily follows the FTC/Justice Department merger guide-
lines, which focus on a pair of concerns: 
 1. Coordinated effects/collusion. Will the merger facilitate cooperation so that the  parties 
might fix prices, reduce output, reduce quality, or otherwise coordinate their activities 

Chapter Eleven  Antitrust Law—Monopolies and Mergers  487
rather than competing against each other? Broadly, the government takes the position 
that fewer firms and thus greater market concentration increases the likelihood of 
 collusion—a position the courts often, but not always, embrace. 
 2. Unilateral effects. Will the merger allow a firm to unilaterally raise prices, restrict 
output, or control innovation? Normally, unilateral effects arise with products that 
 significantly restrain each other prior to the merger. A merger’s removal of a rival could 
allow the newly merged entity to exercise market power.   
 Market Power 
 Broadly, the guidelines are designed to identify mergers that may result in market power, 
defined as the ability of a seller “profitably to maintain prices above competitive levels for 
a significant period of time.” The guidelines set out a five-step methodology for analyzing 
horizontal mergers: 
 1. Market definition.  
 2. Measurement of market concentration. 
 3. Identification of likely anticompetitive effects. 
 4. Likelihood of future entrants to the market. 
 5. Appraisal of efficiencies and other possible defenses. 
 Market 
 The market will be defined as the smallest product and geographic market in which a hy-
pothetical monopolist could raise prices a small but significant and nontransitory amount 
(usually set at 5 percent above current prices).  
 Market Concentration 
  The Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) is employed to measure market concentration. 
Notwithstanding the formidable title, the index is computed quite easily. The market share 
of each firm is squared and the results are summed. Thus, if five companies each had 
20 percent of a market, the index for that market would be 2,000. The HHI is useful be-
cause it measures both concentration and dispersion of market share between big and small 
firms. If 10 firms each have 10 percent of the market, the resulting HHI is 1,000. The 
larger the HHI, the more concentrated the market. In general, a postmerger HHI below 
1,500 would reflect an unconcentrated market while a postmerger concentration of be-
tween 1,500 and 2,500 would be considered mildly concentrated and more than 2,500 a 
highly concentrated market. The greater the HHI and the greater the increase in the HHI, 
the more likely the government will be concerned about the merger. Thus, the aforemen-
tioned American Airlines and U.S. Airways merger with an HHI of 1,269 among the top 
four carriers in the national market (American after the merger—20 percent, 
 Southwest—18 percent, United Continental—17 percent, and Delta—16 percent) would 
be classified as “unconcentrated.”26
 
The guidelin es provide that the potential for competitive concern also depends on the 
analysis of additional factors, such as a change in the number of competitors along with 
adverse effects and ease of entry, as explained below. Broadly, the government’s guide-
lines reject the older notion of market size alone as a threat to the welfare of the economy. 

488  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
 Adverse Effects 
 The basic point here is the government’s worry that the merger may permit monopoly be-
havior in the merged firm’s market.  
 Ease of Entry 
 If new competitors can readily enter the postmerger market, the existing firms will be forced 
to charge competitive prices and otherwise conform to the discipline of the market.  
 Defenses 
 An otherwise unacceptable merger may be saved by certain defenses. The  failing company 
doctrine permits a merger to preserve the assets of a firm that would  otherwise be lost to 
the market. Efficiencies include such desirable economic results as economies of scale or 
reduced transportation costs as a result of the merger. 
 Guideline Changes 
 In 2010, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission announced revisions to the 
Horizontal Merger Guidelines that bring the Guidelines more in line with actual government 
practice. Much of the analysis will continue as outlined above, but a key  revision involves a 
reduced role for market definition/market share and increased attention to likely adverse 
 competitive effects. The new reasoning is that the analysis will begin in identifying practical, 
real-world competitive harm (such as customer injury, reduced  innovation, or reduced product 
variety) at which point market definition and the balance of the analysis outlined above would 
be influential. This approach may, therefore, allow the government greater flexibility in 
 proving competition problems even if high market shares cannot be established. Future 
 antitrust decisions will indicate how closely the courts actually follow the new guidance.  
 Horizontal Merger Blocked  
 The Justice Department’s successful 2011 challenge to a proposed horizontal merger be-
tween tax preparers H&R Block and TaxACT illustrates many of the aforementioned con-
siderations described to evaluate the legality of a horizontal merger. Judge Beryl Howell at 
the District Court for the District of Columbia agreed with the Justice Department that the 
relevant product market was digital do-it-yourself (DDIY) tax preparation products (thus 
excluding assisted and manual tax preparation) with the three largest firms controlling 
90 percent of the market (Intuit—62.2 percent, HRB—15.6 percent, and  TaxACT—
12.8 percent) and the remaining 10 percent split among a number of smaller firms. The 
merger would have increased the HHI in the DDIY market by 400 points to 4,691. The 
court concluded that H&R Block had failed to show that collusion would not result in what 
would have become a highly concentrated postmerger market.   
 
Judge Howell also considered various company documents; in one H&R Block allegedly 
said the merger would allow it to “regain control of industry pricing and avoid further price 
erosion.” When looking at anticompetitive effects from the proposed merger, the court rea-
soned that TaxACT’s “impressive history of innovation and competition in the DDIY mar-
ket,” had been important in constraining prices, a role that would have disappeared had the 

Chapter Eleven  Antitrust Law—Monopolies and Mergers  489
 Vertical Analysis 
 A vertical merger typically involves an alliance between a supplier and a purchaser. The 
primary resulting threat to competition is labeled market foreclosure. As illustrated in Fig-
ure 11.1, a vertical merger may deny a source of supply to a purchaser or an outlet for sale 
to a seller, thus potentially threatening competition in violation of the Clayton Act. The 
government would then look closely at that foreclosure to determine whether it actually 
has an anticompetitive effect. In addition to foreclosing sources of supply or outlets for 
sale, the government may be concerned about other anticompetitive effects such as raising 
rivals’ costs, facilitating collusion, and raising barriers to entry.

 Vertical Merger Challenge The government has practiced a generally lenient approach to 
vertical mergers, but under some conditions they will be challenged. That was the case with 
the Ticketmaster–Live Nation merger that was largely vertical in 
character although it  included some horizontal features. Ticketmaster, 
the nation’s  largest ticketing company, also owns a controlling share 
in Front Line Management whose 200-plus clients include the Eagles 
and Miley Cyrus. 27 Live Nation, the country’s largest concert promoter, was a recent entrant 
to the ticketing business.  28   Live Nation also owns or manages 135 major concert venues 
around the world, is the world’s largest artist-management company, and operates related 
businesses including online fan clubs and T-shirts. 29 Obama administration antitrust officials

efficiencies would accompany the merger, Judge Howell ruled for the government.  
 
H&R Block announced that it would not appeal. For the government, the victory was 
important evidence of its commitment to vigorous antitrust oversight.

tion, and (3) the transaction’s probable effect on competition in 
the product and geographic markets.  
 II. The Geographic Market 
 One of the few issues about which the parties to this case do 
not disagree is that metropolitan areas are the appropriate geo-
graphic markets for analyzing the competitive effects of the pro-
posed merger. In its first amended complaint, the FTC identified 
42 such metropolitan areas as well as future areas which could 
suffer anticompetitive effects from the proposed merger. . . .  
 III. The Relevant Product Market 
 * * * * * 
 The Commission defines the relevant product market as “the 
sale of consumable office supplies through office superstores,” 
with “consumable” meaning products that consumers buy 
 recurrently, i.e., items which “get used up” or discarded. For 
example, under the Commission’s definition, “consumable 
 office supplies” would not include capital goods such as com-
puters, fax machines, and other business machines or office 
furniture, but does include such products as paper, pens, file 
folders, self-stick notes, computer disks, and toner cartridges. 
The defendants characterize the FTC’s product market 
 definition as “contrived” with no basis in law or fact, and 
counter that the appropriate product market within which to

 BACKGROUND 
 * * * * * 
 Staples is the second largest office superstore chain in the 
United States with approximately 550 retail stores located in 
28  states and the District of Columbia, primarily in the 
 Northeast and California. In 1996, Staples’ revenues from 
those stores were approximately $4 billion through all 
 operations. Office Depot, the largest office superstore chain, 
operates over 500 retail office supply superstores that are 
 located in 38 states and the District of Columbia, primarily in 
the South and  Midwest. Office Depot’s 1996 sales were ap-
proximately $6.1 billion. OfficeMax, Inc., is the only other office 
supply  superstore firm in the United States.  
   
On September 4, 1996, defendants Staples and Office 
 Depot . . . entered into an “Agreement and Plan of Merger” 
whereby . . . Office Depot would become a wholly owned 
 subsidiary of Staples. . . . The FTC filed this suit on April 9, 1997, 
seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunc-
tion against the merger. . . .  
 I. Discussion 
  Analysis of the likely competitive effects of a merger requires 
determinations of (1) the “line of commerce” or product market 
in which to assess the transaction, (2) the “section of the 
 Federal Trade Commission v.

however, because the merger partners and the Justice Department in 2010 agreed to a settle-
ment allowing the creation of the new company—to be called Live Nation Entertainment. 
Ticketmaster agreed to divest itself of one of its ticketing divisions while licensing its ticket-
ing software to a competitor, thus effectively allowing the creation of two new competitors 
for Ticketmaster. The newly merged firm also agreed to Justice Department monitoring to 
enforce “tough anti-retaliation provisions” so Live Nation Entertainment will not be able to 
abuse its power in ticketing, concert venues, artist management, and concert touring. 31

assess the likely competitive consequences of a Staples– 
Office Depot combination is simply the overall sale of office 
products, of which a combined Staples–Office Depot ac-
counted for 5.5 percent of total sales in North America in 1996.  
 * * * * * 
 
The general rule when determining a relevant product 
market is that “[t]he outer boundaries of a product market are 
determined by the reasonable interchangeability of use [by 
consumers] or the cross-elasticity of demand between the 
product itself and substitutes for it.” Interchangeability of use 
and cross-elasticity of demand look to the availability of sub-
stitute commodities, i.e., whether there are other products of-
fered to consumers which are similar in character or use to 
the product or products in question. . . .  
   
[T]he Commission has argued that a slight but significant 
 increase in Staples–Office Depot’s prices will not cause a 
 considerable number of Staples–Office Depot’s customers to 
purchase consumable office supplies from other nonsuperstore 
alternatives such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Quill, or Viking. On the 
other hand, the Commission has argued that an increase in 
price by Staples would result in consumers turning to another 
office superstore, especially Office Depot, if the consumers had 
that option. Therefore, the Commission concludes that the sale 
of consumable office supplies by office supply superstores is 
the appropriate relevant product market in this case, and 
 products sold by competitors such as  Wal-Mart, Best Buy, 
 Viking, Quill, and others should be  excluded. . . .  
   
The Court acknowledges that there is, in fact, a broad mar-
ket encompassing the sale of consumable office supplies by 
all sellers of such supplies, and that those sellers must, at 
some level, compete with one another. However, the mere fact 
that a firm may be termed a competitor in the overall market-
place does not necessarily require that it be included in the 
relevant product market for antitrust purposes. The Supreme 
Court has recognized that within a broad market,  “well-defined 
submarkets may exist which, in themselves, constitute prod-
uct markets for antitrust purposes.”  
 * * * * * 
 
[In defining the submarket] the FTC focused on what it 
termed the “pricing evidence.”. . . First, the FTC presented evi-
dence comparing Staples’ prices in geographic markets 
where Staples is the only office superstore, to markets where 
Staples competes with Office Depot or OfficeMax, or both. 
Based on the FTC’s calculations, in markets where Staples 
faces no office superstore competition at all, something which 
was termed a one-firm market during the hearing, prices are 
13 percent higher than in three-firm markets where it com-
petes with both Office Depot and OfficeMax.  
 * * * * * 
   
This evidence suggests that office superstore prices are af-
fected primarily by other office superstores and not by nonsuper-
store competitors such as mass merchandisers like Wal-Mart, 
Kmart, or Target, wholesale clubs such as BJ’s, Sam’s, and Price 
Costco, computer or electronic stores such as Computer City 
and Best Buy, independent retail office supply stores, mail-order 
firms like Quill and Viking, and contract stationers.  
 * * * * * 
   
In addition, Staples’ own pricing information shows that 
warehouse clubs have very little effect on Staples’ prices.  
 * * * * * 
   
There is similar evidence with respect to the defendants’ 
behavior when faced with entry of another competitor. The 
evidence shows that the defendants change their price zones 
when faced with entry of another superstore, but do not do so 
for other retailers.  
 * * * * * 
 
Despite the high degree of functional interchangeability 
between consumable office supplies sold by the office super-
stores and other retailers of office supplies, the evidence pre-
sented by the Commission shows that even where Staples and 
Office Depot charge higher prices, certain consumers do not 
go elsewhere for their supplies. This further demonstrates that 
the sale of office supplies by non-superstore retailers is not 
responsive to the higher prices charged by Staples and Office 
Depot in the one-firm markets. This indicates a low cross-
elasticity of demand between the consumable office supplies 
sold by superstores and those sold by other sellers.  
 * * * * * 
   
The Court has observed that office supply superstores look 
far different from other sellers of office supplies. Office supply 
superstores are high-volume, discount office supply chain 
stores averaging in excess of 20,000 square feet, with over 
11,000 of those square feet devoted to traditional office 
 supplies, and carrying over 5,000 SKUs of consumable office 
supplies in addition to computers, office furniture, and other 
nonconsumables. In contrast, stores such as Kmart devote 
 approximately 210 square feet to the sale of approximately 
250 SKUs of consumable office supplies. Kinko’s devotes 
 approximately 50 square feet to the sale of 150 SKUs. Both 
Sam’s Club and Computer City each sell approximately 200 SKUs.  
 
In addition to the differences in SKU numbers and variety, 
the superstores are different from many other sellers of office 
supplies due to the type of customer they target and attract. 
The superstores’ customer base overwhelmingly consists of 
Chapter Eleven  Antitrust Law—Monopolies and Mergers  491

492  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
small businesses with fewer than 20 employees and consum-
ers with home offices. In contrast, mail-order customers are 
typically midsized companies with more than 20 employees. . . .  
 * * * * * 
 
[T]he Court finds that the unique combination of size, se-
lection, depth, and breadth of inventory offered by the super-
stores distinguishes them from other retailers.  
 * * * * * 
   
While it is clear to the Court that Staples and Office Depot do 
not ignore sellers such as warehouse clubs, Best Buy, or Wal-
Mart, the evidence clearly shows that Staples and Office Depot 
each consider the other superstores as the primary competition.  
 * * * * * 
 
[T]he Court finds that the sale of consumable office sup-
plies through office supply superstores is the appropriate rel-
evant product market for purposes of considering the possible 
anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger between Sta-
ples and Office Depot.  
 * * * * * 
 IV. Probable Effect on Competition 
  [T]he Court next must consider the probable effect of a merger 
between Staples and Office Depot in the geographic markets 
previously identified. One way to do this is to examine the con-
centration statistics and HHIs within the geographic markets. If 
the relevant product market is defined as the sale of consumable 
office supplies through office supply superstores, the HHIs in 
many of the geographic markets are at problematic levels even 
before the merger. Currently, the least concentrated market is 
that of Grand Rapids–Muskegon–Holland, Michigan, with an HHI 
of 3,597, while the most concentrated is Washington, D.C., with 
an HHI of 6,944. In contrast, after a merger of Staples and Office 
Depot, the least concentrated area would be Kalamazoo–Battle 
Creek, Michigan, with an HHI of 5,003, and many areas would 
have HHIs of 10,000. The average increase in HHI caused by the 
merger would be 2,715 points. The concentration statistics show 
that a merged Staples–Office Depot would have a dominant mar-
ket share in 42 geographic markets across the country. The com-
bined shares of Staples and Office Depot in the office superstore 
market would be 100 percent in 15 metropolitan areas. It is in 
these markets the postmerger HHI would be 10,000. In 27 other 
metropolitan areas, where the number of office superstore com-
petitors would drop from three to two, the postmerger market 
shares would range from 45 percent to 94 percent, with post-
merger HHIs ranging from 5,003 to 9,049. Even the lowest of these 
HHIs indicates a “highly concentrated” market.  
 * * * * * 
 
The HHI calculations and market concentration evidence, 
however, are not the only indications that a merger between 
Staples and Office Depot may substantially lessen competi-
tion. Much of the evidence already discussed with respect to 
defining the relevant product market also indicates that the 
merger would likely have an anticompetitive effect. The evi-
dence of the defendants’ own current pricing practices, for 
example, shows that an office superstore chain facing no 
competition from other superstores has the ability to profita-
bly raise prices for consumable office supplies above com-
petitive levels. The fact that Staples and Office Depot both 
charge higher prices where they face no superstore compe-
tition demonstrates that an office superstore can raise prices 
above competitive levels. The evidence also shows that de-
fendants also change their price zones when faced with en-
try of another office superstore, but do not do so for other 
retailers.  
 * * * * * 
 V. Entry into the Market 
  “The existence and significance of barriers to entry are frequently, 
of course, crucial considerations in a rebuttal  analysis. . . .”  
 * * * * * 
 
The Commission offered Office 1 as a specific example of 
the difficulty of entering the office superstore arena. Office 1 
opened its first two stores in 1991. By the end of 1994, Office 1 
had 17 stores, and grew to 35 stores operating in 
11  Midwestern states as of October 11, 1996. As of that date, 
Office 1 was the fourth largest office supply superstore chain 
in the United States. Unfortunately, also as of that date, Office 
1 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Brad Zenner, 
president of Office 1, testified through declaration that Office 1 
failed  because it was severely undercapitalized in comparison 
with the industry leaders, Staples, Office Depot, and Office-
Max. In addition, Zenner testified that when the three leaders 
 ultimately expanded into the smaller markets where Office 1 
stores were located, they seriously undercut Office 1’s retail 
prices and profit margins. Because Office 1 lacked the capi-
talization of the three leaders and lacked the economies of 
scale enjoyed by those competitors, Office 1 could not remain 
profitable.  
 
For the reasons discussed above, the Court finds it 
 extremely unlikely that a new office superstore will enter the 
market and thereby avert the anticompetitive effects from 
 Staples’ acquisition of Office Depot.

 VI. Efficiencies 
 * * * * * 
 First, the Court notes that the cost savings estimate of 
$4.947 billion over five years which was submitted to the 
Court  exceeds by almost 500 percent the figures presented 
to the two Boards of Directors in September 1996, when the 
Boards approved the transaction. The cost savings claims 
submitted to the Court are also substantially greater than 
those represented in the defendants’ Joint Proxy Statement/
Prospectus “reflecting the best currently available estimate 
of management,” and filed with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission on January 23, 1997. . . .  
 * * * * * 
   
[T]he Court cannot find that the defendants have rebutted 
the presumption that the merger will substantially lessen com-
petition . . .  
 CONCLUSION 
 * * * * * 
  [T]he Court finds that the Commission has shown a 
 likelihood that it will succeed in proving, after a full admin-
istrative trial on the merits, that the effect of the proposed 
merger between Staples and Office Depot “may be sub-
stantially to lessen competition” in violation of Section 7 of 
the Clayton Act. . . . The FTC’s motion for a preliminary 
 injunction shall be granted.  
 AFTERWORD 
 Citing the time and money involved in battling the federal 
 government, Staples and Office Depot officially called off their 
proposed merger days after Judge Hogan’s decision.
 
In 2013, 16 years after the rejection of the Staples and Of-
fice Depot merger, the Federal Trade Commission allowed af-
ter careful investigation the merger of Office Depot and Office 
Max (the nation’s second- and third-largest office supply su-
perstores). The FTC concluded that the competitive dynamics 
in the market had changed in those years. Online sales have 
seen explosive growth and the big box retailers (Walmart, 
 Target, etc.) have significantly expanded their supply of office 
products, thus producing a broader product market than the 
configuration on which the Staples court settled . The two de-
cisions show that a close look at the specifics of the market is 
required on a case-by-case basis.  
 Questions 
 1. a.  What “general rule” did the Staples court employ in 
 determining the relevant product market? 
 
 b.  What evidence supported the use of the “office supply 
superstore submarket” as the relevant product market?  
 2. a.    What evidence supported the FTC’s claim that the 
merger would lead to anticompetitive effects?  
 
 b.  In weighing the “public and private equities,” why did 
the court come down on the side of the government?  
 3. Analysts have argued that in the Staples case the govern-
ment was less worried about market shares than about the 
price impact of the merger were it to be approved. Explain 
what those analysts meant.  
 4. Three firms controlled the $1 billion U.S. baby food market 
(Gerber—65 percent, Heinz—17.4 percent, and 
 Beech-Nut—15.4 percent). Gerber was sold in over 90 per-
cent of American supermarkets, and it had greater brand 
loyalty than any other product sold in the United States. 
Heinz was sold in 40 percent of the supermarkets and 
Beech-Nut in 45 percent. The baby food HHI was 4775, 
which would increase by 510 HHI points if Heinz and Beech-
Nut were to merge. Heinz and Beech-Nut agreed to merge. 
The Federal Trade Commission opposed the merger.  
 
 a.  What other facts would you want to know to decide the 
legality of this proposed merger?  
 
 b. Defend the merger. 
 
 c.  Decide. Explain. See  Federal Trade Commission v. H. J. 
Heinz Co. , 246 F.3d 708 (D.C. Cir. 2001). 
 5. In 1958, Pabst Brewing Company acquired Blatz Brewing 
Company. Pabst was America’s 10th largest brewer, while 
Blatz was the 18th largest. After the merger, Pabst had 
4.49 percent of the nationwide beer market and was the 
fifth-largest brewer. In the regional market of  Wisconsin, 
Michigan, and Illinois, the merger gave Pabst 11.32 percent 
of the sales. After the merger, Pabst led beer sales in 
 Wisconsin with 23.95 percent of that statewide market. The 
beer market was becoming  increasingly concentrated, 
with the total number of brewers declining from 206 to 162 
during the years 1957 to 1961. In  United States v. Pabst 
Brewing Co.  , 384 U.S. 546 (1966), the Supreme Court found 
the merger violated the Clayton Act, Section 7. The Court 
did not choose among the three geographic market con-
figurations,  saying that the crucial inquiry is whether a 
merger may substantially lessen competition anywhere in 
the United States. Thus the Court held that, under these 
facts, a 4.49 percent share of the market was too large.  
 
 
 Respected scholar and jurist Richard Posner labeled 
the Pabst decision an “atrocity” and the product of a “fit of 
nonsense” on the part of the Supreme Court. 32 What 
 economic arguments would support Posner’s colorful 
complaint?    .

494  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
 Part Three—American Antitrust Laws and the International Market 
 America’s commercial market embraces the entire globe. Antitrust questions can become 
extremely complex in transactions involving multiple companies in multiple nations, 
where those transactions are potentially governed by both U.S. and foreign antitrust laws. 
United States  antitrust laws are, of course, applicable to foreign firms doing business here. 
The Sherman,  Clayton, and FTC acts, among others, are all potentially applicable to Amer-
ican business abroad. 
 Sherman Act 
 The Sherman Act applies to the conduct of American business abroad when that business has a 
direct effect on American commerce. That the business was conducted entirely abroad or that 
the agreement was entered into another nation does not excuse an  American firm from the 
reach of the Sherman Act (assuming American courts can achieve the necessary jurisdiction).  
 Clayton Act 
 Section 7 of the Clayton Act is clearly applicable to acquisitions combining domestic and 
foreign firms and is potentially applicable to acquisitions not involving American firms if 
the effect would harm competition in the American market.  
 Federal Trade Commission Act 
 As noted earlier, the FTC shares antitrust enforcement authority with the Justice 
 Department, and Section 5 of the act strengthens Clayton 7. 
 Extraterritoriality 
 Since 1992, the U.S. Justice Department has claimed national authority to apply American an-
titrust law abroad. The general idea is to sue foreign firms that violate U.S. antitrust laws even 
when the anticompetitive actions take place entirely overseas (extraterritorial application). In 
practice, the Justice Department files suit in U.S. courts against foreign companies operating in 
the United States if those foreign companies are taking  action abroad that (1) harms competi-
tion in the United States or (2) limits American access to markets in other nations. Those law-
suits are permissible under U.S. law only where the conduct abroad has a “direct, substantial, 
and reasonably foreseeable” effect on the United States’ domestic market. Extraterritoriality 
does not mean, however, that the United States will become the world’s antitrust police depart-
ment. Indeed, the European Union and China likewise have claimed extraterritorial antitrust 
power.  [For a brief assessment of China’s Anti-Monopoly law, see  www.insidecounsel.com/
Exclusive/2010/6/Pages/ Chinas-AntiMonopoly-LawCause-for-Hope-and-Concern.aspx ]  
 International Antitrust Enforcement 
 Markets increasingly extend around the globe, thus encouraging international antitrust en-
forcement. Most antitrust enforcement occurs in the United States and the European  Union, 
but other nations are  taking a more aggressive stance, usually by employing laws that 
largely mimic those of the United States or the European Union.  

Chapter Eleven  Antitrust Law—Monopolies and Mergers  495
European Union Antitrust Enforcement In general, American and European Union an-
titrust policies are compatible and are the product of constant consultation. Nonetheless, 
EU regulators have demonstrated that they are willing to part ways with America if market 
conditions require. We have seen in this chapter that the European Union arguably has 
taken a more aggressive stance toward Microsoft’s alleged  anticompetitive behaviors than 
has been the case in the United States. Certainly the EU regulators are not timid about 
blocking American business activities in Europe. UPS, for example, announced in 2013 
that it would drop its bid to acquire competing Dutch delivery company TNT Express 
when it became clear that the European Commission would raise antitrust concerns. Given 
the European Union’s powerful economic role, the antitrust decisions of EU regulators 
necessarily influence business practices worldwide. [For access to EU antitrust law, see 
http://ec.europa.eu/competiton/index_en.html] 
 Other Nations The number of nations with competition laws soared from 40 in 1995 to more 
than 125 in 2009,  33   and we are seeing the beginning of a worldwide convergence of those laws 
led by the United States, the European Union, and China. 34 Indeed, in 2012, the European Un-
ion and China signed a memorandum of understanding affirming antitrust cooperation, much as 
the United States and China had done in 2011.35 Despite borrowing extensively from the United 
States and the European Union, China has shown a willingness to chart its own antitrust course 
when deemed necessary, as was the case in its 2012 approval of Google’s $12.5 billion acquisi-
tion of Motorola Mobility Holdings. Although the United States and the European Union ap-
proved the deal without conditions, China imposed a number of expectations on Google, 
including, for example, a requirement that Google continue to license Android on a free and 
open basis.36 Reflecting the broadened importance of antitrust in our complex global markets, 
regulators in 2012 began to assert themselves more aggressively in India where Apple and 
Google reportedly are both under investigation and where a wide range of industries, including 
cement and tire manufacturing, are being scrutinized for alleged price fixing.37 [For periodic 
overviews of global antitrust policies and practices, see Antitrust Review produced and pub-
lished by the British law firm, Clifford Chance (www.cliffordchance.com/)].

   1.   The Chicago Skyway, a toll bridge connecting Chicago and Indiana, was owned and op-
erated by the City of Chicago. Chicago earned $52 million in tolls beyond the amount 
needed to meet bond payments and to maintain the Skyway. The excess was used to pay 
for other transportation expenses. Skyway tolls were higher than those of other area high-
ways. Endsley, a bridge user, joined others in a class action against Chicago claiming that 
the city’s control of the Skyway provided monopoly power in high-speed limited access

travel between Indiana and Chicago and that the city was abusing that power by collecting 
excessive fees. Chicago demonstrated that at least two alternative, if less desirable, routes 
were in competition with the Skyway. Is  Chicago a monopolist? Explain. See  Endsley v. 
City of Chicago , 230 F.3d 276 (7th Cir. 2000); cert. den. 532 U.S. 972 (2001).  
  2. Major League Soccer (MLS) was the exclusive Division I professional soccer league 
in the United States, as recognized by the U.S. Soccer Federation (USSF), the national 
soccer governing body. MLS owned all of the league’s 12 teams, set all schedules, 
negotiated all stadium leases, controlled all intellectual property rights, and controlled 
all player contracts. Partial control over some teams was transferred by MLS to certain 
investors. The investors did not hire their own players. Each employment contract was 
between the player and the league. MLS assigned the players in a manner designed to 
maintain competitive balance. MLS had been preceded in U.S. professional soccer by 
the North American Soccer League, which had failed financially. A group of players 
sued the MLS on antitrust grounds.  
 a. What were the players’ antitrust claims? 
 b.   Decide those claims. Explain. See  Fraser v. Major League Soccer , 284 F.3d 47 
(1st Cir. 2002). 
   3. Poplar Bluff is a city of 17,000 people in southeastern Missouri. Sikeston and Cape 
Girardeau, Missouri, both towns with populations of over 40,000, are 40 and 60 miles 
away from Poplar Bluff. Tenet Healthcare owns Lucy Lee Hospital in Poplar Bluff 
and proposed to buy Doctors’ Regional Medical Center, also in Poplar Bluff. Both 
hospitals are profitable, but both are underutilized and have had trouble attracting spe-
cialists. The Federal Trade Commission filed suit to block the acquisition. The key 
question involved definition of the geographic market. The FTC proposed a relevant 
geographic market that essentially matched the service area: a 50-mile radius of down-
town Poplar Bluff. Ninety percent of the two hospitals’ patients come from that area. 
Four other hospitals are in that area. The merged hospital would have 84 percent of the 
patients in that geographic market. Tenet argues that the geographic market should 
encompass a 65-mile radius from downtown Poplar Bluff. That area includes 16 hos-
pitals. How should the Court of Appeals decide where the geographic market lies? See 
 FTC v. Tenet Health Care Corp., 186 F.3d 1045 (8th Cir. 1999). 
  4. In 2011, the U.S. Justice Department sent a letter to the National Collegiate Athletic 
 Association raising antitrust questions about the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) 
which is used to determine a national college football champion. The letter asked why 
the BCS schools had not established a playoff system. Then pressure from critics and 
the promise of huge payouts pushed the BCS to establish a four-team playoff system 
to commence in 2014. In your judgment, should federal antitrust law be applied to the 
Bowl Championship Series? Explain.  
   5.   A major concern with horizontal mergers is the increased potential for collusion. List the 
structural conditions that would encourage coordinated interaction between competitors. 
  6. Critics are concerned that increasing mergers, especially those involving media firms, 
threaten democracy. 
 a. Explain that argument. 
 b. Do you agree? Explain.

  7. In 1986 distinguished economist William Shepherd argued, 
 It may not be too late to turn back from this road to serfdom by reviving the case for 
antitrust, but the odds aren’t favorable. More probably, antitrust will continue to sink. 38  
 a. What did Shepherd mean about “this road to serfdom?” 
 b. In reading this chapter, do you think antitrust has been revived? Explain. 
 c. Is bigness bad, or is it necessary in today’s global economy? Explain. 
  8. Whole Foods, the natural foods chain, in 2007 acquired its chief competitor, Wild Oats 
Market. Whole Foods had about 12 percent of the natural foods market, and Wild Oats 
held about 3 percent. Whole Foods had 197 stores and added 110 by purchasing Wild 
Oats. About 72 percent of Wild Oats’ sales were in markets where the two overlapped. 
Whole Foods argued that the merger was necessary to allow it to compete effectively 
with big chains such as Safeway and Walmart.  
 
  
Prior to the purchase, Whole Foods cofounder and CEO John Mackey allegedly 
said that the proposed merger would end “forever or almos t forever” the possibility of 
a big grocery chain buying an existing natural foods chain to compete with Whole 
Foods. Mackey also allegedly said that buying Wild Oats would prevent “nasty price 
wars.”
 
  
The Federal Trade Commission challenged the Whole Foods purchase of Wild 
Oats.
 a. What was the primary issue facing the federal courts that reviewed the FTC chal-
lenge? 
 b.   Decide the case. Explain. See Federal Trade Commission v. Whole Foods Market, 
502 F. Supp.2d 1 (2007), Federal Trade Commission v. Whole Foods Market, 533 
F.3d 869 (D.C. Cir. 2008), and David Kesmodel and Jonathan Eig, “A Grocer’s Brash 
Style Takes Unhealthy Turn,” The Wall Street Journal, July 20, 2007, p. A1.  
 9. Is the influence of big business so persuasive that it nullifies the effective enforcement 
of the antitrust laws? Explain.  
  10.   Antitrust authorities must address a critical and empirically difficult policy problem: 
Does seller concentration in a market ordinarily result in increased prices? That is, in a 
particular market, are fewer firms with larger shares likely to produce higher prices 
than would be the case with a more fragmented market? Free-market theorists are gen-
erally untroubled by concentration. What do you think? Explain.  
 11. Is a monopolist required to deal with its competitors? That question was the core of a 
2004 Supreme Court decision in  Verizon Communications v. Law Offices of Curtis V. 
Trinko . 39   The Trinko law firm bought its local phone service from AT&T. Trinko 
brought a class action claiming Verizon maintained a monopoly by exclusionary 
 practices. Trinko contended that local phone services had difficulty connecting with 
the giant regional Bell operating companies’ (Verizon, Qwest, BellSouth, and SBC) 
local exchange facilities, thus harming competition and consumers. The Telecommu-
nications Act of 1996 specifically requires the regional Bell companies to provide the 
local phone services with fair, reasonable access. The Supreme Court, however, ruled 
in favor of Verizon and concluded that antitrust liability in these telephone situations 
would apply only where a telephone monopolist discontinues a voluntary business 

498  Unit Three  Trade Regulation and Antitrust
 relationship with a competitor for the purpose of destroying that competitor. Explain 
why the Supreme Court decided that Verizon, a telephone monopolist, had no duty to 
deal with those  telephone competitors with whom it had not previously dealt. See 
 Matthew Cantor, “Is Trinko the Last Word on a Telephone Monopolist’s Duty to 
Deal?”   New York Law  Journal 96 (May 19, 2004), p. 4. 
 12. In the period 1917 to 1919, DuPont acquired 23 percent of the stock in the then-fledgling 
General Motors Corporation. By 1947, DuPont supplied 68 percent of GM’s automo-
tive finish needs and 38 percent of its fabric needs. In 1955, General Motors ranked 
first in sales and second in assets among all U.S. industrial corporations, while ac-
counting for approximately two-fifths of the nation’s annual automobile sales. In 1949, 
the Justice Department challenged Dupont’s 1917–19 acquisitions of GM stock.  
 a. Why did the government challenge DuPont’s acquisition? 
 b. May an acquisition be properly challenged 30 years after the fact, as in DuPont? 
Explain. 
 c.   Given your general understanding of finishes and fabrics, how would you defend 
DuPont?  
 d. Decide. Explain. See  United States v. E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. , 353 U.S. 
586 (1957).  
 13. How can a merger benefit society? 
 14. Which economic considerations support the view that unilateral growth is preferable 
to growth by merger? 
 15. Excel, a division of Cargill, was the second-largest firm in the beef-packing market. It 
sought to acquire Spencer Pack, a division of Land-O-Lakes and the third-largest beef 
packer. After the acquisition, Excel would have remained second ranked in the 
 business, but its market share would have been only slightly smaller than that of the 
leader, IBP. Monfort, the nation’s fifth-largest beef packer, sought an injunction to 
block the acquisition, claiming a violation of Clayton Section 7. In effect, Monfort 
claimed the merger would result in a dangerous concentration of economic power in 
the beef-packing market, with the result that Excel would pay more for cattle and 
charge less for its processed beef, thus placing its competitors in a destructive and 
 illegal price–cost squeeze. Monfort claimed Excel’s initial losses in this arrangement 
would be covered by its wealthy parent, Cargill. Then, when the competition was 
driven from the market, Monfort claimed, Excel would raise its processed beef prices 
to supracompetitive levels. Among other defenses, Excel averred that the heavy losses 
Monfort claimed were merely the product of intense competition, a condition that 
would not constitute a violation of the antitrust laws. The district court found for 
 Monfort, and the appeals court, considering the cost–price squeeze a form of predatory 
pricing, affirmed. Excel appealed to the Supreme Court. Decide. Explain. See  Cargill, 
Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc. , 479 U.S. 104 (1986).

Introduction
Scott Rodrigues was fired in 2006 by The Scotts Company, the lawn care giant, because a 
required drug test revealed nicotine in his urine. Company policy forbade employee smok-
ing both on and off the job. Scotts announced in 2005 that it would no longer hire smokers, 
and it gave its employees one year to comply with the new policy, a policy designed to 
improve employee wellness and reduce company health care costs. Rodrigues was a pack-
a-day smoker when he was hired. He was aware of the no-smoking policy, and he had been 

Chapter Twelve  Employment Law I: Employee Rights  503
warned to quit when a supervisor saw a pack of cigarettes on the dashboard of his car. 
Rodrigues acknowledged his smoking habit, but said he was trying to quit smoking 
when he was fired. Rodrigues complained that the company had not offered to help him 
quit smoking. The Scotts’ plan does, however, pay for smoking cessation programs for 
its employees. Scotts said they were not interested in influencing workers’ behavior in 
their free time, except in the case of smoking.1 Rodrigues decided to file suit against 
Scotts because:
What’s to make them stop at just cigarettes? If they’re a Republican company, can they try 
and figure out who you vote for and if you vote for the Democrats, they’ll fire you? . . .2
According to the American Lung Association’s Tobacco Policy Project/State Legislated 
Actions on Tobacco Issues (SLATI), as of 2013, 29 states and the District of Columbia 
have laws protecting smokers from adverse employment action based on smoking  tobacco.3 
While Massachusetts law does not provide explicit shelter for smokers, it offers statutory 
protection from “unreasonable, substantial, or serious interference” with an individual’s 
privacy.4 Rodrigues brought suit against the Scotts Company claiming, among other 
things,  invasion of privacy.
Questions
1. How would you rule on Rodrigues’s right to privacy claim?
2. Should employers be able to fire employees who smoke off the job? Explain. See 
 Rodrigues v. the Scotts Company, 639 F.Supp.2d 131 (D. Mass 2009).
Managing Lawsuits Managers traditionally have balanced multiple responsibilities, but 
in recent years the law has added complex, sometimes daunting expectations. Addressing 
and mitigating the risk of employment-related lawsuits, like Rodrigues’s, has become an 
important consideration in management decision making. As union strength has declined 
(see Chapter 14), government regulations and court decisions have arguably broadened 
employee rights. These increased legal protections, a volatile economy, downsizing, weak-
ened employer–employee loyalty, and other forces have contributed to higher levels of 
employee litigation.5
Part One—The Employment Relationship
Job Classification Employment-related legal rights and responsibilities depend on the 
type of relationship the employer decides to build with the worker. The traditional, stable 
model of long-term direct employer–employee relationships now is often replaced with 
new, flexible, nontraditional staffing arrangements including outsourcing and employee 
leasing, along with the use of freelancers and temporary agencies. These contingent 
 workers, along with independent contractors, who are increasingly relied on to perform 
specific, shorter-term, nonrecurring jobs, permit employers to rapidly and inexpensively 
inflate or shrink their workforces as competitive and regulatory conditions change. 
 Employers who choose to provide health and retirement benefits for their traditional 

504  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 employees need not do so for their contingent workers. Nor must they withhold income, 
Social Security, Medicare, and unemployment taxes. With fringe benefit costs skyrocket-
ing, benefits reduction has become an important consideration for most firms. A firm 
might contract with professional employer organizations (PEOs) to take responsibility for 
and administer its payroll and human resources operation. [For an overview of PEOs and 
their functions, see www.napeo.org/]
Employee or Independent Contractor? A key question underlying the legal issues 
 discussed in this chapter is whether the worker in question is an employee or an 
 independent contractor: one who enters a contractual rather than employment relation-
ship with an  organization in order to perform a specific task. Degree of control is the 
dominant test in determining whether a worker is an employee or independent contrac-
tor. Where an  employer controls or has the right or ability to control the worker’s perfor-
mance, the worker is likely to be considered an employee. CBS used the distinction 
between “independent contractor” and “employee” to successfully appeal the FCC’s fine 
after Justin Timberlake and Janet Jackson appeared to cooperatively expose 
Ms.  Jackson’s breast at the end of their performance during the 2004 Super Bowl half-
time show that CBS broadcast. CBS argued that the performers were independent con-
tractors, not employees, and, therefore, CBS could not be held liable for actions taken 
outside their control.6 In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the federal 
appellate court’s decision to throw out the FCC’s fine.7
 
What other advantages might a business gain from hiring an independent contractor 
rather than an employee? A business that hires an independent contractor generally is not 
required to comply with a wide range of employment and labor law standards that would 
apply were the worker an employee. Thus a business must provide, for example, unem-
ployment insurance to its employees, but generally would not need to do so for independent 
contractors. Furthermore, employers generally are not liable for employment discrimination 
claims by independent contractors or for most torts committed by independent contractors 
in the course of work. While employers are responsible for payroll taxes such as FICA and 
federal and state unemployment insurance, as well as for withholding income tax from 
their employees, these tax obligations of a business do not extend to its independent 
 contractors. [For a sample of independent contractor agreement from the Society of  Human 
Resource Management, see www.shrm.org/TemplatesTools/Samples/HRForms
/Articles/Pages/1CMS_006447.aspx]
Classification Problems Employers anxious to reduce financial and legal burdens some-
times improperly classify workers as independent contractors rather than employees. In 
2007, a California federal district court ordered a house cleaning service to pay  $4.5 million 
to provide minimum wages and overtime pay for workers who had been misclassified as 
independent contractors. Employees, unlike independent contractors, are protected by the 
Fair Labor Standards Act (detailed later in this chapter), which requires, among other 
things, the payment of the federal minimum wage and overtime pay. The employer claimed 
that the workers were independent contractors and thus not covered by the FLSA, but the 
court pointed to a variety of considerations, including control and supervision, that 
 confirmed the workers’ correct status as employees.8 The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 

Chapter Twelve  Employment Law I: Employee Rights  505
has created a Voluntary Classification Settlement Program under which employers who 
meet certain criteria are able to reclassify workers as employees for employment tax pur-
poses with partial relief from federal employment taxes.9 [For IRS  guidance on determin-
ing whether a worker is an employee or independent contractor, see www.irs.gov
/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Independent-Contractor-Self
-Employed-or-Employee]
Selection and Hiring  An array of potential legal problems have arisen from the increas-
ingly complex process of choosing and employing new workers.
• Résumé Fraud. Scott Thompson, former Yahoo CEO, left the company after revela-
tions that he had falsely claimed to hold a computer science degree; he graduated with 
an accounting degree from a college that apparently did not have a computer science 
program at the time.10 Along with Thompson, David J. Edmonson, former chief execu-
tive of Radio Shack, also left his post after his exaggerated academic credentials were 
discovered.11 Misstated qualifications of corporate executives at Herbalife Ltd. and Us-
ana Health Sciences have also been uncovered. A 2008 online poll of 3,000 hiring 
managers revealed that 49 percent had uncovered a lie on a résumé, including exag-
geration of job responsibilities and skills, false claims regarding education, and inflated 
job titles. One of the more unusual lies involved an applicant who pretended to be re-
lated to the Kennedy clan.12
• Background Checks. Although concerns ranging from résumé fraud to employee 
theft and workplace violence may have led to background checks becoming an ex-
pected part of the hiring process, a 2012 survey conducted by the Society for Human 
Resource Management (SHRM) showed a decrease in the number of employers who 
check applicants’ credit history and criminal backgrounds compared to 2010. Less 
than half of employers run credit checks on applicants for at least some positions, 
compared to 60 percent in 2010, while the percentage of employers not checking 
criminal backgrounds doubled from 7 percent to 14 percent.13 Using credit checks in 
hiring arguably helps protect an employer against fraud and employee theft, since 
applicants who have not handled their personal  finances responsibly might be more 
likely to engage in such misconduct. However, questions about the validity and unin-
tended impact of this practice have been raised in recent years. Not only has the con-
nection between a bad credit report and poor job performance been disputed, but 
studies showing that African Americans and Latinos tend to have lower credit scores 
cause concern that credit checks can create a  discriminatory impact on these groups’ 
ability to gain employment.14 Several states have passed legislation limiting the use 
of credit checks. The Illinois  Employee Credit Privacy Act, for example,  generally 
prohibits employers from using an employee’s or applicant’s credit history in making 
employment decisions such as hiring.15
 
 
In 2012, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued an 
enforcement guidance on the use of criminal background checks. Although employers’ 
use of criminal background checks is not banned, employers cannot use this tool to 
screen applicants or current employees unless the conviction is relevant to the position 
for which they are being considered. The EEOC noted that an arrest does not establish 

506  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
criminal conduct and therefore cannot be used in hiring; however, the conduct underly-
ing the arrest could be considered by an employer in making an employment decision. 
[For the full text of the EEOC Enforcement Guidance on the Consid-
eration of Arrest and Conviction Records in Employment Decisions, 
see www.eeoc.gov/laws/guidance/arrest_conviction.cfm]
 
At the same time, employers are increasingly searching the online 
reputation of job  applicants. In a 2012 survey, 37 percent of hiring 
managers polled revealed that they browse applicants’ social media 
profiles; approximately two-thirds of employers using social media in 
the hiring process want to see whether candidates present themselves professionally.16 As 
discussed further in this chapter, concern for privacy over this practice has led to state leg-
islation preventing employers from requiring social media passwords as part of the applica-
tion process.
• Inappropriate Questions. According to a recent survey, 22 percent of job seekers cited 
interviewers “asking inappropriate questions” as a “top turn-off” in the interview 
 process.17 Furthermore, such questions as “How old are you?” and “Are you married?” 
also expose employers to potential liability for discrimination (see Chapter 13). But 
what about the enormous array of awkward, intrusive, but nondiscriminatory interview 
questions that might leave the candidate feeling uncomfortable if not wronged? For 
example: “What would you do if I gave you an elephant?” has questionable relevance 
in a job interview.18
• Restrictive Covenants. Chris Botticella, a former executive with Bimbo Bakeries, 
which operates under popular brand names such as Thomas’ and Entenmann’s, was 
 unable to start work for Hostess, Inc. because of the confidentiality agreement and other 
restrictive covenants he had signed with Bimbo. Information such as recipes and 
 business strategies to which Botticella had access would likely be shared with  Hostess.19 
To address problems like these, employers sometimes require employees to sign agree-
ments providing they will not compete with their employer, solicit its customers or 
employees, pass trade secrets to others, and so on, for a specified period of time. Such 
agreements are not limited to upper management,20 and generally are fully enforceable 
if reasonable in their requirements. California law, however, prohibits noncompetition 
agreements in employment, with narrow statutory exceptions.21 Even if such an agree-
ment is enforceable, employers who take such actions as hiring a private investigator to 
determine whether a former employee is in breach could face liability for intrusion 
(see Chapter 7).22
• Arbitration. New employees are often expected to sign agreements specifying that 
disputes with the employer will be settled by arbitration (see Chapter 4) rather than 
by litigation. A recent study of 21 major corporations’ employment contracts found 
that 93 percent contained mandatory arbitration clauses.23 Employers like arbitration 
because it can be cheaper, faster, and less adversarial than a trial. Employees, on the 
other hand, argue that arbitration is stacked in favor of corporate interests and 
amounts to a denial of the fundamental right of access to the legal system. Employ-
ment arbitration agreements have been supported by recent U.S. Supreme Court deci-
sions, such as Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams upholding the enforceability of 
Employers using social 
 media in the hiring process 
want to see whether 
 candidates present 
 themselves professionally.

Chapter Twelve  Employment Law I: Employee Rights  507
legitimate, equitable employment arbitration agreement.24 In Nitro-Lift Technologies 
v. Howard, the Court vacated a state supreme court ruling that the arbitration clause 
in a restrictive covenant not to sue in court was void under state policy limiting the 
enforceability of noncompetition agreements in employment; the U.S Supreme 
Court held that whether the restrictive covenant was enforceable was for the arbitra-
tor to decide.25 However, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission 
(see Chapter 13) still retains authority to file discrimination lawsuits on behalf of 
employees despite an arbitration agreement.26
•
 References. As a manager, you decide to fire an employee, 
Brown, because of what you believe to be convincing evidence 
that he had sexually harassed a coworker. Brown  applies for a 
new job, and that employer seeks your evaluation of Brown’s work.
 
What should you do? If you tell what you know, you and your employer fear Brown 
might sue you for defamation  (slander when  spoken; libel when written). If you fail to 
say what you know, you fear you might be sued for misrepresentation or negligent re-
ferral if Brown is hired and commits further harassment on his new job. Because of 
those risks, employers often limit their  references to purely factual details such as the 
date of hire, date of departure, and job title.
 
Broadly, a successful defamation suit requires the following conditions:
1. A false statement.
2. The statement must be “published” to a third party.
3. The employer must be responsible for the publication.
4. The plaintiff’s reputation must be harmed.
Truth is a complete defense in defamation cases, and managers who offer factual, honest 
professional judgments are unlikely to face such claims. Further, many state courts provide 
the protection of a qualified privilege. Under this privilege, legitimate business communi-
cations, with some exceptions, are shielded from liability. Similarly, a number of states 
have enacted legislation providing employers with immunity from liability for good faith 
employment references.
Part Two—Liability
Once hired, what happens when employees make mistakes or engage in misconduct on the 
job that hurts others? Must the employer bear the loss in these situations? Job classification 
is an important first question in determining company liability for workers’ job-related 
injuries, harm to others, and crimes. An enterprise ordinarily will not be liable for the acts 
of its independent contractors. Employers, on the other hand, often bear legal  responsibility 
for employees’  accidents or wrongs. That liability may spring from the doctrine of 
 respondeat superior (let the master answer), a form of vicarious liability (sometimes called 
imputed liability).
You decide to fire 
an employee.

508  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
Scope of Employment Employer liability for employee injuries, accidents, or wrongs is 
largely dependent on whether the employee was on the job at the time of the incident in 
question. Employers will be held liable under respondeat superior/vicarious liability 
 reasoning for harm to third parties caused by the intentional or negligent acts of their 
 employees when those acts occur within the scope of employment (on the job). A finding 
of employer liability, of course, does not excuse the employee from her personal liability, 
but the respondeat superior reasoning does have the potential effect of opening the 
 employer’s deeper pockets to the plaintiff. The following questions ordinarily determine 
whether the harm occurred in the scope of employment:
1. Was the employee subject to the employer’s supervision?
2. Was the employee motivated, at least in part, by a desire to serve the employer’s 
 business interests?
3. Did the problem arise substantially within normal working hours and in a work location?
4. Was the act in question of the general kind the employee had been hired to perform?
In Mary M. v. City of Los Angeles,27 the city was held liable 
under the doctrine of  respondeat superior for a sexual assault 
committed by a police officer. At 2:30 am on  October 3, 1981, 
Sergeant Leigh Schroyer was on duty, in  uniform, carrying a 
gun, and patrolling in his marked police car. He stopped Mary 
M. for erratic driving. She pleaded not to be  arrested. He  ordered her to enter his patrol 
car and took her to her home. He  entered her home and said that he expected  “payment” 
for not  arresting her. He raped her and was subsequently sentenced to a term in state 
prison.
 
Mary M. sued the City of Los Angeles. The general inquiry was whether Schroyer was 
acting within the scope of his employment during the rape episode. The jury found for 
Mary M. and awarded $150,000 in damages. The Court of Appeals reversed, saying that 
Schroyer was not acting within the scope of his employment. The case went to the 
 California Supreme Court. The city argued that Schroyer was acting on behalf of his own 
interests rather than those of the city, and that the city had not authorized his conduct. 
Therefore, Schroyer could not have been acting within the scope of employment.  However, 
the court said that the correct question was not whether the rape was authorized but 
whether it happened in the course of a series of acts that were authorized. The court 
 reversed, saying that a jury could find the city vicariously liable (imputed to the principal 
from the agent) given the unique authority of police officers in our society.

Massachusetts, left work and went to the South Pacific Chinese Restaurant where he 
met his supervisor, Pacitti, to socialize and discuss work-related matters. Ahern pur-
chased two drinks and consumed at least one drink and one-half of the other before 
leaving to go home. On his way home, Ahern’s vehicle struck Lev as he was crossing a 
street, causing severe and debilitating injuries. Ahern was arrested and eventually con-
victed of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Lev 
sued Heathwood’s owner and operator, Beverly Enterprises, alleging that Beverly was 
 vicariously liable for Ahern’s negligence based on their employment relationship.

wrongs of an employee operating within the scope of employment?
A Side Order of Pistol-Whipping?
Harris placed his order with a cashier at a Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) restaurant in 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, but hesitated in selecting his side orders that were part of the 
meal he had selected. Another KFC employee, Henry, told Harris to “hurry up.” Harris 
replied, “I am not dealing with you.” Henry then asked Harris: “Do you want the [exple-
tive] chicken or not?” Taken aback, Harris further hesitated; Henry pulled out a gun. Harris 
put up his hands and asked if Henry was “going to shoot [him] over a bucket of chicken?” 
While another employee yelled at Henry, Harris tried to escape, but Henry followed and 
pistol-whipped Harris before he could leave the restaurant, causing him injuries. Harris 
sued KFC for negligently failing to conduct a criminal background check. In rejecting the 
claim, the federal district court noted that KFC was not legally required to conduct a crim-
inal background check, and that Henry’s criminal history only would have revealed two 
prior convictions for nonviolent crimes over 5 years old. 
Questions
1. Do you agree with the court’s ruling? Explain.
2. How else might KFC have prevented this situation? Explain. See Harris v. KFC, 2012

Hiring/Retention/Training/Supervision
Negligence
In addition to vicarious liability for employees’ actions, employers may be directly liable 
for negligence in hiring an employee or retaining an employee who subsequently causes 
harm to a third party, or for careless training or supervision. Typically, the employer is 
 liable on negligence grounds for hiring or retaining an employee whom the employer knew 

510  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
Yunker v. Honeywell, Inc.
496 N.W.2d 419 (Minn.App. 1993)
ISSUE
Did Honeywell have a duty to Kathleen Nesser to exercise rea-
sonable care in hiring, retaining, or supervising Randy Landin?
ANALYSIS
In determining that Honeywell did not have a legal duty to 
Kathleen Nesser arising from its employment of Randy Landin, 
the district court analyzed Honeywell’s duty as limited by its 
ability to control and protect its employees while they are in-
volved in the employer’s business or at the employer’s place of 
business. Additionally, the court concluded that Honeywell 
could not have reasonably foreseen Landin’s killing Nesser.
 
Incorporating a “scope of employment” limitation into an 
employer’s duty borrows from the doctrine of respondeat su-
perior. However, of the three theories advanced for recovery, 
only negligent supervision derives from the respondeat supe-
rior doctrine, which relies on connection to the employer’s 
premises or chattels. We agree that negligent supervision is 
not a viable theory of recovery because Landin was neither on 
Honeywell’s premises nor using Honeywell’s chattels when he 
shot Nesser.
 
The remaining theories, negligent hiring and negligent re-
tention, are based on direct, not vicarious, liability. Negligent 
hiring and negligent retention do not rely on the scope of em-
ployment but address risks created by exposing members of 
the public to a potentially dangerous individual. These theories 
of recovery impose liability for an employee’s intentional tort, 
an action almost invariably outside the scope of employment, 
when the employer knew or should have known that the em-
ployee was violent or aggressive and might engage in injuri-
ous conduct.

FACTS
Honeywell employed Randy Landin from 1977 to 1979 and from 
1984 to 1988. From 1979 to 1984 Landin was imprisoned for the 
strangulation death of Nancy Miller, a Honeywell coemployee. 
On his release from prison, Landin reapplied at Honeywell. 
Honeywell rehired Landin as a custodian in Honeywell’s 
 General Offices facility in South Minneapolis in August 1984. 
Because of workplace confrontations Landin was twice 
transferred, first to the Golden Valley facility in August 1986, 
and then to the St. Louis Park facility in August 1987.
 
Kathleen Nesser was assigned to Landin’s maintenance 
crew in April 1988. Landin and Nesser became friends and 
spent time together away from work. When Landin expressed 
a romantic interest, Nesser stopped spending time with 
 Landin. Landin began to harass and threaten Nesser both at 
work and at home. At the end of June, Landin’s behavior 
prompted Nesser to seek help from her supervisor and to 
 request a transfer out of the St. Louis Park facility.
 
On July 1, 1988, Nesser found a death threat scratched on 
her locker door. Landin did not come to work on or after July 1, 
and Honeywell accepted his formal resignation on July 11, 
1988. On July 19, approximately six hours after her Honeywell 
shift ended, Landin killed Nesser in her driveway with a close-
range shotgun blast. Landin was convicted of first-degree 
murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.
 
Jean Yunker, as trustee for the heirs and next-of-kin of 
Kathleen Nesser, brought this wrongful death action based on 
theories of negligent hiring, retention, and supervision of a 
dangerous employee. Honeywell moved for summary judg-
ment and, for purposes of the motion, stipulated that it failed to 
exercise reasonable care in the hiring and supervision of 
 Landin. The trial court concluded that Honeywell owed no legal 
duty to Nesser and granted summary judgment for Honeywell.

or should have known to be dangerous, incompetent, dishonest, or the like where that 
 information was directly related to the injury suffered by the plaintiff. Note that under 
negligence liability an employer may be liable for acts outside the scope of employment. 
The case that follows examines the law of negligent hiring, supervision, and retention.

Chapter Twelve  Employment Law I: Employee Rights  511
employment of an apartment manager who sexually assaulted 
a tenant. The Supreme Court upheld a jury verdict finding the 
apartment operators negligent in failing to make a reasonable 
investigation into the resident manager’s background before 
providing him with a passkey. The court defined negligent 
 hiring as
predicated on the negligence of an employer in placing a 
person with known propensities, or propensities which 
should have been discovered by reasonable investigation, 
in an employment position in which, because of the 
circumstances of the employment, it should have been 
foreseeable that the hired individual posed a threat of injury 
to others.
 
Honeywell argues that under Ponticas it is not liable for 
negligent hiring because, unlike providing a dangerous resident 
manager with a passkey, Landin’s employment did not enable 
him to commit the act of violence against Nesser. This argument 
has merit, and we note that a number of jurisdictions have 
 expressly defined the scope of an employer’s duty of reasonable 
care in hiring as largely dependent on the type of responsibilities 
associated with the particular job. See Connes, 831 P.2d at 1321 
(employer’s duty in hiring is dependent on anticipated degree 
of contact between employee and other persons in performing 
employment duties).
 
Ponticas rejected the view that employers are required to 
investigate a prospective employee’s criminal background in 
every job in which the individual has regular contact with the 
public. Instead, liability is determined by the totality of the 
 circumstances surrounding the hiring and whether the  employer 
exercised reasonable care. The court instructed that
[t]he scope of the investigation is directly related to the 
severity of the risk third parties are subjected to by an 
incompetent employee. Although only slight care might 
suffice in the hiring of a yardman, a worker on a production 
line, or other types of employment where the employee would 
not constitute a high risk of injury to third persons, when the 
prospective employee is to be furnished a passkey permitting 
admittance to living quarters of tenants, the employer has the 
duty to use reasonable care to investigate his competency 
and reliability prior to employment.
 
Applying these principles, we conclude that Honeywell did 
not owe a duty to Nesser at the time of Landin’s hire. Landin 
was employed as a maintenance worker whose job responsi-
bilities entailed no exposure to the general public and required 
only limited contact with coemployees. Unlike the caretaker in 
Ponticas, Landin’s duties did not involve inherent dangers to 
others, and unlike the tenant in Ponticas, Nesser was not a 
reasonably foreseeable victim at the time Landin was hired.
 
To reverse the district court’s determination on duty as it 
relates to hiring would extend Ponticas and essentially hold 
that ex-felons are inherently dangerous and that any harmful 
acts they commit against persons encountered through em-
ployment will automatically be considered foreseeable. Such 
a rule would deter employers from hiring workers with a crim-
inal record and “offend our civilized concept that society must 
make a reasonable effort to rehabilitate those who have erred 
so they can be assimilated into the community.”
 
Honeywell did not breach a legal duty to Nesser by hiring 
Landin because the specific nature of his employment did not 
create a foreseeable risk of harm, and public policy supports a 
limitation on this cause of action. The district court correctly 
determined that Honeywell is not liable to Nesser under a 
theory of negligent hiring.
II
In recognizing the tort of negligent hiring, Ponticas extended 
established Minnesota case law permitting recovery under 
theories of negligent retention.
* * * * *
 
The difference between negligent hiring and negligent re-
tention focuses on when the employer was on notice that an 
employee posed a threat and failed to take steps to ensure the 
safety of third parties. The Florida appellate court has provided 
a useful definition:
Negligent hiring occurs when, prior to the time the employee 
is actually hired, the employer knew or should have known of 
the employee’s unfitness, and the issue of liability primarily 
focuses upon the adequacy of the employer’s pre-employment 
investigation into the employee’s background. Negligent 
retention, on the other hand, occurs when, during the course 
of employment, the employer becomes aware or should have 
become aware of problems with an employee that indicated 
his unfitness, and the employer fails to take further action such 
as investigating, discharge, or reassignment.
 
. . . The record contains evidence of a number of episodes 
in Landin’s postimprisonment employment at Honeywell that 
demonstrate a propensity for abuse and violence toward 
 coemployees.
 
While at the Golden Valley facility, Landin sexually har-
assed female employees and challenged a male coworker to 
fight. After his transfer to St. Louis Park, Landin threatened to 
kill a coworker during an angry confrontation following a minor 
car accident. In another employment incident, Landin was hos-
tile and abusive toward a female coworker after problems de-
veloped in their friendship. Landin’s specific focus on Nesser 
was demonstrated by several workplace outbursts  occurring 

512  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
512  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
at the end of June, and on July 1 the words “one more day and 
you’re dead” were scratched on her locker door.
 
Landin’s troubled work history and the escalation of abu-
sive behavior during the summer of 1988 relate directly to the 
foreseeability prong of duty. The facts . . . show that it was 
foreseeable that Landin could act violently against a coem-
ployee and against Nesser in particular.
 
This foreseeability gives rise to a duty of care to Nesser that 
is not outweighed by policy considerations of employment op-
portunity. An ex-felon’s “opportunity for gainful  employment 
may spell the difference between recidivism and rehabilitation,” 
but it cannot predominate over the need to maintain a safe 
workplace when specific actions point to future violence.
 
Our holding is narrow and limited only to the recognition of 
a legal duty owed to Nesser arising out of Honeywell’s contin-
ued employment of Landin. It is important to emphasize that in 
reversing the summary judgment on negligent retention, we do 
not reach the remaining significant questions of whether 
 Honeywell breached that duty by failing to terminate or discipline 
Landin, or whether such a breach was a proximate cause of 
Nesser’s death. These are issues generally decided by a jury 
after a full presentation of facts . . .
DECISION
We affirm the entry of summary judgment on the theories of 
negligent hiring and supervision, but reverse the summary 
judgment on the issue of negligent retention.

5. Gary Weimerskirch, assistant manager at Main Lanes 
Bowling Alley, walked in on David Coakley, a mechanic at 
the bowling alley, and Coakley’s girlfriend as they were 
getting dressed, apparently having just engaged in sexual 
relations. Coakley then told Weimerskirch that he quit 
and he began to collect his belongings from the work 
area. Suddenly, Coakley then grabbed a two-by-four 
plank, ran toward Weimerskirch, and struck him on the 
head with it. Coakley’s criminal record included drug and 
alcohol-related offenses, along with one misdemeanor 
assault. However, his employer did not have any knowl-
edge of this criminal record. Furthermore, Coakley had 
not acted violently at work previously.

Part Three—Fair Labor Standards Act
A note was passed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936 from a young girl:
I wish you could do something to help us girls. We have been working in a sewing factory . . . 
getting our minimum pay of $11 a week. Today, the 200 of us girls have been cut down to 
$4 and $5 and $6 a week.28
Roosevelt reportedly remarked that something needed to be done about child labor. The 
 Depression and its tragic suffering, even of those working hard, shattered many Americans’ 
faith in the free market and led to government intervention including, in 1938, the Fair Labor 
Standards Act (FLSA), which is directed toward these major objectives:
1. The establishment of a minimum wage that provides at least the foundation for a  modest 
standard of living for employees.

Chapter Twelve  Employment Law I: Employee Rights  513
2. A flexible ceiling on hours worked weekly, the purpose of which is to increase the num-
ber of employed Americans.
3. Child labor protection.
4. Equal pay for equal work regardless of gender. (See Chapter 13.)
[For the U.S. Department of Labor home page, see www.dol.gov]
Minimum Wage In 2009, the federal minimum wage was increased to $7.25 per hour. 
Critics of a federally mandated minimum wage argue that the government should not 
interfere in the marketplace, and that increases in minimum wages threaten not only job 
growth but the livelihoods of many small business owners. Supporters of minimum wage 
increases point to recent studies  concluding that raising the minimum wage does not lead 
to the loss of low-paying jobs.29 More than 130 municipalities, many where living costs 
are particularly high, have adopted their own “living wage” requirements.30 For exam-
ple, San Francisco, known for its high cost of living, at this writing has a minimum wage 
of $10.74.31 However, as a 2014 study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition 
shows, minimum-wage workers across the United States cannot afford a one- or two-
bedroom apartment at fair market rent.32 [For state minimum wage laws, see www.dol
.gov/whd/minwage/america.htm]
Overtime Most workers covered under FLSA must receive overtime pay of at least 1½ 
times their regular pay rate for hours worked over 40 hours per week. However, FLSA also 
recognizes exemptions for certain occupations, such as managers, outside salespersons, 
administrators, and professionals with advanced degrees; these workers are referred to as 
“exempt” employees. Misclassification of “nonexempt” employees who have overtime 
rights under FLSA is a common basis for wage-and-hour claims against employers, which 
have led to high-profile settlements. In 2013, Walmart vision center managers and asset-
protection coordinators who were once considered exempt but then reclassified as nonex-
empt received $4.8 million in back wages and damages.33 In 2011, Levi-Strauss was 
ordered to pay over $1 million in overtime back wages to misclassified workers, including 
employees who held the title of assistant store manager but were incorrectly treated as ex-
empt, given the actual nature of their work.34 However, the U.S. Supreme Court in 2012 
ruled in Christopher v. Smith-Kline Beecham Corp. that pharmaceutical sales representa-
tives were not entitled to overtime pay.35
 
Overtime claims often involve disputes over whether the employee was actually work-
ing, rather than being engaged in a noncompensable activity. These off-the-clock claims in 
which employers are accused of not giving employees recorded credit for all of the time 
they have worked sometimes spring from advancing technology. A 2013 poll showed that 
more than half of employed adults check work messages at least once a day over the week-
end, before or after work during the week, and even when they are home sick.36 An over-
time class action suit filed by Jeffrey Allen, a Chicago police sergeant, highlights the impact 
of technology on time spent working: he says he received a nearly constant barrage of 
 e-mails, text messages, and calls on his government-issued BlackBerry into the late evening, 
each requiring a response.37
 
In March 2014, President Obama directed the U.S. Department of Labor to address the 
changing nature of the workplace by updating overtime protections consistent with  FLSA’s

Student Interns  In a tough job market, unpaid internships become more attractive to job 
seekers and  employers alike. To address potentially abusive situations in which employers 
seek “free labor,” the U.S. Department of Labor in 2010 issued a test for unpaid internships 
to  determine whether the interns are employees with wage rights or trainees who are 
 receiving an educational opportunity for their sole benefit and are thus excluded from FLSA 
protection. Generally, the more an internship focuses on an academic or classroom experi-
ence rather than the host’s operations, the more likely it need not be a paid position. If in-
terns, on the other hand, are assisting with the employer’s daily operations such as clerical 
work, then they have a right to minimum wage and overtime. [For the six criteria of the U.S. 
Department of Labor’s test for unpaid  internships, see www.dol.gov/whd/regs/ compliance

Questions
1. Answer this person’s question: “I work as a pharmacist in a large discount retail store. 
My employer classifies me as exempt under FLSA. Like other pharmacists, I agree to 
work a specific number of base hours per week which determines my specific rate of 
pay. However, the employer has changed my base hours so frequently lately that I am 
effectively being treated as an hourly employee. There have been weeks I have worked 
more than 40 hours a week. Do I have a right to overtime?”38
2. Answer this person’s question: “Before I resigned as a sewing manager for a small 
manufacturing company, where I supervised several employees and received an hourly 
wage, I regularly arrived at the factory 15 to 45 minutes before the start of my 5:00 am 
shift, spending most of that time doing such tasks as reviewing employee schedules, 
gathering and distributing fabric to my subordinates’ workstations, cleaning work area, 
etc.—but without pay. Does my former employer owe me overtime pay?”39
Part Four—Health and Safety at Work
Gordon Jones “I am here to describe the profound impact my brother’s death, while work-
ing on a rig engaged in deepwater drilling, has had on our family,” Chris Jones told the U.S. 
House Committee on Natural Resources in March 2011. He was testifying as the surviving 
brother of Gordon Jones, one of 11 workers killed in the 2010 oil well explosion in the Gulf of 
Mexico. “[Gordon] was tragically killed aboard the Deepwater Horizon while earning his 
living as a mud engineer for MI SWACO, a contractor for BP [British 
Petroleum]. Gordon had nothing to do with this disaster. He was 
 simply doing his job and making his way through his shift so he could 
get back home to his family. Instead, he never saw his  family again. 
We can thank poor, and likely grossly negligent,  decisions by many 
people and companies for that.”40 In 2012, BP agreed to plead guilty

and pay $4.5 billion to settle criminal charges. As of this writing, individual managers face 
manslaughter charges stemming from the fatal 2010 explosion.41
Fifteen Die in 2005 Refinery Blast The 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil well explosion echoed the 
2005 disaster at the BP oil refinery in Texas City, Texas. Workers were doing their day’s work 
by restarting a unit that had been down for repair when a gasoline overflow exploded, injuring 
170 and killing 15. BP attributed the 2005 disaster primarily to operator error and six employ-
ees were fired, but government investigators concluded that management  authorized the restart 
knowing that three key pieces of equipment were not working properly:
These things do not have to happen. They are preventable. They are predictable, and people 
do not have to die because they’re earning a living.42
 
In August 2010, BP agreed to pay $50.6 million in fines for failing to fix safety hazards 
at the Texas City refinery after the 2005 explosion.43
Deaths, Illnesses, and Injuries Some workplaces are unacceptably risky, but America 
has achieved considerable progress in building safety on the job. Workplace fatalities that 
totaled 6,632 in 1995 fell to 4,383 in 2012, continuing a decreasing trend over the previous 
several years.44
 
Nonfatal injuries and illnesses have also declined from 3.9 per 100 workers in 2008 to 
3.3 in 2012.45 The overall job safety improvement should be viewed in the context of the 
U.S. labor shift away from such industries as manufacturing to service roles.
OSHA
A federal agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), is respon-
sible for ensuring safe workplaces. The 1970 Occupational Safety and Health Act imposes a 
general duty on most employers to provide a workplace free of “recognized hazards causing 
or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees.” Employers have an abso-
lute duty to remove any serious and preventable workplace hazards that are generally rec-
ognized in the industry and are known to the employer or should be known to the employer. 
That general duty is then supplemented with numerous specific standards. [For the OSHA 
home page, see www.osha.gov]
Standards
OSHA, under the U.S. Department of Labor, promulgates and enforces health and 
safety standards that identify and seek to correct specific workplace hazards and prob-
lems. These can range from exposure to cancer-causing agents (such as the chemical 
benzene) to the surprisingly commonplace problem of one worker restarting a machine 
while another is servicing it. For example, under a long-fought-for OSHA standard 
made effective in 2008, employers must pay for all OSHA-mandated personal protec-
tive equipment  (safety-specific eyewear, skin creams, clothing, etc.).46 In 2012, culmi-
nating a rule-making process that  began in 2006, OSHA issued a revised the Hazard 
Communication Standards to align with an international system adopted by the United 
Nations in 2002.47

Mine Safety
On Monday, April 5, 2010, an explosion at the Upper Big Branch Mine-South in  Montcoal, 
West Virginia, owned by a subsidiary of Massey Energy, Inc., killed 29 miners. In 2009, 
the Upper Branch Mine suffered a “significant spike in safety violations” leading the U.S. 
Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) to issue 515 citations 
More New Standards?
The protracted development of OSHA regulations typifies the ongoing ideological and 
practical conflict over imposing additional safety rules in American workplaces. Some of 
the competing considerations are illustrated by recent disputes over ergonomics and work-
place violence.
Ergonomics Repetitive motion and overexertion injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome 
and back strains, account for about one-third of workplace injuries.48  Employers often try 
to address these problems with ergonomics, “the science of fitting the job to the worker”49 
(for example, changing the height of a workstation). After years of work, OSHA issued 
ergonomics standards in 2000, but Congress repealed those rules in 2001 after business 
complaints about the costs of implementation. OSHA now employs a system of voluntary 
ergonomics guidelines, but critics consider them weak and vague. OSHA also can apply its 
general duty authority to address repetitive motion and over exertion. Experts now believe 
the carpal tunnel fears about keyboarding may have been exaggerated, although many 
blue-collar, assembly-line workers certainly are at risk. [For advice on measures to reduce 
repetitive stress problems for students, see http://ergo.human.cornell.edu/]
Violence
“Going postal” became an unfortunate but recognizable shorthand 
expression for  violence in the workplace. Workplace shootings have 
made for sadly familiar headlines, with no particular job site immune from such tragedy.
 
Should OSHA create specific duties for employers regarding workplace violence? 
Would those rules be effective? Or will the market and naturally evolving workplace 
 conditions provide the most effective and efficient protection?
 
Responses to these questions might be informed by legislation enacted in more than 
20 states prohibiting employers from banning firearms in parking areas, and employers’ 
reactions to these laws. Concerned with maintaining workplace safety, employers have 
focused on spotting and protecting against employees’ aggression through trainings and 
increased security when, for example, terminating an employee.50
Variances
Employers may seek both permanent and temporary variances (exceptions) from OSHA 
standards. A permanent variance may be granted only if the workplace will be as safe as if 
the standard were enforced. A temporary variance permits additional time to put in place the 
necessary compliance measures. Employees have a right to a hearing to contest variances.

the toughest enforcement measure ever against a mine, seeking a court order to temporarily 
close a Massey-owned mine in Kentucky which MSHA believed to be engaged in a pattern 
of failing to inspect and maintain critical areas.
 
In January 2011, MSHA announced a court order requiring Massey to comply with a 
plan to ensure the miners’ health and safety.

OSHA Information Requirements
Right to Know
OSHA has adopted an employee hazard communication standard to protect employees 
from the dangers associated with chemicals and other toxins in the workplace. Chemical 
manufacturers and importers must develop material safety data sheets (MSDS) for all 
chemicals. Employers must then label all chemical containers so that employees will know 
about the chemical and its dangers, and employers must educate employees about  chemical 
hazards and how to deal with them.
Records
As a general rule, businesses must maintain records listing and summarizing work-related 
injuries, illnesses, and deaths. A summary of those records must be posted at the job. No-
tice of any OSHA citations of imminent dangers on the job must also be posted at the job 
site. OSHA recently reformed and simplified the record-keeping process. Some smaller 
companies, especially those engaging in nonhazardous activities, do not need to meet the 
record-keeping requirements.
 
Does an employee’s injury suffered in a go-cart race held as part of an off-site team 
building event need to be reported? According to a 2009 letter from OSHA responding to 
this inquiry, an injury in those circumstances is work-related, and therefore reportable, 
even if the employee had the option to return to work or take a half-day vacation instead of 
participating in the go-cart race that followed a mandatory off-site meeting.51 A recent 
federal appellate decision suggested that requiring record keeping of all workplace injuries 
may be more efficient than analyzing whether such an injury is work-related.52
Enforcement
OSHA’s most publicized enforcement mechanism is the unannounced on-site inspection. 
Inspections arise at the initiative of the agency itself or at the request of employees or their 
representatives. The inspections must be conducted in a reasonable manner during work-
ing hours or other reasonable times, and ordinarily they must not be announced in advance. 
Employers can demand a warrant prior to inspection. With proper justification, warrants 
can easily be secured from a federal magistrate. Employer and employee representatives 
may accompany the inspector.

518  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 
To enhance efficiency, OSHA practices a targeted, site-specific inspection plan 
 designed to identify and monitor the workplaces most likely to have safety and health 
problems. A 2012 academic study found a nearly 10 percent drop in injuries in the four 
years following a randomized governmental safety inspection.53 However, an employer 
can become exempt from such inspections under OSHA’s Voluntary Protection Program 
(VPP), a program that has drawn criticism.54
Citations
Citations may be issued if violations are discovered during the inspection process. Imme-
diate, serious threats can be restrained with a court order. Following a citation, the em-
ployer may ask to meet with an area OSHA official to discuss the problem. Often a 
settlement emerges from these meetings. Failing a settlement, the employer can appeal to 
the independent OSHA Review Commission and thereafter to the federal court of appeals. 
Violations may lead to fines and/or imprisonment. In 2012, for example, OSHA cited and 
fined Excel, a company packing Hershey’s chocolates, $283,000 for failing to report doz-
ens of serious injuries to its workers, including students on an international exchange 
 program.55
Firmer Enforcement? The business community criticizes OSHA for unfairly increasing 
the cost of production by imposing inflexible and overzealous expectations. Labor organi-
zations and job safety advocates, on the other hand, have criticized OSHA as a timid, fal-
tering safety shield.
 
As part of the Obama administration’s efforts to increase enforcement and become 
more aggressive in protecting workers’ safety, OSHA, in 2010, announced its Severe 
 Violator Enforcement Program (SVEP). SVEP concentrates on employers who have 
 demonstrated indifference to their safety obligations by engaging in willful, repeated, or 
“failure to abate” violations. SVEP uses mandatory follow-up inspections, press releases, 
and increased fines, among other tools, to send a clear message that such conduct will be 
rigorously addressed by OSHA.56 OSHA makes public its list of severe violators. [For the 
current SVEP logs, see https://www.osha.gov/dep/]
 
But the critics’ question remains: Is the market the best vehicle for achieving job 
safety?
Workers’ Compensation
Korey Stringer, a 27-year-old Pro Bowl tackle, died of heatstroke 
complications on  August 1, 2001, after going through a preseason 
Minnesota Vikings workout.57  Normally, when an employee is 
 injured or dies on the job, the employee or the estate may not sue 
for damages. Rather, recovery is limited to the fixed sum provided 
for by the workers’  compensation statute, regardless of fault. Stringer’s family, however, 
filed a wrongful death suit seeking to hold the Vikings and various individuals responsi-
ble for gross negligence and other wrongs in responding to Stringer’s heatstroke. The 
 Vikings argued that the Stringer suit was barred by the state workers’ compensation law.

No Joke?
Matthew Simms worked as a server in the Manassas, Virginia, location of a national chain 
restaurant. During his work shift, Simms walked into the kitchen to enter an order into a 
computer and to print a check for a customer. Three other employees in the kitchen who 
were Simms’s friends started throwing ice at him, apparently as a joke. As Simms lifted his 
hand in an attempt to block the ice, he felt his left shoulder dislocate. Simms was taken to 
a hospital for treatment of his injury. As a result of the injury, Simms alleged he was 
 unable to use his shoulder in daily activities and was unable to work for a period of time. 
Should Simms receive workers’ compensation for his injuries? Explain.

 compensation exclusivity provisions in cases of gross negligence by the defendants.58 
The Stringers’ case reached the Minnesota Supreme Court in 2005 where the 4–2 major-
ity ruled on technical grounds against the family’s gross negligence claim, thus limiting 
their remedy to  workers’ compensation, a sum much beneath  Stringer’s projected com-
mercial worth.59
 
Early in the 20th century, the states began enacting workers’ compensation laws to pro-
vide an administrative remedy for those, like Stringer, who are injured or killed on the job. 
Previously, employers’ superior financial resources and various  technical  legal defenses 
meant that employees often could not successfully sue to  recover damages for their 
 on-the-job injuries. All states now provide some form of workers’  compensation not 
 requiring a lawsuit. Instead, workers or their families apply for compensation based on ill-
ness, injury, or death. Typically, the system is governed by a state board or commission. 
Most decisions are routine and based on the  completed  application. Often a claims 
 examiner will verify the nature and severity of the injury. Although workers’  compensation 
is generally the exclusive remedy for workplace injury or death caused by employers’ 
 negligence, many states recognize an  exception for intentional torts. An exception based 
on gross negligence, however, is rare.
 
In most states, employers are compelled to participate in workers’ compensation, 
 depending on state law, either by purchasing insurance privately, by contributing to a 
 state-managed fund, or by being self-insured (paying claims directly from their own 
funds). Firms with good safety records are rewarded with lower premium payments.
Benefits
Medical and rehabilitation expenses along with partial income replacement are provided 
according to state law. The amount of the income award is normally a percentage of the 
worker’s salary either for a specified period or indefinitely, depending on the severity of 
the injury. Injury benefits normally amount to one-half to two-thirds of regular wages. 
Death benefits ordinarily are tied to the wages of the deceased.

Certain employment classifications such as agriculture may be excluded from workers’ 
compensation, but about 90 percent of the labor force is covered. Most on-the-job injuries 
are covered, but those that are self-inflicted (including starting a fight) and others such as 
those springing from alcohol or drug use may not be.

In general, injuries, illnesses, and deaths are compensable where the harm (1) arose out of 
the employment and (2) occurred in the course of employment (explained next in Wait). 
Proof of employer negligence is not required, and the traditional defenses such as contribu-
tory negligence are not available to the employer. Thus, workers’ compensation provides a 
form of no-fault protection in the workplace. Workers give up the right to sue, and employ-
ers participate in an insurance system that recognizes the inevitability of workplace harm.
 
Although workers’ compensation recovery is the exclusive remedy for workplace 
 injury, illness, or death, some jurisdictions allow litigation in cases of intentional torts and/
or gross negligence, as noted earlier. [For the Workers’ Compensation Research Institute, 
see www.wcrinet.org]
Litigation
Notwithstanding its no-fault character, workers’ compensation has generated many 
 lawsuits. Consider the example of David Gross, a 16-year-old employee at KFC, who was 
injured when he placed water in a pressurized deep fryer to clean it. KFC’s employee 
handbook explicitly instructed against such an action, as did a warning label on the fryer. 
Furthermore, immediately preceding the incident, Gross’s supervisor and two coworkers 
 admonished him to not do it. The employer fired Gross for violating an important work-
place safety rule. The Ohio Supreme Court initially terminated his workers’ compensation 
benefits using the “voluntary abandonment” doctrine under which workers’ compensation 
benefits may be terminated because the loss of income is not due to the injury itself. 
 However, the Court then reconsidered and ordered reinstatement of Gross’s benefits.60 The 
Wait case that follows raises some current issues regarding workers’ compensation for the 
telecommuting employee.

necessary office equipment, including a printer, a facsimile 
machine, a dedicated business telephone line, and a budget to 
purchase office supplies. In all respects, the plaintiff’s home 
office  functioned as her work place. Not only did the plaintiff 
perform her daily work for the ACS at her home office, the 
plaintiff’s supervisor and co-workers attended meetings at the 
office in her house. There is no evidence in the record with 
respect to any designated hours or conditions of the plaintiff’s 
employment, nature of her work space, or other work rules. 
Significantly, the plaintiff’s work for the ACS did not require 
her to open her house to the public. In fact, during working 
hours the plaintiff locked the outside doors of her home and 
activated an alarm system for her protection. Unfortunately, 
however, on September 3, 2004, the plaintiff opened her door 
to a neighbor, Nathaniel Sawyers (“Sawyers”), who brutally 
assaulted and severely injured the plaintiff.
 
The plaintiff met Sawyers in May or early June of 2004 at a 
neighborhood cookout she attended with her husband. There-
after, Sawyers, who lived approximately one block from the 
plaintiff’s home, came to the plaintiff’s home for a short social 
visit on a weekend day in late June. The plaintiff and her husband 
spoke with Sawyers for approximately five minutes, and then 
Sawyers left. In August, Sawyers came to the plaintiff’s home 
on a weekday for a social visit; however, the plaintiff was pre-
paring to leave her home office for a job-related television in-
terview. The plaintiff told Sawyers that she was going to a 
business meeting. When Sawyers replied that he was on his 
way to a job interview in Nashville, the plaintiff allowed 
 Sawyers to ride with her to his job interview.
 
On September 3, 2004, the plaintiff was working alone at her 
home office. Around noon, the plaintiff was in her kitchen pre-
paring her lunch when Sawyers knocked on her door. The plain-
tiff answered and invited Sawyers into the house, and he stayed 
for a short time and then left. However, a moment later, Sawyers 
returned, telling the plaintiff that he had left his keys in her 
kitchen. When the plaintiff turned away from the door, Sawyers 
followed her inside and brutally assaulted the  plaintiff without 
provocation or explanation, beating the plaintiff until she lost 
consciousness. As a result of this assault, the plaintiff suffered 
severe injuries, including head trauma, a  severed ear, several 
broken bones, stab wounds,  strangulation injuries, and perma-
nent nerve damage to the left side of her body.
 
On December 12, 2005, the plaintiff filed a complaint seek-
ing workers’ compensation benefits from Travelers Indemnity 
Company of Illinois, the insurer of the ACS. (The plaintiff did 
not name the ACS as a defendant.) The plaintiff alleged that 
the she was entitled to workers’ compensation benefits for the 
injuries she sustained in the assault because the assault arose 
out of and occurred in the course of her employment with the 
ACS. The defendant . . . [denied] that the injuries arose out of 
or occurred in the course of the plaintiff’s employment.
 
Following discovery, the defendant filed a motion for sum-
mary judgment, which the chancery court granted. The chan-
cery court concluded that the plaintiff’s injuries did not arise 
out of or occur in the course of her employment with the ACS. 
Additionally, the chancery court noted that Sawyers “was not 
[at the plaintiff’s home office] on any kind of business with the 
[ACS], nor was he really there on any kind of business with the 
[p]laintiff.”
 
The plaintiff appealed. We accepted review.

III. ANALYSIS
A. The Workers’ Compensation Act and Telecommuting
The Workers’ Compensation Act (“Act”), codified at Tennes-
see Code Annotated sections 50-6-101 to -801 (2005), is a leg-
islatively created quid pro quo system where an injured 
worker forfeits any potential common law rights for recovery 
against his or her employer in return for a system that pro-
vides compensation completely independent of any fault on 
the part of the employer. The Act should be liberally con-
strued in favor of compensation and any doubts should be 
resolved in the  employee’s favor. However, this liberal con-
struction requirement does not authorize courts to amend, al-
ter, or extend its provisions beyond its obvious meaning.
* * * * *
 
This case requires us to apply the Act to a new and  growing 
trend in the labor and employment market: telecommuting. An 
employee telecommutes when he or she takes advantage of 
electronic mail, internet, facsimile machines and other techno-
logical advancements to work from home or a place other than 
the traditional work site. In 2006, approximately thirty-four 
 million American workers telecommuted to some degree.
* * * * *
 
Not surprisingly, however, this innovative working 
 arrangement has resulted in an issue of first impression: 
whether the injuries a telecommuter sustains as a result of an 
assault at her home arise out of and occur in the course of her 
employment.
B. Did the plaintiff’s injuries occur in the course of her 
employment?
It is well settled in Tennessee, and in many other jurisdic-
tions, that for an injury to be compensable under the Act, it 

522  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
must both “arise out of” and occur “in the course of” 
 employment. Although both of these statutory requirements 
seek to ensure a connection between the employment and 
the  injuries for which benefits are being sought, they are not 
synonymous. As such, the “arising out of” requirement refers 
to cause or origin; whereas, “in the course of” denotes the 
time, place, and circumstances of the injury. Furthermore, 
we have consistently abstained from adopting any particular 
judicial test, doctrine, formula, or label that purports to 
“clearly define the line between accidents and injuries 
which arise out of and in the course of employment [and] 
those which do not[.]”
* * * * *
 
In this case, we will consider the second requirement first. 
An injury occurs in the course of employment “when it takes 
place within the period of the employment, at a place where 
the employee reasonably may be, and while the employee is 
fulfilling work duties or engaged in doing something incidental 
thereto.”
 
Generally, injuries sustained during personal breaks are 
compensable.
* * * * *
 
[T]he defendant here argues that the plaintiff’s injuries are 
not compensable because the plaintiff was not “fulfilling a 
work duty” in admitting Sawyers into her kitchen. It is true 
that the plaintiff suffered her injuries while preparing her 
lunch in the kitchen of her home; however, the plaintiff’s work 
site was located within her home. Under these circum-
stances, the plaintiff’s kitchen was comparable to the 
 kitchens and break rooms that employers routinely provide at 
traditional work sites. Moreover, the ACS was aware of and 
implicitly  approved of the plaintiff’s work site. Her supervisor 
and co-workers had attended meetings at the plaintiff’s home 
office. It is reasonable to conclude that the ACS realized that 
the plaintiff would take personal breaks during the course of 
her working day. . . .
 
Thus, after careful review, we conclude that the injuries 
the plaintiff sustained while on her lunch break, occurred dur-
ing the course of the plaintiff’s employment. The plaintiff was 
assaulted at a place where her employer could reasonably 
expect her to be. The ACS permitted the plaintiff to work from 
home for approximately four years. The plaintiff’s supervisor 
and co-workers regularly came to her home office for meet-
ings. The record does not suggest that the ACS restricted the 
plaintiff’s activities during working hours or prohibited her 
from taking personal breaks. The facts do not show that the 
plaintiff was engaging in any  prohibited conduct or was 
 violating any company policy by preparing lunch in her 
kitchen. It is reasonable to conclude that the ACS would 
have anticipated that the plaintiff would take a lunch break at 
her home just as employees do at traditional work sites. Im-
portantly, Sawyer’s initial visit was very brief and spontane-
ous. Unless instructed otherwise by the employer, an 
employee working from a home office who answers a knock 
at her door and briefly admits an acquaintance into her home 
does not necessarily depart so far from her work duties so as 
to remove her from the course of her  employment. This is not 
to say, however, that situations may never arise where more 
prolonged or planned social  visits might well remove the em-
ployee from the course of the  employment.
 
In arguing that the plaintiff’s injury did not occur “in the 
course of” her employment, the defendant maintains that the 
plaintiff’s decision to admit Sawyers into her home was not a 
work duty. However, this argument misses the mark on this 
requirement because the Act does not explicitly state that 
the employee’s actions must benefit the employer; it only re-
quires that the injuries occur in “the course of” the employ-
ment. Because the plaintiff was engaged in a permissible 
personal break incidental to her employment, we reject the 
defendant’s narrow interpretation of the Act. The question is 
not whether the plaintiff’s injuries occurred while she was 
performing a duty owed to the ACS, but rather whether the 
time, place, and circumstances demonstrate that the injuries 
occurred while the plaintiff was engaged in an activity inci-
dental to her employment. Accordingly, we hold that the 
plaintiff suffered her injuries during the course of her em-
ployment and disagree with the chancery court’s conclusion 
on this important point.
C. Did the plaintiff’s injuries arise out of her 
employment?
Even though the plaintiff’s injuries occurred “in the course of” 
her employment, we nevertheless hold that they did not “arise 
out of” her job duties with the ACS. The phrase “arising out of” 
requires that a causal connection exist between the employ-
ment conditions and the resulting injury. With respect to 
whether an assault arises out of employment, we have previ-
ously delineated assaults into three general classifications:
(1) assaults with an “inherent connection” to employment 
such as disputes over performance, pay or termination; 
(2) assaults stemming from “inherently private” disputes 
imported into the employment setting from the claimant’s 
domestic or private life and not exacerbated by the 
employment; and (3) assaults resulting from a “neutral 
force” such as random assaults on employees by 
individuals outside the employment relationship.

Chapter Twelve  Employment Law I: Employee Rights  523
When an assault has an “inherent connection” to the employ-
ment it is compensable. On the other hand, assaults originat-
ing from “inherently private” disputes and imported into the 
work place are not compensable. However, whether “neutral 
assaults” are compensable turns on the “facts and circum-
stances of the employment.”
 
The assault in this case is best described as a “neutral as-
sault.” In granting the defendant’s motion for summary judg-
ment, the chancery court commented: “[T]here’s certainly not 
any evidence that this person who committed the assault was 
part of the working employment relationship and was not there 
on any kind of business related to the [ACS] or really any busi-
ness with the employee.” We agree with the chancery court’s 
conclusions. A “neutral force” assault is one that is “neither 
personal to the claimant nor distinctly associated with the 
 employment.”
 
The categories focus on what catalyst spurred the assault, 
i.e., was it a dispute arising from a work-related duty, was it a 
dispute arising from a personal matter, or was it unexplained 
or irrational? An assault that is spurred by neither a catalyst 
inherently connected to the employment nor stemming from 
an inherently private dispute is most aptly labeled as a “neu-
tral force” assault. Here, the undisputed facts clearly show 
that the assault had neither an inherent connection with the 
employment, nor did it stem from a personal dispute between 
Sawyers and the plaintiff. Therefore, we must focus our atten-
tion on the facts and circumstances of the plaintiff’s employ-
ment and its relationship to the injuries sustained by the 
plaintiff.
 
Generally, for an injury to “arise out of” employment, it 
must emanate from a peculiar danger or risk inherent to the 
nature of the employment. However, in limited circumstances, 
where the employment involves “indiscriminate exposure to 
the general public,” the “street risk” doctrine may supply the 
required causal connection between the employment and the 
injury.
* * * * *
[T]his Court held that the “street risk” doctrine satisfied the 
causal connection requirement where the employee was as-
saulted by unknown assailants as he removed paperwork from 
his employer’s van while it was parked at his residence. We 
carefully limited application of the street risk doctrine to 
“workers whose employment exposes them to the hazards of 
the street, or who are assaulted under circumstances that 
fairly suggest they were singled out for attack because of their 
association with their employer. . . .”
 
Unlike our previous cases in which the facts supported ap-
plication of the “street risk” doctrine to provide the necessary 
causal connection, the facts here do not establish that the 
plaintiff’s employment exposed her to a street hazard or that 
she was singled out for her association with her employer. 
There is nothing to indicate that she was targeted because of 
her association with her employer or that she was charged 
with safeguarding her employer’s property. Additionally, the 
plaintiff was not advancing the interests of the ACS when she 
allowed Sawyers into her kitchen, and her employment with 
the ACS did not impose any duty upon the plaintiff to admit 
Sawyers to her home.
 
The plaintiff argues that had it not been for her employ-
ment arrangement, she would not have been at home to suf-
fer these attacks. However, we have never held that any and 
every assault which occurs at the work site arises out of em-
ployment. Additionally, although Sawyers knew from a previ-
ous visit that the plaintiff was home during the day, there is 
nothing in the record which indicates that there was a causal 
connection between the plaintiff’s employment and the 
 assault.

Questions
1. The Tennessee Supreme Court in Wait (and most courts in 
workers’ compensation cases) required a two-part show-
ing that the injury must “arise out of” and “in the course 
of” employment.
 
a. Explain those two standards.
 
b.  Must an employee be engaged in an activity that 
 benefits the employer in order to be “in the course of 
employment?” Explain.
 
c.  Why did the court conclude that Wait’s injuries did not 
arise out of her employment?
2. Why did the court conclude that the “street risk” doctrine 
did not apply to Wait’s injuries?
3. Fernandez, an exotic dancer, left her job drunk and was 
seriously injured in a crash while riding as a passenger in 
a car driven by another dancer. The crash came within 
one hour of leaving work. Her intoxication led to her deci-
sion to ride with her intoxicated coworker. Fernandez 
sought workers’ compensation. She claimed that her em-
ployer, Bottoms Up Lounge in Council Bluffs, Iowa, re-
quired her to socialize with male customers when not 
dancing and to generate at least two drinks per hour from 
customers. Dancers were not required to drink, but most 
dancers consumed six to eight drinks per night or more. 
Did Fernandez’s injury arise out of and in the course of 

524  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
employment so that she can recover workers’ compensa-
tion? Explain. See 2800 Corp. v. Fernandez, 528 N.W.2d 
124 (Ia. S.Ct. 1995).
4. Joseph Smyth, a college mathematics instructor, was 
killed while driving his personal auto home from work. At 
the time, Smyth had student papers with him, which he in-
tended to grade that evening. He often worked at home. 
Many faculty members took work home in the evenings. 
However, the college did not require that practice. Indeed, 
the college neither encouraged nor discouraged working 
at home.
The widely adopted “going and coming rule” pro-
vides that employees injured while commuting to and 
from work, in general, are not covered by workers’ 
 compensation.
 
a.  Should Smyth (and other teachers) be exempted from 
the going and coming rule, thus permitting recovery by 
Smyth’s family? Explain. See Santa Rosa Junior College 
v. Workers’ Compensation Appeals Board and Joann 
Smyth, 708 P.2d 673 (Cal. S.Ct. 1985).
 
b.  Would you reach a different conclusion had a student 
been accompanying Smyth? Explain.
5. Casimer Gacioch worked at a Stroh Brewery. The company 
provided free beer at work. When he began work in 1947 he 
drank only three to four beers on the weekend. He was fired 
in 1974, by which time he was drinking 12 bottles of beer 
daily. After Gacioch’s death, his wife sought workers’ com-
pensation benefits. The evidence indicated that Gacioch 
had a predisposition to alcoholism but was not an alcoholic 
at the time he was hired. How would you rule on the widow’s 
workers’ compensation claim? Explain. See Gacioch v. Stroh 
Brewery, 466 N.W.2d 303 (Mich Ct. of  Appeals, 1991).
Part Five—Employee Privacy
Privacy on the Job? More than half of Americans between 18 and 25 have done at least 
one of the following: gotten a tattoo, dyed their hair an untraditional color, or had a body 
piercing other than on their ear lobe. Fewer than a quarter of those 
between 40 and 64 have done any of these.61 Will you have to give 
up that butterfly tattoo on your ankle when you move on to the “real 
world” of professional employment?  Typically, employers have 
dress codes  requiring a neat, clean appearance. Other employers might have specific re-
quirements, such as covering tattoos during work hours.62
 
Employer oversight extends well beyond appearance policies. Drug tests, integrity tests, 
personality tests, surveillance, and as seen earlier in this chapter, searches for applicants’ 
online reputations are routine personnel practices in many firms. Employers have an inter-
est in these strategies not only to hire better employees and improve productivity but to 
protect coworkers, reduce insurance claims, and shield consumers from poor products and 
service. On the other hand, job applicants and employees resist parking their personal iden-
tity and privacy at the office door.
Privacy off the Job? A growing number of employers offer incentives such as financial 
rewards or prizes to employees who try to get healthier. These wellness programs may re-
ward employees for taking part in a fitness assessment or weight-loss program, or attaining 
certain health metrics such as an ideal blood pressure or cholesterol level. Penalties can 
also be exacted in the form of higher health care premiums or an actual payment.63 Al-
though supporters praise such programs as benefitting employees who otherwise might not 
have the incentive or opportunity to improve their health, critics observe that such 
Will you have to give up 
that butterfly tattoo?

Chapter Twelve  Employment Law I: Employee Rights  525
 programs overstep boundaries in the employment relationship, intruding into employees’ 
rights to make their own health-related choices. As Randall Wilson, general counsel of the 
Iowa Civil Liberties Union, explained:
The concern is that with the rise of corporate power, we’re beginning to feel at the mercy of 
a government operating outside a government.64
And what about office romance? Robert Barbee, former national 
sales manager for Household Automotive Finance, sued HAF after 
he was fired for dating Melanie Tomita, an HAF salesperson. They 
worked in different locations, and he did not directly supervise her. 
He claimed that the dismissal violated his right to privacy, but a California appeals court 
ruled for HAF in part on the grounds that the company needed to prevent conflicts of 
interest, sexual harassment claims, and the appearance of favoritism.65 Although relatively 
few office romance cases have reached the courts, most employers appear comfortable in 
restricting office romance to some degree, such as prohibiting relationships between a 
 supervisor and subordinate or requiring employees who are dating to inform their 
 supervisor.66
Monitoring
The City of Ontario, California, Police Department issued pagers to its police officers for 
business purposes. The city paid for a text messaging plan, but officers who exceeded the 
allotted messaging quota were required to pay overage charges. While at work,  Sargeant 
Jeff Quon sent personal, sometimes sexually explicit, text messages on his police 
 department-issued pager to both his then-wife and a  coworker with whom he was romanti-
cally  involved. Noticing a  frequency in overage charges, the police department audited the 
content of  police  officers’ texts to determine whether the overage charges were the result 
of  work-related messages that might show the need to upgrade the text-messaging plan. 
 Although a workplace policy stated that  employees had no expectation of privacy in using 
Internet or e-mail  provided them at work, it did not address the pagers given to the police 
officers. As a result of the audit, Quon was disciplined for misusing the pager.
 
The question facing the Supreme Court in 2010 was whether the police department’s 
review of Sargeant Quon’s text messages violated his Fourth Amendment right to privacy. 
Acknowledging that “workplace norms” regarding technology are evolving, in 2010 the 
U.S. Supreme Court held in City of Ontario v. Quon that even assuming Quon had a rea-
sonable expectation of privacy in his text messages, the police department’s review of the 
text messages did not violate Quon’s Fourth Amendment rights. Ontario had a legitimate 
reason for the search, and the search was not excessive in scope.67
 
Employers’ rights to monitor electronic messages may be defined on a case-by-case 
basis. A former employee had sent e-mails to her attorney regarding a possible workplace 
discrimination claim using a company laptop computer and her personal, password- 
protected e-mail account rather than her business e-mail address. After she resigned and 
sued, her former employer hired a computer expert who retrieved the e-mails between her 
and her attorney, which were then reviewed by the company’s attorney. Holding that the 
Robert Barbee was fired for 
dating Melanie Tomita.

526  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 employee had a reasonable expectation of privacy in those e-mails, the New Jersey Su-
preme Court also acknowledged that although employers can establish rules regarding use 
of workplace computers and discipline employees accordingly, this power did not include 
the right to read privileged communications between an employee and her attorney.68
The Law
In general, employers can lawfully monitor workers’ attendance, performance, e-mail, use 
of the Internet, and so on, but uncertainty remains. Having a clear, written workplace 
 policy regarding the use and monitoring of workplace technology is a good employment 
practice. [For a sample policy regarding technology in the workplace, see www.shrm.org
/TemplatesTools/Samples/Policies/Pages/CMS_000558.aspx]
 
The primary federal legislation, the 1986 Electronic Communications Privacy Act, 
 prohibits private individuals and organizations from intercepting wire, oral, or electronic 
communications. The act provides for two exceptions, however: (1) prior consent by one 
of the parties to the communication, and (2) employer monitoring in the “ordinary course 
of business” by telephone or other device furnished by a provider of wire or electronic 
communication service. Thus, workplace monitoring of phone calls (except for purely 
 private conversations), workplace computers, voice mail, e-mail, and Internet use are all 
likely to be considered lawful at this point if approached in a reasonable manner.
 
As discussed previously in this chapter, job applicants face the possibility that their 
prospective employers might be researching their online reputations. Should the employer 
be allowed to require job applicants to disclose their passwords to their Facebook and other 
social media accounts? In 2012, six states—California, Delaware, Illinois,  Maryland, 
Michigan, and New Jersey—enacted legislation prohibiting an employer from requesting 
or requiring an employee or applicant to disclose a user name or password for a personal 
social media account.69 
 
Requesting access to employees’ social media accounts, even in the absence of legisla-
tion, still creates potential liability for the employer, as illustrated in a 2009 case involving 
a restaurant employee’s invitation-only group on MySpace.com for coworkers to “vent” 
about work. Posts included sexual comments about the employer’s managers and custom-
ers as well as references to illegal drug use. When one member showed the MySpace pro-
file to a manager, she was later asked by another manager to share the password to access 
the profile. The employer terminated the profile’s creator as well as another one of the in-
vited coworkers, who sued for, among other claims, invasion of privacy. Given that a jury 
could reasonably find that the invited member of the MySpace group was coerced into 
providing the password, making the employer’s access unauthorized, a federal district 
court upheld the jury’s verdict against the employer.70
“BYOD” to Work
While some employers provide employees with a cell phone or tablet for work use, others 
may encourage use of employees’ own personal devices, known as “bring your own device 
(BYOD).” According to a 2013 survey, approximately one-fifth of employers may  perform 

Chapter Twelve  Employment Law I: Employee Rights  527
“remote wipes” of employees’ devices such as cell phones during or after employment as 
a means of securing data. This practice results in employees losing photos, contact lists, 
and other personal data. Employees who are asked to BYOD face the dilemma of either 
risking the loss of personal information when a cell phone is erased, or appearing to be not 
committed to their jobs for refusing to use a personal device to stay electronically con-
nected to work.
Question
How may an employer limit liability for invasion of privacy claims arising from remote 
wipes of employees’ personal cell phones? Explain.

was visible. The image would cut in and out every few sec-
onds. Videotapes located in Speirs’s office were blank.
 
Speirs purchased the camera on November 26, 2005. Miller 
told the police, when interviewed on December 28, she saw 
the camera in the bathroom on November 28, 2005. Speirs, in 
another proceeding, testified he used the camera to monitor 
Miller at her desk on December 10, 2005, and in seven or ten 
viewings, he observed no wrongdoing.

Koeppel [sued] Speirs, alleging . . . invasion of privacy. . . . 
Speirs then filed a motion for summary judgment . . . claiming 
there was no actual intrusion upon Koeppel’s privacy because 
there is no evidence he viewed her in the restroom. Koeppel 
[argued] Speirs’s act of placing the camera in the bathroom 
with the intent to view her was an invasion of her privacy. She 
also argued there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find 
the camera was operational. . . . The district court entered its 
ruling, granting Speirs’s motion. The court agreed Speirs in-
tended to view Koeppel while she was in the bathroom, but 
concluded Koeppel could only be liable for an actual intrusion 
on her privacy, not an attempted intrusion. Finding no evi-
dence Speirs viewed Koeppel in the bathroom, the court dis-
missed the claim.
 
On November 25, 2008, Koeppel appealed. . . .

EISENHAUER, P. J.
I. BACKGROUND FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS
[Sara] Koeppel and Deanna Miller were the only employees of 
Speirs, an insurance agent. A small (4’ x 7’) bathroom with a 
sink and toilet is located in the office. On December 27, 2005, 
Koeppel discovered a digital surveillance camera hidden in-
side the office bathroom. After contacting the Waterloo Police 
Department, a search warrant was obtained and officers lo-
cated the camera in the bathroom. The camera was positioned 
to view the toilet and surrounding area. When confronted by 
police, Speirs produced the receiver and monitor for the 
 camera from a locked drawer in his desk.
 
When questioned about the presence of the camera, 
Speirs admitted he had placed it in the bathroom on Decem-
ber 26, 2005, and stated he did so because he suspected one 
of his employees was abusing drugs while at work and was 
concerned she would embezzle money. Speirs claimed he 
was unable to get a signal from the camera when it was in 
the bathroom. At the time the officers arrived, the surveil-
lance system was not set up to receive images from the cam-
era. However, setup could be completed by plugging the 
equipment found in Speirs’s desk drawer into an electrical 
outlet.
 
After connecting the equipment, the officers tested it and 
found it did not work. Speirs told the officers the camera bat-
tery was likely dead. After changing the battery at Speirs’s

III. INVASION OF PRIVACY 
Koeppel first contends the court erred in granting summary 
judgment on her invasion of privacy claim. She contends 
 Speirs’s act of placing a camera in the bathroom with the in-
tent to view her is sufficient to support a cause of action for 
invasion of privacy. In the alternative, she contends there is a 
question of fact as to whether there was an actual intrusion 
into her privacy.
 
. . . Iowa has adopted the tort of invasion of privacy, as set 
forth in the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977), which pro-
vides the right to privacy can be invaded by “unreasonable 
intrusion upon the seclusion of another.” . . . Under this theory,
[o]ne who intentionally intrudes, physically or otherwise, 
upon the solitude or seclusion of another or his private 
affairs or concerns, is subject to liability to the other for 
invasion of privacy, if the intrusion would be highly 
offensive to a reasonable person.
 
. . . To recover under this theory, Koeppel must show Speirs 
intentionally intruded upon her seclusion, and that a reasona-
ble person would find the intrusion “highly offensive.”. . . .
 
There is no question viewing or recording Koeppel while in 
the bathroom would be considered “highly offensive” by any 
reasonable person. There also can be no dispute a bathroom 
is a place where one enjoys seclusion. Nor is it debatable that 
Speirs acted intentionally in placing a recording device in the 
bathroom. The question presented in this case is whether 
there is enough evidence to create a question of fact as to 
whether there was an intrusion on Koeppel’s privacy.
 
The district court concluded an actual invasion of privacy 
must occur for the cause of action to stand and found no facts 
supported an actual invasion. Koeppel argues intent to intrude 
on privacy is enough to maintain a cause of action. She cites 
In re Marriage of Tigges and two cases outside this jurisdic-
tion in support of her argument.
 
In the case of Tigges, our supreme court addressed the 
question of unreasonable intrusion upon the seclusion of an-
other where a husband secretly videotaped his wife in their 
bedroom. Tigges, 758 N.W.2d at 825. The husband argued 
there was no invasion of privacy because the video captured 
nothing “private” or “sexual” in nature. Id. at 829. In rejecting 
this claim, our supreme court stated:
The wrongfulness of the conduct springs not from the specific 
nature of the recorded activities, but instead from the fact that 
Cathy’s activities were recorded without her knowledge and 
consent at a time and place and under circumstances in 
which she had a reasonable expectation of privacy.
Id. at 830. We disagree with Koeppel’s assertion that Tigges 
supports the proposition that the focus of invasion of privacy 
claims are on the intent of the perpetrator; as our supreme 
court states, it’s the fact the victim was recorded without her 
knowledge and consent that results in the intrusion. See id.
* * * * *
Koeppel cites Harkey v. Abate, . . . . In that case, the plaintiffs 
brought an invasion of privacy suit after using a roller-skating 
rink restroom with see-through panels installed in the ceiling, 
which permitted surreptitious observation from above. The 
Michigan Court of Appeals stated:
In our opinion, the installation of the hidden viewing devices 
alone constitutes an interference with that privacy which a 
reasonable person would find highly offensive. And though 
the absence of proof that the devices were utilized is 
relevant to the question of damages, it is not fatal to 
plaintiff’s case.
 
. . . Although this case does not support Koeppel’s argu-
ment that mere intent to intrude on privacy is enough, it pro-
vides guidance in establishing the proof necessary to survive 
summary judgment on an invasion-of-privacy claim.
* * * * *
In its summary judgment ruling, the trial court . . . cites 
Brazinski v. Amoco Petroleum Additives Co.,. . . , where a fe-
male business invitee brought an invasion-of-privacy claim 
after learning the defendant had a television camera trained 
on the entrance of a locker room for its female employees. 
The court . . . concluded the plaintiff’s claim could not stand 
because she was unable to show she had been in the locker 
room during the period the surveillance was being 
 conducted.. . . . The case is distinguishable from Koeppel’s 
case, however, because as a business invitee, the plaintiff in 
Brazinski was not presumed to have used the locker room as 
the defendant’s female employees did. . . . Unlike Brazinski, 
there is no doubt in the present case that Koeppel used the 
office bathroom.
* * * * *
From the foregoing cases, we conclude to succeed on her 
claim, Koeppel must show the surveillance camera was capa-
ble of functioning while in the bathroom. Speirs claims it was 
not, that he was unable to receive any signal from the camera 
in the bathroom. Other evidence shows when a new battery 
was in the camera, a picture of the bathroom was visible on 
the monitor in Speirs’s office, albeit not a clear and consistent 
one. The images obtained from the bathroom need not have 
been of high quality to establish an invasion of privacy, nor did 
the camera need to be pointed at the toilet—it is sufficient that 
the seclusion of the bathroom, a private area, was intruded 

Chapter Twelve  Employment Law I: Employee Rights  529
upon. There is also evidence the camera was in the bathroom 
earlier in November.
* * * * *
Accordingly, we reverse the district court ruling granting sum-
mary judgment in favor of Speirs on this claim.
* * * * *
Questions
1. At trial, how could Speirs be found liable for invasion of 
privacy if the bathroom camera was not operating? 
 Explain.
2. The court in Koeppel cited an additional case involving the 
following facts: The director of a nonprofit residential facil-
ity for neglected and abused children learned that some-
one was accessing pornographic websites late at night 
from a facility office computer located in an enclosed of-
fice. The two employees stationed in that office performed 
clerical work during normal business hours and were not 
suspected. Without telling them, the director installed a 
hidden camera in the office, trained on the computer in 
question. The camera did not operate during the day. After 
discovering the camera, the employees sued for invasion 
of privacy. 
 
a. How might this case support the court’s decision in 
Koeppel? 
 
b. Decide. Explain. See Hernandez v. Hillsides, 47 Cal. 4th 
272 (Cal. 2010).
3. Young was the pastor of Ft. Caroline United Methodist 
Church in Florida. Young was provided with a private office 
and a computer in that office. The computer was not net-
worked to any other computers. Young and the church ad-
ministrator had keys to the office. No one was permitted in 
the office without Young’s permission, and the church ad-
ministrator was not permitted to log on to the computer un-
less Young was present.
 
The church administrator received notice from the 
church’s Internet service provider that spam was linked to the 
church’s Internet address. The administrator ran a  “spybot” 
program on the church computers and found questionable 
Web addresses. The church’s district supervisor and bishop 
were contacted and permission was given to involve police 
officials. Officers came to the church, the administrator un-
locked Young’s office and signed “consent to search” forms 
for the office and the computer. Officers searched the office 
and computer and found proscribed  images and websites.
 
Young subsequently filed a trial court motion to suppress 
the evidence gained from the office and computer search. 
The trial judge granted that motion ruling that the search 
 violated Young’s Fourth Amendment right to be free of 
 unreasonable searches and seizures. The state appealed. 
Rule on that appeal. See State v. Young, 974 So.2d 601 
 (Fla. App. 1 Dist. 2008).
Drug Testing
Mary Wheeler decided that she had to institute an employee drug-testing program for her 
Chagrin Falls, Ohio, landscaping company. One job applicant at Wheeler’s company told 
the interviewer that he would have no problem with the drug test. Then  according to 
Wheeler: “While filling out his paperwork, the interviewer asked the applicant for a 
 driver’s license. The applicant reached into his pocket, and by accident pulled out a small 
bag of cocaine.”71 That episode certainly confirmed Wheeler’s  judgment that workplace 
drug tests were necessary for her company, and the data support Wheeler’s fears. Accord-
ing to a federal government study, nearly one out of five workers between the ages of 
18 and 25 used illicit drugs in the past month, along with one out of ten between the ages 
of 26 and 34.72 One employee high on marijuana dropped his forklift five feet off a loading 
dock and employees at another job built a meth lab in the back of a truck.73
 
In an effort to address those workplace drug problems, employers provide information 
about illicit drug abuse, have written policies regarding drug use in the workplace, and 
 offer  employee assistance programs (EAPs).74 Furthermore, as a 2010 Society for Human 

530  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 Resource  Management (SHRM) poll revealed, 55 percent of employers use drug testing in 
hiring employees, whereas 80 percent of employers conduct “reasonable suspicion” work-
place drug testing.75
Drug-Free Workplace
The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 applies to employers who have contracts of 
$100,000 or more with the federal government or who receive aid from the government. 
Those employers are required to develop an antidrug policy for employees. They must 
provide drug-free awareness programs for employees, and they must  acquaint employees 
with available assistance for those with drug problems, while also warning them of the 
penalties that accompany violation of the policy. The act requires employees to adhere to 
the company policy and to inform the company within five days if they are convicted of or 
plead no contest to a drug-related offense in the workplace. [For more information on the 
Federal Drug-Free Workplace Program, see www.workplace.samhsa.gov/]
Drug Testing in Law and Practice
Drug testing is regulated primarily by state law so generalizations are difficult. Broadly, 
we can say, however, that private-sector drug testing, properly conducted, ordinarily is 
lawful in the following five situations:
1. Preemployment testing. State and local law may impose some restrictions.
2. In association with periodic physical examinations. Advance notice is often required.
3. For cause. An employer has probable cause or reasonable suspicion.
4. Postaccident testing where drug use is suspected.
5. Follow-up testing for those returning from drug (or alcohol) rehabilitation.
 
Random testing, on the other hand, sometimes produces significant legal issues. A num-
ber of states forbid random drug testing or limit it to safety-sensitive situations. The U.S. 
Supreme Court has upheld such testing for public-sector employees where public safety is 
involved and for those having access to particularly sensitive information.76 The legality of 
drug testing often reduces to a balancing test where the employee’s right to privacy is bal-
anced against the employer’s business needs. Where safety and secu rity are involved and 
when notice is provided, the courts are more supportive of testing. Particularly intrusive or 
careless testing often tilts that balance toward employees. Beyond the balancing test, a 
number of other legal considerations influence employer drug-testing practices, particu-
larly in public-sector jobs:
1. U.S. Constitution. As explained in Chapter 5, the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. 
 Constitution forbids unreasonable searches and seizures. Thus, government employers 
ordinarily cannot conduct a search without individualized suspicion—that is, without 
probable cause. Certain exceptions, however, have been recognized in cases involving 
such issues as safety, national security, and athletic participation. Remember that the 
U.S. Constitution protects citizens from the government, not from private-sector 
 employers (with limited exceptions).

Legalizing Marijuana . . . in the Workplace?
Colorado and Washington have legalized the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana 
for personal use. Although marijuana is considered an illegal drug under the federal Con-
trolled Substance Act, the U.S. Department of Justice announced in August 2013 that “at 
this time,” the federal government was, “deferring its right to challenge” the laws passed 
by Colorado and Washington, given that both states had promised to create a “strict regula-
tory system.”
Question
What impact might these laws have on Colorado and Washington employers’ drug-testing 
policies and practices? Explain.

January 1, 2014 [www.washingtonpost.com/politics/marijuana-sales-commence-in-colorado-for-recreational

2. State constitutions. Many state constitutions offer privacy protection, but court deci-
sions, to date, have generally not extended those protections to private-sector employ-
ers. On the other hand, certain states, such as California and Massachusetts, explicitly 
offer constitutional protection to private-sector employees.
3. Federal statutes. Drug testing could violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or the 
Americans with Disabilities Act (see Chapter 13) if the testing fails to treat all individuals 
equally. The ADA protects recovering drug addicts and those erroneously believed to be 
drug abusers, but not employees or applicants who are currently abusing drugs.
4. State and local statutes. Historically, most state and local drug-testing legislation 
placed limits on that testing, but in recent years, fears about drug use in the workplace 
and often intense business community lobbying have, in some cases, relaxed those test-
ing restraints.
5. Common law claims. Some of the more prominent judge-made (common law) claims 
that might provide a challenge to drug testing include invasion of privacy, defamation 
(dissemination of erroneous information about an employee), negligence (in testing or 
in selecting a test provider), intentional infliction of emotional distress, and wrongful 
discharge (discussed later in this chapter).
Part Six—Employee Benefits and Income Maintenance
In recent years, employee benefits have been the subject of political debate and legislative 
action, and the object of employers’ reactions to an uncertain economy.77 For example, in 
the last five years as health insurance costs rose, the number of workplace wellness 

532  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 initiatives—discussed previously in this chapter—also increased. During the economic 
downturn, one-third of employers reported reducing the scope of health care benefits or 
increasing cost-sharing, although the number of employers offering health care benefits 
actually increased.78 The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA; collo-
quially labeled Obamacare), which became effective in 2014, has raised concerns that 
employers’ decisions to provide health insurance coverage will be negatively impacted. 
However, as discussed below, surveys throw into question the actual impact of the ACA 
on employers’ practices. 
 
Notably, the number of Americans without health insurance dropped in recent years. 
This increase in coverage has been attributed to government programs.79
 
Under the ACA, which became effective in 2014,  employers with 50 or more employ-
ees that do not provide affordable health insurance coverage for their employees will face 
penalties. Those with fewer than 50 employees that do not provide health insurance will 
not face a penalty, but are eligible for tax credits. Critics argue that this amounts to a man-
date for larger employers to provide health insurance for their  employees in order to avoid 
paying penalties, or contrarily, to provide an incentive for employers for whom health care 
costs outweigh the penalties. A 2013 survey by the International Foundation of Employee 
Benefit Plans found that 69 percent of employers planned to continue their health care 
coverage after ACA became effective in 2014; an increase from the 46 percent of employ-
ers in 2012 that intended to do so.80 A 3 to 4 percent increase in costs are typically antici-
pated.81 These numbers could be viewed either as a sign that some employers will opt out 
of health insurance, or as evidence that most employers will still offer health care plans 
under the ACA. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a constitutional challenge to the 
ACA, holding that the individual penalties under ACA could be deemed as a tax, which 
Congress has the power to levy.82 [For more information on ACA, see https://www
.healthcare.gov/]
 
The federal Consolidated Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) requires employers 
with 20 or more employees to permit departing employees to retain group health coverage 
at their own expense for up to 18 months as long as they are not terminated for gross mis-
conduct.
 
Unfortunately, COBRA policies are often too expensive for workers who have lost their 
jobs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides health benefit premium 
reductions for those who were involuntarily unemployed within a particular time frame.83
 
Along with health care, another pressing social issue affecting the workplace is the care of 
children and elderly parents: 29 percent of adults in the United States are caregivers to an el-
derly parent or child with special needs. They provide care an average of 20 hours per week. 
 Approximately three-fourths of these caregivers work outside the home while caregiving, and 
an increasing number of them report having to make workplace accommodations.84
Family Leave
The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) entitles eligible employees of covered 
 employers to take job-protected, unpaid leave for certain family-related or medical reasons. 
Eligible employees are entitled to 12 weeks of FMLA leave in a 12-month period for the 

Chapter Twelve  Employment Law I: Employee Rights  533
Work Abroad?
Of the 38 countries represented in a 2013 study, the United States stood alone as a nation 
not mandating paid leave for new mothers. In comparison, Estonia offers about 2 years of 
paid leave, and Hungary and Lithuania offer 1½ years or more of fully paid leave. The 
median amount of fully paid time off available to a mother for the birth of a child is about 
5 to 6 months. In most countries providing paid leave, the government pays the bill.

birth, adoption, or foster care placement of a child, to care for a child, spouse, or parent 
who has a serious medical condition, or for the employee’s own serious medical condition. 
Employees taking leave are entitled to reinstatement to the same or equivalent job. 
 Employers with 50 or more employees are covered by FMLA. The 2008 National Defense 
Authorization Act (NDAA) amended FMLA to provide military family leave to eligible 
employees to care for their spouse, child, or parent who is undergoing medical treatment 
for a serious injury or illness incurred in the line of duty, or for “qualifying exigencies” 
including child care and counseling arising from their spouse’s, child’s, or parent’s call to 
active duty status from the military reserves.85 However, under a 2012 U.S. Supreme Court 
decision, state workers who are denied sick leave cannot sue the states that employ them 
under the FMLA.86
 
Although most worksites are not covered by the FMLA, over half of American employ-
ees are eligible for its protections, reflecting the FMLA’s coverage of larger workplaces.87 
Lost wages often make FMLA leave unattractive; however, approximately two-thirds of 
employees taking FMLA leave receive either full or partial pay, typically by using paid 
vacation leave, sick leave, or other forms of paid time off.88 Employers in California, New 
Jersey, and Rhode Island must provide paid family and medical leave; all three states fund 
these programs through employee-paid payroll taxes.89 The State of Washington passed 
such legislation but, at this writing, has indefinitely postponed its implementation.90 [For 
more on the FMLA, see www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/]
Unemployment Compensation
The tragedy of the Great Depression, when up to 25 percent of the workforce was unem-
ployed, led in 1935 to the passage of the Social Security Act, one portion of which pro-
vided for an unemployment insurance program. Today, all 50 states and the federal 
government are engaged in a cooperative system that helps protect the temporarily jobless. 
The system is financed through a payroll tax paid by employers.
 
The actual state tax rate for each employer varies, depending on the employer’s experience 
ratings—the number of layoffs in its workforce. Thus, employers have an incentive to 
retain employees.

534  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 
Rules vary by state, but in general, employees qualify for unemployment benefits by 
 reaching a specified total of annual wages. Those losing their jobs must apply to a state agency 
for unemployment compensation, which varies by state. Benefits may be collected up to a 
specified maximum period, usually 26 weeks. During that time, those collecting compensation 
must be ready to work and must make an effort to find suitable work. Workers who quit or who 
are fired for misconduct are ineligible for unemployment compensation. The episodes that 
 follow illustrate the improbable cases where compensation has been denied:
• The Swiss Valley Farms dairy worker who led her coworkers in an after-hours swim in 
the cheese vat (filled with water at the time).91
• The on-patrol police officer who was charged with having sex with a woman multiple 
times, sometimes in parking lots.92
• The 25-year-old Sheraton hotel worker who used her employer’s computer to write a 
300-page manuscript describing her successful efforts to avoid doing any work.93
 
On a sobering note, 1.8 million adults and 620,000 children would have fallen below 
the poverty line in 2012 without unemployment insurance.94
WARN
The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) requires firms with 100 
or more employees to provide 60 days notice if they lay off one-third or more of their 
workers at any site employing at least 150 workers, drop 500 employees at any site, or 
close a plant employing at least 50 workers. A General Accounting Office study con-
cluded, however, that the law had been ineffectual, with half of plant closings not covered 
by the law.
Pensions
A 2014 survey revealed that although Americans have recovered 
some of their confidence about retirement that were at record lows 
in recent years, nearly a quarter of American workers are not at all 
confident in their ability to retire.95 Confidence was strongly corre-
lated with participation in retirement plans.96
Broadly, pensions take two forms: defined benefit plans and 
 defined contribution plans. Defined benefit pensions are of the 
 traditional form providing specified monthly payments upon retirement. Although many 
workers have lost those pensions in recent years, some 40 million Americans remain 
protected by defined  benefit plans.97 Defined contribution plans, such as the popular 
401(k), specify in advance the “match” the employer will provide to go with the em-
ployee’s own contributions. The employee is offered a menu of investment options for 
that retirement money, but no promises are made about the amount that will be paid 
upon retirement. Defined contribution plans are now much more common than defined 
benefit plans. Defined contribution plans can be attractive to employees because the 
money vests (the point at which the  employee has a nonforfeitable right to the funds)

Chapter Twelve  Employment Law I: Employee Rights  535
quickly and follows the  employee who changes jobs. From the employer’s point of view, 
the defined contribution plans are less expensive to manage, and they shift the risk from 
employer to employee.
 
Various hybrid pension plans have also been developed. A particularly prominent 
 hybrid, a cash balance plan, is a defined benefit plan that acts somewhat like a defined 
contribution plan.The employer makes regular, defined contributions and guarantees a 
benefit amount to employees based on an established formula, but the benefits are main-
tained in individual accounts and are expressed in terms of an accumulated lump sum, a 
cash balance, rather than as a periodic payment during retirement. All of the investment 
risk in cash balance plans remains with the employer.98 [See www.401khelpcenter.com 
and www.ebri.org for large databases on 401(k) and other retirement topics.]
Pension Law The federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regulates 
pension funds to help ensure their long-term financial security by reducing fraud and 
 mismanagement. ERISA requires that fund managers keep detailed records, engage in 
 prudent investments, and provide an annual report that has been certified by qualified, 
impartial third parties. ERISA also establishes strict vesting rights to ensure that  employees 
actually receive the pensions to which they are entitled. Employer contributions typically 
vest after three years or in a six-year, graduated system. The Pension Benefit Guaranty 
Corporation (PBGC), funded by company contributions, was created as an element of ER-
ISA to insure defined benefit plans so that vested persons will be paid up to a specified 
maximum if their plan cannot meet its obligations. Defined contribution arrangements are 
not covered by the PBGC.
 
Fears that companies were not sufficiently funding their traditional pension plans led 
to provisions in the federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 requiring companies to more 
 adequately fund those plans. However, recent studies found pension funds are seriously 
underfunded, with less than three-quarters of the money needed to meet their 
 obligations.99
 
Now millions of Americans depend on their own investment wisdom and the reliability 
of their 40l(k) plan for their retirement security. In 2012, the Department of Labor issued 
disclosure guidelines designed to assist employees in managing and investing their 401(k) 
plans.100 In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court strengthened that oversight a bit by finding that 
retirement account holders can sue if the administrator of their plan fails to follow their 
investment instructions. On the other hand, in 2010 the Court extended the deference given 
to plan administrators’ discretion to include a plan administrator whose first attempt at in-
terpreting the plan had already been ruled unreasonable.101
 
In 2011, the Court reviewed a district court’s ruling in a class action brought by Cigna 
employees alleging their employer deceived them in statements made about its pension 
plan. The lower court had determined the employer had modified the plan’s terms under 
which benefits should be calculated through affirmative misstatements to employees. In a 
decision hailed by both federal regulators and employers, the Court vacated the district 
court’s ruling, finding that plan participants can sue to enforce but not modify a plan’s 
terms, but also sending the case back to the lower court to determine whether a remedy 
could be found under another ERISA provision. On remand, the district court ordered 
 enforcement of a reformed plan.102

The Future? Employer-provided pension and health care benefits for retirees increas-
ingly are at risk. As expenses, including pensions and health care, continue to rise, can 
American companies compete successfully with lower-cost foreign 
competition? Will the social constructions of “the good life” and the 
“golden years” be altered, and how? Will you need to work years 
longer than your parents?
Part Seven—Termination: Protection from Wrongful Discharge
Catherine Wagenseller, an Arizona nurse, her boss, Kay Smith, and some coworkers joined 
a Colorado River rafting trip where Wagenseller declined to participate in a “Moon River” 
skit in which the group allegedly “mooned” the  audience. Likewise, 
Wagenseller did not join Smith in the heavy drinking, “grouping up,” 
public urination, and similar behaviors that allegedly marked the trip. 
Despite favorable job evaluations preceding the trip,  Wagenseller’s 
relationship with Smith deteriorated following the trip, and eventually 
she was terminated. Wagenseller, an at-will  employee, sued, claiming that she was wrong-
fully discharged. An at-will employee, by definition, is not under contract for a definite pe-
riod of time, and as such can be fired at any time. Wagenseller, however, argued that Arizona 
should adopt the public policy exception to the at-will doctrine. She claimed that she was 
fired because she refused to engage in behaviors that might have violated the Arizona inde-
cent exposure statute. The state Supreme Court agreed with  Wagenseller by finding in the 
statute a public policy favoring privacy and decency. The case was returned to the trial level, 
giving Wagenseller the opportunity to prove that her refusal to violate state public policy by 
engaging in public indecency led to her dismissal.103
 
The Wagenseller decision is an exception to the long-standing American rule that 
 at-will employees can be fired for good reasons, bad reasons, or no reason at all. Of course, 
the employee is likewise free to quit at any time. Furthermore, both employer and  employee 
freely entered the bargain understanding its terms, and thus the court should, in general, 
enforce those terms. Critics, however, argue that the doctrine ignores the historic  inequality 
of bargaining power between employers and employees. In recent decades the at-will rule 
has been softened in most states by legislative and judicially imposed limitations. Statutory 
exceptions to the at-will rule include our labor laws protecting union workers 
(see  Chapter 14) and the equal employment opportunity laws that forbid the dismissal of 
an employee for discriminatory reasons (see Chapter 13).
Judicial Limitations on At-Will Principles
An increasing number of court decisions provide grounds for dismissed at-will  employees 
to claim that they have been wrongfully discharged. Those judicial decisions were often 
provoked by transparently unjust dismissals including, for example, whistle-blowers who 
exposed their employers’ misdeeds and employees who declined to commit perjury on

Chapter Twelve  Employment Law I: Employee Rights  537
behalf of their employers. Those judicial limitations to the at-will doctrine fall into three 
categories: (1) express or implied contracts, (2) an implied  covenant of good faith and fair 
dealing, and (3) the tort of violating an established public policy, as in Wagenseller. 
 Additional tort claims may substitute for or supplement wrongful  discharge claims.
1. Express or implied employment contracts. A number of states have adopted a con-
tractual protection for at-will employees arising, typically, either from the employee 
handbook or from the employer’s conduct and oral representations. For example, an 
employee handbook might contain a policy expecting employees to arrive on time to 
start their shift, and describing the progressive discipline tardy employees will face—
such as an oral warning the first time they are late, a written warning for a second late 
arrival, and other discipline up to dismissal for continued incidents. This policy creates 
a contract that employees will not be terminated the first, or even second, time they ar-
rive late to work. Similarly, oral assurances of continued employment, or an employer’s 
practice of providing mentorship to rehabilitate employees’ poor performance rather 
than firing them may create contracts that protect at-will employees from termination.
2. Implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. A few state courts have held that 
neither party to a contract may act in bad faith to deprive the other of the benefits of the 
contract. For example, Bruce Rubenstein gave up his job with Arbor Mortgage to take 
an at-will position with Huntington Mortgage with the understanding that he would be 
manager of a new branch office to be opened in central New Jersey. After a few weeks, 
however, Huntington decided on a downsizing strategy under which the new branch 
would not be opened. Rubenstein was offered a job as a Huntington loan originator, but 
he declined. He sued Huntington asserting, among other things, that Huntington had 
breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Reubenstein believed that 
 Huntington knew of the possibility of downsizing before hiring him. The court agreed 
that Rubenstein may have had a viable claim for breach of the  implied covenant of good 
faith and fair dealing if the facts, at trial, proved to be as Rubenstein alleged.104
3. Public policy. Most states have now adopted some form of “public policy” exception to 
at-will employment, under which a dismissal is wrongful if it results from  employee 
conduct that is consistent with a public good or the public interest as  expressed in legis-
lation, constitutional protections, and the like. These exceptions are established case by 
case, and may differ from state to state. In addition to reporting an employer’s illegal 
activity, commonly known as “whistle-blowing,” or refusing to commit an  illegal act 
such as perjury, the exception often protects, for example, employees fired for pursuing 
a lawful claim against their employer (e.g., workers’ compensation or wage claims) as 
well as those fired for fulfilling a civic responsibility such as jury duty.
Only Funny until Someone Quits: The Firing Contest 
The owner of a chain of QC Mart convenience stores in Bettendorf, Iowa, offered a $10 
cash prize to workers who could predict which of them would be the next to be fired. A 
memo distributed to all employees asked them to write down and seal in an envelope the 
name of the coworker they thought would be fired next. The owner explained that secret 

538  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
shoppers would visit the store to see which cashiers were committing such offenses as 
wearing a hat, talking on a cell phone, and not wearing a QC Mart shirt. Once a firing oc-
curred, the contest would begin again. After receiving the memo, QC Mart cashier Misty 
Shelsky, along with her store manager and a few other employees, quit. When Shelsky 
applied for unemployment benefits, the owner challenged the claim, asserting that she had 
left the job voluntarily. As defined by the Department of Labor, a constructive discharge 
(treated as a termination) occurs when a worker’s resignation may be found not to be vol-
untary because the employer has created a hostile or intolerable work environment or has 
applied other forms of pressure or coercion which forced the employee to quit or resign. 
Should Shelsky be viewed as a terminated employee? Decide. Explain.

to her that he and Kane were fighting. Lloyd ordered Joseph to 
release Kane. After Lloyd’s second command, Joseph did so. 
Joseph suddenly made a 180-degree turn and lunged toward 
Lloyd with his fists raised to his chest and “an angry look on 
his face.” Lloyd feared for his own safety and pepper sprayed 
Joseph. Smith reached for his pepper spray at the same time 
and would have sprayed Joseph if Lloyd had not done so first. 
Another Drake security guard, Sergeant Risvold, attempted to 
handcuff Joseph, but was unable to do so—Joseph was still 
writhing from the pepper spray. Lloyd hit Joseph on the thigh 
with his baton, forcing him to the ground.
 
Des Moines police officers took Joseph to the police sta-
tion, where he was charged with disorderly conduct. Mean-
while, witnesses began screaming “racist, racist” at Lloyd. 
Students immediately discussed the incident with Drake’s

FACTS
Nicholas Lloyd was a Drake University security guard on duty 
at the annual Drake Relays street-painting event on April 20, 
2002. A student told Lloyd about an apparent altercation be-
tween Philippe Joseph, a Drake football player, and Erin Kane. 
Lloyd and Kane were white; Joseph was black. Joseph was 
holding Kane in the air with her feet kicking. Lloyd and another 
security guard, Steven Smith, thought Joseph was holding 
Kane in a headlock. Although Kane later claimed she and 
 Joseph were just friends engaged in horseplay, Lloyd alleges 
Joseph’s girlfriend called Lloyd and said Joseph had admitted

Additional Torts Dismissed employees are increasingly turning to a variety of tort actions 
often labeled “tag-along torts”— seeking compensatory and punitive damages to enhance 
their potential financial recovery. Potential tort claims arising from termination include, 
among others, defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, interference with 
contract, and invasion of privacy. The following case raises public policy issues in an 
 employment termination.

Chapter Twelve  Employment Law I: Employee Rights  539
president, David Maxwell. Maxwell obtained Joseph’s release 
and took him for medical treatment, even though he had not 
previously complained about any injuries resulting from the ar-
rest. Joseph later pled guilty to disturbing the peace. He also 
received a settlement from Drake.
 
As local media reported on the street-painting episode, 
Lloyd’s actions became the subject of a heated controversy. 
After the NAACP and Black Student Coalition demanded an 
investigation, Drake organized a panel to study the incident 
and related topics. The panel concluded Lloyd had overre-
acted and used unnecessary force. Although the panel deter-
mined Lloyd’s actions at the street-painting event were not 
overtly racially motivated, the panel discovered some prior 
complaints against Lloyd involving minority students. (Lloyd, 
however, points out he was never reprimanded on any of 
those occasions.) The panel also criticized Drake for insuffi-
ciently training its security guards and its “ambiguous philoso-
phy for security.” During the investigation, Drake assigned 
Lloyd to a desk job. Maxwell assured Lloyd he would not lose 
his job. One of Lloyd’s supervisors told Lloyd he was still in line 
for a promotion. Nonetheless, Drake fired Lloyd from his secu-
rity position on June 16, 2002. . . .
WRONGFUL DISCHARGE
Lloyd does not dispute he was an at-will employee. As a 
 consequence, Drake could fire him for any lawful reason, or 
for no reason at all. A discharge is not lawful, however, when 
it violates public policy. Lloyd claims Drake violated public 
policy and thereby committed the tort of wrongful discharge 
when it fired him simply for upholding the criminal laws, i.e., 
 attempting to arrest Joseph, a man he thought was assaulting 
a student.
 
The district court dismissed Lloyd’s wrongful-discharge 
claim. . . . ruling Drake had fired Lloyd for a variety of other 
lawful reasons, including (1) a desire to capitulate to outside 
pressures in the hopes of forestalling a lack of public confi-
dence in Drake’s security system; and (2) a determination—
based upon newly rediscovered prior complaints and the 
panel’s conclusion Lloyd used premature and excessive 
force in subduing Joseph—that Lloyd lacked the appropriate 
demeanor of a security guard. (On appeal, Drake also points 
out Lloyd’s conduct affected its relationships with a variety 
of constituencies, and his retention could have cost it essen-
tial financial support.) . . . We take a different route than the 
district court, but reach the same conclusion. . . . Even 
 assuming Lloyd was fired simply for upholding the law, we 
think his claim still fails because the public policy against 
discharge that Lloyd asserts is neither clearly defined nor 
well recognized.
 
. . . [I]n order to prevail on his wrongful-discharge claim 
Lloyd must first identify a clearly defined and well-recognized 
public policy that would be undermined by his dismissal. . . . 
Only such policies are weighty enough “to overcome the 
 employer’s interest in operating its business in the manner it 
sees fit,” which we have long and vigorously protected. Over 
the years we have recognized a number of clearly defined 
public policies. . . . To date, however, we have not held that a 
private security guard’s actions in “enforcing the criminal 
laws of the state” to be a well-recognized and clearly defined 
public policy.
 
. . . [Lloyd’s] argument mostly consists of vague generaliza-
tions about the social desirability of upholding the criminal 
laws of the state. . . . Lloyd also points out that there need not 
be an express statutory prohibition against discharge to un-
derpin the public policy. In a number of cases, we have “found 
an implied prohibition against retaliatory discharge based on 
an employee’s exercise of a right conferred by a clearly artic-
ulated legislative enactment.” The gist of Lloyd’s argument is 
that because upholding the criminal laws is important and so-
cially desirable conduct, this court should find a public-policy 
exception to the at-will employment doctrine for a private se-
curity guard who tried to effectuate an arrest of a suspected 
criminal.
 
Lloyd’s argument is not well taken. We have little quarrel, 
however, with one of the basic premises of Lloyd’s argument: 
namely, that the criminal laws of the state reflect a general 
public policy against crime, and in favor of the protection of 
the public. That said, the public policy asserted here is far too 
generalized to support an argument for an exception to the at-
will doctrine. In short, the public policy is not clearly defined. 
Apart from a vague reference to the whole of the criminal law, 
Lloyd cites no statutory or constitutional provision to buttress 
his claim. Divorced from any such provision or equivalent 
 expression of public policy, we cannot find a well-recognized 
and clearly defined public policy in such vague  generalizations. 
“Any effort to evaluate the public policy exception with gener-
alized concepts of fairness and justice will result in an elimina-
tion of the at-will doctrine itself.”
* * * * *
[W]e can find no origin for the well-recognized and clearly 
defined public policy essential to carve out an exception to 
the at-will employment doctrine. There is nothing, then, to 
sustain the tort of wrongful discharge on these facts— 
however encouraged or frequently beneficial it may be to 
have private citizens take it upon themselves to enforce the 
criminal laws. . . . The point is simply this: while we might be 
persuaded that society would be better off if private  security

personnel investigated and attempted to stop crimes in pro-
gress, we are not convinced it is a clear and well-recognized 
public policy of this state “that we all  become citizen crime 
fighters.”

3. Schuster worked, in an at-will relationship, for Derocili for 
15 months, during which time she claims he touched her 
inappropriately and made numerous sexual comments de-
spite her repeated rejections of those behaviors. Schuster 
received bonuses and good evaluations, but in a meeting 
between Schuster, Derocili, and Schuster’s direct supervi-
sor, Goff, she was fired for poor performance. Schuster’s 
sexual harassment complaint with the Delaware Depart-
ment of Labor was rejected as unsubstantiated. She sued 
Derocili for breach of contract, but the trial court dismissed 
that complaint. She appealed.
 
a.  Does Schuster have a legitimate wrongful discharge 
claim? Explain.
 
b.  Does she have any other plausible causes of action? 
Explain. See Schuster v. Derocili, 775 A.2d 1029 (Del.

4. In 2004, Touchstone Television Productions hired Nicollette 
Sheridan to play Edie Britt in the television series Desper-
ate Housewives. Touchstone’s agreement with Sheridan 
gave it the exclusive option to renew her services on an 
annual basis for up to an additional six seasons; Touch-
stone exercised this option for seasons 2 through 5. In 
 February 2009, Touchstone informed the actress that it 
would not exercise its option for season 6, and that Edie 
Britt would be killed in a car accident during season 5. 
Sheridan alleged that Touchstone’s decision was moti-
vated by her complaint regarding a September 2008 inci-
dent in which Marc Cherry, the show’s creator, allegedly 
hit her,  amounting to a wrongful termination in breach of 
public policy. Decide. Explain. Touchstone Television Prod.

5. IBP operated a large hog-processing plant in Storm Lake, 
Iowa. IBP prohibited possession of “look-alike drugs” on 
company property. An employee, Michael Huegerich, was 
randomly and lawfully inspected as he was entering the 
plant. The inspection revealed an asthma medication, 
Maxalert, which was identical in appearance to an illegal 
street drug, “speed.” Maxalert contained the stimulant 
ephedrine. The pills actually  belonged to his girlfriend and 
were in his possession by accident. Huegerich was termi-
nated for possessing a look-alike drug in violation of com-
pany policy. Huegerich admitted that he was generally 
aware of IBP drug policies, but since he was a transfer 
from another IBP division, he had not gone through the 
company orientation program where new employees were 
advised of the policy against look-alike drugs. About 
six months after his dismissal, two IBP employees told 
Huegerich that they had heard he was fired for possessing 
speed. Huegerich then sued IBP for, among other claims, 
wrongful discharge and defamation.
 
 
At trial, Huegerich provided no evidence as to how, 
when, and from whom the IBP employees had heard that he 
was terminated for possession of speed. The district court 
found for Huegerich in the amount of $24,000 on the wrong-
ful discharge claim and $20,000 on the defamation claim. 
The court said that IBP was guilty of negligent discharge in 
failing to inform Huegerich about its drug policy. IBP ap-
pealed to the Iowa Supreme Court. Iowa law recognizes the 
doctrine of at-will employment with “narrow” exceptions 
for public policy violations and where a contract is created 
by an employer’s handbook. Decide. Explain. See  Huegerich 
v. IBP, 547 N.W.2d 216 (Iowa S.Ct. 1996).

interference with contract, and negligent infliction of 
emotional distress. Decide. Explain. See Freeman v.

Kevin Lamson was a sales manager for an Oregon car 
dealership, Crater Lake Motors. Crater Lake hired Real 
Performance Marketing Company (RPM), to conduct a 
five-day sales promotion at the dealership. During the first 
few days of the sales event, Lamson observed or was in-
formed of a number of activities that he considered to be 
unethical and possibly unlawful, such as misrepresenting 
the event as a bank sale, and including various insurance 
and service agreements in the sales contract without the 
knowledge of the customer. Lamson complained to the 
Crater Lake Motors General Manager, Shevlin, who told 
him to “just go home.” The next week, Lamson again ex-
pressed his concerns at a Crater Lake Motors meeting.
 
About a month later, Shevlin criticized Lamson’s atti-
tude and recent performance, stating that Lamson “wasn’t 
getting the job done.” Shevlin also told Lamson of another 
planned RPM sales event, and asked if Lamson intended to 
quit. Lamson replied that he did not intend to quit but that it 
seemed like Shevlin did not want him to work at Crater 
Lake Motors anymore. Shevlin replied that he did not want 
the Lamson he had seen recently.
 
Lamson later complained to the Crater Lake Motors 
owner, Coleman, about RPM. Coleman told Lamson that 
working at the second RPM event was mandatory and that 
failure to attend could result in dismissal. Lamson told 
Coleman that he could not participate because doing so 
would condone unethical behavior. Coleman said the 
agreement with RPM had been amended to explicitly 
 forbid misrepresentations. Lamson did not attend the 
 second RPM event, and was fired. Lamson then sued 
 Crater Lake Motors for wrongful discharge.
Questions
1. Was Crater Lake Motors wrong to hire RPM?
2. Was Lamson wrong to refuse to work at the second 
RPM event?
3. Did Lamson have a duty to complain about the conduct 
he had observed during the first RPM event?
4. Was Crater Lake wrong to terminate Lamson?
5. Who won the wrongful termination lawsuit?

Hearing the Whistle Blow?
Part Eight—Immigration
Immigration is a vital fuel for America’s economic and cultural growth, but immigration is 
also a source of deep political and public policy divisions. In 2010, Arizona became the 
focus of this debate when it passed an aggressive piece of legislation requiring police 
 officers to make a reasonable attempt to determine the immigration status of anyone 
 lawfully stopped, detained, or arrested whom they suspect might be in the United States 
illegally.105 While striking down other provisions of the law, including one making it a 
crime for immigrants without work permits to seek employment, the U.S. Supreme Court 
allowed the controversial section regarding immigration status checks by police to stand.106
 
In 2011, Alabama enacted a law that encompassed many of the 2010 Arizona provi-
sions but was more broadly restrictive in that it, for example, required public schools to 
check the immigration status of their students, and made it a crime for landlords to 
 knowingly rent to, harbor, or transport a known unauthorized (“illegal”) immigrant. After 
the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on the Arizona legislation, a federal appellate court 
blocked the Alabama law; the Court declined to hear Alabama’s appeal.107 The outcomes 
of these cases underscore that federal immigration policy trumps state efforts on this issue 
under the U.S. Constitution’s Supremacy Clause. (see Chapters 5 and 8).

One in eight people living in the United States is an immigrant 
(about 40 million), and immigration has steadily grown over the last 
decade. From 2007 to 2012, the number of immigrants living in the 
United States increased by 2.4 million.108 In 2012, illegal immi-
grants in the United States totaled about 11.7 million.109
 
Immigration policy is one of the most divisive issues in American public life. A Pew 
poll showed that 59 percent of Americans approved of the 2010 Arizona measure.110 The 
support for directing police to stop and ask for documentation from those reasonably 
 suspected of being in the United States illegally might reflect resistance to immigration 
generally, and the perception that illegal immigrants create an economic burden. Further-
more, concerns about the negative impact of large legal and illegal immigrant populations 
on low-income Americans have been raised.111 However, immigrants to California appear 
to drive wages up.112 A group of 500 economists wrote to Congress in 2006 arguing that 
immigration yields a “modest” net gain for the American  economy.113 In a more subjective 
sense, advocates claim that we must benefit from  immigration’s steady pipeline of new 
talent and energy which includes thousands of  unaccompanied young children, many of 
whom literally walk to the United States from Central America.114 The Los Angeles Times 
asked if America’s “sheltered and chaperoned children” could manage that feat on their 
own.115
American Immigration Law Businesses in the United States have used the H-1B visa 
program to bring foreign workers to the United States to fill positions requiring special 
theoretical or technical expertise in specialized fields such as science, engineering, or com-
puter programming. In seeking an H-1B visa, an employer must affirm to the U.S. Depart-
ment of Labor that the hiring will not harm wages and working conditions of employees in 
similar jobs. The number of H-1B visas available annually is limited, and after a decline in 
2009 in which it took eight months for the H-1B cap to be met, in 2012 it took just over 
two months for the 2013 slots to be filled.116
 
In hiring those already in the United States, federal immigration law, including the 1986 
Immigration Reform and Control Act, requires employers to verify that each new hire is a 
U.S. citizen, a permanent resident, or a foreign national with permission to work in this 
country. To meet this requirement, employers must complete an employment eligibility 
verification form (I–9) for each new employee. New employees must present documents 
establishing the employee’s identity and eligibility to work in the United States. The 
 employer must  examine the documents and complete the I–9 if the documents appear 
 legitimate. Of course, employers cannot knowingly hire illegal immigrants, but neither can 
they discriminate against legal immigrants because of national origin and similar factors. 
[For links to the I–9 form and other immigration information, see www.uscis.gov/portal
/site/uscis]
Enforcement Enforcement of immigration laws focuses on two issues: hiring of illegal 
immigrants, and employers’ illegal discrimination against applicants based on citizenship 
status or national origin. Critics charge that these policies create a conflict for employers: 
on the one hand, employers must be sure to verify applicants’ ability to work in the United 
States, but on the other hand, they must take care not to place extra burdens on applicants 
Illegal immigrants total about 
11.7 million.

Chapter Twelve  Employment Law I: Employee Rights  543
because they are of a particular national origin, or are U.S. permanent residents as opposed 
to U.S. citizens.117 For example, under a settlement reached with the U.S. Department of 
Justice, a California company, American Education and Travel Services Inc., agreed to pay 
$10,000 in back pay and compensatory damages to a lawful permanent resident who was 
denied a residential counselor position because he was not a U.S. citizen or native English 
speaker.118 At the same time, the Obama administration’s use of immigration audits, rather 
than Bush-era workplace raids, has led to illegal immigrants being fired.  In 2011, for ex-
ample, fast-food chain Chipotle fired hundreds of illegal immigrants as a result of an audit 
by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.119
 
E-Verify is a free online system run by the federal government that determines an 
 employee’s eligibility to work in the United States, comparing information reported on an 
employee’s Form I-9 with federal records. Since 2009, the federal government mandates 
certain federal contractors to use the program. Approximately 20 states required the use of 
E-Verify for at least some employers.120 In 2013, over 480,000 employers were enrolled in 
E-Verify, with over 23 million queries.121 However, critics note that E-Verify does not ad-
dress whether the identity provided is  authentic, which could encourage identity theft to 
help illegal workers clear this employment hurdle.122 [For overviews of many of the em-

where he showed them the semiautomatic pistol he had stored in his vehicle. On April 29, 
2009, the university terminated Mitchell’s employment for violation of its policy prohib-
iting possession of a deadly weapon on university property or while conducting univer-
sity business. Mitchell filed suit, alleging termination in violation of public policy. 
Decide. Explain. See Mitchell v. University of Kentucky, 366 S.W.3d 895 (Ky. 2012).
12. A reader sent the following story to a newspaper question and answer forum:
I was fired recently by my employer, an architecture firm, immediately after serving 
for one month on a federal grand jury. From the moment I informed my boss . . . I was 
harassed . . . and told I was not putting the company first. I was told to get out of my 
jury service, “or else.” . . . I was fired exactly one week after my service ended.123
 
 Was the dismissal of this at-will employee lawful? Explain.

546  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
13. Katherine Born and Rick Gillispie were employed by a Blockbuster Video store in 
Iowa. Blockbuster maintained a policy that forbade dating between supervisors and 
their subordinates. Born and Gillispie were dismissed for violating the policy. They 
denied that they were romantically involved and filed suit for wrongful dismissal. 
 Under Iowa law, an at-will employee can be discharged at any time for any reason, but 
Iowa law does recognize the public policy exception. To prevail in this lawsuit, what 
must the plaintiffs show about Iowa law? See Katherine Born and Rick Gillispie v. 
Blockbuster Videos, Inc., 941 F.Supp. 868 (S.D. Ia. 1996).
14. Dancers at Club Orleans in Topeka, Kansas, who earned only tips without a regu-
lar wage, were subject to house rules that prohibited illicit or illegal conduct and 
regulated interaction among the dancers and between the dancers and customers. 
Violations of the rules could result in the dancer being fined or terminated. The 
rules also set minimum tips for various types of dances, which were enforced. The 
dancers were allowed to schedule their own shifts. One of the dancers filed an 
unemployment benefits claim against Milano’s, the company that owned Club 
Orleans. Is the dancer an employee or an independent contractor? Decide. Explain. 
See Milano’s v. Kansas Department of Labor, 296 Kan. 497 (KS 2013). 
15. Diana Vail, who received medical treatment for migraine headaches, worked at 
 Raybestos, a car parts manufacturer. Raybestos had been giving Vail intermittent 
leave under FMLA for her migrane headaches since April 2004. From May to 
 September 2005, Vail’s  requests for FMLA leave due to migraine headaches 
 became more frequent, often  falling on weekdays when her husband’s mowing 
company was busiest. Growing  suspicious that Vail’s requests were not genuine, 
Raybestos monitored Vail’s activities by hiring an off-duty police officer to con-
duct video surveillance. The officer reported that Vail mowed the lawns of a cem-
etery, her husband’s client, on a day when Vail called prior to her shift to request 
leave. Vail was subsequently terminated based on her performance of physical 
 labor while on FMLA.
a. Did Vail’s termination violate FMLA? Explain.
b. Did the employer’s surveillance of Vail interfere with her rights under FMLA? 
Explain. See Vail v. Raybestos, 533 F.3d 904 (7th Cir. 2008).
c. An employee who had been on FMLA leave for incapacitating back pain posted 
photos to her Facebook page (as did her friend) showing her drinking and dancing 
over a period of at least eight hours at a local festival. Several of the employees’ 
coworkers who were her Facebook friends told management what they had seen on 
the employee’s page; the employee was fired as a result. The employee sued the 
employer for retaliation and interference with her FMLA rights. Decide. Explain. 
See Jaszczyszyn v. Advantage Health Physician Network, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 
23162 (6th Cir. 2012), unpubd. op.
16. An employee of Triple B Cleaning in Texas requested personal protective equipment 
while performing dry cleaning duties. Triple B denied the request. The employee noti-
fied the media, and after a reporter contacted the employee’s supervisor, the employee 

Chapter Twelve  Employment Law I: Employee Rights  547
was demoted and assigned menial tasks. Following the airing of the employee’s com-
plaint by local news, the employee was terminated.
 
  
After being terminated, the employee filed a whistle-blower complaint alleging that 
Triple B acted in retaliation for contacting the media about unsafe working conditions. 
OSHA investigated the complaint and determined that Triple B Cleaning’s decision to 
terminate the employee was in violation of the whistle-blower provisions of the Occu-
pational Safety and Health Act.
 
  
The company entered into a consent judgment under which it paid the employee 
$30,000 for lost wages, agreed to an injunction prohibiting future discrimination, and 
posted a notice advising its employees of their rights under OSHA’s whistle-blower 
protection provision.
a. What public policy—or policies—are at issue in this situation?
b. Did Triple B act ethically? Did the employee act ethically? Explain.
c. In OSHA’s press release regarding the settlement, OSHA Regional Administrator 
Dean McDaniel stated: “Employees should be free to exercise their rights under the 
law without fear of retaliation by their employers . . .” What consequences might be 
expected to accompany the fear of retaliation employees often feel when exercising 
their rights?

Chapter Thirteen  Employment Law II: Discrimination 555
  Introduction  
 Abercrombie & Fitch (A & F or Abercrombie), the clothing 
retailer, was accused in 2003 of maintaining a virtually all-
white image by discriminating in recruiting, hiring, and pro-
moting women and  minorities. A nationwide class-action 
lawsuit was filed claiming that  Abercrombie   disproportion-
ately assigned minority employees to stockrooms and 
other jobs out of the public eye, while white employees 
were conspicuously on display as a means of projecting 
the company’s “clean-cut, classic” image.  
 
Abercrombie denied the charges, but it decided to 
 settle in 2005 by agreeing to pay $40 million along with 
$10 million in attorney fees and other expenses. The set-
tlement also required the company to promote diversity 
in its workforce. 1 In addition, Abercrombie agreed to 
manifest a more diverse image in its marketing materi-
als, including its catalogs, shopping bags, and store 
posters. 2  
 
In September 2013, Abercrombie settled two reli-
gious discrimination lawsuits filed by the federal gov-
ernment’s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 
both involving Muslim teens who wore headscarves 
(hijabs). One teen had been terminated from her stock-
room job at Hollister for refusing to remove her hijab in 
violation of the store’s “Look Policy,” and another who 
was denied employment at an Abercrombie outlet had 
been asked about her hijab and religion during her in-
terview. Two federal judges had ruled against A & F 
prior to the settlement, under which the store paid 
$71,000 and promised to change its policies.3 However, 
the next month, a federal appellate court judge re-
versed a trial court’s ruling against  Abercrombie in a 
third religious discrimination lawsuit involving a refusal 
to hire based on the applicant’s hijab. The Court agreed 
with A & F that its “Look Policy” was necessary to 
maintain its “classic East Coast collegiate style of 
clothing.”4  
 Questions 
  1.   A & F defenders have argued that the clothier has the 
right to promote an image of its choice as a means of 
making a profit.  
 
 a.   The law aside, is Abercrombie simply wrong to project 
an image that, however it is labeled, may be described 
as a “white image” if, indeed, it does so? Explain.  
 
 b.  Would it be wrong for a store promoting a “hip hop” 
image to refuse to hire an applicant because she 
wears a hijab? How about if that store refused to 
hire a white applicant based on race? Explain.
 
c.  What if a store selling hunting and fishing gear re-
fused to hire African-American applicants for 
 cashier and sales associate positions—would that 
be wrong?  Explain. 
 2. A college student decided not to apply for a job at 
 Abercrombie because she didn’t feel “appropriate” for 
the job after she observed all of the store’s “tall, skinny 
white girls.” The college student stated that, in the long 
run, hiring only employees with that particular look will 
“hurt Abercrombie.”  5 
 
 a.  Would the market punish Abercrombie, even if the 
law had not intervened? Explain.  
 
 b.  Should the market punish Abercrombie? Put an-
other way, should you as a consumer decline to 
shop at  Abercrombie stores based on its apparent 
employment practices? Explain.  
 3.   a.  In your opinion, should an employer be able to 
 specify a reasonable dress code? 
 
b.  Do you think a “no-head coverings” policy is 
 reasonable and enforceable even if it excludes 
some religious groups from employment? Explain. 
 
c.  Under the settlement reached with the EEOC, 
 Abercrombie now allows employees to request ex-
ceptions to its dress code. Do you think this is a fair 
result? Explain.

 2060: Plurality Nation  
 The 2012 U.S. Census revealed that over one-third of Americans reported their race and eth-
nicity as “minority;” that is, something other than non-Hispanic white.  By 2060, the U.S. Cen-
sus Bureau projects that although overall population growth will slow down, this figure will 
increase to 57 percent. Although non-Hispanic whites will remain the largest part of the U.S. 
population, no one group will hold a majority, making the United States a “plurality nation.”

 Part One—Employment Discrimination: The Foundation in Law 
 History 
  In the Reconstruction Era following the Civil War, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act 
of 1866 to provide the newly freed black slaves with the same right to make and enforce 
contracts as was enjoyed by white citizens. This law still exists today, with updated 
 language emphasizing its protection against racial discrimination. The Civil Rights Act of 
1866 has been interpreted to forbid discrimination on the basis of race in employment, 
which is essentially a contractual relationship.  
   
However, this legal protection did not prevent discriminatory practices in housing, edu-
cation, business, and employment. In 1941, A. Philip Randolph, president of the 
 predominantly black Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, organized black leaders who 
threatened a massive march in Washington, DC, protesting employment discrimination. In 
 Continuing Discrimination   The ethical issues raised by Abercrombie & Fitch’s hiring and 
staffing practices highlight the challenges of enforcing legal protections against employment 
discrimination, often referred to as Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) laws.  
 
Employers compare, distinguish, and choose among applicants and employees based on 
many factors. However, EEO laws forbid those considerations that would undermine equal 
employment opportunity. Prohibited factors, also called “protected categories,” or “pro-
tected classes” include an applicant’s or employee’s race, color, and gender, among other 
characteristics. Generally, EEO laws protect all employees and are not restricted to certain 
groups such as women or racial minorities.  
 Do we still need EEO laws in the United States? Consider a recent study in which black 
and white men applied for the same entry-level jobs with nearly identical résumés. Some 
of the white men were instructed to tell the employer that they had 
felony drug convictions. Who would receive the employer’s call—
the white ex-convict or the black with no criminal record? Most 
likely, the study found, the white applicant with the criminal record 
would be preferred over the black applicant with no criminal record. 6  As diversity grows in 
the United States, EEO laws may serve to support and sustain a more inclusive, and, 
 ultimately, more productive workplace. 7 

Chapter Thirteen  Employment Law II: Discrimination 557
response, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, which created a Fair 
Employment Practice Committee. Congress limited the committee’s budget, but Roosevelt’s 
action was a striking step for the federal government in addressing racial discrimination.  
 
The next big step toward racial equality was the landmark  Brown v. Board of  Education 8 
decision in 1954, in which the Supreme Court forbade “separate but equal” schools.  Following 
 Brown , citizens engaged in sit-ins, freedom rides, boycotts, and the like to press claims for 
racial equality. It was a turbulent, sometimes violent, era, but those activities were critical 
ingredients in subsequent advances for the black population. With the passage of the 1964 
Civil Rights Act, the campaign against discrimination solidified as one of the most ener-
getic and influential social movements in American history. 9 The Civil Rights Act of 1964 
changed American life by forbidding discrimination in education, housing, public accom-
modation, and, perhaps most importantly, employment. [For the National Civil Rights 
 Museum, see  www.civilrightsmuseum.org ] 
 Civil Rights Act of 1964 
 Reflecting the increased diversity of the U.S. workforce, in which women had gone  beyond 
traditional roles and where immigrants from around the world could be found, Title VII of 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (“Title VII”) marked a new era in employment practices. Title 
VII forbids discrimination in employment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or  national 
origin. Relying on its authority to regulate commerce, Congress applied Title VII to private-
sector employers with 15 or more employees, employment agencies, labor  unions with 15 or 
more members as well as those operating a hiring hall, state and local governments, and most 
of the federal government. Private clubs are exempt from Title VII, and religious organiza-
tions may discriminate in employment on the basis of religion. Broadly, Title VII forbids 
discrimination in hiring, firing, and all aspects of the  employment relationship.  
 Other Legislation and Orders 
 Title VII is the core of EEO laws in the United States. Other federal statutes, such as the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and its 2008 amendments (ADAAA), and 
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), have established additional 
protected categories. The Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1991 address 
particular issues in employment discrimination. For example, the Civil Rights Act of 1991 
provides that U.S. citizens working abroad for American-owned or American-controlled 
companies are protected from discrimination under Title VII and the ADA unless such 
protection would require the employer to violate the laws of its host nation. Later in this 
chapter, these federal laws will be discussed further. 
 The Constitution 
 As explained in Chapter 5, the federal constitution, among other purposes, protects us from 
wrongful government action. The Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution provides that 
no state shall deny to any person life, liberty, or property without   due process of law or deny 
him or her the   equal protection of the laws . Thus, citizens are protected from discrimination 
via state government action. Similarly, the Supreme Court has interpreted the Due Process 
Clause of the Fifth Amendment (“nor shall any person . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or 
property, without due process of law”) to forbid discrimination by the federal government.

 Employment Discrimination Enforcement 
 EEOC and State Fair Employment Practice Agencies 
 The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), an independent federal agency, 
has the authority to issue regulations and guidelines as well as to receive, initiate, and 
investigate charges of discrimination against employers covered by federal antidiscrimination 
statutes such as Title VII. [See the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s website 
at  www/eeoc.gov ] 
 
State fair employment practices legislation often mirrors or expands the antidiscrimination 
protections found in federal statutes such as Title VII. State fair  employment practice agencies 
may serve the same function as the EEOC in enforcing these laws. [For an example, see 
 California Department of Fair Employment and  Housing’s website at  www.dfeh.ca.gov ] 
Municipal ordinances may also address employment discrimination,  enforced by a particular 
branch of the city’s government. [For the  San Francisco Human Rights Commission, see 
 www.sfgov.org/site/sfhumanrights_index.asp ]  
 Litigation 
 The first step in lawsuits claiming employment discrimination is not taken in a courthouse. 
A victim of employment   discrimination, usually referred to as the “charging party,” will 
file a complaint within a limited period of time with either the EEOC or, where applicable, 
the local or state fair employment practices agency. 
 
What if the allegedly discriminatory act is ongoing rather than an incident occurring on 
 a certain date—at what moment does the clock start ticking on the victim’s time to file an 
Stopping Discrimination through Corporate Pledges
In his 2014 State of the Union Address, President Obama announced that he had secured 
voluntary pledges from a number of major U.S. companies to not discriminate against ap-
plicants who are currently unemployed. In seeking employment, those who are jobless, 
particularly those who have been unemployed for a significant period of time, often face 
discrimination based on their employment status. Legislative attempts to ban such dis-
criminatory practices have met with limited success and offer narrow protections against 
express exclusions of the unemployed in help-wanted ads.
Questions
1. What are the advantages of the corporate pledge approach to protecting against emerg-
ing areas of discrimination? Explain.
2. Assume that a job applicant at one of the U.S. companies that had pledged not to dis-
criminate against the unemployed was rejected because she has been jobless for over 
two years. Would the applicant have any recourse? Explain.

Chapter Thirteen  Employment Law II: Discrimination 559
EEOC complaint? After 19 years as a Goodyear employee, Lily Ledbetter discovered that 
her wages were much lower than her male coworkers. She filed an EEOC complaint 
 alleging gender discrimination and later won a jury verdict for back pay and punitive dam-
ages. In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court held in  Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. 
that Ledbetter’s claim should have been brought within 180 days of the first paycheck at 
issue. 10 Congress reacted to Ledbetter by passing The Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, 
signed into law by President Obama in the first days of his administration. Under this 
 statute, each paycheck issued by an employer engaged in pay discrimination is a discrimi-
natory act, meaning that the clock resets on potential discrimination claim each time the 
affected employee is paid, with a two-year cap on back pay damages. 11 
   
Typically, the EEOC will refer the charging party and employer to its free mediation 
program. If mediation does not resolve the complaint, then the EEOC will investigate. If 
the investigation reveals that there is reasonable cause to believe that discrimination has 
occurred, the EEOC will invite the parties to engage in conciliation to resolve the matter. 
If conciliation fails, the EEOC either files a civil suit on behalf of the charging party or 
issues a “right to sue” letter. The “right to sue” letter allows the party who filed the EEOC 
complaint to file a lawsuit, but also removes the EEOC from the matter.  
 
Many potential employment discrimination lawsuits no longer reach the judicial system 
because they are resolved in arbitration. Many businesses are now including binding arbitration 
agreements in job offers, requiring job seekers, as a condition of employment, to waive the right 
to trial and turn any grievance over to arbitration. A series of U.S. Supreme Court decisions has 
firmly established the enforceability of those agreements when the arbitration process provided 
for is legitimate and fair. The Court has also ruled, however, that the EEOC retains its right to 
sue on behalf of an employee even if the worker has signed away his or her own rights. 12  
 
Despite headline-grabbing settlements in discrimination cases, a 2010 American Bar 
Foundation (ABF) study found that discrimination lawsuits rarely make it to trial and usu-
ally end with a modest settlement. If these cases go to court, the plaintiffs have only a one-
in-three chance of winning.  13 
 
Another ABF study found that although plaintiffs begin the process optimistically, they 
rarely get a final ruling based on the substantive merits of a case, causing them to view 
employment litigation as favoring defendant-employers. On the other hand, defendant-
employers view the process as unfair because the employee has the power to initiate what 
they view as a “meritless” suit requiring their response.14
 Remedies 
 Recognizing the gravity and nature of injuries caused by intentional discrimination in the 
workplace, Congress expanded the remedies available for such injury under Title VII and 
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to include compensatory damages as well as 
punitive damages in some cases. Compensatory damages may be sought to redress, for 
example, emotional pain and suffering, but combined compensatory and punitive damages 
are capped at $50,000 to $300,000, depending on the size of the employer’s workforce. 
Damages are not capped for front pay (awarded for future earnings) or in cases of inten-
tional discrimination based on race. The EEOC often negotiates consent decrees that may 
require new procedures to correct wrongful practices. [For the Civil Rights Division of the 
U.S. Justice Department, see  www.justice.gov/crt/ ]

EEOC’s Strategic Plan  
 Under the EEOC’s Strategic Plan for FY 2012–2016, the EEOC has made “systemic en-
forcement” a priority. In 2013, the EEOC obtained $372.1 million in monetary relief for 
victims of private-sector workplace discrimination, the EEOC’s highest level of recovery in 
its history. At the same time, a federal appellate court restricted the EEOC’s systemic en-
forcement efforts by ruling that the EEOC would have to determine the individuals in a 
class action against an employer before litigation, not during discovery (see Chapter 4). The 
employer should then have the opportunity to resolve the matter through the EEOC’s con-
ciliation process. However, in denying an employer’s motion for summary judgment, a fed-
eral district judge allowed an EEOC action to proceed without the names of the 
discrimination victims being identified before the lawsuit was filed.  
 Questions 
 1. Why might the EEOC have decided to focus on “systemic enforcement” as part of its 
strategic plan? What are the advantages and disadvantages of such a focus?  Explain.  
 2.  Should the EEOC be able to investigate and bring an enforcement action against an 
employer suspected of a systemic pattern of discrimination without a specific individual 
complaint? Explain.  
3. If the EEOC is required to always identify individual victims of a potentially discrimina-
tory employment practice prior to bringing a class-action lawsuit against the employer, 
how might this impact its systemic enforcement efforts? Explain.

 Part Two—”Types of Discrimination” 
 There are three basic types of illegal employment discrimination: disparate treatment, 
 disparate impact, and harassment. In addition, Title VII and other antiemployment 
 discrimination statutes prohibit retaliation for opposing an employment practice reasonably 
believed to be discriminatory, or for participating in a claim of employment discrimination. 
Plaintiffs may raise claims of more than one type of employment discrimination, as well as 
retaliation, against an employer.  
 Disparate Treatment and Disparate Impact 
 Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act provides two primary theories of recovery for 
 individuals—disparate treatment and disparate impact (sometimes labeled  adverse impact ). 
A disparate treatment claim addresses  intentional  discrimination by an employer who has 
purposefully treated an employee or applicant less favorably because of his or her race, 
color, religion, national origin, gender, or membership in a group under another protected 

Chapter Thirteen  Employment Law II: Discrimination 561
category. Disparate impact claims arise from “unintentional” discrimination where an em-
ployment practice appearing to be neutral has the effect of adversely impacting a particular 
group under a protected category more than it impacts other groups.  
 
 As we turn now to a close look at disparate treatment and disparate impact analysis, keep 
in mind the various constitutional, statutory, and executive order protections just outlined.  
 Disparate Treatment 
 Employees or applicants making claims of disparate treatment must prove their employers’ 
intent to discriminate with either direct or indirect evidence. For example, a company pres-
ident’s remarks that “women were simply ‘not tough enough’ to supervise collections and 
that it was a ‘man’s job,’” (even if tempered by his statement that “I felt that a woman was 
not competent enough to do this job, but I think maybe you’re showing me that you can do 
it,”) may constitute  direct evidence of intentional sex discrimination, as a federal court of 
appeals found. 15 A warehouse company seeking truck loaders might send a letter to an 
employment agency stating: “Women would not be welcome as applicants for this phys-
ically taxing job.” That letter could be used as direct evidence of the employer’s intent to treat 
female applicants adversely compared with male applicants. More often, however, 
 disparate treatment claims rely  on indirect evidence in accord with the following test: 
 1. Plaintiff’s (employee’s)  prima facie case (sufficient to be presumed true unless proven 
otherwise) is confirmed by proving each of the following ingredients:  
 a. Plaintiff belongs to a protected class. 
 b. Plaintiff applied for a job for which the defendant was seeking applicants. 
 c. Plaintiff was qualified for the job. 
 d. Plaintiff was denied the job. 
 e. The position remained open, and the employer continued to seek applicants. 
 2. Defendant’s (employer’s) case. If the plaintiff builds a successful prima facie case, the 
defendant must “articulate some  legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee’s 
rejection” (e.g., greater work experience). However, the defendant need not prove that 
its decision not to hire the plaintiff was, in fact, based on that legitimate, nondiscrimina-
tory reason. The defendant simply must raise a legitimate issue of fact disputing the 
plaintiff’s discrimination claim.  
 3. Plaintiff’s response. Assuming the defendant was successful in presenting a legitimate, 
nondiscriminatory reason for its action, the plaintiff must show that the reason offered 
by the defendant was false and thus was merely a  pretext to hide discrimination. [For an 
overview of disparate treatment analysis, see  www.hr-guide.com/data/G701.htm  ] 
Questions
  Kim Ondricko, a white female, was discharged from her job as floor supervisor at the MGM 
Grand Detroit casino for violating procedures regarding card shuffling, which breached the 
employer’s policy: “What in the business judgment of   MGM Grand Detroit jeopardizes the 
efficiency or integrity of the gaming operation is prohibited.” As Ondricko supervised a 
dealer at a blackjack table, the automatic card shuffler malfunctioned, causing a bad shuffle. 
Ondricko informed her supervisor, the pit boss. Prior to this incident, at least six other 

562  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 supervisors had engaged in shuffle-related misconduct, but only two had been terminated. 
One of the terminated supervisors, a black female who had assisted a dealer having trouble 
removing cards from the shuffler by retrieving and giving the dealer the unshuffled cards to 
deal , had retained attorneys. A black male supervisor had been given a three-day suspension 
for approving a bad shuffle. When an assistant shift manager asked Mike O’Connor, vice 
president of operations, why Ondricko was being terminated, O’Connor stated, “Do you 
think I wanted to fire Kim, I didn’t want to fire Kim, how could I keep the  white girl?” On-
dricko sued her former employer, claiming race and gender discrimination.  
1. How would you resolve this case? Explain.
2. Would Ondricko still be able to bring Title VII discrimination claims if O’Connor had 
not made the statement about why he believed he had to fire her? Explain.
3. Stalter, an African American, was fired for theft after working at a Walmart loading 
dock for four months. While eating a handful of taco chips from an open bag on the 
countertop in the break room, a coworker entered the room, took the bag from Stalter, 
and placed it in her locker. Stalter later apologized to her and offered to buy a new bag. 
She said the incident was “no big deal” and told him to “forget about it.” Management 
then investigated, concluded Stalter had stolen the chips, and fired him. Stalter sued, 
claiming his termination was race based. What questions would you have if you were 
on the jury? Explain. See Stalter v. Wal-Mart Stores, 195 F.3d 285 (7th Cir. 1999).
 Disparate Impact 
  Disparate impact analysis involves situations in which employers use legitimate  employment 
standards that, despite their apparent neutrality, impose a heavier burden on a protected class 
than on other employees. For example, a preemployment test, offered with the best of inten-
tions and constructed to be a fair measurement device, may disproportionately exclude mem-
bers of a protected class and thus be unacceptable (barring an effective defense). Alternatively, 
an employer surreptitiously seeking to discriminate may establish an apparently neutral, su-
perficially valid employment test that has the effect of achieving the employer’s discrimina-
tion goal. For example, a tavern might require its bouncer to be at least 6 feet 2 inches tall and 
weigh at least 200 pounds. Generally, height and weight are not protected classes. However, 
the tavern’s requirement will disproportionately  exclude  women, and perhaps members of 
certain ethnic groups as well. Was this the  tavern’s intent? Most likely it was not, but  remem-
ber that whereas disparate treatment  requires proof of intent, disparate impact does not.  
 The Test 
 Disparate impact analysis requires the following: 
 1. The plaintiff/employee must identify the  specific employment practice or policy (such 
as test score, skill, or height) that caused the alleged disparate impact on the protected 
class. 
 2. The plaintiff must prove (often with statistical evidence) that the protected class is suf-
fering an  adverse or disproportionate impact  caused by the employment practice or 
policy in question. The statistical analysis to establish a disparate impact (against black 
job applicants, for example) must be based on a comparison of the racial composition of 

Chapter Thirteen  Employment Law II: Discrimination 563
 
In 1955 the company instituted a policy of requiring a high 
school education for initial assignment to any department ex-
cept Labor, and for transfer from the Coal Handling to any “in-
side” department (Operations, Maintenance, or Laboratory). 
When the company abandoned its policy of restricting Ne-
groes to the Labor Department in 1965, completion of high 
school also was made a prerequisite to transfer from Labor to 
any other department. From the time the high school require-
ment was instituted to the time of trial, however, white em-
ployees hired before the time of the high school education 
requirement continued to perform satisfactorily and achieve 
promotions in the “operating” departments. Findings on this 
score are not challenged.  
 
The company added a further requirement for new employ-
ees on July 2, 1965, the date on which Title VII became effec-
tive. To qualify for placement in any but the Labor Department 
it became necessary to register satisfactory scores on two 
professionally prepared aptitude tests, as well as to have a 
high school education. Completion of high school alone con-
tinued to render employees eligible for transfer to the four de-
sirable departments from which Negroes had been excluded if 
the incumbent had been employed prior to the time of the new 
requirement. In September 1965 the company began to permit 
incumbent employees who lacked a high school education to 
qualify for transfer from Labor or Coal Handling to an “inside” 
job by passing two tests—the Wonderlic Personnel Test, 
which purports to measure general intelligence, and the 
 Bennett Mechanical Comprehension Test. Neither was 
 directed or intended to measure the ability to learn to perform 
 Chief Justice Burger 
 We granted the writ in this case to resolve the question 
whether an employer is prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, Title VII, from requiring a high school education or pass-
ing of a standardized general intelligence test as a condition of 
employment in or transfer to jobs when (a) neither standard is 
shown to be significantly related to successful job perfor-
mance, (b) both requirements operate to disqualify Negroes at 
a substantially higher rate than white applicants, and (c) the 
jobs in question formerly had been filled only by white employ-
ees as part of a longstanding practice of giving preference to 
whites.  
 
Congress provided, in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, for class actions for enforcement of provisions of the Act 
and this proceeding was brought by a group of incumbent 
 Negro employees against Duke Power Company. . . . 
 
The district court found that prior to July 2, 1965, the effec-
tive date of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the company openly 
discriminated on the basis of race in the hiring and assigning 
of employees at its Dan River plant. The plant was organized 
into five operating departments: (1) Labor, (2) Coal Handling, 
(3) Operations, (4) Maintenance, and (5) Laboratory and Test. 
Negroes were employed only in the Labor Department where 
the highest-paying jobs paid less than the lowest-paying jobs 
in the other four “operating” departments in which only whites 
were employed. Promotions were normally made within each 
department on the basis of job seniority. Transferees into a 
department usually began in the lowest position.

the group of persons actually holding the jobs in question versus the racial composition 
of the  job-qualified population in the relevant labor market. 
 3. Assuming a prima facie case is established in steps 1 and 2, the plaintiff/employee wins 
unless the defendant/employer demonstrates that the employment practice/policy is 
(a)  job related   and (b)   consistent with business necessity  . In the bouncer example above, 
the tavern would have to demonstrate that the height and weight requirements were 
 related to the job in accordance with the needs of taverns. 
 4. If the defendant/employer succeeds in demonstrating job relatedness and business 
 necessity, the employer wins unless the plaintiff/employee demonstrates that  an alternative, 
less discriminatory business practice is available and that the employer refuses to adopt it.  
 
 The following classic case examines disparate impact analysis.

a particular job or category of jobs. The requisite scores used 
for both initial hiring and transfer approximated the national 
median for high school graduates.  
 
The District Court had found that while the company previ-
ously followed a policy of overt racial discrimination in a pe-
riod prior to the Act, such conduct had ceased. The District 
Court also concluded that Title VII was intended to be pro-
spective only and, consequently, the impact of prior inequities 
was beyond the reach of corrective action authorized by the 
Act.  
 
. . . The Court of Appeals concluded there was no violation 
of the Act.  
 * * * * * 
 
The objective of Congress in the enactment of Title VII is 
plain from the language of the statute. It was to achieve equal-
ity of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have 
operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white em-
ployees over other employees. Under the Act, practices, pro-
cedures, or tests neutral on their face, and even neutral in 
terms of intent, cannot be maintained if they operate to 
“freeze” the status quo of prior discriminatory employment 
practices.  
 
The Court of Appeals’ opinion, and the partial dissent, 
agreed that, on the record in the present case, “whites regis-
ter far  better on the company’s alternative requirements” than 
Negroes. This consequence would appear to be directly 
traceable to race. Basic intelligence must have the means of 
articulation to manifest itself fairly in a testing process. Be-
cause they are Negroes, petitioners have long received infe-
rior education in segregated schools.  
 
. . . Congress did not intend by Title VII, however, to guar-
antee a job to every person regardless of qualifications. In 
short, the Act does not command that any person be hired 
simply because he was formerly the subject of discrimination, 
or because he is a member of a minority group. Discriminatory 
preference for any group, minority or majority, is precisely and 
only what Congress has proscribed. . . .  
 
. . . The Act proscribes not only overt discrimination but 
also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in opera-
tion. The touchstone is business necessity. If an employment 
practice which operates to exclude Negroes cannot be shown 
to be related to job performance, the practice is prohibited.  
   
On the record before us, neither the high school comple-
tion requirement nor the general intelligence test is shown to 
bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance 
of the jobs for which it was used. Both were adopted, as the 
Court of Appeals noted, without meaningful study of their rela-
tionship to job-performance ability. Rather, a vice president of 
the company testified, the requirements were instituted on the 
company’s judgment that they generally would improve the 
overall quality of the workforce.  
 
The evidence, however, shows that employees who have 
not completed high school or taken the tests have continued 
to perform satisfactorily and make progress in departments for 
which the high school and test criteria are not used. . . .  
 
The Court of Appeals held that the company had adopted 
the diploma and test requirements without any “intention to 
discriminate against Negro employees.” We do not suggest 
that either the District Court or the Court of Appeals erred in 
examining the employer’s intent; but good intent or absence of 
discriminatory intent does not redeem employment proce-
dures or testing mechanisms that operate as “built-in head-
winds” for minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job 
capability.  
 * * * * * 
 
The facts of this case demonstrate the inadequacy of 
broad and general testing devices as well as the infirmity of 
using diplomas or degrees as fixed measures of capability. . . . 
 
The company contends that its general intelligence tests 
are specifically permitted by Section 703(h) of the Act. That 
section authorizes the use of “any professionally developed 
ability test” that is not “designed, intended   or used to discrim-
inate because of race. . . .” (Emphasis added.)  
 
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, having 
 enforcement responsibility, has issued guidelines interpreting 
Section 703(h) to permit only the use of job-related tests. The 
administrative interpretation of the Act by the enforcing agency 
is  entitled to great deference. Since the Act and its legislative his-
tory support the commission’s construction, this affords good 
reason to treat the guidelines as expressing the will of Congress.  
 
. . . From the sum of the legislative history relevant in this 
case, the conclusion is inescapable that the EEOC’s construc-
tion of Section 703(h) to require that employment tests be job 
related comports with congressional intent.  
 
Nothing in the Act precludes the use of testing or measuring 
procedures; obviously they are useful. What Congress has for-
bidden is giving these devices and mechanisms controlling force 
unless they are demonstrably a reasonable measure of job per-
formance. Congress has not commanded that the less qualified 
be preferred over the better qualified simply because of minority 
origins. Far from disparaging job qualifications as such, Con-
gress has made such qualifications the controlling factor, so that 
race, religion, nationality, and sex become  irrelevant. What Con-
gress has commanded is that any tests used must measure the 
person for the job and not the person in the abstract.  
 
The judgment of the Court of Appeals is . . . reversed.

 Questions 
 1. According to the Supreme Court, what was Congress’s ob-
jective in enacting Title VII?  
 2. Had Duke Power been able to establish that its reasons for 
adopting the diploma and test standards were entirely 
without discriminatory intent, would the Supreme Court 
have ruled differently? Explain.  
 3. What is the central issue in this case? 
 4. Why was North Carolina’s social and educational history 
relevant to the outcome of the case?  
 5. Statistical evidence showed that 35 percent of new hires in 
grocery and produce at Lucky Stores, a retail grocery chain, 
were women, while 84 percent of new hires in deli, bakery, 
and general merchandise were women. Statistical evidence 
also showed that 31 percent of those promoted into appren-
tice jobs in grocery and produce were women, while women 
comprised 75 percent of those promoted into apprentice 
jobs in deli, bakery, and general merchandise. Grocery and 
produce jobs generally were higher-paying jobs than those 
in deli, bakery, and general merchandise. Women received 
significantly fewer overtime hours than men.  
 
 
 Do these facts regarding Lucky Stores suggest discrimi-
nation? Explain. See  Stender v. Lucky Stores , Inc., 803 F.Supp. 
259 (DC Cal. 1992).  
  6. To determine whether police officers were using illegal 
drugs, the Boston Police Department used hair tests. The 
police department took adverse employment actions 
against several African-American police officers who had 
failed the test. The officers brought a Title VII action 
 claiming the test created a disparate impact based on race. 
African-American officers had passed the test at rates be-
tween 97 and 99 percent, while white officers’ pass rate 
was 99 and 100 percent. However, the officers’ expert of-
fered evidence that fail rates of African-American police 
officers were “statistically significant”—between two and 
four standard deviations. The Boston Police Department 
asked for summary judgment. Should the disparate impact 
claim be allowed to proceed? Explain. See Jones v. City of 
Boston, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141440 (D. Mass. 2012).       
  7.   Eighty-one percent of the hires at Consolidated Service 
Systems, a small Chicago janitorial company, were of 
 Korean origin. The EEOC brought a disparate treatment 
claim, saying the firm discriminated in favor of Koreans by 
relying primarily on word-of-mouth recruiting. Hwang, the 
owner, is Korean. Seventy-three percent of the job appli-
cants were Korean. One percent of the Chicago-area 
workforce is Korean, and not more than 3 percent of the 
janitorial workforce for the area is Korean. The court found 
no persuasive evidence of intentional discrimination, 
 although the government claimed that 99 applicants were 
denied jobs because they were not Koreans.  
 
 a.    Does restricting hiring to members of one ethnic group 
constitute discrimination where hiring is accomplished 
by word of mouth? Explain.  
 
 b.  What if a firm, using the word-of-mouth approach, hired 
only white applicants? Explain.  
 
 c.  In this case, the EEOC brought but dropped a disparate 
 impact claim. Analyze the case using the disparate 
impact test. See  Equal Employment Opportunity 
 Commission v. Consolidated Service Systems , 989 F.2d 
233 (7th Cir. 1993).  
 Statutory Defenses 
  In addition to the aforementioned defenses against disparate treatment and disparate im-
pact claims, Title VII also affords specific exemptions or defenses, three of which are of 
particular note: (1) seniority, (2) employee testing, and (3) bona fide occupational qualifi-
cation. Bona fide occupational qualifications are addressed in the next section as part of 
the sex discrimination discussion.  
 Seniority 
 Differences in wages and conditions of employment are permissible under the Civil Rights 
Act of 1964 where those differences are the result of a bona fide (good faith) seniority 
system, as long as the system was not intended to hide or facilitate discrimination. Senior-
ity is important because it often determines who is laid off first and who gets promotions, 
vacations, and so forth. Because white people often have greater seniority than blacks, the 

566  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
result is that seniority may perpetuate the effects of historical discrimination. The Supreme 
Court has made it clear, however, that a bona fide seniority system that perpetuates past 
wrongs is illegal only if discriminatory intent is proven.  16 
 Job-Related Employee Testing 
 Many employers use testing in making hiring and promotion decisions. The availability of 
online applications has contributed to an increase in this practice. 17 To avoid a disparate 
impact created by employee testing, an employer must be able to show that the test in 
question is job-related and consistent with business necessity; that is, the test must evaluate 
an individual’s skills as they relate to the relevant employment opportunity. To prevent 
unlawful disparate treatment, an employer’s test must be uniformly applied regardless of 
an applicant’s or employee’s race, sex, or other protected categories. For example, Title VII 
prohibits an employer from testing the reading ability of African-American  applicants or 
employees while not requiring the same test of their white counterparts.  18 
 Spousal Discrimination? 
 Craig Holcomb, a white male and assistant coach for the Iona College men’s basketball 
team, married an African-American woman. While the team enjoyed a successful record for 
several years, its lackluster performance and player misconduct between 2001 and 2004 led 
to changes in the Iona basketball program including the dismissal of Holcomb and an African-
American assistant coach. Another white assistant coach, who was not engaged in an inter-
racial relationship, was not fired. Holcomb brought a Title VII claim asserting that he had 
been discharged because his wife is African American. Holcomb alleged that Iona  College’s 
athletic director had made several racist and derogatory remarks about African Americans 
on the basketball team and had derided Holcomb’s decision to marry his wife, whom he 
 referred to as “Aunt Jemima.” How would you rule on this case? Explain. 
 Source :  Holcomb v. Iona College , 521 F.3d 130 (2nd Cir. 2008). 
 The Four-Fifths Rule and Disparate Impact 
 If the selection rate (such as the percentage passing a test, being hired, or being promoted) 
for any protected class is less than 80 percent of the selection rate for the group with the 
highest selection rate, then the employment practice in question will be presumed to create 
a disparate impact. An employer falling below that standard must prove the job relatedness 
of the employment practice in question and demonstrate that a good-faith effort was made 
to find a selection procedure that lessened the disparate impact on protected classes. [For

 Question 
 David Dunlap, a 52-year-old African-American man, had 20 years’ experience as a boiler-
maker, including 15 years as a foreman. Most of Dunlap’s work experience had involved 
contract or temporary jobs in Tennessee Valley Authority facilities, but he had never been 
directly employed by the TVA. Dunlap asserted that he had been applying for a position 
with TVA since the 1970s but had not been successful. When he was one of 21 applicants 

Chapter Thirteen  Employment Law II: Discrimination 567
interviewed for 10 available boilermaker positions, he was rejected. The selection commit-
tee, made up of five whites and one African American, individually scored the interviews 
before engaging in “score balancing” where they discussed their individual opinions to even 
out the scores, which changed considerably through that process. Dunlap’s technical exper-
tise equaled that of five of the selected applicants, but his interview score was lower.  Dunlap 
showed that he received lower scores on attendance than white applicants with similar 
 records, as well as on safety compared with white applicants who had inferior records, as 
disclosed in the interview process. Dunlap was ranked 14th out of the 21 candidates. One 
African-American applicant was hired after he filed a discrimination complaint with the 
EEOC based on his similar failed attempts to secure employment with TVA.  What claim or 
claims under Title VII might Dunlap have against the TVA?  How would you rule? Explain. 
See   Dunlap v. Tennessee Valley Authority  , 519 F.3d 626 (6th Cir. 2008).  
 National Origin 
 Employment discrimination often reflects larger social issues that come to influence work-
place relations. A dramatic example is found in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, 
terrorist attacks on the United States: Between September 11, 2001, and September 11, 2004, 
the EEOC processed more than 900 claims of national origin  discrimination associated with 
the September 11 attacks, resulting in approximately $3.2 million in monetary  relief. 19  
  In 2005, the EEOC settled a claim it brought against Pesce, an upscale Houston-based 
restaurant on behalf of Karim El-Raheb, former Pesce general manager. In his August 2001 
review,  El-Raheb had been told he was doing very well. After business declined following 
the September 11 terrorist attacks, Pesce’s co-owners speculated that customers may be 
frightened by  El-Raheb’s appearance and name, suggesting that he could “pass for Hispanic” 
and should change his name to “something Latin.” In  November 2001, El-Raheb was fired 
because “things weren’t working out.” El-Raheb  received $150,000 in monetary relief. 20  
Such harassment has been the subject of more recent national origin discrimination com-
plaints. In 2013, an aeronautical services company resolved an EEOC complaint for $50,000 
brought by a Turkish-Palestinian former employee who had quit his job because of the com-
pany’s failure to stop workplace derogatory jokes about “terrorists and Arabs” and comments 
such as “I don’t know why we don’t just kill all them towelheads.”21
 Speak English Only? 
  Reflecting a national debate over whether English should be the official language of the 
United States, “Speak English Only” rules in the workplace have generated controversy as 
well as national origin discrimination claims based on the disparate impact these rules may 
have on members of ethnic groups whose primary language is not English.  
 
Employers argue that the rules are necessary when dealing with customers, to maintain job 
safety, and to encourage congenial worker relations. EEOC guidelines prohibit employers from 
imposing a blanket ban on employees speaking their primary language in the workplace, but an 
English-only rule at certain times is permissible if justified by business necessity and if ade-
quately explained to the employees.   However, in its 2011 report, “English Only Policies in the 
Workplace,” the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (USCCR) recommended that the EEOC 
instead advise employers that English-only policies in the workplace are lawful unless intended 
to harass, embarrass, or exclude employees and applicants based on their national origin.22

568  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 
In  Garcia v. Spun Steak Co. , the employer, a producer of meat products, instituted an 
English-only rule for its bilingual employees to enhance safety and product quality and to 
address allegations that some employees were making rude comments in Spanish to English-
speaking employees. The English-only rule applied to work but not to lunch, breaks, or 
employees’ own time. The employer’s rule was upheld by a federal appellate court on the 
grounds that it was narrowly defined and did not create a discriminatory atmosphere.  23 
 Question 
 Rodriguez, a FedEx employee of Hispanic origin, informed FedEx’s regional human  resources 
manager Adkinson that he wanted to obtain a promotion to a supervisory position. After ap-
plying and interviewing for an available supervisory position,  Rodriguez was rejected. The 
manager who interviewed Rodriguez found him to be qualified, but did not hire him because 
of Adkinson’s expressed concerns that  Rodriguez’s “accent and speech pattern” would under-
mine his ability to rise through the corporate ranks. Another FedEx manager stated that when 
he asked Adkinson why Rodriguez had not received the  promotion, Adkinson made deroga-
tory comments about Rodriguez’s “language” and “how he speaks.” Is FedEx liable for na-
tional origin  discrimination based on its failure to  promote Rodriguez? Decide. Explain. See 
 Rodriguez v. FedEx Freight East, Inc. , 487 F.3d 1001 (6th Cir. 2007).  
 Racial Harassment 
 The hangman’s noose, perhaps the most hurtful and disgraceful 
 expression of racism, has sadly appeared in recent racial harassment 
cases. In 2008, the EEOC announced the $465,000 settlement of a ra-
cial  harassment lawsuit on behalf of African-American employees of Henredon  Furniture In-
dustries, who had been subjected to a persistent racially hostile work environment that included 
the display of hangman’s nooses.  24   In 2013, a federal jury awarded $200,000 in compensatory 
and punitive damages against a North Carolina trucking company on behalf of two former 
 African-American truck drivers who were subjected to racial slurs and threats involving nooses. 
One of the drivers was approached by a white coworker with a noose who said, “This is for 
you. Do you want to hang from the family tree?” The other driver had been told by a supervi-
sor: “Don’t find a noose with your name on it.”25 In 2012, an Atlanta manufacturer settled an 
EEOC lawsuit that alleged that racially charged graffiti and comments were directed at African-
American employees, one of whom found a hangman’s noose at his workstation.26
 
As startling as these claims may seem, whether racially charged workplace conduct 
rises to the level of unlawful harassment appears to be a subject of conflict among federal 
courts. In October 2012, a federal judge granted the EEOC a partial summary judgment in 
a racial harassment case, holding that conduct that included racial slurs and “jokes” about 
lynching was “constitutionally offensive in any setting.”27 However, the next month, an 
Arkansas federal court found that the use of a racial slur in the workplace was not deroga-
tory but at “most coarse jesting.”28
 
In addition to overt forms of workplace harassment such as racial slurs and threats, the use 
of more subtle “code words” may constitute racial and/or national origin harassment. In 2006 
  the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously held that calling African-American male employees

 Black History Month 
 In February 2010, the “Compton Cookout,” an off-campus party near the University of 
California, San Diego (UC San Diego) was organized in apparent mockery of Black His-
tory Month. The invitation detailed a dress code based on racial stereotypes. The university 
responded with a teach-in to explore how such incidents arise and the importance of “mu-
tual respect and civility” on its campus. The Office of the Chancellor issued a statement: 
“We strongly condemn [the party] and the blatant disregard of our campus values. Al-
though the party was not a UC San Diego student-organization sponsored event, partici-
pants did include UC San Diego students and that causes us great concern.”

 Part Three—Sex Discrimination 
 Gender Equality 
 A discussion of gender inequality in the workplace typically begins with the gender-wage 
gap, which persists through the 50-year anniversary of the 1963 Equal Pay Act: In 2013, the 
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that American women working full-time earn 
on average about 81 cents for every dollar earned by men.31 However, supported by other 
statistics, a rise in women’s power in the workplace has been observed. For example, child-
less women in their 20s earn more than their male counterparts.32 Yet women’s perception of 
gender bias—such as lower pay and other forms of discrimination—have remained high.33  
 
The power and limits of statutory protections against sex discrimination are evident in recent 
Title VII class-action lawsuits brought by female employees alleging disparity in pay, work 
assignments, and promotion. In 2007, a federal judge approved a $46 million settlement of a 
class-action lawsuit brought against Morgan Stanley representing 3,000 female financial 
 advisers and trainees claiming discrimination in compensation, promotion, and work assign-
ments. 34 But the class-action approach to discrimination litigation  suffered a significant setback 
in 2011 when the U.S. Supreme Court denied class-action status in a sex discrimination case 
against Walmart. The plaintiffs argued, among other things, that women have occupied 
70  percent of Walmart’s hourly jobs but only 33 percent of management positions.  
“boy” could have racial overtones, even if not modified with a reference to African  Americans. 29 
In   Aman v. Cort Furniture Rental Corporation , 30 two black employees claimed that they were 
subjected to a racially hostile work environment in part because black employees were labeled 
by coworkers and managers with racist “code words” such as “all of you,” “one of them,” and 
“poor people.” The court, in finding for the employees, ruled that certain phrases in the employ-
ment setting cannot be excused as mere rudeness and may, in the totality of the circumstances, 
add up to discrimination so severe that it creates an abusive work environment.  
 
Legal requirements and the evolving standards for analyzing harassment claims will be 
explored later in the context of sexual harassment—perhaps the most familiar form of 
workplace harassment.

570  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 
The Supreme Court decision did not reach the substantive merits of the discrimination 
complaint. Rather, the Supreme Court ruled that the case could not go forward as a class 
action because the plaintiffs did not point to specific, consistent, nationwide employment 
policies or practices that harmed the class members. (See Chapter 4 for more on the 
Walmart case and its impact on class actions.) 35 
 Glass Ceiling?  Does a “glass ceiling” of prejudice hold women back from roles of power and 
career advancement? A 2011 study found a 40 percent disparity between male and female 
MBAs 10 years after graduation.36  
Lean In
In her 2013 book entitled Lean In, Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg ob-
serves that too few women are reaching leadership positions in business because, among 
other factors, of women’s choices to curtail their own career ambitions. To support wom-
en’s professional success and leadership, Sandberg advises women to “lean in” to their 
careers and make themselves more visible and heard at the workplace. 
Questions
1. Do you agree with Sandberg’s observations? Explain. 
2. What choices might women make that interfere with their career advancement? What 
other factors may blunt women’s career growth? Explain. 
3. A recent study involving fictitious chief executive officers (CEOs) revealed that women 
who are seen as “chatty” or talkative are viewed as less competent, whereas men who 
dominate workplace conversations are more likely to succeed. A quiet female is viewed 
far more favorably than her chatty female counterpart: Her competence is assumed to 
be about equal to that of a talkative male. What might this mean for women who “lean 
in” at the workplace? Explain.

 Analysis of Sex Discrimination: Current Issues  
 Sex discrimination claims brought under Title VII include disparate treatment and disparate 
impact, as well as sexual harassment. Employee training and policies targeting sex discrimina-
tion have become common in the American workplace. However, sex discrimination claims 
remained the basis for approximately 30 percent of the charges filed with the EEOC from 
1997 to 2013.37 Thus, sex discrimination claims remain a critical area of Title VII analysis.  
 Sex Discrimination and Disparate Impact 
 The following case illustrates the analysis of a sex discrimination claim alleging disparate 
impact. 

 Pietras v. Farmingville Fire 
District 
180 F.3d 468 (2d Cir.1999); cert. 
den. 528 U.S. 948 (1999)  
 four-minute threshold was determined by taking the average 
of all the (mostly male) test runs (approximately 3:30) and then 
adding an extra half-minute “to have some leeway.” There 
was some concern expressed at a 1993 Farmingville Board 
meeting that neither Serpe nor Pietras had been able to finish 
the PAT in anything close to four minutes, but Farmingville 
nevertheless instituted the four-minute cutoff.  
 
 Following the implementation of the PAT, Pietras tried and 
failed the test twice. During this same period, six other female 
probationary firefighters took the test. Four of these women 
completed the PAT in under four minutes and therefore 
passed. One woman failed to complete the test for an  unknown 
reason. And one woman did not complete the test despite 
 repeated efforts to drag the water-filled hose over the  required 
distance. All of the 24 male probationary volunteers who took 
the test at about this time passed.  
 
Following her second failure to pass the PAT, Pietras was 
fired from her volunteer position at Farmingville.  
 * * * * * 
 
Pietras filed suit in district court, alleging that Farmingville 
had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  
 * * * * * 
 
At trial . . . , Pietras presented testimony from Dr. Robert 
Otto, an expert exercise physiologist. Dr. Otto conducted an 
extensive review of the physical agility tests administered by 
various volunteer and paid fire departments and concluded 
(a) that the four-minute limit in the Farmingville test had a dis-
parate impact on women, and (b) that it was not job related.  
 
After reviewing the evidence, the district court ruled for 
Pietras.  
 * * * * * 
 
[T]he court concluded that “the record is bereft of any evi-
dence” that a four-minute time limit to finish the PAT was job 
related.  † 
 
In support of its finding of disparate impact, the court noted 
that the male pass rate on the PAT was 95 percent (63 out of 
66) while the female pass rate was only 57 percent (4 out of 7). 
Relying on the “four-fifths” rule set forth in the EEOC Guide-
lines, the court reasoned that “a pass rate for women which is 
 † [T]here is no evidence at all to indicate that the time chosen for the test 
reflected the needs of the job. In fact, the record makes clear that 
Farmingville selected the four-minute figure simply by taking the average 
of all the test scores and then arbitrarily adding some extra time.  
 Circuit Judge Calabresi 
 The district court found that Farmingville’s physical agility test 
(“PAT”), which all probationary volunteer firefighters were re-
quired to pass in order to become full-fledged volunteer fire-
fighters, had a disparate impact on women.  
 * * * * * 
 BACKGROUND 
 Farmingville is the governing body of a volunteer fire department 
that has approximately 100 members. Pietras was a probationary 
(i.e., trainee) firefighter in the Farmingville Department. Even as a 
probationary volunteer, Pietras was entitled to numerous fire-
fighter benefits under state law and the by-laws of the department. 
These included (1) a retirement pension, (2) life insurance, (3) death 
benefits, (4) disability  insurance, and (5) some medical benefits.  
 
Before Pietras could become a full member of the 
 department, however, she and all other probationary volun-
teers were required to pass a newly instituted PAT.  *   The PAT 
 consisted of a series of physical tasks that the applicants had 
to complete within a specified time limit. The most difficult of 
these nine labors was the “charged hose drag,” which in-
volved dragging a water-filled hose—weighing approximately 
280 pounds—over a distance of 150 feet.  
  
To determine the appropriate time limit for the PAT, 
 Farm ingville officials asked various members of the depart-
ment to take the test. Forty-four firefighters participated in 
these trials. Of the 44 test-takers, 33 were males who served 
as full  firefighters, 6 were male probationary members, 3 were 
male junior members, one was Jeanine Serpe, a female full 
 firefighter, and one was  Pietras. The average times of these 
subgroups were:

Average Time 
 Full males (33)

 Probationary males (6) 
2:47 
 Junior males (3) 
2:52 
 Full female (Serpe) 
5:30 
 Probationary female (Pietras) 
5:21 
 
From these results, Farmingville set four minutes as the 
time within which the labors had to be completed. The

also preconditions to becoming a full firefighter.

less [than] four-fifths (or 80 percent) of the pass rate for men 
typically signifies disparate impact sufficient to establish a 
prima facie case. . . . Therefore, the gender imbalance [in this 
case] more than satisfies the 80 percent standard.” This 
 statistical evidence (which was corroborated by Dr. Otto’s 
 testimony concerning the effect of the PAT on women) was 
deemed by the district court to be enough to establish dispa-
rate impact.  
 
Farmingville appeals. 
 DISCUSSION 
 * * * * * 
 Disparate Impact 
 * * * * * 
 Farmingville asserts that, even if the statistical figures before 
the district court were correct, a sample of seven female test 
takers is simply too small to support a disparate impact finding.  
 * * * * * 
 
In the case before us, however, Pietras presented more 
than just statistics. After conducting an exhaustive analysis of 
the practices of other fire departments, Dr. Otto provided ex-
pert testimony on the disparate impact of Farmingville’s PAT. 
This expert testimony, combined with the statistics Pietras did 
present, comfortably tips the scales in favor of the district 
court’s finding of disparate impact.  
 
Affirmed. 
 Questions 
 1. a.  Why did the court conclude that the Farmingville Fire 
Department had discriminated against Pietras?  
 
 b.  Did the court conclude that Farmingville intended to 
 discriminate? Explain. 
 
 c.  What, if anything, could Farmingville have done differ-
ently to win this case?  
 2. a.  Shouldn’t we always choose the strongest, fastest fire-
fighters as long as they are otherwise well qualified? 
Explain.  
 
 b.  After being rejected for employment as police officers 
with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Au-
thority (SEPTA), several women sued SEPTA for sex dis-
crimination based on disparate impact. The women 
were unable to run 1½ miles in 12 minutes, a job require-
ment. Fifty-six percent of the men applying for the posi-
tion passed the related test, but 93 percent of the female 
applicants could not pass. Resolve the case. Explain. 
See Lanning v. SEPTA, 308 F.3d 286 (3d Cir. 2002).  
 3. a.  How would you argue that Women’s Workout World, a 
health and exercise club, should be able to lawfully 
 decline to accept men as customers and/or  employees? 
 
 b.    Decide the case. Explain. See   U.S. EEOC v. Sedita  , 
816 F.Supp. 1291 (N.D. Ill. 1993).  
  4.   Dianne Rawlinson sought employment as a prison guard in 
Alabama. She was a 22-year-old college graduate with a 
degree in correctional psychology. She was denied 
 employment because she failed to meet the 120-pound 
weight requirement for the job. The state also required 
such employees to be at least 5 feet 2 inches tall. Alabama 
operated four all-male, maximum-security prisons. The 
 district court characterized the Alabama prison system as 
one of “rampant violence.” Rawlinson sued, claiming 
 employment discrimination. Decide. Explain. See  Dothard 
v. Rawlinson , 97 S.Ct. 2720 (1977).

 Bona Fide Occupational Qualification 
 Often in intentional sex discrimination cases, the key inquiry involves the   bona fide 
 occupational qualification (BFOQ)   defense provided by Title VII. Discrimination is  lawful 
where sex, religion, or national origin is a BFOQ reasonably necessary to the normal 
 operation of that business. The exclusion of race and color from the list suggests Congress 
thought those categories always unacceptable as bona fide occupational qualifications. The 
BFOQ was meant to be a very limited exception applicable to situations where  specific 
inherent characteristics are necessary to the job (for example, wet nurse) or where authen-
ticity (actors), privacy (nurses), or safety(guards) is required. Broadly, the BFOQ defense 
rests on this question: Is being a female, for example, necessary to perform the  essence of 
the job? 

Chapter Thirteen  Employment Law II: Discrimination 573
 Essence 
 An employer can lawfully insist on a woman to fill a woman’s modeling role because be-
ing female goes to the essence of the job. Airlines, on the other hand, cannot hire only 
women as flight attendants even if customers prefer females and even if females  perform 
the supplementary elements of the job (like charming passengers) better than most men. 
Those duties “are tangential to the essence of the business involved” 38 (the essence  being 
the maintenance of safe, orderly conditions, providing service as needed, etc). Presumably, 
gender has little to do with the ability to perform those essential ingredients of the job.  
 
Many employers have simply assumed that women could not perform certain tasks. For 
example, women were thought to be insufficiently aggressive for sales roles, and women 
were denied employment because they were assumed to have a higher turnover rate 
 because of the desire to marry and have children. Those stereotypes are at the heart of sex 
discrimination litigation generally and do not support a BFOQ defense.  
 What about Hooters?
Can the Hooters restaurant chain lawfully decline to hire men to be food servers? Scantily 
clad “Hooters girls” serve food and beverages to Hooters restaurant customers. In the 
1990s, several class-action lawsuits were brought against Hooters on behalf of rejected 
male applicants. Under the 1997 settlement reached in the consolidated class action, 
 Hooters was allowed to maintain its policy of hiring females only as food servers, but it 
agreed to create other restaurant positions such as bartenders for which men would have 
equal hiring opportunities. A 2009 gender discrimination claim brought by a Texas man 
who was allegedly told by a manager at the Corpus Christi Hooters restaurant that he 
would not be hired as a waiter because of his gender resulted in a confidential settlement 
with Hooters. 
 Questions 
  1.   If the lawsuits against Hooters had not settled, do you think Hooters would have been 
able to raise a successful BFOQ defense? Explain.  
 2. Is Hooters’ hiring policy better left to the market and ethics than to the courts? Explain.

 Looks Discrimination 
  Harrah’s Reno, Nevada, casino instituted a “Personal Best” appearance policy requiring its 
female bartenders to wear makeup while prohibiting their male counterparts from wearing 
any. After a successful 20-year career as a Harrah’s bartender, Darlene Jespersen was fired 
for refusing to wear makeup under the policy.

 including its Ankeny, Iowa, location. Her performance was excellent, earning her  compliments

 Work-Life Balance and Sex Discrimination 
  Antidiscrimination law has been critical in allowing women to pursue careers and in 
 providing some refuge from the professional disadvantages of pregnancy experienced at 
some workplaces. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) amended Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 so that discrimination with regard to pregnancy is treated as a 
form of sex discrimination. Broadly, the PDA requires that pregnant employees be treated 
the same as all other employees with temporary disabilities. In general, an employer should 
not ask job  applicants about pregnancy, and applicants have no duty to reveal that 
 pregnancy. Nor can a pregnant employee be forced to take time off or be forced to quit due 
to pregnancy. 
 FRD 
“Family Responsibilities Discrimination” has achieved increased recognition in recent 
years. While no express antidiscrimination statutory protection is afforded to parents or 
caregivers, FRD claims may be based on existing statutes such as Title VII. For example, 
in  Chadwick v. Wellpoint, Inc. , a federal appeals court allowed the mother of 6-year-old 
triplets and an older child to proceed with a Title VII claim alleging that she was rejected 
for a promotion in favor of a less-qualified woman as a result of a sex-based stereotype that 
mothers with young  children neglect their careers because of child 
care responsibilities. 39 [For the EEOC Enforcement Guidance on 
FRD, see “EEOC Enforcement Guidance:  Unlawful Disparate 
Treatment of Workers with Caregiving  Responsibilities” at   www

from customers and merit raises. Heartland’s new corporate director of operations, Barbara 
Cullinan, had approved hiring Lewis for a full-time position staffing the  Ankeny motel’s front 
desk during the day, but Cullinan became dissatisfied after seeing Lewis in person. Cullinan 
was heard saying that Heartland staff should be “pretty,” especially those working at the front 
desk. Lewis was self-described as “slightly more masculine.” She avoided makeup and often 
wore her hair short. The front desk job description in  Heartland’s personnel manual did not 
mention appearance, stating only that a guest service representative must create “a warm, in-
viting atmosphere” and perform tasks such as relaying information and receiving reservations. 
Cullinan instituted a policy requiring videotaping of interviews for front desk hires. Over 
protests of her direct manager, Lewis was eventually fired.  
 
Both Jespersen and Lewis brought Title VII claims against their former employers.

 Questions 
 1. Waitresses at the Rustic Inn were prohibited under a written policy from waiting tables 
past their fifth month of pregnancy and required either to suspend working or to switch 
to working as cashiers or hostesses, who are paid less since they do not receive gratui-
ties. The EEOC filed a lawsuit against the employer on behalf of a class of three 
 aggrieved employees, alleging that the policy violated the PDA. Decide. See  EEOC v. 
W&O Inc.  , 213 F.3d 600 (11th Cir. 2000).  
 2. Besides avoiding FRD liability, how might an employer benefit from effectively supporting 
employees’ balancing of work and life responsibilities? Should parents and other caregivers 
be given express statutory protection against employment discrimination? Explain.  
 Equal Pay 
 Title VII affords broad protection from discrimination in pay because of sex. The Equal Pay 
Act of 1963 directly forbids discrimination on the basis of sex by paying wages to employees 
of one sex at a rate less than the rate paid to employees of the opposite sex for equal work on 
jobs requiring equal skill, effort, and responsibility and performed under similar working 
 conditions (equal has been interpreted to mean “substantially equal”). The act provides for 
certain exceptions. Unequal wage payments are lawful if paid pursuant to (1) a seniority 
 system, (2) a merit system, (3) a system that measures earnings by quantity or quality of pro-
duction, or (4) a differential based on “any . . . factor other than sex.” The employer seeking to 
avoid a  violation of the Equal Pay Act can adjust its wage structure by raising the pay of the 
disfavored sex performing equal work. Lowering the pay of the  favored sex violates the act.  
 
If a male employee has a greater skill set—such as computer skills—than his female 
coworker doing “equal work,” the employer may pay the man at a higher rate, as long as 
the male employee’s superior skills are actually considered in making the pay  decision. 40 
CEOs on Maternity Leave
When Marissa Mayer was named chief executive officer (CEO) of Yahoo in July 2012, 
she was six months pregnant, a fact well noted in media reports of Yahoo’s announcement. 
In 2014, after several months in her new position as WEX CEO, Melissa Smith announced 
in a companywide memo the impending birth of her first child. During her leave, the for-
mer WEX CEO and current chairman, Michael Dubyack, was prepared to help with the 
executive leadership functions. However, Ms. Smith indicated that, like Ms. Mayer, she 
planned a brief maternity leave during which she would stay involved with work.
Question
How might these high-profile maternity leaves affect perceptions of maternity leave and 
working women? Explain.

 Sexual Harassment 
 If asked, “what is an example of sexual harassment?” a typical and reasonable  response 
might be “a male boss making unwanted sexual advances on a female employee, telling 
her that such conduct is a job requirement,” or “a male employee touching his female 
 coworker in a sexual and unwanted manner.” Although these examples offer solid bases 
for sexual harassment claims, they do not provide a complete picture. As a form of sex 
 discrimination actionable under Title VII, sexual harassment protection covers both men 
and women and strives to maintain equal opportunity in the workplace.  
 
According to a recent Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) poll, nearly 
two-thirds of organizations received sexual harassment complaints from employees in the 
previous 24 months, and a quarter of organizations noted an increase in such claims during 
that time. Nearly one-fifth of organizations reported that the sexual harassment complaints 
were brought by male and female employees equally.  41 
 
Women in authority seem to be particularly susceptible to sexual harassment. A 2012 
study showed that female supervisors were more likely to be harassed than women in sub-
ordinate positions.42 Why might women in powerful positions be more likely to  experience 
sexual harassment? How might an employer address this issue? (See Eve Tahmincioglu,

2009 [ www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32476564/ns/business-careers /]) 
 The Customer Is Not Always Right 
  According to a lawsuit filed by the EEOC, two female cashiers at Love’s truck stop in Buckeye, 
Arizona, ages 18 and 20, were allegedly subjected to unwanted sexual touching and pressing, 
crude and obscene remarks, sexual demands and innuendos, and demands for personal 
 information—by customers, sometimes in front of other customers. The EEOC asserted that 
Love’s management knew about and tolerated this sexually hostile work environment caused by 
its customers. Further, at least one ma nager allegedly laughed about it, and another manager said 
the harassment was to be expected because it is a truck stop. Managers also told the two cashiers 
to “deal with it,” especially the misconduct of one repeat customer because “he’s always like 
that.” Should the employer be held liable for workplace harassment by its customers? Explain.

 Salary Negotiating Skills 
 Dreves was terminated from her $48,500  job as a general manager of Hudson’s retail opera-
tion at Burlington International Airport, and replaced Dixon, a male, at a salary of $52,500. 
Dreves filed an Equal Pay Act lawsuit and moved for summary judgment. In defending 
against the motion for summary judgment, Hudson argued that the salary difference was 
based on “factors other than sex:” Dixon had to relocate his family from another state, and 
had strong negotiating skills. Did the employer violate the Equal Pay Act? Decide. Explain. 
Dreves v. Hudson Group, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 82636 (D. Vt. 2013).  

Chapter Thirteen  Employment Law II: Discrimination 577
 The Law of Sexual Harassment 
  Sexual harassment, as a form of discrimination, consists of unwelcome sexual advances, 
 requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature that 
(1)  becomes a condition of employment, (2) becomes a basis for employment decisions, or 
(3)  unreasonably interferes with work performance or creates a hostile working 
 environment. 
 
There are two types of sexual harassment:  quid pro quo (“this for that,” such as a sexual 
favor in exchange for keeping one’s job) and  hostile work environment (a workplace 
 rendered offensive and abusive by such conduct as sexual comments, pictures, jokes, sex-
ual aggression, and the like where no employment benefit is gained or lost). As discussed 
earlier in this chapter, hostile work environments may be created by offensive or abusive 
conduct involving protected categories other than sex, including race, religion, national 
origin, and disability. The law of sexual harassment, particularly in regard to hostile work 
environments, may apply to these cases. 
 The Test 
 Once we have some idea of behavior that constitutes sexual harassment, our concern turns 
to which remedies are available for the victims. Although the question is not settled, most 
 federal courts to date have ruled that victims of sexual harassment seeking recovery under 
Title VII cannot sue the person who actually committed the harassment. The victim might 
be able to sue the wrongdoer under a state statute or by using a tort claim such as assault, 
but under Title VII,  personal liability appears not to be available. This result, if the current 
 judicial pattern continues, is not as unfair as might at first appear because well-settled prin-
ciples of justice hold the employer and not the employer’s agents or employees, generally 
 responsible for workplace wrongdoing. The victim, therefore, can seek damages from the 
employer as the responsible party. A pair of 1998 U.S. Supreme Court decisions in the 
 Burlington Industries and  Faragher  43 cases considerably clarified the circumstances under 
which an employer is liable for sexual harassment in the workplace. The analysis proceeds 
as follows: 
 1. Proof of sexual harassment—The plaintiff/employee/victim must prove items a to c:  
 a. The harassing conduct is unwelcome. 
 b. The harassing conduct is because of sex. 
 c.   The harassing conduct resulted in a tangible employment action, or was sufficiently 
severe or pervasive as to unreasonably alter the conditions of employment and create 
a hostile, abusive work environment.  
 If the plaintiff is unable to prove items a to c, the claim fails. If the plaintiff proves items a to c, 
the inquiry then turns to the question of whether the employer bears responsibility for the 
harassment, as analyzed in Part 2. 
 2. Employer liability and the affirmative defense 
 a.  If the wrongdoer is a coworker, the plaintiff/employee can bring a negligence claim 
seeking to prove that the employer unreasonably failed to prevent or remedy the 

578  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
discriminatory harassment of the plaintiff/employee where management knew or 
should have known about the harassment. 
 b.  If the wrongdoer is a supervisor with authority over the plaintiff/employee, and if the 
employee suffered a  tangible employment action (job loss, demotion) because of the 
harassment, the employer is vicariously liable (indirect liability—see Chapter 12) 
for the employee’s losses. That is, the employer is strictly liable for the employee’s 
wrong and cannot offer a defense regardless of lack of knowledge, absence of 
 negligence, or any other factor. 
 c.    If the wrongdoer is a supervisor with authority over the plaintiff/employee, but the 
employee suffered no tangible employment action, the employer can avoid liability 
by proving both elements of the following affirmative defense:  
 
 (1) The employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct the harassment 
promptly (by instituting antiharassment training programs, having a policy for 
 reporting harassment, and so on) and (2) the employee unreasonably failed to take 
advantage of those opportunities.  
 In its 2012 decision in a Title VII sexual harassment claim, Vance v. Ball State, the U.S. 
Supreme Court restricted the definition of supervisor to one who could take a tangible 
employment action against the allegedly harassed employee.44 The impact of that decision 
is illustrated in the case that follows. 
 McCormack v. Safeway
2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17805 (D. Ariz. 2014)  
ported Lopez’s conduct. Stabenchek participated in Safeway’s 
internal investigation of the assault, which led to Lopez’s ter-
mination on March 26, 2011.
 
Less than a month after reporting the sexual assault, Plain-
tiffs were both interviewed about McCormack’s alleged viola-
tion of Safeway’s coupon policy. Safeway alleges that in late 
December 2010, a Safeway security analyst reported that it ap-
peared as though McCormack was violating the company’s cou-
pon policies. The analyst allegedly discovered more evidence of 
coupon abuse, which she reported to a loss prevention investi-
gator in April 2011. The investigator confronted Stabenchek and 
McCormack in connection with his investigation. McCormack 
was suspended pending further  investigation. Feeling that their 
honesty was impugned “on the heels” of their reports about 
Lopez’s misconduct, Plaintiffs resigned on April 13, 2011.

I. BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs are two women, Mary McCormack and Samantha 
Stabenchek, who worked as cashiers for a Safeway store 
in  Scottsdale, Arizona. McCormack is the mother of 
 Stabenchek. Stabenchek was 17 years old when she started 
work at Safeway and appears to have been a minor during the 
events at issue in  this case.
 
On March 3, 2011, Jose Lopez, a general clerk at the store, 
cornered Ms. Stabenchek, grabbed her buttocks, and kissed 
her. Plaintiffs allege that the assault was the culmination of 
months of sexual harassment in which Lopez made  inappropriate 
 comments to Stabenchek in the workplace and sent her sexu-
ally explicit text messages. After the assault, McCormack re-

Stabenchek has asserted [a] sexual harassment . . . [claim] 
against Safeway under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964 . . . (“Title VII”). 
* * * * *
III. HARASSMENT CLAIMS
Title VII provides that an employer may not “discriminate 
against an individual with respect to [her] compensation, 
terms, conditions, or privileges of employment because of 
[her] . . . sex[.]” . . . Sexual harassment constitutes unlawful 
discrimination under Title VII. Meritor Sav. Bank v. Vinson. . . . 
If the harassing employee is the victim’s coworker, the em-
ployer may be held liable only if it was negligent in controlling 
working conditions.     Vance v. Ball State Univ. . . . ” In cases in 
which the harasser is a ‘supervisor,’ however, different rules 
apply, “and the employer may be held vicariously liable.”. . .
A. Vicarious Liability
Safeway asserts that it cannot be held vicariously liable for 
Lopez’s harassment because Lopez was not Stabenchek’s su-
pervisor. “[A]n employee is a ‘supervisor’ for purposes of vi-
carious liability under Title VII if he or she is empowered by the 
employer to take tangible employment actions against the vic-
tim.”  Vance . . . “The ability  to direct another employee’s tasks 
is simply not sufficient” to give rise to “supervisor” status. In-
stead, supervisors are a “distinct class of agent [empowered] 
to make economic decisions affecting other employees under 
his or her control. . . . Tangible employment actions are the 
means by which the supervisor brings the official power of the 
enterprise to bear on subordinates.”. . . [internal quotation 
marks and citation omitted] [emphasis in original].
 
Lopez was a front end manager when Stabenchek became 
an employee at Defendant’s Scottsdale location, but he had 
been demoted to general clerk by the time much of the alleged 
harassment took place, including the sexual assault. The distinc-
tion is not important, however, because neither front end manag-
ers nor general clerks qualify as supervisors under  Vance. Front 
end managers and general clerks lack authority to make eco-
nomic decisions affecting other employees under their control. 
Front end managers and general clerks are not empowered by 
Safeway to hire, promote, demote, fire, increase pay, decrease 
pay, or impose any economic change on any employees. 
 
Plaintiffs assert that Lopez was Stabenchek’s supervisor 
under  Vance because he was in charge of the store during 
some of Stabenchek’s shifts and because he sat in on 
 Stabenchek’s initial job interview and assured her that she 
would get her hired. Plaintiffs have presented evidence that 
front end managers occasionally directed other employees to 
sign documents that Safeway “uses to bind their employees.” 
In addition, Plaintiffs assert that front end managers are super-
visors because they have significant decision-making power, 
including telling employees when to clock out and when to take 
breaks. But Plaintiffs have provided no evidence that Lopez had 
any ability to influence Stabenchek’s employment beyond de-
termining the timing of her breaks and the manner in which she 
performed her job, and  Vance states that “the ability to direct 
employee’s tasks is simply not sufficient” to justify a finding 
that a manager is a supervisor for purposes of Title VII vicari-
ous liability.  . . . Vance requires Plaintiffs to show that Lopez 
had power to make economic decisions affecting  Stabenchek’s 
employment at Safeway such as the ability to fire, hire, pro-
mote, or change Stabenchek’s compensation. Plaintiffs have 
presented no evidence that Lopez possessed such authority.
 
Plaintiffs’ reliance on Lindquist v. Tanner . . . is  misplaced. . . . 
[I]n Tanner . . . the harasser was able to impact the plaintiff’s 
employment status. The harasser actively recruited the 
 plaintiff . . . [appeared] that he had the ability to determine 
whether or not plaintiff would become a full-time employee, and 
the harasser was the most senior employee on-site. . . . 
* * * * *
Lopez participated in Stabenchek’s hiring process. Safeway 
has shown, however, that while Lopez sat in on Stabenchek’s 
initial 5-minute screening interview, . . . , the hiring decision 
was made by a different Safeway employee after an hour-long 
interview. . . . In addition, the fact that Lopez was occasionally 
the person in charge at Safeway’s Scottsdale store is a far cry 
from the authority required by  Vance.
 
Undisputed facts show that Lopez was not Stabenchek’s 
supervisor as a matter of law. As a result, Safeway cannot be 
held vicariously liable for Lopez’s harassment.
B. Liability in Negligence
Where harassment by a coworker is alleged, the employer can 
be held liable only if “its own negligence is a cause of the har-
assment.” . . . Thus, an employer is responsible for its own ac-
tions or omissions and not for a coworker’s  harassment. “If 
the employer fails to take corrective action after learning of an 
employee’s sexually harassing conduct, or takes inadequate 
action that emboldens the harasser to continue his miscon-
duct, the employer can be deemed to have ‘adopt[ed] the of-
fending conduct and its results, quite as if they have been 
authorized affirmatively as the employer’s policy.’”
 
An employer cannot be held liable for misconduct of which it 
is unaware. . . . Safeway  asserts that it cannot be held liable un-
der a negligence theory because, although Stabenchek claims 
that Lopez had been making hundreds of sexual comments and 
sending thousands of sexual messages to her for months before 

580  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
the March 3 incident, Stabenchek never told anyone about any 
alleged harassment until March 5, the day before McCormack 
reported it to Safeway. Plaintiffs rejoin that Safeway can be lia-
ble because one of Safeway’s managers observed Lopez har-
assing Stabenchek and did nothing to stop it. 
* * * * *
 
Stabenchek testified that about one month before the sex-
ual assault, Megan Oxford, a second assistant manager, ap-
proached Stabenchek about an incident Oxford had 
witnessed. Oxford told Stabenchek that she saw an exchange 
between Lopez and Stabenchek after which Stabenchek 
looked at Lopez like she was disgusted. Oxford had not heard 
what Lopez said, but she urged Stabenchek to share anything 
that Stabenchek thought Oxford needed to know. Stabenchek 
declined to share any specific information with Oxford be-
cause she was uncomfortable and embarrassed. Oxford again 
asked Stabenchek if she wanted to report anything, but 
 Stabenchek responded that Lopez was just being a “creep” 
and that she did not want to report anything.
 
Oxford’s observations, and Stabenchek’s subsequent re-
sponses to Oxford’s questions, did not put Safeway on notice 
of Lopez’s sexually harassing conduct toward Stabenchek. . . . 
Although Stabenchek told Oxford that Lopez was being a 
“creep,” that uninformative comment was not enough to com-
municate that Lopez was sexually harassing Stabenchek.

Once Safeway actually learned of Lopez’s sexually harass-
ing conduct, it took prompt corrective action. Stabenchek told 
her mother about the Lopez’s harassment on Saturday, 
March 5. McCormack told second assistant manager Ryan on 
Sunday, March 6. By Monday, March 7, the store manager, 
 Anthony Duran, and a human resources advisor, Joyce 
 Cameron, initiated an investigation of the incident. Lopez was 
interviewed later that day and was immediately suspended 
pending the results of the investigation. Lopez never returned 
to work at Safeway and was fired. . . .

IT IS ORDERED that Defendant’s motion for summary judg-

Questions
1. According to the court, under Vance, Lopez was not 
 Stabenchek’s supervisor for purposes of Title VII sexual 
harassment liability. Why? 
 
a. What was the basis for the plaintiffs’ assertion that 
Lopez was Stabenchek’s supervisor? Explain.
 
b.  Do you think Lopez and others who are, for example, 
placed in charge of a store during shifts, should be con-
sidered a supervisor for purposes of Title VII sexual 
harassment liability? Explain. 
2. Truck driver Lesley Parkins claimed she was a victim of 
hostile environment sexual harassment while employed 
by Civil Constructors beginning in 1994. Parkins alleged that 
coworkers subjected her to foul language, sexual stories, 
and touching. Parkins complained to her dispatcher, Tim 
Spellman, and to one of her purported harassers, Robert 
Strong. She saw the job superintendent and the company 
EEO officer almost daily, but she did not complain to either. 
In 1996 Parkins filed a grievance with her union—Teamsters 
Local 325. The union contacted the company EEO officer, 
who immediately launched an investigation that led to pun-
ishment for the employees. Parkins conceded that she was 
not harassed following the company punishment.  Parkins 
filed suit charging Civil Constructors with sexual harass-
ment. Parkins claimed that two of her harassers, Strong and 
Charles Boeke, were foremen who supervised her work. 
 Assuming Parkins can prove that she was, in fact, sexually 
harassed, what must she prove in order to hold Civil 
 Constructors liable? See Parkins v. Civil Constructors of 
 Illinois, 163 F.3d 1027 (7th Cir. 1998).
3. Eileen Craig worked for the Mahoney Group as the 
branch manager in Tucson and reported to Leon Byrd, 
the interim president. Over the course of several months, 
Byrd made repeated inappropriate comments to Craig 
about her legs and how she should wear shorter skirts. 
Although Craig thought the comments were obnoxious, 
she was not particularly offended. At Byrd’s invitation, 
Craig met him for drinks after work at a restaurant, as 
they had done previously to discuss work-related mat-
ters. After Byrd made a sexual proposition, Craig laughed 
and shook her head but did not leave the restaurant. Byrd 
later followed Craig into the restaurant’s restroom, 
grabbed her and kissed her. Craig did not report this inci-
dent. Byrd made further advances to Craig which she re-
jected. At some point Byrd told Craig that he didn’t think 
he could work with her anymore. Craig finally reported 
Byrd’s conduct under the company’s sexual harassment 
policy. The company took immediate action: Byrd was in-
structed to stay away from Craig and to stop making sex-
ual comments to her, and Craig began reporting to 
another company executive. The investigator retained by 
the employer recommended, among other things, that 
Byrd receive a reprimand and training. At the end of the 
investigation, Craig began reporting again to Byrd.

 Eventually, Craig resigned and filed complaint asserting a 
Title VII sexual harassment claim. 
 
a. Is Mahoney liable for quid pro quo sexual harassment? 
What questions would you have if you were on the jury? 
Explain.
 
b. Is Mahoney liable for hostile work environment sexual 
harassment? What other facts might you need to know be-
fore deciding? Explain .
4. A female employed as an Installation and Repairs Techni-
cian claimed a hostile work environment was created in the 
garage in which she worked by the routine use of profanity, 
crude humor, vulgar graffiti depicting sexual acts, and 
 especially by sexually demeaning conversations conveying 
a profound disrespect for women. While the comments and 
graffiti demeaned some male employees, the conduct was 
directed at all the women working in the garage.
 
a.  In deciding whether the conduct constituted hostile en-
vironment sexual harassment, should the court evalu-
ate the facts from the point of view of a “reasonable 
person” or a “reasonable woman”? Explain.
 
b.  Why does it matter? See Petrosino v. Bell Atlantic, 385 
F.3d 210 (2d Cir. 2004); see also Ellison v. Brady, 924 F.2d

Consider the Source: Sexual Harassment at the Casino
While she was a bartender at Gold Strike Casino Resort in Tunica County, Mississippi, 
Debra Brockington allegedly was subjected to sexual harassment by her female supervisor, 
Wanda Haley, as well as her former boyfriend and coworker, Ed Ogden. The alleged 
 harassment included Haley grabbing Brockington’s breasts, making sexually suggestive 
remarks to others about Brockington, and snapping a towel against her buttocks. Brockington 
admitted to engaging in off-color conversations and conduct with her female coworkers. 
In her subsequent Title VII claim, a federal trial court, addressing Haley’s behavior, held 
that “within the context of the plaintiff’s work environment the alleged harassment in this 
case was neither severe nor pervasive.”
Questions
1. Do you agree with the court’s reasoning about the importance of workplace context in 
determining whether unlawful harassment has occurred? Explain.
2. In its ruling, the court said, “[C]asino bartenders have the same right as other employ-
ees to expect that they will not be subjected to unlawful harassment. . . .” What impact 
might the court’s ruling on workplace context have on the sexual harassment protec-
tions of casino bartenders and others working in similar environments?

 Same Sex? 
 Joseph Oncale, a heterosexual who worked on an offshore oil rig, charged a supervisor and 
two male coworkers with sexually harassing him, including repeated taunts and several 
sexual assaults, one with a bar of soap while Oncale was showering. Oncale complained to 
superiors, but to no avail. He then quit his job and sued his employer for sexual harass-
ment. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, which unanimously ruled that same-sex 

582  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
harassment is actionable under Title VII.  45   Oncale then settled out of court for an undis-
closed amount of money. Justice Scalia, who wrote the Supreme Court opinion, explained 
that the harassment must be “because of sex” (that is, gender); that harassment can be 
motivated by hostility as well as by desire; and that common sense and social context 
count. Thus, smacking a football teammate on the rear end, horseplay, roughhousing, or 
occasional gender-related jokes, teasing, and abusive language normally would not consti-
tute harassment. Ordinarily, plaintiffs in same-sex harassment cases must show that the 
behavior was motivated by (a) sexual desire, (b) general hostility to one or other gender, or 
(c) the victim’s failure to conform to sexual stereotypes (such as  effeminate behavior by a 
male). [For an analysis of the significance of the  Oncale  case, see http://reason.com
/ archives/2003/01/01/man-trouble] 
 Oncale  settles the big question of protection against same-sex 
harassment, but it raises other puzzles. For example, what if the har-
asser bothers both genders equally? 
 After  Oncale , a husband and wife, who were also coworkers, 
brought a Title VII claim against their employer alleging that their supervisor had harassed 
both of them by soliciting sex from each of them on separate occasions. The federal ap-
peals court affirmed the district court’s dismissal, concluding that the “equal opportunity 
harasser” does not give rise to a Title VII sex discrimination complaint.  46 
 Sexual Harassment in Other Nations 
 American managers working abroad must deal with international differences in atti-
tudes toward sexual behavior in the workplace, although a general shift in harassment 
law in the direction of the American model is evident. This shift is significant for the 
American  manager working abroad for a U.S.-based company, or a foreign employer 
controlled by an American company. The Civil Rights Act of 1991 extends Title VII’s 
protection to American employees working abroad for such employers, but offers a 
“foreign law  defense” under which the employer would not be required to comply with 
Title VII if doing so would violate the host country’s law. 47 The European Union has 
adopted laws requiring harassment-free workplaces. 48 In Japan, sexual harassment law 
resembles the U.S. model.  49 In China, a woman who is sexually harassed in her work-
place may file a complaint with the police under China’s Protection of Rights and Inter-
ests of Women law. 50  
 Retaliation 
 The power in an employment relationship often is unbalanced in favor of the employer. In 
bringing a discrimination claim, an employee is vulnerable to the employer’s retaliatory 
action. In order to protect against an employer’s abuse of power and to encourage exercise 
of employees’ rights, Title VII’s antiretaliation provision prohibits an employer from 
 discriminating against an employee for engaging in a protected activity. Protected  activities 
include opposing an employment practice that is reasonably believed to violate Title VII, or 
participating in a complaint made under Title VII, such as filing a charge of workplace 
discrimination. Other civil rights laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act 
What if the harasser bothers 
both genders equally?

Chapter Thirteen  Employment Law II: Discrimination 583
(ADA), the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and the Civil Rights Act of 
1866, offer similar protections against retaliation.  
 
 A prima facie case of retaliation requires: 
 1. Participation in a protected activity. 
 2. An employment action disadvantaging the plaintiff. 
 3. A causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.  
 
  In several recent cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has addressed Title VII’s antiretalia-
tion protection. In   Crawford v. Metropolitan Gov’t of Nashville & Davidson County , 51 
Court held that employees who respond to questions about workplace discrimination 
during the employer’s informal investigation are engaged in protected activity under 
Title VII’s antiretaliation provision, even if they did not make the complaint being in-
vestigated. In  Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway v. White , 52   the U.S. Supreme 
Court, recognizing that a broad range of employer conduct could discourage the reason-
able employee from exercising Title VII rights, held that assigning a complainant to less 
desirable duties is an adverse employment action on which a Title VII retaliation claim 
may be based.   In 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court held in  Thompson v. North American 
Stainless 53 that an employee is protected against retaliation resulting when his fiancée 
and  coworker file a Title VII claim, noting that it was “obvious” that a reasonable worker 
might hesitate to exercise Title VII rights if it would cause the person who he or she in-
tended to marry to be fired.  
 
After these employee-friendly rulings, the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2013 decision in Uni-
versity of Texas Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar created a higher standard for re-
taliation claims than applied to “status discrimination” claims such as, for example, gender 
or national origin.54 Dr. Naiel Nassar, a physician of Middle Eastern descent who was both 
a medical school faculty member and a staff physician at the school’s affiliated hospital, 
complained to his department chair, Dr. Fitz, that one of Dr. Nassar’s other supervisors, 
Dr. Levine, was biased against him based on national origin and religion. Dr. Nassar ar-
ranged to continue working as a hospital staff physician without being a member of the 
medical school’s faculty, and sent a resignation letter to Dr. Fitz and several others ex-
plaining that he was resigning owing to Dr. Levine’s harassment. Upset at the letter’s state-
ments regarding Dr. Levine, Dr. Fitz objected to the hospital’s arrangement with 
Dr. Nassar, asserting that it violated the hospital’s affiliation agreement with the medical 
school under which its staff physicians were exclusively the school’s faculty members; the 
offer was withdrawn. Dr. Nassar’s resulting Title VII lawsuit included a retaliation claim 
based on Dr. Fitz’s actions to stop his hospital employment because he had complained. A 
federal appellate court affirmed the trial court’s finding of retaliation, as the evidence sup-
ported the conclusion that Dr. Fitz was, at least in part, motivated to retaliate against 
Dr. Nassar for his complaints. The U.S. Supreme Court reversed, interpreting Title VII’s 
antiretaliation provision as requiring “but for” causation. Here, Dr. Nassar’s continued 
employment with the hospital would have violated the hospital’s affiliation agreement 
with the medical school, which arguably would have caused the medical school’s objec-
tion to and ultimate withdrawal of Nassar’s offer.

 Part Four—Affirmative Action 
 Some viewed the 2008 election of Barack Obama, the first African-American president of the 
United States, as evidence that the racism staining the country’s history was no longer an 
 urgent concern. Therefore, it was argued,  affirmative action efforts on behalf of minorities 
and women could be reduced or eliminated. However, a 2009  Washington Post/ABC News 
poll revealed that nearly half of African Americans and almost a quarter of white  Americans 
continued to see racism as a significant social problem.  55   In the wake of a 2013 U.S. 
 Supreme Court opinion that did not offer a definitive answer on whether race-based prefer-
ential treatment in college admissions are constitutional, a Pew Research Center poll found 
Americans deeply divided on affirmative action.56  
 
In following an affirmative action plan, employers consciously take positive steps to 
seek out minorities and women for hiring and promotion opportunities, and they often 
employ goals and timetables to measure progress toward a workforce that is representative 
of the qualified labor pool. Affirmative action is a means of remedying past and present 
discriminatory wrongs in a more expeditious and thorough manner than the market might 
achieve on its own. 
 
Affirmative action efforts arise in four ways: (1) Courts may order the implementation 
of affirmative action after a finding of wrongful discrimination, (2) employers may volun-
tarily adopt affirmative action plans, (3) some statutes require affirmative action, and 
(4) employers may adopt affirmative action in order to do business with government agen-
cies.  Federal contractors must meet the affirmative action standards of the Office of Fed-
eral Contract Compliance Programs. [For criticisms of affirmative action, see the Center 
for Equal Opportunity at   www.ceousa.org ] 
 Early Affirmative Action Law 
 For nearly 20 years, judicial decisions were firmly supportive of affirmative action.  A massive 
system of remedies emerged at all levels of government and in the private sector. In a 1979 
case,  United Steelworkers of America v. Weber , 57 the U.S. Supreme Court set out perhaps 
its most detailed “recipe” for those qualities that would allow a voluntary affirmative 
 action plan in the private sector to withstand scrutiny. Weber, a white male, challenged the 
legality of an affirmative action plan that set aside for black employees 50 percent of the 
openings in a training program until the percentage of black craft workers in the plant 
equaled the  percentage of blacks in the local labor market. The plan was the product of a 
collective bargaining agreement between the Steelworkers and Kaiser Aluminum and 
Chemical. In Kaiser’s Grammercy, Louisiana, plant, only 5 of 273 skilled craft workers 
were black, whereas the local workforce was approximately 39 percent black. In the first 
year of the affirmative action plan, seven blacks and six whites were admitted to the craft 
training program. The most junior black employee accepted for the program had less 
 seniority than several white employees who were not accepted. Weber was among the 
white males  denied entry to the training program.  

Chapter Thirteen  Employment Law II: Discrimination 585
 Rethinking Affirmative Action 
 From the late 1980s to the present, a series of judicial decisions and increasing public and 
political skepticism have challenged the legality and the wisdom of affirmative action, at 
least where the government is involved. The 1989  City of Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co. 59 
case struck down Richmond, Virginia’s, minority “set-aside” program that required prime 
contractors who were doing business with the city to subcontract at least 30 percent of the 
work to minority businesses. The Court said such race-conscious remedial plans were 
constitutional only if (1) the city or state could provide specific evidence of discrimina-
tion against a particular protected class in the past (rather than relying on proof of gen-
eral societywide discrimination) and (2) its remedy was “narrowly tailored” to the needs 
of the situation.  
 
Then in  Adarand Constructors v. Pena , a landmark 1995 decision, the Supreme Court 
struck down a federal highway program that extended bidding preferences to “disadvan-
taged” contractors. 60   The suit was brought by Randy Pech, a white contractor whose low 
bid on a Colorado guardrail project was rejected in favor of the bid of a minority firm. The 
Supreme Court ruled that the government’s preference program denied Pech his right to 
equal protection under the law as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the federal Con-
stitution. [For a “Timeline of Affirmative Action Milestones,” see  www.infoplease.com
/spot/affirmativetimeline1.html]  
 
In the 2009  Ricci v. DeStefano decision that follows, the U.S. Supreme Court addressed 
the dilemma employers sometimes face in using hiring and promotion tests that may have 
a disparate impact on some groups of employees.  
 
Weber filed suit, claiming Title VII forbade an affirmative action plan that granted a 
racial preference to blacks where whites dramatically exceeded blacks in skilled craft posi-
tions but where there was no proof of discrimination. The federal district court and the 
federal court of appeals held for Weber, but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed. Several 
qualities of the Steelworkers’ plan were instrumental in the Court’s favorable ruling:  
 1. The affirmative action was part of a plan. 
 2. The plan was designed to “open employment opportunities for Negroes in occupations 
which have been traditionally closed to them.”  
 3. The plan was temporary. 
 4. The plan did not unnecessarily harm the rights of white employees. That is, 
 a. The plan did not require the discharge of white employees. 
 b. The plan did not create an absolute bar to the advancement of white employees. 
 
 Then, in an important 1987 public-sector decision,  Johnson v. Transportation Agency , 58 
the Supreme Court approved the extension of affirmative action to women. The political 
tides were turning, however. The 1980s were politically conservative years. Appointments 
to the Supreme Court and to the lower federal courts, by President Reagan in particular, 
reflected that mood. Affirmative action was under attack.

 Under the [union] contract, applicants for lieutenant and cap-
tain positions were to be screened using written and oral exami-
nations, with the written exam accounting for 60 percent and the 
oral exam 40 percent of an applicant’s total score. To sit for the 
examinations, candidates for lieutenant needed 30 months’ ex-
perience in the Department, a high-school diploma, and certain 
vocational training courses. Candidates for  captain needed one 
year’s service as a lieutenant in the  Department, a high-school 
diploma, and certain vocational training courses.  
 * * * * * 
 
  The City hired Industrial/Organizational Solutions, Inc. (IOS) 
to develop and administer the examinations, at a cost to the City 
of $100,000. IOS is an Illinois company that specializes in design-
ing entry-level and promotional examinations for fire and police 
departments. In order to fit the examinations to the New Haven 
Department, IOS began the test-design process by performing 
job analyses to identify the tasks, knowledge, skills, and abilities 
that are essential for the lieutenant and captain positions.  
 * * * * * 
 
 At every stage of the job analyses, IOS, by deliberate choice, 
oversampled minority firefighters to ensure that the results  -
which IOS would use to develop the examinations -would not 
unintentionally favor white candidates. With the job-analysis 
information in hand, IOS developed the written examinations to 
measure the candidates’ job-related knowledge.  
 * * * * * 
 
 After IOS prepared the tests, the City opened a 3-month 
study period. It gave candidates a list that identified the source 
material for the questions, including the specific chapters from 
which the questions were taken. IOS developed the oral exami-
nations as well. These concentrated on job skills and abilities.  
 * * * * * 
 
 Candidates took the examinations in November and Decem-
ber 2003. Seventy-seven candidates completed the lieutenant 
 examination—43 whites, 19 blacks, and 15 Hispanics. Of those, 
34 candidates passed—25 whites, 6 blacks, and 3 Hispanics. 
Eight lieutenant positions were vacant at the time of the 
 examination. Under the rule of three, this meant that the top 10 
candidates were eligible for an immediate promotion to lieuten-
ant. All 10 were white.

 In 2003, 118 New Haven [Connecticut] firefighters took examina-
tions to qualify for promotion to the rank of lieutenant or 
 captain. . . . The results would determine which firefighters would 
be considered for promotions during the next two years, and the 
order in which they would be considered. Many firefighters stud-
ied for months, at considerable personal and financial cost.  
 
 When the examination results showed that white candi-
dates had outperformed minority candidates, the mayor and 
other local politicians opened a public debate that turned ran-
corous. Some firefighters argued the tests should be dis-
carded because the results showed the tests to be 
discriminatory. They threatened a discrimination lawsuit if the 
City made promotions based on the tests. Other firefighters 
said the exams were neutral and fair. And they, in turn, threat-
ened a discrimination lawsuit if the City, relying on the statisti-
cal racial disparity, ignored the test results and denied 
promotions to the candidates who had performed well. In the 
end the City took the side of those who protested the test re-
sults. It threw out the examinations.  
 
 Certain white and Hispanic firefighters who likely would 
have been promoted based on their good test performance 
sued the City and some of its officials. Theirs is the suit now 
before us. The suit alleges that, by discarding the test results, 
the City and the named officials discriminated against the 
plaintiffs based on their race, in violation of. . . . Title VII of the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964. . . . The City and the officials defended 
their actions, arguing that if they had certified the results, they 
could have faced liability under Title VII for adopting a prac-
tice that had a disparate impact on the minority firefighters.

 The [City] charter establishes a merit system. That system re-
quires the City to fill vacancies in the classified civil-service 
ranks with the most qualified individuals, as determined by 
job-related examinations. After each examination, the New 
Haven Civil Service Board (CSB) certifies a ranked list of 
applicants who passed the test. Under the charter’s “rule of 
three,” the relevant hiring authority must fill each vacancy by 
choosing one candidate from the top three scorers on the list.

 [The City decided] not to certify the results.

 The [City’s] decision not to certify the examination results led 
to this lawsuit. The plaintiffs—who are the petitioners here—
are 17 white firefighters and 1 Hispanic firefighter who passed 
the examinations but were denied a chance at promotions 
when the [City] refused to certify the test results. They include 
the named plaintiff, Frank Ricci. . . .  
 
 Petitioners . . . filed timely charges of discrimination with 
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC); . . . as-
serting that the City violated the disparate-treatment prohibi-
tion contained in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. . . .  
 Respondents [the defendants] asserted they had a good-faith 
belief that they would have violated the disparate impact 
 prohibition in Title VII . . . had they certified the examination 
results. It follows, they maintained, that they cannot be  held 
liable under Title VII’s disparate-treatment provision for 
 attempting to comply with Title VII’s disparate-impact bar. 
 Petitioners countered that respondents’ good-faith belief was 
not a valid defense to allegations of disparate treatment. . . .  
 
 The District Court granted summary judgment for 
 respondents. . . . The Court of Appeals affirmed. . . .  
 II 
 B (A OMITTED-ED.) 
 Petitioners allege that when the [City] refused to certify the 
captain and lieutenant exam results based on the race of the 
successful candidates, it discriminated against them in viola-
tion of Title VII’s disparate-treatment provision. The City coun-
ters that its decision was permissible because the tests 
“appear[ed] to violate Title VII’s disparate-impact  provisions.” 
 
 Our analysis begins with this premise: The City’s actions 
would violate the disparate-treatment prohibition of Title VII 
absent some valid defense. All the evidence demonstrates that 
the City chose not to certify the examination results because of 
the statistical disparity based on race  —i.e., how minority 
 candidates had performed when compared to white 
 candidates.       . . .  
 
 We consider, therefore, whether the purpose to avoid 
 disparate-impact liability excuses what otherwise would be 
prohibited disparate-treatment discrimination.  
 * * * * * 
 
 If an employer cannot rescore a test based on the candi-
dates’ race, then it follows . . . . that it may not take the greater 
step of discarding the test altogether to achieve a more desir-
able racial distribution of promotion-eligible candidates  - 
absent a strong basis in evidence that the test was deficient 
and that discarding the results is necessary to avoid violating 
the disparate-impact provision.  . . . 
 
  For the foregoing reasons, we adopt the strong-basis-in-
evidence standard as a matter of statutory construction to re-
solve any conflict between the disparate-treatment and 
disparate-impact provisions of Title VII.  
 * * * * * 
 
 Title VII does not prohibit an employer from considering, be-
fore administering a test or practice, how to design that test or 
practice in order to provide a fair opportunity for all individuals, 
regardless of their race. . . . We hold only that,  under Title VII, 
before an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for 
the asserted purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional 
disparate impact, the employer must have a strong basis in evi-
dence to believe it will be subject to disparate-impact liability if 
it fails to take the race-conscious, discriminatory action.  
 * * * * * 
 C 
 The City argues that, even under the strong-basis-in-evidence 
standard, its decision to discard the examination results was 
permissible under Title VII. That is incorrect.  
 * * * * * 
 
 . . . .[T]here is no evidence—let alone the required strong 
basis in evidence—the tests were flawed because they were 
not job-related or because other, equally valid and less 
 discriminatory tests were available to the City. Fear of  litigation 
alone cannot justify an employer’s reliance on race to the 
 detriment of individuals who passed the examination and 
qualified for promotions. The City’s discarding the test results 
was impermissible under Title VII. . . .  
 
 Our holding today clarifies how Title VII applies to resolve 
competing expectations under the disparate-treatment and 
disparate-impact provisions. If, after it certifies the test 
 results, the City faces a disparate-impact suit, then in light of 
our holding today it should be clear that the City would avoid

disparate-impact liability based on the strong basis in 
 evidence that, had it not certified the results, it would have 
been subject to disparate-treatment liability.

 4. In 1974, Birmingham, Alabama, was accused of unlawfully 
excluding blacks from management roles in its fire depart-
ment. After several years of litigation, Birmingham adopted 
an affirmative action plan that guaranteed black firefighters 
one of every two available promotions. The city, the Justice 
Department, and others applauded the arrangement, but a 
group of 14 white firefighters claimed they were victims of 
reverse discrimination. After years of wrangling, the white 
firefighters’ claim reached the 11th Circuit Federal Court of 
Appeals. Was the affirmative action plan lawful? Explain.

American firefighter for the city of New Haven who applied

 Affirmative Action: Where Are We? 
 Some confusion remains after  Ricci , given differences in analysis between cases based on 
the Constitution and those brought under Title VII, 61 and whether those cases address 
 employers’ screening, set-asides, or other practices. What has 
been made clear is that both quotas and affirmative action justified 
broadly by “societal discrimination” are  unconstitutional.  
 
A lawful affirmative action remedy in employment cases apparently will be evaluated, 
in most cases, by the following considerations:  
 • The plan addresses a compelling interest such as remedying past or present discrimina-
tion or correcting the underutilization of women and minorities.  
 • The plan is temporary. 
 • The plan is narrowly tailored to minimize layoffs and other burdens. 
 
 In  Ricci,  the U.S. Supreme Court noted that employers could still make “affirmative 
efforts” to encourage equal opportunity in promotions. 62 While ensuring that screening 
procedures are not discriminatory or irrelevant,  63   employers may undertake diversity 
 initiatives designed to create an inclusive workplace environment that supports fairness, 
respect, and equal opportunity. [For information on diversity programs at U.S. companies,

Quotas are unconstitutional.

Chapter Thirteen  Employment Law II: Discrimination 589
 Part Five—Additional Discrimination Topics 
 Religious Discrimination 
  Kimberly Cloutier was employed as a cashier at Costco in West Springfield,  Massachusetts. 
The store revised its dress code in 2001 to prohibit all facial jewelry other than earrings. 
Cloutier, a member of the “Church of Body Modification,” was ad-
vised to remove her  facial piercings. She declined to do so saying 
that her piercings were part of her religion. The church’s approxi-
mately 1,000 members engaged in such practices as piercing, 
 tattooing, branding, and cutting. Eventually, Cloutier was fired. She sued Costco claiming 
she was a victim of religious discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act 
of 1964. Costco, however, prevailed when the federal First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 
in 2004 that excusing Cloutier from the dress code would be an undue hardship for Costco 
because the company had a legitimate interest in presenting to the public a workforce that 
was reasonably professional in appearance. 64 
 The Law 
 Title VII’s protections against religious discrimination and harassment in the workplace in-
clude the employer’s duty to reasonably accommodate employees’ religious beliefs and prac-
tices. As was evident in Cloutier’s conflict with Costco, reasonably accommodating religious 
practices often poses challenges for employers. Consider, for example, the employer who 
must balance an employee’s religious practice of proselytizing or discussing religion in the 
workplace against other employees’ right to be free from  religious harassment.  
 
Employers need not accommodate an employee’s religious practice or belief if it  creates 
an “undue hardship”—an unreasonable burden—on the workplace. The leading religious 
discrimination case is  Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Hardison , in which the plaintiff, who 
celebrated his religion on Saturdays, was unable to take that day off from his work in a parts 
warehouse. 65 Efforts to swap shifts or change jobs were unsuccessful. The company re-
jected Hardison’s request for a four-day week because it would have  required the use of 
another employee at premium pay. The Supreme Court’s ruling in the case reduced the 
employer’s duty to a very modest standard: “To require TWA to bear more than a   de mini-
mis   cost in order to give Hardison Saturdays off is an  undue  hardship .” Saturdays off for 
Hardison would have imposed extra costs on TWA and would have constituted religious 
discrimination against other employees who would have sought  Saturday off for reasons not 
grounded in religion. So any accommodation imposing more than a  de minimis   cost on the 
employer represents an undue hardship and is not required by Title VII. Of course, the 
lower courts have  differed considerably on what constitutes a  de minimis cost and an undue 
hardship. For example, an Ohio court ruled that an employee, a Seventh Day Adventist, was 
 discriminated against when he was fired for refusing to work from sundown Friday to sun-
down Saturday. The employee could have been moved to an earlier shift at no cost. 66  
   
An employer might be unsure whether employees who request accommodation are 
 sincere in their religious beliefs or merely seeking an advantage such as a longer break or 
A member of the “Church of 
Body Modification.”

trying to avoid workplace requirements under attendance or grooming policies. The EEOC 
defines religion broadly as “moral and ethical beliefs of what is right and wrong which are 
sincerely held with the strength of religious views.” 67 This broad view of religious beliefs 
arguably indicates that employers should err in favor of moving forward to the central 
 issue: Is an accommodation reasonable or would it create an undue hardship? 
 Questions 
 1. Resolving job-related religious conflicts can be among the most emotionally  demanding 
management dilemmas. For example, what challenges would you face as a manager if 
one of your subordinates, as an expression of her religious beliefs, wore to work an an-
tiabortion button displaying a picture of a fetus? How would you address these chal-
lenges? See  Wilson v. U.S. West Communications , 58 F.3d 1337 (8th Cir. 1995).  
 2. Yisrael worked as a dump truck driver for a North Carolina company providing paving, 
grading, and utility services for transportation projects. As a member of the Hebrew Israelite 
faith, Yisrael observed Sabbath on Saturday. After refusing to work three different Satur-
days, he was terminated. The EEOC filed a lawsuit on behalf of Yisrael. What further infor-
mation would you need to decide this case? Explain. See EEOC v. Thompson Contracting, 
Grading, Paving, & Utilities, Inc. 499 Fed. Appx. 275 (4th Cir. 2012) (unpub’d op.).  
3. An Oklahoma lighting company, Voss, advertised a vacancy for an “operations supervi-
sor” position at its Tulsa location through the website of a Tulsa-area church attended by 
a Voss supervisor. Wolfe, who had prior operations management experience, learned 
about the vacancy and applied for the position although he did not himself attend the 
church. Most of the job interview concerned Wolfe’s religious activities and beliefs and 
whether he “would have a problem” coming into work early to attend Bible study before 
clocking in. The branch manager seemed hesitant to accept Wolf’s answers as truthful. 
At the time Wolfe was interviewed, Voss had no viable candidates for the position being 
filled. Wolfe was not offered the job, and after continuing its search, the company hired 
an individual whose religious ideology matched that of the company’s leadership. Wolfe 
filed an EEOC religious discrimination complaint.68  Decide. Explain.
 The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
 As a child, Edward Carmona was diagnosed with psoriasis, a skin disease causing intermit-
tent but treatable inflammations. As an adult working as a flight attendant for Southwest 
Airlines, Carmona was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, which causes painful joint swelling 
and stiffness during attacks of psoriasis. Although medication eased some of his discomfort, 
these attacks left Carmona unable to walk without great pain for one-half to one-third of each 
month. After his intermittent leave under Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA—
see  Chapter 12) expired, he was fired for excessive absenteeism. Carmona brought a disabil-
ity discrimination claim against Southwest Airlines under the Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA), winning a jury verdict that was vacated by the federal trial court. A federal ap-
peals court overturned the federal trial court’s decision to vacate the jury’s award, concluding 
that Southwest Airlines attendance policy was extremely lenient, and the jury could have 
reasonably found other nondisabled flight attendants with similar  absenteeism not being 
fired, and that Carmona’s supervisors were annoyed by his disability-related absences. 69  

Chapter Thirteen  Employment Law II: Discrimination 591
 
This situation illustrates the general purpose of the ADA, which seeks to remove barri-
ers to a full, productive life for individuals with disabilities. The ADA forbids discrimina-
tion in employment, public accommodations, public services, transportation, and 
telecommunications. Small businesses with fewer than 15 employees are exempted from 
the employment portions of the ADA. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 protects public sec-
tor workers with disabilities from employment discrimination.  
 
Under the ADA, a qualified individual who (1) has a physical or mental impairment that 
substantially limits one or more major life activities, (2) has a record of such an impair-
ment, or (3) is regarded as having such an impairment may not be discriminated against in 
employment.  
 
In a series of decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court narrowed the scope of the ADA, 
prompting a leading disabilities rights advocate to call the ADA “the incredible shrinking 
law.” 70   In response, the Americans with Disabilities Amendments Act (ADAAA) was 
passed by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2008 to overturn 
those decisions and establish broader definitional guidelines under the ADA.  
 Defining Disabilities 
 As amended by the ADAAA, the ADA emphasizes that “disability” should be defined 
broadly in offering protection from employment discrimination. Examples of such dis-
abilities include epilepsy, hypertension, asthma, diabetes, major  depressive disorder, 
bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. A nonexhaustive list of  major life activities spec-
ified by the ADAAA includes eating, sleeping, standing, lifting, bending, concentrat-
ing, thinking, communicating, and all major bodily functions, including reproduction.  
 
Alcoholism, drug addiction, and AIDS are disabilities under the ADA. However, the 
ADA excludes from its protection job applicants and employees who  currently use illegal 
drugs. Employees with past drug or alcohol problems are protected by the ADA, as are em-
ployees with current alcohol problems who are able to perform the essential functions of the 
job. An employer may lawfully take an adverse employment action on the basis of, for ex-
ample, a drug test showing use of illegal controlled substances or alcohol-induced unprofes-
sional conduct at work. Those who are rehabilitated or are currently in rehabilitation are 
protected from disabilities discrimination. In sum, the ADA treats alcoholism and drug ad-
diction as medical conditions and protects those who are overcoming these impairments.  
 
Taking medication or using a prosthetic device to overcome an impairment does not 
exclude an individual from the ADA’s protection. Episodic conditions such as epilepsy, if 
creating a “substantial limitation” on an individual’s major life activities, ordinarily would 
be covered by the ADA. In addition, an impairment in  remission, such as cancer, is cov-
ered if it would substantially limit a major life activity when active.  71 
 “Regarded as Having” a Disability 
 An individual who does not have a disability may still be protected under the ADA. If an 
employer incorrectly assumes that an applicant or employee has a disability, and then takes 
discriminatory action on that basis, the employer has violated the ADA. For  example, an 
employer who denies an employee a promotion to a managerial position  requiring exten-
sive client contact is likely to have violated the ADA if the promotion was denied because 
of the employer’s mistaken belief that the employee is a recovering alcoholic who would 
not be able to manage client meetings where alcohol is frequently served.  

592  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 Accommodating Individuals with Disabilities 
 An employer may not discriminate in hiring or employment against a  qualified person with a 
disability . A qualified person is one who can perform the  essential job functions with or with-
out  reasonable accommodation . The ADA requires employers to make reasonable accom-
modations for disabled employees and applicants. Reasonable accommodations might include 
structural changes in the workplace, job reassignment, job restructuring, or new equipment. 
Employers are not required to provide an accommodation that would create an  undue hard-
ship  . For example, the employer need not create a new position to reassign an employee who 
can no longer perform the essential job functions, but rather should place the employee in an 
appropriate vacant job. The employer should engage in an interactive dialogue with the em-
ployee to explore possible reasonable accommodations. [For EEOC advice about small em-
ployers and reasonable accommodation, see  www.eeoc.gov/facts/accommodation.html ]  
 “Getting to Work” with Reasonable Accommodation 
  Jeanette Colwell was hired as a part-time retail clerk at a Rite Aid store in Old Forge, 
Pennsylvania. She worked various shifts, including 5 pm to 9 pm, and she earned 
 supervisors’ recognition for good performance. A few months after being hired,  Colwell 
was diagnosed with “retinal vein occlusion and glaucoma in her left eye,” and eventually 
she became blind in that eye. Colwell informed her supervisor, Susan Chapman, that her 
partial blindness made it dangerous and difficult for her to drive to work at night. She 
asked to be assigned to day shifts only so that she would be able to get to work. (Bus ser-
vice stopped at 6 pm, and there were no taxis serving the area where the store was located.) 
Chapman refused the request because it “wouldn’t be fair” to other workers, and she con-
tinued to schedule Colwell for a mix of day and evening shifts. Colwell later sent Chapman 
a doctor’s note recommending that Colwell not drive at night, but Chapman was still un-
willing to assign Colwell to day shifts only. Colwell resigned and brought an ADA claim 
against Rite Aid. The federal trial court ruled that Rite Aid had no duty to accommodate 
Colwell because she was able to  perform all her work duties at the store; Colwell appealed. 
 Questions 
 1. Is Colwell an “individual with a disability” under the ADA? Explain. 
 2. How should Chapman have responded to Colwell’s request? Explain. 
  3.   A part-time retail clerk who is unable to drive because he is “legally blind” requests 
a late arrival to his shift due to a long bus commute. The store manager refuses his 
 request, and subsequently terminates him for being late to work on a number of 
 occasions. The clerk brings an ADA claim against his former employer. Decide. 
Explain.

 The ADA in Practice 
 In early 2014, the unemployment rate for individuals with a disability was 14.3  percent 
compared with 6.8 percent for those without a disability. 72 A greater disparity exists in 
the level of participation in the labor force, defined by those employed and those who are 
unemployed but looking for work. Although over two-thirds of working-age Americans 

Chapter Thirteen  Employment Law II: Discrimination 593
with no disability participate in the labor force, the labor participation rate for those with a 
disability is less than 20 percent .73 Some employers may hesitate to hire workers with 
disabilities out of misconceptions and fear of added costs for accommodations. 74 How-
ever, in recent years companies have made efforts to  increase the presence of individu-
als with disabilities in the professional workforce. For example, the National Business 
& Disability Council runs “Emerging Leaders,” a summer internship program offering 
business placements for college and graduate  students with disabilities.  75 [For more 
information, see Emerging Leaders at  www.emerging-leaders.com/ ]  
   
Tax credits to hire and provide access to individuals with disabilities, as well as tax 
deductions to remove architectural barriers to make its facilities more accessible, also pro-
vide incentives for employers to hire and retain employees with disabilities.  76 
 
On the other hand, under federal regulations that became effective in 2014, federal con-
tractors that have a workforce with less than 7 percent disabled workers or that do not take 
steps to achieve that goal could face penalties, including losing their contracts.77
 Rosa’s Law: Changing the Words 
 Rosa’s Law, named after Rosa Marcellino, a 9-year-old with Down Syndrome, changes 
the language in all federal health, education, and labor laws to remove the phrase 
 “mentally retarded” and replace it with “intellectual disability.” President Obama has 
quoted Rosa’s brother Nick as saying: “What you call people is how you treat them. If 
we change the words, maybe it will be the start of a new attitude towards people with 
disabilities.”

 ADA Questions 
 1. Core, a social services worker, had difficulty breathing at work when she was exposed 
to the perfume Japanese Cherry Blossom, worn by coworkers; on one occasion, she 
sought emergency medical treatment. Core’s coworkers allegedly mocked her condition 
on their Facebook pages. Her employer rejected several of her accommodation requests, 
including a proposed fragrance-free workplace policy. The employer sent an e-mail 
message to employees asking that they not enter into Core’s cubicle but to communi-
cate with her instead by telephone and e-mail only, and asked Core to hold office dis-
cussions in better ventilated areas. After exhausting her FMLA leave entitlements (see 
Chapter 12), Core was placed on inactive pay status.  The employer offered to permit 
Core to return to work and make such accommodations as instructing staff to refrain 
from wearing Japanese Cherry Blossom, and allowing her to take breaks to get fresh air.

 2. Foley was terminated from his job as a financial advisor with Morgan Stanley after he 
removed and took away the central processing unit (CPU)—including the hard drive—
from his office computer without authorization, and was not truthful about his actions 
for several days after doing so. Morgan Stanley’s employment policies and procedures 
forbid the removal of its “trade secrets,” defined as including computer software or 
hardware used in computers or word processors. Foley admitted he was terminated be-
cause of his misconduct but argued that his actions in taking the computer and being 
untruthful were caused by a manic episode of bipolar disorder. Therefore, in bringing 
an ADA claim against Morgan Stanley, Foley argued that the resulting termination was 
“because of” his disability. Decide. Explain. See Foley v. Morgan Stanley Smith Bar-
ney, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 28873 (S.D. Fla. 2013).   
 Genetic Testing 
 Genetic testing in the workplace and its discriminatory effects have been addressed by the 
EEOC. In 2002, the Burlington Northern & Santa Fe Railway Co. agreed to pay 36 work-
ers $2.2 million for the railway’s use of a genetic testing program, which, without the 
workers’ knowledge, identified predispositions to carpal tunnel syndrome. In 2008, 
 Congress and the president approved the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act 
(GINA) that prohibits employers from discriminating because of genetic information. 
With few exceptions, employers are not allowed to gather genetic information regarding 
an employee or the  employee’s family members.  78 
 
For example, as the EEOC notes in its enforcement guidance on GINA, using “family 
medical history” as a basis for an employment decision because of an increased risk of 
heart disease in the future would be unlawful because it is not relevant to the individual’s 
“current ability to work.” 79 
 Age Discrimination 
 Can a clothing store featuring styles designed for the college market lawfully prefer youth-
ful salespersons? May a marketing firm reject older applicants in an effort to bring “new 
blood” into its workforce? While these questions are not definitively resolved, employers 
taking such actions might face liability for age discrimination.  
 ADEA Claims The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) protects those 
40 years and older from employment discrimination based on their age. Disparate treat-
ment and harassment claims may be brought under the ADEA, and a 2005 Supreme Court 
decision extended ADEA protection to disparate impact claims also. 80  In its 2009  Gross v. 
FBL   decision, the U.S. Supreme Court made it more difficult to win an ADEA disparate 
treatment claim. 81 Jack Gross had worked for FBL for over 30 years when at age 54 he was 
reassigned from Claims Administration Director to Coordinator, while his former duties 
were transferred to a younger worker whom he had supervised. Gross filed an ADEA 
claim against FBL claiming the demotion violated the ADEA, and he won a jury verdict 
after showing that his age played a role in FBL’s decision. FBL appealed. The U.S. 

Chapter Thirteen  Employment Law II: Discrimination 595
 Supreme Court held that an ADEA disparate treatment claim requires the plaintiff to show 
that age was not just one factor, but the deciding or “but-for” factor in the employer’s 
 decision. 82   The proposed Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act, which 
would have reversed Gross, was introduced in Congress but was not enacted. 
 Defenses  The employer may defend against an age discrimination claim by showing that 
the termination was based on a  legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason (such as poor perfor-
mance) or that age is a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ). For example, if there is 
no test available to predict when a commercial airline pilot over 60 years of age might expe-
rience a medical emergency that could jeopardize aviation safety, then being under 60 years 
of age is arguably a BFOQ for that job.83 The ADEA also provides that an employer can de-
feat an age discrimination claim by demonstrating that a “reasonable factor other than age” 
(like poor attendance) was the actual reason for terminating or otherwise disfavoring an older 
worker. In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an employer using this defense in a dispa-
rate impact case carries the burden of proving a “reasonable factor other than age.”  84  
 Reverse Age Discrimination? 
 Being young is cool, but younger workers may get cold treatment in the workplace. 
Younger workers often seem to take the brunt of layoffs. Recently, the unemployment rate 
for those between the ages of 25 and 34 was 9.6 percent as compared with 6.5 percent for 
those 55 or older. Fear of ADEA lawsuits may be one reason companies use seniority to 
determine who will be retained in a reduction in force.  
 Question 
 Should the ADEA protect against age discrimination, regardless of age? Explain.

 Sexual Orientation Discrimination 
 In April 2014, just days after his appointment as CEO, Brendan Eich resigned from 
 Mozilla after employees complained about his opposition to same-sex marriage as shown 
by his 2008 political donation to support a ban on gay marriage that had surfaced on the 
Internet. Mozilla’s executive chair, Mitchell Baker, apologized for the appointment, saying 
that Mozilla had failed “to listen, to engage, and to be guided by our community.” 85 While 
this situation has raised concerns over the political rights of corporate executives, it also 
underscores how the debate over sexual orientation discrimination in the workplace has 
shifted. 
 
 At this writing, federal law does not offer protection against discrimination on the basis 
of an employee’s sexual orientation. The courts have consistently ruled that Title VII’s 
prohibition of discrimination based on sex refers to gender only, and not sexual orienta-
tion. In 2013, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA), which would prohibit 
employers from discriminating on the basis of an employee’s actual or perceived sexual 
orientation was reintroduced and passed the Senate, after having been proposed but not 
enacted over the years.86 At this writing, political support for ENDA appears to be stronger 
than in the past. A 2013 poll showed that a majority of Americans support legal protection 
against employment discrimination based on sexual orientation.  87   As of January 2014, 
21 states and the District of Columbia prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual 
orientation.  88 
 Sexual Orientation Discrimination or Sex Stereotyping? 
 Henderson began working for a staffing company that gave preference to employees with 
transportation. Although Henderson had transportation, he was assigned to projects when 
it was difficult to find someone else. Henderson filed a lawsuit alleging that he was rou-
tinely subjected to derogatory remarks by and in the presence of his supervisors, including 
that he “looked just like a woman,” was not a “real man,” and that he was a “woman 
 pretending to be something else. . . .” In denying the company’s motion for summary judg-
ment on the Title VII claims,  the court noted that Henderson’s claim demonstrates the 
tension between two legal principles. On the one hand, Title VII does not protect against 
discrimination based on sexual orientation. On the other hand, an employer cannot dis-
criminate against an employee who does not meet gender stereotypes or norms. See 
 Henderson v. Labor Finders of Va., 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47753 (E.D. Va. 2013).

 Gender Identity Discrimination 
 Several states and the District of Columbia prohibit employment discrimination based on 
gender identity or expression.89     The 2013 version of ENDA includes protection against 
gender identity discrimination.
 
In the 2012 case of Macy v. Holder the EEOC decided that it would treat transgender 
discrimination complaints as sex discrimination claims. Federal courts have also recog-
nized such claims as sex discrimination based on stereotyping men and women.90 In 2008, 
for example, a federal trial court ruled that discrimination against transsexuals based on 
sex stereotyping is prohibited under Title VII. 91 Diane Schroer is a male-to-female trans-
sexual. In 2004, before she changed her legal name from David to Diane and began pre-
senting as a woman, Schroer was offered a job by the Library of  Congress as a specialist 
on terrorism and international crime. Schroer’s military career that included serving as a 
Special Operations Colonel made her well qualified for the Library job, and she received 
the highest interview score of all the candidates. The offer was  rescinded, however, and 
given to a less qualified male, when Schroer revealed to the  supervisor that she would be 
transitioning from male to female. The supervisor expressed difficulty in understanding 
why a man with a military background would undergo gender transition. In viewing pho-
tographs of Schroer dressed in female  attire, the supervisor said she 
saw only a man in a woman’s clothing. The court held that Schroer 
had been discriminated against  “because of sex” and that she was a 
victim of sex stereotyping.  92

598  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
  2. In 2006, the EEOC filed a class action against Lawry’s Restaurants including Lawry’s 
The Prime Rib, Five Crowns, and The Tam O’Shanter Inn, on behalf of all male ap-
plicants for server positions who were systematically rejected because of their gender. 
Since 1938, Lawry’s hired only females as servers and did not update their policy after 
the passage of Title VII. Servers’ uniforms are antiquated women’s costumes. What 
might Lawry’s defense be? Will this defense be successful? Explain. See EEOC Press 
Release, “Lawry’s to Pay $1 Billion for Sex Bias Against Men in Hiring,” November 
2, 2009 [www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/11-2-09.cfm].  
  3. Emma, a Chinese American, applies for an available server position in a Mexican 
restaurant and is rejected. She suspects it is because of her national origin. What might 
the Mexican restaurant say in defense of a national origin discrimination complaint 
made by Emma? Will this defense be successful? Explain. See EEOC Compliance 
Manual (2002) at 13-II-C [  www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/national-origin.html ]. 
  4. Reeves worked as a transportation sales representative at a shipping company. 
Reeves was the only woman working on the sales floor, an open area structured into 
a “pod” of cubicles. Six males worked with Reeves. Reeves could often hear the 
language of her male coworkers as they spoke over the phone or with each other. 
Reeves could also hear the central office radio located in the “pod” that was used by 
her coworkers to listen to a crude morning show. On a daily basis at work, Reeves 
heard vulgar language and discussions of sexual topics, including such derogatory 
terms as “bitch” and “whore,” which her male coworkers used to describe custom-
ers. The male branch manager once asked Reeves to speak to “that stupid bitch on 
line 4.” Reeves brings a Title VII. sexual harassment claim against her employer. 
Decide the case. Explain. See Reeves v. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., 594 F.3d 798 
(11th Cir. 2010).  
  5. In McCormack v. Safeway, included as a “Legal Briefcase” in this chapter, the plain-
tiffs brought a retaliation claim along with their sexual harassment claims. Less than a 
month after reporting the sexual assault, the plaintiffs were both interviewed about 
McCormack’s alleged violation of Safeway’s coupon policy. A Safeway loss preven-
tion investigator confronted Stabenchek and McCormack in connection with his inves-
tigation. McCormack was suspended pending further investigation. Feeling their 
honesty was being questioned because of their complaint, plaintiffs resigned. Decide 
the retaliation claim. Explain. See McCormack v. Safeway, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
17805 (D. Ariz. 2014).  
   6.   Rodriguez managed a Walmart store at Fajardo, Puerto Rico. Following an evalua-
tion, his performance was considered unsatisfactory, and he was demoted to assis-
tant manager at another store. Rodriguez filed suit claiming race and national origin 
discrimination. Rodriguez pointed to two favorable previous performance evalua-
tions, and he argued that he was evaluated in a different manner than non-Puerto 
Rican managers. Rodriguez was evaluated with the use of an opinion survey given to 
all of his subordinates. Rodriguez claimed that non-Puerto Rican managers at other 
stores were not subject to opinion surveys. Assuming that claim is true, would Rod-
riguez be able to prevail on a disparate treatment cause of action? Explain. 
See  Rodriguez-Cuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores , 181 F.3d 15 (1st Cir. 1999).  

Chapter Thirteen  Employment Law II: Discrimination  599
  7. Assume a company located near your college has asked you to create an outreach 
 program to increase diversity in its workforce. What challenges would you face? What 
steps would you take? Explain.  
  8. Diane Piantanida went on maternity leave. While absent, her employer discovered 
tasks that she had not completed. Before her return, Piantanida was informed that she 
was being reassigned to a lesser job because of her inability to keep up in her former 
job. Upon objecting to the change, Piantanida claims she was told that she was being 
given a position “for a new mom to handle.” Piantanida admits that her demotion was 
not based on her pregnancy or her maternity leave. Piantanida declined the offer and 
sued, claiming a violation of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act stemming from her 
status as a new mother. Decide. Explain. See  Piantanida v. Wyman Center , 116 F.3d 
340 (8th Cir. 1997).  
  9. Thornton worked as a manager at a Connecticut retail store. In accordance with his 
religious beliefs, Thornton notified his manager that he could no longer work on 
 Sundays as required by company (Caldor, Inc.) policy. A Connecticut statute provided 
that: “No person who states that a particular day of the week is observed as his Sabbath 
may be required by his employer to work on such day. An employee’s refusal to work 
on his Sabbath shall not constitute grounds for his dismissal.” Management offered 
Thornton the options of transferring to a Massachusetts store where Sunday work was 
not required or transferring to a lower-paying supervisory job in the Connecticut store. 
Thornton refused both, and he was transferred to a lower-paying clerical job in the 
Connecticut store. Thornton claimed a violation of the Connecticut statute. The store 
argued that the statute violated the Establishment Clause (see Chapter 5) of the First 
Amendment, which forbids establishing an official state religion and giving preference 
to one religion over another or over none at all. Ultimately the case reached the U.S. 
Supreme Court. 
 a. Decide. Explain. 
 b. Do the religious accommodation provisions of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act 
 violate the Establishment Clause? See  Estate of Thornton v. Caldor, Inc. , 472 U.S. 
703 (1985).  
 10. Sanchez worked as a host and food server at a pair of Azteca restaurants. Throughout 
his work experience, male coworkers and a supervisor referred to him as “she” and 
“her.” He was mocked for walking and carrying his serving tray “like a woman.” He 
was called a “faggot” and a “female whore.” This abuse occurred repeatedly. 
 a. Make the argument that Sanchez was not a victim of sexual harassment. 
 b.   Decide the case. Explain. See   Nichols v. Azteca Restaurant Enterprises , 256 F.3d 
864 (9th Cir. 2001).  
 11. Jane Doe was employed by C.A.R.S. Protection Plus for nearly a year when she 
learned she was pregnant. After amniocentesis revealed severe defects, Doe decided to 
terminate her pregnancy. Doe then took one week of vacation to recuperate from the 
procedure. The following week, she was fired for unexcused absences and job aban-
donment. Doe filed a claim under the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), alleging 
she was fired because of her choice to undergo a surgical abortion. Decide the case. 
Explain. See  Doe v. C.A.R.S. Protection Plus , 527 F.3d 358 (3d Cir. 2008).

 12. A new Texas airline, flying out of Dallas’s Love Field, was in a precarious financial 
posture. A campaign was mounted to sell itself as “the airline personification of feminine 
youth and vitality.” In commercials, its customers, who were primarily businessmen, 
were promised “in-flight love,” including “love potions” (cocktails), “love bites” (toasted 
almonds), and a ticketing process (labeled a “quickie machine”) that delivered “instant 
gratification.” A male was denied a job with the airline because of his sex. He filed a 
Title VII action. The airline argued that attractive females were necessary to maintain its 
public image under the “love campaign,” a marketing approach that the company 
claimed had been responsible for its improved financial condition. Decide. Explain. See 
 Wilson v. Southwest Airlines Co. , 517 F.Supp. 292 (ND Tex. 1981).  
 13. Michael Cooke, an African-American male, worked at Novellus Systems in Silicon 
Valley where he had to listen on a regular basis to a Vietnamese-American coworker 
playing and rapping aloud to music lyrics that included racial epithets such as the 
 “N-word.” Although Cooke complained several times to his supervisors and made it 
clear that the language was offensive to him, the coworker continued to sing along to 
offensive lyrics within Cooke’s earshot, and to use slang including racial epithets. The 
EEOC, on behalf of Cooke, brought a Title VII claim against Novelle Systems for 
 racial harassment. Decide. See U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, 
“Silicon Valley Manufacturer Novellus . . . Racial Harassment,”  press release, June 24, 
2008 [ www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/release/6-24-08.cfm ].  
 14. Should employment discrimination based on physical attractiveness be prohibited? 
Explain. 
 15. Should American firms abroad adhere to American antidiscrimination policies even if 
those policies might put the American firms at a competitive disadvantage or offend 
the values and mores of the host country? Explain.  
 16. John D. Archbold Memorial Hospital excluded all job applicants whose weight 
 exceeded the maximum desirable weight (based on Metropolitan Life’s actuarial 
 survey) for large-framed men and women plus 30 percent of that weight. Sandra 
 Murray claimed she was denied a job as a respiratory therapist because her height-
to-weight ratio did not meet the guidelines. Murray did not claim to be morbidly obese. 
 a. Explain the plaintiff’s argument. 
 b. Did the hospital violate the ADA? Explain. See  Murray v. John D. Archbold 
 Memorial Hospital , 50 F.Supp.2d 1368 (M.D. Ga. 1999).

  Introduction  
 Working behind the counter of a fast-food restaurant has been commonly thought of as 
the domain of teenagers looking for a temporary job to make “pocket money.” However, 
the economic downturn found many older workers seeking employment in the fast-food 
industry. In 2013, protests in New York City and Los Angeles by fast-food workers de-
manding higher wages highlighted this shift and its impact. At a Los Angeles protest, 
one 26-year-old worker said she earned $7.25 an hour and worked 19 hours “on a good 
week.”1 A 36-year-old mother of four working at a hamburger fast-food restaurant said 

606  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
she was grateful to have a job, but uses her wages to pay rent, with no money left over to 
pay for school clothes for her children.2  
 
 Critics viewed the protests, which were supported by a labor union, as evidence that 
unions are focused on recruiting new groups of workers to bolster their declining member-
ship.3 Global economic shifts have split America’s private-sector unions in two pieces: 
one, the old-line manufacturing organizations represented by the United Auto Workers 
(UAW), for example; the other, the emerging service sector organized most notably by the 
Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which represents approximately 2 million 
nurses, security guards, janitors, and others. Traditional union power in manufacturing has 
been deeply undercut by the outsourcing of jobs abroad to take advantage of cheaper 
wages. Substantial decreases in private consumption and investment in recent years, lead-
ing to declines in manufacturing and construction, have also significantly impacted union 
membership. In 2013, the union membership rate remained at 11.3 percent as in 2012; 
since 1983, union membership has fallen nearly 50 percent. 4 The union membership rate in 
the private sector is roughly 6 percent, whereas over two-thirds of public-sector workers 
are unionized.5
 Auto Industry and Unions Union problems in the manufacturing sector were vividly 
 illustrated by the 2007 settlements of new labor agreements between the UAW and the 
Big Three American automobile manufacturers: General Motors (GM), Ford, and 
Chrysler. In return for automakers’ promises of investments to maintain manufacturing 
jobs in the United States, UAW members agreed to dramatic contract changes, allowing 
the Big Three to compete more effectively with their nonunion competitors, Toyota, 
Honda, and others.6 The UAW’s efforts to unionize auto workers in foreign-owned auto 
plants such as Nissan and Volkswagen in Mississippi have, at this writing, been gener-
ally unsuccessful. Workers at these plants who are opposed to unionizing point to high 
wages in a relatively poor state, while pro-union workers at Nissan are concerned about 
job security, as temporary help can cut Nissan’s labor costs. With approximately half of 
U.S.-manufactured autos being made by nonunionized workers, GM, Ford, and Chrysler 
may be able to pressure UAW to allow the lowering of labor costs to the level of nonun-
ion plants.7
 Union Support  According to a 2013 Pew poll, over half of Americans have a fa-
vorable view of labor unions, having rebounded nearly 10 percent from 2011.8 How-
ever, laws curtailing the power of unions have been passed in state legislatures. For 
example, in 2011, Wisconsin passed a law restricting public-sector employees’ 
 collective-bargaining rights. In 2012, Michigan, known as the home of the unionized 
auto worker, became a “right to work” state, discussed later in this chapter.9 A shift 
away from traditional unionized industries along with union corruption have certainly 
played big roles in union struggles, but union supporters say corporate resistance has 
made organizing very difficult.  Working America, an organization allied with the 
AFL-CIO, seeks to engage nonunion members in unions’ political causes, which may 
help increase workplace activism.10 [For more on Working America, see www

 Questions 
 1. Do we need labor unions to counterbalance the power of big corporations? Explain. 
 2. In the 2013 protests described at the beginning of the chapter, fast-food workers asked 
for higher wages; protesters in Los Angeles asked for a $15 an hour minimum wage. 
Supporters of a wage increase for fast-food workers point to the fast-food industry’s 
large profits and generous executive salaries. What are the arguments both for and 
against a wage increase for fast-food workers? Explain.
Does the Union Have a Fight Song?
In 2014, Peter Ohr, a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), 
ruled that Northwestern University football players are university employees and are there-
fore able to form the first college athletes’ union. The NCAA has treated college athletes 
as students first, and as athletes second; therefore, the NCAA believes these players should 
not be treated as employees. In ruling that these players are actually athletes first, Ohr 
noted that the athletes’ duties to the university’s team require 40 to 50 hours per week dur-
ing the football season, which is not only more than what many other full-time employees 
spend on their jobs, but is more than the players spent on their studies. At this writing, 
Northwestern University plans to appeal this ruling. 
Questions
1. Do you support the unionization of college athletes? Explain.
2. What obstacles might a college athletes’ union face in negotiating with a university? 
Explain.

 Part One—History 
 As the United States moved from an agrarian to an industrial society in the late 1880s, 
business competition was fierce. Costs had to be cut. By paying workers as little as pos-
sible and making them work 14- to 18-hour days, employers could prosper. Farmers 
began moving to the city to be near their jobs and thus left their safety net of gardens, 
chickens, and cows. Similarly, immigrants streamed into the big cities, and competition 
for jobs became heated. Wages fell, and deplorable working conditions were the norm. 11 
Some of those immigrants brought with them ideas and experiences in labor conflict 
and class struggle that would soon contribute to dramatic changes in the American 
workplace.

 A Grim Picture 
 To say that working conditions for many people at this time were unpleasant or even 
 dismal would be a vast understatement. The term  desperate better describes the problem. 
 Children were impressed into service as soon as they were big enough to do a job and then 
made to work 12- and 14-hour days. 12 In fact, small children were 
employed in coal mines for 10 to 12 hours each day, and at a rate of 
$1 to $3 per week, because they were small enough to fit in the con-
fined spaces. 13 Textile companies sent men called  slavers  to New 
England and southern farm communities to gather young women to 
work in the mills. 14 
 The following firsthand report from the early 20th century reveals the grim picture: 
 When I moved from the North to the South in my search for work, I entered a mill village to 
work in a cotton mill as a spinner. There I worked 11 hours a day, five and a half days a 
week, for $7 a week. In a northern mill I had done the same kind of work for $22 a week, 
and less hours. I worked terribly hard. . . .  
 The sanitary conditions were ghastly. When I desired a drink of water, I had to dip my cup 
into a pail of water that had been brought into the mill from a spring in the fields. It tasted hor-
rible to me. Often I saw lint from the cotton in the room floating on top of the  lukewarm water. 
All of the men chewed tobacco, and most of the women used snuff. Little imagination is 
needed to judge the condition of the water which I had to drink, for working in that close, hot 
spinning room made me thirsty. Toilet facilities were provided three stories down in the base-
ment of the mill in a room without any ventilation. Nowhere was there any running water. . . .  
 Everything in the village is company owned. The houses look like barns on stilts, and ap-
pear to have been thrown together. When I would go inside one of them, I could see  outside 
through the cracks in the walls. The workers do all of their trading at the company store and 
bank, and use the company school and library for they have no means of leaving the village. 15  
 
Compare those working-class conditions with the lifestyle of John D. Rockefeller, the 
great tycoon of the same era. Although Rockefeller was notoriously frugal, his estate at 
 Pocantico Hills, New York, contained: 
 . . . more than 75 buildings. . . . Within his estate were 75 miles of private roads on which he 
could take his afternoon drive; private golf links on which he could play his morning game; 
and anywhere from 1,000 to 1,500 employees, depending on the season.  
 . . . Rockefeller also owned an estate at Lakewood, [New Jersey] which he occupied in 
the spring; an estate at Ormond Beach in Florida for his winter use; a townhouse . . . in New 
York; an estate at Forest Hill, Cleveland which he did not visit; and a house on Euclid 
 Avenue in Cleveland, likewise unused by him. 16 
 
These circumstances enable us to better understand the sense of injustice felt by many 
workers and the belief that a redistribution of wealth might provide the only solution to 
class conflict. [For a timeline of the labor movement, see  http://75.afscme.org/history ] 
Organizing Labor
 The Knights of Labor, the first major labor organization in the United States, had a large 
following during the 1870s and 1880s. 17 The order admitted any workers to its ranks, 
 regardless of occupation, gender, or nationality; in fact, the only people excluded from the 
 Children were employed in 
coal mines because they were 
small enough to fit in the 
confined spaces.  

Chapter Fourteen   Employment Law III: Labor–Management Relations  609
group were gamblers, bankers, stockbrokers, and liquor dealers. 18   The Knights of Labor 
dedicated itself to principles of social reform, including the protection of wage and hour 
laws, improved health care systems, and mandatory education.  19 However, the goals of the 
Knights of Labor were perhaps too broad and far-reaching to bring workers any relief from 
their immediate problems. Great philosophical divisions within the Knights of Labor 
brought about its rapid decline.  20 
 Skilled Workers 
 Samuel  Gompers , who built and developed the American Federation of Labor (AFL), had 
more practical, attainable goals in mind for his organization.  Gompers , a worker in the  cigar 
industry, saw the need to organize workers along craft lines (such as plumbers,  electricians, 
and machinists) so that each craft group could seek higher wages and better working condi-
tions for its own workers, all of whom had the same type of skills and,  presumably, shared 
the same occupational goals. 21   This approach, a national association of local unions directed 
to workers’ pragmatic needs rather than the more politically motivated activities of the 
Knights of Labor, proved to be a successful formula for union organization.  
 Laborers 
 The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) was organized in response to the needs of 
ordinary laborers not working in the skilled trades to which the AFL was devoted. The CIO 
was organized in 1935 and served assembly-line workers and others who often performed 
repetitive, physically demanding tasks. The AFL and CIO were fierce competitors, but after 
years of bitter conflict, the two groups united forces in 1955. They function together today as 
the AFL–CIO. [For the AFL–CIO home page, see  www.aflcio.org ]  
 Unions and the Developing Law 
 Labor Protection 
  Responding to mounting public pressure, Congress passed the Norris-LaGuardia Act in 
1932 making clear that the terminology “restraint of trade,” which was the heart of the 
1890 Sherman Antitrust Act (see Chapter 10), was not meant to include labor organiza-
tions or activities. 
   
From 1932 to 1935, labor tensions continued to mount. The nation was still caught in 
the Great Depression. Believing that one element essential to economic recovery was 
 stability in the workforce, Congress addressed the labor question with the Wagner Act of 
1935. This legislation gave workers for the first time the unequivocal right to organize and 
engage in concerted activities for their mutual aid and benefit. To protect this right, 
 Congress identified and made illegal a number of unfair labor practices. Through the 
 Wagner Act, Congress also established the National Labor Relations Board (see below). 
 Management Protection 
 Unions grew rapidly with the passage of the Wagner Act, and by 1947 Congress decided 
management might need a little help in coping with ever-growing labor organizations. 22 
 Congress enacted the Taft–Hartley Act, identifying as unfair labor practices certain  activities 

610  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
unions used to exercise economic leverage over employers as part of the collective bargain-
ing process. The Taft–Hartley Act also ensured employers’ right to speak out in  opposition to 
union organizing—in effect, protecting their First Amendment right to freedom of speech. 
Thus, the Taft–Hartley Act signaled a move by the government away from unconditional 
support for labor toward a balance of rights between labor and management. 23  
 Corrupt Union Leaders 
 In response to the growing evidence that union leaders were benefiting at the expense of the 
membership, Congress in 1959 enacted the Landrum–Griffin Act, requiring unions to keep 
records of their funds. It also prohibits unions from lending money except under specified 
circumstances and procedures, all of which must be reported annually to the  government.  
 Members’ Rights 
  The Landrum–Griffin Act also contains a set of provisions often referred to as the “Bill of 
Rights” for individual union members. These provisions are designed to protect union 
members by requiring that union meetings be held, that members be permitted to speak and 
vote at these meetings, that every employee covered by a collective-bargaining agreement has 
the right to see a copy of that agreement, and that a union member be informed of the reasons 
and given a chance for a hearing if the union wishes to suspend or take disciplinary action 
against that member, unless he or she is being suspended for nonpayment of dues. 24  
 
 The law has also regulated the manner in which unions represent employees in the 
 collective-bargaining process. Because a union serves as employees’ exclusive bargaining 
representative, the courts have devised a  duty of fair representation . 25 To fulfill this duty, 
a union must represent employees, both in negotiating and enforcing the collective- 
bargaining agreement, “without hostility or discrimination . . . [and] . . . with complete 
good faith and honesty [so as to] avoid arbitrary conduct.”  26 
 Part Two—Labor Legislation Today 
 Today labor–management relations are governed by the National Labor Relations Act 
(NLRA), as enforced by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). 27 This act includes 
within it the Wagner Act, the Taft–Hartley Act, and portions of the Landrum–Griffin Act. 
The remaining provisions of the Landrum–Griffin Act make up the Labor–Management 
Reporting and Disclosure Act and the Bill of Rights of Members of Labor Organizations.  
Posters by the U.S. Department of Labor (see Chapter 12) 
and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
(EEOC—see Chapter 13) informing workers of their rights 
are familiar sights in the workplace. In 2012, the NLRB is-
sued a Notice Posting Rule requiring most private-sector 
employers—regardless of whether their workers were

 Bleeping Protected Activity? 
 During ongoing union negotiations, Bill Barker, a company vice president at the  Tampa 
Tribune , sent employees a series of letters, which were legal and accurate, describing the 
negotiation process from his perspective. In talking to supervisors about the letters one night 
after he arrived for his third shift, an employee, Greg  McMillen , said: “I hope that f**king 
idiot [Barker] doesn’t send me another letter. I’m pretty stressed, and if there is another letter 
you might not see me. I might be out on stress.”  McMillen was fired for violating a company 
policy against using threatening and abusive language in the company building.  McMillen 
complained to the NLRB. Did  McMillen’s firing violate Section 7 of the NLRA? Explain.  
 Source:  Media General Operations v. NLRB  , 560 F.3d 181 (4th Cir. 2009).  
 Right to Organize 
 The NLRA gives employees the right to engage in concerted activity, including strikes and 
collective bargaining. Section 7 of the NLRA states:  
 Employees shall have the right to self-organization, to form, join, or assist labor organiza-
tions, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in 
other concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or 
 protection, and shall also have the right to refrain from any and all of such activities except 
to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a 
 labor organization as a condition of employment. 
   
When political issues such as immigration become heated, employees’ political advo-
cacy efforts may affect the workplace. Political advocacy may in some circumstances be 
considered a  concerted activity for “mutual aid or protection” under Section 7. Under 2008 
NLRB guidelines, the first question to consider is whether there is a direct connection 
 between the political issue at stake and a “specifically identified employment concern of 
the participating employees.” Even if that direct connection is established, however, the 
employer may discipline the employees if the political activity, such as attending a rally, 
violates “neutrally applied” work rules, such as those forbidding stopping or leaving work 
without permission.  28  [For a vast database of federal and state labor law statutes and 
 regulations, see  http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/labor ] 
 unionized—to post a notice advising employees of their 
rights under the NLRA. Two federal appellate decisions in-
validated this rule; the NLRB announced in 2014 that it 
would not seek review by the U.S. Supreme Court. There-
fore, employers may choose not to post such a message. 
The workplace poster remains available on the NLRB web-
site [see www.nlrb.gov/poster]. In addition, the NLRB has 
established a free NLRB mobile app for iPhone and An-
droid users to provide the public with information about the 
National Labor Relations Act. 
Questions
1. Legal requirements aside, are employers ethically obli-
gated to inform their workers of NLRA rights? Explain.
2. From an ethical standpoint, should NLRA posting re-

612  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 Unfair Labor Practices by Management 
  The NLRA describes and outlaws certain activities by employers that would hamper or 
discourage employees from exercising the rights granted to them in Section 7. Thus 
 Section 8(a) of the act makes it an  unfair labor practice for an employer to: 
 1. Interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights given to them 
by Section 7;  
 2. Dominate, interfere, or assist with the formation of any labor organization, including 
contributing financial support to it;  
  3.   Encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization by discrimination in regard 
to hiring, tenure of employment, promotion, salary, or any other term of employment;  
 4. Discharge or take any other action against an employee because he or she has filed 
charges or given testimony under the act; and  
 5. Refuse to bargain collectively with a duly certified representative of the employees. 
 
 These five provisions are designed to allow employees to organize in an atmosphere 
free from intimidation by the employer. In addition, if employees have chosen a union as 
their exclusive collective bargaining representative, Section 8(a) regulates the bargaining 
between the employer and the union. The provisions also ensure that the employer will not 
be able to interfere with union activities by either seizing control of the union or rendering 
it impotent by refusing to bargain collectively.  
At-Will Disclaimers
Recently, the employee handbook has been the source of complaints that employers are 
violating their employees’ NLRA rights. For example, the at-will provision, typically 
signed by new employees, may state: “I agree that the at-will employment relationship 
cannot be amended, modified, or altered in any way.” This provision may be unlawful, 
because it waives the employee’s right to act with other employees to change the nature of 
their employment relationship.29 However, an at-will provision declaring that managers 
and supervisors have no authority to alter the employment relationship’s at-will status, 
without restricting the employee’s ability to engage in concerted activity to do so, has been 
considered valid by the NLRB.30
Dress Codes
Pro-union hats, T-shirts, and the like are commonly used in union campaigns. However, 
under recent federal court decisions, employers may limit such attire for a legitimate busi-
ness interest. For example, Starbucks employees often wear buttons offering information 
on Starbucks products. During a campaign to unionize Starbucks, pro-union buttons were 
worn by some employees. Starbucks began prohibiting employees from wearing more than 
one pro-union button at work, which the NLRB determined to be an unfair labor practice. 
In rejecting the NLRB’s ruling, a federal appellate court held that Starbucks had a legiti-
mate interest in ensuring that its business-related messages did not get lost in an array of 
other buttons worn by its employees.31 Similarly, a federal appellate court determined that 
an employer lawfully requested that its employee remove his T-shirt printed with a nega-
tive comment about the employer’s performance recognition program. Medco, a pharmacy 

Chapter Fourteen   Employment Law III: Labor–Management Relations  613
benefits program, started a “WOW awards” program to recognize employees’ perfor-
mance. The T-shirt in question had a union logo on the front, and the message, “I don’t 
need a WOW to do my job” on the back. Because the WOW program was used to entice 
prospective and current clients, Medco’s demand to remove the T-shirt was justified under 
its policy prohibiting clothing printed with “degrading . . . insulting or provocative” state-
ments.32
All Because of a Bad Haircut?
Embarrassed over a bad haircut, Nichole Wright-Gore, a supply clerk for White Oak 
Manor, started wearing a hat to work. After several days, supervisors told her to remove 
the hat as it violated a company dress code prohibiting hats; she refused and was disci-
plined. Wright-Gore subsequently began to take photos of her coworkers, some with and 
without consent, showing them wearing hats and violating the dress code in other ways, 
which she shared with coworkers while discussing with them the unequal enforcement of 
the dress code. After employees complained about having their photos taken and shared 
with others without their consent, Wright-Gore was terminated for violating White Oak’s 
policy prohibiting photos being taken in the facility. Did Wright-Gore’s termination vio-
late the NLRA? Explain. 
Source: NLRB v. White Oak Manor, 452 Fed. Appx. 374 (4th Cir. 2011) (unpub’d. op.).
Social Media Policies
Can a Facebook posting or comment be protected activity under the NLRA? Coworkers 
who are “Facebook friends” or otherwise connected on social media may communicate 
about workplace issues through these venues. Employers, seeking to protect their online 
reputation and lessen their risk of employment-related liability for, as an example, harass-
ment (see Chapter 13), may have a “social media policy” prohibiting certain conduct on 
Facebook and similar sites. In 2011 and 2012, the NLRB issued three Advice Memos to 
help employers avoid violating employees’ NLRA Section 7’s right to communicate about 
their terms and conditions of employment through social media policies. If employees 
would reasonably read the policy to mean, for example, they are not allowed to discuss 
wages or ask each other about perceptions of unfair treatment, then the policy would likely 
violate the NLRA.33 In its 2012 decision in Costco Wholesale Corporation, the NLRB 
found that Costco’s social media policy violated the NLRA in prohibiting employees from 
electronically posting statements that would, for example, “defame the Company” or 
“damage any person’s reputation.” Employees may have interpreted this broad policy as 
preventing them from engaging in such concerted activity as discussing possible mistreat-
ment of employees.34 In a 2013 case, the NLRB found that a clothing store wrongfully 
terminated several employees for posting negative comments on Facebook relating to a 
dispute with the store manager about closing time, given concerns with the store’s loca-
tion.35 However, derogatory comments about customers or disrespectful statements about 
customers may not be protected.36

614  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 Unfair Labor Practices by Unions 
 Section 8(b) lists activities constituting unfair labor practices by a labor organization. Some 
of these provisions mirror some of the activities prohibited to employers. Moreover, at least 
since the enactment of the Taft–Hartley Act, the law is not sympathetic to labor organizations 
that try to use certain coercive tactics, threats of the loss of livelihood, or any other strong-
arm methods. Finally, Section 8(b) also regulates the union’s collective bargaining practices, 
including economic action. Thus, a labor organization is not permitted to:  
 1. Restrain or coerce any employee in the exercise of his or her rights as granted by Section 7. 
 2. Cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an employee who has 
chosen not to join a particular labor organization or has been denied membership in 
such an organization. 
 3. Refuse to bargain collectively with an employer on behalf of the bargaining unit it is 
certified to represent. 
 4. Induce or attempt to induce an employer to engage in secondary boycott activities. 
  5.   Require employees to become union members and then charge them excessive or 
 discriminatory dues. 
 6. Try to make an employer compensate workers for services not performed. 
  7.   Picket or threaten to picket an employer in an attempt to force the employer to recog-
nize or bargain with a labor organization that is not the duly certified representative of 
a bargaining unit. 
 Representation Procedures 
 Section 9 of the NLRA specifies the election procedures by which employees may choose 
whether to be represented by a particular union or no union at all.  
 National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) 
 The NLRB is a federal administrative agency responsible for regulating labor–management 
 relations. Its primary tasks are designating appropriate bargaining units of workers 
 (deciding which workers have a sufficient community of interest so that their needs can 
best be acknowledged and so that collective bargaining is efficient for the employer and 
the union); conducting elections for union representation within the chosen bargaining 
unit; certifying the results of such elections; and investigating, prosecuting, and adjudicat-
ing charges of unfair labor practices. 37 
 
Although the congressional mandate by which the NLRB was formed gives the agency 
 jurisdiction theoretically to the full extent of the interstate commerce powers vested in 
 Congress, the agency has neither the funding nor the staff to administer its duties to all of 
American  industry. Some smaller businesses, government employees, railroad, and airline 
workers  covered by the Railway Labor Act, agricultural workers, domestic workers, 
 independent  contractors, and supervisors and other managerial employees are not  protected 
by the board.  38 
 
Over the years, the five-member NLRB has been criticized for sometimes reaching 
decisions based on political/philosophical considerations rather than legal reasoning 

Chapter Fourteen   Employment Law III: Labor–Management Relations  615
and Board precedent. As successive presidential administrations appoint NLRB mem-
bers, the Board’s decisions often “seesaw” according to the changes in Washington 
political power. [For more on the NLRB, see  www.nlrb.gov ] 
 Part Three—Elections 
 Choosing a Bargaining Representative 
 Representation elections are the process by which the NLRB achieves the first of the two 
statutory goals under the act—employee freedom of choice. That goal, however, is some-
times in conflict with the other statutory goal—stable collective bargaining. The NLRB 
has devised rules to resolve such conflicts. [For the AFL–CIO view of why workers should 
join unions, see   www.workingamerica.org/issues ] 
 Election Petition 
 A union, employee, or employer initiates the formal organizing process by filing an elec-
tion petition with the NLRB. The petition is sent to the employer, thus providing notice of 
union activity. Also, the employer must post notices supplied by the NLRB so that em-
ployees are aware of the petition. The NLRB then assumes its authority to closely oversee 
the conduct of employer and union. Of course at that point, the employer is free to simply 
acknowledge its employees’ interest in joining a particular union and to engage in bargain-
ing with that union, a decision normally called   voluntary recognition . 
 
Sometimes an employer enters an agreement with a union specifying that the employer 
will voluntarily recognize the union if the union can demonstrate that it has majority sup-
port among the employees. Majority support is often established by a  card check  method 
where employees signify their interest in the union simply by signing authorization cards. 
The card check approach thus bypasses the secret ballot election and can greatly ease 
 union organizing. One of the controversial NLRB decisions of 2007, however, overturned 
40 years of precedent and made the card check method less useful for union organizing. In 
 Dana Corporation/Metaldyne , 39 the NLRB ruled that where an employer voluntarily rec-
ognizes a union based on a card check majority, antiunion employees now have 45 days to 
petition the board for a federally supervised, secret ballot election to   decertify the newly 
recognized union or to support a petition by a rival union. Under previous rulings, that 
election ordinarily would not have been permitted until at least 12 months had passed. The 
NLRB majority believed that elections are more accurate representations of employee 
preferences than the more open, and easily influenced, card check. 
 
Failing voluntary recognition, the process proceeds according to NLRB rules. The 
NLRB will accept only those election petitions supported by a substantial showing of 
 interest, which, at a minimum, must include the signatures of at least 30 percent of the 
employees in the bargaining unit. (In practice today, most unions will not proceed toward 
an election without 50 to 65 percent of the employees’ signatures.) Those signatures 
 accompany the petition, or they may appear on the authorization cards. 

616  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 Procedure 
 Prior to an election, the NLRB ordinarily will first attempt to settle certain issues such as 
whether a union contract already covers the employees or whether the election should be 
delayed. In determining the timing of the election, the two statutory goals of employee free 
choice and stable collective-bargaining may conflict. For example, if the employees are 
already covered by a collective-bargaining agreement, should they be able to choose again 
during the term of the agreement? Similarly, if the employees have rejected a union in an 
election, can they be prohibited from voting again in the name of stable collective bargain-
ing? Alternatively, what if the employees choose to unionize in an election, but reconsider 
before a collective-bargaining agreement is reached? Can they have another election? 
   
The crucial issue to be addressed at this point, however, is normally whether the 
 proposed bargaining unit (the designated employee group—for example, all hourly work-
ers, all welders, or all  craftspersons ) is appropriate for the election. 
 Appropriate Bargaining Unit 
 The key consideration in establishing an appropriate employee bargaining unit is the commu-
nity of interest among the employees. The NLRB searches for an appropriate bargaining unit 
because collective bargaining will not be stable and efficient if it involves employees with 
 diverse interests. Therefore, the bargaining unit may range from a portion of a plant to multiple 
employers in multiple plants. Plants may have more than one appropriate bargaining unit, 
 depending on the composition of the workforce. The NLRB makes the decision regarding the 
appropriate bargaining unit on the basis of such considerations as physical location of the 
plants; physical contact among employees; similarity of wages, benefits, and working condi-
tions; differences in skill requirements among job categories; and common supervision.  
 
Certain classes of employees, such as supervisors, are excluded from the bargaining 
unit. Obviously supervisors are excluded because they act on behalf of the employer 
and, through their power to direct and assign work and to discipline and discharge em-
ployees, exert control over their subordinates who are or may be in the bargaining unit. 
Often labor and management do not agree about the classification of workers as supervi-
sors. In a 2006 decision outraging union activists, the NLRB substantially expanded the 
range of employees who might lawfully be considered supervisors (and thus ineligible 
for union membership) to include those assigned supervisory duties just 10 or 15 percent 
of the time.40
  
Independent contractors are not protected under the NLRA. In 2009, a federal appeals 
court set aside the NLRB’s decision that FedEx had unlawfully failed to bargain with a 
union which had been certified to represent drivers at two FedEx home terminals. The 
 appeals court concluded that the drivers were independent contractors who had been 
 misclassified as employees by the NLRB.  41 
 Solicitation 
 A 1992 Supreme Court decision in the  Lechmere  case 42   made union organizing much more 
difficult by ruling that employers do not have to allow on their property union organizers 
who are not employees. One of the results of that decision has been an increase in salting, 
the practice of union organizers applying for jobs with the intent of unionizing the other 
employees from the inside. The Supreme Court’s 1995   Town & Country   decision  43 held 

Chapter Fourteen   Employment Law III: Labor–Management Relations  617
that salts are employees, thus affording them NLRA protection that forbids discrimination 
based on union affiliation, but a 2007 NLRB decision limited protection under the NLRA 
to those salts who are “genuinely interested” in obtaining employment. 44 Many employers 
saw the  Town & Country  decision as an unfair intrusion on their property rights and on 
their preference to remain union-free. The case that follows involves a  Walmart employ-
ee’s efforts to interest coworkers in joining a union.

The next incident occurred on January 30, 2001. While on 
duty at the store,   Shieldnight  invited Department Manager 
 Debra Starr and associates Patricia Scott and James Parsons, 
all of whom were also on duty, to a union meeting.  Shieldnight   
asked Starr to come to the meeting and stated that he would 
like her to consider signing a union authorization card. 
 Shieldnight separately asked Scott and Parsons to attend the 
meeting to hear “the other side of the story.”  
 
Based on these two incidents, Co-Manager Rick Hawkins and 
Assistant Manager John Lamont held a written “coaching 
 session” with  Shieldnight for violating the no-solicitation rule. A 
“coaching session” is part of Wal-Mart’s progressive discipline 
process. Verbal coaching and written coaching are the first two 
steps in a four-step process. Hawkins and Lamont  explained to 
  Shieldnight   that he had violated the solicitation policy on 
January 29 by soliciting on the sales floor with his T-shirt and on 
January 30 by verbally soliciting employees while on-duty and 
on the sales floor. Lamont told   Shieldnight   that it was wrong 
to have sent  Shieldnight off Wal-Mart property completely. 
Lamont clarified that while  Shieldnight could not solicit on the 
sales floor, he could do so in the parking lot while not on duty. 
Hawkins, Lamont, and  Shieldnight also  discussed  Shield-
night’s   questions and concerns regarding Wal-Mart employ-
ment  policies, such as health insurance for associates. 
Lamont  suggested  Shieldnight should raise the matter in 
“grassroots” meetings that all Wal-Mart stores hold to identify

 Petitioner appeals the National Labor Relations Board’s order 
finding that it violated the National Labor Relations Act by pun-
ishing employee Brian   Shieldnight for union solicitation. 
 I 
 This case arises from efforts to unionize employees at the 
Wal-Mart store in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. The store, like all 
Wal-Mart stores, maintains and enforces a policy that prohib-
its solicitation during employees’ work time, regardless of the 
cause or organization.  
 
Brian  Shieldnight , an employee of the Tahlequah Wal-Mart, 
contacted the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, 
 Local 1000 (“Union”) about possible union representation. He 
obtained authorization cards from the union to organize 
employees at the Tahlequah store.  
  
On January 29, 2001,  Shieldnight entered the store while 
off-duty. He wore a T-shirt that read “Union Teamsters” on 
the front and “Sign a card . . . Ask me how!” on the back. 
 Assistant Store Manager John Lamont and Assistant Night 
Manager Tammy Flute saw  Shieldnight’s T-shirt and saw him 
speak to an associate. Flute told the associate to return to 
work, and Lamont ordered   Shieldnight to leave associates 
alone. Lamont then consulted a Wal-Mart “union hotline.” 
The hotline representative told Lamont that   Shieldnight’s   
shirt constituted solicitation and that  Shieldnight should be 
removed from the store. Lamont and Flute sought out  Shield-
night . They found him in the jewelry department talking to 
two friends who were not associates. Lamont informed

the top three companywide issues. The three men arranged a 
time to meet in the future. That meeting never  occurred.  
 
The union subsequently filed an unfair labor practice 
charge against Wal-Mart. . . .  
 
[A] divided Board panel found that  Shieldnight  had not 
engaged in solicitation when he (1) wore the T-shirt during 
his shift; (2) asked on-duty employees to attend a union 
meeting; or (3) asked a coworker to sign a union card. . . . 
Wal-Mart  appeals. . . .

 * * * * * 
 A. The T-Shirt 
 The union contends that  Shieldnight’s T-shirt did not consti-
tute solicitation, but rather was a “union insignia.” Wal-Mart 
argues that by encouraging people to approach him, 
 Shieldnight’s T-shirt was a form of solicitation. In  NLRB v. 
W.W. Grainger, Inc. , the board held,  
 “Solicitation” for a union usually means asking someone to 
join the union by signing his name to an authorization card in 
the same way that solicitation for a charity would mean 
asking an employee to contribute to a charitable organization 
. . . or in the commercial context asking an employee to buy a 
product or exhibiting the product for him. . . .  
 Ordinarily, employees may wear union insignia while on their 
employer’s premises. . . .  
 
The board stated that the T-shirt should be treated as 
 union insignia because “it did not ‘speak’ directly to any 
 specific  individual . . . and it did not call for an immediate 
 response, as would an oral person-to-person invitation to 
 accept or sign an authorization card.” The board found that 
there was “no claim or evidence that  Shieldnight did any-
thing in furtherance of the T-shirt message. . . . He merely 
walked around and socialized. . . about nonunion matters.” 
Anyone, including any Wal-Mart  employee who saw 
 Shieldnight was free to ignore both  Shieldnight and the mes-
sage on the T-shirt. In contrast, a solicitation to sign an au-
thorization card requires more interaction, likely a direct yes 
or no answer. Absent  further evidence of direct inquiry by 
 Shieldnight , the board’s conclusion was supported by sub-
stantial evidence.  
 
Wal-Mart alleges that the panel’s conclusion is not rea-
sonable because it ignores both   Shieldnight’s   purpose and the 
long-held rule that an employer may implement rules against 
solicitation during work time to prevent interference with work 
productivity.  
 * * * * * 
 
Wal-Mart failed to demonstrate how the T-shirt interfered 
in any manner with the operation of the store. Accordingly, 
substantial evidence supports the board’s conclusion that 
 Shieldnight’s T-shirt did not constitute solicitation. 
 B. The Coworker Conversations 
 * * * * * 
 Shieldnight invited three coworkers to a union meeting. . . . 
  Shieldnight’s   statements did not require an immediate response 
from the three coworkers. Instead of a solicitation that required a 
response, the record shows that   Shieldnight’s   statements were 
more akin to a statement of fact that put his coworkers on notice 
that there was to be a union meeting that night and that they 
were welcome to attend. Nothing in the record suggests that the 
environment at Wal-Mart made  Shieldnight’s actions uniquely 
disruptive. Accordingly, the panel’s conclusion regarding  Shield-
night’s conversations was supported by substantial evidence. 
Furthermore, the panel acted reasonably when it concluded that 
“simply informing another employee of an upcoming meeting or 
asking a brief, union-related question does not occupy enough 
time to be treated as a work interruption in most settings.”  
 C. Asking Coworker to Sign a Card 
 The board concluded that it was not solicitation when  Shield-
night  asked a coworker to sign a union authorization card. . . . 
 
In light of the totality of the circumstances,  Shieldnight’s 
actions constituted solicitation even though he did not actually 
offer Starr a card at the time he asked her to sign.  Shieldnight 
had contacted the union about obtaining union representation 
and had obtained cards from the union for the purpose of 
 organizing employees at the Tahlequah store. There is little 
doubt as to  Shieldnight’s intent in the words he spoke to Starr. 
The record indicates that  Shieldnight did not have a card in his 
hand at the time he spoke to Starr. It is silent as to whether he 
had a card on his person. The fact that he did not place a card 
directly in front of Starr at the time of his statement makes little 
difference in regard to the nature of his conversation. Further, 
 Shieldnight’s actions in this instance are more analogous to a 
direct solicitation than when he asked his coworkers to attend 
the union meeting. Asking someone to sign a union card offers 
that individual person the choice to be represented by a union. 
Informing coworkers about a union meeting merely puts fellow 
employees on notice that a meeting is going to take place.  
 
Accordingly, there is insufficient evidence to support the 
board’s conclusion that  Shieldnight’s actions were not solici-
tation, and thus we reverse the board regarding the authoriza-
tion card issue.

 Questions 
 1. Why was the T-shirt not a form of solicitation? 
 2. Why was  Shieldnight’s invitation to three coworkers to at-
tend a union meeting not a form of solicitation, whereas 
asking a coworker to sign a card was considered imper-
missible solicitation?  
 The Election for Union Representation 
The union may be selected only by a majority of the votes cast by the employees. The 
NLRB oversees the election to ensure the process is  carried on under “laboratory condi-
tions.” 45 In other words, elections must be held under circumstances that, to the extent 
possible, are free from undue or unfair influence by either the employer or by unions vying 
for the right to represent the bargaining unit. 
 
In 2011, the NLRB passed rules that would have compressed the time between a call for 
a vote and the election to determine union representation. In 2012, a federal court held that 
these were invalid, because less than three of the five NLRB members had voted on the 
rules.46 
 
Employers have the right to speak out against unions in the form of ads, speeches, and the 
like. Section 8(c) of the Taft–Hartley Act is designed to ensure employers’ and labor organiza-
tions’ traditional First Amendment rights as long as they do not overstep certain bounds:  
 The expressing of any views, argument, or opinion, or the dissemination thereof, whether in 
written, printed, graphic, or visual form, shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair labor 
practice . . . if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.  
 Gooseplay ? 
 During a union organizing campaign, a goose wandered from a company pond into the 
work area where a worker “talked” to the goose and determined that it favored the union. 
Workers then put a “Vote Yes” card around the goose’s neck and drove the goose around 
the plant on a forklift. The workers were fired for disrupting work and creating a safety 
hazard. The union claimed the company illegally fired the workers for engaging in union 
organizing. An administrative law judge agreed with the union, but the NLRB reversed, 
saying, “Placing a ‘Vote Yes’ sign on a wild animal does not transform otherwise unpro-
tected ‘ gooseplay ’ into activity protected by the National Labor Relations Act.”

 Threats of Reprisal or Force 
 Employers cannot discriminate in employment to encourage or discourage union member-
ship. Clearly, an employer who tells employees, for example, that they will all be dis-
charged if they engage in union activity, has interfered with their rights. Similarly, an 
Chapter Fourteen   Employment Law III: Labor–Management Relations  619

620  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
employer who interrogates employees about their activities or spies on them while they 
attend union meetings has engaged in unlawful interference. Problems often arise, 
 however, in determining whether antiunion arguments by an employer are legitimate or 
whether they contain veiled threats. Suppose, for instance, that a company owner tells her 
employees that in a unionized workplace, they would have to go through the union repre-
sentative to make their complaints, who would decide whether to bring these to the com-
pany’s attention. The NLRB has determined that such a statement is not a threat, but rather 
an accurate reflection of the nature of unionized workplaces.47 
 Promise of Benefit 
 Although threats of force or reprisal are clearly unlawful in union campaigns, the rationale 
behind the prohibition against promises of benefit is not as intuitively obvious.  
 
 In a dispute that reached the U.S. Supreme Court, Exchange Parts sent its employees a 
letter shortly before a representation election that spoke of “the 
empty promises of the union” and “the fact that it is the company 
that puts things in your envelope.” After mentioning a number of 
benefits, the letter said, “The union can’t put any of those things in 
your envelope—only the company can do that.” Further on, the letter stated, “It didn’t 
take a union to get any of those things and . . . it won’t take a union to get additional im-
provements in the future.” Accompanying the letter was a detailed statement of the ben-
efits granted by the company and an estimate of the monetary value of such benefits to the 
employees.  
 
In the representation election two weeks later, the union lost, but the outcome was chal-
lenged in court. Eventually the Supreme Court ruled that the employer’s actions consti-
tuted an unfair labor practice reasoning that “well-timed increases in benefits” provide a 
clear message that those who provide advantages are the same people who can withdraw 
those benefits should their wishes not be followed.  48 
 The union can’t put any of 
those things in your envelope.  
 Buying Votes? 
  An Atlantic City, New Jersey, limousine service held a union election-day raffle for a 
TV/VCR. The NLRB ruled, 3–2, that the raffle was an unfair labor practice that might 
reasonably be interpreted to be a reward that would influence voting. A new election was 
 ordered. The NLRB order banned election-day raffles, but minor “gifts” such as food, 
drinks, and buttons would be considered case-by-case if an objection were lodged.

 response. Ireland also testified that he had apologized to the 
group for Steele’s behavior. Steele, however, was not ordered 
to remain for the rest of the meeting, which ended shortly after 
his exit.  
 
Two days later, Steele and Ireland met at Steele’s request. 
Steele apologized for his conduct at the department meeting 
and then told Ireland that hourly shop workers were dissatis-
fied with company policies. Steele told Ireland that “manage-
ment needed to just sit down with the hourly employees and 
work some things out.” Ireland replied, “That could not be 
done.” Steele then told Ireland that, if they could not sit down 
and discuss these problems, he would organize a union. Ire-
land asked Steele to wait until Ireland returned from his vaca-
tion to discuss the issue further. Steele agreed and made no 
effort to contact a union while Ireland was away.  
 
On August 16, 1996, Steele met with Ireland and bindery 
department manager Marty Heathcoat in Heathcoat’s office. 
During this meeting, the two managers asked Steele why he 
would want to bring a union into the company. Steele told 
them that it would be nice to have seniority rights, better work-
ing conditions, and raises when possible. Ireland then asked 
what Steele could do to improve Steele’s own situation at the 
company and pointed out that Multi-Ad posted job openings. 
After Steele expressed interest in a maintenance position, Ire-
land told him that he would set up an interview, even though 
the company did not have an opening for a maintenance posi-
tion. At the end of the meeting, Ireland asked Steele “what it 
would take to satisfy him.” Steele replied that it would satisfy 
him if management “would sit down with the hourly employees 
and work something out.” After Ireland responded that he 
could not do that, Steele informed the two managers that he 
was leaving the meeting and was going to attempt to organize 
a union. Ireland asked Steele to come back and talk some 
more, but Steele responded that there was nothing left to talk 
about. Steele left at 3:30 p.m., 30 minutes after his shift had 
ended. No one told Steele to stay, nor was he reprimanded for 
having left the meeting. The next day, Steele interviewed for a 
maintenance position, but the interview revealed that he 
lacked the necessary qualifications. In any event, Steele said 
that he did not want the job.  
 
Steele twice met with union officials in late August. During 
this time, employees began to talk about Steele’s efforts at or-
ganizing a union. At a meeting of bindery department employ-
ees in late August, Heathcoat addressed rumors about a union 
and asked employees why they wanted a union. In response, 
Steele stated that everyone knew that Heathcoat was 
 Judge Ripple 
 This petition asks us to review whether Multi-Ad Services, 
 Incorporated (“Multi-Ad”) violated the National Labor 
 Relations Act (“Act”) by interfering with its employees’ efforts 
to form a union. The National Labor Relations Board (“Board”) 
concluded that Multi-Ad violated the Act. . . .  
 BACKGROUND 
 Multi-Ad employs 450 workers at its full-service advertising art 
production facility in Peoria, Illinois. Multi-Ad hired Steele in 
1989 to work in the bindery department. Fifteen employees 
work in the department, which manufactures loose-leaf, 
three-ring binders. The bindery department is a small opera-
tion, accounting for a limited percentage of the company’s 
sales and profits. Steele’s performance evaluations were 
above average throughout his tenure at the company.  
 * * * * * 
 
On July 29, 1996, Multi-Ad held a quarterly meeting for em-
ployees of the bindery, press, and finishing departments. After 
discussing the company’s financial performance, plant pro-
duction manager Jerry Ireland announced the company’s plan 
to implement a new drug-testing policy. Following this an-
nouncement, Steele spoke up and openly criticized the policy, 
contending in a loud and persistent manner that such testing 
violated employees’ right to privacy. Other employees also 
voiced their displeasure with the policy. Steele and Larry 
  Clore , Multi-Ad’s president, then began to argue about the 
policy’s legality. At the end of this exchange, Steele requested 
a copy of Multi-Ad’s laws and bylaws.  Clore told Steele that he 
could have these materials after the meeting.  
 
Later that day, the quarterly meeting split into separate de-
partmental meetings. The bindery department meeting com-
menced around 3:00 p.m., the normal quitting time for day-shift 
employees. At this meeting,   Clore   gave Steele a summary plan 
description of Multi-Ad’s corporate structure. After Steele 
pointed out that he wanted the complete bylaws and not a 
summary,   Clore   responded, “Have your lawyer get them.” 
 Clore then told Steele that if he did not like the company’s drug 
policy, “Why don’t you think about leaving the company?” 
Steele responded that he would not give  Clore the pleasure of 
quitting. After  Clore departed, Ireland tried to continue with 
the meeting, but Steele announced that he was leaving 
 because “he was on his own time now.” Steele testified that 
Ireland said, “Okay.” Ireland, however, testified that Steele’s 
remark had shocked him and that he had said nothing in 
 Multi-Ad Services v. NLRB
255 F.3d 363 (7th Cir. 2001)  
 L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E 

 referring to Steele’s desire to look into unionization. Ted 
 DeRossett , Steele’s supervisor, then warned that the bindery 
department would be the “first to go” if the company union-
ized. Steele immediately challenged the legality of closing the 
bindery department in such a fashion. After Steele and  DeRos-
sett  began to argue heatedly, Heathcoat ended the meeting. 
   
At another bindery department meeting in late August, 
 management informed employees that they would be work-
ing mandatory 10-hour shifts. Steele protested that it was 
unfair to require employees to work overtime when in the 
past they had been able to decline overtime. Steele also 
stated that it was  decisions like this that caused him to 
 explore bringing in a union.  
   
Shortly after the meeting, Multi-Ad announced that it was 
adding a second shift in the bindery department and that 
Steele would be the lead man. On August 29, 1996, Heathcoat 
and  DeRossett asked Steele if he would work the second shift 
with a positive attitude. The two assured Steele that he could 
still take his scheduled vacation days from August 30 through 
September 3. Steele told them that he would go to the second 
shift, do the job, and represent the company as was expected 
of him.  
 
The next day, while Steele was on vacation, Multi-Ad re-
ceived a letter from Steele requesting copies of the compa-
ny’s policies and bylaws. When Steele returned from his 
vacation on September 4, Heathcoat and  DeRossett were 
waiting for him at the plant’s garage door. The two asked 
Steele if he still wanted to see the materials that he had re-
quested in the letter. Steele said yes, and the two told him that 
he could pick up the materials in the office of Bruce Taylor, 
Multi-Ad’s vice president of finance. Steele punched the time 
clock and, as he started to walk toward Taylor’s office, no-
ticed   DeRossett   and Heathcoat accompanying him. Steele 
told them that he did not need them to pick up the papers. The 
two replied that they were tagging along in case he had any 
questions. Steele told them that he could not possibly have 
any questions because he had not yet read the materials. 
Nevertheless, both managers followed Steele into Taylor’s of-
fice. Ireland entered the office shortly thereafter. Steele first 
asked Taylor for the documents. Taylor replied that Steele al-
ready had been given the summary statement at the quarterly 
meeting. Steele responded that he was not asking for a sum-
mary but for complete documents. After again requesting the 
documents and receiving no response, Steele announced that 
he would no longer participate in the meeting and walked out. 
Heathcoat ordered him to remain or be fired. Steele ignored 
this command and walked back to the plant, pursued by 
Heathcoat and Ireland. Heathcoat repeated his order that 
Steele return to the office or be fired. Steele, again, refused. 
Ireland then told Steele that “this is the third meeting you 
have walked out of, you are gone.” Steele immediately 
 demanded a termination letter.  
   
Even though Ireland had made the decision to fire Steele, 
Heathcoat prepared the letter. The letter spells out the 
 purported reasons for Steele’s termination: 
 He [Steele] said that he didn’t come for a meeting, [sic] and 
then walked out of the room. I told him to get back in 
Bruce’s [Taylor’s] office to discuss this with us. He repeated 
himself again saying that he didn’t want a meeting. Jerry 
Ireland then Fired [sic] him.  
 
Ted Steele has walked out of three meetings within a 
month because he didn’t feel like hearing what was being 
said to him. He has said that he does not agree with 
corporate policies set for all the employees of Multi[-]Ad. 
He has interrupted the work flow of the Bindery Department 
by persuading it’s [sic] employees that this is not a good 
place to work. Ted will never see eye to eye with Multi[-]
Ad’s policies and goals for it’s [sic] employees and will not 
even conduct himself in a professional manner when talking 
to management about his concerns. Ted is terminated on 
9-4-96 because of his unwillingness to abide to [sic] 
corporate policies. 
   
Ireland testified that he fired Steele because he was totally 
disrespectful to management. Ireland also testified that 
Steele’s exit from the meeting on September 4 was an act of 
insubordination, particularly after he ignored Heathcoat’s or-
der to return.  
 THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS 
  On September 26, 1996, Graphic Communications Union, 
 Local 68C, and Graphic Communications International Union, 
 AFL–CIO, filed an unfair labor charge against Multi-Ad on 
 behalf of its employees, including Steele. Soon thereafter, 
the Board’s General Counsel issued a complaint and a notice 
of hearing. The complaint alleged that Multi-Ad violated the 
Act by (1) coercively interrogating Steele about his interest 
in forming a union during the August 16 meeting with Heath-
coat and Ireland; (2) impliedly promising at the August 16 
meeting to help Steele improve his employment situation 
without the need for representation; and (3) threatening to 
close the bindery department if its employees unionized. The 
complaint also alleges that Multi-Ad violated the Act by 
 discharging Steele because it believed that he might contact 
a union to organize employees.  
 
On May 29, 1997, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) 
conducted a hearing on the board’s complaint. Based on the 
evidence presented at the hearing, the ALJ issued his deci-
sion on December 2, 1997, and found that Multi-Ad had com-
mitted the charged unfair labor practices. On August 25, 
622  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations

2000, the board issued a decision and order affirming the 
 ALJ’s conclusions.  
 
On October 10, 2000, Multi-Ad filed this petition for review. 
 Substantial Evidence 
 Multi-Ad first challenges the Board’s determination that Multi-
Ad coercively interrogated Steele on August 16 in violation of 
the Act.  
 * * * * * 
 
Substantial evidence supports the Board’s conclusion that 
management coercively interrogated Steele on August 16. The 
closed-door meeting was conducted in a manager’s office by 
Heathcoat and Ireland, two people who had authority to fire 
Steele. The two managers questioned Steele regarding why 
he would want to bring a union into the company. . . . Moreo-
ver, Ireland immediately thereafter asked Steele about his 
own career advancement and arranged an interview for a 
maintenance position, even though no such opening existed. 
The managers did not assure Steele that reprisals would not 
be taken against him for his answers, adding to the potentially 
coercive nature of the inquiry. Further, this meeting was con-
ducted after company managers had expressed uneasiness 
over union activity. These circumstances are more than 
enough evidence to sustain the Board’s findings.  
 
Multi-Ad next challenges the Board’s finding that it made 
an implied promise of benefits by asking Steele how he could 
help his own situation and by arranging the job interview. . . . 
Here, Ireland asked Steele why he wanted to form a union and 
then asked Steele how Steele could improve his own situation. 
Steele expressed an interest in a maintenance position, and 
Ireland arranged for an interview immediately, even though 
there were no such openings. The context in which this oc-
curred is significant. Because the managers made this over-
ture during a conversation about the need for a union, the 
Board reasonably could have concluded that the company 
was willing to confer a benefit to deter Steele from contacting 
a union. . . .  
 
Next, Multi-Ad argues that substantial evidence does not 
support the Board’s conclusion that Multi-Ad threatened to 
close the bindery department. Unlike an interrogation, which 
is coercive only if reasonable employees would perceive it as 
such, a threat of plant closure is per se a violation of Section 8(a)
(1). In this case, three employees testified unequivocally that 
 DeRossett   said that the bindery department would be the “first 
to go” if they brought in a union, and this evidence is more 
than sufficient to establish a violation.  
 
Finally, Multi-Ad disputes the Board’s conclusion that 
Steele’s discharge violates Sections 8(a)(1) and (3). An employer 
violates Sections 8(a)(1) or (3) of the Act by firing employees be-
cause of their union activities. To prove a violation, the Board 
must prove that antiunion animus was a substantial or moti-
vating factor in the employer’s decision to make the adverse 
employment decision. If the Board proves such a motivation 
by a preponderance of the evidence, the employer can avoid 
a finding of an unfair labor practice by showing that it would 
have taken the action regardless of the employee’s union ac-
tivities.  
 
[S] ubstantial evidence supports a finding that the company 
harbored animus, including (1) the timing of Steele’s firing, 
which coincided with his increased efforts to organize a union; 
(2) the coercive interrogation of Steele regarding his interest 
in forming a union; (3) management’s questioning of other em-
ployees about their interest in forming a union; and 
(4)  DeRossett’s warning that the bindery department would 
close if employees unionized. Thus, the Board met its burden 
of establishing antiunion animus.  
 
Multi-Ad claims as an affirmative defense that it fired 
Steele for leaving three meetings without permission. The 
Board concluded, however, that Multi-Ad’s proffered reason 
was   pretextual   and that the company fired Steele because of 
his efforts to unionize. That conclusion is supported by sub-
stantial evidence, including (1) Multi-Ad’s written explanation 
of termination stating a different reason—that he was dis-
charged because he refused to abide by corporate policies; 
(2) the September 4 encounter was not a “meeting”—Steele 
entered the office to pick up materials to which he was legally 
entitled and twice denied access; and (3) no manager 
 instructed Steele to remain at the previous two meetings, both 
of which occurred after shift hours. . . .

was used to interview employees in small groups of five or 
six. The employees had previously visited that office to 
 discuss grievances and obtain loans. That office was the

manager’s remarks were temperate and  noncoercive . The 
union lost the election. Should that result be set aside for 
unlawful campaigning? Explain. See  NVF Company, 
 Hartwell Division , 210 NLRB 663 (1974).  
 Union Persuasion 
  Unions, like employers, are restricted in the type of preelection persuasion they employ. 
In cases involving promises of benefits made by the union, the NLRB has been more reluc-
tant to set aside elections than it has when such promises have been made by management. 
The Board’s reasoning is that employees realize that union preelection promises are 
merely expressions of a union platform, so to speak. Employees  recognize that these are 
benefits for which the union intends to fight. Employers, on the other hand, really do hold 
the power to confer or withdraw benefits.  Nonetheless, a union 
promise to employees to provide “the biggest party in the history of 
Texas” if the union won the next day’s election was an unfair labor 
practice.  49 
 Remedies for Election Misconduct 
 Unfair labor practices during a representation election can result in the imposition of pen-
alties and remedies. If the union loses the election and the employer engaged in wrongful 
behavior, a new election or other remedies may be ordered.  
 Decertification 
 After a union has been certified or recognized, an employee or group of employees may 
continue to resist the union or may lose confidence in it. If so, they can file a decertifica-
tion petition with the NLRB. The employees must be able to demonstrate at least 30 per-
cent support for their petition. Once a decertification petition is properly filed with the 
board the usual election rules are followed to determine whether the union enjoys continu-
ing majority support. If not, the union is decertified, and ordinarily at least one year must 
pass before a new representation election can be conducted. [For management advice 
about decertification, see   www.nrtw.org/d/decert.htm ] 
 Withdrawal of Recognition 
 An employer may unilaterally withdraw recognition of a union that has lost the support 
of a majority of its members. Objective evidence such as a petition signed by a majority 
of unit employer is required. The NLRB will review the petition and its specific lan-
guage, however, to make sure that it shows employees’ desire to decline union represen-
tation. For example, a petition entitled: “showing of interest for decertification” was 
found to be insufficient evidence, while a petition’s statement of “wish for a vote to re-
move the Union” is more likely to show whether employees no longer desire the union’s 
representation. 50

 history of Texas.”

Chapter Fourteen   Employment Law III: Labor–Management Relations  625
 Escape the Union? 
  If a union clearly is about to win a representation election or already has done so, thus es-
tablishing its right to collective bargaining, management sometimes continues to resist. 
One strategy is to declare bankruptcy. That tactic may be lawful but only after bargaining 
sincerely with the union and only after convincing the bankruptcy court that fairness re-
quires modification or rejection of the collective-bargaining agreement. Similarly, a com-
pany may simply choose to shut down its business rather than engage in collective 
bargaining. Going out of business is fully lawful unless the reason for doing so was to 
discourage union efforts at plants in other locations.  Likewise, 
 companies sometimes employ the  runaway shop  strategy in which 
the about-to-be-unionized plant is simply shut down and replaced 
by another in a location less responsive to union interests. If that 
move was made for the purpose of thwarting union interests, it is an 
unfair labor practice, but if the move reflected legitimate economic goals such as reduced 
wages or taxes, the move is probably lawful. 
 The Union as Exclusive Bargaining Agent 
  Once a union has been elected and certified as the representative of a bargaining unit, it 
becomes the exclusive agent for all of the employees within that bargaining unit, whether 
they voted for the union or not. The exclusivity of the union’s authority has a number of 
implications, but one is particularly relevant in determining whether an employer has 
failed to demonstrate good faith at the bargaining table. Specifically, the employer must 
deal with the certified representative who acts on behalf of all employees in the bargaining 
unit. The employer commits an unfair labor practice if she or he attempts to deal directly 
with the employees or recognizes someone other than the workers’ chosen representative. 
In both instances, the issue is fairly straightforward. The employer is undermining the 
 position of the representative by ignoring him or her. 
 Companies sometimes 
 employ the  runaway shop 
strategy. 
 Part Four—Collective Bargaining 
  Section 8(a)(5) of the NLRA requires an employer to engage in  good-faith collective 
 bargaining with a representative of the employees, and Section 8(b)(3) imposes the same 
duty on labor organizations. Failure to bargain by either an employer or representative of 
the employees constitutes an unfair labor practice. 
 
  What is collective bargaining? What must one do to discharge the duty imposed? 
 According to Section 8(d) of the NRLA, 
 To bargain collectively is the performance of the mutual obligation of the employer and the 
representatives of the employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with 
 respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment . . . but such 
 obligation does not compel either party to agree to a proposal or require the making of a 
 concession. 

626  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 Note what is  not   included: The parties are not required to reach an agreement. Thus, the 
NLRA governs only the process, not the result, of collective bargaining.  
 Bargaining in Good Faith 
The duty to bargain in good faith obligates the union and employer to participate actively 
in the deliberations, showing a sincere and honest effort to reach common ground. Whether 
a party is bargaining in good faith is determined by the totality of the circumstances. Some 
of the objective criteria used by the NLRB in reviewing complaints asserting that this duty 
has been violated include whether the party is willing to meet at reasonable times and in-
tervals, and whether the party is represented by someone who has the  authority to make 
decisions at the table.51
 Mandatory Bargaining Subjects  Although employers and labor representatives are free 
to discuss whatever lawful subjects they mutually choose, Section 8(d) of the NLRA clearly 
sets out some mandatory subjects over which the parties must bargain. These are wages, 
hours, and “other terms and conditions of employment.” Although these topics for manda-
tory bargaining seem simple enough, questions still arise frequently. For example, suppose 
the union and employer bargain over wages and agree to institute merit increases for em-
ployees. Must the employer also bargain over which employees are entitled to receive 
these increases or who will make the decision at the time they are to be given? What about 
a decision to close a plant?  
 
 Generally, the board and the courts will balance three factors. First, they look at the 
effect of a particular decision on the workers—how direct is it and to what extent is 
the effect felt? Second, they consider the degree to which bargaining would constitute 
an intrusion into entrepreneurial interest or, from the opposite side, an intrusion into 
union affairs. Third, they examine the practice historically in the industry or the com-
pany itself. 52  
 Permissive and Prohibited Bargaining Subjects   Those matters not directly related to 
wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment and not falling within the category 
of prohibited subjects are considered permissive. Either party may raise permissive sub-
jects during the bargaining process, but neither may pursue them to the point of a bargain-
ing  impasse. Refusal to bargain over a permissive subject does not constitute an NLRA 
violation, and permissive subjects must simply be dropped if the parties do not reach 
agreement. 
 Permissive subjects ordinarily would include such items as al-
teration of a defined  bargaining unit, internal union affairs, and 
strike settlement agreements. Prohibited bargaining subjects are 
those that are illegal under the NLRA or other laws. In the case that 
follows the NLRB had to decide whether a union has a right to bar-
gain over management’s placement of hidden surveillance cameras 
in the workplace. 
 Whether a union has a right 
to bargain over 
 management’s placement of 
hidden surveillance cameras 
in the workplace.  

Chapter Fourteen   Employment Law III: Labor–Management Relations  627
or methods used by an employer to ascertain whether any of 
its employees has engaged in misconduct.  
 
The Respondent [Colgate–Palmolive] acknowledges that 
employees caught involved in theft and/or other misconduct 
are subject to discipline, including discharge. Accordingly, the 
installation and use of surveillance cameras has the potential 
to affect the continued employment of employees whose ac-
tions are being monitored.  
 
Further, as the judge finds, the use of surveillance cameras 
in the restroom and fitness center raises privacy concerns 
which add to the potential effect upon employees. We agree 
that these areas are part of the work environment and that the 
use of hidden cameras in these areas raises privacy concerns 
which impinged upon the employees’ working conditions. The 
use of cameras in these or similar circumstances is unques-
tionably germane to the working environment.  
 
With regard to the second criterion, we agree with the 
judge that the decision is not a managerial decision that lies at 
the core of entrepreneurial control.  
 * * * * * 
 
The use of surveillance cameras is not entrepreneurial in 
character, is not fundamental to the basic direction of the enter-
prise, and impinges directly upon employment security. It is a 
change in the Respondent’s methods used to reduce workplace 
theft or detect other suspected employee misconduct with seri-
ous implications for its employees’ job security, which in no way 
touches on the discretionary “core of entrepreneurial control.”  
 
The Respondent urges that bargaining before a hidden 
camera is actually installed would defeat the very purpose of 
the camera. The very existence of secret cameras, however, 
is a term and condition of employment, and is thus a legitimate 
concern for the employees’ bargaining representative. Thus, 
the placing of cameras, and the extent to which they will be 
secret or hidden, if at all, is a proper subject of negotiations 
between the Respondent and the union. Concededly, the Re-
spondent also has a legitimate concern. However, bargaining 
about hidden cameras can embrace a host of matters other 
than mere location. And, even as to location, mutual accom-
modations can and should be negotiated. The vice in the 
 instant case was the respondent’s refusal to bargain. 
 * * * * * 
 
Accordingly, we affirm the judge’s finding that the union has 
the statutory right to engage in collective bargaining over the in-
stallation and continued use of surveillance cameras, including 
 FACTS 
 Colgate–Palmolive’s Jeffersonville, Indiana, plant employed 
approximately 750 workers. Colgate and the employees had a 
collective bargaining arrangement for over 20 years. In 1994 
an employee discovered a surveillance camera in a restroom 
air vent. The union president later discussed the matter with 
Colgate’s human resources officer, who indicated that the 
camera had been placed in the vent because of theft concerns 
and that the camera had been removed after employees ob-
jected to it. The Union filed a grievance over the matter, and 
the parties met for discussion where Colgate argued that it 
had the absolute right to install internal surveillance cameras. 
Later, the Union sent a letter to Colgate demanding to bargain 
over the subject of cameras within the plant. Colgate did not 
respond, and the Union filed an unfair labor practice charge. 
The case was heard by an administrative law judge. Evidence 
indicated that Colgate had installed 11 secret cameras over 
four years to address problems of theft and misconduct, 
 including sleeping on the job. The cameras were placed in 
several offices, a fitness center, a restroom, and as a monitor 
for an overhead door that was not a proper exit from the build-
ing. The Union and some employees were aware of various 
“unhidden” cameras in the workplace and in some instances 
fortuitously discovered some of the hidden cameras.  
 
The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) concluded that the 
use of hidden surveillance cameras is a mandatory subject of 
bargaining and by failing to do so, Colgate–Palmolive violated 
the National Labor Relations Act. The  ALJ’s ruling was then 
appealed to the National Labor Relations Board. The  NLRB 
 decision follows. 
 CHAIRMAN GOULD AND MEMBERS FOX 
AND HIGGINS 
 In  Ford Motor Co. v. NLRB  , the Supreme Court described man-
datory subjects of bargaining as such matters that are “plainly 
germane to the ‘working environment’” and “not among those 
‘managerial decisions, which lie at the core of entrepreneurial 
control.’” As the judge found, the installation of surveillance 
cameras is both germane to the working environment, and 
outside the scope of managerial decisions lying at the core of 
entrepreneurial control.  
 
As to the first factor—germane to the working environ-
ment—the installation of surveillance cameras is analogous to 
physical examinations, drug/alcohol testing requirements, and 
polygraph testing, all of which the Board has found to be man-
datory subjects of bargaining. They are all investigatory tools

 Questions 
 1. What test did the ALJ and the NLRB employ to determine 
whether the placement of hidden surveillance cameras 
was a mandatory subject of bargaining?  
 2. Why did the union win this case? 
 3. If you were managing a workplace where theft, sleeping 
on the job, and other misconduct were at a worrisome 
level, would you employ hidden, secret cameras to monitor 
restrooms, fitness areas, and the like? Explain.  
 4. At an Anheuser-Busch brewing facility, a supervisor dis-
covered a table, four chairs, a number of foam mattress 
pads, and cardboard in a room where only authorized 
personnel were to be, but which was next to a break 
area. Suspecting illicit activities including illegal drug 
use, the company installed two surveillance cameras 
pointed at the entrance and stairs leading to the room. 
The cameras led to the company identifying 16 employ-
ees who engaged in misconduct. The company took 
down the cameras on June 30, 1998, and then  informed 
the  union of their existence. The company fired and 
 otherwise disciplined the employees in  question. Did 
Anheuser-Busch violate the NLRA?  Explain.  Brewers &

Chapter Fourteen   Employment Law III: Labor–Management Relations  629
 Administering the Agreement 
  Union–management bargaining does not end with the negotiation of a labor agreement. 
Rather, bargaining continues daily as the parties work out the disputes and confusions and 
conflicting interpretations that are bound to arise and that cannot be entirely provided for 
in the labor agreement. Often this process of contract maintenance takes the form of 
 resolving  grievances , as in the  Colgate–Palmolive case. Those problems are addressed 
through the grievance procedure that is included in collective-bargaining agreements. 
 Often the grievance procedure involves a series of steps beginning with informal  discussion 
mechanisms. Failing there, the dissatisfied employee typically files a written complaint 
(the grievance). Normally, grievances are presented to management by a union representative, 
often with the worker also present. 
 Arbitration 
 If, after negotiation, the parties cannot resolve their dispute, the collective-bargaining agree-
ment ordinarily provides for  final and binding arbitration . Many court decisions have 
 vigorously supported the arbitration process as the means of settling labor–management 
contract maintenance disputes and tend to find disputes  arbitrable unless the labor  agreement 
explicitly and unambiguously exempts the subject at issue from the arbitration process. 
Furthermore, but for rare exceptions, neither the company nor the union can turn to the courts 
to set aside arbitration decisions. However, in 2010 the U.S. Supreme Court held that a dispute 
between a union and employer over the ratification date of a collective-bargaining  agreement 
containing an arbitration clause should be resolved by a court rather than an arbitrator. 53  
 Fair Representation 
 Because grievance processing is part of a union’s bargaining responsibility, the union 
might breach its duty if it declined to represent an employer’s grievance. An employee 
who feels wronged when a union does not process his or her grievance has the option of 
appealing to the NLRB or to the courts. Nevertheless, as the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 
 14 Penn Plaza LLC v.  Pyett , a union may collectively bargain for an agreement providing 
that individual members’ employment discrimination claims must be submitted to arbitration. 54  
 Part Five—Labor Conflict 
 The Writers Guild of America, the union for show business 
writers, struck the television and movie industries in 2007 to 
2008 pushing for a bigger share of revenues, particularly rev-
enues from movies and television shows distributed over 
the new media, such as the Internet. The late-night talk 
shows then featuring David Letterman, Jay Leno, Conan 
O’Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, and others respected the union for 
weeks by confining their telecasts to reruns. After six 
 P R A C T I C I N G  E T H I C S  
 Union Loyalty, Employee Loyalty, or Money? 

630  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
weeks, Letterman’s production company, Worldwide 
Pants, was able to reach its own agreement with the strik-
ing union, thus allowing Letterman to return to the air with 
his full staff, including writers. The other talk shows 
 decided to return to the air without their writers, although 
their network and studio owners had not reached agree-
ments with the Writers’ Guild. Many stars, however, 
 declined to appear as talk show guests since they would 
have been forced to cross the striking writers’ picket lines 
(explained below) to appear on the shows.  
 
Leno and others argued that they needed to return to 
the air even without a strike settlement because they 
wanted to avoid laying off their many staff members 
who would have been without work if the shows stayed 
off the air. Indeed, some of those shows and hosts had 
paid their staffs while not working during the rerun 
 period, but that financial burden reportedly could not be 
sustained. O’Brien, a strong union supporter, said he 
had to decide whether to “go back to work and keep my 
staff employed or stay dark and allow 80 people, many 
of whom have worked for me for 14 years, to lose their 
jobs.” 55  
 
The 100-day strike was settled in February 2008. 
 Questions 
 1. Was it wrong of Leno, Kimmel, and the others to return 
to the air rather than continuing to honor the writers’ 
strike? Explain.  
 2. Assume you are a Jimmy Kimmel fan, and you received 
tickets to the show during the strike. Would you sup-
port the writers by refusing to attend the Kimmel show? 
Explain.  
 Strikes 
 For many, the initial image of labor conflict is one of employees on strike, picketing a store 
or factory. Striking is, however, an extremely drastic measure under which employees 
must bear an immediate loss of wages and, in many instances, risk job loss. Similarly, 
employers bear the loss of a disruption to continued operations. Work stoppages have de-
clined dramatically since World War II. However, the six-day sit-in 
of 240 workers at Chicago’s Republic Windows and Doors in 
2008—sparked by management’s announcement that the plant 
would be closing in three days—became a  national symbol of work-
ers’ frustration at the wave of layoffs around the United States. The 
sit-in succeeded in gaining bank loans for the company to meet the workers’ demands for 
60 days’ severance pay and earned vacation time under the WARN Act (see Chapter 12). 56 
 
On the other hand, a strike’s potential toll was seen in the 2012 strike at the Caterpillar 
factory in Joliet, Illinois, which lasted over three months. After workers rejected the com-
pany’s demand for a six-year wage freeze for most of the factory’s workers, at a time when 
the company was reporting record profits, more than 700 union members went on strike. 
Caterpillar had argued that wages for the higher-paid workers at the plant exceeded market 
levels. Faced with continuing a grueling strike, the workers ratified a deal with Caterpillar 
that included the wage freeze.57
 
 We will examine two kinds of strikes: 
 1.  Unfair labor practice strikes  are those instituted by workers in response to the 
 employer’s commission of an unfair labor practice such as interfering with legitimate 
union activities or failure to bargain in good faith. These strikers can be temporarily, but 
not permanently, replaced.  
 The six-day sit-in became 
a national symbol of 
workers’ frustration. 

Chapter Fourteen   Employment Law III: Labor–Management Relations  631
 2.  Economic strikes are those used purely as economic weapons to persuade employers to 
provide more favorable benefits or better working conditions. All strikes not involving 
unfair labor practices fall into this category. With some exceptions, economic strikers 
cannot be fired, but they can be permanently replaced. In what has been labeled “the 
most significant change in collective bargaining to occur since the passage of the 
 Wagner Act in 1934,” employers are now increasingly willing to permanently replace 
economic strikers. 58 Employers had enjoyed that right where necessary “in an effort to 
carry on the business” since a 1938 Supreme Court decision, but for practical reasons 
they had rarely exercised it. 59 Later decisions imposed some limitations on that right. 
For example, any striker who is permanently replaced is put on a preferential hiring list 
and will have priority to be selected to fill subsequent vacancies. However, President 
Reagan’s 1981 dismissal of 11,300 striking air traffic controllers effectively crushed 
their union (PATCO) and caused private-sector employers to reassess their long-stand-
ing reluctance to use replacements during and after strikes. 60 Thus, the use or threat to 
use permanent replacements has become a powerful tool for employers facing eco-
nomic strikes. 
 The following case examines when employers can legitimately decline to reinstate strikers. 
 Diamond Walnut Growers, 
Inc. v. NLRB 
113 F.3d 1259 (D.C. 
Cir. 1997); cert. den. 118 S.Ct.1299 (1998)  
boycott included a well-publicized national bus tour during 
which union members distributed to the public leaflets which 
described Diamond’s workforce as composed of “scabs” who 
packaged walnuts contaminated with “mold, dirt, oil, worms, 
and debris.”  
 
Approximately one year into the strike, the Board held a rep-
resentation election. The union lost the election, but its  objections 
prompted the Board to order a rerun to be held in October of 1993. 
Just over two weeks prior to the new  election, a group of four 
striking employees, represented by a union  official, approached 
Diamond with an unconditional offer to return to work. According 
to the letter presented to the  company at that time by their repre-
sentative, the employees were convinced that “a fair election 
[was] simply impossible.” Nonetheless, the employees “ fe [ lt ] that 
it [was] important that the replacement workers . . . have an 
 opportunity to hear from Union sympathizers.” Thus, the group of 
strikers was “available and willing to return to immediate active 
employment.” The following day, the union notified Diamond that 
 Circuit Judge  Silberman 
 I 
 Diamond Walnut processes and packages walnuts for na-
tional and international distribution. . . . Diamond’s employees 
have for years been represented by Cannery Workers, Pro-
cessors, Warehousemen, and Helpers Local 601 of the Inter-
national Brotherhood of Teamsters, AFL–CIO (the union). In 
September of 1991, following expiration of the most recent 
collective-bargaining agreement between Diamond and the 
union, nearly 500 of Diamond’s permanent and seasonal em-
ployees went on strike. Diamond hired replacement workers 
to allow it to continue operations.  
 
By all accounts, the strike was, and remains, a bitter affair. 
The strikers are alleged to have engaged in various acts of vi-
olence against the replacement workers. . . . In addition, as 
part of its effort to exert economic pressure on Diamond, the 
union undertook an international boycott of its product. The 
 L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E  

pursuant to the above-quoted letter, two additional strikers were 
willing to  return to work.  
   
It is undisputed that for three of the returning strikers, 
 neither the permanent jobs they held before the strike, nor 
substantially equivalent ones, were available at the time of 
their return. Diamond placed these three in various seasonal 
jobs. Prior to the strike, Willa Miller was a quality control 
 supervisor; she was placed in a seasonal packing position 
even though a seasonal inspection job was available.  Alfonsina   
Munoz had been employed as a lift truck operator and, despite 
the availability of a seasonal forklift job, was given a seasonal 
job cracking and inspecting nuts in the growers’ inspection 
department at the front end of the production process. 
 Mohammed  Kussair , formerly an air separator machine 
 operator, was, like Munoz, placed in a seasonal cracking and 
inspecting position in the growers’ inspection department. . . .  
 
The rerun election took place as scheduled, and the union 
lost. Following that election, the General Counsel filed a com-
plaint alleging that Diamond had violated the National Labor 
Relations Act by unlawfully discriminating against Miller, Munoz, 
and   Kussair . The General Counsel alleged that because of 
their protected activity, Diamond declined to put them in cer-
tain available seasonal positions for which they were qualified 
and that were preferable to the positions in which they were 
actually placed. After a hearing, an administrative law judge 
recommended that the charges be dismissed. He found that 
Diamond had “discriminated” insofar as it had placed the 
 employees at least in part because of their protected activity, 
but he did not think that discrimination “unlawful.”  
 * * * * * 
 
[The NLRB reversed saying] “although [Diamond] was un-
der no legal obligation . . . to reinstate the strikers . . ., once it 
voluntarily decided to reinstate them, it was required to act in 
a nondiscriminatory fashion toward the strikers.” Diamond 
had discriminated against Miller, Munoz, and  Kussair , in the 
Board’s view, by declining “to place them in the [seasonal] po-
sitions of quality control assistant, lift truck operator, and 
loader, respectively, because of their union status and/or be-
cause of certain protected union activity they engaged in 
while on strike.”. . . The Board rejected the contention that the 
placements were warranted by the employer’s concern that 
the replacement workers might instigate violence against the 
three and thus justified placement in well-supervised jobs, 
since “there [was] no evidence that Miller, Munoz, or  Kussair 
were involved” in the strike-related violence allegedly causing 
Diamond’s concern. The Board also dismissed the notion that 
the placements of Miller and Munoz were justified by their 
participation in the boycott and the circulation of disparaging 
leaflets: “[T]he strikers’ conduct constituted protected . . . ac-
tivity and there is no evidence indicating that such protection 
was lost because of threats made by Miller and Munoz to 
damage or sabotage [Diamond’s] equipment or products.” 
Since Diamond had failed to justify its discrimination, the 
Board found unfair labor practices.  
 * * * * * 
 
[Diamond sought judicial review of the NLRB ruling.] 
 II 
  Diamond Walnut challenges the Board’s determination that it 
lacked substantial business justification for refusing to place 
the three employees in the specific jobs they sought—quality 
control assistant, lift truck operator, and loader. It is undis-
puted that the  Fleetwood framework governs this case. The 
General Counsel under  Fleetwood   must make out a   prima facie 
case that the employer discriminated within the meaning of 
the Act, which means the employer’s decision as to how to 
treat the three returning strikers was attributable to their pro-
tected activity.  Rose Printing establishes that a struck em-
ployer faced with an unconditional offer to return to work is 
obliged to treat the returning employee like any other appli-
cant for work (unless the employee’s former job or its substan-
tial equivalent is available, in which case the employee is 
preferred to any other applicant). But Miller and Munoz were 
not treated like any other applicant for work. Miller was quali-
fied for a seasonal position in quality control that paid 32 cents 
per hour more than the packing job to which she was 
 assigned. And Munoz was qualified to fill a forklift operating 
job, a position that paid between $2.75 and $5.00 per hour more 
than the walnut cracking and inspecting job she received. 
 Diamond admits that it took into account Miller’s and Munoz’s 
protected activity in choosing to place them in jobs that were 
objectively less desirable than those for which they were qual-
ified. Petitioner [Diamond], although it contended that the dis-
crimination was comparatively slight, does not dispute that its 
action discriminated against Munoz and Miller within the 
meaning of the Act.  
 * * * * * 
 
Under  Fleetwood , after discrimination is shown, the bur-
den shifts to the employer to establish that its treatment of the 
employees has a legitimate and substantial business justifica-
tion. Petitioner declined to give Munoz the forklift driver job 
because of its concern that driving that piece of equipment 
throughout the plant would be unduly risky in two respects. 
First, because of the bad feeling between strikers and replace-
ments, Munoz would be endangered if confronted by hostile 
632  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations

replacement workers in an isolated area. Second, since 
 Munoz had participated in the bus tour during which the union 
had accused the company of producing tainted walnuts, 
 Munoz would be tempted to engage in sabotage by using the 
11,000 pound vehicle to cause unspecified damage. As for 
Miller, who was also on the bus tour, the company declined to 
put her in the “sensitive position of quality control assistant” 
where “the final visual inspection of walnuts is made prior to 
leaving the plant.” In that position, she would have “an easy 
opportunity to let defective nuts go by undetected . . . or to 
place a foreign object into the final product, thereby legitimiz-
ing the Union’s claim of tainted walnuts.”  
 * * * * * 
 A. Munoz 
 The Board rejected petitioner’s proffered justifications for 
its placement of Munoz on the same ground as did the ALJ. 
As to Diamond’s purported fear for her safety, no evidence 
had been produced that Munoz was thought to be responsi-
ble for any violence, so there was no reason to believe she 
would have been a special target. The Board said, “[T]here 
is no specific evidence that any replacements harbored 
hostility toward these three strikers, and, if such evidence 
did exist as [Diamond] claims, we fail to see how placing 
them in the positions to which they were assigned would 
lessen the perceived danger of retaliatory acts being com-
mitted against them.” The Board discounted Diamond Wal-
nut’s contention that Munoz would be under greater 
protection if closely supervised, noting that petitioner had 
admitted that “Munoz freely roamed the plant unsupervised 
during her breaks.”  
 * * * * * 
 
As for the possibility that Munoz would engage in forklift 
sabotage, the Board was more terse, stating only that “the 
strikers’ conduct [referring to the bus tour] constituted pro-
tected . . . activity,” and there was no evidence indicating that 
such protection was lost because of threats made by Miller 
and Munoz. If Munoz had uttered specific threats of sabotage, 
however, she would have lost her protected status. . . . [T]he 
Board necessarily concluded that the possibility of Munoz en-
gaging in future sabotage by misuse of her forklift was simply 
not a sufficient risk to constitute a substantial business justifi-
cation for her treatment.  
 * * * * * 
 
Similarly, the Board was reasonable in its determination 
that the risk of Munoz engaging in sabotage while riding 
around on her 11,000 pound forklift—the petitioner seems to 
most fear her crashing the forklift into machinery—is not a 
substantial business justification for her disadvantageous 
placement in another job. Strikes tend to be hard struggles, 
and although this one may have been more bitter than most, 
there is always a potential danger of returning strikers engag-
ing in some form of sabotage. There is therefore undeniably 
some risk in employing returning strikers during a strike. But it 
could not be seriously argued that an employer cannot be 
forced to assume  any risk of sabotage, because that would be 
equivalent to holding that an employer need not take back 
strikers during an ongoing strike at all. . . .  
 * * * * * 
 B. Miller 
 The Miller case is another matter. It will be recalled that peti-
tioner declined to assign her to the post of quality control as-
sistant, the job responsible for the final inspection of walnuts 
leaving the plant (she received a job paying 32 cents an hour 
less). The Board rejected the employer’s justification, which 
was based on Miller’s participation in the product boycott and 
bus tour leafleting, saying only “the strikers’ conduct consti-
tuted protected . . . activity and there is no evidence indicating 
that such protection was lost because of threats made by 
Miller and Munoz to damage or sabotage . . . equipment or 
products.” With respect to Miller, we think the Board’s deter-
mination that petitioner’s business justification is insubstantial 
is flatly unreasonable.  
   
All strikes are a form of economic warfare, but when a union 
claims that a food product produced by a struck company is 
 actually tainted it can be thought to be using the strike equivalent 
of a nuclear bomb; the unpleasant effects will long survive the 
battle. . . . The company’s ability to sell the product . . . could well 
be destroyed.  
 * * * * * 
 
The Board’s counsel argues that it is unfair to assume that 
an employee would behave in a disloyal and improper fashion. It 
is unnecessary, however, for us to make that assumption to 
 decide the Board was unreasonable. The Board accepted 
 petitioner’s contention that Miller would have been placed 
“in the sensitive position . . . where final visual inspection of 
walnuts is made prior to leaving the plant.” Miller would there-
fore have been put in a rather acute and unusual conflict of in-
terest in which her job for her employer could be thought to 
have as a function the rebutting of her union’s claim. A similar 
conflict would be raised if she wished a bargaining unit job in 
the company’s public relations department. This conflict makes 
all too likely the possibility that Miller would be  at least 
Chapter Fourteen   Employment Law III: Labor–Management Relations  633

 inattentive to her product quality duties. . . . To make matters 
worse, any “mistake” by Miller on the  product quality control 
line would not be easily attributable to her unless petitioner paid 
someone to stand all day looking over Miller’s shoulder. . . . If 
Munoz ran her forklift into valuable  machinery, she would run a 
risk of being discovered and would therefore be deterred. But 
Miller, as a quality control assistant, could simply avert her eye 
and cause the damage with apparently little risk of discovery. . . 
.  
  
In short, she would have had a special motive, a unique 
 opportunity, and little risk of detection to cause severe harm. Both 
the risk Diamond faced in its placement of Miller was qualitatively 
different than a normal risk of sabotage, and the deterrence to 
Miller’s possible misbehavior was peculiarly inadequate.  
 * * * * * 
 
[W]e are obliged to ask in the last analysis whether the 
Board’s decision, as to whether the employer’s action was 
substantially justified by business reasons, falls within the 
broad stretch of reasonableness. In this case, at least with re-
spect to one part of the Board’s decision, we conclude the 
Board exceeded the reasonableness limits.  
 
 So ordered . 
 AFTERWORD 
 After nearly 14 years of bitter struggle, the Diamond Walnut 
strike was settled in March 2005. The settlement allowed strik-
ers to return to work with full seniority and benefits, although 
many of them had already returned to Diamond Walnut or had 
moved to other jobs. [For a time line of the Diamond Walnut 
strike, see  www.teamster.org/divisions/foodprocessing/dia-
mondwalnut/dwtimeline.htm ]  
 Questions 
  1.   Set out the two-part test the court employed to deter-
mine whether Diamond Walnut violated the National 
Labor Relations Act by discriminating against its em-
ployees because of their participation in protected un-
ion activities.  
  2.   Explain why the court found that Munoz had been wronged 
by Diamond but Miller had not.  
 3. a.  How would you vote on federal legislation banning the 
practice of permanently replacing economic strikers? 
Explain.  
 
 b.  Is there any reason to distinguish between economic 
strikers and unfair labor practice strikers? Any reason 
not to do so? Explain.  
 4. A pilots’ union, Airline Professionals Association, had a 
 collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) with freight car-
rier  Airborne Express (ABX). The union and ABX had a 
dispute about time-off provisions in the CBA. The union 
applied pressure to ABX by asking all pilots not to bid on 
open flying time not covered in the regular monthly 
schedule. ABX says it lost jobs due to the lack of pilots 
and filed a complaint saying the union was engaging in 
an illegal strike. A district court agreed with ABX, and the 
union appealed. Decide the case. Explain. See   ABX Air, 
Inc. v. Airline Professionals Assn. , 266 F.3d 392 (2001); 
cert. den. 122  S.Ct  . 1459 (2002).  
 Picketing and Boycotts 
 Primary Picketing  In addition to striking, unions often picket or boycott to publicize 
their concerns and pressure employers during the negotiating process. Picketing is the 
 familiar process of union members gathering and sometimes marching, placards in hand, 
at a place of business. Peaceful, informational picketing for a lawful purpose is protected 
by the NLRA. Some kinds of picketing, however, are forbidden, and all picketing can be 
regulated by the government to ensure public safety. Primary picketing is expressed 
 directly to the employer with whom the picketers have a dispute. Primary picketing enjoys 
broad constitutional and statutory protection, but it may be unlawful if violent or coercive. 
 Secondary Picketing/Boycotts  Secondary picketing or boycotting is directed to a business 
other than the primary employer, and ordinarily it is unlawful. That is, unions are engaging 
634  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations

Chapter Fourteen   Employment Law III: Labor–Management Relations  635
in an unfair labor practice if they threaten or coerce a third party with whom they are not 
engaged in a dispute in order to cause that third party to put pressure on the firm that is the 
real target of the union’s concern. Consider, however, the mock funeral case summarized 
below.  
 Mock Funeral 
  The Sheet Metal Workers’ union staged a mock funeral outside a Florida hospital in 2004. 
One person dressed in a “Grim Reaper” costume carrying a plastic sickle, and four “pall-
bearers” carried a prop coffin and handed out leaflets. Various somber tunes played in the 
background on a portable audio system. The leaflets detailed several malpractice lawsuits 
against the hospital with the implication that the malpractice was linked to the hospital’s 
decision to contract with nonunion labor. The demonstration was designed to pressure the 
hospital, a neutral entity, to stop doing business with the picketers’ actual target, the non-
union contractors. The “funeral” was conducted about 100 feet from the entrance and was 
separated from it by a street, a strip of grass, a hedge, and a parking lot. The hospital filed 
an unfair labor practice charge against the union claiming the funeral constituted illegal 
secondary picketing in violation of the NLRA. The NLRB issued an order commanding 
the union to cease and desist. That decision was reviewed by the federal District of Colum-
bia Court of Appeals. 
 Questions 
  1.   What constitutional law defense would you offer on behalf of the Sheet Metal Workers’ 
union? 
 2. Decide the case. Explain.

 Lockouts 
  Sometimes management takes the initiative in labor disputes by locking its doors to 
some or all of its employees. Both the NLRB and the courts allow lockouts as defensive 
acts to protect businesses against sudden strikes and to prevent sabotage or violence. 
Some court decisions have also expanded lawful lockouts to include those of an offen-
sive nature designed to improve management’s bargaining position. Lockouts, however, 
are clearly not lawful if designed to interfere with bargaining rights and other legitimate 
union activity.  
Sports fans have learned some labor law in recent years. National 
Hockey League  owners locked out players and eventually canceled 
the entire 2004 to 2005 season. Major league baseball has survived 
 several lockouts and player strikes in the last four decades. 
 Sports fans have learned 
some labor law. 

636  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 Question 
 George A. Hormel & Co. and the United Food and Commercial Workers Union settled a 
long labor dispute. Thereafter, an unhappy, long-term employee, Robert  Langemeier , 
drove his car in a parade and attended a rally, both of which were designed to encourage a 
nationwide boycott of Hormel Products. The employee did nothing to signal his feelings 
beyond his presence at the two events. 
 
 Employees may lawfully be dismissed for disloyalty to their employer. Supporting a 
boycott of an employer’s products ordinarily constitutes disloyalty except where (1) the 
boycott is related to an ongoing labor dispute and (2) the support does not amount to 
 disparagement of the employer’s product. 
 
 Was this Hormel employee,  Langemeier , engaged in protected activity such that his 
dismissal was unlawful? Explain. See  George A. Hormel and Company v. National Labor 
Relations Board  , 962 F.2d 1061 (D.C. Cir. 1992).  
 Part Six—Employees’ Rights within or Against the Union 
 The Union’s Duty of Fair Representation 
 As you have seen in previous sections of this chapter, the union is given statutory  authority 
to be the exclusive bargaining agent for the employees in the designated  bargaining unit. 
This means that even if an individual employee in the bargaining unit does not agree with 
union policies or is not a member of the union, he or she cannot bargain individually with 
the employer. Such an employee is bound by the terms of the collective-bargaining agree-
ment, and the union has a duty to fairly represent that  employee and all members of the 
bargaining unit, whether or not they become members of the union.  
 The Bill of Rights of Labor Organization Members 
 The Bill of Rights for members of labor organizations is contained in Title 1, Section 101 
of the Labor–Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA or Landrum–Griffin 
Act). The Bill of Rights was designed to ensure equal voting rights, the right to sue the 
union, and the rights of free speech and assembly. These rights of union members are 
 tempered by the union’s right to enact and enforce “reasonable rules governing the respon-
sibilities of its members.”  61 
 Union Security Agreements and Right-to-Work Laws 
 To maintain their membership, unions typically seek a collective-bargaining clause requir-
ing all employees to become union members after they have been employed for some 
 period—generally 30 days ( union shop agreements  )—or, at the least, requiring them to 
pay union dues and fees ( agency shop agreements ). These “union security arrangements” 
are lawful under the NLRA. 
 
 Under the 1988 Supreme Court decision in  Communications Workers of America v. 
Beck 62 nonunion employees can be compelled to pay union dues and fees only for core 

Chapter Fourteen   Employment Law III: Labor–Management Relations  637
collective bargaining activities. Thus, nonunion employees’ agency shop dues and fees 
must be reduced by an amount equal to that applied to such  noncore purposes as lobbying 
and political campaigning. Similarly, public-sector unions with agency shop agreements 
can bill nonmembers for nonpolitical expenses related to collective bargaining but cannot 
require these members to fund political projects. In its 2012 decision in Knox v. SEIU, the 
U.S. Supreme Court reviewed whether a union’s special assessment for a “political fight-
back fund,” aimed at two ballot initiatives the union opposed, required the union to provide 
nonunion employees with notice to allow them to opt out of  paying into the fund. The 
court held that the union must gain the affirmative consent of the nonunion employees 
before imposing such an assessment on them.63
 Right to Work  At this writing, twenty-four states including traditionally union strong-
holds, Indiana and Michigan, have enacted right-to-work laws that prohibit union security 
arrangements in collective-bargaining agreements. In these states, nonmembers do not pay 
dues or fees, but as members of the bargaining unit, they must be represented by the union. 
Unions regard those employees as free riders, but right-to-work supporters see the matter 
as one of personal freedom. [For questions and answers on right-to-work laws, see   www
.nrtw.org/a/a_prime.htm ] 
 Closed Shop  At one time, powerful unions insisted on   closed-shop arrangements wherein 
employers could hire only individuals who already belonged to unions, but those arrange-
ments are now forbidden by the NLRA. 
 The Labor War and Dreamliner 
 Airplane manufacturer Boeing announced in 2009 its intention to open a second assembly 
line in a nonunion South Carolina facility to supplement its production of the company’s 
wide-body “787  Dreamliner ” at its union-organized Seattle-area plants. The expansion 
was not viewed by the company as a dilution of work in Washington, since it has been 
adding jobs in that state. Union officials, however, saw the decision as a transfer of jobs. 
Boeing’s plan would create about 1,000 new jobs in South Carolina, a right-to-work state. 
Boeing expected to produce seven  Dreamliners per month in Washington and three in 
South  Carolina.  
 
 In March 2010, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers 
filed unfair labor practice charges against Boeing claiming that the decision to open the 
second production line in South Carolina was made in retaliation for its workers’ past 
strikes in the state of Washington and to discourage them from striking in the future. If the 
union claims are accurate, that strategy would violate the National Labor Relations Act. In 
internal documents and statements to media, Boeing officials had cited strike activity and 
the threat of future such activity as motivations for the South Carolina decision. One 
 Boeing executive, for example, said “We cannot afford to have a work stoppage, you 
know, every three years.”  
 
 In April 2011, the NLRB issued a complaint against Boeing alleging a violation of 
federal labor law for coercing employees and, in effect, discriminating against the union by 
being motivated to place the new work in a right-to-work state in order to avoid the union 

638  Unit Four  Employer–Employee Relations
 presence. Section 8(a) of the NLRA provides that it is an unfair labor practice to “interfere 
with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed” under the act. 
Similarly, employers may not encourage or discourage union membership “by discrimination 
in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment.” The 
NLRB complaint seeks a court order requiring Boeing to operate the second production 
line in Washington. In December 2011, the NLRB withdrew its complaint against Boeing, 
after the company and the union entered a contract that included building another jet in the 
Seattle area. The union leaders dropped their opposition to having some 787 Dreamliners 
built in South Carolina.  
 Questions 
 1. a.  In your judgment, should the NLRB compel Boeing to keep the second production 
line in Washington State? Explain.
 
b.  In your judgment, should the NLRB have the authority to countermand Boeing’s 
business decision?  
 2. In your judgment, would the nation be healthier, economically and otherwise, if all 
states enacted right-to-work laws? Explain.

 Part Seven—Other Unions 
 Public-Sector Unions 
 The public sector is a growth area for union membership. In 2013, 7.2 million public- 
sector employees belonged to a union, compared with 7.3 million union workers in the 
private sector. 64 However, the union membership rate for public-sector workers is more 
than five times higher than the rate for private-sector workers.  65  In 2011, the states of 
 Wisconsin and Ohio approved legislation dramatically limiting public-sector workers’ 
 collective-bargaining rights (both prohibit bargaining over health coverage and pensions), 
and many other states are considering similar measures. The cutbacks in union authority 
are defended as necessary to curb workers’ wages and benefits, but critics view the move-
ment as a general  assault on unions.
   
Legal regulation of public-sector labor–management relations begins with state law. 
Although the specific provisions of those laws vary, many NLRA concepts have been 
adopted. Some fundamental policies and doctrines are quite different, however. A particu-
lar  distinction lies in the ability of public-sector employees to strike.  
 
Some states prohibit those strikes and others permit them only under restricted conditions. 
In either case, the rationale for treating public employees differently than private-sector 
employees is the role of public employees as servants of the voters. Public servants arguably 
have a higher duty than private employees. In addition, certain public employees, includ-
ing police officers and firefighters, work in positions that clearly involve public safety, and 
to permit them to strike might endanger the citizenry.

can do. 
 2. Explain how to file an unfair labor practice (ULP) claim. 
  1. As an employee of a BMW car dealership, Becker complained on his Facebook page 
about his employer serving hot dogs and potato chips at the launch of the BMW 5  Series. 
On the day of the event, at the adjacent Land Rover dealership also owned by Becker’s 
employer, a 13-year-old drove a Land Rover into a pond. Becker took photos of the ac-
cident, which he also posted on his Facebook page along with some sarcastic  comments. 
After a meeting with the general manager and other supervisors, in which Becker was 
confronted about his Facebook postings, Becker was fired. Did his termination violate 
the NLRA? Explain. See Karl Knaus Motors, Inc., NLRB Case 13–CA–046452 (2012)
[[http://www.nlrb.gov/case/13-CA-046452]. 
  2. The Eugene, Oregon Register-Guard newspaper maintained a company policy prohib-
iting employees from using company communications systems such as e-mail to “so-
licit or proselytize for commercial ventures, religious or political causes, outside 
organizations, or other nonjob-related solicitations.” Employees, however, had not 
been disciplined for using the e-mail system to invite coworkers to parties, sell sports 
tickets, etc. Suzi Prozanski, an employee and union president, used the employer’s 
 e-mail system to send three union-related messages to other employees at their work 
addresses. She was disciplined under the company policy. Did the Register-Guard vio-
late the NLRA in disciplining Prozanski? Explain. See Register-Guard v. NLRB, 571 
F.3d 53 (D.C. Cir. 2009). 
  3. You are the human resources manager for a manufacturing firm that is presently the 
subject of an organizing campaign by a union that has filed an election petition with 
the NLRB just 30 days ago. Your plant manager has come to you and said that she 
wishes to discharge one of her employees. She further explains that the employee in 
question has worked for the company for three years and throughout that time has had 
a terrible attendance record. She adds that up to this point the employee has not re-
ceived any discipline for his attendance. Upon inquiry, the plant manager tells you that 
the employee has been seen on the plant floor wearing a button that says: “Union 
Yes!” In addition, the plant manager tells you that she knows that the employee is an 
outspoken union activist. How would you advise the plant manager? Explain.  
  4. ACE/CO, a Milwaukee automobile parts manufacturer, was accused of a series of un-
fair labor practices springing from company conduct both before and after a disputed 
union representation election. Among the charges were the following:  
 
 •  ACE/CO declined to grant its usual across-the-board wage increases and told em-
ployees that the union was responsible for the failure to grant a raise. 
 
 •  ACE/CO distributed a memorandum asking employees to inform supervisors 
whenever they felt pressured to sign a union authorization card. One employee 
testifi ed that union representatives had visited his home 13 times and that he did 
feel “pressured” to support the union.

  5. When assistant manager Diane  Gorrell was fired from a Bob Evans restaurant in East 
Peoria, Illinois, most of the employees walked off the job in protest. They stood outside 
the restaurant for a time and discouraged customers from entering. The restaurant was 
left in some disarray and problems persisted for a number of days, clearly harming 
business. Later all but one of the employees asked to return to their jobs, but were refused.

a week, and are docked three days’ wages if they miss one day’s work. Managers’ in-
structions to turn off safety mechanisms to increase workers’ speed have resulted in 
serious injuries. Managers and workers stated that Ford accounts for approximately 
four-fifths of Yuwei’s total production. Should American corporations be held respon-
sible for their global suppliers’ oppressive working conditions? Explain.66
  7. Midwestern Personnel Services provided truck drivers to employers in Indiana, 
 Kentucky, and other locations. Midwestern wanted the drivers to join a union so they 
would be allowed to enter a unionized workplace, AK Steel, where they were to de-
liver cement. Midwestern management favored Teamsters Local 836 in Middletown, 
Ohio, for their drivers, but a majority of the drivers voted to join Teamsters Local 215 
in Evansville, Indiana. Midwestern refused to recognize Local 215; management and 
the drivers could not reach agreement about pension rights and contract length; and the 
drivers went on strike. The drivers later made an unconditional offer to return to work, 
but Midwestern would not allow them to return because, in its view, the drivers were 
economic strikers. The NLRB concluded that the drivers were motivated in part by 
unfair labor practices, and thus should be reinstated to their jobs. Were the drivers 
 entitled to reinstatement? Explain. See  NLRB v. Midwestern Personnel Services , 
322 F.3d 969 (7th Cir. 2003).  
   8.   Local 582 engaged in an economic strike against Broadview Dairy of Spokane, 
 Washington. Local 582 tried to distribute handbills at several Albertson’s groceries in

but some groups, such as Boy Scouts and area schools, were allowed on company

property to make solicitations. Albertson’s ordered the union members off its property. 
Later, Albertson’s ordered union organizers off its property where they were trying to 
encourage Albertson’s employees to join their union. Local 582 filed an unfair labor 
practices charge against Albertson’s. Does Albertson’s have the right to exclude from 
its property  nonemployee union representatives who engage in either  nonorganizing or

declined to appeal to arbitration on Kirby’s behalf. The UAW said that Kirby had no 
right to appeal because he had allowed his union membership to lapse. Kirby then filed

Introduction
Doubtless the government and lawsuits should not always protect us from our own foolish-
ness, but costly consumer fraud and other forms of consumer abuse (invasion of privacy, 
dangerous products, identity theft, false advertising, and so on) are not unusual in our 
consumption-driven lives. Historically, we relied on the market to address those problems; 
but in recent decades legislatures, courts, and administrative agencies have developed laws 
and rulings to protect us where the market arguably has failed. This chapter surveys some 
of those legal interventions.
 
For-profit schools like the University of Phoenix and Kaplan enroll nearly 2 million 
students, but the government is concerned that deceptive marketing practices, fraudulent 
claims about job placement, and huge student loan burdens are denying many of those 
students the better future they are seeking.
Chelsi Miller was managing a burger joint when she saw an ad for Everest University promising a 
better life. The single mother in a small town near Salt Lake City wanted an associate’s degree as 

Chapter Fifteen  Consumer Protection  647
a first step toward medical school. She said she chose Everest, a for-profit college, after a recruiter 
guaranteed that she could apply her credits toward a higher degree at the University of Utah.1
Once Miller graduated in 2008, she learned that her credits would not transfer. After two 
years of school and $30,000 in student loans, Miller says she was sold “a lemon.” Miller’s 
experience was not unusual. Although public and private nonprofit colleges typically achieve 
graduation rates around 65 percent, the comparable number at the for-profits often falls below 
30 percent, and those students are more likely to default on their student loans and have 
greater difficulty securing jobs than their nonprofit counterparts.2 Indeed, government figures 
show that for-profits have twice the federal student loan default rate of public colleges.3 Fur-
ther, the for-profits are routinely accused of using high-pressure sales tactics and false prom-
ises to lure students. In response, the federal government imposed “gainful employment” 
regulations designed to cut off aid to colleges with poor job placement rates. After a federal 
court held in 2012 that the government had failed to provide a clear rationale for its new rules, 
new regulations were released in 2014, based in part on the mortgage industry’s standard for 
sustainable levels of debt.4 Meanwhile, the market seems to be asserting itself as for-profit 
enrollment has been falling and the industry leader, the University of Phoenix, has closed 
many of its locations. The schools defend themselves, in part, by saying that the students have 
more “risk factors” than traditional college students. Do you think higher education admis-
sions practices are best left to the market, or is more aggressive government oversight needed?
Part One—Common-Law Consumer Protection
Later in this chapter we will explore government efforts to protect consumers from danger-
ous products, unfair lending practices, and the like. Before turning to that legislation, we 
need to appreciate the common law (judge-made law) that preceded and, in some respects, 
provided the foundation for the many federal, state, and local initiatives of recent years. In 
addition to the product liability protection (negligence, warranties, and strict liability) 
 discussed in Chapter 7, injured consumers can look to several common-law protections, 
including actions for fraud, misrepresentation, and unconscionability. [For an extensive 
menu of consumer law sites, see www.lectlaw.com/tcos.html]
Fraud and Innocent Misrepresentation
If the market is to operate efficiently, the buyer must be able to rely on the truth of the 
seller’s product claims. Regrettably, willful untruths appear to be common in American 
commerce. A victim of fraud is entitled to rescind the contract in question and to seek 
damages, including, in cases of malice, a punitive recovery. Although fraud arises in 
countless situations and is difficult to define, the legal community has generally adopted 
the following elements, each of which must be proved:
1. Misrepresentation of a material fact.
2. The misrepresentation was intentional.
3. The injured party justifiably relied on the misrepresentation.
4. Injury resulted.

648  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
Several class-action lawsuits were filed against Anheuser-
Busch (AB) in 2013 claiming the brewing giant had inten-
tionally watered down some of its beer products during the 
brewing process. The plaintiffs allege that AB intentionally 
deceived buyers by selling beer such as Budweiser, Bud 
Ice, and Michelob with less alcohol than was indicated on 
product labels. 
Questions
1. Evidence indicates that many buyers do not read beer 
labels and perhaps do not care about precise alcohol 
content. Given that evidence, if AB did, in fact, dilute its 
beer, would that dilution constitute an ethical wrong? 
Explain.
2. Have you noticed other instances of arguable con-
sumer fraud in your daily life? Explain.

In identifying a fraudulent expression, the law distinguishes between statements of 
 objective, verifiable facts and simple expressions of opinion. The latter ordinarily are not 
fraudulent even if erroneous. Thus normal sales puffing (“This baby is the greatest little 
car you’re ever gonna drive”) is fully lawful, and consumers are expected to exercise good 
judgment in responding to such claims. If a misleading expression of opinion comes from 
an expert, however, and the other party does not share that expertise (such as in the sale of 
a diamond engagement ring), a court probably would offer a remedy.
Did Apple Deceive Laptop Buyers?
Vitt, an Apple iBook G4 laptop purchaser, sued Apple, claiming that advertising words 
including “mobile,” “durable,” “rugged,” “reliable,” and “high value” allegedly consti-
tuted a misrepresentation of the durability, portability, and quality of the laptop. Vitt’s 
laptop failed soon after the expiration of its one-year warranty. Vitt argued that it should be 
expected to last for “at least a couple of years.” In Vitt’s view, Apple’s ads caused buyers 
to believe the computer was of better quality than it turned out to be. Was Vitt a victim of 
a misrepresentation? Explain.
Sources: See Vitt v. Apple Computer, Inc., 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 4419.
 
Of course, fraud can involve false conduct as well as false expression. A familiar exam-
ple is the car seller who rolls back an odometer with the result that the buyer is misled.
 
A variation on the general theme of fraud is innocent misrepresentation, which differs 
from fraud only in that the falsehood was unintentional. The wrongdoer believed the state-
ment or conduct in question to be true, but he or she was mistaken. In such cases, the 
wronged party may secure rescission of the contract, but ordinarily damages are not 
awarded. The following case involves a fraud claim against Harley-Davidson.

Tietsworth v. Harley-Davidson 
677 N.W.2d 233 (Wis. S.Ct. 2004)
 
The amended complaint further alleges that if the plaintiffs 
had known of the engine defect, they either would not have 
purchased the product or would have paid less for it. The 
amended complaint does not allege that the plaintiffs’ motor-
cycles have actually suffered engine failure, have malfunc-
tioned in any way, or are reasonably certain to fail or 
malfunction. Nor does the amended complaint allege any 
property damage or personal injury arising out of the engine 
defect. Rather, the amended complaint alleges that the plain-
tiffs’ motorcycles have diminished value, including diminished 
resale value, because Harley motorcycles equipped with 
 TC-88 engines have demonstrated a “propensity” for prema-
ture engine failure and/or fail prematurely.
* * * * *
DISCUSSION
Common-Law Fraud Claim
The plaintiffs’ common-law fraud claim is premised on the al-
legation that Harley failed to disclose or concealed the exist-
ence of the cam bearing defect prior to the plaintiffs’ purchases 
of their motorcycles. It is well established that a nondisclosure 
is not actionable as a misrepresentation tort unless there is a 
duty to disclose. Ollerman v. O’Rourke Co., Inc., 94 Wis.2d 17, 
26, 288 N.W.2d 95 (1980). Our decision in Ollerman outlined the 
three categories of misrepresentation in Wisconsin law—
intentional misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, 
and strict responsibility misrepresentation—and described the 
common and distinct elements of the three torts.
 
All misrepresentation claims share the following required 
 elements: (1) the defendant must have made a representation of 
fact to the plaintiff; (2) the representation of fact must be false; 
and (3) the plaintiff must have believed and relied on the misrepre-
sentation to his detriment or damage. The plaintiffs here allege 
intentional misrepresentation, which carries the following addi-
tional elements: (4) the defendant must have made the misrepre-
sentation with knowledge that it was false or recklessly without 
caring whether it was true or false; and (5) the defendant must 
have made the misrepresentation with intent to deceive and to 
induce the plaintiff to act on it to his detriment or damage.
 
Ollerman reiterated the general rule that in a sales or busi-
ness transaction, “silence, a failure to disclose a fact, is not an 
intentional misrepresentation unless the seller has a duty to 
 disclose.” The existence and scope of a duty to disclose are 
questions of law for the court. Ollerman held that “a subdivider–
vendor of a residential lot has a duty to a ‘noncommercial’ 
Justice Diane S. Sykes
The circuit court dismissed the entire action for failure to state 
a claim. [T]he court of appeals reinstated [the claims.]

FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Plaintiff Steven C. Tietsworth and the members of the pro-
posed class own or lease 1999 or early-2000 model year Harley 
motorcycles equipped with Twin Cam 88 or Twin Cam 88B en-
gines. Harley’s marketing and advertising literature contained 
the following statement about the TC-88 engines:
Developing [the TC-88s] was a six-year process. . . . The 
result is a masterpiece. We studied everything from the way 
oil moves through the inside, to the way a rocker cover 
does its job of staying oil-tight. Only 21 functional parts 
carry over into the new design. What does carry over is the 
power of a Harley-Davidson™ engine, only more so.
Harley also stated that the motorcycles were “premium” qual-
ity, and described the TC-88 engine as “eighty-eight cubic 
inches filled to the brim with torque and ready to take you 
thundering down the road.”
 
On January 22, 2001, Harley sent a letter to Tietsworth and 
other owners of Harley motorcycles informing them that “the 
rear cam bearing in a small number of Harley-Davidson’s Twin 
Cam 88 engines has failed. While it is unlikely that you will ever 
have to worry about this situation, you have our assurance 
that Harley-Davidson is committed to your satisfaction.” The 
letter went on to explain that the company was extending the 
warranty on the cam bearing from the standard one-year/
unlimited mileage warranty to a five-year/50,000 mile warranty. 
Separately, Harley developed a $495 “cam bearing repair kit” 
and made the kit available to its dealers and service depart-
ments “to expedite rear cam bearing repair.”
* * * * *
 
The amended complaint alleges that the cam bearing mech-
anism in the 1999 and early-2000 model year TC-88 engines is 
inherently defective, causing an unreasonably dangerous pro-
pensity for premature engine failure. [T]he amended complaint 
alleged that Harley’s failure to disclose the cam bearing defect 
induced the plaintiffs to purchase their motorcycles by causing 
them to reasonably rely upon Harley’s representations regard-
ing the “premium” quality of the motorcycles.

 purchaser to disclose facts which are known to the vendor, 
which are material to the transaction, and which are not readily 
discernible to the purchaser.” We specified that this was a “nar-
row holding,” premised on  certain policy considerations present 
in noncommercial real estate transactions.
 
The transactions at issue here, however, are motorcycle 
purchases, not residential real estate purchases, and it is 
an open question whether the duty to disclose recognized 
in  Ollerman extends more broadly to sales of consumer 
goods. . . .
No Legally Cognizable Injury
Ollerman also held that damages in intentional misrepresenta-
tion cases are measured according to the “benefit of the bar-
gain” rule, “typically stated as the difference between the 
value of the property as represented and its actual value as 
purchased.”. . .
 
[W]e have generally held that a tort claim is not capable of 
present enforcement (and therefore does not accrue) unless 
the plaintiff has suffered actual damage. . . . Actual damage is 
harm that has already occurred or is “reasonably certain” to 
occur in the future. . . . Actual damage is not the mere possibil-
ity of future harm. . . . [T]he amended complaint must 
 adequately plead an  actual injury—a loss or damage that has 
already occurred or is reasonably certain to occur—in order 
to state an actionable fraud claim. . . .
 
The injury complained of here is diminution in value only—
the plaintiffs allege that their motorcycles are worth less than 
they paid for them. However, the amended complaint does not 
allege that the plaintiffs’ motorcycles have diminished value 
because their engines have failed, will fail, or are reasonably 
certain to fail as a result of the TC-88 cam bearing defect. The 
amended complaint does not allege that the plaintiffs have 
sold their motorcycles at a loss because of the alleged engine 
defect. The amended complaint alleges only that the motorcy-
cles have diminished value—primarily diminished potential 
resale value—because Harley motorcycles equipped with 
 TC-88 engines have demonstrated a “propensity” for prema-
ture engine failure and/or will fail as a result of the cam bear-
ing defect. This is insufficient to state a legally cognizable 
injury for purposes of a fraud claim.
 
Diminished value premised upon a mere possibility of 
 future product failure is too speculative and uncertain to sup-
port a fraud claim. The plaintiffs do not specifically allege that 
their particular motorcycles will fail prematurely, only that the 
Harley product line that consists of motorcycles with TC-88 
engines has demonstrated a propensity for premature engine 
failure. An allegation that a particular product line fails prema-
turely does not constitute an allegation that the plaintiffs’ par-
ticular motorcycles will do so, only that there is a possibility 
that they will do so.
 
We certainly agree with the court of appeals that the dam-
age allegations in a fraud complaint are not evaluated against 
a standard of “absolute certainty” for purposes of a motion to 
dismiss for failure to state a claim. But an allegation that a 
product is diminished in value because of an event or circum-
stance that might—or might not—occur in the future is 
 inherently conjectural and does not allege actual benefit-of-
the-bargain damages with the “reasonable certainty” required 
to state a fraud claim.

Questions
1. a.  According to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, under what 
circumstances might the nondisclosure by a seller of a 
defect constitute misrepresentation?
 
b.  Did the court find that Harley-Davidson had a duty to 
disclose in this case? Explain.
2. a.  What injury, if any, do the plaintiffs claim they suffered 
in this episode?
 
b.  According to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, must a 
plaintiff in a fraud action prove that he or she has suf-
fered actual damages prior to bringing a claim? Explain.
 
c.  What is the “benefit of the bargain” rule?
3.   Why did the Wisconsin Supreme Court rule for the 
 defendant Harley-Davidson in this case?
4.   Robert McGlothlin, an employee of Thomson Consumer 
Electronics in Bloomington, Indiana, was injured while 
loading televisions into a semitrailer when the trailer’s 
“landing gear” (retractable legs that support the front of 
the trailer when it is not attached to the semitractor) col-
lapsed. McGlothlin sued the owner of the trailer, among 
others, claiming that the defendants’ repair and inspection 
procedures for latent (hidden) defects were inadequate. 
Should the court treat latent defects differently than pat-
ent (observable) defects in determining when a legal duty 
exists? Explain. See McGlothlin v. M & U Trucking, 688 
N.E.2d 1243 (Ind. S.Ct. 1997).

Chapter Fifteen  Consumer Protection  651
Part Two—The Consumer and Government Regulation of Business
State Laws
Having looked at the common-law foundation of consumer protection, we turn to some of 
the many governmental measures that provide shelter in the marketplace. Many states have 
enacted comprehensive consumer protection statutes. States also have specific statutes ad-
dressing such problems as door-to-door sales, debtor protection, and telemarketing fraud. 
We will look at a pair of high-interest consumer loan situations as well as state “lemon 
laws,” which address the particularly frustrating problem of a hopelessly defective vehicle.
Unconscionable Contracts
The doctrine of unconscionability emerged from court decisions where jurists  concluded 
that some contracts are so unfair or oppressive as to demand intervention. (Unconsciona-
bility is also included in state statutory laws via the Uniform Commercial Code 2—302.) 
The legal system intrudes on contracts only with the greatest reluctance. Mere foolishness 
or want of knowledge does not constitute grounds for unconscionability, nor is a contract 
unconscionable and hence unenforceable merely because one party is spectacularly clever 
and the other is not. Unconscionability can take either or both of two forms:
1. Procedural unconscionability. The bargaining power of the parties was so unequal that 
the agreement, as a practical matter, was not freely entered. Procedural unconscionabil-
ity usually arises from lack of knowledge (e.g., fine print) or lack of choice (e.g., urgent 
circumstances).
2. Substantive unconscionability. The clause or contract in question was so manifestly 
one-sided, oppressive, or unfair as to “shock the conscience of the court.” A contract 
that does not provide a remedy for a breach, or contract terms completely out of line 
with the relative risks assumed by the parties are among the conditions that might lead 
to a finding of substantive unconscionability.
Payday Loans  
When Jeffrey Smith of Phoenix needed money quickly to pay a medical bill, he took out a 
string of payday loans (short-term, high-interest loans to be paid back with the borrower’s 
next pay check) and fell into a downward spiral that found him calling in sick to work to 
give himself time to drive all over the city taking out new loans to cover those coming due. 
The result was bankruptcy along with thoughts of suicide by his despondent wife. Annual 
interest rates on those loans were as high as 459 percent.
 
At least 15 states now ban these loans and others cap interest rates. Loan volume is down 
considerably, but customers are estimated to number about 12 million annually. Looking for 
new profit centers, a few of the most mainstream of big banks, such as Wells Fargo and U.S. 
Bancorp, have begun offering a payday loan variant labeled direct deposit advance loans. 
The banks lend to current customers and repay themselves by deducting the amount due 
from the customer’s account after the next paycheck has been deposited. Other big banks 
have established new payday profit lines by joining with smaller online lending operations

Lemon Laws New car purchases are covered by warranty laws (see Chapter 7 for a discussion 
of UCC warranty provisions and the federal Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act); in addition, all 
50 states have some form of law designed to provide recourse for con-
sumers whose new vehicles turn out to be defective such that they can-
not be repaired after a reasonable effort. The quarrel, of course, is about 
when a car is truly a lemon. Lemon laws differ significantly from state 
to state, but they often cover new cars for one to two years or up to 
24,000 miles after purchase. Typically, state laws provide that the vehicle must have been re-
turned to the manufacturer or dealer three or four times to repair the same defect and that defect 
must substantially impair the value or safety of the vehicle, or the vehicle must have been una-
vailable to the consumer for a total of at least 30 days in a 12-month period. A vehicle meeting 
either or both of those tests often would be a lemon, and the purchaser would be entitled to a 
replacement vehicle or full refund of the purchase price. In some states, used cars may also be 
treated as lemons. In almost all states, the  determination about whether a car is a lemon is han-
dled by an arbitration panel. If dissatisfied with the ruling, the consumer may then file suit.
 
The case that follows examines Minnesota’s lemon law requirements. [For lemon laws

frame, engine, transmission, and certain electrical compo-
nents. Sipe purchased the motor home for $105,616.75, and 
Brambillas delivered it to Sipe on October 21, 2004. Sipe re-
ceived an owner’s manual with the motor home that contained 
Workhorse’s limited warranty for the chassis.
 
Sipe began experiencing problems with the motor home’s 
engine shortly after he bought it. The engine stalled on three 
occasions while being driven by Sipe, once in  October 2004, 
once in May 2005, and once in June 2005. Sipe brought the 
Circuit Judge GRUENDER
I. BACKGROUND
On September 18, 2004, Paul Sipe purchased a motor home 
manufactured by Fleetwood Motor Homes of Pennsylvania, 
Inc. (“Fleetwood”), from Brambillas, Inc. (“Brambillas”), an au-
thorized Fleetwood motor home dealer and repair facility lo-
cated in Minnesota. Workhorse manufactured the motor 
home’s chassis, which included the motor home’s supporting 
L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E
sometimes operated by offshore entities or Native Americans. Payday lenders make the 
online loans and the big banks provide service for those loans. Interest to the online lenders 
and service fees to the big banks mount up and borrowers are quickly buried in debt.
 
Federal rules, proposed at this writing in 2013, would require big banks, among other 
things, to consider ability to pay before making payday-style, short-term loans. Whether 
more federal rules and existing state laws advance fairness, or simply reduce the availabil-
ity of loans and increase interest rates is the subject of debate.

agents, or its authorized dealer during the term of the applica-
ble express warranties or during the period of two years 
 following the date of original delivery of the new motor vehicle 
to a consumer, whichever is the earlier date.”
1. Engine Stalls
After thoroughly reviewing the record, we conclude that Sipe 
failed to present evidence showing a genuine issue of material 
fact about whether the engine stalls “substantially impair[ed] 
the use or market value of the motor [home],” as required by 
Minnesota’s lemon law. In response to being asked if the en-
gine defect “ever prevented [him] from going somewhere [or] 
taking a trip with [his] motor home,” Sipe replied “no.” In fact, 
Sipe traveled over 11,000 miles in the motor home since the 
first time the engine stalled. As Sipe explained, “I don’t know if 
[the engine problem] affect[s] my use now because I know 
how to deal with it.” Sipe also stated that he had not experi-
enced an engine stall since June 2005. Thus, Sipe’s own testi-
mony shows that the engine defect has not impaired his use of 
the motor home; it follows that the defect has not substantially 
impaired his use.
 
With respect to the effect of the engine defect on the mar-
ket value of the motor home, Sipe argues that the low number 
of offers he received for the motor home shows that its market 
value was substantially impaired. However, Sipe cannot avoid 
summary judgment by merely relying on his conclusory allega-
tion that the engine defect caused the low number of offers. 
Sipe presented no evidence to suggest that his receipt of only 
two offers was in any way caused by the engine stalls and not 
some other factor, such as market conditions for used motor 
homes. He offered no evidence that potential buyers were 
even aware of the engine stalls, given that he described the 
motor home as being in “excellent condition” when he origi-
nally listed it for sale in February 2006. Sipe testified that he 
only reduced the original asking price to the Kelley Blue Book 
value because of a crack in the kitchen counter and that he 
did not recall any other defects “that played a role in reducing 
the price.” Further, Sipe submitted no other evidence suggest-
ing that the value of the motor home was impaired, such as 
expert testimony or an appraisal of the motor home. As with 
his testimony regarding his use of the motor home, Sipe’s own 
testimony shows that the engine defect has not impaired, sub-
stantially or otherwise, the motor home’s market value.
* * * * *
2. Transmission Fluid Leaks
When he received the motor home in October 2004, Sipe re-
ceived a three-year limited warranty from Workhorse. Thus, to 
bring an actionable lemon law claim, Sipe must have reported 
any nonconformities within two years of the date of the original 
motor home to Brambillas for repairs after each stalling inci-
dent. After the first incident, Brambillas conducted diagnostic 
tests but made no repairs because it found no defect in the 
engine. Sipe testified in his deposition that after the second 
and third incidents, Brambillas claimed it performed diagnos-
tic tests and found no defect but that the work order he re-
ceived contained no indication that Brambillas performed any 
such tests. Sipe further testified that the last time the engine 
stalled was in June 2005 and that the engine problem has not 
prevented him from taking trips in the motor home.
 
In February 2006, Sipe listed the motor home for sale for 
the price of $94,900. After receiving only two offers at lower 
prices, Sipe reduced the listing price to $84,900, the Kelley 
Blue Book value of the motor home. Sipe testified that he ulti-
mately decided to reduce the price because of a crack in the 
kitchen counter and that he did not recall any other defects 
that contributed to his decision to reduce the asking price. 
Sipe did not sell the motor home.
 
In January 2007 and December 2007, Sipe experienced 
problems with the motor home’s transmission when he discov-
ered that transmission fluid had leaked. Sipe testified that 
Brambillas refused to diagnose or repair the transmission af-
ter both incidents of fluid leakage.
 
Sipe brought this action against Workhorse and Fleetwood 
in the District Court for Hennepin County, Minnesota, alleging 
violations of Minnesota’s lemon law. . . . The court dismissed 
Sipe’s lemon law claims, finding that Sipe presented no evi-
dence that the alleged engine defect required repair or that the 
defect substantially impaired the motor home and concluding 
that Sipe’s claim regarding the transmission was time-barred.
* * * * *
II. DISCUSSION
A. Lemon Law
Sipe contends that the district court erred in granting sum-
mary judgment to Workhorse on his lemon law claim because 
Workhorse failed to repair his motor home’s engine and trans-
mission. Minnesota’s lemon law provides:
If the manufacturer, its agents, or its authorized dealers are 
unable to conform the new motor vehicle to any applicable 
express warranty by repairing or correcting any defect or 
condition which substantially impairs the use or market value 
of the motor vehicle to the consumer after a reasonable 
number of attempts, the manufacturer shall either replace the 
new motor vehicle with a comparable motor vehicle or accept 
return of the vehicle from the consumer and refund to the 
consumer the full purchase price. . . .
 
The manufacturer must make the required repairs if “the 
consumer reports the nonconformity to the manufacturer, its

3. Dieter and Hermes agreed to buy a new 1996 Dodge Ram 
pickup truck from Fascona Chrysler-Plymouth-Dodge 
Trucks on December 12, 1995. They requested the installa-
tion of some after-market accessories—a tonneau cover, 
a bug shield, and rust proofing. When Dieter and Hermes 
returned to take delivery of the truck, they noticed it had 
been scratched during the installation of the accessories. 
The salesperson told them the scratches would be re-
paired. Four months later the dealership sent the truck to a 
body shop for repairs. After repair, Dieter and Hermes no-
ticed swirl marks in the truck’s finish. Dieter then de-
manded that Frascona repurchase the truck. Eight months 
later Dieter and Hermes sued Chrysler Corporation under 
Wisconsin’s lemon law.

subdiv. 2 (requiring consumers to report a nonconformity “during 
the term of the applicable express warranties or during the period 
of two years following the date of original delivery of the new 
 motor vehicle . . ., whichever is the earlier date”). Sipe first reported 
the transmission fluid leak to Brambillas in January 2007, which 
was more than two years after the delivery of the motor home. As 
such, we agree with the district court that Sipe’s lemon law claim 
with respect to the transmission leaks is barred by statute.

Federal Laws and Consumer Protection Agencies
Much of the federal government’s authority to protect consumers rests with some powerful 
agencies including a new one approved in 2010 when Congress and President Obama con-
cluded that our financial markets had failed in some important respects.
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
Placing a bold bet on the capacity of the federal government to protect consumers, Con-
gress and President Obama approved the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau (CFPB) as a direct response to the financial calamity of recent years. The new 
agency, authorized by the 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act, is charged with writing and enforcing rules covering consumer financial products and 
services including mortgages, credit cards, payday loans, loan servicing, check cashing, 
debt collection, and others. Another important element of the Bureau’s charge is to provide 
financial education, thereby promoting Americans’ financial literacy. [For the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau home page, see www.consumerfinance.gov/]
[For a CFPB video explaining the Bureau’s mission, see www.consumerfinance.gov
/the-bureau/]
 
Rather than counting on market forces to ensure financial transparency and fair treat-
ment for consumers, new rules are being created in an effort to mandate those results. 
Broadly, the Bureau will be expected to prohibit and prevent the commission of “an 

Chapter Fifteen  Consumer Protection  655
 unfair, deceptive, or abusive act or practice” in conjunction with a consumer financial 
product or service. The expectation is that the Bureau will protect us from a wide array 
of dishonest practices such as hidden credit card fees and misleading “teaser” rates for 
mortgages.
 
The Act generally accords the Bureau authority over financial service firms, including 
banks, thrifts, and credit unions, though it specifically excludes real estate brokerages, ac-
countants, lawyers, and those selling nonfinancial goods and services, among others. The 
Bureau’s new rules must be subjected to cost–benefit reviews, and those rules can be set 
aside by a two-thirds vote of the new Financial Stability Oversight Council (created as part 
of the Dodd–Frank bill) if the rule would threaten the nation’s financial system.
 
Having broad authority over federal consumer finance law, the Bureau is consolidating 
consumer finance programs currently residing in other agencies, and it is responsible for 
enforcing the finance laws outlined later in this chapter, including the Electronic Fund 
Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, and many 
more. The CFPB quickly asserted its regulatory authority. In 2013, the Bureau began ad-
dressing the mortgage problems that led to the recent financial meltdown. For example, 
one new rule spells out standards for ensuring that borrowers will be able to afford their 
mortgages, and another new rule requires lenders to provide borrowers with direct and 
ongoing access to loan servicing personnel. And in 2012, the CFPB set up an online portal 
where consumers can file complaints about credit cards, mortgages, banking, student 
loans, and more (see consumerfinance.gov/complaint). Those complaints are easily ac-
cessible to the public, thus imposing pressure on financial institutions to improve customer 
service.
 
Of course, the Bureau has many doubters and outright enemies. A primary fear is that 
increased government regulation is likely to reduce the availability of credit or raise the 
cost of that credit, thereby potentially damaging  consumers and the 
economy. Some of the critics simply want the government to leave 
the finance market alone while others  suggest, for example, that 
government resources should be limited to consumer education and 
counseling rather than more rules. [For a “one-stop shop for the American people to learn 
how to protect themselves from fraud and to report it wherever—and however—it occurs,” 
see the Federal Financial Fraud Task Force’s website: www.stopfraud.gov]
The Federal Trade Commission
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was created in 1914 to prevent “unfair methods of 
competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in and affecting commerce.” The FTC 
operates as a miniature government with powerful quasi-legislative (rule-making) and 
quasi-judicial (adjudication) roles. [For the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection home 
page, see www.ftc.gov/bcp/index.shtml]
Rule Making
The FTC’s primary legislative direction is in issuing trade regulation rules to enforce the 
intent of broadly drawn congressional legislation. That is, the rules specify particular acts 
or practices that the commission deems deceptive.
The Bureau has many doubters 
and outright enemies.

656  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
 
The FTC’s quasi-legislative (rule-making) power is extensive, as evidenced by the 
 following examples:
• The Federal Trade Commission’s Do Not Call Registry forbids telemarketers, with cer-
tain exceptions, from placing calls to the more than 200 million Americans who have 
added their phone numbers to the Federal Trade Commission’s list. Although some vio-
lations continue, the rule has clearly been a success for annoyed consumers. The FTC 
also issued a 2009 rule banning many types of so-called robocalls (prerecorded telemar-
keting solicitations). Under the rule, sellers and telemarketers who transmit prerecorded 
messages to consumers who have not agreed in writing to accept those messages will 
face penalties of up to $16,000 per call. [Those wanting to be added to the Do Not Call 
list and those wanting to file complaints can visit www.donotcall.gov]
•  In 2009, the Los Angeles Times asked: “Does a moment pass 
when Kim Kardashian isn’t selling? If she’s not hyping her 
workout video, she’s touting her online shoe club, her new book 
or her sisters’ ‘reality’ TV spin-off, a gripping look inside their 
high-end  Miami boutique.”5
Kardashian and all others hyping products and services on the  Internet are now subject to 
penalties for false or misleading advertising if they fail to comply with the FTC’s “Guides 
Concerning Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.” The rules, among other 
things, require those offering endorsements on new media sites (blogs, Twitter, Facebook, 
etc.) to disclose any connection they have (including in most cases, receiving cash or gifts) in 
exchange for their testimonials.
Adjudication
On its own initiative or as a result of a citizen complaint, the FTC may investigate suspect 
trade practices. At that point the FTC may drop the proceeding, settle the matter, or issue a 
formal complaint.
 
Where a formal complaint is issued, the matter proceeds essentially as a trial con-
ducted before an administrative law judge. The FTC has no authority to impose criminal 
sanctions.
Federal Trade Commission—Fraud and Deception
Unfair and deceptive trade practices, including those in advertising, are forbidden under 
Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC test for deception requires that 
the claim is (1) false or likely to mislead the reasonable consumer and (2) material to the 
consumer’s decision making.  Deception can take many forms, including, for example, tes-
timonials by celebrities who do not use the endorsed product or do not have meaningful 
expertise. Product quality claims are an area of particular dispute.
Quality Claims
Under the FTC’s ad substantiation program, advertisers are engaging in unfair and deceptive 
practices if they make product claims without some reasonable foundation for those claims. 
Skechers, for example, agreed to pay $50 million in 2012 to settle FTC and state charges that 
it  misled the public by making unsupported claims that its toning sneakers  allow buyers to, 
“Does a moment pass 
when Kim Kardashian isn’t 
selling?”

Chapter Fifteen  Consumer Protection  657
among other things, “Shape Up While You Walk” and “Get in Shape without Setting Foot in 
a Gym.” According to the FTC, a Skechers’ ad said that its fitness claims were backed by a 
chiropractor study. The study, however, did not produce the claimed results, and Skechers 
failed to disclose that the chiropractor was married to a Skechers executive and that the chi-
ropractor was paid for doing the study.6 Skechers denied the FTC allegations. Shoe purchas-
ers are eligible for refunds ranging from $20 to $84 per product purchased. An FTC survey 
found that nearly 11 percent of American adults were victims of fraud in 2011.7 Weight-loss 
products and prize promotions were the most common types of fraudulent products.
Federal Trade Commission—Consumer Privacy
Kellie Droste, a Maricopa, Arizona, resident was shocked in March 2013 when she learned 
that an identity thief had stolen her personal information and filed a tax return in her name 
to claim her tax refund.8 According to the federal Justice Department, credit card data theft 
grew 50 percent from 2005 to 2010.9 Millions of stolen card numbers are for sale at a price 
of perhaps $10 to $50 each, and a no-limit American Express card issued to a consumer 
with a high credit rating might sell for hundreds of dollars.10 When businesses are hacked, 
millions of credit records may be compromised at a cost of an estimated $150 to $250 for 
each number stolen.11 Of course, those costs are passed on to consumers. Despite these 
staggering numbers and the prospect for even greater losses in the future, identity theft 
expert Adam Levin reminds us that we don’t seem to pay much attention:
Despite considerable coverage and legislative initiatives, identity theft, cyber warfare, and 
the death of privacy at the hands of hackers and hyper-marketers are barely on the public 
 radar. People say they care about identity theft but they don’t really understand it.12
A 2013 federal government study found that 1 in 14 Americans age 16 and older were ei-
ther targets of identity theft or actually experienced identity theft. The resulting financial 
losses for 2012 totaled nearly $25 billion.13 [For a privacy database and links, see www
.privacyrights.org].
Privacy Law
The Federal Trade Commission’s authority to stop unfair methods of competition along 
with unfair and deceptive acts and practices gives the agency considerable power in polic-
ing consumer privacy breaches. The FTC also enforces the privacy provisions in a number 
of other federal laws, including those addressing the use of consumer credit reports, chil-
dren’s online privacy, identity theft, personal health information, personal financial infor-
mation, and others. In 2011, the FTC began enforcing its “Red Flags Rule” that is designed 
to slow identity theft. Under the rule, all “financial institutions” and “creditors” must es-
tablish a written program to prevent identity theft in their organizations and then mitigate 
whatever losses may come from identity theft. The FTC identifies “Red Flags” as, for ex-
ample, suspicious documents, financial account activities, or IDs .
 
As needed, the FTC has been aggressive in privacy enforcement, having recently 
reached agreements with both Google and Facebook to settle Commission charges of pri-
vacy violations. Furthermore, the FTC in 2012 called for Congress to enact additional 
general privacy legislation along with several other new laws to address expanding threats 
in our technology-driven culture. In addition, the Obama administration in 2012 issued 

658  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
a Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, which addresses how businesses collect and use 
 consumers’ personal information and outlines core principles such as the expectation that 
consumers should control how their information will be used in the market. The adminis-
tration expects to work with the various stakeholders in developing voluntary, but legally 
enforceable, codes of conduct that implement the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights. Of 
course, rule-enhanced privacy comes with significant costs because constricted informa-
tion flow risks reduced efficiency and increased costs. 
 
The Federal Trade Commission recognizes the need for active engagement, especially 
in hot-button areas, such as a global “Do Not Track” standard that would strengthen users’ 
ability to control when and how their online information is collected. In 2013, FTC Chair 
Edith Ramirez made it very clear, however, that the Commission should use its authority 
“very judiciously.”14 Speaking of the FTC’s power to police unfairness in the market, 
Ramirez said, “I want to just emphasize that that’s not a blank check for the FTC in going 
after privacy violations.”15 The market and self-regulation, from the FTC point of view, 
must remain the core methods for assuring consumer privacy. 
The Consumer Product Safety Commission
Another reason to avoid sleeping with an ex: fear of contracting lead poisoning. Just ask 
 Barbie, who got it from Ken. That’s according to “Toxic Toys: A Poisonous Affair,” a 
 YouTube attack on the Consumer Product Safety Commission produced by the nonprofit 
Campaign for America’s Future.16
 
The Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is the federal agency charged 
with protecting us from “unreasonable risks of injury and death” from consumer prod-
ucts. The YouTube attack was a product of frustration with the CPSC’s response to a 
2007 wave of toy recalls, largely because of dangerous levels of lead. Tens of millions 
of toys and children’s items, most of them made in China, have been recalled in recent 
years. Widespread outrage over the lead risk led to the Consumer Product Safety Im-
provement Act that, among other things, lowered permissible levels of lead in children’s 
(up to age 12) products. Critics, however, argued that the bill created excessive, unneces-
sary, and unintended costs, especially for small businesses. Responding to those concerns, 
Congress and President Obama in 2011 approved new legislation giving the CPSC greatly 
expanded latitude to grant exceptions to the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act in 
situations where risk to human health does not exist.
Cribs  After more than 30 infant and toddler deaths and millions of 
recalls in the past decade, the CPSC unanimously voted to ban, 
 effective June 28, 2011, the manufacture, sale, and resale (including 
yard sales) of the traditional drop-side baby crib that has cradled millions. The new stand-
ard requires fixed sides.17
[For an ABC News visit to the Consumer Product Safety Commission Testing Lab, see http:

Reducing Risk  The CPSC, created in 1972, is responsible for reducing the risks in using 
consumer products such as toys, lawn mowers, washing machines, bicycles, fireworks, 
More than 30 infant and 
toddler deaths.

Chapter Fifteen  Consumer Protection  659
pools, portable heaters, and household chemicals. The CPSC pursues product safety, 
 initially, by collecting data and issuing rules. The commission conducts research and 
 collects information as a foundation for regulating product safety. Via its rule-making 
 authority, the CPSC promulgates mandatory consumer product safety, performance, and 
labeling standards.
 
To enforce its policies and decisions, the CPSC holds both compliance and enforcement 
powers. In seeking compliance with safety expectations, the commission can exert a num-
ber of expectations. Manufacturers must certify before distribution that products meet fed-
eral safety standards. Manufacturing sites may be inspected, and specific product safety 
testing procedures can be mandated. Businesses other than retailers are required to keep 
product safety records. In cases of severe and imminent hazards, the CPSC has the power 
to enforce its decisions by seeking a court order to remove a product from the market. In 
less-urgent circumstances, the commission may proceed with its own administrative rem-
edy. Preferring voluntary compliance, the commission may negotiate with companies to 
recall dangerous products. Product recalls issued in 2011 by the CPSC, the Food and Drug 
Administration, and the Department of Agriculture totaled 2,363 (up from 1,460 in 2007).18 
The result presumably is improved consumer safety, but we have some evidence of “recall 
fatigue.” A 2009 study found 40 percent of Americans indicating they have never looked 
for recalled products in their home.19 [For the federal government recall site, see www.
recalls.gov/]
 
Where voluntary negotiations fail, the commission may proceed with an adjudicative 
hearing before an administrative law judge or members of the commission. That decision 
may be appealed to the full commission and thereafter to the federal court of appeals. Civil 
or criminal penalties may result. Only a few products, such as the drop-side cribs, have 
 actually been banned from the market by the Commission. The CPSC launched a public 
database in 2011 that allows all of us to report dangerous products and to search com-
plaints entered by others. [See http://saferproducts.gov/]
The Food and Drug Administration
Tobacco  The Food and Drug Administration announced in 2013 that it had begun exer-
cising its authority over tobacco; power conferred by Congress and President Obama in 
2009. For the first time, the FDA can keep tobacco products off the market if they pose 
public health risks beyond comparable products already on the market. Prior to the 2009 
legislation, the FDA could not regulate tobacco, a process that was left to the limited au-
thority of the states. The FDA can also regulate tobacco ingredients, including nicotine, 
but the agency is not yet exercising that power.
Drug Safety  The FDA monitors much of America’s health landscape with responsibility 
for assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of food, drugs (prescription and over-
the-counter), medical devices, cosmetics, tobacco products, and more. Perhaps the biggest 
FDA duty is to decide when drugs should be approved for marketing. Companies must 
subject a new drug to laboratory, animal, and eventually human testing  before the FDA 
will consider approval. FDA physicians and scientists review the scientific evidence, and 
thereafter the FDA approves a drug for marketing only if it is safe and effective. The FDA 
is empowered to impose fines and remove dangerous drugs from the market. Thus, arthritis 

660  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
drug Vioxx, approved by the FDA in 1999, was pulled from the 
market in 2004 because the estimated 25 million Americans who 
took the drug faced a nearly-doubled risk of heart attack and stroke. 
An FDA study linked Vioxx to as many as 140,000 injuries and 
56,000 deaths in the United States.20 Merck, the drug’s manufacturer, has paid billions of 
dollars to settle many civil lawsuits and, in 2011, Merck agreed to pay $950 million and 
pleaded guilty to a criminal charge over Vioxx marketing and sales practices.21 Lawsuits 
continue, but at this writing no person has been penalized for the Vioxx wrongs.
Food Safety  At this writing in 2013, the FDA has announced a 
preliminary determination that artificial trans fats are not safe in 
foods. After public comment and further review, the FDA may ef-
fectively banish trans fats from processed foods by allowing them 
only with scientific proof of safety. In recent years, food safety has climbed the list of FDA 
worries following a series of massive food poisoning scares. Vegetables, peanut products, 
eggs, and other foodstuffs have been contaminated by salmonella and E. coli. The 2010 
salmonella outbreak in eggs (primarily regulated by the FDA, but assisted by the Agricul-
ture Department and other agencies) sickened more than 1,600 people and led to the recall 
of 550  million eggs.22 A 2012 salmonella outbreak in peanut butter prompted the FDA to 
force the closure of Sunland Inc.’s New Mexico production facility. FDA data show that 
one in six Americans suffers from a food-borne illness annually resulting in 3,000 deaths 
and 130,000 hospitalizations.23 
 
The 2011 Food Safety and Modernization Act gave the FDA greatly expanded food 
safety power. With about one in six Americans suffering from eating contaminated 
food each year, the FDA has proposed new rules to implement the 2011 Act. The rules 
would require farmers to make sure, for example, that irrigation water is clean and that 
animals are kept out of fields. Food manufacturers will be expected to submit food safety 
plans to the government. Imported food would be subjected to the same standards as 
 domestic production with importers being required to prove that their foreign suppliers 
have careful safety measures in place. Since the FDA is able to inspect only 1 to 2 percent 
of all imported food, the food safety burden will lie primarily with suppliers. The food in-
dustry has responded by, among other things, improving worker training and employing 
technological advances, including high-tech labels, which allow monitoring of food from 
the fields to the supermarket checkout.
Trust the Market or Strengthen the FDA?  Perhaps because of its crucial safety role in 
American life, the FDA is one of the most criticized divisions of the federal government. 
As noted, food safety worries, or at least publicity about them, seem to have spiraled in 
recent years. The drug approval process has been the subject of particularly fierce criti-
cism. New drug approvals (39) in 2012 reached their highest level in 15 years despite 
tightened safety standards following several drug scandals—Vioxx in particular.24 Never-
theless, critics argue that lifesaving new products could reach consumers much more 
quickly if we relied less on government rules and more on market forces. Reduced regula-
tion, of course, carries its own risks. For example, during a recent five-year study period, 
more than 70 percent of 113 recalled medical devices (such as defibrillators and insulin

pumps) had been approved by the FDA under an expedited system.25 The devices were 
approved for sale more quickly because they were deemed sufficiently similar to products 
already on the market. Beyond safety concerns, experts Tomas Philipson and Andrew von 
Eschenbach argue that reduced and more efficient regulation could double medical innova-
tion and sharply boost the American GDP.26 Thus, to some critics, the FDA imposes too 
many rules; to others, too few. 
Plan B
At this writing in 2013, the FDA is considering several new consumer rules including 
protection for children and adolescents from added caffeine in products such as Cracker 
Jack and a warning against tanning bed use for those under 18. The most controversial 
decision, however, has to do with the morning-after birth control pill, popularly known as 
Plan B. In early 2013, a federal judge ordered the FDA to make Plan B available without 
prescription to girls and women of all ages. The Obama administration announced that it 
would appeal the federal judge’s order, but soon thereafter the appeal was dropped and the 
FDA was expected to approve Plan B for sale over the counter without restrictions. 
Question
In your judgment, should the FDA make Plan B available to girls and women of all ages, 
to those 15 and above, to those 17 and over, as had been the case, to some other age, or not 
at all?  Explain.
Part Three—Debtor/Creditor Law
Credit Regulations
According to The New York Times, Angelique Trammel, a single 
mother and telephone operator, decided to buy a laptop for her son on a 
“low weekly payment plan.” She paid $99 down and agreed to have 
$41 per week withdrawn from her bank account. After six months, a 
broken computer arrived. Having spent well over $1,000 and after 
 having received two nonworking computers, she  demanded a refund from the retailer, 
 BlueHippo. Under her agreement, Ms. Trammel allegedly would have paid more than $2,000 
for a  computer worth much less. Describing sales schemes directed to the poor, Better Business 
Bureau spokesman Steve Cox said: “The way these companies operate is simply another form 
of predatory lending.”27 BlueHippo, on the other hand, said that, “before, during and after the 
sales transaction we fully disclose the total price and all shipping guidelines” to customers.28
 
Situations like Trammel’s and broad fears of abuse in credit and lending led Congress 
and the state legislatures to supplement the market’s powerful messages with a substantial 
array of protective legislation. We will turn now to a look at several particularly important

Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
In addition to creating the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB), the 2010 
Dodd–Frank bill provides increased legislative oversight of the nation’s financial pro-
cesses. (See Chapter 8 for the bill’s provisions designed to stabilize and protect the 
banking system.) Broadly, the bill’s consumer protection provisions move away from 
the old system that mandated disclosure to consumers of critical financial information 
(e.g., interest rates) to a more prescriptive regime that requires lenders to affirmatively 
protect borrowers.
Truth in Lending Act (TILA)
Consumers often do not understand the full cost of buying on credit. The TILA is designed 
primarily to assure full disclosure of credit terms. Having been designed for consumer 
protection, the TILA does not cover all loans. The following standards determine the TI-
LA’s applicability:
1. The debtor must be a “natural person” rather than an organization.
2. The creditor must be regularly engaged in extending credit and must be the person to 
whom the debt is initially payable. Dodd–Frank expressly amends the definition of 
creditor to include mortgage originators.
3. The purpose of the credit must be “primarily for personal, family, or household pur-
poses” not in excess of $25,000, but “consumer real property transactions” are covered 
by the act. Hence home purchases fall within TILA provisions.
4. The credit must be subject to a finance charge or payable in more than four  installments.
 
The TILA and Regulation Z interpreting the act were designed both to protect consumers 
from credit abuse and to assist them in becoming more informed about credit terms and 
costs so they could engage in comparison shopping. Congress presumed the increased infor-
mation would stimulate competition in the finance industry. The heart of the act is the re-
quired conspicuous disclosure of the amount financed, the finance charge (the actual dollar 
sum to be paid for credit), the annual percentage rate (APR—the total cost of the credit ex-
pressed at an annual rate), and the number of payments. The finance charge includes not just 
interest but service charges, points, loan fees, carrying charges, and other costs. The TILA 
covers consumer loans generally, including credit cards and auto purchases. [For consumer 
information on “abusive lending,” see www.ftc.gov/bcp/menu-lending.htm]
 
TILA amendments in the Dodd–Frank bill give extensive, new attention to residential 
mortgages, a recognition of our ongoing subprime mortgage crisis and its destructive im-
pact on the entire American economy. Creditors, for example, are prohibited from making 
a residential mortgage loan without a good faith determination that the consumer has a 
reasonable “ability to repay” the loan. Likewise mortgage service providers must, for ex-
ample, respond to error notices within a specified period of time.
 
The case that follows examines the application of TILA to a credit card interest rate 
dispute.

Barrer v. Chase Bank USA 
566 F.3d 883 (9th Cir. 2009)
specified in the Agreement, however, had occurred. When the 
Barrers contacted Chase to find out why their APR had in-
creased, Chase responded in a letter citing judgments it had 
made on the basis of information obtained from a consumer 
credit reporting agency. In particular, Chase wrote that: “out-
standing credit loan(s) on revolving accounts . . . [were] too 
high” and there were “too many recently opened installment/
revolving accounts.” The Barrers do not dispute the facts un-
derlying Chase’s judgments.
 
Despite the Barrers’ surprise, the Notice they had received 
in February contained some indication of what would be forth-
coming. Specifically, it disclosed that Chase would shortly in-
crease the APR to 24.24%, a decision “based in whole or in 
part on the information obtained in a report from the consumer 
reporting agency.”
 
The Barrers paid the interest on the credit account at the 
new rate for three months before they were able to pay off the 
balance. Then they sued Chase in federal district court.
B
The Barrers filed a class action lawsuit on their own behalf 
and on behalf of all Chase credit card customers similarly 
harmed and similarly situated. The complaint asserted one 
cause of action under the Truth in Lending Act (“the Act”), and 
Regulation Z. The Barrers claim to have been the victims of a 
practice they now call “adverse action repricing,” which ap-
parently means “raising . . . a preferred rate to an essentially 
non-preferred rate based upon information in a customer’s 
credit report.” Though the Barrers do not claim that the prac-
tice itself is illegal, they do claim that it was illegal for Chase 
not to disclose it fully to them or to the other members of the 
putative class.
 
[The federal district court dismissed the Barrers’ cause of 
action. The Barrers appealed.]
II
The Truth in Lending Act is designed “to assure a meaningful 
disclosure of credit terms so that the consumer will be able to 
compare more readily the various credit terms available to him 
and avoid the uninformed use of credit.” Rather than substan-
tively regulate the terms creditors can offer or include in their 
financial products, the Act primarily requires disclosure.

A
Walter and Cheryl Barrer held a credit card account with 
Chase. The Barrers received and accepted the Cardmember 
Agreement (“the Agreement”) governing their relationship at 
the relevant time in late 2004. In February 2005, Chase mailed 
to the Barrers a Change in Terms Notice (“the Notice”), which 
purported to amend the terms of the Agreement, in particular 
to increase the Annual Percentage Rate (“APR”) significantly. 
It also allowed the Barrers to reject the amendments in writing 
by a certain date. They did not do so, and continued to use the 
credit card. Within two months, the new, higher, APR became 
effective.
 
According to the Barrers’ First Amended Complaint, they 
enjoyed a preferred APR of 8.99% under the Agreement. In a 
section entitled “Finance Charges,” the Agreement provided a 
mathematical formula for calculating preferred and non-pre-
ferred APRs and variable rates. In the event of default, the 
Agreement stated that Chase might increase the APR on the 
balance up to a stated default rate. The Agreement specified 
the following events of default: failure to pay at least a mini-
mum payment by the due date; a credit card balance in excess 
of the credit limit on the account; failure to pay another credi-
tor when required; the return, unpaid, of a payment to Chase 
by the customer’s bank; or, should Chase close the account, 
the consumer’s failure to pay the outstanding balance at the 
time Chase has appointed.
 
Another section entirely, entitled “Changes to the Agree-
ment,” provided that Chase “can change this agreement at 
any time, . . . by adding, deleting, or modifying any provision. 
[The] right to add, delete, or modify provisions includes finan-
cial terms, such as APRs and fees.” The next section, entitled 
“Credit Information,” stated that Chase “may periodically re-
view your credit history by obtaining information from credit 
bureaus and others.” These sections appeared five and six 
pages, respectively, after the “Finance Charge” section.
 
Around April 2005, the Barrers’ noticed that their APR had 
“skyrocketed” from 8.99% to 24.24%, the latter a rate close to 
a non-preferred or default rate. None of the events of default

We are persuaded that Chase adequately disclosed the 
APRs that the Agreement permitted it to use simply by means of 
the change-in-terms provision. That provision reserved Chase’s 
right to change APRs, among other terms, without any limitation 
on why Chase could make such a change. The provision thus 
disclosed that, by changing the Agreement, Chase could use 
any APR, a class of APRs that logically includes APRs adjusted 
on the basis of adverse credit information. Apart from the gloss 
of Comment 11, neither the Act nor  Regulation Z require Chase 
to disclose the basis on which it would change or use APRs. 
Therefore the failure to disclose the reason for the change to 
the Barrers’ APR—adverse credit information—and that Chase 
would look up their credit history to acquire that information 
does not undermine the adequacy of Chase’s disclosure.
 
Even so, such disclosure must be clear and conspicuous. 
Neither the Act nor Regulation Z define clarity and conspicu-
ousness in this context. The Staff Commentary explains only 
that “[t]he clear and conspicuous standard requires that dis-
closures be in a reasonably understandable form.” . . .
 
Clear and conspicuous disclosures, therefore, are disclo-
sures that a reasonable cardholder would notice and under-
stand. No particular kind of formatting is magical, but, in this 
case, the document must have made it clear to a reasonable 
cardholder that Chase was permitted under the agreement to 
raise the APR not only for the events of default specified in the 
“Finance Terms” section, but for any reason at all.
 
. . . [T]he change-in-terms provision appears on page 10–11 
of the Agreement, five dense pages after the disclosure of 
the APR. It is neither referenced in nor clearly related to the 
“Finance Terms” section. This provision, as part of the APRs 
allowed under the contract, is buried too deeply in the fine 
print for a reasonable cardholder to realize that, in addition 
to the specific grounds for increasing the APR listed in the 
“Finance Charges” section, Chase could raise the APR for 
other reasons.
 
Therefore, the Barrers have stated a claim because Chase 
cannot show that, as a matter of law, the Agreement made 
clear and conspicuous disclosure of the APRs that Chase was 
permitted to use.
 
REVERSED and REMANDED.
Questions
1. a. How did Chase violate Regulation Z and the TILA?
 
b.  According to this decision, what is a “clear and con-
spicuous” disclosure?
2. Green Tree Financial financed Randolph’s mobile home pur-
chase. Randolph sued, claiming that Green Tree’s financing 
 creditor and consumer: at the point of solicitation and applica-
tion, at the point the consumer and the creditor consummate 
the deal, at each billing cycle, and at the point the parties re-
new their arrangement. Specifically, creditors must disclose 
“[t]he conditions under which a finance charge may be im-
posed,” “[t]he method of determining the amount of the fi-
nance charge,” and, “[w]here one or more periodic rates may 
be used to compute the finance charge, each such rate . . . 
and the corresponding nominal annual percentage rate.”
 
Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. Section 226, provides the precise 
regulations that the Barrers claim Chase violated. In general, 
these regulations establish two conditions a creditor must meet. 
“First, it must have disclosed all of the information required by 
the statute.” That is, disclosures must be complete. “And 
second, [they] must have been true—i.e., . . . accurate 
representation[s] of the legal obligations of the parties at [the] 
time [the agreement was made].”
 
Section 226.6 lists the initial disclosures required of a cred-
itor under a new credit agreement. The list includes “each 
periodic rate that may be used to compute the finance 
charge . . . and the corresponding annual percentage rate.”
* * * * *
 
Just as section 226.6 states what must be disclosed, so 
section 226 describes how to disclose it. Among other things, 
creditors must make the required disclosures “clearly and 
conspicuously in writing.” . . .
 
The Board has also recognized that creditors may reserve 
the general right to change the credit agreement, as Chase did 
in this case. Should the creditor make changes in these ways, 
it may have to disclose anew under Section 226.9(c).
III
The Barrers argue that . . . Chase failed to disclose completely 
under the Act why it would change the APRs of its cardhold-
ers, in violation of subsection 226.6(a)(2) of Regulation Z.
 
The Barrers do not argue that either the Agreement or the 
Notice failed to disclose the APR, which their complaint puts 
at 8.99% under the Agreement and 24.24% under the Notice. 
Rather, . . . the gravamen of the Barrers’ complaint is that 
Chase did not disclose that if a cardholder’s credit report re-
vealed certain information, what Chase calls “risk factors,” 
the APR might go up.
* * * * *
 
Regulation Z requires that creditors disclose any APR “that 
may be used to compute the finance charge,” and that they do 
so “clearly and conspicuously.”

Credit and Charge Cards
College students are burying themselves in debt. As of 2013, student 
loan debt (about $1 trillion) exceeded the total amount owed by all 
Americans on their credit cards.29 Student credit card use, on the other 
hand, declined to 35 percent in 2012 from 42 percent in 2010.30 That 
decline apparently was partially attributable to the 2009 federal Credit Card Accountability, 
Responsibility, and Disclosure Act (CARD Act). Among other things, CARD forbids lenders 
from issuing credit cards to those under age 21 without a parent as cosigner or without proof the 
applicant can make  payments. Many colleges and universities that have allowed credit market-
ing on campus have profited handsomely from deals with card companies. While federal rules 
have significantly curbed campus credit card marketing, about 900 colleges maintain card part-
nerships with banks, and other commercial relationships are common.31 For example, Ohio 
State University, while not allowing credit card marketing to students, reportedly receives 
$25 million from Huntington Bank in return for allowing branches and ATMs on campus. The 
deal allows Huntington the exclusive opportunity to directly tailor products and services to 
more than 600,000 students, faculty, staff, and alumni.32
Question
How would you argue that government intervention in the credit card market is not in the 
best interest of consumers generally and college students in particular?
TILA Protections 
The law offers substantial protections for credit card users. The TILA provides that credit 
cards cannot be issued to a consumer unless requested. Cardholder liability for unauthorized 
use (lost or stolen card) cannot exceed $50, and the cardholder bears no liability after notify-
ing the issuer of the missing card. In general, issuers must disclose key cost features, includ-
ing APR, annual membership fees, minimum finance charges, late payment fees, and so on.
CARD 
The aforementioned CARD Act of 2009 provides extensive additional protection for credit 
card holders. Some of the key provisions:
• Credit card companies are barred from increasing the annual percentage rate on existing 
account balances except when the cardholder’s minimum payment is 60 days overdue.

themselves in debt.

 Ameriquest. She signed a “Disclosure Statement” specify-
ing, among other things, that she was responsible for 
359 payments at a specified amount and one payment for the 
last month of a slightly smaller amount. The Statement did 
not, however, explicitly specify, as required by the TILA, the 
total payments due (360). Was the TILA violated? Explain. See 
Hamm v. Ameriquest Mortgage, 506 F.3d 525 (7th Cir. 2007).

• Issuers cannot charge interest on bills paid on time.
• Without specific agreement by the consumer, banks cannot accept charges where doing 
so puts creditors over their limits.
• Interest rates, with some exceptions, cannot be raised in the first year.
Beyond the CARD Act, other recent federal credit card rule changes have provided addi-
tional consumer shelter. Those rules cap fees for late payments, banish penalties for inac-
tive accounts (although those accounts can still simply be closed), and allow merchants to 
set a $10 minimum for credit card purchases.
Success? 
Skepticism is often the response to new rules, but the early evidence suggests that the fed-
eral government’s credit card measures have been good for consumers. A 2011 Pew study 
found that penalty fees have dropped, overlimit fees (for charges beyond the credit limit) 
are now rare, and annual fees have not proliferated as some critics expected.33 Further-
more, government officials have praised the industry itself for going even further than the 
law requires, although some banking officials believe the law has increased credit costs 
while decreasing credit availability.34
A Win for Consumers?
Debit card interchange fees (the charges paid by merchants to banks for providing debit 
processing services) had reached an average of 44¢ per transaction prior to the passage of 
the 2010 Dodd–Frank Act. By contrast, the median variable cost of each transaction was 
estimated at 7¢. Retailers and consumers argued that the two primary debit card processing 
services, Visa and MasterCard, were operating what amounted to a shared monopoly that 
permitted supracompetitive pricing. 
 
Following a battle by armies of lobbyists, Congress approved new rules allowing the 
Federal Reserve (The Fed) to cap the interchange fees. The Fed in 2011 settled on a maxi-
mum charge of 21¢ per transaction with some additional small fees and a cap exemption 
for smaller banks. Following six months of transactions under the new rules, the Fed found 
that banks subject to the cap saw a 45 percent drop in their average fees—down to 24¢—
whereas fees at smaller banks with an exemption stayed steady at about 43¢. The big banks 
say the fee cap merely shifts revenue to the big box retailers who are failing to pass on the 
fee savings to consumers. The banks also say the rule will force them to cut back on perks 
for customers while requiring new or increased fees on various services. At this writing, a 
federal district court judge has ruled that the 21¢ fee is higher than Congress intended in 
enacting Dodd–Frank. That decision has been appealed. [See NACS v. Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 107581]

Consumer Credit Reports
Do you want to borrow money for a new car or a house? Want to get a better job? Success 
in each of those efforts may depend to a considerable extent on your credit score. A favorable 
credit rating is a vital feature of consumer life, and having reliable credit information is es-
sential to efficient business practice. Thus, the three national credit information giants, Equi-
fax, Experian, and TransUnion, as well as local credit bureaus, provide retailers, employers, 
insurance companies, and others with consumers’ detailed credit histories. From those credit 
histories, a credit score is computed and sold to lenders. The federal Fair Credit Reporting 
Act (FCRA) affords consumers the following credit reporting protections, among others:
• Anyone using information from a credit reporting agency (CRA), such as Equifax, to 
take “adverse action” against you (denying you credit, a job, insurance) must notify you 
and tell you where it secured the information.
• At your request, a CRA must give you the information in your file and a list of all those 
who have recently sought information about you.
• If you claim that your credit file contains inaccurate information, the CRA must inves-
tigate your complaint and give you a written report. If you remain unsatisfied, you can 
include a brief statement in your credit file. Notice of the dispute and a summary of 
your statement normally must accompany future reports.
• All inaccurate information must be corrected or removed from the file, usually within 
30 days.
• In most cases, negative information more than seven years old must not be reported.
Credit Cards Good for the World?
By 2025 or so, Chinese residents are expected to expand their credit card holdings from 
331 million at the end of 2012 million to 1.1 billion and thereby pass the United States 
(536 million cards) as the world’s biggest credit card market by number of cards. Credit 
cards are becoming a commonplace shopping tool in the developing world. As a result, those 
consumers are joining Americans and other Westerners in struggling to repay their credit card 
debt. For ex ample, consumers in Turkey in recent years have embraced credit cards with en-
thusiasm, but having done so, they increasingly find themselves in a “debt trap” built by high 
interest rates (nearly 29 percent in 2011). Turkey has imposed some regulatory restraints, but 
consumer rights advocate, Turhan Cakar, foresees continuing problems: “Banks hand out 
cards too freely and then push a culture of consumption.” Critics are concerned that consum-
ers around the globe will be caught up in a debt cycle they often do not understand and that 
they cannot escape.

• You must provide written consent before a CRA can provide information to your em-
ployer or prospective employer.
• You can sue for damages if your rights under the act have been violated.
• Lenders are required to provide a consumer’s credit score as well as any factors that 
affected that score if the lender took any adverse action based on that score.35
The FCRA provides useful consumer protection, but serious weaknesses remain. The Federal 
Trade Commission released a 2013 study showing that 20 percent of consumers have a mate-
rial error on at least one of their credit reports. At least 5 percent of consumers suffer errors 
serious enough that they may pay more than they should for products.36 Thus, millions of 
Americans have been injured, including some who may have been denied jobs because of 
inaccurate credit reports. (Several states have limited the use of credit histories in making 
employment decisions.) When consumers try to correct their credit reports by filing com-
plaints with the ratings agencies, the FTC found that the files are modified in about 80 percent 
of the cases.37 In an effort to bring increased fairness to consumers, the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau now has supervisory authority over 30 of the largest credit bureaus, includ-
ing the three biggest. Consumers can file credit report complaints with the CFPB.
 
[For an extensive set of practical questions and answers about consumer rights under 
the Fair Credit Reporting Act, see www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fcrajump.shtm]
Fair Credit Billing Act
The Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA) provides a mechanism to deal with the billing errors that 
accompany credit card and certain other “open-end” credit transactions. A cardholder who 
receives an erroneous bill must complain in writing to the creditor within 60 days of the time 
the bill was mailed. The creditor must acknowledge receipt of the complaint within 30 days. 
Then, within two billing cycles but not more than 90 days, the creditor must issue a response 
either by correcting the account or by forwarding a written statement to the consumer explain-
ing why the bill is  accurate. The creditor cannot threaten the consumer’s credit rating or report 
the consumer as delinquent while the bill is in dispute, although the creditor can report that the 
bill is being challenged. Where a “reasonable investigation” determines the bill was correct 
but the  consumer continues to contest it, the consumer may refuse to pay, and the creditor will 
then be free to commence collection procedures after giving the consumer 10 days to pay the 
disputed amount. If the bill is reported to a credit bureau as delinquent, that report must also 
indicate the consumer’s belief that the money is not owed, and the consumer must be told who 
received the report. Wronged consumers may complain to the FTC and sue for damages.
Electronic Fund Transfers
The Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA) provides remedies for lost or stolen cards, billing 
errors, and other such problems involving ATMs, point-of-sale machines, electronic deposits, 
and the like. Under the EFTA, liability for misuse of missing cards is capped at $50 if the con-
sumer provides notice within two business days after learning of the loss. The loss could reach 
$500 if notice is provided within 60 days and could be unlimited thereafter. The Dodd–Frank 
Act amended the EFT to impose limits on debit card  interchange fees. [For consumer informa-

Equal Credit Opportunity
The Equal Credit  Opportunity Act is designed to combat bias in lending. ECOA was in large 
part a response to anger over differing treatment of women and men in the financial market-
place. Credit must be extended to all creditworthy applicants regardless of sex,  marital status, 
age, race, color, religion, national origin, good-faith exercise of rights under the Consumer 
Credit Protection Act, and receipt of public assistance (like food stamps). ECOA was in large 
part a response to anger over differing treatment of women and men  in the financial market-
place. Creditors often would not lend money to married women in the women’s own names, 
and single, divorced, and widowed women were similarly disadvantaged in securing credit. 
[For more details about ECOA, see www.ftc.gov/bcp/pubs/consumer/credit/cre15.shtm] 
The case that follows applies the ECOA to a “cross-dressing” male.
The issue in this case is not [Rosa’s] sex, but rather how he 
chose to dress when applying for a loan. Because the Act 
does not prohibit discrimination based on the manner in which 
someone dresses, Park West’s requirement that Rosa change 
his clothes does not give rise to claims of illegal discrimination. 
Further, even if Park West’s statement or action were based 
upon Rosa’s sexual orientation or perceived sexual 
orientation, the Act does not prohibit such discrimination.
 
PriceWaterhouse v. Hopkins, which Rosa relied on, was 
not to the contrary, according to the district court, because 
that case “neither holds, nor even suggests, that discrimina-
tion based merely on a person’s attire is impermissible.”
 
On appeal, Rosa says that the district court “fundamentally 
misconceived the law as applicable to the Plaintiff’s claim by 
concluding that there may be no relationship, as a matter of 
law, between telling a bank customer what to wear and sex 
discrimination.”
 
The Bank says that Rosa loses for two reasons. First, citing 
cases pertaining to gays and transsexuals, it says that the 
ECOA does not apply to cross-dressers. Second, the Bank 
says that its employee genuinely could not identify Rosa, 
which is why she asked him to go home and change.
III
The ECOA prohibits discrimination, “with respect to any as-
pect of a credit transaction[,] on the basis of race, color, 
Judge Lynch
I
[O]n July 21, 1998, [Lucas] Rosa came to the [Park West] Bank to 
apply for a loan. A biological male, he was dressed in tradition-
ally feminine attire. He requested a loan application from Norma 
Brunelle, a bank employee. Brunelle asked Rosa for identifica-
tion. Rosa produced three forms of photo identification: (1) a 
Massachusetts Department of Public Welfare Card; (2) a Mas-
sachusetts Identification Card; and (3) a Money Stop Check 
Cashing ID Card. Brunelle looked at the identification cards and 
told Rosa that she would not provide him with a loan application 
until he “went home and changed.” She said that he had to be 
dressed like one of the identification cards in which he ap-
peared in more traditionally male attire before she would pro-
vide him with a loan application and process his loan request.
II
Rosa sued the Bank. Rosa charged that “by requiring [him] to 
conform to sex stereotypes before proceeding with the credit 
transaction, [the Bank] unlawfully discriminated against [him] 
with respect to an aspect of a credit transaction on the basis 
of sex.” He claims to have suffered emotional distress.
 
Without filing an answer to the complaint, the Bank moved 
to dismiss. . . . The district court granted the Bank’s motion.

Brunelle refused to give Rosa the loan  application because she 
thought he was gay, confusing sexual orientation with cross-
dressing. If so, Rosa concedes, our precedents dictate that he 
would have no recourse under the federal Act. It is reasonable 
to infer, as well, that Brunelle simply could not ascertain 
whether the person shown in the identification card photo-
graphs was the same person that appeared before her that 
day. If this were the case, Rosa again would be out of luck. It is 
reasonable to infer, finally, that Brunelle may have had mixed 
motives, some of which fall into the prohibited category.
 
It is too early to say what the facts will show; it is apparent, 
however, that, under some set of facts within the bounds of 
the allegations and nonconclusory facts in the complaint, 
Rosa may be able to prove a claim under the ECOA.
 
We reverse and remand.
Questions
1. a.  Did the court of appeals find that Park West Bank had 
violated the ECOA? Explain.
 
b.  If at trial, the facts reveal that the bank employee thought 
Rosa was gay and demanded that he change clothes for 
that reason, who will win this case?  Explain.
 
c.  According to the court of appeals, how did the lower 
court misunderstand this case?
2. a.  Does federal law protect bank customers based on 
their style of dress? Explain.
 
b. Should it offer that protection? Explain.
 religion, national origin, sex or marital status, or age.” Thus to 
prevail, the alleged discrimination against Rosa must have 
been “on the basis of . . . sex.”
 
While the district court was correct in saying that the pro-
hibited bases of discrimination under the ECOA do not include 
style of dress or sexual orientation, that is not the discrimina-
tion alleged. It is alleged that the Bank’s actions were taken, in 
whole or in part, “on the basis of . . . [the  appellant’s] sex.” . . . 
Whatever facts emerge, and they may turn out to have nothing 
to do with sex-based discrimination, we cannot say at this 
point that the plaintiff has no  viable theory of sex discrimina-
tion consistent with the facts alleged.
 
The evidence is not yet developed, and thus it is not yet 
clear why Brunelle told Rosa to go home and change. It may be 
that this case involves an instance of disparate treatment 
based on sex in the denial of credit. . . . It is reasonable to infer 
that Brunelle told Rosa to go home and change because she 
thought that Rosa’s attire did not accord with his male gender: 
in other words, that Rosa did not receive the loan application 
because he was a man, whereas a similarly situated woman 
would have received the loan application. That is, the Bank may 
treat, for credit purposes, a woman who dresses like a man dif-
ferently than a man who dresses like a woman. If so, the Bank 
concedes, Rosa may have a claim. Indeed, under PriceWater-
house, “stereotyped remarks [including statements about 
dressing more ‘femininely’] can certainly be evidence that gen-
der played a part.” It is also reasonable to infer, though, that 
The 2010 Dodd–Frank Act includes a provision creating 
Offices of Minority and Women Inclusion at various gov-
ernment agencies (Treasury Department, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau, and so on) charged with regulating the 
banking industry. Those offices are monitoring racial and 
gender diversity at the government agencies themselves 
as well as private law firms, accounting firms, invest-
ment banks, and others contracting and subcontracting 
with the agencies. If an agency compliance director de-
termines that a contractor has not made a good faith 
 effort to achieve a diverse workforce, the contract may 
be canceled, among other possible remedies. One man-
aging director at a minority-owned investment firm said 
the law may give firms like his “a chance to compete.”

Should the government intervene to improve opportunities 
for women and minorities in the investment banking industry?

Chapter Fifteen  Consumer Protection  671
Debtor Protection
Our ongoing financial crisis, one of the most destructive of modern 
times, has thrown millions of Americans deeply in debt. Wages can 
be garnished. Debts pile up on one another. Then the debt collection 
process continues the nightmare. The New York Times in 2010 re-
counted the story of Ruth M. Owens, a disabled Cleveland woman who was sued by 
 Discover Bank in 2004 for an unpaid credit card bill. In six years, Ms. Owens had paid 
nearly $3,500 on her original balance of $1,900, but Discover sued her for $5,564 that had 
accumulated from late fees, compound interest, penalties, and charges even though she had 
not used the card to buy anything more. The judge called Discover’s behavior “uncon-
scionable” and threw out the case. Discover said that it turned the case over to a lawyer 
only after repeated unsuccessful efforts to reach Ms. Owens.38
 
Debtors are properly expected to repay what they owe, but critics claim debtors often 
are wrongly pursued. U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) explained:
It’s hard enough when families aren’t able to make enough to pay their bills, but it’s tragic 
that families who are struggling to make ends meet are hounded to make payments on debts 
that they have already paid off or that they never owed in the first place.39
Furthermore, collectors reportedly call at all hours of the night, spewing obscenities, con-
tacting family members or employers and falsely threatening property seizures or impris-
onment.40 Perhaps not surprisingly, the big banks—so broadly criticized for their roles in 
the financial meltdown—are likewise accused of involvement in unlawful debt-collection 
practices. At this writing in 2013, the state of California has sued the nation’s largest bank, 
JPMorgan Chase, for having run a “massive debt collection mill” seeking wage garnish-
ments and default orders against about 100,000 credit cardholders from 2008 to 2011. The 
complaint also accuses JPMorgan of practicing “sewer service” where the bank claims to 
have properly provided notice to the defendant-consumer of a debt-collection lawsuit 
when, in fact, notice was not provided.41 Since about one in ten Americans is dealing with 
debt collectors,42 and the consequences can be so destructive, both state and federal gov-
ernments have developed extensive legal protections for debtors.
Debt Collection Law 
The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) is designed to shield debtors from 
unfair debt collection tactics by debt collection agencies and attorneys who routinely oper-
ate as debt collectors. FDCPA does not extend to creditors who are themselves trying to 
recover money owed to them. Often employing very aggressive tactics, several thousand 
debt collection agencies nationwide pursue those who are delinquent in their debts. 
 
The FDCPA protects consumers by forbidding, among others, the following practices:
• Use of obscene language.
• Contact with third parties other than for the purpose of locating the debtor. (This provi-
sion is an attempt to prevent harm to the debtor’s reputation.)
• Use of or threats to use physical force.
The debt collection process 
continues the nightmare.

The letter further states:
The balance may not reflect the exact amount of interest 
which is accruing daily per your original agreement with your 
creditor. Contact us to find out your exact payout balance.
B
The district court . . . determined that the letter apprised Ms. 
Williams of the total amount due, including the amount of the 
principal, interest and fees due. The district court stated that, . . . 
the letter clearly advises that additional interest is accruing on 
a daily basis and that, therefore, additional interest may be 
added. Comparing this case to Taylor v. Cavalry Investment, 
L.L.C., the district court took the view that the letter complied 
with the statute because OSI’s “letter states the amount of the 
debt clearly enough so that an unsophisticated recipient 
would not misunderstand it.”
II. DISCUSSION
Ms. Williams submits that there is an issue of material fact 
as to whether OSI’s letter clearly states the amount of the 
debt, as required by the FDCPA. In examining that conten-
tion, we begin with the wording of the statute. The FDCPA 
requires that debt collectors state “the amount of the debt” 
Circuit Judge Ripple
Sandra Williams . . . sought relief under the Fair Debt Collection 
Practices Act (“FDCPA”). The district court granted the defend-
ant, OSI Educational Services, Inc., (“OSI”), summary judgment. 
Ms. Williams then filed a timely appeal to this court.
I. BACKGROUND
A
Ms. Williams is a consumer whose debt was incurred for 
personal, family or household purposes. OSI is a debt collec-
tion agency; it was hired by Great Lakes Higher Education 
Guaranty Corp. (“Great Lakes”) to collect its debts. OSI sent 
Ms. Williams a letter and a debt validation notice, dated 
March 28, 2005. The letter sought to collect a sum of $807.89 
labeled as “Total Due,” which was the outstanding balance 
owed to Great Lakes. The letter breaks down the amount 
owed as follows:
Date: 
03/28/05
Principal: 
$683.56
Interest: 
16.46
Fees: 
107.87
Total Due: 
$807.89

• Contact with the debtor during “inconvenient” hours. For debtors who are employed 
during “normal” working hours, the period from 9 pm to 8 am would probably be con-
sidered inconvenient.
• Repeated phone calls with the intent to harass.
• Contacting the debtor in an unfair, abusive, or deceptive manner.
 
The Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau jointly 
enforce the FDCPA. The CFPB also has supervisory authority over the largest debt collec-
tors—about 175 firms. Under that authority, the CFPB provides a consumer complaint–
dispute resolution process and determines whether debt collectors have harassed or 
deceived consumers along with assuring that debt collectors provide accurate information 
and fully disclose who they are and how much the consumer owes. In addition to federal 
and state regulatory protection, wronged consumers may sue for damages. [For more de-
tails about the FDCPA, see www.ftc.gov/os/statutes/fdcpajump.shtm]. The case that fol-
lows suggests some of the confusion that can arise in the debt collection process.

Chapter Fifteen  Consumer Protection  673
would be different than the stated “balance.” The plaintiff 
could have thought that “the reference to the ‘current bal-
ance’ meant that the defendant was trying to collect an addi-
tional debt [without] telling her how large an additional debt 
and thus violating the statute.” In contrast, the language in 
OSI’s letter links the difference between the “total due” and 
the “exact payout balance” to the “interest which is accruing 
daily per your original agreement with your creditor.” OSI’s 
letter thus provides the information that created the confu-
sion in the Chuway letter.
 
Ms. Williams’ second and third arguments are best treated 
together. She submits that the letter’s language leaves open 
the possibility that the actual amount due is less than the 
amount stated on the letter. She further suggests that the sen-
tence’s use of the present tense makes it possible to conclude 
that the stated amount due was not accurate on the date that 
the letter was written. In our view, both these contentions are 
based on a strained reading of the sentence. It would be “un-
realistic, peculiar, [and] bizarre” to read OSI’s letter in this 
way. Durkin. The common sense reading of the letter is that 
the balance is accurate as of the date the letter is written, but 
that the amount due will increase because of interest that is 
accruing daily. This construction is supported by the letter’s 
itemization of “PRINCIPAL,” “INTEREST,” “FEES” and “TOTAL 
DUE” in a box with, and immediately below, the “DATE.” Under 
a natural reading, the language conveys, even to an unsophis-
ticated consumer, that interest will accrue after the letter is 
sent and therefore that the consumer should call to find out 
the “exact payout balance.”
 
As we said in Chuway, “It is impossible to draft a letter that 
is certain to be understood by every person who receives it; 
only if it would confuse a significant fraction of the persons to 
whom it is directed will the defendant be liable.”
 
We believe that the language in this letter is closer to the 
language in Taylor than to the language in Chuway. In Taylor, 
the letter similarly set forth the total due and broke down that 
total into principal and interest. If further stated: “[I]f applica-
ble, your account may have or will accrue interest at a rate 
specified in your contractual agreement with the original 
creditor.” Three plaintiffs in Taylor had submitted affidavits 
stating that this sentence confused them about the amount of 
debt that the debt collector was trying to collect. We held that 
the language was “entirely clear on its face.” . . .
 
As we noted earlier, in opposing summary judgment, Ms. 
Williams relied solely on OSI’s letter. She submitted no other 
evidence to support her view that OSI’s letter is confusing. 
Without more, Ms. Williams’ unsupported assertion that OSI’s 
letter is confusing is insufficient to create a genuine issue of 
fact as to confusion.
that they are seeking to collect from the consumer. The debt 
collector’s  letter must state the amount of the debt “clearly 
enough that the recipient is likely to understand it.” Chuway 
v. Nat’/Action Fin.Servs. Inc. To ensure that this statutory 
command is implemented properly, we must evaluate the let-
ter to determine whether it causes any “confusion” or 
“misunderstand[ing]” as to the amount due. In making this 
determination, we evaluate the letter from the perspective of 
an “unsophisticated consumer or debtor.” The unsophisti-
cated consumer is “uninformed, naive, [and] trusting,” but 
possesses “rudimentary knowledge about the financial 
world, is wise enough to read collection notices with added 
care, possesses ‘reasonable intelligence,’ and is capable of 
making basic logical deductions and inferences.” Pettit v. 
Retrieval Masters Creditors Bureau, Inc. Notably, we have 
rejected explicitly the notion that we should employ the least 
sophisticated debtor standard, the “very last rung on the so-
phistication ladder” Pettit.
* * * * *
 
Our past cases indicate that summary judgment may be 
avoided by showing that the letter, on its face, will “confuse a 
substantial number of recipients.” We also have said that, ab-
sent a showing that the face of the letter will precipitate such 
a level of confusion, the “plaintiff must come forward with 
 evidence beyond the letter and beyond [her] own self-serving 
assertions that the letter is confusing in order to create a gen-
uine issue of material fact for trial.” Durkin v. Equifax Checking 
Servs (noting that evidence may consist of “carefully designed 
and conducted consumer survey[s]” or expert witnesses).
 
Ms. Williams chooses to base her case on the first of 
these options. She focuses on the following language from 
OSI’s letter:
The balance may not reflect the exact amount of interest 
which is accruing daily per your original agreement with your 
creditor. Contact us to find out your exact payout balance.
 
In her view, there are three reasons why OSI’s letter 
would confuse a substantial number of recipients. We shall 
examine each.
 
First, Ms. Williams argues that the language in OSI’s letter 
is more confusing than that in Chuway, which we held could 
“confuse a substantial number of recipients.” Chuway. In that 
case, the letter stated the “balance” and also contained the 
following language: “Please remit the balance listed above in 
the return envelope provided. To obtain your most current 
balance information, please call [phone number].” We held 
that the letter violated the FDCPA. There, the confusion arose 
because the letter did not state why the “current balance”

Foreclosure Fraud?
The mortgage industry, already buried in bad loans and worse publicity, faced another 
scandal in 2010 when the news emerged that some or perhaps many banks and individuals 
had not followed proper legal procedures in pursuing foreclosure orders against borrowers 
(commonly, the situation in which a homeowner fails to make mortgage payments and 
loses the home). Broadly, the scandal involved allegations that lenders bent rules to speed 
up the foreclosure process. Sloppy record keeping and outright errors apparently were 
routine. In a process now called “robo-signing,” bank employees sometimes signed thou-
sands of foreclosure affidavits in a single day, clearly never carefully examining them as 
expected. Critics now believe banks often cannot prove the facts necessary to achieve a 
lawful foreclosure. In some instances, the sloppy and perhaps negligent record keeping 
may even prevent banks from proving they are the legal owners of the properties being 
foreclosed on. Foreclosure proceedings were halted all over the country as bank and 
government officials reviewed records to see how common these problems were. Hun-
dreds of thousands of homeowners now believe they were foreclosed on unlawfully.
 
State and federal officials and the five biggest mortgage servicing banks (e.g., 
 JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Ally Financial) reached a 2012 settlement totaling 
$25 billion in penalties to compensate for robo signing, faulty loan processing, and wrong-
ful mortgage foreclosure practices. At least $17 billion of the settlement will go directly to 
homeowners. Many, many complaints remain, however, and at this writing, the New York 
state attorney general has indicated that he intends to sue Bank of America and Wells 
Fargo for failing to fulfill the settlement requirements.

Questions
1. a.  A debt collection letter must be evaluated to determine 
whether it causes confusion or misunderstanding for 
the consumer. What level of consumer sophistication 
was employed by the court to determine whether the 
debt collection letter to Williams caused confusion or 
misunderstanding?
 
b.  Is confusion on the part of an individual consumer con-
clusive evidence of a violation of the Fair Debt Collec-
tion Practices Act? Explain.
 
c.  Describe the two ways by which a plaintiff/consumer 
can establish that a debt collection letter caused an im-
permissible level of confusion or misunderstanding.
2. Miller owed $2,501.61 to the Star Bank of Cincinnati. Payco

among other words, in very large capital letters a demand 
for IMMEDIATE FULL PAYMENT, the words PHONE US TO-
DAY, and the word NOW in white letters nearly two inches 
tall against a red background. At the bottom of the page in 
the smallest print on the form was the message: NOTICE:

Part Four—Bankruptcy
Fresh Start? Should we lend a hand to those subprime borrowers and others who are down 
on their luck? Bankruptcy law was specifically designed to provide a fresh start for those 
whose financial problems were insurmountable. We believed that both the debtor and society 
benefited from the new beginning. As bankruptcy filings skyrocketed, however, we down-
sized the fresh start by reforming federal bankruptcy law in 2005 to 
force more bankrupt parties to repay their creditors. Following the 
reform, bankruptcies did fall somewhat in 2006 to about 618,000, 
then rose to a recession-era high of 1.6 million in 2010 before falling 
back in 2012 to about 1.2 million.43 Of course, those tough times are 
often of our own making. At this writing in 2013, American consumers owed $2.8 trillion in 
non-mortgage debt, an average of $8,900 for every person in the  nation.44
 
Thus, we have millions of Americans deep in debt and facing a troubled economy. Does 
our bankruptcy system provide the rescue we intend for those people? A recent study con-
cludes that the system falls short. Just one year following a declaration of bankruptcy, one 
in four debtors continues to struggle to pay routine bills and one in three reports a financial 
condition much the same or worse than was the case prior to the bankruptcy filing.45 With-
out steady, sufficient income, the study finds that “bankruptcy is an incomplete tool to re-
habilitate those in financial distress.”46
Bankruptcy Rules
Bankruptcy in the United States is governed exclusively by federal law; the states do not 
have the constitutional authority to enact bankruptcy legislation, but they do set their own 
rules within the limits provided by Congress. Our attention will be limited to the principal 
federal statute, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended.
 
Bankruptcy is an adjudication relieving a debtor of all or part of his/her/its liabilities. 
Any person, partnership, or corporation may seek debtor relief. Three forms of bankruptcy 
action are important to us:
1. Liquidation (Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Act), is used by both individuals and busi-
nesses. Most debts are forgiven, all assets except exemptions are fairly distributed to 
creditors, and debtors receive a “fresh start.”
2. Reorganization (Chapter 11), used by both individuals and businesses, keeps creditors 
from the debtor’s assets while the debtor, under the supervision of the court, works out 
a financial reorganization plan and continues to pay creditors.
3. Adjustment of debts of an individual with regular income (Chapter 13), in which indi-
viduals with limited debts are protected from creditors while paying their debts in 
installments. [For frequently asked bankruptcy questions and links to bankruptcy sites on 
the Internet, see www.lawtrove.com/bankruptcy].
Liquidation
A Chapter 7 liquidation petition can be voluntarily filed in federal court by the debtor, or 
creditors can seek an involuntary bankruptcy judgment. A Chapter 7 liquidation is 
 commonly called a “straight” bankruptcy.
American consumers owed 
an average of $8,900 for 
every person in the nation.

676  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
 
In a voluntary action, the debtor files a petition with the appropriate federal court. The 
court then has jurisdiction to proceed with the liquidation, and the petition becomes the 
order for relief. The debtor need not be insolvent to seek bankruptcy.
 
Creditors often can compel an involuntary bankruptcy. The debtor may challenge that 
bankruptcy action. The court will enter an order for relief if it finds the debtor has not been 
paying his or her debts when due or if most of the debtor’s property is under the control of 
a custodian for the purpose of enforcing a lien against that property.
 
After the order for relief is granted, voluntary and involuntary actions proceed in a similar 
manner. Creditors are restrained from reaching the debtor’s assets. An interim bankruptcy 
trustee is appointed by the court. The creditors then hold a meeting, and a permanent trustee is 
elected. The trustee collects the debtor’s property and converts it to money, protects the inter-
ests of the debtor and creditors, may manage the debtor’s business, and ultimately distributes 
the estate proceeds to the creditors. Debtors are allowed to keep exempt property, which varies 
from state to state but typically includes a car, a homestead, some household or personal items, 
life insurance, and other “necessities.” Normally a dollar maximum is attached to each.
 
The debtor’s nonexempt property is then divided among the creditors according to the 
priorities prescribed by statute. Secured creditors are paid first. If funds remain, “priority” 
claims, such as employees’ wages and alimony/child support, are paid. Then, funds per-
mitting, general creditors are paid. Each class must be paid in full before a class of lower 
priority will be compensated. Any remaining funds will return to the debtor.
 
When distribution is complete, the bankruptcy judge may issue an order discharging 
(relieving) the debtor of any remaining debts except for certain statutorily specified claims. 
Those include, for example, taxes and educational loans. Thus, as noted above, the debtor 
is granted a “fresh start.”
Reorganization
Under Chapter 11, the debtor may voluntarily seek reorganization, or the creditors may peti-
tion for an involuntary action. When a reorganization petition is filed with the court and re-
lief is ordered, one or more committees of creditors are appointed to participate in bankruptcy 
procedures. Typically in the case of a business, the debtor continues operations, although the 
court may appoint a trustee to replace the debtor if required because of dishonesty, fraud, or 
extreme mismanagement. The company, its bankers, and its suppliers will meet to work out 
a method for continuing operations. A plan must be developed that will satisfy the creditors 
that their interests are being served by the reorganization. Perhaps new capital is secured, or 
perhaps creditors receive some shares in the company. The plan must be approved by the 
creditors and confirmed by the court. The company is then required to carry out the plan.
GM Bankruptcy/Bailout
General Motors, in 2009, was forced to enter Chapter 11 bankruptcy as part of a federal 
government-directed, prepackaged bailout of the failing firm. GM had gone from being 
one of the most prominent corporations in the world to a sprawling, dysfunctional failure. 
GM reported $82.29 billion in assets and $172.81 billion in debts. The federal government 
put $49.5 billion into the bailout and took a 60 percent equity stake in the new General 
Motors, although the company retained control of its day-to-day affairs.

Chapter Fifteen  Consumer Protection  677
Adjustment of Debts
Under Chapter 13, individuals (not partnerships or corporations) can seek the protection of the 
court to arrange a debt adjustment plan. Chapter 13 permits only voluntary bankruptcies and 
is restricted to those with steady incomes and somewhat limited debts. The process can begin 
only with a voluntary petition from the debtor. Creditors are restrained from reaching the 
debtor’s assets. The debtor develops a repayment plan. If creditors’ interests are sufficiently 
satisfied by the plan, the court may confirm it and appoint a trustee to oversee the plan. The 
debtor may then have three to five years to make the necessary payments. [For an extensive 
bankruptcy law database, see www.law.cornell.edu/wex/Bankruptcy]
Bankruptcy Critique
The stigma that had historically attached to filing for bankruptcy dissipated somewhat in 
the “greed is good” 1980s, and bankruptcy became a more acceptable way of dealing with 
debts.47 In an effort to benefit all by reducing unjustified and sometimes fraudulent bank-
ruptcy filings, the federal Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 
2005 has forced many debtors to seek bankruptcy through the challenging Chapter 13 
process rather than the more forgiving Chapter 7. Debtors found to have some money (ac-
cording to a means test) to apply to debts are required to take the Chapter 13 route, which 
requires a repayment plan rather than the much more attractive “fresh start” of Chapter 7. 
 
Supporters of the 2005 reform argue that it reduces the cost of credit for all Americans, 
but opponents see the changes as a punitive assault on those already down on their luck. 
 
Achieving a remarkable comeback, General Motors is now consistently profitable, has 
been restored to the Standard & Poor’s 100 (after being kicked off), and is healthier than it 
has been in decades. In December 2013, the U.S. Treasury sold the government’s remain-
ing GM holdings. Taxpayer loss on the GM bailout totaled about $10 billion.
 
The rescue of GM, Chrysler, and their financing units saved an estimated 1 million 
jobs. According to a study by the Center for Automotive Research, had those jobs been 
lost, the cost to the government in reduced taxes and other negatives would have been 
nearly $29 billion. Thus, on balance, the Obama administration views the bailout as a sig-
nificant financial and social welfare success. Critics argue, however, that the deal was a 
dangerous abandonment of market principles. Some of those arguments include:
• The bailout encouraged future risky behavior by conveying the message that the gov-
ernment will always be there as a backup.
• Private investors would have moved in to cut costs and restore a new, trimmer GM.
• The $50 billion of taxpayer money could have been better spent elsewhere or not spent 
at all.
Question
Was the federal government wise to bail out General Motors, or should GM have been left 
to face the force of the market and the decisions of the Chapter 11 bankruptcy judge?

Questions
 1. A group of parents sued Gerber claiming its “Fruit Juice Snacks” product packaging 
was misleading. The words “Fruit Juice” appeared on the package beside images of 
fruits such as peaches and cherries. In fact, the only fruit juice in the “Snacks” was 
white grape from concentrate. A side panel statement said the product was made “with 
real fruit juice and other all natural ingredients,” but the primary ingredients were corn 
syrup and sugar. The side panel also displayed the statement, “one of a variety of nutri-
tious Gerber Graduates foods and juices that have been specifically designed to help 
toddlers grow up strong and healthy.” The actual ingredients were correctly listed in 
“small print” on the side of the box. Is a “reasonable consumer” “likely to be  deceived” 
by the Gerber packaging? Explain. See Williams v. Gerber Products, 523 F.3d 934 
(9th Cir. 2008).
 2. San Francisco Bay area consumers Wanda Greenwood, Ladelle Hatfield, and Deborah 
McCleese each signed up for an Aspire Visa credit card marketed by CompuCredit 
Corp. of Atlanta, Georgia. The card was advertised as a means of rebuilding cardhold-
ers’ credit histories as well as providing $300 in immediate credit, with no down 
For individuals, the reform made the process much more complicated, and the average cost 
of filing more than doubled to more than $2,000.48 During the recession, homeowners be-
hind on their house payments often found mortgage foreclosure more attractive than bank-
ruptcy. Thus, many borrowers simply walked away from their “underwater” homes, 
leaving lenders with mountains of troubled properties. (Rising home values and banks’ 
mortgage modification decisions have recently reduced the number of underwater homes.)
Commenting on the 2005 bankruptcy reform law, Todd 
 Zywicki, a George Mason University law professor, said, 
“This is a matter of morality and personal responsibility.” 
Consumer advocates, on the other hand, say the bank-
ruptcy problem lies with the “enablers”—the credit card 
companies and mortgage lenders who encourage deeper 
and deeper indebtedness.
Question
Who bears the moral blame for America’s bankruptcy 
struggles? Explain.

 payment. The consumers claimed that fees hidden in the fine print of this “fee har-
vester” agreement claimed much of the $300 with the result that they were misled 
about the card agreement’s capacity to help restore their credit. The agreement also 
included language requiring both the consumer and the company to resolve disputes 
using binding arbitration. The federal Credit Repair Organizations Act (CROA) re-
quires credit repair organizations to provide a disclosure statement to consumers say-
ing: “You have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the [Act].” The 
three consumers brought a class-action lawsuit against CompuCredit alleging a viola-
tion of CROA which, among other things, forbids deceptive practices in credit repair. 
a. CompuCredit argued that the lawsuit was barred because of the arbitration provi-
sion. As you look at the facts, do you think the consumers can sue CompuCredit, or 
must they turn to binding arbitration? Explain.
b. Recalling our discussion of arbitration in Chapter 4 and elsewhere in this text, in 
your judgment does arbitration provide an effective, efficient substitute for litiga-
tion in this CompuCredit case? Explain.
c. How might a ruling favoring arbitration encourage fraud by credit card companies? 
See CompuCredit Corp. v. Wanda Greenwood, et al., 132 S.Ct. 665 (2012).
 3. DeSantis sued a debt collection agency, Computer Credit. DeSantis apparently owed 
$319.50 to Dr. Jeffrey A. Stahl, who assigned the debt to CC for collection. On April 
27, 2000, CC sent the following collection letter to DeSantis:
This notice will serve to inform you that your overdue balance with Dr. Jeffrey A. Stahl has 
been referred to Computer Credit, Inc., a debt collector. [The] doctor insists on payment or 
a valid reason for your failure to make payment. The law prohibits us from collecting any 
amount greater than the obligation stated above. Unless you notify us to the contrary, we 
will assume the amount due is correct. This communication is sent to you in an attempt to 
collect this debt. Any information obtained will be used for that purpose. In the absence of 
a valid reason for your failure to make payment, pay the above debt or contact the doctor 
to settle this matter. Payment can be sent directly to the doctor. [Italics added.]
 
 The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act specifies that the consumer may dispute the 
alleged debt, in which case the debt collector must desist from collection until the debt 
collector obtains verification regarding the amount of the debt, if any. Given that statu-
tory requirement, was the FDCPA violated by the italicized sentences in the collection 
letter? Explain. See DeSantis v. Computer Credit, Inc., 269 F.3d 159 (2d Cir. 2001).
 4. A New York Times editorial argued that college students are taken advantage of by 
credit card companies:
The credit card industry has made a profitable art of corralling consumers into ruinous 
interest rates and hidden penalties that keep even people who pay their bills permanently 
mired in debt. The companies are especially eager to target freshly minted college stu-
dents, who are naïve in money matters and especially vulnerable to credit card offers 
that are too good to be true.49
a. Do you think beginning college students are often “vulnerable” to manipulation by 
credit card companies?
b. Are you vulnerable to that alleged manipulation?

c. Should the federal government provide more protection against credit card decep-
tion? Explain.
 5. Phusion Projects was accused by the Federal Trade Commission of mislabeling its 
flavored malt drink Four Loko. The FTC investigated the company’s implied claims 
that consumers could safely drink one 23.5-ounce can at a sitting and that each can 
contained the alcoholic equivalent of one to two 12-ounce beers and concluded that 
those claims were misleading. The FTC found that a single Four Loko can had as 
much alcohol as four to five beers and that drinking one can on a single occasion 
would amount to binge drinking. Several states banned the drink and Phusion re-
moved the caffeine and other stimulants. In 2013, the FTC ordered Phusion to put on 
the back of Four Loko cans containing more than two servings (a “serving” equals 
0.6 ounces of alcohol) an “Alcohol Facts” panel that discloses alcohol content, serv-
ing size and the number of servings per can. Resealable containers are required for 
Four Loko drinks containing more alcohol than the equivalent of two and one-half 
servings.
a. Many public comments to the FTC called for banning Four Loko from the market. 
Should the FTC do so? Explain.
b. From the FTC point of view, what consumer benefit was achieved by the order?
c. How would you have handled the Four Loko situation? 
 6. Millions of Americans are “underwater” on their home mortgages; that is, they owe 
more than their homes are worth. Many of those families could simply walk away 
from their mortgage, rent a similar home, and save thousands of dollars per year. 
Doubtless many decline to abandon their mortgages because they fear the conse-
quences for their credit records and they want to avoid the cost of changing homes, but 
surely some continue to make payments simply because they believe defaulting would 
be immoral. While serving as U.S. Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson said that anyone 
who walks away from his or her mortgage is “simply a speculator—and one who is not 
honoring his obligation.”50
a. Make the argument that deliberately walking away from an underwater home mort-
gage situation is immoral.
b. Make the argument that walking away is not immoral.
c. What would you do? Explain. See Richard H. Thaler, “Underwater, but Will They 
Leave the Pool?” The New York Times, January 24, 2010 [www.nytimes.com]; and 
Brent T. White, “Buyers Have No Moral Duty to Lenders,” Arizona Republic, April 
25, 2010 [www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/viewpoints/articles/2010/04/25/2

 7. William Cohan, writing in The New York Times, objected to the federal govern-
ment’s consumer protection efforts in the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and 
Consumer  Protection Act, including the creation of the Consumer Financial Pro-
tection Bureau. Explain why Cohan and other critics would object to the 
 government’s efforts to  protect consumers from “devious credit-card companies” 
and “dishonest mortgage lenders.” See William D. Cohan, “The Elizabeth Warren 
 Fallacy,” The New York Times, September 30, 2010 [http://opinionator.blogs

 8. Recent studies suggest that consumer bankruptcies are much more common in some 
states than others. Aside from income levels, what socioeconomic factors would you 
expect to be closely correlated with high bankruptcy rates?
 9. Playtex manufactured the market-leading spill proof cup for children, which a child 
uses by sucking on a spout to cause a valve to open. Gerber introduced its own version 
and ran ads showing an unnamed competitor’s product and claiming that “Gerber’s 
patented valve makes our cup more than 50 percent easier to drink from than the lead-
ing cup.” Gerber’s claims for the superiority of its cup were backed by tests from an 
independent laboratory. Playtex said the unnamed cup obviously was its brand and 
that the superiority claims were false and misleading. Playtex sought an injunction to 
block the Gerber ads. Would you grant that injunction? Explain. See Playtex Products 
v. Gerber Products, 981 F.Supp. 827 (S.D.N.Y. 1997).
 10. Maguire, a credit card holder at Bradlees Department Store, fell behind in her payments. 
She received a series of dunning letters from Citicorp, which managed Bradlees’ accounts, 
demanding that she pay the overdue amount. Later Maguire received a letter from “Debtor 
Assistance,” which said that “your Bradlees account has recently [been] charged off.” 
Debtor Assistance is a unit of Citicorp, but was not identified as such in the letter, beyond 
the phrase “a unit of CRS.” The back of each Bradlees’ account statement includes a notice 
that Citicorp Retail Services was the creditor that handled Bradlees’ accounts. In general, 
creditors are not subject to the requirements of the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act, but 
Maguire sued claiming the Debtor Assistance letter violated the FDCPA. Is she correct? 
Explain. See Maguire v. Citicorp Retail Services, Inc., 147 F.3d 232 (2d Cir. 1998).
 11. A door-to-door salesman representing Your Shop at Home Services, Inc., called on 
Clifton and Cora Jones, who were welfare recipients. The Jones couple decided to buy 
a freezer from the salesman for $900. Credit charges, insurance, and so on were added 
to that $900 base so that the total purchase price was $1,439.69. Mr. and Mrs. Jones 
signed a sales agreement that accurately stipulated the price and its ingredients. The 
Joneses sued to reform the contract on unconscionability grounds. They had paid 
$619.88 toward the total purchase price. At trial, the retail value of the new freezer at 
the time of purchase was set at approximately $300.
a. What is the issue in this case?
b. Decide. Explain. See Jones v. Star Credit Corp., 298 N.Y.S.2d 264 (1969).
12. Roseman resigned from the John Hancock Insurance Company following allegations 
of misuse of his expense account. He reimbursed the account. Subsequently he was 
denied employment by another insurance firm after that firm read a Retail Credit Com-
pany credit report on him. The credit report included accurate information regarding 
Roseman’s resignation. Was Retail Credit in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act 
in circulating information regarding the resignation? Explain. See Roseman v. Retail 
Credit Co., Inc., 428 F.Supp. 643 (Pa. 1977).
13. Once the government decided to intervene in the free market on behalf of consumers, 
two broad product safety options presented themselves: (a) the government could have 
limited its effort to generating and distributing information to consumers, or (b) the 
government could have set safety standards for all products. Assuming the government

was forced to choose one or the other but not elements of both, which option should it 
have chosen? Explain.
14. Consumers sometimes abuse sellers. One familiar technique is shoplifting. Of course, 
shoplifting is a crime. However, the criminal process is cumbersome and often does 
not result in monetary recoveries for sellers. As a result, at least 43 states now have 
laws permitting store owners to impose civil fines, the collection of which is usually 
turned over to a lawyer or collection agency with a threat to sue in civil court, file 
criminal charges, or both if payment is not forthcoming. Fines may range from $50 to 
$5,000 or more, depending on the value of the item stolen.
a. Defense lawyers say this civil fine system is unfair. Why?
b. On balance, is the civil fine approach to shoplifting a good idea? Explain.
c. Cite some other examples of consumers abusing businesspeople.
15. Goswami failed to pay her $900 credit card bill. A collection agency, ACEI, mailed 
her a collection letter with a blue bar across the envelope saying “Priority Letter.” 
The letter did not, in fact, constitute priority mail. The purpose of the bar was to 
encourage Goswami to open the envelope. Was the bar a deceptive practice in 
 violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act? Explain. See Goswami v. 
 American Collections Enterprise, Inc., 377 F.3d 488 (5th Cir. 2004); cert. den. 
2005 U.S. LEXIS 5511.

686  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
Introduction
The preceding chapters have addressed law and ethics primarily in an American context. 
However, ours is undeniably a global economy, as painfully evidenced by the global eco-
nomic recession triggered in 2008 and its continuing repercussions.
 
The process of globalization is the breaking down of national 
boundaries and rules to allow free interchange around the world—
the free interchange of people, communications, services, goods, 
businesses, investments, and ideas. Evidence of the global economy 
is everywhere. Travel the world and you can readily access auto-
mated teller machines (ATMs) for local currency that will be instan-
taneously debited from your domestic bank account. You will see 
such American logos as  Starbucks, McDonalds, and Deloitte adorn-
ing shops and buildings. Back at home, on streets and in malls, you 
can see branches and outlets for HSBC (formerly the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking 
Corporation, now one of the world’s largest banks, headquartered in London), Godiva 
Chocolatier (founded in Brussels), Hyundai cars (Korean), and H&M clothing stores 
(Swedish). As for the interchange of people, in addition to the millions of international 
temporary business and pleasure travelers, there are some 215 million first-generation mi-
grants, 40 percent more than in 1990.1
 
But how is business practice affected by this networked global economy? Which laws 
govern company behavior? The laws of the “home” country? The laws of the “host” coun-
try? The laws where the company’s suppliers or customers reside? What happens if the 
laws of the host country and the home country conflict? And what happens when a corpo-
ration changes its home country? When the German corporation, Daimler Benz, merged 
with Chrysler, becoming Daimler Chrysler, did the laws to which Chrysler was subject 
change? Did those changes have to be unwound when Daimler later sold Chrysler to Cer-
berus Capital Management, an American private equity fund, in 2007? As of this writing, 
the Italian automaker Fiat owns a majority of Chrysler. What law governs the company 
now? As firms become companies of the world, rather than of one nation, difficult issues of 
ethics and law arise.
The International Environment
Ever since Adam Smith wrote The Wealth of Nations in 1776, many have argued that it is 
axiomatic that a decrease in trade barriers between any number of countries will stimulate 
the total world economy, not simply the economies of the countries involved in the  specific 
trade agreement. Belief in this principle is affirmed each time a new nation joins the World 
Trade Organization (WTO). With the addition of six new countries in 2012 and 2013, in-
cluding Russia, 159 countries are members. Afghanistan and Yemen are likely to have 
joined by the time this edition is in print, bringing the total to 161. A fundamental  principle 
set forth in the preamble to the 1994 Marrakesh Agreement, which established the WTO 
 effective January 1, 1995, is that “substantial reduction of tariffs and other  barriers to 
trade” will contribute to the objectives of “raising standards of living, ensuring full 
Globalization is the breaking 
down of national boundaries 
to allow free interchange of 
people, communications, ser-
vices, goods, businesses, in-
vestments, and ideas.

 employment and a large and steadily growing volume of real income.”2 Member countries 
in the WTO represent a diverse array of the world’s governments: from communist to so-
cialist to capitalist, from Buddhist to Jewish to Christian to Muslim, and from all points 
around the globe. Thus, belief in the benefits of decreasing trade  barriers is widely shared 
in the international community. [The WTO maintains an extensive online presence, 
 including full text documents, through its website at www.wto.org]
Trade Agreements
The desire to reach a common legal ground in international business is not a recent devel-
opment. As early as 1778, U.S. commercial treaties have regulated shipping and trading 
rights and rules between U.S. citizens and those of other countries. Such agreements can 
be relatively simple—involving only two countries and only a few commodities—or more 
complex, multilateral agreements involving three or more countries and broad areas of 
their trading relationships, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) 
among Canada, the United States, and Mexico. The more countries involved and the more 
topics on the table, the more complex the agreement. The WTO is the prototypical multi-
lateral agreement. As previously noted, the vast majority of countries are members and 
conceivably any trade-related topic could become a topic for negotiation. In principle, the 
greatest economic stimulation would come from involving the maximum number of state 
actors and addressing the universe of possible trade issues. As a practical matter, that ideal 
may be very difficult to effectuate, as was manifestly illustrated by the WTO negotiations 
which concluded in December 2013.3
 
Those negotiations, known as the Doha Round after the city in Qatar where the round 
was initiated, began in 2001 and collapsed in 2008. Sticking points included the continu-
ation of substantial agricultural subsidies for farmers in the United States and Europe, 
which negatively impact the competitive strength of agricultural products originating in 
other countries, and the relatively high import tariffs on manufactured goods imposed by 
some emerging economies, such as China and India. Another impediment to its conclu-
sion was the dramatic change in the global trading environment over the thirteen years 
the negotiations continued. Not only have major industrialized countries suffered sub-
stantial recessions, but emerging economies began contributing dramatically to the 
global growth in gross domestic product (GDP)—accounting for two-thirds of it in 
2008.4 Both realities have contributed to a shift in the economic balance of power. The 
December 2013 agreement reflects a substantially modified agenda compared to that 
envisioned in 2001 and focuses primarily on the streamlining of international customs 
rules and procedures.
 
In light of the limited recent negotiating successes under the auspices of the WTO, the 
fear is that there will be a return to less comprehensive regional and bilateral negotiations 
in which the imbalance of power between rich and poor nations will be more pronounced. 
Regional trade agreements do seem to be on the rise. As of this writing, the United States 
is negotiating two major regional compacts: one with the European Union (the Transatlan-
tic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP) and the other with 11 countries circling the 
Pacific (the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP). Successful conclusions to either or both 
would certainly lead to a decrease in trade barriers for the participants, but perhaps not for 
nonparticipants. Two points are worthy of note. The first is that the negotiating focus of 

688  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
both the TTIP and the TPP is on reducing nontariff barriers, particularly by promoting 
regulatory convergence through the adoption of common standards on such wide-ranging 
issues as food safety, government procurement rules, restrictions on state-owned enter-
prises, licensing standards, Internet freedom, and the protection of intellectual property, as 
well as labor and environmental standards. The second noteworthy 
point is that none of the major emerging economies—Brazil, Rus-
sia, India, and China (BRIC)—are participants of either of these 
nascent regional compacts. It has been observed that these talks 
“give the U.S. and the EU a chance to shape global rules in a wide 
range of industries” and therefore “pressure … large developing 
countries to adopt any harmonized rules” which result.5
European Union
One of the most well-known, and most developed, trade agreements is that of the European 
Union. It is also quite significant for our purposes because the EU is the United States’ 
largest trading partner, and vice versa. The EU is made up of 28 member countries, with 
five candidate countries: Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia, Turkey, and Iceland. The EU 
population far surpasses the United States’ (508 million compared with 316 million, as of 
this writing) and its combined gross domestic product is roughly equivalent to that of the 
United States’ GDP (both just under $16 trillion). Like the United States, the European 
Union has a robust  domestic regulatory regime that impacts foreign companies seeking to 
do business there. But their regulatory philosophies differ: Europe tends to take a precau-
tionary approach, disallowing new products and technologies until they are proven safe, 
whereas the United States tends to weigh costs and benefits, even while recognizing that 
unknowns exist.6 These differing approaches will challenge both sides’ TTIP negotiators 
and may, in fact, prove insurmountable.
 
Like the WTO, the European Union is currently facing considerable challenges. When 
the financial crisis that began in 2008 spread around the world through the web of global 
financial and economic ties, not only were weak banks revealed, but also weak countries. 
The very success of the EU in increasing trade and other economic ties among its member 
countries became a weakness: The economically weaker countries acted as a further drag 
on the stronger economies. Some of the strongest economic ties in the European Union are 
those that link the 17 countries that have adopted the euro as their common currency. In the 
usual course, as a national economy deteriorates, its currency is devalued in relation to 
other currencies and the economic hardship stays primarily a domestic problem. However, 
within the eurozone, for example, Greece’s currency can’t fall to reflect the degree of its 
economic difficulties because the value of the euro is tied to perceptions of the total group 
of eurozone countries. But when the world sees weakness not just in Greece, but also in 
Spain, Portugal, Ireland, and Italy, even the economically strong eurozone countries suffer 
the downward revaluation of the currency. For those countries the issue becomes, if they 
provide the support to prop up the weaker economies, whether the recipient countries can 
and will make changes domestically to strengthen their economies and prevent future neg-
ative impacts on the euro. If the stronger economies do not have faith in future change, and 
cannot compel such change as a condition of their support, they may determine that the

economies—Brazil, Russia, 
India, and China (BRIC)—
are participants in either the 
TTIP or TPP.

better choice for the long run is to abandon the euro. That step could lead to the disintegra-
tion of the European Union itself.7 [EUROPA is the portal site of the European Union,

Globalization and Countervailing Forces
Recall our definition of globalization: the breaking down of national boundaries to allow 
free interchange of people, communications, services, goods, businesses, investments, 
and ideas. Understanding what globalization is not may be as important as knowing what 
it is: It is not homogenization. The goal is not to make us all the same. But the goals do 
include increased choice through the sharing of diversity, as well as appropriate protec-
tion of historical, social, and cultural identities. It is also not just about free trade. Con-
sider again some of the issues on the table in the TTIP and TPP negotiations, such as 
standards for food safety, of Internet freedom, for labor, and for acceptable environmen-
tal practices. The WTO’s own website acknowledges, “[T]he WTO is not just about 
liberalizing trade, and in some circumstances its rules support maintaining trade 
 barriers—for example, to protect consumers or prevent the spread of disease. … The 
system’s overriding purpose is to help trade flow as freely as possible—so long as there 
are no undesirable side-effects.”8
 
What has also become clear is that the process of globalization 
has not been uniformly beneficial. “The real question isn’t whether 
free markets are good or bad. It is why they are producing such wildly 
different results in different countries.”9 One reason for disparate re-
sults may be whether the local government develops in tandem with the economy and is able 
to and does capture an appropriate portion of the wealth created to put to use on behalf of its 
population. Where that is not occurring, it has been argued that “multinationals—which ac-
count for the bulk of direct cross-border investment and one third of trade—have social re-
sponsibilities in nations where the rule of law is weak. And this view dispenses with the 
erroneous notion that open markets will magically produce prosperity in all conditions.”10 
The global impact of multinationals is a thread that runs throughout this chapter.
Questions
1. Consider the critics from the United States and elsewhere who have expressed concern 
about continued globalization. What do you think they are most concerned about—the 
free interchange of people, businesses, goods, services, investments, communications, 
or ideas? Explain.
2. If multinational corporations have affirmative social responsibilities in “nations 
where the rule of law is weak,” who should select and impose those responsibilities? 
If you believe that it is a matter for corporate management, what forces might cause 
management to act more responsibly? What forces exist that might impede more 
corporate social responsibility on the part of multinationals? On the other hand, if 
you believe that social responsibilities should be imposed on multinationals, what 
body should do so? How will that body obtain the power to legislate and enforce 
such responsibilities?
Globalization has not been 
uniformly beneficial.

The Intercultural Environment: Ethics Across International Borders
The September 11, 2001 World Trade Center attack focused light on ethical and  legal ten-
sions between the American and Islamic cultures. America’s long presence in Iraq and 
Afghanistan kept these cultural divisions in the public eye. The public protests of the Arab 
Spring in 2011, however, may have demonstrated that Islamic cultures are no more homo-
geneous than America’s. Many issues triggering the protests—such as human-rights viola-
tions, unemployment, and extreme poverty—are issues about which the American public 
could be sympathetic. [For more on the Arab Spring, see en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_
Spring] Bridging  cultural differences is an essential first step in creating an effective 
working relationship.
 
Religion often provides the foundation for a culture’s ethical 
structure. Thus, two countries with different religious heritages are 
likely to have divergent ethical and legal norms. For example, 
separation of church and state is a basic legal precept in the United 
States. By contrast, in Islamic countries, religion is the basis for 
many legal, as well as ethical, standards. In reading the following article, consider what 
human rights you believe to be “fundamental.” Keep in mind that cultures differ in their 
judgments about which rights are so important that they should be protected.
media often used the term “Islamic Fundamentalists” when 
referring to the accused in the case. They also referred to the 
Egyptian connections in that case as “Islamic Fundamental-
ists.” The media have used the label of “Islamic Fundamental-
ist” to imply all kinds of possible negative connotations: 
terrorists, kidnappers, and hostage takers. Since the media do 
not use the term “Fundamentalist Christian” each time a Chris-
tian does something wrong, the use of such labels is wrong for 
any group, Christians, Muslims, or Orthodox Jews.
 
A Muslim who is trying to live his religion is indeed a true 
believer in God. This person tries to live all of the tenets of his 
religion in a fundamental way. Thus, a true Muslim is a funda-
mentalist in the practice of that religion, but a true Muslim is 
not radical, because the Quran teaches tolerance and moder-
ation in all things. When the popular media generalize from the 
fundamentalist believer to the “radical fundamentalist” label 
they do a disservice to all Muslims and others.
NO SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE
To understand Islamic Law one must first understand the 
 assumptions of Islam and the basic tenets of the religion. The 
Dennis J. Wiechman, Jerry D. Kendall, and 
Mohammad K. Azarian
In order to protect the five important indispensables in 
Islam (religion, life, intellect, offspring, and property), 
Islamic Law has provided a worldly punishment in addition 
to that in the hereafter. Islam has, in fact, adopted two 
courses for the preservation of these five indispensables: 
the first is through cultivating religious consciousness in 
the human soul and the awakening of human awareness 
through moral education; the second is by inflicting 
deterrent punishment, which is the basis of the Islamic 
criminal system. Therefore “Hudoud,” Retaliation (Qesas), 
and Discretionary (Tazir) punishments have been 
prescribed according to the type of the crime committed.
Islamic Law and Jurisprudence are not always understood by 
the Western press. Although it is the responsibility of the mass 
media to bring to the world’s attention violations of human 
rights and acts of terror, many believe that media stereotyping 
of all Muslims is a major problem. The [1993] bombing at the 
World Trade Center in New York City is a prime example. The

is the basis for many legal, as

meaning of the word Islam is “submission or surrender to 
 Allah’s (God’s) will.” Therefore, Muslims must first and 
 foremost obey and submit to Allah’s will. Mohammed the 
Prophet was called by God to translate verses from the Angel 
Gabriel to form the most important book in Islam, the Quran, 
Muslims  believe.
* * * * *
 
The most difficult part of Islamic Law for most Westerners to 
grasp is that there is no separation of church and state. The reli-
gion of Islam and the government are one. Islamic Law is con-
trolled, ruled, and regulated by the Islamic religion. The 
theocracy controls all public and private matters. Government, 
law, and religion are one. There are varying degrees of this con-
cept in many nations, but all law, government, and civil authority 
rest upon it and it is a part of Islamic religion. There are civil laws 
in Muslim nations for Muslim and non-Muslim people. Sharia [Is-
lamic law] is only applicable to Muslims. . . . The U.S. Constitution 
(Bill of Rights) prohibits the government from “establishing a reli-
gion.” The U.S. Supreme Court has concluded in numerous 
cases that the U.S. Government can’t favor one religion over an-
other. That concept is implicit, for most U.S. legal scholars and 
many U.S. academicians believe that any mixture of “church and 
state” is inherently evil and filled with many problems.
* * * * *
 
Islamic Law is very different from English Common Law or 
the European Civil Law traditions. Muslims are bound to the 
teachings of the Prophet Mohammed whose translation of Al-
lah or God’s will is found in the Quran. Muslims are held ac-
countable to the Sharia Law, but non-Muslims are not bound by 
the same standard (apostasy from Allah). Muslims and non-
Muslims are both required to live by laws enacted by the 
 various forms of government such as tax laws, traffic laws, 
white-collar crimes of business, and theft. These and many 
other crimes similar to Common Law crimes are tried in modern 
“Mazalim Courts.” The Mazalim Courts can also hear civil law, 
family law, and all other cases. Islamic Law does have sepa-
rate courts for Muslims for “religious crimes” and contempo-
rary nonreligious courts for other criminal and civil matters.
Questions
1. Is it important to you that our laws protect “religion, life, 
intellect, offspring, and property”? How do our laws pro-
tect these values? Explain.
2. Do any of our laws “rest upon” religious principles found in 
Judaism or Christianity? Explain.
3. Another law over which countries have profound differ-
ences of opinion is capital punishment. At the time of this 
writing, a 56-year-old British woman was facing death by 
firing squad for smuggling about 10 pounds of cocaine into 
Bali. Nearly 100 countries have abolished capital punish-
ment. According to Amnesty International, 682 confirmed 
executions were carried out worldwide in 2012 (excluding 
thousands in China, however, because accurate informa-
tion is unavailable). The five countries with the highest 
numbers are China, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the United 
States. Develop brief arguments both for and against capi-
tal punishment. Source: “Not Dead Yet,” The Economist,

Laws and Social Norms Regarding Free Speech
Standards for appropriate speech are regulated both by societal norms and, in many cases, 
by local law. The bounds of free speech vary considerably from country to country. The 
Internet magnifies the issue because its inherent nature allows speech to flow freely di-
vorced from political boundaries. Although Chapter 18 will cover the Internet and free 
speech under U.S. law, here we look at the issue from an international perspective, not 
with regard to the speaker, but rather to the service provider that facilitates transmission of 
the contested speech.
 
Because service providers such as Google, Facebook, and Twitter store the speech of 
others on their servers, one issue is whether such a provider can, should, or must remove 
content that is offensive to portions of its audience, particularly after the provider has been 
notified of the specific content found objectionable. For example, in 2011 Google received 
more than 1,900 requests from governments for the removal of various content, many of 

692  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
which were honored by blocking access from those countries under Google’s policy of 
complying with lawful requests. Which country’s requests topped the list? Brazil with 418; 
the United States was second with 279. This is not as surprising as it might seem when one 
factors in that countries where less free speech is tolerated block content more directly. 
China’s “Great Firewall” is a case in point. What speech draws a red flag in Brazil? Racial 
issues, but also some political speech. Brazil “has strict electoral laws that limit criticism 
of candidates in the runup to elections.”11 In Spring 2013, Facebook angered a considera-
ble number of its U.S. constituents with regard to content that glorified violence against 
women. Groups concerned with women’s rights have repeatedly reported offensive con-
tent, with mixed satisfaction. Frustrated, they used one medium to get the attention of an-
other: They “asked Facebook users to use [a particular] Twitter hashtag . . . to call on 
companies to stop advertising on Facebook if their ads [had] been placed alongside” pages 
with names such as “Violently Raping Your Friend Just for Laughs.” In a very short time 
the effort had garnered 224,000 supporters on a petition at change.org and Facebook publi-
cally stated that its “systems to identify and remove hate speech have failed to work as ef-
fectively as we would like, particularly around issues of gender-based hate.”12
 
Perhaps even more challenging are requests from governments for service providers to 
turn over information revealing the identity of the content poster. France has antihate laws 
that proscribe anti-Semitic speech. Twitter had already removed at least some of the con-
tent at issue when a French court in a civil suit brought by a citizen’s group ordered Twitter 
to identify the individuals who had posted the content. Although its policy is to provide 
such information only in response to a valid order of a U.S. court, ultimately Twitter 
agreed to provide the information to French authorities that were seeking to prosecute the 
posters under their antihate laws. In deciding to cooperate, Twitter may have been con-
cerned that the employees of its Paris offices would be subject to prosecution.13
Question
Acceptable speech varies not just by country but also over time. Today’s Internet content 
issues can be seen as a modern version of TV broadcast censorship. In the early years of 
TV, bedrooms of spouses could be shown only if they contained two beds. TV censorship 
varied somewhat by the time of day of the broadcast, but language and dress had some 
restrictions applicable at all times. As discussed in this section, sensitive topics can also be 
based on local history and conditions. Additional examples include Thailand’s prohibi-
tions against insults to its monarchy and India’s fears about content that could spark reli-
gious violence. Hate speech is widely restricted. Try developing a substantive rule that an 
Internet provider could use to determine when a request to remove content should be acted 
upon, regardless of the country of origin. If your rule references hate speech, it will be 
important to indicate what speech meets the criteria.
Social Responsibility to Host Country
When doing business abroad, does a firm have social responsibilities to the host country 
 beyond those required by the market and the law of that country? This issue has arisen in 
many contexts, including factory labor conditions. Not infrequently, corporations have been 
chastised for allowing working conditions in their foreign operations or in their suppliers’ 
plants that Western cultures consider substandard. Such sweatshops pose a host of  commercial, 

Chapter Sixteen  International Ethics and Law  693
economic, ethical, political, and social questions. For example, on April 24, 2013, 1,129 peo-
ple died when a multistory building collapsed in a suburb of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. 
Only a day earlier, cracks had been discovered in the building, which housed retailers on the 
lower floors and a number of clothing factories on the top floors. In response to the discovery, 
the retailers immediately closed, but the owners of the factories on the higher floors insisted 
their workers continue to produce the clothing that was destined for European and American 
consumers. As evidenced by the over 5,000 garment factories employing more than 3.2 mil-
lion workers, low labor costs have attracted nearly every major clothing company to Bangla-
desh, where unsafe factory facilities have long been a problem. Only five months earlier, a fire 
in a similar factory killed 112 workers after which importers, including Walmart, pledged to 
do more to ensure worker safety, but little was achieved. The call for Western buyers to take 
effective action came loudly and immediately following the loss of life in April 2013. Despite 
the renewed outcry, real reform does not appear to be on the near horizon.14
 
Traditionally, free-market economists have believed that sweatshops are necessary 
and beneficial. Sweatshops allow the economies of developing countries to improve be-
cause their export sectors expand and consumers in global markets are better off because 
they pay less for the products they buy. This faith in the market is based on the concept 
of comparative advantage: that developing countries typically have a comparative com-
petitive advantage in cheap labor while developed countries have comparative advan-
tages in such things as an educated workforce, manufacturing infrastructure and 
expertise, certain  particularly well-developed industries, and so on. These economists 
argue that sweatshops have been an element of every developed country’s transforma-
tion from an agrarian  society to an urban-based, highly industrialized economy. If poor 
countries want to  develop, a sweatshop stage is necessary, they say. The expected pro-
gression holds that, as exports from a developing country rise, its local economy grows, 
generating funds that can be used in part to increase the overall standard of living and to 
invest in education and infrastructure, which, in turn, will allow the country to compete 
on other bases. 
 
Other economists disagree that all developing countries must necessarily endure a 
sweatshop phase. A pure free market, or hands-off economy, does not exist either in indus-
trialized countries or in the developing world. Governments often play a role in creating 
comparative advantages. For example, in Bangladesh the government has set the minimum 
wage at $37 per month; it prohibits many workers from organizing labor unions and work-
ers in industries which may be unionized face rules that make success challenging; it has 
set building standards, but does not effectively enforce them. In addition, the increase in 
national wealth referenced by free-market economists, often created by poor laborers, may 
for a considerable time find its way primarily into the hands of industry heads and govern-
ment employees.15

Social Responsibility to Home Country?
We have noted a potential responsibility to a host country, but does a firm have any special 
obligation to its home country? Social responsibility to a home country might necessitate 
operating in accord with the values of one’s home country even when doing business 
abroad. Microsoft and other U.S. companies, for example, have had difficulties with 
 software piracy in foreign countries. Russia, supported by Microsoft lawyers, has taken 
some action to crackdown on such piracy. However, Russian human rights and environ-
mental organizations have alleged that the government selectively investigates the use of 
illegal software in order to muzzle opposition voices while government allies are rarely if 
ever investigated. In late 2010, Microsoft initiated a new policy of providing blanket 
 software licenses to advocacy groups in Russia so as to limit the government’s ability to 
use software piracy as a pretext for government censorship or harassment.16
 
The United States exports its values structure in a variety of ways, including through the 
extraterritorial application of its laws. When the U.S. Supreme Court declared that antidis-
crimination provisions of U.S. statutes such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did 
not apply extraterritorially,17 Congress reversed the decision with its 1991 Amendments to 
Title VII. Extraterritorial application is considered essential because over five million 
Americans work abroad. Accordingly, American firms that do not maintain certain Title 
VII standards abroad may be subject to liability in the United States. For instance, if a firm 
conducts operations in Saudi Arabia, where the circumstances under which women are al-
lowed to work are considerably circumscribed, that firm is still held to Title VII’s prohibi-
tion against gender discrimination. Compliance with American civil rights laws is not 
required, however, where doing so would violate the host country’s laws.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA)
Consider the problem of bribery and other forms of corruption. Some nations argue that 
bribery is acceptable behavior, whereas others criticize it severely. In July 2013, the Chi-
nese minister who had overseen a substantial modernization of China’s railways was sen-
tenced to death (although reduction to a life sentence was possible) for accepting 
$10.5 million in bribes.18 How would you define bribery? What problems are created by a 
culture of bribery?
 
For years, U.S. firms have dealt with  bribery issues in America and abroad. Congress 
has attempted to respond harshly to corruption in other governments and to support U.S. 
firms that do not participate in foreign corruption. As we saw in Chapter 2, the FCPA pro-
hibits businesses from making certain payments or gifts to government officials for the 
purpose of influencing business decisions. In recent years the United States has stepped up 
its enforcement of the FCPA, both through criminal suits brought by the Department of 
Justice and through civil cases brought by the Securities Exchange Commission.19 Recent 
FCPA investigations have involved the following companies:
• GlaxoSmithKline: Both the United States and China are investigating bribes of nearly 
$500 million alleged to have been paid by the British company through Chinese travel 
agencies to doctors and hospital personnel for boosting their prescriptions of GSK phar-
maceuticals, as well as to government officials and Chinese GSK executives. Allegedly, 
one travel agency “was handling about $16 million worth of Glaxo business a year. . . . 

Chapter Sixteen  International Ethics and Law  695
How the small agency [which also had other foreign drug companies as clients] secured 
business with many of the world’s biggest drug makers remains a mystery.”20
• Hollywood movie studios: In spring 2012, the SEC began an investigation of five com-
panies, including 20th Century Fox, DreamWorks Animation, and Disney, into whether 
studios were gaining access to Chinese movie theaters for their films by paying bribes 
to Chinese officials.21
• Microsoft: Also under investigation are allegations by tipsters of kickbacks paid by 
Microsoft to foreign officials, resellers, and consultants for the purpose of securing 
contracts in five countries—China, Italy, Pakistan, Romania, and Russia.22
• Walmart: The government has been investigating Walmart with regard to alleged brib-
ery, particularly in Mexico, to obtain approvals for a widescale expansion of its store 
sites, as well as an internal attempt to cover it up. A substantial report on its actions in 
Mexico was published by The New York Times in 2012; many executives holding criti-
cal positions, including the chief administrative officer in the U.S. and the general coun-
sel of its Mexican division, have since left the company. 23
 
Although well intentioned, some critics argue that the FCPA unduly restricts  American 
companies operating abroad and prevents them from competing effectively. However, the 
biggest settlements under the FCPA have actually been paid by foreign companies, a con-
sequence of the Act’s application to any company that has securities listed on a U.S. stock 
exchange or does business in the United States.24 Others argue the United States should not 
use foreign trade to unilaterally impose its sense of morality around the globe. Many other 
countries, however, are enforcing similar antibribery measures. [For more information on

Question
Is it ethical for the U.S. Congress to impose federal laws on the operations of U.S. corpora-
tions abroad? Why or why not?
Social Responsibility to Humanity?
Are we evolving toward a set of common international ethical standards that can be sup-
ported and implemented globally? Would international ethical standards simply represent 
a natural progression from national standards? At one time, agreements were achieved 
only at a city level, but state-level agreements followed, and those, in turn, evolved to 
agreements among federated states. Is a similar progression to global standards inevitable? 
Does a framework that divides ethical issues between those of the “host” country and those 
of the “home” country remain a useful analytical tool?
 
If we are moving toward global social responsibility, can we do 
so without sacrificing the existence of wonderfully diverse and 
unique cultures? Do we have to become ever more uniform in our 
beliefs and practices? Can we agree on fundamentals, but still 
 appreciate diversity?
 
Consider the evidence. Not only are businesses interacting with 
stakeholders of ever more diverse nationalities (investors/owners/

 impacted by business decisions), but the cultural identity of businesses themselves may be 
unclear. Consider the example of Chrysler’s changing ownership in the chapter 
 introduction.
 
We have growing evidence of voluntary international cooperation to establish accepta-
ble business practices, such as the establishment of October 14 as World Standards Day to 
honor the work of many nongovernmental international bodies that have established a 
wide range of voluntary standards addressing global production and trade. Other evidence 
includes:
• As far back as 1948, the U.N. General Assembly adopted its Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights. Inherent in the structure of the declaration is a recognition of the 
 connection between work (and business, by extension) and the protection of fundamen-
tal human values. Article 23 declares that everyone has a right “to just and favourable 
conditions of work” and “to just and favourable remuneration ensuring for himself and 
his family an existence worthy of human dignity.”25
• In 2000, the United Nations launched a voluntary initiative to promote corporate social 
responsibility globally. The 10 principles of the Global Compact address  human rights, 
labor standards, the environment, and corruption. Over 7,000 businesses from 145 coun-
tries have joined the Compact. [For more on the Global Compact, see www

• Social Accountability International has developed SA8000, a social accountability 
standard based on international norms (such as the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights previously mentioned) that companies can adopt to develop and assure an equi-

Consider the following excerpt from a speech delivered 
September 28, 2001, by Jose Ramos-Horta, Nobel Peace 
Prize Laureate (1996) and Minister for Foreign Affairs and 
Cooperation for the East Timor Transition Government:
There is no dispute that abject poverty, child labor, and 
prostitution are a moral indictment of all humanity.
 
However, poverty should not only touch our 
conscience: It is also a matter of peace and security 
because it destabilizes entire countries and regions. In 
turn it threatens the integration of the global economy 
that is vital if the rich are to stay rich or if the poor are to 
move up, if only an inch.
 
Peace will be illusory as long as the rich ignore the 
clamor of the poor for a better life, as long as hundreds 
of millions of people live below the poverty line, cannot 
afford a meal a day, do not have access to clean water 
and a roof.26
Questions
Should most of us, not just active international businesses, 
accept a social responsibility to humanity? If we answer 
yes to this question, how might our actions as students, 
educators, employees, employers, and investors change?

Chapter Sixteen  International Ethics and Law  697
Laws Governing Cross-Border Business
All businesses must, of course, follow the laws of the countries in which they are  physically 
present and operating. (Whether a business with no physical presence but which solicits or 
performs business in a foreign country electronically must follow the laws of the foreign 
country will be examined in Chapter 18.) Foreign firms often wish to establish operations 
in the United States, in part because Americans are more inclined to buy goods made in 
this country. Doing business in the United States brings with it the requirement to comply 
with U.S. laws and regulations.
 
Conversely, when U.S. businesses operate abroad, they are required to follow the law of 
the host country. In 2006 when Google began operating its search engine in China it 
 accepted the government’s requirement that it filter results to remove material the govern-
ment deemed unsuitable for its citizens. In March 2010, Google ceased that practice and 
automatically redirected search requests coming from China to its uncensored site in Hong 
Kong. China then threatened Google with the loss of its license (to provide other online 
services such as its music, mapping, and translation). The license was renewed when 
Google proposed to stop automatically redirecting search requests and instead simply pre-
sent would-be searchers with a clickable link to google.com.hk.27
 
Businesses may also be required, even in their foreign operations, to continue to follow 
certain laws of their home country, as previously discussed. Interestingly, although there is 
a presumption against the extraterritorial application of U.S. criminal law, where Congress 
has clearly indicated an intent to cover actions outside of the United States, U.S. citizens 
can be held accountable in America for their criminal actions abroad.28
 
Finally, businesses operating across national borders will also be subject to  international 
law. The foundation and some examples of international business law will be discussed 
soon, but first it will be useful to explore some of the different forms of business available 
to companies wishing to expand their operations into foreign countries.
Forms of Global Business Expansion
Multinational Enterprise (MNE)
The term multinational enterprise traditionally refers to a company that conducts business 
in more than one country. Any of the following operations, except for a direct contract 
with a foreign purchaser, may qualify a company as an MNE.
Direct Contract
A firm may expand its business across territorial borders using a variety of methods. The 
simplest, from a contractual perspective, occurs where a firm in one country enters an 
agreement with a person in another country. For example, a firm may contract to sell its 
product to a purchaser in another country. This is called a direct sale to a foreign pur-
chaser. The parties simply agree on the terms of the sale and record them in a contract.
 
Where the contract is silent as to a term of the sale, the law that will apply to the missing 
term will be the law specified in the contract; where none is specified, the applicable law will 
depend on the country in which the court is located. Some courts will employ the vesting of 
rights doctrine, applying the law of the jurisdiction in which the rights in the contract vested. 
Other courts may apply the most significant relationship doctrine, applying the law of the 

698  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
jurisdiction that has the most significant relationship to the contract and the parties. Finally, 
some courts will apply the governmental interest doctrine, applying the law of the jurisdic-
tion that has the greatest interest in the issue’s outcome.
 
Payment is one of the most complicated issues pertaining to direct sales. The seller 
should and usually does require an irrevocable letter of credit, which the buyer obtains 
from a bank after paying that amount to the bank (or securing that 
amount of credit). The bank then promises to pay the seller the con-
tract amount  after conforming goods have been shipped. The 
“ irrevocable” component prohibits the bank from revoking the letter 
of credit without the consent of both the buyer and the seller. The 
seller is  protected because the buyer has already provided adequate 
funds for the purchase, confirmed by a bank. The buyer is protected because the funds are 
not turned over to the seller until it has been determined that the goods conform to the 
contract. It is important to the buyer, however, that the letter of credit be specific as to the 
conformance of the goods because the bank will only ensure that the goods conform to the 
letter of credit and not to the contract itself.
Foreign Representation A second type of foreign expansion is a sale through a distributor, 
agent, or other type of representative in the foreign country. A firm may decide to sell through 
an agent—that is, the firm hires an individual who will remain permanently in the foreign 
country, negotiate contracts, and assist in the performance of the contracts. Agents are gener-
ally compensated on a commission basis. On the other hand, the firm may act through a 
representative, who may solicit and take orders but, unlike an agent, may not enter into con-
tracts on behalf of the firm. In some countries laws may substantially restrict the actions a 
representative may take. For example, in China a representative may generally only gather 
information and market research, but no direct business activities may be undertaken.29
 
Distributors purchase goods from the seller, then negotiate sales to foreign buyers on 
their own behalf. In so doing, a distributor may be more likely to invest resources to de-
velop the foreign market for the goods. Exclusive dealing agreements with distributors, 
where a distributor agrees to sell only the goods of one manufacturer and the manufacturer 
agrees to sell only to that distributor in a particular geographic area, are generally not al-
lowed abroad,  although they often are legal in the United States.
 
Export trading companies specialize in acting as the intermediary between a domestic 
business and foreign purchasers. The trading company will take title to the goods being 
sold and then complete the sale in the foreign country. Export management companies, on 
the other hand, merely manage the sale but do not take title to the goods; consequently, 
they do not share any of the risk associated with the sale.
Joint Venture Foreign expansion may also occur through a joint venture agreement 
 between two or more parties. This type of agreement usually covers one or several specific 
projects and is in effect for a specified period. For instance, Toyota and General Motors 
operated a joint venture at a plant in Fremont, California, from 1984 to 2009. Toyota 
 currently has a joint venture with Subaru in Lafayette, Indiana.
Branch Office or Subsidiary A branch office is simply an extension of a foreign corpo-
ration into the host country. A subsidiary, however, is a legally separate entity formed 
Payment is one of the most 
complicated issues pertaining 
to direct sales.

Chapter Sixteen  International Ethics and Law  699
under the laws of the host country and substantially owned by the foreign parent company. 
For example, an Indian paper company may open a branch office in London to market and 
sell its products. That office would be a mere extension of the offices already established 
in India. On the other hand, the Indian firm could create a British subsidiary to handle its 
British business from its London offices. Either a subsidiary or branch office relationship 
could also be established through acquisition of an existing firm in the host country.
 
The distinction between a subsidiary, which is a legal entity separate from its foreign par-
ent, and a branch office, which is not, has a number of ramifications. For example, many 
countries may require a local subsidiary to have in-country directors and/or shareholders. On 
the other hand, setting up a branch office will likely  subject the parent company to taxation 
in the host country. Indeed, the parent company is legally liable for all obligations of a branch 
office. In contrast, when a subsidiary is sued, the parent company is not generally liable. For 
example, in U.S. v. Philip Morris, Inc.,30 the U.S. district court dismissed British American 
Tobacco (BAT) from the federal government’s suit against various cigarette manufacturers 
for recovery of health care expenses. BAT was the British parent of the U.S. company, 
Brown & Williamson. The subsidiary, B&W, remained a part of the suit.
Licensing Where a company has no interest in commencing operations in a foreign 
country but instead merely wants to have its product or name in that market, the company 
may decide to license the rights to the name or to manufacture the product to a company in 
the target market. The benefit to this type of relationship is that the licensor (holder of the 
right) has the opportunity to enter the foreign market, but the licensee assumes all of the 
obligations and risks of running the business.
Franchising In a franchise agreement the franchisee pays the franchisor for a license to 
use trademarks, formulas, and other trade secrets. The difference between a franchising 
agreement and a licensing contract is that a franchise agreement is usually made up of a 
number of licensing arrangements, as well as other obligations. For instance, in a typical 
fast-food franchise agreement the franchisor will license to the franchisee the right to use 
its trademark, name, logo, recipes, menus, and other recognized resources. Ben & Jerry’s 
offers franchise opportunities in Europe, Asia, Australia, Canada, and Mexico.
Question
Assume that you are interested in importing silk blouses from Bangkok, Thailand, to 
France. What facts might persuade you to enter into an agency agreement with a Thai 
blouse manufacturer rather than a distributorship or vice versa?
Foundations of International Law
A firm with manufacturing plants in Argentina and Thailand, and 
corporate headquarters in Bangkok, enters into a contract with a 
French firm to distribute its products produced in the Argentinean 
plant. The French firm is not satisfied with the quality of the prod-
ucts  being sent. What law would apply to this situation? 
What law would apply to this 
situation? Argentinean? 
Thai? French?

700  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
 Argentinean? Thai? French? Or are there, perhaps, specific provisions of international law 
that will govern? The answer to this question is not  simple, even for seasoned lawyers; yet 
the firms involved will be greatly affected by the result.
 
The source of law applicable to an international dispute depends in part on the issue 
involved. In general, private parties are free to form agreements in whatever manner they 
wish. The parties to the agreement can determine, for instance, which nation’s law will 
govern the contract, where disagreements in connection with the contract will be settled, 
and even in which language the transactions will be made. This is referred to as the private 
law of contracts. Whenever the parties to a transaction from different jurisdictions are in-
volved in a lawsuit, the court will start by looking at the agreement of the parties them-
selves to resolve these issues. Where the contract is silent as to the choice of law, 
 jurisdiction, and other questions, the court must decide. Generally, the law of the jurisdic-
tion in which the transaction occurred is applied. If the transaction is consummated through 
some form of cross-border communication, as are many international trade negotiations, 
most often the law of the jurisdiction of the seller’s place of business will apply. Remem-
ber, however, that the parties may always contract for a different result.
 
Public law, on the other hand, includes those rules of each nation that regulate the contrac-
tual agreement between the parties—for instance, import and export taxes, packaging require-
ments, and safety standards. In addition, public law regulates the relationships among nations.
 
Public law derives from a number of sources. The most familiar source of international 
public law is a treaty or convention (essentially a contract between nations). For example, 
the United States, Canada, and Mexico have entered into the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA), a convention regarding trade among those countries. Some treaties 
and conventions are self-executing, which means that once a country has ratified them, a 
business can rely on and directly enforce treaty terms in court. The United Nations Con-
vention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG), which will be  discussed 
soon, is an example of a self-executing convention. On the other hand, some treaties and 
conventions apply only to government signatories and not directly to private parties. Such 
a convention may, for example, require an adopting country such as the United States to 
amend its domestic law to accomplish the purposes of the convention.
 
Public law is also found in international custom or generally accepted principles of law. 
These terms refer to practices that are commonly accepted as appropriate business or com-
mercial practices among nations. For instance, sovereign immunity, discussed later in this 
chapter, is an accepted principle of international law. A custom is derived from consistent 
behavior over time that is accepted as binding by the countries that engage in that behavior.
Piracy on the High Seas
In recent years events off the coast of Somalia have raised public awareness of modern-day 
piracy. One might think that the international law against piracy would be clear given that 
piracy has existed as a threat to security since well before Britain’s Royal Navy returned to 
port in 1718 with the severed head of Blackbeard. A 2010 federal case in Virginia, as well 
as attempts to prosecute raiders in other countries, suggested otherwise. What is clear is 
that generally accepted principles of international law give any country the right to capture 
pirates on the high seas. U.S. law merely states that “whoever on the high seas, commits 
the crime of piracy as defined by the law of nations . . . shall be imprisoned for life.”

Chapter Sixteen  International Ethics and Law  701
 
The Virginia court had before it several Somali men who by skiff had approached a 
U.S. amphibious dock landing ship in the Gulf of Aden in the early morning hours of 
July 7, 2010. One man shot an AK-47 rifle at the USS Ashland, which returned fire, sank 
the skiff, and then took the assailants into custody. The U.S. government argued that piracy 
under the law of nations does not require the active  taking of property and that any unau-
thorized armed assault or direct violent act on the high seas is enough. The defense argued 
the charge could not stand because the defendants “did not board, take control, or other-
wise rob the USS Ashland.” Relying on an 1820 U.S. Supreme Court decision defining 
piracy as robbery on the high seas and holding that contemporary international law is un-
settled on the definition of piracy, the court dismissed the piracy charge.
 
The case was appealed, as was a later federal district court opinion that upheld piracy 
charges against five other men who attacked another U.S. vessel off the coast of Somalia. 
Those defendants were sentenced to life in prison plus 80 years for piracy. The Fourth 
Circuit affirmed the latter sentences, vacated the USS Ashland decision, and held that the 
1820 decision did not foreclose conduct other than robbery, including acts of violence 
committed for private ends against persons on the high seas, from qualifying as piracy.31
The Development of Customs
Historically, merchants followed certain accepted customs or principles in connection with the 
sale of goods. These customs or manners of dealing between merchants were often recognized 
and applied in court decisions and later in the United States became codified in the Uniform 
Commercial Code (UCC) Article 2 that regulates the sale of goods generally as well as sales 
between merchants. In this way, customs or practices traditionally followed by merchants 
have become accepted principles of law throughout the United States (except Louisiana).
 
In the international legal arena customary practices are still evolving. For instance, the 
practice had been that personal information moved freely between countries to encourage 
efficient information exchange in the business world. However, the European Union in 
1998 established minimum standards for the protection of personal data. Any country 
 receiving information from an EU country must comply with those standards. (See Chap-
ter 18 for more on the European Union’s Directive on Data Protection.)
 
Two factors are used to determine whether an international custom exists: (1) consist-
ency and repetition of the action or decision and (2) recognition by nations that this custom 
is binding. The first merely holds that the action or decision must be accepted by a number 
of nations for a time long enough to establish uniformity of application. The second dic-
tates that the custom be accepted as binding by nations observing it. If the custom is ac-
cepted as merely persuasive, it does not rise to the level of a generally accepted principle 
of law. Through persistent objections, any nation may ensure that such custom is not ap-
plied to cases in which it is involved.
 
Generally, once a contract has been created it is enforceable according to its terms by all 
parties to the contract. In the following case, read carefully to see what law the judge ap-
plied. He considered first the private law of the parties (that is, the express terms of the 
contract); then he looked to custom; and finally he applied the concept of commercial 
 impracticability.

Transatlantic Financing 
Corporation v. United States
363 F.2d 312 (D.C. Cir. 1966)
 
If anything, the circumstances surrounding this contract indi-
cate that the risk of the Canal’s closure may be deemed to have 
been allocated to Transatlantic. We know or may safely assume 
that the parties were aware, as were most commercial men with 
interest affected by the Suez situation, that the Canal might be-
come a dangerous area. No doubt the tension affected freight 
rates, and it is arguable that the risk of closure became part of 
the dickered terms. We do not deem the risk of closure so allo-
cated, however. Foreseeability or even recognition of a risk does 
not necessarily prove its allocation. Parties to a contract are not 
always able to provide for all the possibilities of which they are 
aware, sometimes because they cannot agree, often simply be-
cause they are too busy. Moreover, that some abnormal risk was 
contemplated is probative but does not necessarily establish an 
allocation of the risk of the contingency which actually occurs. In 
this case, for example, nationalization by Egypt of the Canal Cor-
poration and formation of the Suez Users Group did not neces-
sarily indicate that the Canal would be blocked even if a 
confrontation resulted. The surrounding circumstances do indi-
cate, however, a willingness by Transatlantic to assume abnor-
mal risks, and this fact should legitimately cause us to judge the 
impracticability of performance by an alternative route in stricter 
terms than we would were the contingency unforeseen.
 
We turn then to the question whether occurrence of the con-
tingency rendered performance commercially impracticable 
under the circumstances of this case. The goods shipped were 
not subject to harm from the longer, less temperate Southern 
route. The vessel and crew were fit to proceed around the Cape. 
Transatlantic was no less able than the United States to pur-
chase insurance to cover the contingency’s occurrence. If any-
thing, it is more reasonable to expect owner–operators of 
vessels to insure against the hazards of war. They are in the best 
position to calculate the cost of performance by alternative 
routes (and therefore to estimate the amount of insurance re-
quired), and are undoubtedly sensitive to international troubles 
that uniquely affect the demand for and cost of their services. 
The only factor operating here in appellant’s favor is the added 
expense, allegedly $43,972.00 above and beyond the contract 
price of $305,842.92, of extending a 10,000-mile voyage by ap-
proximately 3,000 miles. While it may be an overstatement to say 
that increased cost and difficulty of performance never consti-
tute impracticability, to justify relief there must be more of a vari-
ation between  expected cost and the cost of performing by an 
available  alternative than is present in this case, where the 
promisor can legitimately be presumed to have accepted some 
degree of abnormal risk, and where impracticability is urged on 
Judge J. Skelly Wright
[In 1956, Transatlantic Financing, a steamship operator, con-
tracted with the United States to ship wheat from Texas to 
Iran. Six days after the ship left port for Iran, the Egyptian gov-
ernment was at war with Israel and blocked the Suez Canal to 
shipping. The steamer therefore was forced to sail around the 
Cape of Good Hope. Transatlantic accordingly sued the United 
States for its added expenses as a result of this change of cir-
cumstances. Transatlantic contended that it had contracted 
only to travel the “usual and customary” route to Iran and that 
the United States had received a greater benefit than that for 
which it contracted. The district court held for the United 
States; Transatlantic appealed.]
 
Transatlantic’s claim is based on the following train of ar-
gument. The charter was a contract for a voyage from a Gulf 
port to Iran. Admiralty principles and practices, especially 
stemming from the doctrine of deviation, require us to [infer] 
into the contract the term that the voyage was to be performed 
by the “usual and customary” route. The usual and customary 
route from Texas to Iran was, at the time of contract, via Suez, 
so the contract was for a voyage from Texas to Iran via Suez. 
When Suez was closed this contract became impossible to 
perform. Consequently, appellant’s argument continues, when 
Transatlantic delivered the cargo by going around the Cape of 
Good Hope, in compliance with the Government’s demand un-
der claim of right, it conferred a benefit upon the United States 
for which it should be paid on quantum meruit.
 
The contract in this case does not expressly condition per-
formance upon availability of the Suez route. Nor does it spec-
ify “via Suez” or, on the other hand, “via Suez or Cape of Good 
Hope.” Nor are there provisions in the contract from which we 
may properly [infer] that the continued availability of Suez was 
a condition of performance. Nor is there anything in custom or 
trade usage, or in the surrounding circumstances generally, 
which would support our constructing a condition of perfor-
mance. The numerous cases requiring performance around the 
Cape when Suez was closed indicate that the Cape route is 
generally regarded as an alternative means of performance. So 
the implied expectation that the route would be via Suez is 
hardly adequate proof of an allocation to the promisee of the 
risk of closure. In some cases, even an express expectation 
may not amount to a condition of performance. The doctrine of 
deviation supports our assumption that parties normally expect 
performance by the usual and customary route, but it adds 
nothing beyond this that is probative of an allocation of the risk.

Chapter Sixteen  International Ethics and Law  703
Comity
The unique aspect of public international law is that countries are generally not subject to 
law in the international arena unless they consent to such jurisdiction. For instance, a country 
is not bound by a treaty unless that country has signed the treaty. A country is not bound 
by international custom unless it has traditionally participated in that custom. Prior judicial 
decisions are only persuasive if a country is convinced by and accepts these decisions as 
precedent. Perhaps the most critical element in understanding international law is recog-
nizing that it is not “law” in the way we generally think of that term. Countries are not 
bound to abide by it except through comity. Comity is the concept that countries should 
abide by international custom, treaties, and other sources of international direction because 
that is the civil way to engage in relationships. Nations must respect one another and respect 
some basic principles of dealing in order to have effective relationships. Although some 
believe that the origins of law are in religion and its commandments, others argue that law 
derives from a natural tendency to prevent chaos. International law is an attempt to prevent 
chaos in the international arena through the application of universal or widely held principles. 
Comity is the means by which those principles are encouraged.
 
The concept of comity also includes the respect one country gives to the actions another 
country takes in its own territory. Specifically, as stated by the Second Circuit in Finanz 
AG Zurich v. Banco Economico S.A.,32 comity includes “the recognition which one nation 
allows within its territory to the legislative, executive, or judicial acts of another nation.” 
Under this principle U.S. courts “ordinarily refuse to review acts of foreign governments 
and defer to proceedings taking place in foreign countries.” Thus, the Finanz court held 
that a creditor could not sue in the United States to collect a debt that was subject to the 
jurisdiction of a bankruptcy proceeding in Brazil.
Regulation of International Trade
As we have just seen, there is no such thing as one body of international law per se that 
regulates international contracts and trade. Instead, a contract between firms in different 
countries may be subject to the laws of one country or the other, depending on (1) whether 
it is a sales contract subject to the U.N. CISG, discussed below, (2) whether the contract

704  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
itself stipulates the applicable law and forum in which a dispute will be heard, and (3) the 
rules regarding conflict of laws in each jurisdiction.
 
In addition, every country has domestic laws that regulate business conducted within its 
borders and that sometimes regulate its domestic firms outside of its borders. These laws 
govern the areas of employment-related activities and discrimination, product liability, 
intellectual property, antitrust and trade practices, and import taxes, to name a few. Conse-
quently, a business owner may actually decide to market a good in one country over 
 another simply because of that country’s laws relating to the particular good or to com-
mercial contracts in general. What follows is a brief look at several specific examples of 
the law governing international business. [For an extensive international trade law data-
base, see www.jus.uio.no/lm]
U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG)
In 1988, 10 nations signed and became bound by the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the 
International Sale of Goods. At this writing the CISG is enforceable in 77 nations. The 
CISG applies to contracts between parties of countries that have signed the convention and 
provides uniform rules for the sale of goods.
 
The CISG contains rules regarding the interpretation of contracts and negotiations and 
the form of contracts. Many obligations of the parties are enunciated by the CISG. For in-
stance, the seller is required to deliver the goods and any documents relating to the goods, 
as well as to make sure that the goods conform to the contract terms. The buyer, on the 
other hand, is required to pay the contract price and to accept delivery of the goods. [For 
the Pace University CISG database, see cisgw3.law.pace.edu]
 
The Convention, however, does not answer all questions that may arise in a transaction. 
For instance, questions of a contract’s validity are left to national law. As we saw in Chap-
ter 6,  under American law, an enforceable contract requires five elements:
• Capacity to enter the contract.
• Offer and acceptance of the terms of the contract.
• Consideration for the promises in the contract.
• Genuineness of assent.
• Legality of purpose of the contract.
Countries with civil law systems do not, however, require consideration for a valid contract.
International Trade in Services
Services, as opposed to goods, are the largest component of the world’s gross domestic 
 product, accounting for 63.4 percent in 2012.33 In the United States, this percentage is even 
higher—services were 79.7 percent of gross national product (GNP) in 2012.34 Furthermore, 
trade in services represents about 29 percent of the total dollar value of U.S. exports.35 The 
United States isn’t the only country exporting services. The popular press continues to 
 report on the “outsourcing” and “offshoring” of U.S. service-sector jobs. Outsourcing 
 generally refers to the contracting by U.S. companies of such services as call centers, 
 accounting, and customer services to foreign companies located in low-wage markets. 

Chapter Sixteen  International Ethics and Law  705
 Offshoring refers to U.S. companies setting up their own offices in foreign low-wage 
 markets to perform services previously done by U.S. employees. Economists argue about 
whether the net effect on jobs in the United States is negative (through the direct loss of 
jobs) or positive (through corporate and consumer cost savings that permit job growth in 
the United States).36
 
What international agreements exist to regulate trade in services? Although interna-
tional trade in goods has been the subject of international agreement since shortly after 
WWII, until 1994 no similar agreement existed covering international trade in services. 
This was remedied with the creation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services 
(GATS), which is now one of the foundation agreements along with the General  Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to which all member countries of the World Trade Organiza-
tion (WTO) must subscribe. [The foundation agreements can be found at the WTO web-
site, in the document area, at www.wto.org]
 
The GATS agreement, still in its infancy, sets forth the general principles for the future 
of trade in services across borders, but at this time requires very little of member countries 
in moving toward the realization of those principles. Rather, it sets the stage for future 
negotiations to reduce barriers to trade in services. The services covered by GATS, and 
therefore by such negotiations, are broad: “any service in any sector except services sup-
plied in the exercise of governmental authority.”37
 
Two important general principles that govern international services negotiations are:
• Most favored nation (MFN) status. WTO members get treatment by the host country no 
less favorable than that given to suppliers from any other country, whether or not the 
other country is a member of the WTO.
• National treatment. The national treatment standard calls for a comparison of the treat-
ment accorded to suppliers from WTO member countries with the treatment accorded to 
domestic suppliers. As a general rule, the treatment is to be “no less favorable” than that 
received by domestic suppliers.
Question
The WTO member nations have only recently turned their consideration to the barriers 
between nations that impede the flow of services across boundaries. In the professions, 
such as medicine, law, and accounting, substantial barriers currently exist. Some barriers 
are in the form of domestic licensure requirements, which in turn often require a particular 
educational background for the applicant. Would establishing a clearinghouse for 
 educational equivalencies around the world and requiring WTO members to honor the 
educational achievements received by applicants in other member countries be a good 
idea? Why or why not?
Employment-Related Regulations
Social responsibility principles such as those in the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights set aspirational goals for countries and business managers, but they are not

 enforceable laws. In the absence of enforceable global labor standards, MNEs are left with 
the obligation to apply substantially varying laws to their employees in different jurisdic-
tions, as well as perhaps having to adhere to their home country laws that have extraterrito-
rial application, such as Title VII for U.S. companies. That said, globalization has 
transformed workplace governance worldwide, both for good and for ill. A government 
seeking to  improve domestic labor conditions can look to policies and practices that have 
been successful in other countries, but a government more focused on developing a com-
petitive advantage may specifically exploit its lower labor standards, such as low wages, to 
attract direct investment by foreign businesses, as seems to be the case for Bangladeshi 
garment workers as previously discussed.
 
Even within countries with protective labor regimes, responsible MNEs may be 
challenged by legal compliance requirements. Not only do substantive laws differ (for 
example, Germany requires a company either to hire the disabled or pay for an exclu-
sion), but required procedures governing employer-employee relationships vary tre-
mendously. For example, as a result of the recent global recession, an MNE might 
reasonably determine that a reduction in force across its operations is prudent. Manag-
ing such a decision equitably and effectively could be a daunting task. In many coun-
tries, nearly all employees may be covered by a works council or trade union with 
whom the MNE might be required to negotiate a reduction, whereas in the United 
States less than 10 percent of employees outside the public sector are covered by col-
lective bargaining agreements.38 In the Netherlands the government must approve 
most layoffs; in Venezuela, Japan, and China a successful reduction in force might 
require either agency or court approval. In Europe, an employer even considering such 
a reduction must consult in good faith with  employees about avoiding or mitigating 
such an action, even if the reduction policy was set by the board of directors at its for-
eign headquarters.39 Similar issues can face MNEs involved in international mergers 
or acquisitions.
Compulsory Retirement
In late 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled that the European Framework Directive 
on Equal Treatment, which prohibits unjustified age discrimination in the workplace, 
 applied to national laws requiring age-based compulsory retirement. The case challenged a 
Spanish law permitting employers to impose a compulsory retirement age. Although the 
Court held the Directive applied to the Spanish law, it nevertheless ruled that the Spanish 
legislation was a lawful, appropriate means of achieving a legitimate government aim. The 
law had been passed during a period of high unemployment in Spain and was intended to 
further a national policy for a better distribution of work between generations.
 
In the United States, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of age against individuals who are 40 or older. It applies to 
decisions to hire or fire, as well as to discriminatory compensation or other terms or condi-
tions of employment. Interestingly, a narrow exception allows universities to require 
 retirement of tenured faculty who reach the age of 70. The ADEA specifically applies to 
American citizens employed overseas by American companies.

Intellectual Property Regulations
Intellectual property, most broadly, refers to creations of the mind. As used here, it refers 
more specifically to creations of the mind for which legal protection is given, especially 
trade secrets, trademarks, patents, and copyrights. It is a form of personal property or per-
sonalty, which is the legal term used to denote all forms of property, both tangible and in-
tangible, other than real property or realty. Realty is comprised only of land or real estate 
and items permanently affixed to the land, such as buildings.
 
The commercial significance of intellectual property has grown tremendously; by one 
estimate, “70% of the value of publicly traded corporations is estimated to be in ‘intangible 
assets.’”40 Theft of intellectual property has also grown tremendously; dollar losses amount 
to hundreds of billions annually. Clearly then, understanding the legal protections availa-
ble for intellectual property is of significant importance to business managers. The greatest 
losses are suffered by U.S., European, and Japanese business; the largest threats originate 
from China, India, and Russia. Even though cybersecurity issues are often in the news, a 
lot of theft occurs in other manners, such as when “[hard] drives are either duplicated on 
site or physically stolen by bribed employees; employees . . . leave and illegally share pro-
prietary information; products are dissected, re-engineered, and sold without permission or 
payment of royalties; . . . [and] phones are tapped for the purpose of obtaining trade se-
crets.”41 A trade secret can be almost any information that has economic value because it 
is not generally known which a business makes reasonable efforts to keep secret to secure 
an advantage over its competition. 
 
[For more information on the theft of intellectual property, see the report of the Com-
mission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property, which can be found at http:// 
ipcommission.org]
Trademarks
A trademark distinguishes the source of a particular good or service, whether that is ac-
complished by a trade name, packaging, logo, or other distinguishing mark. When the law 
protects a trademark, it grants to the holder of the mark a limited monopoly: No one else 
may use that mark without the holder’s permission. Under the Tariff Act of 1930, it is un-
lawful to import goods bearing a trademark registered with the Patent and Trademark Of-
fice that is “owned by a citizen of, or by a corporation or association . . . organized within 
the United States” without the permission of the mark holder.
 
This provision safeguards a U.S. trademark holder’s rights in the United States from 
infringement by foreign actors. But what about an American company that wants to obtain

 retirement? Why? Is this an issue over which countries should be allowed to differ?

trademark protection in other countries? Each country has distinct trademark regulations 
and offers different levels of protection to marks registered in other countries. For exam-
ple, a battle that lasted nearly a century ended in early 2013 when the EU General Court in 
Luxembourg ruled that the Czech brewer, Budvar, could not assert exclusive use of either 
“Bud” or “Budweiser” throughout the EU because its use of the names was not sufficiently 
widespread. Anheuser-Busch InBev had claimed use of the Budweiser name as early as 
1876, almost 20 years before Budvar was formed.42
 
As of this writing, 174 countries including the United States are parties to a treaty that 
provides protection for trademarks, known as the Paris Convention. More formally called 
the International Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, it was originally 
signed by 11 countries in 1883. According to the Paris Convention, subject to several ex-
ceptions, member countries ensure trademark protection to marks registered in other mem-
ber countries. The convention also provides for national treatment, which requires that any 
individual claiming infringement must have the same protection as would a national of that 
country. A member country may not favor its own nationals over foreigners. Another treaty, 
the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks, attempts to cre-
ate an international trademark system. If a holder registers a trademark with the World Intel-
lectual Property Organization (WIPO) in Switzerland, that mark is protected in all member 
countries requested by the holder. A 1989 Protocol relating to the Madrid agreement aimed 
to render the Madrid system more flexible and more compatible with the domestic legisla-
tions of certain countries which had not been able to accede to the Agreement.”43 The 
United States is a party to the Protocol but has not acceded to the Agreement. [For extensive 
information on WIPO, see www.wipo.int]
 
That said, trademark issues still arise between countries, both even if are parties to the 
Paris Convention and the Madrid Agreement or Protocol. For example, after two French 
courts found Google guilty of infringing on the Louis Vuitton trademark, the highest 
French court sought a ruling under EU trademark law from the European Court of Justice 
(ECJ). At issue was Google’s AdWords service, pursuant to which Google sold ad space to 
a Vuitton competitor next to the search results returned any time Louis Vuitton was en-
tered as a search phrase. The ECJ determined that Google had not impermissibly “used” 
the Louis Vuitton trademark if its role proved to be “merely technical, automatic and pas-
sive,” and it had not been active in “drafting the commercial message” displayed by the 
competitor.44
Patents
A patent is a monopoly on a product, process, or device where the item or process claimed 
is an innovation, unique and inventive, and useful. The Paris Convention covers patents as 
well as trademarks; however, it does not establish a network of protection, even among 
member countries. Patents granted in different member countries for the same invention 
are independent of each other. However, the convention does establish a right of priority, 
which gives a patent applicant filing in one member nation one year from the original fil-
ing to file in other member countries and have the subsequent filings treated as if made on 
the date of the first filing. Nevertheless, because a patent must be original to be registered 
in any country, many countries hold that patents previously awarded in other countries 
automatically preclude additional patent registration.

Chapter Sixteen  International Ethics and Law  709
 
Other issues have made the international enforcement of a patent quite challenging. 
For example, the United States has long awarded patents on a first-to-create basis, 
whereas most other nations have used a first-to-file rule in cases of multiple applicants. 
Following the passage of the America Invents Act in 2011, effective March 16, 2013, 
the United States adopted the first-to-file rule. Europe also seems on the brink of sim-
plifying the patent process across most of the European Union. In late 2012, the 
 European Parliament voted in favor of the creation of a single patent, recognized auto-
matically in 25 EU countries (Italy and Spain have not joined in) without the need to 
file separately in each country, accompanied with a translation into that country’s na-
tional tongue.45
Copyrights
A copyright is a government grant giving the copyright holder exclusive control over the 
 reproduction of a literary, musical, or artistic work. Most developed nations provide copy-
right protection within their borders, but many also belong to international copyright pro-
tection pacts. The Berne Convention of 1886 and the Universal Copyright Convention 
(UCC) of 1952 both provide a measure of international protection against the unauthorized 
reproduction of books, photos, drawings, movies, and the like. Copyright protection ex-
tends for a period provided by national law. For example, in the United States a copyright 
currently spans the author’s life plus 70 years. The United States is a party to the UCC and 
the Berne Convention. 
 
The case below points out that formal accession to an international treaty does not nec-
essarily lead to satisfactory compliance in the view of other signatories.

The URAA accords no protection to a foreign work after its 
full copyright term has expired, causing it to fall into the public 
domain, whether under the laws of the country of origin or of 
this country. Works encompassed by § 514 are granted the pro-
tection they would have enjoyed had the United States main-
tained copyright relations with the author’s country or removed 
formalities incompatible with Berne. Foreign authors, however, 
gain no credit for the protection they lacked in years prior to 
Justice Ginsburg
The Berne Convention . . . is the principal accord governing 
international copyright relations. Latecomer to the interna-
tional copyright regime launched by Berne, the United States 
joined the Convention in 1989. To perfect U.S. implementation 
of Berne, . . . Congress, in 1994 [through enactment of] § 514 of 
the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (URAA) [, extended] copy-
right protection to preexisting works of Berne member coun-
tries, protected in their country of origin, but lacking protection 
in the United States for any of three reasons: The United 
States did not protect works from the country of origin at the

§ 514’s enactment. They therefore enjoy fewer total years of 
exclusivity than do their U.S. counterparts. As a consequence 
of the barriers to U.S. copyright protection prior to the enact-
ment of § 514, foreign works “restored” to protection by the 
measure had entered the public domain in this country. . . .
 
Petitioners include orchestra conductors, musicians, pub-
lishers, and others who formerly enjoyed free access to works 
§ 514 removed from the public domain. They maintain that the 
Constitution’s Copyright and Patent Clause, Art. I, § 8, cl. 8, and 
First Amendment both decree the invalidity of § 514. [All further 
reference to petitioners’ First Amendment argument has been 
omitted.-ed.] Under those prescriptions of our highest law, pe-
titioners assert, a work that has entered the public domain, for 
whatever reason, must forever remain there.
 
[W]e conclude that § 514 does not transgress constitu-
tional limitations on Congress’ authority. . . .
I
Members of the Berne Union agree to treat authors from other 
member countries as well as they treat their own. . . . Each 
country, moreover, must afford at least the minimum level of 
protection specified by Berne. The copyright term must span 
the author’s lifetime, plus at least 50 additional years, whether 
or not the author has complied with a member state’s legal 
formalities. And, as relevant here, a work must be protected 
abroad unless its copyright term has expired in either the 
country where protection is claimed or the country of origin.
 
A different system of transnational copyright protection 
long prevailed in this country. Until 1891, foreign works were 
categorically excluded from Copyright Act protection. Through-
out most of the 20th century, the only eligible foreign authors 
were those whose countries granted reciprocal rights to U.S. 
authors and whose works were printed in the United States. 
For domestic and foreign authors alike, protection hinged on 
compliance with notice, registration, and renewal formalities.
 
The United States became party to Berne’s multilateral, 
formality-free copyright regime in 1989. Initially, Congress 
adopted a “minimalist approach” to compliance with the Con-
vention. The Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 
(BCIA) . . . accorded no protection for “any work that is in the 
public domain in the United States.” . . . Congress indicated, 
however, that it had not definitively rejected “retroactive” pro-
tection for preexisting foreign works; instead it had punted on 
this issue of Berne’s implementation, deferring consideration 
until “a more thorough examination of Constitutional, commer-
cial, and consumer considerations is possible.” 
 
The minimalist approach essayed by the United States did 
not sit well with other Berne members. . . . Mexican authorities 
complained about the United States’ refusal to grant protec-
tion . . . to Mexican works that remained under copyright do-
mestically. The Register of Copyrights also reported 
“questions” from Turkey, Egypt, and Austria. Thailand and 
Russia balked at protecting U.S. works, copyrighted here but 
in those countries’ public domains, until the United States re-
ciprocated with respect to their authors’ works. 
 
Berne, however, did not provide a potent enforcement 
mechanism. . . .
 
The landscape changed in 1994. The Uruguay round of 
multilateral trade negotiations produced the World Trade Or-
ganization (WTO) and the Agreement on Trade–Related As-
pects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The United 
States joined both. TRIPS mandates, on pain of WTO enforce-
ment, implementation of Berne’s first 21 articles. The WTO 
gave teeth to the Convention’s requirements: Noncompliance 
with a WTO ruling could subject member countries to tariffs or 
cross-sector retaliation. The specter of WTO enforcement 
proceedings bolstered the credibility of our trading partners’ 
threats to challenge the United States for inadequate compli-
ance with Article 18. 
 
Congress’ response to the Uruguay agreements put to rest 
any questions concerning U.S. compliance with Article 18. 
Section 514 of the URAA extended copyright to works that gar-
nered protection in their countries of origin, but had no right to 
exclusivity in the United States for any of [the previously listed] 
three reasons. . . .
 
. . . Copyrights “restored” under URAA § 514 “subsist for 
the remainder of the term of copyright that the work would 
have otherwise been granted . . . if the work never entered the 
public domain.” Prospectively, restoration places foreign 
works on an equal footing with their U.S. counterparts; assum-
ing a foreign and domestic author died the same day, their 
works will enter the public domain simultaneously. . . .
 
The URAA’s disturbance of the public domain hardly es-
caped Congress’ attention. Section 514 imposed no liability for 
any use of foreign works occurring before restoration. In addi-
tion, anyone remained free to copy and use restored works for 
one year following § 514’s enactment. . . .
 
In 2001, petitioners filed this lawsuit challenging § 514. . . .
II
We first address petitioners’ argument that Congress lacked 
authority, under the Copyright Clause, to enact § 514. The Con-
stitution states that “Congress shall have Power . . . [t]o pro-
mote the Progress of Science . . . by securing for limited Times 
to Authors . . . the exclusive Right to their . . . Writings.” 

Chapter Sixteen  International Ethics and Law  711
Art. I, § 8, cl. 8. Petitioners find in this grant of authority an im-
penetrable barrier to the extension of copyright protection to 
authors whose writings, for whatever reason, are in the public 
domain. We see no such barrier in the text of the Copyright 
Clause, historical practice, or our precedents.
 
. . . Petitioners’ contrary argument relies primarily on the 
Constitution’s confinement of a copyright’s lifespan to a “lim-
ited Tim[e].” “Removing works from the public domain,” they 
contend, “violates the ‘limited [t]imes’ restriction by turning a 
fixed and predictable period into one that can be reset or res-
urrected at any time, even after it expires.” 
 
Our decision in Eldred [v. Ashcroft] is largely dispositive of 
petitioners’ limited-time argument. There we addressed the 
question whether Congress violated the Copyright Clause 
when it extended, by 20 years, the terms of existing copyrights 
[in the Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA)]. Ruling that 
 Congress acted within constitutional bounds, we declined to 
infer from the text of the Copyright Clause “the command that 
a time prescription, once set, becomes forever ‘fixed’ or ‘inal-
terable.’ ” “The word ‘limited,’ ” we observed, . . . is best un-
derstood to mean “confine[d] within certain bounds,” 
“restrain[ed],” or “circumscribed.” . . .
 
The terms afforded works restored by § 514 are no less 
“limited” than those the CTEA lengthened. In light of Eldred, 
petitioners do not here contend that the term Congress has 
granted U.S. authors—their lifetimes, plus 70 years—is unlim-
ited. Nor do petitioners explain why terms of the same dura-
tion, as applied to foreign works, are not equally 
“circumscribed” and “confined.” . . .
 
The difference, petitioners say, is that the limited time had 
already passed for works in the public domain. What was that 
limited term for foreign works once excluded from U.S. copy-
right protection? Exactly “zero,” petitioners respond. We find 
scant sense in this argument, for surely a “limited time” of ex-
clusivity must begin before it may end. . . .
 
Historical practice corroborates our reading of the Copy-
right Clause to permit full U.S. compliance with Berne. . . .
 
On occasion . . . Congress has seen fit to protect works 
once freely available. Notably, the Copyright Act of 1790 
granted protection to many works previously in the public do-
main. Before the Act launched a uniform national system, 
three States provided no statutory copyright protection at all. 
Of those that did afford some protection, seven failed to pro-
tect maps; eight did not cover previously published books; and 
all ten denied protection to works that failed to comply with 
formalities. The First Congress, it thus appears, did not view 
the public domain as inviolate. . . .
 
Congress has also passed generally applicable legislation 
granting patents and copyrights to inventions and works that 
had lost protection. An 1832 statute authorized a new patent 
for any inventor whose failure, “by inadvertence, accident, or 
mistake,” to comply with statutory formalities rendered the 
original patent “invalid or inoperative.” An 1893 measure simi-
larly allowed authors who had not timely deposited their work 
to receive “all the rights and privileges” the Copyright Act af-
fords, if they made the required deposit by March 1, 1893. And 
in 1919 and 1941, Congress authorized the President to issue 
proclamations granting protection to foreign works that had 
fallen into the public domain during World Wars I and II. . . .
 
Installing a federal copyright system and ameliorating the 
interruptions of global war, it is true, presented Congress with 
extraordinary situations. Yet the TRIPS accord, leading the 
United States to comply in full measure with Berne, was also a 
signal event. Given the authority we hold Congress has, we 
will not second-guess the political choice Congress made be-
tween leaving the public domain untouched and embracing 
Berne unstintingly. 
 
Petitioners’ ultimate argument as to the Copyright and Pat-
ent Clause concerns its initial words. Congress is empowered 
to “promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts” by en-
acting systems of copyright and patent protection. . . .
 
The “Progress of Science,” petitioners acknowledge, re-
fers broadly to “the creation and spread of knowledge and 
learning.” They nevertheless argue that federal legislation 
cannot serve the Clause’s aim unless the legislation “spur[s] 
the creation of . . . new works.” . . .
 
. . . In Eldred, . . . we held that the Copyright Clause does not 
demand that each copyright provision, examined discretely, 
operate to induce new works. Rather, we explained, the 
Clause “empowers Congress to determine the intellectual 
property regimes that, overall, in that body’s judgment, will 
serve the ends of the Clause.” . . .
 
. . . Congress rationally could have concluded that adher-
ence to Berne “promotes the diffusion of knowledge.” A well- 
functioning international copyright system would likely 
encourage the dissemination of existing and future works. Full 
compliance with Berne, Congress had reason to believe, 
would expand the foreign markets available to U.S. authors 
and invigorate protection against piracy of U.S. works abroad, 
thereby benefitting copyright-intensive industries stateside 
and inducing greater investment in the creative process.
 
. . . Congress determined that exemplary adherence to 
Berne would serve the objectives of the Copyright Clause. We 
have no warrant to reject the rational judgment Congress made.
 
Affirmed.

Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property 
As should now be readily apparent, a solid international system for effective protection of 
intellectual property does not yet exist. That said, the Agreement on Trade-Related As-
pects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS) agreement mentioned by the Court in Golan v. 
Holder is having a positive effect. As one of the foundation agreements to which all WTO 
member countries must subscribe, the provisions of TRIPS are enforceable through the 
WTO Dispute Settlement Body, which is discussed later in this chapter. TRIPS establishes 
certain minimum levels of protection for copyrights, trademarks, and patents, and also re-
quires WTO members to adopt effective enforcement measures. Whether members are 
effectively enforcing its provisions remains an issue regularly raised in WTO settings.
Regulation of Multinational Enterprises (MNEs)
With globalization, the number of MNEs has vastly expanded. Precisely because MNE 
operations span the globe, regulating their activities has become quite difficult. For exam-
ple, despite the proven health risks from smoking tobacco and the 177 signatories to the 
Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which addresses controls on ingredients, 
packaging, marketing, cessation programs, and smoke-free spaces (all proven to reduce 
smoking), tobacco companies “are aggressively recruiting new customers in developing 
nations.”46 Philip Morris sued Uruguay claiming that its regulations were excessive. The 
Convention was negotiated under the auspices of the World Health Organization, whose 
head of its Tobacco Free Initiative stated, “They’re using litigation to threaten low- and 
middle-income countries.”47 Philip Morris’s annual sales are twice Uruguay’s gross do-
mestic product. [For more on the Convention, see www.who.int/fctc/en] 
 
In the  absence of effective international regulatory regimes, which do not currently ex-
ist, MNEs also face challenges in trying to comply with many different overlapping, often 
contradictory, national regulatory schemes. Countries that impose regulatory requirements 
on MNEs may, in any given circumstance, be viewed with approval or be accused of 
“regulatory imperialism”48 or be charged with domestic protectionism.49 One of the grow-
ing issues impacting the effective regulation of MNEs is the growth of state-owned com-
panies, both in number and size. They make up 19 of the world’s 100 largest MNEs and 28 
of the top 100 emerging market companies, and are found in almost every industry.50 Many 
are effectively monopolies at home; many are very active abroad. How they will and can 
be effectively regulated outside of their home countries is unknown.

Chapter Sixteen  International Ethics and Law  713
 
We now consider five additional areas of governmental oversight: securities regulation, 
imposition of financial accounting and auditing standards, anticompetitive restraints of 
trade, mergers, and import and export restrictions. The U.S. law covering most of these 
areas was presented in Chapters 9 through 11. Here we will look at their international di-
mensions, particularly with regard to overseeing the behavior of MNEs.
Securities Regulation
Most people in the business world are aware of numerous  corporate financial scandals that 
rocked the world around the turn of the millennium: Enron and WorldCom in the United 
States, Barings Bank in the United Kingdom, HIH Insurance in Aus-
tralia, and Parmalat in Italy, to name a few. In the United States, the 
 Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has long played a major 
role in uncovering and pursuing financial corporate wrongdoing. But 
it also has a reputation outside the United States, as one commentator 
put it, “as the cop on the beat for the world’s securities markets.”51 The SEC has a broad 
reach because of its jurisdiction to regulate all companies that choose to list their equity or 
debt securities on any U.S. securities market, such as the New York Stock Exchange. But its 
reach has long been thought to stretch even further, through the extraterritorial application of 
the fraud provisions in U.S. securities laws. The application of those laws to foreign compa-
nies that list their securities on a U.S. exchange is not an extraterritorial application because 
those companies have voluntarily availed themselves of U.S. capital markets. But what about 
foreign companies not so listed that act wrongfully (in light of U.S. law) such that their con-
duct has a substantial negative effect in the United States or upon U.S. citizens? In a 2010 
case, the Supreme Court held the fraud provisions were only intended to apply within the 
United States.52 Within a month, however, Congress passed the Dodd–Frank Act, making 
clear the extraterritorial enforcement powers of the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice. 
From Chapter 9, you know that another powerful tool for the enforcement of our securities 
laws is the ability of harmed investors to bring private suits against violators. Congress has 
not counteracted the Supreme Court interpretation in that regard.
Accounting Standards
An important component of securities regulation is the establishment of the financial 
 accounting standards that underlie financial statements provided to the public. In the 
United States, accounting standards are under the authority of the SEC. Internationally, 
however, the growth in the number of MNEs and the integration of the world’s capital 
markets have propelled the development of financial accounting standards that could be 
applied transnationally. In 2001, one set of such standards, International Financial Report-
ing Standards (IFRS), was offered for adoption by the International Accounting Standards 
Board (IASB) based in London. Over 100 countries, including the entire European Union, 
have implemented these standards, although many have adopted local variations. In 2006, 
the IASB and the SEC initiated a harmonization project, generally referred to as conver-
gence,  between U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and IFRS. The 
process was intended to eliminate major differences so that investors could more readily 
make comparative evaluations among companies regardless of their home country. 
Whether there will be universal adoption of either system seems highly unlikely as of this 
The SEC has been “the cop 
on the beat for the world’s 
 securities markets.”

writing.53 However, the European Union permits U.S. companies to file GAAP financial 
statements without requiring reconciliation to IFRS, and the SEC permits foreign corpora-
tions to file IFRS financial statements (so long as there are no local variations), without 
reconciliation to GAAP. 
 
The establishment of accounting standards is only one aspect necessary for reliable dis-
closure to make it into the hands of current and future investors. Independent audits of com-
panies’ books also need to be done and by auditors with appropriate credentials. This is not 
difficult for American companies with audit firms that practice in the United States. How-
ever, when foreign companies are listed on a U.S. stock exchange, U.S. investors need to 
know that the financial statements of those companies are reliable. Accounting fraud at 
 Chinese companies has been much in the news for several years. The headline of one Wall 
Street Journal article in 2012 began, “Accounting fraud and China have become synony-
mous for many investors.”54 Accounting firms auditing foreign companies need to be regis-
tered with and regularly inspected by the U.S. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(PCAOB). For Chinese companies listed on U.S. exchanges, this was commonly accom-
plished by having audits done by Chinese affiliates of the Big Four auditing firms. Then 
China changed its regulations and required that such affiliates be owned by a majority of 
Chinese partners, while refusing to allow the PCAOB to inspect the Chinese firms. In May 
2013, some progress was made when China agreed to give the PCAOB access to documents 
from the  Chinese firms which are necessary for the Board to fulfill its oversight responsibili-
ties. The agreement does not, however, allow the PCAOB into China to inspect the Chinese 
audit firms, nor does it allow the SEC to obtain documents relevant to its fraud investiga-
tions.55 For the time being, investors in Chinese companies still need to take to heart the ad-
age, “buyer beware.” [For more information on the IASB and IFRS, see www.ifrs.org]
Choice of Nationality?
In today’s world, a corporation is generally free to choose its “nationality”—that is, its 
home country, the country in which it will establish its legal existence or, using U.S. termi-
nology, the country in which it will incorporate. That nation’s laws will govern the rela-
tionship between the entity and its owners—that is, the corporate governance rules it must 
follow—as well as the accounting standards with which it must comply. If incorporated 
outside of the United States, it will only become subject to U.S. securities laws if it chooses 
to list its securities on a U.S. exchange. Unlike other countries, the United States taxes U.S. 
corporations on their worldwide income, not just the income earned in the United States. 
Thus, if a business incorporates outside the country, it may avoid significant U.S. taxes, 
substantial U.S. regulation, and the extraterritorial application of U.S. laws. 
 
Consider Michael Kors Holdings: its corporate headquarters are in Hong Kong; its 
clothes are manufactured primarily in Asia; its largest office is in New York; it receives 
about 95 percent of its revenues from U.S. and Canadian sales. But it is incorporated in the 
 British Virgin Islands, where it had no operations. Although it launched its initial public 
offering (IPO) of stock in the United States, as a foreign corporation its financial reporting 
requirements are much less than those discussed in Chapter 9. Financial reporting for for-
eign corporations has been deliberately lessened, precisely to make listing securities more

Anticompetitive Restraints
Many countries regulate anticompetitive behaviors such as collusion among competitors 
and abuse of monopoly power. Two prominent examples involve Microsoft and Google, 
both of which have been challenged for anticompetitive behaviors in both the United States 
and Europe. 
 
Microsoft has repeatedly been charged with abusing its monopoly market power in 
computer operating systems (Windows) to provide an advantage for its browser (Internet 
Explorer), media player, and servers. In the United States alone, Microsoft faced three suc-
cessive bouts of litigation brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as numerous 
suits by private plaintiffs, resulting in payment of substantial settlement sums and long-
term government oversight. Microsoft’s actions have also been scrutinized by the  European 
Commission for violations of the EU’s Competition Law, suffering an adverse decision 
and substantial fines in 2004 in a dispute that began in 1998. Then again in 2008, the Com-
mission opened another investigation, which was settled when Microsoft agreed to load a 
ballot box on all new Windows 7 computers sold in Europe that would allow purchasers to 
select any one of 12 competing browsers. Four years later, the Commission fined it $732 
million for failure to live up to the agreement.
 
From the standpoint of fines, Google has fared much better than Microsoft, but it still 
had to undergo two years of investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and a hearing 
before the Senate antitrust panel over whether it had abused its dominant position in 
 Internet search engines, in part by giving more prominent placement to its own services 
over its competitors in returning search results. The investigation by the European Com-
mission covers abuse in both Internet search and advertising markets. As of the time of 
attractive to foreign businesses. Although much of its income is currently taxed in the 
United States, if it grows its international sales, those sales will not be so taxed.56
 
Consider too a company’s choice of place of incorporation for its subsidiaries. For 
some businesses, a significant source of profits derives from royalty and licensing fees 
generated by its intellectual property. Thus, a common tax strategy is to incorporate sub-
sidiaries to hold valuable intellectual properties, like patents, in low-tax jurisdictions. 
Thus, Apple has subsidiaries in Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and the British 
Virgin Islands. “When customers across Europe, Africa or the Middle East … download a 
song, television show or app, the sale is recorded” in Luxembourg.57 Quite legally, 70 
percent of Apple’s profits are allocated to its non-U.S. entities. “Although technology is 
now one of the [United States’] largest and most valued industries, many tech companies 
are among the least taxed.”58
Question
Michael Kors and Apple are acting legally and advantageously by moving some of their 
income tax liabilities out of the United States. Is this a good trend? Is it equitable? Con-
sider smaller companies without the resources for such sophisticated tax advice. What 
about profit-comparable companies which suffer higher taxes because their revenues come 
from physical sales? Is it equitable to countries which provide the infrastructure for high-
tech development? What about the countries that now can collect taxes from businesses 
that have little physical presence other than an office with a mailing address? If there are 
inequities, what might bring them back into balance?

this writing, the investigation had not concluded; the Commission appeared to be seeking 
more significant changes in the way search results are displayed and threatening fines up 
to $5 billion.59
Mergers
In September 2012, the European Commission approved the takeover of EMI Music by 
Universal Music Group, already the dominant music company as gauged by the size of its 
collection of copyright holdings. The approval came with some strings; Universal was re-
quired to sell at least two-thirds of EMI’s assets to a buyer with a “proven track record in 
the music industry” that will serve to act as a “credible competitor.”60 It is not uncommon 
for merger regulators to require accommodations to address antitrust national concerns 
before providing the required approval. Such national-level reviews and negotiations can 
be a significant cost for mergers and acquisitions involving MNEs. Although some bilat-
eral agreements among countries are in place, the approximately 70 countries with merger 
review systems as yet do not have an agreement coordinating their processes—not even at 
the level of coordinating review thresholds, timetables, and required filings.61 
Regulation of Trade
Import Tariffs
The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), now governed by the WTO, regu-
lates import duties among signatory countries to reduce barriers to trade and to ensure fair 
treatment. Without GATT, it is argued, countries with stronger markets would be able to 
secure better deals on imports than would other countries. In addition, countries with 
strong market economies could use the threat of higher import taxes as a bargaining chip 
in other negotiations. To limit such discriminatory practices, the concepts of MFN status 
and national treatment are integral to GATT, just as they are to GATS as discussed earlier 
in the context of international trade in services. Thus, under GATT, a reduced tariff offered 
to one WTO member country must be offered to all WTO members and, once a good has 
been imported, it must be treated just as domestic goods are treated. That, at any rate, is the 
ideal. In practice GATT has not actually done away with nonconforming tariffs. Rather, it 
prohibits countries from moving further away from the ideal, while providing successive 
rounds of multilateral trade negotiations to encourage countries to collectively move 
 forward on achieving these goals.
A Closer Look at U.S. Tariffs
In addition to the fact that the imposition of any tariffs runs counter to the avowed goal of 
free trade, little logic or defense seems to exist for the disparities across tariffs imposed by 
particular countries. For example, in the United States, an 8.5 percent duty is imposed on 
imported women’s wool suits, but no duties are imposed on men’s suits. Furthermore, 
when a broader view is taken that  incorporates whether U.S.-imposed tariffs hit imports 
from all countries fairly or evenly, it is readily evident that they do not. In 2006, both 
France and Cambodia paid $367 million in duties to the United States; but for its payment, 

Chapter Sixteen  International Ethics and Law  717
Export Restrictions
Whereas imports are regulated to protect American businesses, exports by these businesses 
may be regulated for several purposes. The U.S. Export Administration Act of 1979 per-
mits restrictions on goods and technology where exportation would harm national security, 
or where restriction would significantly advance U.S. foreign policy, prevent an excessive 
drain of scarce materials, or reduce serious inflationary impacts from foreign demand. [To 
learn more about U.S. import and export practices, see www.cbp.gov/xp/cgov/trade]
France was able to import $36.8 billion in goods, whereas Cambodia paid the same duties 
for the importation of only $2.2 billion in goods.62
Questions
1. Who in the United States is hurt by the tariffs described above? Who in the United 
States is advantaged by them?
2. Why might U.S. tariffs be friendlier to French products than Cambodian goods?
Rare Earth Elements
China controls 93 percent of the production of rare earth elements—metals less scarce than 
precious metals but still relatively rare. Many of these metals have turned out to be important 
to a wide range of green technologies, such as those used in wind turbines and in the electric 
motors for the Toyota Prius and Chevrolet Volt. They are also used in the electric motors in 
some U.S. missile guidance systems. China has been reducing production and exports of 
such metals to ensure it has an adequate supply for its own needs and to reduce  environmental 
damage from the mines. 63 In 2011, a WTO panel held China’s export control impermissible. 
It noted that the proffered environmental concerns had not resulted in reduced mine produc-
tion.64 The panel’s decision was affirmed on appeal in 2012.65
Question
If these actions were being taken by the United States instead of China, do you think they 
would be defensible under the Export Administration Act? Why or why not?
Fair Trade Regulations: Dumping and Subsidies
To promote fair trade the WTO prohibits the practice of dumping. Dumping occurs when a 
manufacturer sells its goods in a foreign country for less than their normal value. If this prac-
tice causes or threatens material injury to a domestic or established foreign manufacturer in the 
foreign country, the act is prohibited. The price is considered less than normal value if it is less 
than the price charged in the producer’s home country. A firm may want to dump its goods in 
a foreign market for two reasons. First, its home market may be saturated and cannot support 
any further supply. Second, a firm might sell its goods in a  foreign market at a price below 
other competitors and support that price with higher prices in its home country in an effort to 
establish itself and perhaps drive other firms out of the foreign market. After its competitors 
are forced out, the producer may raise prices to the normal level or above. GATT permits re-
taliatory duties to be imposed on countries that have dumped goods in other member countries.

718  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
 
The WTO also prohibits the payment of unfair subsidies by governments. This occurs 
when a government, perhaps in an effort to encourage growth in a certain industry, offers 
subsidies to producers in that industry. The producers are therefore able to sell their goods at 
a price lower than the prices of their worldwide competitors. Subsidies are considered unfair 
when governments use them to promote export trade that harms another country. When unfair 
subsidization is found, the WTO permits the harmed country to impose countervailing duties 
on those products in an amount sufficient to counteract the effect of the offending subsidy. If 
a country feels such countervailing duties have been illegally imposed, it must either sue in 
the courts of the country imposing the duties based on that country’s law or take the dispute 
through the adjudication process provided by the WTO, discussed later in this chapter.
 
An ongoing dispute over solar panels illustrates many of these fair trade regulations. In what 
has been called “the world’s largest antidumping and antisubsidy trade cases,”66 both the United 
States and the European Union contend that China has become the world’s dominant producer 
of solar panels through the provision of subsidies in the form of favorable loans from state-
owned banks and incentives provided by local and provincial governments to Chinese manu-
facturers.67 They also argue that China is dumping its panels into Western markets at prices 
below its cost of production, resulting in more than 20 American and European manufacturers 
cutting back production or going bankrupt. In response, both the United States and the Euro-
pean Union imposed substantial tariffs on the importation of Chinese panels. China responded 
with a tariff of its own—on the importation of polysilicon, one of the main raw materials in the 
production of the panels. This was a move that didn’t particularly harm Chinese panel produc-
ers because of the existence of an abundance of other sources for the polysilicon. As of this 
writing, the countries are in negotiations to find a solution to the increasing trade barriers and 
tensions, and it looks like the European Union and China may be nearing a bilateral solution.
Question
Why do developed countries such as the United States regulate trade through the mecha-
nisms described in this section? Why might a less developed country do so?
Trade Restrictions—A Tangled Web
Even if all could agree that as a whole the world would be better off if all national trade 
restrictions were ended, it does not follow that all countries or that all persons would be 
better off, certainly not in the short run. International trade has never been free of national 
barriers in modern times. WTO negotiations start with existing historical protections and 
member countries agree not to increase barriers and commit to participating in multilateral 
trade negotiations with the goal of lessening restrictions over time. New countries are 
 admitted to the WTO only after sometimes prolonged negotiations with existing members 
over modifications of their existing trade-related barriers deemed necessary before they 
can be admitted. Every country has companies and industries that 
benefit directly from existing barriers, businesses whose profits rely 
on, and sometimes depend on, protection. Each of these businesses 
in turn have employees, suppliers, and communities that  indirectly 
benefit from those protections. Thus, any change in a nation’s trade 
policies will have a negative effect on some segment of its  economy, 
Every country has companies 
and industries that benefit di-
rectly from existing barriers

Chapter Sixteen  International Ethics and Law  719
even if it can be demonstrated that a change would produce a positive effect on the total 
economy.
 
Take a specific example: The United States has had an ongoing dispute with China over 
its protection of and trade in intellectual property. Recently a WTO dispute resolution 
panel ruled that China must permit foreign companies to sell music online in China. The 
panel said China’s prohibition on downloaded music violates a promise China made on 
joining the WTO to open access to foreign mass-produced art. China responded that it 
never promised to open markets in the electronic distribution of sound recordings in a 
 nonphysical form and that the restriction was necessary to protect China’s “public mor-
als.”68 Interestingly, only once has the public morals defense previously been used before 
the WTO—by the United States when it argued in support of its ban on Internet gambling 
over the objections of Antigua. The United States lost. To succeed, a proponent has to be 
able to show that the restriction is “necessary” to defend public morals.
 
Now consider more broadly the trade relationship between the United States and China. 
What other forces influence the resolution of a particular dispute? Consider, for example, 
that China exports to the United States $4.46 of goods for every $1 of goods that the 
United States exports to China, which would suggest that China is more dependent on 
trade with the United States than the reverse.69 Conversely, in significant part because of 
China’s large positive trade balance with the United States, China invests its abundance of 
U.S. dollars in U.S. Treasury bonds. China’s demand for treasuries keeps the interest rates 
the United States pays on those bonds significantly lower than they would otherwise be, 
thus reducing the cost of borrowing by the United States.
 
The United States also has an ongoing trading dispute with Brazil. Brazil forced the 
United States into the WTO dispute resolution process arguing that the $3 billion per year 
the United States has been paying to cotton growers (mostly large agribusinesses in the 
South) constitutes an unfair subsidy. United States companies account for about 40 percent 
of cotton exports globally. The WTO ruled in favor of Brazil and ultimately authorized the 
imposition of countervailing duties. In order to avoid the imposition of those duties, the 
United States negotiated a settlement that permits the United States to keep paying the $3 
billion in subsidies, at least until Congress passes a new farm bill, so long as the United 
States also pays Brazil $147.3 million per year in the interim.70
Questions
1. How would you challenge China’s assertion that prohibiting music downloads is neces-
sary to protect public morals in China? What facts might you look for to support your 
argument?
2. Is it ethical for the United States to dispute China’s protectionist policies while itself 
spending years defending subsidies for a well-developed U.S. industry? Explain.
International Dispute Resolution
As we have seen to this point, international business relationships are highly complex. 
Disputes are inevitable. International dispute resolutions often face roadblocks. Three sig-
nificant international dispute resolution bodies presently exist: the International Court of 
Justice, the European Court of Justice, and the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.

720  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
International Court of Justice
The only court devoted entirely to hearing cases of international public law is the International 
Court of Justice (ICJ) in the United Nations. The ICJ is made up of 15 judges from 15 dif-
ferent member countries. It may issue two types of decisions. It has advisory jurisdiction 
where the United Nations asks the court for an opinion on a matter of international law. 
These opinions do not bind any party. It has contentious jurisdiction where two or more 
nations (not individual parties) have consented to its jurisdiction and have requested a 
binding opinion. Such opinions are not, however, precedent for the ICJ in later cases. [For 
more information about the ICJ, see www.icj-cij.org]
How Binding Are ICJ Decisions?
Just how binding an ICJ contentious case decision actually is on U.S. state and federal courts 
has been called into question by the 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Medellin v. 
Texas.71 The Court, in a 6–3 decision, held that a Texas court did not have to give effect to an 
ICJ ruling in spite of the fact that the case was submitted to the ICJ pursuant to a treaty 
 obligation specifying that the ICJ has “compulsory jurisdiction” for all “disputes arising out 
of the interpretation or application” of the treaty. In the view of the majority, the “most natu-
ral reading” of the “compulsory jurisdiction” language is “as a bare grant of jurisdiction. . . . 
The [treaty] says nothing about the effect of an ICJ decision and does not itself commit 
 signatories to comply with an ICJ judgment.” In his dissent, Justice Breyer observed:
In the majority’s view, the [treaty] simply sends the dispute to the ICJ . . . and 
the U.N. Charter contains no more than a promise to “undertak[e] to comply” 
with that judgment. Such a promise, the majority says, does not as a domestic 
law matter . . . “operat[e] of itself without the aid of any legislative provision.” 
Rather, here (and presumably in any other ICJ judgment rendered pursuant to 
any of the approximately 70 U.S. treaties in force that contain similar provisions 
for submitting treaty-based disputes to the ICJ for decisions that bind the parties) 
Congress must enact specific legislation before ICJ judgments entered pursuant 
to our consent to compulsory ICJ jurisdiction can become domestic law. . . . In 
my view . . . we must look instead to our own domestic law, in particular, to the 
many treaty-related cases interpreting the Supremacy Clause. Those cases . . . 
lead to the conclusion that the ICJ judgment before us is enforceable as a matter 
of domestic law without further legislation.72
European Court of Justice
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) hears cases involving European Community law. Al-
though not required, one judge from each member nation traditionally sits on the ECJ. At 
first glance, the ECJ may not seem a particularly important court for American business. But 
in an age of MNEs, its decisions can be very important. The ECJ ruled on whether, under 
EU trademark law, Google’s AdWord service violated the Louis Vuitton trademark when 
Google sold an ad to a Vuitton competitor next to search results returned any time Louis 
Vuitton was entered as a search phrase.73 The court held, with certain caveats, that it was not 
a violation. [For information on the ECJ, see curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/Jo2_6999/]

Chapter Sixteen  International Ethics and Law  721
WTO Dispute Settlement Body
Although the WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) is not a true court, it is a significant 
 forum for the resolution of international trade disputes between WTO members. The DSB is 
made up of all member governments, usually represented by ambassadors or the equivalent. 
The DSB establishes a panel to hear a particular dispute brought by a member state. The 
panel then reports back to the DSB, which can either accept or reject the panel’s findings. 
Either side can then appeal to the WTO Appellate Body. Again, the DSB can either accept or 
reject the appeals report. If a WTO member fails to comply with the final decision of the 
DSB, the opposing party may seek compensation. If compensation is not agreed on between 
the parties within 20 days, the complaining party can seek authorization for retaliation—that 
is, the suspension of favorable trade concessions to the noncompliant party. The reality of 
this power was demonstrated by the DSB’s authorization of import duties against U.S. goods 
by Brazil as previously discussed. [For more information on the WTO dispute resolution 
function and dispute documents, see www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/dispu_e.htm]
Other International Fora
In addition to the three institutions just discussed, particular treaties may implement spe-
cific dispute resolution processes for disputes arising under that treaty between its signato-
ries. For  example, NAFTA provides for special tribunals before which corporations can, 
and have, brought complaints against governments for actions perceived to be unfair or 
inequitable to them as foreign investors. Of concern to some commentators is that a tribu-
nal under NAFTA can, as a practical matter, operate as a further review of a decision of a 
domestic court. Thus, after the U.S. Supreme Court declined to  review a Massachusetts 
case brought by a Canadian real estate company, the company took its dispute to a NAFTA 
tribunal (which decided that Massachusetts had not  violated international law).74 [For in-
formation on proceedings before NAFTA tribunals against the governments of Canada, 
Mexico, and the United States, see the U.S. State Department site at www.state.gov/s/l/
c3439.htm, as well as a private site, www.NaftaClaims.com]
 
National courts also rule on matters of international law and on matters involving 
business in international settings. In fact, because of the absence of any international 
courts of general jurisdiction, national courts are where most international business 
disputes are heard. When the underlying dispute seems to have little association with 
the forum state, but that state’s national court agrees to rule on the substantive claim, 
legal commentators may lay charges of “judicial imperialism.”75 The principle of com-
ity previously discussed also applies to the exercise of a national court’s jurisdiction.
The Long Road through Court
In the summer of 2007, 12 banana plantation workers from Nicaragua got their day or, 
rather, their four months in a California federal district court.
 
The workers were employed by Dole Food Co. on banana plantations in Nicaragua, 
where a pesticide known as DBCP, manufactured by Dow Chemical Co., was used to in-
crease the weight of the banana harvest and help with rodent and pest control. In 1977 the 
U.S. government suspended the use of the chemical after complaints arose of sterility in 
California workers. When Dow informed Dole that it would no longer be producing the

Arbitration
In light of the difficulty of litigation between parties of diverse nationalities and the desire for 
more certainty and expediency in business transactions, parties to an international contract may 
prefer to insert a clause that calls for the international arbitration of any  dispute. As discussed in 
Chapter 4, arbitration is a nonjudicial means to settle a conflict where the parties agree to a 
hearing in front of a neutral third party who will issue a  binding award decision. [For more in-
formation on international arbitration, see www.arbitration-adr.org and www.i-a-a.ch]
Government Defenses
“Some evil acts don’t violate international law unless they are performed by someone act-
ing with government authority.”78 Even where government action is the source of the 
wrong, two additional doctrines, accepted as general principles of international law, may 
chemical, the two companies agreed that Dow would sell to Dole, for use in Central Amer-
ica, the more than 500,000 gallons that had been returned to it by other purchasers.
 
The plaintiffs were some of the workers who were exposed to DBCP while working for 
Dole in Nicaragua, workers who then became sterile.
 
After a successful suit was brought in the United States in the early 1980s on behalf of 
affected California workers, U.S. law firms began suing in U.S. courts on behalf of workers 
from other countries. Nearly every case ended when American courts ruled that the princi-
ple of forum non conveniens required the lawsuits to be maintained in the countries where 
the workers had suffered their injuries. Their view was that Nicaragua was a more appropri-
ate forum for the dispute. So the workers tried again at home. After lengthy delays and, ul-
timately, a change in Nicaraguan law to facilitate the DBPC lawsuits, in 2002 a Nicaraguan 
court awarded nearly $490 million in damages and other judgments followed. But so far 
Dole and Dow have successfully blocked all enforcement of the judgments in U.S. courts. 
The new laws in Nicaragua have meant, however, that Dole and Dow have ceased invoking 
the forum non conveniens argument against new suits in the United States.
 
After a month of deliberations in the 2007 case in California, the jury awarded six of 
the Nicaraguan workers a total of $3.3 million. Following a number of post-trial motions, 
the companies successfully reduced the award to $1.58 million to be shared among four of 
the plaintiffs. The jury decision as to one plaintiff was overturned and Dole was granted a 
new trial as to another.76 In the years following, Dole filed post-trial motions to have the 
jury verdict thrown out; in 2011, the judgment was vacated. At the same time, each side 
accused the other of fraud, including fraud instigated by the opposing attorneys, but the 
California State Bar is no longer pursuing investigations of those attorneys.77
Questions
1. Why do you think Dole and Dow did not object to the new suits brought in the United 
States after the plaintiffs’ successful suit in Nicaragua?
2. Do you think the Nicaraguan judgments should be enforceable in the United States? 
Why or why not?
3. Apart from whether Dole or Dow Chemical or both are liable for health issues associated 
with exposure to DBCP, was it ethical for Dole to use and Dow to supply DBCP for use 
in Nicaragua and elsewhere after the chemical was banned in the United States? Explain.

pose barriers to the judicial enforcement of a party’s rights: the act of state doctrine and the 
doctrine of sovereign immunity.
Act of State Doctrine
It is generally accepted that a country has absolute rule over what occurs within its borders. 
Consequently, the act of state doctrine holds that a judge in one country does not have the 
authority to examine or challenge the acts of another country within that country’s borders. 
For instance, an American court may not declare invalid the acts of the British government 
taken within its own jurisdiction because it is presumed that the foreign country, Britain, 
acted legally within its own territory.
 
One government action that has caused a great deal of dispute in connection with the act 
of state doctrine is expropriation. Expropriation is the taking by a national government, 
without adequate compensation, of property and/or rights of a foreign person within that 
government’s borders. The United States contends that international law requires compen-
sation for the taking. Not all governments agree with the United States’ position. In 2012, 
Argentina nationalized YPF, an affiliate of a Spanish oil company. Shortly before the gov-
ernment acted, YPF had discovered what may be the world’s largest deposits of natural 
gas. Before its privatization in 1999, YPF had been Argentina’s state energy corporation. 
The reason given for the 2012 nationalization was that YPF’s production had fallen, caus-
ing Argentina to become a net importer of energy.79
Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity
The doctrine of sovereign immunity is based on the concept that “the king can do no 
wrong.” In other words, if the king makes the rules, how could the king ever be wrong? 
As Chief Justice Marshall explained in The Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon,80 “The 
 jurisdiction of the nation within its own territory is necessarily exclusive and absolute. It 
is susceptible of no limitation not imposed by itself; deriving validity from an external 
source would imply a diminution of its sovereignty to the extent of the restriction, and an 
investment of that sovereignty to the same extent in that power which could impose such 
restriction.”
 
The doctrine has been codified in the United States by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities 
Act of 1976 (FSIA), which provides that foreign countries may not be sued in American 
courts, subject to several exceptions. Accordingly, U.S. citizens usually would not be 
 allowed to sue Britain in the U.S. courts, unless the claim falls into one of the following 
FSIA exceptions:
• The foreign country has waived its immunity (that is, it has consented to be sued in 
another country’s courts).
• The legal action is based on a commercial activity by the foreign country in the United 
States or outside the United States but having a direct effect in the United States.
• The legal action is based on personal injuries “caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial 
killing, aircraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision of material support or 
 resources” for such acts.81
Chapter Sixteen  International Ethics and Law  723

724  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
 
Thus, a country that conducts a commercial activity in a foreign country may not hide 
behind sovereign immunity if sued, while a country acting on its own behalf and not for a 
commercial purpose would be able to avail itself of the protection. In 2010 the Supreme 
Court further clarified the FSIA, holding that it provides immunity only to a foreign state 
and not to a foreign official, even if that official is acting on behalf of the state.82
 
The “restrictive theory of immunity” recognized and applied by the United States is to 
be contrasted with the policies of some countries that contend that immunity is absolute—
no exceptions exist. The following case examines sovereign immunity.

serve a rotation in the command post. Colonel Mohammed told 
Hall that such an assignment was unacceptable under Islamic 
law, and Saudis would consider it inappropriate for their offic-
ers to spend long periods of time in a command post with a 
woman present. This in turn could have political ramifications 
at home for the Saudi royal family. Mohammed also informed 
Hall that the Princess and her contingent wanted to speak only 
to male officers when they called the command post. In total, 
three Vance supervisors recommended Butters for the assign-
ment. Saudi military officers denied every request.

On May 28, 1998, Butters filed a charge of gender discrimi-
nation with the California Department of Fair Employment and 
Housing. On October 15, 1998, Butters filed suit . . . for discrim-
inatory constructive termination, retaliatory constructive 
 termination, and wrongful constructive termination in violation 
of public policy under California’s Fair Employment and 
 Housing Act. Vance filed a motion for summary judgment with 
respect to these counts.
 
On July 30, 1999, the district court granted Vance’s motion, 
finding Vance immune from Butters’ suit under the Foreign 
Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). . . . The district court held 
that derivative FSIA immunity attached to Vance because it 
was “acting under the direct military orders of Colonel Mo-
hammed when [it] did not allow the plaintiff to work a full rota-
tion in the command center.” Butters appeals.
II
Butters first contends that FSIA immunity does not attach to 
Vance because the action here was a “commercial activity.” . . .
Chief Judge Wilkinson
Appellant Nyla Butters brought suit against her employer, 
Vance International, claiming that Vance discriminated 
against her on the basis of gender. The district court held that 
Vance was  entitled to immunity from Butters’ suit under the 
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act because Vance’s client, the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, was responsible for Butters not be-
ing promoted.
I
Vance International, headquartered in Oakton, Virginia, pro-
vides security services to corporations and foreign sover-
eigns. In  October 1994, Saudi Arabia hired Vance to augment 
the security provided to Princess Anud, a wife of Saudi King 
Fhad, while the Princess was undergoing medical treatments 
in California. The Saudi military was responsible for protecting 
Princess Anud. The Princess’ residence in Bel Air, California, 
was referred to as “Gold.” Saudi Arabian Colonel Mohammed 
Al-Ajiji supervised all security at the site—three Saudi military 
officers and the Vance agents. . . . The Saudi government paid 
Vance for its services.
 
In August 1995, Vance hired Nyla Butters as a part-time, 
at-will security agent. From 1995 until April 14, 1998 . . . [on] 
several occasions, Butters temporarily worked in Gold’s com-
mand post.
 
In early April 1998, Vance supervisors at Gold recom-
mended that Butters serve a full rotation in the command post. 
. . . Gregg Hall, the Vance detail leader, spoke with Moham-
med. Colonel Mohammed denied Hall’s request for Butters to 
L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E

 
The FSIA defines “commercial activity” as “a regular 
course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial 
transaction or act. The commercial character of an activity 
shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of 
conduct or particular transaction or act, rather than by refer-
ence to its purpose.” . . . The Court elaborated on the distinc-
tion: “[A] state engages in commercial activity . . . where it 
exercises ‘only those powers that can also be exercised by 
private citizens,’ as distinct from those ‘powers peculiar to 
sovereigns.’”
 
The relevant act here—a foreign sovereign’s decision as to 
how best to secure the safety of its leaders—is quintessentially 
an act “peculiar to sovereigns.” . . . Indeed, it is difficult to imagine 
an act closer to the core of a nation’s sovereignty. Providing 
security for the royal family in this country is not a commercial 
act in which the state is acting “in the manner of a private 
player within the market.” . . .
* * * * *
III
Butters next argues that Vance is not entitled to immunity 
since Vance, as opposed to the Saudi officials, was responsi-
ble for the decision not to promote Butters.
A
If Vance was following Saudi Arabia’s orders not to promote 
Butters, Vance would be entitled to derivative immunity under 
the FSIA. . . .
 
. . . To abrogate immunity would discourage American 
companies from entering lawful agreements with foreign gov-
ernments and from respecting their wishes even as to sover-
eign acts. Under the circumstances here, imposing civil 
liability on the private agents of Saudi Arabia would signifi-
cantly impede the Saudi government’s sovereign interest in 
protecting its leaders while they are in the United States.
* * * * *
IV
Any type of governmental immunity reflects a trade-off 
 between the possibility that an official’s wrongdoing will remain 
unpunished and the risk that government functions will be 
 impaired. FSIA immunity presupposes a tolerance for the sover-
eign decisions of other countries that may reflect legal norms 
and cultural values quite different from our own. Here Saudi 
Arabia made a decision to protect a member of its royal family 
in a manner consistent with Islamic law and custom. The Act 
requires not that we approve of the diverse cultural or political 
motivations that may underlie another sovereign’s acts, but 
that we respect them. We thus affirm the judgment.
Questions
1. Why did the court hold that Vance, a U.S. corporation, 
could avoid Butters’s claim of discrimination based on a 
claim of sovereign immunity? Why did Butters argue that 
sovereign immunity should not apply?
2. How do you feel about the end result of this decision? Did 
Butters suffer discrimination? Explain.
Subjecting MNEs to Compliance with the Law of Nations
The largest MNEs have economic strength equaling or exceeding that of some countries. In 
this chapter, we have seen how challenging it can be to effectively regulate their activities. 
That makes it worth asking whether MNEs should be held liable if, in furtherance of their 
economic objectives, they either (1) take advantage of foreign government actors willing to 
subdue a local population or (2) are complicit in a foreign government’s perpetuation of its 
own dominance where the action of the foreign government violates the law of nations.
 
Some foreign plaintiffs are attempting to hold MNEs liable under such circumstances 
in suits brought in U.S. federal courts under the Alien Tort Statute. In one sentence this 
statute authorizes foreign nationals to file civil suits in the United States against those who 
violate “the law of nations or a treaty of the United States.” Enacted in 1789, in the 
1990s the statute began to be used to sue major corporations for alleged complicity in 
crimes violating human rights by foreign governments, including torture, extrajudicial kill-
ings, and war crimes.
 
Many such suits have withstood motions to dismiss by corporate defendants. In some 
cases, juries have found against the plaintiffs; a number of suits have been settled, subject

Enforcement of Decisions
As we have seen, even if a harmed party in an international dispute successfully  initiates a 
judicial proceeding, many procedural hurdles are likely to be encountered.  Recall the fo-
rum non conveniens principle that initially kept the Nicaraguan workers from obtaining 
substantive hearings in U.S. courts. But what happens after the successful conclusion of 
such a suit? Do challenges arise in the  enforcement of the court’s decision?
 
The answer is yes, particularly in those cases where the losing defendant has  insufficient 
or no assets located in the same jurisdiction as the court awarding the plaintiff monetary 
relief. In those cases, the plaintiff may need to present the judgment to a court in a country 
where assets of the defendant are located and seek local enforcement. This is an added 
cost, in time and money, for successful plaintiffs. Furthermore,  enforcement may be diffi-
cult or impossible to obtain.
Enforcing Foreign Judgments When a plaintiff is successful in a California court, but 
the defendant’s assets are in New York, the plaintiff may have to seek enforcement from a 
New York court. In that situation, the U.S. Constitution requires the New York court to 
give “full faith and credit” to the decision of the California court. No such broad policy 
exists in U.S. law with respect to decisions of foreign courts; nor does such a broad policy 
exist in international law. Instead, the court from which enforcement is being requested is 
likely to consider whether the original foreign judgment violates local notions of justice 
and morality, or is otherwise contrary to public policy, so as not to be entitled to enforce-
ment. This is also true of foreign arbitration awards if the losing party has refused to satisfy 
the award—even if both countries are among the 142 current signatories of the United 
 Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (also 
known as the New York Convention). [Current information on the status of the conven-
tion, as well as additional information, can be found at www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/
uncitral_texts/arbitration/NYConvention.html]
 
To illustrate, consider the previously discussed Nicaraguan banana plantation workers. After 
U.S. courts largely refused to allow substantive hearings in the 1980s based on forum non con-
veniens, the workers took their claims back to Nicaragua, which was exactly what U.S. courts 
generally to a restriction that the settlement terms not be publicly disclosed. An exception 
to such nondisclosure was a 2009 settlement for $15.5 million of claims against Royal 
Dutch Shell for its role in the Nigerian government’s execution of local activists who pro-
tested the environmental damage caused by oil drilling in the Niger delta.83
 
Other plaintiffs did not settle. On April 17, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court foreclosed 
their claims, holding that the Alien Tort Statute was subject to the traditional presumption 
against extraterritorial application, but suggesting that cases that “touch and concern the 
territory of the United States” might “displace the presumption.”84 U.S. courts may not 
hear claims of foreign plaintiffs against foreign companies on foreign soil, but other 
claims—such as those of foreign plaintiffs against U.S. companies on foreign soil—per-
haps are still viable.85
 
Under EU law, a European company can be sued “at home for complicity in human-
rights violations committed anywhere in the world.”86

Chapter Sixteen  International Ethics and Law  727
had told them to do. Although resolution of claims in Nicaragua took a long time, some plain-
tiffs obtained substantial judgments there. In response to plaintiffs’  applications to U.S. courts 
for recognition and enforcement of these Nicaraguan judgments, however, the defendant U.S. 
corporations have thus far been successful in avoiding the requested enforcement.
Enforcing U.S. Judgments Similar problems can arise when a U.S. citizen  obtains a judg-
ment from a U.S. court against a foreign national, which judgment is then sent for enforce-
ment to the home courts of the foreign national. Consider the case of an Alabama 15-year-old, 
who died in an accident when the buckle of his motorcycle helmet failed. The helmet was 
made by an Italian company. His mother sued in an Alabama court and won a $1 million 
 judgment. The Italian company refused to pay and the mother presented the judgment to an 
Italian court for enforcement. The Italian Supreme Court found the award of punitive dam-
ages so offensive to its notion of justice that it refused to enforce any of the award. Many 
countries share the Italian court’s distaste for punitive damages in such situations. 87
Question
On balance, do you think it would be better for countries to agree mutually to simply en-
force judgments in favor of private citizens (nationals or nonnationals) obtained from 
 foreign courts, respecting the effort and delay the plaintiff has already undergone in ob-
taining the judgment and without applying culturally based notions of justice? Why or why 
not? If not, try generating a list of principles you think should permit a court to refuse en-
forcement of a foreign judgment.

 1. Thomas Friedman in his 2005 book, The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-
First Century, argues that countries with connected manufacturing supply chains 
won’t go to war with one another. He offers an example of Dell’s multicountry supply 
chain for the manufacture of its laptops. On balance, do you think globalization is a 
catalyst for bringing world peace or a tinderbox that may set international disputes on 
fire through the collision of differing ideals? Explain.
 2. a.  Why do you think China, one of the most communist of nations, wanted to join the 
WTO?
b.  Would it surprise you to learn that Iraq, Iran, and Syria, while not currently WTO 
members, are all formally enrolled as observer countries? This means they are (or 
are considering) pursuing accession negotiations to become WTO member states. 
Why might they be interested in joining the WTO?
 3. From 2010 through 2012 many state legislatures considered or passed laws outlawing 
aspects of Islamic or Shariah law. Some of them would have prohibited the enforce-
ment of private contracts in which a “butcher would no longer be able to enforce his 
contract for halal meat—contracts that, like deals for kosher or other faith-sanctioned

foods, are  regularly enforced around the country. Nor could a Muslim banker seek 
damages for violations of a financial instrument certified as ‘Sharia compliant’ since it 
pays no interest.”88
a. Develop an argument that laws prohibiting enforcement of such contracts would be 
unconstitutional.
b. What historical parallels exist in which laws in the United States were seen to deny 
equal protection to a subgroup of American citizens?
 4. Different countries and cultures have different norms for dress. In the United States, 
for example, some restaurants require men to wear jackets and state law generally 
prohibits even partial public nudity. Public schools often have enforceable dress codes. 
In the 1960s, those codes often prohibited female students from wearing pants. Con-
sider the following:
 
•  In 2010, the French Parliament passed a law forbidding people from concealing 
their faces in public, punishable by fines. Higher fines and prison sentences up to 
one year could be imposed on individuals who encouraged others to ignore the ban. 
 Although freedom of religion is constitutionally protected in France, it is generally 
acknowledged that the purpose of the law was to prohibit Muslim women from 
wearing traditional head coverings and full-body robes. It has been estimated that 
fewer than 2,000 women in France, most of whom are French nationals, wear them. 
Some supporters of the ban have said that such robes are a means of forcing women 
to be submissive and are a sign of enslavement or debasement. Some of the wearers 
say that the dress is a method to concentrate on their religious faith.89 
 
•  Also in 2010, one province in Indonesia, the world’s most populous Muslim- 
majority nation, banned Muslim women from wearing revealing clothes such as 
tight skirts and pants. After their third violation, women could be subject to two 
weeks’ detention. Shopkeepers violating restrictions on selling inappropriate 
 clothing could lose their business licenses.90
a. Do the laws discussed in the sections above seem logical to you? On what basis 
should you judge them?
b. Would conflicts with cultural issues, such as those addressed by the local laws 
above, impact your decision as a manager about where to conduct your business? 
Should they impact your decisions? Explain.
c. If your job required you to live in a country that had laws with which you disagreed 
on moral grounds, would you follow those laws? Explain.
 5. America has embraced fast food. This may be part of the reason that obesity, in the United 
States, has risen at an epidemic rate during the past 20 years. According to the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, currently one-third of the adults in the United States are 
considered obese. Seventeen percent of those between 2 and 19 are obese.
a.  Should other countries be concerned about the influx of American fast-food chains? 
Why or why not?
b. What about countries that provide universal health care?
c.  If a country is concerned about its citizens’ dietary changes, what actions should it take 
in response? Explain. [For more on obesity in the United States, see the website for the

A group called the Hindu Jagran Manch, or the Hindu Awakening Platform, said Valen-
tine’s Day was an affront to Indian traditional culture and warned against Feb. 14 cel-
ebrations in the city. Many conservative segments of Indian society view the day—a 
celebration of romantic love—as indecent.
“Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, and Father’s Day . . . these are all the gimmicks of 
multinational companies to market their products. Valentine’s Day is against the culture 
and ethics of Indian society,” said Vinay Tewari, a Manch leader.91 
 
6.  As a  result of threatened attacks by Manch, many shopkeepers in India’s largest state 
closed for Valentine’s Day. A nation’s cultural values can sometimes conflict with 
“outside” values spread through the process of globalization. Consider the following:
a. Should the shopkeepers have closed their doors?
b. Do you understand how a celebration of “romantic love” might be offensive to some?
c.  Do you think that Valentine’s Day and other U.S. holidays are promoted more for 
their commercial value than to further the stated purpose for the day? Explain. 
 Consider the dates when Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas decorations go 
up in U.S. stores.
 7. Judge Leo Strine, the Vice Chancellor of the Delaware Court of Chancery (the Dela-
ware Court with original jurisdiction over state corporate law cases), has suggested 
that effective regulation of corporate behavior will require nations to give up some 
of their sovereignty to international institutions in exchange for regulation of the 
global product and financial markets in which multinational corporations conduct 
their  business.92
a. Do you agree?
b.  Will some form of corporate global regulation be necessary to protect all of the 
stakeholders of such corporations?
 8. a.  What are the relative advantages and disadvantages of each form of doing business 
in a foreign country?
b. Why would a firm choose one form over another?
 9. What may look to one observer like the application of objective standards may 
 appear to another observer as improper protectionism. Originally signed in the mid-
1990s, NAFTA calls for an open border for commercial truck traffic among  Canada, 
the United States, and Mexico. But in early 2005, Mexican trucks were still not 
 allowed into the United States, due in part to litigation brought by environmental 
and labor groups. Their claim was that the United States hadn’t appropriately con-
sidered the environmental impact of letting Mexican trucks roll on American roads 
because there are no standardized emissions rules for commercial vehicles. On 
 balance, does this argument sound to you more like a principled objection or like 
protection for U.S. jobs? Why? See Dept. of Transportation v. Public Citizen, 541 
U.S. 752 (2004).
 10. Original Appalachian Artworks (OAA) was the manufacturer and license holder of 
Cabbage Patch Kids dolls. Granada Electronics imported and distributed Cabbage 
Patch Kids dolls to the United States that were made in Spain by Jesmar under a li-
cense from OAA. Jesmar’s license permitted manufacture and distribution of the dolls 
in Spain, the Canary Islands, Andorra, and Ceuta Melilla. Under the license, Jesmar 

730  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
agreed not to make, sell, or authorize any sale of the dolls outside its licensed territory 
and to sell only to those purchasers who agreed not to use or resell the licensed prod-
ucts outside the  territory as well. Jesmar’s argument that Granada’s sales did not con-
stitute “gray  market” sales was that OAA’s dolls sold in the United States had 
English-language adoption papers, birth certificates, and instructions while Granada’s 
dolls came equipped with Spanish-language adoption papers, birth certificates, and 
instructions. In addition, Granada argued that the role of trademark law was to prevent 
an infringer from passing off its goods as being those of another. Such was not the case 
here. Are these sales prohibited? Explain. See Orig. Appalachian Artworks v. Granada 
Electronics, 816 F.2d 68 (2d Cir. 1987); cert. den. 484 U.S. 847 (1987).
 11. Camel Manufacturing imported nylon tents to the United States. The tents held nine 
people and weighed over 30 pounds. The tents’ floors ranged from 8 feet by 10 feet 
to 10 feet by 14 feet. The tents were to be used as shelter during camping. The im-
porter categorized the goods as “sports equipment,” which carried a 10 percent 
import duty, whereas the U.S. Customs Service considered the tents “textile articles 
not specifically provided for,” with a duty of $.25 per pound plus 15 percent import 
duty. The importer appealed the decision. What should be the result? Explain. See 
Camel Manufacturing Co. v. United States, 686 F.Supp. 912 (C.I.T. 1988); aff’d 
861 F.2d 1266 (Fed. Cir. 1988).
 12. Should a Mexican citizen who bought a Chrysler vehicle in Mexico be allowed to sue 
the manufacturer in a U.S. court under U.S. product liability laws when the plaintiff’s 
three-year-old son was killed when the passenger-side air bag deployed during an 
 accident in Mexico? See Gonzalez v. Chrysler Corp., 301 F.3d 377 (5th Cir. 2002); 
cert. den. 538 U.S. 1012 (2003).
 13. Prior to 1941, Kalmich owned a business in Yugoslavia. In 1941, the Nazis confis-
cated his property as a result of Kalmich’s Jewish heritage and faith. Bruno purchased 
the business from the Nazis in 1942 without knowledge of the potential unlawful con-
version. Kalmich contended that because the confiscation was in violation of well-de-
fined principles of international law prior to the German occupation, the transfer to 
Bruno was ineffective. Kalmich sought to apply a 1946 Yugoslavian law called “Law 
 Concerning the Treatment of Property Taken Away from the Owner.” That law 
 provided that where property is taken from its owners, the owner may bring an action 
against “responsible persons” for recovery.
a. Did the act of state doctrine apply in this case?
b.  If not, what should be the result in an American court? Explain. See Kalmich v. 
Bruno, 450 F.Supp. 227 (N.D. IL 1978).
 14. Zedan received a telephone call from a Saudi Arabian organization offering him an 
engineering position at a construction project in Saudi Arabia. The Ministry of 
 Communications, an agency of the government, guaranteed payment to Zedan for any 
work he performed there, whether for the government or for a nonsovereign third 
party. After three years, Zedan left the country without being fully paid. After he 
 returned to the United States, he filed an action in federal court seeking to enforce the 
ministry’s guarantee. The ministry argued that it was protected under the Foreign 
 Sovereign Immunities Act.

a.  Was Zedan’s recruitment in the United States a commercial activity as required by 
the act?
b.  Did this action have a direct effect in the United States as required by the act? 
 Explain. See Zedan v. Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, 849 F.2d 1511 (1988).
15. From time to time courts are called on to determine the enforceability of an 
 arbitration clause contained in a contract. One such case was DiMercurio v. Sphere 
Drake Insurance, 202 F.3d 71 (1st Cir. 2000). DiMercurio was injured in 1994 
when the commercial fishing vessel in which he was working sank. The vessel was 
owned by R&M, which was found by a court to be liable to DiMercurio for his 
injuries and ordered to pay $350,000 in compensation. However, because R&M 
had no other assets, it assigned to DiMercurio all the rights it had against Sphere 
Drake, the London-based insurer of the fishing vessel. When DiMercurio looked 
to Sphere Drake for payment, it denied the claim and invoked the arbitration clause 
in its insurance policy with R&M, which required the arbitration to take place in 
England. Should DiMercurio be required to pursue his claim through arbitration 
in England? Explain.

  Introduction  
 From local decisions—such as routing a new highway around a wetland or allowing the 
use of wood stoves—to colossal fears such as global climate change, environmental issues 
mark our lives in a manner that was unimaginable a few decades ago. From the moment a 
firm begins to produce, service, manufacture, or create, its operations affect the environ-
ment. Imagine all the small decisions made by a company: Does it pack its glassware in 
plastic bubbles or corrugated wrapping? Does it publish a catalog in paper or only through 

Chapter Seventeen  Environmental Protection  737
the Internet? Does it meet with the community before choosing a disposal system? Each 
decision will have an impact on our physical world, so it is critical to understand the legal 
and ethical dimensions of each such decision. 
 A Global View 
  Environmental issues are complex: One action can have variable impacts on the 
 environment—reducing emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) and at the same time ad-
versely affecting water quality. Environmental issues are complex: The consequences of 
action in one location may only manifest themselves at substantial distances, both in space 
and time. Environmental issues are complex: Scientific methodology requires time to es-
tablish causation with a sufficient coefficient of probability to offset countervailing eco-
nomic harm arguments. Environmental issues are complex: The Earth is a closed, complex, 
and unique system. No computer program can model it; no lab can test possibilities under 
lifelike conditions. Environmental issues are complex: No international body has the juris-
diction or credibility to make enforceable decisions to balance competing national interests 
and protect against devastating harms to the world’s peoples and ecosystem.
 
What observable evidence of this complexity do we have? Consider the following:
• In June 2013, the air pollution in both Singapore and southern Malaysia peaked, with 
the former issuing face masks and the latter declaring a state of emergency. The cause? 
The intentional burning of forests and peat wetland across the Strait of Malacca in 
 Indonesia in favor of expanding palm oil plantations. Indonesia is one of the world’s 
largest emitters of carbon, primarily because of its clearing of forests. The fires burned 
in spite of Indonesia’s pledge to cut its carbon emissions by at least 26 percent by 2020 
and a $1 billion agreement with Norway in support of a UN program to reduce defor-
estation. Both forest and wetlands are “huge absorbers of carbon,” and the forests are 
home to Indonesia’s endangered orangutans.1 
 • For 86 days in 2010, oil spewed out of British Petroleum’s 
Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico. The long-term impacts on sea 
life, shorelines, and coastal communities from the roughly 200 million 
gallons spilled, as well as the effects of the nearly 2 million gallons of 
chemical dispersants used to combat the spill, areu nknown. 2 By vol-
ume it was far larger than the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Prince  William Sound, Alaska. 
Globally, these are not isolated events. For example, in the Niger delta where Royal 
Dutch Shell, Chevron, and ExxonMobil have significant drilling operations, over the 
last 50 years as many as 546 million gallons of oil have leaked into the waters,  3 averag-
ing annually the rough equivalent of the Exxon Valdez spill. [For a copy of the Oil Spill 
Commission’s final report, see http://oscaction.org/resource-center/commission-
reports-papers]  
  •   On Saturday, January 12, 2013, an air-quality monitor at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing topped 
off at 755, referred to as “Beyond Index” because 500 is supposed to be the top of the scale. 
The monitor measures particles 2.5 microns in diameter or less, which are the most danger-
ous; they are fine enough to enter the lungs and the bloodstream. Vehicles, factories, and 
power plants are the source of the pollution, which resulted in the city being deemed unsafe

more than 60 percent of the days in the first half of 2013. The national average during the 
same six months was nearly 50 percent. Recent air pollution studies are disturbing: As a re-
sult of more widespread use of coal, northern Chinese on average live five fewer years than 
their southern Chinese countrymen and “children with prenatal exposure to high levels of air 
pollutants exhibit signs of slower mental development and of behavior disorders.”4 
• Two-and-a-half years after the earthquake and tsunami that crippled its Fukushima plant, 
Japan turned off the last of its 50 nuclear reactors, with no date for returning any of them to 
service. As of the time of this writing, flow of groundwater into the buildings at Fukushima 
had not been stopped; the plan is to try to seal off the buildings “behind a mile-long subter-
ranean wall of ground frozen by liquid coolant.”5 Until the groundwater issue is resolved, the 
plant will continue to produce 400 tons per day of contaminated water, used to cool the dam-
aged reactors, all of which is stored on site. In July 2013, 300 tons of this water was discov-
ered to have drained into the sea. Another looming issue is the need to remove the reactors’ 
fuel cores to safer, long-term storage. Robotic removal is complex. “Molten fuel not only 
piled up like wax from a candle on the vessel floor . . . but ran through cracks into the piping 
and machinery below. . . . [I]t may even have found its way into the ground beneath the 
buildings.”6 Yet another issue is the cleanup of the radioactive contamination that spread 
through the environment at the start of the disaster. At an elementary school about 12 miles 
distant, “[f]or eight hours a day, construction workers blast buildings with water, cut grass 
and shovel dirt and foliage into big black plastic bags—which, with nowhere to go, dot . . . 
the landscape like funeral mounds.”7 The central government is in charge of cleanup efforts 
in the most heavily contaminated areas, but the rest is left for local governments to handle.  
 • According to the World Health Organization, about 1.2 billion people or almost one-
fifth of the world’s population live in areas where water is physically scarce and 
10  percent consume food that has been irrigated with wastewater potentially contami-
nated with chemicals and disease-causing organisms.8 
 • In 2010, a report for the academic journal  Science analyzed the danger level for 25,000 
species, classifying 13 percent of birds as threatened with extinction, 25 percent of 
mammals, and 41 percent of amphibians. 9 
 The concept of   environmental justice   includes the expec-
tation that environmental risks and hazards should be 
equally distributed when measured against wealth or race. 
Studies in the United States have shown that at least some 
risks, such as proximity to hazardous waste disposal sites, 
are not equally distributed.  10   Is the concept of equally dis-
tributed environmental risks a useful tool in assessing 
global environmental hazards? Consider the following:  
 • 
The Niger delta provides 10 percent of U.S. oil imports 
and routinely suffers substantial oil spills, as noted above. 
 • 
Eighty percent of Nigeria’s government revenue 
comes from the Niger delta, but life expectancy in the 
delta is the lowest in Nigeria.  11 
 Question 
 Are oil companies guilty of unethical behavior if their drilling 
procedures off the coast of Africa do not take environmental 
precautions equivalent to those they take when drilling in 
U.S. or European waters? Explain.

 Global Environmental Justice 

Chapter Seventeen  Environmental Protection  739
 Part One—A Return to Fundamentals: The Market, Government 
Regulation, and Self-Regulation 
 The first three chapters of this text set up a framework for analyzing the substantive law 
topics that have followed: (1) consideration of how well market forces achieve the goals 
we have for our society; (2) a brief investigation of whether government intervention can 
bring us closer to those societal goals; and (3) reflection on the role that self-regulation, 
through ethical decision making and corporate social responsibility, can and does play in 
realizing our goals. This framework is also useful in evaluating the relationship between 
business and our natural environment.  
 Market Failure? 
 Without regulation, a firm may consider that dumping its garbage into a nearby canal is no 
big deal. In fact, perhaps the slight amount of garbage the firm dumps is no big deal. How-
ever, if every firm were allowed to dump that amount, the canal might become thoroughly 
polluted. Or consider the possibility that we may all prefer less costly cars that pollute 
more. Would future generations concur? 
 
As discussed in Chapter 8, these examples of water and air pollution would be catego-
rized by economists as   negative externalities  . Wilfred Beckerman, a British economist, 
described the analysis as follows: 
 [T]he costs of pollution are not always borne fully, if at all, by the polluter. . . . Naturally, 
he has no incentive to economize in the use [of the environment] in the same way that he 
has for other factors of production that carry a cost, such as labor or capital. . . . This de-
fect of the price mechanism needs to be corrected by governmental action in order to elim-
inate excessive pollution. 12  
 
 Thus environmentalists claim the market has failed to protect us from pollution, so rules are 
necessary. The public and Congress have apparently agreed: A substantial number of environ-
mental laws have been enacted since the early 1970s—laws that address pollution of our air and 
waterways, that regulate use, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous and toxic wastes, and that 
protect rare plant and animal species. Many of these laws will be discussed in Part Two.  
 
But as we shall see, our conceptualization of the problems we face may be too simplistic. 
The bulk of our environmental laws and regulations were drafted to address compartmental-
ized and discrete issues—clean air or clean water or hazardous waste; particular contaminants, 
point sources, or individual species. They may be inadequate to address the interrelationships 
that characterize both our environment and our social and political structures. 
 
Elinor Ostrom, a Nobel laureate in economics, was a leading scholar of common-pool 
resource management before her death in 2012. She studied how communities develop ef-
fective rules for governing depletable resources such as water, fishing grounds, and the 
atmosphere. Her conclusion, “Trying to find the best set of rules . . . . there isn’t one best 
set.”13 All arrangements—“government-controlled, privatized, or owned by a  community—
work in some places but not in others. The success or failure of a specific approach hinges 
on the match of the specific institutional arrangement, local culture, and particular 

740  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
 problems involved, as well as how the approach is implemented. . . . [P]olicies for com-
mon resources should be considered experiments within complex systems.”14
 Market Incentives 
  One approach federal regulation has taken is to dictate standards with which businesses must 
comply. Such legislation has led to steady, and at times even spectacular, strides forward in 
environmental protection in the United States. But this progress has not  dispelled the view, 
particularly among economists and businesspeople, that standard-setting regulation may not be 
the best approach to remedy environmental problems. They believe that pollution control is not 
so much a matter of law as of economics. It follows that, with proper incentives, the market will 
in some instances prove superior to traditional regulation in preventing and correcting environ-
mental problems. Some examples of market incentives follow.  
 Cap-and-Trade Programs
 The concept behind cap-and-trade incentives is that a government sets a cap on the total 
emissions of a particular pollutant, a cap lower than the existing level of emissions. It then 
issues pollution credits to the most significant emitters of that pollutant. Credit recipients 
can either reduce their discharges to within their credit limit or buy credits from other com-
panies who have reduced their emissions below their own credit amounts. Such programs, 
therefore, allow the most cost-effective pollution reduction methods to be used to reach the 
desired environmental goals. The United States was very successful using this approach to 
reduce sulfur dioxide emissions that were a major factor in the creation of acid rain. 15 By 
1999, electric utilities produced about 41 percent more electricity than they had in 1980 while 
emitting 25 percent fewer tons of sulfur dioxide. 16 In 2007, total sulfur dioxide emissions 
dropped below the long-term goal, ahead of the 2010 statutory deadline. 17   In 2009, the House 
of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 
but the Senate declined to act on it. Independently, however, a coalition of nine Northeast 
and Mid-Atlantic states set up such a program for carbon emissions from power plants in 
their jurisdictions, which in its first three years cut the average annual emissions by 23 per-
cent.18 As part of its program to cut GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, California be-
gan running its own carbon cap-and-trade program on January 1, 2013, the second-largest 
such program in the world, following only the European Union’s.19
Valuing Ecosystem Services
The GHG cap-and-trade programs are more complex than the acid rain program in the 
United States in that there are many, many different sources of GHG emissions and many 
varied ways to reduce global GHG. For example, forests and peat wetlands act as carbon 
sinks—naturally capturing atmospheric carbon and locking it up. Thus, a GHG emitter 
could cause global GHG emissions to decrease by paying a country such as Indonesia to 
prevent deforestation that would otherwise occur. Such an approach to controlling global 
GHG emissions raises complex valuation and verification issues. If country A pays coun-
try B to protect its forests, how many GHG credits should country A receive? How much 
carbon is captured by a square mile of Indonesian forest? How long should country B be 
required to protect that forest for a particular payment?

Chapter Seventeen  Environmental Protection  741
 Tax Laws 
 Tax provisions can also affect behavior, either by encouraging particular behavior through 
tax incentives or by discouraging other behavior through additional taxes. For example, 
there are or have been credits against one’s federal income taxes for solar installations, 
production of power from wind turbines, and purchasing certain new fuel-efficient cars, 
such as hybrids. Conversely, many in the United States favor the imposition of a new fed-
eral tax on carbon, such as a specified tax per ton of carbon dioxide emitted. Proponents 
argue such a tax would motivate emitters to reduce their emissions while simultaneously 
raising revenues, which could be used for one or more of the following: reduce the federal 
deficit, lower corporate tax rates to make U.S. companies more competitive, or compen-
sate lower-income citizens on whom the tax would fall more heavily (through higher gas 
and heating bills). The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the poorest 20 per-
cent of Americans spend 21.4 percent of their income on gas and utilities, whereas the 
richest 20 percent spend only 6.8 percent. Further, 34 of the richest industrialized countries 
collect an average of $68.4 per ton of carbon dioxide, while the United States collects fed-
eral taxes on energy (including the federal gas tax) amounting to $6.30 per ton.21
Some ecologists and economists are working to establish an analytical framework that 
would facilitate targeted conservation investments yielding the highest ecological returns 
by systematically inventorying and valuing the services nature performs, such as carbon 
absorption. Others, such as foresters, chemists, and accountants, are developing ways to 
verify and audit such factors as the amount of carbon stored by a particular stand of trees.
This approach to control of GHG has raised ethical issues. One commentator has ar-
gued that, “farmers should not be paid to reduce their water pollution any more than I 
should be paid to stop mugging people.” In contrast, another sees the possibility of a hy-
brid “stoplight” approach. “The red part is: Here’s some things you can do to your land 
that are so bad that we’re gonna take you to prison. The yellow light is: Here’s . . . some 
minimal stuff that you really ought to do. Then the green light is: Here’s some stuff that’s 
above and beyond the stewardship obligation, and we’re going to pay you for doing it, 
because it’s to the benefit of society.”

Question
If burning fossil fuels is a major catalyst of global climate change, then the developed 
world is the major cause. But citizens of the least developed countries will suffer the 
most severe consequences. If you already suffer food and water insecurity, any further 
disruption is catastrophic. “Because hunger and misery cannot afford to make the 
 distinctions of the well-fed—to choose between cutting a tree or saving it—poverty is 
among the greatest environmental threats in the world.”20 Does this reasoning provide 
a response to the argument that farmers should not be paid to reduce their water 
 pollution? Explain.

Other Incentives
Other targeted market incentives also have been employed to address environmental 
issues. Direct subsidies in the nature of rebates were used in the 2009 federal Cash for 
 Clunkers program. Nearly 678,000 clunkers with a mean miles 
per gallon (MPG) of 15.7 were traded in for new vehicles with 
a mean MPG of 24.9. The estimated annual reduction in oil 
consumption is about 800,000 barrels and in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is ap-
proximately 360,000 metric tons. 22 Government agencies have also subsidized particu-
lar activities through guaranteed loan programs. An Energy Department program 
created in 2005 to encourage application of new pollution-reducing technologies helped 
fund the electric cars produced by Tesla Motors. On a $34 billion loan portfolio admin-
istered the Department, the government has lost only about $800 million (including the 
loan to solar cell company Solyndra, the bankruptcy of which created a political storm 
in 2011). That loss is only a small fraction of the $10 billion Congress set aside to cover 
program losses.23
 Ethical Business Decision Making 
 On a particularly busy corner in a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand, the proprietors of 
a small café, Triniti of Silver, do a brisk breakfast, lunch, and coffee trade. Their menu 
declares their philosophy: “Only organic eggs of free-range chickens are used here; only 
paddock-reared pigs; only certified organic beef—we do not feel happy to encourage 
the inhumane treatment of animals.” Just one example of grassroots, intentional, ethical 
business decision making.  
 
But what level of environmental concern can we expect from managers of publicly held 
corporations? Can we identify examples of environmental corporate social responsibility? 
The answer is a resounding yes—all one has to do is review a sampling of corporate web-
sites.Why are corporate giants voluntarily doing now what they haven’t done in the past? 
In part, the answer may be that the market has changed and market forces are operating to 
reward corporate responsibility. For example, managers may believe that being “green,” or 
being seen as being green by consumers and investors, will improve the corporate bottom 
line. Or a manager may believe that a proactive approach may lessen the likelihood of fu-
ture regulation on an issue that is becoming increasingly visible. 24 
This is one example of a pay-now-or-pay-later analysis. Manag-
ers may take a more environmentally responsible approach now 
because they think the future cost of not doing so could be enor-
mously larger—in negative publicity or in the cost of more stringent future regulation—
than the present actual cost of the action. 
 Does the market actually reward sound environmental prac-
tices?  As a general proposition, that has not been shown, but suc-
cessful green growth examples are multiplying—concrete 
illustrations that economic growth and environment protection are not mutually exclusive.

 Interface Inc., into the world’s largest carpet-tile maker, but customers were pushing for 
the company to develop an environmental strategy. Anderson did. His goal for his com-
pany? By 2020, to produce no GHG emissions and no waste and to consume no raw mate-
rials that could not be rapidly replenished. As of 2010, GHG emissions were down 35 
percent, water usage by 82 percent, fossil fuel consumption by 60 percent. Interface carpet 
is increasingly made out of carbohydrate polymers, rather than petroleum, and old-carpet 
sludge is recycled into pellets that are then used for carpet backing. Seventy-four thousand 
tons of used carpet has been reclaimed from landfills. Company sales increased by 64 per-
cent, and its earnings have more than doubled.25 [For many examples of environmentally

 Question 
 “The single most important and pervasive moral obligation facing mankind is to ensure  survival 
of a healthy planet for our grandchildren and theirs.” 26 Do you agree? Why or why not?  
 Part Two—Laws and Regulations 
 Having reviewed both market forces and ethical business decision making, we turn now to 
government regulation as an approach for meeting our environmental goals.  The United 
States has developed a wide variety of environmental protection laws and remedies, some 
of which are covered in this section. In evaluating a particular regulation, it will be helpful 
to keep in mind the following concepts: 
 • Cost–Benefit Analysis.  Environmental protection can be expensive. How much as a 
society are we willing to pay? Do we want clean air at any cost? We may (or may not) 
be able to estimate the cost of a particular pro-environment action, but we also need to 
consider its benefits, including its economic benefits. How do we 
value human life, represented by a statistical decrease in deaths or 
illness from exposure to environmental pollutants or by decreased 
productivity? When does environmental protection cause the sacrifice of short-term 
economic development? Are there offsetting long-term economic benefits? Can these 
costs and benefits be measured? These are not easy questions. The answers will neces-
sarily be inexact and require subjective judgments and the use of estimates. More atten-
tion, however, is being directed at the effort. A project was initiated in 2007 by the G-8 
nations (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the 
United States) to study environmental monetary values. It has estimated that environ-
mental degradation costs the world economy between $2.5 and $4 trillion annually, or 
up to 5 percent of global GDP.27 
 • Impact on Future Generations.   When performing a cost–benefit analysis, how do we 
evaluate the cost to future generations of our not taking action? How can we measure 
the value to those generations if we do take action? In some cases, future generations 
will bear the brunt of the decision, whatever choice we make. For example, how do 
How do we value human life?

744  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
we measure the impact of climate change on future generations? This is a complex 
question about which there is no scientific or economic consensus.  
 • Proving Causation.     If event A occurs and event B follows, is it necessarily true that event 
A  caused  event B? It could simply be a coincidence that first A was observed and then 
B. Or there could, in fact, be a   correlation   between events A and B, but no actual causa-
tion. For example, event Z might cause both A and B, but no causal link may exist be-
tween A and B. In the environmental area, issues of coincidence, correlation, and 
causation may be extremely difficult to determine. Does exposure to secondhand smoke 
cause lung cancer in some nonsmokers? Did the observed increase in greenhouse gases 
contribute to global warming such that sea levels rose, increasing  the intensity of 
 Hurricane Katrina, in turn causing property damage to a degree that would not otherwise 
have occurred?  28   If, in the example of Z, A, and B, we spend a lot of effort trying to stop 
A to prevent B from occurring, we will be wasting our money. On the other hand, how 
long can we wait to determine definitively whether a causal link exists between A and B? 
Our answer may depend on the severity of the harm we believe is associated with B.  
 • Who Pays?   If we decide to correct an environmental problem, who should pay for the 
correction? If we require corporate America to invest in pollution control devices, the 
cost may be shared between consumers (through increased prices) and investors 
(through a reduced corporate profit). If habitats of endangered species are to be pre-
served, current landowners may simply lose all or a portion of their investment and 
workers employed on the land may lose their jobs. Who should pay? Sometimes the 
issue is where a particular facility, such as a hazardous waste disposal site, should be 
located. Not surprisingly, a common response of citizens near a pro-
posed location is, “yes, it’s necessary, but  not in my backyard !” 
This response is so common, that it is now referred to as NIMBY.  
 • Politics.   Environmental protection in the United States is not just a matter of science, 
cost assessment, and social policy; it is also a matter of politics. California, for example, 
has historically received permission from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
to impose stricter vehicle emission standards than federal law requires. California 
sought similar permission in 2005, in part to add greenhouse gases to the emissions 
regulated. After delaying the decision for two years, on the day in 2007 when President 
Bush signed into law the federal 35 miles per gallon standard, the EPA denied 
 California’s request. California responded by taking the EPA to court. A year later, in 
his first month in the White House, President Obama directed the EPA to reconsider 
California’s application, signaling a sharp break with the Bush administration’s less ag-
gressive stance on climate change. The waiver was approved in June 2009.  29 
 Question 
 What environmental issue do you care about most? Greenhouse gases? Deforestation? 
Drinkable water for the world’s population? Protection of the polar bear? Select an issue 
you care about. (If it’s climate change, select a particular possible response to it, such as 
sharing environmental technologies with developing countries, increasing mileage require-
ments, requiring the use of energy-efficient lightbulbs, etc.) Do some online research for 
related data and then explore your issue in light of the five concepts discussed above.  
“Not in my backyard!”

Chapter Seventeen  Environmental Protection  745
 The Federal Role 
 The federal government has long maintained a role in the protection of the environment—
some argue too great a role. As early as 1899, Congress enacted a law that required a per-
mit to discharge refuse into navigable waters. When it became apparent that private, state, 
and local environmental efforts were not adequate to address the burgeoning problems, 
Congress began taking more aggressive legislative steps in the early 1970s.  
 National Environmental Policy Act 
 The 1970 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) established a strong federal presence in 
the promotion of a clean and healthy environment. NEPA represents a general commitment by 
the federal government to “use all practicable means” to conduct federal affairs in a fashion 
that both promotes “the general welfare” and operates in “harmony” with the  environment.  
 
 NEPA established the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), which serves as an 
adviser to the president. The CEQ is a watchdog of sorts. It is required to conduct studies 
and collect information regarding the state of the environment. The council then develops 
policy and legislative proposals for the president and Congress. [For more on the CEQ, see 
 www.whitehouse.gov/ceq ]  
 
NEPA’s primary influence, however, results from its environmental impact statement 
(EIS) requirements. With few exceptions, “proposals for legislation and other major  federal 
action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment” must be  accompanied by 
an EIS explaining the impact on the environment and detailing reason-
able alternatives. Completing an EIS requires undertaking a cost– 
benefit analysis. It also  requires consideration of  cause-and-effect 
links. Major federal construction projects (highways, dams, nuclear 
reactors) would normally require an EIS, but less visible federal pro-
grams (ongoing timber management or the abandonment of a lengthy 
railway) may also require EIS treatment. Although the focus here is on 
federal actions, thus exempting solely private acts from this scrutiny, a major private-sector 
action supported by federal funding or by one of several varieties of federal permission may 
also require an EIS. Hence private companies receiving federal contracts, funding, licenses, 
and the like may be parties to the completion of an EIS.
 Questions 
  Should a state be required to prepare an EIS if it wants to use federal funds to promote state-
wide tourism? Does it matter which state it is? Consider Iowa and then consider  Hawaii. 30  
 Environmental Protection Agency 
 The private sector was not left without regulation or constraint. The Environmental  Protection 
Agency (EPA) was created in 1970 to mount a coordinated attack on environmental prob-
lems. EPA duties include, among other things, (1) gathering information, particularly by 
surveying pollution problems, (2) conducting research on pollution problems, (3) assisting 
state and local pollution control efforts, and (4) administering many of the federal laws 
 directed to environmental concerns. [For the EPA home page, see  www.epa.gov ]  
NEPA’s primary influence 
results from its environment 
impact statement (EIS) re-
quirements.

A Cautionary Tale
As previously mentioned, many of our environmental laws and regulations were drafted to 
address compartmentalized and discrete issues. This means that, outside of federal action 
triggering the requirement of an EIS, there may be no forum for an activity that may raise 
multiple issues to be evaluated based on its full environmental impact. Consider hydraulic 
fracturing, commonly referred to as fracking, in which a mixture of sand, fluids, and chem-
ical additives are pumped under high pressure into wells to fracture shale rock, thereby 
releasing natural gas for extraction. Substantial reserves of natural gas have been found in 
North America—enough that the United States could overtake Russia as the world’s larg-
est producer of oil and gas, a potential global political game-changer. Approximately 
13,000 new wells are being drilled each year in the United States. If this newly accessible 
gas is used to produce electricity, allowing coal-fired plants which emit twice the carbon 
dioxide as gas to be retired, our total carbon dioxide emissions should decrease. 
However, whether GHG emissions are actually reduced or whether substantial other 
environmental issues are created by the fracking process are questions worth considering. 
At least one report suggests that such issues may well be economically feasible to remedi-
ate, but for the most part companies are not currently required to do so. Specific issues that 
have been raised, but which remain partly or wholly unaddressed, include the following:
• Three to five million gallons of water are used to extract the gas from each well, approxi-
mately 15 percent of which is returned to the surface as “flowback.” The flowback can 
release methane (a GHG 70 times more potent than carbon dioxide) and other toxins into 
the atmosphere, depending in part on whether best available well-completion technology 
is employed. Such technology will not be federally required until 2015, so a substantial 
number of existing wells do not, and will not be required to, use such technology.
• A report released in 2012 by three members of Congress indicates that between 2005 
and 2009, 750 chemicals had been used in the fracking process, some of which were 
extremely toxic, such as benzene and lead. The only fracking fuel additive required by 
federal law to be disclosed is diesel fuel, in part owing to a 2005 exemption placed in 
the Safe Drinking Water Act.
• Numerous concerns have been raised with regard to the impact of fracking on local 
water resources, including concerns that some of the natural gas released may migrate 
out of the wells and negatively affect drinking, surface, and groundwater. These water 
resources may also be endangered by escape of the fracking fluid or by the flowback 
water. The volume of water necessary for the fracking process may also have a nega-
tive impact on local water supplies.
• When not actually in use, both the fracking fluid and flowback waters will require en-
vironmentally sound storage and disposal. Approximately 60 percent of the flowback 
water is recycled by transportation to storage and treatment locations via pipelines or 
trucks and, after treatment (often only by dilution), discharged into surface water. The 
rest may be injected back into the ground, raising some concerns that this deep injec-
tion process may trigger earthquakes.  
• Once extracted, the gas itself requires transportation to refineries by rail or pipeline, 
raising additional environmental issues. Extensions of existing pipelines require regula-
tory approvals, but most rail transport does not.

 Regulation of Air Pollution 
  In the United States we depend on (indeed, we emotionally embrace) the automobile. In 
 doing so, we have opened vistas of opportunity not previously imagined. However, motor 
vehicles also discharge carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and hydrocarbons as by-products 
of the combustion of fuel, thus fouling our air. Today we know those vehicles also are 
 significant emitters of greenhouse gases. Industrial production, manufacturing, generation of 
electricity, and the combustion of fossil fuels in homes and workplaces are also significant 
contributors to the dilemma of dirty air and greenhouse gases.  
 Clean Air Act of 1990 
 Early clean air legislation in 1963 and 1965 afforded the government limited authority. 
The Clean Air Act (CAA) amendments of 1970 and 1977 gave the EPA the power to set 
air quality standards and to ensure that those standards are achieved according to a timeta-
ble prescribed by the agency. Politics brought clean air to the fore in 1990 and the Clean 
Air Act of 1990 followed. It phased in new standards over a period of years, generally re-
quired tougher auto emission controls, cleaner-burning gasoline, and new equipment to 
capture industrial and business pollution, all of which worked toward the general goal of 
reducing airborne pollutants by about 50 percent. Under the CAA, air quality standards are 
set federally, but the states are required to establish implementation plans to achieve and 
maintain those standards.  
 
In recent years, there has been considerable high-profile litigation over clean air 
 standards. The Supreme Court’s decision in  Massachusetts v. EPA , presented below, has 
had the most profound effect. In this case a number of states, cities, and private organiza-
tions joined as petitioners to argue that the EPA had abdicated its responsibility under 
Section 202(a)(1) of the CAA to “prescribe . . . standards applicable to the emission of any 
air pollutant” when it refused to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles.

of a “greenhouse gas.”

challenge of our time,” a group of states, local governments,

Specifically, petitioners asked us to answer two questions

 A well-documented rise in global temperatures has coincided

concerning . . . the Act: whether EPA has the statutory author-
ity to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor ve-
hicles; and if so, whether its stated reasons for refusing to do 
so are consistent with the statute.  
 I 
 Section 202(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act . . . provides: 
 The [EPA] Administrator shall by regulation prescribe 
(and from time to time revise) . . . standards applicable 
to the emission of any air pollutant from any class or 
classes of new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle 
engines, which in his judgment cause, or contribute to, 
air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to 
endanger public health or welfare. . . .  
 The Act defines “air pollutant” to include “any air pollution 
agent or combination of such agents, including any physical, 
chemical, biological, radioactive . . . substance or matter 
which is emitted into or otherwise enters the ambient air.” 
“Welfare” is also defined broadly: among other things, it in-
cludes “effects on . . . weather . . . and climate.”  
 * * * * * 
 II 
  On October 20, 1999, a group of 19 private organizations filed a 
rulemaking petition asking EPA to regulate “greenhouse gas 
emissions from new motor vehicles under Section 202 of the 
Clean Air Act.” . . . As to EPA’s statutory authority, the petition 
observed that the agency itself had already confirmed that it 
had the power to regulate carbon dioxide. In 1998, Jonathan Z. 
Cannon, then EPA’s General Counsel, prepared a legal opinion 
concluding that “CO[2] emissions are within the scope of 
EPA’s authority to regulate,” even as he recognized that EPA 
had so far declined to exercise that authority. Cannon’s suc-
cessor, Gary S. Guzy, reiterated that opinion before a congres-
sional committee just two weeks before the rulemaking 
petition was filed.  
 * * * * * 
 
On September 8, 2003, EPA entered an order denying the 
rulemaking petition. The agency gave two reasons for its deci-
sion: (1) that contrary to the opinions of its former general 
counsels, the Clean Air Act does not authorize EPA to issue 
mandatory regulations to address global climate change; and 
(2) that even if the agency had the authority to set greenhouse 
gas emission standards, it would be unwise to do so at this 
time.  
 * * * * * 
 
Having reached that conclusion, EPA believed it followed 
that greenhouse gases cannot be “air pollutants” within the 
meaning of the Act. . . . The agency bolstered this conclusion 
by explaining that if carbon dioxide were an air pollutant, the 
only feasible method of reducing tailpipe emissions would be 
to improve fuel economy. But because Congress has already 
created detailed mandatory fuel economy standards subject 
to Department of Transportation (DOT) administration, the 
agency concluded that EPA regulation would either conflict 
with those standards or be superfluous.  
 
Even assuming that it had authority over greenhouse 
gases, EPA explained in detail why it would refuse to exercise 
that authority. The agency began by recognizing that the con-
centration of greenhouse gases has dramatically increased as 
a result of human activities, and acknowledged the attendant 
increase in global surface air temperatures. EPA nevertheless 
gave controlling importance to the [National Resource Coun-
cil] Report’s statement that a causal link between the two can-
not be unequivocally established. Given that residual 
uncertainty, EPA concluded that regulating greenhouse gas 
emissions would be unwise.  
 
The agency furthermore characterized any EPA regulation 
of motor-vehicle emissions as a “piecemeal approach” to cli-
mate change and stated that such regulation would conflict 
with the president’s “comprehensive approach” to the prob-
lem. That approach involves additional support for technologi-
cal innovation, the creation of nonregulatory programs to 
encourage voluntary private-sector reductions in greenhouse 
gas emissions, and further research on climate change—not 
actual regulation. According to EPA, unilateral EPA regulation 
of motor-vehicle greenhouse gas emissions might also ham-
per the president’s ability to persuade key developing coun-
tries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
 V [III-IV omitted-ed.] 
 * * * * * 
 [We] “may reverse any such action found to be . . . arbitrary, 
capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accord-
ance with law.”  
 VI 
 On the merits, the first question is whether Section 202(a)(1) of 
the Clean Air Act authorizes EPA to regulate greenhouse gas 
emissions from new motor vehicles in the event that it forms a 
“judgment” that such emissions contribute to climate change. 
We have little trouble concluding that it does. . . .  
 
The statutory text forecloses EPA’s reading. The Clean Air 
Act’s sweeping definition of “air pollutant” includes “  any air 
pollution agent or combination of such agents, including  any 
 physical, chemical . . . substance or matter which is emitted 
into or otherwise enters the ambient air. . . . “ On its face, the 
748  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations

definition embraces all airborne compounds of whatever 
stripe, and underscores that intent through the repeated use 
of the word “any.” Carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and 
hydrofluorocarbons are without a doubt “physical [and] chem-
ical . . . substance[s] which [are] emitted into . . . the ambient 
air.” The statute is unambiguous.  
 * * * * * 
   
EPA finally argues that it cannot regulate carbon dioxide 
emissions from motor vehicles because doing so would re-
quire it to tighten mileage standards, a job (according to EPA) 
that Congress has assigned to DOT. But that DOT sets mileage 
standards in no way licenses EPA to shirk its environmental 
responsibilities. EPA has been charged with protecting the 
public’s “health” and “welfare,” a statutory obligation wholly 
independent of DOT’s mandate to promote energy efficiency. 
The two obligations may overlap, but there is no reason to 
think the two agencies cannot both administer their obliga-
tions and yet avoid inconsistency.  
 * * * * * 
 VII 
 The alternative basis for EPA’s decision—that even if it 
does have statutory authority to regulate greenhouse 
gases, it would be unwise to do so at this time—rests on 
reasoning  divorced from the statutory text. While the stat-
ute does condition the exercise of EPA’s authority on its 
formation of a “judgment,” that judgment must relate to 
whether an air  pollutant “cause[s], or contribute[s] to, air 
pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger 
public health or welfare.” Put another way, the use of the 
word “judgment” is not a roving license to ignore the statu-
tory text. It is but a direction to exercise discretion within 
defined statutory limits.  
 
If EPA makes a finding of endangerment, the Clean Air Act 
requires the agency to regulate emissions of the deleterious 
pollutant from new motor vehicles. . . . EPA no doubt has 
 significant latitude as to the manner, timing, content, and coor-
dination of its regulations with those of other agencies. But 
once EPA has responded to a petition for rulemaking, its 
 reasons for  action or inaction must conform to the authorizing 
statute.  Under the clear terms of the Clean Air Act, EPA can 
avoid taking further action only if it determines that green-
house gases do not contribute to climate change or if it pro-
vides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will 
not exercise its discretion to determine whether they do. To 
the extent that this constrains agency discretion to pursue 
other priorities of the administrator or the president, this is the 
congressional design.  
 
EPA has refused to comply with this clear statutory com-
mand. Instead, it has offered a laundry list of reasons not to 
regulate. For example, EPA said that a number of voluntary 
 executive branch programs already provide an effective 
 response to the threat of global warming, that regulating green-
house gases might impair the president’s ability to negotiate 
with “key developing nations” to reduce emissions, and that 
curtailing motor-vehicle emissions would reflect “an inefficient, 
piecemeal approach to address the climate change issue.”  
   
Although we have neither the expertise nor the authority to 
evaluate these policy judgments, it is evident they have noth-
ing to do with whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute 
to climate change. Still less do they amount to a reasoned 
 justification for declining to form a scientific judgment. . . . 
 
Nor can EPA avoid its statutory obligation by noting the 
 uncertainty surrounding various features of climate change 
and concluding that it would therefore be better not to regu-
late at this time. If the scientific uncertainty is so profound 
that it precludes EPA from making a reasoned judgment as to 
whether greenhouse gases contribute to global warming, 
EPA must say so. That EPA would prefer not to regulate 
greenhouse gases because of some residual uncertainty . . . 
is irrelevant. The statutory question is whether sufficient 
 information exists to make an endangerment finding.  
   
In short, EPA has offered no reasoned explanation for its 
refusal to decide whether greenhouse gases cause or con-
tribute to climate change. Its action was therefore “arbitrary, 
 capricious, . . . or otherwise not in accordance with law.” . . .

 1. Under what conditions did the Supreme Court say it had 
the power to reverse the EPA’s decision not to regulate the 
carbon dioxide emissions of new vehicles?  
 2. What did the petitioners, including the State of Massachu-

not do so. What reasons did the EPA give for this refusal? 
What did the Supreme Court say about those reasons?  
 4. Following this decision of the Supreme Court, what was the 
EPA required to do? Was the EPA required to set a standard

caused global warming? What did the Court observe 
about causation?  
Chapter Seventeen  Environmental Protection  749

 AFTERWORD 
 Despite the Court’s 2007 ruling in  Massachusetts v. EPA , not 
until President Obama took office did the EPA rule that GHG 
emissions are pollutants that threaten public health. Built on 
the foundation of its initial endangerment finding, the EPA then 
promulgated rules establishing fuel economy and greenhouse 
gas emission standards for cars and light trucks covering 
model years 2012–2016, as well as a timetable for controlling 
GHG emissions from power plants and other stationary 
sources and targeting those controls to cover only the largest 
emitters. Quickly, the EPA found itself back in court with vari-
ous industry groups and 14 states, arguing in part that the EPA 
had impermissibly relied on scientific findings from the UN In-
tergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the National Re-
search Council, and the U.S. Global Change Research 
Program. In a sharply worded opinion, the federal circuit court 
for the District of Columbia ruled on June 26, 2012, that:  
[the] EPA had before it substantial record evidence 
that anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases 
“very likely” caused warming of the climate over the 
last several decades. … Relying again upon 
substantial scientific evidence, EPA determined that 
anthropogenically induced climate change threatens 
both public health and public welfare. It found that 
extreme weather events, changes in air quality, 
increases in food-and water-borne pathogens, and 
increases in temperatures are likely to have adverse 
health effects. The record also supports EPA’s 
conclusion that climate change endangers human 
welfare by creating risk to food production and 
agriculture, forestry, energy, infrastructure, 
ecosystems, and wildlife. Substantial evidence further 
supported EPA’s conclusion that the warming 
resulting from the greenhouse gas emissions could be 
expected to create risks to water resources and in 
general to coastal areas as a result of expected 
increase in sea level.
 
The Supreme Court granted certiorari and on June 
23, 2014 held that the EPA could regulate GHG emissions 
from stationary sources which were already subject to 
regulation based on their emissions of conventional 
pollutants.31
Greenhouse Gas Regulations
Although many have argued that no GHG regulation will be as effective as a federal cli-
mate bill would be, Congress has thus far chosen not to act. The Obama administration, 
however, has made curbing GHG emissions a priority for his second term and intends to 
do so through administrative rule making. The most far-reaching element in the plan will 
restrict carbon dioxide emissions at power plants—both new plants and existing plants. In 
September 2013, the proposed regulations applicable to new power plants were an-
nounced. By all accounts, the standards will effectively ban new coal-fired plants unless 
carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is installed. Coal, although cheap and plen-
tiful, produces substantially more GHG when used in power production than either oil or 
gas. GHG regulations applicable to existing plants were published in a proposed form in 
June 2014. These regulations set a goal of a 30 percent reduction in carbon dioxide from 
2005 levels by 2030. The states are to develop plans to reduce their emissions and could, 
but are not required to, include cap-and-trade arrangements which would allow more ef-
ficient plants to sell their excess credits to less efficient plants, allowing attainment of the 
required GHG reduction to be achieved as cost-effectively as possible for the state as a 
whole.32 
Non-GHG Air-Quality Regulations
Greenhouse gases are, of course, not the only air pollutant hazardous to health. A 2012 
report from the American Lung Association noted that 41 percent of our population lives 
in counties that exceeded standards set for ozone and particulates from 2008 to 2010.33 In 
recent years, the EPA has issued stricter standards governing such pollutants as ozone,

which is a substantial contributor to smog; fine particulate matter, also known as soot, 
which can enter the lungs and bloodstream and cause respiratory and heart ailments; and 
sulfur dioxide, which contributes to acid rain and smog. Another persistent problem that 
the EPA has attempted to address is air pollution traveling into downwind states and im-
pairing their capacity to attain federally mandated air standards. The Cross-State Air Pol-
lution Rule (CSAPR) would have taken effect on January 1, 2011 had it not been 
challenged in court by nearly 40 separate petitioners, including cities, states, power com-
panies, and various trade organizations. CSAPR would require power plants in 28 states to 
install new pollution controls or buy pollution credits under a limited cap-and-trade sys-
tem. In 2012, the federal circuit court for the District of  Columbia held that the EPA had 
exceeded its statutory authority in the design of CSAPR’s provisions, a decision over-
turned by the Supreme Court, in April 2014.34
 
Even without the new GHG regulations applicable to coal-fired plants and with the de-
layed CSAPR regulations discussed above, tighter regulation of traditional air pollutants 
working in concert with price competition from abundant natural gas, has been reducing 
coal-fired plants’ contribution to power generation. At its peak in 1988, coal provided 
60 percent of our electricity, but by 2012 its share had dropped almost in half.35
 Motor Vehicle Emission Standards 
Accompanying the financial crisis, responding to higher gas prices and realizing benefit 
from gradually increasing vehicle mileage, the total gallons of gas consumed has gradually 
decreased since its peak in 2007. Consumption in 2012 was about 6 percent below the 
2007 peak and roughly on par with usage in 2003.36 Continued improvement should result 
from the steady increase in average fuel economy mandates—29 miles per gallon (MPG) 
in 2012 rising to 54.5 MPG for the 2025 model year, standards that have been supported by 
most major auto manufacturers. The latest regulations also incorporate for the first time 
express GHG emission standards, which is particularly significant in that light-duty vehi-
cle emissions account for roughly 17 percent of GHG emissions in the United States.37 On 
average, European vehicles are 30 percent more fuel-efficient than American vehicles, 
except with regard to light-duty vehicles, where U.S. standards are tougher, and heavy-
duty vehicles, for which Europe sets no fuel-efficiency requirements.38 
 Regulation of Water Pollution 
 As with the air, we often treat our water resources as free goods. Rather than paying the 
full cost of producing goods and services, we have simply dumped a portion of that cost 
into the nearest body of water. The results range from smelly to dangerous to tragic. The 
evidence can be found in our local rivers and lakes, but also in our global gulfs, seas, and 
oceans.  
 
 BP’s oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has done and will do untold damage, but the waters 
of the Gulf before the spill were hardly pristine. Ninety percent of America’s offshore 
drilling occurs there, drilling that has gone on for over 60 years and that provides tens of 
thousands of jobs. Since 1964, more than 300 spills releasing over a half million barrels of 
oil have  occurred, not to mention the thousands of tons of “produced water”—a by-product

of drilling that includes oil, grease, and heavy metals—that are dumped annually. After 
World War II, the Gulf was even used by the government to dispose of surplus mines, 
bombs, and ammunition. 39 
 
 The debris of our modern lives—including lightbulbs, bottle caps, toothbrushes, and all 
manner of plastics—also shows up in our oceans.  40    In both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, 
“garbage patches” involving millions of square miles exist, composed primarily of microplas-
tics broken down from larger items, but also including larger objects such as those already 
mentioned. We have ample evidence of the consequences for fish and other aquatic life. As one 
observer who has worked on the Gulf his whole life noted, “You can 
fool people, but you can’t fool the fish.” 41 [For more on the Great Pa-
cific Garbage Patch, see http://education. nationalgeographic

 Federal Policy 
 The 1972 Clean Water Act (CWA), designed to “restore and maintain the chemical, 
 physical, and biological integrity of the nation’s waters,” established two national goals: 
(1) achieving water quality sufficient for the protection and propagation of fish, shellfish, 
and wildlife and for recreation in and on the water and (2) eliminating the discharge of pol-
lutants into navigable waters. The states have primary responsibility for enforcing the 
CWA, but the EPA is empowered to assume enforcement authority if necessary.  
 
 There is no doubt the CWA has resulted in enormous improvements, but there are prob-
lems as well. The EPA conducts national surveys to evaluate water quality, sediment qual-
ity, coastal habitats, and fish-tissue contaminants. Its 2012 report rated the West Coast as 
fair to good; the Northeast, Southeast, and Gulf coasts as fair; and the Great Lakes as 
poor.42 The goals of the Act are implemented primarily by imposing limits on the amount 
of pollutants that may lawfully enter U.S. waters from any “point source” (typically a 
pipe). The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) requires all dis-
chargers to secure a permit, most often from the EPA, but at times from some other gov-
ernment agency, before pouring effluent into a navigable stream. The permit specifies 
maximum permissible levels of effluent and typically also mandates the use of a particular 
pollution control process or device to ensure that level is not exceeded. It also requires the 
permit holder to monitor its own performance and report the results to the state or the EPA. 
 
  But regulation of point sources leaves many pollutants unmonitored. Surface water runoff is 
polluted with our lawn fertilizer, pet waste, and grease and oil from vehicles. In spite of rules put in 
place in 1999, surface water is also polluted by runoff from large row crop, 
hog, cattle, and poultry farms. Nitrogen from fertilizers finds its way into 
the  Mississippi River from sources hundreds of miles from the Gulf—
1.5 million tons of it yearly. As a result, in the Gulf there is a dead zone 
larger in size than Connecticut, in which little life can exist. 43  
 
 Discouragingly, even sources covered by the NPDES neverthe-
less violate the terms of their permits, often with impunity.  The New York Times published a 
series of articles over the fall of 2009 based on records received in response to Freedom of 
Information Act  requests made to every state and the EPA. In them, journalist Charles 
Duhigg presented an alarming picture of CWA violations rising steadily across the nation.

Many violations were  relatively minor but about 60 percent were deemed to be in “signifi-
cant noncompliance.” Fewer than 3 percent resulted in fines or other substantial punishment. 
Some, but not all, of the rise is attributable to insufficient enforcement resources. The num-
ber of regulated facilities more than doubled in a 10-year span, but state enforcement budgets 
remained essentially flat. The EPA made promises to regulate the discharge of such toxic 
substances as arsenic, lead, and cadmium, but has never done so. [To read the articles in this

 Covered Waters 
 Decades after CWA enactment, it remains unclear exactly what waters are actually cov-
ered by the act and therefore subject to EPA regulation. In the 2001  Northern Cook County 
 case that follows, the Supreme Court looked at what qualifies as “navigable waters” for 
purposes of the CWA. Only a bare majority (five) of the justices agreed with this decision; 
the remaining four dissented. In 2006, the Supreme Court again looked at the issue. That 
decision will be discussed following   Northern Cook County. 

a disposal site for baled nonhazardous solid waste. The 
 Chicago Gravel Company informed the municipalities of the 
availability of a 533-acre parcel, . . . which had been the site of 
a sand and gravel pit mining operation for three decades up 
until about 1960. Long since abandoned, the old mining site 
eventually gave way to a successional stage forest, with its 
remnant excavation trenches evolving into a scattering of per-
manent and seasonal ponds of varying size (from under one-
tenth of an acre to several acres) and depth (from several 
inches to several feet).  
 
The municipalities decided to purchase the site. . . . 
   
Section 404(a) grants the Corps authority to issue permits 
“for the discharge of dredged or fill material into the navigable 
waters at specified disposal sites.” The term “navigable wa-
ters” is defined under the Act as “the waters of the United 
States, including the territorial seas.” The Corps has issued 
regulations defining the term “waters of the United States” to 
include.  
 waters such as intrastate lakes, rivers, streams 
(including intermittent streams), mudflats, sandflats, 
wetlands, sloughs, prairie potholes, wet meadows, 
playa lakes, or natural ponds, the use, degradation or 
destruction of which could affect interstate or foreign 
commerce.  
 
In 1986, in an attempt to “clarify” the reach of its jurisdiction, 
the Corps stated that Section 404(a) extends to intrastate waters  
 a.  Which are or would be used as habitat by birds 
protected by Migratory Bird Treaties; or  
 b.  Which are or would be used as habitat by other 
migratory birds which cross state lines; or  
 c.  Which are or would be used as habitat for 
endangered species; or 
 d.  Used to irrigate crops sold in interstate commerce. 
 This last promulgation has been dubbed the “Migratory Bird 
Rule.”  
   
The Corps initially concluded that it had no jurisdiction 
over the site. . . . However, after the Illinois Nature Preserves 
Commission informed the Corps that a number of migratory 
bird species had been observed at the site, the Corps recon-
sidered and ultimately asserted jurisdiction over the balefill 
site pursuant to subpart (b) of the “Migratory Bird Rule.” The 
Corps found that approximately 121 bird species had been ob-
served at the site, including several known to depend upon 
aquatic environments for a significant portion of their life 
 requirements. . . . 
 * * * * * 
   
[The] Corps refused to issue a Section 404(a) permit. The 
Corps found that SWANCC had not established that its proposal 
was the “least environmentally damaging, most practicable 
 alternative” for disposal of nonhazardous solid waste; that 
SWANCC’s failure to set aside sufficient funds to remediate 
leaks posed an “unacceptable risk to the public’s drinkingwater 
supply”; and that the impact of the project upon area-sensitive 
species was “unmitigatable since a landfill surface cannot be 
redeveloped into a forested habitat.”  
   
Petitioner filed suit. . . . Petitioner argued that respondents 
had exceeded their statutory authority in interpreting the CWA 
to cover nonnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters based upon 
the presence of migratory birds. . . .  
 
The Court of Appeals [held] that respondents’ “Migratory 
Bird Rule” was a reasonable interpretation of the Act.  
 
We granted certiorari. . . . 
   
Congress passed the CWA for the stated purpose of 
 “restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and bio-
logical integrity of the Nation’s waters.” In so doing, Congress 
chose to “recognize, preserve, and protect the primary 
 responsibilities and rights of States to prevent, reduce, and 
eliminate pollution, to plan the development and use (including 
restoration, preservation, and enhancement) of land and 
 water resources, and to consult with the Administrator in the 
exercise of his authority under this chapter.” Relevant here, 
Section 404(a) authorizes respondents to regulate the dis-
charge of fill material into “navigable waters,” which the stat-
ute  defines as “the waters of the United States, including the 
territorial seas.” Respondents have interpreted these words to 
cover the abandoned gravel pit at issue here because it is 
used as habitat for migratory birds. We conclude that the 
“ Migratory Bird Rule” is not fairly supported by the CWA. 
   
This is not the first time we have been called upon to eval-
uate the meaning of Section 404(a). In   United States v. River-
side Bayview Homes, Inc. , 474 U.S. 121 (1985), we held that the 
Corps had Section 404(a) jurisdiction over wetlands that actu-
ally  abutted on a navigable waterway. In so doing, we noted 
that the term “navigable” is of “limited import” and that 
 Congress  evidenced its intent to “regulate at least some wa-
ters that would not be deemed ‘navigable’ under the classical 
understanding of that term.” But our holding was based in 
large measure upon Congress’ unequivocal acquiescence to, 
and approval of, the Corps’ regulations interpreting the CWA 
to cover wetlands  adjacent to navigable waters. We found 
that Congress’ concern for the protection of water quality and 
aquatic ecosystems  indicated its intent to regulate wetlands 
“inseparably bound up with the ‘waters’ of the United States.”  
   
It was the significant nexus between the wetlands and 
“navigable waters” that informed our reading of the CWA in 
754  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations

 Riverside Bayview Homes . . . . In order to rule for respondents 
here, we would have to hold that the jurisdiction of the Corps 
extends to ponds that are  not adjacent to open  water. But we 
conclude that the text of the statute will not allow this.  
 
Indeed, the Corps’  original interpretation of the CWA, 
promulgated two years after its enactment, is inconsistent 
with that which it espouses here. Its 1974 regulations defined 
Section 404(a)’s “navigable waters” to mean “those waters of 
the United States which are subject to the ebb and flow of the 
tide, and/or are presently, or have been in the past, or may be 
in the future susceptible for use for purposes of interstate or 
foreign commerce.” The Corps emphasized that “it is the 
 water body’s capability of use by the public for purposes of 
transportation or commerce which is the determinative 
 factor.” Respondents put forward no persuasive evidence that 
the Corps mistook Congress’ intent in 1974.  
 * * * * * 
 
We hold that [the regulations], as clarified and applied to 
petitioner’s balefill site pursuant to the “Migratory Bird 
Rule,” [exceed] the authority granted to respondents under 
Section 404(a) of the CWA. The judgment of the Court of 
 Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is therefore  
 
Reversed. 
 Questions 
 1.  Summarize the arguments made by the Army Corps of 
 Engineers for finding that the government had the power to 
regulate this site under the CWA.  
 2. Explain the Supreme Court’s response to each of the Army 
Corps of Engineers’ arguments previously identified.  
  3.  Did the Supreme Court hold that the government could 
not regulate this type of site or only that Congress had 
not in fact sought to extend its regulation to this type of 
site?  
 4. In your view, should the federal government be able to 
regulate bodies of water that are of significant use by 
migratory birds? Explain. 
 AFTERWORD 
 In the  Northern Cook County   case the Supreme Court evalu-
ated a regulation of the Army Corps of Engineers and deter-
mined that the Corps exceeded its scope of authority under 
the CWA. All nine justices agreed that the term “navigable 
waters” should be interpreted more broadly than its literal 
meaning, but only four of the justices would have approved the 
Corps’ expansive reading of the statute.  
 
In the 2006 case,  Repanos v. United States , the Supreme 
Court once again reviewed the term “navigable waters.”  44 The 
same four justices dissented, arguing that the revised, but still 
broad authority asserted by the Corps was permissible under the 
statute. This time, however, the remaining five justices did not 
agree on the reach of the CWA, but only agreed that the Corps 
was still asserting an authority broader than allowable. The re-
sult was that the case was remanded for “further  proceedings” 
but without a standard on which to base those proceedings. The 
bottom line was that the government was required once again to 
define the scope of its regulatory  authority.  
  In the meantime, enforcement under the Act has been 
 substantially hampered. “In drier states, some polluters say 
the act no longer applies to them and are therefore refusing to 
renew or ap-
ply for per-
mits, making it 
impossible to 
monitor what they are dumping.” A case in point—Cannon Air 
Force Base in New Mexico has informed the EPA that it “no 
longer considers itself subject to the act.” According to  The 
New York Times , it “dumps wastewater—containing bacteria 
and human sewage—into a lake on the base.” 45 In April 2011 
the EPA announced new guidelines, 46   which will no doubt be 
challenged in court.  
 Regulation of Land Pollution 
 Pollution does not fit tidily into separate compartments (air, water, land) as might seem to 
be suggested by the divisions of this chapter. Acid rain debases air and water as well as the 
fruits of water and land such as fish and trees. So too, the problems of land pollution ad-
dressed in this section can seep into the soil, polluting groundwater, and harming plants 
and animals directly and indirectly. This section addresses the laws governing how we 
dispose of waste—solid, hazardous, and toxic.  
In drier states, some polluters say 
the act no longer applies to them.

 Toxic Substances Control Act 
 Because our disposal laws vary based on the classification of the materials being disposed, 
the primary law governing classification is a good place to start. In 1976, Congress ap-
proved the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to identify toxic chemicals, assess their 
risks, and control dangerous chemicals. Under the terms of TSCA, the EPA is empowered 
to review and limit or stop the introduction of new chemicals. Companies must notify the 
EPA before manufacturing or importing new industrial chemicals, but they need not pro-
vide any safety data unless the data they have suggest the substance poses a “substantial 
risk.” The EPA has only 90 days to block the chemical and can only suspend review and 
request company data if the EPA can show a potential risk from the chemical. 
 
The structure of TSCA results in a “safe until proven dangerous” presumption. Only a 
small fraction of 85,000 industrial chemicals in use today have been tested for safety.47 
Some that have been tested, such as formaldehyde, which is used in a wide range of 
 products—from nail polish and hair straighteners to many building materials—are still in 
wide use. The Department of Health and Human Services identified formaldehyde as a 
known carcinogen in June 2011, but as of this writing the EPA still listed it as a “probable 
human carcinogen.”48 Perhaps more disconcerting, the names and physical properties of 
nearly 20 percent of the chemicals in use  are secret from all but a handful of EPA employ-
ees who are required by law to protect the trade secrets of the manufacturers. 49 That protec-
tion prohibits disclosure to other federal officials, state health and environmental 
regulators, and physicians, as well as the public. Although many of these unknown chemi-
cals are likely harmless, in just one month “more than half of the 65 ‘substantial risk’ re-
ports filed” with the EPA by manufacturers “involved secret chemicals.” Only Congress 
can change the law and until it does we are all trading knowledge in exchange for “ensur-
ing the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. [chemical] industry.” 50 [For more on pro-
grams under TSCA, see  www.epa.gov/opptintr/index.html ] 
 Pollution in the Movies 
 Perhaps surprisingly, toxic pollution has provided the central theme in two major Holly-
wood movies:  Erin Brockovich and  A Civil Action . The 2000 movie  Erin Brockovich tells 
the story of a California community’s battle against Pacific Gas & Electric for allegedly 
causing groundwater pollution resulting in extensive illness. [For more information on the 
pollutant at issue in the movie, the carcinogen hexavalent chromium, see   www.atsdr.cdc
.gov/csem/csem.asp?csem=10&po=4] 
 In the 1998 Disney movie  A Civil Action, John Travolta played a plaintiff’s lawyer 
based on a true story about some middle-class families who sued two corporate giants, 
Beatrice Food and W. R. Grace & Co., for allegedly polluting the groundwater in East 
Woburn,  Massachusetts, where eight children died of leukemia. [For more information on 
this pollutant, Trichloroethylene, see   www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=171&tid=30 ]

terminology, describe the causation issues that had to be addressed in the real-life

Chapter Seventeen  Environmental Protection  757
 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act 
  By 1976, the dangers of hazardous substances were becoming apparent to all, and  Congress 
complemented the TSCA with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). The 
act addresses both nonhazardous and hazardous solid wastes. Its provisions for nonhazard-
ous wastes are more supportive than punitive in tone and approach. The federal govern-
ment is authorized, among other strategies, to provide technical and financial assistance to 
states and localities; to prohibit future open dumping; and to establish cooperative federal, 
state, local, and private-enterprise programs to recover energy and valuable materials from 
solid waste. 
 
Subtitle C of the RCRA is designed to ensure the safe movement and disposal of haz-
ardous solid wastes. The generator of the waste must determine if that waste is hazardous 
under EPA guidelines. If so, the waste generator must then create a manifest to be used in 
tracking the waste from its creation to its disposal. Along the cradle-to-grave path, all those 
with responsibility for it must sign the manifest and safely store and transport the waste. 
Once the waste reaches a licensed disposal facility, the owner or manager of that site signs 
the manifest and returns a copy of it to the generator. Disposal sites must be operated 
 according to EPA standards, and remedial action must be taken should hazardous wastes 
escape from the sites. [For more information, see the EPA website at  www.epa.gov
/ epawaste/hazard/tsd/index.htm ] 
 
A preliminary requirement for cradle-to-grave tracking to apply is the statutory require-
ment that, to be solid waste, the material must be “discarded.” The U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia has ruled that “discarded” means “disposed of,” “abandoned,” 
or “thrown away” and has repeatedly held various versions of the EPA’s rules to have been 
too broad because they improperly covered recycling practices when the materials were 
not discarded within the meaning of the statute.  51 Thus,  recycled   hazardous materials are 
not covered by RCRA, although they may be subject to other EPA regulations.  52 
 Household Recycling 
 Our lifestyles result in mountains of waste that grow higher every year. On average each of 
us produce 7.1 pounds of garbage daily. This number is a lot higher than 4.3, the number 
in the prior edition of this text. The difference? It is from real-world data based in part on 
measurements now done at landfills, instead of the estimates and simulations of the EPA’s 
materials flow analysis.53 Of course, we pay an immediate price to dispose of all the lefto-
vers of our lives, but the long-term concern is that the waste will come back to haunt us. 
Even state-of-the-art landfills can leak, with the result that toxic ele-
ments can enter our groundwater. Seventy percent of the toxic waste 
in our landfills comes from electronics. The United States is the 
only industrialized country that has not ratified the Basel Conven-
tion, a treaty prohibiting export or trafficking in toxic e-waste. The 
solution, of course, is to “reduce, reuse, recycle.” 
 
Recycling turns materials that would otherwise become waste into usable resources, 
which can reduce dependence on new materials (reducing deforestation, for example). 
It is now cheaper to recycle an aluminum can than it is to make one from new materi-
als. The same is true of plastic bottles.54 The EPA reports that 85 million tons of 
Seventy percent of the toxic 
waste in our landfills comes 
from electronics.

758  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
 material was recycled in 2010. 55 A growing number of large food and beverage com-
panies in the United States is voluntarily taking on the costs of recycling the consumer 
packaging of their goods, a process known as “extended producer responsibility.” A 
subsidiary of Coca-Cola has taken on the goal of recycling all of its cans and bottles in 
North America by 2015, establishing factories to do just that. Customers in 18 percent 
of Starbucks stores can deposit their cups for recycling, on the way to reaching 
100 percent in 2014. The cups from its Chicago-area stores are trucked to a Wisconsin 
recycling facility where they are turned into paper napkins for the store. Stonyfield 
Farm, which produces organic yogurt, now has bins in Whole Foods stores for the re-
cycling of No. 5 plastic containers—the plastic it uses for its yogurt which most cities 
do not recycle.56 Europe has required packaged goods companies to take financial re-
sponsibility for package recycling for many years.  
 The ultimate recycling approach, however, may be that taken 
by a group of anticonsumerists who call themselves freegans (as 
compared with vegans)—who attempt to live totally on free 
goods found in dumpsters and at “freemeets.” 57 [For sites identi-
fying the availability of free goods, see  www.craigslist.org (select 
“free” from the for sale menu), and  www.freecycle.org ]  
 
Of course, the most cost-effective, environmentally friendly practice of all is to simply 
 reduce consumption. [For a fun, interactive lesson in garbology, see www.naturebridge

 Superfund—Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 
 The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 
(CERCLA), more commonly known as the Superfund, was enacted for the purpose of 
identifying and cleaning up abandoned hazardous waste sites. The process involves the 
assessment and ranking of proposed sites, followed by the development and implemen-
tation of cleanup plans for sites added to the National Priorities List. Cleanups may be 
carried out by the EPA or private parties, either of which may seek reimbursement of 
costs from those liable under the Act.     Potentially responsible parties include present 
owners of the site as well as past owners who operated the site when the hazardous 
wastes were deposited; parent firms can be liable for actions of subsidiaries; and trans-
ferors (successive owners of businesses discharging hazardous 
wastes) are also liable. Any parties found to be responsible are 
strictly liable—that is, liability attaches without proof of either in-
tent or negligence.  
 
Cleanup tends to be very expensive and generally requires considerable time to accom-
plish. The first listed Superfund site, Love Canal in Niagara Falls, New York, was finally 
clean enough to be delisted in 2004. 58 Originally cleanup costs were paid from a trust fund 
created by taxes on chemicals and petroleum, but that taxing authority lapsed in 1995. The 
Superfund program has since been running on annual appropriations and reserve funds. 
According to a recent Government Accountability Office report, that funding is likely to 
Freegans attempt to live 
 totally on free goods found 
in dumpsters and at 
“ freemeets.”
Any parties found to be 
responsible are strictly liable.

 How Does Your Community Compare? 
  Thirty-three years after the passage of CERCLA, some of the country’s most hazardous 
sites remain toxic. Until the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the biggest nuclear waste 
hazard in the Western world was located in southeast Washington—the Hanford nu-
clear facility, a 586-square-mile site constructed as part of the Manhattan project to 
produce weapons-grade plutonium in nine nuclear reactors along the banks of the 
 Columbia River. The highly toxic waste is currently stored in underground tanks, where 
it will continue to wait until at least 2019 when it is projected that a specialized waste-
treatment plant will commence transforming the waste into still-radioactive glass logs 
that will be more suitable for long-term storage.61 [For maps and some aerial pictures of

about liability risks, developers were often reluctant to buy and improve brownfield 
sites, but that  problem was alleviated with the passage of the 2002 Small Business 
 Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act (Brownfields Act). This law

 owners and authorizes increased  funding for state and local programs that assess and

est funding received was only $267 million. 59 As of October 23, 2013, there are 
54  proposed new Superfund sites, 1,314 sites currently on the national priorities list, and 
only 371 sites that have been delisted.  60

 Part Three—Penalties and Enforcement under Federal Law 
 Many environmental statutes require companies to monitor their own environmental per-
formance and report that information, including violations, to the government. As noted 
above in discussing the Clean Water Act, such disclosure does not necessarily lead to any 
form of corrective or enforcement action. Government agencies also have broad authority 
to conduct environmental inspections of both plants and records as necessary, although 
they must obtain search warrants if criminal prosecutions are anticipated. 
 
A broad array of enforcement actions are available to both state and federal agencies. 
Often violators initially are simply warned and a compliance schedule may be prescribed. 
If corrective action is not forthcoming, sterner measures may follow, including an admin-
istrative order to comply. Such orders may be somewhat less effective in the future, given 
the Supreme Court’s 2012 decision in Sackett v. EPA.62 There the Court held the issuance 
of a compliance order under the Clean Water Act, requiring the Sacketts to restore the 
wetlands on their property and subjecting them to a $75,000 per day penalty for any non-
compliance, was a final agency action entitling them to immediate judicial review for de-
claratory relief. It can be expected that the ruling will impact the effectiveness of 
compliance orders under many other environmental programs as well.
 
Alternatively, the government may resort to litigation. It may seek an injunction to pre-
vent continued or future violations or to require the polluter to remediate the environmen-
tal damage that has occurred. Monetary civil penalties and fines may be imposed under 
most environmental statutes. Governments that have incurred cleanup costs responding to 
the violation may also seek recovery of those costs. Although many suits are brought, most 
are settled rather than litigated. Settlement opens the possibility of somewhat more crea-
tive solutions, sometimes including Supplemental Environmental Projects (SEPs). Such 
projects involve the violator undertaking some environmental “good work” or community 
service project. For example, in two separate settlements, Scotts Miracle-Gro agreed to 
pay $500 million in contributions to various charities dedicated to the protection of bird 
populations and $2 million to acquire and protect 300 acres to prevent runoff of agricul-
tural chemicals into nearby waterways.63 [To find other examples of SEPs, explore the 
database maintained by the EPA at   www.epa-echo.gov/echo/about_sep.html ]  
 Imagine you have just been hired as the business manager 
for a chain of restaurants in your state. During the inter-
view process you were told that part of your responsibili-
ties would be to develop more environmentally friendly 
practices to be implemented at all 10 locations, while 
making sure that the changes overall either have a neutral 
or a positive impact on the business’s bottom line. A local 
business school professor is interested in having her stu-
dents do semester projects on the feasibility of various 
green projects for local businesses. Develop a list of pos-

Many environmental laws also provide for the imposition of criminal penalties, as well 
as imprisonment. Individual corporate officers can be held criminally liable if they either 
had actual knowledge of the criminal action or they are held to be a “responsible person” 
under the appropriate law. So, for example, in 2012, Discount Computers, Inc. pleaded 
guilty to violating RCRA by failing to obtain a permit to dispose of hazardous substances 
for exporting used computer monitors containing hazardous wastes to foreign countries, 
including Egypt. Discount Computers was fined $2 million (the estimated value of the 
monitors) and its owner was sentenced to 30 months in prison and assessed a $10,000 
fine.64 Of course, the importance and effectiveness of any enforcement measure depends to 
a significant degree on the extent to which it is both sought and imposed.  According to one 
study of sentences imposed after convictions were obtained, the “bark” of federal sentenc-
ing guidelines for environmental crimes “remains considerably worse than their bite.”  65 
 BP Gulf Oil Spill: A Case Study of Costs 
 The cost to BP as a result of the Gulf oil spill may well exceed the $40 billion that BP has 
publicly expected. Here is an estimate of what BP may pay:  
 • As of mid-2013, BP had already spent $14 billion to plug the Macondo well and 
clean up spilled oil.  
 • In November 2012, BP pleaded guilty to 14 criminal charges and agreed with the 
Justice Department to pay $4.5 billion over five years in fines and other penalties. 
• Under the Clean Water Act, BP is subject to civil fines, based in part on the volume 
of oil spilled as well as the level of BP’s culpability. As of this writing, fines could 
total anywhere from $3.5 to $17.1 billion.
 • State and local governments around the Gulf are also pursuing compensation for 
environmental damage suffered. BP has already agreed to provide an initial $1 bil-
lion for some restoration projects.  
 • BP set up a $20-billion compensation fund in August 2010 to address damages suf-
fered by individuals and businesses. In 2012, BP reached a settlement with tens of 
thousands of Gulf Coast businesses and individuals for economic and property 
loss. That settlement set up standards for establishing claims but did not set a cap 
on the total payments. By July 2013, BP indicated that $19.7 billion of the total 
had been committed. It also stated that there could be another $4.5 billion in pay-
ments due on claims already submitted. New claims could be submitted until April 
2014.  
 • BP will also have legal fees, estimated by one account at $2 billion, including fees 
of experts necessary to pursue and defend the various legal actions. 
  BP may, however, recoup some of these costs if it is successful in any of its suits against 
its minority partners or the rig owner, Transocean Ltd.

 Cook Inlet Beluga Whale v. 
Daley 
156 F.Supp.2d 16 (D.C.D.C. 2001)  
period. On October 19, 1999, the NMFS published a proposed 
rule, not under the ESA, but under the Marine Mammal Protec-
tion Act (MMPA), to list the whale as “depleted.” . . . Under the 
MMPA, the Secretary can designate a species as 
“ depleted” . . . if the Secretary determines that the stock is 
below its  Optimum Sustainable Population. Once a marine 
mammal has been listed as “depleted,” the Secretary is au-
thorized to  promulgate regulations limiting takings by Native 
Americans, but a listing under the MMPA does not have the 
regulatory, economic, and environmental fallout of a listing as 
“threatened” or “endangered” under the ESA.  
 
On June 22, 2000, the NMFS determined that an ESA listing 
was “not warranted.” It is that determination which, in plain-
tiffs’ submission, was “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of dis-
cretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  
 ARGUMENT 
 “In exercising its narrowly defined duty . . . , the Court must con-
sider whether the agency acted within the scope of its legal 
authority, adequately explained its decision, based its decision 
on facts in the record, and considered the relevant factors.” 
Plaintiffs argue that the agency decision in this case improperly 
applied the law and facts to the five-factor determination; failed 
to apply the best scientific and commercial data available; and 
improperly considered political and economic factors.  
 Judge James Robertson 
 The Cook Inlet Beluga Whale . . . is a genetically distinct, geo-
graphically isolated marine mammal with a remnant popula-
tion that inhabits Cook Inlet from late April or early May until 
October or November. NMFS [National Marine Fisheries Ser-
vice] estimates that in the mid-1980s, between 1,000 and 1,300 
whales inhabited the inlet. Today, the population is estimated 
at between 300 and 400 whales. It is not disputed that the sin-
gle most significant factor in the population decline has been 
Native American hunting. . . . That is why, in March 1999, the 
plaintiffs filed a petition to list the Cook Inlet Beluga Whale un-
der the Endangered Species Act (ESA).  
 
The Endangered Species Act delegates to the Secretary of 
Commerce the authority to determine whether fish, wildlife, or 
plant species should be listed as endangered or threatened. A 
species is “endangered” when it is in “danger of extinction 
throughout all or a significant part of its range,” and it is “threat-
ened” when it is “likely to become an endangered species within 
the foreseeable future.” The Secretary’s ESA determination is 
made on the basis of five statutorily prescribed factors, any one 
of which is sufficient to support a listing  determination.  
 
Within 30 days of plaintiffs’ request for an ESA listing, the 
NMFS published formal notice that action under the ESA “may 
be warranted.” That notice triggered a one-year status review 
 L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E  
 Citizen Suits 
 In addition to the aforementioned mechanisms, many environmental statutes allow citizen suits, 
in which individuals may challenge government environmental decisions, such as the granting 
of a permit, and generally demand both governmental and private-sector compliance with the 
law.  Massachusetts v. EPA , the Clean Air Act case above, was brought by a group of states, 
local governments, and private organizations as a citizen suit.  
 
Citizens suits have often been brought under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which 
provides a federal program for the protection of threatened and endangered species and 
their habitats. Such suits may either seek greater protection for a species or argue that pro-
posed protections exceed that which is necessary. The two cases that follow illustrate both 
types of concerns. In the first, more protection for the Cook Inlet beluga whale was sought; 
in the second, plaintiffs argued that too large an area had been designated for the protection 
of the Mexican spotted owl in the southeastern United States. In both cases petitioners lost. 
When reading the cases, pay attention to the process required of the government in listing 
a species as threatened or endangered and in defining its protected habitat. 

Chapter Seventeen  Environmental Protection  763
Chapter Seventeen  Environmental Protection  763
 I. Statutory Factors 
 A decision whether or not to list a species shall be made 
“solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial data 
available . . . after conducting a review of the status of the spe-
cies and after taking into account those efforts, if any, being 
made by any State or foreign nation.” Applying this standard, 
the Secretary must list a species as endangered or threatened 
if “any of Section 1533(a)(1)’s five factors are sufficiently impli-
cated.” Each of the five factors is considered below.  
 (A) The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or 
Curtailment of the Species’ Habitat or Range  The agency’s 
conclusion that “no indication exists that the range has been, 
or is threatened with being modified or curtailed to an extent 
that appreciably diminishes the value of the habitat for both 
survival and recovery of the species,” was not arbitrary or 
capricious. There is no dispute that the Cook Inlet, the whale’s 
habitat, has changed over time in response to the increasing 
demand of municipal, industrial, and recreational activities, 
but there is no record basis for concluding that these changes 
have had a deleterious effect on the whale. Plaintiffs can point 
only to the fact that the whales have increasingly inhabited the 
upper inlet in recent decades. The agency concedes that this 
change in whale behavior might be in response to human 
activities, but no data suggest that the change threatens 
extinction. The agency is not required to conduct further 
testing to determine the effect of various environmental 
factors, such as oil drilling, on the whale population. “The 
‘best available data’ requirement makes it clear that the 
Secretary has no obligation to conduct independent studies.”  
 (B) Overutilization   All agree that Native American harvesting 
has been the most significant factor in the declining whale 
population. The agency has found “that a failure to restrict the 
subsistence harvest would likely cause CI beluga whales to 
become in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future.” But 
the agency has also concluded that “overutilization” does not 
support ESA listing because it has been stopped—by 
designating the whale as “depleted” under the MMPA. 
Plaintiffs attack that conclusion as unreasonable.  
 
If the moratorium fails to control Native American harvest-
ing in the future, ESA listing will be warranted. That much is 
agreed. But plaintiffs have been unable to point to anything in 
the record indicating that the current whale population is un-
sustainable if the harvest is indeed restricted successfully. . . . 
   
[There] is no reason to believe that the MMPA’s enforce-
ment mechanisms, which are identical to those of the ESA, will 
be less effective in controlling illegal takings. Plaintiffs’ con-
cerns are reasonable, and enforcement should be carefully 
monitored, but the record contains support for the agency’s 
conclusion that future takings will be minimal and that the cur-
rent population is sustainable.  
 (C) Disease or Predation  The agency concedes that both 
disease or predation “occur in the CI beluga population and 
may affect reproduction and survival,” but it has concluded 
that these factors are not causing the stock to be threatened 
or endangered. Plaintiff has not shown that conclusion to be 
arbitrary or capricious. . . .  
 (D) Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms We have 
found nothing in the record, and plaintiff has identified nothing, 
showing that there are inadequacies in existing regulatory 
mechanisms or, if there were, what the effects of such 
inadequacies would be. Plaintiffs argue that the MMPA is 
inadequate to ensure that illegal hunting does not occur . . . , 
but that argument simply asserts plaintiffs’ policy preference 
for a remedy under the ESA and begs the question of whether 
ESA listing is required.  
 (E) Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued 
Existence Plaintiffs argue that there are many other factors—
strandings, oil spills, takings through commercial fishing, effects 
of pollutants, ship strikes, noise, urban runoff, etc.—that put the 
species at risk and that it was arbitrary and capricious for the 
agency to determine that “the best available information . . . 
indicates that these activities, alone or cumulatively, have not 
caused the stock to be in danger of extinction and are not likely 
to do so in the foreseeable future.” . . .  
   
It is true that the absence of “conclusive evidence” of a 
real threat to a species does not justify an agency’s finding 
that ESA listing is not warranted. But neither is listing  required 
simply because the agency is unable to rule out  factors that 
could contribute to a population decline. It was not arbitrary or 
capricious for the agency to place its principal reliance on the 
cessation of Native American hunts and the [study that con-
cluded] that the Cook Inlet Beluga Whale population could 
sustain itself, even accounting for stochastic events.

The statute thus differentiates between “occupied” and 
“unoccupied” areas. . . . [We] face the preliminary issue of 
what it means for an area to be “occupied” under the ESA.  
 
It is useful to unpack this inquiry into two components: un-
certainty and frequency. Uncertainty is a factor when the FWS 
 has reason to believe that owls are present in a given area, but 
lacks conclusive proof of their presence. Frequency is a factor 
when owls are shown to have only an intermittent presence in 
a given area. Occasionally, both factors will play a part in de-
termining whether an area is “occupied.” Because the ESA 
permits only one of two possible outcomes for this inquiry-
occupied or unoccupied- . . . we must determine the scope of 
the FWS’s authority to categorize as “occupied” those areas 
that may not fit neatly into either pigeonhole.  
 
We have ample guidance on the “uncertainty” issue. The 
ESA provides that the agency must determine critical habitat 
using the “best scientific data available.” This standard does 
not require that the FWS act only when it can justify its deci-
sion with absolute confidence. . . .  
 
Turning to the “frequency” component, Arizona Cattle asserts 
that the word “occupied” is unambiguous and must be interpreted 
narrowly to mean areas that the species “resides in.” In the 
 context of the owl, they argue that such areas consist only of the 
600-acre PACs. The FWS argues . . . that where a geographic area 
is used with such frequency that the owl is likely to be present, the 
agency may permissibly designate it as occupied. FWS contends 
that, at a minimum, this includes the owl’s “home range”       and 
may include other areas used for intermittent activities.  
 
We cannot agree that “occupied” has an unambiguous, 
plain meaning as Arizona Cattle suggests. The word “occu-
pied,” standing alone, does not provide a clear standard for 
how frequently a species must use an area before the agency 
can designate it as critical habitat. Merely replacing the word 
“occupied” with the word “resides” does not resolve this am-
biguity. . . . Viewed narrowly, an owl resides only in its nest; 
viewed more broadly, an owl resides in a PAC; and viewed 
more broadly still, an owl resides in its territory or home range. 
Determining whether a species uses an area with sufficient 
regularity that it is “occupied” is a highly contextual and fact-
dependent inquiry. . . . Such factual questions are   within the 
purview of the agency’s unique expertise and are entitled to 
the standard deference afforded such agency determinations.

 Judge Betty B. Fletcher 
 Litigation History 
 In 1993 the Mexican Spotted Owl was listed as a threatened 
species under the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”). The list-
ing decision prompted a series of lawsuits alternately seeking 
to compel the FWS [U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service] to designate 
critical habitat for the owl and, following the FWS’s designa-
tion of habitat, attacking that designation.  
 
The first such lawsuit was in 1995 to compel the FWS to 
designate critical habitat and resulted in the FWS’s issuing a 
final rule designating 4.6 million acres of critical owl  habitat, a 
designation that was quickly challenged in court and then 
 revoked in 1998. After another lawsuit was filed to compel the 
FWS to designate habitat, the FWS proposed a rule in 2000 to 
designate 13.5 million acres of critical habitat and in 2001 the 
agency promulgated a final rule that again designated 4.6 mil-
lion acres. That rule was later struck down and . . . the FWS 
reopened the comment period on the rule it proposed in 2000. 
In 2004 the FWS designated  approximately 8.6 million acres of 
critical habitat. It is this designation, the 2004 Final Rule, that 
Arizona Cattle challenges in the current action.  
 
Arizona Cattle moved for summary judgment to set aside 
the 2004 Final Rule. . . . The District Court rejected Arizona 
Cattle’s arguments. . . .  
 THE 2004 FINAL RULE 
 The FWS relied on three types of habitat management areas . . . 
as a starting point for the 2004 Final Rule: protected areas, re-
stricted areas, and other forest and woodland types. Protected 
areas are those areas containing known owl sites, termed Pro-
tected Activity Centers (“PACs”); “steep slope” areas meeting 
certain forest conditions; and legally and administratively re-
served lands. “PACs include a minimum of 600 acres . . . that in-
cludes the best nesting and roosting (i.e., resting) habitat in the 
area . . . and the most proximal and highly used foraging areas.” 
However, PACs contain only 75% of necessary foraging areas 
for the owl. Restricted areas include non-steep slope areas with 
appropriate forest conditions that are “adjacent to or outside of 
protected areas.” “Areas outside of PACs, including restricted 
areas, provide additional habitat appropriate for foraging.” . . .

 THE ESA AND THE DEFINITION OF “OCCUPIED”

be present during any reasonable span of time. This inter-
pretation is sensible. . . . Arizona Cattle’s “reside in” inter-
pretation       would make little sense as applied to nonterritorial, 
mobile, or migratory animals-including the owl-for which it 
may be impossible to fix a determinate area in which the 
animal “resides.” Such a narrow interpretation also would 
mesh poorly with the FWS’s authority to act in the face of 
uncertainty.  
 * * * * * 
 
It is possible for the FWS to go too far. Most obvious is that 
the agency may not determine that areas unused by owls are 
occupied merely because those areas are suitable for future 
occupancy. Such a position would ignore the ESA’s distinction 
between occupied and unoccupied areas. . . . The fact that a 
member of the species is not present in an area at a given in-
stant does not mean the area is suitable only for future occu-
pancy if the species regularly uses the area.  
 
Having thus framed the inquiry, we turn to the primary is-
sue before the court: whether the FWS included unoccupied 
areas in its critical habitat designation.  
 THE FWS DID NOT DESIGNATE UNOCCUPIED 
AREAS AS CRITICAL HABITAT  
 * * * * * 
 
. . . PACs are explicitly defined with reference to frequent 
owl presence, and non-PAC protected areas and restricted 
areas are “devised around” and “adjacent to” PACs. More to 
the point, we note significant record support for owl occu-
pancy of these areas in the form of studies correlating the 
habitat characteristics of protected and restricted areas with 
owl presence.  
 
The agency did not stop there.  [Its] analysis proceeds, 
unit by unit, through the addition of areas to the critical 
habitat proposal on the basis of information about known 
owl locations. . . .  
 
A point of recurring significance to our analysis is that 
PACs reflect only known owl sites. Although the 2004 Final 
Rule identified 1,176 PACs, owl populations have been esti-
mated to be significantly greater than the maximum 2,352 
owls reflected by this number of PACs. . . . Efforts by the FWS 
to identify other evidence of owl presence when it is unable 
to fix the location of a PAC with certainty are, therefore, 
highly significant.  
   
Even more significant is the fact that the FWS excluded ar-
eas with evidence of few or no owls. . . . Finally, we note that . . . 
the FWS excluded the vast majority of critical habitat units that 
contained no PACs and refined the boundaries of the critical 
habitat units to exclude large areas that are distant from PACs.  
   
The FWS’s process for designating critical habitat gives us 
a strong foundation for our conclusion that the agency did not 
arbitrarily and capriciously treat areas in which owls are not 
found as “occupied.” . . .  
 THE AMOUNT OF LAND DESIGNATED IS NOT 
DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE NUMBER OF OWLS  
  Arizona Cattle also argues that even using the owl’s substan-
tially larger home       range as the appropriate measure for the 
territory occupied by the owl, the FWS has designated a 
grossly disproportionate amount of land compared to the 
amount the owl occupies. It ties this argument to a seemingly 
simple calculation: multiplying the 1,176 PACs by the maximum 
estimated home range size of the owl of 3,831 acres, the re-
sultant area is only approximately 4.5 million acres, in contrast 
to the 8.6 million acres designated. This calculation, however, 
rests on a faulty assumption that the PACs represent all extant 
owls. We have already explained that PACs reflect only known 
owl sites and that there is record support for the existence of 
substantially greater numbers of owls and undiscovered sites. 
 . . . Arizona Cattle’s argument does not overcome the strong 
evidence that the FWS was focused on designating areas oc-
cupied by owls.

 Endangered Species Act 
 The combination of the  Cook Inlet Beluga Whale and  Arizona Cattle Grower’s Ass’n deci-
sions illustrate how complicated and time-consuming the legal process is for the protection 
of species. It is also costly—for citizen groups on both sides, for the government (and 
therefore all of us as taxpayers), for those whose lives and livelihoods may be substantially 
altered by the protections extended, and also for the species and our world in the event 
protections are not extended, if needed, or are not effective.  
 
Consider what may be on the horizon. The International Union for the Conservation of 
Nature has 4,224 species listed as critically endangered.66 The U.N. Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change indicates temperature increases this century could put 20 to 30 
percent of the world’s plants and animals in danger of extinction. 67 From 2008 through 
2011, environmental groups requested more than 1,230 species be listed  under the ESA 
as threatened or endangered, compared with prior annual averages of about 20 species. 
This forced the FWS, in its 2012 budget request, to point out that it had neither the person-
nel nor budget to meet the time constraints for final listing decisions required by law.68 
These facts set the context for a 2011 settlement with two environmental groups in which 
the FWS pledged to make listing determinations on all backlogged species by 2018. When 
the backlog is addressed, then 550 other potential candidates will be evaluated. The ulti-
mate result may be that the endangered list could increase by as much as 60 percent.69 
From 2010 to present, 198 species have been newly listed as either threatened or endan-
gered, compared to a total of 27 in the prior four years.70  [For photos of some endangered 
or threatened species in the United States, see   www.nytimes.com/ interactive/2013/03/06

 Part Four—Common Law Remedies 
 Most of the remedies discussed in Part Three are based on  statutory  claims. But long be-
fore federal or state governments became actively involved in environmental issues, courts 
were grappling with the problem and fashioning   common law   remedies. As early as the 
1500s, city officials were ordered by a court to keep the streets clean of dung deposited by 
swine allowed to run loose; the air was said to be “corrupted and infected” by this practice. 
Legal arguments have typically revolved around the extent of a person’s right to use and 
enjoy private property if such usage causes harm to a neighbor’s property or the use of 
public property. More recently, tort actions of negligence and strict liability have been 
pursued by injured individuals. Successful plaintiffs may recover monetary damages for 
the harm suffered or obtain an injunction to prevent similar conduct (and therefore harm) 
by the defendant in the future, or both.  
 Nuisance  A private nuisance is a substantial and unreasonable invasion of the private 
use and enjoyment of one’s land; a public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a 
right common to the public. Harmful conduct may be both a public and private nuisance 
simultaneously; the case law distinctions between the two are often blurred. A classic nui-
sance dispute is the 1970 New York case  Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co. 71 Neighboring

landowners sued the operator of a cement plant for injury to their properties from the 
plant’s dirt, smoke, and vibration. The court recognized the wrong done and ordered the 
operator to pay damages. 
 
In the last decade, a number of nuisance cases were initiated in federal courts against 
emitters of significant greenhouse gases. In one,  Connecticut v. American Electric Power 
Co. , several states, New York City, and three land trusts sued operators of coal-fired power 
plants claiming their carbon emissions were a nuisance under federal common law and 
seeking an order requiring the utilities to cap and then reduce their carbon dioxide emis-
sions. A unanimous Supreme Court ruled against the plaintiffs in 2011 finding that the 
Clean Air Act and EPA rule making authority displaced any common law right to sue to 
curb carbon dioxide emissions from power plants. 72 The  decision affirms the power of the 
EPA under the CAA and encourages a single nationwide standard for addressing carbon 
emissions rather than multiple court-imposed remedies. According to some commentators, 
it may also foreclose the use of the common law cause of action of nuisance for many other 
environmental harms under federal law. Some further believe it may prevent success under 
state law based on arguments that, where federal law exists, federal environmental laws 
preempt state law causes of action. 
 Trespass  A trespass occurs and liability is imposed on any intentional invasion of an in-
dividual’s right to the exclusive use of his or her own property. For example, in a 1959 
Oregon case,  Martin v. Reynolds Metals Co. , the plaintiffs successfully sued in trespass for 
damages caused by the operation of an aluminum reduction plant, which caused certain 
fluoride compounds in the form of gases and particulates to become airborne, settle on the 
plaintiffs’ land, contaminate their forage and water, and poison their cattle.  73 
 Negligence  The elements of negligence have been previously discussed in Chapter 7. In 
2010, the Florida Supreme Court held that fishermen were entitled to recover for the 
 damages they suffered when defendants’ wastewater storage pond spilled into the Tampa 
Bay, killing fish, crabs, and other marine life. Defendants’ negligence “interfered with the 
special interest of the commercial fishermen to use the public waters to earn their liveli-
hood.” 74 Particularly troubling causation issues can and have arisen in negligence cases 
based on environmental pollution, such as when a plaintiff claims injury from a toxic sub-
stance manufactured or otherwise supplied by a defendant. Recall the discussion of causa-
tion at the start of this chapter, as well as the factual basis for the movies Erin Brockovich 
and A Class Action. Think of the factual difficulties of proving that a particular substance 
causes certain medical conditions, that it was the cause of a particular individual’s injury, 
and that the substance is traceable back to a particular defendant. An organic compound, 
MTBE, is used around the world as an additive to gas. However, at least half of U.S. states 
have banned its use, and the EPA has classified it as a possible human carcinogen. Many 
lawsuits have been brought against oil companies by municipalities and other governmen-
tal bodies to recoup the costs of cleaning up water supplies contaminated with MTBE. 
New Hampshire brought such a suit against 16 oil companies, all of which except 
 ExxonMobil settled with the state for a total of $136 million. In April 2013, a jury returned 
a verdict for the state finding Exxon negligent for putting the additive in its gas and with-
out warning the state of its risks. Exxon is appealing.75

 Strict Liability  Certain activities, such as the use of toxic chemicals, may be seen as so 
abnormally dangerous as to give rise to a strict liability claim (previously discussed in 
Chapter 7). In an environmental law context, strict liability has been considered where 
crop dusting contaminated adjacent properties, 76 toxic chemicals were improperly dis-
posed of,  77 and oil contaminated a nearby water well. 78 
 
Several of the above claims can sometimes be triggered by the same set of facts. In a 
2007 West Virginia case, a jury found DuPont negligent in its use of a 112-acre site that 
for 90 years had been a zinc-smelting plant. The jury also found DuPont had created both 
a public and a private nuisance, had committed trespass, and should be held strictly liable 
for exposing local residents to various toxic substances. Residents and property owners 
had sued, claiming that the company had deliberately dumped toxic heavy metals, particu-
larly zinc, on the site. The medical problems caused by such toxins include cancer, damage 
to internal organs, and decreased fertility.  79 
 Part Five—Global Climate Change 
 Global climate change has been described as “among the handful of most important public 
policy issues of our time, 80 “one of the greatest challenges the world faces,” 81 and the 
“greatest market failure the world has ever seen.”82 At issue is the projected overall increase 
in surface and ocean temperatures around the globe, substantially caused by the release into 
the atmosphere of manmade carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, largely through the 
burning of fossil fuels, especially in gasoline engines and coal-fired plants.  
 
Both the politics and the science of global climate change have been controversial—a 
particularly potent and poignant example of the issues of coincidence, correlation, and 
causation discussed at the beginning of Part Two. The fifth assessment report of the Inter-
governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will be complete in October 2014. The 
first part, on the physical science basis for climate change, states that it is “extremely likely 
that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-
20th century” and that human influence “has been detected in warming of the atmosphere 
and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global 
mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes.” In the report’s terminology, 
“extremely likely” refers to a probability of 95 to 100 percent.83 Also apparent from the 
report is that, from 1998 to 2012, global average surface temperatures have not appreciably 
risen (despite significant global GHG emissions). Some commentators have recommended 
a hiatus in the implementation of emission reduction policies while we “see if the non-
warming trend continues.” 84 Others have pointed out that the “current pause is consistent 
with numerous prior pauses” and that “it is a mistake to interpret a landing as the end of the 
climb.” 85 [The first part of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report can be found at www.ipcc.

sessment Report when complete, can be found at www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/

Scholar and activist Bill McKibben has argued that we no longer live on the same 
planet on which our parents grew up, and that climate change has passed the tipping point. 

Chapter Seventeen  Environmental Protection  769
“The planet we inhabit has a finite number of huge physical features. Virtually all of them 
seem to be changing rapidly.”  86 Consider the following: 
• On September 16, 2012, the Arctic ice sheet shrank to a record low—half of what it was 
in 1979. The sheet is getting thinner as well—a quarter of what it was in 1979.87 Gla-
ciers in the Alps, the Andes, the Rocky Mountains, and New 
 Zealand are melting. The ice on the Tibetan plateau and its sur-
rounding mountains, including the Himalayas, is the source of 10 
major rivers, and 1.5 billion people live in the basins of those rivers. 
Less researched than the Earth’s poles, in 2009, scientists in China, 
the United States, and Germany began a long-term program called the Third Pole Envi-
ronment to study the area. Its initial findings are that glaciers in the eastern Himalayas 
and the eastern Tibetan plateau are retreating fast.88 [For an award-winning 2012 
Sundance Film Festival documentary recording receding glaciers throughout the world 
using time-lapse photography, see www.chasingice.com] 
 • “The oceans, which cover three-fourths of the Earth’s surface, are distinctly more acid and 
their level is rising; they are also warmer, which means the greatest storms on our planet, 
hurricanes and cyclones, have become more powerful.” 89 Acidification of the oceans weak-
ens shells, which means fewer shelled organisms. It may also endanger such commercially 
important species as marlin, mackerel, and tuna.90 The lowest country in the world, the is-
land nation of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, is creating a reserve fund to allow the 
population to resettle in Sri Lanka, India, or Australia in the event they lose their homelands 
to the sea.  91 In early 2012, the island states of Palau and Grenada requested that the UN 
General Assembly seek an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice “on the 
responsibilities of States under international law to ensure that activities carried out under 
their jurisdiction or control that emit greenhouse gases do not damage other States.”92
  •   Deliberate burning of forests in the Amazon and Indonesia reduces the world’s carbon sink 
capacity, as well as releasing previously captured carbon into the atmosphere. Deforestation 
in Indonesia is substantially related to its production of palm oil for export—to be used as 
biodiesel fuel in European vehicles. Forests are natural carbon sinks, but some may be near 
their carbon saturation point. It may take a binding agreement on forest management for 
European forests to continue offsetting carbon emissions from other sources. Better forest 
management may also be necessary to offset the impact worldwide from such natural, but 
increasing, devastation from beetles (western U.S. and British Columbia), drought (Colora-
do’s aspens and the Amazon), heat (South Africa’s euphorbia trees, Algeria’s cedars, and 
Australia’s eucalyptus), and fires (Siberia and Southwest United States).93  
 The Kyoto Protocol 
 In 1997 the governments of the world, realizing that global action would be required to have 
any significant impact on overall emissions, adopted the Kyoto Protocol. Specifically, the 
protocol called for a 5 percent reduction from 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions to be 
achieved by 2012. The protocol acknowledged that developed countries were principally re-
sponsible for the GHG levels at that time. These countries agreed to legally binding emission 
reductions; developing countries did not take on binding reductions and were allowed to grow 
On September 16, 2012, the 
Arctic ice sheet shrank to half 
of what it was in 1979.

770  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
consistent with their development needs. It became binding when ratified by 180 countries, on 
Russia’s ratification in late 2004. The United States never ratified the protocol.  
   
In achieving its fundamental objective, the protocol has been a complete failure. In 1990, 
approximately 31 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents were emitted globally; 
by 2010 that number had risen to roughly 50 million metric tons.94 China is now the largest 
GHG emitter, and the United States is the only developed country in the list of top four emit-
ters. India and Russia are in third and fourth place, respectively. The EU, however, has met 
and surpassed its goal under the protocol and is on track to reach its further goal of a 20 per-
cent reduction over 1990 by 2020. In contrast, emissions from the United States were 8 per-
cent higher in 2012 than in 1990. The Obama administration set a national goal, independently 
of Kyoto, to reduce emissions 17 percent over 2005 by 2020. Achieving that goal would 
amount to an approximately 3.4 percent reduction over our 1990 emissions.95  
 
The Kyoto Protocol was recognized from the start as only the first step in the develop-
ment of a global emission reduction program to stabilize greenhouse gases. Formal discus-
sions for a post-Kyoto international framework began in Bali, Indonesia, in December 
2007. They were expected to last through 2009.  Despite annual climate conferences under 
the auspices of the UN, as of this writing there is still no post-Kyoto agreement. Techni-
cally, the Kyoto Protocol was extended to 2017 by the EU’s agreement to undertake a 
second round of emissions reductions, but it in fact agreed to no more than it is already 
legally required to do under EU law. In return, 194 countries have agreed to agree by 2015 
on how to reduce GHG through commitments from developing, as well as developed, 
countries. The stated goal of Kyoto to keep climate change below a 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit 
increase seems further off than ever. On the table for the new agreement will likely be 
consideration of “loss and damage” from climate change, as well as mitigation and adapta-
tion. The new agreement is to take effect in 2020.96
 
Giving the last word to science, we go back to the first part of the IPCC’s Fifth Assess-
ment Report, the part that addresses the physical science basis for climate change. In the 
September 2013 report, for the first time, the participating scientists endorsed an upper 
limit of carbon dioxide that can be produced if the 3.6 degree increase is to be avoided: no 
more than 1 trillion metric tons. According to one of the report’s authors, “Just over a half-
trillion tons have already been burned since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and 
at the rate energy consumption is growing, the trillionth ton will be burned sometime 
around 2040.”97 The full report will be out by October 2014, including its recommenda-
tions for mitigation. Perhaps politics will take notice.
 Although the United States has not been a party to the 
Kyoto Protocol, many U.S. multinationals will be subject to 
its provisions because they do business in ratifying coun-
tries. Other U.S. businesses have chosen to voluntarily 
adopt emission reduction strategies.  
 Question 
 Imagine that you are a vice president of a corporation that 
burns significant fossil fuels in the production process but 
operates solely in the United States. What stance would 
you take on global climate change? Why?

 One indication of how much global climate change has become a grassroots issue in 
the United States is the entry of carbon footprint considerations into everyday conver-
sation. A carbon footprint is a measurement of how much carbon dioxide is emitted 
into the atmosphere as the result of a particular product, activity, or lifestyle. It is a way 
to measure the carbon “cost” of a particular activity or the carbon “savings” of changing 
that activity.

  1. Economist B. Peter Pashigian: 
 It is widely thought that environmental controls are guided by the public-spirited ideal 
of correcting for “negative externalities”—the pollution costs that spill over from private 
operations. This view is not wrong by any means. But it is suspiciously incomplete.  
 After all, there are numerous studies of regulatory programs in other fields that show 
how private interests have used public powers for their own enrichment.  98 
 
 In addition to correcting negative externalities, what forces might be influencing federal 
pollution control?  
  2. How might the government’s ever-increasing environmental regulations, along with 
the public’s call for a new environmental consciousness, favor big business interests 
over those of small business owners? 
  3. “The Aral Sea is going, gone. Once the world’s fourth largest inland body of water, the 
Aral has shriveled to half its former area and a third of its volume. As for the region’s 
drinking water, even the local vodka has a salty tang.” 99 The Aral is the victim of the 
former Soviet Union’s central planners, who decreed that the area would be the na-
tion’s main source of cotton. To achieve that goal, intense irrigation was required, with 
the result that only a trickle of fresh water was left to feed the Aral. Refilling the Aral 
would require tremendous dislocations in the agriculture of the vast region. If you 
were a member of a commission charged with developing a plan for the future of the 
Aral Sea, what issues would you cover? 
  4. Professor and business ethics scholar Norman Bowie: 
 Environmentalists frequently argue that business has special obligations to protect the 
environment. Although I agree with the environmentalists on this point, I do not agree 
with them as to where the obligations lie. Business does not have an obligation to pro-
tect the environment over and above what is required by law; however, business does 
have a moral obligation to avoid intervening in the political arena in order to defeat or 
weaken environmental legislation.  100 
 a. Explain Professor Bowie’s reasoning. 
 b. Do you agree with him? Explain.

water and pays nothing, although it only ranks seventh in contribution to the gross national 
product. . . . Less than half of the capital’s wastewater is treated. The rest sinks into under-
ground lakes or flows toward the Gulf of Mexico, turning rivers into sewers. . . . Well over 
half of irrigation water is lost to evaporation or seepage. 101  
 
  Brainstorm as many possible contributions to the solution of Mexico’s water problem 
as you can. 
  6. Because of the spread of the West Nile virus in the state of New York, an insecticide spray-
ing program was implemented to control the mosquitoes responsible for spreading the 
 virus. Several groups sued, arguing that the spray was a pollutant that damaged waters in 
violation of the Clean Water Act. What criteria should the court use to decide the out-
come? See  No Spray Coalition, Inc. v. The City of New York , 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 
13919, 51 ERC (BNA) 1508 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).  
  7. Ott Chemical Co. polluted the ground at its Michigan plant. CPC International created 
a wholly owned subsidiary to buy Ott, which was accomplished in 1965. CPC retained 
the original Ott managers. Pollution continued through 1972 when CPC sold Ott. In 
1981 the U.S. EPA began a cleanup of the site. To recover some of the tens of millions 
in cleanup costs, the EPA sued CPC (called Bestfoods) among other potentially 
 responsible parties. The Superfund law places responsibility on anyone who “owned 
or operated” a property when pollution was deposited. The district court held that CPC 
was liable because of its active participation in Ott’s business and its control of Ott’s 
decisions in that it selected the Ott board of directors and placed some CPC managers 
as executives at Ott. 
 a. Do you think CPC should be held liable? Why or why not? 
 b.   What test would you employ to determine whether a parent corporation should be 
 liable for a subsidiary’s pollution? See  United States v. Bestfoods , 524 U.S. 51 (1998). 
  8. William Tucker: 
 [Environmentalism is] essentially aristocratic in its roots and derives from the land and 
nature-based ethic that has been championed by upper classes throughout history. Large 
landowners and titled aristocracies . . . have usually held a set of ideals that stresses 
“stewardship” and the husbanding of existing resources over exploration and discovery. 
This view favors handicrafts over mass production and the inheritance ethic over the 
business ethic.  102 
 
  Tucker went on to argue that environmentalism favors the economic and social inter-
ests of the well-off. He said people of the upper middle class see their future in univer-
sities and the government bureaucracy, with little economic stake in industrial 
expansion. Indeed, such expansion might threaten their suburban property values. 
Comment.  
 9.  Americans’ commitment to the car obviously raises serious environmental problems. The 
vast spaces required to park those cars are themselves a significant environmental hazard. 
Explain some of the environmental problems created or encouraged by parking lots.  
 10. The Endangered Species Act provides that all federal agency actions are to be de-
signed so that they do not jeopardize endangered or threatened species. The act had 
been interpreted to reach federal agency work or funding in foreign countries, but 
772  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations

the federal government changed that interpretation in 1986 to limit the act’s reach 
to the United States and the high seas. A group labeled Defenders of Wildlife filed 
suit, seeking to reinstate the original interpretation. The case reached the U.S. 
 Supreme Court, where Justice Scalia wrote that Defenders of Wildlife would have 
to submit evidence showing that at least one of its members would be “directly” 
affected by the interpretation. In response, one member of Defenders of Wildlife 
wrote that she had visited Egypt and observed the endangered Nile crocodile and 
hoped to return to do so again but feared that U.S. aid for the Aswan High Dam 
would harm the crocodiles.  
 
  Do you think Defenders of Wildlife should have been permitted to sue? Why or why 
not? See   Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , 112 S.Ct. 2130 (1992).  
 11. Economist Robert Crandall: 
 [O]ur best chances for regulatory reform in certain environmental areas, particularly in 
air pollution policy, come from the states. Probably, responsibility for environmental 
regulation belongs with the states anyway, and most of it ought to be returned there.  103 
 a. What reasoning supports Crandall’s notion that responsibility for environmental 
regulation belongs with the states? 
 b. How might one reason to the contrary? 
 c. If the power were yours, would environmental regulation rest primarily at the state, 
federal, or international level? Explain. 
  12.   The United States seems to be quite enamored with sport utility vehicles (SUVs), 
in spite of the fact that their gas mileage is considerably poorer than most sedans. 
To graphically bring home the environmental irresponsibility of SUV owners, two 
men in the San Francisco Bay area dreamed up a scheme to address what they per-
ceived to be a market failure. Uninvited, they stuck homemade bumper stickers on 
hundreds of SUVs. The bumper stickers read, “I’m changing the environment! 
Ask me how!” 104

their actions? 
 b. What effect do you think they actually had? 
 13. Airplanes are a significant contributor to greenhouse gases. Comment on the following

If a person’s use exceeds the allowance, he will have to purchase “carbon points” from 
someone under their limit. 105

 Introduction: The Internet and Globalization
The Internet has changed our lives. Over 2.4 billion of the world’s 
7 billion inhabitants have Internet access.1 That number has been 
made possible, in part because of the relatively cheap access offered 
by cell phones in comparison with the cost of computers. The ex-
traordinary power of this nearly instantaneous global communica-
tion  system has produced remarkable new opportunities and challenges, creating and 
facilitating relationships (whole new “communities” of interest) among individuals, busi-
nesses, and governments that could never have occurred without it. The Internet is itself a 
catalyst for continuing globalization, breaking down national boundaries and rules to allow 
free interchange of communications, ideas, goods, and services around the world.
Over 2.4 billion of the world’s 
7 billion inhabitants have  
Internet access.

This global communication system raises yet another opportunity to consider such fun-
damental issues as what substantive law we want to govern the world’s Internet activities 
and what process we should use to establish global standards for this global medium. Con-
sensus is necessary on everything from the assignment of domain names  to when and what 
cyberattacks are allowable as weapons of war.2
 
The most interesting question raised by our now pervasive Internet relationships may be 
what process will evolve to determine and implement substantive laws governing the Inter-
net. Can national governments legitimately impose standards and sanctions? Will interna-
tional forums, such as the U.N. Internet Governance Forum, be necessary to resolve issues 
that have global ramifications? Will international bodies be able to act fast enough and 
have enough legitimacy to secure national acquiescence? Might international  enforcement 
tools need to be developed? Will grassroots use of the Internet among individuals, busi-
ness, and government drive the development of this new medium so vigorously that it will 
be a force driving a fundamental restructuring of our global relationships?
Part One—The Market, Law, and Ethics
The roots of the Internet date to the late 1960s when a small group of researchers sought a 
way to freely exchange digital information with colleagues at other institutions. By the end 
of the 1980s, a backbone system of networked computers had been created and e-mail use 
reached the general public. In the mid-1990s the first browser was released and the World 
Wide Web was born.3 Since then the cost of both technology and access has dropped suf-
ficiently to make the Internet a truly public, and international, space.
 
Policy makers, users, and posters are all concerned about the degree to which we can, 
need to, or will impose the force of law on the Internet. Originally, it was an open-access 
forum only lightly touched by regulation. The growth in users and 
uses, in needs and desires, has created arguably the most diverse 
community imaginable—nearly as diverse as the human race itself. 
The combination of volume and diversity brings conflict with it. 
Peaceful and dependable conflict solutions require the existence of 
an established dispute resolution mechanism. Some conflict is re-
solvable by developing norms of  conduct—such as e-mail and Internet etiquette. Some 
conflict is resolvable by the  establishment of site principles to be applied by a site admin-
istrator. But some conflicts will end up in courts because they are our established structural 
mechanism for peaceful dispute resolution.
 
To be accepted by the disputants, judicial decisions need to be based on shared principles. 
Likewise we have developed legislative processes for the creation of rules to govern behav-
ior. No existing judicial or legislative body, however, has  obvious or natural jurisdiction over 
the Internet in its entirety. “[T]herein lies the central truth of globalization  today: We’re all 
 connected and nobody is in charge.”4 
 
What choices do we have in this difficult situation? On one end of the spectrum, one might 
argue for the establishment and enforcement of globally applicable principles and processes. 
On the other end of the spectrum, one might predict complete balkanization with countries 
enforcing national standards by creating isolated domestic internets. As with most aspects of 
our globalized world, the more likely result will fall in the middle: global standards where 
The growth in users and uses 
... has created arguably the 
most diverse community 
imaginable.

Chapter Eighteen  Internet Law and Ethics  781
uniformity is critical to the functioning of the whole system, national regulation where funda-
mental cultural values and political choices vary and, perhaps, also the establishment of phys-
ically separate national internets, as Iran has proposed.5
Market Forces and Government Regulation
A discussion of regulating business conducted through the Internet must begin with the im-
pact the market has in developing (or, put another way, “regulating”) appropriate business 
behavior. For example, the photo- and video-sharing social network Instagram triggered a 
public outcry late in 2012 by announcing a change in its terms of use that would allow it to 
use posted photos for advertising purposes without specific permission of the poster and 
without providing a general opt-out mechanism. Within a day, the provision was removed.
 
In regulating the functioning of the Internet and its component parts, global norms are 
required. At present many norms, such as the assignment of top-level domain names 
(.com, .org, and so forth) and the system for routing digital traffic, are set by the United 
States. The European Union and Brazil in particular have argued matters of Internet gov-
ernance should be globalized, instead of continuing to rest with the United States. In 
April 2014, Brazil hosted a conference, In March 2014, the United States indicated a will-
ingness to relinquish its control over the Internet, and several international meetings are 
scheduled over the next few years to seek a consensus solution.6
 
One function of the Internet is as a mass communications system. Much like the tradi-
tional broadcast systems of radio and TV, the Internet can deliver the same content to an 
infinite number of users. Most, if not all, countries regulate content delivered by traditional 
broadcast  systems. This will likely continue to be true for content delivered through the 
Internet, as we will further discuss in Part Three.
 
The Internet also delivers private communications between particular users, much as a 
phone system. In general, Western governments do not censor private communications, 
but they do at times seek information from carriers about the existence of participants in 
private communications. Governments also seek access to the content of private communi-
cations sent through public networks as, for example, through phone wiretaps. In the digi-
tal world, the content of private communications can be stored for substantial lengths of 
time as data on the equipment of the service provider, making a much larger volume of 
such communications subject to government access. Again, market forces have little bear-
ing on government access to such information, although the political maelstrom raised by 
Edward Snowden’s disclosures about U.S. surveillance programs does seem likely to re-
sult in significant changes to some of the government’s practices. Such government access 
rules vary significantly among countries. Service providers subject to the jurisdiction of a 
particular country must comply with those rules, although at times a provider may elect not 
to do business in a particular country rather than subject itself to access demands with 
which it disagrees.
Internet Access
As we have seen in other areas, market forces and legal regulation will blend in some un-
certain, emerging formula to provide the security and confidence necessary for effective 
e-commerce. But ethics, too, will play a part. The speed, the traffic volume, the surface 

782  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
anonymity, and the global reach of the Internet suggest very difficult, and new, ethical is-
sues, as well as old problems in a new venue. We turn now to two access issues.
The Digital Divide
The divide in the United States is not just along economic lines, but also along race, age, and 
geographic lines. Seventy-six percent of white households are connected, but only 57 per-
cent of African-American households; 75 percent of those under 65 use the Internet, but 
only about 50 percent of those 65 and older; and the lowest Internet usage is in Mississippi, 
Alabama, and Arkansas. Although nearly 98 percent of American households are located 
where broadband is available, 20 percent of American adults are not connected—not at 
home, at work, through public access points such as libraries, or through a smartphone. 
Availability of service is not the problem; the cost of connecting and digital literacy are. But 
presumptions about availability exacerbate the disadvantages of the unconnected, as job an-
nouncements and applications, public school homework assignments, government services 
information and applications, among many other things, migrate to the web.7
 
An even greater access imbalance exists at the global level. For example, only 15.6 per-
cent of Africa’s citizens have access, compared with 78.6 percent in North America. 
Worldwide, it is estimated that just over one-third of the population is connected. But the 
number of connections is growing by less than 9 percent annually.8 As in the United States, 
one issue of access is availability, another is user cost, and another is training. But each of 
these issues is more intransigent outside of the United States. For example, only 24 percent 
of the population in sub-Saharan Africa has access to electricity. In most of these coun-
tries, the gross domestic product per capita is under $2,000. A group of seven well-known 
high-tech companies announced in 2013 the start of an Internet access project to address 
the two-thirds of the world’s population that is on the other side of the divide, but it is too 
early to tell if significant improvement will result.9 [For current statistics on world Internet 
usage, see www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm]
Questions
1. Can you think of any imaginative ways to provide widespread Internet access in devel-
oping countries? For one approach, watch the video at www.ted.com/talks/aleph_ 
molinari_let_s_bridge_the_digital_divide.html.
2. How would you deal with the reality that most Internet content is in English?
Net Neutrality
In general, if someone in the United States wishes to connect to the Internet, they contract 
with a commercial Internet service provider (ISP) (such as AT&T, Comcast, or Verizon) 
and pay a fee for the type (such as dial-up or broadband) and level of service (such as 
speed, data volume, and length of term) they desire. They then have access to any content 
provider (such as Amazon, Craigslist, Google, and YouTube). This uniform access is re-
ferred to as net neutrality. It implies that ISPs will not discriminate against the traffic of 
any legal content provider. Some ISPs would like the right to change that—for example, 
by charging certain content providers for access or for enhanced transmission speeds to the 
ISP’s subscribers. Their argument is that bandwidth is not infinite and they need to be able 
to manage traffic during periods of congestion to prevent performance degradation over 

Chapter Eighteen  Internet Law and Ethics  783
the entire system. Specifically, ISPs want to charge content providers with heavy traffic, 
such as sites where users download music and videos, for the substantial bandwidth used 
to access their sites, products, and services. The consequence of nonpayment would be ei-
ther blocked access at certain times or degraded speed at which access is provided.
 
Vigorous arguments have been raised against such fees, including:
• ISP subscribers already pay for the distribution system (and pay higher fees for various 
types and levels of service).
• Some ISPs compete with content providers (for example, cable companies provide content 
as well as access) and might discriminate either in price or speed to favor their own content. 
• Variable pricing might make it difficult for new content providers to succeed. (Amazon.
com had high-volume traffic long before it became profitable.)
 
In December 2010, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued new rules 
on net neutrality to address these issues. For wired broadband services, the rules prohibited 
blocking of “lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices” and compelled 
disclosure regarding network performance and the principles that would be used to manage 
network congestion. Wireless providers were subject to the same disclosure rules but were 
granted more leeway with regard to equal access. Blocking of consumer access to “lawful 
websites” and “applications that compete with the provider’s voice or video telephony 
services” was prohibited. Thus, AT&T would not be allowed to block or slow access to 
Skype, but would be allowed to block downloads from Netflix even while allowing access 
to an official AT&T video player. 
 
These regulations were challenged by Verizon; in mid-January 2014, the federal Court 
of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the FCC’s equal access rules were 
unsustainable, but the disclosure requirements were both severable and enforceable. The 
Court found that the FCC could impose antidiscrimination rules on broadband providers 
only if those providers were subject to common carrier regulation under the Telecommuni-
cations Act of 1996. After the passage of that Act, the FCC continued to classify broadband 
Internet service furnished over telephone lines as “telecommunications services” subject to 
common carrier regulation. Four years later, however, the FCC changed the classification 
and determined that broadband providers were instead “information services,” which, un-
der the Act, are not subject to common carrier regulation. The Court in Verizon v. FCC 
found that the antidiscrimination provisions were common carrier regulations and, thus, 
were not valid if broadband services were classified by the FCC as information services.10 
After announcing that it would not appeal the Court’s ruling, in the spring of 2014 the FCC 
issued proposed rules for public comment that opened the door to arrangements whereby 
content providers could pay for enhanced services. The FCC also invited comment on 
whether it should change the classification of broadband services so as to make them sub-
ject to regulation as common carriers.11
Questions
The issue of net neutrality raises the question of whether regulation is either appropriate or 
necessary to restrict unwanted behavior. Would you favor imposing the same rules on 
wired and wireless ISPs? If so, which approach would you prefer? The 2010 FCC rules for 
wired providers? The rules for wireless providers? The post-Verizon v. FCC position? Or 

784  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
would you prefer to leave it to the market to determine which ISPs will be successful? 
Explain your responses.
Part Two—Jurisdiction to Adjudicate
Business in the cyberworld raises puzzling new legal problems. The Internet, after all, is 
borderless. We can and do communicate and engage in transactions around the world. 
When a dispute arises from one of those billions of communications and transactions, where 
will that dispute be litigated? If an American website provides child pornography viewed by 
a resident of Germany, which nation will have the authority to prosecute the offense?12 If a 
Massachusetts resident posts an arguably libelous article on an Internet  bulletin board sited 
in New York, may the Texas resident who claims harm from the libel sue the author and the 
bulletin board host in a Texas court?13 These are jurisdictional  questions. The party filing 
suit must take its claim to a court that has both subject-matter jurisdiction (the authority to 
address the particular kind of legal problem raised) and  personal jurisdiction (the power to 
compel the defendant to respond). (For a general  discussion of jurisdiction, see Chapter 4.)
 
In the United States, where the plaintiff and defendant are both residents of the forum state, 
personal jurisdiction ordinarily is not an issue. However, personal jurisdiction over nonresi-
dents depends on the constitutional requirement of due process. In 
practice, the test is one of minimum contacts: Did the defendant have 
sufficient contact with the forum state that being sued there would be 
fair and just? Put another way, was the defendant’s contact with the 
forum state of such a nature that it should expect to be subject to the 
state’s courts? Thus, the more business a defendant does in a state, the 
more likely personal jurisdiction will be found. Internet business raises 
special problems because the “contacts” are often electronic and fleeting.
 
Several cases have arisen in the United States that begin to answer these personal jurisdic-
tion questions. In one the Fifth Circuit held in a case of alleged copyright violation that Texas 
did not have personal jurisdiction over a Vermont corporation merely because the corpora-
tion’s website was accessible from Texas.14 It reached this conclusion, in part, because there 
was no specific connection between the existence of the corporation’s website and the harm 
complained of by the plaintiff. Thus, the Vermont corporation could be sued in Texas only if 
it had contacts with Texas that were sufficiently “continuous and systematic” as to subject the 
corporation to suit in Texas generally. A passive website was insufficient to do this. When 
the  defendant has more contact with the forum state than the existence of a passive website 
 reachable by forum state computer users, the due process analysis becomes more complex 
and hinges on an evaluation of the defendant’s specific additional contacts with the state. The 
 existing decisions are often hard to reconcile and many cases have been reversed on appeal, 
indicating that judgments as to personal jurisdiction are challenging and uncertain.15
Question
The operator of the dating service be2.com sued the CEO of the competing dating service 
be2.net for trademark infringement. The suit was brought in a federal district court in Illi-
nois. Defendant was a New Jersey resident. The only evidence of his contact with Illinois 
Did the defendant have 
sufficient contact ... that 
being sued there would be 
fair and just?

Chapter Eighteen  Internet Law and Ethics  785
was a list of 20 Illinois members of be2.net. After the court granted a default judgment 
when the defendant did not respond to the complaint, defendant moved to vacate the judg-
ment for lack of personal jurisdiction.16 Should Illinois courts have jurisdiction? Explain.
Jurisdiction in International Suits
Similar jurisdictional issues arise across national boundaries. In 2010, an Italian court con-
victed three U.S.-based Google executives in absentia of violating Italian privacy laws 
based on a video posted by third parties on Google’s system. The video showed three teen-
age boys harassing an autistic boy. Italian law holds executives responsible for company 
actions.17 Google appealed and the decision was overturned. The appellate court found that 
Google had not performed an editorial function. Under EU law, mere hosting of user-
generated content does not make the hosting service responsible for the content.18
 
In international contexts it may be useful to distinguish among three types of jurisdic-
tion: jurisdiction to prescribe (legislate), jurisdiction to adjudicate (judicial personal juris-
diction), and jurisdiction to enforce.19 Most countries have long had 
laws that prohibit or regulate some forms of commerce, such as por-
nography, gambling, and alcohol. When a country seeks to apply 
those laws to foreigners, the question is whether the country has ju-
risdiction to adjudicate. The Restatement (Third) of Foreign Rela-
tions Law attempts to identify the circumstances under which 
countries have exercised their jurisdiction to adjudicate. It enumer-
ates, among other circumstances: (1) when a person is present in the 
territory, other than transitorily; (2) when a person is domiciled, a resident, or a national of 
that country; (3) when a person regularly carries on business in that country; (4) when a 
person has carried on an activity in the country and that activity is the subject of the dis-
pute; and (5) when a person has done something outside the country that has a “substantial, 
direct, and foreseeable effect within” the country and that effect forms the subject of the 
suit. Based on those standards, do you think the Italian courts have jurisdiction over Goog-
le’s American executives?
 
Consider both the French court’s approach and the U.S. district court’s approach to the 
issue of jurisdiction to adjudicate in the following dispute.
Most countries have long had 
laws that prohibit or regulate 
some forms of commerce, 
such as pornography, gam-
bling, and alcohol.

U.S. Services”), use the English language and target users 
who are residents of, utilize servers based in, and operate un-
der the laws of the United States. Yahoo! subsidiary corpora-
tions operate regional Yahoo! sites and services in 20 other 
nations, including, for example, Yahoo! France, Yahoo! India, 
and Yahoo! Spain. Each of these regional websites contains 
the host nation’s unique two-letter code as either a prefix or a 
suffix in its URL. Yahoo!’s regional sites use the local region’s 
primary language, target the local citizenry, and operate under 
local laws.
 
Yahoo! provides a variety of means by which people from 
all over the world can communicate and interact with one an-
other over the Internet. . . . As relevant here, Yahoo!’s auction 
site allows anyone to post an item for sale and solicit bids from 
any computer user from around the globe. Yahoo! records 
when a posting is made and after the requisite time period 
lapses sends an e-mail notification to the highest bidder and 
seller with their respective contact information. Yahoo! is 
never a party to a transaction, and the buyer and seller are 
responsible for arranging privately for payment and shipment 
of goods. Yahoo! monitors the transaction through limited 
regulation by prohibiting particular items from being sold 
(such as stolen goods, body parts, prescription and illegal 
drugs, weapons, and goods violating U.S. copyright laws or 
the Iranian and Cuban embargos). . . . Yahoo! informs auction 
sellers that they must comply with Yahoo!’s policies and may 
not offer items to buyers in jurisdictions in which the sale of 
such item violates the jurisdiction’s applicable laws. Yahoo! 
does not actively regulate the content of each posting, and in-
dividuals are able to post, and have in fact posted, highly of-
fensive matter, including Nazi-related propaganda and Third 
Reich memorabilia, on Yahoo!’s auction sites.
 
On or about April 5, 2000, LICRA sent a “cease and desist” 
letter to Yahoo!’s Santa Clara headquarters informing Yahoo! 
that the sale of Nazi and Third Reich–related goods through its 
auction services violates French law. LICRA threatened to 
take legal action unless Yahoo! took steps to prevent such 
sales within eight days. Defendants subsequently utilized the 
United States Marshal’s Office to serve Yahoo! with process in 
California and filed a civil complaint against Yahoo! in the Tri-
bunal de Grande Instance de Paris (the “French Court”).
 
The French Court found that approximately 1,000 Nazi and 
Third Reich–related objects, including Adolf Hitler’s Mein 
Kampf, The Protocol of the Elders of Zion (an infamous anti-
Semitic report produced by the Czarist secret police in the 
early 1900s), and purported “evidence” that the gas chambers 
of the Holocaust did not exist, were being offered for sale on 
Yahoo.com’s auction site. Because any French citizen is able 
to access these materials on Yahoo.com directly or through a 
link on Yahoo.fr, the French Court concluded that the Yahoo.
com auction site violates Section R645-1 of the French Crimi-
nal Code, which prohibits exhibition of Nazi propaganda and 
artifacts for sale. On May 20, 2000, the French Court entered 
an order requiring Yahoo! to (1) eliminate French citizens’ ac-
cess to any material on the Yahoo.com auction site that offers 
for sale any Nazi objects, relics, insignia, emblems, and flags; 
(2) eliminate French citizens’ access to Web pages on Yahoo.
com displaying text, extracts, or quotations from Mein Kampf 
and Protocol of the Elders of Zion; (3) post a warning to French 
citizens on Yahoo.fr that any search through Yahoo.com may 
lead to sites containing material prohibited by Section R645-1 
of the French Criminal Code, and that such viewing of the pro-
hibited material may result in legal action against the Internet 
user; (4) remove from all browser directories accessible in the 
French Republic index headings entitled “negationists” and 
from all hypertext links the equation of “negationists” under 
the heading “Holocaust.” The order subjects Yahoo! to a pen-
alty of 100,000 Euros for each day that it fails to comply with 
the order. . . .
 
The French Court also provided that penalties assessed 
against Yahoo! Inc. may not be collected from Yahoo! France. 
Defendants again utilized the United States Marshal’s Office 
to serve Yahoo! in California with the French Order.
 
Yahoo! subsequently posted the required warning and pro-
hibited postings in violation of Section R645-1 of the French 
Criminal Code from appearing on Yahoo.fr. Yahoo! also 
amended the auction policy of Yahoo.com to prohibit individu-
als from auctioning:
Any item that promotes, glorifies, or is directly associated 
with groups or individuals known principally for hateful or 
violent positions or acts, such as Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan. 
Official government-issue stamps and coins are not 
prohibited under this policy. Expressive media, such as 
books and films, may be subject to more permissive 
standards as determined by Yahoo! in its sole discretion.
Notwithstanding these actions, the Yahoo.com auction site 
still offers certain items for sale (such as stamps, coins, and a 
copy of Mein Kampf) which appear to violate the French 
 Order. . . .
 
Yahoo! claims that because it lacks the technology to 
block French citizens from accessing the Yahoo.com auction 
site to view materials which violate the French order or from 
accessing other Nazi-based content of websites on Yahoo.
com, it cannot comply with the French order without banning 
Nazi-related material from Yahoo.com altogether. Yahoo! con-
tends that such a ban would infringe impermissibly upon its 
rights under the First Amendment to the United States Consti-
tution. Accordingly, Yahoo! filed a complaint in this Court 
786  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations

seeking a declaratory judgment that the French Court’s orders 
are neither cognizable nor enforceable under the laws of the 
United States.
 
Defendants immediately moved to dismiss on the basis that 
this Court lacks personal jurisdiction over them. That motion 
was denied. . . .
II. OVERVIEW
As this Court and others have observed, the instant case pre-
sents novel and important issues arising from the global reach 
of the Internet. Indeed, the specific facts of this case implicate 
issues of policy, politics, and culture that are beyond the pur-
view of one nation’s judiciary. Thus it is critical that the Court 
define at the outset what is and is not at stake in the present 
proceeding.
 
This case is not about the moral acceptability of promoting 
the symbols or propaganda of Nazism. Most would agree that 
such acts are profoundly offensive. By any reasonable stand-
ard of morality, the Nazis were responsible for one of the 
worst displays of inhumanity in recorded history. . . .
 
Nor is this case about the right of France or any other na-
tion to determine its own law and social policies. A basic func-
tion of a sovereign state is to determine by law what forms of 
speech and conduct are acceptable within its borders. . . .
 
What is at issue here is whether it is consistent with the 
Constitution and laws of the United States for another nation 
to regulate speech by a United States resident within the 
United States on the basis that such speech can be ac-
cessed by Internet users in that nation. In a world in which 
ideas and information transcend borders and the Internet in 
particular renders the physical distance between speaker 
and audience virtually meaningless, the implications of this 
question go far beyond the facts of this case. The modern 
world is home to widely varied cultures with radically diver-
gent value systems. There is little doubt that Internet users in 
the United States routinely engage in speech that violates, 
for example, China’s laws against religious expression, the 
laws of various nations against advocacy of gender equality 
or homosexuality, or even the United Kingdom’s restrictions 
on freedom of the press.
* * * * *
 
The French order prohibits the sale or display of items 
based on their association with a particular political organiza-
tion and bans the display of websites based on the authors’ 
viewpoint with respect to the Holocaust and anti-Semitism. A 
United States court constitutionally could not make such an 
order. The First Amendment does not permit the government to 
engage in viewpoint-based regulation of speech absent a 
compelling governmental interest, such as averting a clear 
and present danger of imminent violence.
* * * * *
Comity
No legal judgment has any effect, of its own force, beyond the 
limits of the sovereignty from which its authority is derived. . . . 
The extent to which the United States, or any state, honors the 
judicial decrees of foreign nations is a matter of choice, gov-
erned by “the comity of nations.” United States courts gener-
ally recognize foreign judgments and decrees unless 
enforcement would be prejudicial or contrary to the country’s 
interests.
 
As discussed previously, the French order’s content and 
viewpoint-based regulation of the Web pages and auction site 
on Yahoo.com, while entitled to great deference as an articu-
lation of French law, clearly would be inconsistent with the 
First Amendment if mandated by a court in the United States. . . . 
The reason for limiting comity in this area is sound. “The pro-
tection to free speech and the press embodied in [the First] 
amendment would be seriously jeopardized by the entry of for-
eign judgments granted pursuant to standards deemed appro-
priate in [another country] but considered antithetical to the 
protections afforded the press by the U.S. Constitution.” 
 Absent a body of law that establishes international standards 
with respect to speech on the Internet and an appropriate 
treaty or legislation addressing enforcement of such stand-
ards to speech originating within the United States, the princi-
ple of comity is outweighed by the Court’s obligation to uphold 
the First Amendment.
* * * * *
CONCLUSION
Yahoo! seeks a declaration from this Court that the First 
Amendment precludes enforcement within the United States 
of a French order intended to regulate the content of its 
speech over the Internet. . . . Accordingly, the motion for sum-
mary judgment will be granted.
AFTERWORD
On appeal in 2006 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled by a 
vote of eight to three that the California district court had per-
sonal jurisdiction over the French defendants, but six judges 
also held that Yahoo! could not pursue its declaratory judg-
ment action. Three of those six said the declaratory judgment 
action was not “ripe” for decision, while the other three were 
the minority that held that the court had no personal jurisdic-
tion.20 The Supreme Court declined to review the decision.21

Questions
1. We cannot tell from this opinion why the French court 
 believed it had jurisdiction to adjudicate against Yahoo!, as 
opposed to Yahoo! France. Look back at the discussion of 
the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law immedi-
ately before this case. Why might the French court have 
had jurisdiction over Yahoo! France? Over Yahoo!?
2. If you were sitting on the Ninth Circuit, how would you have 
decided the jurisdiction question? Consider both the U.S. 
rule of minimum contacts and the Restatement provision.
3. Notice the Court’s conclusion that the principle of comity is 
outweighed by its constitutional obligation to uphold the free-
dom of speech. Is this approach to the requirements of com-
ity consistent with the discussion of comity in Chapter 16?
Part Three—Constitutional Law: Speech and Privacy
Speech
The district court opinion in Yahoo! v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme et L’Antisemitisme il-
lustrates one of the free speech issues the Internet raises. Internet content has also raised 
free speech issues here at home. The Internet’s seeming anonymity, ease of use, relatively 
low costs, and global reach make it a natural vehicle for transporting speech messages. As 
we saw in Chapter 5, the First Amendment protects us from government restraints on the 
content of speech, although reasonable restraints on the context (time, place, and manner) 
of that speech are sometimes constitutionally permissible. Thus, a court will not restrain 
free speech by enjoining someone from posting defamatory or copyrighted material, but 
the damaged party may, of course, sue for defamation or copyright infringement after the 
posting.22 [For articles on cyberlaw free speech, search for “free speech” at http:// 
repository.jmls.edu/jitpl/all-issues.html]
 
One of the most troublesome Internet free speech issues is whether and how children 
can be protected from online pornography while maintaining adult access to constitution-
ally protected content. In a 2007 survey, 34 percent of Internet users 
aged 10 to 17 experienced “unwanted exposure to online pornogra-
phy.”23 But Congress has been unsuccessful in its repeated attempts 
to enact constitutional legislation that would still effectively elimi-
nate access by minors. In 1997, the Supreme Court held critical pro-
visions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 were 
overbroad and therefore violated the First Amendment.24 Then in 
2007, a federal district court found the Child Online Protection Act 
of 1998 unconstitutional and permanently enjoined its enforcement. In refusing to hear the 
government’s appeal in 2009, the Supreme Court effectively left the permanent injunction 
in place.25
 
Somewhat more successfully, Congress has also addressed a slightly different prob-
lem—the exploitation of children in the making of child pornography and its online 
 accessibility to predators of children. Its first attempt was held unconstitutional by the 
Thirty-four percent of 
 Internet users aged 10 to 
17 experienced “unwanted 
exposure to online 
pornography.”

 Supreme Court,26 but in 2008 the Court upheld the PROTECT Act of 2003. Nevertheless, 
child pornography remains one of the Internet’s most intractable challenges, “too large for 
law enforcement, policy makers and child protection groups to handle on their own.”27 
(For more on child online protection, see Chapter 5.)
Anonymous Speech
“[An] author’s decision to remain anonymous, like other decisions concerning omissions 
or additions to the content of a publication, is an aspect of the freedom of speech protected 
by the First Amendment.”28
 
A unique characteristic of the Internet and electronic communication through the Internet 
is the ease with which a poster or sender can be anonymous and remain so without “fear of 
economic or official retaliation . . . [or] social ostracism.”29 Anonymity makes it more likely 
that individuals will feel free to say things about which they would otherwise keep silent. 
Thus, it can promote “the robust exchange of ideas.”30 Anonymity may, however, make indi-
viduals bolder about asserting untruths—misleading, fraudulent, or otherwise unprotected 
speech. For example, sites containing “revenge porn” have proliferated; these are sites on 
which ex-boyfriends, ex-husbands, and ex-lovers can post explicit photos of their former 
partners, at times along with disparaging remarks, information on where the women work 
and live, and links to their Facebook pages.
 
The victim of such a post can request the hosting site remove the material; indeed, hun-
dreds of thousands of content complaints (for many different reasons) are received by Fa-
cebook, Google, and Twitter each week.31 But it is largely up to the hosting site whether 
the content will actually be removed. Even if the offending material is removed from the 
originating site, there is a significant chance that it has been copied and could reappear in 
other locations at any time. The Communications Decency Act makes it very unlikely that 
the hosting website will be held liable for such postings, particularly if it removes the ma-
terial when requested to do so. The law rests liability on the “information content pro-
vider,” and courts have generally held that website owners are not content providers on 
these facts. Some lower courts seem willing to consider that some actions of a hosting 
website may result in liability—such as itself supplying responsive comments supportive 
of the original post or by naming the site in such a way as to encourage offensive, damag-
ing, or defamatory posts.32
 
With regard to the original poster, there is very little state law that would criminalize the 
posting of such material. Victims occasionally have brought civil suits for damages, depend-
ing on the facts based on harassment, invasion of privacy, copyright infringement, or child 
pornography claims. [For more on revenge porn, see www.endrevengeporn.com]
 
Before a victim of revenge porn or other forms of online harassment, defamation, and in-
vasion privacy can sue the content provider, the victim has to be able to prove who that is. 
Seeking the release of that information from the website or the ISP of the poster triggers First 
Amendment claims to anonymity on behalf of the original poster. In the case that follows, a 
Yahoo! poster argues the First Amendment prohibits Yahoo! from responding to a sub-
poena from Immunomedics, a corporation claiming the anonymous poster is or was an 
employee who violated the company’s confidentiality agreement by posting company in-
formation on a Yahoo! message board.

790  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
 
On or about October 20, 2000, Immunomedics served a 
subpoena on Yahoo!, seeking discovery of Moonshine’s true 
identity. Yahoo!, in turn, contacted Moonshine. In response, 
Moonshine filed a motion to quash the subpoena on or about 
November 15, 2000.
 
. . . After considering the arguments, the judge denied 
Moonshine’s motion, stating, in pertinent part,
We have two issues here. We have an issue, she’s an 
employee, she signed a confidential document saying that 
she was not going to speak freely about information she 
learned at the company. So she contracted away her right 
of free speech if she’s an employee. Number two, free 
speech, anonymous, but if it harms another individual, that 
is another way that we have a little bit of a dent in our rights 
for free speech.
* * * * *
 
Moonshine contends the motion judge erred in denying her 
motion to quash the subpoena, as anonymous speech is con-
stitutionally protected and Immunomedics’ complaint is insuf-
ficient to warrant a breach of that anonymity. Immunomedics 
argues that, while anonymous speech is constitutionally pro-
tected, that protection can be overcome if a defendant uses 
that freedom in an unlawful manner. . . .
 
In another case involving an application for expedited dis-
covery to disclose the identity of an anonymous user of an ISP 
message board, we concluded that courts must decide such 
applications by striking a balance between the First Amend-
ment right of an individual to speak anonymously and the right 
of a company to protect its proprietary interest in the pursuit of 
claims based on actionable conduct by the ISP message 
board user.
* * * * *
 
We hold that . . . the trial court should first require the 
plaintiff to undertake efforts to notify the anonymous posters 
that they are the subject of a subpoena or application for an 
order of disclosure, and withhold action to afford the ficti-
tiously named defendants a reasonable opportunity to file and 
serve opposition to the application. These notification efforts 
should include posting a message of notification of the identity 
discovery request to the anonymous user on the ISP’s perti-
nent message board.
 
The court shall also require the plaintiff to identify and set 
forth the exact statements purportedly made by each anony-
mous poster that plaintiff alleges constitute actionable speech.
Judge Fall
Defendant Jean Doe, a/k/a “moonshine_fr,” appeals from an 
order . . . denying her motion to quash a subpoena issued to 
Yahoo! by plaintiff, Immunomedics, Inc., seeking all personally 
identifiable information relating to the person or identity who 
posted messages on the Yahoo! Finance Message Board un-
der the identifier “moonshine_fr” which may identify or lead to 
the identification of that person or entity.
 
Immunomedics is a publicly held biopharmaceutical Dela-
ware corporation . . . focused on the development, manufac-
ture, and commercialization of diagnostic imaging and 
therapeutic products for the detection and treatment of can-
cer and infectious diseases.
 
Yahoo! is an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that maintains 
a Web site that includes a section called Yahoo! Finance. Ya-
hoo! Finance maintains a message board for every publicly 
traded company, including Immunomedics. Visitors to the Im-
munomedics site can obtain up-to-date information on the 
company, and can post and exchange messages about issues 
related to the operation or performance of the company.
 
On October 12, 2000, Immunomedics filed a complaint 
against Jean Doe, also known by the computer screen name 
“moonshine_fr” (“Moonshine”). The complaint alleged that 
Moonshine had “posted a message on Yahoo! Finance.” Im-
munomedics claimed that message contained information 
confidential and proprietary to Immunomedics. As a result, Im-
munomedics asserted it had sustained injury and that Moon-
shine should be held liable under theories of breach of 
contract, breach of duty of loyalty, and negligently revealing 
confidential and proprietary information.
* * * * *
 
Of the two messages in question, the first, with Moonshine 
describing herself as “[a] worried employee,” stated that 
 Immunomedics was “out of stock for diagnostic products in 
 Europe” and claimed that there would be “no more sales if [the] 
situation [did] not change.” The second message, allegedly 
posted by Moonshine after the initial complaint was filed, 
 reported that Chairman of the Company Dr. Goldenberg was 
 going to fire the Immunomedics “european manager.” In her 
 certification to the trial court, Immunomedics’ Executive Vice 
President and Chief Operations Officer Cynthia L. Sullivan admit-
ted that the statements were true, but that, as an employee, 
Moonshine had violated the company’s confidentiality agreement 
and “several provisions” of the company’s Employee Handbook.

775 A.2d 773 (N.J. Super. 2001)
L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E

 
The complaint and all information provided to the court 
should be carefully reviewed to determine whether plaintiff 
has set forth a prima facie cause of action against the ficti-
tiously named anonymous defendants. In addition to establish-
ing that its action can withstand a motion to dismiss for failure 
to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the plaintiff 
must produce sufficient evidence supporting each element of 
its cause of action, on a prima facie basis, prior to a court or-
dering the disclosure of the identity of the unnamed defendant.
 
Finally, assuming the court concludes that the plaintiff has 
presented a prima facie cause of action, the court must balance 
the defendant’s First Amendment right of anonymous free 
speech against the strength of the prima facie case presented 
and the necessity for the disclosure of the anonymous defend-
ant’s identity to allow the plaintiff to properly proceed.
 
The application of these procedures and standards must 
be undertaken and analyzed on a case-by-case basis. The 
guiding principle is a result based on a meaningful analysis 
and a proper balancing of the equities and rights at issue.
 
. . . Here, Immunomedics’ cause of action is based on 
Moonshine’s status as an employee and her alleged violation 
of a confidentiality agreement, and Moonshine’s alleged 
breach of her common law duty of loyalty. . . .
 
Applying the procedure and test outlined, we conclude 
Judge Zucker-Zarett properly analyzed the disclosure issue, 
and we affirm substantially for the reasons articulated by the 
judge in her oral opinion. . . . We add the following. Immuno-
medics presented sufficient evidence that Moonshine is, or 
was, an employee of Immunomedics. Ms. Sullivan indicated in 
her certification that “all employees are bound by several 
Company policies and a confidentiality agreement.” Within its 
“Confidentiality and Assignment Agreement,” Immunomedics 
includes the following language:
This Agreement and any disputes arising under or in 
connection with it shall be governed by the laws of the 
State of New Jersey and each of the parties hereto hereby 
submits to the jurisdiction of any Federal or state court 
sitting in the State of New Jersey over any such dispute.
 
Accordingly, Immunomedics clearly established a prima fa-
cie cause of action for breach of the confidentiality agreement 
founded on the content of Moonshine’s posted messages.
 
In balancing Moonshine’s right of anonymous free speech 
against the strength of the prima facie case presented and the 
necessity for disclosure, it is clear that the motion judge struck 
the proper balance in favor of identity disclosure. With evi-
dence demonstrating Moonshine is an employee of Immuno-
medics, that employees execute confidentiality agreements, 
and the content of Moonshine’s posted messages providing 
evidence of the breach thereof, the disclosure of Moonshine’s 
identity, which can be reasonably calculated to be achieved 
by information obtained from the subpoena, was fully war-
ranted. Although anonymous speech on the Internet is pro-
tected, there must be an avenue for redress for those who are 
wronged. Individuals choosing to harm another or violate an 
agreement through speech on the Internet cannot hope to 
shield their identity and avoid punishment through invocation 
of the First Amendment.

Commercial Speech
Remember from Chapter 5 that commercial speech has been accorded reduced but signifi-
cant First Amendment protection. Thus, online advertising is subject to the same kinds of 
government oversight as that in print and on television. One form of online commercial 
message receiving special attention is so-called spam (mass e-mails). This electronic junk 
Chapter Eighteen  Internet Law and Ethics  791

792  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
mail may be a legitimate form of commercial message at times, but it may also be an an-
noyance or a threat to the efficiency of the Internet because of its volume. It may also be 
deceptive, or fraudulent, or contain objectionable content, such as obscenity or viruses. 
Globally, about 70 percent of all e-mail is spam.33
 
The federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 establishes both civil and criminal penalties for 
violations of its provisions. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), charged with enforcing 
the Act, won a substantial victory in 2008 when it obtained a court order freezing the assets 
of and shutting down a spam network that was capable of sending 10 billion e-mail mes-
sages a day and was responsible at one point for one-third of all spam. The group based its 
websites in China, processed credit cards payments through Cyprus and the former Soviet 
republic of Georgia, and in one month cleared $400,000 in credit card charges from sales 
of replica watches, as well as pharmaceuticals for weight loss and for the enhancement of 
the male anatomy.34 In 2013, a court in Moscow convicted two Russians of designing and 
controlling a botnet—a network of infected computers that can be harnessed to take coor-
dinated action, such as sending spam. Most hijacked infected computers are located in 
developing countries where users often cannot afford virus protection software. This par-
ticular botnet, known as Festi outside of Russia, for a three-month period in 2012 gener-
ated a third of all spam e-mail messages circulating globally.35 [To file a complaint with 
the FTC about spam you receive, go to https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov]
Privacy
Most individuals probably do not fully appreciate the amount of their personal information 
that is available online, how it may be used, or the degree to which it may be misused. This 
is likely still the case, even after the 2013 disclosures precipitated by Edward J. Snowden of 
the extent to which the National Security Administration has routinely collected data on 
U.S. citizens. Most of the outcry following Snowden’s disclosures addressed the legality of 
the government’s actions under the Fourth Amendment’s search and seizure restrictions and 
probable cause warrant requirements. Our focus here is different—this section looks at pri-
vacy concerns stemming from the way the Internet facilitates broad availability and acces-
sibility of users’ personal data, in ways that are often unintended and sometimes harmful.
 
The Internet has brought with it an explosion of accessible data, including personal data. 
Some of the information now available  online has in fact been public for decades, but most 
people were not aware that it was public, did not know how to obtain it, or simply never 
bothered, a reality sometimes referred to as “practical obscurity.”36 For example,  local gov-
ernments keep property, tax, criminal, and court records, often housed in the local court-
house but not easily searchable. Now local governments are making much of these data 
available online and accessible to those who are simply curious.37 Similarly, governmental 
agencies responsible for professional and occupational licensing may now have websites 
with membership lists, complaints filed, and disciplinary actions taken. Marketing firms, of 
course, have long collected all of this information and more, including home and work ad-
dresses, phone numbers, profession, income information, credit scores, bankruptcies, home 
ownership, mortgage amounts, vehicle and boat registrations, hunting licenses, bridal and 
birth registries, warranty cards, magazine and newspaper subscriptions, and even dog 

Chapter Eighteen  Internet Law and Ethics  793
 licenses. But maintaining current data was costly and the  resulting profiles were not avail-
able to the general public. With the advent of the Internet that has changed. At Criminal-
Searches.com, a site supported by advertising, anyone can look up neighbors, babysitters, 
teachers, plumbers, or their children’s friends for free, which the site encourages one to do. 
Many other sites will provide similar information for a fee to anyone willing to pay. How 
long will it be before jurors are tempted to look up the criminal record of the defendant?
 
A simple browser search can turn up much more information from the public pages of 
social media sites, both self-disclosed and posted by friends, family, and acquaintances. 
Consider the following information, which is readily available or which you yourself may 
be unwittingly providing:
• Satellite and street views of your home, your work, and your children’s school. Scout-
ing a location or stalking someone has never been easier.
• Candid pictures and videos of you and your family, while attending your daughter’s school 
Halloween party or at a business lunch or making a quick dash into your local convenience 
store or sitting at your MacBook surfing the Internet. Digital cameras are cheap, tiny, and 
potentially anywhere. Most cell phones come with built-in cameras. Several vendors sell 
miniature, high-definition Wi-Fi cameras for under $200, which one such company pro-
motes “with easy setup in 60 seconds” and “continuous cloud recording.” In early 2014, 
that company was uploading 1,000 hours of video per minute, 10 times the amount up-
loaded to YouTube.38 Then there’s Google Glass—a small computer worn on a person’s 
face, which connects wirelessly to a smartphone and can do much of what a cell phone can 
do, including take pictures and videos of persons without their knowledge or consent. Fi-
nally, we have learned that laptop webcams are susceptible to hacking. A paper by re-
searchers at Johns Hopkins explains how to reprogram a MacBook webcam to record 
without triggering the LED indicator that is supposed to alert the user that the camera is on. 
“There is only really one solution that can guarantee no one is spying on you: a piece of 
tape stuck over your computer camera.”39
• Facebook confessions of indiscretions or, worse, crimes that find their way into police 
reports, school and job application files, and credit evaluations, as well as Instagram 
pictures that show up in divorce and child custody proceedings. Social media is having a 
wider impact than most people imagine, and the legal system may be having a hard time 
keeping up. Lawyers are turning to blog posts and online profiles to 
evaluate potential jurors; jurors have been “caught tweeting during 
testimony, polling Facebook friends for input on the verdict,” and 
doing online research related to crimes with which the defendant has 
been charged. Some judges now require all electronic devices to be 
left outside the courtroom and, presumably, the jury room.40
Data Mining
Now consider the amount of information residing in the databases of institutions with 
whom we regularly deal: credit card companies, online vendors, membership organiza-
tions, schools, pharmacies, medical service providers, our ISPs, phone companies, and so 
Jurors have been caught 
tweeting during testimony, 
polling Facebook friends for 
input on the verdict.

forth. Data mining is the process of building profiles of individuals by organizing all the 
disparate pieces of information collected in the normal course of business. Those profiles 
can be used to provide better services to repeat customers—from the pizza outlet that 
knows what you ordered last time (and how often, as well as how much you spend and, 
possibly, whether you tip) to Netflix that knows all your historical downloads and rentals 
(and how you rated them), as well as everything listed in your queue, and from that infor-
mation can give you tailored recommendations for other movies you might like. Signifi-
cant efficiencies can be achieved from the use of mined data, but there are downsides as 
well.
 
Personalized responses can also permit price discrimination. An investigation by the 
Wall Street Journal discovered such “dynamic pricing” used by Staples.com—the same 
stapler offered for $14.29 and $15.79. From a sampling of visits from more than 42,000 zip 
codes, “statistically speaking, by far the strongest correlation involved the distance to a 
rival’s store from the center of a zip code.”41 That is, if the query came from a shopper 
close to a brick-and-mortar Office Depot or Office Max, the online price of the stapler was 
lower. This can replicate discrimination that mimics offline shopping: higher prices in lo-
cations with less competition, including rural and poor areas. Visit a comparison shopping 
site before going to your chosen vendor and the offered price may drop; “click too quickly 
from home-page to product page to checkout, and the seller can conclude that you have 
already decided to buy—so why offer you a discount?”42
 
Visit your favorite news or bookstore or streaming video site and you may get recom-
mendations based on your prior viewing history. A convenience? Perhaps. But it may also 
steer you away from news stories, books, and movies that don’t fit the profile labels the 
filtering algorithms have decided your online history reveals. If the algorithm concludes a 
user is likely to be a shopaholic or financially overextended, payday lender ads may start 
appearing on the screen. Not only are many users not aware of the extent of personaliza-
tion occurring, but even if they are, there is no process for correcting these hidden profiles 
that influence one’s online experience nor right to delete them. 
 
To achieve this degree of personalization, the data collected on users go significantly 
beyond an individual site mining the data provided while a user browses its site. Users of 
a site may also knowingly give the merchant personal information to complete their trans-
action. Amazon.com identifies the following as examples of information customers pro-
vide: “your name, address, and phone numbers; credit card information; people to whom 
purchases have been shipped, including addresses and phone number; … e-mail addresses 
of your friends and other people; … and financial information, including Social Security 
and driver’s license numbers.”43 Profiles built by one online vendor, including both brows-
ing history and user-provided information, may also be provided to or aggregated with in-
formation gathered by affiliated businesses or by third-party advertisers. Or the business 
that compiles the profiles may sell them to marketing firms and others.
Cross-Device Tracking
Instead of one vendor, consider for a moment the source of the user-specific data available 
to certain iconic Internet businesses, such as Facebook, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. 
When repeat customers use Staples’ website, they are likely to browse the site for desired 

Chapter Eighteen  Internet Law and Ethics  795
items and then proceed to checkout, entering their username and password to do so. When 
they have finished, they leave the site. Users of Facebook, on the other hand, log in and 
then are likely to have the program running for extended periods of time, using various 
apps, chatting with friends, and so on. Even when they go elsewhere on the Internet, they 
may “like” places they visit, connecting them back to their Facebook accounts. If the users 
also own a smartphone, they may also use it to access Facebook and have it running as 
they travel through their day. This allows Facebook to collect user-specific information 
across multiple devices (laptop, work computer, smartphone), from many other websites, 
over extended periods of time, and from many geographical locations. 
 
Google, Apple, and Microsoft can also do cross-device tracking—Google by connect-
ing its users through Google Plus, whether they are on its Chrome browser, Google search, 
gmail, Google maps, or its phones; Apple among its phones, its iPads, and laptops running 
its Safari browser, and its app stores; and Microsoft through its browsers, MSN, Hotmail, 
Outlook.com, Xbox, phones, and Bing. These companies are not only tracking across de-
vices, but also across many different platforms. 
 
All four of these companies can both develop extensive user profiles and reap substan-
tial advertising dollars by facilitating targeted third-party ads to users manifesting specific 
attributes.
Aggregators
In this user-information market, will anyone be able to compete with these Internet giants? 
So far the answer remains yes—aggregators can and do.
 
An aggregator in our context is any person who takes data that are discrete at the level 
of the individual and aggregates them with individual-level data from one or more other 
sources. By itself, a data file containing the browsing history of 200 discrete individuals 
(each person’s browsing history separately presented but with no information identifying 
whose history it is) may not seriously threaten the anonymity of those individuals. By com-
bining data from various sources, however, an aggregator creates even more detailed indi-
vidual profiles, thereby increasing the probability that the data reveal the identity of the 
person behind it.
 
Where does an aggregator obtain the data sets that it combines? One major source is to 
develop profiles of users’ Web browsing habits by placing cookies, tiny pieces of code, on 
thousands of websites to track users’ online movements. When a visitor to a site logs in, 
about 25 percent of the time the site passes along the user’s name, e-mail address, and 
other personal information to any third-party company with its own cookie on the page.44 
In a study conducted in 2012, 6,485 cookies were found on the 100 most popular web-
sites—a majority of which were placed by third-party trackers, not the websites them-
selves.45
 
Although cookies may work on mobile browsers, iPhone’s mobile Safari blocks all 
third-party cookies, and cookies do not attach at all to mobile apps. However, third-party 
aggregators successfully take advantage of so-called leaky apps that transmit identifiable 
user data, including locational data, as smartphones surf the Web, send e-mails and texts, 
and make calls. Apparently, both the U.K. and U.S. governments have been able to collect 
considerable data when smartphone users send posts to such popular services as Facebook, 
Flickr, LinkedIn, and Twitter.46

796  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
 
Of considerable concern is that no state or federal law prohibits the collection or sharing 
of most data by third parties, and independent aggregators have no privacy agreements 
with the individuals who are profiled and may have no agreement with the data source to 
restrict the use of the data. Aggregators generally are in the business of selling these data.
Privacy Policies: Did Someone Say Privacy?
These days an online merchant is likely to have a privacy policy posted on its site that de-
scribes, among other things, what data it collects and how they are used. For example, 
Amazon.com’s Privacy Notice states “Information about our customers is an important part 
of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others.”47 The information it 
automatically collects includes “login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection 
information such as browser type, version, and time-zone setting, browser plug-in types and 
versions, operating system, and platform; purchase history …; the full Uniform Resource 
Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our website, including date and time; 
cookie number; [and] products you viewed or searched for.” It also receives information 
such as “account information, purchase or redemption information, and page-view informa-
tion from some merchants with which we operate co-branded businesses.” A partial list of 
such businesses includes “Starbucks, OfficeMax, American Apparel, Verizon Wireless, 
Sprint, T-Mobile, AT&T, J&R Electronics, PacSun, Eddie Bauer and Northern Tool + 
Equipment.” The Notice further acknowledges that its site includes third-party advertising 
and links to other websites. It then states, “We do not have access to or control over cookies 
or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices 
of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by our Privacy Notice.”
 
Having read the materials in this section on data mining, pause and think now about the 
vast amount of personal data you now know is compiled and stored by various entities—
Internet vendors, social media sites, and aggregators, but also phone companies and such 
traditional institutions such as banks and employers. Now consider the ramifications of the 
fact that anything stored can likely be stolen. For example, Google is one of the strongest, 
most technically sophisticated Internet companies in the world, but even it cannot prevent 
covert cyberattacks on its systems. Neither can Facebook, Apple, Twitter, Yahoo!, 
LinkedIn, Bloomberg, the International Monetary Fund, the FBI or the Pentagon, all of 
which have acknowledged that their systems have suffered successful attacks. Indeed, the 
opening lines of a recent New York Times article were, “The question is no longer who has 
been hacked. It’s who hasn’t?”48
Question
How would you rate the privacy protections available to individuals who purchase items 
through Amazon.com? How safe are similar data of individuals who have never purchased 
an item through Amazon.com? 
Privacy of Employees
As discussed in Chapter 12, whether and when employers can legally access e-mails sent 
from or received on office computers continues to be uncertain. In a 2010 case, the New 
Jersey Supreme Court held that an employee had an expectation of privacy in an e-mail 

Chapter Eighteen  Internet Law and Ethics  797
sent from her office computer but through a personal, password-protected Web mail ac-
count, an expectation the employer violated when it forensically retrieved her e-mail off of 
office servers. The result might have been different if the employer’s privacy policy had 
clearly advised employees that their e-mails, even those sent through personal Web mail 
accounts, could be reviewed by the employer.49 On the other hand, a U.S. Supreme Court 
case held that a city’s review of a police officer’s text messages was a reasonable search 
under the Fourth Amendment when the texts were sent from a wireless pager provided to 
the  officer by the city, even if the officer had had a reasonable expectation of privacy.50
 
In recent years, a number of states have passed laws prohibiting employers from requir-
ing log-on information to employee social media accounts, such as Facebook and Twitter, 
as a condition for the employee to get or keep a job. Exceptions are provided if an em-
ployer has specific information about work-related employee misconduct occurring 
through the use of such accounts or an employee’s unauthorized publication of the em-
ployer’s proprietary information. 
 
Today’s software can be  customized to look for such things as company officers’ and 
competitors’ names, as well as inappropriate language. Software is also available today that 
can “track every keystroke, file download, and Internet page that appears on an employee’s 
computer screen.”51 It can also be customized to look for such things as company officers’ 
and competitors’ names, as well as inappropriate language in office e-mail traffic. In part, 
companies may adopt some of these strategies to protect themselves from lawsuits. Em-
ployers wishing to implement such monitoring programs should, however, expressly advise 
their employees of that fact and have all employees sign an acknowledgment so there is no 
question about whether an employee has any expectation of privacy on company systems.
Question
Explain why employers might want to monitor their employees’ computer activities.
Regulation
The United States has no comprehensive privacy law addressing the Internet environment. 
Instead, the privacy of users has largely been left to the “self-regulation” of service and 
content providers, buffered primarily only by periodic public outcries over, for example, a 
company’s unilateral change in its stated privacy policy and occasional civil suits based on 
existing legal principles, such as defamation.
 
Most online content is and has remained free to users, funded primarily by advertising 
dollars. To make that advertising more effective, and thus able to generate more revenue, 
advertisers and content providers have developed behavioral tracking to follow users’ 
paths through the Internet, thereby allowing ads targeted to users’ specific interests. In a 
very real sense, Google and Facebook and other advertising-driven business models sell 
their users’ data to pay for the services they give without charge to their users. “Self-regu-
lation” then puts users’ privacy protection into the very hands that derive substantial rev-
enue from the sale of personal information. This is an irreconcilable conflict of interest. 
Periodically, lawmakers have acted, but the resulting laws have largely addressed privacy 
issues in discrete areas, such as motor vehicle records, patient billing, or video rental 

798  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
 records. California law requires websites and apps to have privacy policies, and the FTC 
has taken action against companies that violate their stated privacy policies, as it did with 
Google in 2012. But there are no laws governing the content of company privacy policies. 
Similarly, there has been substantial discussion over many years on “Do Not Track” rules. 
Most browsers now have a user-controlled setting to alert advertisers that they do not want 
their Web activities tracked. But engaging that setting is largely symbolic—online adver-
tisers are not required to honor the user’s wishes. A working group established by the 
World Wide Web Consortium has been arguing over Do Not Track standards for over two 
years, with little evidence that a consensus will be reached anytime soon.52
Child Privacy Online 
The United States does have a separate law addressing the privacy of children online. The 
1998 Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) prohibits websites from collecting 
personal information from children under 13 without parental permission and requires that 
parents be allowed to review and correct any information collected about their children. The 
FTC is charged with primary enforcement of COPPA. In 2012, it updated its rules under 
COPPA in a number of ways: by expanding the definition of “personal information” to in-
clude not just names, phone numbers, home and e-mail address, but also mobile phone serial 
numbers, and extending the rule’s application to cover social media sites, interactive gaming 
sites, and smartphone and tablet apps. It also puts more substantial restrictions on the use of 
behavior-based online advertising. The information that triggers the need for parental con-
sent now includes photos, video, and the location of the child’s mobile device.53 [To take a 
look at the complaints, and other information, in cases brought by the FTC under COPPA, 
go to www.business.ftc.gov/privacy-and-security/children’s-online-privacy]
Privacy in Europe
The European Union has taken quite a different tack than America’s market-driven approach 
to online privacy. The European Union’s 1998 Data Protection Directive basically allows in-
dividuals to decide how their collected data can be used. Thus, if a European consumer 
provides personal information such as an address when buying from an online store, that store 
cannot legally send an ad to the purchaser without first seeking permission.54 The directive 
also prohibits the transfer of data to countries outside the European Union that do not have 
“adequate” privacy rules.55 The United States was one of the nations deemed inadequate, but 
by June 2000, European and U.S. negotiators had reached an agreement shielding U.S. com-
panies from prosecution by EU governments for violation of the Data Protection Directive as 
long as the companies comply with a list of “safe harbor” privacy principles.56 Following the 
revelations in 2013 of the extent of U.S. digital surveillance activities in Europe, there have 
been many calls in the European Union to reconsider the terms of this safe harbor. At the time 
of this writing, no such steps had been taken.57 However, a substantial revision of the 1998 
Directive is underway and may be enacted as early as mid-2014.58 The revision might force a 
renegotiation of the safe harbor with the United States.59
 
The philosophical chasm separating U.S. and EU data privacy policies was dramati-
cally illustrated when it became public that Google occasionally collected e-mails and 
passwords from residential Wi-Fi networks while its cars were driving city streets  taking 

Chapter Eighteen  Internet Law and Ethics  799
Part Four—Crime
Crimes facilitated by the Internet include both truly new types and some old, familiar 
crimes in somewhat new clothing. Some statutes previously discussed, such as the CAN-
SPAM and PROTECT acts, provide criminal penalties. Other laws criminalize specific 
online behavior, such as the Computer Pornography and Child Exploitation Prevention Act 
of 1999, which makes it unlawful to use a computer to solicit, lure, or entice a child or 
otherwise engage in sexual offenses with a child. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 
1986 bars individuals from accessing networked computers without authorization or ob-
taining information the individual is not authorized to take. Violation can result in substan-
tial jail time and fines. There is considerable difference among the federal circuits as to the 
breadth of its reach: The Ninth and Fourth Circuits read the law narrowly, limited to unau-
thorized access of computer systems,61 while the First, Fifth, Seventh, and Eleventh Cir-
cuits have taken a broader view. For example, the Seventh Circuit found that an employee 
who had been given access could still violate the law if the employee used that access to 
take unauthorized actions, such as deleting stored information.62 Judge Kozinski of the 
Ninth Circuit, concerned with vast expansion in the reach of the law, queried: “Many em-
ployers have adopted policies prohibiting the use of work computers for nonbusiness pur-
poses. Does an employee who violates such a policy commit a federal crime?”
 
Many of our long-standing, pre-Internet criminal laws can be applied to both online and 
offline behavior. For example, in February 2013, over just a few hours, digital thieves stole 
$45 million from thousands of ATM machines in New York City.63 Fundamentally, this is 
no different from an old-fashioned bank robbery but using modern-day tools. Likewise, it 
is a federal crime to transport stolen property across state lines, even if the property is an 
intangible such as a detailed litigation strategy e-mailed by a law firm’s employee to op-
posing counsel in another state.64
 
So too, fraud can be perpetrated with or without the aid of computers and the Internet. 
Recently hatched schemes include:
• Ransomware, which locks a user’s computer and sends a fake police warning charging 
the user with abusive use of the Internet and imposing a fine to get the computer un-
locked.65
• Bogus tech support calls, in which a person who receives a call, allegedly from a com-
pany such as Microsoft, is told that their computer has reported a virus. If given remote 
access to the computer, the caller will download a program onto the computer and then 
photos for its Street View mapping service. In the United States the FTC ended its inquiry 
when Google pledged to stop gathering that information. In Europe, Google has agreed to 
destroy the data collected in Austria, Britain, Denmark, France, and Ireland, and then in 
2012 acknowledged that it had not actually done so. The Czech Republic banned Google 
from expanding its mapping program; Google was sued by an association of Internet users 
in Spain; and in 2013 authorities in Germany imposed close to the maximum fine its law 
allowed, although that was just shy of $190,000.60

800  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
show the owner a file that displays a warning message. The caller then offers to remove 
the virus immediately for a specified fee.66
• Malware delivered to Apple computers through a security breach in a Java program 
which co-opts the computer into a botnet controlling thousands of such computers to 
perpetrate click fraud that, alternatively, can cause the computers to click repeatedly on 
ads for a particular business, causing its advertising bill to skyrocket, or to click repeat-
edly on ads appearing on a host website earning revenue for that site for getting poten-
tial customers to the advertiser’s site.67
• Fake reviews on Yelp, Google, Citysearch, and similar sites posted by reputation en-
hancement companies on behalf of client restaurants, dentists, lawyers, and others, for 
the purpose of directing business to them based on fictitious experiences.68
Yet some existing criminal laws describe the prohibited behavior in terms that often pre-
vent their application to cyber-versions of what is, at its essence, the same bad act, such as 
between physical stalking and cyberstalking. In a 2005 Illinois case, a former electronics 
store employee was sentenced to four years in prison for sending lewd photos and threaten-
ing e-mail and phone messages to a 22-year-old woman who had taken her computer in for 
repair.69 This is cyberstalking—the repeated use of electronic media (such as e-mail or chat 
rooms) to harass or threaten another person. Every state has laws criminalizing traditional 
physical stalking. Most of these laws require that the perpetrator make a credible threat of 
violence for the action to be a violation; many do not expressly include cyberstalking, al-
though under appropriate facts it might be covered.
 
In recent years, the biggest stories in cybercrime have not been crimes targeted at spe-
cific individuals or even major crimes such as the New York City bank heist. Instead what 
has dominated the news is organized, widespread criminal activity directed at major insti-
tutions, both commercial and governmental, which raises an issue unique to our newly 
digital world—cybersecurity.
Cybersecurity
We live in the age of information. With the near complete infiltration of digital technology 
into the basic fabric of our lives, much of our most valuation information is stored on com-
puters, with vast quantities of information available even on single computer systems, en-
ticing a whole new category of thieves—hackers. Thanks to the Internet, hackers can break 
into our computers from the privacy of their own home, even if that home is a three-room 
apartment in St. Petersburg, Russia.70 Hacking can be simply malicious—destroying data 
or whole computer networks.71 Or computing power can be the object of the theft, as is 
true with botnets which were used in conjunction with the spam attacks previously dis-
cussed. 
 
On the other hand, the goal of some hacks is the theft of personal data from, at times, 
millions of individuals simultaneously. In 2012, the tax records of 3.8 million individuals 
and 850,000 businesses were stolen from the South Carolina Department of Revenue’s 
database, records that contained information ranging from Social Security numbers to 
bank account information.72 From late November through mid-December 2013, thieves 

Chapter Eighteen  Internet Law and Ethics  801
hacked into the cash registers at Target stores, stealing tens of millions of payment card 
numbers.73 By some estimates, 12.6 million people in the United States were victims of 
identity theft in 2012 alone.74
 
As devastating as identity theft can be for the individual whose identity has been stolen, 
from a societal point of view it gets worse. Of considerable concern has been the rise of 
cyber-espionage—both industrial and military espionage for the purpose of stealing mili-
tary and economic secrets and intellectual property. The perpetrators can strike from U.S. 
soil or from foreign nations; there has been considerable speculation that such attacks have 
sourced from governments, including China, Iran, North Korea, and the United States.75 
The United States has expressed concern that its critical infrastructure is being targeted, 
such as its electricity grids, water supplies, computer and cell phone networks, and banks.76
 
The cost of all this cybercrime, which includes the spending to defend against it, has 
been estimated at $1 trillion. But more recently, a study undertaken in part by the Center 
for Strategic and International Studies, a nonprofit based in Washington, D.C., estimated 
the cost at $100 billion per year.77 That said, Congress has not addressed the problem with 
legislation and the Obama administration issued only voluntary cybersecurity guidelines 
for certain crucial industries, such as banks and utilities.78
International Computer-Facilitated Crime
As is obvious from the foregoing, any truly effective response to cybercrime would be 
substantially aided by an international, coordinated approach. The Council of Europe has 
proffered the Convention on Cybercrime as an international effort to address computer-
facilitated crime. It has been signed by 44 member states and four nonmember states, al-
though only 40 states have ratified it.79 The convention went into force July 1, 2004, for 
the original ratifying states. It requires “the criminalization of a long list of computer 
activities— everything from breaking into a computer to the ‘deterioration’ of computer 
data. . . . It also requires countries to make sure they can snoop through Internet data in real 
time. And it obliges nations to assist each other’s investigations by monitoring Net com-
munications.”80
 
Each country’s decisions to criminalize certain behaviors reflect that country’s moral 
attitudes and historical experiences. Some proscribed behaviors such as murder are fairly 
universal, but other behaviors are acceptable in some countries while criminalized in oth-
ers. Where such crimes are facilitated by the Internet, international disputes over the ap-
propriate reach of such laws have arisen. We have already seen one example in the Yahoo! 
v. La Ligue Contre Le Racisme et L’Antisemitisme case in Part Two of this chapter, where 
France sought to enforce its ban on the sale of Nazi memorabilia to French citizens.
 
Both the United Kingdom and Germany have enforced criminal laws based on porno-
graphic materials posted on websites outside their geographic boundaries. The United 
Kingdom  convicted one of its citizens operating out of his home in the United Kingdom of 
“publication” of  pornographic materials on websites located in the United States.81 
 Germany originally convicted the German head of CompuServe, a U.S. company, for 
 allowing German citizens access to pornographic websites hosted outside Germany, de-
spite the fact that CompuServe had no feasible technological way to block access. 

802  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations
(Block-ing access would have required the U.S. corporation to block access to all of its 
customers worldwide.) The conviction was overturned a year later.82
Part Five—Commercial Law
Contracts and Uniform Laws
Internet sales have grown significantly, but for the Internet to reach its commercial poten-
tial a routine, well-settled contracts structure is essential. The basic ingredients of a bind-
ing contract, as we saw in Chapter 6, also apply to Internet transactions.
• Capacity to enter the contract.
• Offer and acceptance of the terms of the contract.
• Consideration for the promises in the contract.
• Genuineness of assent.
• Legality of purpose of the contract.
Thus, an e-mail exchange fulfilling the traditional contract requirements should result in an 
enforceable agreement. But what if acceptance is indicated only by providing an “elec-
tronic signature” (a digital code unique to an individual), downloading some information, 
opening a shrink-wrap package, or clicking an “Accept” button?
E-Signature Electronic signatures can take a variety of forms (voice prints, distinctive 
marks, mathematical codes), but they share a common purpose—to have the same legal 
effect as a signature affixed by hand. On June 30, 2000, President Clinton signed into law 
the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (E-SIGN), giving elec-
tronic signatures the same legal stature as handwritten ones, at least for most commercial 
purposes.83 Consumers, however, cannot be forced to accept electronic signature agree-
ments or to receive records and documents electronically rather than in paper form. [For a 
look at the digital signature laws of the United Nations, European Union, and the United 
Kingdom, see http://law.richmond.edu/jolt/v11i2/article6.pdf]
UCITA In 1999, the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws 
(NCCUSL) approved a model law designed to achieve uniformity across the United States 
in the law governing software and Internet transactions. The proposed law reaches all deals 
involving computer information or goods and is designed to address the special problems 
of the electronic market, including software licensure (right to use). The Uniform  Computer 
Information Transactions Act (UCITA) addresses the substance of computer information 
transactions, rather than procedural aspects such as electronic signatures.
 
To this point, UCITA has been amended twice (2000 and 2002), but it has been adopted 
in only Maryland and Virginia.84 Until it or some other such legislation is widely approved, 
the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), other applicable state and federal laws, and the com-
mon law of contracts (judge-made law) will govern electronic contractual arrangements. 

Chapter Eighteen  Internet Law and Ethics  803
(The UCC, having been approved in 49 of the 50 states, is designed to provide nationwide 
consistency, predictability, and fairness in contract law where a sale of goods is involved.)
Click-Wrap Agreements Today, software is typically downloaded with license terms 
provided onscreen during the installation process. Those terms often say that by using the 
software the buyer agrees to the terms. Whether all of those terms are enforceable in court 
is the subject of dispute. The likelihood is that many terms will be enforceable if the buyer 
has a reasonable opportunity to review those terms and can abort the installation (and the 
charge) if the terms are unacceptable. The court in Caspi v. Microsoft Network,85 applying 
a traditional contract law analysis, ruled that the choice of forum provision in just such an 
online click-wrap agreement was enforceable.
 
Critics are increasingly concerned, however, about just how voluntary some provisions in 
such standard-form contracts are. That is, has the purchaser genuinely consented to the con-
tract terms? It can appear that retailers are, perhaps deliberately, obscuring one-sided terms.86 
Who has not viewed with trepidation the presentation of contract terms in a 2-by-4-inch 
scrollable window with an “Agree” button prominently displayed below?
Intellectual Property
Continued expansion of electronic commerce depends to a significant extent on the 
 business community’s success in protecting its technology from theft, copying, infringe-
ment, and the like. Intellectual property, broadly, is composed of creative ideas that are 
the products of the human mind. Songs, computer programs, new 
medicines, a novel, and so on are forms of intellectual property. 
Recalling our discussion of market failure in Chapter 8, you may 
recognize that intellectual property, from an economics point of 
view, is a public good.
 
Intellectual property laws have been developed to provide a measure of protection from 
theft and exploitation to creators of such properties. The goal is to reward those whose in-
genuity and hard work have produced tangible results (recordings, movies, and the like) as 
an incentive for them and others to continue doing so. At least that is the American and 
Western view of intellectual property. Some cultures remain reluctant to recognize prop-
erty rights of this kind, but globalization seems certain to generate relatively consistent 
intellectual property standards for most of the world. Inclusion of the Agreement on Trade-
Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) as one of the WTO’s 
foundation agreements supports this projection. [For more on intellectual property law, see

Patents Exactly what role patents will play in the future development of the Internet is 
still somewhat uncertain. The grant of some early patents associated with basic methods of 
doing business online (such as Amazon.com’s “one-click” method for making Internet 
purchases and Priceline.com’s process of “reverse” auctions) raised considerable contro-
versy, resulting in the announcement by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2000 that 
it was overhauling the way it processes and awards patents for many online processes.87

The Patent Wars
In recent years, the most prominent Internet-related patent issues have arisen in disputes 
involving the thousands of patents associated with mobile devices such as smartphones 
and tablets, referred to as “a tsunami of patent-related lawsuits”88 in courts all over the 
world, including Australia, Britain, Germany, Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands, and 
the United States. The disputes have focused on acceptable license fees for standard-essen-
tial patents and on patent infringement allegations with regard to design and functionality 
characteristics. 
 
Standard-essential patents are those that address matters of basic communication and 
data handling which support and permit industrywide standards. For example, the tech-
nology behind wireless communication requires standardization so that smartphones 
made by any company can interact appropriately with Wi-Fi hotspots. Within the indus-
try, companies that own standard-essential patents have generally agreed to license the 
technology to other companies and to charge rates that are fair, reasonable, and nondis-
criminatory (FRAND). It is in the patent holders’ interest for their patents to become in-
dustry standards because license fees then produce a continuing income stream. On the 
other hand, it is equally important that standard-essential patent holders not be allowed to 
abuse their monopoly power with high fees so as to impair their competitors’ financial 
ability to compete. Complaints of overreaching rates have generated much litigation. In 
one such case, Microsoft argued Motorola’s offered rate could cost Microsoft $4 billion 
annually; the judge ruled that the interest of the whole market had to be considered in re-
solving the dispute, not just the interests of the two litigants, and set a rate of just under 
$1.8 million a year. The court pointed out that at least 92 entities own standard-essential 
patents related to the operational standard at issue in the suit. “If each of these 92 entities 
sought royalties similar to Motorola’s request of 1.15% to 1.73% of the end-product 
price, the aggregate royalty to implement [this operational standard] would exceed the 
total product price.”89
 
Apple and Samsung, the industry leaders in the smartphone market, have been involved 
in an epic patent infringement battle that began in a California federal district court in 
April 2011 when Apple sued Samsung for copying patented aspects of Apple’s iPhones, 
including their distinct look (a rectangle with rounded corners) and a number of their soft-
ware and hardware features. Samsung counterclaimed charging Apple with violations of 
some of Samsung’s standard-essential patents. They have pursued this battle, over these 
and other patents, not just in California where this first suit was filed, but also in Germany, 
South Korea, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. In August 2012, the jury in the 
California case found in favor of Apple and awarded $1 billion in damages (which was 
later somewhat reduced). Apple proceeded to pursue an injunction against Samsung con-
tinuing to produce its smartphone models that incorporated the infringed patents. While 
that issue was proceeding through motions and then appeals, Samsung pursued their fight 
in front of the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), which has the power to ban 
importation of items that it determines infringe others’ patents. The ITC ruled in June 2013 
that Apple infringed some of Samsung’s patents with regard to wireless connectivity and 
banned importation of some older models of Apple’s iPhones and iPads, which order was 
vetoed by the Obama administration in early August, on the basis that such bans were in-
appropriate where the infringement was related to standard-essential patents such as was 

Chapter Eighteen  Internet Law and Ethics  805
the case with the Samsung patents at issue. A mere week later, the ITC issued another or-
der banning importation, this time at Apple’s request and against certain Samsung devices. 
This time no standard-essential patents were involved. 
 
At the time of this writing, there has been no, and likely won’t be any, clear winner in 
these battles between Apple and Samsung. But then, many observers have pointed out that 
these battles aren’t really about patent protection, but rather represent a battle for domi-
nance in the mobile device market, including smartphones and tablets. It is worthy of note 
that in other contexts, Apple and Samsung work in concert: Apple is the largest customer 
for components manufactured by Samsung.90
Copyrights
In America and much of the world, anyone who creates “original works of authorship,” 
whether in print or digital form, is in most cases automatically protected by copyright laws if 
the “works” are original and are “fixed in tangible form” (written down on paper, for exam-
ple). The author has exclusive rights to commercially exploit those works for a period of years. 
Virtually all of the information available online is protected by the U.S. Copyright Act and 
includes such intellectual creations as data, databases, literature, music, software, photos, and 
multimedia works. Although original works of authorship are automatically copyrighted, the 
fullest protection of the law can only be achieved by placing a copyright notice on the work 
(such as “copyright 2014 McGraw-Hill”) and registering the copyright with the U.S. Copy-
right Office. International protection is provided by the principal copyright treaty, the Berne 
Convention. [Information on the U.S. Copyright  Office can be found at www.copyright.gov]
 
The copyright holder possesses the exclusive right to (1) reproduce the copyrighted work, 
(2) prepare adaptations based on the copyrighted material, (3) distribute the material by sale or 
otherwise, and (4) perform or display the material. When anyone other than the copyright 
holder, or one acting with the holder’s permission, makes use of one of those rights, the 
 copyright has been infringed unless the use falls within a series of exceptions. Perhaps the most 
notable of those exceptions is the fair use doctrine, which allows use of copyrighted material 
without permission under some conditions, such as limited, nonprofit use in a classroom. 
 
Another exception is the first sale doctrine, which provides that someone who owns a copy 
of a copyrighted work is free to resell it without infringing on the author’s rights. The court in 
Capitol Records v. ReDIGI held that songs bought from Apple’s iTunes and similar retailers 
cannot be resold by the original purchaser under the first sale doctrine because the doctrine 
protects only the owner of a particular copy, and no one can own a particular copy of a digital 
song—all copies are indistinguishable. It was also persuaded by the fact that physical copies 
degrade, whereas a digital copy could last forever.91
 
One of the most visible Internet copyright disputes has been the ongoing battle of the 
music recording industry to protect its copyrights. Music file sharing took off in the late 
1990s through the use of the Napster website, where users could swap digital music. The 
recording industry successfully obtained an injunction against Napster’s facilitation of 
such file sharing;92 but the practice continued, aided by peer-to-peer computer programs 
such as KaZaA and Grokster, which are installed on users’ computers. The recording in-
dustry sued Grokster and other file-sharing software distributors. The defendants prevailed 
at the district and circuit court levels.93 Then, in the following unanimous Supreme Court 
decision, the recording industry achieved a major victory.

125 S.Ct. 2764 (2005)
L E G A L  B R I E F C A S E
Justice Souter
I
A
Respondents, Grokster, Ltd., and StreamCast Networks, Inc., 
 defendants in the trial court, distribute free software products 
that allow computer users to share electronic files through 
peer-to-peer networks, so called because users’ computers 
communicate directly with each other, not through central 
servers. . . .
 
A group of copyright holders (MGM for short, but including 
 motion picture studios, recording companies, songwriters, 
and music publishers) sued Grokster and StreamCast for their 
users’ copyright infringements, alleging that they knowingly 
and intentionally distributed their software to enable users to 
reproduce and distribute the copyrighted works in violation of 
the Copyright Act.
* * * * *
 
Although Grokster and StreamCast do not know when par-
ticular files are copied, a few searches using their software 
would show what is available on the networks the software 
reaches. MGM commissioned a statistician to conduct a sys-
tematic search, and his study showed that nearly 90 percent of 
the files available for download on the FastTrack system were 
copyrighted works. Grokster and StreamCast dispute this fig-
ure. . . . They also argue that potential noninfringing uses of 
their software are significant in kind, even if infrequent in 
practice. Some musical performers, for example, have gained 
new audiences by distributing their copyrighted works for free 
across peer-to-peer networks, and some distributors of unpro-
tected content have used peer-to-peer networks to dissemi-
nate files, Shakespeare being an example. . . .
 
But MGM’s evidence gives reason to think that the vast 
 majority of users’ downloads are acts of infringement, and 
 because well over 100 million copies of the software in ques-
tion are known to have been downloaded, and billions of files 
are shared across the FastTrack and Gnutella networks each 
month, the probable scope of copyright infringement is stag-
gering.
 
Grokster and StreamCast concede the infringement in 
most downloads, and it is uncontested that they are aware 
that users employ their software primarily to download copy-
righted files, even if the decentralized . . . networks fail to re-
veal which files are being copied, and when. . . .
 
Grokster and StreamCast are not, however, merely passive 
recipients of information about infringing use. The record is 
replete with evidence that from the moment Grokster and 
StreamCast began to distribute their free software, each one 
clearly voiced the objective that recipients use it to download 
copyrighted works, and each took active steps to encourage 
infringement.
 
After the notorious file-sharing service, Napster, was sued 
by copyright holders for facilitation of copyright infringement, 
StreamCast gave away a software program of a kind known as 
OpenNap, designed as compatible with the Napster program 
and open to Napster users for downloading files from other 
Napster and OpenNap users’ computers. Evidence indicates 
that “it was always [StreamCast’s] intent to use [its OpenNap 
network] to be able to capture e-mail addresses of [its] initial 
target market so that [it] could promote [its] StreamCast 
 Morpheus interface to them.”
* * * * *
 
StreamCast developed promotional materials to market its 
service as the best Napster alternative. One proposed adver-
tisement read, “Napster Inc. has announced that it will soon 
begin charging you a fee. That’s if the courts don’t order it shut 
down first. What will you do to get around it?” Another pro-
posed ad touted StreamCast’s software as the “#1 alternative 
to Napster” and asked “when the lights went off at Napster . . 
. where did the users go?”
* * * * *
 
In addition to this evidence of express promotion, marketing, 
and intent to promote further, the business models employed by 
Grokster and StreamCast confirm that their principal object was 
use of their software to download copyrighted works. Grokster 
and StreamCast receive no revenue from users, who obtain the 
software itself for nothing. Instead, both companies generate 
income by selling advertising space, and they stream the adver-
tising to Grokster and Morpheus users while they are employing 
the programs. As the number of users of each program 
 increases, advertising opportunities become worth more.
 
Finally, there is no evidence that either company made an 
effort to filter copyrighted material from users’ downloads or 
otherwise impede the sharing of copyrighted files. . . .
B
The District Court . . . granted summary judgment in favor of 
Grokster and StreamCast as to any liability arising from distri-
bution of the then current versions of their software. 

 Distributing that software gave rise to no liability in the court’s 
view, because its use did not provide the distributors with ac-
tual knowledge of specific acts of infringement.
 
The Court of Appeals affirmed. In the court’s analysis, a de-
fendant was liable as a contributory infringer when it had knowl-
edge of direct infringement and materially contributed to the 
infringement. But the court read [our decision in] Sony Corp. of 
America v. Universal City Studios, Inc. as holding that distribution 
of a commercial product capable of substantial noninfringing 
uses could not give rise to contributory liability for infringement 
unless the distributor had actual knowledge of specific instances 
of infringement and failed to act on that knowledge. The fact that 
the software was capable of substantial noninfringing uses in 
the Ninth Circuit’s view meant that Grokster and StreamCast 
were not liable, because they had no such actual knowledge, 
owing to the decentralized architecture of their software. The 
court also held that Grokster and StreamCast did not materially 
contribute to their users’ infringement because it was the users 
themselves who searched for, retrieved, and stored the infring-
ing files, with no involvement by the defendants beyond provid-
ing the software in the first place.
II
A
* * * * *
The argument for imposing indirect liability in this case is . . . a 
powerful one, given the number of infringing downloads that 
occur every day using StreamCast’s and Grokster’s software. 
When a widely shared service or product is used to commit 
infringement, it may be impossible to enforce rights in the pro-
tected work effectively against all direct infringers, the only 
practical alternative being to go against the distributor of the 
copying device for secondary liability on a theory of contribu-
tory or vicarious infringement.
B
* * * * *
In Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios this Court addressed a 
claim that secondary liability for infringement can arise from the 
very distribution of a commercial product. There, the product, 
novel at the time, was what we know today as the videocassette 
recorder or VCR. Copyright holders sued Sony as the manufac-
turer, claiming it was contributorily liable for infringement that oc-
curred when VCR owners taped copyrighted programs because it 
supplied the means used to infringe, and it had constructive 
knowledge that infringement would occur. At the trial on the mer-
its, the evidence showed that the principal use of the VCR was for 
“‘time-shifting,’” or taping a program for later viewing at a more 
convenient time, which the Court found to be a fair, not an infring-
ing, use. There was no evidence that Sony had expressed an 
 object of bringing about taping in violation of copyright or had 
taken active steps to increase its profits from unlawful taping. 
 Although Sony’s advertisements urged consumers to buy the VCR 
to “‘record favorite shows’” or “‘build a library’” of recorded 
 programs, neither of these uses was necessarily infringing.
 
On those facts, with no evidence of stated or indicated in-
tent to promote infringing uses, the only conceivable basis for 
imposing liability was on a theory of contributory infringement 
arising from its sale of VCRs to consumers with knowledge 
that some would use them to infringe. But because the VCR 
was “capable of commercially significant noninfringing uses,” 
we held the manufacturer could not be faulted solely on the 
basis of its distribution.
* * * * *
 
Because the Circuit [Court of Appeals] found the Stream-
Cast and Grokster software capable of substantial lawful use, 
it concluded on the basis of its reading of Sony that neither 
company could be held liable, since there was no showing 
that their software, being without any central server, afforded 
them knowledge of specific unlawful uses.
 
This view of Sony, however, was error. . . .
C
[Nothing] in Sony requires courts to ignore evidence of intent 
if there is such evidence. . . . Thus, where evidence goes be-
yond a product’s characteristics or the knowledge that it may 
be put to infringing uses, and shows statements or actions 
 directed to promoting infringement, Sony’s . . . rule will not 
 preclude liability. The classic case of direct evidence of 
 unlawful purpose occurs when one induces commission of 
infringement by another, or “entices or persuades another” to 
infringe, as by advertising.
* * * * *
 
 [The] inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright. We 
adopt it here, holding that one who distributes a device with 
the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown 
by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster 
infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by 
third parties. We are, of course, mindful of the need to keep 
from trenching on regular commerce or discouraging the de-
velopment of technologies with lawful and unlawful potential. 
Accordingly, just as Sony did not find intentional inducement 
despite the knowledge of the VCR manufacturer that its device 
could be used to infringe, mere knowledge of infringing poten-
tial or of actual infringing uses would not be enough here to 
subject a distributor to liability. Nor would ordinary acts 
Chapter Eighteen  Internet Law and Ethics  807

 incident to product distribution, such as offering customers 
technical support or product updates, support liability in them-
selves. The inducement rule, instead, premises liability on pur-
poseful, culpable expression and conduct, and thus does 
nothing to compromise legitimate commerce or discourage in-
novation having a lawful promise.
III
A
The only apparent question about treating MGM’s evidence as 
sufficient to withstand summary judgment under the theory of 
inducement goes to the need on MGM’s part to adduce evi-
dence that StreamCast and Grokster communicated an induc-
ing message to their software users.
* * * * *
 
Here, the . . . record is replete with evidence that Grokster 
and StreamCast, unlike the manufacturer and distributor in 
Sony, acted with a purpose to cause copyright violations by 
use of software suitable for illegal use.
 
Three features of this evidence of intent are particularly 
notable. First, each company showed itself to be aiming to sat-
isfy a known source of demand for copyright infringement, the 
market comprising former Napster users.
* * * * *
 
Second, this evidence of unlawful objective is given added 
significance by MGM’s showing that neither company at-
tempted to develop filtering tools or other mechanisms to di-
minish the infringing activity using their software.
 
Third, [it] is useful to recall that StreamCast and Grokster 
make money by selling advertising space, by directing ads to 
the screens of computers employing their software. . . .
B
In addition to intent to bring about infringement and distribu-
tion of a device suitable for infringing use, the inducement 
theory of course requires evidence of actual infringement by 
recipients of the device, the software in this case. As the ac-
count of the facts indicates, there is evidence of infringement 
on a gigantic scale, and there is no serious issue of the ade-
quacy of MGM’s showing on this point. . . . There is substantial 
evidence in MGM’s  favor on all elements of inducement, and 
summary judgment in favor of Grokster and StreamCast was 
error.

AFTERWORD
Concurrently with suing file-sharing facilitators such as 
Grokster and StreamCast, the recording industry pursued the 
file sharers as well—35,000 of them between 2003 and 2008 
including many university students.94 According to one source, 
in 2006 “college students illegally obtained two-thirds of their 
music and accounted for 1.3 billion illegal downloads.”95 Under 
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), copyright hold-
ers can subpoena ISPs, including universities, to obtain the 
identity of those believed to be infringing. Of the 35,000 identi-
fied file sharers mentioned above, 12,000 lawsuits were filed, 
with two ultimately proceeding to trial. In one, a jury set dam-
ages against a former graduate student of $22,500 per song. 
The $675,000 award became final after the Supreme Court de-
clined to hear the student’s petition in 2012.96 Just one month 
later, the Eighth Circuit reinstated a jury verdict of $220,000 in 
the second case.97
Market Response
While record labels were pursuing copyright infringers, some of the largest online music 
stores changed policies to remove usage restrictions from downloaded files. In mid-2007, 
both Apple and Amazon.com announced that their music would no longer be locked to 
808  Unit Five  Selected Topics in Government–Business Relations

Chapter Eighteen  Internet Law and Ethics  809
certain players or programs. Both have the support of EMI, one of the largest record labels. 
The restrictions against putting their downloads on multiple computers and mobile devices 
(restrictions that aren’t imposed when a CD is purchased) had long annoyed consumers. It 
had also drawn the unfavorable attention of EU regulators, who saw it as a form of unfair 
competition.98
 
In 2013, Amazon and Apple once more seemed to be positioning themselves to lead the 
market. In January 2013, Amazon received a patent “to set up an exchange for all sorts of 
digital material.”99 And in March 2013, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office published an 
application from Apple for a patent of its own for a digital marketplace for users to sell or 
give away various digital copyrighted material. Thus, both companies seem to be explor-
ing the possibility of having the first sale doctrine apply to digital copies or perhaps lobby-
ing for a statutory change to the DMCA.
Grokster Redux?
In 2007, Viacom sued Google’s YouTube video-sharing service alleging willful facilita-
tion of infringement on a massive scale of Viacom’s copyrights from shows on Comedy 
Central, MTV, and Nickelodeon. Viacom claimed over $1 billion in damages.100 The trial 
court granted YouTube’s motion for summary judgment. The DMCA provides a safe har-
bor against copyright infringement claims for ISPs and host websites if the host site re-
sponds expeditiously to remove, or disable access to, the copyrighted material when 
notified of violations. The court pointed out that Viacom had invoked the DMCA safe 
harbor when it notified YouTube of 100,000 offending videos and, by the next business 
day, YouTube had removed virtually all of them.101 The Second Circuit vacated the deci-
sion, stating that, at least with respect to “a handful of the offending clips,” “a reasonable 
jury could conclude that YouTube had knowledge or awareness” of infringement. It also 
directed the lower court to consider whether YouTube had been “willfully blind” to the 
presence of infringing material on its site. On remand, the lower court was to “allow the 
parties to brief [the specified] issues, with a view to permitting renewed motions for sum-
mary judgment as soon as practicable.”102 A year later, the lower court once again granted 
YouTube’s motion for summary judgment, in a two-sentence opinion presenting summary 
conclusions on the issues remanded by the Second Circuit without analysis.103
 
What should be clear at this point is that copyright infringement is rampant, and the 
Internet has caused its exponential growth. What is not at all clear is what can or should be 
done about it. On the one side, content owners individually have very little ability to stop 
infringement of their copyrights. On the other side, seeking to impose the cost of protec-
tion on payment processors, advertising services, and domain name registries, as the Stop 
Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the PROTECT IP Act (both introduced in Congress in 
2012) would have done, may be costly to those middlemen and, in the end, not much more 
effective. Costly because reviewing and removing all the potentially infringing material 
would be a herculean task. Likely ineffective because offending content could be posted 
from and in any part of the world and still be accessible in nearly any other part.104 This 
problem lets us reconsider an issue we have seen repeatedly in this text—who has the 
power and the right to assert jurisdiction over what is a worldwide problem? At the mo-
ment, there really is no answer to that question.

Trademarks and Domain Names
Trademarks
Words, names, symbols, devices, or combinations thereof that are used to distinguish one 
seller’s products from those of another are called trademarks when associated with products 
(like IBM, Coke, and Pepsi) and service marks when associated with service businesses 
(United Airlines). Having established a trademark (or service mark), the holder can prohibit 
any unauthorized use of the mark, thus ensuring consumers can trust the source of goods 
they are buying. The mark also protects mark owners by preventing loss of reputation and 
value, for example, when the unauthorized product is of poor quality. Mark owners are also 
protected from an increase in supply that dilutes the product’s value. Infringement cannot 
occur unless, however, the marks are sufficiently similar that consumers could be confused.
 
The Internet has created new opportunities for confusion and, therefore, potential 
infringement. Recall the discussion of the dispute between Google and Louis Vuit-
ton from Chap ter 16. The issue was whether Google was infringing on Vuitton’s trade-
marks by selling ad space to Vuitton’s competitors at the top of Google’s search results 
when individuals used Google’s search engine looking for Vuitton products. The 
 European Court of Justice said no. Another company that has had to defend repeated 
trademark infringement suits is eBay. Individuals sometimes try to sell counterfeit 
goods on eBay. At times, for some luxury goods manufacturers, the percentage of coun-
terfeits available on the site had been quite high. The issue raised is the extent to which 
eBay has a duty to weed out counterfeit goods. After being sued, eBay improved its 
processes to greatly lessen the quantity of counterfeits sold, but it is also protected from 
liability by quickly removing any items when advised by the trademark holder that the 
goods are counterfeit.
Domain Names 
The Internet address for a Web page is called its domain name. The Domain Name System 
(DNS) for the whole of the Internet is overseen by the Internet Corporation for Assigned 
Names and Numbers (ICANN), a nonprofit organization with its headquarters in Califor-
nia.  Ordinarily, a business engaging in electronic commerce will want to use the simplest 
form of its name as its domain name. Rights to a domain name are secured simply by being 
the first to  request a name and pay the registration fee. The 1999 Anticybersquatting Con-
sumer Protection Act creates a cause of action if a trademark is infringed by another’s 
registration of a domain name that Web searchers may confuse with that trademark. The 
Third Circuit has also held that registration of deliberate misspellings of famous marks is a 
violation of the act.105
 
In 1999, ICANN set up an arbitration process for the resolution of domain name dis-
putes. Since then, more than 20,000 cases have been filed, of which 91 percent have been 
decided for the complainant.106 Carmen Electra, Michael Crichton, Kevin Spacey, Pamela 
Anderson, Celine Dion, and Bruce Springsteen have all used the process to have domain 
name versions of their names transferred to them, all of which were previously registered 
by the same Canadian company.107 [For information on the arbitration services available 
from the United Nations’ World Intellectual Property Organization pursuant to ICANN’s 
domain name arbitration policy, see www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains]

Chapter Eighteen  Internet Law and Ethics  811
Taxes
We close this chapter with an interesting public policy question raised by the remarkable 
confusion (and profusion) of the Internet. It is a policy issue, like many discussed in this 
chapter, that crosses traditional jurisdictional lines—both state boundaries in the United 
States and national boundaries around the world. Its resolution, either at the national level 
or at the international level, will require substantial negotiation, compromise and, ulti-
mately, consensus building.
 
What is the issue? We start with a national example: If you buy a CD on the Internet, 
your neighborhood retailer will not receive your business and your state and local govern-
ments often will not receive sales taxes as they would have if you had made the purchase 
at a local store. In pre-Internet days the Supreme Court had ruled that an out-of-state 
At this writing, more than a thousand new top-level domain 
names (TLDs) are just starting to go live. TLDs are the de-
scriptors that follow the period in a Web address, such as 
.com, .org, and .gov. Up until 2014, there were 22 general 
TLDs and 280 country-specific ones.108 Some of the new 
TLDs will be written in Arabic, Chinese, and Russian 
scripts; others are likely to be company names, such as 
.google or .amazon; still others will be generic terms, such 
as .blog or .pizza. Successful registrants will have the right 
to sell second-level domains (the portion of the address 
that precedes the TLD). Thus, popular TLDs could also be 
very lucrative to their holders. Verisign, which currently 
manages the .com and .net TLDs, reported $874 million in 
2012 revenues. ICANN accepted proposals from applicants 
for both open-use TLDs and restricted TLDs, the use of 
which the successful applicant might reserve solely for it-
self. L’Oreal is seeking the TLD .beauty and has stated that 
it would reserve some second-level domains, such as per-
sonal.beauty for itself. Amazon indicated that all of the 
TLDs for which it applied will be closed, for its use only. 
ICANN has indicated, however, that it has not yet deter-
mined whether to allow “closed generic domains.”109 [For 
more on the new TLDs, see http://newgtlds.icann.org/en]
Questions
1. If you were a member of ICANN, who would you vote to 
give the TLD of .amazon to—Amazon.com or the con-
sortium of Latin American countries through which the 
Amazon River runs?110 Would you agree to the creation 
of such TLDs as .Jew, .Christian, .Muslim, .Baha’i, .Mo-
ses, .Jesus, and .Mohamad? Explain. Should commu-
nity, cultural, historical interests—such as the use of a 
name—be in control of commercial interests and indi-
vidual companies? Discuss.
2. Applicants were charged $185,000 for each TLD appli-
cation they filed. They will incur another $25,000 annu-
ally for each TLD they retain.111 Do these fees raise 
ethical issues in terms of who might have wanted to 
control a particular TLD, but were financially unable to 
pay these fees? Explain.
3. Donuts Inc. filed the most applications, 307, and paid 
$57 million for the privilege to do so.112 It was the only 
applicant for 149 of them. Some have expressed con-
cern with Donuts Inc. as an appropriate registrant be-
cause of its alleged ties to Demand Media, “a company 
with a well-documented history of providing services to 
spammers and other perpetrators of Internet 
abuses.”113 Demand Media has been a “host to sites 
that commit ‘cybersquatting.’”114 Would you vote to al-
low Donuts Inc. to control over a hundred new TLDs? 
Discuss.
4. As stated above, Donuts Inc. applied for 307 TLDs. 
Google applied for 101 TLDs; Amazon for 76.115 Should 
one entity be permitted to control that many TLDs? Is it 
anticompetitive to give control over generic TLDs to 
private companies? Discuss.

Top-Level Domain Name Sale

 vendor cannot be required to collect sales taxes for any state in which that vendor does not 
have some significant presence, including a physical presence.116 The Court held that it 
would be an undue burden on interstate commerce for states to be able to require out-of-
state vendors to comply with each unique set of state and local sales tax rules. Thus, many 
states joined an effort to streamline, simplify, and coordinate their sales tax laws. The idea 
is that, if state sales taxes are more uniform, the burden on interstate commerce from re-
quiring the compliance of out-of-state vendors will be materially reduced.
 
As of this writing, a majority of states have been involved in the project, and 23 states 
and the District of Columbia have  conformed their laws to the requirements of the nego-
tiated agreement, which became operational in 2005. Participation on the part of vendors 
is voluntary, but many have registered and are now remitting taxes to member states. 
The primary incentive for voluntary participation is a grant of amnesty for any prior 
unpaid taxes that might have been owed.117 [For more on the Multistate Tax Compact, 
see www.mtc.gov]
 
That said, many online businesses have not agreed to submit voluntarily to collection of 
state taxes in states where they have no physical presence. Seven states are attempting to 
push the point through state legislation that defines nexus more broadly than determined 
by the Supreme Court in 1992. New York has passed such a law and sought to enforce it 
by suing noncomplying Internet vendors. The highest state court ruled that the state could 
require Internet retailers to collect sales taxes “if a vendor is paying New York residents to 
actively solicit business in this state” and denied appeals from both Amazon.com and 
Overstock.com. With regard to the law’s constitutionality under the prior Supreme Court 
decision, the New York judge wrote, “The world has changed dramatically in the last two 
decades and it may be that the physical presence test is outdated. An entity may now have 
a profound impact upon a foreign jurisdiction solely through its virtual projection via the 
Internet. That question, however, would be for the United States Supreme Court to con-
sider.”118 That may be, but in December 2013 the Supreme Court declined to do so when it 
declined the companies’ petitions for certiorari, leaving New York’s ruling to stand, thus 
requiring collection of state sales taxes.119
 
The problem is just as complex, if not more so, on an international scale. Here the issue 
spans the whole range of taxes, paralleling both our income tax laws and our sales tax 
laws. In a nutshell, what nation is entitled to tax cross-border transactions? In the interna-
tional arena, certain key principles were adopted in 1998 by the countries that comprise the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), including the princi-
ple that consumption taxes (like our sales taxes) should be collected by the jurisdiction 
where consumption takes place. But finding workable arrangements to effectuate the gen-
eral principles has proven elusive. [For more on the OECD, see www.oecd.org]
Reprise: Who Governs Cyberspace?
We near the end of this chapter examining the same kinds of questions we have raised

should government restrain the explosive and stupendously successful cyberspace indus-
try? Is the Internet a bit too much of a “Wild West” environment for the general good? 
Consider the story that follows:

Bitcoin: The Rise and Fall of a Virtual Currency
A paper published anonymously in 2008 outlined a method for creating a digital currency 
that could be exchanged on a peer-to-peer basis, but which would not be susceptible to 
unauthorized duplication. A year later the first Bitcoins were “mined” using an open-
source program, which by design constrains how many digital coins can be created and at 
what intervals (currently 25 every 10 minutes, but dropping in half every four years, with 
a total cap of 21 million). Digital currencies, of which Bitcoin is just one example, al-
though the one with the largest circulation thus far, are creatures of the Internet. They may 
have no issuing or governing body, can be self-authenticating, and are usable worldwide 
by members of the general public to engage in the same types of direct, one-to-one transac-
tions that daily occur using government-issued currencies. 
 
As a currency, a digital currency may have some advantages over other mediums of 
exchange. For example, merchants may prefer payment in Bitcoins because there is little 
or no transaction cost, in contrast to the 2 to 3 percent charged on most credit card transac-
tions. Fees are charged on exchanges of Bitcoins into or out of a specific national currency, 
which is also true for any foreign-exchange transaction. But the global nature of Bitcoin 
makes such exchanges less necessary—or at least will make them less necessary if its 
fluctuation in value ultimately settles down. At present, however, its value can fluctuate 
tremendously. For example, as of early March 2013, one exchange showed its historical 
high closing at $1,147 on December 4, 2013, but on February 25, 2014, the closing was 
$535, following the announcement that the world’s largest Bitcoin exchange, Mt. Gox in 
Japan, was likely to file for bankruptcy following its discovery of a large theft from its 
exchange. Just a week later, however, the price was hovering around $660.120
 
Another cause of its fluctuating price is that the currency has largely gone unregulated 
by the world’s governments. The United States has exerted some authority over the regula-
tion of exchanges that deal in Bitcoin, but the currency itself is largely free of governmen-
tal interference. If the currency is going to survive, that likely will change at least to some 
degree.
Question
The questions for digital currencies are, of course, should they be regulated and, if so, by 
whom? Based on Bitcoin’s short history, what could regulation achieve? What might it 
impede?

 3. In March 1992, Danish police seized the business records of BAMSE, a computer 
bulletin board system based in Denmark that sold child pornography over the Internet. 
The records included information that Mohrbacher, who lived in Paradise, 
 California, had downloaded two graphic interface format (GIF) images from 
BAMSE in January 1992.
 
  
In March 1993, police executed a search warrant at Mohrbacher’s workplace and 
found, among other images, two files that had been downloaded from BAMSE, one of a 
nude girl and one of a girl engaged in a sex act with an adult; both girls were under 12. 
During the execution of the warrant, Mohrbacher was cooperative, confessing that he 
had downloaded the two images from BAMSE. Mohrbacher was charged with transport-
ing or shipping images by computer as prohibited by 18 U.S.C. 2252(a)(1).  Mohrbacher 
argued that downloading is properly characterized as receiving images by computer, 
which is proscribed by section 2252(a)(2). He was not charged under (a)(2).
 
  
Should downloading from a computer bulletin board constitute shipping or trans-
porting within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. section 2252(a)(1)? Explain. See U.S. v. 
 Mohrbacher, 182 F.3d 1041 (9th Cir. 1999).

 5. America Online (AOL), an ISP, sued TSF Marketing and Joseph Melle, who founded 
TSF. AOL claimed that Melle and TSF sent spam to AOL subscribers. The e-mail 
contained the letters “aol.com” in the headers. AOL claimed that the e-mail totaled 
some 60 million messages over a 10-month period. Melle allegedly continued the 
mailings after he was notified in writing by AOL to stop. AOL received over 50,000 
complaints from subscribers. AOL claimed, among other things, that Melle had diluted 
its trademark.122 The case arose before the passage of the CAN-SPAM Act. Would 
Melle have been liable under that act? Explain.
 6. McLaren was an employee of Microsoft Corporation. In December 1996, Microsoft 
suspended McLaren’s employment pending an investigation into accusations of sexual 
harassment and “inventory questions.” McLaren requested access to his electronic mail 
to disprove the allegations against him. According to McLaren, he was told he could 
access his e-mail only by requesting it through company officials and telling them the 
location of a particular message. By memorandum, McLaren requested that no one 
tamper with his Microsoft office workstation or his e-mail. McLaren’s employment 
was terminated on December 11, 1996.
 
  
Following the termination of his employment, McLaren filed suit against the com-
pany alleging as his sole cause of action a claim for invasion of privacy. In support of his 
claim, McLaren alleged that, on information and belief, Microsoft had invaded his pri-
vacy by “breaking into” some or all of the personal folders maintained on his office 
Chapter

Chapter Eighteen  Internet Law and Ethics  815
computer and releasing the contents of the folders to third parties. According to McLaren, 
the personal folders were part of a computer application created by Microsoft in which 
e-mail messages could be stored. Access to the e-mail system was obtained through a 
network password. Access to personal folders could be additionally restricted by a “per-
sonal store” password created by the individual user. McLaren created and used a 
personal store password to restrict access to his personal folders.
 
  
McLaren concedes in his petition that it was possible for Microsoft to “decrypt” his 
personal store password. McLaren alleges, however, that “[b]y allowing [him] to have a 
personal store password for his personal folders, [McLaren] manifested and [Microsoft] 
recognized an expectation that the personal folders would be free from intrusion and in-
terference.” McLaren characterizes Microsoft’s decrypting or otherwise “breaking in” to 
his personal folders as an intentional, unjustified, and unlawful invasion of privacy.
 
  
Did Microsoft unlawfully invade McLaren’s privacy? Explain. See McLaren v. 
 Microsoft, 1999 Texas App. LEXIS 4103 (5th Dist., Dallas).
 7. Bensusan Restaurant Corporation owns the famous New York City jazz club “The 
Blue Note,” and in 1985 it registered the name as a federal trademark. Since 1980, 
King has operated a small club in Columbia, Missouri, also named “The Blue 
Note.” Around 1993, Bensusan wrote to King demanding that he discontinue use 
of “The Blue Note” name. King’s attorney responded by saying that Bensusan had 
no legal right to make the demand. In 1996, King created, in Missouri, a website 
for “The Blue Note,” which also contained a hyperlink to the New York club’s website. 
Bensusan then sued in the Southern District of New York, alleging Lanham Act 
and trademark violations, among other things. The New York court dismissed the 
case for lack of personal jurisdiction. Bensusan appealed. Decide. Explain. See 
Bensusan Restaurant Corp. v. King, 126 F.3d 25 (2d Cir. 1997).
 8. Plaintiff Marobie-FL, Inc., released software of copyrighted clip art for use in the fire 
service industry. Robisheaux administered the National Association of Fire Equipment 
Distributors (NAFED) Web page. He received the clip art from a source that he could 
not remember. He placed the clip art on NAFED’s Web page. At that point, the clip art 
could be readily accessed and downloaded by any Web user. Marobie claimed copyright 
infringement. Among other arguments, NAFED claimed that its display of the clip art 
constituted a fair use, within the meaning of federal copyright law. Decide. Explain. See 
Marobie-FL v. National Ass’n of Fire Equip. Dist., 983 F.Supp. 1167 (N.D. Ill. 1997).

Houston Chronicle, November 18, 1999, p. 3. The head of CompuServe Germany was con-
victed in 1998 of violating German law by failing to block CompuServe’s customers’ access to 
child pornography websites. At the time the only technical way for CompuServe to comply was 
to block all of its worldwide users from access. The conviction was reversed in 1999.
 13. See Revell v. Lidov, 317 F.3d 467 (5th Cir. 2002). Lidov posted an article he wrote on the 
“bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. The arti-
cle alleges that a broad politically motivated conspiracy among senior members of the Reagan 
administration lay behind their willful failure to stop the bombing despite clear advance warn-
ings. Furthermore, Lidov charged that the government proceeded to cover up its receipt of ad-
vance warning. . . . Specifically, the article singles out Oliver “Buck” Revell, then Associate 
Deputy Director of the FBI, for severe criticism, accusing him of complicity in the conspiracy 
and cover-up.” The article was posted on an Internet bulletin board maintained by Columbia 
University’s School of Journalism. “At the time he wrote the article, Lidov had never been to 
Texas, except possibly to change planes, or conducted business there, and was apparently una-
ware that Revell then resided in Texas.” “Columbia, since it began keeping records, never re-
ceived more than 20 Internet subscriptions to the Columbia Journalism Review from Texas 
residents.” The Fifth Circuit found that neither general nor specific jurisdiction existed in the 
Texas courts.
 14. Mink v. AAAA Development, 190 F.3d 333 (5th Cir. 1999).
 15. See, for example, Pavlovich v. DVD Copy Control Association. A California appeals court 
held that a Texas resident was subject to California’s jurisdiction for the knowing posting of 
trade secrets of a California company on an Indiana website. 91 Cal. App. 4th 409, 109 Cal. 
Rptr.2d 909 (Cal. Ct. App. 2001). But the California Supreme Court reversed. 58 P.3d 2 (Cal. 
2002). See also Gator.com Corp. v. L. L. Bean, Inc., where the district court held that L. L. 
Bean could not be sued in California where it had no stores or agents, although it did sell 
merchandise to California residents through its website. 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19373 (N.D. 
Cal. 2001). A three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed, finding in part that the volume 
of Internet business done by L. L. Bean with California residents made it subject to 
 California’s jurisdiction. 341 F.3d 1072 (9th Cir. 2003). That decision was vacated, however, 
when the Ninth Circuit decided to rehear the case en banc. 366 F.3d 789 (9th Cir. 2004). After 
oral argument on the rehearing, however, Gator.com and L. L. Bean settled their substantive 
dispute, and thus the Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeal because of the lack of a continuing 
case or controversy. 398 F.3d 1125 (2005).

of which he was a principal, awarding damages to both plaintiffs. In her blog, defendant had 
asserted the attorney, a court-appointed trustee in a bankruptcy proceeding, had committed tax 
fraud. The Ninth Circuit held that unlawful acts of a person in such a position was a matter of 
public concern. Thus, plaintiffs could not prevail simply by proving the assertion to be false, but 
were also required to prove negligence on plaintiff’s part. In addition, any damage award would 
require proof of actual damages. The case was remanded for a new trial.

§ 2–104. Definitions: “Merchant”; “Between Merchants”; “Financing Agency”
(1) “Merchant” means a person who deals in goods of the kind or otherwise by his 
occupation holds himself out as having knowledge or skill peculiar to the practices or 

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  843
goods involved in the transaction or to whom such knowledge or skill may be attributed 
by his employment of an agent or broker or other intermediary who by his occupation 
holds himself out as having such knowledge or skill.
(2) “Financing agency” means a bank, finance company, or other person who in the 
ordinary course of business makes advances against goods or documents of title or who 
by arrangement with either the seller or the buyer intervenes in ordinary course to make 
or collect payment due or claimed under the contract for sale, as by purchasing or pay-
ing the seller’s draft or making advances against it or by merely taking it for collection 
whether or not the documents of title accompany the draft. “Financing agency” includes 
also a bank or other person who similarly intervenes between persons who are in the 
position of seller and buyer in respect to the goods (Section 2–707).
(3) “Between merchants” means in any transaction with respect to which both par-
ties are chargeable with the knowledge or skill of merchants.
§ 2–105. Definitions: “Transferability”; “Goods”; “Future” Goods; “Lot”; 
“Commercial Unit”
(1) “Goods” means all things (including specially manufactured goods) which are 
movable at the time of identification to the contract for sale other than the money in 
which the price is to be paid, investment securities (Article 8), and things in action. 
“Goods” also includes the unborn young of animals and growing crops and other iden-
tified things attached to realty as described in the section on goods to be severed from 
realty (Section 2–107).
(2) Goods must be both existing and identified before any interest in them can pass. 
Goods which are not both existing and identified are “future” goods. A purported present 
sale of future goods or of any interest therein operates as a contract to sell.
(3) There may be a sale of a part interest in existing identified goods.
(4) An undivided share in an identified bulk of fungible goods is sufficiently identi-
fied to be sold although the quantity of the bulk is not determined. Any agreed propor-
tion of such a bulk or any quantity thereof agreed upon by number, weight, or other 
measure may to the extent of the seller’s interest in the bulk be sold to the buyer who 
then becomes an owner in common.
(5) “Lot” means a parcel or a single article which is the subject matter of a separate 
sale or delivery, whether or not it is sufficient to perform the contract.
(6) “Commercial unit” means such a unit of goods as by commercial usage is a single 
whole for purposes of sale and division of which materially impairs its character or value on 
the market or in use. A commercial unit may be a single article (as a machine) or a set of 
articles (as a suite of furniture or an assortment of sizes) or a quantity (as a bale, gross, or 
carload) or any other unit treated in use or in the relevant market as a single whole.
§ 2–106. Definitions: “Contract”; “Agreement”; “Contract for Sale”; “Sale”; 
“Present Sale”; “Conforming” to Contract; “Termination”; “Cancellation”
(1) In this Article unless the context otherwise requires “contract” and “agreement” 
are limited to those relating to the present or future sale of goods. “Contract for sale” 
includes both a present sale of goods and a contract to sell goods at a future time. A 

844  Appendix B
“sale” consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price (Section 
2–401). A “present sale” means a sale which is accomplished by the making of the 
 contract.
(2) Goods or conduct including any part of a performance are “conforming” or con-
form to the contract when they are in accordance with the obligations under the contract.
(3) “Termination” occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement 
or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On “termination” all 
obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged, but any right based 
on prior breach or performance survives.
(4) “Cancellation” occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by 
the other, and its effect is the same as that of “termination” except that the cancelling party 
also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.
§ 2–107. Goods to Be Severed from Realty: Recording
(1) A contract for the sale of minerals or the like (including oil and gas) or a struc-
ture or its materials to be removed from realty is a contract for the sale of goods within 
this Article if they are to be severed by the seller; but until severance a purported pres-
ent sale thereof which is not effective as a transfer of an interest in land is effective only 
as a contract to sell.
(2) A contract for the sale apart from the land of growing crops or other things 
attached to realty and capable of severance without material harm thereto but not 
described in subsection (1) or of timber to be cut is a contract for the sale of goods 
within this Article whether the subject matter is to be severed by the buyer or by the 
seller even though it forms part of the realty at the time of contracting, and the parties 
can by identification effect a present sale before severance.
(3) The provisions of this section are subject to any third party rights provided by 
the law relating to realty records, and the contract for sale may be executed and recorded as 
a document transferring an interest in land and shall then constitute notice to third par-
ties of the buyer’s right under the contract for sale.
Part 2. Form, Formation, and Readjustment of Contract
§ 2–201. Formal Requirements; Statute of Frauds
(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a contract for the sale of goods for 
the price of $500 or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is 
some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the 
parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his author-
ized agent or broker. A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states 
a term agreed upon, but the contract is not enforceable under this paragraph beyond the 
quantity of goods shown in such writing.
(2) Between merchants, if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the 
contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason 
to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of subsection (1) against such party 
unless written notice of objection to its contents is given within 10 days after it is 
received.

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  845
(3) A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection (1) but which 
is valid in other respects is enforceable
(a) if the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable 
for sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller’s business and the seller, 
before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances which rea-
sonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial 
beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; or
(b) if the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his pleading, tes-
timony, or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the con-
tract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods 
admitted; or
(c) with respect to goods for which payment has been made and accepted or 
which have been received and accepted (Section 2–606).
§ 2–202. Final Written Expression: Parol or Extrinsic Evidence
Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which 
are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their 
agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by 
evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be 
 explained or supplemented
(a) by course and dealing or usage of trade (Section 1–205) or by course of per-
formance (Section 2–208); and
(b) by evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing 
to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms 
of the agreement.
§ 2–203. Seals Inoperative
The affixing of a seal to a writing evidencing a contract for sale or an offer to buy or 
sell goods does not constitute the writing a sealed instrument and the law with respect 
to sealed instruments does not apply to such a contract or offer.
§ 2–204. Formation in General
(1) A contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agree-
ment, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a 
 contract.
(2) An agreement sufficient to constitute a contract for sale may be found even though 
the moment of its making is undetermined.
(3) Even though one or more terms are left open a contract for sale does not fail for 
indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a contract and there is a reasonably 
certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.
§ 2–205. Firm Offers
An offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed writing which by its terms gives 
assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the 

846  Appendix B
time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time, but in no event may such period 
of irrevocability exceed three months; but any such term of assurance on a form sup-
plied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offerer.
§ 2–206. Offer and Acceptance in Formation of Contract
(1) Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances
(a) an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any 
manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances;
(b) an order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment shall be 
construed as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by the 
prompt or current shipment of conforming or nonconforming goods, but such 
a shipment of nonconforming goods does not constitute an acceptance if the 
seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is offered only as an 
accommodation to the buyer.
(2) Where the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of accept-
ance, an offerer who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the 
offer as having lapsed before acceptance.
§ 2–207. Additional Terms in Acceptance or Confirmation
(1) A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation 
which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states 
terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is 
expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.
(2) The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract. 
Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless
(a) the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer;
(b) they materially alter it; or
(c) notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a 
reasonable time after notice of them is received.
(3) Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient 
to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise estab-
lish a contract. In such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms 
on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incor-
porated under any other provisions of this Act.
§ 2–208. Course of Performance or Practical Construction
(1) Where the contract for sale involves repeated occasions for performance by either 
party with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to 
it by the other, any course of performance accepted or acquiesced in without objection 
shall be relevant to determine the meaning of the agreement.
(2) The express terms of the agreement and any such course of performance, as well 
as any course of dealing and usage of trade, shall be construed whenever reasonable as 
consistent with each other; but when such construction is unreasonable, express terms 
shall control course of performance and course of performance shall control both course 
of dealing and usage of trade (Section 1–205).

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  847
(3) Subject to the provisions of the next section on modification and waiver, such 
course of performance shall be relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term 
inconsistent with such course of performance.
§ 2–209. Modification, Rescission, and Waiver
(1) An agreement modifying a contract within this Article needs no consideration to 
be binding.
(2) A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed 
writing cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as between merchants such a 
requirement on a form supplied by the merchant must be separately signed by the other party.
(3) The requirements of the statute of frauds section of this Article (Section 2–201) 
must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within its provisions.
(4) Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the require-
ments of subsection (2) or (3) it can operate as a waiver.
(5) A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of the contract may 
retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict per-
formance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in 
view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver.
§ 2–210. Delegation of Performance; Assignment of Rights
(1) A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or 
unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform 
or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the 
party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9–406, unless otherwise agreed all rights 
of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially 
change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on 
him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A 
right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor’s 
due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.
(3) The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the 
seller’s interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or 
increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the 
buyer’s chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection 
(2) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation 
of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfec-
tion, and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but (i) the seller is liable 
to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could 
not reasonably be prevented by the buyer, and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant 
other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction 
against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement.
(4) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of “the 
contract” is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor’s 
performance.

848  Appendix B
(5) An assignment of “the contract” or of “all my rights under the contract” or an 
assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language 
or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a del-
egation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee 
constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by 
either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.
(6) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creat-
ing reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the 
assignor demand assurances from the assignee (Section 2–609).
Part 3. General Obligation and Construction of Contract
§ 2–301. General Obligations of Parties
The obligation of the seller is to transfer and deliver and that of the buyer is to accept and 
pay in accordance with the contract.
§ 2–302. Unconscionable Contract or Clause
(1) If the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to 
have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the 
contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable 
clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any 
unconscionable result.
(2) When it is claimed or appears to the court that the contract or any clause thereof 
may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present 
evidence as to its commercial setting, purpose, and effect to aid the court in making the 
determination.
§ 2–303. Allocation or Division of Risks
Where this Article allocates a risk or a burden as between the parties “unless otherwise 
agreed,” the agreement may not only shift the allocation but may also divide the risk or 
burden.
§ 2–304. Price Payable in Money, Goods, Realty, or Otherwise
(1) The price can be made payable in money or otherwise. If it is payable in whole 
or in part in goods each party is a seller of the goods which he is to transfer.
(2) Even though all or part of the price is payable in an interest in realty the trans-
fer of the goods and the seller’s obligations with reference to them are subject to this 
Article, but not the transfer of the interest in realty or the transferor’s obligations in con-
nection therewith.
§ 2–305. Open Price Term
(1) The parties if they so intend can conclude a contract for sale even though  the 
price is not settled. In such a case the price is a reasonable price at the time for  delivery 
if
(a) nothing is said as to price; or
(b) the price is left to be agreed by the parties and they fail to agree; or

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  849
(c) the price is to be fixed in terms of some agreed market or other standard as 
set or recorded by a third person or agency and it is not so set or recorded.
(2) A price to be fixed by the seller or by the buyer means a price for him to fix in 
good faith.
(3) When a price left to be fixed otherwise than by agreement of the parties fails to 
be fixed through fault of one party the other may at his option treat the contract as 
cancelled or himself fix a reasonable price.
(4) Where, however, the parties intend not to be bound unless the price be fixed or 
agreed and it is not fixed or agreed there is no contract. In such a case the buyer must 
return any goods already received or if unable so to do must pay their reasonable value 
at the time of delivery and the seller must return any portion of the price paid on account.
§ 2–306. Output, Requirements, and Exclusive Dealings
(1) A term which measures the quantity by the output of the seller or the require-
ments of the buyer means such actual output or requirements as may occur in good 
faith, except that no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate or in the 
absence of a stated estimate to any normal or otherwise comparable prior output or 
requirements may be tendered or demanded.
(2) A lawful agreement by either the seller or the buyer for exclusive dealing in the 
kind of goods concerned imposes unless otherwise agreed an obligation by the seller to 
use best efforts to supply the goods and by the buyer to use best efforts to promote 
their sale.
§ 2–307. Delivery in Single Lot or Several Lots
Unless otherwise agreed all goods called for by a contract for sale must be tendered in 
a single delivery and payment is due only on such tender; but where the circumstances 
give either party the right to make or demand delivery in lots the price if it can be appor-
tioned may be demanded for each lot.
§ 2–308. Absence of Specified Place for Delivery
Unless otherwise agreed
(a) the place for delivery of goods is the seller’s place of business or if he has 
none his residence; but
(b) in a contract for sale of identified goods which to the knowledge of the par-
ties at the time of contracting are in some other place, that place is the place 
for their delivery; and
(c) documents of title may be delivered through customary banking channels.
§ 2–309. Absence of Specific Time Provisions; Notice of Termination
(1) The time for shipment or delivery or any other action under a contract if not pro-
vided in this Article or agreed upon shall be a reasonable time.
(2) Where the contract provides for successive performance but is indefinite in dura-
tion it is valid for a reasonable time but unless otherwise agreed may be terminated at 
any time by either party.

850  Appendix B
(3) Termination of a contract by one party except on the happening of an agreed event 
requires that reasonable notification be received by the other party and an agreement 
dispensing with notification is invalid if its operation would be unconscionable.
§ 2–310. Open Time for Payment or Running of Credit; Authority to Ship under 
Reservation
Unless otherwise agreed
(a) payment is due at the time and place at which the buyer is to receive the 
goods even though the place of shipment is the place of delivery; and
(b) if the seller is authorized to send the goods he may ship them under reserva-
tion, and may tender the documents of title, but the buyer may inspect the 
goods after their arrival before payment is due unless such inspection is incon-
sistent with the terms of the contract (Section 2–513); and
(c) if delivery is authorized and made by way of documents of title otherwise 
than by subsection (b) then payment is due at the time and place at which the 
buyer is to receive the documents regardless of where the goods are to be 
received; and
(d) where the seller is required or authorized to ship the goods on credit the credit 
period runs from the time of shipment, but postdating the invoice or delaying 
its dispatch will correspondingly delay the starting of the credit period.
§ 2–311. Options and Cooperation Respecting Performance
(1) An agreement for sale which is otherwise sufficiently definite (subsection (3) of 
Section 2–204) to be a contract is not made invalid by the fact that it leaves particulars 
of performance to be specified by one of the parties. Any such specification must be 
made in good faith and within limits set by commercial reasonableness.
(2) Unless otherwise agreed specifications relating to assortment of the goods are at 
the buyer’s option and except as otherwise provided in subsections (1) (c) and (3) of Sec-
tion 2–319 specifications or arrangements relating to shipment are at the seller’s option.
(3) Where such specification would materially affect the other party’s performance 
but is not seasonably made or where one party’s cooperation is necessary to the agreed 
performance of the other but is not seasonably forthcoming, the other party in addition 
to all other remedies
(a) is excused for any resulting delay in his own performance; and
(b) may also either proceed to perform in any reasonable manner or after the time 
for a material part of his own performance treat the failure to specify or to 
cooperate as a breach by failure to deliver or accept the goods.
§ 2–312. Warranty of Title and Against Infringement; Buyer’s Obligation Against 
Infringement
(1) Subject to subsection (2) there is in a contract for sale a warranty by the seller 
that
(a) the title conveyed shall be good, and its transfer rightful; and

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  851
(b) the goods shall be delivered free from any security interest or other lien or 
encumbrance of which the buyer at the time of contracting has no knowledge.
(2) A warranty under subsection (1) will be excluded or modified only by specific 
language or by circumstances which give the buyer reason to know that the person sell-
ing does not claim title in himself or that he is purporting to sell only such right or title 
as he or a third person may have.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed a seller who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of 
the kind warrants that the goods shall be delivered free of the rightful claim of any third 
person by way of infringement or the like; but a buyer who furnishes specifications to 
the seller must hold the seller harmless against any such claim which arises out of com-
pliance with the specifications.
§ 2–313. Express Warranties by Affirmation, Promise, Description, Sample
(1) Express warranties by the seller are created as follows:
(a) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which 
relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an 
express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.
(b) Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain 
creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.
(c) Any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates 
an express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample 
or model.
(2) It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal 
words such as “warrant” or “guarantee” or that he have a specific intention to make a 
warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purport-
ing to be merely the seller’s opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a 
 warranty.
§ 2–314. Implied Warranty: Merchantability; Usage of Trade
(1) Unless excluded or modified (Section 2–316), a warranty that the goods shall be 
merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect 
to goods of that kind. Under this section the serving for value of food or drink to be 
consumed either on the premises or elsewhere is a sale.
(2) Goods to be merchantable must be at least such as
(a) pass without objection in the trade under the contract description; and
(b) in the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality within the descrip-
tion; and
(c) are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used; and
(d) run, within the variations permitted by the agreement, of even kind, quality, 
and quantity within each unit and among all units involved; and
(e) are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the agreement may 
require; and
(f) conform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label 
if any.

852  Appendix B
(3) Unless excluded or modified (Section 2–316) other implied warranties may arise 
from course of dealing or usage of trade.
§ 2–315. Implied Warranty: Fitness for Particular Purpose
Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose 
for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller’s skill or 
judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is unless excluded or modified under 
the next  section an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.
§ 2–316. Exclusion or Modification of Warranties
(1) Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or 
conduct tending to negate or limit warranty shall be construed wherever reasonable as 
consistent with each other, but subject to the provisions of this Article on parol or 
 extrinsic evidence (Section 2–202) negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that 
such construction is unreasonable.
(2) Subject to subsection (3), to exclude or modify the implied warranty of mer-
chantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of 
a writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of  fitness 
the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied 
warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states, for example, that “There are no warranties 
which extend beyond the description on the face hereof.”
(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2)
(a) unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are 
excluded by expressions like “as is,” “with all faults,” or other language which 
in common understanding calls the buyer’s attention to the exclusion of war-
ranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty; and
(b) when the buyer before entering into the contract has examined the goods or 
the sample or model as fully as he desired or has refused to examine the goods 
there is no implied warranty with regard to defects which an examination 
ought in the circumstances to have revealed to him; and
(c) an implied warranty can also be excluded or modified by course of dealing 
or course of performance or usage of trade.
(4) Remedies for breach of warranty can be limited in accordance with the provisions 
of this Article on liquidation or limitation of damages and on contractual modification 
of remedy (Sections 2–718 and 2–719).
§ 2–317. Cumulation and Conflict of Warranties Express or Implied
Warranties whether express or implied shall be construed as consistent with each other and 
as cumulative, but if such construction is unreasonable the intention of the parties shall deter-
mine which warranty is dominant. In ascertaining that intention the following rules apply:
(a) Exact or technical specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or 
general language of description.
(b) A sample from an existing bulk displaces inconsistent general language of 
description.

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  853
(c) Express warranties displace inconsistent implied warranties other than an 
implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.
§ 2–318. Third Party Beneficiaries of Warranties Express or Implied
Note: If this Act is introduced in the Congress of the United States this section should be 
omitted. (States to select one alternative.)
Alternative A A seller’s warranty whether express or implied extends to any natural 
person who is in the family or household of his buyer or who is a guest in his home if it 
is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume, or be affected by the goods 
and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. A seller may not exclude or limit 
the operation of this section.
Alternative B A seller’s warranty whether express or implied extends to any natural 
person who may reasonably be expected to use, consume, or be affected by the goods 
and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. A seller may not exclude or limit 
the operation of this section.
Alternative C A seller’s warranty whether express or implied extends to any person 
who may reasonably be expected to use, consume, or be affected by the goods and who 
is injured by breach of the warranty. A seller may not exclude or limit the operation of 
this section with respect to injury to the person of an individual to whom the warranty 
extends.
§ 2–319. F.O.B. and F.A.S. Terms
(1) Unless otherwise agreed the term F.O.B. (which means “free on board”) at a 
named place, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is a delivery 
term under which
(a) when the term is F.O.B. the place of shipment, the seller must at that place 
ship the goods in the manner provided in this Article (Section 2–504) and bear 
the expense and risk of putting them into the possession of the carrier; or
(b) when the term is F.O.B. the place of destination, the seller must at his own 
expense and risk transport the goods to that place and there tender delivery 
of them in the manner provided in this Article (Section 2–503);
(c) when under either (a) or (b) the term is also F.O.B. vessel, car, or other  vehicle, 
the seller must in addition at his own expense and risk load the goods on 
board. If the term is F.O.B. vessel the buyer must name the vessel and in an 
appropriate case the seller must comply with the provisions of this Article on 
the form of bill of lading (Section 2–323).
(2) Unless otherwise agreed the term F.A.S. vessel (which means “free alongside”) 
at a named port, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is a  delivery 
term under which the seller must
(a) at his own expense and risk deliver the goods alongside the vessel in the  manner 
usual in that port or on a dock designated and provided by the buyer; and
(b) obtain and tender a receipt for the goods in exchange for which the carrier is 
under a duty to issue a bill of lading.

854  Appendix B
(3) Unless otherwise agreed in any case falling within subsection (1)(a) or (c) or 
subsection (2) the buyer must seasonably give any needed instructions for making delivery, 
including when the term is F.A.S. or F.O.B. the loading berth of the vessel and in an 
appropriate case its name and sailing date. The seller may treat the failure of needed 
instructions as a failure of cooperation under this Article (Section 2–311). He may 
also at his option move the goods in any reasonable manner preparatory to delivery or 
shipment.
(4) Under the term F.O.B. vessel or F.A.S. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must 
make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender 
nor the buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution for the documents.
§ 2–320. C.I.F. and C. & F. Terms
(1) The term C.I.F. means that the price includes in a lump sum the cost of the goods 
and the insurance and freight to the named destination. The term C. & F. or C.F. means 
that the price so includes cost and freight to the named destination.
(2) Unless otherwise agreed and even though used only in connection with the stated 
price and destination, the term C.I.F. destination or its equivalent requires the seller at 
his own expense and risk to
(a) put the goods into the possession of a carrier at the port for shipment and 
obtain a negotiable bill or bills of lading covering the entire transportation to 
the named destination; and
(b) load the goods and obtain a receipt from the carrier (which may be contained 
in the bill of lading) showing that the freight has been paid or provided for; 
and
(c) obtain a policy or certificate of insurance, including any war risk insurance, 
of a kind and on terms then current at the port of shipment in the usual 
amount, in the currency of the contract, shown to cover the same goods cov-
ered by the bill of lading and providing for payment of loss to the order of 
the buyer or for the account of whom it may concern; but the seller may add 
to the price the amount of the premium for any such war risk insurance; and
(d) prepare an invoice of the goods and procure any other documents required to 
effect shipment or to comply with the contract; and
(e) forward and tender with commercial promptness all the documents in due 
form and with any endorsement necessary to perfect the buyer’s rights.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed the term C. & F. or its equivalent has the same effect 
and imposes upon the seller the same obligations and risks as a C.I.F. term except the 
obligation as to insurance.
(4) Under the term C.I.F. or C. & F. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make 
payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the 
buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution for the documents.
§ 2–321. C.I.F. or C. & F.: “Net Landed Weights”; “Payment on Arrival”; Warranty 
of Condition on Arrival
Under a contract containing a term C.I.F. or C. & F.

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  855
(1) Where the price is based on or is to be adjusted according to “net landed weights,” 
“delivered weights,” “out turn” quantity or quality, or the like, unless otherwise agreed 
the seller must reasonably estimate the price. The payment due on tender of the docu-
ments called for by the contract is the amount so estimated, but after final adjustment 
of the price a settlement must be made with commercial promptness.
(2) An agreement described in subsection (1) or any warranty of quality or condition 
of the goods on arrival places upon the seller the risk of ordinary deterioration, shrink-
age, and the like in transportation but has no effect on the place or time of identification 
to the contract for sale or delivery or on the passing of the risk of loss.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed where the contract provides for payment on or after 
arrival of the goods the seller must before payment allow such preliminary inspection as 
is feasible; but if the goods are lost delivery of the documents and payment are due when 
the goods should have arrived.
§ 2–322. Delivery “Ex-Ship”
(1) Unless otherwise agreed a term for delivery of goods “ex-ship” (which means 
from the carrying vessel) or in equivalent language is not restricted to a particular ship 
and requires delivery from a ship which has reached a place at the named port of desti-
nation where goods of the kind are usually discharged.
(2) Under such a term unless otherwise agreed
(a) the seller must discharge all liens arising out of the carriage and furnish the 
buyer with a direction which puts the carrier under a duty to deliver the goods; 
and
(b) the risk of loss does not pass to the buyer until the goods leave the ship’s 
tackle or are otherwise properly unloaded.
§ 2–323. Form of Bill of Lading Required in Overseas Shipment; “Overseas”
(1) Where the contract contemplates overseas shipment and contains a term C.I.F. or 
C. & F. or F.O.B. vessel, the seller unless otherwise agreed must obtain a negotiable bill 
of lading stating that the goods have been loaded on board or, in the case of a term C.I.F. 
or C. & F., received for shipment.
(2) Where in a case within subsection (1) a bill of lading has been issued in a set of 
parts, unless otherwise agreed if the documents are not to be sent from abroad the buyer 
may demand tender of the full set; otherwise only one part of the bill of lading need be 
tendered. Even if the agreement expressly requires a full set
(a) due tender of a single part is acceptable within the provisions of this Article 
on cure of improper delivery (subsection (1) of Section 2–508); and
(b) even though the full set is demanded, if the documents are sent from 
abroad the person tendering an incomplete set may nevertheless require 
payment upon furnishing an indemnity which the buyer in good faith 
deems adequate.
(3) A shipment by water or by air or a contract contemplating such shipment is 
“overseas” insofar as by usage of trade or agreement it is subject to the commercial, 
financing, or shipping practices characteristic of international deep water commerce.

856  Appendix B
§ 2–324. “No Arrival, No Sale” Term
Under a term “no arrival, no sale” or terms of like meaning, unless otherwise agreed,
(a) the seller must properly ship conforming goods and if they arrive by any 
means he must tender them on arrival but he assumes no obligation that the 
goods will arrive unless he has caused the nonarrival; and
(b) where without fault of the seller the goods are in part lost or have so 
deteriorated as no longer to conform to the contract or arrive after the 
contract time, the buyer may proceed as if there had been casualty to 
identified goods (Section 2–613).
§ 2–325. “Letter of Credit” Term; “Confirmed Credit”
(1) Failure of the buyer seasonably to furnish an agreed letter of credit is a breach 
of the contract for sale.
(2) The delivery to seller of a proper letter of credit suspends the buyer’s obligation 
to pay. If the letter of credit is dishonored, the seller may on seasonable notification to 
the buyer require payment directly from him.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed the term “letter of credit” or “banker’s credit” in a con-
tract for sale means an irrevocable credit issued by a financing agency of good repute 
and, where the shipment is overseas, of good international repute. The term “confirmed 
credit” means that the credit must also carry the direct obligation of such an agency 
which does business in the seller’s financial market.
§ 2–326. Sale on Approval and Sale or Return; Rights of Creditors
(1) Unless otherwise agreed, if delivered goods may be returned by the buyer even 
though they conform to the contract, the transaction is
(a) a “sale on approval” if the goods are delivered primarily for use, and
(b) a “sale or return” if the goods are delivered primarily for resale.
(2) Goods held on approval are not subject to the claims of the buyer’s creditors until 
acceptance; goods held on sale or return are subject to such claims while in the buyer’s 
possession.
(3) Any “or return” term of a contract for sale is to be treated as a separate contract 
for sale within the statute of frauds section of this Article (Section 2–201) and as con-
tradicting the sale aspect of the contract within the provisions of this Article on parol or 
extrinsic evidence (Section 2–202).
§ 2–327. Special Incidents of Sale on Approval and Sale or Return
(1) Under a sale on approval unless otherwise agreed
(a) although the goods are identified to the contract the risk of loss and the title 
do not pass to the buyer until acceptance; and
(b) use of the goods consistent with the purpose of trial is not acceptance but 
failure seasonably to notify the seller of election to return the goods is accept-
ance, and if the goods conform to the contract acceptance of any part is 
acceptance of the whole; and

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  857
(c) after due notification of election to return, the return is at the seller’s risk and 
expense but a merchant buyer must follow any reasonable instructions.
(2) Under a sale or return unless otherwise agreed
(a) the option to return extends to the whole or any commercial unit of the goods 
while in substantially their original conditions, but must be exercised season-
ably; and
(b) the return is at the buyer’s risk and expense.
§ 2–328. Sale by Auction
(1) In a sale by auction if goods are put up in lots each lot is the subject of a  separate 
sale.
(2) A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer so announces by the fall of 
the hammer or in other customary manner. Where a bid is made while the hammer is 
falling in acceptance of a prior bid the auctioneer may in his discretion reopen the bid-
ding or declare the goods sold under the bid on which the hammer was falling.
(3) Such a sale is with reserve unless the goods are in explicit terms put up without 
reserve. In an auction with reserve the auctioneer may withdraw the goods at any time 
until he announces completion of the sale. In an auction without reserve, after the auc-
tioneer calls for bids on an article or lot, that article or lot cannot be withdrawn unless 
no bid is made within a reasonable time. In either case a bidder may retract his bid until 
the auctioneer’s announcement of completion of the sale, but a bidder’s retraction does 
not revive any previous bid.
(4) If the auctioneer knowingly receives a bid on the seller’s behalf or the seller makes 
or procures such a bid, and notice has not been given that liberty for such bidding is 
reserved, the buyer may at his option avoid the sale or take the goods at the price of the 
last good faith bid prior to the completion of the sale. This subsection shall not apply to 
any bid at a forced sale.
Part 4. Title, Creditors, and Good-Faith Purchasers
§ 2–401. Passing of Title; Reservation for Security; Limited Application of This 
Section
Each provision of this Article with regard to the rights, obligations, and remedies of the 
seller, the buyer, purchasers, or other third parties applies irrespective of title to the goods 
except where the provision refers to such title. Insofar as situations are not covered by the 
other provisions of this Article and matters concerning title become material the following 
rules apply:
(1) Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to their identification to 
the contract (Section 2–501), and unless otherwise explicitly agreed the buyer acquires 
by their identification a special property as limited by this Act. Any retention or reser-
vation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is 
limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest. Subject to these provisions and 
to the provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9), title to goods passes 
from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on 
by the parties.

858  Appendix B
(2) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed title passes to the buyer at the time and place 
at which the seller completes his performance with reference to the physical delivery of 
the goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of 
title is to be delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and despite any reser-
vation of a security interest by the bill of lading
(a) if the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer 
but does not require him to deliver them at destination, title passes to the 
buyer at the time and place of shipment; but
(b) if the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there.
(3) Unless otherwise explicitly agreed, where delivery is to be made without moving 
the goods.
(a) if the seller is to deliver a document of title, title passes at the time when and 
the place where he delivers such documents; or
(b) if the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents 
are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.
(4) A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether 
or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance revests title to the goods in the 
seller. Such revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a “sale.”
§ 2–402. Rights of Seller’s Creditors Against Sold Goods
(1) Except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), rights of unsecured creditors of the 
seller with respect to goods which have been identified to a contract for sale are subject 
to the buyer’s rights to recover the goods under this Article (Sections 2–502 and 2–716).
(2) A creditor of the seller may treat a sale or an identification of goods to a contract 
for sale as void if as against him a retention of possession by the seller is fraudulent under 
any rule of law of the state where the goods are situated, except that retention of pos-
session in good faith and current course of trade by a merchant–seller for a commercially 
reasonable time after a sale or identification is not fraudulent.
(3) Nothing in this Article shall be deemed to impair the rights of creditors of the 
seller
(a) under the provisions of the Article on Secured Transactions (Article 9); or
(b) where identification to the contract or delivery is made not in current course 
of trade but in satisfaction of or as security for a preexisting claim for money, 
security, or the like and is made under circumstances which under any rule 
of law of the state where the goods are situated would apart from this Article 
constitute the transaction a fraudulent transfer or voidable preference.
§ 2–403. Power to Transfer; Good-Faith Purchase of Goods; “Entrusting”
(1) A purchaser of goods acquires all title which his transferor had or had power to 
transfer except that a purchaser of a limited interest acquires rights only to the extent of 
the interest purchased. A person with voidable title has power to transfer a good title to 
a good-faith purchaser for value. When goods have been delivered under a transaction 
of purchase the purchaser has such power even though
(a) the transferor was deceived as to the identity of the purchaser, or

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  859
(b) the delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored, or
(c) it was agreed that the transaction was to be a “cash sale,” or
(d) the delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the 
criminal law.
(2) Any entrusting of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that 
kind gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course 
of business.
(3) “Entrusting” includes any delivery and any acquiescence in retention of pos-
session regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery    or 
acquiescence and regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the 
 possessor’s disposition of the goods have been such as to be larcenous under the 
 criminal law.
(4) The rights of other purchasers of goods and of lien creditors are governed by 
the Articles on Secured Transactions (Article 9). [Bulk Transfers/Sales (Article 6)* and 
Documents of Title (Article 7)].
Part 5. Performance
§ 2–501. Insurable Interest in Goods; Manner of Identification of Goods
(1) The buyer obtains a special property and an insurable interest in goods by iden-
tification of existing goods as goods to which the contract refers even though the goods 
so identified are nonconforming and he has an option to return or reject them. Such iden-
tification can be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. 
In the absence of explicit agreement identification occurs
(a) when the contract is made if it is for the sale of goods already existing and 
identified;
(b) if the contract is for the sale of future goods other than those described in 
paragraph (c), when goods are shipped, marked, or otherwise designated by 
the seller as goods to which the contract refers;
(c) when the crops are planted or otherwise become growing crops or the young 
are conceived if the contract is for the sale of unborn young to be born within 
12 months after contracting or for the sale of crops to be harvested within 12 
months or the next normal harvest season after contracting, whichever is 
longer.
(2) The seller retains an insurable interest in goods so long as title to or any security 
interest in the goods remains in him; and where the identification is by the seller alone 
he may until default or insolvency or notification to the buyer that the identification is 
final substitute other goods for those identified.
(3) Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other 
statute or rule of law.
§ 2–502. Buyer’s Right to Goods on Seller’s Insolvency
(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) and even though the goods have not been 
shipped, a buyer who has paid a part or all of the price of goods in which he has a 
special property under the provisions of the immediately preceding section may on making 

860  Appendix B
and keeping good a tender of any unpaid portion of their price recover them from the 
seller if
(a) in the case of goods bought for personal, family, or household purposes, the 
seller repudiates or fails to deliver as required by the contract; or
(b) in all cases, the seller becomes insolvent within 10 days after receipt of the 
first installment on their price.
(2) The buyer’s right to recover the goods under subsection (1)(a) vests upon acqui-
sition of a special property, even if the seller had not then repudiated or failed to deliver.
(3) If the identification creating his special property has been made by the buyer he 
acquires the right to recover the goods only if they conform to the contract for sale.
§ 2–503. Manner of Seller’s Tender of Delivery
(1) Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the 
buyer’s disposition and give the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable 
him to take delivery. The manner, time, and place for tender are determined by the agree-
ment and this Article, and in particular
(a) tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of goods they must be kept 
available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take pos-
session; but
(b) unless otherwise agreed the buyer must furnish facilities reasonably suited to 
the receipt of the goods.
(2) Where the case is within the next section respecting shipment tender requires that 
the seller comply with its provisions.
(3) Where the seller is required to deliver at a particular destination tender requires 
that he comply with subsection (1) and also in any appropriate case tender documents 
as described in subsections (4) and (5) of this section.
(4) Where goods are in the possession of a bailee and are to be delivered without 
being moved
(a) tender requires that the seller either tender a negotiable document of title cover-
ing such goods or procure acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer’s right 
to possession of the goods; but
(b) tender to the buyer of a nonnegotiable document of title or of a written direc-
tion to the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender unless the buyer seasonably 
objects, and receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyer’s rights fixes 
those rights as against the bailee and all third persons; but risk of loss of the 
goods and of any failure by the bailee to honor the nonnegotiable document 
of title or to obey the direction remains on the seller untill the buyer has had 
a reasonable time to present the document or direction, and a refusal by the 
bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender.
(5) Where the contract requires the seller to deliver documents
(a) he must tender all such documents in correct form, except as provided in this 
Article with respect to bills of lading in a set (subsection (2) of Section 
2–323); and

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  861
(b) tender through customary banking channels is sufficient and dishonor of a 
draft accompanying the documents constitutes nonacceptance or rejection.
§ 2–504. Shipment by Seller
Where the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer and the con-
tract does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, then unless other-
wise agreed he must
(a) put the goods in the possession of such a carrier and make such a contract 
for their transportation as may be reasonable having regard to the nature of 
the goods and other circumstances of the case; and
(b) obtain and promptly deliver or tender in due form any document necessary to 
enable the buyer to obtain possession of the goods or otherwise required by the 
agreement or by usage of trade; and
(c) promptly notify the buyer of the shipment.
Failure to notify the buyer under paragraph (c) or to make a proper contract under para-
graph (a) is a ground for rejection only if material delay or loss ensues.
§ 2–505. Seller’s Shipment under Reservation
(1) Where the seller has identified goods to the contract by or before shipment,
(a) his procurement of a negotiable bill of lading to his own order or otherwise 
reserves in him a security interest in the goods. His procurement of the bill 
to the order of a financing agency or of the buyer indicates in addition only 
the seller’s expectation of transferring that interest to the person named.
(b) a nonnegotiable bill of lading to himself or his nominee reserves possession 
of the goods as security but except in a case of conditional delivery (subsec-
tion (2) of Section 2–507) a nonnegotiable bill of lading naming the buyer as 
consignee reserves no security interest even though the seller retains posses-
sion of the bill of lading.
(2) When shipment by the seller with reservation of a security interest is in violation 
of the contract for sale it constitutes an improper contract for transportation within the 
preceding section but impairs neither the rights given to the buyer by shipment and iden-
tification of the goods to the contract nor the seller’s powers as a holder of a negotiable 
document.
§ 2–506. Rights of Financing Agency
(1) A financing agency by paying or purchasing for value a draft which relates to a 
shipment of goods acquires to the extent of the payment or purchase and in addition to 
its own rights under the draft and any document of title securing it any rights of the 
shipper in the goods including the right to stop delivery and the shipper’s right to have 
the draft honored by the buyer.
(2) The right to reimbursement of a financing agency which has in good faith hon-
ored or purchased the draft under commitment to or authority from the buyer is not 
impaired by subsequent discovery of defects with reference to any relevant document 
which was apparently regular on its face.

862  Appendix B
§ 2–507. Effect of Seller’s Tender; Delivery on Condition
(1) Tender of delivery is a condition to the buyer’s duty to accept the goods and, 
unless otherwise agreed, to his duty to pay for them. Tender entitles the seller to accep-
tance of the goods and to payment according to the contract.
(2) Where payment is due and demanded on the delivery to the buyer of goods or 
documents of title, his right as against the seller to retain or dispose of them is conditional 
upon his making the payment due.
§ 2–508. Cure by Seller of Improper Tender or Delivery; Replacement
(1) Where any tender or delivery by the seller is rejected because nonconforming and 
the time for performance has not yet expired, the seller may seasonably notify the buyer 
of his intention to cure and may then within the contract time make a conforming 
 delivery.
(2) Where the buyer rejects a nonconforming tender which the seller had reasonable 
grounds to believe would be acceptable with or without money allowance the seller may 
if he seasonably notifies the buyer have a further reasonable time to substitute a con-
forming tender.
§ 2–509. Risk of Loss in the Absence of Breach
(1) Where the contract requires or authorizes the seller to ship the goods by carrier
(a) if it does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, the risk 
of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are duly delivered to the carrier 
even though the shipment is under reservation (Section 2–505); but
(b) if it does require him to deliver them at a particular destination and the goods 
are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss 
passes to the buyer when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable 
the buyer to take delivery.
(2) Where the goods are held by a bailee to be delivered without being moved, the 
risk of loss passes to the buyer
(a) on his receipt of a negotiable document of title covering the goods; or
(b) on acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer’s right to possession of the 
goods; or
(c) after his receipt of a nonnegotiable document of title or other written direc-
tion to deliver, as provided in subsection (4)(b) of Section 2–503.
(3) In any case not within subsection (1) or (2), the risk of loss passes to the buyer 
on his receipt of the goods if the seller is a merchant; otherwise the risk passes to the 
buyer on tender of delivery.
(4) The provisions of this section are subject to contrary agreement of the parties and 
to the provisions of this Article on sale on approval (Section 2–327) and on effect of 
breach on risk of loss (Section 2–510).
§ 2–510. Effect of Breach on Risk of Loss
(1) Where a tender or delivery of goods so fails to conform to the contract as to give 
a right of rejection the risk of their loss remains on the seller until cure or acceptance.

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  863
(2) Where the buyer rightfully revokes acceptance he may to the extent of any defi-
ciency in his effective insurance coverage treat the risk of loss as having rested on the 
seller from the beginning.
(3) Where the buyer as to conforming goods already identified to the contract for sale 
repudiates or is otherwise in breach before risk of their loss has passed to him, the seller 
may to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage treat the risk of 
loss as resting on the buyer for a commercially reasonable time.
§ 2–511. Tender of Payment by Buyer; Payment by Check
(1) Unless otherwise agreed tender of payment is a condition to the seller’s duty to 
tender and complete any delivery.
(2) Tender of payment is sufficient when made by any means or in any manner cur-
rent in the ordinary course of business unless the seller demands payment in legal ten der 
and gives any extension of time reasonably necessary to procure it.
(3) Subject to the provisions of this Act on the effect of an instrument on an obliga-
tion (Section 3–310), payment by check is conditional and is defeated as between the 
parties by dishonor of the check on due presentment.
§ 2–512. Payment by Buyer before Inspection
(1) Where the contract requires payment before inspection nonconformity of the 
goods does not excuse the buyer from so making payment unless
(a) the nonconformity appears without inspection; or
(b) despite tender of the required documents the circumstances would justify 
injunction against honor under this Act (Section 5–109(b)).
(2) Payment pursuant to subsection (1) does not constitute an acceptance of goods or 
impair the buyer’s right to inspect or any of his remedies.
§ 2–513. Buyer’s Right to Inspection of Goods
(1) Unless otherwise agreed and subject to subsection (3), where goods are tendered 
or delivered or identified to the contract for sale, the buyer has a right before payment 
or acceptance to inspect them at any reasonable place and time and in any reasonable 
manner. When the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer, the 
inspection may be after their arrival.
(2) Expenses of inspection must be borne by the buyer but may be recovered from 
the seller if the goods do not conform and are rejected.
(3) Unless otherwise agreed and subject to the provisions of this Article on C.I.F. con-
tracts (subsection (3) of Section 2–321), the buyer is not entitled to inspect the goods 
before payment of the price when the contract provides
(a) for delivery “C.O.D.” or on other like terms; or
(b) for payment against documents of title, except where such payment is due 
only after the goods are to become available for inspection.
(4) A place or method of inspection fixed by the parties is presumed to be exclusive 
but unless otherwise expressly agreed it does not postpone identification or shift the place 
for delivery or for passing the risk of loss. If compliance becomes impossible, inspection 

864  Appendix B
shall be as provided in this section unless the place or method fixed was clearly intended 
as an indispensable condition, failure of which avoids the contract.
§ 2–514. When Documents Deliverable on Acceptance; When on Payment
Unless otherwise agreed documents against which a draft is drawn are to be delivered to 
the drawee on acceptance of the draft if it is payable more than three days after pre-
sentment; otherwise, only on payment.
§ 2–515. Preserving Evidence of Goods in Dispute
In furtherance of the adjustment of any claim or dispute
(a) either party on reasonable notification to the other and for the purpose of 
ascertaining the facts and preserving evidence has the right to inspect, test, 
and sample the goods including such of them as may be in the possession 
or control of the other; and
(b) the parties may agree to a third-party inspection or survey to determine the 
conformity or condition of the goods and may agree that the findings shall 
be binding upon them in any subsequent litigation or adjustment.
Part 6. Breach, Repudiation, and Excuse
§ 2–601. Buyer’s Rights on Improper Delivery
Subject to the provisions of this Article on breach in installment contracts (Section 2–612) 
and unless otherwise agreed under the sections on contractual limitations of  remedy 
(Sections 2–718 and 2–719), if the goods or the tender of delivery fail in any respect to 
conform to the contract, the buyer may
(a) reject the whole; or
(b) accept the whole; or
(c) accept any commercial unit or units and reject the rest.
§ 2–602. Manner and Effect of Rightful Rejection
(1) Rejection of goods must be within a reasonable time after their delivery or tender. 
It is ineffective unless the buyer seasonably notifies the seller.
(2) Subject to the provisions of the two following sections on rejected goods (Sec-
tions 2–603 and 2–604),
(a) after rejection any exercise of ownership by the buyer with respect to any 
commercial unit is wrongful as against the seller; and
(b) if the buyer has before rejection taken physical possession of goods in which 
he does not have a security interest under the provisions of this Article (sub-
section (3) of Section 2–711), he is under a duty after rejection to hold them 
with reasonable care at the seller’s disposition for a time sufficient to permit 
the seller to remove them; but
(c) the buyer has no further obligations with regard to goods rightfully rejected.
(3) The seller’s rights with respect to goods wrongfully rejected are governed by the 
provisions of this Article on Seller’s remedies in general (Section 2–703).

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  865
§ 2–603. Merchant Buyer’s Duties as to Rightfully Rejected Goods
(1) Subject to any security interest in the buyer (subsection (3) of Section 2–711), 
when the seller has no agent or place of business at the market of rejection a merchant 
buyer is under a duty after rejection of goods in his possession or control to follow any 
reasonable instructions received from the seller with respect to the goods and in the 
absence of such instructions to make reasonable efforts to sell them for the seller’s 
account if they are perishable or threaten to decline in value speedily. Instructions are 
not reasonable if on demand indemnity for expenses is not forthcoming.
(2) When the buyer sells goods under subsection (1), he is entitled to reimbursement 
from the seller or out of the proceeds for reasonable expenses of caring for and selling 
them, and if the expenses include no selling commission then to such commission as is 
usual in the trade or if there is none to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10 percent on 
the gross proceeds.
(3) In complying with this section the buyer is held only to good faith and good-faith 
conduct hereunder is neither acceptance nor conversion nor the basis of an action for 
damages.
§ 2–604. Buyer’s Options as to Salvage of Rightfully Rejected Goods
Subject to the provisions of the immediately preceding section on perishables if the seller 
gives no instructions within a reasonable time after notification of rejection the buyer 
may store the rejected goods for the seller’s account or reship them to him or resell them 
for the seller’s account with reimbursement as provided in the preceding section. Such 
action is not acceptance or conversion.
§ 2–605. Waiver of Buyer’s Objections by Failure to Particularize
(1) The buyer’s failure to state in connection with rejection a particular defect which 
is ascertainable by reasonable inspection precludes him from relying on the unstated 
defect to justify rejection or to establish breach
(a) where the seller could have cured it if stated seasonably; or
(b) between merchants when the seller has after rejection made a request in writ-
ing for a full and final written statement of all defects on which the buyer 
proposes to rely.
(2) Payment against documents made without reservation of rights precludes recovery 
of the payment for defects apparent on the face of the documents.
§ 2–606. What Constitutes Acceptance of Goods
(1) Acceptance of goods occurs when the buyer
(a) after a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods signifies to the seller that 
the goods are conforming or that he will take or retain them in spite of their 
nonconformity; or
(b) fails to make an effective rejection (subsection (1) of Section 2–602), but such 
acceptance does not occur until the buyer has had a reasonable opportunity 
to inspect them; or

866  Appendix B
(c) does any act inconsistent with the seller’s ownership; but if such act is wrong-
ful as against the seller it is an acceptance only if ratified by him.
(2) Acceptance of a part of any commercial unit is acceptance of that entire unit.
§ 2–607. Effect of Acceptance; Notice of Breach; Burden of Establishing Breach 
after Acceptance; Notice of Claim or Litigation to Person Answerable Over
(1) The buyer must pay at the contract rate for any goods accepted.
(2) Acceptance of goods by the buyer precludes rejection of the goods accepted and 
if made with knowledge of a nonconformity cannot be revoked because of it unless the 
acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the nonconformity would be season-
ably cured; but acceptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this 
Article for nonconformity.
(3) Where a tender has been accepted
(a) the buyer must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have dis-
covered any breach notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy; 
and
(b) if the claim is one for infringement or the like (subsection (3) of Section 
2–312) and the buyer is sued as a result of such a breach he must so notify 
the seller within a reasonable time after he receives notice of the litigation or 
be barred from any remedy over for liability established by the litigation.
(4) The burden is on the buyer to establish any breach with respect to the goods 
accepted.
(5) Where the buyer is sued for breach of a warranty or other obligation for which 
his seller is answerable over
(a) he may give his seller written notice of the litigation. If the notice states that 
the seller may come in and defend and that if the seller does not do so he 
will be bound in any action against him by his buyer by any determination 
of fact common to the two litigations, then unless the seller after seasonable 
receipt of the notice does come in and defend he is so bound.
(b) if the claim is one for infringement or the like (subsection (3) of Section 
2–312) the original seller may demand in writing that his buyer turn over to 
him control of the litigation including settlement or else be barred from any 
remedy over and if he also agrees to bear all expense and to satisfy any 
adverse judgment, then unless the buyer after seasonable receipt of the 
demand does turn over control the buyer is so barred.
(6) The provisions of subsection (3), (4), and (5) apply to any obligation of a buyer 
to hold the seller harmless against infringement or the like (subsection (3) of Section 
2–312).
§ 2–608. Revocation of Acceptance in Whole or in Part
(1) The buyer may revoke his acceptance of a lot or commercial unit whose non-
conformity substantially impairs its value to him if he has accepted it
(a) on the reasonable assumption that its nonconformity would be cured and it 
has not been seasonably cured; or

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  867
(b) without discovery of such nonconformity if his acceptance was reasonably 
induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance or by the 
seller’s assurances.
(2) Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the buyer dis-
covers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in 
condition of the goods which is not caused by their own defects. It is not effective until 
the buyer notifies the seller of it.
(3) A buyer who so revokes has the same rights and duties with regard to the goods 
involved as if he had rejected them.
§ 2–609. Right to Adequate Assurance of Performance
(1) A contract for sale imposes an obligation on each party that the other’s expecta-
tion of receiving due performance will not be impaired. When reasonable grounds for 
insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party the other may in writing 
demand adequate assurance of due performance and until he receives such assurance 
may if commercially reasonable suspend any performance for which he has not already 
received the agreed return.
(2) Between merchants the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy 
of any assurance offered shall be determined according to commercial standards.
(3) Acceptance of any improper delivery or payment does not prejudice the aggrieved 
party’s right to demand adequate assurance of future performance.
(4) After receipt of a justified demand failure to provide within a reasonable time not 
exceeding 30 days such assurance of due performance as is adequate under the circum-
stances of the particular case is a repudiation of the contract.
§ 2–610. Anticipatory Repudiation
When either party repudiates the contract with respect to a performance not yet due the loss of 
which will substantially impair the value of the contract to the other, the aggrieved party may
(a) for a commercially reasonable time await performance by the repudiating 
party; or
(b) resort to any remedy for breach (Section 2–703 or Section 2–711), even 
though he has notified the repudiating party that he would await the latter’s 
performance and has urged retraction; and
(c) in either case suspend his own performance or proceed in accordance with the 
provisions of this Article on the seller’s right to identify goods to the contract 
notwithstanding breach or to salvage unfinished goods (Section 2–704).
§ 2–611. Retraction of Anticipatory Repudiation
(1) Until the repudiating party’s next performance is due he can retract his repudiation 
unless the aggrieved party has since the repudiation cancelled or materially changed his 
position or otherwise indicated that he considers the repudiation final.
(2) Retraction may be by any method which clearly indicates to the aggrieved party 
that the repudiating party intends to perform, but must include any assurance justifiably 
demanded under the provisions of this Article (Section 2–609).

868  Appendix B
(3) Retraction reinstates the repudiating party’s rights under the contract with due 
excuse and allowance to the aggrieved party for any delay occasioned by the repudiation.
§ 2–612. “Installment Contract”; Breach
(1) An “installment contract” is one which requires or authorizes the delivery of 
goods in separate lots to be separately accepted, even though the contract contains a 
clause “each delivery is a separate contract” or its equivalent.
(2) The buyer may reject any installment which is nonconforming if the nonconform-
ity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured or if the 
nonconformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the nonconformity does not 
fall within subsection (3) and the seller gives adequate assurance of its cure the buyer 
must accept that installment.
(3) Whenever nonconformity or default with respect to one or more installments sub-
stantially impairs the value of the whole contract there is a breach of the whole. But the 
aggrieved party reinstates the contract if he accepts a nonconforming installment without 
seasonably notifying of cancellation or if he brings an action with respect only to past 
installments or demands performance as to future installments.
§ 2–613. Casualty to Identified Goods
Where the contract requires for its performance goods identified when the contract is made, 
and the goods suffer casualty without fault of either party before the risk of loss passes to the 
buyer, or in a proper case under a “no arrival, no sale” term (Section 2–324) then
(a) if the loss is total the contract is avoided; and
(b) if the loss is partial or the goods have so deteriorated as no longer to con-
form to the contract the buyer may nevertheless demand inspection and at 
his option either treat the contract as voided or accept the goods with due 
allowance from the contract price for the deterioration or the deficiency in 
quantity but without further right against the seller.
§ 2–614. Substituted Performance
(1) Where without fault of either party the agreed berthing, loading, or unloading 
facilities fail or an agreed type of carrier becomes unavailable or the agreed manner of 
delivery otherwise becomes commercially impracticable but a commercially reasonable 
substitute is available, such substitute performance must be tendered and accepted.
(2) If the agreed means or manner of payment fails because of domestic or foreign 
governmental regulation, the seller may withhold or stop delivery unless the buyer pro-
vides a means or manner of payment which is commercially a substantial equivalent. If 
delivery has already been taken, payment by the means or in the manner provided by 
the regulation discharges the buyer’s obligation unless the regulation is discriminatory, 
oppressive, or predatory.
§ 2–615. Excuse by Failure of Presupposed Conditions
Except so far as a seller may have assumed a greater obligation and subject to the pre-
ceding section on substituted performance,

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  869
(a) delay in delivery or nondelivery in whole or in part by a seller who complies 
with paragraphs (b) and (c) is not a breach of his duty under a contract for 
sale if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence 
of a contingency the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on 
which the contract was made or by compliance in good faith with any appli-
cable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order whether or not it 
later proves to be invalid.
(b) where the causes mentioned in paragraph (a) affect only a part of the seller’s 
capacity to perform, he must allocate production and deliveries among his 
customers but may at his option include regular customers not then under con-
tract as well as his own requirements for further manufacture. He may so allo-
cate in any manner which is fair and reasonable.
(c) the seller must notify the buyer seasonably that there will be delay or non-
delivery and, when allocation is required under paragraph (b), of the esti-
mated quota thus made available for the buyer.
§ 2–616. Procedure on Notice Claiming Excuse
(1) Where the buyer receives notification of a material or indefinite delay or an allo-
cation justified under the preceding section he may by written notification to the seller 
as to any delivery concerned, and where the prospective deficiency substantially impairs 
the value of the whole contract under the provisions of this Article relating to breach of 
installment contracts (Section 2–612), then also as to the whole,
(a) terminate and thereby discharge any unexecuted portion of the contract; or
(b) modify the contract by agreeing to take his available quota in substitution.
(2) If after receipt of such notification from the seller the buyer fails so to modify 
the contract within a reasonable time not exceeding 30 days the contract lapses with 
respect to any deliveries affected.
(3) The provisions of this section may not be negated by agreement except in so far 
as the seller has assumed a greater obligation under the preceding section.
Part 7. Remedies
§ 2–701. Remedies for Breach of Collateral Contracts Not Impaired
Remedies for breach of any obligation or promise collateral or ancillary to a contract for 
sale or not impaired by the provisions of this Article.
§ 2–702. Seller’s Remedies on Discovery of Buyer’s Insolvency
(1) Where the seller discovers the buyer to be insolvent he may refuse delivery except 
for cash including payment for all goods therefore delivered under the contract, and stop 
delivery under this Article (Section 2–705).
(2) Where the seller discovers that the buyer has received goods on credit while insol-
vent he may reclaim the goods upon demand made within 10 days after the receipt, but 
if misrepresentation of solvency has been made to the particular seller in writing within 
three months before delivery the 10-day limitation does not apply. Except as provided in 
this subsection the seller may not base a right to reclaim goods on the buyer’s fraud-
ulent or innocent misrepresentation of solvency or of intent to pay.

870  Appendix B
(3) The seller’s right to reclaim under subsection (2) is subject to the rights of a buyer 
in ordinary course or other good-faith purchaser under this Article (Section 2–403). Suc-
cessful reclamation of goods excludes all other remedies with respect to them.
§ 2–703. Seller’s Remedies in General
Where the buyer wrongfully rejects or revokes acceptance of goods or fails to make a pay-
ment due on or before delivery or repudiates with respect to a part or the whole, then with 
respect to any goods directly affected and, if the breach is of the whole contract (Section 
2–612), then also with respect to the whole undelivered balance, the aggrieved seller may
(a) withhold delivery of such goods;
(b) stop delivery by any bailee as hereafter provided (Section 2–705);
(c) proceed under the next section respecting goods still unidentified to the contract;
(d) resell and recover damages as hereafter provided (Section 2–706);
(e) recover damages for nonacceptance (Section 2–708) or in a proper case the 
price (Section 2–709);
(f) cancel.
§ 2–704. Seller’s Right to Identify Goods to the Contract Notwithstanding Breach 
or to Salvage Unfinished Goods
(1) An aggrieved seller under the preceding section may
(a) identify to the contract conforming goods not already identified if at the time 
he learned of the breach they are in his possession or control;
(b) treat as the subject of resale goods which have demonstrably been intended 
for the particular contract even though those goods are unfinished.
(2) Where the goods are unfinished an aggrieved seller may in the exercise of rea-
sonable commercial judgment for the purposes of avoiding loss and of effective realiza-
tion either complete the manufacture and wholly identify the goods to the contract or 
cease manufacture and resell for scrap or salvage value or proceed in any other reason-
able manner.
§ 2–705. Seller’s Stoppage of Delivery in Transit or Otherwise
(1) The seller may stop delivery of goods in the possession of a carrier or other bailee 
when he discovers the buyer to be insolvent (Section 2–702) and may stop delivery of 
carload, truckload, planeload, or larger shipments of express or freight when the buyer 
repudiates or fails to make a payment due before delivery or if for any other reason the 
seller has a right to withhold or reclaim the goods.
(2) As against such buyer the seller may stop delivery until
(a) receipt of the goods by the buyer; or
(b) acknowledgment to the buyer by any bailee of the goods except a carrier that 
the bailee holds the goods for the buyer; or
(c) such acknowledgment to the buyer by a carrier by reshipment or as ware-
houseman; or
(d) negotiation to the buyer of any negotiable document of title covering the 
goods.

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  871
(3) (a)  To stop delivery the seller must so notify as to enable the bailee by reason-
able diligence to prevent delivery of the goods.
(b) After such notification the bailee must hold and deliver the goods according 
to the directions of the seller, but the seller is liable to the bailee for any ensu-
ing charges or damages.
(c) If a negotiable document of title has been issued for goods, the bailee is not 
obliged to obey a notification to stop until surrender of the document.
(d) A carrier who has issued a nonnegotiable bill of lading is not obliged to obey 
a notification to stop received from a person other than the consignor.
§ 2–706. Seller’s Resale Including Contract for Resale
(1) Under the conditions stated in Section 2–703 on seller’s remedies, the seller may 
resell the goods concerned or the undelivered balance thereof. Where the resale is made 
in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner the seller may recover the dif-
ference between the resale price and the contract price together with any incidental dam-
ages allowed under the provisions of this Article (Section 2–710), but less expenses saved 
in consequence of the buyer’s breach.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (3) or unless otherwise agreed resale may 
be at public or private sale including sale by way of one or more contracts to sell or of 
identification to an existing contract of the seller. Sale may be as a unit or in parcels and 
at any time and place and on any terms but every aspect of the sale including the method, 
manner, time, place, and terms must be commercially reasonable. The resale must be reason-
ably identified as referring to the broken contract, but it is not necessary that the goods be 
in existence or that any or all of them have been identified to the contract before the breach.
(3) Where the resale is at private sale the seller must give the buyer reasonable noti-
fication of his intention to resell.
(4) Where the resale is at public sale
(a) only identified goods can be sold except where there is a recognized market 
for a public sale of futures in goods of the kind; and
(b) it must be made at a usual place or market for public sale if one is reason-
ably available and except in the case of goods which are perishable or threaten 
to decline in value speedily the seller must give the buyer reasonable notice 
of the time and place of the resale; and
(c) if the goods are not to be within the view of those attending the sale the noti-
fication of sale must state the place where the goods are located and provide 
for their reasonable inspection by prospective bidders; and
(d) the seller may buy.
(5) A purchaser who buys in good faith at a resale takes the goods free of any rights 
of the original buyer even though the seller fails to comply with one or more of the 
requirements of this section.
(6) The seller is not accountable to the buyer for any profit made on any resale. A 
person in the position of a seller (Section 2–707) or a buyer who has rightfully rejected 
or justifiably revoked acceptance must account for any excess over the amount of his 
security interest, as hereinafter defined (subsection (3) of Section 2–711).

872  Appendix B
§ 2–707. “Person in the Position of a Seller”
(1) A “person in the position of a seller” includes as against a principal an agent who 
has paid or become responsible for the price of goods on behalf of his principal or anyone 
who otherwise holds a security interest or other right in goods similar to that of a seller.
(2) A person in the position of a seller may as provided in this Article withhold or 
stop delivery (Section 2–705) and resell (Section 2–706) and recover incidental damages 
(Section 2–710).
§ 2–708. Seller’s Damages for Nonacceptance or Repudiation
(1) Subject to subsection (2) and to the provisions of this Article with respect to proof 
of market price (Section 2–723), the measure of damages for nonacceptance or repudiation 
by the buyer is the difference between the market price at the time and place for ten-
der and the unpaid contract price together with any incidental damages provided in this 
Article (Section 2–710), but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer’s breach.
(2) if the measure of damages provided in subsection (1) is inadequate to put the 
seller in as good a position as performance would have done then the measure of dam-
ages is the profit (including reasonable overhead) which the seller would have made from 
full performance by the buyer, together with any incidental damages provided in this 
Article (Section 2–710), due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for 
payments or proceeds of resale.
§ 2–709. Action for the Price
(1) When the buyer fails to pay the price as it becomes due the seller may recover, 
together with any incidental damages under the next section, the price
(a) of goods accepted or of conforming goods lost or damaged within a com-
mercially reasonable time after risk of their loss has passed to the buyer; and
(b) of goods identified to the contract if the seller is unable after reasonable effort 
to resell them at a reasonable price or the circumstances reasonably indicate 
that such effort will be unavailing.
(2) Where the seller sues for the price he must hold for the buyer any goods which 
have been identified to the contract and are still in his control except that if resale 
becomes possible he may resell them at any time prior to the collection of the judgment. 
The net proceeds of any such resale must be credited to the buyer, and payment of the 
judgment entitles him to any goods not resold.
(3) After the buyer has wrongfully rejected or revoked acceptance of the goods or 
has failed to make a payment due or has repudiated (Section 2–610), a seller who is held 
not entitled to the price under this section shall nevertheless be awarded damages for 
nonacceptance under the preceeding section.
§ 2–710. Seller’s Incidental Damages
Incidental damages to an aggrieved seller include any commercially reasonable charges, 
expenses, or commissions incurred in stopping delivery, in the transportation, care, and 
custody of goods after the buyer’s breach in connection with return or resale of the goods, 
or otherwise resulting from the breach.

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  873
§ 2–711. Buyer’s Remedies in General; Buyer’s Security Interest in Rejected Goods
(1) Where the seller fails to make delivery or repudiates or the buyer rightfully rejects 
or justifiably revokes acceptance then with respect to any goods involved, and with 
respect to the whole if the breach goes to the whole contract (Section 2–612), the buyer 
may cancel and whether or not he has done so may in addition to recovering so much 
of the price as has been paid
(a) “cover” and have damages under the next section as to all the goods affected 
whether or not they have been identified to the contract; or
(b) recover damages for nondelivery as provided in this Article (Section 2–713).
(2) Where the seller fails to deliver or repudiates the buyer may also
(a) if the goods have been identified recover them as provided in this Article 
 (Section 2–502); or
(b) in a proper case obtain specific performance or replevy the goods as provided 
in this Article (Section 2–716).
(3) On rightful rejection of justifiable revocation of acceptance a buyer has a secu-
rity interest in goods in his possession or control for any payments made on their price 
and any expenses reasonably incurred in their inspection, receipt, transportation, care, 
and custody and may hold such goods and resell them in like manner as an aggrieved 
seller (Section 2–706).
§ 2–712. “Cover”; Buyer’s Procurement of Substitute Goods
(1) After a breach within the preceding section the buyer may “cover” by making in 
good faith and without unreasonable delay any reasonable purchase of or contract to pur-
chase goods in substitution for those due from the seller.
(2) The buyer may recover from the seller as damages the difference between the cost 
of cover and the contract price together with any incidental or consequential damages as 
hereinafter defined (Section 2–715), but less expenses saved in consequence of the 
seller’s breach.
(3) Failure of the buyer to effect cover within this section does not bar him from any 
other remedy.
§ 2–713. Buyer’s Damages for Nondelivery or Repudiation
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Article with respect to proof of market price (Sec-
tion 2–723), the measure of damages for nondelivery or repudiation by the seller is the 
difference between the market price at the time when the buyer learned of the breach 
and the contract price together with any incidental and consequential damages provided 
in this Article (Section 2–715), but less expenses saved in consequence of the seller’s 
breach.
(2) Market price is to be determined as of the place for tender or, in cases of rejec-
tion after arrival or revocation of acceptance, as of the place of arrival.
§ 2–714. Buyer’s Damages for Breach in Regard to Accepted Goods
(1) Where the buyer has accepted goods and given notification (subsection (3) of Sec-
tion 2–607) he may recover as damages for any nonconformity of tender the loss resulting 

874  Appendix B
in the ordinary course of events from the seller’s breach as determined in any manner 
which is reasonable.
(2) The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the difference at the time and 
place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would 
have had if they had been as warranted, unless special circumstances show proximate 
damages of a different amount.
(3) In a proper case any incidental and consequential damages under the next section 
may also be recovered.
§ 2–715. Buyer’s Incidental and Consequential Damages
(1) Incidental damages resulting from the seller’s breach include expenses reasonably 
incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation, and care and custody of goods rightfully 
rejected, any commercially reasonable charges, expenses, or commissions in connection 
with effecting cover, and any other reasonable expense incident to the delay or other breach.
(2) Consequential damages resulting from the seller’s breach include
(a) any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which 
the seller at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not 
reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise; and
(b) injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of 
warranty.
§ 2–716. Buyer’s Right to Specific Performance or Replevin
(1) Specific performance may be decreed where the goods are unique or in other 
proper circumstances.
(2) The decree for specific performance may include such terms and conditions as to 
payment of the price, damages, or other relief as the court may deem just.
(3) The buyer has a right of replevin for goods identified to the contract if after rea-
sonable effort he is unable to effect cover for such goods or the circumstances reason-
ably indicate that such effort will be unvailing or if the goods have been shipped under 
reservation and satisfaction of the security interest in them has been made or tendered. 
In the case of goods bought for personal, family, or household purposes, the buyer’s right 
of replevin vests upon acquisition of a special property, even if the seller had not then 
repudiated or failed to deliver.
§ 2–717. Deduction of Damages from the Price
The buyer on notifying the seller of his intention to do so may deduct all or any part of 
the damages resulting from any breach of the contract from any part of the price still 
due under the same contract.
§ 2–718. Liquidation or Limitation of Damages; Deposits
(1) Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only 
at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused 
by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience of nonfeasibility 
of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A team fixing unreasonably large liquidated 
damages is void as a penalty.

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  875
(2) Where the seller justifiably withholds delivery of goods because of the buyer’s 
breach, the buyer is entitled to restitution of any amount by which the sum of his  payments 
exceeds
(a) the amount to which the seller is entitled by virtue of terms liquidating the 
seller’s damages in accordance with subsection (1), or
(b) in the absence of such terms, 20 percent of the value of the total performance 
for which the buyer is obligated under the contract or $500, whichever is smaller.
(3) The buyer’s right to restitution under subsection (2) is subject to offset to the 
extent that the seller establishes
(a) a right to recover damages under the provisions of this Article other than sub-
section (1), and
(b) the amount or value of any benefits received by the buyer directly or indi-
rectly by reason of the contract.
(4) Where a seller has received payment in goods their reasonable value or the pro-
ceeds of their resale shall be treated as payments for the purposes of subsection (2); but 
if the seller has notice of the buyer’s breach before reselling goods received in part per-
formance, his resale is subject to the conditions laid down in this Article on resale by 
an aggrieved seller (Section 2–706).
§ 2–719. Contractual Modification or Limitation of Remedy
(1) Subject to the provisions of subsections (2) and (3) of this section and of the pre-
ceding section on liquidation and limitation of damages,
(a) the agreement may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for 
those provided in this Article and may limit or alter the measure of damages 
recoverable under this Article, as by limiting the buyer’s remedies to return 
of the goods and repayment of the price or to repair and replacement of non-
conforming goods or parts; and
(b) resort to a remedy as provided is optional unless the remedy is expressly 
agreed to be exclusive, in which case it is the sole remedy.
(2) Where circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential 
purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this Act.
(3) Consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclu-
sion is unconscionable. Limitation of consequential damages for injury to the person in 
the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable but limitation of damages 
where the loss is commercial is not.
§ 2–720. Effect of “Cancellation” or “Rescission” on Claims for Antecedent Breach
Unless the contrary intention clearly appears, expressions of “cancellation” or “rescission” 
of the contract or the like shall not be construed as renunciation or discharge of any 
claim in damages for an antecedent breach.
§ 2–721. Remedies for Fraud
Remedies for material misrepresentation or fraud include all remedies available under 
this Article for non-fraudulent breach. Neither rescission or a claim for rescission of the 

876  Appendix B
contract for sale nor rejection or return of the goods shall bar or be deemed inconsistent 
with a claim for damages or other remedy.
§ 2–722. Who Can Sue Third Parties for Injury to Goods
Where a third party so deals with goods which have been identified to a contract for sale as 
to cause actionable injury to a party to that contract
(a) a right of action against the third party is in either party to the contract for 
sale who has title to or a security interest or a special property or an insur-
able interest in the goods; and if the goods have been destroyed or converted 
a right of action is also in the party who either bore the risk of loss under the 
contract for sale or has since the injury assumed that risk as against the other;
(b) if at the time of the injury the party plaintiff did not bear the risk of loss as 
against the other party to the contract for sale and there is no arrangement 
between them for disposition of the recovery, his suit or settlement is, sub-
ject to his own interest, as a fiduciary for the other party to the contract;
(c) either party may with the consent of the other sue for the benefit of whom it 
may concern.
§ 2–723. Proof of Market Price: Time and Place
(1) If an action based on anticipatory repudiation comes to trial before the time for 
performance with respect to some or all of the goods, any damages based on market 
price (Section 2–708 or Section 2–713) shall be determined according to the price of 
such goods prevailing at the time when the aggrieved party learned of the repudiation.
(2) If evidence of a price prevailing at the times or places described in this Article is 
not readily available the price prevailing within any reasonable time before or after the 
time described or at any other place which in commercial judgment or under usage of 
trade would serve as a reasonable substitute for the one described may be used, making 
any proper allowance for the cost of transporting the goods to or from such other place.
(3) Evidence of a relevant price prevailing at a time or place other than the one 
described in this Article offered by one party is not admissible unless and until he has 
given the other party such notice as the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise.
§ 2–724. Admissibility of Market Quotations
Whenever the prevailing price or value of any goods regularly bought and sold in any 
 established commodity market is in issue, reports in official publications or trade jour-
nals or in newspapers or periodicals of general circulation published as the reports of 
such market shall be admissible in evidence. The circumstances of the preparation of 
such a report may be shown to affect its weight but not its admissibility.
§ 2–725. Statute of Limitations in Contracts for Sale
(1) An action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within four 
years after the cause of action has accrued. By the original agreement the parties may 
reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year but may not extend it.
(2) A cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved 
party’s lack of knowledge of the breach. A breach of warranty occurs when tender of 

Uniform Commercial Code 2000 Official Text, Article 2  877
delivery is made, except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance 
of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the 
cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.
(3) Where an action commenced within the time limited by subsection (1) is so ter-
minated as to leave available a remedy by another action for the same breach such other 
action may be commenced after the expiration of the time limited and within six months 
after the termination of the first action unless the termination resulted from voluntary 
discontinuance or from dismissal for failure or neglect to prosecute.
(4) This section does not alter the law on tolling of the statute of limitations nor does 
it apply to causes of action which have accrued before this Act becomes effective.
