Nikon D300s For Dummies 

Introduction
N
ikon. The name has been associated with top-flight photography 
equipment for generations. And the introduction of the D300s has 
only enriched Nikon’s well-deserved reputation, offering all the control a 
photographer could want — and then some. In fact, this camera offers so 
many features that sorting them all out can be more than a little confusing, 
especially if you’re new to digital photography, SLR photography, or both.
Therein lies the point of Nikon D300s For Dummies: Through this book, you 
can discover not just what each bell and whistle on your camera does, but 
also when, where, why, and how to put it to best use. And unlike many pho-
tography books, this one doesn’t require any previous knowledge of photog-
raphy or digital imaging to make sense of things. In classic For Dummies style, 
everything is explained in easy-to-understand language, with lots of illustra-
tions to help clear up any confusion.
In short, what you have in your hands is the paperback version of an in-depth 
photography workshop tailored specifically to your Nikon picture-taking 
powerhouse.
A Quick Look at What’s Ahead
This book is organized into four parts, each devoted to a different aspect of 
using your camera. Although chapters flow in a sequence that’s designed to 
take you from absolute beginner to experienced user, I’ve also tried to make 
each chapter as self-standing as possible so that you can explore the topics 
that interest you in any order you please.
The following sections offer brief previews of each part. If you’re eager to find 
details on a specific topic, the index shows you exactly where to look.
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps
Part I contains four chapters that help you get up and running.
 
✓ Chapter 1, “Getting the Lay of the Land,” offers a tour of the external 
controls on your camera, shows you how to navigate camera menus to 
access internal options, and walks you through initial camera setup and 
customization steps.
 
✓ Chapter 2, “Fast and Easy: (Almost) Automatic Photography with the 
D300s,” explains how to enjoy something close to point-and-shoot sim-
plicity by using the programmed autoexposure mode. It also covers 
such basics as selecting the Release mode and enabling flash.

2
Nikon D300s For Dummies 
 
✓ Chapter 3, “Controlling Picture Quality and Size,” introduces you to two 
critical camera settings: Image Size and Image Quality, which control 
resolution (pixel count), file format, file size, and picture quality.
 
✓ Chapter 4, “Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie 
Recording” offers just what its title implies. Look here to find out how to 
review and erase photos, take pictures in Live View mode, and record 
and edit HD movies.
Part II: Taking Creative Control
The chapters in this part help you unleash the full creative power of your 
camera.
 
✓ Chapter 5, “Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting,” covers the 
all-important topic of exposure, starting with a review of the basics 
and then detailing every exposure option from metering modes to flash 
modes.
 
✓ Chapter 6, “Manipulating Focus and Color,” provides help with controlling 
those aspects of your pictures. Head here for information about your cam-
era’s many autofocusing options, for tips on how to manipulate depth of 
field, and for details about color controls such as white balance.
 
✓ Chapter 7, “Putting It All Together,” summarizes all the techniques 
explained in earlier chapters, providing a quick-reference guide to the 
camera settings and shooting strategies that produce the best results 
for specific types of pictures: portraits, action shots, landscape scenes, 
and close-ups.
Part III: Working with Picture Files
This part of the book, as its title implies, discusses the often-confusing aspect 
of moving your pictures from camera to computer and beyond.
 
✓ Chapter 8, “Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files,” 
guides you through the process of transferring pictures from your 
camera memory card to your computer. Look here, too, for details about 
using the camera’s built-in tool for processing files that you shoot in the 
Nikon RAW format (NEF). 
 
✓ Chapter 9, “Printing and Sharing Your Pictures,” helps you turn your 
digital files into “hard copies” that look as good as those you see on 
the camera monitor. This chapter also explains how to prepare your 
pictures for online sharing, create digital slide shows, and, for times 
when you have the neighbors over, display your pictures and movies 
on a television screen.

3
 Introduction
Part IV: The Part of Tens
In famous For Dummies tradition, the book concludes with two “top ten” lists 
containing additional bits of information and advice.
 
✓ Chapter 10, “Ten More Ways to Customize Your Camera,” details options 
that let you tweak the behavior of certain camera buttons and dials, set 
up custom filenaming, and otherwise make the camera bow to your per-
sonal preferences.
 
✓ Chapter 11, “Ten Features to Explore on a Rainy Day,” presents informa-
tion about some camera features that, while not found on most “Top Ten 
Reasons I Bought My D300s” lists, are nonetheless interesting, useful on 
occasion, or a bit of both.
Icons and Other Stuff to Note
If this isn’t your first For Dummies book, you may be familiar with the large, 
round icons that decorate its margins. If not, here’s your very own icon-
decoder ring: 
 
✓ A Tip icon flags information that will save you time, effort, money, or 
some other valuable resource, including your sanity. Tips also point 
out techniques that help you get the best results from specific camera 
features.
 
✓ When you see this icon, look alive. It indicates a potential danger zone 
that can result in much wailing and teeth-gnashing if ignored. In other 
words, this is stuff that you really don’t want to learn the hard way.
 
✓ Lots of information in this book is of a technical nature — digital 
photography is a technical animal, after all. But if I present a detail 
that is useful mainly for impressing your technology-geek friends, I 
mark it with this icon.
 
✓ I apply this icon either to introduce information that is especially 
worth storing in your brain’s long-term memory or to remind you of a 
fact that may have been displaced from that memory by some other 
pressing fact.
Additionally, I need to point out other details that will help you use this book:

Nikon D300s For Dummies 
 
✓ Other margin art: Replicas of some of your camera’s buttons and on-
screen symbols also appear in the margins of some paragraphs. I include 
these to provide a quick reminder of the appearance of the feature being 
discussed. 
 
✓ Software used in this book: Providing specific instructions for perform-
ing photo organizing and editing tasks requires that I feature specific 
software. In sections that cover file downloading, printing, and e-mail 
sharing, I selected Nikon ViewNX and Nikon Transfer, both of which ship 
free with your camera and work on both the Windows and Mac operat-
ing systems. Rest assured, though, that the tools used in ViewNX and 
Nikon Transfer work very similarly in other programs, so you should be 
able to adapt the steps to whatever software you use. (I recommend that 
you read your software manual for details, of course.)
 
✓ Software menu commands: In sections that cover software, a series 
of words connected by an arrow indicates commands that you choose 
from the program menus. For example, if a step tells you to “Choose 
File➪Convert Files,” click the File menu to unfurl it and then click the 
Convert Files command on the menu.
Practice, Be Patient, and Have Fun!
To wrap up this preamble, I want to stress that if you initially think that 
digital photography is too confusing or too technical for you, you’re in very 
good company. Everyone finds this stuff a little mind-boggling at first. So take 
it slowly, experimenting with just one or two new camera settings or tech-
niques at first. Then, each time you go on a photo outing, make it a point to 
add one or two more shooting skills to your repertoire. 
I know that it’s hard to believe when you’re just starting out, but it really 
won’t be long before everything starts to come together. With some time, 
patience, and practice, you’ll soon wield your camera like a pro, dialing in the 
necessary settings to capture your creative vision almost instinctively.
So without further ado, I invite you to grab your camera, a cup of whatever it 
is you prefer to sip while you read, and start exploring the rest of this book. 
Your D300s is the perfect partner for your photographic journey, and I thank 
you for allowing me, through this book, to serve as your tour guide.

Part I
Fast Track to 
Super Snaps

In this part . . .
M
aking sense of all the controls on your 
D300s isn’t something you can do in an 
afternoon — heck, in a week, or maybe even a 
month. But with the help of the chapters in this 
part, you can start taking great pictures right 
away.
Chapter 1 addresses some basic setup steps, such 
as adjusting the viewﬁ nder to your eyesight and 
getting familiar with the camera menus, buttons, 
and dials. Chapter 2 helps you set up your camera 
for the easiest possible operation and take your 
ﬁ rst shots, and Chapter 3 explains how you can 
control picture quality and ﬁ le size. Wrapping up 
this part, Chapter 4 shows you how to use your 
camera’s picture-playback, Live View, and movie-
recording features.

Getting the Lay of the Land
In This Chapter
▶ Attaching and using an SLR lens
▶ Adjusting the viewfinder to your eyesight
▶ Selecting from menus
▶ Working with memory cards
▶ Getting acquainted with your camera
▶ Customizing basic operations
I
still remember the day that I bought my first SLR film camera. I was 
excited to finally move up from my one-button point-and-shoot camera, 
but I was a little anxious, too. My new pride and joy sported several unfamil-
iar buttons and dials, and the explanations in the camera manual 
clearly were written for someone with an engineering degree. 
And then there was the whole business of attaching the 
lens to the camera, an entirely new task for me. I saved 
up my pennies a long time for that camera — what 
if my inexperience caused me to damage the thing 
before I even shot my first pictures?
You may be feeling similarly insecure if your Nikon 
D300s is your first SLR, although some of the but-
tons on the camera back may look familiar if you’ve 
previously used a digital point-and-shoot camera. 
If your D300s is both your first SLR and first digital 
camera, you may be doubly intimidated.
Trust me, though, that your camera isn’t nearly as 
complicated as its exterior makes it appear. With a little 
practice and the help of this chapter, which introduces you to 
each external control, you’ll quickly become as comfortable with your 
camera’s buttons and dials as you are with the ones on your car’s dashboard. 
This chapter also guides you through the process of mounting and using 
an SLR lens, working with digital memory cards, navigating your camera’s 
menus, and customizing basic camera operations.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Looking at Lenses
One of the biggest differences between a point-and-shoot camera and an SLR 
(single-lens reflex) camera is the lens. With an SLR, you can swap out lenses 
to suit different photographic needs, going from an extreme close-up lens to 
a super-long telephoto, for example. In addition, an SLR lens has a movable 
focusing ring that gives you the option of focusing manually instead of relying 
on the camera’s autofocus mechanism.
Digital SLR lenses are incredibly complex pieces of optical equipment. I don’t 
have room in this book to go into a lot of detail about the science of lenses, 
nor do I think that an in-depth knowledge of the subject is terribly important 
to your photographic success. But the next few sections share a couple of tid-
bits that may be of help when you’re first getting acquainted with your lens, 
shopping for lenses, or trying to figure out whether the bag of old lenses you 
inherited from your uncle Ted or found on eBay will work with your D300s.
Checking lens compatibility
 
You can mount a wide range of lenses on your D300s. But some lenses aren’t 
fully compatible with all camera features. For example, with some lenses, you 
can’t take advantage of the autofocusing system and must focus manually 
instead.
Your camera manual has a complete listing of all the lens types that can be 
mounted on the D300s and explains what features are supported with each 
type. But for maximum compatibility, look for these types: Type D or G AF 
Nikkor, AF-S Nikkor, or AF-I Nikkor. (The latter is an older, expensive profes-
sional lens that is no longer sold but might be available on the resale market.)
All the aforementioned lens types (as well as some others) offer CPU (central 
processing unit) technology, which allows the lens to talk to the camera. 
This feature is critical to getting maximum performance from the autofocus-
ing system, exposure metering system, and so on. That’s not to say that you 
can’t use a non-CPU lens; you just lose the option of using some camera fea-
tures. An option on the Setup menu helps you get the most functionality pos-
sible with a non-CPU lens; check out the section “Cruising the Setup menu,” 
toward the end of this chapter, for details.
The information in this book assumes that you are using a CPU lens that sup-
ports all the camera’s functions. If your lens doesn’t meet that criteria, be 
sure to check the camera manual for specifics on what features are unavail-
able or need to be implemented differently.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Factoring in the crop factor
Every lens can be characterized by its focal length, which is measured in mil-
limeters. Focal length determines the camera’s angle of view, the apparent 
size and distance of objects in the scene, and depth of field (how much of the 
scene can be rendered in sharp focus).
According to photography tradition, a focal length of 50mm is described as a 
“normal” lens. Most point-and-shoot cameras feature this focal length, which 
is a medium-range lens that works well for the type of snapshots that users 
of those kinds of cameras are likely to shoot. A lens with a focal length under 
35mm is characterized as a wide-angle lens because at that focal length, the 
camera has a wide angle of view and produces a large depth of field, making 
it good for landscape photography. A short focal length also has the effect 
of making objects seem smaller and farther away. At the other end of the 
spectrum, a lens with a focal length longer than 80mm is considered a tele-
photo lens and often referred to as a long lens. With a long lens, angle of view 
narrows, depth of field decreases, and faraway subjects appear closer and 
larger, which is ideal for wildlife and sports photographers.
 
It’s important to know, however, that when you mount a lens on the D300s, 
the angle of view is different than the lens’ stated focal length. This variation, 
which holds true for most digital cameras, occurs because of the difference 
in size between a 35mm film negative — the standard around which lens focal 
lengths are measured — and the size of an image sensor, which is the light-
sensitive component of a digital camera.
With a D300s, the effective angle of view is equivalent to that produced by a 
focal length about 1.5 times the actual focal length. For example, a 50mm lens 
on the D300s produces the same angle of view as a 75mm lens on a 35mm film 
camera. (50 x 1.5 = 75.)
The end result is the same 
as if you shot a photo with 
your film camera and then 
cropped away some of the 
perimeter, as illustrated in 
Figure 1-1. For this reason, 
the value used to calcu-
late the effective angle of 
view — 1.5 on the D300s, 
but it varies from camera 
to camera — is sometimes 
called a camera’s crop 
factor. You may also see 
this value referred to as 
the lens multiplier.
Figure 1-1: Like most dSLR image sensors, the one on the 
D300s can’t capture the entire angle of view that the lens 
can “see” when mounted on a 35mm film camera.

10
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Although the area the lens can capture changes when you move a lens from 
a 35mm film camera to a digital body, depth of field isn’t affected, nor are the 
spatial relationships between objects in the frame. So when lens shopping, you 
gauge those two characteristics by looking at the stated lens focal length — no 
film-to-digital conversion math is required.
Getting shake-free shots with vibration 
reduction (VR) lenses
Some Nikon lenses, including the one featured in this book, offer a feature 
called vibration reduction. On Nikon lenses, this feature is indicated by the 
initials VR in the lens name. If you use a non-Nikon lens, the feature may go 
by another name: anti-shake, vibration compensation, and so on.
Whatever the name, the feature attempts to compensate for small amounts 
of camera shake that can occur when you handhold your camera and use 
a slow shutter speed, a lens with a long focal length, or both. Even a small 
amount of camera movement can produce blurry images, so vibration reduc-
tion is a definite Good Thing. Although it can’t work miracles, it does enable 
most people to capture sharper handheld shots in many situations than they 
otherwise could. Note that VR is only designed to avoid the blur caused by 
camera movement, though; if your subject is moving, it may appear blurry 
due to a too-slow shutter speed. You can explore that issue in Chapter 5.
Here are the basics you need to know about using vibration reduction with 
Nikon lenses:
 
✓ For handheld shooting, set the VR switch to the On position, as shown 
in Figure 1-2. Now vibration reduction will engage whenever you press 
the shutter button halfway as well as just after you press the button all 
the way to take the picture. You may notice some slight movement of the 
scene in the viewfinder while the VR mechanism does its thing.
 
✓ Check your lens manual for recommendations about disabling VR for 
tripod shooting. When you use a tripod, vibration reduction can have 
detrimental effects because the system may try to adjust for move-
ment that isn’t actually occurring. So for some of its VR lenses, Nikon 
recommends setting the switch to the Off position for tripod shooting, 
assuming that the tripod is “locked down” so the camera is immovable. 
Some lenses offer a tripod-detection feature, however, that is specially 
designed for tripod shooting. To get the specifics for your lens, dig out 
your lens manual.
If you use a non-Nikon lens, check your lens manual to find out whether the 
manufacturer recommends disabling the anti-shake feature for tripod shoot-
ing and whether the lens offers a choice of vibration-reduction modes. Also, 

11
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
some lenses have additional options that switch between different types of 
stabilization (the switch may be called Active/Normal or something similar); 
again, refer to the lens manual for specifics.
Vibration Reduction switch
Figure 1-2: Vibration reduction can enable you to get sharper handheld shots.
Attaching and removing lenses
Whatever lens you choose, follow these steps to attach it to the camera body:
 
1. Remove the cap that covers the lens mount on the front of the camera.
 
2. Remove the cap that covers the back of the lens.
 
3. Hold the lens in front of the camera so that the little white dot on the 
lens aligns with the matching dot on the camera body.
 
 Official photography lingo uses the term mounting index instead of little 
white dot. Either way, you can see the markings in question in Figure 1-3.

12
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 The figure (and others in this 
book) shows you the D300s with 
an 18–55mm AF-S VR Nikon lens. 
If you buy a lens from a manu-
facturer other than Nikon, your 
dot may be red or some other 
color, so check the lens instruc-
tion manual.
 
4. Keeping the dots aligned, posi-
tion the lens on the camera’s 
lens mount.
 
 When you do so, grip the lens 
by its back collar, not the mov-
able, forward end of the lens 
barrel.
 
5. Turn the lens in a counter-
clockwise direction until the 
lens clicks into place.
 
 To put it another way, turn 
the lens toward the side of the 
camera that sports the shutter 
button, as indicated by the red 
arrow in the figure. 
 
6. On a CPU lens that has an 
aperture ring, set and lock the 
ring so the aperture is set at the 
highest f-stop number.
 
 Check your lens manual to find out whether your lens sports an aperture 
ring and how to adjust it. To find out more about apertures and f-stops, 
see Chapter 5.
To detach a lens from the camera body, take these steps:
 
1. Locate the lens-release button, labeled in Figure 1-3.
 
2. Press the lens-release button while turning the lens clockwise (away 
from the shutter button) until the mounting index on the lens is 
aligned with the index on the camera body.
Mounting index dots
Lens-release button
Figure 1-3: When attaching the lens, align the 
index markers as shown here.

13
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
 Again, the mounting indexes are the little guide dots labeled in Figure 
1-3. When the dots line up, the lens should detach from the mount. 
 
3. Place the rear protective cap onto the back of the lens.
 
 If you aren’t putting another lens on the camera, cover the lens mount 
with the protective cap that came with your camera, too.
 
Always attach and remove lenses in a clean environment to reduce the risk of 
getting dust, dirt, and other contaminants inside the camera or lens. For 
added safety, point the camera body slightly down when performing this 
maneuver; doing so helps prevent any flotsam in the air from being drawn 
into the camera by gravity.
Setting the focus mode (auto or manual)
In addition to the lens-related features covered in the preceding sections, 
make note of the following two controls, which you use to set the focusing 
method to manual or autofocusing:
 
✓ Lens focus mode switch: Assuming that your lens offers autofocusing 
as well as manual focusing, it likely has a switch that you use to choose 
between the two options. The switch might be labeled A/M, as shown 
in Figure 1-4, or AF/MF. Some lenses offer a setting called AF/M (or 
something similar), which enables you to set initial focus using autofo-
cusing and then refine focus manually. (This feature is typically called 
autofocus with manual override.) Check your lens manual for specifics, 
and check the Nikon manual to confirm that your lens can autofocus 
with the D300s.
 
 Your lens also has a focusing ring that you twist to bring the scene into 
focus when you use manual focusing. The placement of the focusing ring 
varies from lens to lens; Figure 1-4 shows the ring as it appears on the 
Nikon 18–55mm AF-S VR lens.
 
✓ Focus mode selector: Also shown in Figure 1-4, this switch sets the cam-
era’s internal focusing mechanism to manual focusing (M) or one of two 
autofocusing options (C and S).
 
 Chapter 2 provides focusing basics; Chapter 6 details the myriad auto-
focusing options on your camera and offers a few manual-focusing tips 
as well.

Adjusting the Viewfinder Focus
Tucked behind the right side of the rubber eyepiece that surrounds the view-
finder is a tiny dial called a diopter control. With this control, labeled in Figure 
1-5, you can adjust the focus of your viewfinder to accommodate your eyesight.
 
If you don’t take this step, scenes that appear out of focus through the view-
finder may actually be sharply focused through the lens, and vice versa. 
Here’s how to make the necessary adjustment:
 
1. Remove the lens cap from the front of the lens.
 
2. Look through the viewfinder and concentrate on the markings in the 
viewfinder frame, shown on the right side of Figure 1-5.
 
 The markings relate to focusing, which you can read more about in 
Chapters 2 and 6. Depending on your selected focus options, you may see 
only the brackets and not the little rectangle in the middle of the frame.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Diopter control
Figure 1-5: Use the diopter adjustment control to set the viewfinder focus for your eyesight.
 
3. Rotate the diopter adjustment dial until the viewfinder markings 
appear to be in focus.
 
 The Nikon manual warns you not to poke yourself in the eye as you per-
form this maneuver. This warning seems so obvious that I laugh every 
time I read it — which makes me feel doubly stupid the next time I poke 
myself in the eye as I perform this maneuver.
Ordering from Camera Menus
You access many of your camera’s features via internal menus, which, con-
veniently enough, appear when you press the Menu button. Features are 
grouped into six main menus, described briefly in Table 1-1.

After you press the Menu button, you see on the camera monitor a screen 
similar to the one shown in Figure 1-6. Along the left side of the screen, you 
see the icons shown in Table 1-1, each representing one of the available 
menus. The icon that is highlighted or appears in color is the active menu; 
options on that menu automatically appear to the right of the column of 
icons. In the figure, the Shooting menu is active, for example.
Menu icons
Multi Selector
Figure 1-6: Use the Multi Selector to navigate menus.
I explain all the important menu options elsewhere in the book; for now, 
just familiarize yourself with the process of navigating menus and selecting 
options therein. The Multi Selector, shown on the right in Figure 1-6, is the 
key to the game. Press the edges of the Multi Selector to navigate up, down, 
left, and right through the menus.
 
In this book, the instruction “Press the Multi Selector left” means to press the 
left edge of the control. “Press the Multi Selector right” means to press the 
right edge, and so on.
Here’s a bit more detail about navigating menus:

17
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
✓ Select a menu. Press the Multi Selector left to jump to the column con-
taining the menu icons. Then press up or down to highlight the menu 
you want to display. Finally, press right to jump over to the options on 
the menu.
 
✓ Select and adjust a function on the current menu. Again, use the Multi 
Selector to scroll up or down the list of options to highlight the feature 
you want to adjust and then press the OK button. Settings available for 
the selected item then appear. For example, if you select the Image Quality 
item from the Shooting menu, as shown on the left in Figure 1-7, and press 
OK, the available Image Quality options appear, as shown on the right in 
the figure. Repeat the old up-and-down scroll routine until the choice you 
prefer is highlighted. Then press OK to return to the previous screen.
Figure 1-7: Select the option you prefer and press OK again to return to the active menu.
 
 In some cases, you may see a right-pointing arrowhead instead of the 
OK symbol next to an option. That’s your cue to press the Multi Selector 
right to display a submenu or other list of options (although pressing 
OK usually works just as well).
 
 In many cases, you can press the center button of the Multi Selector 
instead of the OK button to choose menu items. But that option doesn’t 
always work, so to keep things simple in this book, I discuss just the OK 
button.
 
✓ Create a custom menu or view your 20 most recently adjusted menu 
items. The sixth menu is actually two menus bundled into one. The 
My Menu screen, shown in Figure 1-8, enables you to create your own 
custom menu that contains your favorite options. Chapter 10 details the 
steps involved in making and using your menu.
 
 Through the Choose Tab option on the menu, you can switch to the 
Recent Settings menu, shown on the right in the figure. This menu lists 
the 20 menu items you ordered most recently. So if you want to adjust 
those settings, you don’t have to wade through all the other menus 

18
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
looking for them — just head to this menu instead. The Recent Settings 
screen also contains a Choose Tab option so that you can switch back to 
the My Menu screen at any time.
 
 The menu icon changes depending on which of these two functions is 
active; Table 1-1 shows both icons.
 
✓ Save collections of menu settings in banks. The D300s gives you the 
option of creating up to four banks to store different groupings of Shooting 
menu settings. You get another four banks for storing Custom Setting 
menu settings. The banks enable you to quickly change from settings 
designed for one type of picture to options that work better for a different 
subject. Chapter 10 explains the whole process; for now, just note that 
you can see which bank is active at the top of the respective menu and 
in the Information screen, as shown in Figure 1-9. Press the Info button to 
display the Information screen; see the next section for more details.
Figure 1-8: The My Menu screen lets you design a custom menu; the Recent Settings menu 
offers quick access to the last 20 menu options you selected.
Figure 1-9: Check the menu or Information screen to see which banks are active.

Decoding the Displays
Your D300s gives you three ways to monitor the most critical picture-taking 
settings:
 
✓ Control panel: The LCD panel on top of the camera offers an array of 
shooting data, as shown on the left in Figure 1-10. The data that appears 
depends on what camera features you’re currently using.
 
 You can illuminate the panel temporarily by rotating the On/Off switch 
past the On position to the little light bulb marker, shown on the right in 
the figure, and then releasing the switch.

Figure 1-10: Rotate the On/Off switch to the light bulb position to illuminate the Control 
panel. 
 
 
✓ Information display: If your eye-
sight is like mine, making out the 
tiny type on the Control panel can 
be difficult. Fortunately, you can 
press the Info button to display 
the Information screen on the 
monitor. As shown in Figure 1-11, 
this screen displays the current 
shooting settings at a size that’s a 
little easier on the eyes. See the 
section “Customizing shooting 
and display options” for informa-
tion on how to adjust the display 
colors. You can choose a bluish 
background with dark text, or as 
shown in this book, a black back-
ground with light text. Like the

picture-taking settings on the monitor.

20
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Control panel, the Information screen data varies depending on what 
shooting settings are currently in force.
 
 The Information screen has a hidden power, too: After the screen is 
displayed, you can press Info again to activate the control strip at the 
bottom, as shown on the left in Figure 1-12. You then can quickly adjust 
any of the settings on the two rows of the strip. Use the Multi Selector to 
highlight a setting — a little tooltip (text label) appears to identify it — 
and then press OK. The camera then zips you directly to the menu con-
taining the available settings, as shown on the right in the figure. Make 
your choice and press OK again to exit the menu. You can then adjust 
another setting or press Info one more time to turn off the display.
Figure 1-12: Press the Info button while the Information screen is displayed to gain quick 
access to the settings at the bottom of the screen.
 
✓ Viewfinder: You can view some 
camera settings in the viewfinder 
as well. For example, the data in 
Figure 1-13 shows the current 
metering mode icon, shutter speed, 
f-stop, exposure mode ISO setting, 
and number of shots remaining. As 
with the other displays, the view-
finder information that appears 
depends on what action you’re 
currently undertaking.
If what you see in Figures 1-10 
through 1-13 looks like a big confus-
ing mess, don’t worry. Many of the 
settings relate to options that won’t 
mean anything to you until you make 
your way through later chapters and 
Low battery warning

Figure 1-13: You also can view some camera 
information at the bottom of the viewfinder.

21
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
explore the advanced exposure modes. But do make note of the following 
two key points of data that are helpful even when you shoot in the fully 
automatic modes:
 
✓ Battery status indicator: A full battery icon like the one in Figures 1-10 and 
1-11 shows that the battery is fully charged; if the icon appears empty, go 
look for your battery charger. When the battery gets seriously low, a warn-
ing symbol appears in the viewfinder, as shown in Figure 1-13. You can 
disable the viewfinder warning if you like; see the section “Customizing 
shooting and display options” later in this chapter for details.
 
✓ Pictures remaining: Labeled in Figures 1-10, 1-11, and 1-13, this value 
(68, in the figures) indicates how many additional pictures you can store 
on the current memory card.
 
 The value is presented a little differently if the card can hold more than 
999 pictures. The initial K appears next to the value to indicate that the 
first value represents the picture count in thousands. For example, 1.0K 
means that you can store 1,000 more pictures (K being a universally 
accepted symbol indicating 1,000 units). The number is then rounded 
down to the nearest hundred. So if the card has room for, say, 1,230 
more pictures, the value reads as 1.2K. 
 
 When no card is installed in the camera, the symbol [-E-] appears in the 
shots-remaining area of the displays. See the next section for tips about 
installing and using memory cards.
Working with Memory Cards
Instead of recording images on film, digital cameras store pictures on memory 
cards. Your D300s can use two types of memory cards, both shown in Figure 
1-14. The cards go into the slots hidden under the cover on the right side of 
the camera, as shown in Figure 1-15.
 
Always turn off the camera before inserting or removing memory cards to 
avoid potential damage to the card and the camera. And note these addi-
tional details about using and caring for your cards:
 
✓ SD (or SDHC) cards: The smaller card slot accepts an SD card (for Secure 
Digital). You can also use the new, high-capacity Secure Digital cards, 
which are labeled SDHC, as well as Eye-Fi SD cards, which enable you 
to send pictures to your computer over a wireless network. (Because of 
space limitations, I don’t cover Eye-Fi connectivity in this book; if you want 
more information about these cards, you can find it online at www.eye.fi.)
 
 Place the card in the slot with the label facing the back of the camera, 
as shown in Figure 1-15. Push the card into the slot until it clicks into 
place; the memory card access light (circled in the figure) blinks for a 

22
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
second to let you know the card 
is inserted properly. To remove 
the card, depress the memory 
card slightly until you hear a little 
click and then let go. The card 
should pop halfway out of the slot, 
enabling you to grab it by the tail 
and remove it.
 
 That little switch labeled lock 
switch in Figure 1-14 enables you 
to lock your card, which prevents 
any data from being erased or 
recorded to the card. Press the 
switch toward the bottom of the 
card to lock the card contents; 
press it toward the top of the card 
to unlock the data.
 
✓ CompactFlash (CF) cards (Type 
1 only): The second slot accepts 
this type of card, which is larger 
and thicker than SD cards. The 
D300s can use only Type 1 
CompactFlash cards, unlike its 
older sibling, the D300, which 
could use Type II CF cards as 
well as another media type 
called a MicroDrive.
 
 Again, orient the card with the 
label facing the back of the 
camera, as shown in Figure 1-15. 
Push the card firmly into the 
slot until the little gray eject 
button, labeled in the figure, 
pops up. The access light will 
illuminate when the card is cor-
rectly inserted. To remove the 
card, depress the eject button. 
The card should pop partially 
out of the slot; grab the card 
and pull it the rest of the way 
out of the camera.
 
 CompactFlash cards don’t have 
a locking switch like SD cards, 
but you can use the camera’s 
Protect feature, covered in 
Chapter 4, to prevent accidental erasure of photos stored on either 
CompactFlash or SD cards.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
Try to avoid touching the card contact areas, highlighted in Figure 1-14. On 
an SD card, the gold area on the back of the card is the sensitive area; on a 
CompactFlash card, the little pinholes on the edge of the card comprise the 
danger zone. Always store cards in the protective cases they came in or in a 
memory card wallet after removing them from the camera. Keep cards away 
from extreme heat and cold as well.
Using two cards at the same time
You can put a memory card in each slot if you choose. If you do install both 
cards, you have three choices for how the camera feeds your photo and 
movie files to the cards: 
 
✓ Overflow: The camera fills up your preferred card and then automati-
cally switches to the other one.
 
✓ Backup: The camera records each picture or movie to both cards. This 
option gives you some extra security — should one card fail, you have a 
backup on the other card.
 
✓ Raw Primary/JPEG Secondary: This option relates to the Image Quality 
option, which determines the file format of still photos. (Chapter 3 has 
details.) If you select an Image Quality setting that records the photo 
both in the RAW (NEF) format and the JPEG format, you can tell the 
camera to store all the RAW versions on one card and put the JPEGs 
on the other. If you select this option but use an Image Quality setting 
that captures only a single file type, the camera uses the Backup setting, 
sending a copy of the file to each card.
 
 The Raw Primary/JPEG Secondary option gives you an easy way to get 
your pictures to someone who doesn’t have the time or knowledge to 
deal with RAW files, which must be processed using special software or 
the in-camera converter before they can be shared online, viewed in 
many consumer photo programs, or printed at retail sites. (Chapter 8 
explains.) When you’re done shooting, just hand over the card contain-
ing the JPEG versions, which can be viewed, shared, and printed imme-
diately. Of course, unless you’re really generous, you’ll ask that someone 
to supply the card or return it after downloading the pictures.
To set up your two-card system, visit the Shooting menu. First, select the 
card you want to use as the primary file destination, as shown in Figure 1-16. 
Next, select Secondary Slot Function to access the three options for using the 
backup slot, as shown in Figure 1-17.
A couple of other critical points about using two cards:
 
✓ You can tell which secondary slot function is in force by looking at the 
Image Quality readout of the Information display, highlighted on the left in 
Figure 1-18. The little card symbols tell you what’s going where. The rect-
angular symbol represents the CompactFlash card; the symbol with the 

24
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
angled corner represents the SD card. In the figure, the symbols show that 
the camera is set up to send RAW files to the SD card and the JPEG ver-
sions to the CF card. (“Fine” represents one of three available settings for 
JPEG files, as covered in Chapter 3.) If you see the same file data for each 
card — for example, the word RAW appears in both cards — the Backup 
option is selected. And if the file type label appears in only one card, with 
the other card appearing empty, the Overflow option is selected.
 
✓ When both cards are installed, symbols representing each card also 
appear in the Control panel, as shown on the right in Figure 1-18. 
Otherwise, only the symbol for the single installed card appears. You 
can’t glean anything about the primary and secondary card functions 
from this display, however.
Figure 1-16: Use this option to specify which of the two cards should be the primary storage 
closet for your pictures.
Figure 1-17: These options tell the camera how you want to make use of your second card.

25
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Figure 1-18: These symbols represent your memory cards.
 
✓ The shots remaining value (68, in the figures) indicates how many more 
pictures you can store at your current picture-taking settings. When 
you set the second card to the Backup or RAW/JPEG option, this value 
is based on whichever card contains the least amount of free space. 
For the Overflow option, the value tells you the shots remaining for the 
primary card until you fill that card and then switches to indicate the 
amount of free space on the overflow card.
 
✓ You can copy pictures from one card to another using an option on the 
Playback menu. For details on that feature plus other playback informa-
tion, see Chapter 4.
Formatting cards
The first time you use a new memory card or insert a card that has been 
used in other devices, such as MP3 players or phones, you should format it. 
Formatting ensures that the card is properly prepared to record your pictures. 
Formatting after you download pictures to your computer is also a good idea. 
However, don’t use your computer’s file-management tools to format the 
card; the camera is better equipped to do the job.
 
Formatting erases everything on your memory card. So before formatting, be 
sure that you have copied any pictures or other data to your computer.
You can format a card in two ways:
 
 
✓ Simultaneously press and hold the Mode and Delete buttons. See the 
little red Format labels next to the buttons? They’re reminders that you 
use these buttons to quickly format a memory card. Hold the buttons 
down for about two seconds, until you see the letters For blink in the 
Control panel on top of the camera, as shown in Figure 1-19.

26
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 After you press the buttons, the 
Control panel also displays the 
icon for the memory card that’s 
designated as your primary card 
and will be formatted if you go 
forward. If you have two cards 
installed in the camera, you can 
switch to the other card by rotat-
ing the main command dial. You 
also see the shots remaining 
value, which indicates how many 
pictures you can fit on the 
memory card at the current 
Image Quality and Image Size set-
tings. (If the card contains any 
pictures, the number will grow after you complete formatting because 
those images will be erased.)
 
 While the display is blinking, press and release both buttons again. 
When formatting is complete, the For message disappears, and the 
Control panel display returns to normal.
 
✓ Choose the Format Memory Card command from the Setup menu. 
When you select the command, you’re asked to select which card you 
want to format. After taking that step, you see a screen where you need 
to confirm your decision to format the card. Highlight Yes and press the 
OK button to go forward.
 
If you insert a memory card and see the letters For blink in the Control panel, 
you must format the card before you can do anything else.
Exploring External Camera Controls
Scattered across your camera’s exterior are a number of buttons, dials, and 
switches that you use to change picture-taking settings, review and edit your 
photos, and perform various other operations. In later chapters, I discuss 
all your camera’s functions in detail and provide the exact steps to follow to 
access them. This section provides just a basic road map to the external con-
trols plus a quick introduction to each.
 
One note before you move on: Many of the buttons perform multiple func-
tions and so have multiple “official” names. The Protect button, for example, 
is also known as the Help button. In the camera manual, Nikon’s instructions 
refer to these multi-tasking buttons by the name that’s relevant for the cur-
rent function. I think that’s a little confusing, so I always refer to each button 
by the first moniker you see in the lists here.

Topside controls
Your virtual tour begins with the bird’s-eye view shown in Figure 1-20. There 
are a number of controls of note here:
Release Mode dial unlock button
Release mode dial
Exposure Compensation button
On/Off switch and shutter button
Flash hot shoe
Control panel
Focal plane position mark
Figure 1-20: Press and hold the Release Mode dial unlock button before rotating the dial.
 
✓ Control panel: You can view many picture-taking settings on this LCD 
panel. See the earlier section “Decoding the Displays” for more info.
 
✓ On/Off switch and shutter button: Okay, I’m pretty sure you already fig-
ured this combo button out. But remember that you can illuminate the 
Control panel by rotating the On/Off switch past the On position to the 
little light-bulb icon. Moving the switch to that position also activates 
the exposure meters. After you release the switch, the panel backlight 
and meters remain active for about six seconds or until you take a pic-
ture. You can also turn off the panel light by rotating the switch to the 
light-bulb position again.
 
 Through options on the Custom Setting menu, you can change the delay 
time for the meter shutoff and also choose to display the Information 
screen along with lighting up the Control panel when you move the 
switch to the light-bulb position. See the section “Reviewing Basic Setup 
Options,” toward the end of this chapter, for details.

28
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 
✓ Mode button: You press this button while rotating the main command 
dial to select the exposure mode (P, S, A, or M). Chapter 2 introduces 
you to the P mode and Chapter 5 details the others. You also press the 
Mode button in conjunction with the Delete button to format a memory 
card, as explained earlier in this chapter.
 
 
✓ Exposure Compensation button: When working in the camera’s three 
autoexposure modes (P, S, and A), you can apply an exposure-adjust-
ment feature called Exposure Compensation by pressing this button 
while rotating the main command dial (the one on the back of the 
camera; refer to Figure 1-21). Chapter 5 explains. You also press this 
button along with the Qual button to reset the main picture-taking set-
tings to their default options; see the end of this chapter for details. 
(The green dot by each button reminds you of their shared function.)
 
✓ Release Mode dial: You use this dial to switch from normal shooting, 
where you take one picture with each press of the shutter button, to one 
of the camera’s other Release modes, including Self-Timer mode. A letter 
representing the selected mode appears at the bottom of the dial. For 
example, in Figure 1-20, the S (Single Frame) mode is selected. See the 
end of Chapter 2 for a look at all your options. 
 
 In order to rotate the dial, you must press and hold the little lock-release 
button found just above the dial and labeled in Figure 1-20.
 
QUAL  
✓ Qual button: You can press this button while rotating the main com-
mand dial to quickly adjust the Image Quality setting, explained in 
Chapter 3. Pressing the button while rotating the sub-command dial (the 
one on the front of the camera) adjusts the Image Size setting, also cov-
ered in Chapter 3. And as mentioned a few sentences ago, you also use 
the Qual button with the Exposure Compensation button to restore the 
default options for the main picture-taking settings.
 
ISO  
✓ ISO button: Pressing this button while rotating the main command dial 
gives you a quick way to adjust the ISO Sensitivity setting, which deter-
mines the camera’s sensitivity to light. Chapter 5 discusses ISO.
 
WB  
✓ WB button: The WB stands for white balance, which is a color-related 
feature covered in Chapter 6. You can access the basic white-balance 
options quickly by pressing this button while rotating the main com-
mand dial.
 
✓ Flash hot shoe: A hot shoe is a connection for attaching an external flash 
head. The contacts on the shoe are covered by a little black insert, as 
shown in the figure; you need to remove it to attach your flash.
 
Should you ever need to know the exact distance between your subject and 
the camera, the focal plane position mark labeled in Figure 1-20 is key. The 
mark indicates the plane at which light coming through the lens is focused 
onto the negative in a film camera or the image sensor in a digital camera. 

29
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Basing your measurement on this mark produces a more accurate camera-to-
subject distance than using the end of the lens or some other external point 
on the camera body as your reference point.
Back-of-the-body controls
Traveling over the top of the camera to its back side, shown in Figure 1-21, 
you encounter the following controls:
Metering mode selector
Multi Selector
Main command dial
Focus-point selector lock
Speaker
AF-area mode selector
Figure 1-21: You use the Multi Selector to navigate menus and access certain other camera options.
 
✓ Main command dial: After you activate certain camera features, you 
rotate this dial, labeled in Figure 1-21, to select a specific setting. For 
example, to choose a White Balance setting, you press the WB button as 
you rotate the main command dial. (Chapter 6 explains white balancing.)

30
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 
✓ AF-ON button: When taking still photos, you can press this button to set 
focus instead of pressing the shutter button halfway. See Chapter 6 for a 
discussion of the pros and cons of this option. The button also plays a 
focusing role when you take advantage of Live View shooting or record 
movies. See Chapter 4 for details about Live View shooting and movie 
recording.
 
✓ Metering mode selector: Use this switch to select an exposure metering 
mode, which determines what part of the frame the camera considers 
when calculating exposure. Chapter 5 has details on this one as well.
 
 
✓ AE-L/AF-L button: When you’re using automatic focus and exposure, 
you can lock in the current focus and exposure settings by pressing and 
holding this button. Chapter 5 explains. You can assign other functions 
to the button as well. Instructions in this book assume that you stick 
with the default setting, but if you want to explore your options, see 
Chapter 10.
 
✓ Multi Selector: You press the outer edges of the Multi Selector left, right, 
up, or down to navigate camera menus. You press the center button to 
perform a variety of functions within menus as well as during shooting 
and playback. Chapter 10 explains ways to select which functions the 
center button performs, but again, stick with the default settings while 
you’re working with this book.
 
✓ Focus-point selector lock switch: This switch enables you to lock focus 
on a specific part of the frame when you use autofocusing. Chapter 6 
provides the how-tos.
 
 
✓ Live View button: You press this button to engage the Live View pre-
view, which enables you to compose your shot using the monitor 
instead of the viewfinder. Switching to Live View mode is also the first 
step in recording a movie. Chapter 4 talks about both subjects.
 
✓ AF-area mode selector: This switch also is related to customizing the 
camera’s autofocusing behavior. Again, look in Chapter 6 for further info.
 
 
✓ Info: Press this button to activate the Information screen, which you can 
investigate in the earlier section “Decoding the Displays.”
 
 
✓ Playback button: Press this button to switch the camera into picture 
review mode. Chapter 4 details the features available to you in this mode.
 
 
✓ Delete button: Sporting a trash can icon, the universal symbol for 
delete, this button enables you to erase pictures from your memory 
card. Chapter 4 has specifics.
 
 The little red Format label below the button reminds you that you can 
press this button together with the Mode button — which also sports 
the label — to quickly format a memory card. See the earlier section 
“Working with Memory Cards” for details.

31
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
✓ Menu button: Press this button to access menus of camera options. See 
the next section for details on navigating menus.
 
? 
✓ Protect/Help button: This button serves two purposes:
 
• Protect: In playback mode, pressing the button locks the picture 
file — hence the little key symbol that appears on the button 
face — so that it isn’t erased if you use the picture-delete func-
tions. (The picture is erased if you format the memory card, how-
ever.) See Chapter 4 for details.
 
• Help: You also can press this button to display helpful information 
about certain menu options. See “Asking Your Camera for Help,” 
later in this chapter, for details.
 
 
✓ Zoom Out/Thumbnail button: In playback mode, pressing this button 
enables you to display multiple image thumbnails on the screen and 
reduces the magnification of the currently displayed photo. Note the 
minus sign in the magnifying glass icon — the universal symbol to zoom 
out. See Chapter 4 for a complete rundown of picture playback options.
 
 
✓ Zoom In button: In playback mode, pressing this button magnifies the 
currently displayed image and also reduces the number of thumbnails dis-
played at a time. This time, the magnifying glass icon has a plus sign — 
plus for zoom in.
 
✓ OK button: You press this button as the last step in many camera opera-
tions, such as selecting menu items and applying photo corrections from 
the Retouch menu.
 
As for the monitor, I show it in this book without its protective plastic cover. 
But when the camera isn’t in use, it’s a good idea to keep the cover on to pro-
tect the screen from scratches and other damage. 
Also note the tiny little speaker on the lower-right corner of the camera back. 
When you play movies that contain sound, the audio comes wafting through 
those little holes. 
Front-left controls
On the front-left side of the camera body, shown in Figure 1-22, you find the 
following controls:
 
 
✓ Flash button: Pressing this button pops up the camera’s built-in flash. 
Chapter 2 provides some flash basics; Chapter 5 goes into more detail. 
The little round bumps on the button help you to distinguish the button 
from its neighbor, described next, without taking your eye away from 
the viewfinder.

32
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 
✓ Flash mode/Flash 
Compensation button: 
By pressing this button 
and rotating the main 
command dial, you can 
adjust the flash mode 
(normal, red-eye reduc-
tion, and so on). And by 
pressing the button and 
rotating the sub-com-
mand dial (found just 
below the shutter 
button), you can adjust 
the flash power. See 
Chapter 5 for help with 
both features.
 
✓ Lens-release button: 
You press this button 
before removing the 
lens from your camera. 
See the first part of this 
chapter for help with 
mounting and removing 
lenses.
 
✓ Focus mode selec-
tor: This switch sets 
the camera to either 
manual focus mode (M) 
or one of two autofocus 
modes (S and C). See the earlier section “Setting the focus mode (auto or 
manual)” for a few more details; see Chapter 6 for the whole story.
Also note the three little holes right below the D300s label, just partially 
visible in the figure. These holes lead to the camera’s internal microphone, 
included for capturing sound when you record movies. Chapter 4 explains 
the art of movie making.
Front-right controls
Wrapping up the list of external controls, the front-right side of the camera 
offers the following features, labeled in Figure 1-23:
 
✓ Sub-command dial: This dial is the counterpart to the main command 
dial on the back of the camera. As with the main dial, you rotate this 
one to select certain settings, usually in conjunction with pressing 
another button.
Flash button
Flash mode button
Microphone
Lens focus
mode switch
Vibration Reduction switch
Lens-release button
Focus mode selector
Figure 1-22: Press the Flash button to pop up the built-in 
flash.

33
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
✓ AF-assist/Self-Timer/Red-
Eye Reduction lamp: In 
dim lighting, a beam of light 
sometimes shoots out from 
this little lamp to help the 
camera’s autofocus system 
find its target. In general, 
leaving the AF-assist option 
enabled is a good idea, but if 
you’re shooting at an event 
where the light from the lamp 
may be distracting, you can 
disable it through an option 
on the Custom Setting menu. 
Chapter 6 explains this and 
other autofocus features.
 
 The lamp also lights before 
the shutter is released in 
Self-Timer mode and before 
the flash fires in Red-Eye 
Reduction flash mode. 
Chapter 2 offers more infor-
mation about both of these 
features.
 
✓ Depth-of-Field Preview 
button: By pressing this 
button, you can see how dif-
ferent aperture settings affect 
depth of field, or the zone of 
sharp focus in your image. 
Chapter 5 explains aperture 
settings, and Chapter 6 delves into depth of field. Chapter 10 shows you 
how to assign a different function to the button.
 
✓ Function (Fn) button: By default, pressing this button while rotating 
the main command dial or sub-command dial enables you to adjust 
settings related to autobracketing, covered in Chapter 5. Pressing the 
button by its lonesome displays those settings in the Control panel and 
Information screen. 
 
 As with the Depth-of-Field Preview button, you can change the operation 
that’s accomplished by pressing the button or pressing the button while 
rotating the command dials. Again, see Chapter 10 for the scoop.

Hidden connections
Hidden under little covers on the left 
and left front side of the camera, you 
find inputs for connecting the camera 
to various devices.
Under the two little rubber covers 
on the front-left side of the camera, 
shown in Figure 1-24, you find the 
following:
 
✓ Flash sync terminal: You can 
connect some external flash 
units to the camera via a cable, 
known as a sync cable, here. I 
don’t cover this type of flash in 
the book, but Chapter 5 covers 
flash basics.
 
✓ Ten-pin remote terminal: This 
terminal enables you to connect 
a variety of devices, including 
remote-control and GPS units. 
Again, the size of this book 
doesn’t allow coverage of these 
accessories, but the device man-
uals should tell you everything 
you need to know.
Around the corner from the two terminals, open the cover on the left side of 
the body to reveal these connections, shown in Figure 1-25:
 
✓ A/V and HDMI jacks: Use these to connect your camera to a televi-
sion through a regular audio/video cable or high-def (HDMI) cable. The 
camera comes with the standard A/V cable; the HDMI cable is sold sepa-
rately. Chapter 9 offers more details.
 
✓ Stereo microphone jack: If you’re not happy with the audio quality 
provided by the internal microphone, you can plug in an external micro-
phone here. The jack accepts a 3.5mm microphone plug. See Chapter 4 
for all things movie-related.
 
✓ AC adapter connection: Here’s where you plug in the optional AC power 
adapter.
 
✓ USB port: You can connect your camera to your computer through 
this port, using the USB cable found in your camera box. Chapter 8 has 
details.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
If you turn the camera over, you find 
a tripod socket, which enables you 
to mount the camera on a tripod 
that uses a 1⁄4-inch screw, plus the 
battery chamber. The other little 
rubber cover is related to the 
optional MB-D10 battery pack; you 
remove the cover when attaching 
the battery pack. 
Asking Your Camera 
for Help
Programmed into your camera’s 
internal software is a handy informa-
tion help line — a great tool for times 
when you forget the purpose of a 
particular feature or would like 
a little picture-taking guidance.
 
? If you see a small question mark in 
the lower-left corner of a menu, press 
and hold the Protect button to display information about the current shooting 
mode or selected menu option. (The little question mark symbol just above the 
button reminds you of this function.) For example, Figure 1-26 shows the Help 
screen associated with the Active D-Lighting setting. If you need to scroll the 
screen to view all the Help text, keep the button depressed and scroll by using 
the Multi Selector. Release the button to close the information screen.

Reviewing Basic Setup Options
Your camera offers scads of options for customizing its performance. Later 
chapters explain settings related to actual picture taking, such as those 
that affect flash behavior and autofocusing. The rest of this chapter details 
options related to initial camera setup, such as setting the date and time, 
adjusting monitor brightness, and the like.
Cruising the Setup menu
Start your camera customization by opening the Setup menu. Figure 1-27 
shows you all the menu options; press the Multi Selector up and down to 
scroll from one screen to the next.
Figure 1-27: Visit the Setup menu to start customizing your camera.
Here’s a quick rundown of each menu item:

37
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
✓ Format Memory Card: You can use this command to format your 
memory card, which wipes all data off the card and ensures that it’s 
properly set up to record pictures. Or, for quicker results, you can 
use the two-button formatting process outlined in the earlier section, 
“Working with Memory Cards.” 
 
✓ LCD Brightness: This option enables you to make the camera monitor 
brighter or darker. But if you take this step, what you see on the display 
may not be an accurate rendition of your image. Crank up the monitor 
brightness, for example, and an underexposed photo may look just fine. 
So I recommend sticking with the default setting (0). As an alternative, 
you can display the histogram, an exposure guide that I explain in 
Chapter 4, when reviewing your images.
 
✓ Clean Image Sensor: Your D300s has an internal cleaning system 
designed to keep a filter that’s fitted on to the image sensor — that’s 
the part of the camera that actually captures the image — free of dust 
and dirt.
 
 By choosing the Clean Image Sensor command, you can perform a clean-
ing at any time. Just choose the command, press OK, select Clean Now, 
and press OK again. You also can tell the camera to perform automatic 
cleaning every time you turn the camera on or off, only at startup, only at 
shutdown, or never; to do so, select Clean At Startup/Shutdown instead 
of Clean Now. Then press the Multi Selector right, highlight the cleaning 
option you prefer, and press OK.
 
✓ Lock Mirror Up for Cleaning: This feature is necessary when cleaning 
the camera image sensor (or, technically, the aforementioned filter) — 
an operation that I don’t recommend that you tackle yourself because 
you can easily damage the camera if you don’t know what you’re doing.
 
 If you want to use mirror lock-up to avoid camera shake when shooting 
long-exposure images, note that you do so through the Mirror Up setting 
on the Release Mode dial, explained in Chapter 2, and not this Setup 
menu option.
 
✓ Video Mode: This option is related to viewing your images and movies on 
a television, a topic I cover in Chapter 9. Select NTSC if you live in North 
America or other countries that adhere to the NTSC video standard; 
select PAL for playback in areas that follow that code of video conduct.
 
✓ HDMI: See Chapter 9 for information about this setting, which relates 
to options involved with connecting your camera to an HDMI (high-def) 
device.
 
✓ Time Zone and Date: When you turn on your camera for the first time, 
it displays this option and asks you to set the current date and time. 
Keeping the date/time accurate is important because that information is 
recorded as part of the image file. In your photo browser, you can then 
see when you shot an image and, equally handy, search for images by 
the date they were taken.

38
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 On a related note: If you see the message “Clock” blinking in the Control 
panel, and you have already set the date and time, the internal battery 
that keeps the clock running is depleted. Simply charging the main 
camera battery and then putting that battery back in the camera sets 
the clock ticking again, but you need to reset the camera time and date.
 
✓ Language: This option determines the language of text on the camera 
monitor. You have 17 choices, ranging from English to Swedish to 
Korean.
 
✓ Image Comment: See Chapter 10 to find out how to use this feature, 
which enables you to add text comments into a picture file. You can 
view those comments during picture playback and when browsing 
photos in Nikon ViewNX, the software that shipped with your camera. 
The text does not appear on the image itself.
 
✓ Auto Image Rotation: This option is one of two that determines whether 
pictures are rotated to the correct orientation (horizontal or vertical) in 
playback mode. Chapter 4 has details.
 
✓ Image Dust Off Ref Photo: This feature enables you to record an image 
that serves as a point of reference for the automatic dust-removal filter 
available in Nikon Capture NX 2. I don’t cover this accessory software, 
which must be purchased separately, in this book.
 
✓ Battery Info: Select this option to view detailed information about your 
battery, as shown in Figure 1-28. The Bat Meter data shows you the cur-
rent power remaining as a percentage value, and the Pic Meter value 
tells you how many times you’ve pressed and released the shutter 
button since the last time you charged the battery. The final readout, 
Battery Age, lets you know how 
much more life you can expect 
out of the battery before it can no 
longer be recharged. When the 
display moves toward the right 
end of the little meter, it’s time to 
buy a new battery.
 
 The screen in Figure 1-28 shows 
the display as it appears when 
you use the regular camera bat-
tery. If you attach the optional 
battery pack, see its manual and 
the camera manual to find out 
how to interpret the data that’s 
reported.
 
✓ Wireless Transmitter: If you 
purchase the optional WT-4 wireless transmitter to connect your 
camera to a wireless network, you can set up the connection through 
Figure 1-28: You can check the health of your 
battery via the Battery Info menu item.

 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
this menu option. As with other optional accessories, I must refer you 
to the product manuals for details, as the publisher absolutely refuses 
to let me turn this book into a 10-inch-thick tome.
 
✓ Image Authentication: This feature may interest you if you do the kind 
of work that demands that you can prove that a photo has not been 
altered. (Think crime-scene photographer or insurance-claims special-
ist.) When you turn this feature on, the camera embeds some invisible 
data into the file that tags the photo as the original. If the photo is later 
altered, that data reveals the change. Unfortunately, you need to buy 
Nikon’s Image Authentication software to detect and interpret the data; 
it costs about $650. I’m guessing that’s why the default setting for this 
option is Off.
 
✓ Copyright Information: By following the steps in Chapter 10, you can 
add a hidden copyright notice to your photo files. The copyright data 
can then be read in some photo software, including the free browser 
software that ships with your camera (Nikon ViewNX).
 
✓ Save/Load Settings: Through this feature, you can save a file that 
records the major menu settings and store the file on your memory 
card. (The camera manual contains a list of the settings that are pre-
served.) If you later want to use all those settings again, you just load 
the file from the memory card. This option is especially useful in a work 
situation where several photographers share the same camera — if you 
don’t like your co-worker’s settings, you can quickly load your own onto 
the camera.
 
 The camera stores your settings in a file that has the name NCSETUP5. 
If you’re using two memory cards in the camera, the file goes on the one 
that’s selected as the primary card. Don’t change the filename, or you 
won’t be able to reload the settings later.
 
✓ GPS: If you purchase the optional Nikon GPS tracking unit for your 
camera, this menu item holds settings related to its operation. This book 
doesn’t cover this accessory, but the camera manual provides some 
help to get you started.
 
✓ Virtual Horizon: Here’s a cool aid for shooting pictures that require 
your camera to be level with the horizon. When you turn this option on, 
the monitor displays a little gauge that acts sort of like a built-in level. 
When the camera is level to the horizon, the arrow at the top of the dis-
play turns green, as shown in Figure 1-29. (If the entire display is gray, 
without the little degree markers, the camera is tilted too far forward 
or backward for the system to do its thing.) Unfortunately, the display 
shows only on the monitor and not in the viewfinder, so it’s mostly of 
use when you’re shooting in Live View mode or setting up your camera 
on a tripod. However, you can display an alignment grid in the view-
finder, an option covered a little later in this chapter.

Figure 1-29: The Virtual Horizon display helps you make sure the camera is level.
 
✓ Non-CPU Lens Data: A CPU lens is equipped with technology that 
enables it to transmit certain data about the lens to the camera. That 
data helps the camera’s autofocusing and exposure systems work cor-
rectly. When you use a non-CPU lens, you lose access to certain D300s 
features. (Your manual spells them out.) But you can gain back a little of 
the lost functionality by “registering” your lens through this Setup menu 
option. You simply assign the lens a number — you can register up to 
nine non-CPU lenses — and then enter the maximum aperture and focal 
length of each lens.
 
 The rest of this book assumes that you are instead working with a CPU 
lens that supports all the camera’s features. Again, though, your camera 
manual offers additional help if you want to go the non-CPU route.
 
✓ AF Fine Tune: If your focus always seems slightly off when you use 
autofocusing, you may be able to improve the situation through this 
feature. It enables you to create a custom focusing adjustment for up to 
12 lens types, telling the camera to set the focus point just a tad in front 
of or behind where it normally would. Nikon recommends not using this 
feature unless it’s absolutely necessary, and even then, you may want to 
get some expert assistance.
 
✓ Eye-Fi Upload: Your camera can work with some Eye-Fi memory cards, 
which enable you to send your pictures over a wireless network to 
your computer. If you do put one of the cards in the camera, this option 
appears on the Setup menu and contains settings for making the trans-
fer. When no Eye-Fi card is installed, the option doesn’t appear, as in the 
figures in this book
 
 Unfortunately, Eye-Fi cards are significantly more expensive than regular 
cards. But if you do use the cards and you find yourself in a situation 
where wireless devices are not allowed, choose Disable from the Eye-Fi 
upload menu to shut off the signal. For the whole story on Eye-Fi, includ-
ing help with setting up your wireless transfers, visit the company’s Web 
site at www.eye.fi.

✓ Firmware Version: Select this option and press OK to view what version 
of the camera firmware, or internal software, your camera is running. 
You see two separate firmware items, A and B. At the time this book was 
written, both items were in version 1.0.0.
 
 Keeping your camera firmware up-to-date is important, so visit the 
Nikon Web site (www.nikon.com) regularly to find out whether your 
camera sports the latest version. You can find detailed instructions on 
how to download and install any firmware updates on the site.
Browsing the Custom Setting menu
Displaying the Custom Setting menu, whose icon is a little pencil, takes you to 
the left screen shown in Figure 1-30. Here you can access six submenus that 
carry the labels A through F. Each of the submenus holds clusters of options 
related to a specific aspect of the camera’s operation. Highlight a submenu 
and press OK to get to those actions, as shown on the right.
Figure 1-30: Select one of the six submenus and press OK to access the available options.
A few important points about this menu:
 
✓ After you jump to the first submenu, you can simply scroll up and down 
the list to view options from other submenus. You don’t have to keep 
going back to the first screen in Figure 1-30, selecting the submenu, 
pressing OK, and so on.
 
✓ An asterisk above a letter, as in the highlighted option on the right in 
Figure 1-30, indicates that you selected a setting other than the default 
setting. See the last section of this chapter to find out how to restore the 
camera defaults.
 
✓ In the Nikon manual, instructions sometimes reference these settings by 
a menu letter and number. For example, “Custom Setting a1” refers to 

42
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
the first option on the Autofocus submenu. I try to be more specific in 
this book, however, so I use the actual setting names. (Really, we’ve all 
got enough numbers to remember, don’t you think?)
 
✓ Notice that those option letter/number labels are assigned colors to 
indicate their submenu categories: Autofocus options are red, metering/
exposure options are yellow, and so forth.
With those clarifications out of the way, the following sections describe only 
the customization options related to basic camera operations. Turn to the 
index for help locating information about other Custom Setting options.
Adjusting automatic monitor shutdown
To help save battery power, your camera automatically shuts off the monitor 
after a period of inactivity. You can specify how long you want the camera to 
wait before taking that step through the Monitor Off Delay option, found on 
the Timers/AE Lock portion of the Custom Setting menu, as shown in Figure 
1-31. You can specify the auto-off timing for picture playback, menu displays, 
and the Information display. Additionally, you can adjust the length of time 
the camera displays a picture immediately after you press the shutter button, 
known as the Image Review period. Chapter 4 talks more about viewing your 
photos.
Figure 1-31: Visit the Timers/AE Lock submenu to adjust the timing of automatic monitor shut-off.
Customizing shooting and display options
Head for the Shooting/Display section of the Custom Setting menu, shown in 
Figure 1-32, to tweak various aspects of how the camera communicates with 
you, as well as to control a couple of basic shooting functions. Later chap-
ters discuss options related to picture-taking; the following affect the basic 
camera interface: 

43
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
Figure 1-32: Sick of hearing your camera? Turn it off with the Beep option.
 
✓ Beep: By default, your camera beeps at you after certain operations, 
such as after it sets focus when you shoot in autofocus mode. If you’re 
doing top-secret surveillance work and need the camera to hush up, set 
this option to Off. Or just lower the volume from the default, High, to 
Low. On the Information and Control panel displays, a little musical note 
icon appears when the beep is enabled.
 
 Also check out the Release mode section of Chapter 2 for information 
about the Quiet mode, which tamps down camera noise even further.
 
✓ Viewfinder Grid Display: You 
can display tiny gridlines in the 
viewfinder, as shown in Figure 
1-33, by setting this option to 
On. The gridlines are a great 
help when you need to ensure 
the alignment of objects in your 
photo — for example, to make 
sure that the horizon is level 
in a landscape. If you’re using 
Live View mode or a tripod, the 
Virtual Horizon feature discussed 
earlier in the chapter is an alter-
native, but it requires using the 
monitor and not the viewfinder.
 
✓ Viewfinder Warning Display: By 
default, you see a low-battery warning in the viewfinder when your bat-
tery is about to give out. (Refer to Figure 1-13, earlier in this chapter.) 
If you don’t want to see the warning — it can be annoying if you know 
your battery’s low but you have to keep shooting as long as possible 
anyway — turn this option off.
Figure 1-33: The viewfinder grid is another 
aid for ensuring that the horizon is level in the 
frame.

44
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Screen Tips: If you don’t want to see the little help labels that appear 
when you adjust settings via the Information display, turn this option 
Off. For a look at what I’m talking about, revisit Figure 1-12.
 
✓ File Number Sequence: This option controls how the camera names 
your picture files. If you set this option to Off, the camera restarts file 
numbering at 0001 every time you format your memory card or insert 
a new memory card. Numbering is also restarted if you create custom 
folders (an advanced option covered in Chapter 11).
 
 Needless to say, this setup can cause problems over time, creating a 
scenario where you wind up with multiple images that have the same 
filename — not on the current memory card, but when you download 
images to your computer. So I strongly encourage you to stick with the 
default setting, On. Note that when you get to picture number 9999, file 
numbering is still reset to 0001, however. The camera automatically 
creates a new folder to hold for your next 9999 images.
 
 As for the Reset option, it tells the camera to look at the largest file 
number on the current card (or in the selected folder) and then assign 
the next highest number to your next picture. If the card or selected 
folder is empty, numbering starts at 0001. Then the camera behaves as if 
you selected the On setting.
 
 Should you be a really, really prolific shooter and snap enough pic-
tures to reach folder 999, and that folder contains either 999 pictures 
or a photo that has the file number 9999, the camera will refuse to take 
another photo until you choose that Reset option and either format the 
memory card or insert a brand new one.
 
✓ Information Display: Normally, the camera tries to make the data on the 
display easier to read by automatically shifting from black text on a light 
background to light text on a black background, depending on the ambi-
ent light. If you prefer one display style over the other, visit this menu 
item and change the setting from Auto to Manual. You can then select 
either Dark on Light (for dark lettering on a light background) or Light 
on Dark (for light lettering on a dark background).
 
 In this book, I show the Information screen using the Dark on Light dis-
play because it reproduces better in print.
 
✓ LCD Illumination: This setting affects a backlight that can be turned 
on to illuminate the Control panel. When the option is set to Off, as it is 
by default, you can illuminate the panel briefly by rotating the On/Off 
switch past the On setting, to the little light bulb marking. The backlight 
turns off automatically a few seconds after you release the switch.
 
 If you instead set the LCD Illumination option to On, the backlight comes 
on automatically anytime the exposure meters are activated (which 
happens when you press the shutter button halfway). See Chapter 5 for 
more about the exposure meters. Be aware that this option consumes 
more battery power than simply using the On/Off switch to light up the 
panel when you really need it.

45
 Chapter 1: Getting the Lay of the Land
 
✓ Exposure Delay Mode: If you turn this option on, the camera waits to 
record your picture until about one second after you press and release 
the shutter button. What’s the point? Well, a tiny mirror inside the 
camera moves every time you press the shutter button to take a picture. 
For shots that require a long exposure time, there is a slight chance that 
the vibration caused by that mirror movement will blur the picture. So 
by delaying the actual image capture a little, the odds of that mirror-
related blur are lessened. (For Live View shooting, this option works 
only when you use Tripod mode.)
 
 For normal shooting, leave the Exposure Delay Mode setting at its 
default, Off. And check out Chapter 2 for information on using the cam-
era’s self-timer function as an alternative option when you want to delay 
the shutter release.
 
✓ MB-D80 Battery Type and Battery Order: You don’t need to worry 
about these options unless you buy the optional MB-D80 battery adapter 
that enables you to power your camera with AA batteries. If you go that 
route, select the MB-D80 Battery Type option to specify which type of 
AAs you’re using. (Be sure to read the manual for a list of which AA bat-
teries are acceptable, as well as some other details about using them.) 
Then use the Battery Order option to tell the camera whether you want 
it to draw power from the battery pack or the regular camera battery 
when you have both installed. The Control panel displays the letters BP 
when the battery pack is the current power source.
Customizing controls
On the Controls section of the Custom Setting menu, you find options that 
enable you to change the function or behavior of some of the camera’s buttons 
and dials. Chapter 10 talks about most of these options — I purposely put this 
information at the back of the book in hopes that you would leave things at 
their default settings until you’ve fully explored all the other chapters. If you 
change the settings, instructions you find along the way won’t work.
There are a few Controls options, though, that I suggest you check out now:
 
✓ On/Off Light Switch: Normally, rotating the On/Off switch past the On 
position to the light bulb symbol illuminates the Control panel. But 
if you set the option highlighted on the left in Figure 1-34 to the set-
ting shown on the right, rotating the switch activates the Information 
screen as well as the Control panel. (The menu and manual use the 
light bulb symbol instead of the text name I’ve given it here.) You may 
find this maneuver easier than pressing the Info button to light up the 
Information display. The downside is that you use power to light up 
the Control panel when what you really want to see is the Info display. I 
leave it up to you to make the call. 

46
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 1-34: Select this setting if you want to use the On/Off switch to activate the Information 
screen as well as the Control panel light.
 
✓ No Memory Card?: I suggest setting this option to Release Locked, 
which disables the shutter button when no memory card is in the 
camera. At the default setting, Enable Release, you can take a temporary 
picture, which appears in the monitor with the word “Demo” but isn’t 
recorded anywhere. (The feature is provided mainly for use in camera 
stores, enabling salespeople to demonstrate the camera without having 
to keep a memory card installed.)
Restoring default settings
Should you ever want to return your camera to its original, out-of-the-box 
state, the camera manual contains a complete list of all the default settings.
You can also partially restore default settings by taking these steps: 
 
✓ Reset all Shooting Menu options. Open the menu, choose Reset 
Shooting Menu, and press OK.
 
✓ Reset all Custom Setting Menu options. Choose the Reset Custom 
Settings option at the top of the menu.
 
QUAL
 
✓ Restore critical picture-taking settings without affecting options on 
the Custom Setting menu. Use the two-button reset method: Press and 
hold the Exposure Compensation button and the Qual button simulta-
neously for longer than two seconds. (The little green dots near the 
buttons are a reminder of this function.) See the camera manual for a 
list of exactly what settings are restored.
 
When you restore the camera defaults, only the settings for the current 
Shooting bank and Custom Setting bank are affected. For an introduction to 
the bank system, refer to the section “Ordering from Camera Menus,” earlier 
in this chapter.

▶ Dipping your toe in creative waters with flexible programmed auto
O
ne look at the D300s tells you that it’s a complex piece of equipment, 
laden with options that provide precise control over focus, 
color, exposure, and every other aspect of your pictures. 
What may not be so obvious is that with the proper 
camera setup, your D300s can, in fact, offer point-and-
shoot simplicity.
Of course, you likely bought this book for help with 
your camera’s advanced options, and that’s what 
the rest of this book covers. But so that you can take 
great shots while you’re learning, this chapter shows 
you how to operate your camera in the easiest, most 
automatic way possible. It’s not quite as simple as 
using the Full Auto modes found on beginner cam-
eras, but it’s close — “Almost Auto,” if you will.
The first part of the chapter shows you how to set up 
your camera to take advantage of this stress-free approach 
to D300s photography. Then you’re introduced to a basic 
recipe that guides you through the process of framing, focusing, and 
snapping your first pictures. Following that, you can find out how to tweak 
the basic recipe by adding flash, changing the shutter-release mode, and 
manipulating exposure settings to take a little more creative control over 
your photos.

48
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Preparing for Automatic Shooting
The “almost automatic” photography technique that I describe in this chap-
ter is based on a specific camera setup. Most of the settings you need to use 
are the camera defaults — that is, the ones that were in force when you first 
opened your camera box. Nikon chose these settings because they produce 
good results in most situations, so it makes sense to rely on them until you 
have a chance to investigate exactly how each camera option affects your 
pictures.
Of course, if you’re like me, you’ve probably fiddled with some of the settings 
since you got your camera — flipped a switch here, rotated a dial there, and 
so on. So the following steps show you how to get back to square one and 
make a few other tweaks that get you set up for easy-breezy shooting.
 
Don’t be put off by the length of the steps, by the way: First, it takes a lot 
more time to explain everything in text than it does to actually accomplish 
the task at hand. Second, because all the settings remain intact unless you 
later change them, you need to go through the steps only once — you don’t 
have to repeat them before each picture.
Also note that the steps assume that you haven’t yet created any custom 
menu banks, an advanced topic you can explore in Chapter 10. If you have 
created banks, be aware that restoring the defaults in Steps 2 and 3 affects 
the active bank.
 
1. Set the exposure mode to P (programmed autoexposure).
 
 In this mode, the camera calculates the correct exposure for you; you 
don’t need to know anything about f-stops, shutter speeds, and other 
exposure settings to get a good exposure. If you do know about those 
settings, though, you still have some control over them even in P mode; 
see the last section in this chapter for details.
 
 
 To set the exposure mode, press the Mode button and rotate the main 
command dial until you see the letter P in the upper-left corner of the 
Control panel, as shown in Figure 2-1. The P also appears in the view-
finder and Information display, also shown in the figure.
 
 Note: If you use a non-CPU lens, you can’t use the P mode; you are lim-
ited to A (aperture-priority autoexposure) or M (manual). See Chapter 
5 for help using both modes; see Chapter 1 for more about non-CPU 
lenses.

49
 Chapter 2: Fast and Easy: (Almost) Automatic Photography with the D300s
Figure 2-1: The P mode enables you to enjoy the simplicity of fully automatic exposure.
 
2. Restore all Custom Setting menu and Shooting menu options.
 
 To restore the Custom Setting menu options, open that menu and high-
light Reset Custom Settings, as shown on the left in Figure 2-2. Press OK, 
highlight Yes, and press OK again. Note, however, that this step also 
resets many basic camera setup options, such as the volume of the beep 
signal, in addition to those that affect actual photography. Chapter 1 
details those options if you want to revisit them.
 
 To restore the Shooting menu defaults, follow the same steps but 
choose Reset Shooting Menu, as shown on the right in Figure 2-2, from 
the top of the Shooting menu.
Figure 2-2: Choose these options to quickly restore all Shooting menu and Custom Setting 
menu options to the default settings.

3. Perform a two-button reset to restore a few additional picture-taking 
settings. 
 
QUAL  
 To perform this type of reset, press the Qual and Exposure Compensa-
tion buttons together for more than two seconds. The Control panel 
shuts off briefly while the reset is occurring; when the panel reappears, 
release the buttons.
 
4. Reopen the Shooting menu, select ISO Sensitivity Settings and turn the 
ISO Sensitivity Auto Control option on, as shown in Figure 2-3.
 
 ISO Sensitivity determines your camera’s sensitivity to light. Enabling 
the ISO Sensitivity Auto Control option gives the camera permission to 
adjust the light sensitivity if needed to produce a good exposure. Leave 
all the other settings at their defaults, shown on the right in the figure. 
And see Chapter 5 for the whole story on this option and ISO in general.
Figure 2-3: Enable ISO Sensitivity Auto Control to give the camera permission to increase ISO 
(light sensitivity) if needed to properly expose the photo.
 
 When you enable the feature, the ISO Auto label appears in the displays. 
(Refer to Figure 2-1.) If the camera’s about to adjust ISO for you, the 
label blinks.
 
5. Set the Metering mode selector to the Matrix setting, as shown on the 
left in Figure 2-4.
 
 This option determines which part of the frame the camera considers 
when calculating the correct exposure. The setting shown in Figure 2-2 
represents the matrix mode — which is a fancy way of saying that the 
camera bases exposure on the entire frame. See Chapter 5 to find out 
more.

Release mode setting
Figure 2-4: Use these Metering mode, AF-area mode, and Release mode settings.
 
6. Set the AF-area mode switch to the Single Point position, as shown in 
Figure 2-4.
 
 The AF-area mode setting determines which part of the frame the 
camera uses to calculate focus. In the Single Point mode, the camera 
focuses on the object at the center of the frame by default.
 
7. Set the Release mode to S, as shown on the right in Figure 2-4.
 
 To change the setting, press and hold the little black button labeled in 
the figure as you rotate the Release Mode dial.
 
 The S (Single Frame) Release mode tells the camera to record one pic-
ture each time you press the shutter button. For other options, see 
“Changing the shutter-release mode,” later in this chapter.
That’s it. Your camera is now set up to operate in its most automatic modes. 
The next section walks you through the process of actually taking a picture — 
wow, and only about 50 pages into the book!

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Taking the Shot: The Basic Recipe
After you set up your camera as described in the preceding section, the pro-
cess of taking a picture is pretty much the same as with any fully automatic, 
point-and-shoot camera you may have used. The biggest variation is that you 
can choose to focus manually instead of sticking with autofocus.
Follow these steps to frame, focus, and shoot:
 
1. Set the focus mode (manual or automatic).
 
 You set the mode through the 
Focus mode selector switch, 
shown in Figure 2-5. For manual 
focusing, set the switch to M; 
for autofocusing, choose S, as 
shown in the figure.
 
 The S stands for single-servo 
autofocus. Check out Chapter 6 
for complete details on this 
autofocus mode as well as its 
companion, C (continuous-servo 
autofocus).
 
 If your lens also has a focus 
mode switch, set it to your 
desired focus option as well. 
Figure 2-5 shows the switch as it 
appears on some Nikon lenses. 
On this lens, setting the switch 
to A enables autofocusing; M is 
for manual focusing.
 
 Also turn on vibration reduction 
(VR, on Nikon lenses) if your 
lens offers it and you’re hand-
holding the camera. For tripod 
shooting, check the lens manual 
to find out which setting the 
manufacturer recommends.
 
2. Frame your subject so that it 
appears under the autofocus point, as shown in Figure 2-6.
 
 The autofocus point is the little black rectangle shown in the center of 
the frame in Figure 2-5. You see the single autofocus point any time you 
set the camera’s Focus mode selector switch to the M or S position.
 
3. If focusing manually, twist the focusing ring on the lens to focus.

on the lens as well as on the camera body.

53
 Chapter 2: Fast and Easy: (Almost) Automatic Photography with the D300s
 
4. Press and hold the shutter 
button halfway down.
 
 At this point, a couple of things 
happen:
 
• The camera meters the light 
in the scene and establishes 
the initial exposure settings.
 
• If you’re using autofocusing, 
the camera sets focus on the 
object under the autofocus 
point. You also see the green 
focus indicator lamp in the 
viewfinder, as shown in 
Figure 2-7, and hear a beep if 
the autofocus system is suc-
cessful in locking focus.
 
• If you’re focusing manually, 
you don’t hear a beep, but 
the focus lamp does light 
when the object under the 
autofocus point comes into 
focus. (This focus aid works 
only with lenses that offer 
a maximum aperture of at 
least f/5.6, however. See the 
last section of this chapter 
for an introduction to aper-
ture settings.)
 
 With autofocusing, focus remains 
locked as long as you keep the 
shutter button halfway down, 
even if you reframe the shot. 
The exposure settings are 
adjusted up to the time you take the picture, however.
 
5. Press the shutter button the rest of the way down to take the picture.
 
 While the camera sends the image data to the camera memory card, 
the memory card access lamp lights. (It’s the little light just to the 
right of the AF-area mode selector.) Don’t turn off the camera or 
remove the memory card while the lamp is lit, or you may damage 
both camera and card.
 
 See Chapter 4 to find out how to switch to playback mode and take a 
look at your picture.
A couple of additional tips about focusing:

under the autofocus point.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ By default, the camera does not let you take the picture in S autofocus 
mode until focus has been established. You can change this behavior 
through an option called AF-S Priority Selection, found on the Custom 
Setting menu and covered in Chapter 6.
 
✓ In manual focusing mode, the camera assumes that you know what 
you’re doing and records the picture even if the scene isn’t in focus. 
Be sure that you adjust the viewfinder to your eyesight, as outlined in 
Chapter 1, so that you can gauge focus accurately.
 
✓ You don’t have to use the autofocus point in the center of the frame as 
your focusing target. You can move the point to another position within 
the frame. First, set the Focus-point selector lock switch to the position 
shown in Figure 2-8. Then press the Multi Selector to move the focus 
point. You can move the point to any of 51 positions within the bounds 
of the autofocusing brackets, also labeled in the figure. For example, I 
moved the autofocus point directly over the museum sign in the figure. 
(The 51-point availability relies on the default setting for a Custom Setting 
menu option called AF Point Selection; see Chapter 6 for more details.) If 
the point doesn’t move when you press the Multi Selector, give the shut-
ter button a half press and release it to wake up the camera’s metering 
system and then try again.
 
✓ If you have trouble focusing, you may be too close to your subject; every 
lens has a minimum focusing distance. Your lens manual spells out this 
detail.
 
✓ A blurry photo is not always the result of poor focus; the problem can 
also be caused by a slow shutter speed. The last section of this chapter 
introduces you to shutter speed and how you can adjust that setting.

Tweaking the Recipe: Easy Adjustments 
for Better Results
After you’re comfortable with the basic picture-taking recipe outlined in the 
preceding section, try out the variations presented in the next three sections.
Adding flash
On most point-and-shoot cameras, the flash fires automatically if the camera 
thinks additional light is needed to expose the picture. The D300s, however, 
leaves all flash control in your hands.
You can enable or disable the 
built-in flash as follows:
 
✓ To enable flash: Press 
the Flash button, shown 
in Figure 2-9, to raise the 
built-in flash.
 
✓ To go flash-free: If the 
flash unit is up, just 
press it gently back 
down. The flash will not 
fire when you take the 
picture.
 
 If you do use flash, you must 
also select a flash mode, 
which affects the behavior of 
the flash. The current mode 
appears in the Information 
display and Control panel, as 
shown in Figure 2-10. (To dis-
play the Information screen, 
press the Info button.) The 
viewfinder display doesn’t 
advise you of the specific flash mode but instead just shows the universal 
lightning bolt icon, as shown in the figure, when the flash is enabled, 
charged, and ready to fire. (The flash needs a moment or two to recharge 
between shots; be sure to wait until the symbol appears before you take 
your next picture.)

Figure 2-10: The Control panel and Information display show the flash mode; the viewfinder 
symbol indicates when the flash is charged and ready to use.
In the P exposure mode, you can set the flash to five different flash modes, 
all of which I cover thoroughly in Chapter 5. But when you use the auto-
matic shooting strategy suggested in this chapter, keep things simple by 
using one of the following two modes, represented in the displays by the 
icons you see here:
 
 
✓ Front-curtain sync (normal flash): Don’t worry about what “front-cur-
tain sync” means for now. Just think of this mode as “regular flash.”
 
 
✓ Red-eye reduction: In this mode, the Red-Eye Reduction lamp on the 
front of the camera lights up when you press the shutter button halfway. 
The purpose of this light is to attempt to shrink the subject’s pupils, 
which helps reduce the chances of red-eye. The flash itself fires when 
you press the shutter button the rest of the way. If you use this option, 
be sure to warn your subject to expect the prelight and keep smiling 
until the actual flash goes off.
 
The letters TTL that appear with the flash mode in the Information display 
stand for through the lens and refer to the fact that the camera calculates the 
proper flash exposure by reading the light that’s coming through the lens.
Changing the shutter-release mode
Introduced in the first part of this chapter, the Release mode determines how 
the shutter release is triggered. You adjust the setting through the Release 
Mode dial, shown again on the left in Figure 2-11 to save you the chore of flip-
ping back to its first appearance in the chapter.

57
 Chapter 2: Fast and Easy: (Almost) Automatic Photography with the D300s
Figure 2-11: You can choose from six Release modes.
 
To change the setting, press and hold the little black button just above the 
Qual button while rotating the main command dial. The letter displayed next to 
the white marker represents the selected setting. For example, in Figure 2-11, 
the S is aligned with the marker, showing that the Single Frame mode is 
selected. For all but two Release modes (Quiet and Mirror Up), the Information 
display shows you the current mode as well, as shown on the right in Figure 
2-11.Your camera offers six release modes, which work like so:
 
S
 
✓ Single Frame: This setting, which is the default, records a single image 
each time you press the shutter button completely. In other words, this 
is normal-photography mode.
 
CL
 
✓ Continuous Low: Sometimes known as burst mode, this mode records a 
continuous series of images as long as you hold down the shutter 
button. At the default setting, Continuous Low mode can capture a maxi-
mum of three frames per second. But you can set the maximum capture 
number to any number from one to seven frames per second. Just open 
the Custom Setting menu, select the Shooting/Display submenu, and 
then select CL Mode Shooting Speed, as shown in Figure 2-12. The 
Release mode symbol in the information display shows you the current 
setting; for example, if you use the default setting, you see the 3 fps in 
the display.
 
 Why would you want to capture fewer than the maximum number of 
shots? Well, frankly, unless you’re shooting something that’s moving at a 
really, really fast pace, not too much is going to change between frames 
when you shoot at 7 frames per second. So when you set the burst rate 
that high, you typically just wind up with lots of shots that show the 
exact same thing, wasting space on your memory card. So I keep this 
value set to the default, three, and then if I want that max burst rate, I 
use the Continuous High setting, explained next.

58
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 2-12: You can specify the maximum frames-per-second rate for Continuous Low 
Release mode.
 
CH
 
✓ Continuous High: This mode works just like Continuous Low except that 
it records up to seven frames per second. You can’t adjust the frame 
rate for this mode.
 
 Neither of the Continuous modes, by the way, works when you enable 
flash because the flash can’t recycle fast enough to permit the rapid cap-
ture rate. And the actual number of frames you can record per second 
depends on several factors. At a slow shutter speed, the camera may not 
be able to reach the maximum frame rate. (See Chapter 5 for an explana-
tion of shutter speed.) The maximum burst rate also drops when you 
capture photos as 14-bit NEF (RAW) files (explained in Chapter 3) or 
enable Vibration Reduction. On the other hand, you may be able to 
achieve a slightly higher frame 
rate when you use the optional 
AC power adapter or battery 
pack; see the camera manual for 
details if you’re interested.
 
 In addition, you can tweak both 
modes by limiting the maximum 
number of shots the camera 
takes with each press of the shut-
ter button. Again, the idea behind 
this feature is simply to prevent 
firing off lots of wasted frames. 
To make the adjustment, use the 
Max Continuous Release option, 
found on the Custom Setting 
menu, just below the CL Mode 
Shooting Speed option, as shown 
in Figure 2-13.
Figure 2-13: This option limits the number of 
shots recorded with each press of the shutter 
button in the Continuous Low and Continuous 
High modes.

59
 Chapter 2: Fast and Easy: (Almost) Automatic Photography with the D300s
 
 
✓ Self-Timer: Want to put yourself in the picture? Select this mode and then 
press the shutter button and run into the frame. As soon as you press the 
shutter button, the autofocus-assist illuminator on the front of the camera 
starts to blink, and the camera emits a series of beeps (assuming that you 
didn’t disable its voice, a setting I cover in Chapter 1). A few seconds later, 
the camera captures the image.
 
 At the default settings, the capture-delay time is 10 seconds. But you 
can adjust the delay time by visiting the Custom Setting menu. After you 
pull up the menu, choose the Timers/AE Lock submenu and then select 
the Self Timer option, as shown 
in Figure 2-14. You can select a 
capture-delay time of 2, 5, 10, or 
20 seconds.
 
MUP
 
✓ Mirror Up: One of the compo-
nents involved in the optical 
system of an SLR camera is a tiny 
mirror that moves when you 
press the shutter button. The 
small vibration caused by the 
movement of the mirror can 
result in slight blurring of the 
image when you use a very slow 
shutter speed, shoot with a long 
telephoto lens, or take extreme 
close-up shots. To eliminate the possibility, the D300s offers a feature 
known as mirror lockup, which you enable by setting the Release mode 
to Mirror Up. When you enable this feature, the mirror movement is 
completed well before the shot is recorded, thus preventing any camera 
shake.
 
 Mirror lockup shooting requires a slightly different shutter-button tech-
nique: You must press the shutter button fully twice to take the picture. 
After framing and focusing, press the button all the way down to lock 
up the mirror. At this point, you can no longer see anything through 
the viewfinder. Don’t panic — that’s normal. The mirror’s function is to 
enable you to see in the viewfinder the scene that the lens will capture, 
and mirror lockup prevents it from serving that purpose. To record the 
shot, let up on the shutter button and then press it all the way down 
again. (If you don’t take the shot within about 30 seconds, the camera 
will record a picture for you automatically.)
 
 For good results, always use a tripod when using mirror lockup to 
eliminate any chance of camera shake. Adding a remote-control shutter-
release cable further ensures a shake-free shot — even the action of 
pressing the shutter button can move the camera enough to cause some 
slight blurring. (Or you can just wait the 30 seconds needed for the 
camera to take the picture automatically, if your subject permits.)
Figure 2-14: You can adjust the self-timer 
capture delay via the Custom Setting menu.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
Q
 
✓ Quiet: This Release mode setting is designed for situations when you 
want the camera to be as silent as possible. It disables the autofocus 
beep and also decreases the internal sounds the camera makes from the 
time you fully depress the shutter button to the time you lift your finger 
off the button. 
 
When you use Self-Timer mode or trigger the shutter release with a 
remote control — that is, any time you take a shot without your eye to the 
viewfinder — you should remove the little rubber cup that surrounds the 
viewfinder and then insert the little viewfinder cover that shipped with your 
camera. (Dig around in the accessories box — the cover is a tiny black piece 
of plastic, about the size of the viewfinder.) Otherwise, light may seep into 
the camera through the viewfinder and affect exposure. You can also simply 
use the camera strap or something else to cover the viewfinder in a pinch.
Adding some creative flavor with 
flexible programmed auto
 
 Your camera has four exposure modes, P, S, A, and M, which determine how 
much control you have over two critical exposure settings, aperture and 
shutter speed. You select the mode by pressing the Mode button while rotat-
ing the main command dial. The current mode setting appears in the upper-
left corner of the Control panel, and it’s also displayed in the viewfinder and 
Information screen, as shown in Figure 2-15. The aperture and shutter speed 
settings appear in the areas highlighted in the figure.
What does [r 37] in the viewfinder mean?
When you look in your viewfinder to frame a 
shot, the initial value shown in brackets at the 
right end of the viewfinder display indicates 
the number of additional pictures that can fit 
on your memory card. For example, in the left 
viewfinder image below, the value shows that 
the card can hold 68 more images.
As soon as you press the shutter button halfway, 
that value changes to instead show you how 
many pictures can fit in the camera’s memory 
buffer. In the right image here, for example, the 
“r 37” value tells you that 37 pictures can fit in 
the buffer.
The buffer is a temporary storage tank where 
the camera stores picture data until it has 
time to fully record that data onto the camera 
memory card. This system exists so that you 
can take a continuous series of pictures without 
having to wait between shots until each image 
is fully written to the memory card. 
When the buffer is full, the camera automati-
cally disables the shutter button until it catches 
up on its recording work. Chances are, though, 
that you’ll very rarely, if ever, encounter this sit-
uation; the camera is usually more than capable 
of keeping up with your shooting rate. 

61
 Chapter 2: Fast and Easy: (Almost) Automatic Photography with the D300s
Shutter speed
Aperture
Figure 2-15: The P mode offers fully automatic exposure but still gives you some control over 
aperture (f-stop) and shutter speed.
For the most automatic operation of your D300s, the P (programmed autoex-
posure) is the way to go. In this mode, the camera selects both the aperture 
and shutter speed for you so that you can get a perfectly exposed photo with 
no photography experience at all.
 
If you are familiar with the basics of 
exposure, you know that aperture 
and shutter speed affect your pic-
ture in ways beyond exposure. The 
aperture setting, measured in f-stops, 
affects depth of field, or the distance 
over which sharp focus is main-
tained in a scene. And shutter speed, 
measured in seconds, determines 
whether any movement of either the 
camera or the subject creates blur in 
the photo.
Chapter 5 details all the ins and outs 
of aperture and shutter speed, but 
here’s the (very) short story:
 
✓ A low f-stop number keeps less 
of the scene in focus than a 
high f-stop setting. So if you’re 
shooting a portrait, for example, 
and want that classic, soft-focus 
background, you want a low 
f-stop number. For example, 
in Figure 2-16, I used an f-stop 
Figure 2-16: To throw the background out of 
focus, I used an aperture of f/5.6.

62
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
of f/5.6. If you instead want the 
background to be sharper, you 
select a higher f-stop number. I 
took that approach to capture 
the landscape in Figure 2-17, set-
ting the aperture to f/16. In this 
photo, notice that the walkway 
remains sharply focused over a 
great distance. Keep in mind that 
you can affect this characteristic 
in other ways, including the lens 
focal length and your distance to 
the subject; Chapter 6 spells out 
this issue.
 
✓ A fast shutter speed freezes 
motion; a slow shutter speed 
blurs it. Shutter speed refers to 
the duration of the exposure, and 
it’s measured in seconds. The 
exact shutter speed needed to 
stop action depends on the speed 
of the subject, however. For 
example, in Figure 2-18, I caught 
my romping furkid in mid-flight at 
a shutter speed of 1/160 second. 
You might need a faster shutter 
speed to capture a motorbike or 
boat, but a slower speed might work fine for a flower swaying gently in 
the breeze. Experimentation is key, in other words.
 
 If you’re handholding the camera, you need to avoid very slow shutter 
speeds to avoid camera shake that can blur your entire photo. How slow 
you can go also varies depending your lens and your capabilities. If your 
lens offers vibration reduction, enabling that feature can help you get 
better results when handholding the camera.
Why get into all of this now, you ask, when the point of this chapter is easy-
breezy, automatic photography? Because the P exposure mode allows you 
to choose from more than one combination of aperture and shutter speed. 
All of them produce the same exposure, but they deliver different results in 
terms of depth of field and motion blur (or lack of it). So you have the choice 
of choosing the combination that the camera originally selects or choosing a 
different combination that results in the shutter speed or aperture that suits 
your creative goals.
Figure 2-17: For this scene, I wanted to 
maintain sharp focus over a large distance, 
so I set the aperture to a high number (f/16).

63
 Chapter 2: Fast and Easy: (Almost) Automatic Photography with the D300s
 
Nikon refers to the ability of 
the camera to present different 
aperture/shutter speed combi-
nations as flexible programmed 
autoexposure.
Try out these steps to get com-
fortable with the P mode:
 
1. Looking through the 
viewfinder, frame your 
shot.
 
2. Press the shutter button 
halfway to fire up the 
autoexposure meter.
 
 Now the camera reports 
its suggested aperture and 
shutter speed in the view-
finder. Take your eye away 
from the viewfinder, and 
you can also view the set-
tings in the Control panel 
and Information display.
 
 The shutter speed values 
in the displays represent 
fractions of a second. For 
example, the shutter speed 
in Figure 2-19 is 1/160 
second. For shutter speeds 
of 1 second or more, a 
quote mark appears after the value — 1 second appears as 1”, 2 seconds 
as 2”, and so on.
 
3. To view other shutter speed/aperture combinations, rotate the main 
command dial.
 
 How many combinations are available depends on the lighting condi-
tions and the aperture range offered by your lens. (Every lens offers a 
specific range of f-stops.)
 
 As soon as you rotate the dial, an asterisk appears next to the P in the dis-
plays, as shown in Figure 2-19. When you rotate the dial enough to shift 
back to the original shutter speed/f-stop combo, the asterisk disappears.
Figure 2-18: If your subject is moving, make shutter 
speed a priority over f-stop; select a high speed to 
freeze action.

64
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 2-19: The asterisk means that you’ve adjusted the f-stop and shutter speed from the 
combination originally suggested by the camera.
Again, any of the combos will produce a good exposure in terms of image 
brightness. So if you don’t care to think about all the depth-of-field/motion 
blur stuff right now, you can just stick with the original settings the camera 
selects.
Actually, I should qualify that last statement just a little: Any of the settings 
will produce a good exposure if the lighting conditions are good. But in very 
dim lighting or very bright lighting, the camera may not be able to deliver 
a good exposure. To find out how to deal with exposure and lighting mis-
cues, head for Chapter 5. For more help with focusing and color, check out 
Chapter 6.

Quality and Size

▶ Exploring resolution, pixels, and ppi

▶ Picking the right JPEG quality level
▶ Understanding the tradeoff between picture quality and file size
A
lmost every review of the D300s contains glowing reports 
about the camera’s top-notch picture quality. As you’ve 
no doubt discovered for yourself, those claims are true, 
too: This baby can create large, beautiful images.
What you may not have discovered is that Nikon’s 
default Image Quality setting isn’t the highest that 
the D300s offers. Why, you ask, would Nikon do 
such a thing? Why not set up the camera to pro-
duce the best images right out of the box? The 
answer is that using the top setting has some 
downsides. Nikon’s default choice represents a 
compromise between avoiding those disadvantages 
while still producing images that will please most 
photographers.
Whether that compromise is right for you, however, depends 
on your photographic needs. To help you decide, this chapter 
explains the Image Quality setting, along with the Image Size setting, 
which is also critical to the quality of images that you print. Just in case 
you’re having quality problems related to other issues, though, the first sec-
tion of the chapter provides a handy quality-defect diagnosis guide.

66
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Diagnosing Quality Problems
When I use the term picture quality, I’m not talking about the composition, 
exposure, or other traditional characteristics of a photograph. Instead, I’m 
referring to how finely the image is rendered in the digital sense.
Figure 3-1 illustrates the concept: The first example is a high-quality image, 
with clear details and smooth color transitions. The other examples show 
five common digital-image defects.
High quality
Pixelation
JPEG artifacts
Noise
Color cast
Lens/sensor dirt
Figure 3-1: Refer to this symptom guide to determine the cause of poor image quality.
Each of these defects is related to a different issue, and only one is affected 
by the Image Quality setting on your D300s. So if you aren’t happy with your 
image quality, first compare your photos to those in the figure to properly 
diagnose the problem. Then try these remedies: 
 
✓ Pixelation: When an image doesn’t have enough pixels (the colored tiles 
used to create digital images), details aren’t clear, and curved and diago-
nal lines appear jagged. The fix is to increase image resolution, which 
you do via the Image Size control. See the next section, “Considering 
Resolution (Image Size),” for details.

67
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
 
✓ JPEG artifacts: The “parquet tile” texture and random color defects that 
mar the third image in Figure 3-1 can occur in photos captured in the 
JPEG (jay-peg) file format, which is why these flaws are referred to as 
JPEG artifacts. This is the defect related to the Image Quality setting; see 
“Understanding the Image Quality Options” to find out more.
 
✓ Noise: This defect gives your image a speckled look, as shown in the 
lower-left example in Figure 3-1. Noise can occur with very long expo-
sure times or when you choose a high ISO Sensitivity setting on your 
camera. You can explore both issues in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Color cast: If your colors are seriously out of whack, as shown in the 
lower-middle example in the figure, try adjusting the camera’s White 
Balance setting. Chapter 6 covers this control and other color issues.
 
✓ Lens/sensor dirt: A dirty lens is the first possible cause of the kind of 
defects you see in the last example in the figure. If cleaning your lens 
doesn’t solve the problem, dust or dirt may have made its way onto the 
camera’s image sensor. You can try running the camera’s internal clean-
ing routine; Chapter 1 has details. If that doesn’t do the trick, it’s time to 
take your camera to a professional to have the sensor cleaned. You can 
do the job yourself with some special tools, but you also can easily trash 
a really expensive camera if you don’t know what you’re doing. In my 
area (central Indiana), sensor cleaning costs range from $30–$50.
 
 One more cleaning tip: Never — and I mean never — try to clean any 
part of your camera using a can of compressed air. Doing so can not 
only damage the interior of your camera, blowing dust or dirt into areas 
where it can’t be removed, but also crack the external monitor.
 
When diagnosing image problems, you may want to open the photos in 
ViewNX or some other photo software and zoom in for a close-up inspection. 
Some defects, especially pixelation and JPEG artifacts, have a similar appear-
ance until you see them at a magnified view. (See Part III for information 
about using ViewNX.)
I should also tell you that I used a little digital enhancement to exaggerate the 
flaws in my example images to make the symptoms easier to see. With the 
exception of an unwanted color cast or a big blob of lens or sensor dirt, these 
defects may not even be noticeable unless you print or view your image at a 
very large size. And the subject matter of your image may camouflage some 
flaws; most people probably wouldn’t detect a little JPEG artifacting in a pho-
tograph of a densely wooded forest, for example.
In other words, don’t consider Figure 3-1 as an indication that your D300s is 
suspect in the image quality department. First, any digital camera can pro-
duce these defects under the right circumstances. Second, by following the 
guidelines in this chapter and the others mentioned in the preceding list, you 
can resolve any quality issues that you may encounter.

68
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Considering Resolution (Image Size)
Like other digital devices, your D300s creates pictures out of pixels, which 
is short for picture elements. You can see some pixels close up in the right 
example of Figure 3-2, which shows a greatly magnified view of the eye area 
in the left image.
Figure 3-2: Pixels are the building blocks of digital photos.
You can specify the pixel count of your images, also known as the resolution, 
in two ways:
 
✓ Shooting menu: The Image Size option is near the bottom of the first 
screen of the menu, as shown in Figure 3-3.
Figure 3-3: Set the Image Size through the Shooting menu.

69
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
 
QUAL  
✓ Qual button + sub-command dial: Hold down the button while rotating 
the sub-command dial to cycle through the available settings. You can 
monitor the setting in the Control panel and Information display, in the 
areas highlighted in Figure 3-4.
Figure 3-4: The current setting appears in the Control panel and Information display.
Either way, you can choose from three settings: Large, Medium, and Small; 
Table 3-1 lists the resulting resolution values for each setting.
Table 3-1 
Image Size (Resolution) Options
Setting
Resolution
Large
4288 x 2848 pixels (12.2 MP)
Medium
3216 x 2136 pixels (6.9 MP)
Small
2144 x 1424 pixels (3.1 MP)
In the table, the first pair of numbers shown for each setting represents the 
image pixel dimensions — that is, the number of horizontal pixels and the 
number of vertical pixels. The values in parentheses indicate the approxi-
mate total resolution. This number is usually stated in megapixels, abbrevi-
ated MP for short. One megapixel equals 1 million pixels. 
 
Note, however, that if you select RAW (NEF) as your file format, all images 
are captured at the Large setting. The upcoming section “Understanding the 
Image Quality Options” explains file formats.
So how many pixels are enough? To make the call, you need to understand 
how resolution affects print quality, display size, and file size. The next sec-
tions explain these issues, as well as a few other resolution factoids.

70
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Pixels and print quality
 
When mulling over resolution options, your first consideration is how large 
you want to print your photos, because pixel count determines the size at 
which you can produce a high-quality print. If you don’t have enough pixels, 
your prints may exhibit the defects you see in the pixelation example in 
Figure 3-1, or worse, you may be able to see the individual pixels, as in the 
right example in Figure 3-2.
Depending on your photo printer, you typically need anywhere from 200 to 
300 pixels per linear inch, or ppi, of the print. To produce an 8-x-10-inch print 
at 200 ppi, for example, you need 1600 horizontal pixels and 2000 vertical 
pixels (or vice versa, depending on the orientation of your print).
Table 3-2 lists the pixel counts needed to produce traditional print sizes at 
200 ppi and 300 ppi. But again, the optimum ppi varies depending on the 
printer — some printers prefer even more than 300 ppi — so check your 
manual or ask the photo technician at the lab that makes your prints. (And 
note that ppi is not the same thing as dpi, which is a measurement of printer 
resolution. Dpi refers to how many dots of color the printer can lay down per 
inch; most printers use multiple dots to reproduce 1 pixel.)
Table 3-2 
Pixel Requirements for Traditional Print Sizes

800 x 1200

2200 x 2800
3300 x 4200
 
Even though many photo editing programs enable you to add pixels to an 
existing image, doing so isn’t a good idea. For reasons I won’t bore you with, 
adding pixels — known as resampling — doesn’t enable you to successfully 
enlarge your photo. In fact, resampling typically makes matters worse. The 
printing discussion at the start of Chapter 9 includes some example images 
that illustrate this issue.
Pixels and screen display size
Resolution doesn’t affect the quality of images viewed on a monitor, televi-
sion, or other screen device as it does printed photos. What resolution does 
determine is the size at which the image appears.
This issue is one of the most misunderstood aspects of digital photogra-
phy, so I explain it thoroughly in Chapter 9. For now, just know that you 
need way fewer pixels for onscreen photos than you do for printed photos. 

71
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
For example, Figure 3-5 shows a 450-x-300-pixel image that I attached to an 
e-mail message.
 
For e-mail images, I recommend a maximum of 640 pixels for the picture’s 
longest dimension. If your image is much larger, the recipient may not be 
able to view the entire picture without scrolling the display.
Figure 3-5: The low resolution of this image (450 x 300 pixels) ensures that it can be viewed 
without scrolling when shared via e-mail.
In short, even if you use the smallest Image Size setting on your D300s, you’ll 
have more than enough pixels for onscreen use, whether you display the pic-
ture on a computer monitor, digital projector, or television set — even one 
of the new, supersized high-definition TVs. Again, Chapter 9 details this issue 
and also shows you how to prepare your pictures for online sharing.
Pixels and file size
Every additional pixel increases the amount of data required to create a digi-
tal picture file. So a higher-resolution image has a larger file size than a low-
resolution image.

72
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
Large files present several problems:
 
✓ You can store fewer images on your memory card, on your computer’s 
hard drive, and on removable storage media such as a CD-ROM.
 
✓ The camera needs more time to process and store the image data on 
the memory card after you press the shutter button. This extra time can 
hamper fast-action shooting.
 
✓ When you share photos online, larger files take longer to upload and 
download.
 
✓ When you edit your photos in your photo software, your computer 
needs more resources and time to process large files.
To sum up, the tradeoff for a high-resolution image is a large file size. But 
note that the Image Quality setting also affects file size. See the upcoming 
section “Understanding the Image Quality Options” for more on that topic. 
The upcoming sidebar “How many pictures fit on my memory card?” pro-
vides additional thoughts about the whole file-storage issue.
Resolution recommendations
As you can see, resolution is a bit of a sticky wicket. What if you aren’t sure 
how large you want to print your images? What if you want to print your 
photos and share them online? 
Personally, I take the “better safe than sorry” route, which leads to the fol-
lowing recommendations about the Image Size setting: 
 
✓ Always shoot at a resolution suitable for print. You then can create 
a low-resolution copy of the image in your photo editor for use online. 
Chapter 9 shows you how.
 
 Again, you can’t go in the opposite direction, adding pixels to a low-
resolution original in your photo editor to create a good, large print. 
Even with the very best software, adding pixels doesn’t improve the 
print quality of a low-resolution image.
 
✓ For everyday images, Medium is a good choice. I find the Large setting 
to be overkill for most casual shooting, which means that you’re creat-
ing huge files for no good reason. Keep in mind that even at the Medium 
setting, your pixel count (3216 x 2136) exceeds what you need to pro-
duce an 8-x-10-inch print at 200 ppi.
 
✓ Choose Large for an image that you plan to crop, print very large, or 
both. The benefit of maxing out resolution is that you have the flexibility 
to crop your photo and still generate a decent-sized print of the remaining 
image. Figures 3-6 and 3-7 offer an example. When I was shooting this 
scene, I couldn’t get any closer to the bee — okay, didn’t want to get 
closer to the bee — than the first picture shows. But because I had the 

73
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
resolution cranked up to Large, I was able to later crop the shot to the 
composition you see in Figure 3-7 and still produce a great print. In fact, I 
could have printed the cropped image at a much larger size than fits here.
Figure 3-6: I couldn’t get close enough to fill the frame with the subject, so I 
captured this image at the Large resolution setting.
Figure 3-7: A high-resolution original enabled me to crop the photo 
tightly and still have enough pixels to produce a quality print.

Understanding the Image Quality Options
If I had my druthers, the Image Quality option would instead be called File 
Type, because that’s what the setting controls.
Here’s the deal: The file type, more commonly known as a file format, deter-
mines how your picture data is recorded and stored. Your choice does 
impact picture quality, but so do other factors, as outlined at the beginning 
of this chapter. In addition, your choice of file type has ramifications beyond 
picture quality.
At any rate, your D300s offers three file types: JPEG, TIFF, and Camera RAW, 
or just RAW for short, which goes by the specific moniker NEF on Nikon cam-
eras. You also can choose to record two copies of each picture, one in the 
RAW format and one in the JPEG format. You can view the current format in 
How many pictures fit on my memory card?
As explained in the Image Size and Image 
Quality discussions in this chapter, image reso-
lution (pixel count) and file format (JPEG, RAW, 
or TIFF) contribute to the size of the picture file 
which, in turn, determines how many photos fit 
in a given amount of camera memory. File size 
also depends on a few other factors, including 
the level of detail and color in the subject.
On the D300s, file sizes range anywhere from 
36.6MB (megabytes) to 0.4MB, depending on the 
combination of Image Size and Image Quality 
settings you select. That means the capacity 
of a 4GB (gigabyte) memory card ranges from 
about 100 pictures to a whopping 7800 pictures, 
again, depending on your Size/Quality settings.
The table here shows the approximate file sizes 
for just some Size/Quality combinations; you can 
find a table that lists all the possibilities in your 
camera manual if you’re curious. The numbers 
here assume the default settings for the JPEG 
Compression and NEF (RAW) Recording options 
on the Shooting menu, both of which relate to 
the Image Quality setting and are detailed else-
where in this chapter.

the Control panel and Information display, as shown in Figure 3-8. For JPEG, 
the displays indicate the JPEG quality level — Fine, Normal (Norm, as in the 
figure), or Basic. (The next section explains these three options.)
Figure 3-8: The current Image Quality setting appears here.
 
In the Information display, the icons used for the Quality setting depend on 
whether you’re using a single memory card or one SD card and one 
CompactFlash card. In Figure 3-8, the symbol shows that a single SD card is 
being used. See the Chapter 1 section related to using two memory cards at 
the same time for information on how to decode this aspect of the display.
The rest of this chapter explains the pros and cons of each file format to help 
you decide which one works best for the types of pictures you take. If you 
already have your mind made up, you can select the format you want to use 
in two ways:
 
QUAL  
✓ Qual button + main command dial: Hold down the Qual (Quality) 
button while rotating the main 
command dial to cycle through 
all the format options.
 
✓ Shooting menu: You also can 
set the Image Quality option via 
the Shooting menu, as shown in 
Figure 3-9.
 
 Scroll to the second screen of 
the Shooting menu, and you find 
two additional options related 
to the Quality setting: JPEG 
Compression and NEF (RAW) 
Recording. Look for details about 
these features in the upcoming 
discussions of each format.
Figure 3-9: The Shooting menu enables 
you to select the Quality setting plus a few 
related options.

76
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
Don’t confuse file format with the Format Memory Card option on the Setup 
menu. That option erases all data on your memory card; see Chapter 1 for 
details.
JPEG: The imaging (and Web) standard 
Pronounced jay-peg, the JPEG format is the default setting on your D300s, as 
it is for most digital cameras. The next two sections tell you what you need to 
know about JPEG.
JPEG pros and cons
JPEG has become the de facto digital-camera file format for two main reasons:
 
✓ Immediate usability: All Web browsers and e-mail programs can display 
JPEG files, so you can share your pictures online immediately after you 
shoot them. The same can’t be said for NEF (RAW) or TIFF files, which 
must be converted to JPEG for online use. (Some photo-sharing sites do 
accept TIFF files and then make a JPEG copy for online display.)
 
 You also can print and edit JPEG files immediately, whether you want 
to use your own software or have pictures printed at a retail site. The 
same is true for TIFF files, but not for RAW images. You can view and 
print RAW files using Nikon ViewNX, the software that comes with your 
camera, but many third-party photo programs can’t open RAW images — 
and retail printing sites typically don’t accept RAW files either. You can 
read more about the conversion process in the upcoming section “NEF 
(RAW): The purist’s choice.”
 
✓ Small files: JPEG files are much smaller than NEF (RAW) files and way, 
way, way smaller than TIFF files. And smaller files consume less room on 
your camera memory card and in your computer’s storage tank.
The downside — you knew there had to be one — is that JPEG creates 
smaller files by applying lossy compression. This process actually throws 
away some image data. Too much compression leads to the defects you see 
in the JPEG Artifacts example in Figure 3-1.
 
Fortunately, your camera enables you to specify how much compression 
you’re willing to accept, as outlined next.
Customizing your JPEG capture settings
The D300s gives you two levels of control over the quality of your JPEG 
images:

77
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
 
✓ Fine, Normal, or Basic: When you select the file format, whether 
through the Shooting menu or by using the Qual button with the main 
command dial, you can choose from three JPEG settings, each of which 
produces a different level of compression. 
 
• JPEG Fine: At this setting, the compression ratio is 1:4 — that is, 
the file is four times smaller than it would otherwise be. In plain 
English, that means that very little compression is applied, so you 
shouldn’t see many compression artifacts, if any.
 
• JPEG Normal: Switch to Normal, and the compression ratio rises to 
1:8. The chance of seeing some artifacting increases as well.
 
• JPEG Basic: Shift to this setting, and the compression ratio jumps 
to 1:16. That’s a substantial amount of compression and brings 
with it a lot more risk of artifacting.
 
✓ Compression Priority: The size of the file produced at any of the three 
quality levels varies from picture to picture depending on the subject 
matter. The difference occurs because a picture with lots of detail and a 
wide color palette can’t be as easily compressed as one with large areas 
of flat color and a limited color spectrum.
 
 By default, the camera applies compression with a goal of producing 
consistent file sizes, which means that highly detailed photos can take a 
larger quality hit from compression. But through the JPEG Compression 
option on the Shooting menu, shown in Figure 3-10, you can tell the 
camera to instead give priority to producing optimum picture qual-
ity when applying compression. To go that route, choose the Optimal 
Quality setting, as shown in the figure. For the default option, choose 
Size Priority. Note that the compression ratios just mentioned for the 
Fine, Normal, and Basic options assume that you use the Size Priority 
option. The ratios will vary from picture to picture, as will the picture 
file sizes, if you select Optimal Quality.
Figure 3-10: Set the JPEG Compression option to Optimal Quality to get the best-looking JPEG 
pictures.

78
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Note, though, that even if you choose the Size Priority option and combine it 
with JPEG Basic — thereby producing the lowest-quality JPEG results — you 
don’t get anywhere near the level of artifacting that you see in my example 
in Figure 3-1. Again, that example is exaggerated to help you be able to rec-
ognize artifacting defects and understand how they differ from other image-
quality issues.
In fact, if you keep your image print or display size small, you aren’t likely 
to notice a great deal of quality difference between the compression set-
tings. It’s only when you greatly enlarge a photo that the differences 
become apparent.
Take a look at Figures 3-11 and 3-12, for 
example. I captured the scene in Figure 
3-11 four times, keeping the resolution 
the same for each shot so that the only 
variable was the Image Quality setting. 
I captured three JPEG versions, one at 
each compression level (Fine, Normal, 
and Basic) and using the default JPEG 
Compression option, Size Priority, which 
sets the camera to favor file sizes over 
picture quality when applying compres-
sion. For the fourth image, I used the 
RAW (NEF) format and selected the 
default RAW recording options, which 
result in a non-destructive type of file com-
pression. (See the next section for details 
about RAW options.)
For the photo you see in Figure 3-11, I used 
the JPEG Fine setting. I thought about 
printing the three other shots along with 
that example, but frankly, you wouldn’t 
be able to detect a nickel’s worth of differ-
ence between the examples at the size that 
I could print them on this page. So Figure 
3-12 shows just a portion of each shot at a greatly enlarged size. (During the 
process of converting the RAW image to a print-ready file, I tried to use set-
tings that kept the RAW image as close as possible to its JPEG cousins in all 
aspects but quality. But any variations in exposure, color, and contrast are a 
result of the conversion process, not of the format per se.)
Even at the greatly magnified size, it takes a sharp eye to detect the quality 
differences between the RAW and Fine images. When you carefully inspect 
the Normal version, you can see some artifacting start to appear, but again, 
Figure 3-11: This subject offered a good 
test for comparing the Image Quality 
settings.

79
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
you have to look closely — and my guess is that you wouldn’t spot it at all 
if you weren’t searching for it. Jump to the Basic example, and compression 
artifacting becomes more obvious.
JPEG Normal
JPEG Fine
RAW (NEF)
JPEG Basic
Figure 3-12: Here you see a portion of the tower at greatly enlarged views.
 
Nikon chose to use the JPEG Normal setting and the Size Priority option as 
the defaults on the D300s. I suppose that’s okay for everyday images that you 
don’t plan to print or display very large. And those settings do enable you to 
fit more photos on your memory card than the higher-quality JPEG settings.
For my money, though, the file-size benefit you gain when going from Fine 
to Normal and using the Size Priority option instead of Optimal Quality isn’t 
worth even a little quality loss, especially with the price of camera memory 
cards getting lower every day. You never know when a casual snapshot is 
going to turn out to be so great that you want to print or display it large 
enough that even minor quality loss becomes a concern. And of all the 
defects that you can correct in a photo editor, artifacting is one of the hard-
est to remove. So if I shoot in the JPEG format, I stick with Fine and set the 
JPEG Compression option to Optimal Quality.

80
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
I suggest that you do your own test shots, however, carefully inspect the 
results in your photo editor, and make your own judgment about what level 
of artifacting you can accept. Artifacting is often much easier to spot when 
you view images onscreen. It’s difficult to reproduce artifacting here in print 
because the print process obscures some of the tiny defects caused by com-
pression.
If you don’t want any risk of artifacting, bypass JPEG altogether and change 
the file type to NEF (RAW) or TIFF. Or consider your other option, which is to 
record two versions of each file, one RAW and one JPEG. The next sections 
offer details.
 
Whichever format you select, be aware of one more important rule for pre-
serving the original image quality: If you retouch pictures in your photo soft-
ware, don’t save the altered images in the JPEG format. Every time you alter 
and save an image in the JPEG format, you apply another round of lossy com-
pression. And with enough editing, saving, and compressing, you can eventu-
ally get to the level of image degradation shown in the JPEG example in 
Figure 3-1, at the start of this chapter. (Simply opening and closing the file 
does no harm.)
Always save your edited photos in a nondestructive format. You can’t save 
photos in the RAW format, but TIFF is available in most photo editing programs. 
Should you want to share the edited image online, create a JPEG copy of the 
TIFF file when you’re finished making all your changes. That way, you always 
retain one copy of the photo at the original quality captured by the camera. 
Chapter 9 explains how to create a JPEG copy of a photo for online sharing.
NEF (RAW): The purist’s choice
The second picture file type you can create on your D300s is called Camera 
RAW, or just RAW (as in uncooked) for short.
 
Each manufacturer has its own flavor of RAW. Nikon’s is called NEF (for 
Nikon Electronic Format), so you see the three-letter extension NEF at the 
end of RAW filenames.
RAW pros and cons
RAW is popular with advanced, very demanding photographers for these 
reasons:
 
✓ Greater creative control: With JPEG and TIFF, internal camera software 
tweaks your images, making adjustments to color, exposure, and sharp-
ness as needed to produce the results that Nikon believes its customers 
prefer. With RAW, the camera simply records the original, unprocessed 
image data. The photographer then copies the image file to the computer 

81
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
and uses special software known as a RAW converter to produce the 
actual image, making decisions about color, exposure, and so on at 
that point. The upshot is that “shooting RAW” enables you, and not the 
camera, to have the final say on the visual characteristics of your image.
 
✓ Higher bit depth: Bit depth is a measure of how many distinct color values 
an image file can contain. When you choose JPEG or TIFF as the Image 
Quality setting, your pictures contain 8 bits each for the red, blue, and 
green color components, or channels, that make up a digital image, for a 
total of 24 bits. That translates to roughly 16.7 million possible colors.
 
 Choosing the RAW setting delivers a higher bit count. You can set the 
camera to collect 12 bits per channel or 14 bits per channel. (More 
about that option and some other RAW-related options momentarily.)
 
 Although jumping from 8 to 14 bits sounds like a huge difference, you 
may not really ever notice any impact on your photos — that 8-bit 
palette of 16.7 million values is more than enough for superb images. 
Where having the extra bits can come in handy is if you really need to 
adjust exposure, contrast, or color after the shot in your photo editing 
program. In cases where you apply extreme adjustments, having the 
extra original bits sometimes helps avoid a problem known as banding 
or posterization, which creates abrupt color breaks where you should 
see smooth, seamless transitions. (A higher bit depth doesn’t always 
prevent the problem, however, so don’t expect miracles.)
 
✓ Better picture quality: RAW doesn’t apply the destructive, lossy com-
pression associated with JPEG, so you don’t run the risk of the artifact-
ing that can occur with JPEG. On the D300s, you can choose to apply 
two alternative types of compression to reduce RAW file sizes slightly, 
but neither impact image quality to the extent of JPEG compression. Or 
you can turn off compression altogether.
As with most things in life, RAW isn’t without its disadvantages, however. 
To wit:
 
✓ You can’t do much with your pictures until you process them in a 
RAW converter. You can’t share them online, for example, or put them 
into a text document or multimedia presentation. You can print them 
immediately if you use Nikon ViewNX, but most other photo programs 
require you to convert the RAW files to a standard format first. So when 
you shoot RAW, you add to the time you must spend in front of the com-
puter instead of behind the camera lens.
 
✓ To get the full benefit of RAW, you need software other than Nikon 
ViewNX. The ViewNX software that ships free with your camera does 
have a command that enables you to convert RAW files to JPEG or to TIFF. 
However, this free tool gives you limited control over how your original 
data is translated in terms of color, exposure, and other characteristics — 
which defeats one of the primary purposes of shooting RAW.

82
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 Nikon Capture NX 2 offers a sophisticated RAW converter, but it costs 
about $180. (Sadly, if you already own Capture NX, you need to upgrade 
to version 2 to open the RAW files from your D300s.) If you own Adobe 
Photoshop or Photoshop Elements, however, you’re set; both include the 
converter that most people consider one of the best in the industry. (The 
Elements version is more limited than the Photoshop version, of course.) 
Watch the sale ads, and you can pick up Elements for well under $100. 
You may need to download an update from the Adobe Web site (www.
adobe.com) to get the converter to work with your D300s files.
 
 Of course, the D300s also offers an in-camera RAW converter, found on 
the Retouch menu. But although it’s convenient, this tool isn’t the easi-
est to use because you must rely on the small camera monitor when 
making judgments about color, exposure, sharpness, and so on. The in-
camera tool also doesn’t offer the complete cadre of features available 
in Capture NX 2 and other converter software utilities.
 
 Chapter 8 offers more information on the in-camera conversion process 
and also offers a look at the converter found in ViewNX.
 
✓ RAW files are larger than JPEGs. The type of file compression that you 
can enable for RAW files doesn’t degrade image quality to the degree 
you get with JPEG compression, but the tradeoff is a larger file. In addi-
tion, Nikon RAW files are always captured at the maximum resolution 
available on the camera, even if you don’t really need all those pixels. 
For both reasons, RAW files are significantly larger than JPEGs, so they 
take up more room on your memory card and on your computer’s hard 
drive or other picture-storage device.
Are the disadvantages worth the gain? Only you can decide. But before you 
make up your mind, refer to Figure 3-12 and compare the JPEG Fine example 
with its NEF (RAW) counterpart. You may be able to detect some subtle 
quality differences when you really study the two, but a casual viewer likely 
would not, especially if shown the entire example images at normal print 
sizes rather than the greatly magnified views shown in the figure. I took 
Figure 3-11, for example, using JPEG Fine.
 
That said, I do shoot in the RAW format when I’m dealing with tricky lighting 
because doing so gives me more control over the final image exposure. For 
example, if you use a capable RAW converter, you can specify how bright you 
want the brightest areas of your photo to appear and how dark you prefer 
your deepest shadows. With JPEG and TIFF, the camera makes those deci-
sions, which can potentially limit your flexibility if you try to adjust exposure 
in your photo editor later. And the extra bits in a RAW file offer an additional 
safety net because I usually can push the exposure adjustments a little fur-
ther in my photo editor if necessary without introducing banding.
I also go RAW if I know that I’m going to want huge prints of a subject. But keep 
in mind: I’m a photography geek, I have all the requisite software, and I don’t 
really have much else to do with my time than process scads of RAW images.

83
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
Customizing your RAW capture settings
If you opt for RAW, you can control three aspects of how your pictures are 
captured:
 
✓ RAW only or RAW+JPEG: You can choose to capture the picture in the 
RAW format or create two files for each shot, one in the RAW format and 
another in the JPEG format, as shown in Figure 3-13. The figure shows 
the list of options that appears when you change the Image Quality set-
ting through the Shooting menu; you can select from the same settings 
when you adjust the option by pressing the Qual button and rotating the 
main command dial.
 
 For RAW+JPEG, you can specify whether you want the JPEG version 
captured at the Fine, Normal, or Basic quality level, and you can set the 
resolution of the JPEG file through the Image Size option, explained ear-
lier in this chapter. Again, you don’t have a choice of Image Size settings 
for the RAW file; the camera always captures the file at the maximum 
resolution.
 
 I often choose the RAW+JPEG 
Fine option when I’m shooting 
pictures I want to share right 
away with people who don’t have 
software for viewing RAW files. I 
upload the JPEGs to a photo-shar-
ing site where everyone can view 
them and order prints, and then I 
process the RAW versions of my 
favorite images for my own use 
when I have time. Having the 
JPEG version also enables you to 
display your photos on a DVD 
player or TV that has a slot for an 
SD or Compact Flash memory 
card — most can’t display RAW 
files but can handle JPEGs. Ditto for portable media players and digital 
photo frames. 
 
✓ RAW bit depth: You can specify whether you want a 12-bit RAW file or 
a 14-bit RAW file. More bits means a bigger file but a larger spectrum 
of possible colors, as explained in the preceding section. You make the 
call through the NEF (RAW) Recording option on the Shooting menu, as 
shown in Figure 3-14. Be aware that choosing the 14-bit option reduces 
the maximum burst rate you can achieve when using either of the con-
tinuous Release mode settings to 2.5 frames per second. (Chapter 2 dis-
cusses the Release mode options.)
Figure 3-13: You can create two files for each 
picture, one in the RAW format and a second 
in the JPEG format.

84
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 3-14: Set the file bit depth through this Shooting menu option.
 
✓ RAW compression: By default, the camera applies lossless compression 
to RAW files. As its name implies, this type of compression results in no 
visible loss of image quality and yet still reduces file sizes by about 20 to 
40 percent. In addition, the compression is reversible, meaning that any 
quality loss that does occur through the compression process can be 
undone at the time you process your RAW images.
 
 You can choose from two other options, again through the NEF (RAW) 
Recording option on the Shooting menu. After selecting that option, 
choose Type, as shown on the left in Figure 3-15, to display the screen 
shown on the right. The Compressed setting achieves a greater degree 
of file-size savings, shrinking files by about 40 to 55 percent. Nikon prom-
ises that this setting has “almost no effect” on image quality. But the 
compression in this case is not reversible, so if you do experience some 
quality loss, there’s no going back. The third option, Uncompressed, 
applies no compression at all to your file, resulting in the largest files of 
the three settings but no chance of any compression quality loss.
Figure 3-15: You can choose to apply one of two types of compression or leave RAW files 
uncompressed.

85
 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
 
Together, the choices you make for these three settings make a big difference 
in the size of your picture files and, thus, your memory card capacity. If you 
combine the 14-bit file type with the Uncompressed setting, a single picture file 
consumes about 25.4MB of card space. A 12-bit file captured at the compressed 
setting, by contrast, is only 10.5MB — still large, but less than half that of the 
“ultimate RAW” 14-bit, uncompressed file. And if you choose RAW+JPEG cap-
ture, well, just add the size of the JPEG file into the equation. If you choose the 
14-bit and Uncompressed settings for the RAW file and create the second file as 
a JPEG Fine at the highest resolution, for example, the combined size of the 
RAW plus JPEG files is (gulp) 31.4MB (25.4MB for the RAW file plus 6MB for the 
Large/Fine JPEG).
For my purposes, the default RAW settings — 12-bit RAW with Lossless 
Compression — serve me well. And frankly, I doubt that too many people 
could perceive much difference between a photo captured at that setting 
and a 14-bit, uncompressed picture. But if you are using your D300s for com-
mercial photography — whether you shoot weddings, do high-end studio 
work, or shoot fine-art photography for sale — you may feel more comfort-
able knowing that you’re capturing files at the absolute maximum quality and 
bit depth. The higher bit depth also may make sense if you’re shooting in 
really difficult lighting because, again, it gives you the potential of capturing a 
broader range of colors and tones.
If you choose to create both a RAW and JPEG file, note a couple of things:
 
✓ If you’re using only one memory card, you see the JPEG version of the 
photo during playback. However, the Image Quality data that appears 
with the photo reflects your capture setting (RAW+Basic, for example). 
To use the in-camera RAW processing option on the Retouch menu, dis-
play the JPEG image and then proceed as outlined in Chapter 8.
 
✓ If both the JPEG and RAW files are stored on the same memory card, 
deleting the JPEG image also deletes the RAW copy. See Chapter 1 to 
find out how you can send the two versions to separate memory cards 
instead. If you go that route, deleting one file doesn’t delete the other. 
(Either way, after you transfer the two files to your computer, deleting 
one doesn’t affect the other.)
Chapter 4 explains more about viewing and deleting photos.
TIFF: A mixed bag
Whereas most cameras limit you to a choice of RAW or JPEG files, the D300s 
gives you a third format option, TIFF, as shown in Figure 3-16. The acronym 
stands for tagged image file format, and it’s pronounced tiff, as in tiny spat. 
The RGB next to the format name indicates that the file is being created using 
the RGB (red-green-blue) color model, explained in Chapter 6. JPEG and RAW 
files are also RGB files, and no, I can’t tell you why the designation appears 
only with the TIFF option in the menus. However, I can tell you that when you 

86
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
view your pictures during playback, 
the file type data shows RGB instead 
of TIFF.
As with RAW and JPEG, TIFF has its 
good side and bad side:
 
✓ The good: Like RAW, TIFF 
doesn’t involve the destructive 
compression you get with JPEG. 
In fact, absolutely no compres-
sion is applied to TIFF files. That 
translates to better image qual-
ity than JPEG. Unlike RAW files, 
though, TIFF files don’t have to 
be converted to a standard format because TIFF is a standard format. 
In fact, it’s been the leading format for files destined for print for many 
years. So you can print, view, and edit TIFF files in most photo pro-
grams immediately after you download them from the camera. Most 
retail printing outlets also can print TIFF files. The only thing you can’t 
do with a TIFF file right out of the camera is view it in an e-mail pro-
gram or Web browser — for that, you need JPEG.
 
✓ The bad: TIFF files are huge. Wait — make that huuggggge. Captured at 
the highest resolution setting (Large), a TIFF file weighs in at 36.6MB! 
That’s significantly larger than the 25.4MB required for a RAW file, even 
when you use the highest RAW bit depth and apply no compression to 
the file. 
 
 You can reduce the TIFF file size by setting the Image Size to the lowest 
resolution setting (Small), in which case your final file size is 9.3MB. 
However, you can’t modify file sizes by using different compression 
options as you can for RAW and JPEG.
 
 The D300s also caps out bit depth for TIFF files at 8 bits per channel, the 
same as for JPEG files. So not only do you get larger files than with RAW, 
but you don’t even gain the expanded color spectrum of a 12- or 14-bit 
RAW for your trouble.
So who exactly is this format designed to please? Well, I can think of a couple 
of scenarios that would make TIFF a good choice:
 
✓ You’re shooting for a publication or client that requires you to submit 
files in the TIFF format, and you’re on a tight deadline. Instead of taking 
the time to download your RAW or JPEG originals and then convert 
them to TIFF, you can send the TIFF files directly.
 
✓ You’re after the slightly better image quality provided by TIFF but you 
don’t have the time, interest, or software required to process RAW files.
Figure 3-16: TIFF is the standard format used 
in print publishing.

 Chapter 3: Controlling Picture Quality and Size
You should know, however, that any quality differences between a picture shot 
at the highest quality JPEG settings and a TIFF file are usually pretty difficult 
to detect — although again, the larger you print your files, the more even the 
slightest quality difference becomes important. Because I don’t find the quality 
difference worth the substantially larger file sizes, I don’t use this format unless 
I need that TIFF file right away, with no time to get to the computer.
Summing up: My take on which format to use when
At this point, you may find all this technical goop a bit much — I recognize 
that panicked look in your eyes — so allow me to simplify things for you. 
Until you have the time or energy to completely digest all the ramifications of 
JPEG versus RAW versus TIFF, here’s a quick summary of my thoughts on the 
matter:
 
✓ If you require the absolute best image quality and have the time and 
interest to do the RAW conversion, shoot RAW. Set the RAW file options 
(bit depth and compression type) to suit your specific needs, but 
remember that the maximum bit depth and minimum compression mean 
really big files. So you’ll need lots of storage space both on your memory 
cards and on your computer’s hard drives. Again, I opt for 12-bit RAW 
files with the default compression setting (Lossless Compressed). See 
Chapter 8 for more information on the conversion process.
 
✓ If great photo quality is good enough for you, you don’t have wads of 
spare time, or you aren’t that comfortable with the computer, stick with 
JPEG Fine and set the JPEG Compression option on the Shooting menu 
to Optimal Quality.
 
✓ If you don’t mind the added file-storage space requirement and want the 
flexibility of both formats, choose RAW+JPEG. If you need your JPEGs to 
exhibit the best quality, go with RAW+JPEG Fine. 
 
✓ If you go with JPEG only, stay away from JPEG Normal and Basic. The 
tradeoff for smaller files isn’t, in my opinion, worth the risk of compres-
sion artifacts. As with my recommendations on image size, this fits the 
“better safe than sorry” formula: You never know when you may capture 
a spectacular, enlargement-worthy subject, and it would be a shame to 
have the photo spoiled by compression defects. If you select RAW+JPEG, 
of course, this isn’t as much of an issue because you always have the 
RAW version as backup if you aren’t happy with the JPEG quality. 
 
✓ If you want top quality but don’t want to deal with RAW processing, you 
can opt for TIFF. But again, stock up on memory cards and extra hard 
drive storage space — at almost 40MB per picture file, you’ll run out of 
space quickly.

Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Do you need high-speed memory cards?
Memory cards are categorized not just by their 
storage capacity, but also by their data-transfer 
speed. But sorting out the numbers requires a 
little background:
 ✓ CompactFlash (CF) cards are rated accord-
ing to the same standards used for CD-ROM 
recording devices, where speed is based 
on transferring a 150K (kilobyte) chunk of 
data. A rating of 1x equals 150K (kilobytes) 
per second. As I write this, a card with a 
max speed rating of 666X has just been 
announced, although is not yet on the 
market.
 ✓ SD and SDHC cards sometimes also use 
the “X” speed ratings but more recently 
are categorized according to one of three 
speed classes, Class 2, Class 4, and Class 
6, with the number indicating the minimum 
number of megabytes (roughly 1,000 kilo-
bytes) transferred per second. A Class 2 
card, for example, has a minimum transfer 
speed of 2 megabytes, or MB, per second.
Of course, with the speed increase comes 
a price increase. Should you make the extra 
investment? It depends. Photographers who 
shoot action benefit most from high-speed 
cards — the faster data-transfer rate helps the 
camera record shots at its maximum speed. 
Users who shoot at the highest resolution or 
prefer the NEF (RAW) file format also gain from 
high-speed cards; both options increase file 
size and, thus, the time needed to store the 
picture on the card. (See Chapter 3 for details.) 
Finally, you typically get better movie-recording 
performance from high-speed cards. As for pic-
ture downloading, how long it takes for files to 
shuffle from card to computer depends not just 
on card speed, but also on the capabilities of 
your computer and, if you use a memory card 
reader to download files, on the speed of that 
device. (Chapter 8 covers the file-downloading 
process.)
Long story short, if you want to push your 
camera to its performance limits, a high-speed 
card is worth considering, assuming budget is 
no issue. Otherwise, just about card currently 
on the market you can buy today should be 
more than adequate for most photographers 
(assuming that you’re buying new, as opposed 
to snapping up some 5-year old cards being 
sold in an online auction).

Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, 
Live View, and Movie Recording
In This Chapter
▶ Exploring picture playback functions
▶ Deciphering the picture information displays
▶ Deleting bad pictures and protecting great ones
▶ Using the monitor as viewfinder in Live View mode
▶ Recording and editing digital movies
W
ithout question, my favorite thing about digital photography is being 
able to view my pictures on the camera monitor the instant 
after I shoot them. No more guessing whether I captured the 
image I wanted or I need to try again, as in the film era. And 
no more wasting money on developing and printing pic-
tures that stink.
Of course, with the D300s, you can use the monitor 
not only to review your photos, but also to preview 
them. That is, if you turn on Live View shooting, 
you can use the monitor instead of the viewfinder 
to compose your shots. And not just for still pic-
tures: You can record short digital movies, too, 
complete with sound.
Because all these functions involve some of the same 
buttons, bells, and whistles, I cover them together in 
this chapter. In addition, this chapter explains how to hide 
or delete pictures that you don’t like and protect the ones you 

90
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
love from accidental erasure. (Be sure to also visit Chapter 9, which covers 
some additional ways to view your images, including how to create slide 
shows and display your photos and movies on a television screen.)
Customizing Basic Playback Options
You can control many aspects of picture playback on the D300s. Later sec-
tions show you how to choose what type of data appears with your pictures, 
how to display multiple images at a time, and how to magnify an image for a 
close-up look. But first, the next few sections explain options that affect over-
all playback performance, including how long your pictures appear onscreen, 
how they’re oriented on the monitor, and what functions you can perform 
with the Multi Selector.
Adjusting playback timing
You can adjust the length of time the camera displays your images on the 
monitor as follows:
 
✓ Adjust the timing of automatic playback shutoff. After you press the 
Playback button to begin reviewing your pictures, the monitor turns off 
automatically if 10 seconds go by without any further button presses. I 
find that playback time maddeningly brief when I’m trying to study a pic-
ture. Fortunately, you can adjust the shutoff timing through the Monitor 
Off Delay option, found in the Timers/AE Lock section of the Custom 
Setting menu and shown on the left in Figure 4-1. Choose Playback, as 
shown on the right, to access the timing options, which range from four 
seconds to 10 minutes. (If you’re powering the camera with the optional 
AC adapter, the monitor shutdown occurs at the 10-minute mark regard-
less of any settings you select from the Monitor Off Delay menu.)
Figure 4-1: You can control how long pictures are displayed before automatic monitor 
shutdown occurs.

91
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
 
✓ Enable instant review. You can 
tell the camera to display each 
image for a quick review immedi-
ately after you shoot it. Because 
any monitor use is a strain on 
battery power, this feature is dis-
abled by default; you enable it 
through the Image Review option 
on the Playback menu, shown in 
Figure 4-2.
 
✓ Adjust the length of the instant-
review period. By default, the 
instant-review period lasts four 
seconds, but you can adjust 
this timing through the Monitor 
Off Delay option shown in Figure 4-1 as well. Just choose Image Review 
instead of Playback when you get to the right screen in the figure. Again, 
settings range from four seconds to ten minutes.
Enabling automatic picture rotation
When you take a picture, the camera can record the image orientation — 
whether you held the camera normally, creating a horizontally oriented 
image, or turned the camera on its side to shoot a vertically oriented photo. 
This bit of data is simply added into the picture file.
During playback, the camera can then read the data and automatically rotate 
the image so that it appears in the upright position, as shown on the left in 
Figure 4-3. The image is also automatically rotated when you view it in Nikon 
ViewNX, Capture NX 2, and some other photo programs that can interpret 
the data.
Figure 4-3: You can display vertically oriented pictures in their upright position (left) or 
sideways (right).
Figure 4-2: Head for the Playback menu to 
enable or disable instant review.

92
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
Official photo lingo uses the term portrait orientation to refer to vertically 
oriented pictures and landscape orientation to refer to horizontally oriented 
pictures.
On the D300s, you set up your rotation wishes through the following two 
menu options, both shown in Figure 4-4:
 
✓ Auto Image Rotation: This option, on the Setup menu, determines 
whether the orientation data is included in the picture file. The default 
setting is On; select Off to leave the data out.
 
✓ Rotate Tall: Found on the Playback menu, this option controls whether 
the camera pays attention to the orientation data. The default setting is 
Off. Select On, as shown in the figure, if you want the camera to rotate 
the image during playback. 
Note that regardless of these settings, your pictures aren’t rotated during 
the instant review period. Also, be aware that shooting with the lens pointing 
directly up or down sometimes confuses the camera, causing it to record the 
wrong data in the file.
Customizing the Multi Selector’s role during playback
At the camera’s default settings, the Multi Selector performs these functions 
after you press the Playback button to view your pictures:
 
✓ Pressing right or left scrolls from one picture to the next.
 
✓ Pressing up or down changes the Information display mode, which con-
trols what shooting data appears with the image.
 
✓ Pressing the center button toggles the display from showing a single 
image to thumbnail views of multiple photos.
Figure 4-4: Visit the Setup and Playback menus to enable or disable image rotation.

93
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
The rest of this chapter assumes that you stick with these defaults. But 
you do have the option of customizing the Multi Selector’s role through the 
Custom Setting menu. Choose Controls, as shown on the left in Figure 4-5, 
and then press OK to display the right screen. You can then customize the 
playback functions as follows:
 
✓ Swap the right/left and up/down functions. Want to scroll through pic-
tures by pressing up and down instead of left and right? You can accom-
plish this by setting the Photo Info/Playback option, highlighted on the 
right in Figure 4-5, to On. You then change the Information display mode 
by pressing right/left.
 
✓ Change the function of the center button. To choose the role of the 
center button, use the Multi Selector Center Button option (the Custom 
Setting menu item two steps above the Photo Info/Playback option). 
After you choose that menu item and press OK, you see the left screen 
in Figure 4-6. Highlight Playback Mode and press OK to get to the right 
screen, where you can assign the button function.
Figure 4-5: Use the Photo Info/Playback option to control the functions of the left/right and 
up/down buttons.
Figure 4-6: This option sets the playback purpose of the center button. 

94
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 Here’s what pressing the button does at each setting:
 
• Thumbnail On/Off: Toggles between thumbnails display to single-
picture display (the default setting).
 
• View Histograms: Temporarily overlays a histogram over your 
image. See the upcoming section “RGB Histogram mode” for a look 
at this feature, which is my preferred use of the button.
 
• Zoom On/Off: Displays a magnified view of the photo that is 
automatically centered on the focus point you used when taking 
the shot. You also can magnify a photo by pressing the Zoom In 
button, as explained in the later section “Zooming in for a closer 
view.” But if you want to use the Multi Selector button for this 
purpose, highlight Zoom On/Off and then press the Multi Selector 
right to display a screen where you set the magnification level 
(low, medium, or high) of the zoomed view.
 
• Choose Slot and Folder: Displays a screen where you can select 
a memory card and folder to view. Again, you can accomplish 
the same thing in other ways; see the next section as well as see 
“Viewing multiple images at a time” for details.
 
You also can change the role that the center button plays during shooting; 
Chapter 10 has details on those options.
Viewing Images in Playback Mode
To review your photos, take these steps:
 
1. Select the image folder you want to view.
 
 Your D300s organizes pictures automatically into folders that are 
assigned generic names: 100D300s, 101D300s, and so on. You can see 
the name of the current folder by looking at the Active Folder option on 
the Shooting menu. (The default folder name appears as just 100 on the 
menu.) You also can create custom folders through a process outlined 
in Chapter 10.
 
 To choose the folder you want to view, open the Playback menu and 
select the Playback Folder option, as shown on the left in Figure 4-7, to 
access these three options:
 
• D300s (default setting): Displays all pictures shot with your camera, 
regardless of their folder location. If you’re using two memory 
cards, pictures on both cards are displayed.

95
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
 
• All: Displays all pictures in all folders, even those taken with other 
cameras (as long as they are in a format the camera can display — 
JPEG, TIFF, or NEF). Again, pictures from both memory cards are 
displayed.
 
• Current: Displays images contained in the active folder only. The 
camera looks to the Active Folder option on the Shooting menu to 
determine which folder’s photos to display.
Figure 4-7: Specify which folder you want to view through this option.
 
 
2. Press the Playback button, labeled in Figure 4-8.
 
 The monitor displays the last picture you took, along with some picture 
data, such as the frame number of the photo and the memory card that 
holds the photo, as shown in the figure. To find out how to interpret 
the picture information and specify what data you want to see, see the 
upcoming section “Viewing Picture Data.” 
 
3. To scroll through your pictures, press the Multi Selector right 
or left.
 
 This assumes the default settings are used for the playback functions 
of the Multi Selector, as explained in the preceding section.
 
4. To return to picture-taking mode, press the Playback button again 
or press the shutter button halfway and then release it.
 
These steps assume that the camera is currently set to display a single photo 
at a time, as shown in Figure 4-8. You can also display multiple images at a 
time, as explained next.

Figure 4-8: Use these controls to navigate through your photos.
Viewing multiple images at a time
Along with viewing images one at a time, you can choose to display 4, 9, or 72 
thumbnails, as shown in Figure 4-9. Use these techniques to change to thumb-
nails view and navigate your photos:
 
 
✓ Display thumbnails. Press the Zoom Out button once to cycle from sin-
gle-picture view to 4-thumbnail view, press again to shift to 9-picture 
view, and press once more to bring up those itty-bitty thumbnails fea-
tured in 72-image view.
 
 
✓ Display fewer thumbnails. Press the Zoom In button. Again, your first 
press takes you from 72 thumbnails to 9, your second press to 4 thumb-
nails, and your third press returns you to single-image view.
 
✓ Jump from any thumbnail display to full-frame view. Press the OK 
button.

97

Selected photo
Current memory card
Figure 4-9: You can view 4, 9, or 72 thumbnails at once.
 
✓ Toggle between thumbnails view and full-frame view. By default, the 
center button of the Multi Selector performs this function. However, you 
can set the button to perform another function during picture playback, 
as explained in the earlier section “Customizing the Multi Selector’s role 
during playback.”
 
✓ Scroll the display. Press the Multi Selector up and down to scroll to the 
next or previous screen of thumbnails. Again, this assumes the default 
setup for the Multi Selector’s playback functions.
 
 If you’re using dual memory cards, you can tell which card contains the 
picture you’re viewing in the thumbnails display by looking at the card 
icons, labeled in Figure 4-9. The icon for the current card is yellow. Note 
that the location of the icons depends on how many thumbnails you’re 
viewing. In the 72-thumbnail view, they’re in the lower-left corner.
 
✓ Select an image. To perform certain playback functions, such as delet-
ing a photo or protecting it, you first need to select an image. A yellow 
box surrounds the currently selected image, as shown in Figure 4-9. To 
select a different image, use the Multi Selector to move the highlight box 
over the image. 

98
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Jump to the first picture in a 
folder. After you bring up the 
72-thumbnail display, you can 
press the Zoom Out button one 
more time to display the screen 
shown in Figure 4-10. From there, 
you can select a memory card, 
press OK, and then select a spe-
cific folder. Press OK once more, 
and the first picture contained 
in that folder becomes selected 
automatically.
 
 You have the option of using 
the center button of the Multi 
Selector to bring up the card/
folder selection screen if you 
don’t want to use it to toggle 
between full frame and thumbnails view. Again, see the aforementioned 
section about customizing the Multi Selector for help.
 
 Either way, the folders that appear when you display the card/folder 
selection screen shown in Figure 4-10 depend on the setting of the 
Playback Folder option on the Playback menu. See Step 1 in the preced-
ing section for details. And check out Chapter 10 to find out how to set 
up custom folders.
Zooming in for a closer view
After displaying a photo in single-frame view, you can magnify it to get a 
close-up look at important details, such as whether someone’s eyes are 
closed in a portrait. Here’s the scoop:
 
 
✓ Zoom in. Press the Zoom In button. You can magnify the image to a max-
imum of 13 to 27 times its original display size, depending on the resolu-
tion (pixel count) of the photo. Just keep pressing the button until you 
reach the magnification you want. Notice the symbol on the button: the 
magnifying glass with the plus sign, indicating zoom in.
 
 As detailed in the section “Customizing the Multi Selector’s role during 
playback,” you can set the center button to immediately zoom your view 
to one of three preset magnification levels. The advantage of this option 
is that the display is automatically centered on the focus point you used 
when taking the picture, whereas pressing the Zoom In button zooms to 
the center of the frame. If you do use the center button to zoom, know 
that after you press the button to get to your selected magnification 
level, you can zoom in further by using the Zoom In button.
 
 
✓ Zoom out. To zoom out to a reduced magnification, press the Zoom Out 
button. This button also sports the magnifying glass symbol, but this 
time with a minus sign to indicate that it reduces the display size. That 
Figure 4-10: From the 72-thumbnail display, 
press the Zoom Out button to access this 
screen, which enables you to jump to a 
different card slot or folder. 

99
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
little grid-like thingy next to the 
magnifying glass reminds you 
that the button also comes into 
play when you want to go from 
full-frame view to one of the 
thumbnail views. 
 
✓ View another part of the mag-
nified picture. When an image 
is magnified, a little navigation 
thumbnail showing the entire 
image appears briefly in the 
lower-right corner of the monitor. 
For example, Figure 4-11 shows a 
zoomed view of the scene shown 
earlier, in Figure 4-8. The yellow 
outline in this picture-in-picture 
image indicates the area that’s currently consuming the rest of the moni-
tor space. Use the Multi Selector to scroll the yellow box and display 
a different portion of the image. After a few seconds, the navigation 
thumbnail disappears; just press the Multi Selector in any direction to 
redisplay it.
 
✓ Inspect faces. When you magnify 
portraits, the picture-in-picture 
thumbnail displays a white 
border around each face, as 
shown in Figure 4-12. Rotate the 
sub-command dial to examine 
each face at the magnified view. 
Unfortunately, the camera some-
times fails to detect faces, espe-
cially if the subject isn’t looking 
directly at the camera. But when 
it works correctly, this is a pretty 
great tool for checking for closed 
eyes, red-eye, and, of course, 
spinach in the teeth.
 
✓ View more images at the same magnification. Here’s another neat trick: 
While the display is zoomed, you can rotate the main command dial to 
display the same area of the next photo at the same magnification. So if 
you shot the same subject several times, you can easily check how the 
same details appear in each one.
 
✓ Return to full-frame view. When you’re ready to return to the normal 
magnification level, you don’t need to keep pressing the Zoom Out 
button until you’re all the way zoomed out. Instead, just press the OK 
button. The center button of the Multi Selector also returns you to the 
standard, full-frame view, regardless of what function you assign the 
button for playback.

the yellow outline over the area you want to 
inspect.

jump between faces in a portrait.

Viewing Picture Data
In single-image picture view, you can choose from different photo informa-
tion modes, each of which presents a different set of shooting data along 
with the image.
Upcoming sections provide you with a decoder ring to the details you 
see in each display mode. First, though, a little setup work is in order, as 
detailed next.
Enabling hidden data-display options
By default, three of the five picture-data display modes are disabled, as is an 
option that enables you to view the focus point you used when taking the pic-
ture. You can access these hidden options through the Display Mode option 
on the Playback menu, as shown in Figure 4-13.
Figure 4-13: These display options are disabled by default.
The options work as follows:
 
✓ Focus Point: When this option is 
turned on, a little red rectangle 
appears to mark the focus point, 
as shown in Figure 4-14. You also 
see the same brackets that rep-
resent the autofocus area in the 
viewfinder. These focus indicators 
appear only when you use the 
Information display mode shown 
in the figure — File Information 
mode, covered in the next sec-
tion. They aren’t displayed if you 
focused manually or used the 
Focus point

used when taking the photo.

 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
Auto Area AF-area mode setting. I find the focus marks distracting, but 
make your own call.
 
✓ Highlights/RGB Histogram/Data: These options control the three 
display modes that are hidden by default, all covered later in this 
chapter.
A check mark in the box next to the option means that the feature is turned on. 
In Figure 4-13, for example, all four options are enabled. To toggle the check 
mark on and off, highlight the option and then press the Multi Selector right.
 
After turning on the options you want to use, be sure to highlight Done 
(at the top of the screen) and press OK again. Otherwise, the settings you 
selected don’t stick.
The next sections explain exactly what details you can glean from each dis-
play mode. I present them here in the order they appear if you cycle through 
the modes by pressing the Multi Selector down. You can spin through the 
modes in the other direction by pressing the Multi Selector up.
File Information mode
In the File Information display mode, the monitor displays the data shown in 
Figure 4-15. Here’s the key to what information appears, starting at the top of 
the screen and working down:
Protect Status
Retouch indicator
Frame Number/Total Pictures
Date/Time
Filename
Image Authentication
Image Size
Image Quality
Card/Folder Name
Figure 4-15: In File Information mode, you can view 
these bits of data.

102
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Protect Status: A little key icon indicates that you used the camera’s 
file-protection feature to prevent the image from being erased when you 
use the camera’s Delete function. See “Protecting Photos,” later in this 
chapter, to find out more. (Note: Formatting your memory card, a topic 
discussed in Chapter 1, does erase even protected pictures.) This area 
appears empty if you didn’t apply protection.
 
✓ Retouch Indicator: This icon appears if you used any of the Retouch 
menu options to alter the image. (I cover most Retouch features in 
Chapter 11.) Again, no icon means that you didn’t retouch the photo.
 
✓ Frame Number/Total Pictures: The first value here indicates the frame 
number of the currently displayed photo; the second tells you the total 
number of pictures on the memory card. In Figure 4-15, for example, the 
image is number 2 out of 4.
 
✓ Focus point: If you enable the Focus Point feature, as outlined in the pre-
ceding section, you see the red focus-point indicator and the autofocus 
area brackets, as shown in Figure 4-14. But note that for pictures that you 
took using continuous-servo autofocus, you see the point only if you set 
the AF-area mode to Single Point or Dynamic Area. (Chapter 6 explains 
all this autofocus stuff.) And for pictures taken with manual focusing, the 
focus point doesn’t appear during playback at all.
 
✓ Card and Folder Name: Here you can see which card and folder con-
tains the photo. Folders are named automatically by the camera unless 
you create custom folders, an advanced trick you can explore in 
Chapter 10. The first camera-created folder is named 100D300s. Each 
folder can contain up to 9999 images; when you exceed that limit, 
the camera creates a new folder and assigns the next folder number: 
101D300s, 102D300s, and so on.
 
✓ Filename: The camera also automatically names your files. Filenames 
end with a three-letter code that represents the file format, which is 
either JPG (for JPEG), TIF (for TIFF), or NEF (for Camera RAW) for still 
photos. Chapter 3 discusses these formats. If you record a movie (a proj-
ect you can explore near the end of this chapter), the file extension is 
AVI, which represents a digital-movie file format. If you create a dust-off 
reference image file, an advanced feature designed for use with Nikon 
Capture NX 2, the camera instead uses the extension NDF. (Because this 
software must be purchased separately, I don’t cover it or the dust-off 
function in this book.)
 
 The first four characters of filenames also vary. Here’s what the possible 
codes indicate:
 
• DSC_: This code means you captured the photo at the default Color 
Space setting, sRGB. You can investigate this option in Chapter 6.
 
• _DSC: If you change the Color Space setting to Adobe RGB, the 
underscore character comes first. (The exception is dust-off refer-
ence photos, which don’t use the underscore.)

 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
 
 Each image is also assigned a four-digit file number, starting with 0001. 
When you reach image 9999, the file numbering restarts at 0001, and the 
new images go into a new folder to prevent any possibility of overwriting 
the existing image files. For more information about file numbering, see 
the Chapter 1 section that discusses the File Number Sequence option.
 
✓ Date and Time: Just below the folder and filename info, you see the 
date and time that you took the picture. Of course, the accuracy of this 
data depends on whether you set the camera’s date and time values cor-
rectly, which you do via the Setup menu. Chapter 1 has details.
 
✓ Image Authentication: If you enable this feature, available on the Setup 
menu, you see the little stamp icon shown in Figure 4-15. Because this 
option relates to an optional Nikon software package, I don’t cover it in 
this book.
 
✓ Image Quality: Here you can see which Image Quality setting you used 
when taking the picture. Image Quality determines the file format. Again, 
Chapter 3 has details, but the short story is this: Fine, Normal, and Basic 
are the three JPEG recording options, with Fine representing the highest 
JPEG quality. The word RAW indicates that the picture was recorded 
in the Nikon Camera RAW format, NEF. And for TIFF files, you see the 
letters RGB (which stand for red, green, blue, the primary color compo-
nents of a digital image).
 
✓ Image Size: This value tells you the image resolution, or pixel count. See 
Chapter 3 to find out about resolution.
Highlights display mode
One of the most difficult photo problems to correct in a photo editing pro-
gram is known as blown highlights in some circles and clipped highlights in 
others. In plain English, both terms mean that highlights — the brightest 
areas of the image — are so overexposed that areas that should include 
a variety of light shades are instead totally white. For example, in a cloud 
image, pixels that should be light to very light gray become white due to 
overexposure, resulting in a loss of detail in those clouds.
In Highlights display mode, areas that the camera thinks may be overexposed 
blink in the camera monitor. To fully understand all the features of this mode, 
though, you need to know a little about digital imaging science.
 
As mentioned earlier, digital images are called RGB images because they 
are created out of three primary colors of light: red, green, and blue. In 
Highlights mode, you can display the exposure warning for all three color 
components — sometimes called color channels — combined or view the 
data for each individual channel.

104
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
When you look at the brightness data for a single channel, though, greatly 
overexposed areas don’t translate to white in photos — rather, they result 
in a solid blob of some other color. I don’t have space in this book to pro-
vide a full lesson in RGB color theory, but the short story is that when you 
mix together red, green, and blue light, and each component is at maximum 
brightness, you get white. Zero brightness in all three channels gives you 
black. But if you have maximum red and no blue or green, you have fully satu-
rated red. If you mix together two channels at maximum brightness, you also 
get full saturation. For example, maximum red and blue produce fully satu-
rated magenta. And wherever colors are fully saturated, you can lose picture 
detail. For example, a rose petal that should have a range of tones from light 
to dark red may instead be bright red throughout.
The moral of the story is that when you view your photo in single-channel 
display, large areas of blinking highlights in one or two channels indicate that 
you may be losing color details. Blinking highlights that appear in the same 
spot in all three channels indicate blown highlights — again, because when 
you have maximum red, green, and blue, you get white. Either way, you may 
want to adjust your exposure settings and try again.
Okay, with today’s science lesson 
out of the way, Figure 4-16 shows 
you how the screen looks when you 
view a picture in Highlights display 
mode. Remember, if you want to use 
this mode, follow the instructions in 
the “Enabling hidden data-display 
options” section, earlier in this chap-
ter, to enable it.
 
 In the lower-left corner of the display, 
the letters that appear yellow tell you 
whether you’re looking at a single 
channel (R, G, or B) or the three-chan-
nel, composite display (RGB). The 
latter is selected in the figure. To cycle 
between the settings, press the Zoom 
Out button as you press the Multi 
Selector right or left.
Along with the blinking highlight warning, Highlights display mode presents 
the standard bits of information in this mode: the Protect Status, Retouch 
Indicator, and File Number/Total Pictures values, all explained in the preced-
ing section. The label Highlights also appears to let you know the current dis-
play mode, as shown in Figure 4-16.
Composite display
Single channel display

areas indicate blown highlights.

RGB Histogram mode
Press the Multi Selector down to shift from Highlights mode to this mode, 
which displays your image in the manner shown in Figure 4-17. (Remember: 
You can view your picture in this mode only if you enable it via the Display 
Mode option on the Playback menu.)
 
 This mode is sort of like Highlights mode on steroids. As with Highlights 
mode, you can display the blinking warning in the image thumbnail and view 
the warning for either the composite image (RGB) or each individual channel. 
Again, press the Zoom Out button and press the Multi Selector right to cycle 
between the single-channel and multichannel views.
Underneath the image thumbnail, you see just a few pieces of data. As with 
File Information mode, you see the Protect Status and Retouch Indicator 
icons if you used those features. Beneath that, you see the White Balance 
settings used for the shot. (White balance is a color feature you can explore 
in Chapter 6.) The first value tells you the setting (Auto, in the figure), and 
the two number values tell you whether you fine-tuned that setting along 
the amber to blue axis (first value) or green to magenta axis (second value). 
Zeros, as in the figure, indicate no fine-tuning.
In addition, you get those chart-like thingies, called histograms. You actu-
ally get two types of histograms: The top one is a Brightness histogram and 
reflects the composite, three-channel image data. The three others represent 
the data for the single red, green, and blue channels. This trio is sometimes 
called an RGB Histogram, thus the display mode name.
Brightness Histogram

106
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
The next two sections explain what you can discern from the histograms. But 
first, here are two cool tricks to remember:
 
 
✓ If you press the Zoom In button while in this display mode, you can 
zoom the thumbnail to a magnified view. The histograms then update to 
reflect only the magnified area of the photo. To return to the regular 
view and once again see the whole-image histogram, press OK.
 
✓ You can set the center button of the Multi Selector to temporarily display 
a brightness histogram over your photo, as shown on the right in Figure 
4-17. You can access this feature in any of the display modes — File 
Information, Highlights, whatever. Additionally, you can bring up the his-
togram even in thumbnails playback view. When you let up on the button, 
you return to the normal screen for the display mode you’re using. 
For details on setting the button to this function, check out the section 
“Customizing the Multi Selector’s role in playback mode,” earlier in this 
chapter.
Reading a Brightness histogram
You can get an idea of image exposure by viewing your photo on the camera 
monitor and by looking at the “blinkies” in Highlight mode. But the Brightness 
histogram provides a way to gauge exposure that’s a little more detailed.
A Brightness histogram indicates the distribution of shadows, highlights, and 
midtones (areas of medium brightness) in your image. Figure 4-18 shows you 
a sample histogram.
The horizontal axis of the histogram rep-
resents the possible picture brightness 
values — the maximum tonal range, in 
photography-speak — from the darkest 
shadows on the left to the brightest high-
lights on the right. And the vertical axis 
shows you how many pixels fall at a par-
ticular brightness value. A spike indicates 
a heavy concentration of pixels. For exam-
ple, in Figure 4-18, the histogram shows 
a large supply of pixels clustered in the 
range just below medium brightness, but 
very few at the higher end of the range.
 
Keep in mind that there is no one “perfect” histogram that you should try to 
achieve. Instead, interpret the histogram with respect to the distribution of 
shadows, highlights, and midtones that comprise your subject. You wouldn’t 
expect to see lots of shadows, for example, in a photo of a polar bear walking 
on a snowy landscape. Pay attention, however, if you see a very high concen-
tration of pixels at the far right or left end of the histogram, which can indi-
cate a seriously overexposed or underexposed image, respectively. To find 
out how to resolve exposure problems, visit Chapter 5.

indicates tonal range, from shadows on 
the left to highlights on the right.

 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
Understanding RGB histograms
When you view your images in RGB 
Histogram display mode, you see two his-
tograms: the Brightness histogram, cov-
ered in the preceding section, and an RGB 
histogram. Figure 4-19 offers a sample 
RGB histogram for your consideration.
As explained in the earlier section about 
Highlights mode, digital images are made 
up of red, green, and blue light. With 
the RGB histograms, you can view the 
brightness values for each of those color 
channels. Again, overexposure in one or 
two channels can produce oversaturated 
colors and thus a loss of picture detail. So 
if most of the pixels for one or two chan-
nels are clustered toward the right end of 
the histogram, you may have a problem. 
Take a look at the image thumbnail and 
note where the blinking highlights (indi-
cating overexposure) occur, and then 
assess your subject and lighting to deter-
mine whether you need to make adjust-
ments and retake the photo.
A savvy RGB histogram reader also can spot color-balance issues by look-
ing at the pixel values. But frankly, color-balance problems are fairly easy to 
notice just by looking at the image itself on the camera monitor. And under-
standing how to translate the histogram data for this purpose requires more 
knowledge about RGB color theory than I have room to present in this book.
For information about manipulating color, see Chapter 6.
Shooting Data display mode
 
Before you can access this mode, you must enable it via the Display Mode 
option on the Playback menu. See the earlier section, “Enabling hidden data-
display options,” for details. After turning on the option, press the Multi 
Selector down to shift from Highlights mode to Shooting Data mode.
In this mode, you can view up to four screens of information, which you 
toggle between by pressing the Multi Selector up and down. Figure 4-20 
shows you these screens, referred to in the Nikon manual as Shooting Data 
Page 1, 2, 3, and 4. The fourth screen appears only if you include copyright 
data with your picture, a feature you can explore in Chapter 10.

Figure 4-20: You can view the camera settings used to capture the image in Shooting Data 
display mode.
Most of the data here won’t make any sense to you until you explore Chapters 5 
and 6, which explain the exposure, color, and other advanced settings available 
on your camera. But I want to call your attention to a couple of factoids now:
 
✓ The top-left corner of the monitor shows the Protect Status and Retouch 
Indicator icons, if you used the protect or retouch features. Otherwise, 
the area is empty. (See the earlier section “File Information mode” for 
details about these particular features.)
 
✓ The current folder and frame number appear in the lower-right corner of 
the display.
 
✓ The Comment item, which is the final item on the third screen, contains 
a value if you use the Image Comment feature on the Setup menu. I cover 
this option in Chapter 10.
 
✓ If the ISO value on Shooting Data Page 1 (the first screen in Figure 4-18) 
appears in red, the camera is letting you know that it overrode the ISO 
Sensitivity setting that you selected in order to produce a good expo-
sure. This shift occurs only if you enable automatic ISO adjustment; see 
Chapter 5 for details.

109
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
GPS Data mode
This display mode is available only if the image you’re viewing was shot with 
the optional Nikon GPS (global positioning system) unit attached.
If you use the GPS unit, this display mode shows you the latitude, longitude, 
and other GPS information recorded with the image file. You also see the 
date and time of the shot along with the folder and frame number, the Protect 
Status icon, and the Retouch Indicator icon, all explained in the earlier sec-
tion “File Information mode.” 
Overview Data mode
Overview Data mode is the second 
of the two default photo-information 
modes. (Meaning, you don’t have to 
enable it via the Display Mode option 
on the Playback menu to use it.) In this 
mode, the playback screen contains a 
small image thumbnail along with scads 
of shooting data — although not quite 
as much as Shooting Data mode — plus 
a Brightness histogram. Figure 4-21 
offers a look.
The earlier section “Reading a 
Brightness histogram” tells you what 
to make of that part of the screen. Just 
above the histogram, you see the Protect Status and Retouch Indicator, while 
the Frame Number/Total Pictures data appears at the upper-right corner of 
the image thumbnail. For details on that data, see the earlier section “File 
Information mode.” (As always, the Protect status and Retouch Indicator icons 
appear only if you used those two features; otherwise, the area is empty.)
To sort out the maze of other information, the following list breaks things 
down into the five rows that appear under the image thumbnail and histo-
gram. In the accompanying figures as well as in Figure 4-21, I include all pos-
sible data simply for the purpose of 
illustration; if any of the items don’t 
appear on your screen, it simply 
means that the relevant feature wasn’t 
enabled when you captured the shot.
 
✓ Row 1: This row shows the expo-
sure-related settings labeled in 
Figure 4-22, along with the focal 
length of the lens you used to take the 
shot. As in Shooting Data mode, the 
Figure 4-21: In Overview Data mode, you 
can view your picture along with the major 
camera settings you used to take the picture.

ISO value appears red if you had auto 
ISO override enabled and the camera 
adjusted the ISO for you. Chapter 5 
details the exposure settings; Chapter 6 
introduces you to focal length.
 
✓ Row 2: This row contains a few addi-
tional exposure settings, labeled in 
Figure 4-23. On the right end of the 
row, the Comment and GPS labels 
appear if you took advantage of those 
options when recording the shot. (You 
must switch to the Shooting Data mode 
or GPS mode, respectively, to view the 
actual comment and GPS data.)
 
✓ Row 3: The first three items on this 
row, labeled in Figure 4-24, relate to 
color options explored in Chapter 6. 
Again, the first value shows you the 
White Balance setting; the second, the 
amount of blue-to-amber fine-tuning 
adjustment; and the third, the amount 
of green-to-magenta adjustment. The 
last item indicates the Active D-Lighting setting, another exposure option 
discussed in Chapter 5.
 
✓ Rows 4 and 5: The final two rows of data (refer to Figure 4-21) show the 
same information you get in File Information mode, explained earlier in 
this chapter.
Deleting Photos
You can erase pictures from a memory card when it’s in your camera in three 
ways. The next sections give you the lowdown. (Or is it the down low? I can’t 
seem to keep up.)
Regardless of which delete technique you want to use, remember that you 
can’t delete photos that you protected or hid by using the Protect or Hide 
Image features. Later sections in this chapter explain both features and show 
you how to unprotect and unhide images so that you can delete them.
Deleting images one at a time
 
 The Delete button is key to erasing single images. But the process varies a 
little depending on which playback display mode you’re using, as follows:
Flash compensation
Exposure compensation
Flash mode

additional exposure information.

about advanced color settings.

 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
 
✓ In single-image view, you can erase the current image by pressing the 
Delete button.
 
✓ In thumbnail view (displaying 4, 9, or 72 thumbnails), use the Multi 
Selector to highlight the picture 
you want to erase and then press 
the Delete button.
After you press Delete, you see a mes-
sage asking whether you really want 
to erase the picture. If you do, press 
the Delete button again. Or, to cancel 
out of the process, press the Playback 
button.
If you really want to get down into 
your camera’s customization option 
weeds — and I do believe this is about 
as weedy as it gets — you can control 
which picture the camera displays 
next after you delete the current picture. The option in question lives on the 
Playback menu and is called After Delete, as shown in Figure 4-25. Select the 
option and press OK to access your three choices: Show Next displays the 
picture after the one you just deleted (the default option); Show Previous 
displays the one that fell before the one you deleted, and Continue As Before 
tells the camera to keep going in the same direction you were heading before 
deleting. For example, if you were scrolling forward through your pictures, 
the camera continues playback in that direction. Wow, now that’s control.
 
If you accidentally erase a picture, don’t panic — you may be able to restore it 
by using data-restoration software such as MediaRecover ($30, www.mediar-
ecover.com) or Lexar Image Rescue (also about $30, www.lexar.com). SanDisk 
also currently offers a recovery program with some of its high-performance 
memory cards. But in order to have a chance, you must not take any more 
pictures or perform any other operations on your camera while the current 
memory card is in it. If you do, you may overwrite the erased picture data for 
good and eliminate the possibility of recovering the image.
Deleting all photos
Erasing all pictures on a memory card is a five-step process:
 
1. Open the Playback menu and select Delete, as shown on the left in 
Figure 4-26.
 
2. Press OK.
 
 You see the right screen in Figure 4-26.
 
3. Highlight All and press the Multi Selector right.
Figure 4-25: You can specify which picture 
appears next after you delete the current one.

112
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
Figure 4-26: You can quickly delete all photos from a memory card.
 
4. On the next screen, highlight the memory card that contains the pictures 
you want to dump and press the Multi Selector right again.
 
 You then see a screen that asks you to verify that you want to delete all 
your images.
 
5. Highlight Yes and press OK.
 
This step deletes only pictures in the folder that is currently selected via the 
Playback Folder option on the Playback menu. See the section “Viewing 
Images in Playback Mode,” earlier in this chapter, for information.
Also remember that deleting photos in this way does not erase any pictures 
that you protected using the Protect feature or hid from display by using the 
Hide Image option, both described later in this chapter.
Deleting a batch of selected photos
To erase multiple photos — but not all — display the Playback menu, high-
light Delete, and press OK. You see the Delete screen shown on the left 
in Figure 4-27. Choose Selected and press OK to display the right screen in 
the figure.
Now use these techniques to navigate your thumbnails and mark the ones 
you want to erase:
 
✓ Mark a photo for deletion. Use the Multi Selector to place the yellow 
highlight box over the first photo you want to delete and then press 
the Multi Selector’s center button. A little trash can icon, the universal 

113
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
symbol for delete, appears in the upper-right corner of the thumbnail, 
as shown in the figure. If you change your mind, press the center button 
again to remove the Delete tag from the image.
 
 
✓ Temporarily magnify the selected photo. For a closer look at the 
selected image, press and hold the Zoom In button. When you release 
the button, the display returns to normal thumbnail view.
 
 
✓ Jump to a specific memory card or folder. If you have two memory 
cards installed, The card icon that appears yellow in the upper-right 
corner of the screen is the currently selected card. You can use the 
same technique available during playback to jump between cards and 
folders: Press the Zoom Out button to get the screen where you can 
select a card, highlight the card, and then press OK to display the list of 
folders on the card. Highlight a folder and press OK to return to the 
screen where you tag pictures for deletion. The first photo in your 
chosen folder is automatically selected. Remember that the folders that 
appear when you use this option depend on the setting you choose for 
the Playback Folder option, as covered in the earlier section “Viewing 
Images in Playback Mode.”
 
✓ Erase all marked photos. Press OK to display a confirmation screen 
asking for permission to destroy the images; select Yes and press OK. 
The camera trashes the photos and returns you to the Playback menu.
As with the Delete All option, you can’t delete protected hidden photos using 
this technique. For more about protecting and hiding photos, see the next 
two sections.

Hiding Photos during Playback
Suppose that you took 100 pictures — 50 at a business meeting and 50 at the 
wild after-meeting party. You want to show your boss the photos where you 
and your co-workers look like responsible adults, but you’d rather not share 
the ones showing you and your assistant dancing on the conference table. 
You can always delete the party photos; the preceding section shows you 
how. But if you want to keep them — you never know when a good blackmail 
picture will come in handy — you can simply hide the incriminating images 
during playback.
The key to this trick is the Hide Image option on the Playback menu. After 
highlighting the option, as shown on the left in Figure 4-28, press OK to dis-
play the right screen in the figure. Choose Select/Set and press the Multi 
Selector right to get to the screen shown in Figure 4-29.
Figure 4-28: The Hide Image function lets you prevent photos from appearing during normal 
picture playback. 
From here, things work the same as 
they do for marking a picture for dele-
tion, covered in the preceding section. 
Highlight the picture you want to hide 
and then press the center button of 
the Multi Selector to tag the photo 
with the little hide marker, labeled in 
Figure 4-29. Press again to remove the 
marker.
Hide Image marker
Figure 4-29: Press the center button of the Multi 
Selector to toggle the hide marker on and off.

115
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
You also can use the same techniques as outlined in the preceding section to 
jump between memory cards and folders and get a larger view of the selected 
photo. After you tag all the images you want to hide, press OK to return to 
the Playback menu. Your pictures are now hidden.
To redisplay hidden pictures, just reverse the process, removing the hide 
marker from photos you want to view again. Or, to redisplay all hidden 
pictures quickly, choose Deselect All from the first Hide Image screen (the 
right screen in Figure 4-28). Then press the Multi Selector right to display a 
screen that asks you to confirm your decision. Highlight Yes and press OK 
to make it so.
 
A couple of fine points about this feature: First, your hidden images remain 
viewable from within the Hide Image screens. (So make sure your boss 
doesn’t have time alone with your camera.) Second, if you want to delete 
hidden photos, you first need to remove the Hide Image tags. Or you can 
format your memory card, which wipes out all photos, hidden or not. See 
Chapter 1 for details on card formatting.
Protecting Photos
You can safeguard pictures from accidental erasure by giving them protected 
status. After you take this step, the camera doesn’t allow you to erase a 
picture by using either the Delete button or the Delete option on the 
Playback menu.
 
Formatting your memory card, however, does erase even protected pic-
tures. In addition, when you protect a picture, it shows up as a read-only file 
when you transfer it to your computer. Files that have that read-only status 
can’t be altered until you unlock them in your photo software. In Nikon 
ViewNX, you can do this by clicking the image thumbnail and then choosing 
File➪Protect Files➪Unprotect.
Protecting a picture is easy:
 
1. Display or select the picture you want to protect.
 
• In single-image view, just display the photo.
 
• In 4/9/72 thumbnail mode, use the Multi Selector as needed to 
place the yellow highlight box over the photo.

116
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 
2. Press the Protect button.
 
 See the key symbol on the 
button? That’s your reminder 
that you use the button to lock 
a picture. The same symbol 
appears on protected photos 
during playback, as shown in 
Figure 4-30. (The placement of 
the lock symbol depends on your 
Information display mode, a topic 
you can explore earlier in this 
chapter.) In the figure, the sym-
bol’s in the upper-left corner.
 
3. To remove protection, display or 
select the image and press the 
Protect button again.
Exploring Live View Shooting
If you’ve used a compact, point-and-shoot digital camera, you may be used 
to composing your pictures on the camera monitor rather than by looking 
through the viewfinder. In fact, many compact cameras no longer even offer 
a viewfinder, which is a real shame, in my opinion. When you use the monitor 
to frame the image, you must hold the camera away from your body, a pos-
ture that increases the likelihood of blurry images caused by camera shake. 
When you use the viewfinder, you can brace the camera against your face, 
creating a steadier shooting stance.
Due to some design complexities that I won’t bore you with, many digital SLR 
cameras do not enable you to preview shots on the monitor. Your D300s, 
however, does offer that feature, known as Live View in dSLR nomenclature. 
The D300s also uses Live View when you record movies.
You need to know a few points about Live View as it’s provided on your 
camera:
 
✓ Manual focusing is recommended. You can autofocus, assuming that 
you’re using a lens that supports that feature when paired with the 
D300s. (See Chapter 1 for more about that issue.) But even if your lens 
does offer autofocusing, manual focusing usually offers faster, more pre-
cise results. 
?
Figure 4-30: Press the Protect button to prevent 
accidental deletion of the selected image.

117
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
 
✓ Continuous autofocusing isn’t possible. In normal shooting, you can set 
the camera to the continuous-servo autofocus mode to continually adjust 
focus automatically up to the moment you take the shot. (See Chapter 6 
for details.) Continuous autofocusing is not available in Live View mode, 
unfortunately. If you need to adjust focus before taking a shot or during 
movie recording, you just have to set focus a second time. 
 
✓ Using Live View for an extended period can harm your pictures and 
the camera. When you work in Live View mode, the camera’s innards 
heat up more than usual, and that extra heat can create the right elec-
tronic conditions for noise, a defect that gives your pictures a speckled 
look. (Chapter 5 offers more information.)
 
 Perhaps more critically, the increased temperatures can damage the 
camera itself. For that reason, Live View is automatically disabled after 
one hour of shooting — or earlier, if a critical heat level is detected. 
When the camera is 30 seconds or less from shutting down your Live 
View session, you see a little LV symbol, with a numerical value (such 
as 18s) to let you know how many seconds you have to wrap things up. 
This warning appears in the upper-left corner of the screen. In extremely 
warm environments, you may not be able to use Live View mode for 
very long before the system shuts down. 
 
✓ Aiming the lens at the sun or other bright lights also can damage the 
camera. Of course, you can cause problems doing this even during 
normal shooting, but the possibilities increase when you use Live View. 
You not only can harm the camera’s internal components but also the 
monitor.
 
Live View also presents two additional disadvantages which, in this case, are 
the same as for a point-and-shoot camera. First, any time you use the moni-
tor, you put extra strain on the battery. Second, the monitor can wash out in 
bright sunlight, making it difficult to compose outdoor shots.
This list of caveats doesn’t mean that I’m telling you not to use Live View. But 
for normal photography — that is, still shooting rather than movie record-
ing — you shouldn’t envision Live View as a full-time alternative to using the 
viewfinder. Rather, think of it as a special-purpose tool that can help in situa-
tions where framing with the viewfinder is cumbersome.
 
I find Live View most helpful for still-life, tabletop photography, especially in 
cases that require a lot of careful arrangement of the scene. For example, I 
have a shooting table that’s about waist high. Normally, I put my camera on a 
tripod, come up with an initial layout of the objects I want to photograph, set 

118
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
up my lights, and then check the scene through the viewfinder. Then there’s 
a period of refining the object placement, the lighting, and so on. If I’m 
shooting from a high angle, requiring the camera to be positioned above 
the table and pointing downward, I have to stand on my tiptoes or get a 
stepladder to check things out through the viewfinder between each com-
positional or lighting change. At lower angles, where the camera is tabletop 
height or below, I have to either bend over or kneel to look through the 
viewfinder, causing no end of later aches and pains to back and knees. 
With Live View, I can alleviate much of that bothersome routine (and pain) 
because I can usually see how things look in the monitor no matter what 
the camera position.
With that lengthy preamble out of the way, the next several sections 
explain some Live View setup options. Following that, you can find step-
by-step instructions for taking pictures in Live View mode and recording 
movies.
Choosing your Live View shooting mode
Before turning on the Live View display, pay a visit to the Shooting menu 
and call up the Live View Mode option, as shown in Figure 4-31. You can 
choose from Tripod Mode and Handheld Mode. As their names suggest, one 
is designed for times when you have the camera mounted on a tripod and the 
other is for handheld work.
Figure 4-31: The main difference between the two Live View modes has to do with 
autofocusing.
The major difference between the two modes, though, has to do with auto-
focusing, although your choice does have some implications with regard to 
exposure for movie making as well. Here’s the deal:

119
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
 
✓ Autofocusing: In Handheld mode, the camera uses an autofocusing tech-
nology called phase-detection autofocus, which is the same autofocusing 
technology as it does for normal, non–Live View photography. In Tripod 
mode, a different technology, called contrast-detection, is used.
 
 It’s not important to understand the two technologies — although, if 
you’re interested, you can find lots of online discussions about the two. 
What is important to note is how the two technologies impact Live View 
autofocusing operation, as follows: 
 
• Focusing area: In Tripod mode, you can set focus on any point  in 
the entire frame, even on points outside the normal autofocus-area 
brackets (those brackets that indicate the spread of the  camera’s 51 
possible autofocus points when you look through  the viewfinder). 
In Handheld mode, you’re limited to the normal autofocus area.
 
• Focus adjustments during movie recording: If you opt for autofo-
cusing, you can reset focus as needed during movie recording 
in Tripod mode. In Handheld mode, you can’t adjust focus once 
recording begins.
 
• Monitor shut-off during focusing: In Handheld mode, the monitor 
turns off briefly in order to allow the camera to use the aforemen-
tioned normal autofocusing system. In Tripod mode, the monitor 
remains on during focusing.
 
• Focusing speed and accuracy: Tripod mode autofocusing can take a 
little longer, and low-contrast subjects can challenge the camera. 
And keep the mode name in mind: The focusing system used in 
Tripod mode really does not work well for handheld shots or for 
moving subjects.
 
 On the other hand, autofocus can be a little more precise in Tripod 
mode because you can set the focus point anywhere in the frame. 
In addition, you can zoom the onscreen view up to a 13 times mag-
nification to check focus in Tripod Mode, whereas Handheld mode 
limits you to a three-times magnification.
 
✓ Exposure adjustment during movie recording: In Handheld mode, the 
camera handles exposure automatically as you’re recording a movie. In 
Tripod mode, you can set the camera to the M or A exposure mode and 
then select a specific aperture, using any setting up to f/16. The camera 
then uses that aperture during recording. This option comes in handy if 
you want to maintain a specific depth of field throughout the recording.
Confusing enough for you? Well, let me simplify things by repeating my ear-
lier advice that if at all possible, use manual focus. Not only are you likely to 
get faster, more accurate focusing, but you also don’t have to worry about all 

120
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
the autofocusing intricacies just described. The mode decision then favors 
Tripod mode because of the stronger magnification that’s available to check 
focus. As for movie recording, choose the mode that best matches your 
desire to control aperture and exposure.
 
The way you take the picture, record your movie, and check focusing depends 
on your selected Live View mode, so upcoming sections walk you through the 
details.
Whichever mode you want to use, you can customize the Live View display 
as outlined next.
Customizing the Live View display
 
 When you press the Live View button, the scene in front of the lens appears 
on the monitor, as shown in Figure 4-32, and you no longer can see anything 
through the viewfinder.

 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
 
 Just as you can change what information appears onscreen during picture 
playback, you can change the data that shows up during Live View shooting. 
Press the Info button to cycle through the four styles, which are:
 
✓ Information On: In this mode, your screen displays the boatload of data 
shown in Figure 4-32. A few notes about this display:
 
• Some symbols, such as those representing Exposure 
Compensation and Flash Compensation values, appear only if you 
enable those features. (Chapter 5 details these settings.)
 
• In Handheld mode, you see the autofocus-area brackets as well as 
the focus point. (Not shown in Figure 4-32.)
 
• The strip of cryptic symbols labeled Control Reminders in the 
figure is there to remind you what buttons to push to perform 
certain functions. For example, the far-right symbol represents 
the Multi Selector. The center button in the symbol is highlighted 
to show that you press it to begin recording a movie. More about 
what the rest of the icons mean momentarily.
 
✓ Information Off: Press the Info button to cycle to this display option, 
which hides all the indicators that are displayed over your image. You 
still see the settings along the bottom of the frame and the focusing frame 
(and autofocus area brackets, if you’re shooting in Handheld mode).
 
✓ Framing Grid: This mode displays a grid over the image. In Tripod 
mode, the grid appears as shown on the left in Figure 4-33; in Handheld 
mode, the grid lines appear only around the perimeter of the autofo-
cus area brackets (as they do when you enable the viewfinder grid, an 
option covered in Chapter 1). The grid is helpful when you need to pre-
cisely align objects in your photo. But note that if you zoom the display 
to check focusing, as outlined in the next section, the grid disappears 
until you return to normal magnification. 
Figure 4-33: Press the Info button to change the display mode.

122
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ Virtual Horizon: You also can display the Virtual Horizon indicator, as 
shown on the right in Figure 4-33. This tool works the same way as the 
one you can enable through the Custom Setting menu, introduced in 
Chapter 1. When the camera is level to the horizon, the little green tri-
angle appears, as shown in the figure.
 
 In addition to these options, you can 
adjust the monitor brightness without 
exiting Live View mode. Just press and 
hold the Playback button to display 
the little brightness scale on the right 
side of the screen, as highlighted in 
Figure 4-34. While holding the button, 
you can press the Multi Selector 
right and left to toggle between that 
brightness strip and the microphone 
icon in the upper-left corner of the 
screen. When the brightness strip is 
highlighted, press the Multi Selector 
up and down to adjust the brightness. 
(When the microphone is highlighted, 
you can adjust the sound-recording 
options, covered later in this chapter.) 
The strip of reminder icons along the bottom of the screen (highlighted in the 
figure) is there to jog your memory of what buttons accomplish this function.
 
If you connect your camera to an HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) 
device, you no longer see the live scene on your camera monitor. Instead, the 
view is displayed on your video device. In that scenario, the arrangement of 
the information on the screen may appear slightly different than in the exam-
ples in this chapter.
Taking still pictures in Tripod mode
After setting your camera to Tripod mode (through the Live View Mode 
option on the Shooting menu), follow these steps to take a picture: 
 
 
1. To switch to the Live View display, press the Live View button.
 
 You hear a clicking sound as the camera’s internal mirror — the part 
that makes it possible to see your subject in the viewfinder — flips up. 
The viewfinder goes dark, and your subject appears on the monitor.
 
2. Frame the shot.
 
3. Set the focus mode to auto or manual focusing.
 
 This part of the process works just as it does for normal photography: 
Set the Focus mode selector on the front of the camera to M for manual 
Figure 4-34: Press the Playback button, press 
right to activate the brightness strip, and then 
press up or down to adjust monitor brightness.

123
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
focusing; choose S for autofocusing. (Again, you can set the Focus mode 
selector to C, but doing so does no good because in Live View mode, the 
camera can’t provide continuous autofocus.)
 
 Also be sure to set the focus mode on your lens to auto or manual, if it 
offers that control.
 
 Nikon recommends that you use an AF-S lens for best autofocusing 
results in Tripod mode. See Chapter 1 for more about lens types.
 
4. Use the Multi Selector to move the focus point (labeled in Figure 4-35) 
over your subject.
 
 This step is optional for manual 
focusing, but it does make check-
ing your focus through the pro-
cess used in Step 6 a little easier.
 
5. Focus.
 
 
• To autofocus, press the 
AF-ON button. When the 
camera has established 
focus, you hear a beep, 
and the focus frame turns 
green. You can then release 
the button. You can’t set 
focus by pressing the shut-
ter button halfway as you 
do for normal, through-the-
viewfinder shooting.
 
• To focus manually, twist the focusing ring on the lens. Note that the 
focusing frame does not turn green even if your focus is correct.
 
 
6. Press the Zoom In button to magnify the view and check focus.
 
 The zoomed display is centered on 
the focusing frame (which is why 
positioning the frame in Step 4 is 
helpful even for manual focusing). 
Each press of the button zooms 
the display further, up to 13 times 
magnification.
 
 In the lower-right corner of the 
screen, the smaller box inside 
the larger rectangle indicates the 
area of the frame that’s currently 
being magnified, as shown in 
Figure 4-36. To scroll the display 
and check another part of the 
image, press the Multi Selector.

frame over your subject and then press the 
AF-ON button.
Magnified area
Figure 4-36: Press the Zoom In button to 
magnify the area under the focusing frame.

124
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
 
 To reduce the magnification, press the Zoom Out button. Press OK to 
return to full-frame view.
 
 If you’re focusing manually, you can tweak focus in the magnified view — 
just keep turning the focusing ring until things look good. Likewise, you 
can press the AF-ON button to reset focus if you’re autofocusing. But if 
you want to reposition the focus frame before autofocusing a second time, 
you need to press OK to return to the normal magnification first.
 
7. Adjust other picture-taking settings as needed.
 
 You adjust exposure, color, and other picture-taking settings for Live View 
shooting the same way as you do for through-the-viewfinder photography. 
For example, to adjust white balance, press the WB button and rotate 
the main command dial; to change the exposure mode, press the Mode 
button and rotate the main command dial. (Refer to Figure 4-32 to see 
what settings you can monitor on the screen.) However, if you want to 
adjust the metering mode or any settings that are available only through 
menus, you have to exit Live View mode. Just press the Menu button, 
adjust the setting, and then press the Live View button again. Your focus 
should be maintained, assuming that you don’t move the camera while 
changing settings.
 
 The aperture, shutter speed, and ISO settings displayed at the bottom 
of the screen represent the ones that were in force when you shifted to 
Live View mode. If you’re using the P, A, or S exposure modes, in which 
the camera selects aperture, shutter speed, or both, the camera will 
meter the exposure again when you take the shot and adjust those set-
tings if needed. Likewise, ISO may be adjusted if you enable auto ISO 
override. For help with all these exposure issues, see Chapter 5.
 
8. Depress the shutter button fully to take the shot.
 
 The monitor turns off briefly and then the Live View preview returns, 
and you’re ready to take the next shot.
 
 
9. To exit the Live View preview, press the Lv button.
 
 You can then return to framing your images through the viewfinder.
 
If your Tripod mode shots appear blurry and you’re sure that focus is cor-
rect, try enabling the Exposure Delay Mode option on the Custom Setting 
menu. At this setting, the camera waits about one second after you press 
and release the shutter button to record the image, which can help ensure 
that the slight movement of the camera’s internal mirror doesn’t blur the 
image. 
One other fine-print notation regarding Tripod mode: On occasion, the auto-
focus frame may turn green even if focus isn’t actually accurate. So always 
take the step of magnifying the display to double-check focusing results.

125
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
Taking pictures in Handheld mode
Shooting pictures in Handheld mode works a little differently than Tripod 
mode. As with Handheld mode, start by setting the camera’s Focus mode 
selector to M for manual focusing and S for autofocusing. Also set the lens 
focus mode switch, if your lens offers one. Be sure to select your exposure 
metering mode as well, because you 
can’t adjust that setting after you 
switch to Live View mode. (Chapter 5 
covers the metering mode options.) 
Then proceed like so:
 
 
1. Press the Live View button.
 
 Again, the mirror flips up, the 
viewfinder goes dark, and your 
subject appears on the monitor. 
This time, you see the same auto-
focus area brackets that normally 
appear in the viewfinder, along 
with a red focus point, as shown 
in Figure 4-37.
 
2. Frame the shot so that your 
subject appears within the 
autofocus area brackets.
 
3. Use the Multi Selector to move 
the focus point over your subject.
 
4. Focus.
 
 
• To autofocus, press the AF-ON button or use the normal autofo-
cusing technique of pressing the shutter button halfway. Note 
that if you use the AF-ON button, though, vibration reduction isn’t 
engaged. So if your lens offers vibration reduction and that feature 
is important, use the shutter button to set focus.
 
 As soon as you press either button, the monitor shuts off and the 
camera begins focusing. When you hear a beep, focus has been 
achieved, and you can release the button. The monitor then turns 
back on. Note that the focus point remains red instead of turning 
green as in Tripod mode.
 
 Focus is locked at this point, even if you set the Focus mode to C 
(continuous-servo autofocus). You don’t need to keep the shutter 
button pressed halfway as you do to lock focus during normal 
photography.
 
• To focus manually, twist the focusing ring on the lens.

5. Press the Zoom In button to magnify the view and refine focus, if 
needed.
 
 In this Live View mode, you can zoom to a three-times magnification 
only. Press the Multi Selector to scroll the display and check another 
part of the image.
 
 
 To reduce the magnification, press the Zoom Out button. Press OK to 
return to full-frame view.
 
 If needed, repeat Step 4 to refine focus. For autofocusing, you must return 
to full-frame view first if you want to select a different autofocus point.
 
6. Adjust exposure, color, and other picture settings in the usual way.
 
 Remember that you must exit Live View mode if you want to change the 
metering mode. Press the Live View button, move the metering mode 
switch, and press again to return to Live View shooting. If you need to 
adjust a menu setting, press Menu to temporarily exit Live View mode. 
Adjust the setting and then return to Live View mode.
 
7. Depress the shutter button fully to take the shot.
 
 At the point you take the shot, the camera meters the final exposure 
and may adjust exposure settings automatically, depending on 
what exposure mode and ISO options you’re using. Chapter 5 discusses 
exposure. The monitor turns off briefly after you press the shutter 
button, and then the Live View preview reappears.
 
 
8. If you’re done with Live View shooting, press the Live View button.
 
 The monitor shuts off, and the viewfinder comes back to life.
Recording movies
Your D300s offers the ability to record digital movies. Although recording 
live action with a D300s involves a few limitations and difficulties that you 
don’t experience with a real video camera, it’s a fun option to have onboard 
nonetheless. 
Before I give you the specifics, here’s the broad overview of D300s movie 
making:
 
✓ Live View mode: You have the same two shooting mode options as for 
still Live View photography: Tripod mode and Handheld mode. See the 
earlier section “Choosing your Live View shooting mode” for details. 
 
✓ Movie quality: The Movie Quality setting, which you set via the Movie 
Settings option on the Shooting menu, as shown in Figure 4-38, deter-
mines the frame size and aspect ratio of the movie. You can set the 

127
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
quality to 320 x 216 pixels, for a 3:2 aspect ratio (the same aspect ratio 
as your D300s still images); 640 x 424, also a 3:2 aspect ratio; and 1280 x 
720, which gives you a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is found on many new TV 
sets and computer monitors. 
 
 The higher the pixel count, the larger you can display the movie on a TV 
or monitor before you see the quality of the playback deteriorate. But a 
higher Quality setting also produces a larger file, eating up more of your 
memory card, and it reduces the maximum length of the movie you can 
record, as outlined next.
 
✓ Maximum movie length/file size: If you select the highest movie resolu-
tion (1280 x 720 pixels), your movie can have a maximum length of five 
minutes and a maximum file size of 2GB. At the two lower-resolution 
settings, you’re still restricted to 2GB file sizes, but the movies can run 
as long as 20 minutes. Of course, you must have 2GB of empty memory 
card space to store the movie.
 
✓ Frame rate: The frame rate determines the smoothness of the playback. 
At all three Quality settings, the frame rate is 24 frames per second, or 
fps. By contrast, the standard frame rate for television-quality video 
is 30 frames per second, so expect your movies to play a little less 
smoothly than your favorite sitcoms.
 
✓ Sound recording: You can record sound or shoot a silent movie; make 
the call via the Movie Settings option on the Shooting menu (shown 
in Figure 4-38). See the next section for details on your choices and an 
explanation of how to connect an external microphone.
 
✓ Color: You can set the White Balance option as usual. Movies also use 
the currently selected Picture Control and Color Space (sRGB or Adobe 
RGB). For details about all these color options, see Chapter 6.
Figure 4-38: Specify movie quality and sound recording options via the Shooting menu.

128
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
✓ File storage: If you have two 
memory cards installed in the 
camera, use the Destination 
option on the Movie Settings 
menu (refer to Figure 4-38) to 
select which card you want to 
use to store the file. After you 
select the option, press the Multi 
Selector right to see the screen 
shown in Figure 4-39. For each 
card, you see the length of the 
movie that will fit on each card at 
the current movie-quality settings. 
(You also can view the capacity of 
the current card after you switch 
to Live View mode.) To select the 
card, highlight it and press OK.
 
✓ Video format: Movies are created in the AVI format, which means you can 
play them on your computer using most movie-playback programs. If you 
want to view your movies on a TV, you can connect the camera to the TV, 
as explained in Chapter 9. Or if you have the necessary computer soft-
ware, you can convert the AVI file to a format that a standard DVD player 
can recognize and then burn the converted file to a DVD disk. You also 
can edit your movie in a program that can work with AVI files.
So far, so good. None of the aforementioned details is terribly unusual or 
complicated. Where things get a little tricky for the would-be filmmaker are in 
the areas of focus and exposure:
 
✓ Focusing: As with regular Live View photography, you can use autofocus-
ing to establish initial focus on your subject before you begin recording. 
But after recording begins, the autofocus system lays down and plays 
dead if you use the Handheld Live View mode. In Tripod mode, you can 
reset focus, but you’re likely to record at least a few frames during which 
focus goes in and out as the system looks for its new focusing target.
 
 Either way, autofocusing during movie recording is problematic. So 
unless you’re recording a static subject — say, a guitar player sitting 
on a stool or a speaker at a lectern — opt for manual focusing. You can 
then adjust focus manually any time during the recording. 
 
 If you plan to also zoom in and out, give yourself some time to practice 
before the big event. It’s a bit of a challenge to zoom and focus at the 
same time, especially while holding the camera in front of you so that 
you can see the monitor. (A tripod makes the maneuver slightly easier.)
 
✓ Exposure: The camera automatically selects Matrix metering mode, 
which sets exposure based on the light throughout the entire scene. You 
Figure 4-39: If you have two memory cards 
installed, use this option to select the card 
where the movie will be stored.

129
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
can’t use the other two metering modes. In addition, the camera adjusts 
ISO (light sensitivity) automatically for you.
 
 In Handheld mode, the camera also handles the aperture and shutter 
speed settings automatically, In Tripod mode, however, you can set the 
camera to the M or A exposure modes and then dial in an aperture set-
ting (to affect depth of field) before you begin recording. In either Tripod 
or Handheld mode, you can adjust exposure in the P, S, and A exposure 
modes by using Exposure Compensation, but only to EV +3.0 or –3.0 
(rather than the usual range of –5.0 to +5.0 available for still photography). 
During recording, you can press the AE-L/AF-L button to lock exposure.
Customizing sound recording
The D300s improves on the movie-recording capabilities of most other still 
cameras that offer movie mode by enabling you to record sound either 
through the internal microphone or by attaching an external mike.
The advantages of an external microphone are twofold. First, you can buy a 
mike that offers stereo recording and better overall sound quality than the 
internal one. Additionally, by positioning the mike away from the camera, you 
avoid including sounds made by the camera in the recording.
You can attach any microphone that has a standard, 3.5mm mini-pin plug. 
The mike jack is located under the cover on the left side of the camera, as 
shown on the left in Figure 4-40.
Figure 4-40: You can connect an external mike or use the built-in one. 

130
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
 
If you instead choose to use the internal microphone, note its position: It’s 
the little three-holed area above the D300s logo, on the front of the camera, 
as shown on the right in the figure. Make sure that you don’t inadvertently 
cover up the microphone with your finger. And keep in mind that anything 
you say will be picked up by the mike along with any other audio present in 
the scene.
Whether you use the internal mike or attach another one, set the recording 
options through the Movie Settings option on the Shooting menu, as shown 
in Figure 4-41. Highlight Microphone and press OK to display the options 
shown on the second screen in the figure.
Figure 4-41: Set the microphone sensitivity or disable sound here.
You have the following options:
 
✓ To disable sound: Choose Microphone Off to record a movie without 
any sound at all.
 
✓ To enable sound: All the other settings enable sound. You can select 
a specific sensitivity setting to control how loud a sound has to be 
in order to be picked up by the mike. For a very quiet speaker sitting 
across the room, for example, you may want to increase the sensitivity. 
Or, if you don’t want to pick up faraway noises, decrease the sensitiv-
ity so only sounds close to the mike get recorded. At the Auto level, the 
camera adjusts the sound level automatically.
 
You also can adjust the microphone sensitivity after switching to Live View 
mode by using the trick mentioned earlier, in the section about adjusting 
monitor brightness: Press and hold the Playback button and then press the 
Multi Selector left to highlight the little microphone symbol in the upper-right 

131
 Chapter 4: Monitor Matters: Picture Playback, Live View, and Movie Recording
corner of the screen. (Peek ahead at Figure 4-42, in the next section, for a 
look.) Then press up or down to cycle through the various sensitivity set-
tings. Release the Playback button when you’re done.
Shooting your movie
To try out movie recording, first set your camera as outlined in all the pre-
ceding sections. Then take these steps:
 
1. Press the Lv button to switch to Live View mode.
 
2. Compose your shot.
 
3. Set focus.
 
 Which method you can use depends on whether you use Tripod mode 
or Handheld mode. You can find details in the preceding sections on still 
photography in Live View mode, but here’s the quick recap:
 
• In either mode, manual focusing typically works best. Be sure to 
set your lens and the camera to manual focusing and then just 
twist the lens focusing ring to adjust focus.
 
 
• In Handheld mode, frame your subject so that it’s under the autofocus 
point — you can use the Multi Selector to position the point — and 
then press the AF-ON button or press the shutter button halfway to 
focus. The monitor will shut off briefly; when you hear the beep sig-
naling that focus has been set, release the button. You can’t adjust 
autofocus after you begin recording; if you try, recording stops auto-
matically. Also remember that Vibration Reduction, if your lens offers 
it, engages only if you press the shutter button to set focus.
 
• In Tripod mode, use the Multi Selector to position the focus point 
over your subject and then press the AF-ON button to set focus. 
The monitor remains on while focus is being set. You can press 
the button again during recording to adjust focusing if needed, 
but be aware that you may be able to hear the sound of the focus-
ing motor in the recording and see the camera “hunt” for the new 
focusing target.
 
 
 After focusing, you can press the Zoom In button to magnify the display 
and check focus, just as when you take still pictures in Live View mode. 
Press OK to return to the non-magnified view.
 
4. Adjust exposure if desired.
 
 Depending on the Live View mode you use, you can adjust exposure 
through the aperture setting (f-stop), by applying exposure compensation, 

132
Part I: Fast Track to Super Snaps 
or applying autoexposure lock. Chapter 5 details all these settings; here’s 
how they work during movie recording:
 
• Select an aperture (f-stop). In Tripod mode, you can set the expo-
sure mode to M or A and then select an aperture setting as high as 
f/16. (Rotate the sub-command dial to set the f-stop.) However, if 
the scene on the monitor appears too dark, open up the aperture 
by choosing a lower f-stop value. In Handheld mode, you can’t

his part of the book details the myriad ways 
you can manipulate exposure, focus, and

astering the art of exposure is one of the most challenging 
aspects of photography. First, you have to grapple 
with a seemingly endless list of technical terms — aperture, 
metering, shutter speed, ISO, stop, and so on. Add to that 
the equally large number of exposure-related options 
on your D300s, and, well . . . suffice it to say that if 
you’re feeling a little intimidated, you’re in good 
company. I know, I’ve been there.
From years of working with beginning photogra-
phers, though, I can promise that when you take 
things nice and slow, digesting just a piece of the 
exposure pie at a time, the topic is not nearly as 
complicated as it seems on the surface. And I guar-
antee that the payoff will be well worth your time and 
brain energy. You’ll not only learn how to solve just about 
any exposure problem, but you’ll also discover ways to use 
exposure to put your creative stamp on a scene.
To that end, this chapter provides everything you need to know to really 
exploit all your camera’s exposure options, including a primer in exposure 
science. (It’s not as bad as it sounds.) Explore a paragraph or two one day, a 
few more the next, and before long, you’ll have it all down pat.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Introducing the Exposure Trio: Aperture, 
Shutter Speed, and ISO
Any photograph, whether taken 
with a film or digital camera, is cre-
ated by focusing light through a 
lens onto a light-sensitive recording 
medium. In a film camera, the film 
negative serves as that medium; in a 
digital camera, it’s the image sensor, 
which is an array of light-responsive 
computer chips.
Between the lens and the sensor are 
two barriers, known as the aperture 
and shutter, which together control 
how much light makes its way to 
the sensor. The actual design and 
arrangement of the aperture, shut-
ter, and sensor vary depending on 
the camera, but Figure 5-1 offers an 
illustration of the basic concept.
The aperture and shutter, along with a third feature known as ISO, determine 
exposure — what most of us would describe as the picture’s overall bright-
ness and contrast. This three-part exposure formula works as follows:
 
✓ Aperture (controls amount of light): The aperture is an adjustable hole 
in a diaphragm set just behind the lens. By changing the size of the aper-
ture, you control the size of the light beam that can enter the camera. 
Aperture settings are stated as f-stop numbers, or simply f-stops, and are 
expressed with the letter f followed by a number: f/2, f/5.6, f/16, and so 
on. The lower the f-stop number, the larger the aperture, and the more 
light is permitted into the camera, as illustrated by Figure 5-2. Each 
increase in f-stop value cuts the light that can enter the camera in half: 
For example, at f/2.8, half as much light is permitted in as at f/2.0. 
 
 The range of possible f-stops depends on your lens and, if you use a 
zoom lens, on the zoom position (focal length) of the lens. For example, 
on the 18–55mm Nikon AF-S VR lens shown with the D300s in this book, 
you can select apertures from f/3.5–f/22 when zoomed all the way out 
to the shortest focal length, 18mm. When you zoom in to the maximum 
focal length, 55mm, the aperture range is f/5.6–f/36. (See Chapter 6 for a 
discussion of focal lengths.)

Figure 5-2: A lower f-stop number means a larger aperture, 
allowing more light into the camera.
 
✓ Shutter speed (controls duration of light): Set behind the aperture, the 
shutter works something like, er, the shutters on a window. When you 
aren’t taking pictures, the camera’s shutter stays closed, preventing 
light from striking the image sensor, just as closed window shutters pre-
vent sunlight from entering a room. When you press the shutter button, 
the shutter opens briefly to allow light that passes through the aperture 
to hit the image sensor.
 
 The length of time that the shutter is open is called the shutter speed and 
is measured in seconds: 1/60 second, 1/250 second, 2 seconds, and so 
on. Shutter speeds on the D300s range from 30 seconds to 1/8000 second 
when you shoot without flash. For flash photography with the built-in 
flash, the range is more limited; for some external flash units, you can 
still access the entire range of shutter speeds, although there are trad-
eoffs to be made for the privilege. See the section “Enabling high-speed 
flash (auto FP),” later in this chapter, for information. 
 
 Should you want a shutter speed longer than 30 seconds, manual (M) expo-
sure mode also provides a feature called bulb exposure. At this setting, the 
shutter stays open indefinitely as long as you press the shutter button.
 
✓ ISO (controls light sensitivity): ISO, which is a digital function rather 
than a mechanical structure on the camera, enables you to adjust how 
responsive the image sensor is to light. The term ISO is a holdover from 
film days, when an international standards organization rated each film 
stock according to light sensitivity: ISO 200, ISO 400, ISO 800, and so on.
 
 On a digital camera, the sensor itself doesn’t actually get more or less sen-
sitive when you change the ISO — rather, the light “signal” that hits the 
sensor is either amplified or dampened through electronics wizardry, sort 
of like how raising the volume on a radio boosts the audio signal.

142
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 But the upshot is the same as changing to a more light-reactive film 
stock: A higher ISO means that less light is needed to produce the image, 
enabling you to use a smaller aperture, faster shutter speed, or both. (In 
other words, from now on, don’t worry about the technicalities and just 
remember that ISO equals light sensitivity.)
 
 The normal ISO settings on the D300s range from ISO 200 to 3200. But if 
you really need to push things, you can extend that range all the way to 
ISO 100 at the low end and 6400 at the high end. (These “extra” settings, 
called Lo 1 and Hi 1, respectively, have some downsides that you can 
explore in the upcoming section “ISO affects image noise.”)
 
Distilled down to its essence, the image-exposure formula is just this simple: 
 
✓ Aperture and shutter speed together determine how much light strikes 
the image sensor.
 
✓ ISO determines how much the sensor reacts to that light and thus how 
much light is needed to expose the picture.
The tricky part of the equation is that aperture, shutter speed, and ISO set-
tings affect your pictures in ways that go beyond exposure. You need to be 
aware of these side effects, explained in the next section, to determine which 
combination of the three exposure settings will work best for your picture.
Understanding exposure-setting side effects
You can create the same exposure with multiple combinations of aperture, 
shutter speed, and ISO. You’re limited only by the aperture range allowed by 
the lens and the shutter speeds and ISO range offered by the camera.
But as I hinted in the preceding section, the settings you select impact your 
image beyond mere exposure, as explained in the following three sections.
Aperture affects depth of field
The aperture setting, or f-stop, affects depth of field, which is the range of 
sharp focus in your image. I introduce this concept in Chapter 2, but here’s a 
quick recap: With a shallow depth of field, your subject appears more sharply 
focused than faraway objects; with a large depth of field, the sharp-focus 
zone spreads over a greater distance.
 
As you reduce the aperture size — or stop down the aperture, in photo lingo — 
by choosing a higher f-stop number, you increase depth of field. As an example, 
take a look at the two images in Figure 5-3. For both shots, I established focus 
on the female statue atop the fountain. Notice that the background in the first 

143
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
image, taken at an aperture setting of f/14, is softer than in the right example, 
taken at f/29. Aperture is just one contributor to depth of field, however; focal 
length and your camera-to-subject distance are also involved. See Chapter 6 for 
the complete story. 
Shutter speed affects motion blur
At a slow shutter speed, moving objects appear blurry, whereas a fast shutter 
speed captures motion cleanly. Compare the fountain spray in the photos in 
Figure 5-3, for example. At a shutter speed of 1/20 second (right photo), the 
water blurs, giving it a misty look. At 1/80 second (left photo), the droplets 
appear more sharply focused. How high a shutter speed you need to freeze 
action depends on the speed of your subject.

Figure 5-3: Stopping down the aperture (by choosing a higher f-stop number) increases 
depth of field, or the zone of sharp focus.

144
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Assuming that your lens is focusing 
correctly, a picture that suffers from 
overall blur, where even stationary 
objects appear out of focus, indicates 
that the camera itself moved during 
the exposure, which is always a 
danger when you handhold the 
camera. The slower the shutter speed, 
the longer the exposure time and the 
longer you have to hold the camera 
still to avoid the blur that is caused by 
camera shake. For example, I was able 
to successfully handhold the 1/80 
second exposure you see on the left in 
Figure 5-3, but at 1/20 second, there 
was enough camera movement to 
result in the blurry shot shown in 
Figure 5-4. So I mounted the camera 
on the tripod to get the shake-free ver-
sion shown on the right in Figure 5-3.
How slow is too slow? It depends on 
your physical capabilities and your 
lens — a longer, heavier lens adds to 
the challenge. For reasons that are too 
technical to get into, camera shake 
also affects your picture more when 
you shoot with a lens that has a long 
focal length. So you may be able to use a much slower shutter speed when 
you shoot with a 28mm wide-angle lens, for example, than a 200mm telephoto 
lens. (Chapter 6 explains focal length, if the term is new to you.)
The best idea is to do your own tests to see where your handholding limit 
lies. Start with a slow shutter speed — say, in the 1/40 second neighborhood, 
and then click off multiple shots, increasing the shutter speed for each pic-
ture. If you have a zoom lens, run the test first at the minimum focal length 
(widest angle) and then zoom to the maximum focal length for another series 
of shots. Then it’s simply a matter of comparing the images in your photo 
editing program. (You may not be able to accurately judge the amount of 
blur on the camera monitor.) See Chapter 8 to find out how to see the shutter 
speed you used for each picture when you view your images.
 
Some Nikon lenses, including the one featured in this book, offer vibration 
reduction, which is designed to help compensate for small amounts of camera 
shake. If you’re using a lens from another manufacturer, the feature may go 
by the name image stabilization or something similar. Whatever you call it, 
Figure 5-4: Allover blur usually indicates that 
the camera moved during the exposure.

145
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
this option can enable you to capture sharp images at slightly slower shutter 
speeds than normal when handholding the camera. (Again, your mileage may 
vary, but most people can expect to go at least two or three notches down 
the shutter-speed ramp.)
See Chapter 1 for details about using a vibration reduction lens. Chapter 6 
has tips on solving other focus problems, and Chapter 7 offers more help 
with action photography.
ISO affects image noise
As ISO increases, making the image sensor more reactive to light, you 
increase the risk of producing a defect called noise. This defect looks like 
sprinkles of sand and is similar in appearance to film grain, a defect that 
often mars pictures taken with high ISO film. Noise can also be caused by 
very long exposure times.
Ideally, then, you should always use the lowest ISO setting on your camera 
to ensure top image quality. But in dim lighting, you simply may not be 
able to use the aperture and shutter speed you need without raising ISO. 
Fortunately, the D300s produces remarkably little noise even at fairly high 
ISO settings, as evidenced by the examples in Figure 5-5, which shows you 
close-up views of the candle scene shot at six different settings along the 
ISO range.
Putting the f (stop) in focus
One way to remember the relationship between 
f-stop and depth of field, or the range of dis-
tance over which objects remain in sharp focus, 
is simply to think of the f as standing for focus. 
A higher f-stop number produces a larger depth 
of field, so if you want to extend the zone of 
sharp focus to cover a greater distance from 
your subject, you set the aperture to a higher 
f-stop. Higher f-stop number, greater zone of 
sharp focus.
Please don’t share this tip with photography 
elites, who will roll their eyes and inform you 
that the f in f-stop most certainly does not stand 
for focus but for the ratio between the aperture 
size and lens focal length — as if that’s help-
ful to know if you’re not an optical engineer. 
(Chapter 6 explains focal length, which is help-
ful to know.)
As for the fact that you increase the f-stop 
number when you want a smaller aperture, 
well, I’m still working on the ideal mnemonic tip 
for that one. But try this in the meantime: Lower 
f-stop, larger aperture. Or maybe the opposite: 
Raise the f-stop to reduce the aperture size and 
restrict the light. (As I said, I’m working on it.)

Hi 1.0 (ISO 6400)
Figure 5-5: Each step up the ISO ladder adds more noise, which becomes more visible 
as you enlarge the image.
Although you can definitely spot the noise in the close-ups starting at about 
ISO 800, you may be able to get away with even the maximum ISO if you keep 
your print or display size small. The candle image printed with the ISO close-
ups, for example, was taken at ISO 800, as most people couldn’t detect any 
appreciable noise. As with other image defects, noise becomes more appar-
ent as you enlarge the photo. Noise is also easier to spot in shadow areas of 
your picture and in large areas of solid color. 
At the low end of the ISO range, it’s important to know that the three Lo 
settings — Lo 3.0, Lo 0.7, and Lo 1.0, which are roughly equivalent to ISO 
160, 125, and 100, respectively — produce images with higher contrast than 
normal, which is why Nikon suggests that you use them only if you have no 
other choice. For example, in really bright light, you may need to drop down 
below ISO 200 in order to use a large aperture or slow shutter speed. A better 
solution, though, is to put a neutral density filter over your lens. This filter 
works like sunglasses for your lens, darkening the scene without affecting 
colors (thus, the neutral part of the filter name).

147
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Doing the exposure balancing act
 
As you change any of the three exposure settings — aperture, shutter speed, 
and ISO — one or both of the others must also shift in order to maintain the 
same image brightness. Say that you’re shooting a soccer game, for example, 
and you notice that although the overall exposure looks great, the players 
appear slightly blurry at your current shutter speed. If you raise the shut-
ter speed, you have to compensate with either a larger aperture, to allow in 
more light during the shorter exposure, or a higher ISO setting, to make the 
camera more sensitive to the light — or both.
As the preceding section explains, changing these settings impacts your 
image in ways beyond exposure. As a quick reminder:
 
✓ Aperture affects depth of field, with a higher f-stop number producing a 
greater zone of sharp focus.
 
✓ Shutter speed affects whether motion of the subject or camera results 
in a blurry photo. A faster shutter “freezes” action and also helps 
safeguard against allover blur that can result from camera shake when 
you’re handholding the camera.
 
✓ ISO affects the camera’s sensitivity to light. A higher ISO makes the 
camera more responsive to light but also increases the chance of 
image noise.
So when you boost that shutter speed to capture your soccer subjects, you 
have to decide whether you prefer the shorter depth of field that comes 
with a larger aperture or the increased risk of noise that accompanies a 
higher ISO.
Everyone has their own approach to finding the right combination of aper-
ture, shutter speed, and ISO, and you’ll no doubt develop your own system 
as you become more practiced at using your camera. In the meantime, here’s 
how I handle things:
 
✓ I always use ISO 200 unless the lighting conditions are such that I can’t 
use the aperture and shutter speed I want without adjusting ISO.
 
✓ If my subject is moving (or might move, as with a squiggly toddler or 
antsy pet), I give shutter speed the next highest priority in my exposure 
decision. I might choose a fast shutter speed to ensure a blur-free photo 
or, on the flip side, select a slow shutter to intentionally blur that moving 
object, an effect that can create a heightened sense of motion. (The water-
fall photo in Chapter 7 offers an example of the latter technique.)
 
✓ For images of non-moving subjects, I make aperture a priority over shut-
ter speed, setting the aperture according to the depth of field I have in 
mind. For portraits, for example, I use the largest aperture (the lowest 
f-stop number, known as shooting wide open, in photographer speak) so 
that I get a short depth of field, creating a nice, soft background for my 

148
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
subject. For landscapes, I usually go the opposite direction, stopping 
down the aperture as much as possible to capture the subject at the 
greatest depth of field.
I know that keeping all this straight is a little overwhelming at first, but the 
more you work with your camera, the more the whole exposure equation 
will make sense to you. You can find tips for choosing exposure settings for 
specific types of pictures in Chapter 7; keep moving through this chapter for 
details on how to actually monitor and adjust aperture, shutter speed, and 
ISO settings on the D300s.
Meet the Exposure Modes: P, S, A, and M
 
 Chapter 2 offers a brief introduction to your camera’s four exposure modes. 
You set the mode by pressing the Mode button as you rotate the main com-
mand dial. The Mode setting appears in the areas highlighted in Figure 5-6.
The exposure mode determines how much control you have over aperture 
and shutter speed, as follows:
 
✓ P (programmed autoexposure): In this mode, the camera selects both 
aperture and shutter speed. But you can choose from different combina-
tions of the two. This mode offers the most stress-free shooting avail-
able, which is why it’s the star of the “almost automatic” photography 
techniques outlined in Chapter 2. 
 
✓ S (shutter-priority autoexposure): In this mode, you select a shutter 
speed, and the camera chooses the aperture setting that produces a 
good exposure at your selected ISO setting. 
Figure 5-6: The exposure mode determines how much control you have over aperture and 
shutter speed.

149
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
✓ A (aperture-priority autoexposure): The opposite of shutter-priority 
autoexposure, this mode asks you to select the aperture setting. The 
camera then selects the appropriate shutter speed to properly expose 
the picture.
 
✓ M (manual exposure): In this mode, you specify both shutter speed and 
aperture. 
 
To sum up, the first three modes are semi-automatic exposure modes that are 
designed to help you get a good exposure by handling part of the work for you. 
You do still have some control over the ultimate exposure, though: If you think 
your picture is under- or overexposed, for example, you can ask for a brighter 
or darker result on your next shot by using Exposure Compensation, a feature 
outlined later in this chapter. You can tweak the results in other ways as well. 
It’s important to understand, though, that in extreme lighting conditions, the 
camera may not be able to select settings that will produce a good exposure no 
matter what you do. The camera will warn you about the potential problem but 
doesn’t prevent you from capturing the shot.
Manual mode puts all exposure control in your hands. If you’re a longtime 
photographer who comes from the days when manual exposure was the only 
game in town, you may prefer to stick with this mode. If it ain’t broke, don’t 
fix it, as they say. And in some ways, manual mode is simpler than the semi-
auto modes because if you’re not happy with the exposure, you just change 
the aperture, shutter speed, or ISO setting (or all three) and shoot again. You 
don’t have to apply Exposure Compensation or fiddle with other features that 
enable you to modify your autoexposure results.
My own personal choice is to use aperture-priority autoexposure when I’m 
shooting still subjects and want to control depth of field — aperture is my 
priority — and to switch to shutter-priority autoexposure when I’m shooting 
a moving subject and so am most concerned with controlling shutter speed. 
Frankly, my brain is taxed enough by all the other issues involved in taking 
pictures — what my white balance setting is, what resolution I need, where 
I’m going for lunch as soon as I make this shot work — that I just appreciate 
having the camera do some of the exposure lifting.
However, when I know exactly what aperture and shutter speed I want to 
use, or I’m after an out-of-the-ordinary exposure, I use manual exposure. For 
example, sometimes when I’m doing a still life in my studio, I want to create 
a certain mood by underexposing a subject or even shooting it in silhou-
ette. The camera is always going to fight you on that result in the P, S, and A 
modes because it so dearly wants to provide a good exposure. Rather than 
dialing in all the autoexposure tweaks that could eventually force the result 
I want, I simply set the mode to M, adjust the shutter speed and aperture 
directly, and give the autoexposure system the afternoon off. 
But even in manual mode, you’re never really flying without a net — the 
camera assists you by displaying the exposure meter, explained next.

150
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Reading (And Adjusting) the Meter
To help you determine whether your exposure settings are on cue in M 
(manual) exposure mode, the camera provides an exposure meter in the dis-
plays. The meter is the little linear graphic highlighted in Figure 5-7. You can 
see a close-up look at how the meter looks in the viewfinder in Figure 5-8. To 
activate the meter displays, just press the shutter button halfway and then 
release it.
The minus-sign end of the meter represents underexposure; the plus sign, 
overexposure. So if the little notches on the meter fall to the right of 0, as 
shown in the first example in Figure 5-8, the image will be underexposed. 
If the indicator moves to the left of 0, as shown in the second example, the 
image will be overexposed. The farther the indicator moves toward the plus 
or minus sign, the greater the potential problem. When the meter shows a 
balanced exposure, as in the third example, you’re good to go.
 
In the P, S, and A exposure modes, the meter appears in the displays only if 
the camera anticipates an exposure problem. The word Lo at the end of the 
meter tells you that the photo may be seriously underexposed; the word Hi 
indicates severe overexposure. The meter flashes if your exposure settings 
are so far off the chart that the amount of under- or overexposure exceeds 
the limits of the meter.

 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Exposure stops: How many do you want to see?
In photography, the term stop refers to an 
increment of exposure. To increase exposure 
by one stop means to adjust the aperture or 
shutter speed to allow twice as much light into 
the camera as the current settings permit. To 
reduce exposure a stop, you use settings that 
allow half as much light.
By default, all the major exposure-related set-
tings on the D300s are based on one-third stop 
adjustments. For example, when you adjust the 
Exposure Compensation value, a feature that 
enables you to request a brighter or darker pic-
ture than the camera’s autoexposure system 
thinks is correct, you can choose settings of EV 
0.0 (no adjustment), +0.3, +0.7, and +1.0 (a full 
stop of adjustment).
If you prefer, you can tell the camera to pres-
ent exposure settings in half-stop or whole-stop 
increments. You can even request different 
increments for different exposure options. Make 
your preferences known through the three 
options highlighted in the left figure here, found 
in the Metering/Exposure section of the Custom 
Setting menu. All three options offer the same 
three settings, shown on the right in the figure. 
(The menu uses the term step instead of stop, 
but the results are the same.) But each option 
affects specific exposure components:
 ✓ ISO Sensitivity Step Value: Affects ISO set-
tings only.
 ✓ EV Steps for Exposure Control: Affects shut-
ter speed, aperture, and exposure bracket-
ing settings. Also determines the increment 
used to indicate the amount of under- or 
overexposure in the meter.
 ✓ Exposure Comp/Fine Tune: Determines 
the increments available for Exposure 
Compensation and Flash Compensation.
Obviously, the default setting provides the 
greatest degree of exposure fine-tuning, so I 
stick with that option. In this book, all instruc-
tions also assume that you’re using the defaults.

152
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Keep in mind that the meter’s suggestion on exposure may not always be the 
one you want to follow. For example, you may want to shoot a backlit subject 
in silhouette, in which case you want that subject to be underexposed. In 
other words, the meter is a guide, not a dictator. In addition, the exposure 
information the meter reports is based on the exposure metering mode, which 
determines which part of the frame the camera considers when calculating 
exposure. See the upcoming section “Choosing an Exposure Metering Mode” 
for details.
 
If you’re so inclined, you can customize the meter in the following ways:
 
✓ Adjust the meter shutoff timing. The meter turns on anytime you 
press the shutter button halfway. But then it turns off automatically if 
you don’t press the button again for a period of time — 6 seconds, by 
default. You can adjust the shut-off timing through the Auto Meter-Off 
Delay option, found on the Timers/AE Lock submenu of the Custom 
Setting menu, as shown on the left in Figure 5-9. Shorter delay times con-
serve battery power.
 
✓ Reverse the meter orientation. You can flip the meter so that the posi-
tive (overexposure) side appears on the right and the negative (underex-
posure) side falls on the left. This option also lies on the Custom Setting 
menu, but on the Controls submenu. Look for the Reverse Indicators 
option, as shown on the right in the figure.
 
✓ Use the Multi Selector to activate the meters. In addition to using the 
shutter button to jumpstart the meters, you can set the Multi Selector 
directional buttons (up, down, left, right) to do the job. To take advantage 
of this option, head for the Controls section of the Custom Setting menu 
and choose the Multi Selector option, as shown on the left in Figure 5-10. 
Then select the Reset Meter-Off Delay option. (Despite the name, this set-
ting has no effect on the Auto Meter-Off Delay option.) Just be careful that 
you don’t inadvertently wake up the meters with an errant press of the 
Multi Selector and thereby unknowingly waste battery power.

Setting ISO, Aperture, and Shutter Speed
The next sections detail how to view and adjust these three critical exposure 
settings. For a review of how each setting affects your pictures, check out the 
first part of this chapter.
Adjusting aperture and shutter speed
You can view the current aperture (f-stop) and shutter speed in the Control 
panel, viewfinder, and Information display, as shown in Figure 5-11. If you 
don’t see the values, the exposure meter isn’t awake; press the shutter 
button halfway to bring it out of its slumber.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Before I explain how to select the f-stop and shutter speed, I need to share a 
few notes about the latter setting:
 
✓ Shutter speeds are presented as whole numbers, even if the shutter 
speed is set to a fraction of a second. For example, the number 125 indi-
cates a shutter speed of 1/125 second. When the shutter speed slows to 
1 second or more, quote marks appear after the number — 1” indicates 
a shutter speed of 1 second, 4” means 4 seconds, and so on.
 
✓ When you set the exposure mode to M (manual) or S (shutter-priority 
auto), you have access to two shutter speeds not displayed in the other 
modes:
 
• Bulb: At this setting, the shutter remains open as long as you hold 
down the shutter button. You can shoot bulb exposures only in 
the M (manual) exposure mode. If you select the bulb setting in 
M mode and then change to the S (shutter-priority auto) mode, 
the word “Bulb” flashes in the display to remind you to change 
to manual exposure. Well, to remind you that something’s amiss, 
anyway.
 
• x250: In addition, you also see a setting that has an x before the 
value — x250, by default. The x, when used with shutter speeds, 
indicates the flash sync speed, which is the fastest shutter speed 
that works with flash. On the D300s, the default sync speed is 1/250 
second, but you can set another speed through a Custom Setting 
option. (See the later section “Exploring Flash Photography with 
D300s” for details.) If you do change the speed, the x value that 
appears as a shutter speed reflects the new setting. For example, if 
you set the maximum speed to 1/320 second, you see x320. If you 
want to use 1/320 second as your shutter speed, you can select 
either the x320 setting or the plain ol’ 1/320 setting. In other words, 
the x-value number is pretty much there just to remind you of the 
maximum flash sync speed.
With that enormously long introduction out of the way, the following list tells 
you how to actually select the aperture and shutter speed settings in each 
exposure mode: 
 
✓ P (programmed auto): In this mode, the camera shows you its recom-
mended f-stop and shutter speed when you press the shutter button 
halfway. But you can rotate the main command dial to select a different 
combination of settings. The number of possible combinations depends 
upon the aperture settings and shutter speeds the camera can select, 
which in turn depend on the lighting conditions, your lens, and the ISO 
setting.

155
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
 An asterisk (*) appears next to the P exposure mode symbol in the dis-
plays after you rotate the main command dial. The asterisk indicates that 
you adjusted the aperture/shutter speed settings from those the camera 
initially suggested. To get back to the initial combo of shutter speed and 
aperture, rotate the main command dial until the asterisk disappears.
 
 For a more thorough look at using this mode, see Chapter 2.
 
✓ S (shutter-priority autoexposure): In this mode, you select the shutter 
speed. Just rotate the main command dial to get the job done. Again, 
you can’t use the Bulb shutter speed in this mode.
 
 As you change the shutter speed, the camera automatically adjusts the 
aperture as needed to maintain what it considers the proper exposure. 
Remember that as the aperture shifts, so does depth of field — so even 
though you’re working in shutter-priority mode, keep an eye on the f-stop, 
too, if depth of field is important to your photo. Also note that in extreme 
lighting conditions, the camera may not be able to adjust the aperture 
enough to produce a good exposure at your current shutter speed — 
again, possible aperture settings depend on your lens. So you may need to 
compromise on shutter speed or ISO.
 
✓ A (aperture-priority autoexposure): In this mode, you control aperture, 
and the camera adjusts shutter speed automatically. To set the aperture 
(f-stop), rotate the sub-command dial.
 
 When you stop down the aperture (raise the f-stop value), be careful that 
the shutter speed doesn’t drop so low that you run the risk of camera shake 
if you handhold the camera — unless you have a tripod handy, of course. 
And if your scene contains moving objects, make sure that when you dial 
in your preferred f-stop, the shutter speed that the camera selects is fast 
enough to stop action (or slow enough to blur it, if that’s your creative 
goal). These same warnings apply when you use P mode, by the way.
 
✓ M (manual exposure): In this mode, you select both aperture and shut-
ter speed, like so:
 
• To adjust shutter speed: Rotate the main command dial. 
 
• To adjust aperture: Rotate the sub-command dial.
 
Keep in mind that when you use P, S, or A modes, the settings that the 
camera handles are selected based on what the exposure meter thinks is the 
proper exposure. If you don’t agree with the camera, you have two options: 
You can switch to manual exposure mode and simply dial in the aperture and 
shutter speed that deliver the exposure you want; or if you want to stay in 
P, S, or A mode, you can tweak exposure using the Exposure Compensation 
feature, explained later in this chapter. Adjusting the metering mode, ISO 
setting, and Active D-Lighting setting can also get you closer to the exposure 
result you’re after.

156
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Controlling ISO
 
The ISO setting, introduced at the start of this chapter, adjusts the camera’s 
sensitivity to light. At a higher ISO, you can use a faster shutter speed or 
a smaller aperture (higher f-stop number) because less light is needed to 
expose the image. But remember that a higher ISO also increases the possi-
bility of noise, as illustrated in Figure 5-5. (Be sure to check out the upcoming 
sidebar “Dampening noise” for features that may help calm noise somewhat.)
On the D300s, you can choose ISO values ranging from 200 to 3200, plus three 
more settings in each direction: Hi 0.3, Hi 0.7, and Hi 1.0; and Lo 0.3, Lo 0.7, 
and Lo 1.0. These settings, in order, translate to ISO values of about 160, 
125, and 100 at the low end and 4000, 5000, and 6400 at the high end. See the 
earlier section “ISO affects image noise” for advice on selecting the right ISO 
value.
The number of settings available between the top and bottom of the ISO 
range depend on a Custom Setting menu option called ISO Sensitivity Step 
Value, covered in the sidebar “Exposure stops: How many do you want to 
see?” By default, you can make adjustments in one-third stop increments.
 
ISO  Your current ISO setting appears in the Information display and viewfinder in 
the areas highlighted in Figure 5-12. To view the ISO setting in the Control 
panel, as shown in the figure, press the ISO button. To adjust the setting, 
press the button while rotating the main command dial.
You also can adjust ISO through the ISO Sensitivity Settings option on the 
Shooting menu, as shown in Figure 5-13. Going this route gives you access to 
an additional ISO option, ISO Sensitivity Auto Control. If you enable this fea-
ture, you still select an ISO value. But any time the camera thinks that your 
selected ISO will result in an over- or underexposed picture at your current 
f-stop and shutter speed settings, it automatically adjusts ISO to solve the 
problem.
Figure 5-12: Press the ISO button while rotating the main command dial to adjust ISO. 

157
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Figure 5-13: You can set limits for Auto ISO override.
 
If you enable Auto ISO Sensitivity, use the Maximum Sensitivity and Minimum 
Shutter Speed options, also shown in Figure 5-13, to tell the camera exactly 
when it should step in and offer ISO assistance. With the first option, you 
specify the highest ISO setting the camera may select when it overrides your 
ISO decision. The second option sets the minimum shutter speed at which 
the ISO override engages when you shoot in the P and A exposure modes. For 
example, you can specify that you want the camera to amp up ISO if the shut-
ter speed drops to 1/40 second or below. (However, the camera will override 
your wishes and use a slower shutter speed if it can’t produce a good expo-
sure at your maximum ISO setting.)
When automatic ISO adjustment is turned on, you see an ISO Auto label in 
the displays, as shown in Figure 5-14. If the camera is about to override your 
ISO setting, the label blinks. And in playback mode, the ISO value appears in 
red if you view your photos in the Shooting Data and Overview Data display 
modes. (Chapter 4 has details.)
Figure 5-14: If Auto ISO blinks, the camera is planning on overriding your current ISO setting.

158
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Dampening noise
A high ISO setting or a long exposure time — 
or both — can result in noise, the digital defect 
that gives your pictures a speckled look. (Refer 
to Figure 5-5.) To help solve the problem, the 
D300s offers two noise-removal filters: High 
ISO Noise Reduction, designed to reduce the 
appearance of ISO-related noise; and Long 
Exposure Noise Reduction, which dampens the 
type of noise that occurs during long exposures.
You can enable both filters through the Shooting 
menu, as shown in the left figure below, or 
through the control strip along the bottom of the 
Information display. To activate the strip, press 
the Info button twice. Then use the Multi Selector 
to highlight a filter. In the figure here, the Long 
Exposure Noise Reduction filter is active; the High 
ISO filter is directly above on the control strip. 
Press OK to access the available settings.
If you turn on Long Exposure Noise Reduction, 
the camera applies the filter to pictures taken 
at shutter speeds of longer than 8 seconds. 
For High ISO Noise Reduction, you can choose 
from four settings. The High, Normal, and Low 
settings apply the filter at ISO settings of 800 or 
higher; the setting you choose determines the 
strength of the filter. At the fourth setting, Off, 
the camera actually still applies a tiny amount 
of noise removal, but only when you shift into 
the Hi ISO settings (Hi 0.3 or greater).
Before you enable noise reduction, be aware 
that doing so has a few disadvantages. First, 
the filters are applied after you take the pic-
ture, as the camera processes the image data. 
(While the Long Exposure Noise Reduction filter 
is being applied, the message “Job nr” appears 
in the viewfinder and Control panel, in the area 
normally reserved for the shutter speed and 
aperture.) The time needed to apply the filter 
can slow down your shooting speed.
Second, noise-reduction filters work primar-
ily by applying a slight blur to the image. Don’t 
expect this process to totally eliminate noise, 
and do expect some resulting image softness. 
You may be able to get better results by using 
the blur tools or noise-removal filters found in 
many photo editors, because you can blur just 
the parts of the image where noise is most 
noticeable — usually in areas of flat color or 
little detail, such as skies.

 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Choosing an Exposure Metering Mode
 
To fully interpret what your exposure meter tells you, you need to know 
which metering mode is active. The metering mode determines which part of 
the frame the camera analyzes to calculate the proper exposure. The meter-
ing mode affects more than the meter, however: It also determines the expo-
sure settings that the camera selects for you when you shoot in the P, S, and 
A exposure modes.
Your camera offers three metering modes, which you select via the Metering 
selector switch, labeled in Figure 5-15. You can view an icon representing the 
selected mode in the viewfinder and Info display as well, as shown on the 
right in the figure.
Matrix
Center-weighted
Spot
Metering selector
Figure 5-15: The Metering mode determines which part of the frame is used to calculate 
exposure.
Here’s how each mode calculates exposure:
 
 
✓ Matrix: The camera bases exposure on the entire frame. Your camera 
manual refers to this mode as 3D Color Matrix II, which is simply the label 
that Nikon created to describe the specific technology used in this mode.
 
 
✓ Spot: In this mode, the camera bases exposure on a single, circular area 
that’s about 3.5mm in diameter and surrounds a specific focus point, as 
illustrated on the left in Figure 5-16. 

160
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Spot metering area
Center-weighted metering area
Figure 5-16: Spot metering bases exposure on a single focus point; center-weighted metering 
gives priority to a larger area at the center of the frame.
 
 Spot-metering performance is tied to some focusing options detailed in 
Chapter 6, as follows:
 
• If you use autofocusing and set the AF-area mode to Auto Area, 
in which the camera chooses the focus point for you, exposure is 
based on the center focus point.
 
• When you use the other AF-area mode settings (Dynamic Area 
or Single Point) or manual focusing, you use the Multi Selector 
to select a focus point, and the camera bases exposure on that 
point.
 
 
✓ Center-weighted: A blend of matrix and spot metering, the camera bases 
exposure on the entire frame but puts extra emphasis — or weight — on 
the center of the frame. 
 
 Normally, the area that’s given priority in this mode is about 8mm in 
diameter, as illustrated on the right in Figure 5-16. But you can alter the 
critical metering area through the Center-Weighted Area option, found 
in the Metering/Exposure section of the Custom setting menu and shown 
in Figure 5-17. You can change the size of the metering circle to 6mm, 
10mm, or 13mm.
 
 The Center-Weighted Area option also offers a setting called Avg, 
which tells the camera to take a reading of the entire frame and then 
base exposure on the average brightness values it sees. The difference 
between this option and the Matrix setting is that Matrix is based on 
a newer, more capable technology, while Avg is based on a system 

161
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
used in earlier Nikon cameras. Long-time Nikon shooters who are 
familiar with this metering option may appreciate its inclusion on the 
D300s, but the Matrix system typically delivers a better exposure if 
you’re concerned about objects throughout the frame, so I suggest that 
you stick with that when you want to expose the photo with the entire 
frame in mind.
Figure 5-17: You can customize the center-weighted metering area.
As an example of how metering mode affects exposure, Figure 5-18 shows 
the same image captured at each mode. In the Matrix example, the bright 
background caused the camera to select an exposure that left the statue 
quite dark. Switching to center-weighted metering helped somewhat, but 
didn’t quite bring the statue out of the shadows. Spot metering produced 
the best result as far as the statue goes, although the resulting increase 
in exposure left the sky and background monument a little washed out.
 
In theory, the best practice is to check the metering mode before you shoot 
and choose the one that best matches your exposure goals. But in practice, 
that’s a bit of a pain, not just in terms of having to adjust yet one more cap-
ture setting but in terms of having to remember to adjust one more capture 
setting. So here’s my advice: Until you’re really comfortable with all the 
other controls on your camera, just stick with the default setting, which 
is matrix metering. That mode produces good results in most situations, 
and, after all, you can see in the monitor whether you disagree with how 
the camera metered or exposed the image and simply reshoot after 
adjusting the exposure settings to your liking. This option, in my mind, 
makes the whole metering mode issue a lot less critical than it is when you 
shoot with film. Just remember that if you’re shooting a series of photos like 
the one in the figure, where your subject is significantly darker or lighter than 
the background, switching to spot or center-weighted metering is one way to 
make sure that the subject is properly exposed.

Matrix metering
Center-weighted metering
Spot metering
Figure 5-18: Spot and center-weighted metering can produce a better exposure of backlit 
subjects.
 
One final point about metering: An option called Fine-Tune Optimal Exposure, 
found on the Metering/Exposure submenu of the Custom Setting menu, 
enables you to fiddle with the metering system beyond just specifying the 
size of the center-weighted metering area. For each metering mode, you can 
specify that you always want a brighter or darker exposure than what Nikon’s 
engineers determined to be optimal when developing the camera. In essence, 
you’re recalibrating the meter. Although it’s nice to have this level of control, 
I really discourage you from making this adjustment unless you really know 
what you’re doing, both in terms of using the camera and calculating expo-
sure. It’s sort of like re-engineering your oven so that it heats to 300 degrees 
when the dial is set to 325 degrees — it’s easy to forget that you made the 
shift and not be able to figure out why your exposure settings aren’t deliver-
ing the results you expected. 
If your camera consistently under- or overexposes your pictures when you 
use the semi-automatic exposure modes (P, S, or A), it may be time for a 
service check at your local camera-repair shop, assuming that the problems 
occur even in normal lighting situations. For intermittent exposure issues, 
tweak picture brightness by using Exposure Compensation, explained next, 
when you use the semi-auto exposure modes (P, S, and A), or just adjust the 
aperture, shutter speed, or ISO in manual exposure mode (M). Also inves-
tigate the upcoming section about Active D-Lighting, which gives you yet 
another way to manipulate exposure.

163
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Applying Exposure Compensation
When you set your camera to the P, S, or A modes, you can enjoy autoexpo-
sure support but still retain some control over the final exposure. If you think 
that the image the camera produced is too dark or too light, you can use a 
feature known as Exposure Compensation.
This feature enables you to tell the camera to produce a darker or lighter 
exposure than what its autoexposure mechanism thinks is appropriate. Best 
of all, this feature is probably one of the easiest on the whole camera to 
understand. Here’s all there is to it:
 
✓ Exposure Compensation settings are stated in terms of EV values, as in 
+2.0 EV. Possible values range from +5.0 EV to –5.0 EV. (The EV stands 
for exposure value.)
 
 Each full number on the EV scale represents an exposure shift of one 
stop. If you’re new to this terminology, see the sidebar “Exposure stops: 
How many do you want to see?” elsewhere in this chapter. That sidebar 
also explains how you can tweak the increments of EV adjustment the 
camera offers.
 
✓ A setting of EV 0.0 results in no exposure adjustment.
 
✓ For a brighter image, raise the EV value. The higher you go, the brighter 
the image becomes.
 
✓ For a darker image, lower the EV value.
As an example, take a look at the first image in Figure 5-19. The initial expo-
sure selected by the camera left the balloon a tad too dark for my taste. So I 
just amped the Exposure Compensation setting to EV +1.0, which produced 
the brighter exposure on the right.
 
 To apply Exposure Compensation, hold down the Exposure Compensation 
button, found near the shutter button. All data except the Exposure 
Compensation value then disappears from the Control panel and is dimmed 
in the Information display. In the viewfinder, the frames-remaining value is 
replaced by the Exposure Compensation value. While holding the button, 
rotate the main command dial to adjust the EV value. The exposure meter 
reflects your change as you adjust the value.
After you release the button, the 0 on the meter in the viewfinder blinks to 
remind you that Exposure Compensation is active. You also see a little plus/
minus symbol (the same one that decorates the button itself) in the Control 
panel and Information display, and the meter readout indicates the amount 

164
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
of compensation you applied. For example, in Figure 5-20, the meter indicates 
an adjustment of EV +1.0. (If you have difficulty making out the meter reading, 
just press the Exposure Compensation button again to display the numerical 
value in the Control panel.)
EV +1.0
EV 0.0
Figure 5-19: For a brighter exposure, raise the EV value.
Figure 5-20: The plus/minus symbol tells you that Exposure Compensation is being applied.

165
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
Your Exposure Compensation setting remains in force until you change it, 
even if you power off the camera. So you may want to make a habit of check-
ing the setting before each shoot or always setting the value back to EV 0.0 
after taking the last shot for which you want to apply compensation.
Here are a few other tips about Exposure Compensation:
 
✓ How the camera arrives at the brighter or darker image you request 
through your Exposure Compensation setting depends on the exposure 
mode:
 
• In A (aperture-priority autoexposure) mode, the camera adjusts the 
shutter speed but leaves your selected f-stop in force. Be sure to 
check the resulting shutter speed to make sure that it isn’t so slow 
that camera shake or blur from moving objects is problematic.
 
• In S (shutter-priority autoexposure) mode, the opposite occurs: 
The camera opens or stops down the aperture, leaving your 
selected shutter speed alone. 
 
• In P (programmed autoexposure) mode, the camera decides 
whether to adjust aperture, shutter speed, or both.
 
• In all three modes, the camera may also adjust ISO if you have ISO 
Sensitivity Auto Control enabled.
 
 Keep in mind that the camera can adjust f-stop only so much, according 
to the aperture range of your lens. And the range of shutter speeds, too, 
is limited by the camera itself, although you’re not likely to reach those 
limits on the D300s, which offers speeds from 30 seconds to 1/8000 
second. If you do hit the aperture or shutter speed wall, you either have 
to compromise on shutter speed or aperture or adjust ISO. Remember 
that the exposure meter blinks if the camera can’t adjust the settings 
enough to produce a good exposure.
 
✓ When you use flash, the Exposure Compensation setting affects both 
background brightness and flash power. But you can further modify the 
flash power through a related option, Flash Compensation. You can find 
out more about that feature later in this chapter.
 
✓ The Metering/Exposure section of the Custom Setting menu contains an 
option called Easy Exposure Compensation. If you enable this feature, 
you can adjust the Exposure Compensation setting in the P and S expo-
sure modes simply by rotating the sub-command dial. In A exposure 
mode, you use the main command dial instead of the sub-command dial 
(because you use the sub-command dial in A mode to adjust the f-stop). 
I advise against enabling this feature: You can easily rotate the dial by 
mistake and not realize that you adjusted the setting.

166
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Finally, if you don’t want to fiddle with Exposure Compensation, just switch 
to manual exposure mode and select whatever aperture and shutter speed 
settings produce the exposure you’re after. Start with the settings selected 
by the camera in the autoexposure mode you were using and then just go 
from there. Exposure Compensation has no effect on manual exposures; 
again, that adjustment is made only in the P, S, and A modes.
 
 Although the camera doesn’t change your selected exposure settings in 
manual mode even if Exposure Compensation is enabled, the exposure 
meter is affected by the current setting, which can lead to some confusion. 
The meter indicates whether your shot will be properly exposed based on 
the Exposure Compensation setting. So if you don’t realize that Exposure 
Compensation is enabled, you may mistakenly adjust your exposure set-
tings when they’re actually on target for your subject. This is yet another 
reason why it’s best to always reset the Exposure Compensation setting 
back to EV 0.0 after you’re done using that feature.
Using Autoexposure Lock
To help ensure a proper exposure, your camera continually meters the light 
in a scene until the moment you depress the shutter button fully and capture 
the image. In autoexposure modes — that is, any mode but M — it also keeps 
adjusting exposure settings as needed to maintain a good exposure.
For most situations, this approach works great, resulting in the right set-
tings for the light that’s striking your subject at the moment you capture the 
image. But on occasion, you may want to lock in a certain combination of 
exposure settings. For example, perhaps you want your subject to appear at 
the far edge of the frame. If you were to use the normal shooting technique, 
you would place the subject under a focus point, press the shutter button 
halfway to lock focus and set the initial exposure, and then reframe to your 
desired composition to take the shot. The problem is that exposure is then 
recalculated based on the new framing, which can leave your subject under- 
or overexposed.
The easiest way to lock in exposure settings is to switch to M (manual) 
exposure mode and use the f-stop, shutter speed, and ISO settings that work 
best for your subject. But if you prefer to stay in P, S, or A mode, you can 
press the AE-L/AF-L button to lock exposure and focus before you reframe. 
By keeping the button pressed between shots, you can even keep using the 
same exposure and focus for a series of photographs. Here’s the technique I 
recommend:

167
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
1. Set the metering mode to spot 
metering.
 
 Just move the Metering mode 
selector switch to the setting 
shown in the top red box in 
Figure 5-21.
 
2. Set the camera to manual or 
autofocusing.
 
 For autofocusing, set the focus-
mode selector switch on the 
front of the camera to S. For 
manual focusing, set the switch 
to M. (Continuous autofocusing, 
represented by the C setting, 
isn’t possible with this exposure 
lock technique; C mode oper-
ates just like S in this scenario.)
 
 If your lens offers a focus-mode 
switch, set it to manual focusing 
or autofocusing as well.
 
3. For autofocusing, set the 
AF-area mode selector to the 
Single Point setting.
 
 The AF-area mode selector is the switch surrounded by the lower red 
box in Figure 5-21. Set the switch to the position shown in the figure. 
(Chapter 6 discusses this option.) When you select this setting, which 
tells the camera to base focus on a single focus point, a rectangle repre-
senting the focus point appears in the viewfinder (as it does when you 
set the focus mode to manual).
 
4. Use the Multi Selector to move the focus point over your subject.
 
 You sometimes need to press the shutter button halfway and release it 
to activate the exposure meters before you can do so. Also, be sure that 
the Focus-point selector lock switch, labeled in Figure 5-21, is set to the 
little white dot, as shown in the figure. Otherwise, you can’t adjust the 
focus point.
 
 In spot metering mode, the focus point determines the area used to cal-
culate exposure, so this step is critical whether you use autofocusing or 
manual focusing.

Figure 5-21: These settings work best when 
you want to use autoexposure lock and

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
5. Press the shutter button halfway. 
 
 The camera sets the initial exposure settings. If you’re using autofocus-
ing, focus is also set at this point. For manual focusing, twist the focus-
ing ring on the lens to bring the subject into focus. The green focus 
indicator dot in the viewfinder lights when focus is achieved.
 
 
6. Press and hold the AE-L/AF-L button.
 
 This button’s just to the right of the viewfinder.
 
 While the button is pressed, the letters AE-L appear at the left end of the 
viewfinder to remind you that exposure lock is applied. 
 
 By default, focus is locked at the same time if you’re using autofocusing. 
You can change this behavior by customizing the AE-L/AF-L button func-
tion, as outlined in Chapter 11.
 
7. Reframe the shot if desired and take the photo.
 
 Be sure to keep holding the AE-L/AF-L button until you release the shut-
ter button! And if you want to use the same focus and exposure settings 
for your next shot, just keep the AE-L/AF-L button pressed. 
 
Even though AE Lock is in effect, you can still adjust the aperture (in A expo-
sure mode) or shutter speed (S mode). Just rotate the sub-command dial (for 
A mode) or main command dial (for S mode). As you do, the camera automat-
ically shifts the other setting as needed to maintain the exposure at the level 
it was locked. In P mode, you can rotate the main command dial to select a 
different combination of aperture and f-stop without affecting the final expo-
sure as well.
Expanding Tonal Range with Active D-Lighting
A scene like the one in Figure 5-22 presents the classic photographer’s chal-
lenge: Choosing exposure settings that capture the darkest parts of the sub-
ject appropriately causes the brightest areas to be overexposed. And if you 
instead “expose for the highlights” — that is, set the exposure settings to 
capture the brightest regions properly — the darker areas are underexposed.
In the past, you had to choose between favoring the highlights or the shad-
ows. But thanks to a feature than Nikon calls Active D-Lighting, you have a 
better chance of keeping your highlights intact while better exposing the 
darkest areas. In my seal scene, turning on Active D-Lighting produced a 
brighter rendition of the darkest parts of the rocks and the seals, for exam-
ple, and yet the color in the sky didn’t get blown out as it did when I captured 
the image with Active D-Lighting turned off. The highlights in the seal and in 
the rocks on the lower-right corner of the image also are toned down a tad in 
the Active D-Lighting version.

169
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Active D-Lighting Off
Automatic Active D-Lighting On
Figure 5-22: Active D-Lighting enabled me to capture the shadows without blowing out 
the highlights.
 
Active D-Lighting actually does its thing in two stages. First, it selects expo-
sure settings that result in a slightly darker exposure than normal. This half 
of the equation guarantees that you retain details in your highlights. Without 
that adjustment, the brightest areas of the image might be overexposed, leav-
ing you with a batch of all-white pixels that really should contain a range of 
tones from light to lighter to white. So a cloud, for example, would appear as 
a big white blob, with no subtle tonal details to give it form. After you snap 
the photo, the second part of the process occurs. During this phase, the 
camera applies an internal software filter to brighten only the darkest areas 
of the image. This adjustment rescues shadow detail, so that you wind up 
with a range of dark tones instead of a big black blob.
You can turn Active D-Lighting on and off in two ways: 
 
✓ Select Active D-Lighting from the Shooting menu, as shown on the left in 
Figure 5-23. Press OK to display the second screen in the figure, where 
you can specify the amount of Active D-Lighting adjustment. At the Auto 
setting, the camera determines how much adjustment is needed. I used 
this setting for the seal photo in Figure 5-22. If you prefer to take control, 
you can select from one of the other four settings (Extra High, High, 
Normal, and Low). Press OK to enable the adjustment for your next shot.

170
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 5-23: At the Auto setting, the camera automatically applies the amount of Active 
D-Lighting adjustment as it sees fit.
 
 
✓ Press the Info button twice to 
activate the control strip at the 
bottom of the Information dis-
play. Then use the Multi Selector 
to highlight the Active D-Lighting 
icon, as shown in Figure 5-24, and 
press OK. You’re then taken to 
the menu screen where you can 
choose the level of adjustment 
you want to use.
 
A couple of pointers about using this 
feature:
 
✓ Nikon says that you’ll get the 
best Active D-Lighting results in 
matrix metering mode.
 
✓ If you’re not sure how much adjustment to apply, try out the Active 
D-Lighting bracketing feature. With this option, you take multiple shots 
of the subject, and the camera automatically selects a different Active 
D-Lighting adjustment for each shot. You then can decide which image 
you prefer. See the last section in this chapter for details.
 
✓ Active D-Lighting does have one drawback: The camera needs a moment 
or two to do its shadow-recovery work, which can sometimes be a hin-
drance when you need to fire off shots in rapid succession.
 
✓ The Retouch menu offers a D-Lighting filter that applies a similar adjust-
ment to existing pictures. (See Chapter 11 for help.) Some photo editing 
programs, such as Adobe Photoshop Elements and Photoshop, also have 
good shadow and highlight recovery filters. In either case, when you 
Figure 5-24: You can also access the 
D-Lighting options from the Information 
display control strip.

171
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
shoot with Active D-Lighting disabled, you’re better off setting the initial 
exposure settings to record the highlights as you want them. It’s very dif-
ficult to bring back lost highlight detail after the fact, but you typically can 
unearth at least a little bit of detail from the darkest areas of the image.
Exploring Flash Photography with the D300s
Sometimes, no amount of fiddling 
with aperture, shutter speed, and 
ISO produces a bright enough 
exposure — in which case, you 
simply have to add more light. The 
built-in flash on your D300s offers 
the most convenient solution, but 
you can also attach an external flash. 
You can connect the flash to the 
camera’s hot shoe, the connector on 
top of the camera, or via a flash sync 
cable attached to the connection 
hidden under the little rubber cover 
on the front of the camera. Figure 
5-25 labels both connection points.
 
 To raise the built-in flash, press the 
Flash button on the side of the 
camera, also labeled in Figure 5-25. 
To go flash-free, just press the top of 
the flash unit gently down to close it.
Like everything else on the D300s, 
flash options range from fairly simple 
to fairly not. Unfortunately, to keep 
this book from being exorbitantly 
large (and expensive), I can cover 
only the basics here. So I point you 
toward a couple of my favorite resources for delving more deeply into flash 
photography:
 
✓ Nikon’s Web site (www.nikon.com) offers some great tutorials on flash 
photography (as well as other subjects). Start in the Learn and Explore 
section of the site.
 
✓ A Web site completely dedicated to flash photography, www.strobist.
com, enables you to learn from and share with other photographers.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ You also can find several good books detailing the entire Nikon flash 
system, which it calls the Creative Lighting System (CLS, for short).
 
✓ Be sure to also visit Chapter 7, where you can find additional flash and 
lighting tips related to portraits and other specific types of photographs.
 
Before moving on, though, here’s one preliminary tip: Pay careful attention 
to your results when you use the built-in flash with a telephoto lens that is 
very long. You may find that the flash casts an unwanted shadow when it 
strikes the lens. For best results, try switching to an external flash head, as 
discussed near the end of this chapter.
Setting the flash mode
Whether you’re using the built-in flash or an external flash, you can choose 
from several flash modes. This setting determines the timing of the flash and 
also affects how much of the picture is exposed by ambient light and how 
much is lit by the flash.
 
 To set the mode, press the Flash Mode button on the front-left side of the 
camera while rotating the main command dial. As soon as you press the 
button, the Control panel and Information display change to show only an 
icon representing the flash mode and the current Flash Compensation value, 
as shown in Figure 5-26. (Flash Compensation enables you to adjust flash 
power; look for details later in this chapter.) In the viewfinder, you see only 
the Flash Compensation value plus a little lightning bolt icon indicating that 
flash is enabled, charged, and ready to fire. The viewfinder doesn’t present 
any information about the flash mode, so this is one setting you need to 
adjust while looking at the other displays.
Figure 5-26: Press the Flash Mode button while rotating the main command dial to change 
the flash mode.

173
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Your flash mode choices break down into three basic categories, described 
in the next sections: normal flash; red-eye reduction flash; and slow-sync and 
rear-sync flash, which are special-purpose flash options.
 
The flash mode icon in the Information 
display reflects the current setting for 
a Custom Setting menu option called 
Flash Cntrl for Built-in Flash, shown 
in Figure 5-27. For normal flash, stick 
with the default setting, TTL, as shown 
in the figure. (TTL stands for through 
the lens and refers to the fact that 
the camera bases the necessary flash 
power on the amount of light actually 
coming through the lens.) For a look 
at what the other options do, see the 
section “Changing to manual, repeat-
ing, or commander flash mode,” later 
in this chapter.
Front-curtain sync (normal flash)
 
 For normal flash, select the setting represented in the Information display 
and Control panel by the symbol you see in the margin here. (Again, the 
information display symbol includes the letters TTL, as shown in Figure 5-26.)
 
This mode is officially named front-curtain sync, which refers to how the flash 
is synchronized with the opening of the shutter. Here’s the deal: The D300s 
uses a type of shutter that involves two curtains moving across the frame 
each time you press and release the shutter button. When you press the 
shutter button, the first curtain opens, allowing light through to the sensor. 
At the end of the exposure, the second curtain draws across the frame to 
once again shield the sensor from light. With front-curtain sync, the flash 
fires at the moment the front curtain opens. This arrangement produces 
normal flash exposures. Rear-curtain sync, in which the flash fires at the end 
of the exposure, is a special-effects flash mode, as illustrated a little later in 
this chapter.
You may also hear this mode called fill or force flash on cameras that have an 
Auto flash setting, in which the camera decides when flash is needed. (Your 
D300s doesn’t have this option.) On these cameras, fill or force flash mode 
causes the flash to fire even in the brightest daylight — which, by the way, is 
often an excellent idea.
Yep, you read me correctly: Adding a flash can really improve outdoor 
photos, especially portraits, as shown in Figure 5-28. The small pop of light 
provided by the built-in flash is perfect for filling in shadows that can occur 
when your light source — the sun — is coming from above. Flash can also 
help bring out the details in flowers and other outdoor subjects. 
Figure 5-27: For normal flash operation, set 
this menu item to TTL.

174
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
No flash
Fill flash
Figure 5-28: The built-in flash is perfect for filling in shadows 
in outdoor portraits.
 
When you combine multiple light sources, such as flash with daylight, you 
may also notice that colors appear slightly warmer or cooler than neutral. To 
find out how to address this issue, see the Chapter 6 section related to the 
White Balance control.
 
Note, too, that when you use the built-in flash, you’re restricted to a top shut-
ter speed of 1/250 second by default. That means that in very bright sun, you 
may need to stop down the aperture significantly or lower ISO, if possible, 
to avoid overexposing the image. As another option, you can place a neutral 
density filter over your lens; this accessory simply reduces the light that 
comes through the lens, enabling you to use a larger aperture in bright sun. 

175
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
You also can bump up the maximum shutter speed for flash slightly for the 
built-in flash and access all shutter speeds when you use certain Nikon exter-
nal flash heads; see the section “Enabling high-speed flash (auto FP),” later in 
this chapter, for the pros and cons of doing so. 
Built-in or external flash, you can 
also get into trouble as a result of a 
too-slow shutter when you shoot in 
the P (programmed auto) or A (aper-
ture-priority auto) exposure modes. 
Remember, in these two modes, the 
camera controls shutter speed. And 
in dim lighting, the camera may drop 
the shutter speed quite low to ensure 
a good exposure, even if you use 
flash. But there’s a safety net you can 
employ: Through the Flash Shutter 
Speed option, shown in Figure 5-29, 
you can give the camera a slow-shut-
ter limit to use for flash photography. 
You can set the minimum shutter 
speed between 1/60 second and 30 
seconds. You’ll find this option in the Flash/Bracketing section of the Custom 
Setting menu.
 
This setting applies only to the normal, front-curtain sync flash mode as well 
as to the red-eye reduction mode and rear-sync mode, both discussed in 
upcoming sections. The camera completely ignores your limit if you choose 
slow-sync flash, slow-sync with red eye, or slow rear-curtain sync, also dis-
cussed later. So use a tripod in any of those modes to avoid the potential for 
blur due to camera shake.
Red-eye reduction flash 
Red-eye is caused when flash light bounces off a subject’s retinas and is 
reflected back to the camera lens. Red-eye is a human phenomena, though; 
with animals, the reflected light usually glows yellow, white, or green.
Man or beast, this issue isn’t nearly the problem with the type of pop-up flash 
found on your D300s as it is on non-SLR cameras. Your camera’s flash is posi-
tioned in such a way that the flash light usually doesn’t hit a subject’s eyes 
straight on, which lessens the chances of red-eye. However, red-eye may still 
be an issue when you use a lens with a long focal length (a telephoto lens) or 
you shoot subjects from a distance.
Figure 5-29: You can specify the slowest 
shutter speed the camera can use when you 
use flash in the P and A exposure modes.

176
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 If you do notice red-eye, you can try the red-eye reduction mode, represented 
by the icon shown in the margin here. In this mode, the AF-assist lamp on the 
front of the camera lights up briefly before the flash fires. The subject’s 
pupils constrict in response to the light, allowing less flash light to enter the 
eye and cause that glowing red reflection. Be sure to warn your subjects to 
wait for the flash, or they may step out of the frame or stop posing after they 
see the light from the AF-assist lamp.
For an even better solution, try the flash-free portrait tips covered in Chapter 
7. If you do a lot of portrait work that requires flash, you may also want to 
consider an external flash unit that offers a rotating head. You then can aim 
the flash toward the ceiling and “bounce” the light off the ceiling instead of 
aiming it directly at your subject. That technique produces softer lighting 
and also virtually eliminates the possibility of red-eye.
If all else fails, check out Chapter 11, which shows you how to use the built-in 
red-eye removal tool on your camera’s Retouch menu. Sadly, though, this fea-
ture removes only red-eye, not the yellow/green/white eye that you get with 
animal portraits.
Slow-sync and rear-curtain sync flash
In front-curtain sync (normal flash) and red-eye reduction flash modes, the 
flash and shutter are synchronized so that the flash fires at the exact moment 
the shutter opens. As mentioned earlier, technical types refer to this flash 
arrangement as front-curtain sync.
Your D300s also offers some special-sync modes, which work as follows:
 
✓ Slow-sync flash: This mode, available only in the P and A exposure 
modes, also uses front-curtain sync but allows a shutter speed slower 
than the 1/60 second minimum that is in force when you use fill flash 
and red-eye reduction flash. Remember, in these two exposure modes, 
you can’t directly control shutter speed, so the camera automatically 
drops down the shutter speed for you.
 
 The benefit of this longer exposure is that the camera has time to 
absorb more ambient light, which in turn has two effects: Background 
areas that are beyond the reach of the flash appear brighter, and less 
flash power is needed, resulting in softer lighting.
 
 The downside of the slow shutter speed is, well, the slow shutter speed. 
As discussed earlier in this chapter, the longer the exposure time, the 
more you have to worry about blur caused by movement of your subject 
or your camera. A tripod is essential to a good outcome, as are subjects 
that can hold very, very still. I find that the best practical use for this 
mode is shooting nighttime still-life subjects such as the one you see in 
Figure 5-30. But if you have an adult portrait subject, slow-sync can also 
produce good results; Chapter 7 has an example.

177
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Slow-sync flash
Normal flash
Figure 5-30: Slow-sync flash produces softer, more even lighting than normal flash 
in nighttime pictures.
 
 Some photographers, though, turn the downside of slow-sync flash to an 
upside, using it to purposely blur their subjects, thereby emphasizing 
motion.
 
 Whatever your creative goals, if you want to use flash with a slow shut-
ter in the S or M exposure mode, just choose the normal flash mode 
(front-curtain sync) and then select the shutter speed you want to use. 
The flash will fire at the beginning of the exposure. Or as an alternative 
choice, choose rear-curtain sync, explained next.
 
✓ Rear-curtain sync: In this mode, available in all four exposure modes, 
the flash fires at the very end of the exposure, just before the shutter’s 
second curtain draws across the frame to prevent any more light from 
hitting the image sensor.
 
 The classic use of this mode is to combine the flash with a slow shutter 
speed to create trailing-light effects like the one you see in Figure 5-31. 
With rear-curtain sync, the light trails extend behind the moving object 
(my hand, and the match, in this case), which makes visual sense. If 
instead you use slow-sync flash (or front-curtain sync with a slow shut-
ter), the light trails appear in front of the moving object.

178
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
 When you shoot in the P and A 
exposure modes, the camera 
actually combines slow-sync flash 
with rear-curtain sync when you 
select this flash mode. You see 
the words Slow Rear in the flash 
mode display area of the Control 
panel and Information display. 
(Insert junior-high potty joke 
here.) Shutter speeds automati-
cally drop below normal because 
the camera assumes that when 
you use rear-curtain flash, you’re 
after the longer exposure time 
needed to produce the “trailing 
ghost” effect. (In the M and S 
modes, you dial in that slow shut-
ter speed yourself.)
 
✓ Slow-sync with red-eye reduc-
tion: In P and A exposure modes, 
you can also combine a slow-sync 
flash with the red-eye reduction 
feature. Given the potential for 
blur that comes with a slow 
shutter, plus the potential for 
subjects to mistake the prelight from the AF-assist lamp for the real flash 
and walk out of the frame before the image is actually recorded, I vote 
this flash mode as the most difficult to pull off successfully.
Note that all of these modes are somewhat tricky to use successfully, how-
ever. So have fun playing around, but at the same time, don’t feel too badly if 
you don’t have time right now to master these modes plus all the other expo-
sure options presented to you in this chapter. In the meantime, do a Web 
search for slow-sync and rear-sync image examples if you want to get a better 
idea of the effects that other photographers create with these flash modes.
Adjusting flash output
 
On the D300s, the way the camera calculates the necessary flash output 
varies depending on your exposure metering mode:
 
✓ In matrix and center-weighted modes, flash power is adjusted to expose 
the picture using a balance of ambient light and flash light. Nikon uses 
the term i-TTL Balanced Fill Flash for this technology. The i stands for 
intelligent; again, the TTL means that the camera calculates exposure 
by reading the light that’s coming through the lens. The balanced fill 
part refers to the fact that the flash is used to fill in shadow areas, while 
Figure 5-31: I used rear-curtain flash and a 
shutter speed of about 1.5 seconds to create 
this candle-lighting image.

179
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
brighter areas are exposed by the available light, resulting (usually) in a 
pleasing balance of the two light sources.
 
✓ In spot metering mode, the camera assumes that you are primarily 
interested in a single area of the frame. So it calculates flash power on 
the same single area it uses to calculate overall exposure, without much 
regard for the background. This mode is called Standard i-TTL Flash. (See 
the earlier discussion of metering modes to find out how the specific 
metering spot, which is based on a single autofocus point, is chosen.)
Regardless of your metering mode, if you want a little more or less flash light 
than the camera thinks is appropriate, you can adjust the flash output by 
using a feature called Flash Compensation.
This feature works just like Exposure Compensation, discussed earlier in 
the chapter, except that it enables you to tweak flash power instead of the 
overall exposure. As with Exposure Compensation, the Flash Compensation 
settings are stated in terms of EV (exposure value) numbers. A setting of 0.0 
indicates no flash adjustment; you can increase the flash power to EV +1.0 or 
decrease it to EV –3.0.
As an example of the benefit of this feature, look at the carousel images in 
Figure 5-32. The first image shows you a flash-free shot. Clearly, I needed a 
flash to compensate for the fact that the horses were shadowed by the roof 
of the carousel. But at normal flash power, as shown in the same image, the 
flash was too strong, creating glare in some spots and blowing out the high-
lights in the white mane, as shown in the middle image. By dialing the flash 
power down to EV –0.7, I got a softer flash that straddled the line perfectly 
between no flash and too much flash.
As for boosting the flash output, well, you may find it necessary on some 
occasions, but don’t expect the built-in flash to work miracles even at a Flash 
Compensation of +1.0. Any built-in flash has a limited range, and you simply 
can’t expect the flash light to reach faraway objects. In other words, don’t 
even try taking flash pictures of a darkened recital hall from your seat in the 
balcony — all you’ll wind up doing is annoying everyone.
 
 With that preface in mind, you adjust flash power by pressing the Flash 
Exposure button while rotating the sub-command dial. (Rotating the main 
dial adjusts the flash mode.) As long as you hold the button, the Flash 
Compensation setting appears in the Control panel and Information display, 
as shown in Figure 5-33. In the viewfinder, the current setting takes the place 
of the usual frames-remaining value, and a plus or minus sign also appears to 
indicate whether you’re dialing in a positive or negative value. 
After you release the Flash button, you see just the Flash Compensation icon 
in all three displays. To check the specific compensation value, press and 
hold the Flash button.

181
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
As with Exposure Compensation, any flash-power adjustment you make 
remains in force, even if you turn off the camera, until you reset the control. 
So be sure to check the setting before you next use your flash.
Locking flash exposure on your subject
With a feature called FV Lock, or flash value lock, you can lock flash power 
similar to the way you can use the AE-L/AF-L button to lock autoexposure. 
(Note that not all external flash units support this function; the camera 
manual and your flash manual provide a list of supported flash models.) 
This option can come in handy when you want to compose your photo so 
that your subject is located at the edge of the frame, for example. You frame 
the scene initially so the subject is at the center of the frame, lock the flash 
power, and then reframe. If you didn’t lock the flash value, the camera would 
calculate flash power on your final framing, which could be inappropriate for 
your subject. You also can use FV Lock to maintain a consistent flash power 
for a series of shots.
 
In order to use this feature, however, you first need to program a button to 
do the job. You can assign this task to the AE-L/AF-L button, on the back of 
the camera, or to the Fn button or the Depth-of-Field Preview button, both 
found on the front-right side of the camera, to do the job. Chapter 10 pro-
vides specifics. The rub is that if you assign this task to a button, you lose 
whatever function is normally accomplished by pressing the button as well 
as the function that’s performed by pressing the button and rotating a com-
mand dial. Again, Chapter 10 has details to help you make your decision.
If you do assign a button to perform Fv Lock, here’s how to use it: 
 
1. Frame the shot so that your subject is in the center of the viewfinder. 
 
 You can adjust composition after locking the flash power if you want.
 
2. Press and hold the shutter button halfway to engage the exposure 
meter and, in autofocus mode, set focus.
 
3. Press the button that was assigned the Fv Lock function.
 
 The flash fires a little preflash to determine the correct flash power. 
When flash power is locked, you see a little flash symbol with the letter 
L at the left end of the viewfinder, next to the metering mode icon. The 
same symbol appears in the Control panel and Information display.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Exploring a few additional flash options
For most people, the flash options covered to this point in the chapter are 
the most useful on a regular basis. But your D300s does offer a few other 
flash options that some photographers may appreciate on occasion, so the 
next several sections provide a quick look-see. Again, keep in mind that I am 
only touching on the most prominent highlights — be sure to dive into the 
camera manual or your flash manual, if you use an external flash unit, for all 
the nitty-gritty.
Enabling high-speed flash (auto FP) 
In order to properly expose flash pictures, the camera has to synchronize 
the timing of the flash output with the opening and closing of the shutter. For 
technical reasons that are too gnarly to get into in this book, this synchroni-
zation normally dictates a maximum shutter speed of 1/250 second when you 
use the built-in flash on the D300s.
Through a Custom Setting menu option, you can bump the maximum sync 
speed up to 1/320 second for the built-in flash, however. Furthermore, if you 
attach some specific Nikon flash units, you can take advantage of a Nikon fea-
ture called Auto FP flash, which enables you to access the full range of shut-
ter speeds, all the way up to 1/8000 second.
 
It’s important to note, though, that when Auto FP flash is used, the flash 
fires a little differently than normal. Instead of a single pop of light, it emits a 
continuous, rapid-fire burst for the entire time that the shutter is open. This 
rapid firing of the flash, while it sounds like a good thing, actually forces a 
reduction of the flash power, thereby shortening the distance over which 
subjects remain illuminated. The faster your shutter speed, the greater the 
impact on the flash power. So at very high speeds, your subject needs to be 
pretty close to the camera in order to be properly exposed by the flash. You 
also lose a little flash effectiveness when you set the built-in flash to sync at 
1/320 second.
Because of this limitation, high-speed flash is mostly useful for shooting por-
traits or other close-up subjects. In fact, it’s very useful when you’re shooting 
portraits outside in the daytime because it permits you to use a wide-open 
aperture to blur the background. At a shutter speed of 1/250 second, that 
shutter speed and aperture combination would normally overexpose the 
picture. With high-speed flash, you can increase the shutter speed enough to 
compensate for the large aperture. 
To access the high-speed flash option, open the Flash/Bracketing section of 
the Custom Setting menu and select the Flash Sync Speed option, as shown in 
Figure 5-34. You can choose from the following settings:

183
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Figure 5-34: Through this option, you can enable high-speed flash, permitting a faster 
maximum shutter speed for flash photos.
 
✓ 1/320 s (Auto FP): At this setting, you can use the built-in flash with 
speeds up to 1/320 second, but remember that using speeds over 
1/250 second reduces flash power slightly. For select Nikon flash units 
(models SB-900, SB-800, SB-600, and SB-R200), you can use shutter 
speeds up to 1/8000 second. At speeds between 1/250 and 1/320, flash 
power is less affected than when you use the other Auto FP setting, 
explained next.
 
✓ 1/250 s (Auto FP): This setting has no effect on the built-in flash. For 
compatible external flash units, the high-speed flash behavior kicks in 
at shutter speeds over 1/250 second. As shutter speed goes up, flash 
power is reduced.
 
✓ 1/250 s to 1/60 s: The other settings on the menu (see the right image in 
Figure 5-34) establish a fixed maximum sync speed. By default, it’s set to 
1/250 second. High-speed flash operation is disabled.
Using manual, repeating, or commander flash mode
The Bracketing/Flash submenu of the Custom Setting menu also offers a set-
ting called Flash Cntrl (Control) for Built-In Flash, as shown in Figure 5-35. 
Normally, your flash operates in the TTL, or through-the-lens, mode, in which 
the camera automatically determines the right flash output for you, as dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter.
However, if you’re an advanced flash user, you may want to explore the other 
options:
 
✓ Manual: In this mode, you can select a specific flash power, with set-
tings ranging from full power to 1/128 power. (If you’re hip to rating 
flash power by Guide Numbers, the manual spells out the ratings for the 
built-in flash.)

184
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 5-35: The Commander Mode option enables you to trigger off-camera flash units 
with your built-in flash.
 
✓ Repeating Flash: If you select this mode, the camera fires the flash 
repeatedly as long as the shutter is open. The resulting picture looks as 
though it was shot with a strobe light. In other words, this is a special-
effects function. You can modify certain aspects of the flash output, 
including how often the flash fires per second.
 
✓ Commander Mode: This mode enables the camera’s built-in flash as a 
master to trigger (command) off-camera flash units, which are called 
slaves. (I know, but don’t write me any nasty letters — I’m here to 
tell you what the terminology is, no matter how politically incorrect 
those words may be.) You can even set the power of the external units 
through the Commander Mode options and specify whether you want 
the built-in flash to simply trigger the other flash heads or add its own 
flash power to the scene.
 
 In order to use this feature, your external flash heads must support 
something called the Nikon Creative Lighting System. Visit the Nikon Web 
site to get a better idea of how the system works. It’s pretty cool, and 
it can provide you with some great added lighting flexibility without 
having to spend lots of money (although you certainly can) or rely on 
lots of bulky, traditional lighting equipment.
Firing a modeling flash
Chapter 6 introduces you to your D300s’s Depth-of-Field Preview button, 
which enables you to preview through the viewfinder how your selected 
aperture setting will affect depth of field. You can set up the button to also 
emit a modeling flash when you press the button. The feature works both 
with the built-in flash and an external flash head.

185
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
When you enable this feature, the flash 
emits a repeating, strobe-like series of 
flash light while you press the button. 
The idea is to enable you to preview 
how the light will fall on your subject. 
However, living subjects aren’t likely 
to appreciate the feature — it’s a bit 
blinding to have the flash going off 
repeatedly in your face. And obviously, 
using the feature drains the camera 
battery or, if you’re using an external 
flash, its battery.
If you do want to enable it, you can do 
so through the Modeling Flash option, 
found on the Bracketing/Flash sub-
menu of the Custom Setting menu, as 
shown in Figure 5-36.
Bracketing Exposures
Many professional photographers use a strategy called bracketing to ensure 
that at least one shot of a subject is properly exposed. They shoot the same 
subject multiple times, slightly varying the exposure settings for each image.
To make bracketing easy, your D300s offers automatic bracketing. When you 
enable this feature, your only job is to press the shutter button to record the 
shots; the camera automatically adjusts the exposure settings between each 
image.
The D300s, however, takes things one step further than most cameras that 
offer automatic bracketing, enabling you to bracket not just basic exposure, 
but also flash power, Active D-Lighting, and white balance. Furthermore, 
when bracketing exposure, flash, or white balance, you can capture a whop-
ping nine frames for each series of bracketed shots — most cameras limit 
you to three frames per series. Active D-Lighting bracketed series are limited 
to five frames because there are only five available Active D-Lighting settings 
(Off, Low, Normal, High, and Very High).
 
For ordinary, cover-your, uh, “bases” shooting, three frames per series 
should be plenty. But the mega-frames option is useful for HDR imaging. HDR 
stands for high dynamic range, with dynamic range referring to the spectrum 
of brightness values in a photograph. The idea behind HDR is to capture the 
Figure 5-36: After enabling this feature, 
you can press the Depth of Field Preview 
button to fire a modeling flash. 

186
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
same shot multiple times, using different exposure settings for each image. 
You then use special imaging software, called tone mapping software, to 
combine the exposures in a way that uses specific brightness values from 
each shot. By using this process, you get a shot that contains more detail in 
both the highlights and shadows that a camera could ever record in a single 
image.
Figure 5-37 shows an example. I captured this riverside scene five times; the 
first two images show you the brightest and darkest exposures. The bottom 
image shows the HDR composite.
Figure 5-37: Using HDR software tools, I merged the brightest and 
darkest exposures (top) along with several intermediate exposures, 
to produce the composite image (bottom). 
When applied to its extreme limits, HDR produces images that have some-
thing of a graphic-novel look. My example is pretty tame; some people might 
not even realize that any digital trickery has been involved. To me, it has the 
look of a hand-tinted photo.
HDR is all the rage right now in digital imaging circles, so if you want to 
explore more, you can find plenty of online examples and tone-mapping 
software recommendations. Or pick up a copy of High Dynamic Range 

187
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Digital Photography For Dummies by Robert Correll (Wiley). In the meantime, 
whether you’re interested in HDR or just want to give yourself an exposure 
safety net, the next section explains how to bracket exposure and flash. 
Following that, you can find details about bracketing Active D-Lighting. 
Chapter 6 walks you through the process of bracketing white balance.
Bracketing exposure and flash
Follow these steps to bracket exposure only, flash only, or both together. 
(Don’t be put off by the length of these steps; although describing the fea-
tures takes quite a few words, actually using them isn’t all that complicated.)
 
1. Specify what you want to bracket through the Auto Bracketing Set 
option, located in the Bracketing/Flash section of the Custom Setting 
menu.
 
 Shown in Figure 5-38, this option determines what aspect of your picture 
you want to vary between shots. For exposure and flash bracketing, you 
have three choices:
 
• AE & Flash: Brackets exposure settings and flash power between 
shots.
 
• AE only: Brackets exposure settings only.
 
 In P mode, the camera varies shutter speed and f-stop between 
shots to produce the different exposures. In S mode, it adjusts 
aperture only; in A and M modes, it changes shutter speed only. 
In all modes, ISO is also adjusted between shots if you enable ISO 
Sensitivity Auto Control, as outlined earlier in this chapter.
 
• Flash only: Brackets flash power only.
 
 If you select one of the first two options and plan to shoot in the manual 
exposure mode (M), move on to Step 2. Otherwise, skip to Step 3. 
Figure 5-38: Use this option to select the setting you want the camera to adjust between shots.

188
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
2. If you’re shooting in the manual exposure mode (M), modify the way 
the camera achieves the exposure variation (optional).
 
 Again, this option applies only if you set the Auto Bracketing Set to the 
AE or AE & Flash option. Normally, the camera adjusts shutter speed 
between shots to achieve the different exposures. But you can request a 
different setup if you prefer.
 
 To do so, select the Auto Bracketing (Mode M) option, found directly 
below the Auto Bracketing Set option on the Custom Setting menu. You 
have four choices, as shown in Figure 5-39.
 
• Flash/Speed: This setting results in the default bracketing behav-
ior. If you choose AE Only for the Auto Bracketing Set, the camera 
varies shutter speed between shots. If you choose AE & Flash, the 
camera varies shutter speed and flash power.
 
• Flash/Speed/Aperture: With this setting, the camera varies shutter 
speed and aperture if you set the Auto Bracketing Set to the AE 
Only option. Flash is also varied if you select the AE & Flash Auto 
Bracketing Set option.
 
• Flash/Aperture: This one works just like the Flash/Speed option, but 
the camera adjusts aperture between shots instead of shutter speed.
 
• Flash Only: This one limits the camera to adjusting flash only between 
shots if you set the Auto Bracketing Set to the AE & Flash option.
 
3. Choose the order in which you want the bracketed shots recorded.
 
 Make the call via the Bracket Order option, found with the other brack-
eting options on the Custom Setting menu. As shown in Figure 5-40, you 
have two options:
Figure 5-39: You can control which settings the camera adjusts between shots when you 
bracket exposure in manual exposure mode.

189
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Figure 5-40: You can choose the order in which you want the bracketed shots to be captured.
 
• MTR>Under>Over: This setting is the default. For a three-shot expo-
sure bracketing series, your first shot is captured at your original 
settings. (MTR stands for metered and designates the initial set-
tings suggested by the camera’s exposure meter.) The second 
image is captured at settings that produce a darker image, and the 
third, at settings that produce a brighter image.
 
 This sequence can vary slightly depending on how many frames 
you include in your bracketed series; if you’re a detail nut, you can 
find out the specific order used in every scenario in the camera 
manual.
 
• Under>MTR>Over: The darkest image is captured first, then the 
metered image, and then the brightest image.
 
4. Select the number of frames in each series by pressing the Fn button 
while rotating the main command dial.
 
 This step assumes that you haven’t altered the default behavior of the 
Function (Fn) button, a topic you can explore in Chapter 11. (The Fn 
button is the bottom button on the right-front side of the camera, under 
the AF-assist lamp and Depth-of-Field Preview button. There’s a little Fn 
label on the side of the button closest to the lens.)
 
 As soon as you press the button, you see the current bracketing 
settings in the Control panel and Information display, as shown in 
Figure 5-41. You also see an exposure meter with some symbols related 
to bracketing; more on how to interpret the bracketing information a 
little later.

Bracketed frames
Progress indicators
Bracket increment
Figure 5-41: Rotate the main command dial while pressing the Fn button to turn auto 
bracketing on and off.
 
 With the Fn button pressed, rotate the main command dial to cycle to 
through the available settings. Here’s what you can accomplish at each 
of the frame-count settings:
 
• Disable bracketing: Set the frame count to 0.
 
• Capture your original plus both darker and lighter frames: Choose 3, 
5, 7, or 9 frames. The camera records one image at your original 
exposure or flash settings and the others at settings that produce 
both brighter and darker exposures. For example, if you select 5, 
you get one original, one that’s a bit darker, another that’s darker 
still, and then two that shift to the brighter side of the exposure 
scale.
 
• Capture your original plus brighter frames only: Choose +2 or +3: 
Choose +2 to record just two frames: one at your original settings 
plus one brighter exposure. Choose +3 to get a third image that’s 
even brighter than the second.
 
• Capture your original plus darker frames only: Select –2 or –3. These 
settings work just like the preceding option, except that the brack-
eted frames are darker than your original.
 
5. Set the level of adjustment between frames by pressing the Fn button 
while rotating the sub-command dial.
 
 By default, you can adjust exposures by one-third stop (0.3), two-thirds 
stop (0.7), or a whole stop (1.0). If you vary the setting of the EV Steps 
for Exposure Control, found on the Metering/Exposure section of the 

191
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
Custom Setting menu, you have fewer options. If that menu option is 
set to 1/2 step, you can set the bracketing increment to a half-stop (0.5) 
or one stop. And if the menu option is set to 1 step, you can bracket in 
whole stops only. See the earlier sidebar “Exposure stops: How many do 
you want to see?” for details on this menu option and an explanation of 
stops.
 
 Now for the promised decoder guide to the bracketing information dis-
played with the meter: In the Control panel and Information display, the 
meter appears as shown in Figure 5-41 when you enable the three-frame 
bracketing option. The markings near the meter indicate the following:
 
• The little plus/minus symbol indicates that you set the bracketing 
set to vary an exposure setting (flash or overall exposure).
 
• The BKT symbol tells you bracketing is enabled.
 
• The notches under the meter show you how many frames are 
enabled and the amount of adjustment between frames. For exam-
ple, in the figure, the notch at the zero point represents the neutral 
shot — the one that will be recorded with no adjustment. The 
notches to the left and right show that the other two shots will be 
recorded at settings that produce a one-stop increase and a one-
stop decrease in exposure.
 
 All this assumes that you use the default setting for the Bracketing 
Order option on the Bracketing/Flash submenu, however. If you prefer, 
you can reverse the order in which the positive- and negative-value 
shots are recorded by choosing the second of the two Bracketing Order 
settings.
 
6. Release the Fn button to return to shooting mode.
 
 The bracketing frame and increment settings then disappear from the 
Control panel and Shooting Information display; the bracketing indica-
tors and the meter remain, along with the BKT icon.
 
7. Take your first shot.
 
 After you take the picture, the indicator representing the shot you just 
took disappears from under the meter. For example, if you are bracket-
ing three frames, the notch at the 0 position disappears after your first 
shot. 
 
8. Take the remaining shots in the series.
 
 When the series is done, the indicator scale returns to its original 
appearance, and you can then begin shooting the next series of brack-
eted shots.
 
9. To disable bracketing, press the Fn button and rotate the main com-
mand dial until the number of frames returns to 0.

192
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Bracketing Active-D Lighting
Active D-Lighting, as explained earlier in this chapter, adjusts exposure in a 
way that brightens shadows without blowing out highlights in the process. 
You can set up a bracketed series that applies different levels of the adjust-
ment to each shot.
The process varies slightly from the 
steps in the preceding section, so 
instead of repeating it all here, I’ll just 
hit the highlights:
 
1. Set the Auto Bracketing Set 
option to Active D-Lighting, as 
shown in Figure 5-42.
 
 This option is located in the 
Bracketing/Flash section of the 
Custom Setting menu.
 
 The other two bracketing setup 
options on the menu don’t matter 
for Active D-Lighting bracket-
ing. The camera always uses the 
default setting for Bracketing 
Order. And because aperture, shutter, and flash aren’t varied — just the 
amount of D-Lighting — the Auto Bracketing (Mode M) option is irrelevant 
as well, even if you use manual exposure.
 
2. Press the Function (Fn) button while rotating the main command dial 
to set the number of frames.
 
 With Active D-Lighting bracketing, you don’t set the frame count and 
level of shot-to-shot adjustment as you do for exposure and flash brack-
eting. Instead, the number of frames you select determines what Active 
D-Lighting setting is used for each frame.
 
 When you press the Fn button, the letters “ADL” appear in the area 
normally reserved for the frame count, as shown in Figure 5-43, and spin-
ning the main command dial adjusts the other value, which determines 
the number of frames and the Active-D-Lighting amount that’s applied to 
each frame. Here are your options:
 
• 2A: Records one image with Active D-Lighting turned off and 
another at the Auto setting, in which the camera analyzes the shot 
and determines how much adjustment to apply.
 
• 3: Records one shot with Active D-Lighting off, one at the Low 
level, and one at Normal.
Figure 5-42: You can capture a series of up 
to 5 shots, each with a different amount of 
Active D-Lighting applied.

193
 Chapter 5: Getting Creative with Exposure and Lighting
 
• 4: Adds one more frame captured at the High setting.
 
• 5: Adds yet a fifth frame, this one shot with an Extra High level of 
Active D-Lighting.
 
 Notice that in the Information display, the labels under the meter offer 
an indication of the settings that you get with each choice. For example, 
in Figure 5-43, the labels display the settings associated with recording 
three frames: Off, L (Low), and N (Normal).
 
3. Release the button and take your shots.
 
 As with exposure and flash bracketing, each little bar under the meter 
represents one frame in the series. After you capture a shot, the bar rep-
resenting that frame disappears. When you’ve captured all shots in the 
series, the meter indicators return to their “starting position.”
 
 Note that in the Information display (right image in Figure 5-43), you 
also see an “ADL-BKT” label to remind you exactly what setting you’re 
bracketing. 
Figure 5-43: With Active D-Lighting, a single value controls both the frame count and the 
level of Active D-Lighting adjustment.

Manipulating Focus and Color
In This Chapter
▶ Controlling the camera’s autofocusing performance
▶ Understanding focal lengths, depth of field, and other focus factors
▶ Exploring white balance and its affect on color
▶ Investigating other advanced color options
T
o many people, the word focus has just one interpretation when applied 
to a photograph: Either the subject is in focus or it’s blurry. And it’s 
true — this characteristic of your photographs is an important one. There’s 
not much to appreciate about an image that’s so blurry that you can’t make 
out whether you’re looking at Peru or Peoria.
But an artful photographer knows that there’s more to focus than 
simply getting a sharp image of a subject. You also need to 
consider depth of field, or the distance over which objects 
remain sharply focused. This chapter explains all the 
ways to control depth of field as well as how to take 
best advantage of the myriad focusing options on 
your camera.
In addition, this chapter dives into the topic of color, 
explaining your camera’s White Balance control, 
which compensates for the varying color casts cre-
ated by different light sources. You also can get my 
take on the other color features, including the Color 
Space option and Picture Controls, in this chapter.
Understanding Focusing Basics
One of the most important advantages you gain from stepping up to a pow-
erhouse camera like the D300s is access to an amazing array of autofocusing 
features, all designed to help you achieve tack-sharp focus with just the press 
of a button.

196
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Although I cover all the focusing options in this chapter, the two most criti-
cal to understand — and, coincidentally, the only two adjusted via external 
camera switches rather than through the Custom Setting menu — are the 
following:
 
✓ Focus mode: You use this setting to specify whether you want to focus 
manually or take advantage of one of two autofocusing options, one 
designed for still subjects and the other for moving subjects. (Keep in 
mind that whether you can take advantage of autofocusing depends on 
your lens. See Chapter 1 for a primer on lenses.)
 
✓ AF-area mode: If you go with autofocusing, you use this setting to tell 
the camera what area of the frame to analyze when establishing focus. 
You can ask the camera to consider all 51 of its autofocusing points, a 
single point, or something in between.
Together, these two options set the foundation for focusing with the D300s, 
so make learning them your priority. The next several sections detail each 
option individually. Within each section, you can read about the Custom 
Setting options that enable you to fine-tune the autofocus system, but if 
you start to feel overwhelmed, leave those options on the back burner and 
stick with the defaults until you get the basics nailed down. Wrapping up the 
focusing discussion, you can find a review of the steps you take to use differ-
ent combinations of the Focus mode/AF-area mode tag team.
One note before you dig in: Information in this chapter assumes that you 
haven’t changed the default functions of camera buttons (such as the center 
button of the Multi Selector and the shutter button). I detail those customization 
options in Chapter 10, but it’s a good idea to leave the buttons at their default 
settings until you’re fully acquainted with the camera — otherwise, instructions 
here (and those you find in the camera manual) aren’t going to work. 
Choosing a Focus mode: M, S, or C?
The first step in controlling focus with the D300s is to select a Focus mode, 
which sets the camera to either manual focusing or autofocusing. Depending 
on your lens, you may also need to set a focus-mode switch on it as well. 
Here’s the drill:
 
✓ Autofocusing: Set the camera’s Focus mode selector switch, shown in 
Figure 6-1, to one of the two autofocus settings, S or C. If your lens, like 
the one in the figure, has a focus mode switch, move that switch to the A 
position (or AF, depending on the lens) as well.
 
 The camera’s S and C autofocus settings work like so:
 
• S (single-servo autofocus): With this option, the camera locks focus 
when you depress the shutter button halfway. It’s designed for 
shooting stationary subjects. (Think S for still, stationary.)

197
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
• C (continuous-servo autofocus): In this mode, which is designed 
for moving subjects, the 
camera sets focus initially 
at the time you press the 
shutter button halfway but 
then continually adjusts 
focus as necessary up to 
the time you take the pic-
ture. (Think C for continu-
ous motion.)
 
 
 You can also press and hold the 
AF-ON button instead of the 
shutter button to initiate auto-
focusing. However, if your lens 
offers vibration reduction, be 
aware that the feature doesn’t 
work if you use the AF-ON 
button to focus; vibration 
reduction engages only when 
you focus using the shutter 
button. See the later section 
“Putting the AF-ON button to 
work” for more details on the 
AF-ON button.
 
✓ Manual focusing: Again, if your 
lens has an auto/manual switch, 
set it to the M (or MF) position. 
Set the camera’s Focus mode 
switch to M. With manual focus-
ing, you simply twist the focusing 
ring on the lens barrel to focus.
However you focus, you see the focus 
indicator light in the viewfinder when 
focus is achieved, as shown in Figure 
6-2. But in continuous-servo mode, the 
light may blink on and off while the 
camera adjusts focus in response to 
motion. When you use manual focus-
ing or pair the S or C autofocus modes 
with the Dynamic Area or Single Point 
AF-area mode (both explained later 
in this chapter), the indicator lights 
when the object under the selected 
focus point comes into focus. You 
can see what a focus point looks 
like in Figure 6-2; see the upcoming section “Selecting (and locking) a focus 
point” to find out more about selecting the point you want to use. If you set 
Lens focus mode

the AF-area mode to Auto Area, the camera selects the focus point for you; 
one or more focus points appear in the viewfinder after you press the shutter 
button halfway to let you know what points were used.
 
One other critical thing to note about the single-servo and continuous-servo 
modes: By default, the camera refuses to take a picture in single-servo (S) 
mode if it can’t achieve focus. No way, no how, it’s not going to take an out-of-
focus picture no matter how hard you press the shutter button. With continu-
ous-servo (C) autofocus, the opposite occurs: The camera assumes that 
because this mode is designed for shooting action, you want to capture the 
shot at the instant you press the shutter button, regardless of whether it had 
time to set focus.
Because Nikon figures you didn’t buy a camera as advanced as the D300s 
to be limited to only one way of doing things, though, you can adjust this 
behavior through the Custom Setting menu. The relevant options are the two 
AF Priority options at the top of the Autofocus section of the menu, shown in 
Figure 6-3. (The AF stands for autofocus.)
Figure 6-3: You can tell the camera whether to go ahead and take the picture even if focus 
hasn’t been achieved.
Here are your choices for each option:
 
✓ AF-C Priority Selection: For this option, which controls continuous-
servo focusing behavior, you have three possible settings, as shown on 
the right in Figure 6-3:
 
• Release: This setting is the default and enables you to take the pic-
ture regardless of whether focus is achieved.
 
• Release+Focus: In this mode, you can snap the pic before focus 
is set, but if you’re shooting a continuous burst of pictures — by 
using the Continuous release modes covered in Chapter 2 — the 
camera automatically slows the frame rate a little to give itself just 

199
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
a hair more time to focus between shots. This adjustment occurs 
only when the lighting on the subject is poor or little contrast 
exists in the scene.
 
• Focus: You can’t take the picture until focus is achieved and that 
little focus lamp lights in the viewfinder.
 
✓ AF-S Priority Selection: This option, shown in Figure 6-4, controls the 
shutter release for the single-servo (S) autofocus mode. You get only 
two choices: Release, which lets you take the picture regardless of 
whether focus is set; and Focus, which prevents you from taking the pic-
ture until the little focus lamp signals to you that focus is good.
Figure 6-4: At this (default) setting, the camera won’t take a picture until the focus indicator 
lamp lights.
 
To decide which option is right for you, you have to consider whether you’d 
rather have any shot, even if it’s out of focus, or capture only those that are 
in focus. I prefer the latter, so I set the AF-C option to Focus and the AF-S 
option to Locked. Why waste battery power, memory card space, and inevita-
ble time deleting out-of-focus pictures, after all? Yes, if you’re shooting rapid 
action, you may miss a few shots waiting for the focus to occur, but if they’re 
going to be lousy shots, who cares?
Sports shooters who regularly fire off hundreds of shots while covering an 
event, though, may want to “unlock” the shutter release for continuous-servo 
mode or at least shift to Release+Focus. Again, you may wind up with lots of 
wasted shots, but you increase the odds that you’ll capture that split-second 
“highlight reel” moment. If it’s slightly out of focus, you can probably retouch 
it enough to make it passable, especially if the picture content is truly spe-
cial. And by using camera settings that produce a large depth of field (zone 
of sharp focus), your subject may appear in focus even if the actual focusing 
point the camera used wasn’t dead on. Later sections in this chapter discuss 
depth of field.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Choosing an AF-area mode: One focus point or many?
When you look through the viewfinder, you see brackets on either side of the 
frame, as illustrated in Figure 6-5. These brackets indicate the overall auto-
focus area. Within those brackets are 51 possible autofocus points that the 
camera can analyze to establish focus. The figure shows the locations of the 
points; in real life, you see either a single point or no points at all, depending 
on which focus settings you use. 
The AF-area mode setting, which 
you select via the switch shown 
in Figure 6-6, determines how the 
camera decides which point to use as 
the focusing target. You have three 
choices:
 
 
✓ Single Point: This mode is 
designed to help you quickly and 
easily lock focus on a still subject. 
You select a single focus point, 
and the camera bases focus on 
that point only. This option is 
best paired with the single-servo 
(S) Focus mode, which is also 
geared to still subjects.
 
 
✓ Dynamic Area: With this option, 
designed for focusing on a 
moving subject, you select an 
initial focus point. But if your 
subject moves out of that 
point before you snap the pic-
ture, the camera looks to sur-
rounding points for focusing 
information. In order for this 
focus tracking to occur, 
though, you must pair this 
AF-area mode with the contin-
uous-servo (C) Focus mode.
 
 
✓ Auto Area: At this setting, the 
camera automatically chooses 
which of the 51 focus points to 
use. Focus priority is typically 
assigned to the object closest to the camera. Auto Area mode is best 
combined with single-servo autofocus — if you need continuous autofo-
cusing for a moving subject, you’re much better off using Dynamic Area 
mode, which is specially engineered to accomplish that task.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 Although Auto Area mode requires the least input from you, it’s also typ-
ically the slowest option because of the technology it must use to set 
focus. First, the camera analyzes all 51 focus points. Then it consults an 
internal database to try to match the information reported by those 51 
points to a huge collection of reference photographs. From that analysis, 
it makes an educated guess about which focus points are most appropri-
ate for your scene. Although it’s still amazingly fast considering what’s 
happening in the camera’s brain, it’s sometimes slower than either of 
the other two AF-area options.
Frankly, I don’t use Auto Area mode very often unless I’m handing the 
camera over to someone who’s inexperienced and wouldn’t know how to 
use the other two modes. And with a camera that costs nearly two grand, 
I can think of only a few people who I’d even trust to hand it over to. (“Oh, 
I’m sorry, but I’m borrowing this from my boss and I swore I wouldn’t let 
anyone else use it.”) So I keep things nice and simple and stick with two 
AF-area/Focus mode combos:
 
✓ For still subjects: Single Point AF-area mode and single-servo Focus mode.
 
✓ For moving subjects: Dynamic Area mode and continuous-servo Focus 
mode.
Upcoming sections spell out the exact steps you use to set focus with both of 
these autofocus pairings. Just in case you have a family member who would 
get all snippy if you refused to let them try your camera, I also include the 
steps for using Auto Area mode with single-servo autofocus.
First, though, I need to take a slight detour to explain how you select a spe-
cific focus point when you use Single Point or Dynamic Area modes or focus 
manually.
Selecting (and locking) a focus point
As soon as you set the AF-area mode to Dynamic Area or Single Point, you 
see a single focus point in the viewfinder. (Refer to Figure 6-2.) 
 
You also see a focus point in the viewfinder when you use manual focusing. 
It’s not absolutely critical to select a focus point if you trust your eyes to tell 
you when the scene is in focus. But if you want some backup from the 
camera, go ahead and set the focus point. When you twist the focusing ring, 
the green focus lamp in the viewfinder lights when the object under the 
selected point is in focus. (Note that this focus-feedback system works only 
with lenses that offer a maximum aperture of at least f/5.6.)
To select a focus point, first make sure that the focus-point selector lock 
switch is set to the position shown in Figure 6-7. Then just press the Multi 
Selector right, left, up, or down to cycle through the available focus points. 

202
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
If nothing happens, press the shutter button 
halfway to activate the metering system. Then 
release the button and try again.
A couple of additional tips:
 
✓ By default, 51 autofocus points are avail-
able. But through the AF Point Selection 
option, discussed in the next section, you 
can limit the number of points available for 
selection to 11.
 
✓ On the D300s, some focus points are more 
capable than others. The 15 center points 
use cross-type sensors, which evaluate focus 
by analyzing both horizontal and vertical 
lines in the scene. The other points assess 
only horizontal lines. Cross-type sensors 
typically work better, especially in dim 
lighting, so if you’re having trouble getting 
the camera to focus, select one of these 
focus points and try again.
 
✓ By default, you hit a “wall” when 
you reach the top, bottom, left, or 
right focus point in the group. So 
if the leftmost point is selected, 
for example, pressing left again 
gets you nowhere. But if you turn 
on the Focus Point Wrap-Around 
option, found with the other 
autofocus options on the Custom 
Setting menu and shown in Figure 
6-8, you instead jump to the right-
most point. I like this option, but 
it’s totally a personal preference.
 
✓ You can quickly select the center 
focus point at any time by press-
ing the center button of the Multi Selector. Again, this assumes that you 
haven’t changed the function of that button, an option you can explore 
in Chapter 10. Note that you can adjust the playback functions the 
button performs without affecting its role in shooting. Chapter 4 talks 
about the playback functions.
 
✓ If you want to use a certain focus point for a while, you can “lock in” that 
point by moving the focus-point selector lock to the L position. This fea-
ture ensures that an errant press of the Multi Selector doesn’t acciden-
tally change your selected point.

selector switch to the unlocked

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
✓ Your selected focus point also determines which part of the frame the 
camera uses to calculate exposure and flash power when you use the 
spot metering mode setting. See Chapter 5 for details.
Autofocusing with still subjects: 
Single Point+Single-servo AF
For stationary subjects, the fastest, most precise autofocus option is to pair 
the single-servo (S) Focus mode with the Single Point AF-area mode. With this 
combination, the autofocus system can quickly home in on your subject.
The approach is the same one spelled out in the “almost automatic” shooting 
section of Chapter 2. Here’s a quick recap, just to save you the trouble of flip-
ping back:
 
 
1. Set the AF-area mode switch to the Single Point position.
 
 It’s the one represented by the margin icon you see here and shown in 
Figure 6-7.
 
2. Set the Focus mode selector switch to S.
 
 Again, the switch for choosing that setting is on the left-front side of the 
camera. Don’t forget to also set your lens switch to autofocus mode.
 
3. Looking through the viewfinder, use the Multi Selector to position the 
focus point over your subject.
 
 If the focus point doesn’t respond, press the shutter button halfway and 
release it to jog the camera awake. Then try again.
 
4. Press the shutter button halfway to set focus.
 
 The camera displays a green focus lamp in the viewfinder and emits 
a beep to let you know that focus was achieved. (The beep doesn’t 
sound, however, if you set the AF-S Priority option, discussed earlier, 
to Release. You also can disable the beep through the Custom Setting 
menu, as covered in Chapter 1, or by setting the Release mode to Quiet.) 
Focus remains locked as long as you keep the shutter button pressed 
halfway. If you’re using autoexposure (P, S, or A modes), the initial 
exposure settings are also chosen at the moment you press the shutter 
button halfway, but they’re adjusted as needed up to the time you take 
the shot. 
 
5. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to take the shot.
 
 Don’t forget that by default, the camera doesn’t let you take the picture 
when focus isn’t set. To modify that behavior, see the earlier section 
“Choosing a Focus mode: M, S, or C?”
Now for a few nuances that I didn’t get into in Chapter 2: 

204
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Setting the number of available focus points: By default, you can select 
any of the camera’s 51 focus points. But through the AF Point Selection 
option on the Custom Setting menu, shown on the left in Figure 6-9, you 
can limit the number of points to the 11 shown on the right.
Figure 6-9: You can choose to limit the number of available focus points to the 11 shown here.
 
 Why would you do this? Because it enables you to choose a focus point 
more quickly — you don’t have to keep pressing the Multi Selector zil-
lions of times to get to the one you want to use. For that reason, I usually 
keep this option set to 11. Or, in the words of rock genius Nigel Tufnel of 
the band Spinal Tap, “This one goes to 11!”
 
✓ Positioning your subject outside a focus point: You can frame your 
subject so that it doesn’t fall under one of the focus points, if neces-
sary. Just compose the scene initially so that your subject is under a 
point, press the shutter button halfway to lock focus, and then reframe. 
However, note that if you’re using autoexposure, you may want to lock 
focus and exposure together using the AE-L/AF-L button, as covered in 
Chapter 5. Otherwise, exposure is adjusted to match your new framing, 
which may not work well for your subject. In fact, the Chapter 5 tech-
nique for locking exposure is designed to work when teamed up with the 
single-servo/Single Point autofocus settings.
 
✓ Reading the Info screen and Control panel icons: An icon represent-
ing the current AF-area mode appears in the highlighted spots shown 
in Figure 6-10. In the Information display, the icons changes to show 
you how many points are active (51 or 11) as well as the location of the 
selected focus point. For example, in the figure, 11 points are active, and 
the center point is selected. In the Control panel, you just see the loca-
tion of the selected point.

 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Focusing on moving subjects: Dynamic 
Area+continuous-servo AF
When you need to autofocus on a moving target, whether it’s a fast-paced 
subject or just a child playing, set the Focus mode switch to C (continuous-
servo autofocus) and the AF-area mode switch to Dynamic Area, as shown in 
Figure 6-11.
Figure 6-10: The display icons show you which focus point is selected.
Dynamic Area
Continuous-servo
Figure 6-11: For moving subjects, combine continuous-servo Focus 
mode with Dynamic Area mode.
With those preliminary setup steps down, use this technique to set focus:
 
1. Use the Multi Selector to choose an initial focus point.
 
 First, make sure that the focus-point selector switch is set to the 
unlocked position. (Refer to Figure 6-7.) Then press the directional but-
tons on the Multi Selector to move the focus point around the frame. 

206
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
(Again, you may need to press 
the shutter button halfway and 
release it before you can move 
the point.)
 
 The number of focus points avail-
able is either 51 or 11, depending 
on the setting you choose for the 
AF Point Selection option, dis-
cussed in the preceding section 
and shown in Figure 6-9. The 
default setting is 51.
 
 In the Dynamic Area mode, the 
camera looks for focus informa-
tion first from your selected 
focus point but then checks sur-
rounding points for focus infor-
mation if your subject moves from the selected point. By default, the 
eight points surrounding your selected point are the secondary focus 
targets. So a total of nine points actually are active, although only your 
selected point appears in the viewfinder. Figure 6-12 offers an illustra-
tion. If you select the center focus point, shown in black in the figure, 
the eight points shown in gray are the secondary focus targets.
 
 You can expand the number of available secondary focus points if you 
wish; more on that topic in the next section.
 
2. Frame your subject so that it falls under the selected focus point.
 
3. Press and hold the shutter button halfway to establish the initial 
focusing distance.
 
 Your button press also triggers exposure metering. If you’re using auto-
exposure, the camera sets the initial exposure settings. 
 
 Because you’re using the continuous-servo Focus mode, you don’t hear 
a beep when focus is achieved. But the focus indicator lamp in the view-
finder lights when the object under the selected focus point comes into 
focus.
 
4. If your subject moves, keep reframing as needed to keep the subject 
within the 9-point area.
 
 Try to keep the subject under the selected focus point to increase the 
odds of good focus. But as long as the subject falls within one of the nine 
points, focus should be adjusted accordingly. Note that you don’t see 
the focus point actually move in the viewfinder, but the focus tweak is 
happening just the same. (You can hear the focus motor doing its thing.)
 
 
 Should you want to “freeze” the focus adjustment at any time so that 
focus remains set at a specific distance, you can press and hold the 
AE-L/AF-L button. Remember, though, that the default setup for this 
Figure 6-12: By default, the Dynamic Area 
mode considers nine focus points: your 
selected point plus the eight surrounding 
points.

207
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
button freezes both focus and exposure. If you use this option a lot, you 
may want to decouple the two functions by the button customization 
options covered in Chapter 10. You can use the button to lock focus 
only, for example, and select another button to lock exposure only.
 
5. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to take the picture.
 
 At the default settings, the camera takes the picture when you press the 
shutter button regardless of whether focus has been achieved. To 
change this behavior, head for the AF-C Priority option on the Custom 
Setting menu; see the earlier section “Choosing a Focus mode: M, S, or 
C?” for details. 
After you get comfortable with this basic technique, you may want to explore 
a couple of tweaks you can make to this motion-capture autofocus duo. 
You can adjust the number of points the camera considers in Dynamic Area 
AF-area mode, and you can tell it what to do if someone unexpectedly walks 
between you and your subject after you focus. The next two sections explain.
First, though, I want to make one comment about focusing on moving sub-
jects: You can pair continuous-servo autofocus with the Single Point AF-area 
mode if you want. But if you go this route, you have to be sure you keep your 
subject underneath that one selected focus point up to the time you take the 
picture — the camera won’t look to any of the surrounding points for focus 
information. Although the Single Point method can sometimes make for a 
little faster focusing because the camera considers only that single point, it’s 
pretty tricky to do unless you’re working with a subject that’s moving in a 
very predictable pattern or within a very confined area — maybe a drummer 
sitting behind a drum kit, for example, or a conductor leading an orchestra.
Customizing the Dynamic Area focusing operation
Through the Dynamic AF-area option, found on the Custom Setting menu and 
shown in Figure 6-13, you can specify the exact number of points the camera 
evaluates in the Dynamic Area mode. You can set the point count to 9, 21, 
or 51. Through the fourth option on the menu, you can modify the way the 
camera does its subject tracking as well. 
The details:
 
✓ 9 point: This setting is the default and uses your selected focus point 
plus the eight surrounding points, as illustrated in Figure 6-12. It’s ideal 
when you have a moment or two to compose your shot and your subject 
is moving in a predictable way, making it easy to reframe as needed to 
keep the subject within the 9-point area.
 
 This setting also provides the fastest Dynamic Area autofocusing because 
the camera has to analyze the fewest number of autofocusing points. 

208
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 6-13: You can modify the number of Dynamic Area points and also choose from two 
51-point options.
 
✓ 21 point: The camera consid-
ers your selected point plus 20 
surrounding points. Figure 6-14 
shows you the 21-point grid 
that’s used if you select the 
center focus point, for example. 
Obviously, this setting enables 
your subject to move a little 
farther afield from your selected 
focus point and still remain in the 
target zone. So it works better 
than 9-point mode when you 
can’t quite predict the path your 
subject is going to take.
 
✓ 51 points: Although you still can specify a single point for establishing 
initial focus in this mode, the camera may then select any other point 
in the entire 51-point group if it thinks it’s warranted. It’s designed for 
subjects that are moving so rapidly that it’s hard to keep them within 
the framing area of the 21-point or 9-point setting — a flock of birds, for 
example.
 
 The drawback to this setting is focusing time: With all 51 points on 
deck, the camera has to work a little harder to find a focus target. To 
help compensate, set the Release mode to Continuous so that you can 
capture multiple frames with one press of the shutter button. In Single 
release mode, the camera will try to reset focus for each frame.
 
✓ 51 points with 3D Tracking: This mode works slightly differently than 
the other three. When you set focus initially, the camera analyzes the 
colors of the area under the focus point and tries to distinguish between 
the subject and the background. Then, if the subject moves, the camera 
Figure 6-14: The 21-point setting references 
these autofocus points.

209
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
attempts to follow that color and contrast pattern across the screen, 
adjusting focus as needed. When this happens, you can see the focus 
point jump around the viewfinder, letting you know what the camera 
is following. Nikon suggests that this mode is ideal for subjects moving 
from one side of the frame to the other at a fast pace.
 
 This technology can work pretty well when a lot of contrast exists between 
subject and background. So for best results, try to establish focus on a 
point that helps the camera distinguish the subject from the background. 
For example, if you’re photographing a soccer player who’s dressed in a 
green uniform and running on a green playing field, you make it tough for 
the camera if you set focus on the uniform. Instead, try to set focus on the 
player’s face or another area of contrast, such as lettering on the shirt.
 
 Additionally, if your subject moves completely out of the frame, you 
must release the shutter button and reset focus again. So while 3D 
Tracking can be really effective under the right conditions, it also 
requires a little more input from you.
 
As with the Single Point AF-area, you can get a reminder of how many 
points are currently in use by looking at the icons in the Control panel and 
Info display, as shown in Figure 6-15. In the figure, the icon shows that the 
51-point area is selected. Notice, though, the Information display icon. This 
icon reflects two Custom Settings options: your Dynamic AF Area setting 
plus the AF Point Selection setting, which enables you to limit the number 
of points you can select as your initial focus point from the default 51 to 11. 
If you change that setting to 11, the 11 available points appear darker than 
the others, with your selected point appearing both darker and larger. (In 
the figure, the center point is selected.) The camera still analyzes all the sur-
rounding points called for by your Dynamic AF Area setting — you’re just 
limited to choosing one of the 11 darker points as your starting focus target.
Figure 6-15: The AF-area mode icon tells you which of the four Dynamic Area point setups is 
in use.

210
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Obviously, choosing which focus-point scheme you want to use is something 
you should decide and select ahead of time — you don’t want to be monkey-
ing around with menu settings while the action is in progress. And getting a 
feel for which types of subjects work best with which settings is a matter of 
practice and experience — don’t expect to get it right in the first couple of 
tries. (Or if you do, don’t tell me, because it sure took me a while!)
Unfortunately, you can’t tell which setting you used when you review your 
pictures because that value doesn’t appear in the picture metadata. So the 
best way to teach yourself is to stick with one setting for an entire outing 
and then try a different one the next time. Or you can just jot down the frame 
number where you switched settings if you try different options with the 
same subject.
Preventing focusing miscues with tracking lock-on
So you’re shooting your friend’s volleyball game, practicing your action-
autofocusing skills. You’ve got your shot all set up, have the camera set to 
continuous-servo autofocus and Dynamic Area AF-area mode, and you’re 
just waiting for the moment your friend serves the ball. You’ve set the initial 
focus, and the camera’s doing its part by adjusting focus to accommodate 
her pre-serve moves. Then all of a sudden, some clueless interloper walks in 
front of the camera. Okay, it was the referee, who probably did have a right 
to be there, but still.
The good news is that as long as the ref gets out of the way before the action 
happens, you’re probably okay. A feature called focus tracking with lock-on, 
designed for just this scenario, tells the camera to ignore objects that appear 
temporarily in the scene after you begin focusing. Instead of resetting focus 
on the newcomer, the camera continues focusing on the original subject.
You can vary the length of time the camera waits before starting to refo-
cus through the Focus Tracking with Lock-On option, found on the Custom 
Setting menu and shown in Figure 6-16. Normal is the default setting. You can 
choose a longer or shorter delay or turn off the lock-on altogether. If you do 
turn off the lock-on, the camera starts refocusing on any object that appears 
in the frame between you and your original subject.
Shutter speed and blurry photos
A poorly focused photo isn’t always related to the 
issues discussed in this chapter. Any movement 
of the camera or subject can also cause blur. 
Both of these problems are related to shutter 
speed, an exposure control that I cover in 
Chapter 5. Be sure to also visit Chapter 7, which 
provides some additional tips for capturing 
moving objects without blur.

211
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Figure 6-16: This option controls how the autofocus system deals with objects that come 
between it and the subject after you initiate focusing.
Basic autofocus with Auto Area+Single Point AF
For reasons covered in the introduction to the AF-area mode setting, I recom-
mend that you make the other two modes (Single Point and Dynamic Area) 
your go-to options. With Auto Area, you’re asking the camera to figure out 
what part of the scene you want to be in sharpest focus.
If you do want to try Auto Area mode, follow these steps to take the picture:
 
1. Set the Focus mode selector switch to S (single-servo).
 
 Although you can use continuous-servo autofocus with the Auto Area 
mode, you’ll give the camera a better chance of locking onto a specific 
target if you use the Dynamic Area AF-area mode, explained in the pre-
ceding section. Single-servo mode is really a better teammate for the 
Auto Area mode.
 
 
2. Set the AF-area mode switch to Auto Area.
 
 It’s represented on the switch by the icon you see in the margin here. 
In the Information display and Control panel, the Auto Area setting is 
represented by the symbols you see in Figure 6-17. Notice the 51 little 
boxes inside the brackets, reminding you that all 51 autofocus points are 
active. (You can’t limit the number of available focus points as you can 
in the other two AF-Area modes.)
 
3. Frame your subject so that it appears within the autofocus area brack-
ets, as shown on the left in Figure 6-18.
 
 In Auto Area mode, you don’t see any focus points, and you can’t select 
a point for the camera to use.

212
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 6-17: These symbols represent that Auto Area mode.
Figure 6-18: The camera analyzes all 51 points and then lights up the ones it used to set focus.
 
4. To set focus, press the shutter button halfway.
 
 By default, pressing the shutter button kick-starts the exposure meter as 
well as sets focus.
 
 When focus is set, the focus lamp lights in the viewfinder and the 
camera beeps at you. In addition, one or more focus points light up, as 
shown on the right in Figure 6-18. Anything under those focus points is 
now in focus. Focus remains locked on those points as long as you keep 
the shutter button pressed halfway down.
 
5. Press the shutter button the rest of the way to take the picture.
 
 By default, the camera won’t let you take a picture until focus is 
achieved when you use single-servo autofocus. For details, see the ear-
lier section “Choosing a Focus mode: M, S, or C?”

213
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Putting the AF-ON button to work
 
 If you came to this chapter after exploring Chapter 4, you may be aware that 
you can use either the AF-ON button or the shutter button to focus during 
Live View shooting in Handheld mode. You can make the same choice for reg-
ular shooting. By default, pressing the AF-ON button has the same result on 
focusing as pressing the shutter button halfway.
 
However, there’s one big difference between the two options: Vibration 
Reduction does not engage when you use the AF-ON button to focus, either 
for Live View shooting or normal photography. That feature activates only 
when you use the shutter button to focus. That’s not a problem if you’re 
shooting with a tripod, in which case most lens manufacturers recommend 
that you turn off Vibration Reduction anyway. But it’s a pretty big uh-oh if 
you’re handholding the camera.
If vibration reduction isn’t an issue — whether because you’re a steady 
enough shooter that you can get away without it or you’re using a tripod — 
you may be interested to know that you can use the AF-ON button exclusively 
to initiate autofocus, removing that function from the shutter button. You 
make this adjustment through the AF Activation option, found with the other 
autofocus options on the Custom Setting menu and shown in Figure 6-19. At 
the default setting, Shutter/AF-ON, both buttons can be used to focus. The 
AF-ON Only setting removes the focusing function from the shutter button, 
which then takes responsibility only for exposure metering.
Figure 6-19: You can choose to focus only with the AF-ON button.
 
Some sports photographers prefer to make this change so they can use the 
AF-ON button to continually track focus and then press the shutter button to 
snap off frames. The advantage is that focus continues to track as long as you 
keep the AF-ON button down, even between frames, so you don’t have to 
keep resetting focus after each shot. Of course, you have to set the Focus 
mode to continuous-servo for the focus tracking to occur.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Exploring a few last autofocus tweaks
You can adjust three final focus options through the autofocus section of 
the Custom Setting menu. Figure 6-20 shows these menu options. (If your 
eyes are crossing from reading about all the options already discussed, 
don’t worry: These are the no-brainer types of options. Well, easy-brainer 
types, at least.)
Figure 6-20: The remaining autofocus customization options await here.
 
✓ AF Point Illumination: It happens so fast that you might not notice it 
unless you pay close attention, but when the camera establishes focus, 
the selected focus point in the viewfinder sometime flashes red and then 
goes back to black. At the default setting for this option (Auto), the red 
highlights are displayed only when the background is dark, which would 
make the black focus points difficult to see. You can choose the On set-
ting to force the highlights no matter whether the background is dark. 
Or you can choose Off to disable the highlights altogether.
 
✓ Built-in AF-Assist Illuminator: In dim lighting, the camera may emit a 
beam of light from the little lamp just below the Control panel, on the 
front of the camera. If you’re in a situation where that light could be dis-
tracting to others in the room, you can disable it by setting this option 
to Off. You may need to focus manually, though, because without the 
light to help it find its target, the autofocus system may have trouble.
 
✓ AF-ON for MB-D10: This option applies only if you attach the optional 
MB-D10 battery pack to the camera. That unit sports an AF-ON button 
just like the one on the camera back. Normally, the button serves the 
same purpose as the one on the camera. But through this option, you 
can assign it several other functions, such as locking both exposure and 
focus together.

215
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Finally, you can use options on the Controls section of the Custom Setting 
menu to set the Function (Fn) button, AE-L/AF-L button, and Depth of Field 
Preview button to lock focus or lock focus and exposure together. You also 
can use the Fn button together with the main command dial to adjust the 
number of focus points used in the Dynamic Area mode. But what say we 
leave that discussion for Chapter 10, okay? It’s time to move on from the 
technical talk about autofocusing and explore the fun side of focus: Depth of 
field and its creative impact on your photographs.
Manipulating Depth of Field
Getting familiar with the concept 
of depth of field is one of the big-
gest steps you can take to becom-
ing a more artful photographer. I 
introduce you to depth of field in 
Chapters 2 and 5, but here’s a quick 
recap just to hammer home the 
lesson:
 
✓ Depth of field refers to the dis-
tance over which objects in 
a photograph appear sharply 
focused.
 
✓ With a shallow, or small, depth 
of field, distant objects appear 
more softly focused than the 
main subject (assuming that you 
set focus on the main subject, of 
course).
 
✓ With a large depth of field, the 
zone of sharp focus extends to 
include objects at a distance 
from your subject.
Which arrangement works best 
depends entirely on your creative 
vision and your subject. In portraits, 
for example, a classic technique is to 
use a short depth of field, as I did for the photo in Figure 6-21. This approach 
increases emphasis on the subject while diminishing the impact of the back-
ground. But for the photo shown in Figure 6-22, I wanted to emphasize that 
Aperture, f/5.6; Focal length, 90mm
Figure 6-21: A shallow depth of field blurs the 
background and draws added attention to the 
subject.

216
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
the foreground figures were in 
St. Peter’s Square, at the Vatican, 
so I used a large depth of field, 
which kept the background build-
ings sharply focused and gave 
them equal weight in the scene.
So exactly how do you adjust 
depth of field? You have three 
points of control: aperture, focal 
length, and camera-to-subject 
distance, as spelled out in the 
following list:
 
✓ Aperture setting (f-stop): 
The aperture is one of 
three exposure settings, all 
explained fully in Chapter 5. 
Depth of field increases as 
you stop down the aperture 
(by choosing a higher f-stop 
number). For shallow depth 
of field, open the aperture 
(by choosing a lower f-stop 
number). Figure 6-23 offers 
an example; in the f/22 ver-
sion, focus is sharp all the 
way through the frame; 
in the f/13 version, focus 
softens as the distance from 
the center lure increases. I 
snapped both images using the same focal length and camera-to-subject 
distance, setting focus on the center lure.
 
✓ Lens focal length: In lay terms, focal length determines what the lens 
“sees.” As you increase focal length, measured in millimeters, the angle 
of view narrows, objects appear larger in the frame, and — the impor-
tant point for this discussion — depth of field decreases. Additionally, 
the spatial relationship of objects changes as you adjust focal length. 
As an example, Figure 6-24 compares the same scene shot at a focal 
length of 127mm and 183mm. I used the same aperture, f/5.6, for both 
examples.
 
 Whether you have any focal length flexibility depends on your lens: If you 
have a zoom lens, you can adjust the focal length — just zoom in or out. 
Aperture, f/14; Focal length, 42mm
Figure 6-22: A large depth of field keeps both 
foreground and background subjects in focus.

217
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
(The Nikon lens shown with the camera in this book, for example, offers a 
focal range of 18–55mm.) If you don’t have a zoom lens, the focal length is 
fixed, so scratch this means of manipulating depth of field.
 
 For more technical details about focal length and your camera, flip to 
Chapter 1 and explore the section related to choosing lenses.

Aperture, f/5.6; Focal length, 127mm
Aperture, f/5.6; Focal length, 183mm
Figure 6-24: Zooming to a longer focal length also reduces depth of field.
 
✓ Camera-to-subject distance: As you move the lens closer to your sub-
ject, depth of field decreases. This assumes that you don’t zoom in or 
out to reframe the picture, thereby changing the focal length. If you do, 
depth of field is affected by both the camera position and focal length.
 
Together, these three factors determine the maximum and minimum depth of 
field that you can achieve, as illustrated by my clever artwork in Figure 6-25 
and summed up in the following list:

219
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Greater depth of field:
Select higher f-stop
Decrease focal length (zoom out)
Move farther from subject
Shorter depth of field:
Select lower f-stop
Increase focal length (zoom in)
Move closer to subject
Figure 6-25: Your f-stop, focal length, and shooting distance determine depth of field.
 
✓ To produce the shallowest depth of field: Open the aperture as wide 
as possible (the lowest f-stop number), zoom in to the maximum focal 
length of your lens, and get as close as possible to your subject.
 
✓ To produce maximum depth of field: Stop down the aperture to the 
highest possible f-stop number, zoom out to the shortest focal length 
your lens offers, and move farther from your subject.
Here are a few additional tips and tricks related to depth of field:
 
✓ Aperture-priority autoexposure mode (A) enables you to easily control 
depth of field while enjoying exposure assistance from the camera. In 
this mode, detailed fully in Chapter 5, you set the f-stop, and the camera 
selects the appropriate shutter speed to produce a good exposure. The 
range of aperture settings you can access depends on your lens.
 
 Even in aperture-priority mode, keep an eye on shutter speed as well. To 
maintain the same exposure, shutter speed must change in tandem with 
aperture, and you may encounter a situation where the shutter speed is 
too slow to permit hand-holding of the camera. 
 
✓ Press the Depth-of-Field Preview button to get an idea of how your 
f-stop will affect depth of field. When you look through your view-
finder and press the shutter button halfway, you can get only a partial 

220
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
indication of the depth of field that your current camera settings will 
produce. You can see the effect of focal length and the camera-to-sub-
ject distance, but because the aperture is always fully open until you 
actually take the picture, the viewfinder doesn’t show you how your 
selected f-stop will affect depth of field.
 
 By using the Depth-of-Field 
Preview button on your camera, 
however, you can preview the 
f-stop’s impact. Almost hidden 
away on the front of your 
camera, the button is high-
lighted in Figure 6-26. When you 
press the button, the camera 
temporarily sets the aperture 
to your selected f-stop so that 
you can preview depth of field. 
At small apertures (high f-stop 
settings), the viewfinder display 
may become quite dark, but this 
doesn’t indicate a problem with 
exposure — it’s just a function of 
how the preview works.
 
 You also can tell the camera to 
emit a modeling flash when you 
preview depth-of-field and have 
flash enabled. By default, the 
modeling flash is turned off; if 
you want to experiment with this 
feature, visit the flash discussion 
in Chapter 5 for details. 
 
✓ For greater background blurring, move the subject farther from the 
background. The extent to which background focus shifts as you adjust 
depth of field also is affected by the distance between the subject and 
the background. For increased background blurring, move the subject 
farther in front of the background.
Controlling Color
Compared with understanding some aspects of digital photography — 
resolution, aperture and shutter speed, depth of field, and so on — making 
sense of your camera’s color options is easy-breezy. First, color problems 
aren’t all that common, and when they are, they’re usually simple to fix 
with a quick shift of your camera’s White Balance control. And getting a 
Figure 6-26: Press this button to get a preview 
of the effect of aperture on depth of field.

221
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
grip on color requires learning only a couple of new terms, an unusual 
state of affairs for an endeavor that often seems more like high-tech science 
than art.
The rest of this chapter explains the aforementioned White Balance control, 
plus a couple of menu options that enable you to fine-tune the way your 
camera renders colors. For information on how to use the Retouch menu’s 
color options to alter colors of existing pictures, see Chapter 11.
Correcting colors with white balance
Every light source emits a particular color cast. The old-fashioned fluores-
cent lights found in most public restrooms, for example, put out a bluish-
greenish light, which is why our reflections in the mirrors in those restrooms 
always look so sickly. And if you think that your beloved looks especially 
attractive by candlelight, you aren’t imagining things: Candlelight casts a 
warm, yellow-red glow that is flattering to the skin.
 
Science-y types measure the color of light, offi-
cially known as color temperature, on the Kelvin 
scale, which is named after its creator. You can 
see the Kelvin scale in Figure 6-27.
When photographers talk about “warm light” 
and “cool light,” though, they aren’t referring 
to the position on the Kelvin scale — or at least 
not in the way we usually think of temperatures, 
with a higher number meaning hotter. Instead, 
the terms describe the visual appearance of 
the light. Warm light, produced by candles and 
incandescent lights, falls in the red-yellow spec-
trum you see at the bottom of the Kelvin scale 
in Figure 6-27; cool light, in the blue-green spec-
trum, appears at the top of the Kelvin scale. 
At any rate, most of us don’t notice these fluc-
tuating colors of light because our eyes auto-
matically compensate for them. Except in very 
extreme lighting conditions, a white tablecloth 
appears white to us no matter whether we view it by candlelight, fluorescent 
light, or regular houselights.
Similarly, a digital camera compensates for different colors of light through 
a feature known as white balancing. Simply put, white balancing neutralizes 
light so that whites are always white, which in turn ensures that other colors 
are rendered accurately. If the camera senses warm light, it shifts colors 
slightly to the cool side of the color spectrum; in cool light, the camera shifts 
colors the opposite direction.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
The good news is that, as with your eyes, your camera’s Auto White Balance 
setting tackles this process remarkably well in most situations, which means 
that you can usually ignore it and concentrate on other aspects of your pic-
ture. But if your scene is lit by two or more light sources that cast different 
colors, the white balance sensor can get confused, producing an unwanted 
color cast like the one you see in the left image in Figure 6-28.
Figure 6-28: Multiple light sources resulted in a yellow color cast in Auto White Balance 
mode (left); switching to the Incandescent setting solved the problem (right).
I shot this product image in my home studio, which I light primarily with a 
couple of high-powered photo lights that use tungsten bulbs, which produce 
light with a color temperature similar to regular household incandescent 
bulbs. The problem is that the windows in that room also permit some pretty 
strong daylight to filter through. In Auto White Balance mode, the camera 
reacted to that daylight — which has a cool color cast — and applied too 
much warming, giving my original image a yellow tint. No problem: I just 
switched the White Balance mode from Auto to the Incandescent setting. The 
right image in Figure 6-28 shows the corrected colors.

223
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
The next section explains precisely how to make a simple white balance cor-
rection; following that, you can explore some advanced white balance options.
Changing the White Balance setting
The current White Balance setting appears in the Control panel and 
Information display, as shown in Figure 6-29. The settings are represented 
by the icons you see in Table 6-1.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
WB  The quickest way to change the setting is to press and hold the WB button as 
you rotate the main command dial. But note these factoids:
 
✓ Adjusting white balance through the Shooting menu: You also can 
change the White Balance setting from the Shooting menu. After 
highlighting the White Balance setting, press OK to display the list of 
options. Highlight the one you want to use and press OK. For all settings 
except PRE (Preset Manual), K, and Fluorescent, you’re taken to a screen 
where you can fine-tune the amount of adjustment the camera applies 
to colors. See the next section for details. If you don’t want to make any 
adjustment, just press OK.
 
✓ Specifying a color temperature through the K white-balance setting: 
If you know the exact color temperature of your light source — per-
haps you’re using some special studio bulbs, for example — you can 
tell the camera to balance colors for that precise temperature. (Well, 
technically, you have to choose from a preset list of temperatures, but 
you should be able to get close to the temperature you have in mind.) 
First, select the K White Balance setting. (K for Kelvin, get it?) Then, 
while pressing the WB button, rotate the sub-command dial to set the 
color temperature, which appears at the top of the Control panel and 
Information display, as shown in Figure 6-30.
Figure 6-30: Set the White Balance option to K to select a specific color temperature.
 
 You also can set the temperature through the White Balance option on 
the Shooting menu. If you do, you see the fine-tuning screen after you 
select the temperature and press OK. Again, just press OK to exit the 
screen without making any adjustment. 
 
✓ Specifying a fluorescent bulb type: For the Fluorescent setting, you 
can select from seven types of bulbs. To do so, you must go through the 
Shooting menu. Select Fluorescent as the White Balance setting and then 
press OK to display the list of bulbs, as shown in Figure 6-31. Select the 

225
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
option that most closely matches your bulbs and then press OK. Press 
OK again, and you’re taken to the fine-tuning screen. If you don’t want to 
make any further adjustment, just press OK once more to return to the 
Shooting menu. 
 
 After you select a fluorescent bulb type, that option is always used when 
you use the WB button to select the Fluorescent White Balance setting. 
Again, you can change the bulb type only through the Shooting menu.
 
✓ Creating a custom White Balance preset: The PRE (Preset Manual) 
option enables you to create and store a precise, customized White 
Balance setting, as explained in the upcoming “Creating White Balance 
presets” section. This setting is the fastest way to achieve accurate 
colors when your scene is lit by multiple light sources that have differ-
ing color temperatures. 
Figure 6-31: You can select a specific type of fluorescent bulb.
 
Your selected White Balance setting remains in force until you change it. So 
you may want to get in the habit of resetting the option to the Auto setting 
after you finish shooting whatever subject it was that caused you to switch to 
manual White Balance mode.
Fine-tuning White Balance settings
You can fine-tune any White Balance setting (Daylight, Cloudy, and so on). 
For the greatest amount of control, make the adjustment as spelled out in 
these steps: 
 
1. Display the Shooting menu, highlight White Balance, and press OK.
 
2. Highlight the White Balance setting you want to adjust, as shown on 
the left in Figure 6-32, and press the Multi Selector right.

226
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Color shift marker
Figure 6-32: You can fine-tune the White Balance settings via the Shooting menu.
 
 Now you’re taken to a screen where you can do your fine-tuning, as 
shown on the right in Figure 6-32.
 
 If you select Fluorescent or K (Choose Color Temperature), you first go 
to a screen where you select a specific type of bulb or Kelvin color tem-
perature, as covered in the preceding section. After you highlight your 
choice, press OK to get to the fine-tuning screen. For custom presets 
that you create, you must select the preset you want to use and press 
OK. (See the next section for an explanation of presets.)
 
3. Fine-tune the setting by using the Multi Selector to move the white 
balance shift marker in the color grid.
 
 The grid is set up around two color pairs: Green and Magenta, rep-
resented by G and M; and Blue and Amber, represented by B and A. 
By pressing the Multi Selector, you can move the adjustment marker 
around the grid. 
 
 As you move the marker, the A–B and G–M boxes on the right side of 
the screen show you the current amount of color shift. A value of 0 indi-
cates the default amount of color compensation applied by the selected 
White Balance setting. In Figure 6-32, for example, I moved the marker 
two levels toward amber and two levels toward magenta to specify that I 
wanted colors to be a tad warmer.
 
 If you’re familiar with traditional colored lens filters, you may know 
that the density of a filter, which determines the degree of color cor-
rection it provides, is measured in mireds (pronounced my-redds). The 

227
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
white balance grid is designed around this system: Moving the marker 
one level is the equivalent of adding a filter with a density of 5 mireds. 
 
4. Press OK to complete the adjustment.
After you adjust a White Balance setting, an asterisk appears next to that set-
ting in the White Balance menu. In the Control panel and Information display, 
you instead see a pair of triangles under the WB icon to indicate the adjust-
ment. (See Figure 6-33.)
 
If you want to apply a white balance shift on only the blue-to-amber axis, you 
don’t have to go through the Shooting menu. Instead, press and hold the WB 
button and then rotate the sub-command dial. You see the amount of adjust-
ment in the Control panel and Information display, as shown in Figure 6-33, 
while the button is pressed. An a value indicates a shift toward the amber 
direction; a b value, toward blue. For example, in the figure, the b5 value 
shows that I shifted the setting five steps toward blue (b). The two-triangle 
symbol reminding you of the adjustment also appears. Note that this trick 
isn’t available for the K (choose color temperature) or PRE (preset manual) 
White Balance settings.
Blue-amber shift amount
White-balance shift indicators
Figure 6-33: You can apply a shift along the blue/amber axis just by rotating the sub-command 
dial while pressing the WB button.

228
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Here’s one other tip specifically related to shifting white balance along the 
blue-to-amber axis: By using a feature called white balance bracketing, you 
can automatically record your picture with and without that shift. You can 
even record one picture with no shift, one with an amber shift, and one with 
a blue shift. See the later section “Bracketing white balance” for details.
Creating White Balance presets
 
If none of the standard White Balance settings do the trick and you don’t 
want to fool with fine-tuning them, take advantage of the PRE (Preset Manual) 
feature. This option enables you to do two things:
 
✓ Base white balance on a direct measurement of the actual lighting 
conditions.
 
✓ Match white balance to an existing photo. 
You can create and store up to five custom White Balance presets, which are 
assigned the names d-0 through d-4. The next two sections provide you with 
the step-by-step instructions; following that, you can find out how to select 
and manage your presets.
 
Be aware that any changes you make to a preset affect all Shooting menu 
banks. Chapter 10 explains Shooting menu and Custom Setting menu banks. If 
you create a direct-measurement preset in bank A, for example, and then try 
to create another one for bank B, you just wipe out the one for bank A. You 
don’t get a separate set of 5 presets for each bank, in other words.
Setting white balance with direct measurement
To use this technique, you need a piece of card stock that’s either neutral 
gray or absolute white — not eggshell white, sand white, or any other close-
but-not-perfect white. (You can buy reference cards made just for this pur-
pose in many camera stores for under $20.)
Position the reference card so that it receives the same lighting you’ll use for 
your photo. Then take these steps:
 
1. Frame your shot so that the reference card completely fills the 
viewfinder.
 
2. Check exposure and adjust settings if needed.
 
 This process doesn’t work if the picture will be over- or underexposed.
 
WB  
3. Press the WB button while rotating the main command dial to choose 
the PRE (Preset Manual) White Balance setting.

229
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
 You see the letters PRE in the white balance area of the Control panel as 
well as in the Information display.
 
4. Release the button and then immediately press and hold it again until 
the letters PRE begin flashing in the Control panel and viewfinder.
 
5. Release the WB button and take a picture of the gray card before the 
PRE warning stops flashing.
 
 You’ve got about six seconds to snap the picture.
 
 If the camera is successful at recording the white balance data, the let-
ters “Gd” flash in the viewfinder. In the Control panel, the word “Good” 
flashes. If you instead see the message “No Gd,” adjust your lighting and 
then try again.
 
When you create a preset this way, the camera automatically stores your set-
ting as Preset d-0. (The other presets are named d-1 through d-4.) So any time 
you want to select and use the preset, 
press the WB button and rotate the 
main command dial to select PRE, as in 
Step 3. Then rotate the sub-command 
dial while pressing the button to 
select d-0, as shown in Figure 6-34. 
(The Information display shows the 
same data when you press the WB 
button.) You also can select the preset 
through the White Balance option on 
the Shooting menu; see the upcoming 
section “Selecting a preset” for a few 
critical details on that method.
 
Each time you go through these steps, your d-0 preset is replaced by the new 
white balance data you record. However, you can preserve your original 
preset by copying it to one of the other preset slots. See the upcoming sec-
tion “Managing presets” for details on how to copy your preset as well as 
how to select it when you’re ready to shoot.
Matching white balance to an existing photo
Suppose that you’re the marketing manager for a small business, and one of 
your jobs is to shoot portraits of the company big-wigs for the annual report. 
You build a small studio just for that purpose, complete with a couple of pho-
tography lights and a nice, conservative, beige backdrop.
Of course, the big-wigs can’t all come to get their pictures taken in the same 
month, let alone on the same day. But you have to make sure that the colors 
in that beige backdrop remain consistent for each shot, no matter how much 
Preset number
Figure 6-34: Preset d-0 is always used for the 
most recent direct-measurement preset.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
time passes between photo sessions. This scenario is one possible use for an 
advanced white balance feature that enables you to base white balance on an 
existing photo.
 
Basing white balance on an existing photo works well only in strictly con-
trolled lighting situations, where the color temperature of your lights is con-
sistent from day to day. Otherwise, the White Balance setting that produces 
color accuracy when you shoot Big Boss Number One may add an ugly color 
cast to the one you snap of Big Boss Number Two.
To give this option a try, follow these steps:
 
1. Copy the picture that you want to use as the reference photo to your 
camera memory card, if it isn’t already stored there.
 
 You can copy the picture to the card using a card reader and whatever 
method you usually use to transfer files from one drive to another. 
Copy the file to the folder named DCIM, inside the main folder, named 
100D300s by default. (See Chapter 8 for help with working with files and 
folders.)
 
 If you’re using dual memory cards, you can put the reference photo on 
either card.
 
2. Open the Shooting menu, highlight White Balance, and press OK.
 
3. Select PRE (Preset Manual) and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 After you press the Multi Selector right, the screen shown on the left in 
Figure 6-35 appears. The five thumbnails represent the five preset slots, 
d-0 through d-4.
 
4.  Use the Multi Selector to highlight any preset except d-0.
 
 The d-0 preset is always used for White Balance settings you create 
by taking a picture of a reference card, as described in the preceding 
section.
Figure 6-35: Select Preset d-1 through d-4; d-0 is reserved for direct-measurement presets.

231
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
5. Press the Multi Selector center button.
 
 Now you see the menu shown on the right in Figure 6-35.
 
6. Highlight Select Image and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You see thumbnails of your photos. 
 
 
 To access a screen that enables you to switch to a different memory 
card or folder, press the Zoom Out button. Select your card and folder 
and press OK to display the thumbnails from that location.
 
7. Use the Multi Selector to move the yellow highlight box over the pic-
ture you want to use as your white balance photo.
 
8. Press the Multi Selector center button.
 
 You’re returned to the screen showing your White Balance preset 
thumbnails. The thumbnail for the photo you selected in Step 7 appears 
as the thumbnail for the preset slot you chose in Step 4. 
 
9. Press OK to travel to the white-balance fine-tuning screen.
 
 Make any adjustments to the setting that you see fit, as described in the 
earlier section “Fine-tuning White Balance settings.”
 
10. Press OK to return to the Shooting menu.
 
 The White Balance setting you just created is now selected.
Selecting a preset
After creating White Balance presets, select the one you want to use in 
two ways:
 
WB  
✓ Use the WB button together with the command dials. First, select PRE 
as the White Balance setting by pressing the WB button as you rotate 
the main command dial. Keep holding the button and rotate the sub-
command dial to cycle through the available presets (d-0 through d-4). 
The number of the selected preset appears in the Control panel and 
Information display while the button is pressed.
 
✓ Use the White Balance option on the Shooting menu. Open the Shooting 
menu, select White Balance, press OK, highlight PRE (Preset Manual) 
and press the Multi Selector right. You then see the screen that contains 
thumbnails for all your presets. (Refer to the left screen in Figure 6-35.) 
Use the Multi Selector to place the yellow highlight box over the preset 
you want to use and then press OK. You’re taken to the fine-tuning 
screen that appears any time you select a White Balance setting from the 
menu; press OK to exit the screen without adjusting the setting.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Managing presets
Just to recap this whole White Balance preset deal:
 
✓ You can create up to five presets, which take the names d-0 through d-4.
 
✓ Preset d-0 is always used for the most recent preset you created 
through the direct measurement method (where you take a photo of a 
reference card).
 
✓ Presets d-1 through d-4 can be assigned to presets based on photos.
 
✓ If you want to create more than one preset through direct measurement, 
you can copy the existing d-0 setting to one of the other four preset slots 
before doing another direct measurement. This feature is very handy if 
you regularly use different studio or lighting setups, by the way. You can 
create one direct-measurement preset for a home studio, for example, 
and another for a work studio.
 
✓ All five presets apply to all Shooting menu banks. And any changes that 
you make to a preset you created while working in one bank affect all 
other banks as well. Again, Chapter 10 discusses banks.
To copy Preset d-0 to another slot, take these steps:
 
1. Select the White Balance option on the Shooting menu and press OK.
 
2. Select PRE (Preset Manual) and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You see the thumbnails representing the five presets. For example, 
the left image in Figure 6-36 shows the d-0 position held by an existing 
direct-measurement preset and d-1 held by a preset based on a photo. 
Figure 6-36: To create an additional direct-measurement preset, first copy the existing one 
from d-0 to another slot (d1–d4).

233
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
 
3. Highlight the slot where you want to copy your d-0 preset.
 
 Use the Multi Selector to place the yellow highlight box around the slot. 
In the figure, I selected an empty slot (d-2), but you can also copy over 
an existing preset. (The preset that has the yellow label — d-1 in the 
figure — represents your current White Balance setting.)
 
4. Press the Multi Selector center button to display the menu shown on 
the right in the figure.
 
5. Highlight Copy d-0 and press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the preset thumbnails screen, and your original d-0 
preset now occupies both d-0 and the slot you selected in Step 3. You 
can now create your second direct-measurement preset, which will take 
over the d-0 position.
 
Finally, you also can add a brief text 
comment to describe each preset. For 
example, you might add the label 
“Studio A” to one preset and “Studio B” 
to another to help you remember 
which is which. The label then appears 
with the preset thumbnail, as shown in 
Figure 6-37. 
To enter a comment, take the exact 
same steps as you do to copy a 
preset, but instead of choosing Copy 
d-0 in Step 5, select Edit Comment 
and press the Multi Selector right. 
You then see a screen where you can 
enter your text. The specific text-entry steps are the same as you use for 
entering image comments, which I detail in Chapter 10, so I won’t repeat 
them here.
Bracketing white balance
Chapter 5 introduces you to your camera’s automatic bracketing feature, 
which enables you to easily record the same image at several different 
exposure settings. In addition to being able to bracket autoexposure, flash, 
and Active D-Lighting settings, you can use the feature to bracket white 
balance. 
Figure 6-37: Enter text labels that describe 
each preset.

234
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
Note a couple of things about this feature:
 
✓ You can bracket JPEG and TIFF shots only. You can’t use white bal-
ance bracketing if you set the camera’s Image Quality setting to either 
RAW (NEF) or any of the RAW+JPEG options. And frankly, there isn’t any 
need to do so because you can precisely tune colors of RAW files when 
you process them in your RAW converter. Chapter 8 has details on RAW 
processing.
 
✓ You take just one picture to record each bracketed series. Each time 
you press the shutter button, the camera records a single image and 
then makes the bracketed copies, each at a different White Balance set-
ting. One frame is always captured with no white-balance adjustment.
 
✓ You can apply white balance bracketing only along the blue-to-amber 
axis of the fine-tuning color grid. You can’t shift colors along the green-
to-magenta axis, as you can when tweaking a specific White Balance 
setting. (For a reminder of this feature, refer to the earlier section “Fine-
tuning White Balance settings.”)
 
✓ You can shift colors a maximum of three steps between frames. For 
those familiar with traditional lens filters, each step on the axis is equiv-
alent to a filter density of five mireds.
 
 However, by recording the maximum number of bracketed frames 
(nine), you can achieve a total adjustment of 12 steps from neutral. For 
example, if you set the frame count to 9 and set the amount of adjust-
ment to 3, you get your neutral, unadjusted shot plus four amber shots: 
one with a +3 amber bias, one with a +6 bias, one with a +9 bias, and one 
with a +12 bias. You also get four blue variations, each progressively 
more blue. (You can tell how much adjustment has been applied by 
looking at the White Balance data during playback or in Nikon ViewNX. 
For a +12 amber bias, for example, the readout will say A12. Chapter 4 
explains how to view shooting data during playback.) 
When you use white balance bracketing, you can request that the camera 
record the bracketed images so that they are progressively more blue or 
more amber. Or you can record one image that’s pushed toward blue and 
another that leans toward amber. Regardless, you also get one shot that’s 
“neutral” — that is, recorded at the current White Balance setting, without 
any adjustment.
I used white balance bracketing to record the three candle photos in Figure 
6-38. For the blue and amber versions, I set the bracketing to shift colors the 
full nine steps.
To apply white balance bracketing, you first need to take these steps:

235
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Neutral
Amber +12
Blue +12
Figure 6-38: I used white balance bracketing to record three variations on the subject.
 
1. Set the Image Quality setting to one of the JPEG options (Fine, 
Normal, or Basic) or TIFF.
 
QUAL  
 Chapter 3 explains all these options. To adjust the setting quickly, press 
the Qual button while rotating the main command dial.
 
2. Display the Custom Setting menu, select the Bracketing/Flash sub-
menu, and press OK.
 
3. Select Auto Bracketing Set, as shown on the left in Figure 6-39, and 
press OK.
 
 You see the screen shown on the right in the figure.
Figure 6-39: Your first step is to set the Auto Bracketing Set option to WB Bracketing.

236
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
4. Select WB Bracketing and press OK.
 
 The bracketing feature is now set up to adjust white balance between 
your bracketed shots.
From here on, bracketing works pretty much as detailed in the steps at the 
end of Chapter 5. Rather than repeating everything here, I’ll save some page 
space and provide just a quick summary of how to establish the bracketing 
settings.
 
✓ To set the number of frames and direction of the bracketing adjust-
ment: Press and hold the Fn (Function) button (right-front side of the 
camera) while rotating the main command dial. For white balance 
bracketing, the options are as follows: 
 
• b3F: Records three frames: one neutral, one shifted one increment 
toward blue, and a third shifted one additional increment toward 
blue.
 
• a3F: The same as b3F, but with the color adjustment toward the 
amber side of the scale. 
 
• b2F: Records two frames, one without any adjustment and one 
shifted toward blue.
 
• a2F: Again, you get two frames, but the second is shifted toward 
amber.
 
• 3F: This setting records three frames, with one neutral, one pushed 
toward amber, and one shifted toward blue.
 
• 5F: You get five frames: One neutral, two shifted toward amber, 
and two shifted toward blue.
 
• 7F: Along with one neutral shot, you get three amber variations 
and three blue variations.
 
• 9F: This setting gives you nine shots, one neutral, four amber, and 
four blue.
 
 Again, for the 5, 7, and 9 frame options, the increment of shift for 
the blue and amber variations is increased between shots.
  
• 0F: Select this setting to turn off bracketing.
 
✓ To set the amount of white-balance adjustment: Press the Fn button 
and rotate the sub-command dial. Again, you can set the bracketing 
amount to 1, 2, or 3.
While the Fn button is pressed, you can view both settings in the Control 
panel and Info display. When you release the button, you see the same BKT 
symbol and progress indicator that appears when you bracket exposure set-
tings. (Again, check out Chapter 5 for details.) 

237
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
After establishing the bracketing parameters, just shoot your bracketed 
frames. Remember, you press the shutter button just once, and the camera 
records the entire bracketed series. Bracketing remains in force until you dis-
able it (by setting the frame number to 0F). 
Choosing a Color Space: sRGB versus Adobe RGB
By default, your camera captures images using the sRGB color mode, which 
simply refers to an industry-standard spectrum of colors. (The s is for standard, 
and the RGB is for red-green-blue, which are the primary colors in the digital 
color world.) The sRGB color mode was created to help ensure color consis-
tency as an image moves from camera (or scanner) to monitor and printer; the 
idea was to create a spectrum of colors that all of these devices can reproduce.
However, the sRGB color spectrum leaves out some colors that can be repro-
duced in print and onscreen, at least by some devices. So as an alternative, 
your camera also enables you to shoot in the Adobe RGB color mode, which 
includes a larger spectrum (or gamut) of colors. Figure 6-40 offers an illustra-
tion of the two spectrums.
Visible Spectrum
Adobe RGB
sRGB
Figure 6-40: Adobe RGB includes some colors not found in the 
sRGB spectrum.

238
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Some colors in the Adobe RGB spectrum cannot be reproduced in print. (The 
printer just substitutes the closest printable color, if necessary.) Still, I usu-
ally shoot in Adobe RGB mode because I see no reason to limit myself to a 
smaller spectrum from the get-go.
However, just because I use Adobe RGB doesn’t mean that it’s right for you. 
First, if you plan to print and share your photos without making any adjust-
ments in your photo editor, you’re usually better off sticking with sRGB, 
because most printers and Web browsers are designed around that color 
space. Second, know that in order to retain all your original Adobe RGB 
colors when you work with your photos, your editing software must support 
that color space — not all programs do. You also must be willing to study the 
whole topic of digital color a little bit because you need to use some specific 
settings to avoid really mucking up the color works.
If you want to go with Adobe RGB instead of sRGB, you can make the change 
either via the Shooting menu, as shown on the left in Figure 6-41, or via the 
control strip at the bottom of the Info display, as shown on the right. To use 
the control strip, press the Info button twice and then use the Multi Selector 
to highlight the color-space option. Then press OK to access the screen 
where you can change the setting.
Figure 6-41: Choose Adobe RGB for a broader color spectrum.
 
You can tell whether you captured an image in the Adobe RGB format by 
looking at its filename: Adobe RGB images start with an underscore, as in 
_DSC0627.jpg. For pictures captured in the sRGB color space, the underscore 
appears in the middle of the filename, as in DSC_0627.jpg.

239
 Chapter 6: Manipulating Focus and Color
Taking a Quick Look at Picture Controls
A Nikon feature called Picture Controls offers one more way to tweak image 
sharpening, color, and contrast when you shoot in the JPEG or TIFF picture 
formats. You can select the Picture Control setting through the Shooting 
menu, as shown on the left in Figure 6-42, or through the control strip option 
shown on the right. (Remember, press Info twice to activate the strip, use the 
Multi Selector to highlight the option, and press OK to display the relevant 
menu screen.)
Figure 6-42: Picture Controls apply preset adjustments to color, sharpening, and other photo 
characteristics to images you shoot in the JPEG or TIFF file formats.
 
Sharpening, in case you’re new to the digital meaning of the term, refers to 
a software process that adjusts contrast in a way that creates the illusion of 
slightly sharper focus. I emphasize, “slightly sharper focus.” Sharpening pro-
duces a subtle tweak, and it’s not a fix for poor focus.
On the D300s, you can choose from four Picture Controls, which produce the 
following results:
 
✓ Standard: The default setting, this option captures the image normally — 
that is, using the characteristics that Nikon offers up as suitable for the 
majority of subjects.
 
✓ Neutral: At this setting, the camera doesn’t enhance color, contrast, and 
sharpening as much as in the other modes. The setting is designed for 
people who want to precisely manipulate these picture characteristics 
in a photo editor. By not overworking colors, sharpening, and so on 
when producing your original file, the camera delivers an original that 
gives you more latitude in the digital darkroom.

240
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Vivid: In this mode, the camera amps up color saturation, contrast, and 
sharpening.
 
✓ Monochrome: This setting produces black-and-white photos. Only in the 
digital world, they’re called grayscale images because a true black-and-
white image contains only black and white, with no shades of gray.
 
 I’m not keen on creating grayscale images this way. I prefer to shoot in 
full color and then do my own grayscale conversion in my photo editor. 
That technique just gives you more control over the look of your black-
and-white photos. Assuming that you work with a decent photo editor, 
you can control what original tones are emphasized in your grayscale 
version, for example. Additionally, keep in mind that you can always 
convert a color image to grayscale, but you can’t go the other direction. 
You can create a black-and-white copy of your color image right in the 
camera, in fact; Chapter 11 shows you how.
The extent to which Picture Controls affect your image depends on the sub-
ject as well as the exposure settings you choose and the lighting conditions. 
But Figure 6-43 gives you a general idea of what to expect. As you can see, the 
differences between the three color Picture Controls are pretty subtle.
Personally, I think that the Standard Picture Control works just fine, and I 
rarely use the others. And frankly, I suggest that you do the same. First off, 
you’ve got way more important camera settings to worry about — aperture, 
shutter speed, autofocus, and all the rest. Why add one more setting to your 
list, especially when the impact of changing it is minimal?
Second, if you really want to mess with the characteristics that the Picture 
Control options affect, you’re much better off shooting in the RAW (NEF) 
format and then making those adjustments on a picture-by-picture basis 
in your RAW converter. In Nikon ViewNX, you can even assign any of the 
existing Picture Controls to your RAW files and then compare how each one 
affects the image. The camera does tag your RAW file with whatever Picture 
Control is active at the time you take the shot, but the image adjustments are 
in no way set in stone, or even in sand — you can tweak your photo at will. 
(The selected Picture Control does affect the JPEG preview that’s used to dis-
play the RAW image thumbnails in ViewNX and other browsers.) 
For these reasons, I’m opting in this book to present you with just this brief 
introduction to Picture Controls so that I can go into more detail about func-
tions that I see as more useful (such as the white balance customization 
options presented earlier). But if you’re intrigued, know that you also can 
create your very own, customized Picture Controls and even save them to a

E
arlier chapters of this book break down each and every picture-taking 
feature on your D300s, describing in detail how the various controls 
affect exposure, picture quality, focus, color, and the like. This chapter pulls 
all that information together to help you set up your camera for specific 
types of photography.
The first section offers a quick summary of critical picture-
taking settings that should serve you well no matter what 
your subject. Following that, I offer my advice on which 
settings to use for portraits, action shots, landscapes, 
and close-ups.
Keep in mind that although I present specific rec-
ommendations here, there are no hard and fast 
rules as to the “right way” to shoot a portrait, a 
landscape, or whatever. So feel free to wander off 
on your own, tweaking this exposure setting or 
adjusting that focus control, to discover your own 
creative vision. Experimentation is part of the fun of 
photography, after all — and thanks to your camera 
monitor and the Delete button, it’s an easy, completely 
free proposition.

Recapping Basic Picture Settings
Your subject, creative goals, and lighting conditions determine which set-
tings you should use for some picture-taking options, such as aperture and 
shutter speed. I offer my take on those options throughout this chapter. But 
for many basic options, I recommend the same settings for almost every 
shooting scenario. Table 7-1 shows you those recommendations and also 
lists the chapter where you can find details about each setting.

Setting Up for Specific Scenes
For the most part, the settings detailed in the preceding section fall into the 
“set ’em and forget ’em” category. That leaves you free to concentrate on a 
handful of other camera options, such as aperture and shutter speed, that 
you can manipulate to achieve a specific photographic goal.
The next four sections explain which of these additional options typically pro-
duce the best results when you’re shooting portraits, action shots, landscapes, 
and close-ups. I offer a few compositional and creative tips along the way — 
but again, remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and for every 
so-called rule, there are plenty of great images that prove the exception.

 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
Shooting still portraits
By still portrait, I mean that your subject isn’t moving. For subjects who aren’t 
keen on sitting still long enough to have their picture taken — children, pets, 
and even some teenagers I know — skip ahead to the next section and use 
the techniques given for action photography instead.
Assuming that you do have a subject willing to pose, the classic portraiture 
approach is to keep the subject sharply focused while throwing the back-
ground into soft focus. This artistic choice emphasizes the subject and helps 
diminish the impact of any distracting background objects in cases where 
you can’t control the setting. The following steps show you how to achieve 
this look: 
 
1. Set the Mode dial to A (aperture-priority autoexposure) and select the 
lowest f-stop value possible.
 
 As Chapter 5 explains, a low f-stop setting opens the aperture, which not 
only allows more light to enter the camera but also shortens depth of 
field, or the range of sharp focus. So dialing in a low f-stop value is the 
first step in softening your portrait background. (The f-stop range avail-
able to you depends on your lens.) Also keep in mind that the farther 
your subject is from the background, the more blurring you can achieve. 
 
 I recommend aperture-priority mode when depth of field is a primary 
concern because you can control the f-stop while relying on the camera to 
select the shutter speed that will properly expose the image. Just rotate 
the sub-command dial to select your desired f-stop. (You do need to pay 
attention to shutter speed also, however, to make sure that it’s not so 
slow that any movement of the subject or camera will blur the image.) 
 
 Of course, if you’re more comfortable with manual exposure, you can 
use that mode and set both your aperture and shutter speed. Use the 
main command dial to set shutter speed.
 
 Whichever mode you choose, you can monitor the current f-stop and 
shutter speed on the Information display, Control panel, and in the view-
finder, as shown in Figure 7-1. 
 
2. To further soften the background, zoom in, get closer, or both. 
 
 As covered in Chapter 6, zooming in to a longer focal length also reduces 
depth of field, as does moving physically closer to your subject.
 
 A lens with a focal length of 85–120mm is ideal for a classic head and 
shoulders portrait. Avoid using a very short focal length (a wide-angle 
lens) for portraits. They can cause features to appear distorted — sort 
of like how people look when you view them through a security peep-
hole in a door.

246
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Aperture
Shutter speed
Figure 7-1: You can monitor aperture and shutter speed settings in three places.
 
3. For indoor portraits, shoot flash-free if possible.
 
 Shooting by available light 
rather than flash produces 
softer illumination and avoids 
the problem of red-eye. To get 
enough light to go flash-free, 
turn on room lights or, during 
daylight, pose your subject next 
to a sunny window, as I did for 
the image in Figure 7-2.
 
 If flash is unavoidable, see my 
list of flash tips at the end of the 
steps to get better results.
 
4. For outdoor portraits, use a 
flash if possible.
 
 Even in daylight, a flash adds a 
beneficial pop of light to sub-
jects’ faces. (The flash section 
of Chapter 5 has an example.)
 
 Just press the Flash button on 
the side of the camera to enable 
the built-in flash. For daytime 
portraits, use the Front-Curtain 
sync flash mode setting. (That’s 
Figure 7-2: For more pleasing indoor portraits, 
shoot by available light instead of using flash.

247
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
the regular, basic flash mode.) Remember that by default, the top shut-
ter speed for flash photography on the D300s is 1/250 second, so in 
bright light, you may need to stop down the aperture a little to avoid 
overexposing the photo. Doing so, of course, brings the background into 
sharper focus. So try to move the subject into a shaded area instead. 
You can also use the Flash Sync Speed option on the Custom Setting 
menu to increase the maximum shutter speed for flash photography; see 
Chapter 5 for details.
 
 For nighttime images, try red-eye reduction or slow-sync mode; again, 
see the flash tips at the end of these steps to use either mode most 
effectively.
 
5. For autofocusing, combine the Single Point AF-area mode with the S 
(single-servo) Focus mode.
 
 These autofocus settings are ideal for shooting still subjects. Chapter 6 
explains the exact focusing steps you need to take.
Again, these steps just give you a starting point for taking better portraits. A 
few other tips can also improve your people pics:
 
✓ Pay attention to the background. Scan the entire frame looking for 
intrusive objects that may distract the eye from the subject. If neces-
sary, reposition the subject against a more flattering backdrop. Inside, a 
softly textured wall works well; outdoors, trees and shrubs can provide 
nice backdrops as long as they aren’t so ornate or colorful that they 
diminish the subject (for example, a magnolia tree laden with blooms).
 
✓ Pay attention to white balance if your subject is lit by both flash and 
ambient light. Multiple light sources can confuse the camera when you 
use automatic white balancing. As a result, your colors may appear 
slightly warmer or cooler than they should. A slight warming effect typi-
cally looks nice in portraits, giving the skin a subtle glow. But if you need 
to eliminate a color cast, whether it’s toward the warm or cool side, see 
Chapter 6 to find out how to fine-tune white balance.
 
✓ When flash is unavoidable, try these tricks to produce better results. 
The following techniques can help solve flash-related issues:
 
• Indoors, turn on as many room lights as possible. With more ambient 
light, you reduce the flash power that’s needed to expose the pic-
ture. This step also causes the pupils to constrict, further reducing 
the chances of red-eye. (Pay heed to my white balance warning, 
however.) As an added benefit, the smaller pupil allows more of 
the subject’s iris to be visible in the portrait, so you see more eye 
color.

248
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
• Try setting the flash to red-eye reduction or slow-sync mode. If you 
choose the first option, warn your subject to expect both a prelimi-
nary pop of light from the AF-assist lamp, which constricts pupils, 
and the actual flash. And remember that slow-sync flash uses a 
slower-than-normal shutter speed, which produces softer lighting 
and brighter backgrounds than normal flash. You can set the flash 
mode to slow-sync in A and P modes. In the other modes, just use 
the normal (front-curtain sync) flash mode but select a slow shut-
ter speed to produce the same results.
 
 Take a look at Figure 7-3 for an example of how slow-sync flash 
can really improve an indoor portrait. When I used regular flash, 
the shutter speed was 1/60 second. At that speed, the camera has 
little time to soak up any ambient light. As a result, the scene is lit 
primarily by the flash. That caused two problems: The strong flash 
created some “hot spots” on the subject’s skin, and the window 
frame is much more prominent because of the contrast between it 
and the darker bushes outside the window. Although it was day-
light when I took the picture, the skies were overcast, so at 1/60 
second, the exteriors appear dark.
Regular fill flash, 1/60 second
Slow-sync flash, 1/4 second
Figure 7-3: Slow-sync flash results in softer, more even lighting and brighter backgrounds.

249
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
 In the slow-sync example, shot at 1/4 second, the exposure time was 
long enough to permit the ambient light to brighten the exteriors 
to the point that the window frame almost blends into the back-
ground. And because much less flash power was needed to expose 
the subject, the lighting is much more flattering. In this case, the 
bright background also helps to set the subject apart because of her 
dark hair and shirt. If the subject had been a pale blonde, this setup 
wouldn’t have worked as well, of course. And note the color shift 
that occurred due to the different mixes of flash and ambient 
lighting — in this case, the slow-sync example exhibited much 
warmer tones than the regular-flash example. Again, you can 
adjust white balance if the colors aren’t to your liking.
 
 Any time you use slow-sync flash, don’t forget that a slower-
than-normal shutter speed means an increased risk of blur due 
to camera shake. So always use a tripod or otherwise steady the 
camera. And remind your subject to stay absolutely still, too, 
because they will appear blurry if they move during the exposure. 
I was fortunate to have both my tripod and a cooperative subject 
for my examples, but I probably wouldn’t try slow-sync for portraits 
of young children or pets.
 
• For professional results, use an external flash with a rotating flash 
head. Then aim the flash head upward so that the flash light 
bounces off the ceiling and falls softly down onto the subject. An 
external flash isn’t cheap, but the results make the purchase worth-
while if you shoot lots of portraits. Compare the two portraits in 
Figure 7-4 for an illustration. In the first example, the built-in flash 
resulted in strong shadowing behind the subject and harsh, concen-
trated light. To produce the better result on the right, I used a Nikon 
Speedlight and bounced the light off the ceiling. 
 
 Make sure that the ceiling or other surface you use to bounce the 
light is white. Otherwise, the flash light will pick up the color of the 
surface and influence the color of your subject.
 
• To reduce shadowing from the flash, move your subject farther from the 
background. I took this extra step for the right image in Figure 7-4. 
The increased distance not only reduced shadowing but also softened 
the focus of the wall a bit (because of the short depth of field resulting 
from my f-stop and focal length).
 
 A good general rule is to position your subjects far enough from 
the background that they can’t touch it. If that isn’t possible, 
though, try going the other direction: If the person’s head is smack 
up against the background, any shadow will be smaller and less 
noticeable. For example, you get less shadowing when a subject’s 
head is resting against a sofa cushion than if that person is sitting 
upright, with the head a foot or so away from the cushion.

Part II: Taking Creative Control 
Figure 7-4: To eliminate harsh lighting and strong shadows (left), I used bounce flash 
and moved the subject farther from the background (right).
 
• Invest in a flash diffuser to further soften the light. Whether you use 
the built-in flash or an external flash, attaching a diffuser is also a 
good idea. A diffuser is simply a piece of translucent plastic or fabric 
that you place over the flash to soften and spread the light — much 
like sheer curtains diffuse window light. Diffusers come in lots of 
different designs, including small, fold-flat models that fit over the 
built-in flash.
 
✓ Frame the subject loosely to allow for later cropping to a variety of frame 
sizes. Your D300s produces images that have an aspect ratio of 3:2. That 
means that your portrait perfectly fits a 4-x-6-inch print size but will require 
cropping to print at any other proportions, such as 5 x 7 or 8 x 10. Chapter 9 
talks more about this issue.
Capturing action
A fast shutter speed is the key to capturing a blur-free shot of any moving 
subject, whether it’s a flower in the breeze, a spinning Ferris wheel, or, as in 
the case of Figure 7-5, a racing cyclist. 
Along with the basic capture settings outlined in Table 7-1, try the techniques 
in the following steps to photograph a subject in motion:

251
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
 
1. Set the Mode dial to S (shutter-
priority autoexposure).
 
 In this mode, you control the 
shutter speed, and the camera 
takes care of choosing an aper-
ture setting that will produce a 
good exposure. If you’re com-
fortable with handling both the 
shutter speed and f-stop duties, 
you may prefer to work in 
manual mode instead, however.
 
2. Rotate the main command dial 
to select the shutter speed.
 
 (Refer to Figure 7-1 to locate 
shutter speed in the viewfinder 
and Information display.) In 
shutter-priority autoexposure 
mode, the camera selects an 
aperture (f-stop) to match.
 
 What shutter speed do you 
need exactly? Well, it depends 
on the speed at which your sub-
ject is moving, so some experi-
mentation is needed. But generally speaking, 1/320 second should be 
plenty for all but the fastest subjects (race cars, boats, and so on). For 
very slow subjects, you can even go as low as 1/250 or 1/125 second. My 
subject in Figure 7-5 was zipping along at a pretty fast pace, so I set the 
shutter speed to 1/500 second just to be on the safe side.
 
3. Raise the ISO setting to produce a brighter exposure if needed.
 
 In dim lighting, you may not be able to get a good exposure without 
taking this step; the camera simply may not be able to open the 
aperture wide enough to accommodate a fast shutter speed. Raising 
the ISO does increase the possibility of noise, but a noisy shot is better 
than a blurry shot. 
 
4. For rapid-fire shooting, set the Release mode to one of the Continuous 
settings.
 
 By default, the Continuous Low setting enables you to capture as many 
as three frames per second with a single press of the shutter button. 
Continuous High bumps the frame rate up to seven frames per second. 
Chapter 2 provides a bit more detail on these options.
 
5. For autofocusing, set the AF-area mode to Dynamic Area and the Focus 
mode to C (continuous-servo autofocus).
 
 Chapter 6 provides details on how to set focus when using this pair of 
settings, which are geared to capturing action.
Figure 7-5: Use a high shutter speed to freeze 
motion.

252
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
6. For fastest shooting, switch to manual focusing.
 
 Manual focusing eliminates the time the camera needs to lock focus in 
autofocus mode. Chapter 1 shows you how to focus manually, if you 
need help.
 
7. Compose the subject to allow for movement across the frame.
 
 Frame your shot a little wider than you normally might so that you 
lessen the risk that your subject will move out of the frame before you 
record the image. You can always crop to a tighter composition later. 
(I used this approach for my cyclist image — the original shot includes 
a lot of background that I later cropped away.) It’s also a good idea to 
leave more room in front of the subject than behind it. This makes it 
obvious that your subject is going somewhere.
 
Using these techniques should give you a better chance of capturing any fast-
moving subject. But action-shooting strategies also are helpful for shooting 
candid portraits of kids and pets. Even if they aren’t currently running, leap-
ing, or otherwise cavorting, snapping a shot before they do move or change 
positions is often tough. So if an interaction or scene catches your eye, set 
your camera into action mode and then just fire off a series of shots as fast 
as you can.
Capturing scenic vistas
Providing specific capture settings for landscape photography is tricky 
because there’s no single best approach to capturing a beautiful stretch 
of countryside, a city skyline, or other vast subject. Take depth of field, 
for example: One person’s idea of a super cityscape might be to keep all 
buildings in the scene sharply focused. But another photographer might 
prefer to shoot the same scene so that a foreground building is sharply 
focused while the others are less so, thus drawing the eye to that first 
building.
That said, I can offer a few tips to help you photograph a landscape the way 
you see it:
 
✓ Shoot in M (manual) or aperture-priority autoexposure mode (A) so 
that you can control depth of field. In A mode, you control the f-stop 
and the camera sets the shutter speed. (Rotate the sub-command dial to 
set the f-stop.)
 
 If you want extreme depth of field, so that both near and distant objects 
are sharply focused, as in Figure 7-6, select a high f-stop value. I used 
an aperture of f/18 for this shot. For short depth of field, use a low 
value. 

253
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
Figure 7-6: Use a high f-stop value to keep foreground and background sharply focused.
 
✓ If the exposure requires a slow 
shutter, use a tripod to avoid 
blurring. The downside to a high 
f-stop is that you need a slower 
shutter speed to produce a good 
exposure. If the shutter speed 
drops below what you can com-
fortably hand-hold, use a tripod 
to avoid picture-blurring camera 
shake. Remember that when you 
use a tripod, you may need to dis-
able Vibration Reduction, if your 
lens offers it; check your lens 
manual to be sure.
 
 No tripod handy? Look for any 
solid surface on which you can 
steady the camera. Of course, 
you can always increase the 
ISO Sensitivity setting to allow 
a faster shutter, too, but that 
option brings with it the chances 
of increased image noise. See 
Chapter 5 for details.
Figure 7-7: For misty waterfalls, use a slow 
shutter speed and a tripod.

254
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ For dramatic waterfall shots, consider using a slow shutter to create 
that “misty” look. The slow shutter blurs the water, giving it a soft, 
romantic appearance, as shown in Figure 7-7. Again, use a tripod to 
ensure that the rest of the scene doesn’t also blur due to camera shake. 
You can also use a slow shutter speed to capture dramatic 
photographs of waves coming ashore.
 
 In very bright light, you may need to place a neutral density filter over 
the lens; the filter reduces the light that can enter the lens, enabling you 
to use a slow shutter without overexposing the photo. Most camera 
stores carry these filters. 
 
✓ At sunrise or sunset, base exposure on the sky. The foreground will 
be dark, but you can usually brighten it in a photo editor if needed. If 
you base exposure on the foreground, on the other hand, the sky will 
become so bright that all the color will be washed out — a problem 
you usually can’t fix after the fact.
 
 Also experiment with different levels of 
Active D-Lighting adjustment. Chapter 
5 explains this feature, which brightens 
dark areas in a way that doesn’t blow 
out highlights, leaving your sky colors 
intact. 
 
✓ For cool nighttime city pics, experi-
ment with slow shutter. Assuming 
that cars or other vehicles are moving 
through the scene, the result is neon 
trails of light like those you see in the 
foreground of the image in Figure 7-10. 
Shutter speed for this image was about 
10 seconds.
 
✓ In tricky light, bracket exposures. 
Bracketing simply means to take the 
same picture at several different expo-
sures to increase the odds that at least 
one of them will capture the scene the 
way you envision. Bracketing is espe-
cially a good idea in difficult lighting 
situations such as sunrise and sunset. 
See the end of Chapter 5 to find out 
how to use your camera’s automatic 
bracketing feature.
Figure 7-8: A slow shutter also creates 
neon light trails in city-street scenes.

255
 Chapter 7: Putting It All Together
Capturing dynamic 
close-ups
For great close-up shots, try these 
techniques:
 
✓ Check your owner’s manual to 
find out the minimum close-
focusing distance of your lens. 
How “up close and personal” 
you can get to your subject 
depends on your lens, not the 
camera body itself. 
 
✓ Take control over depth of 
field by setting the camera 
mode to M (manual exposure) 
or A (aperture-priority auto-
exposure) mode. Whether you 
want a shallow, medium, or 
extreme depth of field depends 
on the point of your photo. In 
classic nature photography, 
for example, the artistic tradi-
tion is a very shallow depth of 
field, as shown in Figure 7-9, and 
requires an open aperture (low 
f-stop value). But if you want the 
viewer to be able to clearly see all details throughout the frame — for 
example, if you’re shooting a product shot for your company’s sales 
catalog — you need to go the other direction, stopping down the aper-
ture as far as possible.
 
✓ Remember that zooming in and getting close to your subject both 
decrease depth of field. So back to that product shot: If you need 
depth of field beyond what you can achieve with the aperture setting, 
you may need to back away, zoom out, or both. (You can always crop 
your image to show just the parts of the subject that you want to 
feature.)
 
✓ When shooting flowers and other nature scenes outdoors, pay atten-
tion to shutter speed, too. Even a slight breeze may cause your subject 
to move, causing blurring at slow shutter speeds. 
Figure 7-9: Shallow depth of field is a classic 
technique for close-up floral images.

256
Part II: Taking Creative Control 
 
✓ Use flash for better outdoor lighting. Just as with portraits, a tiny bit 
of flash typically improves close-ups when the sun is your primary light 
source. Again, though, keep in mind that the default maximum shutter 
speed possible when you use the built-in flash is 1/250 second, which 
may mean that you have to use a small aperture in bright light. See the 
flash section of Chapter 5 for details about this issue.
 
✓ When shooting indoors, try not to use flash as your primary light 
source. Because you’ll be shooting at close range, the light from your 
flash may be too harsh even at a low Flash Compensation setting. If flash 
is inevitable, turn on as many room lights as possible to reduce the 
flash power that’s needed — even a hardware-store shop light can do in 
a pinch as a lighting source. (Remember that if you have multiple light 
sources, though, you may need to tweak the white balance setting.)
 
✓ To really get close to your sub-
ject, invest in a macro lens or 
a set of diopters. A true macro 
lens, which enables you to get 
really, really close to your sub-
jects, is an expensive proposi-
tion; expect to pay around $200 
or more. But if you enjoy cap-
turing the tiny details in life, it’s 
worth the investment. 
 
 For a less expensive way to 
go, you can spend about $40 
for a set of diopters, which are 
sort of like reading glasses that 
you screw onto your existing 
lens. Diopters come in several 
strengths — +1, +2, + 4, and so 
on — with a higher number 
indicating a greater magnifying 
power. I took this approach to 
capture the extreme close-up in 
Figure 7-10, attaching a +2 diop-
ter to my lens. The downfall of 
diopters, sadly, is that they typi-
cally produce images that are 
very soft around the edges, a 
problem that doesn’t occur with 
a good macro lens.
Figure 7-10: To extend your lens’ close-focus 
ability, you can add magnifying diopters.

Working with 
Picture Files

In this part . . .
You’ve got a memory card full of pictures and 
movie ﬁ les. Now what? Turn to the ﬁ rst chap-

ﬁ les out of your camera and onto your computer. 
The same chapter also talks about processing 
photos that you capture in the NEF (RAW) ﬁ le

Archiving Your Picture Files
In This Chapter
▶ Transferring pictures to your computer
▶ Using Nikon Transfer and ViewNX to download and organize photos
▶ Processing NEF (RAW) files
▶ Copying pictures between memory cards
▶ Keeping your picture files safe from harm
F
or many novice digital photographers (and even some experienced 
ones), the task of moving pictures to the computer and then 
keeping track of all of those image files is one of the more con-
fusing aspects of the art form. And frankly, writing about 
the downloading and organizing process isn’t all that 
easy, either. I know, I know — would I like some whine 
with that cheese? But the truth is, providing you 
with detailed instructions is pretty much impossible 
because the steps vary widely depending on what 
software you have installed on your computer and 
which computer operating system you use.
To give you as much help as I can, however, this 
chapter shows you how to transfer and organize pic-
tures using the free Nikon software that came in your 
camera box. After exploring these discussions, you 
should be able to adapt the steps to any other photo pro-
gram you may prefer. This chapter also covers a few other 
aspects of handling your picture files, including converting pic-
tures taken in the NEF (RAW) format to a standard image format.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
One note before you dig in: Most figures in this chapter and elsewhere fea-
ture the Windows Vista operating system. If you use some other version of 
Windows or another operating system, what you see on your screen may 
look slightly different but should contain the same basic options unless I 
specify otherwise.
Sending Pictures to the Computer
You can take two approaches to moving pictures from your camera memory 
card to your computer:
 
✓ Connect the camera directly to 
the computer. For this option, you 
need to dig out the USB cable that 
came in your camera box. Your 
computer must also have an open 
USB slot, or port, in techie talk. If 
you’re not sure what these gad-
gets look like, Figure 8-1 gives you 
a look. The little three-pronged 
icon, labeled in Figure 8-1, is the 
universal symbol for USB.
 
✓ Transfer images using a memory 
card reader. Many computers 
now also have slots that accept 
common types of memory cards. 
If so, you can simply pop the card 
out of your camera and into the 
card slot instead of hooking the 
camera up to the computer.
 
 As another option, you can buy stand-alone 
card readers such as the SanDisk model 
shown in Figure 8-2. This particular model 
accepts a variety of memory cards, includ-
ing those used by your D300s. Check your 
printer, too; many printers now have card 
slots that serve the purpose of a card reader. 
If not, you don’t have to spend much to buy 
a reader — they cost anywhere from about 
$10 to $35, depending on how many different 
types of cards they accept.

261
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
I prefer to use a card reader because to transfer via the camera, the camera 
must be turned on during the process, wasting battery power. If you want to 
transfer directly from the camera, however, the next section explains some 
important steps you need to take to make that option work. For help using a 
card reader, skip ahead to “Starting the transfer process” to get an overview 
of what happens after you insert the card into the reader.
Connecting the camera and computer
 
You need to follow a specific set of steps when connecting the camera to 
your computer. Otherwise, you can damage the camera or the memory card.
Also note that in order for your camera to communicate with the computer, 
Nikon suggests that your computer be running Windows Vista, Windows XP, 
or the Mac operating system. Check the Nikon Web site (www.nikon.com) for 
a complete list of the compatible versions of each OS (operating systems). For 
example, Nikon recommends that Vista users have Service Pack 1 installed.
Also check the Nikon support pages if you use another OS for the latest news 
about any updates to system compatibility. You can always simply transfer 
images with a card reader, too.
With that preamble out of the way, here are 
the steps to link your computer and camera:
 
1. Check the level of the camera battery.
 
 If the battery is low, charge it before 
continuing. Running out of battery 
power during the transfer process can 
cause problems, including lost picture 
data. Alternatively, if you purchased the 
optional AC adapter, use that to power 
the camera during picture transfers.
 
2. Turn on the computer and give it time 
to finish its normal startup routine.
 
3. Turn the camera off.
 
4. Insert the smaller of the two plugs on 
the USB cable into the USB port on the 
side of the camera.
 
 Look under the little rubber door on 
the left side of the camera, as shown in 
Figure 8-3, for this port.
Figure 8-3: The USB slot is hidden 
under the rubber door on the left 
side of the camera.

262
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
5. Plug the other end of the cable into the computer’s USB port.
 
 If possible, plug the cable into a port that’s built in to the computer, as 
opposed to one that’s on your keyboard or part of an external USB hub. 
Those accessory-type connections can sometimes foul up the transfer 
process.
 
6. Turn the camera on.
 
 What happens now depends on your computer operating system and what 
photo software you have installed on that system. The next section explains 
the possibilities and how to proceed with the image transfer process.
 
7. When the download is complete, turn off the camera and then discon-
nect it from the computer.
 
 I repeat: Turn off the camera before severing its ties with the computer. 
Otherwise, you can damage the camera.
Starting the transfer process
After you connect the camera to the computer (be sure to carefully follow 
the steps in the preceding section) or insert a memory card into your card 
reader, your next step depends, again, on the software installed on your com-
puter and the computer operating system.
Here are the most common possibilities 
and how to move forward:
 
✓ On a Windows-based computer, 
a Windows message box similar 
to the one in Figure 8-4 appears. 
The dialog box suggests differ-
ent programs that you can use to 
download your picture files. Which 
programs appear depend on what 
you have installed on your system; 
if you installed Nikon Transfer, for 
example, it should appear in the 
program list, as in the figure. In 
Windows Vista, just click the trans-
fer program that you want to use. 
In other versions of Windows, the 
dialog box may sport an OK button; 
if so, click that button to proceed.
 
✓ An installed photo program auto-
matically displays a photo-down-
load wizard. For example, the Nikon 
Transfer downloader or a down-
loader associated with some other 
Figure 8-4: Windows may display this 
initial boxful of transfer options.

263
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
photo software may leap to the forefront. Usually, the downloader that 
appears is associated with the software that you most recently installed. 
Each new program that you add to your system tries to wrestle control 
over your image downloads away from the previous program.
 
 If you don’t want a program’s auto downloader to launch whenever you 
insert a memory card or connect your camera, you should be able to 
turn that feature off. Check the software manual to find out how to dis-
able the auto launch.
 
✓ Nothing happens. Don’t panic; assuming that your card reader or camera 
is properly connected, all is probably well. Someone simply may have 
disabled all the automatic downloaders on your system. Just launch your 
photo software and then transfer your pictures using whatever command 
starts that process. (I show you how to do it with Nikon Transfer later in 
the chapter; for other programs, consult the software manual.)
 
 As another option, if you work on a PC, you can use Windows Explorer 
to drag and drop files from your memory card to your computer’s hard 
drive. Whether you connect the card through a card reader or attach 
the camera directly, the computer sees the card or camera as just 
another removable storage drive on the system. So the process of trans-
ferring files is exactly the same as when you move any other file from a 
CD, DVD, or other storage device onto your hard drive. If you have two 
memory cards in the camera, each will show up as a separate removable 
drive under the main camera drive (which should be named D300s). Mac 
users also can drag and drop picture files through the Finder, but only 
when downloading via a card reader.
In the next sections, I provide details on using Nikon Transfer to download 
your files and Nikon ViewNX to view and organize your pictures. Remember, 
if you use some other software, the concepts are the same, but check your 
program manual to get the small details. In most programs, you also can find 
lots of information by simply clicking open the Help menu.
Downloading and Organizing Photos 
with the Nikon Software
Remember unpacking your camera box when you first brought home your 
D300s? Did you notice a CD-ROM called Nikon Software Suite? If you haven’t 
already done so, dig out that CD and pop it into your computer’s CD drive. 
Then install the following two programs:
 
✓ Nikon Transfer: This program assists you with the process of transfer-
ring pictures from your camera or memory card to the computer.
 
✓ Nikon ViewNX: After downloading your files, you can view and organize 
your picture files using this program. You also can print and e-mail your 
photos from ViewNX.

264
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
Note that this book features Nikon Transfer version 1.5.1 and Nikon ViewNX 
version 1.5, which were the most current at the time of publication. If you 
own an earlier version of these programs, visit the Nikon Web site to install 
the updates. (To find out what version you have installed, open the program. 
Then, in Windows, choose Help➪About. On a Mac, choose the About com-
mand from the Nikon Transfer or Nikon ViewNX menu.)
The next several sections give you the most basic of introductions to using 
Nikon Transfer and ViewNX. If you want more details, just look in the Help 
system built in to the programs. (Click the Help menu to access the system.)
 
Before you move on, though, I want to clear up one common point of confu-
sion: You can use the Nikon software to download and organize your photos 
and still use any photo editing software you prefer. And to do your editing, 
you don’t need to re-download photos — after you transfer photos to your 
computer, you can access them from any program, just as you can any file that 
you put on your system. In fact, for most photo editing programs, you can set 
things up so that you can select a photo in ViewNX and then open that picture 
in your chosen photo editor with a click or two. (With some programs, you 
must first take the step of importing the photo files, which enables the program 
to build thumbnails and, in some cases, working copies of your pictures.) 
You can find details in the ViewNX Help system (open the program and then 
choose Help➪ViewNX Help); look for the section called “Setting Up ViewNX.”
Downloading with Nikon Transfer
The following steps explain how to download new pictures to your computer 
using Nikon Transfer:
 
1. Attach your camera or insert a memory card into your card reader, as 
outlined in the first part of this chapter.
 
 Depending on what software you have installed on your system, you 
may see the initial Nikon Transfer window, as shown in Figure 8-5. Or, in 
Windows, you may see a dialog box similar to the one shown in Figure 
8-4. In that case, click the item that has the Nikon Transfer logo, as 
shown in Figure 8-4.
 
 If nothing happens, start Nikon Transfer by using the same process you 
use to launch any program on your computer. (If some other photo soft-
ware pops up, close it first.)
 
2. Display the Source tab to view thumbnails of your pictures, as shown 
in the figure.
 
 Don’t see any tabs? Click the little Options triangle, located near the 
top-left corner of the window and labeled in Figure 8-5, to display them. 
Then click the Source tab. The icon representing your camera should be 
selected, as shown in the figure. If not, click the icon. The dialog box then 

265
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
displays thumbnails of your images. If you don’t see the thumbnails, click 
the arrow labeled in Figure 8-5 to expand the dialog box and open the 
thumbnails area.
 
 If you have two memory cards in the camera, click the little black trian-
gle at the bottom-right corner of the camera icon, as shown in Figure 8-5. 
You can then choose which card you want the downloader to access.
 
3. Select the images that you want to download.
 
 A check mark in the little box under a thumbnail tells the program that 
you want to download the image. Click the box to toggle the check mark 
on and off.
 
 If you used the in-camera functions to protect pictures (see Chapter 4), you 
can select just those images by clicking the Select Protected icon, labeled in 
Figure 8-5. To select all images on the card, click the Select All icon instead.

4. Click the Primary Destination tab at the top of the window.
 
 When you click the tab, the top of the transfer window offers options 
that enable you to specify where and how you want the images to be 
stored on your computer. Figure 8-6 offers a look. 
Choose storage folder
Figure 8-6: Specify the folder where you want to put the downloaded images.
 
5. Choose the folder where you want to store the images from the 
Primary Destination Folder drop-down list.
 
 The list is labeled in Figure 8-6. If the folder you want to use isn’t in the 
list, open the drop-down list, choose Browse from the bottom of the list, 
and then track down the folder and select it.
 
 By default, the program puts images in a folder titled Nikon Transfer, 
which is housed inside a folder named My Pictures in Windows XP and 
Pictures in Windows Vista and on a Mac. That My Pictures or Pictures 
folder is housed inside a folder that your system creates automatically 
for each registered user of the computer.
 
 You don’t have to stick with this default location — you can put your 
pictures anywhere you please. But because most photo programs auto-
matically look for pictures in these standard folders, putting your pic-
tures there just simplifies things a little down the road. Note: You can 
always move your pictures into other folders after you download them if 
needed, too. The upcoming section “Organizing pictures” explains how 
to do so in Nikon ViewNX.
 
6. Specify whether you want the pictures to be placed inside a new 
subfolder.
 
 If you select the Create Subfolder for Each Transfer option, the program 
creates a new folder inside the storage folder you selected in Step 5. Then 
it puts all the pictures from the current download session into that new 

267
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
subfolder. You can either use the numerical subfolder name the program 
suggests or click the Edit button to set up your own naming system. 
 
7. Tell the program whether you want to rename the picture files during 
the download process.
 
 If you do, select the Rename Photos During Transfer check box. Then 
click the Edit button to display a dialog box where you can set up your 
new filenaming scheme. Click OK after you do so to close the dialog box.
 
8. Click the Preferences tab to set the rest of the transfer options.
 
 Now the tab shown in Figure 8-7 takes over the top of the program 
window. Here you find a number of options that enable you to control 
how the program operates. Most of the options are self-explanatory, but 
a couple warrant a few words of advice:
 
• Launch Automatically When Device Is Attached. Deselect this check 
box if you don’t want Nikon Transfer to start every time you connect 
your camera to your computer or insert a memory card into your 
card reader.
Turn this off!
Figure 8-7: Control other aspects of the program’s behavior via the Preferences tab.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
• Transfer New Photos Only. This option, when selected, ensures 
that you don’t waste time downloading images that you’ve already 
transferred but are still on the memory card.
 
• Delete Original Files After Transfer. Turn this option off, as shown in 
Figure 8-7. Otherwise, your pictures are automatically erased from 
your memory card when the transfer is complete. You should always 
check to make sure the pictures really made it to the computer before 
you delete them from your memory card. (See Chapter 4 to find out 
how to use the Delete function on your camera.)
 
• Open Destination Folder with Other Application After Transfer. By 
default, Nikon Transfer shuts itself down when the file download 
is complete, and Nikon ViewNX then starts automatically so that 
you can view and organize your images. (That’s assuming that you 
installed ViewNX, of course.) If you want to use a program other 
than ViewNX for that task, open the drop-down list, click Browse, 
and select the program from the dialog box that appears. Click OK 
after doing so. And if you don’t want Nikon Transfer to close after 
downloading, uncheck the Quit Nikon Transfer Automatically After 
Transfer option.
 
 Your choices remain in force for any subsequent download sessions, so 
you don’t have to revisit this tab unless you want the program to behave 
differently.
 
9. When you’re ready to start the download, click the Start Transfer button.
 
 It’s located in the lower-right corner of the program window. (Refer to 
Figure 8-5.) After you click the button, the Process bar in the lower-left 
corner indicates how the transfer is progressing. Again, what happens 
when the transfer completely depends on the choices you made in Step 
8; by default, Nikon Transfer closes, and ViewNX opens, automatically 
displaying the folder that contains your just-downloaded images.
Browsing images in Nikon ViewNX
Nikon ViewNX is designed to do exactly what its name suggests: enable you 
to view and organize the pictures that you shoot with your D300s. You also 
can view other photos — pictures you scanned, received from friends via 
e-mail, or took with a different camera, for example. The only requirement is 
that the file format is one that ViewNX can read; for still photos, that means 
JPEG, TIFF, or NEF, which is the Nikon flavor of Camera Raw. (Chapter 3 
explains file formats.) For a complete rundown of supported file formats, 
check the Appendix section of the built-in program Help system.
Figure 8-8 offers a look at the ViewNX window as it appears by default in 
Windows Vista. The Mac version is nearly identical, although it features the 
usual Mac look and feel instead of the Microsoft Windows design.

Folders tab
Figure 8-8: You can browse and organize your photos using Nikon ViewNX.
 
On either type of system, you can customize a variety of aspects of the 
window layout by using the options on the View and Window menus.
To start viewing your pictures, first display the Folders tab along the left side of 
the program window, as shown in Figure 8-8. (Just click the tab, labeled in the 
figure.) Now open the folder that holds the photos you want to view. If you came 
to ViewNX directly after downloading pictures via Nikon Transfer, the folder 
that holds the new images may already be selected for you. Thumbnails of those 
images then appear on the right side of the program window. 
 
By opening the View menu, you can choose from the following viewing 
options:
 
✓ Thumbnail View: This is the default layout. For this view, you can 
choose from two thumbnail display styles. If you select Thumbnail 
Grid from the View menu, your screen appears as shown in Figure 8-8. 
You can adjust the size of the thumbnails by dragging the Zoom slider, 
labeled in the figure. If you prefer, you can instead select Thumbnail 
List, in which case you see thumbnails with information such as the file-
names, the dates the images were taken, file sizes, and so on.

270
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
✓ Image Viewer: Select this option from the View menu to display your 
files as shown in Figure 8-9. Small thumbnails appear along the top of the 
pane; the selected thumbnail appears in the larger preview area under-
neath. Use these maneuvers to inspect your images:
 
• To select an image file, click its thumbnail.
 
• Magnify or reduce the size of photo thumbnails and the preview by 
using the Zoom sliders labeled in Figure 8-9. 
 
• Drag in the large preview to scroll the display as needed to view 
hidden parts of a photo.
 
• To scroll through your files, click the little arrows under the large 
preview, labeled Previous Photo and Next Photo in the figure.

✓ Full Screen: Want to fill the entire screen with a photo? If you’re work-
ing in Thumbnail view (with or without all the data displayed), just 
double-click the picture thumbnail. In Image Viewer view, first click the 
thumbnail to display it in the large preview. Then double-click the large 
preview. Or, in either view, click the thumbnail and then press the letter 
F. Whichever way you go, your picture opens in a new viewer window, 
as shown in Figure 8-10. 
 
 In Full Screen view, as in the other views, you can magnify still photos 
by dragging the Zoom slider, as shown in the figure. To view additional 
photos at full-screen size, click the Previous and Next arrows under the

Viewing picture metadata
When you snap a photo with your D300s, the camera includes in the picture 
file some extra data that records all the critical camera settings that were 
in force. This data, known as metadata, also includes the capture date and 

272
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
time. And, if you take advantage of the Image Comment feature that I cover in 
Chapter 10, you can even store a brief bit of custom text, such as the shoot-
ing location or subject. 
 
Reviewing this data is a great way to better understand what settings work 
best for different types of pictures, especially when you’re just getting up to 
speed with aperture, shutter speed, white balance, and all the other digital 
photography basics. To get the full story on how each setting affects your 
pictures, see Chapters 5 and 6.
To view the metadata in ViewNX, first select an image by clicking its thumb-
nail in the ViewNX browser window. Then click the Metadata tab on the left 
side of the window or choose Window➪Metadata. The metadata information 
then comes to the forefront, as shown in Figure 8-11.
Metadata tab
Figure 8-11: Inspecting metadata is a great way to see what settings work best for different 
subjects and lighting conditions.

273
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
The metadata is divided into several sections of related capture settings: File 
Info 1, File Info 2, Camera Info, Exposure, and so on. To hide or display a sec-
tion, click the triangle next to it. You may need to use the scroll bar along the 
right side of the panel to view all the available information. Note that Nikon 
supplies ViewNX with cameras other than the D300s, and some categories of 
data apply only to those other models.
The XMP/IPTC Information part of the Metadata panel gives you access to the 
ViewNX keywords, tags, and rating functions. These functions, along with the 
program’s search feature, provide you with various tools that make locating 
specific pictures easier, including the option to search for pictures based on 
the shooting date.
 
In case you’re curious, IPTC refers to text data that press photographers are 
often required to tag onto their picture files, such as captions and copyright 
information. XMP refers to a data format developed by Adobe to enable 
that kind of data to be added to the file. IPTC stands for International Press 
Telecommunication Council; XMP stands for Extensible Metadata Platform.
Organizing pictures
When you download files from your camera using Nikon Transfer, you can 
specify where on your computer’s hard drive you want to store them. After 
you get the files on your system, you can further organize them in ViewNX. 
You can create new folders and subfolders, move images from one folder to 
another, rename and delete files, and more.
To begin organizing your files, first display the Folders tab on the left side 
of the program window, as shown in Figure 8-12. In this tab, you can see and 
manage the contents of all the drives and folders on your computer. From 
here, you can set up and rearrange your storage closet as follows:
 
✓ Hide/display the contents of a drive or folder. See a little plus sign 
(Windows) or right-pointing triangle (Mac) next to a drive or folder? 
Click it to display the contents of that storage bin. A minus sign 
(Windows) or a down-pointing triangle (Mac) means that the drive or 
folder is open; click that minus sign or triangle to close the drive or 
folder.
 
✓ Create a new folder. First, click the drive or folder where you want 
to house the new folder. For example, if you want to create it inside 
your Pictures or My Pictures folder, click it. Icons representing all the 
folders and files currently found within that folder then appear in the 
thumbnail area.
 
 Next, choose File➪New Folder. An icon representing the new folder 
should then appear, with the name box activated. Type the folder name 
and press Enter.

274
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 8-12: As on the camera, the key symbol indicates a protected picture.
 
✓ Move a file from one folder to another. First, display that file’s thumb-
nail in the browser. Then drag the thumbnail to the destination folder in 
the Folder pane.
 
✓ Delete a file. In Windows, click the thumbnail and then choose Edit➪
Delete or press the Delete key. On a Mac, choose Edit➪Move to Trash or 
press Ô+Delete. You then see a message asking you to confirm that you 
really want to trash the file. Click Yes to move forward.
 
✓ Protect or unlock photos. If you used the Protect feature on your 
camera to “lock” a file, a process you can explore in Chapter 4, you need 
to remove the protection if you want to edit the image in your photo 
software. To do so, choose File➪Protect Files➪Unprotect.
 
 You also can protect files in ViewNX; just choose Protect from the File➪
Protect Files submenu. A little key icon then appears on the thumbnail 
to remind you that the file is now protected from editing or erasing, as 
shown in Figure 8-12. If you later want to delete the file, you must first 
unprotect it.
 
✓ Select multiple files for moving, deleting, or other actions. Click the 
thumbnail of the first image and then Ctrl+click (Windows) or Ô+click 
(Mac) the rest. To select all images in the current folder, press Ctrl+A 
(Windows) or Ô+A (Mac.)

275
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
Processing RAW (NEF) Files
When you shoot in the RAW (NEF) format, introduced in Chapter 3, you must 
process and convert your picture files to a standard file format before you 
can share them online or print them from most programs other than Nikon 
ViewNX. You also can’t get prints from RAW files at most retail outlets or 
open the files in many photo editing programs.
To process your D300s NEF files, you have a couple of options:
 
✓ Use the in-camera processing feature. Through the Retouch menu, you 
can process your RAW images right in the camera. You can specify only 
limited image attributes (color, sharpness, and so on), and you can save 
the processed files only in the JPEG format, but still, having this option 
is a nice feature. See the next section for details.
 
✓ Process and convert in ViewNX. ViewNX also offers a RAW processing 
feature. Again, the controls for setting picture characteristics are a little 
limited, but you can save the adjusted files in either the JPEG or TIFF 
format. The last section of this chapter walks you through this option.
 
✓ Use Nikon Capture NX 2 or a third-party RAW conversion tool. For the 
most control over your RAW images, you need to open up your wallet 
and invest in a program that offers a truly capable converter. Nikon 
offers such a program, called Nikon Capture NX 2, which as of this writ-
ing sells for about $180. Figure 8-13 gives you a look at the Capture NX 2 
RAW converter window.
Figure 8-13: Nikon Capture NX 2 is one option for gaining more control over your RAW 
conversions.

276
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 Another (and less costly option) that I frequently recommend is Adobe 
Photoshop Elements, which sells for about $90 (www.adobe.com). It 
includes the Adobe Camera Raw converter, known in the industry as 
ACR, which is widely considered one of the best available. (Note: The 
converter in Elements doesn’t offer all the bells and whistles of the ver-
sion of ACR provided with Photoshop, however.) In addition, Elements 
is designed for the novice photo editing enthusiast, so it includes lots of 
helpful onscreen guides, whereas Capture NX 2 is geared more to the 
advanced digital photographer.
 
 If you do opt for a third-party conversion tool, check the program’s Help 
system for details on how to use the various controls, which vary from 
program to program.
Processing RAW images in the camera
Through the NEF (RAW) Processing option on the Retouch menu, you can 
process RAW files right in the camera — no computer or other software 
required. This feature is a great convenience, but I want to share a couple of 
reservations:
 
✓ First, you can save your processed files only in the JPEG format. As dis-
cussed in Chapter 3, that format results in some quality loss because 
of the file compression that JPEG applies. You can choose the level 
of JPEG compression you want to apply during RAW processing; you 
can create a JPEG Fine, Normal, or Basic file. Each of those settings 
produces the same quality that you get when you shoot new photos 
in the JPEG format and select Fine, Normal, or Basic from the Image 
Quality menu.
 
 Chapter 3 details the JPEG options, but, long story short, choose Fine 
for the best JPEG quality. And if you want to produce the absolute best 
quality from your RAW images, use a software solution and save your 
processed file in the TIFF format instead.
 
✓ You can make adjustments to exposure, color, and a few other options 
as part of the in-camera RAW conversion process. Evaluating the effects 
of your adjustments on the camera monitor can be difficult because of 
the size of the display compared to your computer monitor. So for really 
tricky images, you may want to forgo in-camera conversion and do the 
job on your computer, where you can get a better — and bigger — 
view of things. If you do go the in-camera route, make sure that the 
monitor brightness is set to its default position so that you aren’t 
misled by the display. (Chapter 1 shows you how to adjust monitor 
brightness.)

277
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
With those preliminaries out of the 
way, follow these steps to convert a 
RAW file:
 
1. Press the Playback button to 
switch to playback mode.
 
2. Display the picture you want to 
process in the single-image (full-
frame) view.
 
 If necessary, you can shift from 
thumbnails view to single-image 
view by just pressing the OK 
button. Chapter 4 has more play-
back details.
 
3. Press the OK button.
 
 The Retouch menu then appears atop your photo, as shown in 
Figure 8-14.
 
4. Choose NEF (RAW) Processing and press OK to display your process-
ing options, as shown in Figure 8-15.

5. Set the conversion options.
 
 Along the right side of the screen, you see a vertical column offering 
seven conversion options, which I labeled in Figure 8-15. To establish 
the setting for an option, use the Multi Selector to highlight it and then 
press the Multi Selector right. You then see the available settings for the 
option. Use the Multi Selector to highlight the setting you want to use 
and press OK to return to the main RAW conversion screen.
Figure 8-14: In single-image playback mode, 
press OK to display the Retouch menu over

278
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 Rather than detailing all the options here, the following list points you to 
the chapter where you can explore the settings available for each:
 
• Image Quality: See the Chapter 3 section related to the JPEG quality 
settings for details on this option.
 
• Image Size: The first part of Chapter 3 explains this one.
 
• White Balance: Check out Chapter 6 for details about White 
Balance options. After you select your main White Balance setting 
(Cloudy, Auto, and so on), you can press the Multi Selector right to 
fine-tune colors.
 
• Exposure Compensation: With this option, you can adjust image 
brightness by applying Exposure Compensation, a feature that I 
cover in Chapter 5.
 
• Picture Control: This option enables you to adjust color, contrast, 
and image sharpness. For a review of the available settings, see 
the last part of Chapter 6. As with White Balance, press the Multi 
Selector right after choosing a Picture Control to tweak its results. 
You can adjust sharpening, contrast, brightness, saturation, 
and hue.
 
• High ISO Noise Reduction: This filter attempts to soften the appear-
ance of noise that occurs when you use a very high ISO Sensitivity 
setting. Chapter 5 covers this filter as well as its companion, Long 
Exposure Noise Reduction.
 
• Color Space: See Chapter 6 for details on this option, which enables 
you to select one of two color spectrums, Adobe RGB or sRGB.
 
6. When you finish setting all the conversion options, highlight EXE on 
the main conversion screen. (Refer to Figure 8-15.) Then press OK.
 
 The camera records a JPEG copy of your RAW file and displays the copy 
in the monitor. 
 
Note that the filename of your JPEG copy doesn’t use the same numbering as 
the RAW original — the camera gives the file a new number that depends on 
the numbers of the existing JPEG files on your memory card.
Processing RAW files in ViewNX
In ViewNX, you can convert your RAW files to either the JPEG format or, for 
top picture quality, to the TIFF format. (See Chapter 3 if you’re unsure about 
the whole concept of file format and how it relates to picture quality.)
Although the ViewNX converter isn’t as full-featured as the ones in Nikon 
Capture NX 2, Adobe Photoshop, and some other photo editing programs, 
it does enable you to make some adjustments to your RAW images. Follow 
these steps to try it out.

279
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
1. Click the thumbnail of the NEF (RAW) image to select it.
 
 You may want to set the program to Image Viewer mode, as shown in 
Figure 8-16, so that you can see a larger preview of your image. Just 
choose View➪Image Viewer to switch to this display mode.
 
2. Display the Quick Adjustment tab by clicking its tab on the left side of 
the program window.
 
 I labeled the tab in Figure 8-16. The tab provides access to a few con-
trols for fine-tuning your image. You can adjust exposure compensation, 
white balance, and assign a Picture Control, for example. Each time you 
adjust a setting, the preview updates to show you the results.
Quick Adjustment tab
Figure 8-16: Display the Quick Adjustment tab to tweak RAW images before conversion.
 
 A couple of options may require some explanation:
 
• Launch Utility button: This button, located under the Picture 
Control option, opens the Picture Control Utility, where you can 
define your own Picture Controls. I don’t get into this advanced 
function in this book, but if you’re curious, open the utility and 
then click the Help button at the bottom of the window.
 
• Highlight Protection/Shadow Protection/D-Lighting HS: Try using 
these options to recover hidden shadow and highlight detail.

280
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
• Color Booster: This slider (at the bottom of the panel, not vis-
ible in Figure 8-16) enables you to increase saturation. But if you 
select the People button under the slider, skin tones are left alone. 
Choose Nature to adjust the saturation of all colors in the photo.
 
• Axial Color Aberration: Due to an optical phenomenon that’s too 
complex to fully explore here, some lenses can produce a defect 
known as axial color aberration or, in some circles, color fringing. 
This defect results in weird color halos along the edges of an object, 
typically on the side away from the center of the photo. To check 
your photo, zoom the display to a magnification of 200 percent or 
greater — the halos usually aren’t visible when the display size is 
small — and pay special attention to the corners of the photo, where 
the problem tends to be greatest. If you spot haloing, check the Auto 
box for the Axial Color Aberration setting and let the program try to 
apply the proper correction. You then can drag the slider to tweak 
the strength of the correction, if needed. (The program may need a 
few seconds to update the preview after each change, so be patient.)
 
 If you want more details about these or any other of the options, choose 
Help➪ViewNX Help to open the Help system, and then display the Help 
pages related to the Quick Adjustment tab.
 
3. Click the Save button at the bottom of the Quick Adjustment area.
 
 Or to revert to the original adjustment settings, click Reset.
 
4. To save the processed file, choose File➪Convert Files.
 
 Or just click the Convert Files button on the toolbar at the top of the 
program window. Either way, you see the Convert Files dialog box, 
shown in Figure 8-17.
 
5. Select TIFF (8 Bit) from the File Format drop-down list.
 
 You also can opt for TIFF (16 Bit) or JPEG, but I don’t recommend it. 
TIFF (16 Bit) can cause problems when you try to open the file in certain 
photo editing and organizing programs. (Most pro-level programs, such 
as Photoshop, do support 16-bit files, however.) And saving in the JPEG 
format applies lossy compression, thereby sacrificing some image qual-
ity. If you need a JPEG copy of your processed RAW image for online 
sharing, you can easily create one from your TIFF version by following 
the steps laid out in Chapter 9.
 
6. Deselect the Use LZW Compression option, as shown in the figure.
 
 Although LZW Compression reduces the file size somewhat and does 
not cause any quality loss, some programs can’t open files that were 
saved with this option enabled. So turn it off.
 
7. Deselect the Change the Image Size check box.
 
 This step ensures that you retain all the original pixels in your image, 
which gives you the most flexibility in terms of generating quality prints 
at large sizes. For details on this issue, check out Chapter 3.

281
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
Figure 8-17: You can specify where you want to store the 
processed ﬁ le.
 
8. Deselect each of the three Remove check boxes.
 
 If you select the check boxes, you strip image metadata — the extra text 
data that’s stored by the camera — from the file. Unless you have some 
specific reason to do so, clear all three check boxes so that you can con-
tinue to access the metadata when you view your processed image in 
programs that know how to display metadata.
 
 The first two check boxes relate to data that you can view on the 
Metadata tab in ViewNX; earlier sections of this chapter give you the low-
down. The ICC profile item refers to the image color space, which is either 
sRGB or Adobe RGB on your D300s. Chapter 6 explains the difference.
 
9. Select a storage location for the processed TIFF file.
 
 You do this in the Save In area of the dialog box, highlighted in Figure 
8-17. Select the top option to save your processed file in the same folder 
as the original RAW file. Or, to put the file in a different folder, click the 
Specified Folder button. The name of the currently selected alterna-
tive folder appears below the button, as shown in Figure 8-17. You can 
change the storage destination by clicking the Browse button (on the 
right side of the dialog box) and then selecting the drive and folder 
where you want to put the file.

282
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
 By selecting the Create a New Subfolder for Each File Conversion check 
box, you can put your TIFF file into a separate folder within the destina-
tion folder. If you select the box, click the Naming Options button and 
then specify how you want to name the subfolder.
 
10. Specify whether you want to give the processed TIFF a different file-
name from the original RAW image.
 
 To do so, select the Change File Names check box and then click the 
Naming Options button and enter the name you want to use. If you don’t 
change the filename, ViewNX gives the file the same name as the original 
RAW file.
 
11. Click the Convert button.
 
 A window appears to show you the progress of the conversion process. 
When the window disappears, your TIFF image appears in the storage 
location you selected in Step 10.
 
One neat thing about working with RAW images is that you can easily create 
as many variations of your photo as you want. For example, you might 
choose one set of options when processing your RAW file the first time, and 
then use an entirely different set to create another version of the photo. You 
could create one image in full color, perhaps, and then open the RAW file 
again — and this time select the Monochrome Picture Control to create a 
black-and-white version of the image.
Copying Pictures Between Memory Cards
In addition to being able to process RAW files right in the camera, you can 
perform another neat file-management trick without downloading to a com-
puter: When you have two memory cards installed, you can copy pictures 
from one card to the other. Follow these steps:
 
1. On the Playback menu, choose Copy Images, as shown on the left in 
Figure 8-18, and press OK.
 
 You see the right screen in the figure.
 
2. Highlight Select Source and press OK.
 
 You see a screen listing both memory cards (CF and SD).
 
3. Highlight the memory card that contains the pictures you want to 
copy and press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the main Copy Images screen.

283
 Chapter 8: Downloading, Organizing, and Archiving Your Picture Files
 
4. Highlight Select Images, as shown on the left in Figure 8-19, and 
press OK.
 
 You then see a screen listing all folders on the selected card, as shown 
on the right in Figure 8-19. If you haven’t created any custom folders, a 
topic covered in Chapter 10, you see just one folder, as in the figure.
Figure 8-18: You can copy cards from one installed memory card to another.
Figure 8-19: Select the folder that contains the pictures you want to copy.
 
5. Highlight the folder that contains your pictures and press OK.
 
 The camera now displays the screen shown on the left in Figure 8-20.
 
6. Choose an initial picture-selection option.
 
 Two of the options are pretty clear-cut: Choose Select All Images if you 
want to copy every picture on the card; choose Select Protected Images 
to copy just photos that you tagged with the Protect feature, covered in 
Chapter 4.

284
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 8-20: Press the Multi Selector center button to add or remove the checkmark that tags 
a picture for copying.
 
 The third option, Deselect All, is a little counterintuitive. Here’s the deal: 
The camera initially assumes that you want to copy every picture on the 
card, so it tries to help by automatically preselecting all of them in the 
background. You can later deselect the ones you don’t want to copy, but if 
you’re copying just a few pictures out of a large group, it’s faster to choose 
Deselect All so that you start out with no pictures selected. Then you don’t 
have to waste time “untagging” all the ones you don’t want to copy. 
 
7. Press OK to display thumbnails of your photos, as shown on the right 
in Figure 8-20.
 
 Checkmarks appear with any photos currently selected for copying, as 
shown in the figure. 
 
8. Press the center button of the Multi Selector to add or remove a photo 
from the selection.
 
 Pressing the button toggles the checkmark on and off. 
 
9. After selecting the photos you want to copy, press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the main Copy Images screen once more.
 
10. Choose Select Destination Folder and press OK.
 
 You see a screen offering two options: The first, Select Folder by 
Number, enables you to specify a three-digit folder number. (Press the 
Multi Selector left or right to highlight a value and press up or down

W
hen my first digital photography book was published, way back in the 
1990s, consumer digital cameras didn’t offer the resolution needed to 
produce good prints at anything more than postage-stamp size — and even 
then, the operative word was “good,” not “great.” And if you did want a print, 
it was pretty much a do-it-yourself proposition unless you paid sky-high 
prices at a professional imaging lab. In those days, retail photo labs didn’t 
offer digital printing, and online printing services hadn’t arrived 
yet, either.
Well, time and technology march on, and, at least in 
the case of digital photo printing, to a very good out-
come. Your D300s can produce dynamic prints even 
at large sizes, and getting those prints made is easy 
and economical, thanks to an abundance of digital 
printing services now in stores and online.
That said, getting the best output from your 
camera still requires a little bit of knowledge and 
prep work on your part. To that end, this chapter 
tells you exactly how to ensure that your picture files 
will look as good on paper as they do in your camera 
monitor.
In addition, this chapter explores ways to share your pictures 
electronically. First, I show you how to prepare your picture for e-mail — 
an important step if you don’t want to annoy friends and family by cluttering 
their inboxes with ginormous, too-large-to-view photos. Following that, you 
can find out how to create digital slide shows and view your pictures on a 
television.

Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Preventing Potential Printing Problems
Boy, I love a good alliteration, don’t you? Oh, just me, then. Anyway, as I say 
in the introduction to this chapter, a few issues can cause hiccups in the 
printing process. So before you print your photos, whether you want to do it 
on your own printer or send them to a retail lab, read through the next three 
sections, which show you how to avoid the most common trouble spots.
 
For times when you do want to print your photos on your own printer, 
you can do so through Nikon ViewNX. However, I find the ViewNX printing 
options both more complex and more limited than those in other programs, 
which is why I opted not to cover them in this book. I suggest that you 
instead print from whatever photo editing program you use or from the soft-
ware provided by your printer manufacturer.
Match resolution to print size
Resolution, or the number of pixels in your digital image, plays a huge role in 
how large you can print your photos and still maintain good picture quality. 
You can get the complete story on resolution in Chapter 3, but here’s a quick 
recap as it relates to printing:
 
✓ On the D300s, you set picture resolution (Large, Medium, or Small) via 
the Image Size option. (Again, see Chapter 3 for specifics.) You must 
select this option before you capture an image, which means that you 
need some idea of your ultimate print size before you shoot. And if you 
crop your image, you eliminate some pixels, so take that factor into 
account when you do the resolution math. 
 
✓ For good print quality, the minimum pixel count (in my experience, 
anyway) is 200 pixels per linear inch, or 200 ppi. That means that if you 
want a 4-x-6-inch print, you need at least 800 x 1200 pixels.
 
✓ Depending on your printer, you may get even better results at 200+ ppi. 
Some printers do their best work when fed 300 ppi, and a few (notably, 
some from Epson) request 360 ppi as the optimum resolution. However, 
going higher than that typically doesn’t produce any better prints.
 
 Unfortunately, because most printer manuals don’t bother to tell you 
what image resolution produces the best results, finding the right reso-
lution is a matter of experimentation. (Don’t confuse the manual’s state-
ments related to the printer’s dpi with ppi. DPI refers to how many dots 
of color the printer can lay down per inch; many printers use multiple 
dots to reproduce one image pixel.)
So what do you do if you find that you don’t have enough pixels for the print 
size you have in mind? You just have to decide what’s more important, print 
size or print quality.

287
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
If your print size does exceed your pixel supply, one of two things happens:
 
✓ The pixel count remains constant, and pixels simply grow in size to fill 
the requested print size. And if pixels get too large, you get a defect 
known as pixelation. The picture starts to appear jagged, or stairst-
epped, along curved or digital lines. Or at worst, your eye can actually 
make out the individual pixels, and your photo begins to look more like 
a mosaic than, well, a photograph.
 
✓ The pixel size remains constant, and the printer software adds pixels 
to fill in the gaps. You can also add pixels, or resample the image, in 
your photo software. Wherever it’s done, resampling doesn’t solve the 
low resolution problem. You’re asking the software to make up photo 
information out of thin air, and the result is usually an image that looks 
worse than it did before resampling. You don’t get pixelation, but details 
turn muddy, giving the image a blurry, poorly rendered appearance.
Just to hammer home the point and remind you one more time of the impact 
of resolution picture quality, Figures 9-1 through 9-3 show you the same 
image as it appears at 300 ppi (the resolution required by the publisher of 
this book), at 50 ppi, and resampled from 50 ppi to 300 ppi. As you can see, 
there’s just no way around the rule: If you want the best quality prints, you 
need the right pixel count.

 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
Allow for different print proportions
Unlike many digital cameras, your D300s produces photos that have an 
aspect ratio of 3:2. That is, pictures are 3 units wide by 2 units tall — just 
like a 35mm film negative — which means that they translate perfectly to 
the standard 4-x-6-inch print size. (Most digital cameras produce 4:3 images, 
which must be cropped to fit a 4-x-6-inch piece of paper.)
 
If you want to print your digital original at other standard sizes — 5 x 7, 8 x 10, 
11 x 14, and so on — you need to crop the photo to match those proportions. 
Alternatively, you can reduce the photo size slightly and leave an empty margin 
along the edges of the print as needed.
As a point of reference, Figure 9-4 shows you a 3:2 original image. The out-
lines indicate how much of the original can fit within a 5-x-7-inch frame and 
an 8-x-10-inch frame.
8 x 10
5 x 7
Figure 9-4: Composing your shots with a little head room enables you to crop to different 
frame sizes.

290
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Your camera’s Trim feature, found on the Retouch menu, enables you to crop 
your photo, but only to five different aspect ratios (3:2, 4:3, 5:4, 1:1, and 16:9). 
See Chapter 11 for information. For other proportions, most photo editing 
programs offer very simple cropping tools. You also can usually crop your 
photo using the software provided at online printing sites and at retail print 
kiosks. But if you plan to drop off your memory card of original pictures at 
a lab, be aware that your pictures will be cropped if you select a print size 
other than 4 x 6. 
 
To allow yourself printing flexibility, leave at least a little margin of back-
ground around your subject when you shoot, as shown in Figure 9-4. Then 
you don’t clip off the edges of the subject no matter what print size you 
choose. (Some people refer to this margin padding as head room, especially 
when describing portrait composition.)
Get print and monitor colors in synch
Your photo colors look perfect on your computer monitor. But when you 
print the picture, the image is too red, or too green, or has some other nasty 
color tint. This problem, which is probably the most prevalent printing issue, 
can occur because of any or all of the following factors:
 
✓ Your monitor needs to be calibrated. When print colors don’t match 
what you see on your computer monitor, the most likely culprit is 
actually the monitor, not the printer. If the monitor isn’t accurately 
calibrated, the colors it displays aren’t a true reflection of your image 
colors.
 
 To ensure that your monitor is displaying photos on a neutral canvas, you 
can start with a software-based calibration utility, which is just a small pro-
gram that guides you through the process of adjusting your monitor. The 
program displays various color swatches and other graphics and then asks 
you to provide feedback about what you see on the screen. Most calibra-
tion tools also help you analyze and adjust monitor brightness — a critical 
step if you want to be able to accurately gauge image exposure when you 
view your photos. (Newer monitors tend to be set to very high brightness 
levels by default, which is great for viewing Web pages and movies but can 
be misleading for photography work.)
 
 If you use a Mac, the operating system offers a built-in calibration utility, 
called the Display Calibrator Assistant; Figure 9-5 shows the welcome 
screen that appears when you run the program. (To access it, open the 
System Preferences dialog box, click the Displays icon, click the Color 
button, and then click the Calibrate button.) The latest incarnation of 
the Windows operating system, Windows 7, has a similar tool called 
Display Color Calibration. You also can find free calibration software for 
both Mac and Windows systems online; just enter the term free monitor 
calibration software into your favorite search engine.

291
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
Figure 9-5: Mac users can take advantage of this built-in calibration tool.
 
 Software-based calibration isn’t ideal, however, because our eyes aren’t 
that reliable in judging color accuracy. For a more accurate calibration, 
you may want to invest in a device known as a colorimeter, which you 
attach to or hang on your monitor, to accurately measure and calibrate 
your display. Companies such as Datacolor (www.datacolor.com), 
Pantone (www.pantone.com), and X-Rite (www.xrite.com) sell this type 
of product along with other tools for ensuring better color matching.
 
 Whichever route you go, the calibration process produces a monitor 
profile, which is simply a data file that tells your computer how to adjust 
the display to compensate for any monitor color casts. Your Windows or 
Mac operating system loads this file automatically when you start your 
computer. Your only responsibility is to perform the calibration every 
month or so, because monitor colors drift over time.
 
✓ One of your printer cartridges is empty or clogged. If your prints 
look great one day but are way off the next, the number-one suspect is 
an empty ink cartridge or a clogged print nozzle or head. Check your 
manual to find out how to perform the necessary maintenance to keep 
the nozzles or print heads in good shape.
 
 If black-and-white prints have a color tint, a logical assumption is that 
your black ink cartridge is to blame, if your printer has one. But the 
truth is that a printer that doesn’t use multiple black or gray cartridges 
will always have a slight color tint. Why? Because in order to create 
gray, the printer instead has to mix yellow, magenta, and cyan in per-
fectly equal amounts, and that’s a difficult feat for the typical inkjet 

292
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
printer to pull off. If your black-and-white prints have a strong color tint, 
however, it could be that one of your color cartridges is empty, and 
replacing it may help somewhat. Long story short: Unless you have a 
printer that’s marketed for producing good black-and-white prints, you’ll 
probably save yourself some grief by simply having your black-and-
whites printed at a retail lab.
 
 When you buy replacement ink, by the way, keep in mind that third-
party brands, while they may save you money, may not deliver the 
performance you get from the cartridges made by your printer manu-
facturer. A lot of science goes into getting ink formulas to mesh with the 
printer’s ink-delivery system, and the printer manufacturer obviously 
knows most about that delivery system.
 
✓ You chose the wrong paper setting in your printer software. When you 
set up your print job, be sure to select the right setting from the paper-
type option — glossy, matte, and so on. This setting affects how the 
printer lays down ink on the paper.
 
✓ Your photo paper is low quality. Sad but true: The cheap, store-brand 
photo papers usually don’t render colors as well as the higher-priced, 
name-brand papers. For best results, try papers from your printer manu-
facturer; again, those papers are engineered to provide top performance 
with the printer’s specific inks and ink-delivery system.
 
 Some paper manufacturers, especially those that sell fine-art papers, 
offer downloadable printer profiles, which are simply little bits of soft-
ware that tell your printer how to manage color for the paper. Refer to 
the manufacturer’s Web site for information on how to install and use 
the profiles. And note that a profile mismatch can also cause incorrect 
colors in your prints, including the color tint in black-and-white prints I 
alluded to earlier.
 
✓ Your printer and photo software are fighting over color-management 
duties. Some photo programs offer features that enable the user to con-
trol how colors are handled as an image passes from camera to monitor 
to printer. Most printer software also offers color-management features. 
The problem is, if you enable color-management controls both in your 
photo software and your printer software, you can create conflicts that 
lead to wacky colors. So check your photo software and printer manuals 
to find out what color-management options are available to you and how 
to turn them on and off.
 
Even if all the aforementioned issues are resolved, however, don’t expect perfect 
color matching between printer and monitor. Printers simply can’t reproduce 
the entire spectrum of colors that a monitor can display. In addition, monitor 
colors always appear brighter because they are, after all, generated with light.
Finally, be sure to evaluate your print colors and monitor colors in the same 
ambient light — daylight, office light, whatever — because that light source 
has its own influence on the colors you see.

293
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
Preparing Pictures for E-Mail
How many times have you received an e-mail message that looks like the one 
in Figure 9-6? Some well-meaning friend or relative has sent you a digital photo 
that is so large that it’s impossible to view the whole thing on your monitor.
The problem is that computer monitors can display only a limited number 
of pixels. The exact number depends on the monitor’s resolution setting and 
the capabilities of the computer’s video card, but suffice it to say that the 
average photo from one of today’s digital cameras has a pixel count in excess 
of what the monitor can handle.
DPOF, PictBridge, and computerless printing
Your D300s offers two technologies, called DPOF 
(dee-poff) and PictBridge, that enable you to print 
images directly from your camera or memory card, 
without using the computer as middle-machine. 
In order to take advantage of direct printing, your 
printer must also support one of the two technolo-
gies, and you must capture the images in the JPEG 
file format, which I explain in Chapter 3. (You can 
also capture the photo in the Raw format and then 
use your D300s’s in-camera conversion tool to 
make a JPEG copy suitable for direct printing.)
DPOF stands for Digital Print Order Format. 
With this option, accessed via the Print Set 
option on your camera’s Playback menu, you 
select the pictures on your memory card that 
you want to print, and you specify how many 
copies you want of each image. Then, if your 
photo printer has a memory card slot (SD or 
CompactFlash, depending on which type you 
use with your D300s) and supports DPOF, you 
just pop the memory card into that slot. The 
printer reads your “print order” and outputs just 
the requested copies of your selected images. 
(You use the printer’s own controls to set paper 
size, print orientation, and other print settings.)
PictBridge works a little differently. If you have a 
PictBridge-enabled photo printer, you can con-
nect the camera to the printer using the USB 
cable supplied with your camera. A PictBridge 
interface appears on the camera monitor, and 
you use the camera controls to select the pic-
tures you want to print. With PictBridge, you 
specify additional print options, such as page 
size and whether you want to print a border 
around the photo, from the camera as well.
Both DPOF and PictBridge are especially useful 
in scenarios where you need fast printing. For 
example, if you shoot pictures at a party and 
want to deliver prints to guests before they go 
home, DPOF offers a quicker option than firing 
up your computer, downloading pictures, and 
so on. And if you invest in one of the tiny por-
table photo printers on the market today, you 
can easily make prints away from your home or 
office — you can take both your portable printer 
and camera along to your regional sales meet-
ing, for example. 
For the record, I prefer DPOF to PictBridge 
because with PictBridge, you have to deal with 
cabling the printer and camera together. Also, 
the camera must be turned on for the whole 
printing process, wasting battery power. But 
if you’re interested in exploring either printing 
feature, your camera manual provides complete 
details.

294
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Figure 9-6: The attached image has too many pixels to be viewed without scrolling.
In general, a good rule is to limit a photo to no more than 640 pixels at its 
longest dimension. That ensures that people can view your entire picture 
without scrolling, as in Figure 9-7. This image measures 640 x 424 pixels. As 
you can see, it’s plenty large enough to provide a decent photo-viewing expe-
rience. On a small monitor, it may even be too large.
This size recommendation means that even if you shoot at your camera’s 
lowest Image Size setting (2144 x 1424 pixels), you need to dump pixels from 
your images before sending them to the cyber post office. You have a couple 
of options for creating an e-mail–sized image:
 
✓ Use the Resize feature on your camera’s Retouch menu. This feature 
enables you to create your e-mail copy right in the camera.
 
✓ Downsample the image in your photo editor. Downsampling is geekspeak 
for dumping pixels. Most photo editors offer a feature that handles this 
process for you. Use this option if you want to crop or otherwise edit 
the photo before sharing it.

295
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
Figure 9-7: Keep e-mail pictures to no larger than 640 pixels wide or tall.
The next two sections walk you through the steps for both methods of creat-
ing your e-mail images. You can use the same steps, by the way, for sizing 
images for any onscreen use, whether it’s for a Web page or multimedia pre-
sentation. You may want your copies to be larger or smaller than the recom-
mended e-mail size for those uses, however. 
 
One last point about onscreen images: Remember that pixel count has abso-
lutely no effect on the quality of pictures displayed onscreen. Pixel count 
determines only the size at which your images are displayed.
Creating small copies using the camera
To create small, e-mailable JPEG copies of your images without using a com-
puter, take advantage of your camera’s Resize feature, found on the Retouch 
menu. 
 
As with all the Retouch menu options, the camera doesn’t destroy your 
original but instead makes a copy at the smaller size. Resized pictures are 
created in the JPEG format, but the JPEG quality level that’s used depends 
on your original. For JPEG originals, your resized copy is saved at the same 

296
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
Image Quality setting as the original (Fine, Normal, or Basic). Copies created 
from RAW, RAW+JPEG, or TIFF originals are saved at the top JPEG quality 
setting (Fine).
Step this way to create your small copy:
 
1. Choose Resize from the Retouch menu, as shown on the left in Figure 9-8.
Figure 9-8: The Resize feature creates a low-resolution, e-mail–friendly copy of a photo.
 
2. Press OK.
 
 You see the screen shown on the 
right in the figure.
 
3. If you have two memory cards 
installed, specify where you 
want to store the copy.
 
 Make the call through the Choose 
Destination option. If you have 
only one card in the camera, you 
can skip this step.
 
4.  Select Choose Size and press the 
Multi Selector right.
 
 You see the screen shown in 
Figure 9-9.
 
5. Select a picture size. 
 
 Choices are presented in terms of total resolution, in megapixels. 
To save you from having to do the math, here are the image pixel

424-pixel copy, which is perfect for e-mail.

297
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
dimensions (horizontal and vertical pixel count) you get with each 
setting:
 
• 2.5M: 1920 x 1280
 
• 1.1M: 1280 x 856
 
• 0.6M: 960 x 640
 
• 0.3M: 640 X 424 
 
6. Press OK.
 
7. Choose Select Image, as shown on the left in Figure 9-10, and press the 
Multi Selector right.
 
 You see thumbnails of all your pictures, as shown on the right in the 
figure.
Resize icon
Figure 9-10: Press the Multi Selector center button to mark a photo for resizing.
 
8. Select a photo and then press the center button of the Multi Selector 
to tag it for resizing.
 
 The yellow box indicates the selected photo; use the Multi Selector 
directional buttons to move the box over a photo you want to select. 
Then press the center button to place the little resize icon in the upper-
right corner of the thumbnail, as shown in the figure. Press the center 
button again to remove the tag if you change your mind. 
 
9. After selecting all your pictures, press OK.
 
 You see a screen asking you to confirm that you want to create small 
copies of the pictures.

298
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
10. Highlight Yes and press OK.
 
 The camera creates your resized copy. Note that filenumbers are 
assigned automatically and don’t match that of your original image even 
if you start with only a RAW or TIFF original.
When you view your resized copies 
on the monitor, you see the new file 
size and the Retouch icon, as shown in 
Figure 9-11. (The placement of the icon 
and file size depend on the playback 
display mode; check out Chapter 4 for 
details on changing the display mode.) 
Note that you can’t zoom in to magnify 
the view of small-size copies as you can 
with your original images.
 
If you want to create a small copy 
of only one picture, you can set the 
camera to Playback mode, display 
the photo in full-size view, and then 
press OK to jump to the Retouch 
menu. From there, choose the Resize option, select the memory card where 
you want to store the small copy, select the picture size, and then give the 
camera the go-ahead to make the copy.
Downsizing images in Nikon ViewNX
You can also create a low-resolution, JPEG copy of your image in ViewNX. 
However, be aware that the program restricts you to a minimum size of 320 
pixels along the photo’s longest side. If you need a smaller version, use your 
photo editing software to do the job.
Assuming that the 320-pixel restriction isn’t a problem, the following steps 
show you how to create your small-size copy in ViewNX. You can use this 
process to create a small JPEG copy of JPEG, NEF (RAW), and TIFF originals.
 
1. Select the image thumbnail in the main ViewNX window.
 
 Chapter 8 explains how to view your image thumbnails, if you need help. 
Just click a thumbnail to select it.
 
2.  Choose File➪Convert Files.
 
 You see the dialog box shown in Figure 9-12. (As with other figures, this 
one shows the box as it appears in Windows Vista; it may appear slightly 
different on a Mac or in other versions of Windows, but the essentials 
are the same.)
Figure 9-11: In single-image playback, you 
can see the file size of the small copy.

299
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
Figure 9-12: You also can use ViewNX to create a small-sized 
JPEG copy for e-mail sharing.
 
3. Select JPEG from the File Format drop-down list, as shown in the 
figure.
 
 The other format option, TIFF, is a print format. Web browsers and 
e-mail programs can’t display TIFF images, so be sure to use JPEG.
 
4. Select the Change the Image Size check box.
 
 Now the Long Edge and Short Edge text boxes become available. 
 
5. Type the desired pixel count of the longest side of your picture into 
the Long Edge box.
 
 The program automatically adjusts the Short Edge value to keep the 
resized image proportional.
 
 Again, to ensure that the picture is viewable without scrolling when 
opened in the recipient’s e-mail program, I suggest that you keep the 
Long Edge value at 640 pixels or less.

300
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
6. Adjust the Quality slider to set the amount of JPEG file compression.
 
 As Chapter 3 explains, a greater degree of compression results in a 
smaller file, which takes less time to download over the Web, but it 
reduces image quality. Notice that as you move the slider to the right, 
the resulting quality level appears above the slider. For example, in 
Figure 9-12, the level is Excellent Quality.
 
 Because the resolution of your image already results in a very small file, 
you can probably use the highest quality setting without worrying too 
much about download times. The exception is if you plan to attach mul-
tiple pictures to the same e-mail message, in which case you may want 
to set the slider a notch or two down from the highest quality setting.
 
7. Select the next three check boxes (Remove Camera Setting 
Information, Remove XMP/IPTC Information, and Remove ICC Color 
Profile), as shown in Figure 9-12. 
 
 When selected, the three options save the resized picture without the 
original image metadata, the extra text data that your camera stores 
with the image. (Chapter 8 explains.) Including this metadata adds to the 
file size, so for normal e-mail sharing, strip it out. The exception is when 
you want the recipient to be able to display the metadata in a photo pro-
gram that can do so.
 
8. Set the file destination.
 
 In layman’s terms, that just means to tell the program the location of 
the folder or drive where you want to store your downsized image file. 
You have two Save In options: Choose the first option to put the file 
in the same folder as the original, or select Specified Folder to put the 
file somewhere else. If you choose the first option, you’re done. If you 
choose the second option, the last folder you specified is shown to the 
left of the Browse button. To choose a different folder, click that Browse 
button.
 
 By selecting the Create a New Subfolder for Each File Conversion check 
box, you can create a new subfolder within your selected storage folder. 
If you do, the resized file goes into that subfolder, which you can name 
by clicking the Naming Options button.
 
9. (Optional) Specify a filename for the resized copy.
 
 If you want to put the small copy in the same folder as the original, the 
program protects you from overwriting the original by automatically 
assigning a slightly different name to the copy. By default, the program 
uses the original filename plus a two-number sequential tag: If the origi-
nal filename is DSC_0186.jpg, for example, the small-copy filename is 
DSC_0186_01.jpg. You can change a couple of aspects of this filenaming 
routine by selecting the Change File Names check box and then clicking 
the Naming Options button and adjusting the settings in the resulting 
dialog box. After making your wishes known, click OK to return to the 
Convert Files dialog box.

301
 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
 
 If you don’t store the copy in the same folder as the original, the pro-
gram doesn’t alter the filename of the copy automatically. That can lead 
to problems down the road because you will end up with two files, both 
with the same name but with different pixel counts, on your computer. 
In this scenario, be sure to input your own filenames for your copies.
 
10. Click the Convert button to finish the process.
Creating a Digital Slide Show
Many photo editing and cataloging programs offer a tool for creating digital 
slide shows that can be viewed on a computer or, if copied to a DVD, on a 
DVD player. You can even add music, captions, graphics, special effects, and 
the like to jazz up your presentations.
But if you want to create a simple slide show — that is, one that simply displays 
the photos on the camera memory card one by one — you can create and run 
the show right on your camera by using the Slide Show function on the Playback 
menu. And by connecting your camera to a television, as outlined in the last sec-
tion of this chapter, you can present your show to a whole roomful of people.
A couple of things to note about the Slide Show feature:
 
✓ The pictures displayed in the show depend on the current setting of the 
Playback Folder option on the Playback menu. For more about choosing 
which folder (and which memory card, if you’re using two at a time) you 
want to view, see Chapter 4.
 
✓ Any pictures that you hid through the Hide Image function, also 
explained in Chapter 4, do not appear in the show.
With those details out of the way, follow these steps to present a slide show:
 
1. Display the Playback menu and highlight Slide Show, as shown on the 
left in Figure 9-13.
 
2. Press OK to display the Slide Show screen shown on the right in 
Figure 9-13.
 
3. Highlight Frame Interval and press the Multi Selector right.
 
 On the next screen, you can specify how long you want each image to be 
displayed. You can set the interval to 2, 3, 5, or 10 seconds.
 
4. Highlight the frame interval you want to use and press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the Slide Show screen.
 
5. To start the show, highlight Start and press OK.
 
 The camera begins displaying your pictures on the camera monitor.

Figure 9-13: Choose Slide Show to set up automatic playback of all pictures on your 
memory card.
When the show ends, you see a screen offering three options: You can 
choose to restart the show, adjust the frame interval, or exit to the Playback 
menu. Highlight your choice and press OK.
During the show, you can control playback as follows:
 
✓ Pause the show. Press OK. Select Restart and press OK to begin display-
ing pictures again. When you pause the slide show, you also have the 
option to change the interval — a handy option if the pace is too quick 
or slow — or exit the show. To change the frame interval, highlight the 
option and press OK. Choose the desired interval from the next screen 
and press OK. Highlight Restart and press OK to restart the show with 
the new interval.
 
✓ Exit the show. You’ve got three options: 
 
• To return to full-frame, regular playback, press the Playback 
button.
 
• To return to the Playback menu, press the Menu button.
 
• To return to picture-taking mode, press the shutter button 
halfway.
 
✓ Skip to the next/previous image manually. Press the Multi Selector 
right or left.
 
✓ Change the information displayed with the image. Press the Multi 
Selector up or down to cycle through the info-display modes. (See 
Chapter 4 for details on what information is provided in each mode.)

 Chapter 9: Printing and Sharing Your Pictures
Viewing Your Photos and 
Movies on a Television
Tired of passing your camera around to 
show people your pictures or movies on the 
monitor? Why not display them on a televi-
sion instead? Your camera is equipped with 
both an HDMI outlet, or jack, for connecting 
the camera to a high-definition TV (or other 
video device), and an AV (audio/visual) jack, 
for connecting the camera to a regular TV 
or video device. Both connection points are 
tucked under the little rubber cover on the 
left-rear side of the camera and highlighted 
in Figure 9-13. A cable for making a regular 
video connection is included in the camera 
box. (It’s the cable that has two plugs at one 
end, one white and one yellow.) For HDMI 
connections, you need to purchase a cable. 
You need something called a Type C mini-pin 
cable.
Before connecting your camera, double-
check the following menu options, 
both on the Setup menu and shown 
in Figure 9-15:
 
✓ Video Mode: You get just two 
options here: NTSC and PAL. 
Select the video mode that is 
used by your part of the world. 
(In the United States, Canada, and 
Mexico, NTSC is the standard.)
 
✓ HDMI: Unless you have trouble, 
stick with the Auto setting; the 
camera then automatically selects 
the right format for the HD device 
you’re using. You also can select 
from four different formats, if you 
feel comfortable doing so.

camera to a television for big-screen 
playback.
Figure 9-15: The options related to television 
playback live on the Setup menu.

304
Part III: Working with Picture Files 
 
Whether you go high def or regular def — what the industry now wants us to 
call standard definition — turn the camera off before connecting the devices. 
Then do the following:
 
✓ Regular A/V: For a regular video connection, plug the black end of the 
cable into the camera. Then connect the white plug at the other end of 
the cable into the audio input jack of your video device and the yellow 
plug into the video input jack. (You can leave the audio plug discon-
nected for still photos or movies recorded without sound.) During play-
back, your pictures will appear both on the camera monitor and the TV.
 
✓ HDMI: With HDMI, everything goes through a single connector. After the 
two are linked, you can press the Info button to toggle the monitor dis-
play on and off.
When the two devices are connected, turn the camera and TV or video 
device on. At this point, you need to consult your TV manual to find out what 
channel to select for playback of signals from auxiliary input devices like 
your camera. After you sort that issue out, you can control playback using 
the same camera controls as you normally do to view pictures and movies 
on your camera monitor. You can also run slide shows by following the steps 
outlined in the preceding section.

n time-honored For Dummies tradition, this 
part of the book contains additional tidbits of 
information presented in the always popular “Top 
Ten” list format.
Chapter 10 details ten camera-customization 
options that haven’t been covered in earlier 
chapters, while Chapter 11 introduces you to ten 
camera functions that I consider specialty tools — 
bonus options that, while not at the top of the list 
of the features I suggest you study, are nonetheless 
interesting to explore when you have a free

Ten More Ways to Customize 
Your Camera
In This Chapter
▶ Creating and saving custom menu banks
▶ Adding copyright data and hidden text to picture files
▶ Using your own folder and filenames
▶ Changing the behavior of some buttons and dials
H
ave you ever tried to cook dinner in someone else’s house or work 
from another colleague’s desk? Why is nothing stored in the right 
place? The coffee cups, for example, should be stowed in the cabinet 
above the coffee maker, and yet there they are, way across 
the kitchen, in the cupboard near the fridge. And everyone 
knows that the highlighter pens belong in the middle top 
drawer, not the second one on the left. Yeesh.
In the same way, you may consider a particular 
aspect of the D300s design illogical or maybe just a 
tad inconvenient. You may find it more natural to 
use the command dial on the front of the camera 
to perform most operations rather than the one on 
the back, for example — which is the exact oppo-
site of the way things are set up at the factory. 
Well, as you’ve no doubt already deduced, Nikon is 
more than eager to let you customize almost every 
aspect of the camera’s operation, from limiting the number 
of autofocus points in use to deciding which picture you want 
to see next after you delete a photo. In fact, about the only thing 
you can’t customize is the way the battery fits into the battery compartment.

308
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
This chapter discusses ten customization options not yet considered in ear-
lier chapters, including ways to embed a copyright notice in your picture 
files, create custom folder and file names, and even tweak the function of 
external controls — including the aforementioned command dials.
Creating Custom Menu Banks
After you gain some experience with your camera, you’ll probably find that 
you routinely use certain Shooting menu and Custom Setting menu options 
for specific types of pictures. For example, you might prefer one set of 
options when shooting landscapes and another for shooting indoor sports. If 
you routinely spend a lot of time adjusting options on these menus for differ-
ent scenes, you may want to investigate a feature called menu banks.
Menu banks enable you to store collections of Shooting menu and Custom 
Setting menu settings. When you want to use the settings in a collection, you 
don’t have to restore each option individually — instead, you just select the 
bank you want to use, and the camera automatically restores all the saved 
settings for you.
Here are the banking details you need to know:
 
✓ You can create up to eight banks. You get four Shooting menu banks 
and four Custom Setting menu banks.
 
✓ Banks are assigned the names A, B, C, and D by default. You can 
create custom names to help you remember what each bank is designed 
to do, however. 
 
✓ Initially, all banks use the camera’s default settings, and the A banks 
are selected. To put it another way, you’re provided originally with eight 
identical banks, all containing the default settings.
 
✓ You can select a bank via the menus or the Information screen. To 
select the Shooting menu bank, highlight Shooting Menu Bank on the 
Shooting menu, as shown in Figure 10-1, and then press OK to display 
the second screen in the figure. Highlight the bank you want to use and 
press OK. To select a Custom Setting bank, use the same process but go 
through the Custom Setting menu instead.
 
 
 For a quicker option, press the Info button to display the Information 
screen, where the currently selected banks appear in the areas high-
lighted on the left in Figure 10-2. Press Info again to access the control 
strip, use the Multi Selector to highlight the bank you want to change, as 

309
 Chapter 10: Ten More Ways to Customize Your Camera
shown on the right in the figure, and press OK. You’re whisked to the 
same list of banks you get when you go through the menus (the right 
screen in Figure 10-1).
Figure 10-1: You can select the bank you want to use from the first option on the menu.
Figure 10-2: You can also switch between banks through the control strip in the Info screen.
 
✓ If you change a menu setting, it overrides the setting currently stored 
in the active bank. This behavior creates a problem, obviously, because 
it’s easy to forget that you altered a setting or two when you’re in the 
midst of shooting. And it doesn’t take long before you tweak the options 
enough that the bank no longer really works for the type of scene it was 
designed to capture.
 
 As a solution, you can use the Save/Load Setting option, introduced in 
Chapter 1, to save your banks as data files and store them on a memory 
card. Then whenever you want to get back to your original bank set-
tings, you load the bank files onto the camera. 

310
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Use the Rename option to give each bank a custom name. After you 
get to the right screen in Figure 10-1, choose Rename and press the 
Multi Selector right to start the naming process. You first see the 
left screen shown in Figure 10-3. Highlight the bank you want to 
name and press the Multi Selector right again to display the little 
keyboard-like screen shown on the right in the figure. 
 
 Use these techniques to enter your name, which can be up to 20 charac-
ters long:
 
• To enter a character: Press the Multi Selector right or left to move 
the highlight over the letter that you want to add and then press 
the center button to enter the character.
 
 
• To move the cursor within the name field: Press and hold the Zoom 
Out button as you press the Multi Selector right or left.
 
• To scroll through all the available characters in the keyboard: Press 
the Multi Selector up and down.
 
 
• To delete a character: Move the cursor under the letter you want to 
zap and press the Delete button.
 
 After you finish entering the bank name, press OK. You’re returned to 
the main Rename screen, where you new name appears. Press OK again 
to exit to the main menu.
Figure 10-3: You can assign custom names to each bank.
Creating Your Own Menu
In addition to creating custom menu banks, you can build your very own, 
specialized menu that holds up to 20 of the options you use most frequently. 
And unlike the menu banks, which can store only options from the Custom 

311
 Chapter 10: Ten More Ways to Customize Your Camera
Setting and Shooting menus, your custom menu can contain selections from 
any menu. Check it out:
 
1. Display the My Menu menu, as shown on the left in Figure 10-4.
Figure 10-4: You can create a custom menu to hold up to 20 of the settings you access most often.
 
 If the Recent Settings menu appears instead, scroll to the end of the menu, 
select Choose Tab, press OK, select My Menu, and press OK again. The 
My Menu screen then appears.
 
2. Highlight Add Items and press OK.
 
 Now you see a list of the five main camera menus, as shown on the right 
in Figure 10-4. 
 
3. Highlight a menu that contains an option you want to add to your 
custom menu and then press the Multi Selector right.
 
 You see a list of all available options on that menu, as shown on the left 
in Figure 10-5.
Figure 10-5: Highlight a menu item and press OK to add it to your custom menu.

312
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 A few items can’t be added to a custom menu. A little box with a slash 
through it appears next to those items.
 
4. To add an item to your custom menu, highlight it and press OK.
 
 Now you see the Choose Position screen, shown on the right in Figure 
10-5, where you can change the order of your menu items. For now, just 
press OK to return to the My Menu screen; you can set up the order of 
your menu items later. (See the list following these steps.) The menu 
item you just added appears at the top of the My Menu screen.
 
5. Repeat Steps 2–4 to add more items to your menu.
 
 In Step 3, a check mark appears next to any item that’s already on 
your menu.
After creating your custom menu, you can access it by pressing the Menu 
button and choosing the Recent Settings/My Menu screen. (If you want 
to switch to the Recent Settings menu, select Choose Tab and then select 
Recent Settings.)
You can reorder the menu items and remove items as follows:
 
✓ Change the order of menu options: Display your custom menu and 
highlight Rank Items, as shown on the left in Figure 10-6. You then see a 
screen that lists all your menu items in their current order. Highlight a 
menu item, as shown on the right in the figure, press OK, and then use the 
Multi Selector to move it up or down the list. Press OK to lock in the new 
position of the menu item. When you’re happy with the order of the menu 
items, press the Multi Selector left to return to the My Menu screen.
Figure 10-6: Choose Rank Items to change the order of menu items.

313
 Chapter 10: Ten More Ways to Customize Your Camera
 
✓ Remove menu items: Again, head for the My Menu screen. Select 
Remove Items and press OK. You see a list of all the current menu items, 
with an empty box next to each item. To remove an item, highlight it and 
press the Multi Selector right. A check mark then appears in that item’s 
box. After tagging all the items you want to remove, highlight Done and 
press OK. You see a confirmation screen asking permission to remove 
the item; press OK to go forward.
Adding Text Comments to Your Files
Through the Image Comment feature on the Setup menu, you can add text 
comments to your picture files. Suppose, for example, that you’re traveling 
on vacation and visiting a different destination every day. You can annotate 
all the pictures you take on a particular outing with the name of the loca-
tion or attraction. You can then view the comments either in Nikon ViewNX, 
which ships free with your camera, or Capture NX2, which you must buy 
separately. The comments also appear in some other photo programs that 
enable you to view metadata. Additionally, you can view comments in the 
Shooting Data display mode during playback.
Here’s how the Image Comment feature works:
 
1. Display the Setup menu and highlight Image Comment, as shown on 
the left in Figure 10-7.
 
2. Press OK to display the right screen in the figure.
Figure 10-7: You can tag pictures with text comments that you can view in Nikon ViewNX.

314
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
3. Highlight Input Comment and 
press the Multi Selector right.
 
 Now you see a keyboard-type 
screen like the one shown in 
Figure 10-8.
 
4. Use the Multi Selector to high-
light the first letter of the text 
you want to add.
 
5. Press the center button on 
the Multi Selector to enter the 
letter into the display box at the 
bottom of the screen.
 
6. Keep highlighting and entering 
letters to complete your com-
ment text.
 
 Your comment can be up to 36 characters long. You can use the same 
text entry tricks as when you rename custom menu banks:
 
 
• To move the text cursor: Press and hold the Zoom Out button as 
you press the Multi Selector in the direction you want to shift the 
cursor.
 
 
• To delete a letter: Move the cursor under the offending letter and 
then press the Delete button.
 
7. To save the comment, press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the Image Comment menu.
 
8. Highlight Attach Comment and press the Multi Selector right to put a 
check mark in the box.
 
 The check mark turns the Image Comment feature on.
 
9. Highlight Done and press OK to wrap things up.
 
 You’re returned to the Setup menu. The Image Comment menu item 
should now be set to On.
 
The camera applies your comment to all pictures you take after turning on Image 
Comment. To disable the feature, revisit the Image Comment menu, highlight 
Attach Comment, and press the Multi Selector right to toggle the check mark off. 
Be sure to highlight Done and press OK to make the change official.
To view comments in Nikon ViewNX, display the Metadata tab and select an 
image by clicking its thumbnail. The Image Comment text appears in the File 
Info 2 section of the tab, as shown in Figure 10-9. (If that section is closed, 
click the little triangle next to File Info 2.) The same part of the tab shows 
embedded copyright information, an option discussed in the next section. 
Chapter 8 provides more details on using View NX.
Figure 10-8: Comments can contain as many 
as 36 characters.

315
 Chapter 10: Ten More Ways to Customize Your Camera
Figure 10-9: Comments appear with other metadata in Nikon ViewNX.
Embedding a Copyright Notice
 
By using the Copyright Information option on the Setup menu, you can load 
your personal copyright data into the camera’s brain. Then, whenever you 
shoot a picture, your copyright information is recorded with the image file. 
As with comments that you add through the Image Comment option, you can 
view the embedded copyright data during playback, in Shooting Data display 
mode, and in many photo programs, including Nikon ViewNX, as shown in 
Figure 10-9.
Including a copyright notice is a reasonable first step to take if you want to 
prevent people from using your pictures without permission. Anyone who 
views your picture in a program that can display metadata (the extra data 
recorded with a digital photo file) will see your copyright notice. Obviously, 
that won’t be enough to completely prevent unauthorized use of your images. 
And technically speaking, you hold the copyright to your photo whether you 
take any steps to mark it with your name. But if you ever come to the point of 
pressing legal action, you can at least show that you did your due diligence in 
letting people know that you hold the copyright.

316
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
To enter your copyright information, take these steps:
 
1. Display the Setup menu and highlight Copyright Information, as 
shown on the left in Figure 10-10.
Figure 10-10: Use this feature to embed copyright information into each picture file.
 
2. Press OK to display the second screen shown in Figure 10-10.
 
3. Highlight Artist and press OK to display a text-entry screen.
 
4. Enter your name and then press OK.
 
 The text-entry screen works just as when you add image comments. Use 
the Multi Selector to highlight a letter and then press the center button 
to enter that character. You can enter up to 36 characters. 
 
 
 To move the cursor within your text, press and hold the Zoom Out 
button as you press the Multi Selector in the direction you want to move 
the cursor.
 
 
 To delete a character, move the cursor under it and press the Delete 
button.
 
5. Highlight Copyright, press OK, and then enter your copyright notice.
 
 This time, you can enter a whopping 54 characters. 
 
6. Press OK to return to the main Copyright Information screen.
 
 The copyright information you entered should now appear on the 
screen, as shown in Figure 10-11.
 
7. Highlight Attach Copyright Information and press the Multi Selector 
right to place a check mark in the adjacent box, as shown on the left 
in Figure 10-11.

317
 Chapter 10: Ten More Ways to Customize Your Camera
Figure 10-11: Press the Multi Selector right to toggle the Attach setting on and off.
 
8. Highlight Done, as shown on the right in Figure 10-11, and press OK.
 
 Don’t forget this step (as I always seem to do)! Otherwise, none of your 
changes will “stick” and you’ll have to go through the whole process 
again. After you return to the Setup menu, the Copyright Information 
item on the Setup menu (left screen in Figure 10-10) should be set to On, 
indicating that the camera will now include your copyright text as part 
of the file metadata for all subsequent shots.
To stop adding the copyright data, just revisit the Copyright Information 
screen, toggle the Attach box off, and then select Done and press OK.
Choosing Your Own File and Folder Names
By default, your camera initially stores all your images in one folder, which 
it names 100D300S. Folders have a storage limit of 999 images; when you 
exceed that number, the camera creates a new folder, assigning a name that 
indicates the folder number — 101D300S, 102D300S, and so on.
If you choose, you can create your own folder-numbering scheme. For exam-
ple, perhaps you sometimes use your camera for business and sometimes 
for personal use. To keep your images separate, you can set up one folder 
numbered 200D300S for work images and use the regular 100D300S folder for 
personal photos.
What’s more, you can customize the first three letters of your picture file-
names. Normally, filenames begin either with the characters DSC_, for photos 
captured in the sRGB color space, or _DSC, for images that use the Adobe 
RGB color space. (Chapter 6 explains color spaces.) So, for example, you 
could set the camera to replace DSC with TIM if you’re taking pictures of your 
brother Tim’s family and then change the characters to SUE when you move 
to cousin Sue’s house.

318
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
The following steps show you how to create custom folders and filenames:
 
1. To create custom folders, display the Shooting menu and highlight 
Active Folder, as shown on the left in Figure 10-12.
Figure 10-12: You can create custom folders to organize your images right on the camera.
 
2. Press OK to display the 
screen shown on the right 
in Figure 10-12.
 
3. Highlight New Folder Number 
and press the Multi Selector 
right.
 
 You see a screen like the one 
shown on the left in Figure 10-13.
 
4. Use the Multi Selector to set the 
new folder number.
 
 Press right or left to highlight the 
digit you want to change; press up 
or down to adjust the value.
 
 If a folder bearing the number you enter already exists, a little file-folder 
icon appears next to the number. An empty folder icon means that no 
pictures are currently stored in the folder; a half-full icon means that 
some pictures exist but more will fit; and the full icon means that the 
folder is stuffed to the max, and thus you can’t store any more pictures 
in it.
 
5. Press OK to complete the process and return to the Shooting menu.
 
 The folder you just created is automatically selected as the active folder.
 
6. To customize the first three characters of picture filenames, highlight 
File Naming, as shown on the left in Figure 10-14, and press OK.
Figure 10-13: Highlight a number and press 
the Multi Selector up or down to change it.

Figure 10-14: This option enables you to change the first three characters of filenames.
 
 You see the screen shown on the 
right in the figure. The current 
file naming structure for sRGB 
and Adobe RGB files appears on 
the screen.
 
7. Select File Naming and press the 
Multi Selector right to display 
the text entry screen shown in 
Figure 10-15.
 
8. Enter your three custom 
characters.
 
 Use the Multi Selector to highlight 
a character; press the center 
button to enter that character.
 
 
 To move the cursor within your text, press the Zoom Out button while 
pressing the Multi Selector right or left. To delete a character, move the 
cursor under it and press the Delete button.
 
9. Press OK.
 
 You’re returned to the Shooting menu. The Active Folder and File 
Naming options should reflect the changes you just made.
 
If you create custom folders, remember to specify where you want your 
pictures stored each time you shoot. Select Active Folder from the Shooting 
menu, as shown on the left in Figure 10-16, and press OK. Highlight Select 
Folder, as shown on the right, and press the Multi Selector right to display a 
list of all your folders. (If you’re using both memory card slots, you first need 
to select a card.) Highlight the folder that you want to use and press OK. 
Your choice also affects which images you can view in Playback mode; see 
Chapter 4 to find out how to select the folder you want to view.

Customizing a Trio of Buttons
Earlier chapters introduce you to the Fn (Function) button and Depth-of-Field 
Preview buttons, both shown on the left in Figure 10-17, and the AE-L/AF-L 
button, shown on the right. As a recap, the buttons are set by default to per-
form the following tasks:
Depth-of-Field Preview button
AE-L/AF-L button
Function (Fn) button
Figure 10-17: You can change the functions performed by these buttons.

321
 Chapter 10: Ten More Ways to Customize Your Camera
 
✓ Fn button: If you enable bracketing, a feature introduced in Chapter 5, 
you press this button while rotating the main command dial to specify 
how many shots you want in each bracketed series. And you use the 
button in conjunction with the sub-command dial to set the increment 
of change you want to make between each bracketed shot. Press the 
button by its lonesome, and it displays the current bracketing settings in 
the Control panel and Information display.
 
✓ Depth-of-Field Preview button: When you look through the viewfinder 
and press the button, the display changes to give you an idea of how 
your current f-stop setting will affect depth of field. 
 
✓ AE-L/AF-L button: Autofocus and autoexposure are locked when you 
press the button, and they remain locked as long as you keep your finger 
on the button.
While you’re first learning your camera and especially while using this book 
as a reference, it’s a good idea to stick with these defaults — otherwise, my 
instructions won’t work (and neither will those you find in other instructional 
resources). But after you gain some experience, you may want to change the 
functions that are performed by the buttons.
For all three buttons, you can specify that you want a press of the button 
alone to perform any the functions listed in Table 10-1. You also can use 
the buttons in conjunction with command dials to accomplish the functions 
listed in Table 10-2.
Do note a couple of points before you dig in, however:
 
✓ Assigning some operations in Table 10-1 to a button prevents you 
from using the button-and-command dial combos listed in Table 10-2. I 
flagged these options in Table 10-1 and the camera displays a reminder 
alert when you select those functions as well. Additionally, if you set 
the button-press function to these flagged options and then select a 
button+dial setting other than None, the camera automatically resets 
the button-press setting to None. Again, the camera warns you when 
you select the conflicting button+dial setting.
 
✓ One button-press option, AF-On, is available only for the AE-L/AF-L 
button. And one button+command dial option, 1 Step/Spd Aperture, 
can’t be assigned to that button.
You can set the function of a button in two ways: 
 
✓ Via the Custom Setting menu: Select Assign Fn Button, shown in 
Figure 10-18, to customize the Function button; choose Assign Preview 
Button to customize the Depth-of-Field Preview button; and choose 
Assign AE-L/AF-L button to . . . well, you get the drift. Then press OK to 
display a screen that offers the two menu options that enable you to 

322
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
modify the button’s behavior. (The figure shows the screen that relates 
to the Fn button. Notice the red highlight indicating which button you’re 
adjusting.)
 
 Set up your buttons as follows:
 
• To perform an operation with the button only: To assign a function 
to the button alone, select the Button Press option and press OK. 
You then see a screen showing the options that are explained and 
listed in Table 10-1. Select your choice, and press OK.
 
• Change the operation performed by pressing the button and rotating 
a command dial: Select the Button + Dials option and press OK to 
access the options listed in Table 10-2. Highlight your choice and 
press OK again.
 
 
✓ Via the Information screen: Symbols representing the current button 
settings appear in the control strip area of the Information screen, 
as shown in Figure 10-19. For example, the little aperture symbol 
next to the Depth of Field Preview button item shows that pressing 
the button stops down the aperture so that you can preview depth 
of field in the viewfinder. 
 
 And the little dial symbol that appears with the Fn button label tells you 
that the button is set to its default — that is, you use the button with the 
command dials to adjust Bracketing (BKT) settings.
 
 
 Press the Info button once to display the Info screen and then again to 
activate the control strip, as shown on the right in the figure, and then 
use the Multi Selector to highlight the button you want to change. Press 
OK to get to the same menu screens displayed when you set the button 
function through the Custom Setting menu.

Rotating the dials while pressing the button has no effect. 
1Not available for AE-L/AF-L button
Locking Exposure with the Shutter Button
Normally, pressing the shutter button halfway initiates autofocusing and, in 
single-servo autofocus mode, locks focus. Pressing the button halfway also 
initiates exposure metering but doesn’t 
lock exposure — the camera continu-
ously adjusts the exposure settings as 
needed up to the time you take the pic-
ture. If you want to lock exposure, you 
can use the AE-L/AF-L button to do the 
job, as explained in Chapter 5. 
You also have the option to set the 
shutter button to lock exposure and 
focus together. The setting in ques-
tion is found on the Timers/AE Lock 
submenu of the Custom Setting menu 
and is called Shutter-Release Button 
AE-L, as shown in Figure 10-20. If you 
set the option to On, your half-press of 
Figure 10-20: This option controls whether 
the shutter button can be used to lock focus 
and exposure.

326
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
the shutter button locks both focus and exposure. Whew, I’m giving myself a 
headache considering all these possible variations — you?
Changing the Behavior of the Command Dials
Through the Customize Command Dials option, found on the Controls sec-
tion of the Custom Setting menu and shown in Figure 10-21, you can control 
several aspects of how the command dials behave, as follows:
Figure 10-21: The right screen here shows the default setup for the command dials.
 
✓ Reverse Rotation: At the default setting, Off, the dials work as indicated 
throughout this book and the camera manual. Select Yes to reverse the 
direction you spin the dials to accomplish the various tasks they perform.
 
✓ Change Main/Sub: This setting controls which dial you use to adjust 
aperture and shutter speed. At the default setting, Off, the main com-
mand dial adjusts shutter speed, and the sub-command dial controls 
aperture. Select On to swap the dial roles.
 
✓ Aperture Setting: For this option, you have two settings: 
 
• Sub-command dial: This is the default setting; the sub-command 
dial controls aperture (assuming that you didn’t alter the setting of 
the Change Main/Sub option just discussed). When you select this 
option, the Aperture Setting item on the menu appears set to On, 
as shown on the right in Figure 10-21.
 
• Aperture ring: This setting relates only to lenses that have an aper-
ture ring; if you select this option, you can adjust the f-stop only by 
using the aperture ring. Live View is disabled if you attach a lens 
with an aperture ring and use this setting. The Aperture Setting 
item on the menu appears set to Off when you select this option.

327
 Chapter 10: Ten More Ways to Customize Your Camera
 
✓ Menus and Playback: At the default setting, Off, you use the Multi 
Selector to scroll through your pictures and change the data-display 
style during playback. And during shooting, you use the Multi Selector 
to navigate menus.
 
 By changing the setting to On, you can use the command dials during 
playback and while navigating menus as follows:
 
• Playback: Use the main command dial to scroll through pictures 
in single-image view and move the image-highlight box left or right 
during thumbnails playback. Use the sub-command dial to adjust 
the data-display mode during single-image playback and move the 
highlight box up and down through thumbnails.
 
• Menu navigation: Rotate the main command dial to scroll up and 
down through a menu. Rotate the sub-command dial right to dis-
play the submenu for the selected item; rotate left to jump to the 
previous menu.
Customizing the Multi Selector Center Button
You can customize the role that the center button on the Multi Selector plays 
during shooting and playback through the aptly named Multi Selector Center 
Button option, found in the Controls section of the Custom Setting menu, as 
shown on the left in Figure 10-22. Highlight the option and press OK to dis-
play the screen on the right in the figure.
Figure 10-22: You can change the role the Multi Selector center button plays during shooting 
and playback.

328
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
The two options on the screen work like so:
 
✓ Shooting Mode: Select this option and press OK to display a screen 
offering the following three choices, which determine what the button 
does while you’re taking pictures:
 
• RESET (Select Center Focus Point): At this setting, the button auto-
matically selects the center autofocus point. I think that’s a pretty 
handy feature, so it’s my choice. See Chapter 6 for help under-
standing autofocus points.
 
• Highlight Active Focus Point: At this setting, pressing the button 
highlights the active focus point in the viewfinder.
 
• Not Used: This setting disables the center button during shooting 
altogether — although I don’t know why you would unless you 
somehow keep pressing the button by accident.
 
✓ Playback Mode: You get four options for how you want to use the 
center button during picture playback, which are:
 
• Thumbnail On/Off: This setting is the default; pressing the button 
toggles you between thumbnail-sized image displays and full-frame 
view.
 
• View Histograms: This one may win out over the default if you’re 
a frequent histogram checker: If you select this option, you can 
press and hold the button to temporarily overlay a histogram over 
your image whether you’re in full-frame or thumbnail view.
 
• Zoom On/Off: At this setting, pressing the center button displays a 
magnified view of the current image. The zoomed view is automati-
cally centered on the focus point you used when taking the image. 
If you select this option, you’re taken to a screen where you can set 
the magnification level (low, medium, or high) for the zoomed view.
 
• Choose Folder: This option enables you to use the center button to 
quickly access the menu option that enables you to specify which 
folder’s images you want to view.
 
 Note that you have other options for accomplishing these playback tasks; 
see Chapter 4 for details as well as for general playback information.
Uncoupling the Buttons and Command Dials
Under the normal camera setup, an operation that involves both a camera 
button and a command dial requires you to hold the button down while spin-
ning the dial to get results. For example, to change the flash mode, you hold 
down the Flash Mode button while rotating the main command dial.

329
 Chapter 10: Ten More Ways to Customize Your Camera
If you find it cumbersome to keep 
pressing the button while you rotate 
the dial, you can tell the two con-
trols that you prefer them to dance 
separately instead of cheek-to-cheek. 
The relevant option is located on 
the Controls submenu of the Custom 
Setting menu; it’s called Release 
Button to Use Dial, as shown in Figure 
10-23. Set the option to Yes, and you 
let up on the button and then rotate 
the command dial to adjust a camera 
setting. So to change flash mode, for 
example, you press and release the 
Flash Mode button and then rotate the 
main command dial.
There’s a little gotcha to remember if you accept this variation, however: 
The setting you’re adjusting remains active until you press the button 
again, you press the shutter button halfway, or press the Mode, Exposure 
Compensation, Flash, ISO, QUAL, or WB buttons. And if you forget and leave 
the setting “open,” you can easily adjust the setting with the command dial 
when you’re meaning to do something else. For this reason, I prefer to use 
the default setting, No.
Figure 10-23: I think the default setting for 
this option is the safest way to go.

Ten Features to Explore 
on a Rainy Day
In This Chapter
▶ Removing red-eye
▶ Tweaking exposure and color
▶ Adding artistic effects
▶ Cropping away excess background
▶ Experimenting with time-lapse photography
C
onsider this chapter the literary equivalent of the end of one of those 
late-night infomercial offers — the part where the host 
exclaims, “But wait! There’s more!”
The features covered in these pages fit the category 
of “interesting bonus.” They aren’t the sort of fea-
tures that drive people to choose one camera over 
another, and they may come in handy only for 
certain users, on certain occasions. Still, they’re 
included at no extra charge with your camera 
purchase, so check ’em out when you have a few 
spare moments. Who knows; you may discover that 
one of these features is actually a hidden gem that 
provides just the solution you need for one of your 
photography problems. 
Applying the Retouch Menu Filters
Many of the features described in this chapter live on the Retouch menu, so I 
want to give you a brief overview of how these menu options work.

332
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
When you apply a correction or enhancement from the Retouch menu, the 
camera creates a copy of your original photo and then makes the changes to 
the copy only. Your original is preserved untouched.
You can get to the Retouch menu features in two ways:
 
✓ Display the menu, select the tool you want to use, and press OK. You’re 
then presented with thumbnails of your photos. Use the Multi Selector 
to move the yellow highlight box over the photo you want to adjust and 
press OK. You next see options related to the selected tool.
 
 
✓ Switch the camera to playback mode, display your photo in single-frame 
view, and press OK. (Remember, you can shift from thumbnail display to 
single-frame view simply by pressing the OK button.) The Retouch menu 
then appears superimposed over 
your photo, as shown in Figure 
11-1. Select the tool you want to 
use and press OK again to access 
the tool options. I prefer the 
second method, so that’s how I 
approach things in this chapter, 
but it’s entirely a personal choice.
 
 However, you can’t use this 
method for one Retouch menu 
option: Image Overlay, which 
combines two photos to create 
a third, blended image, requires 
you to use the first method of 
accessing the menu.
A few other critical factoids to note before you begin experimenting with the 
Retouch menu tools:
 
✓ The Image Overlay feature works only with NEF (RAW) files. The 
resulting picture is also saved in the NEF format. Chapter 3 explains the 
NEF file type; Chapter 8 shows you how to convert a RAW file to a stan-
dard file format.
 
✓ All other menu options work with JPEG, TIFF, or NEF originals, but 
the edited file is saved in the JPEG format. Again, see Chapter 3 for 
help understanding file formats.
 
✓ File numbers of retouched copies don’t match those of the originals. 
Make note of the filename the retouched version is assigned so that 
you can easily track it down later. What numbering the camera chooses 
depends on the numbers of the files already on your memory card.
Figure 11-1: In single-frame playback view, 
just press OK to bring up the Retouch menu.

333
 Chapter 11: Ten Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
 
✓ You can compare the original and the retouched version through the 
Side-by-Side menu option. To use this feature, start by displaying either 
the original or the retouched version in full-frame playback. Then press 
OK, select Side-by-Side Comparison, as shown on the left in Figure 11-2, 
and press OK again. Now you see the original image on one side and the 
retouched version on the other, as shown in the second screen in the 
figure. At the top of the screen, labels indicate the Retouch tool that you 
applied to the photo. (I applied the Monochrome filter in Figure 11-2.)
Figure 11-2: Use the Side-by-Side Comparison option to see whether you prefer the retouched 
version of a photo to the original.
 
 These additional tricks work in Side-by-Side display:
 
• If you applied more than one Retouch tool to the picture, press the 
Multi Selector right and left to display individual thumbnails that 
show how each tool affected the picture.
 
• If you create multiple retouched versions of the same original — 
for example, if you create a monochrome version, save that, and 
then crop the original image and save that — you use a differ-
ent technique to compare all the versions. First, press the Multi 
Selector right or left to surround the After image with the yellow 
highlight box. Now press the Multi Selector up and down to scroll 
through all the retouched versions.
 
 
• To temporarily view the original or retouched image at full-frame 
view, use the Multi Selector to highlight its thumbnail and then 
press and hold the Zoom In button. Release the button to return to 
side-by-side view.
 
 To exit side-by-side view and return to single-image playback, press the 
Playback button.

Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Removing Red-Eye
From my experience, red-eye is not a major problem with the D300s. 
Typically, the problem occurs only in very dark lighting, which makes sense: 
When little ambient light is available, the pupils of the subjects’ eyes widen, 
creating more potential for the flash light to cause red-eye reflection.
If you spot a red-eye problem, however, give the Red-Eye Correction filter a try: 
 
1. Display your photo in single-image view and press OK.
 
 The Retouch menu appears over your photo.
 
2. Highlight Red-Eye Correction and press OK.
 
 If the camera detects red-eye, it applies the removal filter and displays 
the results in the monitor. If the camera can’t find any red-eye, it dis-
plays a message telling you so.
 
 Note that the Red-Eye Correction option appears dimmed in the menu 
for photos taken without flash.
 
3. Carefully inspect the repair.
 
 
 Press the Zoom In button to mag-
nify the display so that you can 
check the camera’s work, as 
shown in Figure 11-3. To scroll the 
display, press the Multi Selector 
up, down, right, or left. The yellow 
box in the tiny navigation window 
in the lower-right corner of the 
screen indicates the area of the 
picture that you’re currently 
viewing.
 
4. If you approve of the correction, 
press OK twice.
 
 The first OK returns the display to normal magnification; the second 
creates the retouched copy.
 
5. If you’re not happy with the results, press OK to return to normal 
magnification. Then press the Playback button to cancel the repair.
 
If the in-camera red-eye repair fails you, most photo editing programs 
have red-eye removal tools that should enable you to get the job done. 
Unfortunately, no red-eye remover works on animal eyes. Red-eye removal 
tools know how to detect and replace only red-eye pixels, and animal eyes 
typically turn yellow, white, or green in response to a flash. The easiest solu-
tion is to use the paintbrush tool found in most photo editors to paint in the 
proper eye colors.

and check the red-eye repair.

Shadow Recovery with D-Lighting
Chapter 5 introduces you to a feature called Active D-Lighting. If you turn on 
this option when you shoot a picture, the camera captures the image in a way 
that brightens the darkest parts of the image, bringing shadow detail into the 
light, while leaving highlight details intact. It’s a great trick for dealing with 
high-contrast scenes or subjects that are backlit.
You also can apply a similar adjustment after you take a picture by choosing 
the D-Lighting option on the Retouch menu. I did just that for the photo in 
Figure 11-4, where strong backlighting left the balloon underexposed in the 
original image.
Original image
D-Lighting, High
Figure 11-4: An underexposed photo (left) gets help from the D-Lighting filter (right).
Here’s how to apply the filter:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image mode and then press OK to display 
the Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight D-Lighting, as shown on the left in Figure 11-5, and press OK.
 
 You see a thumbnail of your original image along with an after thumb-
nail, as shown in the second image in Figure 11-5.
 
3. Select the level of adjustment by pressing the Multi Selector up or down.
 
 You get three levels: Low, Normal, and High. I used High for the repair to 
my balloon image.
 
 
 To get a closer view of the adjusted photo, press and hold the Zoom In 
button. Release the button to return to the two-thumbnail display.
 
4. To go forward with the correction, press OK.
 
 The camera creates your retouched copy.

336
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Figure 11-5: Apply the D-Lighting filter via the Retouch menu.
 
You can’t apply D-Lighting to an image if you captured the photo with the 
Picture Control feature set to Monochrome. (See Chapter 6 for details on 
Picture Controls.) Nor does D-Lighting work on any pictures to which you’ve 
applied the Monochrome filter, detailed a little later in this chapter. 
Two Ways to Tweak Color
Chapter 6 explains how to use your camera’s White Balance and Picture 
Control features to manipulate photo colors. But even if you play with those 
settings all day, you may wind up with colors that you’d like to tweak just a 
tad. The Retouch menu offers two different tools for doing so: Through the 
Filter Effects option, you can apply a subtle warming effect, and through the 
Color Balance option, you can shift colors toward any part of the color spec-
trum and make a more pronounced color adjustment.
As an example, Figure 11-6 shows you an original image and three adjusted 
versions. As you can see, the Skylight and Warm filters are both very subtle; 
in this image, the effects are most noticeable in the sky. The fourth example 
shows a variation created by using the Color Balance filter and shifting colors 
toward the cool (bluish) side of the color spectrum.
To apply either filter, start by displaying your photo in single-frame playback 
mode and then press OK to display the Retouch menu over the photo. From 
there, proceed like so:
 
✓ Filter Effects: Select this filter, as shown on the left in Figure 11-7, and 
press OK to display the right screen. Choose Skylight to apply a subtle 
warming effect, similar to what you can produce by placing a traditional 
skylight filter over your lens. For a stronger — but still pretty subtle — 
warming effect, choose Warm instead. Press OK to display a preview of 
the effect. If you like what you see, press OK again to create the warmed-
up copy of the photo.

Figure 11-7: Both of these filters produce a slight warming effect; Warm creates a more 
pronounced result.

338
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
✓ Color Balance: Through this filter, featured in Figure 11-8, you can gain 
much more control over color adjustments. After you select the filter 
and press OK, you see a screen with a little color grid, as shown on the 
right in the figure.
 
 When the little black box is in the center of the grid, as in the figure, 
no color-balance adjustment has been applied. To manipulate colors, 
use the Multi Selector to move the black square in the direction of the 
color adjustment you want to make. The histograms on the right side of 
the display show you the resulting impact on overall image brightness, 
as well as on the individual red, green, and blue brightness values — a 
bit of information that’s helpful if you’re an experienced student in the 
science of reading histograms. (Chapter 4 gives you an introduction.) If 
not, just check the image preview to monitor your results. Press OK to 
create the color-adjusted copy of your photo.
Color shift marker
Figure 11-8: Press the Multi Selector to move the color-shift marker and adjust color balance.
Creating Monochrome Photos
With the Monochrome Picture Control feature covered in Chapter 6, you 
can shoot black-and-white photos. Technically, the camera takes a full-color 
picture and then strips it of color as it’s recording the image to the memory 
card, but the end result is the same.
As an alternative, you can create a black-and-white copy of an existing color 
photo by applying the Monochrome option on the Retouch menu. You can 
also create sepia and cyanotype (blue and white) images via the Monochrome 
option. Figure 11-9 shows you examples of all three effects.
 
I prefer to convert my color photos to monochrome images in my photo 
editor; going that route simply offers more control, not to mention the fact 
that it’s easier to preview your results on a large computer monitor than on 

339
 Chapter 11: Ten Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
the camera monitor. Still, I 
know that not everyone’s as 
much of a photo editing geek 
as I am, so I present to you 
here the steps involved in 
applying the Monochrome 
effects to a color original in 
your camera:
 
1. Display your photo in 
single-image view and 
press OK to bring the 
Retouch menu to life. 
 
2. Highlight Monochrome 
and press OK to display 
the three effect options, 
as shown in Figure 11-10.
 
3. Highlight the effect that 
you want to apply and 
press OK.
 
 You then see a preview 
of the image with your 
selected photo filter 
applied.
 
4. To adjust the intensity 
of the sepia or cyano-
type effect, press the 
Multi Selector up or down.
 
 No adjustment is available for the black-and-white filter.
 
5. Press OK to create the monochrome copy.

Cropping Your Photo
To crop a photo simply means to trim away some of its perimeter. Cropping 
away excess background can often improve an image, as illustrated by 
Figures 11-11 and 11-12. When shooting this scene, I couldn’t get close 
enough to the ducks to fill the frame with them, so I simply cropped it after 
the fact to achieve the desired composition.
Figure 11-11: The original contains too much extraneous background.
Figure 11-12: Cropping creates a better composition and 
eliminates background clutter.

341
 Chapter 11: Ten Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
With the Trim function on the Retouch menu, you can crop a photo right in 
the camera. Note a few things about this feature:
 
✓ You can crop your photo to five different aspect ratios: 3:2, which main-
tains the original proportions and matches that of a 4 x 6-inch print; 4:3, 
the proportions of a standard computer monitor or television (that is, 
not a wide-screen model); 5:4, which gives you the same proportions as 
an 8 x 10-inch print; 1:1, which results in a square photo; and 16:9, which 
is the same aspect ratio as images on a wide-screen movie. If your pur-
pose for cropping is to prepare your image for a frame size that doesn’t 
match any of these aspect ratios, crop in your photo software instead.
 
✓ For each aspect ratio, you can choose from six crop sizes. The sizes are 
stated in pixel terms — for example, if you select the 3:2 aspect ratio, 
you can crop the photo to measurements of 3424 x 2280 pixels, 2560 x 
1704 pixels, 1920 x 1280 pixels, 1280 x 856 pixels, 960 x 640 pixels, and 
640 x 424 pixels. 
 
✓ After you apply the Trim function, you can’t apply any other fixes from 
the Retouch menu. So make cropping the last of your retouching steps.
Keeping those caveats in mind, trim your image as follows:
 
1. Display your photo in single-image view and press OK to launch the 
Retouch menu.
 
2. Highlight Trim, as shown on the left in Figure 11-13, and press OK.
 
 Now you see a screen similar to the right side of the figure. The yellow 
highlight box indicates the current cropping frame. Anything outside the 
frame is set to be trimmed away.

3. Rotate the main command dial to change the crop aspect ratio.
 
 The selected aspect ratio appears in the upper-right corner of the 
screen, as shown in Figure 11-13.
 
4. Adjust the cropping frame size and placement as needed.
 
 The current crop size appears in the upper-left corner of the screen. 
(Refer to Figure 11-13.) You can adjust the size and placement of the 
cropping frame like so:
 
 
• Reduce the size of the cropping frame. Press and release the Zoom 
Out button. Each press of the button further reduces the crop size.
 
 
• Enlarge the cropping frame. Press the Zoom In button to expand the 
crop boundary and leave more of your image intact.
 
• Reposition the cropping frame. Press the Multi Selector up, down, 
right, and left to shift the frame position.
 
5. Press OK to create your cropped copy of the original image.
Two Roads to a Multi-Image Exposure
The D300s offers two features that enable you to combine multiple photo-
graphs into one:
 
✓ Multiple Exposure (Shooting menu): With this option, you can combine 
your next two to ten shots. After you enable the option and take your 
shots, the camera merges them into one NEF (RAW) file. The shots used 
to create the composite aren’t recorded and saved separately.
 
✓ Image Overlay (Retouch menu): This option enables you to merge two 
RAW images that already exist on the memory card. I used this option 
to combine a photo of a werewolf friend, shown on the top left in Figure 
11-14, with a nighttime garden scene, shown on the top right. The result 
is the ghostly image shown beneath the two originals. Oooh, scary!
On the surface, both options sound kind of cool. The problem is that you 
can’t control the opacity or positioning of the individual images in the com-
bined photo. For example, my overlay picture would have been more suc-
cessful if I could move the werewolf to the left in the combined image so that 
he and the lantern aren’t blended. And I’d also prefer to keep the background 
of image 2 at full opacity in the overlay image rather than getting a 50-50 mix 
of that background and the one in image 1, which only creates a fuzzy looking 
background in this particular example.

343
 Chapter 11: Ten Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
Figure 11-14: Image Overlay merges two RAW (NEF) photos into one.
However, there is one effect that you can create successfully with either 
option: a “two views” composite like the one in Figure 11-15. For this image, I 
used Image Overlay to combine the front and rear views of the antique match 
striker. But in order for this trick to work, the background in both images 
must be the same solid color (black seems to be best) and you must com-
pose your photos so that the subjects don’t overlap in the combined photo, 
as shown here. Otherwise, you get the ghostly portrait effect like what you 
see in my example.
To be honest, I don’t use Image Overlay or Multiple Exposure for the purpose 
of serious photo compositing. I prefer to do this kind of work in my photo 
editing software, where I have more control over the blend. Understand, too, 
that neither feature is designed to produce an HDR (high dynamic range) 
image, which lifts different brightness ranges from different images to create 
the composite. For HDR, you need software that can do tone mapping, not 
just whole-image blending. (See the Chapter 5 section related to exposure 
bracketing for more about HDR.)

344
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
Figure 11-15: If you want each subject to appear solid, use a black background and position 
the subjects so that they don’t overlap.
In the interest of reserving space in this book for features that I think you will 
find much more useful, I leave you to explore these two on your own. (The 
manual explains the steps involved in using each of them.) Again, though, I 
think that you’ll find photo compositing much easier and much more flexible 
if you do the job in your photo editing software.
Exploring Automated Time-Lapse Photography
You can use the Interval Timer Shooting feature to automatically capture a 
series of pictures over a given period of time. The common photo lingo for 
this type of capture is time-lapse photography. Here’s how to do it:
 
1. Set the Release mode to any setting but Self-Timer or Mirror Up.
 
 Those modes aren’t compatible with interval-timing shooting.
 
2. Display the Shooting menu, highlight Interval Timer Shooting as 
shown on the left in Figure 11-16, and press OK.
 
 The screen on the right in Figure 11-16 appears.

345
 Chapter 11: Ten Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
 
3. To begin setting up your capture session, highlight Now or Start Time.
 
• If you want to start the captures right away, highlight Now, as 
shown on the right in Figure 11-16.
 
• To set a later start time for the captures, highlight Start Time.
Figure 11-16: The Interval Timing feature enables you to do time-lapse photography.
 
4. Press the Multi Selector right to display the capture-setup screen.
 
 If you selected Start Time in Step 3, the screen looks like the one in 
Figure 11-17. If you selected Now, the Start Time option is dimmed, and 
the Interval option is highlighted instead.
 
5. Set up your recording session.
Start Time
Interval
Number of Intervals/Shots per Interval
Figure 11-17: Press the Multi Selector right or 
left to cycle through the setup options; press 
up or down to change the highlighted value.

346
Part IV: The Part of Tens 
 
 You get three options: Start Time, Interval (time between shots), and 
Number of Intervals and Number of Shots per Interval (determines total 
number of shots recorded). The current settings for each option appear 
in the bottom half of the screen, as labeled in Figure 11-17.
 
 At the top of the screen, little value boxes appear. The highlighted box 
is the active option and relates to the setting that’s highlighted at the 
bottom of the screen. For example, in the figure, the hour box for the 
Start Time setting is active. Press the Multi Selector right or left to cycle 
through the value boxes; to change the value in a box, press the Multi 
Selector up or down.
 
 A few notes about your options:
 
• The Interval and Start Time options are based on a 24-hour clock. 
(The current time appears in the bottom-right corner of the screen 
and is based upon the date/time information you entered when set-
ting up the camera.)
 
• For the Interval option, the left column box is for the hour setting; 
the middle, minutes; and the right, seconds. Make sure that the 
value you enter is longer than the shutter speed you plan to use.
 
• For the Start Time option, you can set the hour and minute values 
only. Again, the Start Time option is available only if you selected 
Start Time in Step 3.
 
• The Number of Intervals value multiplied by the Number of Shots 
per interval determines how many pictures will be recorded.
 
6. When you’re done setting up 
the capture options, press the 
Multi Selector right until you 
see the On and Off options 
on the screen, as shown in 
Figure 11-18.
 
7. Highlight On and press OK.
 
 If you selected Now as your inter-
val-capture starting option, the 
first shot is recorded about three 
seconds later. If you set a delayed 
start time, the camera displays a 
“Timer Active” message for a few 
seconds and before returning to 
the Shooting menu.
Figure 11-18: Highlight On and press OK to 
finalize the Interval Timing setup.

347
 Chapter 11: Ten Features to Explore on a Rainy Day
A few final factoids:
 
✓ Interrupting interval shooting: Just press the OK button between inter-
vals or bring up the Interval Timing menu screen, highlight Start/Pause, 
and press OK. If you later want to resume the interval shooting, highlight 
Restart and press OK. To cancel interval timing altogether, select Start/
Off and press OK.
 
✓ Bracketing: You can apply automatic bracketing during interval shoot-
ing. See Chapter 5 to find out what bracketing is all about.
 
✓ Autofocusing: If you’re using autofocusing, be sure that the camera can 
focus on your subject. It will initiate focusing before each shot, and by 
default, won’t record a picture if focusing can’t be achieved. See Chapter 
6 for details about autofocusing.
