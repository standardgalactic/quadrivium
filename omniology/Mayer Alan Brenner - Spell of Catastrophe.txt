Chapter1
MAX ON THE ROAD
THE AIR WAS THICK and the heat
oppressive. Outside the ﬂap of canvas
that covered the doorway, a vast range
of beige desert overlaid by a scattering
of scrub ran to the horizon. The line
of dust raised by the approach of the
caravan hung motionless in the air,
stretching south from the oasis into a
cluster of low hills. Max dropped the

ﬂap, turned, and descended the short
ﬂight of steps, his eyes still smarting
from the desert sun.
Each stair had
the solidity of rough board, reassuring
after the sands of the past few days, ex-
cept for the bottom one, which yielded
under Max’s foot in a very unstairlike
fashion. He rocked back and squinted
down. The stair shifted in the gloom
and became a man dressed in loose
dark clothes sprawled out on the ﬂoor,
burbling pleasantly from somewhere
in a comprehensive stupor. By the look
of him, he might be burbling still when
the caravan passed through the next
time, heading south again at the end of
its run. That probably meant the local
rotgut was either very tasty or very
dangerous.
Max stepped across the
man and proceeded across the room.
At the other end of the room was a
bar, on which Max rested an elbow. The

room itself occupied a natural gully in
the rock next to the oasis, covered over
with a heavy canvas tent. Cables ran
from eyebolts driven into the rocks up
to timbers that supported the canvas
roof.
Another caravan had been parked
at the oasis when Max had arrived,
but most of its crew had not been in
evidence. They were certainly missing
no longer. Gently reeling forms were
propped in chairs and on tables, and
piled in low mounds on the rock ﬂoor.
An arm wrestling match was in pro-
cess at one side, deep in the shifting
green haze from a half-dozen gutter-
ing candles.
The bartender emerged
from a shadow behind the counter and
pushed a mug at Max. "You know any
good ruins around here?" Max said to
him. A hefty growl from the other end
of the bar drowned out any reply. The

man behind the growl, Max discovered
as he turned to eye him, was about
seven feet tall, and waving a trestle
table over his head with one massively
corded arm. "You want another drink?"
Max said. "I’ll buy you another drink."
The guy growled and hefted the ta-
ble.
"Okay," Max said, "no drink." It
was just as well, as the bartender had
managed to conveniently disappear
from sight. Behind the counter, framed
by several large boulders, was a cave
containing stacks of large kegs.
The
upper lip of the cave formed a nar-
row ledge overhead. Dangling in front
of the ledge over the bar was a line
of additional kegs, lashed together in
threes and suspended by cables from
pulleys. The cables ran down to a rack
of marlinspikes in the rock at the end
of the bar, just on the other side of the
counter from Max, in fact. The giant

swung the table again and took a bead
on Max.
"Don’t be ridiculous," Max said. "It’s
too hot for this kind of nonsense." The
man reared up with the table.
"All
right, then," said Max, "have it your
way." Max leaned over the counter, se-
lected one cable, grasped it ﬁrmly with
his right hand, and sharply cocked his
right wrist. A blade sprung out of his
sleeve below his palm and slashed the
rope. Max rose swiftly into the air as
the trio of lashed kegs at the other end
of the bar equally swiftly descended.
The kegs struck the waving table, the
table overbalanced as its wielder lost
his grip, and with one loud thud and
a trio of lesser thuds the table hit the
giant’s head and the kegs again hit the
table.
All collapsed in a clatter and
small cloud of dust.
A ﬁnal two shards fell to the ﬂoor,

there was a moment of silence, and
then the unmistakable sound of a con-
tented snore arose from deep within
the heap.
Max swung from the rope onto the
ledge over the bar and seated him-
self. He sipped at his drink, which he
had retained in his left hand, and slid
the knife back into its spring-loaded
sheath. "Fortunately for you," he said
down at the pile of wreckage, "it is far
too hellish out here to get involved in
serious exertion." After another week
at the outside the caravan would be
clear of the desert, he thought, and
then it was a straight shot across the
plains to Drest Klaaver, where at last
report Shaa was hiding out.
He was
looking forward to seeing Shaa again.
If Shaa didn’t try to kill him on sight,
that is.
The bartender had reemerged from

his hiding-place.
"So what about the
ruins?" Max called down.
"Ruins?" the man said, looking out
at the room. "Whaddaya need more ru-
ins, what you did here isn’t enough for
you?"
FOR A CHANGE, Max was not ac-
tually on the run, which is to say that
he didn’t think anyone in particular
was after him. Of course, his percep-
tion (which happened to be wrong) did
not materially change the situation.
He did indeed have a pursuer, and
later that night the pursuer caught up.
The large moon was up, too, along
with some of the small fast ones. Max
dangled his legs over the tailboard of
the rear wagon, watching ground pass
in the pale light. A large shaggy form
loped around the wagon and hoisted it-
self next to him. "I still say you should
have hacked him into little pieces," the

shaggy hulk said. "If you could have
waited for me, I would have hacked
him into little pieces."
"All the time with you, Svin, it’s
ﬁght, ﬁght, ﬁght, hack, hack, hack,"
Max said. "I’m not going to say your
philosophy may not be superior, and it
certainly has the virtue of simplicity,
but by the same token -"
"It is the course of honor, the only
true path for a warrior born," Svin said
with a note of ﬁnality.
"That’s ﬁne as far as it goes," Max
said, "but not all of us are warriors
born. Some of us subscribe to the pos-
sibility of old age instead."
Svin thought that over.
Shadows
passed over the large moon - three cir-
cling dwarf buzzards, moonlight shim-
mering on their feathers. The smallest
one swooped down to have a look at
them, its ten-foot wingspan draping a

darker black over the rocks. "Look at
that thing," Max said, waving his hand
at it.
"It’s got a body to feed, but it
manages ﬁne without a lot of hacking
and slashing. I don’t know how much
of a goal in life those things have, but
they seem to get by pretty well on a
more passive lifestyle."
"Where do you think it ﬁnds enough
to eat?" Svin, perhaps because of a
Northern metabolism honed in the icy
wastes, was perpetually hungry.
"There’s always carrion around some-
where, if you know where to look for
it and you’re willing to do what you’ve
got to do."
Svin shook his head. "Carrion, Max,
is for lesser beings.
We will die in
battle, as a man should, and go tri-
umphant to meet the gods."
Max, who had met some of the gods,
had not been impressed.
"Watch out

for remarks like that, Svin, you never
know who’s listening."
"Fah!" Svin said. "What does it mat-
ter if -" Max heard a mufﬂed ’clunk’
next to him. Svin began to raise one
hand to his head, then fell over back-
ward into the cart. A heavily thatched
arrow with a ﬂat blunt head dropped
into his lap. Max pushed off the tail-
gate and landed silently behind a rock.
The wagons began to clatter and jangle
away down the path.
A low voice buried in a reedy gargle
came from the same direction as the
arrow. "Honor have addressing I Max-
imillian, Vaguely Disreputable?"
Max
raised
himself
slightly
and
squinted over the rock.
Back there in the gloom, he thought
he could make out two glowing orange
sparks, spaced at the right separation
for eyes. "... You’re Haddo," he said.

"Haddo am I. Serve I Great Karlini.
You come?"
Karlini?
"Yes, I’ll come," Max said.
"Of course I’ll come. Just let me get my
stuff." He got up and sprinted after the
wagons.
Svin was breathing, and a large
lump was forming on his forehead
not far above his nose.
Max shook
him, without noticeable effect, then
rolled him into a more secure position
deeper inside the wagon. Shaking his
own head, Max found his two packs,
slipped the larger one onto his back,
and jumped to the ground. The cara-
van moved away behind him. The pair
of orange eyes approached.
"You were a little rough on poor Svin
back there," Max said, handing Haddo
his arrow.
"Situation’s nature was unsure I."
"Yes, well, I suppose they don’t make

barbarians like they used to, either."
"Considerate you are," Haddo said,
indicating the arrow, which then dis-
appeared inside a sleeve. The glowing
orange spots (which Max assumed
were eyes, for want of a better expla-
nation) ﬂoated in the opening of a
hooded black cloak.
The moonlight
failed to penetrate the opening, and
in fact seemed to make little impres-
sion on the surface of the cloak either.
"Thanks give I."
Haddo glided off into the desert to
the west. Max followed. "Nice bit of
shooting, though, Haddo."
"In practice, I."
" ... So how is everything, Haddo?"
"Problems. Always are problems."
" ... Are you going to tell me what’s
up, or do I have to wiggle your tongue
myself?"
"To wiggle, ﬁrst must ﬁnd," said the

featureless black hood.
"Karlini will
tell."
"Where is Karlini?"
"Days by foot. Trackless are wastes."
Max sighed.
More time stomping
through the desert.
"In the old days,
they had machines, Haddo, machines
that could have -"
"Old days gone.
Matter not.
Still
now, things not bad."
"I wouldn’t exactly call walking for
days through trackless wastes ’not
bad’."
Haddo sounded smug. "Said I only
distance by foot. Did not say by foot we
go. Brought I bird."
THEY REACHED THE BIRD be-
fore dawn.
Max and Haddo climbed
yet another hard-packed rise in the
false light, watching for more of the
thorny succulents that had already
snagged the strap off the pack Max

was toting in his hand. At the bottom
of the down slope below the rise was a
dark rounded sand dune. Haddo scam-
pered down the slope and whistled a
low trilling whistle. The dune stirred
and rose. It was the bird.
Only major cities and other big-time
operators usually kept the big buz-
zards, which might mean that Kar-
lini had come up substantially in life
since Max had seen him last.
The
buzzards ate a lot, but not being es-
pecially concerned about their menus,
each one could serve quite adequately
as a refuse disposal department for a
metropolitan area. Among the species
of giant birds, they were also about
the dumbest.
No one needed much
intelligence from a bird, of course, but
it was helpful if the bird had the at-
tention span to remember what it was
doing through to the end of its current

task. The buzzards were particularly
notorious for getting distracted during
ofﬁcial state visits or large pageants
and unexpectedly taking off for their
ancestral breeding grounds, often bear-
ing with them several surprised dig-
nitaries. Farthrax the Muniﬁcent had
been crowned Emperor, in fact, after
returning, the better part of a year
later, from the mountains where the
breeding took place.
He had always
refused to talk about it, but the gen-
eral amazement over his return was
enough to cement him as a favorite of
the gods.
"Is this thing safe?" Max said.
"Through trackless wastes rather
walk you?" Haddo said.
He resumed whispering in the bird’s
ear slit. Max grabbed a dangling rope
and climbed aboard. Haddo scratched
behind a feather, patted the bird on

the side of the head, and came back.
Max helped him swing into the saddle
in front of him, forward on the body be-
tween the wing roots. The bird stood,
hopped up and down tentatively a few
times, ﬂared its neck feathers, and
ﬂopped down again.
"Nothing say you," Haddo muttered.
He screeched at the bird.
The bird
screeched back, then lurched to its feet.
Max checked the belt holding him in
the saddle.
The buzzard fanned its
wings, broke into a run, strode up the
ridge, and hopped into the air.
The sun rose as the bird circled,
gliding and gradually gaining altitude.
Thermals and whirling dust devils
sprouted from the desert ﬂoor.
The
bird began to move in earnest, gaining
speed with precise ﬂicks of its wingtips,
spiraling up one thermal and launch-
ing itself across the desert to the next.

Around noon a line of craggy hills
appeared in the northwest, and later
in the afternoon the hills were rolling
in a picturesque but jagged scroll be-
neath the broad wings. The hills were
as barren as the desert, but the ex-
posed rocks displayed colorful strata of
red and purple and bright yellow. The
shadows lengthened and the colors of
the rock had begun to glow with deeper
hues when Max suddenly thought he
smelled damp salt. "Haddo," Max said.
"Not
to
bother,"
Haddo
snapped.
"Landing procedure complex is." A
salt lake grew underneath, tucked into
the folds of the hills, silent and smooth
in the still air.
The buzzard banked
around a peak and headed for an is-
land.
The island was covered with
buildings - no, a castle.
Then Max took a closer look.
The
castle was not on an island, the cas-

tle was the island. Walls and towers
dropped smoothly into the lake and
the upper part of one ring of crenel-
lations protruded from the water like
a reef of stepping stones, the top of
each rectangular block barely awash.
The bird circled once around the cen-
tral cluster of towers, gauging the air
currents,
abruptly nosed over,
and
dived.
It pulled up just above a ﬂag-
pole, sideslipped onto a walled ﬁeld,
ran a few steps, and settled to the
ground.
Max helped Haddo down and fol-
lowed him to the front of the bird, feel-
ing like the ﬂagstones of the courtyard
were executing sharp banks beneath
his feet. Haddo whistled something at
the bird, letting Max scratch under its
neck.
After a moment, Max gingerly
straightened. "Okay, Haddo," he said.
"Thanks for the ﬂight. Now what about

Karlini?"
Haddo gave a ﬁnal remark to the
bird.
"Here wait," he said to Max,
and staggered off through a doorway.
Someone passed him coming out, the
someone wrinkling his nose fastidi-
ously.
"Wroclaw!" Max said.
"Nice to see
you again."
"Very good to see you, sir." Wroclaw’
s gaunt skin was an olive-drab green,
and his bones were of not quite human
proportions.
His ancestors had been
conjured, one way or another, but that
wasn’t something usually discussed in
polite company. "Are you ﬁt, sir?"
"That remains to be seen. I suspect
it depends on what Karlini wants out
of me."
Wroclaw coughed discretely.
"Very
good, sir. Will you see the master now?"
"I hope so, Wroclaw, I really do."

"Ahem, yes," Wroclaw said, "sir. Will
you follow me, please?" Crossing the
doorway,
Max’s hair crackled with
static and he caught a whiff of ozone.
Inside the corridor, though, the air was
much cooler and the tang of salt was
much less apparent.
"Do you know what I’m doing here,
Wroclaw?" Max said.
Wroclaw rounded a corner and came
to a stop at the entrance to a cramped
circular staircase.
"Any idea I might
possess," Wroclaw said,
"would un-
doubtedly be less than the complete
truth.
The master is, as always, the
best person with whom to raise the
matter."
A raven cawed faintly seven times,
somewhere off in another wing.
"Oh,
goodness," Wroclaw said. "Time for din-
ner already. Please wait here, sir, the
master will be along shortly.
Alas, I

ﬁnd myself also serving as the cook."
"Very well, Wroclaw." Max leaned
on a stone windowsill across the stair-
case and watched shadows creep up
the hills. One hill had gone into total
eclipse by the time a ﬁgure bounded
down the stairs toward him, running
one hand through its hair. "The Great
Karlini, I presume," Max said, "and if
you don’t tell me what’s up very quickly
I’ll turn you into a carp and eat you,
raw.”
"Oh, good, Max, it is you," said the
Great Karlini, pushing hair out of his
eyes. "Haddo is certainly faithful, but
his eyesight isn’t quite perfect and
we’re never too sure what he’ll bring
back."
"That robe needs to be washed."
Karlini looked down and started, ap-
parently noticing the cluster of fresh
stains for the ﬁrst time.
"Good old

Max," he said.
"How do I manage
without you?"
"That depends on what you’ve gotten
yourself into this time."
Karlini dropped an arm across Max’s
shoulders and led him down the stairs.
"So, Max, how have you been?"
Max stopped.
"That’s it," he said.
"I’m out of here. See you later."
"Max, now don’t -"
Max crossed his arms.
"Look, Kar-
lini, you get me dragged all the way
out here, ruining a perfectly good if
somewhat arid caravan trip, and then
you won’t tell me why.
Haddo won’t
talk, Wroclaw won’t talk, you won’t
talk. You know what that says to me?
What that says to me is that you want
me to do something that probably in-
volves human sacriﬁce, and I bet we
both know who’s the relevant human."
Karlini sat down next to him on the

stair.
"Don’t glower at me like that,
Max. It’s not that bad, but it is a long
story. Actually, it’s not that long a story,
but it’s sort of -”
"Karlini."
"All right, all right. You noticed the
castle?"
"Yeah, sure. Looks like a nice place."
"Well . . . it’s okay."
"So, what’s wrong with it? It have
rats? Things?"
"It’s not what it has," Karlini said,
"it’s what it does. It moves."
"Moves."
"Not like earthquakes, I mean, or
settling ground. I mean you wake up
in the morning and the whole castle’s
jumped somewhere else. It’s been here
for almost two weeks, but before that,
it was bounce, bounce, bounce.
Just
enough time to get an idea where we
are, and then, poof!, another hemi-

sphere. Last month we spent six days
somewhere around the North Pole. We
almost froze. I’m just waiting for this
thing to head for the open ocean."
"I assume we’ll get to the real point
when you tell me why you can’t get rid
of the place. You got a problem with
the landlord?"
Karlini looked suspiciously at Max.
"You sure you haven’t heard about this
before?" Max shook his head, no. Kar-
lini sighed. "Well, that’s the problem,
all right. It won’t let me get rid of it. I
can’t even walk out the door.”

Chapter2
THE CREEPING
SWORD
AT THE SAME TIME Haddo was
ﬂying Max toward Karlini’s castle I
was sitting at my desk minding my
own business, the major thought on
my mind being whether I’d be able to
afford to eat after the day after tomor-
row. There was no way I would have

known about Max and Haddo at that
point, of course, but I wouldn’t have
cared anyway since I’d never heard of
Haddo or Max or Karlini. Food was the
issue, and realizing it was already past
the middle of the day and I hadn’t had
a customer in a week, and wondering
how hungry I’d have to get before I’d
be walking the streets looking for odd
jobs and manual labor. Then someone
knocked on the door.
I put the half-
drained ﬂask I had been nursing in a
drawer and said, "Come in.”
A woman came in.
"My husband
has been kidnapped," she said, and
that meant all of a sudden things were
looking up.
Her husband had a large warehouse
on the docks and a ﬂeet of barges on the
river. He hadn’t come home the previ-
ous night. According to her, he had al-
ways come home before. A note had ap-

peared under the door in the morning.
She passed it over to me.
Payment of 20,000 gold zalous will
cause the return of Edrik Skargool. He
is not hurt, yet search will cause death.
More instructions will forthcome.
The Creeping Sword
"Huh," I said. The style was stilted,
making me think of someone who was
trying to sound educated without the
beneﬁt of actually having an education.
On the other hand, the words were
spelled right and the penmanship was
neat.
Still, I didn’t have to look too
closely to ﬁnd the major unusual detail.
The medium was a sheet of burnished
copper, and the words had apparently
been etched into it with ﬁre.
"Do you have any idea who this
Creeping Sword is?" I asked.

"Certainly not, of course not," she
said. "That is your job, isn’t it?"
I made a noncommittal sort of hrrump
sound and let her start talking again.
She had gone to the police, such as
they were. With the current political
situation, the police weren’t about to
investigate anything, unless the order
came as a command from the Guard.
So she’d gone to the Guard. The Guard
was having too much fun enforcing
martial law to worry about another
kidnapping.
The only kidnappings
they were interested in were the ones
they were doing themselves. I hoped
for Skargool’s sake they weren’t the
ones who had picked him up. I wasn’t
about to ﬁght the Guard for him, even
if she paid me a lot, and I didn’t think
anyone else would be prepared to ei-
ther. "Will you ﬁnd him?" she asked.
"I’ll do my best," I said, "under the

circumstances. That’s my job."
She made an unhappy face at me.
Sometimes that was a good tactic - I’m
a man, and like any man I’ll turn gooey
under the right circumstances - but it
wasn’t going to work on me this time.
I already didn’t like her. "If I pay you
good money and give you my trust,"
she said, "I would expect that you
would at least be willing to guarantee
-"
I had been leaning back in my chair.
Now I let the chair fall forward so the
two front legs hit the beam ﬂoor with
a sharp "thud", and pointed a ﬁnger at
her for further emphasis. "Look, lady,"
I said. "Roosing Oolvaya is a big city.
There must be ﬁfty thousand people
here. Any day of the week a bunch of
them disappear and never get found.
Now we’re sitting with a dead Vener-
ance, the son who probably knocked

him off is in charge, and mercenaries
are running around the streets giving
orders to the rest of the normal Guard.
You think the mess out there doesn’t
make the usual mess worse? Well, it
does, lady, a lot worse. People are get-
ting rounded up, people are getting ex-
ecuted, and people are getting kicked
into the sewers just for being in the
wrong place.
Not criminals, not only
political folks, just people, you under-
stand that? In this kind of situation,
a lot of old grudges ﬁnd themselves
getting settled, a lot of nastiness pops
up. It’s rough out there."
"But." she said, still pouting, "but
what should I do, then?"
"If you hire me, I’ll ﬁnd your hus-
band if he’s ﬁndable.
Are you hiring
me?"
"Yes, yes, of course I am, even if -”
“Then get ready to pay this Sword

person."
"But 20,000 zalous! How could I -"
"I’ll get you the money back if I can."
"But can’t you bargain with -"
"You might reﬂect," I said, "on the
fact that money can generally take
more wear and tear than husbands
can."
She shut up. I asked questions, but
none of the answers were helpful. She
didn’t know of any disgruntled employ-
ees. The list of business enemies was
short; she said her husband had a rep-
utation as a straight dealer. They had
no children.
"Who gets everything if he dies?" I
said.
"Why, I’m not sure.
I really don’t
know."
I had yelled down for a messenger
earlier, after the scent of work had
ﬂoated in with her, and the messenger

now returned with Turbot. Turbot was
in more-or-less the same line of work
as me, whatever that was, and we used
each other as backup man when things
were happening. He was glad to have
something to do that might pay, at
least as glad as me. As the wife was
leaving in Turbot’s custody she paused
and looked back.
"Will you ﬁnd him?" she repeated.
"Yeah, I’ll ﬁnd him," I said. I strapped
on my sword and headed for the man’s
warehouse.
SKARGOOL CARGO WAS A HULK
ING TWO-STORY BUILDING with
heavy timber walls attached to its own
wharf.
The manager was a hulking
man named Kardu Chog.
He wasn’t
attached to a wharf, but one ﬁnger was
brandishing a ring with a stone the
size of a rowboat.
"Me, I was ﬁrst mate on the ﬁrst

barge Skargool ever sailed," Chog said
expansively around a cylinder that
looked like a cigar but smelled a lot
more like a swamp after a range ﬁre.
Tobacco leaves were one of the things
Skargool imported,
shipped up the
river from the south. "First mate, aye,
and crew too. The two of us, like broth-
ers." He waved at the humidor on his
desk, offered me a cigar. I shook my
head. He shrugged and took a massive
pull on his own, a line of solid ash ad-
vancing toward his mouth. "Skargool
and me, we go way back.”
"What about his wife?" I said.
"What do you mean," he said slowly,
"about his wife?"
"His wife.
How long does she go
back?"
Chog leaned back in his chair and
squinted up through the smoke. "Mind
you now, I don’t really know her, but

she’s been around now for, oh, ﬁve
years, six. Why are you interested?"
"Just asking questions," I said. "Part
of the job." I poked around, checking in
with the workmen.
From all accounts, Edrik Skargool
was indeed that rare thing, a rich boss
well liked by his employees. Another
relevant fact also came to light: Skar-
gool walked home daily, along the same
route.
I left the warehouse, crossed the
street, and entered the dive on the
other side;
step out on any street
around the wharves and there was
bound to be a bar within arm’s reach.
When my drink came I laid an ool next
to it. "The Skargool place," I said.
"Yeah?" said the bartender.
"Anybody seem interested in it?" I
spun another ool in the air.
The bartender licked his lip and

thought, then shook his head sadly,
eying the ool on the counter. I pushed
it toward him. "Let me know," I said,
and told him how to ﬁnd me.
I worked my way along.
From the
feel of the kidnap note this thing had
been a job worked out in advance, not a
bit of random work popped on the spur
of the moment. The Creeping Sword,
whoever or whatever he was or they
were, would have hung around getting
a handle on Skargool’s movements,
and might even still be keeping an eye
on things.
Maybe somebody had no-
ticed something. It wasn’t a real good
bet - the waterfront was always ﬁlled
with transients, and with the number
of out-of-town ﬁghters bolstering the
Guard things were bound to be worse,
but maybe one of the regulars had an
eye open. 1f nothing else, the Creeping
Sword might hear I was asking ques-

tions and go after me. Coming out of
the fourth bar I felt a bump and tug at
my side. Attached to the touch was an
arm. I grabbed it as the kid tried to
twist away. He was somebody I knew.
"How’s business, Glinko?" I said.
Glinko looked around at me and
turned white. "It’s you," he said.
I shook him up and down a few times.
"Yeah, Glinko, it’s me," I said. "You’re
losing your touch. You’re also turning
into an idiot."
"I didn’t know it was you," he said
plaintively.
"Save it.
Just as well you’re here.
Maybe you can do something for me."
A look of calculation appeared.
I
shook him again,
then opened my
hand and dropped him.
The street
was muddy. The streets were always
muddy. "You didn’t have to do that," he
said.

"You didn’t have to try to pick my
purse, either.
Fortunately for you, I
generally take the long view." I showed
him an ool out of Skargool’s wife’s ad-
vance.
Glinko stopped trying to clean him-
self off. The coin interested him. Coins
always interested him. Coins interest
most of us. "Who cares about mud any-
way?" he said. "What do you need?”
"The Creeping Sword," I said.
"The who?"
"That’s what I want to know. This
Sword kidnapped a businessman."
"Skargool?" Glinko said.
"Yeah," I said, "that’s right. Tell me
about it."
"You going to give me that?" he said,
meaning the ool.
"You going to give me a reason to?"
He glanced around the street, then
slipped around the corner of the bar

into a narrow alley.
The street had
only been about three times the width
of the alley, but except for us the alley
was empty. "I know Skargool," Glinko
said in a low voice, "I know most of the
guys down here.
That’s what I do, I
keep an eye out." Glinko was a spotter
for one of the thief-gangs. "Skargool’s
a right guy, pays good, he’s good to
the workers, you know? Half the guys
around want to work for him. Then a
couple of weeks ago a lot of bad talk
started.
A ship of his was late, see,
and all of a sudden there’s talk like
Skargool might have sold the crew to
the slavers. That’s how it started. Last
I saw him was two days ago. He was
walking home. He didn’t look good. He
looked real depressed. Now today he’s
missing, it’s all around the street."
"Okay." I gave him the ool. He said
he’d nose around for me and check in

later. He went back to the street, and I
slipped out the other end of the alley.
I tried a few more bars without much
more luck and ended up at the Grumpy
Gullet. Civil unrest or no, Slipron was
there, at his usual table in the back. I
handed him the kidnap note Skargool’s
wife had given me.
Slipron screwed a lens into one eye,
Oolvayan glass in a bone housing, and
scrutinized the engraving, rubbing the
copper plate between two ﬁngers. Then
he tapped the plate with a ﬁngernail
and swiveled the lens up at me. "It’s
worthless, of course, excepting perhaps
only the metal itself."
Slipron being the best fence in Roos-
ing Oolvaya, his comment meant he
could move the thing for a proﬁt and
was willing to bargain, but selling it
was not what I had in mind at the
moment. I told him so.

"Ah," Slipron said. "Well. This en-
graving is not professional work." He
rested a ﬁnger across the inscribed
wards and closed his eyes.
The let-
ters around his ﬁnger swam brieﬂy.
He brought the plate up to his face
and sniffed.
"A ﬁrepen.
Deﬁnitely a
ﬁrepen."
The tapster was passing with a tray
of foaming mugs, and I snagged a full
one for Slipron.
He handed me back
the ransom note.
"I know of Edrik
Skargool, and I consider him a good
man," Slipron said.
"I also note the
line of this letter that reads ’Search
will cause death’."
"I ﬁgure they’re talking about search
by sorcery," I said.
If an anti-search
spell had been set up around Skargool,
any ﬁnder probe keyed to him would
set up feedback in the protector ﬁeld,
feedback that might be enough to fry

him. Whether the Creeping Sword had
the facility or the money to get a spell
like that was another matter. I thought
it was a bluff.
Even if it was a bluff
and a sorcerous search might ﬁnd Skar-
gool, hiring a magician to run a decent
search would cost a lot more than my
own time. If it wasn’t a bluff, and the
magician wasn’t good enough to avoid
or neutralize the no-search ﬁeld, that
would be it for Skargool.
Of course, I wouldn’t hire a magician.
I wouldn’t even go near magic unless it
grabbed me by the neck and forced my
nose into it. Magic is more trouble than
it’s worth. It messes up everybody’s life.
It had messed up my own life enough
in the past to give me more of an educa-
tion than I’d ever wanted. No, all this
case needed was legwork, and legwork
I know.
Slipron said.
"What if they don’t

care what kind of search it is, and
they Sword people spot you looking for
him?"
"Give me a little credit," I said. "This
is my job, and I know what I’m doing. I
know how to be careful."
Slipron looked doubtful.
A chair
scraped next to us, and a gust of gar-
lic announced the arrival of Gag the
Hairless. The name went back to the
time when the bladder of gas Gag had
been using to blow open the strong-
box aboard a barge had blown up in
his hand instead. His hair had grown
back around the ﬂash-burn scars, but a
name is a name. "The word’s out you’re
looking for a snatcher," Gag said.
"Sure," I said, "why not? Have you
got one?"
"Who knows?" Gag said.
"This
town’s so crowded this week, you can’t
keep anybody straight."

I tossed him an ool.
Fortunately
for me, Skargool’s wife was paying ex-
penses. Gag ﬂagged the barmaid. The
barmaid brought him a bottle, which
Gag upended, wiping green froth off
his mustache.
He burped, and said,
"Okay, now," leaning forward on one
elbow. "A guy hears lots of things. You
don’t always know what to think, you
know what I mean? This guy Skargool,
one day you hear one thing, then you
hear something else.
One day every-
body wants to work for him, the next
day you hear he’s ﬂogging his crews."
Slipron, whose attention had appar-
ently wandered off to another part of
the room, looked back at Gag.
"Flog-
ging?"
"Yeah, ﬂogging," Gag said, "I mean
like with whips.
All these years he’s
shipping grain, oats, like, and then all
of a sudden they say there’s always

been loot underneath.
Treasure, I
mean, gold, jewels, real loot.
Buried
under the oats, all these years. I mean,
I’ve got nothing against oats, I’ve got
to eat too, but oats isn’t the same as
loot."
"That’s an interesting story, Gag," I
said. "Now work the Creeping Sword
into it."
"You out of your mind?" Gag said.
"What’s that?"
"That’s what I’d like to know.
You
ﬁnd it out and it’s worth money."
"How’s about a, whatta you call it, a
retainer?"
"I’ll pay," I said, "when I have some-
thing to pay for. Don’t push your luck.
You hear plenty of stuff, Gag, and that’s
good.
Find out who started this talk
about Skargool."
Gag scowled and drained the bottle.
I had been keeping an eye on the rest

of the room, watching for someone else,
and now he came in, heading straight
for a small table in the back of the
place in a corner mostly in shadow. I
rose and went over. A steaming casse-
role was already present on the table,
and the guy was digging into it by the
time I crossed the room.
I pulled up a chair across from him.
"I want to talk to your boss," I said.
He didn’t bother to look up; I was
sure he’d spotted me on my way over.
He didn’t miss much, that’s why he had
the job he had.
"Are you on a case,"
the man said, swallowing a mouthful
off his knife, "or you just looking for
some action?"
"It’s a case."
He grunted, pulled a piece of ﬁsh
out of the casserole, squinted at it, and
threw it over his shoulder where it
stuck to the wall. "We may have a job,

too. Interested in some honest work for
a change?" The guy laughed a coarse
harsh laugh.
"Depends on the work," I said.
"Sure it does," he said. "Somebody’ll
come by your place."
"Right," I said. The table I’d shared
with Gag and Slipron was empty, so I
headed for the door. I was almost there
when it crashed open behind a pair of
lances and a rabble of tough-looking
men wearing the freshly printed arm-
bands of the Guard.
"All right, you goons," the corporal
shouted as he raised a truncheon, "this
place is closed! Move out to the street
and -"
The place erupted.
I ducked as a
small table ﬂew over my shoulder di-
rectly toward the corporal, plunged
my ﬁst into an eye, shook my left leg
loose from a set of sharp teeth, and

as I shoved a hand with a knife out
of my way something crashed into
my back and knocked me to the ﬂoor
next to the wall. Sticking close by the
wall, I dodged and crawled forward
and climbed through a broken shutter
onto the street. A knot of ﬁghting guys
spilled through the door to my left, the
three Guard mercenaries watching the
front of the building turned to deal
with them, and I limped away from
the bar down the street and around
the ﬁrst corner.
My back was throb-
bing, but I ﬁgured that was part of the
job; maybe I’d sock Skargool’s wife for
some extra expense money when I hit
her with the ﬁnal bill. I rinsed my face
in a trough and walked away from the
wharves into the city.
My ofﬁce was over a laundry in the
Ghoul’s Quarter near the wall on the
south side, the clapboard sign with its

open staring eye creaking gently in the
breeze from the river. A man was wait-
ing outside my door at the top of the
stairs. "You are examining the disap-
pearance of Mr.
Edrik Skargool?" he
said.
"What’s it to you if I am?" I said, un-
locking the door.
He followed me into the ofﬁce.
"I represent the Oolvaan Mutual In-
surance Carriers."
Oh, no, I thought. "Insurance?"
"Yes indeed. Mr. Skargool has a sub-
stantial policy, amounting to perhaps
140,000 zalous."
I lowered myself gingerly into my
chair. "Bonded insurance?"
"Yes, of course, bonded. Certainly."
Insurance, dammit, insurance. This
was real trouble.
I’d never worked
an insurance case before, and I didn’t
want to start now. Look at it this way, a

lawyer who’d once shared a bottle with
me had explained things.
When you
can ride for an hour and get to a new
place where there’s a totally new set
of laws and jurisdiction, when people
disappear without a trace all the time,
either because they’re dead or just be-
cause they want to disappear, when
you need to buy a policy in one city
and know it’ll be recognized someplace
else, you’ve got to have one key thing.
You’ve got to have some widespread au-
thority nobody’s going to argue with.
Insurance was a contract with one of
the gods.
The tweedy man crossed his legs.
"Unfortunately,
our
organization
is
understaffed and" (he gave a delicate
cough) "chronically overworked, so it
is our policy to rely on local assistance
for claims investigation whenever pos-
sible."

"Now wait a minute," I said. "Let’s
clear a few things here. I -"
"I apologize if I have not made my-
self clear." With his faded tweed cloak
and his slack pale face, he could have
been any nameless functionary buried
in a bureaucrat’s coattails. His voice,
though, had the uncompromising tone
of someone who always got his way, on
his own terms. Even if he wasn’t dan-
gerous himself, he had to have big-time
friends. “Whenever an investigation is
in progress," he told me, "we employ its
ﬁndings."
"Come on, at least you’ve got to pay
a royalty on -"
"No.
Consider the effort a tax on
your business practice. You may also
consider it a licensing test. We expect
any investigator to comply with our
own standards for proof-of-claim."
"Standards?" I said.
"What do you

mean, your standards? I know this job
like I -"
"Then you will have no difﬁculties,"
he said, “will you.
A causal chain or
other validator of legitimacy must be
demonstrated. Cases of fraud or collu-
sion are punishable, both on the part of
the beneﬁciaries and the investigator."
I’d never seen one of these policies,
of course, but that wasn’t going to be
any excuse. If you got noticed by the
gods, I’d always heard that the best
thing to do was keep your mouth shut
and do whatever they wanted, and
hope they’d forget about you when you
were ﬁnished. But what would it take
to get ﬁnished? "What if this, ah, inves-
tigator can’t come up with a deﬁnite
solution? Sometimes nobody can tie up
all the pieces, no matter how good they
are."
"Ah," he said ."h’m. Indeterminate

cases are not desirable.
With proper
validation and under special circum-
stances, they may be, ahem, reluc-
tantly accepted. Quite reluctantly."
"Okay," I said, "I get it. I’ve got no
choice. I’ll do what you want, I’m not
an idiot.
So what kind of insurance
does Skargool have, anyway?"
"Life," he said, "Of course."
"Don’t you have ways of knowing
whether he’s still alive?"
He turned up one corner of his
mouth in what might have been a
smile, or maybe just a nervous tic.
"Omnipotence is not one of our pa-
tron’s virtues. These things take time
and energy, and attention." He got to
his feet.
"Just one more question," I said.
"Yes?"
"Who took out the insurance, and
when?”

He gave me the tic again. "The wife,"
he said, "of course. One month ago."
“Right," I said.
"How will I get in
touch with you?"
"I will be in touch with you.
Good
day." The door closed behind him.
I
opened the desk drawer and took out
the ﬂask, then decided to just hit my
head against the wall for a few min-
utes.
I turned around, and while I
looked for a spot on the wall that didn’t
already have a dent the door creaked
open behind me again.
"What now?" I said, but this time the
man who’d come in was different.
With a shapeless cap pulled low
enough over his face to rest on the
bridge of his nose, and a generally
squat frame, the guy looked like no
further than second cousin away from
a giant toad. "Da time ta see de boose
is now," he said.

"Yeah," I said, "da boose." I forgot
about the ﬂask and followed after him
out the door.
We wound around local streets, head-
ing generally back toward the docks,
and ﬁnally entered a shuttered house
where we descended to the basement.
Beneath an old rug was an iron grate.
The guy rolled up the edge of the rug,
being careful not to disturb a slender
thread that ran from one frayed corner
off into the darkness. Then he turned
his back, did something behind him
in the gloom, and waited.
Running
water gurgled below the grate, gradu-
ally growing fainter. Finally the grate
clanged and squeaked open. The edge
of a ladder was revealed, leading down
into a big pipe that I hoped wasn’t the
sewer.
A concealed mechanism drained the
last swirls of water away as we reached

the base of the ladder.
Next to the
ladder a section of the stone facing
wall had opened, revealing a crawlway.
Bending low, I followed the guy into the
wall, through several ascending turns
thick with slime and algae, and up
out of the garbage into a small torchlit
anteroom. Three other exits led down
through the ﬂoor or into the walls in
a similar manner as the one we’d en-
tered through. Four men got up from a
table and pushed me against the wall.
One of them frisked me, two others
kept their hands on their swords, and
the ﬁnal one nervously slapped a large
cudgel against his palm. They didn’t
ﬁnd anything; as I kept ﬁnding rea-
sons to reiterate I wasn’t an idiot. The
thugs moved aside and one grunted,
tilting his head in the direction of a
wall tapestry.
I moved the tapestry
aside and went through the concealed

door behind it.
The new room had walnut wall-
panels, a bookcase ﬁlled with leather-
bound volumes, and a large desk with
a man seated next to it.
The man
was wearing a dressing gown embroi-
dered with dragons and other myth-
ical beasts and on his nose he had
a pair of spectacles, through which
he was studying a ledger-book.
He
looked mild-mannered enough, and he
could be, but generally he wasn’t: this
wasn’t the ﬁrst time we’d met.
The
boss looked up at me, over the tops
of the spectacles, and said, "Sit down.
What’s on your mind?"
"Its not a what," I said, sitting. "It’s
a who. Edrik Skargool. Somebody kid-
napped him, but it doesn’t sound like
you."
"Hah," he said. "The kid has a lip."
He leafed through his book, alternately

watching me over his glasses and glanc-
ing down into the book.
"Skargool.
Here he is." The boss read for a mo-
ment. "He’s rich, yeah, but it’s mostly
property, not a lot of cash.
He pays
his protection dues regular, no trouble
there.
Kidnap rating’s low, so you’re
right, hah, why should I take him out?
Stupid. Whoever did it, stupid. Some
people got no business sense." His eyes
looked up at me again. "Like to know
your own ratings, hah?"
"Sure, except I’m sure it would cost
me more than I’m worth to ﬁnd out. I’m
sure you know that, too."
"Hah," he said noncommittally.
"Anyway, that’s beside the point," I
said. "The one thing I do need is this.
You have anything on somebody called
The Creeping Sword?"
"The what?
Creeping Sword?
You
got to be kidding. What idiot kind of

name is that?"
I passed him the kidnap note.
"Creeps," he said, studying it. "Some
punk. Punks all over the place. Whole
damn town is crawlinl with punks." He
glowered at the note, then glowered at
me, and then spun the note back at me
like a throwing star.
Then, for good
measure, as I ducked out of the way
and let the note chew itself into the
back of my chair, he grabbed his ledger
book and hurled it across the room.
It was big, and heavy for a book, and
made a loud thud against the stone
wall.
The guards from the room out-
side the tapestry suddenly appeared
and began to drag me out the rest of
the way out of my chair. "Civil wars,"
the boss yelled, glowering now at ev-
eryone in sight. "I hate ‘em. Bad for
business. Lousy for everybody. What?"
I had been gargling at him, hoping

he would remember me before the boys
actually started carving.
The boss
stared at me for a second, then said,
"Forget about him, he’s all right. Put
him down."
They dropped me back across the
chair and ﬁled out. I sat up, worked
my shoulder around a bit, and worked
the kidnap note out of the wood of
the chair as I worked on steadying my
breathing. "Thanks," I said.
"Yeah," he said, which from him
passed for an apology. "So I’ve got a job
too you can come along and help. You
know Kriglag?"
“I’ve heard of him, never met him."
Kriglag ran the wharf rackets.
"He’s a dope. He thinks he’s gonna
work with this new Venerance, what’s-
his-name,
cooperate with all these
fresh
mercenaries,
end
up
fencing
their loot maybe, I don’t know what

all. Maybe he’s a big enough idiot to
work with somebody who’d call himself
a Creeping Sword."
"I’m listening."
"I’m gonna take him out," the boss
said. "I’m gonna take him out tonight.
You want to be there?"
"Yeah," I said, "I do. Thanks again."
"You’re with Netoo." He jerked his
head at the tapestry. I went through
it and told the boys I was with Ne-
too. I followed the one with the cudgel
through another tapestry and down a
hall.
There were thirty of us, more or less,
divided in four teams. I strolled around
the assembly room, asking the usual
questions, until we moved out.
Night had fallen by the time the ﬁrst
two teams sloshed off into the sewers;
sometimes I think more activity and
commerce in Roosing Oolvaya takes

place in the sewers than overhead in
the streets. Nevertheless, the bunch of
us under Netoo headed into the streets
with the sorcerer. She was up in the
front, next to Netoo, helices of ﬁne blue
lines making gloves around her ges-
turing hands as she walked. The blue
shapes left a slowly fading trail behind
her in the air.
The clamor of some riot a neighbor-
hood or so to the north came inter-
mittently to us through the tangled
alleys. There was no sign of the Guard,
though, and I wondered if the boss
had managed to convince somebody to
concentrate on other areas for this par-
ticular evening. A tendril of river fog
curled around a building ahead of us
and up our street. We entered the fog,
and Netoo stopped the team to confer
with the magician.
The magician gestured a few times,

almost lost from my view in the fog,
cocked her head to listen to nothing,
and nodded.
Netoo motioned us on.
We crept one block, exiting and then
reentering the fog, turned right, and
moved down an alley.
Netoo touched
the shoulder of a man holding a bow.
The man ﬁtted an arrow and shot. The
arrow turned into a shadow and disap-
peared into the mist. This was followed
half-a-second later by a soft clunk and
rattle, and then the thunk of a falling
body. The magician nodded again and
whispered to Netoo. "Around the next
corner," Netoo said.
"The house with
hanging plants. All ready? Okay, go."
We spread out and padded quickly
around the corner.
Shadows dark against the light mist
ﬂitted over the rooftops from other di-
rections.
They hit the roof as we hit
the front.

Steel abruptly clashed.
I paused
to let my teammates engage,
then
charged through the crowd and hit the
door shoulder-ﬁrst.
The door burst
easily open onto a courtyard with
other forms already struggling there. I
charged through them too, aiming for
the inner door. Shouts of "No mercy for
traitors” and "Death to the usurper!”,
our attempt to disguise our origin by
implicating local malcontents, came
from behind, above, and below, indi-
cating that the sewer teams had reap-
peared as well.
I grappled with the
inner door and it sprang open. A robed
functionary scuttled past down the in-
terior hall, looking frantically in my
direction. I grabbed him by the collar
and said, "The Creeping Sword."
"I know nothing," the man said, try-
ing to faint, so I hit him over the head
with the ﬂat of my sword.

It went like that for awhile.
Then
I found Kriglag. Taken totally unpre-
pared and with all his escape routes
cut off, Kriglag was trying to make the
best of a hopeless situation.
He was
drunk. I wedged myself into the closet
with him and dragged him to his feet.
Jugs rolled off his chest and shattered
on the ﬂoor. "Kriglag!" I said.
"Hwazigah?" he said, eyelids sag-
ging.
"The Creeping Sword, Kriglag. The
Creeping Sword!" I said, yelling it into
his ear.
"A bad, a bad guy," Kriglag said, and
started to snore. I shook him. Then I
broke the neck off a jug he’d apparently
missed in the confusion and poured the
contents over his head. Kriglag opened
his eyes and said, "Wha?"
I put the tip of my award where his
crossed eyes could focus on it.
“The

Creeping Sword, Kriglag."
"Gemmy outa here.”
"Tell me about the Creeping Sword."
“You get me outa here ﬁrst."
I slapped him across the jaw. "Tell
me why I should bother,” I said.
Kriglag’s head was clearing. "Creep-
ing Sword, yeah.
This guy from up-
river someplace. Had this idea. He’d
make cash and a good-guy image at
the same time, snatching rich rats."
Maybe his head wasn’t that clear af-
ter all. "Rich rats?"
"Rich
scum."
Kriglag
paused
to
cough for breath.
"Guys with lots of
dough who got it by being scum. Peo-
ple nobody would miss, be glad to see
them go."
"So he came to you. What did you
tell him?"
"I’m no fool." Kriglag said.
"I told
him, try it out. If it worked maybe I’d

take him on."
"Where did he go?"
"I dunno. He was supposed to come
back when he had results."
"Anybody else know about it?"
Kriglag smirked and breathed a foul
breath in my face.
"My partner," he said.
I lay the edge of my sword along his
throat. "Who?"
Kriglag kept smirking. "Get me out
of here or you’ll never know."
I hesitated. Then, with a chorus of
"No collaboration!", a bunch of my new
friends burst into the room behind us.
Kriglag looked over my shoulder at
them, glanced back at me, and lunged
toward my blade. I couldn’t believe a
survivor type like Kriglag would go so
far as to impale himself, but just in
case I pulled the sword out of his reach.
"You’re a sap," he yelled at me as they

dragged him away.
I spent a few minutes with his
ledgers. Kriglag kept records so lousy
you couldn’t ﬁgure out a thing, which
surely meant, from his perspective,
they were some pretty fancy account-
ing. Still, I was able to tell that he’d
done a lot of business moving hot goods,
goods that had started out in ware-
houses on the wharf. I couldn’t ﬁnd out
which warehouses, but I made a list of
the stuff. One of Netoo’s people arrived
to take charge of the books, so I wiped
off my sword and went home.
A messenger woke me in the middle
of the night with a note from Turbot.
New message received.
Ransom
drop tonight.
Turbot, always maniacally terse, ap-
parently had things under control.
I

went back to sleep.
I SPENT THE NEXT MORNING
running down the list of business ri-
vals Skargool’s wife had given me.
None of them had anything bad to say
about him, and none of them seemed
to have anything to hide.
None of
them had missed any of the hot ware-
house goods Kriglag had entered in his
ledger books, either. It wasn’t until I
was ﬁnishing up with the fourth name
on my list that I suddenly wised up. I
asked the guy for his own rundown of
Skargool’s competitors.
The names he gave weren’t on my
list.
Their stories were even more inter-
esting than the ones from the list of
Skargool’s wife.
They knew Skargool
better.
They knew him well enough
to know he’d been getting upset. He’d
found out someone was stealing from

his stocks. And he’d gotten suspicious
about his wife’s ﬁdelity.
They couldn’t understand how Skar-
gool had suddenly picked up these
rumors about ﬂogging,
and slavers,
and being a general taskmaster. They
all liked him, and they were his com-
petitors in a notoriously cutthroat ﬁeld.
According to them, he was honest to a
fault and underworked his employees,
if anything.
Then I wasted a few hours talking to
ﬁrepen dealers.
The ﬁrepen had been a fad item a
few seasons before.
After the initial
enthusiasm, people realized that the
pens wore out much too fast to be of
real use, and in any case weren’t good
for anything besides grafﬁti.
They
would write on walls, metal, pavement,
indeed on anything but paper and
parchment. Paper and parchment they

would ignite.
Flashy but impractical,
and occasionally downright dangerous.
The type of thing some upriver yokel
might think was pretty hot stuff.
One minor sorcerer was still making
the things, selling some out of the stall
in front of his home and a few others to
local merchants. Demand had settled
down to maybe a dozen pens a month,
so he was able to tell me quickly where
each one of them had gone. The second
merchant he sent me to was a hit.
"This kid with pimples and a big
rusty sword and an accent," the woman
said. Displayed on a table in her stall
were an array of neatly stacked fresh
ﬁsh and assorted gewgaws in baskets.
"Thought he was heaven’s gift itself.
Maybe he was, back home, with them
country girls." She sneered at me and
tried to sell me a ﬁsh.
The guy had bought the pen three

days before, which ﬁt.
I went back to the wharves to hunt
up Glinko. When I found him, I wished
I hadn’t looked. He’d been ﬁshed out
from the ebb spot behind a piling un-
der a wharf. Somebody had gotten his
ﬁngers around Glinko’s throat.
The
marks of the ﬁngers remained, and
something sharp on one of the ﬁngers
had torn open his carotid.
As I gazed down at Glinko I became
aware of another man gazing down
next to me. It was the representative
of the Oolvaan Mutual Insurance com-
pany. "You are making progress?" he
asked.
"Absolutely," I said to Glinko. “Lots
of progress."
“Will we have to pay on the claim?"
"Without knowing the exact terms
of Skargool’s policy, I don’t know. You
might."

"When will I know?"
"Tonight," I said, "sounds like a good
bet."
He inclined his head at me and
stepped away.
Since I was already
in the area, I stopped in to see Chog,
the manager at Skargool Cargo. The
man with the boat-sized sharp-jeweled
ring.
"Had some trouble, I see," I said to
him. One of his eyes was red and pur-
ple and swollen shut, and his knuckles
were scraped raw.
“With the Guard," said Chog. "Hound
ing me, they were, mercenaries hound-
ing me, me with a reputation in this
city."
"Right. Mrs. Skargool got another
note this morning, did you hear?"
"Good news, that must be good news.
My friend’s return must be near. The
two of us, Skargool and me, like broth-

ers."
"So you said," I said. "I’m going to
make the ransom drop tonight."
"I must know the outcome as soon as
possible."
“As long as you mention it, you can
hear it direct.
Drop by Skargool’s
house tonight around midnight."
"Midnight.
I surely will be there."
Chog smiled.
I went to Skargool’s myself and set-
tled accounts with his wife. She was
holding up remarkably well under the
strain, tried ﬂirting with me, more seri-
ously this time, and everything. I took
Turbot aside and discussed things with
him, and then he took his sword and
left.
I had never seen that morning’s note,
so I examined it to pass the time. It
was ﬁrepen on copper again. When I
compared it to the ﬁrst one, though,

the script was slightly different.
I
showed it to Mrs. Skargool.
"You ever see this handwriting be-
fore?" I asked her.
She held it close to her face and
studied it carefully, then looked up
at me, her clear blue eyes wide and
guileless.
"No, no, I1m certain I’ve
never seen this before," she said. "Is it
important?"
"Not really," I said.
At dusk a messenger arrived with
the last note.
The messenger didn’t
know anything, he’d just been handed
the note on a street corner with an
oolmite coin, and after handing it over
he scurried quickly off into the dark
without even asking for a tip. The note
read:
Pack the money in two sacks.
At
eight the detective will take the sacks

and walk to the corner of Avenue of the
Fifth Great Flood and Brewer Street.
He will come alone.
The intersection was in a shabby sec-
tion of the wharf district. We prepared
the loot, and at eight I left the house.
Tacked to a wall at Fifth Great and
Brewer was a folded cloth. Inside the
cloth was another copper plate. The in-
scription told me to go to the Haalsen
Traders wharf,
which was about a
three-minute block away. At the wharf,
yet another note instructed me to go
down a ladder and put the sacks into
a dinghy moored at the base. It was
about time to put the sacks down some-
where; twenty thousand zalous could
get pretty heavy on you. The note also
suggested I wait at the bottom of the
ladder for the next half-hour or so. I
put the bags in the boat, a cable tied

to the boat drew tight and pulled the
boat away into the shadows under the
wharf next door, and I cooled my heels
for a time. When I decided I’d rested
long enough I climbed the ladder and
went back to Skargool’s house.
As soon as I walked through the door
Skargool’s wife pounced. I’d had trou-
ble dragging a useful word out of her
for two days, and now she’d ﬁnally de-
cided to talk.
"Did you give them the money?
Where’s the money now, didn’t you get
it back? Where’s my husband? What
-?"
"Shut up," I told her. "I only want to
say the whole thing once, and I1m not
going to say it until everybody’s here."
"Where’s my husband?"
"I don’t think he’s coming."
She started to snarl and spit at me,
but at this point I didn’t care. I knew

her too well by now, not that there was
that much to know.
Kardu Chog the
manager arrived, followed shortly after
by Turbot. He gave me a very slight
nod and sat down by the door.
"Now will you tell me -" said Skar-
gool’s wife.
"Not yet," I said. "That’s not every-
body."
The wife and Chog both started.
"What are you talking about’?" Chog
said.
"What I said," I said. "We’re waiting
for somebody else."
Mrs.
Skargool looked around ner-
vously, at everything and everybody
except Chog.
Exactly at midnight, several min-
utes later, there was a ﬁnal knock on
the door. It was the guy from the insur-
ance company.
I stood up and started to talk. "Skar-

gool’s dead," I said, mostly addressing
his wife.
"He was probably dead be-
fore you came to see me. Skargool was
kidnapped by The Creeping Sword,
but that’s about all anybody’s told me
that’s been true.
"Chog, here, was the silent partner
of Kriglag -"
Chog made a sudden lunge out of the
couch.
"Stay," the insurance agent said.
Chog stayed.
His hand had frozen
in the air, on the way into his opposite
sleeve, and one foot was raised. I nod-
ded at Turbot. He went and pulled a
long knife out of Chog’s sleeve, then
pushed him back onto the sofa. Chog
was breathing, and his eyes were dart-
ing frantically, but otherwise he didn’t
move at all. Turbot sat down too.
"Kriglag ran the wharves," I contin-
ued, "and one of the things he ran was

hot merchandise. A lot of the merchan-
dise was stuff that Chog stole from
his own warehouse.
Skargool’s ware-
house, really, but Chog was running
it.
Since Chog kept the records and
Skargool trusted him, it took awhile
for Skargool to catch on.
"By the time he did, Chog had an-
other plan. Kriglag had told him about
The Creeping Sword. The Sword was
this idiot kid from upriver someplace,
probably, and he had this idiot idea.
He would kidnap a businessman who
was both rich and nasty to his employ-
ees, but not so nasty that someone
wouldn’t be willing to pay the ransom.
I guess the Sword wanted to become
some kind of folk hero, kidnapping only
people who deserved it. If his victims
didn’t show up again, either, nobody
was supposed to be too upset. After all,
they were bad people, right?

"All Chog had to do was run around
spreading stories about how rich and
how terrible Skargool was, and wait for
the Sword to bite. I don’t know exactly
how long it took, but he was right on
the mark. The Sword showed up, right
on cue.
"The thing was, Chog was follow-
ing Skargool too, and when the Sword
picked up Skargool, Chog followed the
Sword. After the Sword wrote his ﬁrst
kidnap note, Chog came in and got rid
of them both.
"That was it for The Creeping Sword,
and that was it for Skargool.
That’s
about it for the case, too." I waited un-
til I could see the look of relief appear
on the face of Skargool’s wife. That’s
how much I didn’t like her.
"Except
for one thing," I said to her, "the insur-
ance. That was dumb, real dumb, tak-
ing out the policy yourself. I don’t know

whether you love Chog or he loves you,
or whether he made you think he does
or you made him think you do, and I
don’t care. I don’t even care if you de-
liberately set me up so I’d ﬁgure out
about Chog and the Sword and think
that was the whole story.
What I do
care about was the other thing on your
husband’s mind, ﬁnding out that you
and Chog were playing around behind
his back, and probably ﬁguring out the
other reason he’d never noticed Chog
stealing from him. You, keeping his at-
tention distracted. It wasn’t just Chog,
it was you too. Both of you conspired
to kill Skargool and get the insurance
and take over the business."
She had frozen, like Chog, when I
mentioned the insurance.
The insur-
ance man hadn’t bothered to interrupt,
he’d just pointed a ﬁnger at her.
I
turned to him.

"Satisﬁed?" I said.
"Eminently," he said. He pointed a
ﬁnger at Chog and then at Skargool’s
wife. Balls of ﬂame materialized and
consumed them.
Then his form lit
up in a quick ﬂash followed by a col-
umn of billowing smoke. When vision
returned a few seconds later he was
gone, apparently dematerialized into
the vapor.
I think only I noticed the
catch on the front door as it snapped
shut, and the small puff of cold outside
air. That was all right with me; I ﬁgure
everybody’s entitled to their tricks of
the trade.
"Who was that?" said Turbot.
"Either a magician working for the
insurance company," I said, "or some
god, slumming." Hopefully he wasn’t
a god, and if he was I hoped I’d done
well enough by him so now he’d leave
me alone.
As it turned out later, I’d

done too well for my own good, but I
still didn’t think I’d had a choice. We
split the ransom money, which Turbot
had stashed outside after he’d recov-
ered it from the hiding place he’d found
when he’d tailed Chog from the ransom
pickup spot earlier, and went home.
It had been a lousy case. I’d sort of
liked Glinko. I thought I would have
liked Skargool, too.

Chapter3
THE GREAT
KARLINI’S
PROBLEM
WROCLAW
BEGAN
CLEARING
THE DISHES. "Thunda-tenchon dropp
by the house about a year ago," said
Ronibet, Karlini’s wife, spearing the
last ﬂoret of broccoli and handing her

plate to Wroclaw. "Stayed for a month
eating up all our food, but we did man-
age to make some good progress with
him while he was around. I heard he
went off and gave a presentation on
our results at a conference down on
the coast. ‘Manifold Processing in Sta-
bilization of Third-Order Aura-Linked
Matrices’ - isn’t that what we called it,
dear?"
"Huh?" said Karlini. He had spent
the meal alternately muttering to him-
self and staring darkly at the walls. It
was highly uncharacteristic behavior
for Karlini, whom Max often thought
was the most manic talker he’d ever
met. Karlini’s gaze wandered off again.
“I haven’t gone to a conference in
years," Max said, wiping the remains
of a fruit rind from his clean-shaven
lip. His tunic, which he had loosened
for comfort, was open at the neck, re-

vealing a small amulet covered with a
delicate ﬁligree of microscopic runes,
several
dust-speck
jewels
scattered
through the curls.
"Haven’t wanted
to waste the time.
Nobody ever says
anything important at those things
anyway; all the good stuff they always
want to save for themselves. Not that I
blame them, mind you."
Wroclaw
appeared
again
with
a
cigar box. Karlini stirred and reached
for it but, at a sharp glance from Roni-
bet, slumped back into his chair. Max
took a cigar, bit the tip off, stuck the
other end in his mouth, and, wav-
ing off Wroclaw’s long ﬂaming match,
snapped two ﬁngers in front of the
cigar. The end of the cigar sparked red
and a small cloud of smoke arose.
"Always showing off, aren’t you,"
Ronibet said.
Max turned his hand over, reveal-

ing a miniature striking pad and ﬂint
afﬁxed to the end of his thumb and
third ﬁnger. Max grinned at her, then
slipped the device off and returned it
to a pocket. "So how’s that animalcule
stuff you were up to?"
"It’s coming along," Ronibet said.
"Remember that cell theory we talked
about?
All living matter can be sub-
divided into other microscopic living
units down to a certain level?
It’s
now clear that the theory is substanti-
ated. Not only that, I think I’ve iden-
tiﬁed those food-to-magic conversion
organelles you postulated."
Max puffed thoughtfully on the cigar.
"Good work," he said.
"Better than
good, important. If you can ﬁgure out
exactly how magical essence gets pro-
duced, down inside these cells of yours,
then the Plan becomes more than just
a mad pipe dream."

"You and your Plan," Karlini mut-
tered.
"As long as I’ve known you,
there’s always been the Plan.
And
what good has it ever done you? What
good has it done for any of us?
Just
a lot of fool dreaming, that’s all it is.
We’ll never be rid of the gods, there’s
no use even talking about it.”
"What’s eating the Great one?" Max
said to Roni. "I thought he wanted to
quit being dominated as much as any
of us.
Don’t I remember him going
on and on about getting his free will
back?"
"I’ve changed my mind. There’s no
such thing as free will," said Karlini.
"If it’s not the gods it’ll be something
else.
Politics, economic forces, bad
weather, there’s always some force run-
ning your life."
"Yeah, ﬁne, then," Max said.
“The
force that’s running my life at the mo-

ment is you, you nincompoop, so there.
You planning to tell me what I’m doing
here and why you’re in such a crabby
mood or am I supposed to keep drag-
ging it out of you chunk by chunk?"
"He’s right, dear," Roni said. "Know-
ing Max, I think he’s been very patient
with you."
"Yeah, that’s me," Max said, "the
very soul of patience. So will you tell
me about this curse, already? You can’t
leave the castle, you said.
Does that
mean the invisible wall of molasses,
the endless maze, the -"
"His heart stopped," Ronibet said.
Max looked at her, looked at Kar-
lini, uncrossed his arms and leaned
forward, then sank back in his chair.
"Hmm." Max examined his cigar ab-
sently, stuck it back in his mouth. A
large cloud of smoke rose.
Max fol-
lowed it upward with his eyes until

it grew together, all at once, and coa-
lesced into a compact ball. "You walked
out the door and keeled over?"
"That’s about the size of it, Max,"
Karlini said.
"Now that," Max said, watching the
smoke ball roll along the ceiling, "is
very interesting indeed. Was it a spell
or a curse, I wonder. I assume you had
your life-protectives running?
What
am I saying, of course you did. Could
this thing have keyed off them?"
"I thought of that," Karlini said. "I
haven’t just been sitting around here
doing nothing but mope. I’ve come up
with a lot of possibilities, and none of
them have been any help at all."
"Don’t get testy again," said Max.
"Settle down, I was just thinking out
loud. You brought me here so I could
ﬁgure out a way to get you out of this,
you don’t have to get sharp at me.

There’s no way around it – better go
back to the beginning and give me the
whole story." He raised an eyebrow and
eyed Karlini.
Karlini ran a hand through his hair
and absently rufﬂed it further. Ronibet
looked at the hair and sighed.
"All
right, Max," said Karlini, staring off
at a line of brightly colored pennons
dangling from the mezzanine balcony.
"This is how it started. We’re sitting
at home, the place on the cape by the
ocean, you remember it.
Nice morn-
ing, clear sky, no portents, nothing, so
we’re having breakfast outside on the
terrace for a change, when all of a sud-
den a whirlwind starts to blow up. I
reached for the napkins -"
"Stick to the facts," Max said.
"Huh?” said Karlini.
"You’ve never reached for a napkin
in your life, pal."

Karlini looked over at Ronibet. "This
is supposed to be a friend?" he said.
"Yes, dear," Ronibet said, "and not
just any friend, one of your very best
friends. That’s why you’re going to ask
him to risk his life for you, and why
he’s going to do it."
Max grabbed his cigar out of his
mouth and leaned forward. "Now just
a second there -"
"Hear the whole thing ﬁrst, Max,"
Roni said.
". . . Yeah," Max said. "Just remind
me to stop making friends, all right,
Karlini?"
"Okay," Karlini said, "Roni went for
the napkins, and . . . where was I?"
"The gong," Ronibet said.
"Right,
okay," Karlini said.
“So
we’re looking off the terrace into this
whirlwind, which seems to be centered
about half-a-mile from the house just

uphill from the beach where the scrub
starts. The wind has kicked up some-
thing ﬁerce even where we’re sitting,
but because of the dust and ﬂying grass
and shrubs we can tell that the thing
is a lot more intense at the center, so
intense that it’s starting to form a fun-
nel and stretch up into a tower. Then,
all of a sudden, the sky rings."
"The sky?" Max said.
“Rings, with
sound?”
"That’s right, like we’re sitting un-
der a solid metal dome, and someone’s
just hit it with a rod about ten miles
long. Dull metallic boom, just massive,
the sky reverberates, the house, the
ground, us, everything - it’s like an
earthquake with sound. All the dishes
bounce off the table.
I’m barely able
to keep from bouncing off the terrace,
but my insides feel like goo in an egg-
beater. And then, right in the middle

of the whirlwind, this castle starts to
materialize."
“This castle," Roni said.
"By now giant bolts of lightning are
running up and down the wall of the
funnel cloud. As we watch, the light-
ning sparks begin to light up a ghostly
image of a castle. At ﬁrst all it looks
likes is an image, a mirage or some
strange optical effect, since it’s trans-
parent and parts of the castle don’t
appear to be there at all. The lightning
keeps ﬂashing, and as the image of the
castle gets more distinct, we can see
that it’s rotating slowly in the same
direction as the funnel, hanging in
mid-air a couple hundred feet off the
ground.
Then we get a really sharp
bolt on the far side, and before I ﬁn-
ish squinting from the ﬂash the castle
starts to solidify in earnest and drop
down toward the ground at the same

time. The wind starts to die. The cas-
tle drops faster, still turning, and then
it hits the ground. Everything shakes
again and the earth jumps all over
the place, about what you’d expect if a
small mountain suddenly came out of
nowhere and fell in your backyard, one
last bolt of lightning strikes one of the
towers, and then the lightning’s gone.
The castle digs itself into the ground
like a corkscrew, slows, and stops. The
funnel pulls up into the air, the wind
dying, and all of a sudden it’s gone, too.
Everything’s quiet and peaceful. Just
like it was about thirty seconds before,
except the only difference is that now
there’s this castle sitting at the edge
of the beach, chunks of dirt torn up all
around it, what’s left of a grove of trees
sticking out from under the right side,
and a small cloud turning slowly over-
head and poufﬁng out in little streams

of vapor.”
“So of course,” said Max, “the ﬁrst
thing you did was run right over.”
“You’d have done the same thing,”
said Karlini.
“Yeah, well, maybe,” Max allowed.
"So I ran some scans on the castle
from the house, but as far as I could
tell, it was inert.
Given the nature
of the manifestation we’d just seen, it
was certainly a surprising result, but
it held up on cross-check.
From ev-
erything I could ﬁnd out, the castle
was nothing more than a pile of rocks
and mortar and the usual construction
stuff.
Roni wanted to leave it alone,”
said Karlini, glancing at her and then
quickly looking away to study the ceil-
ing again, “but I couldn’t, you know,
just let it sitting there, looming away,
not explaining itself at all. In the back
of my mind was the thought that the

owner might be about come out and
decide to conquer the neighborhood, or
maybe that somebody had stolen the
place and dumped the evidence on us
– anyway, with things looking the way
they did, I thought it would be safest to
check it out further and at least try to
ﬁgure out what we were dealing with.
“I picked out a few supplies -”
"He emptied out half the lab and
piled the stuff on poor Haddo," Roni
put in.
"- some relevant equipment - things
I knew we might need - and we strolled
over.
"A good portion of the structure is
under water at the moment, so you
couldn’t get the full impact on your
way in, Max, but this place is big.
Seen up close, right from the base, it
just hung there in the sky, massive
and craggy, all these towers and bat-

tlements
and
hulking
escarpments
holding who the hell knew what kind
of nastiness.
Black stone, and gray,
scarcely a touch of color in the whole
place,
except for some lichens and
some singed-looking moss on the walls.
And absolutely silent, not a sound, the
kind of quiet you hear in the forest
when some serious creature has just
chased most everything out and any-
body’s who’s left is just holding their
breath and trying not to move, hoping
the thing doesn’t notice them and goes
away. But every test I ran, even stand-
ing next to it, was negative. As far as
I could tell, the castle had never been
near a spell in its life.
"It was cold, though, cold enough
so frost was condensing on the walls
and the air was getting chilly just from
standing next to it. There hadn’t been
any snow or ice on it when it arrived, so

I made the tentative assumption that
whatever process had landed it there
had also sucked the heat out. Now, I’m
not sure that’s the whole truth, but I
don’t know if it matters.
"We decided to take a walk around
and see if there was anything different
about the back.
There was no obvi-
ous way in on our side, you see, and
I wasn’t sending anyone up a sixty-
foot sheer rock wall unless I had to.
If the ground had been perfectly ﬂat,
a brisk stroll around the castle back
to the place we’d started would have
taken at least twenty minutes, maybe
half-an-hour.
Of course, as I’ve said,
the terrain was really a mess from the
castle trying to screw itself into the
ground. Right up next to the wall the
earth dropped down ten to twenty feet
where the thing had dug itself its own
earthen moat.
Cracks and pits and

snaky crevasses were running all over
the place, and mounds and rough hills
were piled up between them. The smell
of churned dirt hung everywhere.
"The castle didn’t stay exactly quiet,
either, as it turned out.
As we clam-
bered along, every so often we’d hear it
give a creak or a rasp or a giant groan
as it settled, and the ground would
quiver a bit all over again. The thing
that was starting to worry me more
than anything else, in fact, was the
idea that the castle had dropped in for
a visit, and was getting ready to take
off again, probably with the same wind
and storm and generally messing up
the neighborhood it had arrived with.
As it turned out, of course, I was right,
but it wasn’t imminent at that point.
"So on the side of the castle fac-
ing away from the house, we ﬁnally
found something helpful.
The rock

base the castle was resting on looked
like the top of a mountain that had
been sheared away.
Parts of it had
been ﬁlled in or built up with addi-
tional rock, you know the way that sort
of construction goes, but the area we
were facing was solid cliff. About thirty
feet up, where the cliff seemed to end
and the rock wall began, we could see
a gateway.
A roadbed extended out
from this gate over our heads.
Since
we were looking from underneath, we
could see a set of big buttresses spring-
ing from the cliff wall to support the
bottom of this roadbed. Where the but-
tresses ended, about ten feet out from
the wall, the roadbed also ended in a
ripped-off edge where the rest of the
span had apparently been torn away.
So we backed up for a better look and
spotted a portcullis in the gate, partly
raised - an entrance, sure enough, but

it was still thirty feet up. By the time
we had ﬁnished our walk around the
castle, though, it was apparent that
that was the best-looking way in.
"I didn’t want to use any active
magic around the castle, at least until I
had a better idea of what was going on,
so that meant anything dramatic like
levitation was out.
We all know how
much energy levitation takes, too, and
I didn’t want to incapacitate myself for
a week just to get into a position where
the trouble might really start. Instead,
Haddo managed to get an arrow with a
trailing line up through the portcullis.
We pulled through a rope and I climbed
up the wall.
"The place still looked deserted from
the top of the roadbed.
Beyond the
metal spikes of the portcullis, the road
made an abrupt turn to the right and
rapidly ascended, so my view of the

inside was limited. I could see a few
burned-out torches set in sockets in the
walls, and a niche for a guard station,
but that was about it.
Roni thought
it was a perfect setup for a trap, and
frankly I thought so too, so I ran a
few more probes – everything I could
think of, in fact.
Again, nothing.
I
checked the portcullis and the gateway
itself. Nothing. I even pushed a mirror
through the entrance to inspect the
inside surfaces of the gateway. Noth-
ing, nothing, nothing. So I walked in.
And, of course," Karlini said, holding
his head and looking disgusted, "there
was something, and it got me."
He took a drink of water.
"I walked through the entrance and
the most powerful ﬁeld spell I’ve ever
felt jumped out of nowhere. Whoever
set it up had power to burn, power that
would have put any of us in a coma

for a year.
Roni told me they saw a
burst of light, mostly reds and purples.
All I know is that my aura suddenly
went visible. Whenever I’ve looked at
it, it manifests as a solid shell stand-
ing about a foot out from my body. The
shell has a slightly fuzzy edge, and the
space is ﬁlled with blocks of shifting
color.
Since I’d restored my personal
defenses before starting out, I should
have seen an unbroken surface with a
dull metallic, slightly reﬂective sheen.
Instead, when this ﬁeld hit its surface
the aura rippled,
irregular patches
all over the place turned yellow and
started to glow, and then these glowing
yellow patches began to peel up, like
scales lifting off the skin of a snake.
You’d have thought I was molting, if
you can believe that.
Small globules
of writhing tendrils darted in through
the gaps under these scales and spread

out. The tendrils shot around like ﬂy-
ing worms, diving through the ﬂoating
blocks of aura and down into my skin.
I could feel my consciousness being cat-
aloged." Karlini shuddered. "It wasn’t
fun. It was like having each piece of
my mind turned into a ﬁngernail and
drawn slowly down a long slate wall.
"Did I mention that I couldn’t move a
muscle? I tried to ﬁght back, of course,
but every defense, counter-spell, or
neutralizer I thought of was squelched
before it could even form.
The thing
had clamped such a lock on me, it
was all I could do to even string two
thoughts together. Seemed to go on for-
ever even though not very much time
had elapsed - less than a few seconds
external - but you know how percep-
tion plays tricks when you’re in that
type of situation.
"Still, there was something strange

about it, I mean something even strange
than the rest of it. I was aware that
something was missing. You know how,
even under the strongest attack, you al-
ways get some glimpse of the conscious-
ness on the other end? Backscatter, or
whatever?
Well, this time there was
nothing.
It absolutely felt like there
was nobody on the other end, nobody
there at all, and never had been.
“Okay, so maybe they’d left a moni-
tor trap, ﬁne, you run into them some-
times, but they have tradeoffs.
The
heftier they are, the more difﬁcult it is
to hide them. The more you invest in
them the more it takes out of you. And
the more powerful they are, generally
speaking, the more powerful you have
to be to be able to charge them up.
"So there I was, caught in the most
humongous thing of its kind I’d ever
heard of, wondering who could have

built it and having the sinking feeling
they were on the way to see what their
trap had reeled in. But they weren’t."
Karlini stared at his glass of water.
“Don’t we have anything more interest-
ing than this clear stuff?” he said.
“You’ve had quite enough of the hard
stuff lately, dear,” said Roni.
"Are you sure you’re on my side?”
Karlini muttered under his breath.
“Oh, all right. So these ectoplasm-style
tendrils start to get shimmery, fall in
on themselves, and go out, and patches
of the ﬁeld started to relax, and I dis-
cover all of a sudden that what was
holding me up isn’t holding me up any
more, I’m jerking in every direction,
and while I’m falling down I’m see-
ing the last tendrils slide off into the
ﬂagstones. The rest of the ﬁeld ﬂoats
away and dissipates. My aura, by this
point, was the shabbiest thing you’ve

ever seen, tatters and holes and rips
all through it, and I sure didn’t have
the energy to try to restore it. An aura
may not be the person, as Iskendarian
claimed, but at the very least it’s re-
ﬂective of the person’s state. I felt like
my aura looked. All I could do was lie
there and try to breathe.
"Then I heard a noise out on the
roadbed on the other side of the portculli
Roni, disregarding my explicit instruc-
tions, had come up the rope after me.
I opened my mouth to tell her to stay
away, but before I could say a word
she was over the edge of the drop and
heading for the entrance.
Of course,
I shouldn’t have worried, Roni’s the
smartest person I know. She stopped
outside the gate."
"Well, he didn’t look quite ready to
die," Roni said, "at least not at that
moment, so I didn’t want to take the

chance that running after him would
call down the same attack on me.”
"I got myself rolled over and kind
of staggered toward the exit," Karlini
said. “I suppose you could say I made
it. My body made it, anyway. Just as
I crossed the plane of the portcullis I
felt a terrible pain in my chest, like it
was being crushed by a giant foot.
I
started to pass out. Roni grabbed me
as I started to keel over backward -"
"He was also turning a fairly remark-
able blue color," she said.
"- and we both fell back inside the
gateway.
“Two things happened, or rather one
thing happened and one thing didn’t.
The thing that happened was that the
pain in my chest went away. The other
thing was Roni - nothing happened to
her.
Nothing attacked.
The monitor
spell didn’t appear."

"It wasn’t a permanent guardian,"
Max said, "it was a one-shot."
"Right," said Karlini, “and I’d sprung
it.
"Roni and I sat there for awhile.
When I could stand again we started to
explore the place, see if there was any
other way out. We didn’t ﬁnd anything.
The spell that had snagged me was the
only trap we could see, but that spell
had bound me to the airspace of the
castle. Whenever 1 tried to leave my
heart stopped. It wasn’t only through
that ﬁrst doorway, it was ﬂying, climb-
ing over the wall, teleporting, every
possible way of getting away I could
think of. Obviously, I wasn’t supposed
to leave. Wasn’t isn’t the word. I’m still
not supposed to leave."
"However you had entered the cas-
tle," Max said, “you would have acti-
vated the monitor. It didn’t care where

you came in, it only cared that someone
had come in."
"That’s what we think too, Max.
I
also suspect the monitor was looking
for the right kind of person, somebody
with the right level of magical exper-
tise.
That’s the reason for all that
intensive scanning and probing I went
through; it was checking me out to
see if I was qualiﬁed.
I suspect that
especially because of what happened
later."
"There had to be more," Max said.
Karlini squinted at him. "Of course
there’s more. Well. Roni and the rest
could come and go at will, but I was
stuck in here. The next thing I knew,
they had all decided to move in with
me. They carted over all the laboratory
equipment and most of the library, and
a whole pile of other stuff. The castle
had plenty of food, so we weren’t about

to starve. It also had some inhabitants
of its own, like the big bird you rode in
on. What it didn’t seem to have was a
clue to what was going on.
"Then on the third day I was up-
stairs in one of the towers, searching
an area I hadn’t visited before. I had
been climbing a circular staircase that
wound around the core of the tower,
with rooms on each level opening off a
landing. Most of the rooms were locked
behind these solid wood doors cross
bound with iron plates, and I hadn’t
run across the keys yet, so mostly I’d
been slogging up and down the stairs,
looking for secret passages and such-
like. I was thinking about sitting down
to rest for a moment when I came
around the corner to the next landing,
high up in the tower. The door off the
landing was hanging open. I mean it
wasn’t merely open, it was hanging

there, dangling at an angle from the
top hinge, scorched and gouged and
pretty well bashed in. All the surfaces
in that area were scorched as well -
wall, ceilings, ﬂoor. An outline of burnt
soot against one wall showed the form
of a tapestry that had been ﬂash-fried.
I -”
"Was there a smell?” Max said.
"Yes, there was, it was a burnt odor,
but the smell wasn’t fresh; say at least
a week or two old, it wasn’t an illusion.
Anyway, through the broken door I
could see an ofﬁce. As I climbed past
the door, though, I suddenly realized
that I had gotten sleepy, very sleepy,
in fact so sleepy that I felt my eye-
lids dropping closed and found myself
starting to snore. Without even know-
ing it I must have fallen to the ﬂoor,
because that’s where I was later, but
that wasn’t on my mind at the moment

since I had slipped smoothly into a
dream.
"I was in that same ofﬁce, working
on - something, I don’t know what. A
wide window to my right overlooked
the lower works of the castle and a
mountain landscape.
Even though I
didn’t get a good look outside, I could
tell that the mountains stretched much
higher than the elevation of the tower.
There were snowcaps at the upper lev-
els. Something was on my mind, again
I’m not sure what, and I decided to
take a walk to think about it. I pushed
back my chair and went to the door.
"The door was locked, but there was
no lock apparent - and no doorknob,
door pull, or lever either.
Instead, I
raised my right hand and touched my
palm to the surface of the door. Aural
colors appeared around my hand and
rippled out over the door. The image of

the door wavered, as though there had
been a layer of thick clear liquid lying
on the surface and plunging my hand
into it had disturbed it. It didn’t seem
that the substance of the door itself
was rippling, it was more like tossing a
stone into a pond - you can tell that the
bottom of the pond isn’t really moving,
but you’re getting a refractive effect
from the waves in the water. Anyway,
this ripple pattern spread rapidly out
over the surface of the door.
When
the pattern reached the wall, the door
swung open.
"I
walked
out
onto
the
landing.
Again, it was the same scorched land-
ing I had just crossed while I was
awake. The difference was that now, in
the dream, it was intact - no soot, no
ﬁre, no damage of any kind. A colorful
tapestry showing some kind of political
conclave hung on one wall where I had

seen its burnt outline a moment before.
As I walked out the door, though, a
bright glint on the ﬂoor caught my at-
tention. I bent down to look. The glint
was from a clear faceted jewel set in
a unfamiliar gold ring. My mind was
still distracted by whatever I had been
thinking about, so before I quite knew
what I was doing, I was reaching for
the ring. Suddenly my mind clicked in.
I realized I’d never seen that ring be-
fore, and it certainly had no business
being there, just sitting on the ﬂoor,
and I had better not touch it, but my
hand kept going. The ring was pulling
it in.
“I was frozen in position, bent over
on the ﬂoor, ﬁghting my own hand. My
hand slowed, but I was already too late.
My foreﬁnger touched the ring.
"Sheets of lightning crashed out of
the ring and danced along my body.

The jewel was like a pinpoint slashed
out of the sun.
I felt - how do I de-
scribe it?
- I felt like my aura was
being drained down my foreﬁnger and
into the ring.
More lightning came
out, followed by balls of ﬁre. My per-
ception was strange, distorted, I was
stretching out and being compressed
and wrapped around, the world was
getting vaguer and more distant, and
then - snap! -the world was gone. And
I woke up."
Karlini took a drink of water, let his
head ﬂop back, and gazed up at the
ceiling, which Max thought by now he
must have memorized by now.
Max
looked away, staring at a spot over Kar-
lini’s head, his lips pursed, and took
the ﬁnal few puffs on his cigar. Roni
drummed her ﬁngers on the table.
"Let me give you my analysis," Max
said ﬁnally, "and you tell me if it

matches what you’ve come up with.
Whoever the true master of this castle
is, he set up a fairly involved anti-theft
system, which you sprung part of. I as-
sume that this - well, call him a person,
even though he probably wasn’t - this
person ﬁgured he might be attacked
or kidnapped, even in his own castle.
In fact, that’s what happened.
Your
dream was no dream, it was a replay.
This person’s enemy had left that ring
as a trap. The ring sucked in the guy’s
aura and whatever aura-bound pow-
ers he had, and his consciousness too.
Sounds like a pretty interesting ring,
when you think about it . . . especially
since the ring isn’t around now.
You
haven’t found it, right?
Whoever set
the trap transported the ring into the
tower from some other place and then
pulled it back when it had done its job."
"Why couldn’t they have physically

dropped the ring there?" Roni said.
"Why spend the energy for a trans-
port?"
"Even if you could get into a place
like this in the ﬁrst place, would you
want to stroll up and plant a booby
trap right under your victim’s nose?
No," Max said, "if it was me I’d spend
the extra power and be glad of it. I’d
rather not be anywhere in the vicin-
ity.
Anyway, the ring went off, but
somehow the castle master managed
to leave a record of his last perceptions
in that area of the tower.
He meant
for this record to be triggered by the
next person who showed up. Probably
not just any next person, either, I’d bet,
but rather the person who had set off
the other alarm.
“Both the dream and the monitor
and the whole moving castle itself are
part of the alarm. If the master really

was attacked and subdued, the castle
would take off, and would keep going
until it had found the right kind of per-
son to get him loose, or to conduct the
revenge if it was too late. The castle
was also going to make damn sure that
the person it had chosen didn’t leave
until the rescue had been arranged."
"Yes, but, Max," Roni said, "the per-
son who’d been trapped by the alarm
couldn’t leave the castle to do the res-
cue."
Max took a small bite out of the stub
of his cigar and munched reﬂectively
on it.
"Well, Roni, that’s the major
detail I don’t like. The castle master
goes to all this trouble to trap some-
body who’s supposed to rescue him,
then makes sure that rescuer can’t
leave the castle.
There’s a couple of
possibilities. One, the master ﬁgured
the rescue could be done without the

rescuer having to leave the castle.
I
assume if that was possible, Karlini
would have already thought of some-
thing. Right?"
"It can’t be done," Karlini said. "At
least, I can’t ﬁgure out how."
"We can go over it again later. The
second possibility is that the person
trapped in the castle was supposed
to get somebody else to actually do
the rescuing." Max raised an eyebrow,
swiveled it around at Roni and Karlini.
Karlini sighed. "Right, Max. That’s
the way we ﬁgured it. The person in
the castle is a hostage. That’s me. I’m
supposed to pull in favors, or hock my-
self, or sell whatever treasure I have to
get this guy rescued."
"Or," said Max, "you’re supposed to
call in your friends."
"How many magicians do you know
of who have those kind of friends?"

Roni said, with a touch of sarcasm.
"Aha," Max said, “now that is exactly
the point that concerns me the most.
“ He rose and started pacing around
the table.
“If I were thinking about
groups of magic-users, well, there’s the
confederations
and
specialty
guilds.
Of course, their members aren’t what
you’d call cordial to each other, they’re
more backbiting societies than any-
thing else. There’s the few teams and
partnerships you run across now and
then, but - why was your doorstep the
ﬁrst place this castle showed up?"
Karlini nervously adjusted his chair.
“Well, it wasn’t really the ﬁrst place - “
“Other stops aren’t the point if no-
body sprung the trap, and you know it.
It sounds like a setup. It sounds like a
setup to reel in our gang, ﬁnd out who
we really are, and then -”
“Max, ever since I’ve known you

you’ve been seeing plots -"
"Yeah, I’m still alive too, and -”
“But there’s never been a plot -”
“What about the -”
“Max, shut up,” Roni said. "You too,
dear.” She glared pleasantly at them
while she waited.
"Thank you.
Now,
Max, Karlini’s trapped here. You know
the only method we can think of to get
him out is to rescue the owner of this
castle. What Karlini didn’t tell you is
that he’s already traced the ring. It’s in
Roosing Oolvaya. Somebody has to go
get it, and you’ve got the best chance of
anyone we could ﬁnd. Will you do it?"
Max had stopped with his back
turned to the table and his hands
clasped behind his back. "I’m the best
one?
Not Haalsen Groot?
Krinkly
Louise? Boorgonga? For that matter,
what about Shaa?
I was just on my
way to see him, I know where he is."

"You’re it, Max," Karlini said, not
looking at him either. "Groot’s settled
down with his import business. Louise
is down south someplace.
Boorgonga
might be in hibernation for all I could
ﬁnd out.
And you can’t honestly tell
me you’d wish this on Shaa, especially
after what he ran into last time. He’s
lucky he can walk again; he probably
wouldn’t talk to any of us if we showed
up with a cart full of bullion."
". . .
You know this guy in the ring
is probably a god. You know what that
says about whoever trapped him."
"We know, Max,” Roni said.
"You know what the gods think of
me."
“Max,” Karlini said" "give me an-
other plan, any plan. Tell me who to
hire.
Let’s cook up some real zapper
of a spell, scare up an army, I don’t
know, come up with something else,

anything."
Silence fell, lengthened. Then Max
turned around.
“One try," Max said. “That’s all we
get, we all know how these things work.
And we all know damn well who’s the
best choice to try it.
I’ll do it.
Of
course I’ll do it. But that doesn’t mean
I have to like it." He took the dead
stub of cigar out of his mouth, looked
at it, and scowled.
The dark butt
shimmered and began to glow, turned
white, a painful white, and exploded.
The stemware rattled. Sparks and tiny
ﬂaming embers drifted down.
Max
jammed his hands into his pockets,
still scowling as he watched the sparks
go out.
"Aargh," he said disgustedly.
"All my life I work to learn more, pick
up more tricks, get more competent.
All so I can end up in messes like this.”
“All so you can help out your friend

when he’s in a jam?" said Roni. "What
else would you do with all that compe-
tence?”
"Yeah," Max said, "right. I guess it’s
too late to complain. I just hope this
thing isn’t going to involve undead. I’ve
had undead up to my neck lately.” He
spat out a stray twist of tobacco.
“I
hate undead."
Roni and Karlini looked at each
other. "Uh, Max?" Karlini said.

Chapter4
SHAA OUT OF
PRACTICE
ZALZYN SHAA FLED EAST, hav-
ing left Drest Klaaver just ahead of the
squad bearing orders for his arrest on a
charge of practicing medicine without
a license. Shaa’s skills as a physician
were not in question. His license, how-
ever, had been issued by the preced-

ing government, which had left power
abruptly and without advance notice.
Shaa had been relaxing in his lodg-
ings at the back of his consulting room,
his feet up on an ottoman, browsing
through a recent case digest from the
Imperial Conclave of Physicians, when
the former Chief of Police had arrived
to request his services.
The former
Chief of Police had made this request
by the simple expedient of launching
himself through a window from the
street, demolishing Shaa’s coat rack,
and collapsing onto the rug, bleed-
ing profusely and (Shaa determined
quickly) in a fairly terminal fashion.
Shaa, estimating the consequences of
being associated, in even such a cir-
cumstantial manner, with the losing
side in a power grab, had quickly liq-
uidated his practice and packed his
tools and light valuables on the former

Chief of Police’s horse, which he appro-
priated in lieu of other payment for his
services. He rode swiftly through the
Bridegroom Gate at the west end of
the city, made a wide detour through
the northern agricultural district, and
headed east for the river.
Pursuit, as Shaa had expected, was
not signiﬁcant, the new government
undoubtedly having better ways to
squander
its
resources
than
bring-
ing down players of no conceivable
worth to anyone but themselves, es-
pecially those with the bad taste not
to present themselves neatly for in-
carceration.
Shaa wasn’t too upset
about his strategic departure. He had
discovered early in his apprenticeship
that medicine, exercised with whole-
minded diligence and without a leaven-
ing of other projects, offered something
less than comprehensive satisfaction.

As a result, Shaa’s professional his-
tory tended toward bouts of medical
practice interspersed with abrupt ca-
reer shifts. He had been established in
Drest Klaaver for almost three years -
leavened, it was true, by several signif-
icant episodes of mortal peril – but for
him this amounted to virtual stagna-
tion. It had been time for a change, he
reﬂected, and a new taste of the open
road.
The road was clear, the surrounding
ground cultivated and gently rolling,
and it was spring to boot. The clear air
was full with the smell of young grass,
turned earth, and the occasional cow.
Small towns and hamlets came and
went. Shaa rode patiently, doing calis-
thenics in the mornings and working
out with his rapier at noon, appreciat-
ing just how well his shattered tibia
and assorted sesamoids had come back

together without even the trace of a
limp.
By the time Roosing Oolvaya
and the mist of the river appeared on
the horizon, Shaa felt ready for them.
Some of the peasants and townspeo-
ple Shaa had spoken to as he neared
the city had told him rumors of grow-
ing unrest and political instability. The
tales hadn’t bothered him much - Roos-
ing Oolvaya was always in a state of
unrest, and instability was something
of a local custom. Still, as the sprawl-
ing district that had overgrown and
then surrounded the city walls grew
nearer, it became apparent that actual
checkpoints had been set up and pa-
trols were on the roads. Smoke from
several ﬁres hung in oily nets above
the city.
A permanent bazaar of tents and
stalls and cut-rate stableyards for car-
avans lined the shoulders of the major

west road, but no structures intruded
on the roadbed itself. There was trafﬁc
in both directions. Farmers and their
carts predominated, but a trickle of
refugees headed outward as well. Shaa
watched faces as the former Chief of
Police’s horse ambled on. Amid the soil-
rooted and weather-gouged stolidity of
the farmers and the city-honed crafti-
ness of the residents was a mixture
of hues, creases, shapes, and statures
from places further aﬁeld; all human,
but not without their human share of
diversity. The cosmopolitan air was cer-
tainly not unusual in a district given
over to itinerants and traders, quick
deals and quick ﬁghts, but the typi-
cally boisterous and surging character
of the place was subdued.
A general
feeling of wariness lay atop everyone’s
features.
Well, Shaa thought, that is ﬁne with

me.
Whenever something broke, one
kind of person left (or hid in the cellar)
and another kind of person showed up.
He had been both, at one time or an-
other. At the moment he felt like the
kind that showed up. Of course, he was
out of practice.
The western gate drew up and the
militia on duty waved him through.
Shaa found a stable a short distance
inside and left off the horse, shoulder-
ing the saddlebags, and walked on,
checking his bearings and reassuring
himself that he could still get around
in the city. There had been no recent
ﬂoods, so there was little danger of
civic renewal substantially changing
things. The next block - ah. He turned
into an alley. The alley, scarcely wide
enough for a large person, narrowed
further,
its protruding second-story
balconies
drooping
to
within
head-

cracking range, then wound to the
right and suddenly terminated after
an abrupt twist to the left again at
a closet-sized cul-de-sac surrounded
by blank three-story walls.
Several
ferns protruded from the dusty ground.
Shaa parted the leaves, revealing a
grating.
He wrestled the grating to
one side and stretched an arm down
into the shaft, feeling along the facing
stones.
The ﬁrst stone was solid, as
was the second, and the third – but
then the third stone tingled suddenly
against his hand and wobbled under
his touch. Excellent, it was still keyed
to him. He pulled the now-loose stone
free, exposing a recess in the wall. Ah,
Shaa thought again. Quite satisfying.
Rummaging through the saddlebags,
Shaa selected a sack of supplies and
a pile of assorted implements, which
he secreted about his person.
The

saddlebags ﬁt neatly into the gap in
the grating shaft.
He slid the stone
into its slot and the grating into its
frame and started back along the al-
ley. Two twists before the exit to the
street, Shaa heard a mufﬂed thud from
around the bend in front of him, as that
of a head encountering a low-hanging
balcony, followed by a whispered but
scathing curse. Letting his cloak fall
back, Shaa reached across his body and
grasped the hilt of the rapier on his hip.
A young man in a red and yellow tunic
stepped around the corner, rubbing his
forehead with one hand and waving a
long blade with the other.
"Yes?" Shaa said.
The man looked up, startled, his
eyes snapped to Shaa’s shoulder, where
Shaa was now not carrying his saddle-
bags, his eyes narrowed as a look of
avarice appeared on the face around

them, and he turned the point of his
blade toward Shaa.
Shaa brought
his own point up as he lunged. Shaa
visualized his blade puncturing the
right ventricle and severing the de-
scending aorta, but he had decided
to be lenient.
He was, after all, a
physician, and that did involve cer-
tain oaths and a particular underlying
philosophy, no matter that they might
prove inconvenient from time to time.
The man beat ineffectually as Shaa’s
sword punched through his right bi-
ceps and neatly withdrew. The bravo
staggered back against the wall, his
own blade dropping from his ﬁngers
and his other hand clasping his wound,
and sank slowly to the ground.
His
mouth made an open astonished cir-
cle.
Shaa stepped over his legs and
continued toward the exit.
As Shaa reentered the street,
a

small pack of dogs appeared going
the other way,
back into the alley.
"Ah," Shaa said again, inclining his
head pleasantly at them. "My compli-
ments." The last dog nodded back, and
Shaa strolled off into the city.
The old part of Roosing Oolvaya
was
a
cramped
place,
constrained
by the shapes of the city walls and
the crabbed windings of the narrow
streets. Even in the bazaars and busi-
ness districts the crowds were sparse.
People looked over their shoulders and
walked lightly, keeping watch for mer-
cenaries, the militia, and the Guard.
Some stores were closed, many with
boards thrown up and rudely nailed
across doors and shattered windows,
while other stores and buildings had
been sacked and burned.
Smashed
merchandise lay trampled on the cob-
blestones.

Several
times
Shaa
encountered
bands of armed men marching freely
through the streets.
They wore arm-
bands showing an unfamiliar rune that
looked, to Shaa, roughly like a ﬂaming
purple pretzel. Shaa was not accosted,
though some of the troopers eyed him
expectantly and ﬁngered their swords.
It was still early in the afternoon, the
day was pleasant, and tempers were
comparatively mild, though, so it ap-
peared that the different forces were
not yet spoiling for trouble.
Shaa wandered in a roughly east-
ward direction with his ears open for
news. Finally the street he was on took
a sharp zag and unexpectedly opened
onto the Boulevard of the Fifth Great
Flood. The Boulevard, much wider and
with a much more lively atmosphere
than the earlier streets, was the center
of the waterfront entertainment dis-

trict.
Muggy breezes from the docks
and wharves ﬁve blocks east rolled
in sluggish currents toward the rest
of the city. Equally muggy sailors off
the river barges were rolled in along
with then. Shaa stepped around three
mariners snoring in a happy pile at
the intersection and ambled down the
Boulevard.
Most of the entertainers had re-
moved themselves from the street, al-
though a number leaned from second-
story windows, surveying the trafﬁc
and making an occasional proposition.
Shaa checked them over with a pro-
fessional eye.
He had spent time on
the Boulevard.
Aside from his long-
standing fondness for the Fifth Great
Flood, he had once combined a part-
time job as Waterfront Health Inspec-
tor and Tariff-Collector with a fairly
lucrative smuggling racket.

During Shaa’s walk, curfew notices
had begun appearing around the city.
Shaa, along with most of the popula-
tion, had no intention of actually stay-
ing indoors, but he decided he might
as well put his feet up for a bit and see
if the world would provide anything
interesting for free, at least a mini-
mum of investment. Shaa was known
to make house calls, and he didn’t see
why the world should be less particular.
He ran through his memories of the lo-
cal inns.
The Wyvern’s Fodder had
been his favorite in Roosing Oolvaya,
but it was near the north wall, at least
a half-hour’s walk away. Hmm . . . he
had once spent productive time at -
what was that place?
As it turned out, the place was the
Bilious Gnome, and it was only two
blocks north. The inn was embedded
in the ground ﬂoor of a three-story

building constructed in the classical
Roosing Oolvaya style. The lower two
ﬂoors were relatively utilitarian, with
prominent hardwood beams meeting
at right angles to frame and support
the whitewashed facade.
The upper
ﬂoor, though, was a general riot of
overhanging, protruding, and rippling
timbers zigzagging and colliding in
clever patterns, leaving the overall im-
pression of a trestle bridge ﬁlled in
with patches of plaster.
Egg-shaped
and squared-off windows of different
sizes occupied the larger spaces be-
tween the timbers.
Because of the
haphazard layout of the beams, all the
windows for each story were not on the
same level.
In fact, the curving win-
dows with their rippling glass seemed
to bounce and bound all up and down
the walls.
Although the views from
some of the lower windows on each

story could only be appreciated when
you were lying on the ﬂoor, conversely
affording passers-by in the street a
sight of the feet and legs within, Shaa
thought the net effect was rather artis-
tic, at least when the street was wide
enough to stand back and appreciate it.
Unfortunately, the streets rarely were
that generous, with the characteristic
overhang of the upper stories making
the viewing situation even worse.
By Roosing Oolvaya standards, the
building housing the Bilious Gnome
was unremarkable.
A chipped sign-
board hanging out over the Boulevard
showed the portrait of a yellowish
gnome, his pointy ears wilting. Shaa
gave it a nod, pushed open the door
beneath the sign, and went in.
Circles and ovals of light from the
street lit up the walls.
Shaa planted
himself in a corner on a long bench

with a view of the door and rested his
elbows on the wood slab table. The bar
behind him divided the customers from
the bottles and kegs. From the other
end of the common room, a staircase
led upward, disappearing out of sight
behind an alcove. A half-dozen other
early patrons drank or talked quietly,
while a kettle slurped in the low ﬂame
of the hearth.
The innkeeper appeared and sup-
plied a mug. Shaa traced ﬁgures in the
wet circles on the table, wondering if
the world really would give him a hand
and toss him something useful. It had
happened before: he had a reputation
for luck which, after all, was attested
to by the fact that he was still alive.
He stared absently through one of
the front windows and onto the street.
Yellowish streaks and a formation of
large bubbles in the glass rippled in

the declining sunlight.
Glassmaking,
Shaa recalled, was a highly proﬁtable
industry in Roosing Oolvaya, but not
because the glassmakers were very
good at what they did.
The techni-
cal processes of making glass were
fairly much frozen at their current
level, bubbles and all, but somehow
the glassmakers had managed to turn
ﬂaws and pockmarks and irregular col-
ors into something approaching an art
form. It was one of the best solutions
to working within the god-mandated
limits on technology Shaa had ever
seen.
During his tenure in Waterfront
Health, Shaa had somehow ended up
as part owner of a glass shop.
He
tried to remember what had become
of it. On this visit, perhaps he would
hunt up his former business manager
and ﬁgure out just how much of the

city his investments had by now left
him owning. Across the Boulevard, a
trio of itinerant musicians had planted
themselves in a clear spot against the
wall of a spice merchant. They ﬁnished
unpacking their equipment, a set of
hides stretched taut around nested he-
lices of wood and bone, and prepared
to rhythmically strike the hides with
ivory paddles.
Over the noise of the
street trafﬁc and the insulating qual-
ity of the Bilious Gnome, Shaa could
hear nothing of the trio as they tuned
up.
That was ﬁne with him; he was
not a fan of country music. For some
reason, though, his absent gaze kept
returning to them.
Having arranged each other to their
mutual satisfaction,
the three men
raised their paddles. Out of a narrow
alley just to their left ran a panting
young man, a boy really, his hair wild

and his manner frantic. The boy hes-
itated, wobbling as he checked his
momentum and glanced around for a
new direction to run. His gaze locked
on the musicians as their paddles de-
scended. Even through the distortion
of the window glass Shaa saw a look
of desperate shock appear on the boy’s
race as he suddenly recognized an im-
minent doom.
The boy spun around
in a convulsive swirl.
The paddles
came down and began to pound, and
the boy jerked to an abrupt stop in
mid-turn.
His arms ﬂopped to his
sides, he sagged, the energy and the
animation seemed to ﬂow out of him
into the ground.
In a way anyone
without Shaa’s understanding of the
mechanisms that kept the world on its
track might have called blind chance,
the boy’s face came to rest in a pris-
tine splinter of immaculately coherent

glass, his eyes meeting Shaa’s across
the street and window and common
room. The face was slack; the eyes had
rolled up, showing the scleral white of
oblivion.
Shaa straightened.
His face lit.
"Ah!" he said.
He bounced to his
feet, ran through the door and into
the street, elbowed aside an enticingly
dressed young woman and the heavily
whiskered riverboat man who had his
hand on her hip, and reached the boy
at the mouth of the alley. The boy had
started to sag limply to the ground.
Shaa pinched him on the bridge of
the nose, quite hard.
The boy failed
to react; his eyes neither moved nor
blinked.
"Ah," Shaa said again.
He
put an arm around the boy’s shoulders,
lifted him partly off the ground, and
started toward the Bilious Gnome. A
hand reached in from the side and

closed on the front of Shaa ’ s cloak.
"Not so fast, huh," said the whiskered
sailor, his voice mufﬂed by the under-
brush covering his face.
"What d’yer
think yer doing, shoving me around,
me and my, friend, here?"
"My apologies," Shaa said.
"My
friend is not well."
The sailor looked suspiciously at
them. "Not the plague, i’n it?"
"There are many plagues," Shaa said.
"Who can say?"
The
sailor
looked
at
the
young
woman,
then
straightened
himself
and stuck out his chin.
"Plague or
no plague, what I go to do, I should
take yer face and -"
Shaa looked at the young woman
himself and raised his eyebrow sug-
gestively.
She obligingly canted one
hip and nudged the sailor. The sailor
followed Shaa’s look, the young woman

batted her eyelashes, and the sailor’s
grip loosened and fell away.
Shaa
quickly reentered the Bilious Gnome,
dragging his ﬂoppy companion.
The
thump-twang of the paddle trio faded
as Shaa kicked the door closed. Shaa
dropped his burden on a bench, rest-
ing the boy’s head on the table, and
resumed his own seat across the table.
The boy stirred, his head twitched,
and then he pulled himself up and
looked around, blinking his eyes.
"My name is Shaa," said Shaa. "I am
a physician."
The boy’s gaze focused on Shaa and
turned wary. Shaa, with some charity,
estimated the kid’s age as fourteen.
"Where are we? You better not try to
bleed me."
Shaa raised an eyebrow. "Certainly
not. Do you take me for a barbarian?"
"You said you were a physician." The

kid shook his head, trying to clear it.
"Well struck," Shaa said. "Although
I practice medicine, I do so with dis-
cretion. Allow me to emphasize the el-
ement of discretion, and your present
degree of relative safety in having been
removed from the street."
"The street -" The kid tensed, spun
around to stare through the window,
then spun back. "What do you want?"
he said in sudden desperation.
Shaa, who had allowed his eyebrow
to drop, raised it again. "You present a
matter for curiosity, and potential pro-
fessional interest. How far behind you
do you think your pursuers actually
were, by the way?"
"You’re holding me for the Guard,
aren’t you," the boy said, his attempt
at a snarl emerging as more of a whine.
Shaa spread his hands.
"I under-
stand a certain need for caution, espe-

cially with your condition, but let’s not
get ridiculous. If I had wanted to turn
you over to the Guard, or anyone else
for that matter, the difﬁculty would
have been minimal."
"I don’t know you and I don’t need
you. I’m getting out of here."
"Be my guest. Perhaps you actually
did lose them."
The kid hesitated, then rose. "On the
other hand," Shaa said, "perhaps you
didn’t." Shaa glared up at him.
The
kid plopped down.
"Sir,” Shaa went
on, “may I note that this is getting us
nowhere."
The kid leaned over the table and
hissed, "All right, you.
I need a sor-
cerer. Are you a sorcerer?"
"No," Shaa drawled, extracting the
vowel as slowly if it were a recalcitrant
tooth, although "Not at the moment"
would have been more precise. "In any

case, I doubt that’s exactly what you
need; magicians tend to be overrated.
What’s your name?"
"Jurtan. Jurtan Mont." The kid sud-
denly sounded exhausted. He had had
enough fortitude to keep it back thus
far, though. Perhaps he had potential.
"Are you from around here, Mr. Shaa?"
"Shaa will do.
I pass through ev-
ery now and then." He signalled the
owner, raised two ﬁngers.
"Do you
drink?" Shaa said as an afterthought,
as the man scuttled back to his kegs
and splashed froth.
"Uh . . . yeah, yeah sure."
"You should try it, my ﬁrst prescrip-
tion. A modest dose of alcohol may re-
duce the frequency of your attacks."
"My attacks? What are you talking
about - what do you know about -"
"Alcohol changes the level of irri-
tability of the central nervous system,"

Shaa said.
The owner dropped the
drinks on the table, sloshing the con-
tents of Shaa’s over the lip of the mug.
Shaa moved to the left along his bench,
avoiding a runoff channel. "Drink up."
Jurtan Mont took up one mug, look-
ing suspiciously at it.
"You’re sure this is healthy?"
Shaa peered over the rim of his own
mug, sniffed. "You have a point. Still,
you are on the run, so by deﬁnition you
need every possible advantage you can
get."
Mont’s fact tightened and turned a
sudden white. “I know what I’m doing,
I don’t need you to insult me."
Shaa looked up at the ceiling, silently
asking the universe if it knew quite
what it was doing this time. "Look, my
putative friend, I have much of value
to offer, and I am offering it, provision-
ally, for free, so if you would please

stop trying to ﬁnd -"
Jurtan Mont swung his mug and
tossed the contents at Shaa’s face.
Shaa, demonstrating a level of agility
not expected from his generally stocky
frame, ﬂipped himself off the bench,
did a backward somersault, and fetched
up with his neck wedged against the
bar, avoiding most of the ﬂying ale. “I
don’t need you and I don’t want you,"
Mont said again, and stalked toward
the door.
He kicked it open, walked
two steps through it, and went slack.
The trio of paddlers was still thomping
away across the street.
A chorus of cries and the tumult of
running feet burst from the left side
out of view down the block.
Shaa
staggered to his feet.
A small band
of rapidly charging men appeared in
the leftmost windows. Swearing under
his breath, Shaa ran through the bar

toward the collapsing Mont. The lead
Guardsman shouted, "There, there he
is! It’s him!” with his arm out pointing
at Mont.
Behind him were more soldiers, a
whole troop in fact.
Without stopping, Shaa grabbed a
mug from the last table and hurled it
as he slid through the doorway.
The
mug ﬂew past Mont’s ear and shat-
tered against the nose of the ﬁrst sol-
dier.
Shaa skidded to a stop as the
rest of the platoon converged on the
bar, snagged the back of Mont’s collar,
and heaved. Mont’s feet left the pave-
ment, he ﬂew parabolically backward
through the doorway into the Bilious
Gnome, and as he fell to the ﬂoor Shaa
let go of his collar, slammed the door,
and overturned the closest table in
front of it.
Glass splintered.
Shaa looked up

and saw a Guardsman climbing through
the remains of one of the oval front win-
dows. The door heaved with a sound
of creaking wood as it was hit by the
weight of four strong men. Shaa looked
around, then put his foot on the end
of a bench and shoved.
The bench
slid across the ﬂoor and into the knee
of the window-climbing Guardsman.
who had just jumped to the ﬂoor. The
knee folded sideways and the man fell
against the wall.
Shaa hoisted the
semi-conscious Mont by his shirt and
headed for the stairs.
"My window!" the tapster yelled.
Then, "My other window, oh, gods,
what next?"
"What
indeed?"
Shaa
murmured.
Mont took on his own weight and
reeled up the stairs as three windows
disgorged Guardsmen behind them.
Shaa ran after him, hearing the front

door disintegrate.
Mont stopped at
the top of the staircase and turned to
look back.
His mouth dropped open.
Shaa swung an elbow at him, knock-
ing him through the door leading off
the landing, and then with his other
hand withdrew a small membranous
bladder from beneath his cloak.
The
bladder bulged and churned, its shim-
mering silver surface dancing with
rainbow highlights like the skin of a
ﬁsh. Shaa paused in the doorway, look-
ing back at the ﬁve soldiers starting
after him up the stairs, and grinned
at them. He worked a ﬂeshy valve on
the bladder and carefully squirted a
small stream of liquid onto the two
beams holding the staircase to the
wall. The liquid foamed, sizzled, and
dug through the wood with astonish-
ing speed.
The staircase leaned over
with a horrendous grinding screech,

and then, with an even louder crack, it
broke off, pivoted over, and hit the ﬂoor
in one long THUDD! that shook the
building, not to mention the soldiers
who had been climbing it. A small nox-
ious cloud hung in the air. Shaa bowed,
stamped on the clutching ﬁngers of
the lead soldier, clinging desperately
to the now-stairless sill, listened for
the thump, and closed the door. "Fortu-
nately they have yet to bring archers,"
he said, clapped the dazed Mont on a
shoulder, and sprinted down the hall.
Mont staggered after him.
"What
was that stuff you just used there?" he
said.
The hall jogged off at an angle, and
beyond the bend was the continua-
tion of the staircase leading up to the
third ﬂoor.
"That ’stuff’," Shaa said,
bounding up the steps, "was obtained
at great cost and no little risk from a

small amphibian resident in certain
southern swamps."
"Obtained? By you?"
“In fact, no." Shaa reached the small
landing at the top and saw the opening
to a trap door in the ceiling above him.
A beam slipped through a set of iron
brackets held the trap closed.
Shaa
knelt, made a basket of his hands,
caught Mont’s foot as he came off the
last step, and pushed him into the air.
“Wha?" Mont said.
“The beam, idiot. Push the beam."
"Oh." Mont heaved, dislodging the
beam from the runners. The beam hit
the ﬂoor on its end, narrowly missing
Shaa’s foot, teetered, and crashed over.
Mont pushed up, Shaa pushed Mont,
and the trap door lifted slowly on wail-
ing hinges. Then they heard pounding
footsteps and renewed cries, but now
from the second ﬂoor just below them.

"Grab hold,” Shaa shouted.
He
threw Mont upward through the open-
ing, hearing a strangled yelp, bent,
and seized the locking beam. A group
of soldiers turned the corner below and
trampled onto the steps. Shaa grunted
and shoved the beam, the beam left the
ﬂoor at the top of the stairs and ﬂew
downward, things were quiet for half-
a-second, and then the air ﬁlled with
wails and the sound of a vast crashing
and bashing.
Shaa looked up. Mont had one leg
over the trap door’s sill, and both arms.
"I’m stuck," he said.
"No, you’re not," Shaa said. "It’s all
a matter of attitude." Mont strained
and rolled over the edge onto the roof.
"That’s much better," Shaa continued
approvingly.
Mont’s face reappeared,
and an outstretched arm next to it.
Shaa jumped, caught the hand, and

boosted himself out.
"Now what?” said Mont, panting.
Shaa let the trap door drop and sur-
veyed the terrain.
They were on the roof of the Bil-
ious Gnome’s building, a ﬂat roof that
sloped sharply down at the edges in
a plane of shingles and rose here and
there in a checkerboard of boxy rooms
and platforms; the exit from the trap
door was in the middle of one of the
elevated platforms.
The surrounding
buildings were similar. "This way,” said
Shaa. He broad-jumped across the gap
to the next platform, took two running
steps, and jumped again. Another leap
brought him to the Bilious Gnome’s
rear, overlooking an alley. The top ﬂoor
of a four-story building confronted him
across the alley, an unleapable gap up
and away.
Mont joined him, much more cau-

tiously. "If you don’t stop gritting your
teeth," Shaa told him, “your jaw will
freeze up, making speech uncomfort-
able." Shaa had produced a rope and
small grapnel.
He whirled it twice
around his head and slung it across
the alley.
"No," Mont said, turning even whiter.
"The choice is yours," said Shaa, ir-
ritated.
The trap door they had left
across the roof swung open with a
clunk. The clamor of voices was again
clearly audible, and did not sound at
all pleased. Mont tugged on the rope.
It was solid. Shaa braced his hold on
the free end and gestured. Mont took
a deep breath and a double handhold
and swung out.
The Guard erupted out of the trap-
hole, spotting Shaa immediately. Mont
was halfway across. Shaa surveyed the
distances, calculated rates of motion

- a man with a bow appeared at the
front of the soldiers. "Hold on!” Shaa
yelled. He slapped a coil of rope around
his waist, ran at the edge of the build-
ing, and dropped. An arrow streaked
over his head, narrowly missing the
tightening rope. Shaa swung out over
the alley and hit the wall of the four-
story building with both feet. The alley
beneath was ﬁlling with troops. Shaa
streaked up the rope, using all avail-
able feet and hands, pausing only to
dislodge a large ﬂowerpot from a con-
venient third-ﬂoor ledge, reached the
roof, and ﬂopped over the eave just
ahead of a ﬂight of arrows aimed for-
tuitously low.
The roof was ﬂat, and
lacked Mont.
"Over here!" Mont yelled. Shaa spot-
ted a waving arm on the next roof over,
pulled the grapnel free as he passed it
on the run, and vaulted over the edge.

Mont caught him. "Why are you doing
this?" Mont said.
Shaa found his feet and looked
around.
The next set of roofs went
up and down, each a half-story differ-
ent in height, like a long row of square
sawteeth.
"I need an adventure," he
said, launching himself at the next
building.
"What?"
"There’s a curse," Shaa said absently.
"Come on." He vanished over the edge.

Chapter5
SHOP TALK
MAX SLEPT POORLY. Karlini had
neglected to mention that even when
the castle wasn’t executing a major
move from place to place, it wasn’t
exactly quiet.
The castle spent the
night like a person with indigestion
from a meal involving onions and too
many beans, shifting restlessly and
rumbling under an occasional burp. At

half-past six Max gave up and headed
for the kitchen.
Ronibet and Karlini
were already present, looking equally
haggard.
"Nice neighborhood you’ve got here,"
Max said, squinting down at the table
and trying to butter a roll.
"Some nights are worse than others,"
Ronibet said.
She had her nose bal-
anced on the edge of a mug of coffee,
breathing in the fumes.
A crackling and snapping sound
came from one wall, up near the roof.
They looked up as a green tracer of
ball lightning burst through the wall,
leaving it singed, and swooped through
the air like a dying comet. It dove into
a cauldron in a splash of green spark-
ing water and disappeared. The water
in the cauldron glowed a ﬂuorescent
forest green that slowly faded.
They
returned their attention to the table.

"All night," said Max, "all night with
the green glowing balls and the spec-
tral voices in the ears and the cold
spots in the bed." Wroclaw brought
over his eggs, scrambled. "This place
could drive you batty.
I can see why
you want to get out."
"I don’t know where it’s all coming
from," Karlini mumbled.
He was al-
ready on his second cup of coffee but
was only beginning to look sentient.
"All these manifestations just reek of
energy, but I’ve been looking for weeks
and damned if I can ﬁnd the source."
"This place was set up by a god,"
Max said with his mouth full, “and
gods operate on the second quantum
energy state, that’s why they’re gods.
It’s easier to set up stable power reser-
voirs on the second quantum level.
One reason gods usually have so much
power to burn."

Karlini had stopped eating and was
staring at Max with his mouth hanging
open and his eyes all of a sudden fully
alert.
"Max," he said carefully, "how
did you ﬁnd that out? That’s more new
knowledge than anybody’s been able to
learn about the gods in ﬁfty years."
"Good eggs," Max said.
"Thanks,
Wroclaw.
Can I have another roll?"
Roni passed him the basket.
"My compliments to the oven master,
too." Haddo leaned in from the kitchen,
the top of his dark hood dusted with
ﬂour, then vanished again. Max care-
fully selected a ﬂuffy butter twist with
a ﬂaky crust.
Karlini was still staring.
"Max,"
Roni said, "I’m afraid my husband is
having some sort of attack."
"Shaa’s never around when you need
him, is he?" Max commented. "These
are good rolls."

"At least Shaa usually answers a
straight question."
"You do get an answer out of him,"
Max said, "but the answer usually goes
with a different question."
Karlini pointed a ﬁnger.
"You’ve
had run-ins with the gods before, we
all know you have," he said.
“They
don’t like you, and you’re still alive -
I’ve never ﬁgured out how you manage
that, either."
Max looked up, gazed at Karlini with
a very thoughtful expression. "Not all
of the gods don’t like me," he said even-
tually.
"Most of them don’t like each
other very much, that’s probably the
key point." He was silent for another
moment. "Not that it’s much use in any
given situation."
"But how -"
"I think maybe you’re better off not
knowing too much about it," Max said,

"don’t you think?" He took a bite from
his roll.
"You made that remark about quan-
tum energy states, not me," said Kar-
lini.
"If you didn’t think we should
know about it, why did you bring it up
in the ﬁrst place? It couldn’t be that
you were just showing off, now could
it?"
Max opened his mouth, then closed
it and chewed his roll with a medita-
tive expression.
"Your point is well
taken," he said. "I do have certain ten-
dencies, as you know, and as you also
know, I try to resist them, not always
with success."
He swallowed the roll and wiped
his mouth with a napkin. "As it hap-
pens, I have been doing some fresh
research, and some of it has turned
out to involve the gods.
I will show
you some of it later, as long as you’re

so eager to know.
That way, at least
somebody may be able to use it, in case
this damn-fool errand of yours turns
out to be as nasty as it probably will.
Are you satisﬁed?"
Karlini looked across at an étagère
holding a dazzling array of dried goods
and condiments, somewhat if unchar-
acteristically embarrassed.
A tremor
ran through the room, rattling the
table and breaking the silence.
Max
sighed and shook his head, looking
around for the possibility of a pastry.
"What a place you’ve got here," he said.
"The crowning touch last night was
the seagull. I could swear there was a
seagull ﬂying around outside my room,
screeching like crazy. Now, really - you
know how far this place is from the
coast?
No seagull could survive the
trip. Any seagull that tried to ﬂy here
would be on its grandchildren by now."

Karlini held out his arm.
A seag-
ull ﬂapped down from the ceiling and
perched.
It screeched once.
"It was
sitting on the bed this morning," Roni
said.
"I don’t think it’s anyone we
know.”
Max sighed again and climbed to his
feet. "I’m going to have to stop trying
to guess what’s coming next. Well, we
might as well get started."
MAX FLOPPED BACK ON THE
RUG AND PANTED. "Every time - I
forget - how exhausting - this nonsense
is," he gasped-. Symbols faded from the
air around him.
"Well?" Karlini said.
“What hap-
pened?”
"Didn’t you - see it?"
"I saw something," Karlini said, "but
I don’t exactly know what it really was.
It looked like . . . "
Max lifted himself on an elbow and

accepted a mug from Ronibet. He ap-
peared to have lost about three pounds
since breakfast. "You saw a sort of ma-
trix outline of the castle, right? Like
you were looking at it from three direc-
tions at the same time, only the views
were superimposed?"
"Yes, right. What was it?"
"That was the ﬁeld spell on the walls
of the castle.
That’s what you trig-
gered, and that’s what holds the place
together when it shifts.”
"But why was the geometry so dis-
torted?" Ronibet asked.
"Well,"
Max
said,
swallowing
a
chunk of hard candy from a large
bowl seated next to him on the ﬂoor,
"that’s the second quantum level for
you. Things are pretty strange there.
Did you see that big glowing mass at
the base of the castle matrix?"
"The thing that looked like a jewel

with tendrils coming out of the facets?"
Roni said.
"Yeah. That’s the power reservoir. It
permeates the rock foundation at the
base of the castle."
"I probed the rock," Karlini said,
"and I didn’t ﬁnd a thing."
"You need different techniques." Max
selected another candy, a blue one,
popped it in his mouth, and started to
suck on it. "There’s a lot going on in
the reservoir, but I couldn’t disentan-
gle it all. One thing I did see was that
the thing’s on a deadman trigger. The
rock is unstable and the ﬁeld holds it
together.
If the reservoir runs down
enough the rock falls apart."
"And if the rock falls apart -"
"Right," Max said. "The castle falls
in." The seagull strolled over to Max,
dipped its head into the candy bowl, se-
lected a green piece of crystal, tossed

it into the air, and caught it neatly on
the downswing. Its beak made crunch-
ing noises.
"Uh, Max," Karlini said, "then how
close is this reservoir to the danger
point?"
"I can barely even tell the thing is
there.
But it’s anybody’s guess how
many more jumps this place can take
without coming apart. Did you see that
little pulsing dot about three-quarters
of the way up?"
"I wondered about that. What was
it?"
"You. "
Karlini buried his head in his hands
and mumbled something unpleasant.
"One thing I don’t understand," Roni
said quickly. "If operating on this sec-
ond quantum level is so hard, how do
the gods do it?
Some of them don’t
sound too smart."

Max watched patterns form and
dissolve in his mug. "I think it’s some-
thing in their auras.
Somehow the
aura gives them a leg up, maybe ﬁlters
their perception for all I know, proba-
bly pumps their energy up too. There
could be an aural stabilizing factor
that gives a god easy access to the sec-
ond level, but damned if I know how it
works."
"Does it have something to do with
the coupling problem?"
"Maybe," Max said. "I don’t think so,
but it’s hard to tell. There’s more than
one way to deal with coupling."
Karlini snorted.
"Of course there’s
more than one way, that’s what -"
Roni looked at him.
"That’s not
what Max is saying. I know Max. Max
is saying that he’s thought of a new
approach to coupling, something that’s
pretty hot. Isn’t that right, Max?"

". . .
I wish I didn’t like you, Roni,
otherwise I could just be jealous you’re
so sharp, it’d be simpler.
Yeah, I
thought of something new, but it isn’t
all worked out yet." He climbed to his
feet and glared at Karlini. "Why don’t
you tell me about this setup in Roosing
Oolvaya?"
The seagull screeched. ". . . All right,
Max," Karlini said.
"This is the way
things look." He rose and went over
to a bookcase. The shelves had books
stuffed in at every angle, each book
leaning on the others around it for mu-
tual support.
Karlini ran his ﬁnger
along the spines of several volumes of
bound notepaper.
"Maybe this is it,"
he said, wrenched out a folio from the
bottom of a stack of ten, and watched
the stack collapse down into the space.
The rows the stack had been support-
ing folded in from both sides.

"No, I guess it isn’t this one," Karlini
said, paging through it.
"Do you remember the time he left
his hat right in front of him on the ta-
ble in a restaurant?" Max said to Roni.
"That big sombrero thing with the tas-
seled fringes, and bright pink to boot?
It was right under his chin, and he still
forgot it."
"That was our ﬁrst anniversary,"
Roni said, smiling at Karlini. "I think
he’s gotten worse, if that’s possible. Try
the book on the lectern, dear."
"Huh?" Karlini said.
"Oh, okay . . .
yes, that’s certainly it. How do you do
it, Roni?"
"It’s a concept known as ’order’," Max
said.
"Yes, you’ve always liked that sort
of thing, haven’t you, Max," Karlini
said with an air of distraction, rufﬂing
vellum.
He stopped, leafed back two

pages, set the book back on the lectern,
and started sketching in the air. A se-
ries of symbolic equations took shape,
winding around each other.
Max squinted. "Have I seen that one
before?"
Karlini paused and made a small
twirly gesture.
The equations halted.
He reached carefully around them and
pointed to one term.
"You see that
statement, Max? That’s the root. It’s
a corollary to your lousy Discontinuity
Proposition."
With lips pursed, Max tilted his
head to one side.
"Hmm." Then he
grabbed a tablet and began scribbling.
"You know, Max," Roni said, "Kar-
lini’s never forgiven you for proving
the Discontinuity proposition.
He’d
ﬁnally gotten comfortable with the
Doctrines of Conservation, and then
you came back and said it was ﬁne to

dig holes through them."
Karlini’s
equations
had
resumed
their winding and were beginning to
ﬂow into a structure. "The two aren’t
inconsistent," Max said, his attention
still on his scribbling.
"Conservation
works whether you’re there or not. Es-
tablishment of a discontinuity requires
the input of energy and imposition of a
high degree of control. If you -"
A snapping sound came from Kar-
lini’s workspace.
The ﬂoating ﬁgure
was now a rough meshwork sphere,
indentations and holes drifting across
the surface.
The mesh lines glowed
orange-yellow, brighter sparks ﬂaring
where the lines intersected. The con-
struct rotated slowly, wobbling in two
axes, making a low whirr in the air. A
prominent hump on the globe’s north-
ern hemisphere jumped in and out,
the snapping sound coordinated with

the oscillations. Max looked down at
his tablet, nodding to himself, quickly
scribbled another line at the bottom,
closed his eyes, and drew his ﬁnger in
a curlicue pattern along the writing.
His ﬁnal line of equations glowed blue,
rose off the paper into the air, and shot
over into the ﬂoating globe, weaving
itself into the surface.
The hump evened out.
"I never thought of that." Karlini
said, surprised.
"Go ahead, try it."
Karlini concentrated and gestured.
The ball’s equator wafﬂed wildly and
started to spike. "No." Max said, "it’s
a modulator." He sketched in the air,
leaving hanging ﬁgures.
"This is the
command string, this is the modiﬁer.
The modiﬁer has nine matrix terms
and . . .
" The equator settled down.
"There, you’ve got it now."

Karlini smoothed the other tran-
sients. "Thanks, Max, I’ve been won-
dering what to do about that.
Now,
we aim it." Six depressions appeared
at equidistant spots, top, bottom, and
four compass corners, holding position
as the surface swept over them. "Coor-
dinate axes."
"Right."
The hollows tilted as a unit, for-
ward, to one side, spun slowly, reached
inward. The structure shuddered, col-
lapsed into itself, and faded from sight,
leaving the air slightly curdled. Max
clasped his hands behind his back and
paced slowly around the space, examin-
ing it closely. He gestured again. The
spot of turgid air churned and then
smoothed.
There was no sign of the
construct. "Nice," Max said. "No visual
manifestation at all.
Good for a spy
probe."

"That’s the idea." A yellow point
glowed suddenly in the center of the
empty space.
Karlini made twirling
passes. The point stretched itself into
a line, rotated out of the void, and
became a ﬂat ring.
The cabinet of
alembics and other glassware on the
wall behind it faded from sight. Within
the ring, an aerial view of a walled city
appeared.
Karlini sank into a chair
and stretched out his legs.
"I logged
the coordinates from before.
This is
Roosing Oolvaya from about ten thou-
sand feet. We’re looking primarily at
the older section, inside the walls."
The walls themselves were not vis-
ible, but sharp straight edges divided
the overgrown and tangled confusion
of the original city from the ﬁelds and
the more open confusion of the sub-
urbs. "So what exactly are we looking
at here?" Max said.

"Roosing Oolvaya sits on the west
bank of the River Oolvaan," Roni said.
"The river takes a long curve out to
the east in this area and then loops
back to the west; the city’s right at the
eastern-most edge of this bulge. About
ﬁfteen miles downstream to the south
the Oolvaan splits into its three pri-
mary tributaries: the Greater, Lesser,
and Equivocal Oolvaans."
"The Equivocal Oolvaan’s the one
that ﬂoods, right?"
"Right. The east bank of the Oolvaan
is the start of the mountains,” Roni
went on, “the Rondingian Uplift and
the Rondingian Steeps. This castle’s on
the other side of the Steeps now, in the
middle of the desert. But the Oolvaan
attracts runoff from a considerable
distance on both banks - mountain
runoff from the east side and plains
and farms from the west.
As you go

north the terrain on the west bank
gradually becomes steeper and more
mountainous until it’s pretty much the
same as the east; that whole range is
the Rondingian Heights. The Oolvaan
starts somewhere up in there.
"Back to Roosing Oolvaya itself. As
I said, the city is on the west bank of
the Oolvaan at the eastern end of one
of its turns, where the river widens and
slows down. The city uses this natural
harbor shielded from the current by a
small cape at the north end and a chain
of’ islands in the middle of the river, ba-
sically a perfect location for the domi-
nation of river trafﬁc. Of the ﬁve major
islands, one has the port and warehous-
ing facilities, one’s being developed for
fancy residential use, two are private
estates, and the last has an old impe-
rial garrison fort that’s being used as
the palace of the Venerance."

"Venerance, eh?" Max said.
"It’s some kind of traditional title
newly revived He’s addressed as ’Your
Venerance’ or ’Venerable Sir’."
"Wonderful. I’ll try not to meet him.
Will I have to?"
Karlini and Roni exchanged another
one of their glances.
"The situation’s
fairly confused,” said Roni. “It’s not im-
possible. Dear, give Max a closer look
at the view."
The scene expanded as the ﬁeld
zoomed in. Irregular blocks and streets
became visible, then individual build-
ings within the blocks.
Then - the
picture shimmered, a rash of mottled
blotches appeared scattered across the
surface, and the edge of the ﬂat view-
ing disc began to smoke.
"What -" said Max.
"I don’t know!" Karlini said.
The
blotches bulged out into the room, the

images around them stretching like
paintings on taffy. A horrendous high-
pitched whine built. One by one in a
rapid-ﬁre barrage the bubbling spots
abruptly popped like pricked balloons,
the view around each one fracturing
into kaleidoscope shards, and an in-
tense silver light burst in pulsing
rays through the holes.
Streamers
of lightning spread out and reached
for Karlini.
Karlini’s ﬁngers were a
blur, smoke and sparks coming from
them as well as from the ruptured disc.
"Max!" he yelled, "I can’t hold it!"
The image in the ring was gone and
the plate of silver light shone through
like a sun. Max, who had been gestur-
ing too, reeled off a string of ﬁgures.
The ﬁgures spun into formation and
darted into the ring.
The surface of
the silver plate heaved, the center
swelled up, and then Karlini’s original

meshwork ball pushed itself through,
the orange mesh framework trailing
interwoven threads of burning silver.
Karlini’s construct was no longer a
ball but rather a writhing amoeboid
blob, its neat grid lines shooting off
in wild hyperbolic sprays, irregular
fragments curling back to pierce the
structure and coil through its walls. A
shudder ran through the blob as Max’s
second barrage danced along its sur-
face.
The roaring whine intensiﬁed.
Max’s amulet, which had been quiv-
ering on his chest, jumped out of his
shirt, lights playing in the tiny sap-
phires and larger stones. A tendril of
lightning grazed the seagull and one of
its tail feathers burst into ﬂame. Roni,
who had been deﬂecting the lightning,
was sheeting sweat, her hands quiver-
ing in violent tremors, fasciculations
twitching over her brow. The center of

the silver disc opened and drew back.
Behind it was a giant eye.
“Enough
of
this
nonsense,"
Max
growled. He thrust his left hand into
the bowl of hard candies, closed his
eyes, gritted his teeth, and concen-
trated.
A small concave plate, the
concave surface covered with fuzz and
the back side festooned with multi-
colored lumps and tubes and strange
waving appendages, appeared in the
air over the bowl. Almost faster than
vision could discriminate, the plate
split into four much smaller but other-
wise identical versions of itself, each
of the four split into four, those split
and split again, how many times an
observer could not possibly tell, and
then this cloud of spinning motes dove
down Max’s arm and into his hand.
The bowl heaved and blew apart,
fragments
of
bowl
and
pulverized

candy spraying around the room like
tiny, brightly colored missiles.
Max’s
ﬁst, though, had clenched around a
handful of the candies, and a swirling
haze had appeared around his hand.
Strong red light leaked from between
his ﬁngers, streaming directly into the
haze, as the haze seemed to be vacu-
uming the light up into itself. Bands
of light ran up his arm like small an-
imals through a boa constrictor. Max
raised his arm, the hand still clenched,
raised it over his head, turned it be-
hind his body - and then, with one
convulsive
hurling
swing,
whipped
his arm around.
A ball of sizzling
plasma hurtled out of Max’s hand at
the head of a solid beam that started
at his shoulder and ran rippling down
his arm like a tubular stiletto.
The
plasma ball went through the center of
the ring into the questing eye and the

beam hit the silver disc. The disc ﬂew
into shreds. The silver congealed like
clotting blood as the disc dropped to
the ﬂoor, wobbled on one edge, toppled
over, and exploded. Globs of sizzling sil-
ver goo rained down. Low sizzles and
plops from the molten silver echoed in
the sudden silence.
Karlini and Roni pulled themselves
to their feet. The seagull peeped ten-
tatively out from under an overturned
armchair.
Max raised himself to a
sitting position, propping himself up
against the far wall, where the recoil
had thrown him. "You wanted to know
about coupling?" Max said, still grit-
ting his teeth. "That was coupling."
"It’s not very neat, is it," Karlini
said. He surveyed the room. The air
was thick with smoke and plumes rose
from the evaporating puddles of silver.
All the furniture was scattered back

around the walls.
Max’s left sleeve had been shred-
ded completely off and his arm was
bright red and oozing ﬂuid.
He gin-
gerly raised his arm, rotated it slowly
around his shoulder, clenched and un-
clenched his ﬁst. With his other hand
he eased his amulet back inside his
shirt.
The amulet had a disconcert-
ing habit of popping out at unexpected
times; Max didn’t know what all its
powers might be, but since it had cer-
tainly taken plenty of trouble to steal
the thing had to do something useful.
"I told you I don’t have the new cou-
pling method quite worked out yet," he
said. "This is the ﬁrst time I’ve tried to
use it. Always seems to work out that
way, doesn’t it? You wouldn’t happen
to have anything like a medicine kit
handy, would you?••
Karlini dug under the bookcase and

came up with a small singed satchel.
He withdrew a coil of linen and began
wrapping it around Max’s arm. "Yeow!"
Max said. "Feels like that arm’s been
out sunbathing in your desert there for
about a week."
"Just what kind of stunt was that,
exactly?" Roni said, still panting. She
was mopping her face with a piece of
one of the tablecloths.
"Nothing too fancy. I liberated a pile
of energy from those candy things and
threw it at that eye. Instead of just lib-
erating energy, it’d be better to incor-
porate it into other stuff, but, well.” He
shrugged. “Thanks, Karlini, that’s a lot
better."
"You want to lie down for awhile?"
Karlini said.
"Be better to just get on with it. Do
you want to lie down? You took a beat-
ing from those lightning bolts."

Karlini squatted back on his haunche
and crossed his arms. "If you can go on,
I can go on. You know, this didn’t hap-
pen the last time I looked at Roosing
Oolvaya."
"I ﬁgured as much;
I’m sure it
didn’t."
Roni was frowning over at Karlini.
"Oskin Yahlei evidently decided he
doesn’t want anybody checking up on
him.”
"Oskin Yahlei?” Max said.
"That’s who has the ring," Ron! said.
"That’s who you’re going after. I think
that’s whose eye was in that disc."
"Never heard of him. How are you so
sure he’s the one?"
"That dream I told you about?" Kar-
lini said. "The one I had upstairs in the
tower? It left me with a sense. That’s
how I found him in the ﬁrst place."
"H’m.
Well, that’s consistent, any-

way. I hope he didn’t get a good look
at me."
"You threw him quite a punch," Roni
said. "He may not be in any condition
to ﬁght with anyone for a while."
Max looked at her and grimaced. "I
don’t know.
That anti-spy ﬁeld had
a hell of a lot of power in it, plus it
was shielded against backlash. I don’t
know how much of my bolt really got
through.
Too bad I had to try a big
dumb power-blast in the ﬁrst place,
but it was the handiest thing I could
think of at the moment."
"So what you’re saying," Karlini
said, "you think that blast may have
only put him more on his guard?"
Max sighed. "If it was me, I’d take it
as a warning. Well, maybe he’ll think it
was another god, and he’ll at least have
the tact to be surprised when I show
up instead." He stretched his neck, try-

ing to work out some of the kinks from
skidding into the wall. "There’s noth-
ing to do for it now. You might as well
give me the rest of the story. I’d like
to know what else I’m letting myself in
for."
"You don’t want to try another probe?"
Karlini said. "Maybe a ﬁne-beam nee-
dle probe?"
Max stared at him, then ostenta-
tiously crossed his bandaged arm over
the good one.
"Ahem," Karlini said.
"Well, per-
haps the story might be best, at that."
He absent-mindedly righted his chair
and plopped into it. The left armrest
creaked over and fell off.
"Frankly,
Max, it’s not the best time to be visit-
ing Roosing Oolvaya. You’ll see troops
in the streets. The former Venerance
died a week or so ago under suspicious
circumstances. His son took over the

ofﬁce and turned out the local militia,
that is, the Guard, plus a horde of mer-
cenaries who conveniently happened
to be around."
Max had been testing his arm. He’d
have to keep exercising it, he decided,
or it would stiffen up.
"What do we
know about this son?" .
"From what I was able to pick up be-
fore, he was a classic fop-around-time,
with a vicious streak. Perfect puppet
material."
"Whose puppet?"
"You tell me. Big powerful magician,
wants to be a new force in town . . . "
"I had a feeling you were going to
say that. So this mess has politics in
it too." Max sighed again. "What about
old cabinet members, people loyal to
the old Venerance?"
"Dungeons are under the palace. A
lot of people seem to have been winding

up there."
"Curfew?"
"Sunset to sunrise.”
“Yeah, right,” said Max.
“Bound
to be more people creeping around at
night then during the day. Camouﬂage,
maybe, if I can keep from running into
trafﬁc jams on the rooftops.
What
about this Oskin Yahlei?"
"He has a place near the north wall,
I’ll show you on the map. He’s passing
himself off as a necromancer."
Max groaned.
"You’re going out of
your way to keep this from being any
fun at all, aren’t you?"
"I already warned you.
I men-
tioned there might be undead when
you brought it up before."
"I hoped you were joking."
"He may not be a real necromancer,
it could be just a disguise," Karlini said.
"You shouldn’t get so -"

Max levered himself back to his feet,
leaning his back against the wall, and
glowered off at nothing in particular.
"Disguise or not, you know as well as I
do that playing around with the dead is
ﬁlthy stuff. After something’s been in
the ground you don’t want to see it in
the air again. You ever been chased by
a gang of zombies? No?" Max ground
his teeth.
"Well, by the time they’ve
managed to claw their way out of the
earth they’re not much more than a
heap of glowing mold and squirming
maggots, scum, basically, with clods of
stuff falling off whenever they move.
They’ve also got an uncanny habit
of showing up upwind." He paused
in front of Karlini and switched the
glower to him.
"You think that’s dis-
gusting? - we’re not even talking about
the real undead yet.
As magical es-
thetics go, necromancy is pretty close

to the bottom of the pits.
Disguise,
hah! Anybody who would deliberately
disguise themselves as a necromancer
is stranger than I want to hear about.
He probably really is a necromancer,
worse luck."
"You’re not backing out, are you?"
Roni said.
Karlini had turned pink. "Of course
he’s pulling out, he’s afraid he’s going
to blow it."
"Dear," Roni said.
". . . All right, all right, Max, I apol-
ogize." said Karlini. "I know you don’t
like zombies, I should have put it a
different way. You haven’t blown any-
thing signiﬁcant in years, I know that,
that’s why you’ve got to take care of
this one."
"Max?" Roni said.
"Of course I’ll do it," Max said, "I
said I would, now let’s stop beating the

point to death.
You know me, some-
times I just need to complain.
Just
answer one thing for me, and then
we can start on the real preparations.
Who is he, really?"
"Who is who?” Karlini said.
“’Whom’," said Max, “and stop play-
ing around. You’ve been sitting around
in this castle for weeks, all you’ve
been doing is thinking about this mess,
you’ve got to have come up with at
least a good guess.
Who owns this
place? Who is it I’m going out to res-
cue? And while we’re at it, who is this
Oskin Yahlei?"
"Uh," Karlini said, "well, I really
don’t know. I wish I did, but -"
"It’s the one major point you’ve been
avoiding ever since I got here.
Now,
talk, or the deal’s off, really."
"I, uh, I’m not sure."
"I’m sure you’re not.
Just give me

your guess."
"You must have your own guess by
now, Max," Roni said.
She wouldn’t
quite meet Max’s eyes.
"Yeah," Max said, "I do.
I sure do.
That’s why I want to hear Karlini’s."
He ﬁxed Karlini with his sharpest
gaze. "Well? Who is it? Is it somebody
I know?"
Karlini slowly let out his breath. ". . .
Death. It’s one of the Deaths."
Max’s glower had brought most of
his face into shadow, his eye sockets
casting gloom down past his nose and
chin. Something glittered on his chest -
the ﬁligreed amulet. "Which one is the
Death?" he said, "Oskin Yahlei or the
castle master?"
". . .
Both of them. I think they’re
both Deaths."

Chapter6
THE CREEPING
SWORD STALKS
AGAIN
THE SKARGOOL RANSOM MONEY
was enough to let me live comfortably
for a year, but I was still sitting out
in front at the ofﬁce the next morning.
I’m not sure I could tell you why. You

work and you work until you get to a
point where you don’t have to work for
a while, and when you get to that point
you keep working anyway. Damned if
I understand it.
I didn’t think I had
anything of the freelance do-gooder in
me, I didn’t think I was the kind of
guy who’d keep doing what I should
get paid for, for free, but I’d been sur-
prised before.
Of course, as things
turned out, the ﬁrst business through
the door made me wish I’d caught the
ﬁrst barge out of town.
I had my feet up, just leaning back
and - like I said - feeling pretty good
about things for a change, when there
was a knock on the door.
There was
something surprising about that, and
even my mood of contentment wasn’t
enough to make me ignore it. It wasn’t
the fact that it was six-thirty in the
morning, when the butchers and farm-

ers had been at work for hours and
most everyone else was still dragging
themselves out of bed; when you do the
jobs I do you get to expect people barg-
ing in on you at all hours. With all the
skullduggery going on in the city dur-
ing the night an early morning visitor
wouldn’t have startled me one bit. So
it wasn’t the visitor that surprised me.
What surprised me was hearing the
knock on the door, and nothing else.
I’ve got my ofﬁce on the second ﬂoor
of an old building for a good reason.
The stairs creak. I went and loosened
them specially myself so they’d creak
even louder. I like to know people are
coming before they get up here.
The
neighbors hate the sound, but they
hate ﬁghts in my ofﬁce even more. Me,
I didn’t think anything larger than a
cat could make it up the stairs without
warning me.

And then there was a knock on the
door.
That was the strangest thing about
it.
If anyone was going to take the
trouble to get up the staircase without
the slightest sound, however they did
it, I would have ﬁgured the reason was
to take me by surprise. So why would
they knock?
There was only one thing to do.
I
rested a hand near the hilt of my sword,
tried to remember if I’d made my last
good-luck payment to Phlinn Arol, the
Adventurer’s God, and said, "Come in."
When he walked in I knew all bets
were off. Too late, I remembered that
my coverage with Phlinn Arol had
lapsed a week ago. Typical, I thought.
The guy in the door was the man from
the Skargool case, the one from the
insurance company.
The one I’d ﬁgured was probably a

god. "Hello," I said carefully. "Have a
seat."
"Thank you," he said.
He rested
his walking stick next to the door, re-
moved his brown-and-gray tweed cape
and draped it over the back of the
chair, ﬂicked his gaze quickly over the
seat, apparently decided the brown
splotches were defects in the wood and
not the remains of a recent spill, and
lowered himself deliberately onto the
chair, his hands grasping the armrests.
His hair was combed over a bald spot
and he was a bit too stocky to bet on
in timed sprints, but his mouth was
pursed enough to make the whole face
look grim.
His eyes shifted around
in pale sockets, darting at the few
signiﬁcant features of the room - the
desk, the window, the bookcase with
its smattering of books and my two
large creeping plants, the dented Val-

tubian shield, me - and it occurred to
me that perhaps, just maybe, he was
worried about something.
I tried to
look patient, and to keep my mind as
far away from the ransom money as I
could, just in case stray thoughts were
what he was after.
His eyes settled on me again, then
slid away. "I ﬁnd myself in an unchar-
acteristic situation," he said.
"I need
your help.
Someone is trying to kill
me."
I tried to stop it, but I think my jaw
dropped anyway.
"You’re a god. How can someone be
trying to kill you?"
"Oh," he said in a ﬂat voice. "A god.
You noticed that bit with the wife and
the balls of ﬁre."
"Yeah.
It’s my job to notice little
things like that."
He was examining the shield again;

he really didn’t want to look in my di-
rection, did he. Of course, the shield
was worth the once-over.
Given the
ragged ﬂower-petal hole gashed through
the middle of it, you’d wonder how the
person holding it had survived. Actu-
ally, the person hadn’t.
Fortunately,
that person hadn’t been me. "You are
quite observant indeed,” said the guy
in the chair. “Powers of observation are
valuable. These powers are one reason
I have chosen you to assist me."
I wished I had gone blind while I’d
had the chance; that way I would have
stopped noticing unhealthy things, like
the fact that he was a god. The damage
would have been a lot better in the long
run than what he had to have in mind
for me. As long as I was at it, I wished
I’d lost my tongue too, to keep me from
making any more dumb remarks such
as actually telling him what I’d seen.

But if I couldn’t see new problems to
get myself into and couldn’t open my
mouth to make them worse, I wouldn’t
be myself, then, would I? "You really
are a god?" I said. "You’re not going to
try to deny it?"
"What would be the goal? Would you
treat me differently if you thought me
a mere sorcerer?”
"Yeah, I would. I’ve got a lot of ex-
perience dealing with people.
I feel
comfortable around them, even when
they’re trying to kill me."
"All the more reason, then," he said.
"There is no reason for you to feel com-
fortable around me. We are not peers.
You will work for me in this case, but I
am not your client. I am your master."
Fear or no fear, imminent painful
death or not, those were ﬁghting words,
whoever he was. "You got some kind
of nerve,"" I said.
“I work for who I

choose, when I choose.
I’ll take your
little problem if I want to, after you’ve
told me about it, but you can’t just
come in here and take over my life. I
may let you hire me, but you’re not
going to own me. I gave up the whole
vassal number years ago."
"I am not bargaining with you. This
is a matter of some urgency.
I have
been cut off from my primary power
source."
"Magic - that’s another thing. I hate
magic.
I hate cases that hinge on
magic.
I hate the idea of magic.
In
fact, I think I’m starting to hate you,
too. I don’t think your case is going to
interest me at all. Now why don’t you
pick up your cape and your cane and
go out the same way you came in?"
He seemed to be enjoying the situa-
tion too much, like a boy with a small
insect and a growing collection of tiny

legs, and that should have warned me.
"I thought perhaps you might take that
attitude," he said. “That’s why I took
certain precautions."
". . . What precautions?"
"Your metabolism. I’ve linked it to
mine."
"What are you talking about?"
"I’ll show you. Hit me. Go ahead."
I had been thinking about doing just
that for some time. I was sure it was
a bad idea, but that had never stopped
me before.
My left took him under
the jaw. I felt it in the usual place, in
my ﬁst, but that wasn’t all. A sharp
pounding pain ﬂashed out of my own
chin and up into my head.
He got to his feet while I was still
resting on the ﬂoor, looking out of
crossed eyes.
"Metabolism," he said.
"Linked. Anything that affects me af-
fects you. If I run out of power you will

most probably die."
I wondered how I was getting my-
self into this. Maybe he’d been doing
something to me that screwed up my
better judgment.
My head was cer-
tainly screwed up, and it was only
seven o’clock in the morning. On the
other hand, it looked like my left had
as much punch as I’d always given
it credit for.
I reached for a random
thought. "This power stuff," I said. "I
thought you guys had so much power
you could do anything.
Why do you
need me?"
"Why do you have so many ques-
tions? Just follow my orders. That is
the only valid choice for you."
I squinted up at the two of him and
took a deep breath.
"Like I said, I hate magic.
I’ve al-
ways hated magic. This situation isn’t
likely to make me reconsider, but your

little show-and-tell makes it looks like
I’m stuck with it. I may be tough but
I’m not an idiot. I can tell when I’ve
been outplayed. I think surviving the
experience is good for a ﬁrst goal, and
I’ll go back to hating it later. If I’m go-
ing to get out of this, I’m going to have
to do what you want, and do it right.
I’m a professional. I assume that’s why
you’re here. If I’ll going to do a profes-
sional job, I’m going to have to know
what’s going on."
He sat down in my chair behind
my desk, reached into my drawer and
pulled out my ﬂask. "It has been a long
time since anyone like you treated me
like this," he said, pouring a long shot
down his throat. He smacked his lips,
and maybe I felt some of it too, deep
down in my chest.
"One side of me
wants to dismantle you organ by or-
gan and joint by joint, and have oxen

run wild over the remains." Something
crackled between his hands, and it
wasn’t the ﬂask. I set my jaw as well
as I could from my recumbent position
on the ﬂoor and tried to look as tough
as I’d been talking, not an easy concept
when you do happen to be lying on the
ﬂoor.
"But I will not do that," he said after
a minute.
"I will not do that because you hap-
pen to be right. If I could do your job I
would be doing it myself, but I cannot,
so I need your expertise. I will caution
you, though. I do know my job. Do not
go too far, or I will show you some of its
ﬁner points."
He stared at me. The feel of some-
thing large and terrible loomed at my
back, waiting to tear me apart, and
that would just be the appetizer.
I
made myself not swallow and stared

back at him. "Right," I said. "So I’ve
got those questions."
He took another swig from the ﬂask.
"Very well."
I hoisted myself gingerly off the ﬂoor
and into the visitors’ chair. "Let’s start
with who’s trying to kill you."
He looked at me as though he might
be reconsidering whether I was the
one he needed or not. "If I knew that I
would eradicate them."
"Yeah, right. Then how about, what
kind of attempts have they been mak-
ing on your, uh, life?"
"There has been no direct attempt to
discorporate me, no."
"Okay," I said. "So how do you know
somebody’s trying to kill you?"
"When I tried to leave the city ear-
lier this morning, I discovered a barrier
surrounding it."
Okay, so we were ﬁnally getting

somewhere.
Unless he was one of
those mad nutjob gods and the whole
thing was in his own head.
"Tell me
about this barrier."
He paused and looked disparagingly
at me. "The explanation is highly tech-
nical."
"Try me, I can take it."
He was right, the explanation was
technical.
What he didn’t know, and
what I didn’t want to mention, was
that over the years I’d picked up a fair
amount of magic theory, purely out
of self-defense.
Just because I didn’t
like magic didn’t mean I couldn’t know
something about it. I’d been up against
magicians before, and it was always a
good idea to have some grasp on their
capabilities, and whether they could re-
ally carry out the threats they always
seemed to enjoy making. So when he
started off by saying it was a type of

coupling problem, and looked at me to
see if I had the slightest idea of what
he was talking about, I could raise an
eyebrow and nod back with some level
of conﬁdence.
Coupling was always a big subject
on the mind of a magician, like car-
avan drivers crossing the desert and
their obsession with the location of the
next watering hole. Magic took a lot of
power, and most of it came out of the
magician’s hide, out of their own life
energy, or aura, or whatever they were
calling it this year. This drain was usu-
ally through a loss of body mass, but
not always. Part of being a magician
was learning not only to produce spells,
but how to cope with the aftermath.
Well, ﬁne, walking takes energy too.
The problem with magic was the quan-
tity involved. Major-league conjuring -
something like a duel, say - could take

off ﬁfty pounds of weight in a matter
of minutes and leave you incapacitated
for weeks, and that was if you won. You
could create a spell ahead of time and
store it, but that was only good when
you knew in advance what you were go-
ing to need. Setting up the spell would
still incapacitate you, but at least you
were in a position where you could rest
up afterward; that was some help, but
not really enough.
That’s why magi-
cians were always looking for ways to
store up power in other forms, and new
ways to get the power in the ﬁrst place.
That’s where coupling came in. Most
things in the world were potential
power sources. Living things were best,
but theoretically you could use rocks,
wind, water, just about anything. The
amount of energy a thing had avail-
able was supposed to be related to the
amount of order that had gone into

making it and keeping it running, at
least that’s what the texts said. Unfor-
tunately there was a technical hitch.
There was all this potential energy out
there, but nobody could really get at it.
To get energy out of a rock, say, you
had to couple your own energy ﬁeld to
the rock, do something to the rock that
would release its energy, and siphon
the energy into your own ﬁeld or di-
rectly into your spell.
In practice it
turned out the efﬁciency of transfer
was low. Real low. Draining your ob-
ject all the way down to a husk might
give you one percent of the energy you
could calculate was there. Maybe one
percent, if you were lucky and really
knew what you were doing.
There
were all kinds of tricks and wrinkles,
and different classes of objects give
different types of energy, so magicians
tend to specialize in order to at least

learn one set of techniques really well.
Necromancers, for example, got their
energy from the dead; along the way
they learned how to ﬁddle with the
dead in other ways, too - it wasn’t all
a question of energy. The bottom line,
though, was that there was all this en-
ergy sitting around and nobody could
ﬁgure out to make it work for them.
That much was common knowledge
in magical circles.
What I hadn’t
known, and what I doubted anybody
who wasn’t a god really comprehended,
was that the gods had coupling prob-
lems too.
Gods don’t like to discuss
economics, it takes away from their
image. According to this one, though,
keeping up a god’s basic life-style took
a lot of power. That’s why gods tried
to diversify, storing up energy from as
many different sources as they could,
but they ran into efﬁciency tradeoffs

the same as people.
For some rea-
son the rules didn’t work quite the
same for gods - he said their efﬁciency
curves were different, and they could
tap other sources that weren’t open
to regular mortals, like energy from
prayers - but that didn’t get around
the fact that the rules still laid down
the law.
There was another related problem.
Magicians wanted to store up as much
power as they could, of course, but it
turned out there the possible power
you could store was limited, too.
A
single person or aura could only ab-
sorb a certain amount of energy at
any one time – a person, an aura,
or a god. Gods could hold more, a lot
more in fact, but they normally chewed
through it at a higher rate too. What
they could do, though, was store the
excess, ending up with a network of

power reservoirs they could couple into
and recharge from, even at a distance,
like a high-altitude reservoir of water
when you needed a drink, or a bank
when you needed cash.
Also like banks, these energy stores
could be robbed. A lot of a god’s time
went into hiding, guarding, or booby-
trapping his reservoirs, and especially
trying to keep anyone else from ﬁnding
out their locations in the ﬁrst place.
"So let me see if I’ve got this straight,"
I
said,
interrupting
his
exposition.
"You’re in Roosing Oolvaya running
an errand, away from your power re-
serves. When you try to leave you run
into this barrier. Not only does it keep
you from getting out of the city, but if
you couple through it you reveal the lo-
cation of the reservoir you’re coupling
into."
He eyed me thoughtfully. "Yes," he

said.
"Is this barrier thing some standard
ploy, then?"
"I have seen barriers used before.
This barrier is not typical.
It seems
optimized for neutralization of surveil-
lance, and for quarantine."
"You mean keeping magic users out
of the city, and not letting any of them
look in?"
"Essentially."
"So why do you think this barrier
person is after you?"
"This is not a very big city. Who else
would they be after?"
This guy might have big power, but
he also had an ego to match.
Roos-
ing Oolvaya wasn’t the largest city
on the continent, but it still had its
share of stories; who knew what else
was going on out there today? He also
had a certain weakness in logical ar-

guments.
"Maybe they don’t realize
you’re here," I said. "Maybe they don’t
know the ﬁeld has this effect on you.
It sounds like this barrier’s aimed at
mortals, regular magicians. Not gods
at all. You could be caught up as a side
effect."
He was silent for a moment. "That
could explain a certain detail. This bar-
rier appears to be a ﬁrst-level ﬁeld."
"First level?" I’d never heard that
term before.
"Human magicians operate on the
ﬁrst quantum level.
A god generally
does not."
"Whatever you say.
So maybe it’s
just some mortal slob out there who’s
put up this barrier for reasons of his
own, and accidentally trapped you."
"That . . . is possible."
"So maybe you could just blast this
ﬁeld and crush this guy and take off."

He glanced at me. I thought I was
starting to get better at picking up his
moods, and this time I thought he was
actually a bit amused. "A good try," he
said. "I have not tested the barrier yet,
merely examined it. I wish to know ex-
actly what I face before committing my-
self. I could potentially do what you are
suggesting, but perhaps not. The drain
would surely prove considerable."
"Even if you wait, you still said you
were running out of power pretty fast."
"That is true. That is why you had
best plan on working quickly."
To hell with public-spirited high
mindedness.
I was in a jam, and I
came ﬁrst.
"If you need to recharge
in the meantime, why don’t you just
sacriﬁce a few dozen people and chew
up their souls?"
"That, unfortunately, is not an op-
tion."

"Huh?” I said. "I thought all gods -"
"You thought wrongly," he said, a lit-
tle testily (I thought) this time. "Such
energy would be tainted, would desta-
bilize my matrix structure." He looked
at my desk plant, which wasn’t do-
ing too well itself, but seemed to ﬁnd
enough inspiration from it to proceed.
"I am not a Death."
Suddenly, I was not only out of my
depth, I was overboard in the middle of
the ocean with a small rock quarry tied
to my leg. "Uh," I said, "who are you?
What are you?"
His head turned slowly to face me,
and his eyes gazed sharply through
mine. "You may not know what I am.
As for who I am . . .
you may call me
Gashanatantra."
What the heck, I would see how far
I’d come.
"Okay, sure.
That’s a ﬁne
name unless I need to call you in a

hurry.
Since you say this mess is so
urgent, I’d rather call you something
I don’t have to ﬁgure out how to pro-
nounce every time I try to say it. How
about Gash?"
"Gash.
Indeed." He paused again,
and I prepared to die. Then, instead,
he took another swallow from my ﬂask,
and said, "Very well. Are you prepared
to begin now?"
"Yeah, I think so. Where can I get in
touch with you?"
"I will be available when appropri-
ate."
"You said something like that once
before."
"As with the insurance investigation,
I wish my role to remain as minimal as
possible."
"You mean I’m bait.
You want to
wave me around and have this barrier-
maker shoot at me."

He smiled.
"You may view it that
way," he said, “if you choose.”
"That’s ﬁne," I said. "I understand
the situation, and that’s my job. There’s
just one thing you might want to re-
member. You might want to remember
that it’ll be more difﬁcult for me to do
what you need me to do if I’m dead.
That means it’s also in your own inter-
est that I don’t get that way."
"Few mortals are irreplaceable.
I
have selected you so that you can ac-
complish this on your own, by your-
self." He paused, his eyes momentarily
wandering over to look at the other
shield, the one from Mangotchka hang-
ing over the desk. This one a different,
neater hole punched straight through
the middle where a javelin had once
gone through it. The javelin was still
embedded behind it in the wall.
"Do
you think you can handle it?"

Every client I’d ever had ended
up asking that, sooner or later.
I
hadn’t answered honestly yet; I usu-
ally needed the business.
"I’m not
dumb enough to say no, but I’m not
dumb enough to say yes. You’re a big-
time player. So is whoever’s out there,
even if he isn’t a god.
He’s probably
going to be a nasty nut to crack. That
may need the kind of ﬁrepower that
you’ve got and I don’t. That means if I
get in trouble that’s too deep for me on
my own I’m going to have to count on
you to back me up."
He didn’t say anything, he just eyed
me again and then got up and left.
I had the nasty feeling I might ﬁnd
out how expendable I really was. One
thing that he carefully hadn’t said,
though,
and that I hadn’t wanted
him to know I’d thought of, was this
metabolic linkage bit. I’d die if he died,

he had said, but maybe it would work
the other way too. It was just possible
that he’d have to bail me out, for the
sake of his own skin, or else cut me
loose. I wasn’t planning to die, but I
was planning to get out of this thing
without him running the rest of my
life. It would be trickier than anything
I’d done before, but for some reason
I thought I might actually be able to
pull it off. Don’t ask me why I was so
optimistic. There hadn’t been much in
my morning so far to justify a sanguine
view of the prospects.
And of course, things were about to
get worse.
Like I said before, I hate magic. It
makes me nervous.
I’m sure that kind of feeling was an
old story. Back thousands of years ago,
when technology ruled the world, I’m

sure some people hated that too. When
the gods moved in and shut technology
down, the big thing that changed was
the emphasis. These days technology
had acquired a mystique among the
few people who knew it had ever ex-
isted, a nostalgia that I shared. Nostal-
gia was all it would ever be. Every time
some new mechanical genius showed
up, trying to roll out a new innovation
or reintroduce an old one he’d dug out
of a ruin, the gods would squash him.
They kept an eye out for things like
that, and they didn’t miss much.
More to the point, though, just be-
cause I didn’t like the idea of magic
didn’t mean I couldn’t know something
about it, or know some of the people
who knew how it worked. In my busi-
ness, every friend is a blessing, and ev-
ery contact an asset. When I’d pulled
myself together, then, having decided

not to actually ﬁnish off the ﬂask at
that time, I headed off to see a guy.
This person certainly wasn’t a blessing,
but in the past he had been an asset,
and in my present jam I hoped I could
convince him to be one again.
Carl Lake took one look at me, after
his manservant had ushered me into
his comfortable second-ﬂoor solarium
atop the silversmith’s shop on the fash-
ionable Street of Fresh Breeze, and
said, "What happened to you?"
I seated myself in his down-stuffed
armchair in the shade of a tropical
young-palm.
Gash hadn’t told me I
shouldn’t tell anybody else the real
situation, but I ﬁgured I’d better be
discrete. "l got a client," I said.
He pushed aside some scrolls on his
desk, the polished surface gleaming
with rare hardwoods, and leaned over
it to peer more closely at me. "You have

also picked up a curse." He scrutinized
the air around me.
"I’ve never seen
one quite like this - beautiful work,
beautiful work.
Unregistered, hmm,
yes."
"Unregistered?" I said.
"What the
hell does that mean? And what’s this
about a curse?"
"Surely you know of the curse reg-
istry?" he said, steepling his ﬁngers.
"Curses are often registered with an
agency of the gods.
Like insurance,
hmm?
A god is contracted to admin-
ister the application of the curse. Su-
pervision by a god, a very valuable
function, yes, but quite expensive."
He clucked to himself and rubbed his
eyebrows.
His eyebrows, possibly be-
cause of the attention, stuck wildly up
and down like ragged bottlebrushes.
"The curse is woven in your aura, like
this -" His hand made swooshing dart-

ing movements around his own body.
"What are the details, what is its pur-
pose - without a full study I cannot
tell." He spread his arms, hands open
and palms up.
Well, I guess I could have told him
the story, how this curse was probably
how Gash had linked my fate to his,
but I didn’t.
I’d met Carl after he’d
gone on a picnic a short way up the
river.
Three thugs had thrown him
off a rock ledge and left him for dead,
and had stolen the scrolls he’d taken
along to read in the sun. I’d tracked
down the goons and recovered his stuff.
Carl would never walk right again,
since the ledge had been fairly high
up, but he still had his solarium and
a good basic stay-at-home fee-for-spell
magical consulting business, so he was
doing all right. Sometimes he let him-
self feel some obligation to me.
He’d

also invested more attention in learn-
ing more reliable self-protection magic.
"Well," I said, "so I’ve got a curse, what
else is new?
I guess I’ll just have to
live with it. What’s going on in town?"
"Aside from the martial law and the
curfew and the troops, yes, anything
going on you say?"
"Aside from them, yeah. Any strange
new magic around?"
"You," Carl said, "I know.
You are
testing me. You have some particular
thing in mind you are really asking me.
Yes, hmm?"
"You think?"
"Something magical, then.
Hmm."
He rang for tea, and I remembered
what time it really was, still barely the
hour for a civilized breakfast. Carl was
still in his dressing gown, but of course
magicians had their own reputation to
keep up, conjurations past midnight

and all that. The tea was hot and its
taste alive with the tingle of exotic
spices, one of the beneﬁts of living in
a major commercial port. "Good tea," I
said.
"Yes, thank you. You are not inter-
ested in simple gossip, but then these
are not simple times, hmm?
As you
know, I am not often political, but per-
haps you have come for speculation on
political trends?"
I decided to stop playing games;
maybe then he’d stop too. "Look, Carl,"
I said, "maybe it’s political and maybe
it’s not.
I wouldn’t be surprised if
it was.
I’ve heard that somebody’s
put a barrier around the city, and I
don’t mean a line of troops. A barrier
for quarantine, and neutralization of
surveillance."
"Hm," he said.
"That is news.
A
barrier of sorcery, that is news indeed.

How do you know of this thing?"
"I get around."
"Indeed. Yes, well, a question costs
nothing." He raked his eyebrows.
"A
barrier.
I must examine this for my-
self."
"The big question is ’who’."
"Oh, my, indeed yes. Who indeed? A
good barrier takes much power, much
skill. This is a good barrier?"
"The way I hear it, yeah. Real good."
He
stood
and
hobbled
furiously
around the room, rubbing one hand
across his eyebrows and using the
other for support.
"Political, it must
be political. It must be connected with
. . . "
"You’re the best magician in town,
aren’t you? Could you have done it?"
"Me?" He looked at me for a second,
caught between ego and the needs of
honesty. "No, not I, certainly not. Such

a barrier requires too much power. Not
my specialty either. And myself as the
most powerful in Roosing Oolvaya? At
times, perhaps.
Currently, perhaps
not." He stopped suddenly, staring out
the milky surface of the river-beast
bladder
that
covered
the
solarium
dome.
"Such a barrier is employed
by a sorcerer against other sorcerers.
It is a sign that says, ’Beware! Enter
this area at your own risk! Secret work
in progress!’"
"To me, that sounds like more of an
invitation for anybody who’s curious to
come take a look."
"You do not understand. This is a se-
rious affair. Such a barrier is usually
a preliminary when one expects an at-
tack. Or a duel. It says, ’Bystanders -
fall back or perish!’"
I was starting to get the idea. "1f it
isn’t yours, whose is it? I know the lo-

cal talent, and I’d say if you couldn’t do
it, none of them could either."
"It could be Rounga, perhaps, but
that is most unlikely.
I must make
inquiries, gather the adepts of the city.
We will meet.
Perhaps we may need
to take joint action. This is a serious
situation."
I went to the door. "Let me know. I’d
better be there."
"Certainly."
The door was large and brass and
highly polished. I began to push it open
and then said, "What about strangers?
Is there anybody new in town?" In the
reﬂection of his image in the door I
thought I saw him stiffen, just barely.
"If so, we must ﬁnd this out," Carl
said.
I STRODE OFF DOWN FRESH
BREEZE, turned a corner, and then
took an alley quickly back through the

center of the block. I was just in time
to see Carl Lake, fully dressed now
and leaning on a cane made from the
large straight tusk of a moose-slasher
wolf, hobble out of the door of his home
and set out for the north. The manser-
vant had appeared right behind him.
Locking the door, he hurried off in
the opposite direction. I made a quick
decision and slid after Carl.
Carl stopped every minute or two
to look around, but there were plenty
of doorways and stalls for me to edge
into out of his line of sight.
For a
guy with a permanent limp, he was
acting remarkably agile.
Given the
usual crowds in the narrow streets,
each person bustling back and forth
with their purchases, haggling with
the open-air merchants, and generally
following their own errands and mis-
sions, and with the need to stay back so

he couldn’t actually see me each time
he abruptly turned, it was all I could
do to keep him in sight. I thought I’d
lost him twice in the ﬁrst ten minutes.
Those times I had no excuse; tailing
was supposed to be part of my exper-
tise.
When I really did lose him, of
course, there were other more urgent
things going on.
It wasn’t more than ﬁfteen minutes
since Carl had left his house.
We
hadn’t come that far, especially for the
trouble I’d been having. I was follow-
ing him north on Mosk Field, where
it straightens out for a quarter-mile
and gets wide enough for two carts
to pass at the same time. One of the
Guard outﬁts that had become ubiqui-
tous after the coup, a squad of about
ten guys, was working their way south
toward us.
Carl gave them a glance
and then moved around to pass on the

right.
A solid stone wall about twice
my height ran down that side of the
block, several sharp-eyed beggars re-
clining in the gutter at its foot, and
Carl was forced to edge right up to it,
his shoulder on the rock and his tusk-
cane forcing the beggars to scuttle out
of the way. I waited a few seconds and
headed after him.
The street and the gutter were sur-
faced with uneven ﬂagstones, but the
gutter was also covered on top of the
stones by the standard sheath of trash
and mud. Carl had moved the beggars
back, at least, but I still needed to keep
an eye on my footing and one on Carl
at the same time. Just at the second,
the footing was ﬁrst in my mind - I
always hate to slip in the goop.
The
approaching Guard squad forced me
up a bit closer to the wall, my foot hit
a slick spot and began to slide, and so

I raised my right hand to steady my-
self against the wall. I’m right-handed,
and that’s the hand I favor for my
sword; I use a cross-body draw with
the sword slung on my left hip. Just at
that second a trooper from the Guard
squad moved against the wall in front
of me with his sword out and pointing
in my direction.
Simultaneously, an-
other man had done the same thing
right behind me, and still others had
ﬁlled the space between the ﬁrst two,
all of their swords out as well, and
the swords of their backups behind
them. It had to be luck, and certainly
not my own, that precisely when this
happened my sword hand was splayed
out on the surface of the tall rock wall
with the rest of me leaning against it,
several feet and a shift of body weight
away from actually getting my own
sword free and available for use.

Points poked my back and another
one poked my side. A hand reached in,
pulled my sword out from my belt, and
withdrew. By the time one of them said,
"You’re under arrest. Violation of cur-
few. Contempt for martial law," it was
almost anti-climactic.
"That was one of the slickest moves
I’ve seen in a long time," I said.
"Shut up," said the corporal.
The whole thing had taken about
six seconds. Up ahead, Carl Lake was
still disappearing around the next cor-
ner.
Just as he did, I thought I saw
something impossible. I put it down to
overwork. Unfortunately, the enforced
vacation I now had coming up was not
the sort that promised much chance of
rest and relaxation. I was headed for
the dungeons.

Chapter7
SHAA CONVERSES
THE AFTERNOON WAS CREEP-
ING
ONWARD.
Roosing
Oolvaya
would shortly begin to come alive with
the pad of mufﬂed footfalls, the slink
of stealthy passages, and the whisper
of watchwords.
Knives would ﬂash
and men would fall, while decent folk
would stay indoors. Overall, it would
be a typical night.

Actually, though, it probably wouldn’t
at least if Zalzyn Shaa had anything
to say about it, and it looked increas-
ingly as though he would.
Shaa con-
sidered himself a decent person (as,
he had discovered, most persons felt
about themselves) but nonetheless he
would be out in the streets. That is, he
would start by being out in the streets.
Shaa collapsed his spyglass, stowed
it away under his cloak, and turned
back to Jurtan Mont. Mont was barely
visible to him, in the thick shadow
behind a dark chimney, but would be
totally concealed from anyone on the
ground or even on the surrounding
rooftops, which were lower.
"Let me
get this straight,” Shaa said.
"Four
days ago the Venerance clutches his
throat and dies. This twerp Kaar pro-
claims himself Venerance,
locks up
his father’s government as a precau-

tionary move, and starts rounding up
everybody who’s ever looked at him
wrong under the cover of martial law.
That’s the outline. Not,” he added in
an aside apparently aimed at no one
in particular, “that it is remarkably
unique."
Mont shifted irritably and said, "So
it’s not unique.
Who cares if it’s not
unique? It doesn’t have to be unique
to be bad."
"Well put," Shaa said.
"There are
few situations these days that are
truly unique, if indeed there ever were.
What gives any situation its individ-
ual character are the personalities
involved and the nature of one’s own
personal stake.
Thus it is that we
come to the matter at hand, in which
the major issue is your personal stake.
Yes?"
"I guess so. It’s gotta be my stake,

I’m the only one left. They’re my fam-
ily.
I can’t just let them rot." Jurtan
mumbled something else beneath his
breath.
"What was that?” Shaa said.
“I’m
afraid I didn’t catch that last bit.”
Mont’s voice wasn’t much louder the
second time. "... I said I wish I was
more of the rescuing type."
“Is there a rescuing type?” Shaa
mused. "You may not be that type, yet,
whatever it is, but you do have the
makings of another, more useful type."
"What’s that?"
"The intelligent type. Which is to say
that you’re apparently smart enough to
know when to get help."
"Yeah, but, I don’t know. I feel like
I should have been doing it myself, in-
stead of going out and -”
"There’s nothing dishonorable about
bringing in a consultant," Shaa said.

"You tend to behave rationally, at least
some of the time, and you made the
rational decision. Shall we go on?"
Mont looked at Shaa, stared at him
for a moment, then looked away. His
head bobbed once in a uncertain nod.
Yet a nod it had been. "Your father,
you said, was one of the ﬁrst to be
picked up, along with the rest of Kaar’s
immediate family and other potential
claimants to this middle-weight throne,
the members of the Cabinet, and sim-
ilar assorted threats.
Your father is
a grain merchant who’s doing rather
well for himself; sufﬁce it to say that
is not the reason he’s in the dungeon.
The reason he’s in the clink is that he
was a military advisor to the former
Venerance."
"That’s not exactly what I said."
"The sort of advisor who specializes
in pulling one out of nasty scrapes,

hmm?" Shaa said. "By the strength of
his own sword, if need be? That kind of
relationship with someone like an ex-
Venerance would certainly make him
dangerous now. On the other hand, if
Kaar could make your father go over
to him, that would be something of a
public relations coup, now wouldn’t it?"
"My father hates Kaar."
"Yes, but what about torture?"
Mont gave a small snort. "You don’t
know my father. He likes torture, says
it builds character."
"I suspected as much, but that’s not
quite what I had in mind. Not torture
of himself, no, but what about other
members of your immediate family?
Siblings, perhaps?"
". . . I’ve got a sister."
"Ah, how nice. Do you get along?"
"Well, yeah, I guess so."
"I too have a sister.
Unfortunately

our relationship has certain issues."
"Uh, I’m sorry to hear that."
"As am I. But the point most perti-
nent to your situation has been made;
that is,
there are others available
whose suffering could be used in princi-
ple to sway your father’s loyalty. Even,
one may venture to say, you could be
used as a pawn."
"My father might not mind seeing
me tortured. But anyway, they’d have
to catch me ﬁrst."
"Yes indeed," Shaa said, ﬁling the
predicate away for future exploration.
"Hence the scene this afternoon.
Or
was the Guard after you because you’d
stolen an apple?
So.
You’d like to
spring your family from the hoosegow
before the Guard gets you, too. That is
not an insigniﬁcant task."
"Are you saying you can’t do it?
I
thought you were just - "

"Keep your composure.
When I
say something seriously objectionable,
you’ll know.
The task is not insignif-
icant, true, but it doesn’t seem insur-
mountable either. These old dungeons
usually have some tricky way of get-
ting in."
Jurtan Mont looked down past their
dangling feet and the vast slab of the
warehouse
wall
toward
the
rolling
black surface of the River Oolvaan,
slapping the pilings under the wharf
far below. "I guess I’m going to have to
trust you," he said.
Eventually, Shaa said to himself, he
may stop saying that and actually start
to do it. After a moment for contempla-
tion, Shaa spoke. "Leaving aside your
own personal stake in the matter for a
moment, let us move on to the question
of the relevant personalities.
Speciﬁ-
cally, to the issue of Kaar himself.

"As you so aptly pointed out, the
whole city knows Kaar. That’s part of
the problem. He’s the kind of person
you’d spit at when you see pass in the
street, right before you run for your
life so he won’t slash you to death with
his whip.”
Mont spat over the side of the build-
ing. “Kaar’s a drunk, a gambler, a –“
“A most thoroughly reprehensible
creature indeed,” Shaa said,
“espe-
cially given that he now seems to be
in charge." Under other circumstances.
Shaa thought to himself, perhaps not
that bad of a fellow, except for what
sounded like a bit of a cruel streak.
Still - "Given the suspicious back-
ground, and the fact that Kaar would
be rather low on any candidate list of
rulers likely to prove competent, I sus-
pect there’s more to this than merely
Kaar himself."

"Yeah, I know what you mean," Mont
said. "There’s some things about all of
this that don’t make sense."
"So perhaps I will venture certain ed-
ucated guesses. If Kaar is the wonder-
ful spirit and all-around great guy you
describe, from where does his backing
originate? After all, he not only man-
aged to pull off the initial coup, he’s
also been able to make it stick, at least
so far. There’s more to that than just
locking people up.”
"What about all the extra Guard?
They must cost real money.”
"Ah," Shaa said, "yes indeed. That is
a point of great signiﬁcance. This vast
body of troops, marching as one indivis-
ible body to the tune of Kaar the Mag-
niﬁcent."
"Kaar the Magniﬁcent?
What are
you talking about now?"
"Only a small exaggeration at this

stage, a bit of advertising hyperbole,
but teapot tyrants have a tendency to
move into the grandiloquent regions
with remarkable alacrity. He’ll be call-
ing himself Magniﬁcent or Transcen-
dent or some such inside of a month, if
he’s still around."
"He’d better not be around.
I pray
the gods will not permit such a terrible
_"
Shaa raised an eyebrow and glow-
ered at Mont.
"The gods," he said,
"are another subject entirely.
Sufﬁce
it to say that the current crop of gods
does not deserve your prayers and are
unlikely to be of any present use what-
ever."
Mont dropped his jaw and looked
scandalized. "But - but if we pray hard
enough, maybe we could get a blessing,
maybe even get a god to help us."
"The gods are a mixed blessing at

best," Shaa said, "especially the little
ones who muck around with people. Al-
though they rather like creatures like
Kaar. Simple, pliable, vicious, not too
smart - Kaar couldn’t have been a bet-
ter tool if a god had designed him from
scratch. Indeed, the last thing we want
is some god noticing the situation and
deciding it could further their latest
plan. Please retract your prayer, and
hope the gods are busy at the moment.
That’s much safer all around.
Now,
about the Guard."
Mont closed his mouth but the ex-
pression of moral distress remained on
his face. "The Guard. Right. Yes?"
"Yes.
There are many more troops
around than one would expect for a city
of this size. They have not been raised
by levy, yet their faces are not familiar.
Correct?"
"I, uh, I don’t know.
I don’t spend

much time on the streets.
I didn’t
spend time on the streets," he corrected
quickly.
Shaa sent a sardonic smile out over
the river. “Right. The faces are not fa-
miliar; ergo Kaar has been importing
foreign help for some time. Now what
is suspicious about that?"
"... Are you asking me?"
"Certainly I’m asking you. I’m trying
to stimulate discussion, sharpen your
appreciation for the nuances. Think of
it as a form of education especially use-
ful in context - relatively painless but
highly relevant. Again, now, the suspi-
cious factor."
While Mont thought it over, Shaa
looked behind them, rechecking the
ﬂat roof.
The city was becoming a
sheaf
of
paper
cutouts
silhouetted
against the declining sun, their out-
lines starting to ﬂicker in the glow of

ﬁrelights.
"... How could Kaar know in advance
he’d need troops?" Mont said. "His fa-
ther dropped dead all of a sudden.
They said it was something natural, so
how could Kaar have planned for it?"
"Very good!" Shaa said. "That is in-
deed the point I was after. In a case
like this they always say it’s natural
causes, but it very rarely is. Whenever
you hear about someone dropping dead
under questionable circumstances that
just happen to mean large advan-
tage to someone else, certain things
should run through your mind. Natu-
ral causes will run through only long
enough to escape out the back. They
may creep again into consideration
when absolutely everything else has
been excluded, and even then they will
creep very tentatively."
"How can you be sure?"

"One can never be sure. The impor-
tant thing is to keep the various possi-
bilities in mind."
"Okay, I get it. So what’s next then,
murder?"
"Inevitably. The mediums of murder
are many, but they can be categorized.
There is murder by normal physical
means,
murder
by
straightforward
magic, and what one might call mur-
der by loophole."
"What’s that last one?”
"When I say murder by loophole, I
mean that some unusual illusion or
subterfuge is involved." Shaa rested
his elbows on his knees and leaned
forward. Far off on the water, beyond
the moored lines of boats gently rock-
ing on the swell, lights twinkled on
the hulking masses of the three major
islands.
The parapets of the palace
traced out their serrated edges against

the dusk of the evening sky. The walls
and island shore Shaa had examined
earlier with his spyglass were now
deeply in shadow.
"Suppose the Ven-
erance had actually expired sometime
previously.
It’s not impossible, you
know; his corpse could have been tem-
porarily reanimated while someone
waited for other preparations to come
due. Another possibility - suppose the
person who died wasn’t the Venerance
at all. It could have been a projection,
a wraith, a transmogriﬁcant -"
"A what?"
"Somebody else spiffed up to look
like him. Think of it as a really good
masquerade, yes?"
"Uh, yeah.
But then how can you
know who anybody really is? How do
you know anything you see is really the
truth? Who can you trust?"
"Those questions are at the core of

the unsettling implications of magic.
Magic is a tool like any other tool,
sword or hoe or ship or book, and as
such can be used for good or ill. Also
like most other tools, it complicates
life, making many people wish it had
never been invented. On a less philo-
sophical level, the questions you raise
are a major reason there are court ma-
gicians and professional aura readers.
Their prime purpose is to see through
appearances. For every untruth, there
usually is a way to expose the underly-
ing actuality.
“Anyway,”
Shaa
said,
stretching,
"practically speaking, these considera-
tion are rarely a problem. Magic may
be destabilizing, but it’s also expensive,
especially the fancy stuff."
Mont was sucking on his lip. "I think
I thought of something else.
What if
Kaar had somebody who could see the

future tell him when his father was go-
ing to die?"
“I believe you have begun to achieve
the proper perspective," Shaa said ap-
provingly. "It is time to advance to the
next topic."
"What’s that?"
One side of Shaa’s mouth curled up
and pulled the rest of his face into a
sardonic grin. “I thought you wanted
to act. You did give that impression."
"Sure I want to act.”
"Well, then, what is your plan?”
"I thought you were going to do the
plans.” Shaa raised an eyebrow. "Oh, I
get it, more education. Well, we have to
storm the dungeons, release the prison-
ers, and overthrow Kaar. That sort of
thing."
“That sort of thing,” Shaa said. “The
two of us.“
"You don’t have to sound so sarcas-

tic about it. You’ve got a better plan?
Then tell me about it."
Shaa displayed an ostentatious pout,
then let it slide deliberately into his
more usual lopsided grin. "You do not
ﬁnd me being sarcastic, or at least
no more than usual. Your basic plan
happens to be the one I had in mind
myself. It is, after all, a classic of its
kind and, anyway, an adventure is an
adventure."
Mont rolled his eyes. Out of all the
characters I could ﬁnd, he thought, the
one I come up with is a nut. Or maybe
just an actor. "You’re a pretty strange
guy, you know that?"
"I have been told so. Still, I am not
alone in strangeness."
Mont squinted across at Shaa. Shaa
was sinking into an air of impenetrabil-
ity. "You’re about to ask me something
I’m not going to like," Mont said. "I can

tell."
Shaa made a noise midway between
a snort and a growl. One of the things
he hated most was being predictable,
especially while he was doing his im-
penetrability shtick.
"Yes,” he said.
"That is true.
I need to know more
about your seizure disorder."
Mont looked away from Shaa, off
across the river.
“I don’t like to talk
about it."
"Nevertheless you must."
". . .
You don’t like to talk either.
Let’s trade. You ask me a question, I
ask you one. Why are you doing this
for me?"
Why indeed? Shaa thought. I don’t
have to put up with this, I only put up
with what I choose. He started to rise.
"On reﬂection, friend Mont, I recall
that you clearly fail to have the only
adventure in town."

"Stay where you are," Mont said.
The glint of metal appeared in his
hand, its abrupt edge glittering orange
in the last light of the sun.
Shaa stared at him.
"You do have
possibilities, as I have mentioned, but
you are still an idiot."
"What’s the matter with a few ques-
tions?" Mont said, waving the knife.
"It’s only fair. Okay, I need your help,
but you must want something out of
me too. I think I’d better know what it
is."
"This is ridiculous," Shaa said, and
this time there was no doubt about his
tone.
"At this rate a man will have
to get a license from the Chamber of
Commerce before you help an old lady
across the street.
Just what do you
expect to do with that ﬂy-slicer?"
"I’m going to get some answers."
Shaa sighed, then whistled a few

bars of a sprightly popular tune. Mont’s
form sagged.
The orange reﬂections
poured from his hand, went dark as
they vanished over the edge, glinted
once more as the knife entered the wa-
ter. Shaa seated himself again, leaned
back, and draped one leg over the other,
ending his tune with the ﬂourish of a
chirping bird.
After a moment Mont stirred. "That
was a dirty trick," he said.
"Thank you. Think of it as another
educational supplement." Shaa crossed
his hands behind his head, letting one
leg swing idly. "I submit that our re-
lationship thus far has not been opti-
mally genial. I propose we make a new
start, to preserve our mutual sanity."
"What kind of new start?" Mont said
warily.
I’ve really come down in life, Shaa
thought, to be reduced to bargaining

with a truculent kid.
"Since your cu-
riosity seems to be the primary stick-
ing point, I will answer your questions.
Up to a point."
"You will? Really?”
"Yes, really.
I did say so.
You, in
return, will try to keep in mind that
it’s your city and your family in danger,
not mine, that I am offering essentially
for free a level of expert advice and
assistance that you would have trouble
ﬁnding at any price on the open mar-
ket, and that ﬁnally I might actually
have some idea of what I’m talking
about and some reason for the things
I do. You will also do what I say and
argue later. Agreed?"
"Yeah, okay.
I agree.
But I’ll be
watching you - you’d better help me
good!"
“I have every intention," Shaa said
dryly, "hence this whole drawn-out ex-

ercise. As a token of my intent, in fact,
you may even ask the ﬁrst question.
Try a simple one for a start.”
Mont was taken aback, but not ren-
dered speechless.
“Okay,” he said,
"that’s easy. You carry a sword. Can
you handle it?"
“Although such actions speak louder
than words, in a word, yes. I once took
a comprehensive advanced course with
one of the better blade-persons it has
been my fortune to encounter."
"Who’s that?"
"Maximillian," Shaa said, "the Vaguel
Disreputable."
"I’ve never heard of him."
"He doesn’t generally go in for the
popular press."
Shaa paused. Mont had spoken with
some authority, as though he had ex-
pected to recognize the name. "Do you
try to stay abreast of the major sword-

swinging talent out of basic principles,
or do you have aspirations along those
lines yourself?”
Mont looked away. "It’s not me, it’s
my father. He has these guys over to
the house all the time and I hear who
they talk about, so I know lots of the
big names." He sighed, his shoulders
drooping. "My father was the Lion of
the Oolvaan Plain. I guess he thinks
I’m a disgrace to him. I don’t want to
be a ﬁghter, not really, but he thinks
it’s the only acceptable thing to do."
Ah, Shaa thought, you want to res-
cue your father and thus prove your
worth; an honorable motive indeed. If
potentially transient in effect, given
what he’s already heard about the se-
nior Mont. "Indeed," Shaa said aloud.
"I daresay your father’s opinion of you
may never be the same again following
this experience."

Mont shifted nervously, perhaps a
bit ﬂustered.
He cleared his throat.
"Uh, I, uh - why do you talk like that
all the time?" he blurted.
Shaa had the feeling that what had
just emerged from his mouth was not
quite what Mont had really started to
say. Still, whatever it was supposed to
have been would no doubt come out in
due course.
"The tendency toward a
somewhat baroque sentence structure
runs in my family. And now, if you’re
quite ﬁnished with your ﬁrst question,
on – I might add – the installment plan,
it would seem to be my turn. Your at-
tacks are related to music, yes?"
Shaa
watched
Mont
mull,
then
looked back at the deepening violet
of the sky. All it needs is a little of that
pink phosphorescent rain, he thought,
like they have around that swamp -
what was that place called? I should

ﬁnd a way to export that rain; it cer-
tainly had character.
". . .
My problem’s not just music,
it’s anything rhythmic, really," Mont
said. "Cart wheels going over a bridge,
horses trotting,
that kind of thing.
Those are the easy ones; I can usually
ﬁght them off by concentrating hard,
but my thinking gets sort of fuzzy and
sometimes I can’t see.
Music is the
worst. Anything that has a beat. If the
music’s out of tune I can maybe concen-
trate around it, too, only most of the
time it’s no use. Any music with a reg-
ular part makes me go . . . it’s like my
mind starts pounding along with it and
pushes away everything else. The next
thing I know I’m lying on the ground
somewhere." Jurtan paused, cutting
off the rush of words. Though his head
was turned, Shaa had the feeling he
was setting his jaw and gritting his

teeth. "You, ah, you don’t think I’m a -
a freak, do you?"
"Certainly not. Your ailment may be
unusual but I wouldn’t put categorize
it as freakish. Could be a curse, but I
doubt that. My snap diagnosis would
be some interesting oddity in your or-
ganic nervous system.
None of your
fault, obviously, but a signiﬁcant hand-
icap nonetheless. Hmm... I must think.
It is not impossible that there may be
something that can be done."
"You, ah, you know I’ve been to lots
of doctors."
"The revelation fails to shock."
"None of them did anything that
helped. They kept bleeding me, or wav-
ing their arms around and giving me
horrible things to drink. None of them
would ever talk so I could understand,
either.”
"Yes, well, the state of the medical

profession is not what it should be,"
Shaa said superciliously.
"Are you sure you’re really a doctor?
I mean, you’re not like any of the other
ones."
"Few of the other ones are like me.
Sadly, the scientiﬁc method is not cur-
rently in repute."
"The what?"
"Just my point.” Shaa had still been
thinking while he talked, and the most
singular symptom was intriguing him
more and more. "Music, you say."
"Music," Mont groaned. "Yeah, mu-
sic.
Sometimes it feels like my life’s
run by music.
I - oh, I don’t care if
you think I’m crazy, but I guess I’d bet-
ter tell you this too. The, uh, seizures
aren’t all. I, uh, I hear music all the
time."
"Please elaborate." Shaa, his ﬁngers
interlaced on his chest, his eyes closed,

was beaming beatiﬁcally up at the sky.
Finally, he thought, a decent diagnos-
tic challenge.
“This is quite fascinat-
ing," he added. "
Uh, thanks," said Mont. "Whatever
I do, there’s always a little bit of music
playing along in the back of my head.
It matches my mood, sort of matches
what I’m doing. Other times it matches
what’s going on around me, picks up
if there’s action or excitement or stuff
like that. All different kinds of sounds,
all kinds of instruments, every instru-
ment I’ve ever heard and lots more. Of
course, I can only hear an instrument -
for real, I mean, like when a live musi-
cian’s playing on the street - I only hear
it when it’s out of tune, or when it’s not
being played right, but I’ve still heard
enough to know what they sound like.
Trumpets, birds, thompers, you name
it, I hear it in my head."

“One’s own private orchestra," Shaa
murmured. "Swelling with the crescen-
dos of life.
Playing marches at wed-
dings, off-key polkas at wakes, soft
strings for candlelit dinners, the slink
of slide-horns for menace. That is quite
an afﬂiction, my friend. Have you your-
self tried to p1ay an instrument? Have
you tried to write this music down?"
“I’ve - I’ve never tried. I, uh, I didn’t
know what might happen."
Feedback?
Shaa wondered.
Reso-
nance effects? "We will see. There is
much in you to study. You are unique,
yes, but certainly not a freak." He
sighed. "Much as I would like to begin
the investigation now, though, there
are other pressing matters afoot. It is
time for the plan of action.”
“Just a second. You asked your big
question, I get to ask you mine."
Like
most
people,
Shaa
thought,

Mont is sharpest where his self-interest
is concerned.
"I try never to do busi-
ness with a sea-lawyer," he said, "but
I suppose sometimes it is a necessary
evil. Very well, ask away.”
"You know my question.
Why are
you helping me?"
“That one again? There’s a prophecy.
“
"What do you mean, a prophecy?
That’s no answer."
"That’s not much of a question."
Shaa’s eyes, if Mont could have seen
them, were not focusing on anything in
particular. "There is a prophecy that
I would meet the major love of my life
while on an adventure. I haven’t met
whomever it is yet, so I am forced to
continue to dredge up new escapades.
There are certain penalty clauses also
involved, making it unproductive for
me to swear off the idea of love and

merely retire to a mountaintop on a
permanent basis." These were not the
only other clauses, but Mont hopefully
didn’t know enough to ask and Shaa
certainly didn’t intend to volunteer
more than had already been squeezed
out.
"What about that curse you men-
tioned before?"
"This prophecy isn’t a curse?
It
doesn’t guarantee anything about the
condition I’ll be in at the time. It won’t
be too exciting to fall in love with some-
one right after I’ve been run through
with a pike."
"If you say so," Mont said, appar-
ently failing to detect Shaa’s evasion.
For a change, Shaa thought, friend
Mont has managed to do something
helpful.
"Well," Mont continued wist-
fully, "at least there’s a nice girl out
there waiting for you, whatever shape

you’re in."
"The
prophecy
unfortunately
ne-
glected to mention details of person-
ality. It also neglected to mention such
particulars as sex. Or, for that matter,
species."
"Uh . . . do you mean . . . "
"Who can say?" Shaa said gloomily.
"All I can hope is that the escape clause
will not be too offensive." He eyed Mont.
"I do tend to think twice before intro-
ducing myself to people."
Even in the gloom, Shaa could see
Mont turn white. Mont gulped. "Can’t
you ﬁght it? Maybe the prophecy could
be wrong."
"The
circumstances
of
its
origin
made things quite clear. Unfortunately.
Now, if you’re quite satisﬁed for the
moment . . . ?"
"Uh, yeah, I guess I am."
"Then we can get on with it," Shaa

said. "I have some skill with boats."
"Boats? But we don’t have a boat."
"Acquiring the boat is one of my
skills." Shaa rose to go.

Chapter8
SCIENTIFIC
INTERLUDE
“WELL, THAT’S ALL OF IT,” Max
said, wrenching closed the top ﬂap of
his knapsack and snapping the fas-
tener into place. "Now do I ﬁnally get
to see these marvelous research results
of Roni’s before I go out on your errand
and get my head chewed off?"

Karlini rubbed the back of one hand
absently across his eyes, making them
even redder.
"Max," he said, "I’m ex-
hausted. Let’s do it later."
"I’m leaving later."
"Oh, yeah.
Right." Karlini fought
back a yawn, then gave in and let it
envelope his face. "Where’s Roni?"
"Probably in the lab, where else?"
"But it’s late, she must have gone to
bed hours ago. "
"She did go to bed when it was late,
but it’s not late any more, it’s early."
Max pulled back a curtain. "See, sun."
Karlini yawned again.
"All right,
you torturer, all right. This way." Max
left his gear on the ﬂoor and followed
him through the door, down the hall,
and up a ﬂight of circular stairs. Kar-
lini removed a key on a large ring from
a hook on the wall and unlocked a door
at the top landing.
"Roni?" he said.

"Dear?"
The room was empty. "Must still be
asleep," Max said.
"Why don’t I just
poke around myself and let you go to
bed. I’m sure I can ﬁgure things out."
"I’m sure you can,” Karlini grunted.
"Most of it was your idea in the ﬁrst
place. Lock up when you’re ﬁnished."
He retreated back through the door
and clumped off down the stairs.
The room occupied almost the whole
top of one of the lower towers, the
walls admitting a blaze of early sun-
light through windows placed all the
way around. Roni and Karlini had set
up a substantial array of equipment.
Beakers, bottles, dishes, and ﬂasks
were stacked neatly against the walls,
enclosed in a variety of ﬁeld preserva-
tion spells.
Two stacks of books sat
next to the door. On top of the books
were a set of three matching ledgers

bound in hide and spotted with multi-
colored stains and spills.
A fourth
ledger-book was on the table in the cen-
ter of the room, open to a page in the
middle. To the left of the ledger was
a low wooden box with a latched cover
and thin tendrils of steam issuing from
its joints. In front of the box was the
microscope.
Max seated himself on the stool next
to the table and ran his hand fondly
over the ancient instrument. He care-
fully rotated the compound lens mount,
ran the viewing lens up and down, ad-
justed the reﬂecting light source mir-
ror, then rested his elbows on the table
and rested his chin on his hands.
Roni was keeping things up nicely.
The microscope had been the ﬁnest
thing he’d ever owned, and he’d come
close to dying over it more than once,
but a scope was made to be used and

Max was on the road too often to give it
the attention it deserved. It had made
quite a wedding present.
And now, if Roni was correct, it had
helped her make a remarkable discov-
ery.
Max, as was his nature, spent much
of his time thinking. One of the things
he liked to think about was magic and
the way it worked. After hearing from
Roni about her research into animal-
cules and her resulting theory of cells
as the building blocks for larger living
creatures, a year or two earlier, some-
thing had connected.
He had been
looking through the microscope at a
bulging whitish ball of sliding tendrils
and protruding blobs easing through
the thin ﬁlm of water.
"Where does
magic come from?" Max had said sud-
denly.
"I don’t know,” Roni said.
"Where

does it come from?"
"There," Max said, staring at the
amoeba.
"Somewhere in there." The
amoeba sidled over to a smaller spin-
ning oval, surrounded it, and sucked
it in. "That thing eats food and turns
it into energy.
We eat food and turn
it into energy, except we can also turn
it into magic." Max looked up at Roni.
“Somewhere in one of your cell things,
something turns that food into magi-
cal energy. You want a new research
topic? Find that interface. Figure out
that step."
Max lifted his head off of his hands
and drew the ledger-book toward him.
The book held Roni’s latest lab records.
Before ﬂipping back through the book,
Max’s attention was drawn to the most
recent entry by the heading "MAX:"
printed in large letters above it. It was
a short paragraph containing setup

instructions and the activation words
for the ﬁlter spell. Max read it again to
make sure he had things straight, then
unlatched the cover of the wooden box,
eased it open, and removed a round
glass dish with a ﬂat top. With a ﬁne-
blown pipette he found in a vase of
water, Max sucked up a small quantity
of liquid from the dish, transferred it
to the center of a slide, added a touch of
dye from a vial capped with a dropper,
and positioned the slide on the micro-
scope’s lower stage.
A thick stubby
candle, half burned-out, sat next to the
microscope in a holder with a curved,
highly polished back. Max lit the can-
dle. The light from the candle, focused
and intensiﬁed by the reﬂective holder,
shone onto the mirror of the scope and
up through the slide. Max applied his
eye to the viewing lens.
A few adjustments of the knurled

knob on the body brought the image
into focus: a few motes of dark debris
ﬂoating through a clear orange land-
scape, ﬂickering with the spits and
puffs of the candle.
Max switched to
the highest power lens.
Off at one
corner he saw a ﬂutter of motion, and
steered the ﬁeld toward it.
An oval
shape with a fuzzy border spun in
view. Its interior held the pigmented
forms of mysterious structures - a ma-
jor round one, lines and squiggles and
balls and tubes implying others, all
swimming in and out of sight at the
limit of visibility under the uncertain
candlelight.
Now for the interesting part, Max
thought. He glanced over at the book
with his spare eye, found the sentence
he wanted, and spoke its three activa-
tion words. A sizzling sound began. At
the base of the scope a silvery nimbus

formed, circulating around the stage
holding the slide and the lower part
of the compound lens mount.
Max
returned his gaze to the lens and ad-
justed the slide to return the animac-
ule fully to view. Sparks and crackles
of miniature lightning jumped around
the ﬁeld, each ﬂash of energy illumi-
nating the scene more sharply, then let-
ting it fade again into orange shadow.
Inside the cytoplasm of the animacule,
though, something else was going on.
At one side of the larger round spot,
in an area of overlapping squiggles so
tiny that Max could barely pick it out,
there was a sudden sparkle of green.
Max focused in on it. Yes, it was there,
it was deﬁnitely there - a twinkling of
inﬁnitesimal pinpoints, each the barest
ﬂash of green.
Max straightened up and scanned
back through the ledger-book.
Roni

had also seen this phenomenon - a mi-
croscopic constellation, she had called
it.
After ﬁne-tuning the ﬁlter spell
to weed out any signiﬁcant artifacts,
she had concluded that the effect was
real. Those green pinpoints were each
marking a release of magical energy.
Max pursed his lips, took another
look through the scope, sat up again.
Uncapping the inkwell on the table, he
dipped a pen and wrote below Roni’s
last line in the ledger:
"Amazing work - you’ve found it!
And now for the real fun - ﬁrst to un-
derstand exactly how this conversion
works, then how to harness it, then
how to control it."
He sat back and stared off through
the windows, into the landscape in the
light of the dawning sun. Plans, Max
thought,
more plans,
always plans.
But this one was different. If we con-

trol the roots of power we can ﬁnally
take on the gods.
"So what do you think?"
Max jumped on the stool, startled
out of his reverie.
Roni was leaning in the doorway,
wrapped in a robe, her hair tucked into
the robe’s hood. "I didn’t hear you come
in," he said.
"You were concentrating, I didn’t
want to disturb you. Anyway, I’ve al-
ways liked watching you when you’re
thinking about something, you get that
dreamy mind-in-another-world expres-
sion."
"Hah," Max said, "don’t give me that.
Since when is your mind going wooly?"
He turned his head away and looked
out the window at the colors of the
rising sun.
"What did I think, you
asked?
You’ve done landmark work,
that’s what I think.
It was worth it

getting dragged here just to see this.”
"Thank you, Max.” She was looking
out the window too, her arms crossed
tightly over her chest. “Max, I wanted
to tell you, I’m sorry about the situa-
tion, what we’re asking you to do for
us.”
He shrugged.
"It’s not your fault.
That still doesn’t mean I’m looking for-
ward to it, because I’m not. This thing
could be pretty unpleasant, you know,"
Max said.
"I told you I’m sorry, Max, I really
am."
Max leaned back in the chair and
stared up at the ceiling.
"Sometimes
I think friends are more trouble than
they’re worth; all I seem to do some
years is bail you all out of problems.
Friends don’t want to die, well, I don’t
want to die either, but somehow it’s
always my life getting risked out in

front."
"You do it because you like to do it."
"That’s true, up to a point. Beyond
that point, I do it because I never seem
to have any choice."
"You’ve chosen not to have a choice,"
Roni said. “You’re the one who wanted
to take on the gods. You didn’t have to
do that. Plenty of people have been liv-
ing with the gods for a long time with
any issues at all."
"Whether these people admit it or
not, the problem was there all along, I
only inherited it. But why are you get-
ting so worked up about it now, after
all this time?"
"Because I’m tired of you complain-
ing. Your biggest problem is now the
gods are an obsession with you.
You
wanted to demonstrate you have free
will? - well, okay, you’ve done it. You’ve
got free will. Why not use it for your-

self for a change? Why not ﬁnd some-
one and fall in love? It would do you
good, you’re getting too sour.”
Max raised one eyebrow and looked
sideways up at Roni. Was that why she
was worked up? Give me a break, Max
thought. "I’ve been in love," he said.
Roni turned a subtle red color. "You
know it would have never worked out."
"You know it might have," Max said.
"But it’s all right.
You chose Karlini,
probably a better pick in any case, he’s
a lot easier to get along with than I
am, and that was that. You’re my good
friend, and I like you, but I don’t love
you."
"Max, I -"
"I don’t want to talk about it. Any-
way, that’s not the only time I’ve been
in love, and things didn’t work out then
either."
"You should still ﬁnd someone new."

"I’m not in the mood," Max snapped.
"Max, that’s -"
"You think I should show free will?
You think I should settle down? I can’t
settle down. I wouldn’t mind it for a
change, but I can’t.
The last time I
tried, a ﬁreball dropped out of the sky
and blew up the house. If I hadn’t been
standing next to a window I wouldn’t
have gotten out.
The problem was I
wasn’t the only one inside.
And you
say I should fall in love?
You say I
should show free will? Forget it. That’s
the dream. I stay on the road because
I don’t have a choice. I won’t have a
choice until I can turn and ﬁght back,
and make it count." Max stabbed a ﬁn-
ger toward the microscope. "And with
the work you’ve got here I’m ﬁnally
going to be able to do it."
“If you survive Roosing Oolvaya.”
“Well, yeah, of course,” said Max.

“There is that.”

Chapter9
WHAT I DIDN’T
KNOW
EVEN AFTER THEY DUMPED ME
IN THE LOCAL JAIL I was still
thinking it over.
The way the Guard
had arrested me had been slick as a
textbook. I couldn’t see anyone bother-
ing to learn my habits well enough to
trap me that neatly, with me not even

able to draw my sword, much less ﬁght
or run, so it might have been purely
good luck for them or bad luck for
me. Either way, it didn’t seem like I’d
gotten any beneﬁt from the metabolic
association with Gashanatantra, my
erstwhile client. Any luck he had sure
hadn’t rubbed off.
Luck or no luck, though, I couldn’t
make the operation add up. The way
I read it, that squad had been ready
for me. They knew I was someone they
were after, they’d recognized me im-
mediately, and they’d acted in perfect
coordination without pausing to think.
Reviewing my activities for the last few
weeks, I couldn’t think of anything I’d
done that would make me that impor-
tant a target. In fact, their recognition
of me was just a little too perfect; I
don’t have a particularly distinctive
face, but they hadn’t even checked

me against a description. They’d just
jumped.
That left a couple of possibilities. I
ruled out mistaken identity - with all
the crazy stuff I had been mixed up
in lately, it didn’t surprise me at all
that something this unusual had hap-
pened. Of course, being picked up by
the Guard because I’d been confused
with somebody else would have been
the most ridiculous thing of all. I didn’t
think I had to reach that far. No, I had
the feeling I’d been pegged. A person
out there in the city wanted me out of
circulation, and had managed it very
nicely.
One side of martial law is a
tendency to arrest everyone handy and
sort things out later. With all the con-
fusion in the city, and the number of
people being grabbed, I could disap-
pear into the shufﬂe for a week or two
and no one would think twice about

it, or come looking for me either. With
Gash and his damned metabolic link-
age hanging over me, though, on ice
was exactly where I couldn’t afford to
be.
I didn’t have to think too hard to
ﬁnd a prime candidate for wanting me
out of the way. The barrier-maker was
the obvious one.
Oh, sure, some per-
son who had their own grudge against
me could have chosen this time to get
even, but I thought I’d already piled up
enough coincidences for one morning.
It was improbable enough to think that
the barrier-maker already knew I was
looking for him. I had had no reason
to think he knew who I was, except
for the clear fact that there I was, sit-
ting in jail, and I hadn’t found him yet.
Unless I had, and hadn’t realized it. I
did have a candidate; after all, the list
of people I’d talked to since this new

mess had started was real short. My
new pal Gash, and Carl Lake.
In fact, you could say Carl had led
me right into that Guard troop.
He
could have left his house, assuming
I’d follow him, and sent his manser-
vant off to arrange things with the
Guard.
He didn’t necessarily even
have to arrange anything - for all I
knew he could have just plain taken
control of the soldiers’ minds and led
them through it directly. Following a
magician can be tricky, which I knew,
of course, but like a sap I’d let myself
ignore it. When a magician’s around,
you never know what things just hap-
pen by themselves and what they’ve
caused deliberately. The ﬁnal misstep
that had put my hand out of reach of
my sword - was that chance, or did
magic make my foot slip? The perfect
coordination of the Guardsmen - was

it practice and drill and luck, or was
somebody else running them?
That’s
why I hate magic. Things are usually
complicated enough without having to
worry about whether a given thing was
random or not, or whether a hidden
puppet master was calling the shots
in a way I’d never detect, or whether
a piece of evidence was real or had
materialized out of a puff of colored
smoke.
Carl had acted a little strangely dur-
ing our talk, too.
He’d taken things a little too calmly,
like maybe the barrier wasn’t really
news to him after all. And then at the
end, when I was leaving, he’d jumped
when I’d asked about anyone new to
town, when he didn’t think I could see
him. I’d seen enough, though, to make
me think that if he didn’t put up the
barrier himself, he had a pretty good

idea who did.
I had to assume that
since Carl didn’t tell me about it, he
didn’t want me to know.
If he didn’t
want me to know what was going on,
or to mess with it, the next step was to
ensure that I didn’t ﬁnd out what was
happening on my own.
We’d been friendly enough in the
past, but of course cordiality didn’t nec-
essarily mean anything when you got
down to serious business.
Still, if he
was up to something tricky now and
knew I was after him, he might have
chosen to merely stash me out of the
way rather than do me in. Putting me
where he could get to me later might
even have advantages for him. In case
whatever he was doing was out-and-
out dangerous, it wouldn’t have been
stretching the point too much to imag-
ine him giving himself an insurance
policy; if things got desperate enough

he could spring me and get me to help
him.
For that matter, he’d always
seemed to think I was pretty compe-
tent. If he’d really arranged to get me
in the clink, he might think I wouldn’t
let myself stay there long, and that
when I got out, the ﬁrst place I’d come
asking questions was wherever he was.
If he was in trouble, I’d be there to
help him out of it. That idea was nice
for my ego, in a backhanded sort of
way.
Looking around the tidy little
hoosegow, though, I had the unpleas-
ant feeling that that concept might just
overestimate my abilities by a little too
much.
When I said the jail was small, I
wasn’t exaggerating.
The main cell
was about the size of my ofﬁce, and
if you added the room where the guy
with the keys sat you could tack on
the landing at the top of my staircase -

space for a chair and a front door and
not much else. I thought it was pretty
poor planning, myself. If you’re going
to hold a coup, you’d better arrange
enough accommodations for the loy-
alists you’re planning to pull off the
streets. They were probably using the
lockups in the city itself as holding
areas, shipping the prisoners off to the
real dungeons underneath the island
palace whenever they got around to it.
Even if the full-scale dungeons were
worse, I thought it might be just as
well to make the move . The place I
was in was small, but it was also pretty
crowded.
The cell was basically a cage of thick
iron bars built into the side of the build-
ing. The bars ran horizontally as well
as up-and-down, and were attached
to each other where they crossed by
heavy messy welds. Whoever had built

it hadn’t wanted anyone getting out,
ever - the cage had a ceiling of the
same cross-hatched bar, and a ﬂoor to
match.
I still had the small knife in
my boot, but I sure wasn’t going to saw
my way out with that. Forget the lock,
too. It wasn’t big and it wasn’t heavy,
but its outlines had the kind of vague
fuzz that charged-up magic gives. An-
other ﬂagrant example of overkill, but
maybe it had its point. The only key
that would open that lock was the one
that had been in the hole when the
spell was cast. It couldn’t be picked.
I had the chance to examine the de-
tails of the cell’s construction so closely
for a simple reason. When they threw
me in I couldn’t go very far.
In fact,
they had to lean on the door to close
it, like trying to get the lid down on a
trunk you’ve just packed for a three-
year vacation.
The cell wasn’t ﬁlled,

it was stuffed. There must have been
forty people jammed in there already.
I’d never tried to get forty people into
my ofﬁce, but I think the back wall
would have come off before I got past
thirty. The troopers shoved me in back-
ward, and the ﬁrst thing I heard were
the growls and "oof"s from my near-
est new neighbors as my momentum
elbowed them aside. My own mother
could have been in that cell, some-
where in the back, and I never would
have known it.
After I got ﬁnished
studying the bars in front of my nose
and gradually squirmed my vantage
point around, though, I was somehow
not surprised to recognize the second
face at my back.
"Gag," I said, "you don’t look so hot.
You need some air?"
The face of Gag the Hairless was
almost beatiﬁc in its look of peace. It

was the face of a man who had just
had his fondest dreams come true, and
to whom such details as this jail were
now so much insigniﬁcant confetti. He
slowly noticed me, his expression lost
in dreams. "Nah,” he said blissfully.
Even his moustache had gone limp
with tranquility. "Hey, Gag, talk to me.
What were you smoking?"
With the noise in the cell, I could
only hear him because his mouth was
almost embedded in my ear. "The pay-
roll," he said.
"The payroll for the
Black Legion."
I said, "You were smoking a payroll?"
not because I thought his answer was
in direct response to my question, but
because I thought it might get him ir-
ritated enough to bounce back down to
the human plane for a few lines. To my
surprise, it worked. His eyebrows fur-
rowed and his eyes focused.

"Eh," he said, "what?"
"The payroll for the Black Legion?"
His mouth resumed its county-wide
smile and his eyebrows relaxed. "You
wouldn’t have believed it, The most
amazing thing you’d ever see in your
life.
Like heaven, that’s what it was
like. The Black Legion, you know, one
of the bunch of mercenaries this Kaar
guy brought in? They wanted their loot
up front. Two month’s worth of down
payment, retainer, yeah, that’s what
they got - a whole safe full of nothing
but gold."
Gag giggled. "You told me I better
not push my luck. I never had so much
luck in my whole life. Everybody wants
a hideout, right? I had one, this great
little inn place, up an alley out of the
way where nobody’d even think of look-
ing for an inn. It was perfect. I’d go
back after a job, hole up, relax - per-

fect."
His smile widened, a feat I hadn’t
thought was possible.
"I wasn’t the
only one who loved the place.
The
Black Legion stumbled over it too, de-
cided it was the perfect spot for their
own hideout. The place to sit on their
loot." Gag chuckled. "Sure, they threw
me out when they were securing the
top ﬂoor, but the same time they were
rolling me down the stairs they were
dragging this safe up."
"You got the whole safe?"
"You should have been there.
Ev-
erybody should have been there.
It
was great. Their storeroom was in the
back, so I just hung down off the roof,
sawed through the wall, and blew out
the back of the safe. Just between you
and me, it wasn’t that much of a safe,"
he said, lowering his voice even more.
"If an outﬁt like that isn’t smart

enough to protect its own payroll, they
deserve what they get," I said.
"Exactly like what I said too. Course,
I’m here, so I guess somebody was do-
ing some protecting."
"But did they get their gold back?"
"Nah.
Why do you think I’m here,
and not ﬂoating around in some sewer?"
"You got a point there," I said. "You’re
also lucky the Guard found you instead
of the Black Legion"
"How’d you know that?"
"If you stole this Legion’s whole two-
month stash and they had you but they
didn’t have it, I think they’d spend as
long as it took to convince you to give
it back. These mercenaries have a lot
of ways to convince people to do things
like that. Most of them are hard and
blunt or cold and sharp."
For the ﬁrst time Gag glanced around
suddenly back to earth and looking ner-

vous. "Uh, yeah. Hey, uh, you think
the Guard heard the Black Legion was
after me, and since they spotted me
ﬁrst they picked me up?
But maybe
the Guard don’t know what I did.
If
they knew, maybe I wouldn’t be in
here, huh? Maybe they’d go after the
Legion’s gold too."
"I think you’ve hit it right on the
head." I said. "And here you are, sit-
ting around, just waiting for somebody
to remember you and ﬁgure out what
you’ve done. Who knows - maybe the
Black Legion will decide to check out
the jails themselves. They could walk
in that front door there any second."
"Don’t say that," Gag said with a
note of resignation. "You’re a right guy,
don’t do this to me. I gotta get out of
here, I know I gotta get out of here,
only I can’t. I ain’t got none of my stuff.
I can’t blow out of here without my

stuff."
Well, there went that hope. "Think
about it for a while. You’re a smart guy,
Gag, maybe you’ll come up with some-
thing."
“Well, okay." He didn’t sound too
convinced, which meant he was being
realistic.
Realistic or not, we had to
think of something.
1f nothing else,
we’d suffocate if we stayed in that
place.
I scanned the crowd, but Gag
was the only person I recognized.
I turned and studied the lock again.
There was something about it that
puzzled me, but I couldn’t quite ﬁg-
ure out what it was. It was a normal
round lock, about six inches across
and painted black.
Its outlines were
slightly indistinct and slowly swim-
ming -
Wait a minute. I’d never seen fuzzy
edges before on anything but a cat

or after anything but a binge. My eyes
were still good so I ﬁgured it couldn’t be
their fault; the Guard hadn’t whacked
me over the head so I didn’t have a
fresh concussion. Now that I thought
about it, I remembered that I’d only
heard that some sorcerers were able
to pick out magic-loaded items by that
wooly radiation.
Some of them had
described the manifestation as a bit
of haze around whatever-it-was.
I’d
only heard about it, I’d never been
able to do it – like I said, I’m not a
magic user - but then there that lock
was, sure enough, fuzzing away like
mad. Maybe, I thought with a sudden
surge of hope, I was getting a little
inadvertent help from Gash and his
metabolism thing after all.
I stared at the lock. Well, what did
I do now? The way popular tale-tellers
liked to describe it, when you worked

magic you reached out with your mind
and then something impressive hap-
pened. I knew better. Magic was work,
hard work, and the hardest parts were
in the theory. Another reason I didn’t
like magic was that I could never han-
dle the math.
On the other hand, what did I have
to lose? Maybe gods didn’t have to do
things the same way regular sorcerers
did. So I tried reaching out with my
mind. Have you ever tried reaching out
with your mind? Right. All I had to
do was actually think about how to do
that, and I realized I didn’t have the
slightest idea what it meant.
I scowled at the lock.
I want you
open, I thought.
The lock sat there,
ignoring me.
I tried to ﬁght down
my growing frustration.
I’d heard
at another time that frustration was
the quickest way to magical paralysis.

Even if you felt you couldn’t do some-
thing, you had better not pay too much
attention to the feeling or it would
dominate you, and the feedback would
make sure that you really couldn’t do
it. I can do it, I told myself, really I
can.
The lock still sat there. I decided to
try another approach. I concentrated
on the lock, I visualized the lock, I vi-
sualized the lock open. I tried to ﬁll my
mind with lock, lock, nothing but lock.
Nothing but open lock. I wrapped my
hand around the lock, willing power to
ﬂow across and blast it open.
I even
thought about tasting the lock.
The obstinate nasty son-of-a-crocodile
lock didn’t even twitch.
Against all my attempts at control,
I was getting frustrated after all, but
what I really was getting was mad.
I hit the lock with the side of my

hand.
All thoughts of the lock van-
ished.
"Yeaow!" I said, clutched my
hand, wondered if I was dumb enough
to have broken it.
Suddenly the door to the jailhouse
opened. A Guard lieutenant and half-
a-dozen very large troopers crowded
in to the room with the jailer, their
swords drawn.
I could see a whole
bunch of other soldiers behind them
in the street, and through the win-
dow more of them were spreading out
around the building.
"All right, you
men," the lieutenant called out, "you’re
getting out of this rathole!"
Nobody answered him. We all knew
that wasn’t the bottom line.
I closed my eyes and thought, "Open!”
I heard a rattle of chains and more
stamping and opened one eye wide
enough to peek.
Another half-dozen
soldiers were dragging in a long length

of heavy chain studded with mana-
cles; if that lobby had already seemed
packed, it clearly had seen nothing
yet. The lieutenant shouted, "Time to
move out to the palace!" but when I’d
seen that chain I’d already ﬁgured it
out. I was annoyed and frustrated and
mad, and the pain from my hand was
like the time a ruby-eyed marmovore
tried to chew off my ﬁnger, and the
last thing I wanted to add to my mood
was the pleasure of being shackled in
irons and dumped in a dungeon, and
so I screwed my eyes shut and thought
"OPEN!" as hard as I could, trying to
push all of the anger and pent-up frus-
tration into it, sweeping everything
else out of my mind until it was only
OPEN, my entire world was OPEN, I
felt myself hitting my hand once again
against the lock for good measure, all
the muscles and veins were standing

out on my forehead, and then all at
once my head spun and I lost my bal-
ance and I fell hard against the bars.
That’s all I need, I thought fuzzily, I
gave myself a stroke.
But something,
I didn’t quite know quite what, some-
thing had happened.
My nose was mashed up next to the
lock.
I squinted at the lock.
It was
still closed, locked tight. I snarled at
it. "Gods damn -” I said.
The ﬂoor rumbled. I opened my eyes
wide and looked around.
Everyone
else, Guard included, was doing the
same thing.
The ﬂoorboards creaked
and rippled, and one of the troopers
lost his balance and pitched over, tak-
ing his neighbor with him.
Another
man fell backward through the door.
"Earthqua -" somebody shouted, and
then the rumbling stopped.
The quiet in the jail was striking.

The Guardsmen picked themselves up,
gazing nervously at the ﬂoor.
Most
everyone in the place was nervously
aware of the ﬂoor.
"Right!” said the
lieutenant. "Now I want you all to -"
And then the rumbling was back.
Boards groaned, metal screeched, Guard
men fell down, and the cage that was
the cell lurched backward and dropped
a foot. Beneath the cage, the wood ﬂoor
rippled and puckered down, then tore
open and began to rip back toward its
edges. The bars at the bottom of the
cell, in the middle where the weight
on them from the standing people was
heaviest, slowly started to bend down-
ward into the widening hole under-
neath. Even over the rumble and the
creaking and the squeaking, I could
hear the snap and clang as the welds
holding the bars together started to go.
All at once, a man in the center of the

cell dropped with a wail out of sight
like he he’d fallen straight through a
trapdoor, which, in a close way, was
exactly what had happened. The cell
lurched again and tilted further.
People were sliding and dropping
in numbers now as the bars peeled
away in earnest. A few men had man-
aged to jump up in the air and had
grabbed hold of the bars enclosing
the ceiling, and their dangling forms
were increasingly visible as the rest of
the crowd lessened.
I had one hand
wrapped around Gag’s collar and the
other arm looped through a bar in the
door. "When the avalanche is over, we
go!" I yelled at him.
"But that hole!" Gag said. "It’s deep!
We fall in and we keep going forever!"
“It’s not that deep," I said. "Listen
to the screams. They don’t gradually
fade away like they’re falling out of

range, they just go on a little and stop.
You can even hear guys moving around
down there."
Gag listened.
On the other side of
the door, the lieutenant was fumbling
with the key, trying to ﬁt it into the
lock. The other troopers and the jail-
ers were staring blankly at the scene.
Boards that had fallen from the ceil-
ing were scattered on the ﬂoor, and the
ﬂoor itself was covered with small dark
holes and splintered ﬂoorboards that
waved their jagged edges in the air.
I reached through the bars, grabbed
the front of the lieutenant’s tunic, and
yanked him sharply toward me.
His
head swung forward and hit two bars,
one on either cheek, he started to slide
to the ﬂoor, and the key dropped out
of his hand, bounced once on the ﬂoor
and once in the cell, and then spun
with a single reﬂected ﬂash over the

edge into the pit and disappeared.
"Nice move," Gag said approvingly.
"Thanks," I said, rolling my eyes at
another striking example of my luck.
"But now we’ve got no choice. Time to
go." The cell had tilted back at an an-
gle, resting partly on the wooden back
wall of the jail building. The wall had
bowed outward and was creaking omi-
nously. The handful of remaining pris-
oners were clinging desperately to the
bars as far away from the center of the
cell as they could get. One man who
had still been hanging from the roof of
the cell looked down, sighted carefully,
swung once, and dropped into the hole.
A second later we heard a low thud and
an "oof" over the shouts and clatter.
Gag and I edged gingerly out toward
the hole and peeked over the edge. The
meshwork of iron bars that remained
of the cell ﬂoor actually extended out

over the rim of the pit before the bars
came apart from each other and be-
gan to curve down. The entire center
section had torn completely off, but
certain other parts of dangling mesh
were still attached to the rest of the
ﬂoor structure.
Right below us, two
twisted bars reached down ﬁve feet
below the level of the ﬂoor.
Enough
crossbars were still attached to these
to make a kind of crude ladder leading
into the gloom of the pit.
Below the
bottom-most rung, perhaps ten or ﬁf-
teen feet further down, we could see
a ﬂat ﬂoor.
This level was now cov-
ered with mounds of dirt and rock and
former prisoners. "A room," Gag said.
"That’s a room down there."
"Somebody’s basement, looks like,"
I said.
The wood frames and braces
that had supported the room’s ceiling
still stuck up through the rubble.
It

was certainly a convenient time for
a cave-in, though, if that was really
what it was. Something went "zzftt!"
through my hair and clanged off a bar
across from me - an arrow! It was less
than half-a-minute since the ﬁrst rum-
ble, but the Guard was sorting itself
out. I pushed off, slid down the curve
of the twisted ladder, grabbed the bot-
tom rung with both hands as I passed
it, paused, swinging back and forth,
identiﬁed an open spot, and let go.
The prisoners in the basement were
sorting themselves out, too, with many
of them already on their feet and the
rest either still unconscious or deciding
whether their limbs were actually bro-
ken or just battered and strained. Gag
arrived next to me, looked around, and
said, "Where’s the exit?"
"Behind this," a brawny man said
from one side. He was straining at a

section of slate covered two thirds of
the way up by a rockslide, snapped
timbers protruding from the sides of
the pile. Another two men were using
lengths of broken cell bar to sweep dirt
and rocks off the slate. With a crack,
another timber splintered and the rock
settled further.
"Forget that," Gag told me with a
professional air. A loud clanging came
from above as someone set to work
on the cage. Gag cocked his head, lis-
tened, and then said, "The Guard’s
gonna get through those bars inside of
ten minutes."
I had spent a moment orienting my-
self, and I thought what I had in mind
might work. I turned Gag around and
led him back, stepping over a groaning
form.
"The street runs back here," I
said.
"So?" Gag said.

"So I spotted a manhole cover down
the block when they dragged me in.
There’s a sewer under that street ...
I could scarcely see Gag at all in the
darkness, but I caught a glint from
his teeth as he grinned. He was run-
ning his hands over the surface of the
wall, and I joined him. Then, down at
the bottom, I felt rock. "Over here!" I
yelled. "Another way!"
Men immediately surrounded me,
dragging away a stack of crates that
blocked part of the wall, kneeling to
scrape away at the base, pushing and
yanking at the stones.
With a low
grinding shudder one of the big stones
moved. "Here!" someone said. "Push!"
We scrambled for a hold, drew our
breath, and leaned. The stone rumbled
and moved into the wall, one inch, two,
and caught up.
Behind us, with a clang and a new

crash, more of the cage and a shower
of rocks and ﬂoor fell into the base-
ment. "Now!" the man said again, and
we all strained against the stone.
It
caught, jerked, caught again, abruptly
rattled away from us with a dull bass
groan, and then suddenly there was
no resistance at all. The stone slid out
of touch, we fell against the wall with
all our force suddenly released, and a
great crash and plop and splash sent
a shower of water up through the hole
and into our faces.
Below us now was the gurgle of run-
ning water. One man squirmed head-
ﬁrst through the hole and slid free
with another splash, a second man fol-
lowed, and all of a sudden a pile-up
had formed. "Let’s do this orderly or
we’ll never do it at all!" I shouted, the
crowd eased up, and I took advantage
of the small gap in front to swing my

legs through the opening, grab a hand-
hold on the rocks on either side, and
lower myself carefully through.
This sewer was square-shaped in-
stead of the usual cylinder, and only
about ﬁve feet across.
The rock we’d
pushed out had formed the upper part
of one side of the wall just above the
surface of the water, and it now sat
there on the bottom breaking the slug-
gish current at a crazy angle.
The
ﬁrst man through lay limply over the
stone, unconscious from the bash he’d
taken when he’d rashly plunged head-
ﬁrst. I took a second to prop his head
out of the water and then headed off
downstream.
The only light came obliquely through
the slats of the manholes and the collec-
tion tubes leading up to the streets and
buildings. I didn’t need light. though,
to tell me I wanted out of there fast.

Scuttling and paddling along while
bent over like a hunchback through
what was frankly pretty disgusting wa-
ter breathing putrid air was nowhere
near my favorite part of the job.
As
a matter of fact, the lack of light was
probably good - I didn’t really want to
know exactly what kind of junk was
ﬂoating along and brushing up against
me.
It was better to have the trash
down here than up in the streets, I
knew, but that observation paled a
little when you weren’t actually in
the streets, appreciating their cleanli-
ness. Sounds of ﬂailing and splashing
behind me were suddenly joined by
shouts and crashes, and I ﬁgured that
the Guard had gotten wise and opened
a manhole. An intersection appeared,
I turned right into a larger tube, and
the sounds behind me faded.
I hoped Gag had gotten clear too,

not to mention the rest of the poor
slobs who’d been swept up in the drag-
net, but I wasn’t going to spend all
my time worrying about them. I had
other things on my mind. There was
still Carl Lake, and Gashanatantra,
and whether that little earthquake or
cave-in had really had something to do
with me, and other matters like that. I
jumped up to catch the ladder hanging
from the next manhole I passed and
climbed up through the shaft to the
surface.
Levering up the edge of the
heavy wooden manhole cover, I peeked
out. I didn’t recognize the street, but
at the moment that didn’t matter. The
important point was that the street
was deserted.
I pulled myself through and let the
cover drop. The street was narrow and
short and dull, not much more than a
block-long alley, which made it perfect

for the kind of entrance I was making.
I turned left at the corner and then
left again, and then I knew where I
was - about ten blocks in from the wa-
terfront and a few blocks north of the
south wall.
The sun was casting the shadows
of early afternoon.
A lot could have
happened while I was having my deal-
ings with the Guard, and I ﬁgured I’d
better get back in touch with events
pretty quick. On the other hand, my
sojourn in the sewers had left me thor-
oughly unﬁt for any decent human
contact. The street I’d entered had a
horse trough a block or so down, but it
was going to take more than a simple
trough to deal with me. One idea was
a fast jump in the nearby river. That
would get me wet but not necessarily
clean; the sewers had to empty some-
place. A public bath was another idea,

and I was about to go looking for one
when my mind unexpectedly lit on the
third and best idea of all.
I took off at a jog. People wrinkled
their noses and tossed rotten things at
me as I passed, and the lucky few who
saw me coming had enough time to
move out of nasal range. I didn’t blame
them a bit. I lost a small pack of dogs
that had showed up out of nowhere,
rounded one ﬁnal corner, and pounded
on a neat oval door next to the open-
front stall of a glassmaker. A window
opened on the third ﬂoor high above
my head. "Who is it? said a woman’s
voice.
I stepped back and looked up. "Hey,
who are you?" she said.
"Look under the scum,” I said.
“. . . I don’t believe it."
"I’m having a little trouble with it
myself," I said.
"How about coming

down and letting me in?"
"Are you crazy? Let you in? After
what happened last time you were
here, you think I’d ever open my door
for you again?"
Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea
after all. "Flora, be reasonable. I was
under a spell, you know that.
I was
more embarrassed than you were."
“That’s what they all say,” she said,
snifﬁng at me. "Maybe it’s even true.
I don’t care.
Even if it is true, you
shouldn’t be in my neighborhood at the
moment, let alone my house, looking
like you look and smelling like you -"
"If you don’t come down here I’m
going to start smearing myself on the
walls. Then you try dealing with the
neighbors."
". . . If I let you in, what next?"
"What do you mean, what next?"
"Are you planning to tell me later

you were under another spell?"
I considered telling her I was under
another spell, only not the kind she
was thinking of, but under the circum-
stances I thought she might not take
it the right way. "You’re safe from me,
Flora, I promise I’m not going to pull
anything."
"We’ll see about that. Where’s your
sword? I’ve never seen you without a
sword."
"The Guard took it," I said. "I’ll tell
you about it when I’m clean."
"I’m sure I’m not interested," she
said haughtily.
"But all right, then,
suppose you’re telling the truth for a
change. What do I get out of this?"
"The story’s got more in it than just
the sword. It’ll tell you something use-
ful."
"Useful? Hah! What could you tell
me that would be any use at all?"

"Something that could keep you from
getting dead. That sound good enough
for you?"
Her head withdrew and the window
slammed. A moment later there was a
stamping on the stairs inside and the
door opened a narrow crack behind a
chain. I could dimly see Flora inside
with her arms folded. "Okay, the door’s
open, big guy detective. Now what do
you want?"
I was highly aware of how much I
was dripping on her porch and she was
clearly about ready to kick the door
shut again in my face. "Carl Lake been
around lately?" I said quickly.
Her foot against the door paused.
"Why?" she said.
"He called you to a meeting, right?"
The chain rattled loose and slowly
the door swung more fully open. "How
do you know about that And what’s it

to you?"
"Clean up ﬁrst."
She sniffed again, this time at closer
range,
gagged,
and turned a light
shade of green.
"If I want to stand
close enough to hear what you’re say-
ing, I guess you’ll have to get detoxiﬁed
somehow. Go around the back."
The front door closed, and I went
around the side of the building to an-
other pair of larger cross-timbered
doors, like the doors to a barn.
One
of them creaked as the bar inside was
pushed back. With a louder creak, the
door slid open just enough for me to
ease through it and into Flora’s work-
room.
The
workroom
was
a
two-story
chamber with a loft, ﬁlled with sev-
eral hulking barrels and tanks, two
bookcases, a workbench, and a black-
board.
Windows around the second

ﬂoor let in the light.
"Stand on that
grate," Flora said, indicating a square
mesh inset in the ﬂoor with open space
underneath.
As I walked over to it,
she threw a lever and manipulated a
crank on the wall.
Belts attached to
the crank stretched up to the ceiling
and ran off into a complicated maze of
pulleys and gears. A tube and spout at-
tached to one of the tanks swung over
until it was suspended over my head.
She drew a ﬁgure in the air, a ﬁgure
that trailed like blue smoke behind
her ﬁnger and then drifted across the
room to spin slowly around my head.
Through the slight haze of dancing
blue motes, I saw Flora throw another
lever.
A valve squeaked, up on the
tank, liquid gurgled, and then a rush
of water cascaded through the tube
and out of the spout and down over
me. Bits of blue from the hanging ring

came off in the water and washed over
my clothes in a glittering rain, spread-
ing and scouring away the slime and
refuse with remarkable efﬁciency.
"I’m sure I won’t be ﬂattered," Flora
said over the patter of the water, "but
why did you decide to come here?"
I rinsed my mouth, gargled, and spit.
"You’re a magician, your specialty is
water, and you were close. I needed to
talk to another magician, I needed to
get washed off, and I needed to do both
of them pretty quickly. That may not
be ﬂattering, but it’s unfortunately the
truth."
She cranked the lever back and the
stream of water slowed to a trickle and
stopped. "That’s the truth?" she said.
"There wasn’t anything in that little
talk about friendship."
"These days I don’t know who’s a
friend and who isn’t," I said, brushing

water out of my hair with both hands.
"Besides, if I’d said I was coming to see
you because you were a friend, I sort
of thought you might take it the wrong
way, judging from the other part of our
conversation outside."
She threw her head back and laughed
"What’s funny?" I said.
"You!" she whooped.
"You’ve got a
timid streak as wide as the Oolvaan!"
"I’d call it tact. Throw me a towel."
She found one and lobbed it at me,
still laughing. Flora was in her ﬁfties
and in good conditioning; magicians
usually had to be because of the phys-
ical demands.
She had put on a few
pounds, though, which probably meant
that business was slow; Flora was on
retainer to the Venerance for mainte-
nance of the ﬂood-abatement defenses,
but the weather had been quiet lately
and I guess she didn’t have too much

else going on.
Remember coupling?
When a magician was active running
a lot of spell-work, he or she had trou-
ble keeping up their body weight ;
the power expenditures kept burning
through their ﬂesh. Between jobs, the
thoughtful magician tried to put on
some body mass, in order to have an
extra cushion to draw against when
things picked up again.
Flora wasn’t really my type, not that
I’d ever ﬁgured out exactly what that
was, but events had thrown us together
a few times before this and we’d found
that we could be pleasant with each
other.
It wasn’t automatic, pleasant-
ness never was, but it did happen on
occasion, and so every so often we’d
been friends.
At the moment, though, it remained
to be seen. "All right, you’re clean now,"
she said. "Now it’ s your turn."

I decided to stay where I was and
drip over the drain for the time being.
Under the circumstances, I thought
it might be better not to take off my
clothes and ring them out.
"I got a
client this morning," I said. "He was
some magician I’d never seen before
who’d been in the city on business and
now was having a problem in getting
out.
According to him, the problem
wasn’t the Guard.
There was some
kind of magical barrier around the city
that hadn’t been there when he’d ar-
rived. He wanted me to ﬁnd out who’d
put it up and get them to take it down."
"You’re not a magician.
You hate
magic. Why would you get involved in
something like that?"
"The guy was amazingly persua-
sive," I said sarcastically. "I didn’t like
the idea of him turning me into a toad.
I took the job and went to see Carl.

When I asked him about the barrier he
tried to act surprised but it sounded
like it wasn’t big news to him."
"What kind of barrier are you talk-
ing about?"
"Magical
quarantine,
supposedly,
also to keep people from looking in
across it. Magicians, I mean, not regu-
lar people."
"It couldn’t have been Carl.
Carl
couldn’t establish that kind of barrier,
no one in Roosing Oolvaya could . . .
except maybe for the new guy."
"New guy? What new guy?"
She had seated herself in a chair
pulled out from the desk.
I followed
her lead and lowered myself to a more
comfortable position on the ﬂoor next
to the grate. "I’ve only heard rumors,"
Flora said. "Some new guy in a rented
house somewhere near the north wall,
supposedly very powerful."

"Hmm," I said, "a big-leaguer? Just
in from out of town?
Interesting.
I
didn’t think Carl had built this barrier
thing himself, either, but I thought he
might have known who did.
He had
been acting like he knew more than
he was telling. Carl usually does, but
this was different.
Anyway, he said
he might call a magicians’ meeting
and check things out himself. Maybe,
I thought, and maybe not.
I left his
house, went around the block, and
came back just in time to see Carl
leaving.
He was going north.
I fol-
lowed him and walked into a Guard
ambush."
"You, an ambush?"
"Yeah, me. The situation was a little
peculiar, but I was still sloppy.
They
threw me in a cell, I managed to get
out, and I headed over here to see you."
Flora’s earlier nastiness had faded.

"So," she said thoughtfully, "what do
you think now?"
"What I know and what I suspect are
different. I’ve got a feeling that Carl’s
up to something that’s not healthy. He
has called a meeting, obviously, but
I’m suspicious about what’s really go-
ing to happen there. Maybe Carl’s got
some new friends, like maybe this new
guy by the north wall, and maybe he’s
telling Carl what to do; and maybe
what he’s telling Carl to do isn’t real
positive for the rest of us. I don’t know
if this has anything to do with the
larger situation in Roosing Oolvaya,
but I wouldn’t be too surprised if it did.
"So why did I come to see you? I’ve
got a lot of suspicions and real few
facts.
I do know enough about these
things to know that by the time you
have hard facts it’s usually too late.
I thought you’d be interested in the

suspicions, and I wanted to warn you
about this meeting."
"You’re right, it is interesting," Flora
said, "but I still want to know what’s
on Carl’s mind. I can take care of my-
self. I’m going to that meeting, and I’d
better leave soon, too."
"I wasn’t suggesting you shouldn’t
go.
I just wanted you to be as suspi-
cious as me.
And I wanted to know
when and where it’s going to take
place."
"All right, you warned me. The meet-
ing is at Carl’s place, in about an hour,
seven o’clock.
Carl’s boy said every-
body of any magical consequence in
town would be there." She got to her
feet.
"I’m not going to ask you what
you’re going to do now," she said point-
edly, staring sharply at me, "because I
don’t want to know and you wouldn’t
tell me, anyway. I think we’re even on

this one.
But you might think about
being careful, for a change."
I stood up and brushed the last wa-
ter off my pants.
I knew I’d gotten
one thing out of the visit, at least; I
wouldn’t have to throw out my clothes.
"You want me to ruin my reputation,
do you?" I said.
"Well, I’ll do what
I have to do, and you’ll do what you
have to do, we’ll all do what we have
to do. That’s how the world’s supposed
to work, isn’t it?" Hopefully we’d all be
doing whatever it was we were doing
for a long time yet to come, too. There
wasn’t much more to say, so Flora
let me out the large barn door in the
back and I went off down the street.
She hadn’t had a spare sword sitting
around, either, so I was trying to ﬁgure
out where I could come up with one in
the time remaining before I had to be
at Carl’s when I passed the opening to

an alley.
Nothing about the alley was distinc-
tive, but for some reason I pulled to
a halt a half-dozen paces beyond it,
turned around, and went back to have
a second look. The alley ran back from
the street between two leaning build-
ings, its only apparent features a few
piles of assorted trash.
I eased care-
fully down it, whatever had drawn me
back in the ﬁrst place pulling me on
further. All I saw was trash. Then I got
to the end, saw how the alley turned
there at an angle to proceed behind one
of the leaning buildings, and spotted
a ﬁgure with a human shape resting
in the shadows against the wall. "Hi
there," I said.
"I’d been wondering
when you’d show up again."
Gashanatantra got to his feet, lean-
ing on his walking stick, and brushed
off the back of his tweed cape.
"You

have not discovered information of use
to me," he said, rather ominously.
"You don’t like what I’m doing? Then
ﬁre me, and take your retainer back
too.
I’ve found out plenty.
I’ve been
in and out of jail once today already on
account of you, the Guard conﬁscated
a perfectly good sword, and if nobody’s
tried to beat me into the ground yet it’s
probably because they were waiting in
line for their turn to come up."
"Your outrage at having your profes-
sional competency questioned is not of
concern to me," Gash said dryly. "Re-
sults are."
"I know," I said, "I know. You told me
as much before.
Give me some more
time. I’ve got a good lead."
"This Carl Lake person?"
"Yeah, him, that’s right. He may or
may not be the one you’re after, but ei-
ther way he knows who is. If you really

wanted to be helpful, you could go over
and drag it out of him yourself.”
He chuckled. "’Front man’, I believe
the term is? That is you."
"Yeah, thanks a lot.
Let’s get seri-
ous. Tracking this barrier person down
isn’t going to be the problem. The prob-
lem’s going to be what to do when I ﬁnd
them. Just what do you expect me to
do? Capture them? Kill them? Have a
nice talk with them and convince them
to raise the barrier because I’ve got a
client who doesn’t like it?"
"I don’t know how much guidance I
can give you," he said musingly. "You
will be there, so you must use your own
instincts."
"Great. My instincts tell me not to
be there in the ﬁrst place. But suppose
I am, suppose I do what looks right to
me and then you decide that isn’t what
you wanted. It’ll be a lot harder to go

back and try again."
"I want the barrier raised," Gash
said. "I want to know who established
it, and why. I want to know if they were
aware of my presence and whether this
is an attack directed at me, and, if so,
the perpetrator must die. That is all.
The details are your business.
Now,
you must go or you will miss your ap-
pointment."
"Thanks for the help," I said, and
turned to go.
"There is one more thing." I felt
something strange happen just behind
me, something that pulled at my back
and gently tried to twist it in a couple
of directions at once like a silent baby
tornado. I peeked cautiously over my
shoulder.
In Gash’s hand, where the walking
stick had been, a small sparkling whirl-
wind the length and shape of the stick

had sprung up and was now fading.
The form it was leaving behind was
long and sharp with the colors of pure-
minted metal and glistened with the
sinuous lines of complicated etchings
and mysterious runes. "I believe you
said you needed something like this,"
Gash said. It was a sword.
My jaw was open to my chest, but I
didn’t care. I turned slowly around to
face it. I didn’t want to reach out for
the thing.
The sword was like every
last one of the most beautiful things
I’d ever imagined had suddenly been
wrapped up all in a single material ob-
ject, the gold at the end of dreams, and
here I was, being confronted with the
thing, without warning out of nowhere,
concrete and solid and genuinely real.
Jewels shone on the hilt and sparkled
like lenses on the ﬂat of the blade,
ﬂush with the metal. Hues and bright

waves washed along the surface of
what looked like steel but couldn’t
possibly be; no steel was that perfect.
"Take it," Gash said. "You were looking
for one, and you’re going to be late."
"Ulp," I said, but somehow I man-
aged to stick out my hand.
"Grasp it here, like this," said Gash,
moving his hand back on the hilt and
leaving room for my ﬁngers.
As my
skin neared the sword, sparks leapt
between my palm and the hilt. A force
took hold of my hand and inverted it,
trying to contort it into a small ﬂat ball.
I gritted my teeth and gave a short
lunge, my ﬁngers wrapped around the
hilt, and with a last audible spark and
sharp sting the sword settled into my
grip.
"From the matching of auras, my
metabolism to yours, it will know you."
Gash released his hold. The sword was

alive in my hand, trying to ﬂip me over
and bash me against the wall. I set my
feet and concentrated on keeping my
balance.
"Thanks," I said, for once meaning it.
At the moment, the problem of what
Gash was making me do and being
thrown in jail and me probably ﬁnding
some nasty way to get myself killed
before the evening was out seemed not
to matter.
As I stood there, though,
ﬁghting that stunning sword, I real-
ized that, dazzling though it was, I
wouldn’t be able to keep hold of it and
even walk at the same time. "Is there
any convenient way of putting this
thing away?" I asked him.
"Remember this word," Gash said,
and spoke something in one of the
tongue-twisting
ancient
languages.
The sword seemed to writhe in my
hand, waves of radiating power trying

to mash my arm down to bone pulp,
and then suddenly it was a walking
stick again.
The emanations were
gone.
I tried the word. Nothing happened.
Gash pronounced it again, slowly, em-
phasizing each syllable. I tried it again,
and this time I was rewarded by a
biting shock that numbed my arm
halfway to the elbow.
"Don’t insult it," Gash said. "Monoch
is fairly intelligent for a sword."
"Sorry," I muttered, climbing back to
my feet. I closed my eyes and concen-
trated, then said the word. My hand
holding the walking stick vibrated and
grew hot, and with a ﬁery sensation
as if the skin on my ﬁngers was being
peeled back to my wrist, the outline of
the stick ﬂowed like molten iron pour-
ing into a sword-shaped mold and the
form of the sword was back. I quickly

said the word again. The condensing
sword paused, almost exasperated it
seemed, heaved a metallic sigh, and
again subsided into its traveling form.
"It is not necessary to fully vocalize
the word," Gash told me.
"You can
mouth it silently and Monoch will hear.
Now go."
“Right," I said. I turned away and I
made my way back to the street, leav-
ing him there behind the building, and
headed off toward Carl Lake’s place. I
would certainly be called to account for
anything that happened to his sword,
so I was treating the walking stick gin-
gerly; who knew how strong the thing
was when it was in disguise. Still, with
a sword like this one I could get out
of some pretty tight spots. Of course,
with a sword like this one I’d have
more of a tendency to get myself into
those spots in the ﬁrst place.
Hope-

fully if the situation came to it, I’d
actually be able to keep my feet and
swing Monoch at the same time.
I’d
deal with that if I had to, but overall I
ﬁgured my chances had gone up. Now
a decent bookie might only laugh for
a quarter-hour before taking a bet on
me.
I approached Carl’s house from two
streets behind, trying to make every
sense I might have act alert.
As I
moved in, maybe I was starting to feel
an odd sensation in my stomach, or
maybe it was just that hadn’t eaten all
day.
The closer I got, though, the
stronger the feeling grew,
like my
stomach was circling the outermost
currents of a whirlpool. What are you
up to, Carl? I thought.
The ends of the half-timbers stuck
out from the wall of the building just
behind Carl’s and one to the side.
I

stuck the walking stick down the back
of my tunic and climbed up the timbers
three stories to the roof. The roof had
gables and came to a shingled peak,
unusual for Roosing Oolvaya, but I
found a rain gutter and edged along
it around to the back.
Carl Lake’s
second-ﬂoor lodgings came into view,
lamplight clearly shining through the
translucent hides covering his street-
front solarium. Shapes moved within.
From my position I had the advan-
tage of height, but I wanted better. I
dropped gently onto the rear of Carl’s
roof and moved closer in a slow crouch.
The entrance I’d used in my visit that
morning opened on the Street of Fresh
Breeze, and it was from this street that
I now heard the approach of a small
party of people, and then the rapping
of a ﬁst on the door. The shadow in the
solarium moved again and vanished.

I had taken cover behind a double-
barreled chimney and withdrawn the
small knife from my boot, and now I
crawled quickly up to the solarium roof,
slashed a small hole in the hide at a
spot screened by the shadow of a palm
tree within the room, and stretched
myself out ﬂat. I applied my eye to the
hole.
The solarium proper occupied the
ﬂoor below me, so I was looking down
on it from a position above the heads
of any standing occupants. The fronds
of the palm spread out in front of my
eyehole, but I could see around their
edges into most of the corners of the
room.
The room at the moment was
empty. I got the walking stick out of
my shirt and arranged it next to me,
with one hand on the handle just in
case.
A clumping of boots on stairs
grew, and a small party ﬁled into the

solarium from the staircase at the far
end.
Carl Lake himself led the pack, fol-
lowed by a half-dozen or so magicians.
I knew Flora, of course, and I’d dealt
with Rounga and Italio Ignachi from
time to time, but I recognized some
of the others as well.
They settled
themselves around the furniture and
Carl’s servant entered with a tray of
tea and ﬁnger refreshments:
small
cakes and smoked ﬁsh on crackers. I
could have used some of them myself.
I told my stomach to shut up; we were
on a case.
There was another knock
from the street, the servant descended
the stairs and returned with another
small group, they took their share of
the tea and cakes, and then Carl got
back to his feet and started to talk.
"You are wondering why this meet-
ing, yes, why have I asked you here.

Surely nothing of much import could
happen here in our small, peaceful city
of Roosing Oolvaya, hm?
"Sadly this is not the case." He
clasped his hands behind his back
and started to pace. There was some-
thing strange about that, but I couldn’t
immediately identify what it was. "All
of you are certainly aware of Kaar and
the, hm, related political developments,
and may have indeed speculated upon
them. What may still be news is that
the maneuverings of politics have been
joined by similar activities in our own
ﬁeld.
Perhaps the developments in
our ﬁeld were indeed the primary, and
Kaar himself merely a manifestation.
Shall I be concrete, hm? Have any one
of you had need to leave the city in the
past day? No? Then, yes, you do not
know. There is now a barrier around
our city."

A hum of conversation arose, then
quickly quieted as Carl waited.
My
stomach had begun to lurch again, but
now it didn’t feel like I was hungry.
That whirlpool sensation I’d gotten as
I approached was back, and it was
getting worse.
"This barrier," Carl continued, "rep-
resents
the
application
of
extreme
power;
I have examined it myself.
It is similar to one described by Isk-
endarian in his text on intruder pro-
tection, some of you may be familiar
with it. Certain other unusual emana-
tions have appeared as well, clustered
around the north city wall. It seems a
new power has appeared in our midst."
I blinked. A dark mist, so thin it was
all but invisible, was creeping along
the walls of the room below.
When I
looked at it, my stomach rang alarm
bells.
The haze was perfectly trans-

parent, lending just a hint of black to
whatever was behind it, but it wasn’t
my imagination.
It was really there,
and it was spreading out to surround
everyone in the room.
"When confronted with a new or-
der, what should we do, each of us?
Could we resist, hm? Perhaps ﬂee? Or
perhaps be passive, patient, yes, wait-
ing to see, and with the potential of
absorbing for ourselves whatever bene-
ﬁts may accrue? Or perhaps . . . " Carl
glanced around.
"Perhaps we under-
stand the implications, and establish
the only appropriate new allegiance."
Now no one was saying anything. In
fact, Carl was the only person who was
even moving.
They were all covered,
every last one of them except Carl and
his servant, by that sinister black mist.
I tightened my grip on the walking
stick.

"You have no discussion, hm? Later,
perhaps, we will discuss.
For now,"
Carl said, in a new forceful note, "you
are present to hear the way things are,
yes, the ways things are.
Then per-
haps you will have a choice to make.
Of course, hm, perhaps you will not.
"I would ask you to rise, but as you
will now surely be aware, yes, you are
indeed immobilized, hm? We will thus
sadly omit the formalities." He stood
up straight,
straight as a training
sergeant, and the kink in his gimpy leg
was straight and true as an arrowed
bullseye. That’s what I’d missed, and
what I thought I’d seen when I’d fol-
lowed him before. The limp was gone.
"These manifestations, yes, every-
one, have in common the association
with a particular individual.
Fellow
colleagues, I now give you the new,
true master of Roosing Oolvaya."

Right below my vantage point, a
door opened. A form stepped through
it into the room.
His head was be-
low mine and he wore a dark cloak,
but at the mere sight of him my stom-
ach spun over into the heart of the
whirlpool and my balance reeled. The
dark mist clung to him, too, but more
than that, it wheeled about him in
gleeful billowing gales. That was his
aura, I realized suddenly, and I didn’t
know how I knew it but I’d hopefully
be able to worry about that later. The
aura was feeding off the magicians in
the room, probably off me too.
That
wasn’t all.
From the same depth of
perception that let me see these sights
and understand them, at least in part,
came another dreadful fact.
There’s that old saying, “What you
don’t know can’t hurt you.’” Well, I’d
always known it was wrong, I had a

nasty habit of ending up in situations
where exactly the opposite applied, but
I hadn’t until that moment appreciated
just how bad it could get. Not know-
ing something existed, not knowing it
could exist, was not going to protect
me one bit.
I hadn’t known what I’d
have to face, hadn’t even known it was
a physical possibility, but now that
was so much crying in the wind. That
wasn’t just some magician down there.
The black ﬁgure in the room below was
Death.
The ﬁgure spoke.
"I am Oskin
Yahlei," it said.

Chapter10
SHAA AND MONT
GO BOATING
“I DON’T KNOW ABOUT THIS,”
Mont said.
"The amount of preparation goes in
direct proportion to the length of the
boat desired."
"The length of the boat."
"Yea," Shaa said,
"at the water-

line. Now, be quiet. This is perfectly
straightforward."
Jurtan Mont looked at the new knife
in his hand, and the iron bar in Shaa’s.
A muscle in his neck sent lancing pains
up toward his ear whenever he moved;
they’d been hunched over behind the
crate on a quiet stretch of wharf for the
last half-hour. Waiting for the Guard.
This guy is crazy, Mont thought.
Shaa, for his part, was right at home,
having spent a signiﬁcant portion of
his life hunched over under similar
circumstances.
In this kind of opera-
tion he would have preferred to drop
unexpectedly from above, but taking
into account the limited experience of
his new colleague a simpler and less
ﬂashy plan had seemed appropriate.
Still - suddenly Shaa felt a nudge in
his side.
Mont, barely visible in the
dim splashes of light from a lantern

gently swaying from its bracket on the
wall of a nearby warehouse, pointed
down the wharf. Shaa held up two ﬁn-
gers and waggled them interrogatively.
Mont nodded.
Shaa produced three
largish pebbles, took aim, and tossed.
The rocks landed some yards to the
side along the wharf, one-two-three,
sounding to the suspicious ear just
like three hurried, somewhat stealthy
footsteps.
Mont
grasped
his
knife
gingerly
around the guard and reversed it, pre-
senting the hilt. The familiar rattle of
cuirasses and running men became au-
dible over the splat of river swells, then
increased. Two Guardsmen burst into
sight around the corner of the crate.
They paused, looking away toward the
source of the spectral footsteps. Shaa
swung his bar. The second Guardsman
heard a mufﬂed "clunk" mixed with the

clang of ringing metal, wheeled, saw a
glinting streak as Mont’s knife hurtled
hilt-ﬁrst past his nose, blinked, opened
his mouth, and went for his sword.
Shaa let the bar continue its follow-
through, using its angular momentum
to help throw himself forward, half-
leapt, half-fell over the subsiding form
of the ﬁrst Guardsman, and slammed
ﬁst-ﬁrst into the second. The man ex-
haled forcefully as Shaa compressed
his chest; then he fell roughly to the
deck,
quivered brieﬂy,
and relaxed.
Shaa bashed the man’s head on the
planks once more for good measure,
stood up, dusted off his hands, and
retrieved the bar. "Good balance," he
said, hefting the bar. "One must never
overlook
a
promising
rubbish-heap.
You wouldn’t believe some of the useful
things people just toss away."
"Why are we doing this?" Mont said.

"We could easily have avoided these
guys."
"When we arrive at the palace,"
Shaa
said,
fastidiously
wiping
off
the bar, "we’re going to want a dis-
guise.
Since nobody knows all of
these Guardsmen anyway - you get
the idea?"
"Uh, yeah, but why waste the time
now? We could have been in the palace
already. I’m sure they’ve got plenty of
Guard in there."
Shaa raised an eyebrow.
"Indeed.
However, when we get there, I imagine
we may be rather busy - here, give me
a hand.
The cuirasses buckle at the
shoulder and under the arms."
"How much of this stuff do we need?"
Mont said, fumbling in the gloom.
"Cuirass,
sword-belt,
and
jerkin.
The rest isn’t standard;
it looks to
be what each man was wearing when

they signed up.
You’ve got the same
kind of leggings anyway, so you should
do ﬁne.”
They worked in silence, punctuated
by grunts from Mont.
"This thing doesn’t ﬁt," he said ﬁ-
nally.
"They never do.” Shaa, however, due
to his previous experience, had had
the foresight to choose the Guardsman
closest to his own size. One of the men
groaned and stirred.
"Aren’t we going to do something to
them?" Mont said, looking around.
"You’re welcome to roll them into
the river if you want," Shaa said, his
voice now some distance away. "I tend
to choose the path of forbearance, on
the grounds that we live in a world full
with enough casual violence as it is.
One should remember that these men
are not necessarily evil, just Guards,

which is a job, not a predilection. Ah,
here we are." His shape rematerialized
at Mont’s side. Mont jumped, his new
cuirass rattling.
"This, I believe, is
yours?" A shard of light became Mont’s
knife, balancing neatly on its point in
the center of Shaa’s palm.
"Thanks," Mont said.
He grabbed
the knife and slid it into his belt on
the opposite hip from his sword. "If we
don’t throw them in the river, what’s
the alternative?"
Clang. Clang. Shaa replaced the bar
in his belt. "By the time they wake up
we’ll be on the island. Come on."
The wharves occupied most of the
long east-facing curve of Roosing Oolvay
riverfront, jutting out into the slack
current, pulling back, winding around
artiﬁcial pools and coves.
Hundreds
of vessels rocked at their moorings
against the wharves or in the con-

fusion of cheaper spots just offshore,
vessels ranging in size from dinghies
up to the massive cargo-hauling river
barges.
Here and there a light twin-
kled in a cabin or a lantern picked out
the dim spiderspins of rigging. The air
was quiet, though, lacking the usual
ﬂoating strains of river melodies and
the lilt of harsh voices raised in strife.
"This one," Shaa announced, staring
over the edge of the wharf.
"Why that one?"
"Are you going to be difﬁcult again?"
"But - it’s tiny!"
"You were perhaps expecting the
Venerable Yacht?
We don’t want to
attract attention, while on the other
hand we don’t want to get swamped.
Observe the relatively high gunwales."
Actually, Shaa had considered as a pos-
sibility stowing away on the Venerable
Yacht, but the scheduling had proved

inconvenient.
The twin uprights of a ladder poked
skyward at the edge of the wharf. Shaa
indicated the ladder with a hand, Mont
descended, and Shaa picked his way
carefully after him. The bottom rungs
were coated with slime, and led to a
small platform ﬂoating at the base and
a boat moored to the platform.
The
swells went slap-slap-slap against the
side of the boat. "Go ahead," said Shaa.
"Get in."
The boat in question was apparently
used for local net ﬁshing and the tend-
ing of crustacean pots. Its length was
three fathoms, or a little less, but it
was narrow enough in beam for one
person to handle the pair of oars amid-
ships. The gunwales were indeed high,
matching Shaa’s requirements;
the
state of the river was somewhat agi-
tated. "Shaa," Mont said, "there’s some

very scummy water in the bottom of
this thing."
"It’s called ’bilge’," Shaa said, casting
off the stern line and proceeding along
the wharf toward the bow. "Everything
has a name." He released the bow line,
tossed it into the boat, and stepped gin-
gerly after it. "In fact, scummy bilge is
a good sign; that means the water has
been sitting there for a long time."
"So?"
"No, don’t sit there, sit in the bow.
The front." Shaa arranged himself be-
tween the oars, facing aft.
The boat
rocked as Mont lurched forward.
"If
the water has been stagnating there for
weeks, that would mean the boat has
not been leaking. "
“Oh," Mont said. "That’s good."
"Indeed. Now, I will row, and you’re
going to guide and fend. Push off."
Mont leaned over, shoving at the

nearest piling. The prow spun slowly
toward the river.
Shaa craned his
neck around, sighted down past the
end of the wharf, and began to paddle.
The boat moved tentatively ahead and
nosed out into the current.
"I think there’s something up ahead,
big," Mont said.
Shaa looked around
again. "I see it," he said. "Now keep
your voice down." Shaa backed water
with the starboard oar, then stroked
carefully.
The boat proceeded along
a hulking wall festooned with fresh-
water barnacles, edged around an an-
chor chain leading silently off into the
darkness, and regained course.
"Uh - I think it’s open now.”
"Good." Shaa checked; Mont’s assess-
ment had been accurate. "Do you see
the palace? The second island from the
left?"
"Yes, I see it.
I know where the

palace is."
"We will steer thirty degrees to port,
to compensate for the current. That’s
the left."
"I knew that."
"Indeed," Shaa said.
He rowed,
grunting occasionally.
Between the
swells and the current the outing was
fairly strenuous. Probably a storm up-
river someplace, Shaa thought. Things
could be worse.
Mont looked back toward the shore.
The ground level rose gently as one re-
treated through the city away from the
river, so rank after rank of rooftops and
protruding upper stories ascended into
the distance, lit by the patchy orange
glow of torchlights. The black shadows
of barges swayed uneasily in the fore-
ground. Their boat was swaying too, in
two axes, not only side-to-side but for-
ward and back as well. Mont began to

hear, faintly, the nasal honk of a dis-
tant foghorn. "Uh, Shaa?" Mont said.
"I’m not feeling too good."
’Are you seasick, or -"
"Do you hear a foghorn?"
"No indeed."
"Then I’m starting to synchronize. I
think it’s the way these waves are hit-
ting the boat." Clouds of ﬂuffy white
were moving in from the corners of his
vision.
"Don’t fade now," Shaa said. "Here.
You row for a while; it will give you
something else to concentrate on."
"If we had a sorcerer," Mont said
weakly, "we wouldn’t have to row."
"If we had a sorcerer what you would
have to worry about would be much
more serious." Shaa shipped oars and
moved to the bow.
Mont eased reluc-
tantly past him.
"Stroke," Shaa said.

Mont’s learning curve was steep.
They spent several minutes moving
up its curve before they straightened
out, again on course.
The island of
the palace of the Venerance slowly ap-
proached.
The river gurgled around
them.
"We’re - getting there," Mont panted.
"What do we - do when we - get there?"
"As we have done to date - improvise.
More starboard oar, please. See, isn’t
that better? I’ll take over in a moment.
How well do you know the palace? The
island, too, for that matter."
"I know - how to get - to the dun-
geons - if I start - in the right place."
"And the secret passages?”
“What - secret passages?"
"Every palace has secret passages.
Especially those with dungeons."
"I thought - you said - you’d ﬁnd
them."

"I had thought you might be able to
help save some time."
“If you - can ﬁnd them - I’ll be glad
- to use them." Mont fell silent, except
for the sound of loud gasping.
Shaa glowered back at him.
"Per-
haps I’d best take over now," he said.
"I’d hate to have to stop right in the
midst of everything interesting be-
cause my aide-de-camp had gone into
heart
failure."
Mont
gratefully
re-
leased the oars and fell over.
The
boat twisted in the current and began
to move south.
Shaa clambered over
Mont onto the oar bench, dipped a
hand over the side, and splashed water
in Mont’s face. Mont sputtered; Shaa
rowed.
Mont gradually recovered his breath
and struggled back to the bow.
He
looked ahead at the approaching is-
land.
"Where are we going to land?

This is the side with the docks and the
beaches, but it’ll probably be loaded
with guards."
"There is little ’probably’ involved.
You forget, however, that we are also
guards." Shaa rattled his cuirass.
"Yes, but, landing from the river in a
snapper-boat?"
"That is a very good point," Shaa
said, pleased.
"You are acquiring a
sense for details. If we cannot land on
this most convenient side, then, what
about the others?"
"Well, there’s rock, cliffs, walls, that
kind of thing."
“Indeed," said Shaa. "How climbable
are they?"
"They’re not supposed to be climbable
at all."
"Umm." Shaa thought about it, steer-
ing against the current to the north of
the island in the meantime. Finally he

said, "Let us have a look at the north
wall."
The island was still ahead, but it
was beginning to slip around to their
right. Atop the rocks and curtain walls
were the lights of torches and watch-
ﬁres, casting splashes of red and yellow
across the towers and crenellations.
The building was a palace primarily by
convention, having started life as the
local Imperial garrison keep centuries
before, in the time of a greater empire.
The fortiﬁcations had been designed
to resist a large-scale assault, and
had indeed successfully done this sev-
eral times over the years. Still, Mont
thought, a few hand-picked, highly
trained,
supremely
motivated
men
might . . .
Mont stopped himself.
It
wouldn’t help to treat this thing like it
was just another adventure story.
While Mont daydreamed, Shaa con-

sidered logistics.
First, they would have to land the
boat. Second, climb the wall and get
into the palace complex. Third, act un-
obtrusive long enough to sidle undis-
covered into the dungeons.
Fourth,
free the prisoners. The right prisoners,
Shaa amended sourly, remembering
an annoying exploit that had come to
involve an axe-murderer some years
before. Fifth and subsequent, no doubt
overpower the troops, overthrow Kaar,
and overcome the inevitable apathy
of the populace. By then, it should at
least be time for breakfast.
"We’re getting pretty close," Mont
said.
Shaa glanced to his left as he faced
the stern of the boat, at the long sweep
of shadowed wall now immediately
downstream, and surveyed its height.
The shadows were surmounted sixty

or seventy feet above the water by an
abrupt line of twinkling torchlights
and the shifting forms of men, the line
broken by silhouettes of catapults and
troughs for boiling oil. Water foamed
a faint glowing blue at the base of the
rock. “Look there,” Shaa said.
Just ahead of their position, a nar-
row bar of sediment protruded from
the tip of the island, built up by the cur-
rent behind a lee in the rocks. "That?"
Mont squeaked. "You’ve got to be -"
"Quiet," Shaa said.
"Please." The
spot would be big enough for the boat,
barely, but only if the boat could be
made to arrive there.
Shaa angled
the prow and dipped with one oar,
and the current propelled the boat in
roughly the right direction. The noise
of the water increased: waves crashed
against the rocks on both sides.
The
boat bounced. Again the boat leaped,

something grated under Mont’s feet,
the wood vibrating angrily, the bow
rose up and came down on a rock, tim-
bers boomed and splintered, and then
another wave lifted the keel cleanly
and set the boat down on the beach.
Mont fell over the aide and clutched
weakly at the cracked prow.
It came
away in his hand. "Augh," Mont said
in a thin voice. "You - you - how lucky
can you expect to -"
"Skill, my friend," Shaa said distract-
edly. He was standing on a log protrud-
ing from the packed gravel, looking up
at the rocks and the wall.
"But the boat - it’ll never sail again.
How are we going to get -"
"You did plan to free prisoners, yes?
Perhaps deal with Kaar in the bargain?
Obviously the route of our departure
would be different."
"Ah," Mont said, "ah, obviously, of

course. Ah, what now, then?" He tilted
his head back, too; the rocks went up-
ward at an angle that approximated
the vertical.
Water splashed around
his ankles.
Shaa brushed spray from his eyes
and squinted.
"There,
look there.
Halfway
up and
somewhat
to
the
right."
Then Mont saw it too - a small area
of the cliff face splashed with a gentle
orange glow.
The glow did not come
from the battlements above.
"A window,"• Shaa said, "of some
type." From under his cloak, shrugging
off a shoulder strap, Shaa produced a
leather bag the length of his arm. He
undid the thong at one end and with-
drew a squared-off cylinder of wood
bound with metal bands and other
attachments. Several smaller parts fol-
lowed. Shaa swung two supports out

from the sides of the cylinder, and its
form became apparent.
"A crossbow?" Mont said.
"Indeed." Shaa placed the butt end
against the log embedded in the ground,
snapped out a small pedal on the un-
derside of the body, now several feet in
the air, positioned his foot on the pedal,
and stood up on it.
With a smooth
metallic whine, barely audible over
the crash of the river swells, the pedal
sank slowly down.
"The mechanism
works, I believe, on an armature of
nested springs." Shaa again consulted
the leather bag, which now yielded a
lumpy arrow and a reel of thin cord.
“Observe," he said.
He clipped a fas-
tener from the cord to the arrow’s
trailing end, held the arrow in front
of the ﬂetching, and struck its blunt
point sharply against the remains of
the boat. With a sharp "sproing", half-

a-dozen rods snapped outward from
the front half of the arrow to stick out
radially from the tip, like spokes. Shaa
displayed the grapnel, then folded the
hinged arms back against the shaft
and engaged the locking device.
"That’s the most improbable thing
I’ve ever seen," Mont said incredu-
lously, "but it’s never going to hold our
weight. We’re both gonna die."
"Prepare to be surprised," Shaa said
dryly.
"The fabricator specializes in
such devices.
He has a remarkable
obsession with the mechanical."
"What friend is this one?"
"Max," Shaa said, "the same Max."
The same one who’d taught Shaa
his fencing? That sounded pretty far-
fetched, but so did most everything
Shaa said.
Mont decided Shaa must
be testing him again in some weird
way. He ﬁgured he’d better be noncom-

mittal. "This Max guy sure must get
around."
"Yes, he does at that." Shaa had now
attached the reel of line to a socket at
the butt end of the crossbow and care-
fully seated the arrow within its guides.
He backed out along the log to the edge
of the lapping water, raised the cross-
bow, sighted down the mark at the
brighter spot in the cliff, and sprung
the catch. The arrow lunged out, the
reel of cord humming busily behind it,
and disappeared into the rocks. Shaa
had cocked his head to listen, and now
he nodded with satisfaction. "I will go
ﬁrst," he said.
"Where? How do you know where it
is? How do you know the thing’s even
holding?"
"All I ask is some modicum of trust,"
Shaa said testily.
He collapsed the
crossbow and stowed it in its bag, slung

the bag back under his cloak, and put
his weight on the cord.
The cord held.
Rocks reared their
jagged edges invisibly in the darkness.
Shaa, wary of fraying, kept the rope
high. Several person-heights above the
river the jagged rocks became large
stones set more neatly together, and
the climb evened out.
Shaa pulled
vertically with his arms and walked
up the stones with his feet. The glow,
its location and distance uncertain in
the dark, drew closer, and then was
suddenly abreast.
The arrow had gone through the in-
terlaced iron bars protecting a small
square ventilation hole, springing the
grapnel against the wall of the shaft
within.
Torchlight ﬂickered up the
shaft.
Shaa, looking through it, saw
that it slanted down to meet a corridor.
It would be a squeeze, but should be

passable. He found a piton, wedged it
into a space between the stones above
the hole, and belayed the cord around
it, removing his weight from the grap-
nel.
The grapnel was well-made and
he certainly trusted Max, but it was
better all around not to push things to
their limit.
Again fumbling beneath
his cloak, Shaa with a small grunt of
satisfaction produced the bladder of
the small southern amphibian he had
employed to such effect earlier, in their
escape from the Bilious Gnome, and
squirted foaming liquid on the iron
bars. Shaa held his breath. The liquid
hissed. The grating sagged, tilted, and
swung free to dangle from Shaa’s cord,
caught at the end of the grapnel.
Shaa lowered the grating into the
shaft, then followed it.
The squeeze
was indeed tight, but not nearly as bad
as such things sometimes were. The in-

cline was fortunately not steep. Mont
appeared at the window and ﬂopped
headﬁrst over the edge. "You do this
sort of stuff for fun?" he whispered.
"Why, don’t you like it?" Shaa said
distractedly. "Quiet." He pushed him-
self further and slid down to the shaft’s
outlet. The corridor below was silent.
Shaa eased his head out of the shaft
and glanced quickly around.
The corridor ran parallel to the outer
wall, then angled back into the inte-
rior of the castle.
Dust was thick on
the narrow ﬂoor. The torchlight they
had glimpsed outside was still little
more than a orange glow, though it
was brighter at the turning on the left.
Shaa dropped to the ﬂoor and came up
in a crouch, his hand on his rapier.
Nothing stirred.
"Well, you know
this palace," Shaa whispered back into
the shaft.
"Which direction do we

take?"
Mont, who had been getting tired
of being scrunched uncomfortably up
the shaft behind Shaa, appeared in
the opening, then lost his balance and
slid free.
Shaa caught him with an
arm and managed to lower him sound-
lessly to the ﬂoor. Mont shook his head,
cocked it to one side, closed his eyes,
and appeared to listen.
It occurred
to Shaa that Mont had probably been
doing the same thing in the shaft, thus
distracting himself enough to make
him lose his hold. Still, it was entirely
possible that whatever inner tunes he
was hearing might indeed make his
distraction worthwhile. Mont chewed
his lip and opened his eyes; they were
vague and unfocussed.
"I think it’s better on the right,
away from the light," Jurtan Mont
said. "Let’s go right."

Shaa ﬁnished stowing the grapnel,
loosened the iron bar in his belt, and
headed down the corridor to the right.

Chapter11
THE CURSE OF
THE CREEPING
SWORD
“I AM OSKIN YAHLEI,” he said.
The dark ﬁgure in the dark cloak, its
hood thrown back across his shoulders,
looked slowly and deliberately around
the room, ﬁxing each person there with

his glare.
The currents of the black
aura pulsed and wove in the air like
spun smoke.
He didn’t gaze upward
through the palm tree at me, in fact
seemed not to recognize my presence,
and I kept very still, wishing I could
even stop breathing. A heavy gold ring
glittered on the middle ﬁnger of his left
hand. The ring, in fact, made me think
of the eye of a hurricane: the eddies
and twirls of the mist seemed to circle
around it, looping, streaming, billow-
ing about in swirling coils. Somehow,
in a strange way I didn’t understand,
that black swirling aura seemed more
bound to the ring than to the rest of
Oskin Yahlei himself.
I didn’t care how this insight had
gotten into my memory, whether I was
tapping the outskirts of Gash’s mind
or what; I was just trying to ransack
whatever I did know as quickly as I

could. Me, I couldn’t see an aura if it
smashed me in the nose, and even if
I could see it I wouldn’t know what it
was, but since Gash had pushed me
into this mess in the ﬁrst place I had
no qualms about using his knowledge
to help get me out of it.
Get me out
of it alive, that is, a remark that all of
a sudden had a lot more gut meaning
than it had ever pulled up before.
Even in a time and place where the
gods are real personages, and they
show up on earth in the ﬂesh to give
people trouble directly, without inter-
mediary, you’ve got to make a distinc-
tion between the actual and the mythic.
Not everything you can think of is real,
even if a lot of weird things happen
to be.
I’d always thought Death was
a concept and a state, not an indepen-
dent entity.
Unfortunately, based on
the information my mind was now ﬁnd-

ing hidden in its ﬁles, that impression
had been seriously wrong.
I mentioned before that human ma-
gicians aren’t all the same. They’re dif-
ferentiated by specialty, the way they
handle energy, their ethical orientation
toward the use of magic, all kinds of
distinctions. Gods specialized, too. I’d
picked that up before, but I hadn’t real-
ized how far the differences went. The
answer was, pretty far, and the Deaths
were a perfect case in point.
Something there was never a short-
age of were deaths, and nobody ever
liked to waste a ready source of power.
That was really the key. When a living
creature died, its decay to the state of
death released energy. The gods who
were Death could tap and absorb this
death-power. Pain, injury, slow dying
or fast, they all gave off this energy,
and some Death was usually around to

take advantage of it.
If passive absorption was the whole
story, who really cared; lots of phenom-
ena are more ghoulish than that. Un-
fortunately, that wasn’t all, of course.
It was only a small step from taking ad-
vantage of death to causing death, and
just a little bit further to having some
control over it too, and once you could
control death, well, you could control a
lot of life, too, couldn’t you.
The upshot was that even the rest
of the community of gods treated the
Deaths with respect, or if not respect,
at least caution.
Nobody I’d heard of knew exactly
how many gods there were; estimates
tended to range from twenty or thirty
up to a few hundred. If Gash knew, his
aura wasn’t telling, and the number
probably varied anyway.
That didn’t
matter.
What might be important to

me was the number of Deaths, maybe
a dozen. They weren’t all equal. What
the pecking order was, Gash didn’t
know, except that there was one big
boss over the rest.
I doubted if this Yahlei was the
Death Supreme himself.
I couldn’t quite see the Death’s
Death slumming around with a bunch
of pipsqueak mortals, but frankly I
didn’t think it would matter much
whether this really was The Man or
just an underling. Either way we were
talking serious big-time trouble, and
there I lay on the roof over his head
without the slightest idea of what to do
about it.
Oskin Yahlei ﬁnally ﬁxed his gaze
back on Carl Lake. Yahlei looked male
enough in aspect, although for all I
knew that was just a matter of affecta-
tion. "These are the best ones in your

city?" Oskin Yahlei said.
"These are the only ones in the city,"
Carl said, "You said you -"
"I know what I said." Yahlei walked
out into the room, and as the angle
changed I saw that he was wearing a
black eyepatch over his left eye.
He
ﬁngered it with his hand, the hand
with the ring. When the ring passed
near the patch, the covering over his
eye seemed to grow slightly transpar-
ent, with the ghostly shadow of skin
and eye socket and swollen tissue seen
dimly behind it. He lowered the hand
and the image faded.
My own right hand was quivering. I
glanced down at it.
The walking stick had begun to vi-
brate, and if I listened closely I could
hear a low whine. A shock stabbed up
through my palm. "Shut up," I hissed
at it, trying not to vocalize.
"You’ll

give us away." The nebulous image of
the sword was now visible around the
stick, twirling and churning. "I’ll call
you when I need you," I added. Reluc-
tantly the shape faded and the whine
died, but my hand still felt like it was
clutching something alive, like maybe
the tail of a large, impatient jungle cat.
Carl Lake had turned to follow the
Death as he’d moved.
Oskin Yahlei
scrutinized him.
"Your friend, Lake,
has assured me you are all reasonably
intelligent," he said, still eyeing Carl
but speaking now to the frozen crowd.
"If that is true, you will have realized
that resistance would be impractical.
It will also not have escaped notice
that your active collaboration with me
could beneﬁt you signiﬁcantly. Observe
Lake, now considering a new career in
gymnastics and contortions."
"Indeed,
yes,
Master," Carl Lake

said, "my leg." He ﬂexed it, raising it
to his cheas, then did a knee bend.
Oskin Yahlei frowned. “The demon-
stration is appropriate, that ’Master’
business is not. I told you I’m looking
for responsible assistants, not toadies."
Carl gave a quick nod and bow, prob-
ably to disguise how white his face had
suddenly gone. "As you wish it."
"Indeed," Yahlei said, "yes. As you
will also have suspected, your Roosing
Oolvaya represents the ﬁrst in a series
of steps I intend to take. I will need
deputies of power and knowledge to
stand with me.
Their power will in-
crease and they will grow in stature,
becoming aides, viceroys, governors.
Perhaps -" He paused,
turned and
looked around the faces again.
"Per-
haps even more,"
Huh? I thought. (It really was my
own mind thinking, for a change.) The

whole world had heard legends about
people who became gods, long ago and
on some other continent, but it had
never happened to anybody anyone
knew. If what Oskin Yahlei was imply-
ing was true, though, it was possible,
and he could arrange it. Even if they
didn’t know he was a god, they might
think he was powerful enough to do
it. On the other hand, he could just be
using the hint as sucker bait.
But I knew his audience, and I knew
that with that one tantalizing insinua-
tion he’d caught some of them.
My options were shrinking, not that
they’d been wonderful to begin with. I
could burst through the roof with the
temperamental sword whirling and try
to cut Oskin Yahlei down before he had
a chance to blast me. If I was going to
try that, I’d have to hope for a hand
from the crowd, and at the moment

I thought some of them would rather
side with him over me. The best I could
hope for under that scenario would be
the magicians ﬁghting among them-
selves. It was also possible that even
a distracted Yahlei wouldn’t drop his
hold on them, and might even decide
to drain one or two magicians for their
quick energy ﬁx.
I could throw the
sword and maybe manage to skewer
him. I could also just keep on watching.
If he left, I might be able to trail him
home and take him by surprise, away
from potential allies. "Don’t worry," I
told the sword, suddenly restive again,
"I’ll feed you, I’ll feed you. Be patient."
"On the other hand," Oskin Yahlei
went on, "there is a another potential
way to proceed.
I can simply crush
and absorb you. Any one of you." His
one-eyed gaze settled on a small man
on the settee. I didn’t know him. "You,

perhaps." The black aura intensiﬁed
around the guy, seemed to settle into
his skin, his eyes opened wide and
the eyeballs rolled up behind his lids,
cords stood out in his exposed throat,
and without making a sound, he be-
gan to shrink inward like a collapsing
wineskin. He turned sideways and slid
to the ﬂoor, his muscles limp and di-
minishing. The colors of his own aura
appeared, ﬂowing out of his skin like
shattering shards of glass, colors glint-
ing and gone as they disappeared into
the black.
At the right limit of my vision, half
hidden behind a palm frond, I glimpsed
a sudden quiver of motion.
One of
the other magicians in back of Oskin
Yahlei was raising an arm. I couldn’t
see who it was, only the slowly lifting
arm, but I did abruptly see that the
misty black coating on that side of the

room had decreased, probably with
Oskin Yahlei’s diversion of effort. The
walking stick started to hum. "No!" I
thought at it, and then another idea
I hadn’t considered popped into my
mind. "Let’s try this one, Monoch."
How had I done whatever I’d done
before, in the jail cage?
COLLAPSE,
I thought, concentrating at the ﬂoor of
the solarium. The guy next to the set-
tee now resembled a rotten gourd with
the insides being sucked out of it. COL-
LAPSE! "Come on here," I muttered at
the sword, "give me a hand."
The arm of the magician behind the
palm tree was gradually coming into
line with Oskin Yahlei’s back. I didn’t
know if the sword understood what I
was trying and had my doubts whether
it could help even if it did, but for some
reason my projected concentration be-
gan to sharpen and gain force, like

an image through a spyglass brought
suddenly into focus.
COLLAPSE! I
thought,
my
whole
mind
wrapped
around the reality of the boards peel-
ing back beneath Yahlei’s feet to ﬂing
him deep down into the earth.
Os-
kin Yahlei’s black aura had intensiﬁed
with the transfusion of fresh energy
and the ring on his hand was glowing.
He smacked his lips, then kicked the
shrunken heap on the ﬂoor.
"That is
the alternative," he said in a conversa-
tional tone.
"I give you all your own
free choice. Join me or -"
Green
lines
had
begun
to
form
around the outstretched hand of the
magician behind Oskin Yahlei. Oskin
Yahlei, still talking, had started to
turn. Abruptly he froze, his brow fur-
rowed, he looked up to scrutinize the
ceiling, his gaze tracking across the
solarium hides toward my eyehole be-

hind the palm tree, the tracers of green
in the magician’s hand grew together,
I thought COLLAPSE, GODDAMMIT!
as vividly as I could, and -
The building shuddered.
Below in
the solarium, a lamp on an ornate
pedestal tipped over, spraying burning
oil across the far wall.
Oskin Yahlei
took one step, the ﬂoor snapped up
and hit his descending foot, and he
dropped to one knee. Part of the roof
right behind me fell in. A ﬁery green
construct that looked like a set of ﬂy-
ing meat hooks with smoke coming out
the back zoomed over Oskin Yahlei’s
head, banked just shy of the wall, and
headed around for another pass. The
building was groaning with the sound
of grinding wood and disintegrating
joints but the crowd in the room was
still silent.
Then the roof bounced
again like someone had walloped the

house with part of a small mountain,
and as I looked back over my shoulder
I was just in time to see the back of
the building behind me, the one a ﬂoor
taller than Carl Lake’s, detach itself
from the rest of the structure, pause
in mid-air, and surge toward me to col-
lapse with full force against the house
I was on.
A chimney hurtled over my head
and plowed through the solarium’s
hide roof.
The hide ripped, a section
of the canvas that had burst out in
ﬂames from the spilled lamp oil fell
away over the side of the wall, and
the whole building started to reel out
over the Street of Fresh Breeze.
I
spread myself ﬂat and clutched at
the surface. Cries and pandemonium
arose abruptly from the wreckage of
the solarium: Oskin Yahlei had ﬁnally
been distracted enough to relinquish

his hold on the other magicians. The
green meat hook again rose into view,
looking tattered, started to dive back
through the gaping hole in the roof,
then halted indecisively. All at once it
turned and headed straight for me. I
rolled on my side, brought up the walk-
ing stick, trying to say Gash’s magic
word the right way, and swung at the
diving construct. The stick, refusing to
change, merely waved in its direction.
I threw myself onto my back and the
hooks zoomed past my belly, gnashing
angrily.
I was pretty angry myself. The roof
beyond my feet abruptly caved in.
I
started sliding down the folding roof
toward the hole as the green meat hook
ﬁnished its turn and pointed itself at
me again. I snapped at the disguised
sword yet another time, but this time
it listened. The walking stick melted

its shape and burst into ﬂame, my
arm holding it tried to turn itself in-
side out, I ﬂopped awkwardly to my
left, propelled by the sword’s strange
momentum, and at the last possible in-
stant the blade of the sword danced out
and passed straight through the twin
green shafts holding the sharp meat
cleaver spikes. The severed points shot
off in diverging trajectories out of my
sight like miniature javelins, the rear
section,
trailing lime-colored smoke,
passed over my head and buried itself
in a pile of broken boards, and the
sword, now unleashed and hunting for
more trouble, ﬂung me away from the
widening hole in the roof and toward
the edge of the solarium.
Carl Lake’s house, in the deliberate
process of turning itself into a pile of
scrap lumber, lurched again and stag-
gered further toward the street. One

whole wall was now on ﬁre. Ahead of
me, in the wreckage of the solarium,
roars, hisses, small explosions in the
air, and sprays of multicolored light in-
dicated that the local magicians were
squaring off against someone, and po-
tentially against each other too. In the
second I had before hurtling over the
edge of the roof to join them, strain-
ing to wrestle the sword down and say
the word to deactivate it, I did man-
age to catch a glimpse of a neat rain
shower condensing out of the air over
the ﬁre; that seemed a sign that Flora
was okay, anyway.
"Ki’tonk’ta-ah’," I
gasped, the sword, which seemed to be
getting crabbier every time we did this,
began to change back, and I hit the
lip of the roof on a line running across
my lower ribs.
My arm ﬂailing the
walking stick came around in a fast
arc under the force of my fall. Chest

and arms and head were sticking out
over the wrecked solarium, looking
down at the dented palm tree leaning
against the wall, I scrabbled with my
free hand and fended off with the stick,
and then just as I had decided I’d ac-
tually managed to retain my balance
I spotted a crumpled form, its hands
clasped over its head, huddled in the
space underneath the tree.
I cast a quick glance around the
room.
The husk-like body of the ma-
gician Oskin Yahlei had used for his
demonstration had rolled against the
burning wall and was starting to char.
The front wall was largely gone. The
last of the other magicians were lower-
ing themselves through the splintered
holes down the rubble onto the street.
I spotted Flora helping a man with
a bloody head and a twisted arm, de-
cided not to bother her, and instead

carefully swung the rest of my body
over the edge of the roof and dropped
past the palm tree to the interior ﬂoor.
I bent down to examine the huddled
ﬁgure.
As I’d expected, he was pretty much
undamaged; he’d only been hiding. "Hi,
Carl," I said.
He lifted one arm and rolled his eye
up. "You," he said. "You perhaps may
be wondering why I did certain things."
"No," I said, "I’m not." I grabbed him
by the back of the collar and pulled
him to his feet, the new bruises across
my ribs and along my side sending out
sharp throbs of disapproval. "I think
I understand real well why you did
what you did.
You did real good for
yourself, getting your leg ﬁxed, and
everybody has to look out for himself
ﬁrst, right?, and how could you have
known you wouldn’t end up running

the city, and anyway you didn’t actu-
ally get me killed yet even if I did lose
a perfectly good sword."
"You don’t hate me?"
"Just because you were on a differ-
ent side than me? Nah. How could I
hate you when you’re about to help me
out?"
He rubbed his bottlebrush eyebrows.
"Hmm, indeed," he said. "Hah."
"Hah," I said. "Hah." The building
shook again. The ﬂoor, which already
had about a ﬁfteen degree tilt toward
the street, settled some more. "Where’s
your friend Yahlei?"
"He has left."
"I ﬁgured that out already.
I want
to know where he went." We were next
to the door Oskin Yahlei had originally
entered through, under my observa-
tion spot. The door was closed, but the
frame had partially caved in around

it and the top panel of the door was
mostly splintered board.
I kicked at
the doorknob with the heel of my foot.
On the second try the doorknob tore
through and the door smashed open,
the hinges came loose from the jamb,
and the whole door crashed noisily into
the next room.
I still had Carl by the neck, and now
I dragged him with me through the
empty doorframe. We clambered over
a fall of rubble, which was the section
of roof that had fallen in next to me
moments before, and then just behind
us the ceiling creaked, the creak grew
into a rumble, and the rest of the roof
came down as well; the door I’d re-
moved must have been all that was
holding it up. At the end of the room
the side wall had fallen into the alley.
The largest drop from one major clump
of debris to the next was now no more

than a few feet, so when I pushed Carl
through the wall ahead of me I ﬁgured
he couldn’t hurt himself that badly,
especially not with his new leg and all.
I made it down faster than him, grit-
ting my teeth against my assortment
of aches, so I had plenty of time to
get him by the neck again before he
decided to take off.
I may not have
hated him but I sure didn’t trust him
either.
I ﬁgured he might not be too
happy himself about leading me to Os-
kin Yahlei’s hideout. Me, I could hardly
even believe I was considering what I
was seemed to have in mind. Unless
Gashanatantra showed up unexpect-
edly, though, the ball was still in my
court, and the only way I might get it
out was to keep moving.
It was dark so I couldn’t see his face,
but I didn’t have to. "You must be in-
sane," he said, when I told him what

he was going to do. "To go deliberately
to seek out Oskin Yahlei? Insane, cer-
tainly insane, certiﬁably insane."
•’You’re probably right," I said, "but
don’t let that part concern you. If you
have to, think about the terrible things
crazy people are apt to do."
"What, you will kill me? How could
that be more terrible than the wrath of
Oskin Yahlei?"
"Oskin Yahlei’d have to catch you.
Me, I’ve already got you."
"Hah," Carl said.
"With what you
will kill me?
You said you have no
sword."
"My bare hands will do if they have
to, but I’ve got something easier. You
see this?" I waved the walking stick in
front of his face.
"Indeed, yes, a basic staff." Carl
sounded less than impressed, but the
chuckle he was starting didn’t last

more than half-a-second.
The stick began to whine. As Carl
looked around for the source, it added
a pulsing glow, too, picking up its cue
to the hilt.
I still didn’t know how
smart the sword was, but it did show
a sharp instinct for betting on where a
meal might come from.
"Ah, hmm," Carl said.
"Yeah, you should see it when it’s not
in disguise.
I think it likes you.
Of
course, it’s been getting pretty hungry."
A spark leapt across and hit Carl on
the nose. "I said I’d lost that sword, I
didn’t say anything about this one. So,
are you ready?"
"Um, hmm, yes, I believe so. You can
calm that down?"
"Sure," I said, "no problem, Now let’s
go."
A buzzing crowd had gathered in the
Street of Fresh Breeze in front of the

demolished building and its neighbors,
which weren’t in much better shape. I
had a feeling the crowd wouldn’t be too
pleased to greet either one of us at the
moment, so I led Carl down through
the alleys and out the other side of the
block, still feeling an occasional crash
and shudder in the ground from behind
us. We gained the street and Carl led
north.
"What happened in there?" I said. I
was ﬁnally taking the chance to catch
my breath; that had been an intense
couple of minutes there.
"For how long did you watch?"
"From the beginning of the meeting.
You did say I’d be invited, after all."
"Hmm, yes. Then you must have wit-
nessed the attack on Oskin Yahlei."
"The guy with the green meat hook,
yeah."
"Not him alone." Carl rubbed his eye-

brow. "The tremor, the devastation, the
ruination of my house, this too was an
attack. But by whom?"
"You mean you don’t know? I thought
you knew everybody you’d invited."
"None of the people in attendance
has this class of manifestation among
their known skills. It is most curious
. . .
You have not recently taken to
magic, have you?"
"Me!" I said, with what I hoped
was not a guilty start. "Hah, what a
thought."
"Hmm, no, no, of course not.
In-
deed, the emanations were . . .
very
peculiar, unlike most anything I have
encountered."
Those emanations were unlike those
of anyone in the vicinity except Os-
kin Yahlei, I bet, unless there was yet
another god lurking around I hadn’t
met yet.
We were still winding our

way north. The curfew was up, so we
were whispering and sticking to the
shadows, not that there had been any
hint of trouble. Maybe the Guard had
picked up Oskin Yahlei on his way
home, hah hah. I was keeping a close
eye on Carl’s hands, but even with
his recent practice his magic wasn’t
heavy on anti-personnel skills; like I
said, that’s how the muggers had been
able to get him the ﬁrst time we’d met.
"How much further?" I said.
A faint shriek rang in the air from
somewhere up ahead, maybe ten blocks.
Suddenly it stopped.
Carl had listened carefully. "Approx-
imately that distance," he told me.
"Thanks a lot. That’ll put us almost
at the north wall."
"That is correct. "
The area where we were heading
wasn’t particularly fashionable.
The

houses leaned out over the street on
their own, here, the pavement was
more irregular when it wasn’t com-
pletely dirt, and the streets were grow-
ing into narrow alleys.
The streets
also wove around more, pointing north,
then northwest, then east.
It wasn’t
the kind of neighborhood where big-
time magicians usually liked to hang
out.
"Just what’s so great about this
Yahlei character,
anyway?" I asked
Carl.
"He is a necromancer.
This means
something to you, yes?"
"All right, yeah. Necromancers are
supposed to be hot stuff."
"Indeed, yes. So consider this. Even
among necromancers, Oskin Yahlei is
very, very powerful."
"Okay, so he’s very, very powerful.
What else?"
"That is not enough for you? Give up

this silly quest."
"I’ve got a client who’s even more in-
sistent than your man Yahlei," I said.
"That’s why I can’t."
He had been trying to lag for a while,
and now he stopped in his tracks. "But
why?
Why, yes?
What is one more
client for you? Will the client kill you,
hmm, drain from you the aura and
crush you to a husk? But Oskin Yahlei
- both of us will surely die, and then
the torment will have only begun. He
will think the attack on him was my
fault, that I had been false to him, and
he will . . .
indeed, both of us will be
lucky to merely die."
I decided not to tell Carl that Oskin
Yahlei wasn’t merely a regular person-
type necromancer, either, at least not
yet, since he didn’t seem to know; he
seemed upset enough as it was. "No he
won’t, you’ll convince him it wasn’t you.

Now come on, already, or I’ll let you try
pleading to the stick."
He looked around at the walking
stick, remembering what it had showed
about itself before, and started moving
again. "Very well, fatalistic I shall be."
A few moments later we drew up to
another corner, and he put his hand
up for me to stop. "Carefully," he said.
"Look here."
I eased past him and poked an eye
around the edge. The street where we
were now hidden was deﬁnitely an al-
ley, about four feet wide and ﬁlled with
trash; the cross street was much wider,
say ﬁfteen feet or so across. It ran east
and west, roughly, with a gradual turn
north at each end of my view. A few
aimless street lamps pushed back little
clumps of night. The lamps were like
twisted drunks in the dark, shrugging
off the black like blows off ravaged

shoulders:
it was that sort of place.
Across from me I could see a large
vacant lot, overgrown with trees and
shrubs and surrounded by a weathered
block wall. Carl had pointed down the
street to the right, so I looked in that
direction.
Next to the lot was a two-
story building of the same stone as
the wall.
In fact, the wall continued
around the building too, its top glisten-
ing with spikes and jagged glass and
sharp iron rods. The building was sur-
rounded by pillars and ornate cornices.
It sure hadn’t started life as a house;
those walls were pretty thick. It looked
more like a fortress.
"A former temple," Carl whispered
behind me. "The god whose tract it was
fell from prominence some years ago."
And now it was Oskin Yahlei’s head-
quarters. Going over the wall and in
through an upper-story window, one of

my favorite techniques, looked doubt-
ful in this case. I was being forced into
a decision I really didn’t want to make.
A quiet clattering off to my right
turned into a small party of Guard
troopers. They approached the temple
and stopped.
The soldiers were look-
ing around nervously and starting at
nothing; I had the feeling they didn’t
like the neighborhood either.
A door
opened, spreading a quick fan of light
across the street, and a man leaned
out to hold a brief exchange with the
Guard leader. The new man was visi-
ble to me only in proﬁle, except for a
sigil on his tunic that caught the light.
It was new to me - a twisty purple blob
with ﬁre coming out of it.
The con-
versation ended, and the party went
through into the temple. As they did,
I could see that the two members of
the group in the middle were dressed

in simple street clothes, had swords
poking at their backs, and hands that
seemed bound.
Two prisoners who
wouldn’t be coning out again anytime
soon, it looked like.
Something was nagging me about
that vacant lot next door.
It was ob-
viously part of the temple property,
because of the wall, but even in the
darkness it didn’t feel like a simple
overgrown garden. I asked Carl.
"Certainly you realize that is the
cemetery, yes?"
The cemetery, of course. Raw mate-
rial for a necromancer. I really wanted
to be somewhere else. Unfortunately, I
wasn’t."Carl, tell me about him."
"Oskin Yahlei?" He sighed.
"He is
very powerful, but already you realize
that. He approached me ﬁrst two, no
three days ago, demanding my alle-
giance. I knew little about him, except-

ing only his power, until your visit to
me this morning. I told him your story
of this barrier. He was surprised; he
did not anticipate his work would be-
come apparent at this time. Since this
was evidently what was transpiring,
he elected to strike against those who
might spread the word."
"He doesn’t want publicity."
"Manifestly so. Indeed . . . yes, this
I will say. He is powerful, but often un-
certain, insecure, as though his power
is in some ways new to him. As before,
at my unfortunate lodgings. The ener-
gies at his command could have devas-
tated the block and all within it, yet at
the crucial moment he elected to ﬂee.
He is a dangerous foe, and the more
dangerous for his unpredictability. Es-
pecially if he grows more decisive."
I glanced around the corner again.
The old temple was still there, and

there wasn’t a sign of Gash in sight.
He wasn’t going to bail me out. I faded
back from the edge. "Okay," I said to
Carl, "Thanks. That’s very -"
I had been planning it, I’d had to.
Carl was still turning his head when I
laid the walking stick hard across the
back of it. He sank to the ground. I
ripped pieces from his shirt and tied
him before rolling him under one of the
less offensive piles of garbage.
Then
I straightened, adjusted my clothing,
forced my body to assume a conﬁdent
upright air I didn’t feel at all, and
crossed into the street.
The wall around Yahlei’s temple had
a new door in it, barred and thick as
the wall and ribbed with iron.
I ap-
proached, looking neither to the right
nor to the left, raised my arm, and
struck the door with the stick.
The door gave off a rolling hollow

boom. After a moment, the small panel
in the upper half slid back and an eye
appeared.
"I am here to confer with
Oskin Yahlei," I said. I was trying to
make it sound like I had legitimate
business every day with folks like Os-
kin Yahlei, but I don’t know how suc-
cessful I was. I felt, in fact, like I was
doing the dumbest thing I had ever
come up with.
The eye traveled down my body, then
back up. "Who is calling?" the voice of
the lackey asked.
This was it.
I rolled my own eye
up and hoped for a reprieve.
None
descended. There was no way out. I
steadied my voice and said, "It is I,
Gashanatantra."

Chapter12
SHAA AND MONT
GO TO JAIL
SHAA AND MONT DROPPED SILEN
off the tail of the Guard troop and let
the soldiers to whom they had attached
themselves clatter off into the gloom.
"I don’t like this," Mont said.
"It’s
called
protective
coloration,"
Shaa said. "Most intelligent creatures

use it." They had progressed toward
the center of the island, deep into the
catacombs. Shaa glanced around, his
eyebrows slightly knitted. "There must
be a dungeon around here somewhere,
this place feels too much like dungeon
to be anything else."
Mont, from the layout of the halls
they had passed through, had a fairly
good idea where the dungeon was, but
he decided there was something he’d
better get cleared up ﬁrst. "When we
ﬁnd the dungeon . . . "
"Yes?"
"When we ﬁnd the dungeon there’s
sure to be some kind of guardroom -"
"Unquestionably."
"- unquestionably, and that’ll proba-
bly be full of guards."
"No doubt."
"Right, no doubt. What are we going
to do about them?"

"What do you think we should do
about them?"
"Oh, knock it off already," Mont said.
"You’re the expert, tell me an expert
plan."
Shaa considered reminding him that
his basic plan was founded on improvi-
sation, but chose against it. "We will
reconnoiter ﬁrst. Then we will attempt
to gain unalerted entry using our -" he
rattled his cuirass "- disguises. When
we are in position, we will attempt an
ambush."
"Do you have any idea how many
places that plan could go wrong?"
"Yes," Shaa said, “I do. Now, where
is that dungeon?"
"I, ah, hmm . . . "
"What are you listening for?"
Mont was rotating his head slowly.
He raised his hand. After a moment,
he opened his eyes and pointed down

the hall in the direction taken by the
troops. "The music sounds best in that
direction, sort of low and creepy. Dun-
geon sounds."
"Very well." They moved quietly off
in Mont’s direction.
"I’ve been thinking . . . " Mont whis-
pered.
"Yes?"
"When we get to the dungeon, why
couldn’t you say you’re an interrogator
come to torture the prisoners? Like, uh,
with that cloak and all the stuff you’re
carrying around you’d be a natural."
Shaa stopped short, then resumed
his pace. "That, my friend, is a ﬁrst-
rate idea.
It is exactly what we will
try."
"Uh, ah," Mont said.
The concept
that Shaa might have actually said
something nice to him had taken him
by surprise. The corridor forked, Mont

sniffed the air and led them down the
left-hand passage, that passage soon
forked as well, and they descended a
tight coil of steps. Lights were visible
at the base, and the sound of voices.
"Ulp," Mont said, hesitating.
Shaa drew him back.
"Are you
afraid?" he whispered.
"Ah, uh, I ...”
"It is a simple and human thing to
feel fear," Shaa said. "Strength of char-
acter comes when you feel fear and nev-
ertheless go on.”
"Are you afraid?"
"Of course. I always am, in a situa-
tion like this."
"But you don’t seem -"
"That is a different matter, called
style.
Each person must evolve that
for himself.
Or herself.
Now, listen
closely." Shaa whispered a few ad-
ditional instructions to Mont, Mont

nodded, and again they descended the
stairs. At the bottom of the staircase
was a pointed archway, and beyond it
an open rectangular room.
Across from their entrance was a
heavy wood-beam door embedded in
an iron frame and manacled securely
to the wall.
Two other doors on the
facing walls stood open, but these were
regular doors leading merely to further
corridors.
Aside from the usual array of gut-
tering torches, a plank table and two
matching benches, a ﬁrepit, several
swords
and
cudgels
hanging
from
hooks on the wall, and an antique
torture cage rusting pleasantly to one
aide, the only furnishings were four
guards.
They put their hands on
their swords and turned toward the
entrance.
Mont put up his chin and
strode into the room. "This is the in-

terrogator," he announced, indicating
Shaa with an outstretched arm.
Shaa, standing in a dramatic posi-
tion framed in the center of the arch-
way, his legs planted and one hand
on his hip, removed the iron bar from
under his cloak.
He lowered his eye-
brows suggestively, twirling the bar
like a marching band baton. "It’s about
time," one of the guards said.
"You
want us to bring ’em out, or you want
to go in?"
"The interrogator will go in," Mont
said.
The guard corporal looked around,
said "Crumb! Come with me!" to one
of the other troopers, and moved to
the bolted door, producing a brass ring
with large keys from his belt.
"Bet-
ter let the two of us go in ﬁrst," he
said over his shoulder to Mont, as he
unlocked the door. Shaa looked guile-

lessly at the ceiling. The door creaked
open, the weight of the two guards be-
hind it, and Shaa and Mont followed
the two into a dim corridor lit by widely
spaced torches. The walls of the hall
were thick brooding stone hewn from
the rock of the island, broken occasion-
ally by gates of iron grill and taste-
ful patches of moss.
"You want the
roundup from the ﬁrst day, I’ll imag-
ine," the corporal said, stopping at the
ﬁrst cell.
Shaa leaned against the wooden
door to the cell block, swinging it par-
tially closed, then nodded to Mont.
Mont, standing just behind the corpo-
ral, shielded himself from view with
his body and brought the knobbed hilt
of his knife down hard against the
man’s head. Shaa took two quick steps
and swung his bar. Both guards sunk
to the ﬂoor together. Shaa nodded ap-

preciatively.
In a passable imitation
of the corporal’s voice, he called back,
"Can you guys give us a hand in here?"
The heavy door creaked open. Shaa,
now standing behind it, swung his
bar again, hearing the swish of Mont’s
thrown knife. Mont’s second throw was
better than his ﬁrst, on the wharves
earlier in the evening.
The guards
grunted and collapsed.
Shaa left the guards where they’d
fallen and trotted toward Mont, who
had already fumbled the correct key
into the lock.
The door rasped and
opened. Mont stepped into the cell and
looked anxiously around.
Shaa drew
his sword and moved to the entrance
behind Mont.
The cell extended some distance
back into the rock. The only light was
a meager trace of orange that leaked
in from the torches in the passage,

leaving the depths of the cell still to-
tally black.
Shadows moved in the
dark.
The half-dozen forms closest
to the door were illuminated enough
to see that they were dressed in civil-
ian clothes, now besmirched.
One of
the prisoners gaped sullenly at Mont,
while the others ostentatiously ignored
him behind turned backs. Mont exam-
ined them, stopped, took a nervous
half-step forward, and said, "Father?"
The man at the center of the small
group wheeled and stared.
The light
caught lean hollows in his face and
made slashes across sharp eyes, his
silvering hair glowing orange in the
torch-ﬁre. "Jurtan! - what do you think
you’re doing here?"
"Uh, rescuing you. All of you."
Jurtan’s
father
stalked
forward,
drew back his arm, and swept his
hand into Mont’s face.
Mont reeled

backward into the door.
"You puk-
ing worm! You couldn’t rescue a ﬂea!
You’ve sold out to them, haven’t you,
and you come in and try to -"
"Father, just give me a second to -"
"Rescued? By you?" The man loomed
menacingly over Jurtan, raising his
hand again. Jurtan was still clutching
the barred door, trying to regain his
feet. "Of all the ridiculous -"
"Sir," said Shaa, "we would be pleased
to let you remain here, when we leave
with the others."
"And who do you think you are?"
"Opinion has little to do with it.
I
am Zalzyn Shaa." Shaa extended the
arm with the bar to one side, crossed
the other forearm over his waist, and
executed a neat bow.
"Whether I am
at your service remains obviously to be
seen."
"What are you doing here?"

"As my esteemed companion aptly
explained, we are rescuing you. Or not,
as you prefer,"
The former Lion of the Oolvaan
Plain stared at Shaa, speechless.
"We are unwelcome here," Shaa said
sadly. "Jurtan, if you please - the key.
We will leave these gentles to their own
contemplations."
"You wouldn’t dare!" Mont’s father
roared.
"Yes," Shaa said, "I would."
"You rodent! You ﬂea! You unspeak-
able heap of -"
"Dad," said a female voice, "shut
up." Another shape appeared out of
the gloom.
"Oof!" This was yet another voice, a
reedy high-pitched one belonging to an
elder of some sort. "Yeaouch!"
"Oh!" said the woman. "I beg your
pardon, Your Grace."

She pushed forward, the same sharp
eyes and conﬁdent manner as her fa-
ther snapping toward Shaa across the
cell. "Jurtan, good. What’s your plan?"
"Into the hall, quickly," Shaa said.
"Everybody!" He was already moving,
Mont after him, the girl next.
Shaa
strode over one of the prostrate guards-
men, put his foot under the hilt of
the man’s sword and kicked up, caus-
ing the sword to spring into the air,
and ran ahead, not breaking his mo-
tion. The sword wheeled twice in the
air and the hilt thudded solidly into
Mont’s hand. Mont closed his hand out
of reﬂex, gaping at the sword. His sis-
ter ran around him through the thicker
door into the outer room.
Shaa charged across the guardroom,
started up the stairs, and paused. The
sound of marching feet was audible
from above. It was also growing louder.

"Uh, Shaa?" Jurtan said from behind
him.
"What?"
"Did I mention that sometimes the
music warns me when something’s
about to happen?"
"Oh, great," Shaa said sarcastically.
"Over here, everybody!" Mont’s sis-
ter yelled from across the room. Shaa
turned to see her waving people through
one of the other doorways. Mont’s fa-
ther, a disgusted expression on his face
and a sword in his hand, plunged past
her, snarling "Let me to the front!",
and was gone.
The marching feet-tramp reached
the staircase and began to descend in
their direction. Shaa would have loved
to lock them out; unfortunately the
staircase was the one entrance to the
room that didn’t have a door. Mont lent
a shoulder and they shoved the guard-

room table across the ﬂoor. Upended,
it might block the archway - a soldier
clattered around the bend from above
and saw them. Shaa leapt to the top of
the table and displayed his sword. The
guardsman jumped forward two steps,
drawing his own sword, and engaged.
Shaa swept his other arm around from
behind and hit him with the iron bar.
The clang of the bar faded and new
footsteps clattered on the stairs as the
soldier rolled limply beneath the ta-
ble. Mont, holding his sword, began to
climb up next to Shaa.
"No," Shaa said.
"I will hold them
here. You must safeguard the prison-
ers."
"But -"
"You will ﬁght later.
Action, wher-
ever taken, is nonetheless character,"
Shaa said. "Go."
Mont chewed his lip, leaned in the di-

rection of the exit, bobbed uncertainly
on one foot, looked at Shaa, and then
took off down the tunnel.
Another voice spoke from Shaa’s
shoulder, "You can’t hold this room
alone," Mont’s sister said. "There’s too
many doorways."
Shaa glanced across and down at her,
where she stood next to the table. "I ap-
preciate your encouragement," he said
dryly.
"Look out!" she said.
Shaa leaned and thrust at the sec-
ond soldier without bothering to shift
his eyes, a sardonic twist on his mouth,
and felt his sword fenestrate a chest.
He bowed slightly in the direction of
Mont’s sister. "Your name?" he said.
"Ah, Tildamire," she said. She was
quickly discovering the same thing her
brother had found out earlier, that
Shaa’s
attitude
had
a
remarkable

capacity for disconcerting its target.
"There’s another one coming!"
"If you’re going to stay, you might
as well lock the other doors." Shaa had
turned more serious attention back to
the staircase. The squads he had seen
so far generally ran to ten men apiece.
Two were already under the table -
no, three, he thought, as the iron bar
unchivalrously claimed another victim.
The fourth and ﬁfth rushed together,
side-by-side, the one on Shaa’s left frac-
tionally closer; Shaa had his sword in
his right hand and was presenting his
right side to them, almost within reach.
He stepped back, moving to their left,
the trooper on the far side lunged just
a little further, Shaa’s blade nicked
out at the soldier lagging behind, and
the man lost his balance on the slick
step, fell across the length of his part-
ner’s sword, and carried them both

forehead-ﬁrst into the heavy slab edge
of the table.
Two sets of legs now stretched up-
ward along the lower stairs.
Shaa
quickly knelt, rummaged under the
table with one hand, temporarily stick-
ing the iron bar in his belt, and came
up with another sword.
Six, seven,
and eight rattled around the corner.
Shaa hefted the new sword, drew it
back, and launched it hilt-ﬁrst over
the heads of the ﬁrst two guardsmen.
It hit the third man in the shoulder.
The impact of the heavy hilt spun him
slightly, making him ﬂail about for
balance with both arms, and suddenly
another multi-person tangle was crash-
ing down the stairs. Shaa performed
detail work with his iron bar.
The table creaked behind him.
"I
could only lock one, and it isn’t going
to hold for long," Tildamire told Shaa.

"Quiet," Shaa said. The footsteps of
new fodder on the steps had stopped.
Shaa jumped down from the table,
landing silently, and backed across the
ﬂoor, holding his sword warily in front
of him. A reddish glow appeared at the
top of the circular staircase.
"What is it?" the woman whispered.
The glow intensiﬁed, as something
drew around the stairs and came closer
to them. "I suggest ﬂight," Shaa told
her.
"But what about you?"
"I will delay it," Shaa said, "I hope."
The
glare
from
the
staircase
was
painfully bright, and was now cast-
ing a sharp-edged fan of pink across
the ﬂoor and table and ceiling. The fan
swept along the room, spreading out.
Shaa twisted a small stud on the hilt
of his rapier, breaking the integrity of
its inhibition spell, and bands of ﬂam-

ing blue wearing hard jagged spikes
danced down the blade. He looked at
Tildamire. "Thank you for your solici-
tude. I am, however, not suicidal. Now
go."
She took a last glance, her mouth
hanging slightly open, and ran out the
remaining open door after the other
prisoners. Shaa backed to the doorway
and kicked the door shut after her as
the thing from the staircase ﬂoated
into the room. It ﬁgured there had to
be a sorcerer hanging around some-
where, Shaa thought, his habitual air
of smugness somewhat dented by the
circumstances.
The light burst full into the room,
skimming down the last stairs and
over the table. Shaa squinted against
the glare.
The construct was tall,
Shaa’s height, a spinning pillar of inter-
meshing helices, interference patterns

traveling slowly across its face. Wav-
ing tentacle-like protrusions ﬂowed
from irregular nodes on the surface.
The thing leaned into a turn and scud-
ded toward Shaa, its screeching whine
mounting.
Shaa struck an en garde
and cut at the nearest tentacle, felt a
brief catch as his churning blue blade
bit the air, and saw a severed tenta-
cle end twirl to the ﬂoor in a wisp of
shooting sparks. He let the momentum
of the sword swing it through another
tentacle and went for the body.
The bands of ﬁery blue ground into
the construct like a sharp saw. Then
the sword caught again and turned
in Shaa’s grip. He fought for control,
seeing his shadow ahead of him on
the ﬂoor.
In the instant he noticed
the shadow and realized one of the
glowing tentacles had snuck around
behind him, a pain as of ﬂames ﬂayed

his back and lanced through to his
chest.
He hacked frantically at the
tentacle behind him, nicked it, and
fell to his knees as yet another ﬂailing
arm swept over his head. The whirling
body drew nearer; his earlier thrust
had bashed in one side and the thing
was wobbling erratically, but it was
not yet near its end.
The functional
tentacles reached for him. Sweat ran
down Shaa’s face into his gritted teeth.
His spine contorted.
He threw him-
self back, swinging his rapier in front
of him for a stop-thrust, a shower of
sparks cascaded over his face, and
Shaa felt a lightning shock run down
his sword-arm and into his shoulder.

Chapter13
MAX DROPS IN
OVER THE MOUNTAINS they ran
into a storm. Under more rational con-
ditions they would have let it ground
them.
Thunder crashed on all sides,
lightning lit the giant billows of heav-
ing clouds, and downdrafts threatened
to rip the bird’s wings off and smash
them all into the ground. Haddo’s skill
and the buzzard’s native cussedness

drove them on; Max wanted to hoard
as much of his strength as he could,
and inﬂuencing even calm weather
was a major energy sinkhole.
The
sky was merely overcast when they
reached the river.
The bird turned south, the scattered
lights of sailing vessels making cryptic
beacons below them in the night. Ten
miles north of Roosing Oolvaya they
went into a long glide.
The city was
only a mile or two downstream when
the bird leveled out, twenty feet over
the long swells. Max adjusted his face-
mask, checked the pack straps, and
slid into the river. Haddo and the bird
banked east and faded out of sight in
the darkness. Max turned on his back.
The current ﬂoated him downstream.
Roosing Oolvaya approached. With
a little luck he’d be in and out quickly,
Max thought. His arm still hurt. He’d

made liberal use of some healing gunk
or another Karlini had had sitting
around or he wouldn’t have been able
to move it at all. Not that partial in-
capacitation surprised him - it was the
typical kind of problem for a mess like
this.
A broad eddy swept him closer
to the west bank. The main moon was
just rising, low in the east and mostly
waned away, and behind the clouds
to boot.
The walls blocked the light
from the city. Max picked out his sec-
ondary landmarks as faint silhouettes,
sighted on the north-point lighthouse,
and struck out for the northeast corner
tower.
Cross-currents and whirlpools caught
him as he neared the wall.
He had
expected them, too, and had made al-
lowances for an irregular passage.
A
ﬁnal riptide dragged him into the lee
south of the tower. Max put out a hand

and rested it against the piling sup-
porting a rotting wharf, taking a mo-
ment’s rest. The suit of treated hides
Karlini had dug out of a storeroom
was supposedly waterproof. A trickle
was running in down the back of Max’s
neck, though, and several other small
leaks were accumulating water in the
attached booties; just enough to be
thoroughly annoying.
Max scratched
between his shoulder blades, glowered
at the suit, and then started measur-
ing his way to the left along the bulge
of the city.
He soon came to the end of the old
wharf, saw a twenty-foot gap before
the next, sighted up at a spire ris-
ing beyond the wall, and nodded with
gloomy satisfaction. Max felt out with
his hand.
Three feet from the wharf
the stone of the wall ended in an arch.
Water smacked against the stone lip,

and against the iron grating spanning
the outlet. Max took a deep breath, put
his head down, and dived.
The grating was solid in the rock.
The center section, however, was hinged
and the lock had not surprisingly
rusted out. Max secured the gate be-
hind him with a twist of rope. As he’d
expected, the magical barrier around
the city was short-circuited by the
ﬂowing water; he’d felt nothing more
than a sensation like a ﬁne-tooth comb
being dragged backward through his
aura. The culvert proceeded under the
wall before turning up, but the ceiling
height was more than adequate to al-
low walking. He slogged inward. The
real reason he had bothered with the
water-repellant suit was that it also
repelled whatever was in the water;
Max was notoriously fastidious, and
sewers after all were sewers. He kept

the bone-and-hide face-mask ﬁrmly
planted over his nose, breathing as
infrequently as possible.
At an intersection he stopped to
verify his bearings.
Stretching away
from him toward the west he could see
a round tunnel, awash to mid-thigh
level, its lower roof broken by periodic
shafts leading up to gratings in the
street. Other feeder tubes entered high
up on the side surfaces, some spilling
runnels of dark ﬂuid. Dim light came
down some of the vertical shafts and
made strange glittering patterns on
the moving water.
Max sloshed for-
ward, passing one major turnoff, then
another.
A clatter ahead caught his
attention. The illumination down one
shaft abruptly intensiﬁed as the man-
hole cover above was lifted.
Twisted
and elongated shadows writhed on the
wall, Max heard a cry begin and be

abruptly stiﬂed, and then one of the
shadows separated from the other and
came sweeping down. A ﬁgure dropped
from the shaft into the water. The slow
current pushed the man past Max, his
throat cut. Max crouched and entered
a tunnel to the side.
He threaded his way through the
maze. It was difﬁcult to appear com-
pletely transparent to sorcerous search,
because of the radiative characteris-
tics of auras; to make an aura totally
disappear was nearly impossible. Mak-
ing an aura look like it belonged to
somebody else, on the other hand, was
much less complex and generally more
successful, camouﬂage being a basic
principle of nature. So it was that Max
appeared, to even a probing search, as
a large and fairly bedraggled muskrat.
The disguise was helpful in more ways
than one. Some large species lived in

the river, but they tended to ﬁnd the
taste of muskrat unappealing.
Even-
tually the tunnel Max was following
ended at a massive stone block.
Max stopped to consider.
By his
calculations the large block was part
of the foundation for the north wall.
The house of Oskin Yahlei should be
a few hundred feet west, south of the
wall or perhaps immediately next to
it. The neighborhood had been outside
the original city.
During the recon-
struction from a large ﬂood a century
or so earlier, in the same spurt of civic
zeal that had seen the sewer system es-
tablished, the wall had been extended
north to encompass what was then a
thriving district built on a series of low
hills.
Also encompassed were a number of
Roosing Oolvaya’s original cemeteries.
With the periodic ﬂoods, putting graves

above the water level had looked like
a good idea.
As far as public health
went, the plan had worked out ﬁne;
ﬂood waters left the bodies alone. On
the other hand, ﬂoods weren’t the only
things that were interested in them.
The ﬁrst thing a necromancer did
when moving into a new domain was
chart the locations of all the local
graves.
Corpses, after all, were the
necromancer’s
basic
stock-in-trade
and source of raw material.
A necro-
mancer’s dream house was next to his
or her own private reserve. This was
what Oskin Yahlei had managed. Max
had serious questions about certain
parts of the situation, but about one
thing there were no doubts.
Oskin
Yahlei had the potential to be very
dangerous.
Max decided to remain with the
underground route for the time be-

ing.
He backtracked to the nearest
intersection and went right. The cul-
vert tilted gently up, the current grew
faster and gained bite in its force. Max
leaned into it; the incline meant he
was ascending the underside of a hill.
Passing beneath another vertical shaft,
he heard the rattle of a small group of
men on patrol passing overhead. The
clinking faded off into the night. An-
other opening approached on his right,
and Max approached it cautiously.
The water swirled at the intersec-
tion, making a small foaming whirlpool
with dim blue highlights.
Down the
side passage the blue glow was stronger.
Max peeked around the arch. Beyond
the junction the secondary passage
widened, increasing in height and con-
tinuing slightly uphill.
Thirty feet
ahead and ﬁve feet over the water
level he saw a boat landing recessed

into the wall, the blue glow emanat-
ing from somewhere at its back. Hu-
manoid shapes moved on the landing,
their shadows dancing madly on the
water.
There were two - no, three of them,
virtually reeking of necromantic con-
juration; the anticipated zombies, no
doubt. Max smiled a not particularly
pleasant smile.
He reached over his
shoulder and removed the top item
from his pack. Submerging himself to
the neck in the water, he unwrapped
the article he had selected, revealing
two lead balls connected by ﬁve feet of
thick cord. A second item fell free into
his hand - a hollow reed about a foot
long and two inches in diameter. Max
glanced around the corner again and
checked the clearances.
With a little
luck it would work, and he wouldn’t
even need his injured arm.

Max moaned loudly across the end
of the reed.
The mournful drone res-
onated down the passage,
hanging
in the air with the echo of a wailing
drone.
He waited a minute, then
moaned again.
This time Max was
rewarded with a chorus of splashes
from
the
direction
of
the
landing.
Footsteps sloshed in the tunnel.
The
creatures were coming, Max thought,
and why not?
After all, what self-
respecting undead could resist the
famous Zombie Love Call?
Max said
a ﬁnal word to the cord; it too began
to glow.
Then he popped the end of
the reed in his mouth, sank down,
and watched the shaft, the top of his
faceplate barely out of the water, brac-
ing himself against the current.
An-
other splash sounded, very close now,
the blue glow strengthened, a twisted
shadow fell upon the water and the far

wall, and then a hand appeared around
the corner. A web of faint sparks knit
the greenish tissue together around
its gaps and tears, tendons sliding in
plain sight over the stark white bones.
Clutched in its grip was a tarnished
brass handle.
Suspended from the handle was a
globular mass of writhing blue coils -
a zombie glowworm, for all Max knew.
The rest of the body attached to the
hand shambled wetly into sight.
In-
ternal organs shifted restlessly within
the zombie’s chest cavity, a trail of in-
testine leading back around one leg
and up the tunnel. It looked around,
searching eagerly for the source of the
call. A second zombie elbowed its way
into view, followed by a third; the smell
was mounting well above the normal
odor of the sewer, penetrating to Max’s
nose even within the face-mask.
He

raised his hand, twirled the weighted
cord twice around his head, and let it
go.
The cord spun around the torso
of the ﬁrst zombie, snapping through
the rotten humerus in its right upper
arm and ﬂinging it off-balance to its
rear. Sparks of white crackling along
its length, the cord continued to spin,
chewing its way through bone and
ﬂesh alike.
One iron ball smashed
through the second zombie’s ribs as
the ﬁrst creature slammed into it. The
cord snapped tight, the momentum
grinding the two together, one torso
suddenly imploded under the pressure,
and bits of tissue splattered against
the walls.
The third zombie tottered
and fell as its feet were swept out
from under it.
With a paroxysm of
splashing, the tangled mass of zom-
bie ﬂoated quickly around Max and
headed downstream. The current had

taken the lamp, too - it bobbed behind
them, spun in an eddy, dwindled, and
went out of sight around a corner. Max
allowed himself a quick smirk, then
went around the arch into the side pas-
sage. He climbed a short ladder to the
landing.
The landing was little more than
an alcove in the side of the sewer tun-
nel. Max stowed his face-mask in the
pack as he glanced around. The area
was now almost totally dark, the only
break in the blackness being provided
by a wiggling blue wormlet that had
snagged on the sharp edge of a rock. A
small rowboat was pulled up into one
corner of the alcove and secured with
a cable through an eyebolt in the prow.
Another ladder led up to a trapdoor in
the landing’s roof. Max examined the
ladder carefully, then gingerly climbed
it, pausing at the top to ease open the

trapdoor just enough to peek in over
the edge.
The trapdoor occupied the
corner of a cellar otherwise ﬁlled with
crates.
The yellow-red light of can-
dles showed in the jamb of a door in
the wall above.
Nothing was moving.
Max pulled himself through the door
onto the cellar ﬂoor, eased the trap
down, felt his way to the stairs, and
paused, one foot poised over the ﬁrst
riser. Something felt strange about the
stairs.
Max lowered his foot back to the ﬂoor.
Bracing himself with one hand against
the rock-and-dirt wall, he closed his
eyes, stretched gently out with his
other arm, and made a ﬂowing gesture
with his hand. He concentrated, and
the orientation of his senses precessed
slightly out of their normal alignment.
Max opened his eyes.
A swimming
haze surrounded him, small oval pad-

dles like disembodied hummingbird
wings spinning through it. He focused
past his aura, up onto the staircase.
A nebulous pink haze hung over the
steps.
It faded as he watched, still
churning silently.
So much for the stairs. Max didn’t
know exactly what the thing was, but
that was ﬁne with him; he wasn’t in-
terested in research at the moment. It
was Max’s ﬁrm philosophy to avoid the
frontal assault wherever possible. To
his great regret it wasn’t always possi-
ble.
In this case, though, there were
other options.
Max spotted a thick bearing beam
holding up the ceiling in front of the
door at the top of the staircase. Climb-
ing over a crate, he reached a spot
below the beam and raised his left
arm.
His sleeve fell back, revealing
the wrist appliance he had last used

back in the bar at the desert oasis. The
spring-loaded
mechanism
in
which
Max usually kept a knife was good for
other things as well; he removed the
knife and inserted a dart. He steadied
the appliance with his other hand and
released the catch. Springs pinged, the
dart lanced up, trailing a thin cord, and
with a low "choonk" the dart embedded
itself in the beam. Max leaned on the
cord; the hold was solid. He went up
hand-over-hand, fending off from the
wall with his feet and grimacing from
the load on his bad arm, taking care
not to touch the staircase.
Max quickly drew abreast of the
door, dangling below the ceiling and at
the outside of the landing at the top of
the stairs. He put his eye to the crack
at the door jamb.
The stairs contin-
ued upward beyond the door, ending
ﬂush with the ﬂoor of the next story

in a closet that looked like a pantry.
That door was standing open, admit-
ting light from another room; Max’s
door unfortunately was locked.
He
reached inside his suit and slid out a
set of lockpicks. Max took a ﬁrm grip
on the cord, taking the dead weight
off his left forearm, lowered himself
to the level of the lock, and inserted
one of the picks. Ten seconds later the
lock clicked. Max pulled the door open,
swung himself over the banister and
through the doorframe, and steadied
himself with a foot up on the handrail
and his free arm over the lip at the
edge of the ﬂoor at the level of the top
of his head; the current section of stair-
case looked ﬁne, but he wasn’t quite
ready to trust it more than the other.
As he had spied through the crack, the
stairs went steeply upward to an open
door leading onto a plain whitewashed

hall. The well for the stairs would or-
dinarily be covered by a wooden slab;
this cover was currently raised on its
hinged back and secured overhead.
Stacks of dry goods in sacks and boxes
covered the rest of the closet ﬂoor and
were heaped against the walls around
the open stairwell. There was no one
in sight.
Max pulled himself up to the door
sill at the ﬂoor level and took a quick
glance around the door into the hall. It
was still empty. Crouching, he let go of
the climbing cord, reinserted his knife
into the wrist appliance, turned the
recessed crank that wound the springs,
spent a quick moment stretching out
his injured arm, which had held up
remarkably under the exertion, and
eased out into the hall, closing the door
behind him.
Across the hall he could see the

entrance-way to a darkened kitchen
and a thick candle in a wooden holder
next to it on the wall.
To the right
of the kitchen the back hall inter-
sected another hall, this one much
fancier, leading away toward the front
of the building.
Max slid across to
the kitchen, blew out the candle, then
leaned sideways to see around the cor-
ner into the front hall.
The front hall was cluttered with gilt
mirrors and footed end tables. Max’s
end of the hall was now in deep shadow,
but the light was much better toward
the front, where the left side of the
hall opened onto a large space lit by
the glow of many candles. The hall’s
ceiling also opened, becoming a series
of free arches casting strange patterns
under the ﬂickering light. A set of dou-
ble doors broke the wall on the right.
At the end of the hall was a small en-

closed entryway leading to the front
door.
Unfortunately these were not the
only features. Two men-at-arms were
visible in the corridor where it faced
the larger open room, one positioned at
each side of the double doors, a third
was planted next to the half-closed
door to the entry, and the shapes of
two more were visible at either side
of the door to the street.
They each
bore a strange device of purple bands
with a column of coiling ﬂames ascend-
ing from it. So Oskin Yahlei had his
own private militia; that was a detail
Karlini had neglected to mention.
Max glided silently back out of sight,
A climbing staircase beckoned across
from him, down the continuation of
the back hall. The problem was that
the man at the entry door was looking
straight back along the cross-corridor.

If Max tried to sneak across, even in
the deep shadows at the rear, the guy
would clearly spot him.
Max had an
advantage in that no one knew he was
around; if he tried to direct the man’s
eyes away or use some other distrac-
tion he might make it to the staircase,
but he’d have a bigger chance of alert-
ing another element of Oskin Yahlei’s
forces. Or a trap. A staircase wasn’t
worth that much. He decided to check
out the kitchen.
The kitchen was located in a rear cor-
ner of the building; the adjoining walls
featured a small ventilation window.
Max hoisted himself atop an upturned
washtub and looked out.
In the dim
light outside he made out a modest
ﬁeld, with perhaps a hint of the city
wall at its back. Directly outside the
window was a skeletal tree. He closed
his eyes and felt quickly around. The

window didn’t seem trapped, but Max
didn’t like the feel of the tree, or of
the grounds, for that matter. The win-
dow was constructed around wooden
crosspieces set in an elliptical frame
and hinged to swing outward: when
Max tentatively tried to ease it open,
though, the window stuck.
A conve-
nient canister of kitchen grease later,
it moved silently open, the barest start
of a shriek yielding to another globbet
on the hinge.
Max stuck his head out through the
open frame.
Another roundish win-
dow on the second story was a few feet
to one side.
By standing on the sill
he could almost reach its frame.
He
crouched, then sprang, grabbed the
lower jamb of the second-story window,
and chinned himself on it. Inside the
window was a bedroom, dark and quiet.
The window opened at his touch. He

lowered himself silently to the ﬂoor.
Max tiptoed toward the door. Behind
a screen concealed from the window
was a bed, containing a sleeping girl
apparently covered only by a small rug
and a ﬂimsy burnoose. He paused and
raised an eyebrow, wondering brieﬂy
at the tastes of gods. There were cer-
tain things in the story of Oskin Yahlei,
the mobile castle and its kidnapped oc-
cupant, Karlini and Roosing Oolvaya
that made less than total sense when
accepted at face value.
Max was es-
pecially suspicious about the role of
Oskin Yahlei. Hopefully, though, Max
thought, moving to the door, the mo-
ment of resolution is approaching. The
corridor beyond the door was bare.
The corridor ran directly over the
back hall Max had scouted downstairs,
and in the same direction. Where the
cross-corridor on the ﬁrst ﬂoor had led

to the front of the house, though, there
was nothing here on the second ﬂoor
but a blank wall.
On the other side
of the blank wall, Max assumed, was
the second-story extension of the large
open room off the front hallway on the
ground level.
The architecture was
unusual for a house. Max had already
taken into account the cemetery on the
lot to conclude that the place was prob-
ably a converted temple, with the big
room on the ﬁrst story being the wor-
ship space proper. One thing he was
still wondering about was what god the
temple had originally been dedicated
to.
Across the hall from the bedroom
he saw another door standing ajar.
The room behind it was empty.
Max
crossed and entered.
On the wall to
the left of the door were three large
open windows overlooking the expanse

of the sanctuary. A tightly wound cir-
cular staircase in the back left corner
led down to the ground ﬂoor, proba-
bly to the room that had been on the
other side of the double doors ﬂanked
by guards. Empty bookcases lined the
remaining walls.
A blackboard on a
tripod stand, recently erased, leaned
against the bookcase behind the stairs.
A large desk with a matching armchair
and the carved lectern next to it dom-
inated the center of the room.
The
desk bore a stack of cryptic papers, a
scattering of glassware, candles, and
chalk, and a set of unlabelled canisters
with tightly sealed lids. This was ap-
parently Oskin Yahlei’s workroom; he
would have to show up here sooner or
later.
Why
a
god
needed
a
workroom
was another question that was fuel-
ing Max’s pet suspicion.
He crept to

the top of the circular staircase and
paused. Voices were audible from the
room below, but their meaning was lost.
Rising, Max crossed to the nearest win-
dow for the view of the temple interior.
Scattered candles and a few torches
smoldered below.
Whatever altars,
tapestries, fonts, or other furnishings
had originally ﬁlled the chamber were
long gone, leaving only bare walls and
long trails of soot. In the typically dim
light, Max could make out a half-dozen
of the men with the purple badges, and
another group of perhaps eight or ten
clustered to themselves near one wall -
regular Guard troops, most likely. The
Guard soldiers were watching a small
number of prisoners; the lighting made
it difﬁcult to tell exactly what was go-
ing on.
No one was being given the
level of attention and respect that Os-
kin Yahlei would command, so if he

was in the building he was probably
in the room just below.
Max stepped
back from the window and eyed the
workroom. The only hiding place that
would be concealed from both the door
and the staircase was behind the desk,
so Max moved around the desk and
lowered himself to the ﬂoor.
The voices downstairs were still
engaged in conversation.
Max rum-
maged inside his backpack, pulled out
a ﬂat rectangular case, and snapped
it open.
Inside was a blowgun and
several darts with ﬁnned ends. Their
needle points glistened with a sticky
dark brown substance; a scratch would
cause immediate stupor lasting hours
in most any living thing smaller than
Haddo’s buzzard. A larger dose - two
darts’-worth, say - would not only turn
down the conscious mind but the veg-
etative as well, thereby arresting the

victim’s breathing.
Fitting the tubu-
lar halves of the blowgun together,
Max slid a dart inside and placed the
weapon next to him on the ﬂoor. For
good measure, Max also loosened the
stiletto in its leather sheath strapped
to the outside of his boot, and then set
to work with his other preparations.
Max didn’t know exactly what he
was going to need to do.
That is, he
knew what he had to do - deal with
the ring, the ring that was holding the
owner of Karlini’s castle a prisoner, the
ring that Oskin Yahlei no doubt was
wearing - he just didn’t know exactly
what he’d have to go through to accom-
plish that. To deal with the ring he’d
presumably have to deal ﬁrst with Os-
kin Yahlei. He wasn’t sure how much
dealing-with Oskin Yahlei would take,
but Max ﬁgured he’d better be pre-
pared. From all accounts, the ring had

been designed to trap and encapsulate
the owner of the castle, allowing the
ring’s wearer to utilize the power of the
being penned up in it. It was this occu-
pant that Max would have to release.
Any magician in his right mind would
only take on a task like that when the
conditions would allow patience and
ﬁne control; there were a lot of nasty
things that could go wrong.
For one
thing, recorporating a disembodied en-
tity was a major job usually done in
several stages.
When the entity was
presumed to be a Death, and when one
could reliably assume he would emerge
in a state of no little annoyance, that
only made things worse.
Max didn’t have the luxury of choos-
ing his time and place, but he’d pre-
pared as well as he could. He and Kar-
lini had designed a set of nested con-
ﬁnement spells that Max had brought

with him. The plan was to incapacitate
Oskin Yahlei, by sneak attack or sub-
terfuge if possible, then encase him in
the big conﬁnement ﬁeld with the ring
still on his ﬁnger. The ring itself would
be wrapped in the other restriction
spells within the larger cage matrix.
Max was hoping that would give him
enough protection to probe the nature
of the ring’s defenses while containing
anything that started to leak out; the
probes that would enable this were
ready, too.
The whole sequence was
linked and programmed, in fact - the
conﬁnement layers would crystallize
simultaneously in a self-supporting
array,
automatically
activating
the
probes in quick graduated sequence.
A
battery
of
quiescence/somnolence
thrall-routines ﬁring with the probes
would hopefully calm the ring’s occu-
pant to a decent level of sedation. If

he had to, Max would try to release
the ring’s prisoner at that point, when
the results of the probes were in, but
he was hoping that wouldn’t be nec-
essary.
With a little luck he’d have
stabilized the ring enough to get it off
Oskin Yahlei and take it away with
him without setting things loose.
Max rested his rapier on the ﬂoor
within easy reach.
He had begun to
think that swords were too convenient
a solution for many problems, and one
that lacked ﬁnesse, but they certainly
did have their uses. No regular sword
would bother Oskin Yahlei, of course,
but with the number of soldiers around
it still might come in handy. It could
be a serious enough business that Max
wanted all the backup he could get.
Even with all the preparations, his
luck at penetrating the city and Oskin
Yahlei’s headquarters without discov-

ery and without serious opposition,
and his ability to react well and think
on his feet, Max was still hoping he’d
make it through the experience alive
and in one piece. It wasn’t a question
of whether something would go wrong.
Of course something would go wrong,
something always went wrong.
The
only question was how much of a mess
it would be.
Boots tramped and armor clattered
from the room below.
A heavy tread started up the cir-
cular staircase.
Another lighter set
of
footsteps
followed
it,
uncertain
steps, falling one-two, one-two-three,
as though the walker wasn’t quite sure
what he was doing. The voice of a man
began to separate itself out from the
mufﬂing wails. " . . . mumble mumble
of this ring?" Max put the blowgun
to his lips and sank down behind the

desk, peeking out from the side around
the chair. A man’s hand appeared on
the banister, the middle ﬁnger wearing
a gold ring, then behind the hand a
head.
A black eye patch covered the
left eye, and the black aura of the ring
covered the ﬂesh.
Oskin Yahlei, the man who might be
Death, came up through the ﬂoor.

Chapter14
MONT SOLOS
JURTAN MONT VAULTED the body
of a Guardsman his father had speared
as his sister, running faster, caught up
with him. "Just who was that guy?" she
panted, glancing back over her shoul-
der.
"His name’s Shaa, he says he’s a doc-
tor." Another strangled yelp came from
the head of the column. The prisoners

were straggling out into a long line,
Jurtan bringing up the rear, as the less
physically ﬁt among them lost their
ﬁrst wind.
Some of the people from
the original cell had had the foresight
to open other doors up and down the
dungeon hall.
As a result, the ﬂee-
ing crowd was now quite a rabble of
merchants, local royalty, government
advisors and ofﬁcials,
various fam-
ily members, priests and clerics, and
representatives of the general public
swept up into the hand of Kaar. The
yelp from the front was followed by a
thud of body hitting ﬂoor and a muted
berserker battle cry.
Jurtan’s mind,
which had been projecting a soft trav-
eling string motif at him, insistent
in its runs of rapid notes and propul-
sive rhythm, gave a quick skip at the
barely melodic barbarian yodel, which
had sounded suspiciously like the voice

of his father. He blinked, grabbed men-
tally at the stabilizing sound of the
strings,
regained his stability,
and
plunged ahead with only a momentary
hesitation. "Where is Shaa, anyway?"
he asked.
"He stayed behind.
A magician
showed up. It didn’t look too good."
"He stayed to ﬁght a magician?"
Jurtan said.
That didn’t make much
sense; Shaa had said he wasn’t a ma-
gician himself, and if he wasn’t he
couldn’t possibly last long. "I hope he’s
okay."
"You sound worried about him."
"Yeah, well, he’s a pretty strange
guy, but I’d have been really sunk if he
hadn’t popped up."
"What about you?" his sister said. "I
never thought you’d show up."
"I didn’t think I would either." Ju-
rtan was still scared to death, but

beneath that was a low thrill of accom-
plishment.
Whatever Dad had said,
he’d been doing pretty well so far. "Dad
seemed even madder than usual about
it, though. Is it just him being the way
he usually is, or has he got some extra
problem this time?"
"Oh, you know Dad." Another pros-
trate trooper rolled past beneath their
feet. "They caught him in an ambush,
one of them held a sword across his
neck while another one pounded him
over the head. He’s mad he didn’t go
down ﬁghting, take ten or twenty of
them with him."
"It looks like he’s sure trying to make
up for it now."
"Well," Tildy said, "you know Dad."
The corridor forked ahead and widene
to the right.
The line of staggering
people made the turn like a single crea-
ture, perhaps a giant tunnel-traveling

worm. Jurtan and Tildy followed. "You
know this place better than me," she
said. "Where are we going?"
"If Dad wasn’t so mad he’d head
for the armory and clean it out, hang
a dozen swords and maces and stuff
over his back, then hit the barracks or
the docks or someplace like that. But
when he gets this mad - how does he
feel about Kaar right now?"
"He was talking about Kaar a lot in
the cell, wanting to tear his arms off
ﬁrst and make him eat them, that kind
of thing."
"What I thought,” said Jurtan.
“I
think he’ll be going after Kaar directly,
no matter who’s in the way."
"He’s going to get to Kaar through
here?" They had entered an area of
storerooms, with wooden doors open-
ing from a central sorting ﬂoor.
Cor-
ridors and staircases snaked off in

various directions.
"Yeah, I think I remember -" The mu-
sic in Jurtan’s head abruptly shifted
mode, the strings grew harsh, and a
transformation to harmonic sevenths
gave an air of urgent danger. "Watch
out!" he yelled.
"Something’s gonna -
oof!" The large woman in front of him
had stopped short, craning her head
at something up ahead, and Mont had
barreled into her going full speed. He
spun back and fell to the ﬂoor.
The line of moving people ground to
a halt at the renewed sound of metal
on ringing metal from up at the head.
New boots pounded behind them, too.
Tildy whirled, Jurtan struggling back
to his feet. The lead elements of a new
bunch of troopers charged around the
fork in the hallway, bellowed, and thun-
dered in their direction.
"Everybody
scatter!" Tildy yelled, grabbing Jur-

tan’s arm, and yanked him toward the
closest door next to them at the side of
the room.
The door had been almost
completely shut, but not quite, since it
was slightly warped in its frame, but as
Tildy’s shoulder and the hurtling front
of Jurtan’s reeling body plowed into
it it opened quite deﬁnitively, launch-
ing them both head-ﬁrst into the room
beyond and into the room’s contents.
Jurtan plowed through a rack of
shelves, bounced off a wall, pushed
off the wall, and slammed back against
the door just in time to ﬂing it shut. He
fumbled for a lock, a bar, something to
block the entry; the darkness in the
closet was broken only by the irreg-
ular doorframe and the rays of light
that tickled through it from the room
outside, along with the pandemonium
of sudden cries and bashings and run-
ning footsteps. "Tildy?" he said. "Are

you okay?"
"I - Jurtan, watch -"
Jurtan spun around.
Through the
gloom and clatter, he saw a rush of
motion - a large hulking shape was
rocking down toward him.
He threw
himself sideways. The massive shape
teetered through one of the rays of
errant light from the doorframe, re-
vealing itself to be the case of shelves
he had fallen into and upset. Jurtan
buried his head against the wall as
the giant case slid in a collapsing mess
against the door.
"Tildy?"
"Jurtan?"
Whomm! The door shuddered under
an impact from the other side.
The
shelves merely creaked and collapsed
further.
Jurtan was lying in a mass
of crunching wood and small delicate
objects, his unfortunate landing zone

in his mad leap out of the way; they
only cracked and snapped additionally
as he struggled up.
Fortunately, the
mass of heavier objects falling from
the shelves had mostly missed him,
inﬂicting nothing more than glancing
bruises and scratches.
"We’ve got to
get out of here," he said.
With a groan and a loud rattle, the
outline of light around the door ﬂashed
again.
"I don’t think getting out is
going to be the problem," Tildy said.
"This mess won’t keep them out for
long."
"You’re okay,
aren’t you?" Jurtan
said. He had been fumbling in his belt,
looking for his carrying-pouch.
His sister managed a half-hearted
giggle. "Okay? Sure, I’m okay - we’re
only penned up here like pigeons in
a coop, waiting for the foxes to break
through the -"

Then Mont found the pouch, and
what he was after inside of it - a lighter
ﬂint. He struck the ﬂint. The momen-
tary spark that ﬂashed out showed
a fairly small closet, now ﬁlled with
wreckage, a dust-covered sister, and
the former contents of the fractured
shelves. Mandolins. Lutes, ﬁddles, a
twisted harp. Underlining the point, a
string snapped with a quivering twang
somewhere deep within the pile. Other
cabinets stacked against the walls of
the closet held other instruments.
As Shaa would say, Jurtan thought,
there is a certain air of inevitability
about this. The door shuddered again
under the weight of energetic bodies
and one of the panels in the top half be-
gan to give way. A new jagged slash of
light spilled on the far wall. Through
the crack in the door parts of shoul-
ders could be seen. "Do you have any

ideas?" Jurtan said.
"I’m looking for a sword or a club or
something useful - you’d better do the
same thing."
"Okay, so you don’t have any helpful
ideas either. In that case there’s some-
thing I want to try." He pulled the lid
off one of the crates and rummaged in-
side.
"Will it help?"
One board in the door panel snapped
cleanly away and sailed across the
room. A brawny hand reached through,
ﬂailing ineffectually. "It might," Jurtan
said. He held up a ﬂute and squinted
at it.
"The other way," Tildy said.
"Huh?"
"You hold it the other way round."
"Oh." Jurtan reversed the ﬂute and
put it to his lips.
More hands were madly ripping

apart the upper door; their entry was
clearly a matter of seconds.
“I hope this is good, Jurtan," Tildy
said.
"Me too," he mumbled. The music in
Jurtan’s head, which had been holding
at an expectant quiver, added a sud-
den snarl of trumpets and the rolling
patter of a snare drum.
He put his
ﬁngers over the holes on the body of
the ﬂute, blew into the mouthpiece,
and froze. His body froze, and his arms
in their raised position and his eyes
staring downward at the ﬂute, but a
high clear sound had appeared in the
air, and his ears were locked around
the sound, hearing it to the exclusion
of all other senses, his mind stuck on
the single thought of the sound and the
breath coming almost on its own from
his chest. And as his breath whistled
through the ﬂute, his mind realized

slowly, very slowly, that it was actu-
ally working, it had not after all gone
blank, the thoughts were forming and
circulating like leaden snails but they
were indeed alive, he was awake, and
there was music not only in his head
but also, for the very ﬁrst time, outside
of it as well.
Jurtan Mont took another breath
and blew again, and this time, even
more amazingly,
his ﬁngers began
to dance on the body of the ﬂute at
the ends of his frozen arms.
Music,
true music burst out, harmonizing and
rounding with the music in Jurtan’s
head, a midrange ﬂuid melody run-
ning against the insistent scales of the
strings and the exulting blaze of trum-
pets.
He wondered how it sounded
to the listeners - probably weird, be-
cause most of the music was really
in his mind; the ﬂute sound would

be tantalizingly incomplete without
the rest. He concentrated on his eyes.
Haltingly, with a deliberately leisurely
pace, they began to roll up, His ﬁngers,
unconcerned with any irrelevant ac-
tions elsewhere in the body, seemingly
plugged directly into some hidden mu-
sical control center, kept up their ﬂying
leaps back and forth along the ﬂute.
Then the doorway came into view, the
splintered upper door, the large gaping
hole where the whole wooden panel
was smashed through, the two Guards-
men halfway through the opening -
the two Guardsmen! The two Guards-
men, draped across the lower lip of the
opening, their arms trailing downward,
their heads lolling, their faces blank.
Jurtan’s
suspicion
was
growing
stronger.
He managed to turn his
head, ust a little, and marched his
eyes around to the side.
Tildy, too,

had slumped backward to the ﬂoor, a
dazed expression on her face, her ﬁn-
gers curled limp and loose around a
mallet-shaped piece of wood.
Jurtan
gradually closed his eyes and concen-
trated on listening. Over the magnetic
rush of the music, like a whirlpool of
sound still trying to suck him back in,
was - nothing!
No running feet, no
bashing swords, no cries, no moans,
nothing!
Wow! Jurtan thought. Not too bad!
It seemed as though everybody in
earshot was paralyzed, knocked out,
shut off, just the way he usually be-
haved when music hit him.
Right
behind that realization came another
that he didn’t like nearly as much -
his ﬁngers were really starting to hurt.
And the ﬂute was heating up.
Whatever this ability was, its power
was beginning to take a toll: Jurtan

didn’t know how much longer he could
keep playing. If the effect on the people
around him was anything like it was
on him, though, they might start to
wake up as soon as the music stopped,
but if they did they’d be pretty groggy.
They wouldn’t be accustomed to the
situation, either. That would give him
a bit of time.
Maybe he could buy a
little more time than that, too.
Jurtan focused on the music, willing
it to go faster.
His ﬁngers, already racing, began to
ﬂy. A repetitive pattern in the strings
moved a tone higher, then higher than
that, picking up an element of added
insistency.
He began to note the ap-
proach of a crescendo. A wisp of smoke
curled up from the ﬂute.
Then, sud-
denly but with an air of ﬁnality, in a
paroxysm of muscle-wrenching glee, a
blast of virtually concrete pandemo-

nium shot out from under Jurtan’s
hands and across the room and out
around the hall. The ﬂute burst apart,
shattering into tiny shards. A surpris-
ing silence echoed.
Then the silence was broken by the
single crash of Jurtan sagging back-
ward into the shelf of twisted man-
dolins. He was exhausted. His ﬁngers
were swelling; in the light from the
hall he could see the red and purple
colors of developing bruises on the tips.
They hurt, too - Jurtan put out a hand
to support himself and jerked it back
after only the barest touch, wincing at
the tenderness. An electric tingling of
which he’d been only vaguely aware
was fading, making itself known by its
absence.
There was also the sharper
pain from the ﬂute splinters driven
into his ﬁngers and his face around the
lips.

Jurtan’s catalogue of woe was abruptl
interrupted by a groan from the door-
way.
One of the Guard was stirring.
Jurtan gritted his teeth, shook a few
protruding splinters loose from his
hands, and staggered to his feet. Tildy
was breathing but seemed deeply un-
conscious.
He eyed her wood club,
chewing his lip.
The club had been
the supporting upright from one of the
shelves, not much of a weapon really,
but on one end of it was a heavy iron
ﬁtting.
Okay, he thought, but I sure
wish somebody was around to see this.
He knelt and wrapped his hand around
the club.
Yeow!
It felt like he’d rested his
ﬁngers on an active griddle.
Jurtan
yanked his hand back, then heard an-
other gurgle from the trooper in the
door.
He forced himself to reach out
again, settled the club into the crease

of his palm, as far away from his ﬁn-
gertips as he could get, and lifted the
shaft of wood into the air.
I can do this, he thought, really I can.
The soldiers in the door were stirring,
but that was about it. Jurtan looked
down at them for a moment, set his
jaw, and swung the club, then swung
it again. He tried to tell himself it actu-
ally wasn’t that bad the second time.
The door was so battered that Jur-
tan was able to kick it off its hinges
and out into the hall without using
his hands for leverage.
He spent an-
other minute bashing the remaining
dozen troopers in the hall over the
head. Then he returned to the instru-
ment closet, gingerly selected a new
ﬂute from the crate, and slipped it into
his belt.
More than anything else,
Jurtan
wanted to tear off looking for Kaar

himself. His father was not one of the
groggy people scattered around on the
ﬂoor;
Kaar was undoubtedly where
he’d gone, and who knew what kind
of trouble he’d already gotten himself
into there.
Jurtan ﬁgured that if his
new-found ability was going to be good
for anything, it could at least show
Dad he could be useful to have around.
Maybe Dad would even accept that you
didn’t necessarily need to know how to
hack people up with a sword to be a
productive member of society.
But he couldn’t go, not now, not yet.
It wasn’t just his hands, he could force
himself to use them if he really had
to - in fact, he already had. The prob-
lem was something else. It looked like
at least ten or ﬁfteen minutes before
Tildy and the other former prisoners
were back on their feet, and when
they woke up they’d still have to deal

with the soldiers.
That would have
been okay, if only Tildy or the prison-
ers could be relied upon to wake up
ﬁrst, but of course they couldn’t. Jur-
tan didn’t want to out-and-out kill the
troopers and he couldn’t use his hands
well enough to tie them up, so there
was only one alternative. He’d have to
wait and keep an eye on things him-
self.
With a sigh, he cleared a space
with one foot, settled to the ﬂoor, and
leaned back against the wall.
Kaar wasn’t the only major thing
nagging
at
Jurtan’s
mind,
though.
Where was Shaa?

Chapter15
BIG TROUBLE
SHAA AWOKE. The surface upon
which he was propped was irregularly
heaving; another boat. His hands were
manacled together on the other side
of a thick post, and the post ran up
through the low ceiling above his head.
Frothy water splashed outside the
low window at Shaa’s right, glowing
softly against the night, and fell back.

Shaa took stock, glowering in the dark-
ness. His chest hurt when he breathed.
Various other locations around his
body throbbed. His cloak and all the
equipment beneath it were gone.
Laddered steps led steeply down-
ward to Shaa’s deck from a hatch just
forward of his post.
The hatch was
suddenly thrown back, introducing the
face of a soldier and a hand with a sea-
lantern. Shaa scowled up at him. The
man grimaced back and said, "Time to
say your prayers, spy."
Shaa raised an eyebrow.
"Indeed.
Where are we going?"
A dark cloud seemed to settle down
over the guard’s face. "Oskin Yahlei,"
he muttered, and slammed the hatch.
"Huh," Shaa said.
Maybe it was a
suburb.
"Uuoaah," said a new voice, rather
hoarsely, behind him.

Shaa craned his gaze back over his
shoulder. Another man, also manacled,
but to an eyebolt at the stern of the
chamber, was raising his head gingerly
off the deck.
"Good evening," Shaa said.
"Cheerful one, aren’t you, eh?" the
man said. He groaned again. "Didn’t
you hear where they’re taking us?"
"Indeed,” Shaa said again. His head
was wooly, he realized, clearly impair-
ing his choice of ready vocabulary. “Per-
haps I lack the appropriate referents.
I take it Oskin Yahlei is a name de-
signed to strike fear into knowledge-
able hearts?"
"He’s some kind of sorcerer, one of
those, eh, what ’cha callum? - works
with dead guys?"
"Necromancer?"
"Yeah, that’s the one, that’s Oskin
Yahlei." The man had pulled himself up

against the aft wall, his legs sprawled
across the ﬂoor and his chained arms
contorted behind him. In the dim light
from the open windows caked blood
could be glimpsed all along one side of
his face. His clothes were little more
than tatters; they had not apparently
been much to start with. "I knows the
name, I’ve never met him, not me, not
yet, but every day they comes into the
cell and picks some guy and takes him
out to Oskin Yahlei and the guy never
comes -"
"The cell? Which cell? You are not, I
take it, a political prisoner?"
"Me, politics? Eh, hah, never touch
politics, not me. Whadda you take me
for?"
"A thief," Shaa said, "hopefully."
"Nah, not me. Me, I burn down build-
ings. Why you asking?"
This is not helpful, Shaa thought. "If

you were a thief, you could have picked
these locks and gotten us out of here."
"Oh. Hey, that’s a good idea! Uh ...
you’re not a -"
"No." Yet again the problem of extri-
cation devolves on me, Shaa thought, so
what else is new.
"Oh," said the arsonist. "Eh, so like
I was telling you, every day they takes
some guy to Oskin Yahlei and we never
sees him again. This time it’s me, and
you too."
Raw material for a necromancer,
what a delightful conclusion to the day.
Let this be a lesson, Shaa thought; the
next time early retirement is offered,
I should take it.
Enough with these
crummy adventures.
The slap of the waves changed as the
boat pulled up to a pier, the deck rolling
more erratically as the hull responded
to the reﬂections of water against the

dock pilings. Shaa and his companion
were dragged through the hatch and
up a series of ladders to the street, and
were hurried off, hands still chained,
under ever-watchful guard. The men
on the boat had handed them off to
an escort that had been waiting for
them at the dock. This new party was
made up of a dozen or so men from
the regular militia, and one other man
who seemed to be in overall charge.
Under this man’s cloak, his jacket bore
the same unfamiliar device Shaa had
spotted earlier in the day, the purple
pretzel; possibly it was the sign of Os-
kin Yahlei’s own personal retainers. As
near as Shaa could ﬁgure it, they were
heading north and west, toward the
hills around the north wall.
Shaa’s chest was still hurting, in a
dull deep ache with sharper patches
on the surface, and that was starting

to worry him.
The electric blasts he
had taken from the tentacled conjured
thing might have done him lasting
damage. Because of the nature of his
curse - one of his curses - Shaa was
forced to be especially protective of the
structures in his chest; what he needed
now was a rest cure, but that was an
unattainable luxury.
He would have
to be very careful, and very lucky, and
hope that he didn’t have to deal with
too much magic in the near future.
The
procession
turned
left
onto
a empty street that ran parallel to
the north wall and just south of it.
Through the overgrown shrubbery on
a vacant lot to the right, in fact, Shaa
could see the massive blocks of the city
wall. A rundown building came after
the empty lot, and then a stone wall
crowned with spikes. They approached
the tall door in the wall.

The man wearing the sigil of the
pretzel rapped on the door. A panel in
the top part slid open, another servi-
tor peered out, a few whispered words
passed back and forth, and then the
door swung heavily inward.
A short
path led across a narrow courtyard to
an ornate stone-front building.
The
gate behind them closed, and then one
of the large double doors to the build-
ing ahead of them rotated open, its top
lintel twice Shaa’s height. Yet another
door, equally as tall, blocked the inner
exit of a small entry-hall or vestibule.
Beyond the inner door the function
of the building suddenly became clear.
An auditorium opening ahead and to
the right, its ceiling stretching the
long two stories to the building’s roof,
had once been the worship-room of
a temple.
It had not been a major
temple, as such things went, but the

signs of altars and hangings and other
similar apparatus were still visible as
lighter shapes against the soot-worn
walls. The place certainly hadn’t been
a house,
especially considering the
neighborhood; this area of the city had
never been the place people went to
build their mansions.
The left edge
of the auditorium, more of an aisle re-
ally, became an actual hallway ahead
and toward the rear of the building.
On its left wall were a set of smaller
but equally ornate double doors, now
closed, but ﬂanked on either side by
pretzel-wearing guards. Another half-
dozen guards were scattered around
the temple. The Yahlei man who had
accompanied Shaa’s party from the wa-
terfront spoke to the sergeant of their
Guard escort.
The sergeant did not
seem pleased.
"You will remain here with the pris-

oners," the Yahlei man said, his voice
rising. "Do you understand?"
The sergeant glared back at him,
rather sullenly, Shaa thought.
He
opened his mouth to speak, bit off a
word instead, wheeled, and said, "All
right, you men, bring them into the big
room."
A sword jabbed Shaa’s back.
The
troop turned right and proceeded to the
far wall of the former temple. Against
the wall were a shiny new line of iron
eyebolts driven into the stone at head-
top height. "Chain up the prisoners,"
the sergeant growled.
From behind them came a sudden
collective intake of breath. The double
doors at the side of the aisle crashed
open, the echoes booming through the
large open space in the clear shocked
silence. The party turned, all eyes in
the room swiveling toward the doors.

A new ﬁgure stood there, in a cloak so
black it seemed to eat the light, dra-
matically framed by the lines of the
doorway, an active ﬁre in an iron grate
behind him that etched his shape in a
writhing bed of red. The hood of the
cloak was thrown back; the left eye
was covered by a patch of black leather
stark against the paler gray of his face,
but his right eye was blue and deep
with a hardness like slate.
The ﬁgure clasped his hands behind
his back as the pretzel man from the
waterfront approached him and then
whispered in a low deferential mur-
mur.
Against the intense hush, the
only other sound was the soft crackle
of the ﬁre. The pretzel man gestured
across the room at the Guard troop,
then speciﬁcally indicated Shaa. The
one-eyed gaze of the dark ﬁgure fo-
cused on Shaa.
Shaa grew cold, and

felt like his will was ﬂowing out onto
the bare ﬂoor and back across the tem-
ple.
It was not his imagination; the
dark ﬁgure was projecting some leech-
like force. The pretzel man, who was
perhaps more of a chamberlain, said
something else, the ﬁgure nodded, and
the two of them approached.
The members of the Guard began to
sidle unobtrusively away.
The cham-
berlain, who was lagging discretely
behind his boss, snapped out, "Stay
where you are!
Hold them securely!"
Then the dark ﬁgure put his arm out,
palm down, and the chamberlain shut
up with an abrupt rattle in his voice.
The ﬁgure spoke. His voice was like
the dull clang of a cold gong. "You are
the one called Shaa? Could that be Doc-
tor Shaa? The famous Zalzyn Shaa?"
Acting on instinct, his conscious fac-
ulties in collapse as the room swam in

his eyes, Shaa said, "Indeed, yes. Have
we met?"
Another mass inhalation of breath
swept around the room.
The
chamberlain
leapt
forward,
roughly elbowing a Guard trooper out
of the way, and smashed his hand as
hard as he could against the side of
Shaa’s head.
Shaa let his head and
body rock to the opposite side and
back, absorbing the blow but keeping
his feet. The pain was still deep and
sharp, but served to partially clear his
head. The chamberlain drew his hand
around for another swipe.
"Forbear," said the ﬁgure.
"Yes,
master."
The
chamberlain
shrunk back, glaring ominously and
somewhat petulantly at Shaa.
"Toadies," the ﬁgure said to Shaa, in
a more conversational tone. "I look for
responsible assistants, viceroys, aides,

and all I ﬁnd are toadies."
"Sycophancy is, sadly, a pervasive
problem," Shaa agreed, the pall of stu-
pefaction beginning to lift.
"I take it
you are Oskin Yahlei?"
"Indeed," said the voice like doom.
The man who burned down build-
ings let out a high shrieking wail,
dropped to his knees, paused there,
and then fell deliberately over on his
face. Oskin Yahlei had turned to watch,
displaying a look of some bemusement,
Shaa thought. Now he turned back. "I
also take it," Shaa said, with more of
his usual sardonic drawl, "that you are
really the one running things around
here, which things naturally include
the activities of Kaar, the Less-Than-
Totally-Competent."
"An apt turn of phrase," said Oskin
Yahlei.
"Thank you."

The chamberlain could no longer con-
tain himself. He ﬂung himself at Shaa,
yelling, "Shut up, you, you and your
sniveling mouth, no one talks to Oskin
Yahlei in that tone of OOUP! -"
"Please excuse me," Shaa told the
suddenly prostrate chamberlain,
re-
moving his foot from his midsection.
He straightened up and gave a pleas-
ant bow in the direction of Oskin
Yahlei, restrained somewhat by the
pull of the chains around his arms.
"My apologies, Mr. Yahlei. Toadies, as
you said."
Oskin
Yahlei
clasped
his
hands
again behind his back.
His expres-
sion remained grave, without a hint of
amusement; clearly a tough audience.
"I have heard reports of your activities
in the past.
Perhaps these accounts
were in error.
Are you, then, merely
a jester, sporting with the good will of

those more powerful than yourself?"
"I think of it, rather, as a question
of attitude," Shaa said. "Ultimately, if
one dies, one dies; if one lives, one lives.
As long as one lives, one may adopt a
certain attitude toward things. I prefer
that which you see."
Oskin Yahlei eyed Shaa.
"I can
see that you have the potential of be-
ing thoroughly insufferable to have
around.
Still, if word-of-mouth is ac-
curate, you have your uses, and your
capabilities. This unfortunate affair at
Kaar’s palace, which I will most likely
have to handle myself - is it all your
fault?"
"I wouldn’t go quite that far," Shaa
said. "Yet, in all honesty, I must claim
some responsibility." The fact that Os-
kin Yahlei hadn’t rushed right off to
the palace to manage things, though,
raised a couple of possibilities in Shaa’s

mind.
Either things weren’t that se-
rious there, or were indeed already
under control, or Oskin Yahlei didn’t
really care that much what happened
to his puppet, Kaar.
If that was the
case, he might have decided that Kaar
had already served his piece. Perhaps
Yahlei felt it was time for him to take
charge of Roosing Oolvaya in a more
personal and visible form.
On the
other hand, he might have other, more
substantial problems to worry about at
the moment. Hmm.
"Hmm," said Oskin Yahlei musingly.
"Then you couldn’t have been the one
at Lake’s." He stared up at the ceiling.
Indeed, this is a personage with a lot
on his mind, Shaa thought, and one
with his own set of complexities. Shaa
was willing to bet he wasn’t a simple
necromancer, but what else could he
be? He radiated like a god, but he cer-

tainly didn’t project the personality of
one; gods were usually more decisive,
more forceful, more impressed with
their own attitude of arrogant superi-
ority.
And who was Lake?
As usual,
Shaa thought sardonically, it looks like
I’ve wandered into somebody else’s on-
going plot.
Oskin Yahlei looked back
down. "Why are you here, Shaa? What
interested you in Roosing Oolvaya, at
this moment, at this particular stage
of events?"
"I am here, in Roosing Oolvaya, be-
cause I had to leave Drest Klaaver in
some haste and decided to head east,"
Shaa said. "I am standing here with
you largely because of a curse and my
own unfortunately theatrical personal-
ity."
"What chance has there been of . . .
manipulation?"
Shaa had been asking himself the

same question.
There had been no
particular reason for a coup in Drest
Klaaver at that speciﬁc time. Some of
his luck, one way or the other, could
also have been stage-managed. "I try
to resist the concept of predestination,"
he said. "Still, like everyone else, I’m
always open to the possibility, though
I’m sure you know how difﬁcult it is to
tell."
"Quite so. Do you have companions?"
“I do indeed. Which ones are around
at the moment is, I regret, something
you may have to ﬁnd out for yourself."
"Be still," Oskin Yahlei said to his
suddenly restive troops. The members
of the Guard escort who were in Shaa’s
line of sight had the expressions of
those making longer and longer lists of
other things they had to do and other
places they had to be. "He is mine to
deal with as I wish."

Oskin Yahlei stretched out his arm,
pointing at Shaa with a middle ﬁnger
that bore a gold ring alive with tiny
lights and dark vortices of force, the
full emotive power that had ﬁrst hit
Shaa across the room again building.
"Shaa!" he thundered.
"My patience
ebbs!
I will grant you a choice!
You
know this choice! You will join me, or
face a terrible doom!"
So it’s a quick ally he’s looking for,
eh?
Shaa thought weakly under the
renewed onslaught. "Whether I’ve got
friends around at the moment or not,"
he said aloud, his voice less rickety
than the rest of him felt, and loaded
in fact with his most ominous air of
serious menace, "if I get hit with that
terrible a doom they’ll come after you.
For every one you inﬂict on me, you
will receive back ten. A terrible doom
for me will yield you a ruin of such

appalling devastation as to pale the
sane imagination." How’s that, buster?
he thought.
Their eyes were locked, Shaa’s two
with Oskin Yahlei’s crushing one. Os-
kin Yahlei moved his outstretched arm
around to the side, aiming it now at the
man who burned down buildings, who
was still quivering on the ﬂoor.
"See
the merest hint of your doom," Oskin
Yahlei said.
The man on the ﬂoor froze in mid-
quiver; it was as if he had been set
upon by a taxidermist between one
breath and the next.
A black gauze
seemed to ﬂow over his body. Then -
From the gate in the wall outside
came a sudden pounding, a hollow
rolling boom. Oskin Yahlei, an expres-
sion of extreme irritation on his face,
looked down at his prostrate chamber-
lain.
The chamberlain sprang to his

feet and dashed across the auditorium
to the outside door. Shaa noted with
dim satisfaction that the man was hold-
ing his side and running with a lurch,
rather than a steady stride. He disap-
peared through the door, then quickly
returned, now wringing his hands.
"Oh, master," he said in a low mum-
ble, barely audible to Shaa, "a man out-
side, with a staff. He demands to see
you."
"Someone from Kaar?" said Oskin
Yahlei.
"No, he, ah, he says his name is
Gasha-something, Gashalarahra, Gasha
-"
“Gashanatantra.”
"Yes, master, that was it."
Oskin Yahlei lowered his arm, his
mouth pursed,
his eyebrow raised,
lost for a moment in rumination. "So
he has come.
I will see him," he

said thoughtfully.
The chamberlain
took off again toward the door.
Os-
kin Yahlei started to stride after him,
then paused, sparing a glance over
his shoulder, ﬁrst at Shaa and then
at the Guard sergeant. "Fasten them
to the wall," he said to the sergeant.
"I will be back." He stalked through
the double doors at the side of the hall
and vanished from sight. The door to
the vestibule swung open again and
the chamberlain reappeared, leading a
new man, dark-haired and of medium
height, several inches shorter than
Shaa, wearing a dark-gray leather out-
ﬁt that looked considerably the worse
for recent wear. The man was also heft-
ing a polished hardwood walking stick.
The chamberlain indicated the double
door, the man sauntered in, and the
guards at either side swung the doors
closed.

Shaa let the soldiers drag him back
against the wall and rattle the chains.
He was thinking earnestly.
Could
that man be Gashanatantra?
The
Gashanatantra?
Not Gashanatantra
the Devious, surely not the mad plot-
ter himself?
But indeed, how many
Gashanatantras could there be? And
certainly no one in their right mind
would knowingly impersonate Gashanat
Gashanatantra, of all possible enti-
ties.
If I was looking for yet another
doom, Shaa thought, that one would
assuredly be quite low on my list. Gods,
fah!
- this was really much more up
Max’s line. If he were around he would
surely understand what was going on.
They were taking their time in there.
Shaa cast his eyes around the room.
Above the double doors at the far side
of the temple, cantilevered out over the
aisle and supported at the free edge by

three small pillars, was another room
with three large open windows over-
looking the auditorium space. As Shaa
glanced up at it, a shape ﬂickered in
back of one of the windows, just at
the corner, as if someone had taken a
quick peek out at the temple below. A
new complicating factor? - well, at this
point it probably couldn’t hurt.
The temple held no other features
of immediate interest. Under the cir-
cumstances, escape was looking like
a good idea, but with all the guards
around and the manacles on his hands
now holding him to the wall, simple
escape would be difﬁcult. He did have
an ace-in-the-hole. Unfortunately, the
ace was booby-trapped, courtesy of his
ever-popular curse, and with the treat-
ment he’d already received it was liable
to leave him in much worse shape than
if he merely tried to roll with events.

Shaa looked around again, hoping for
new inspiration.
"- What’s that?" one of the Guards-
men said suddenly. A faint shriek - a
clatter - a rapid sparking, snapping
ts’k-ts’k-ts’k sound - a blinding ﬂash
of white light from the windows of the
mezzanine room!
"My eyes!" wailed somebody close
by. Afterimages began to fade, images
returning to their normal colors after
the sudden white-for-black and black-
for-white, but then from the upper win-
dows came more lights, multicolored
lights, expanding spheres like bursting
bubbles of orange and blue, another
stark lightning-ﬂash!
The building
rattled. A giant groaning sound built,
rising out of the very ground, mount-
ing to a roar like an avalanche, like
mountains being ripped from the earth.
A plane of arctic cold settled down

through the room, leaving behind it
on the walls sheets of condensing ice.
As though surging ponderously into
sight from a great depth, something
began to take shape in the room on
the next ﬂoor, the force of its vexa-
tion slicing through the building like
a ﬂayed nerve.
The mezzanine win-
dows pulsed red and the wall around
them ﬂew apart, the pillars buckled,
the roof of the aisle cracked along its
length and began to drop toward the
ﬂoor, and several men around the room
were thrown tumbling by fragments of
smashed wall propelled like hurled
cudgels by the force of the superheated
gas.
Shaa squinted, trying to protect his
eyes; all around the auditorium the
guards and troops were crouching, cov-
ering their heads, glancing frantically
around. Ripped beams and fragments

of ﬂaming ﬂoor dropped in a sudden
rain.
From beneath the crack in his
screwed eyelids,
Shaa unexpectedly
caught sight of the shape of a man
in the middle of the falling wreckage,
cascading with the beams and ﬁery
brands, and not just any man, but a
strangely familiar ﬁgure.
The ﬁgure
twisted in mid-air and landed on one
knee in a crouch, shaking its head.
Another massive roar came from the
ﬂoor above, from behind the remains
of the mezzanine windows, ampliﬁed
by the fact that most of the wall that
had mufﬂed it before was no longer
there. The ﬁgure had dropped to the
ﬂoor right next to a cluster of Oskin
Yahlei’s troops; they started toward
him, drawing their swords and trying
to shield their heads at the same time.
Shaa was still surrounded by the sol-
diers of the Guard, several of them

now motionless or squirming on the
ﬂoor, the others trying desperately to
spot a way out. None of them were pay-
ing any attention to him.
He lashed
out with a leg; the nearest man ran
into it, folding his knee backward, and
lost his grip on his sword; and guard
and sword fell to the ﬂoor. Shaa shoved
the guard away. got his foot under the
sword, took aim, and kicked up. The
sword arched through the air. "Max!"
he yelled over the din.
The dazed ﬁgure had disappeared
from sight behind the ﬁve remaining
guards and their twirling swords, al-
though the guards seemed to be hav-
ing some trouble actually reaching
the spot where he had been.
As the
sword ﬂew overhead,
an arm sud-
denly stuck up from the pile, neatly
grabbed the hilt, and converted the
sword’s tumbling ﬂight into a smoothly

churning downward spiral.
Arm and
sword disappeared behind the guards,
Shaa heard the high-pitched "whoo-
whoo-whoo" of rapidly spinning metal
within the rest of the din, the guards
paused in their motions, and then, one-
two-three-four-ﬁve, all of the soldiers
seemed to ﬂing and jumble themselves
to the ﬂoor.
It was indeed, Shaa realized with
only the barest surprise (being long
accustomed to similar entrances by
his friends), Maximillian the Vaguely
Disreputable.
Max, apparently still
in the same motion, was letting the
momentum of the sword throw him
into a twirling leap over the falling
guards, when a giant ball of orange
ﬂame materialized in the hole in the
wall near the ceiling. The ball roiled,
the skeletal beams around it bursting
into ﬂame, and then a pair of glowering

eyes and a snarling mouth began to ap-
pear in red outlines against the licking
glare of orange and yellow. The mouth
opened. Max, still in mid-air, started
to curl into a ball, hiding his head,
when the mouth spoke.
A pressure
wave of superheated air shot through
with slashes of driven ﬂame slammed
across the temple. The ﬂoor collapsed.
All the furnishings in the room, the
dead or injured guards, the wall hang-
ings, and the airborne Max blew down
with the ﬂoor and were gone.
Giant
stones and ﬂaming timbers ﬂew. The
walls splintered and crashed out. The
scene spun, and then Shaa discovered
himself sprawled in a pile of smolder-
ing rubble, with his wrists scraped
raw and his shoulders half-pulled from
their sockets.
But the manacles on
his wrists now ended in loose dangling
ends of chain.

The hovering creature outlined by
the ﬂames gathered itself,
rearing
back, beginning a dive toward the gap-
ing hole in the ﬂoor, the shockwaves of
its unleashed power pulsing through
the air like ripples in a pond. The time
for reﬂection was past. Shaa staggered
to one knee and raised his arms.

Chapter16
THE DEN OF
OSKIN YAHLEI
“IT IS I, GASHANATANTRA,” I said.
The eye behind the viewing panel in
the gate of Oskin Yahlei’s complex
blinked, screwed itself shut, then wob-
bled slightly as it opened and ﬁxed
itself on me again.
"Ah, who was that?" the lackey said.

"Gashanatantra," I said, affecting a
note of testiness.
“Just a moment." The panel slid shut
with a rasp. I glanced up the street and
then down the street in the other direc-
tion. Still no Gash, and the trickle of in-
formation in the back of my brain was
silent, At the moment it looked like I
was on my own.
The gate clanked from the other
side and swung away from me. "This
way," the lackey said.
He was wear-
ing the same insignia I’d seen before,
the twisty purple rope braid against
a background of ﬂames.
I followed
him across a small courtyard, through
the open door in the front of the stone
building I’d examined from the street,
and through yet another open door
at the other side of an enclosed entry
hall. More guys with the purple badge
on their clothes closed the doors af-

ter us. On my right was a large open
room, the main worship-center of the
original temple no doubt. A bunch of
Oskin Yahlei’s troops and a squad of
regular guard spread out around the
place were eyeing me with a collective
look of surprise. The regular Guards-
men were holding the two chained
prisoners I’d seen them bring into the
building awhile before. Maybe the fact
that the two guys were still alive and
in apparently good shape meant that
Oskin Yahlei had shaken off the blood-
thirsty mood I’d seen earlier in the
evening at Carl’s, when he’d sucked
that magician down to a mummy. If he
had, I wouldn’t complain. The lackey
was pointing to the wall on my left,
where another set of double doors were
standing open.
I strolled up to them
and went through, and the doors were
closed behind me.

A ﬁre burned at the far wall, roar-
ing its way out of a massive walk-in
grate.
Hardwood panels lined the
walls and wood of a slightly lighter
grain ran in pegs and grooves on the
ﬂoor.
At my left in the corner of the
room, a circular staircase wound up-
ward.
Several leather-bound chairs
with high backs and ﬂuted armrests
were grouped around an area rug in
front of the ﬁre. Standing in the midst
of the chairs with his back to the ﬁre
and his arms crossed on his chest was
Oskin Yahlei.
"Gashanatantra," he said. His voice
had the same chilling boom, but he
wasn’t trying that trick with the black
aura, not yet anyway.
"Oskin Yahlei," I said.
I stared at
him for a beat, then lifted one eye-
brow and moved toward the chairs.
He fell back one footstep as I ap-

proached, watched me sink into the
most
comfortable-looking
chair,
his
mouth slightly open, and then reached
behind him to lower himself into an-
other chair across the rug from me. I
sat the iron-shod tip of the walking
stick on the ﬂoor between my feet and
rested my hands on the handle, the
ﬁngers interlaced. Oskin Yahlei and I
scrutinized each other.
"At last we meet," he said.
"Indeed," I said.
"Your aura is an aura of power, yet
you have not chosen a very inspiring
aspect, if I may be allowed the bold-
ness."
"You may," I said, "for the time being.
Later on we shall see."
I wouldn’t have believed it if I hadn’t
seen it myself - Oskin Yahlei swallowed
nervously. Oskin Yahlei. Maybe my in-
stincts hadn’t been totally bonkers

after all;
maybe Gashanatantra re-
ally was bigger fry than him. And he
thought I was Gashanatantra. One of
my early mentors had once told me,
"When you can’t think of anything
else to try, go for the most audacious
thing in sight. Then don’t give up. You
wouldn’t believe some of the things you
can get away as long as you keep on
the move."
In fact, I’d already made it past one
of my biggest fears. It had occurred to
me that I might walk through the door
and ﬁnd Gash himself sitting there,
having a pleasant conversation with
Oskin Yahlei.
"So," I continued. "You are trying to
set up a little operation for yourself."
"It is as you see. We must all have
our little operations."
"So they say," I said.
"Yet an op-
eration can be a delicate thing, with

many factors to consider. For one thing,
there is the question of turf, of setting
up one’s operation in territory that
belongs to another."
"I need no lesson in etiquette from
you, " Oskin Yahlei said. He was trying
to project a note of bravado, but frankly
I thought it sounded a bit hollow.
"Perhaps you do," I said, "judging by
your situation." For myself, I was try-
ing to make my speech patterns match
what I thought Gash’s might be like in
the present situation. It was turning
out not to be as hard as I’d expected.
and that worried me. I had a suspicion
that the metabolic link thing might be
warping my personality, too, by con-
taminating it with Gash’s own. "One
must be wary of irritating others," I
went on, "unless one is particularly
looking for a confrontation."
"This city is free ground. I have irri-

tated no one."
"Have you not?
Your ambition is
vast, your plots spreading, yet your
coverage of details remains faulty and
weak. You have no idea who you have
antagonized. You," I said, going with
my hunch, "you are improvising, with-
out the slightest idea of what you are
really doing."
"I owe you no explanations."
"Success is its own best explanation.
Unfortunately, even that is not an op-
tion in your case. Your position here
is becoming very shaky. Jackals gather
at your feet - do you not hear them?”
Now the gray of his face went two
shades paler. It looked like I was hit-
ting home, but I wasn’t even sure what
I was talking about. "There is still an
explanation," Oskin Yahlei said, "the
incompetence of Kaar notwithstanding.
A god must have a power base."

"A god."
"Yes.
A god.
You, Gashanatantra,
are certainly a god, but I, Oskin Yahlei,
am equally so a god."
I thought the way he put that was
pretty interesting, like perhaps he’d
only recently stepped up to being a god
himself. That was right along the lines
of the theory I had been starting to
develop. It was time for another part
hunch and two parts bluff.
"Indeed," I said. "Yet it is interesting
that you should set up your headquar-
ters in such a place, a temple once de-
voted to another god. It is interesting.
Indeed, no, disquieting may be a better
word. To appropriate the fruits of the
labors of one of your betters in such a
fashion hints of poor taste. Especially
so -" (here it came, my next big salvo) "-
when done by one such as yourself, one
so new to the brotherhood."

Oskin Yahlei frowned.
"It is said
that those worthy enough to take
power are worthy enough to hold power.
One holds power as one desires; this is
a tenet of the - brotherhood."
I leaned back and crossed my legs.
He’d gone for it, at least I thought he
had. "Yet do you know who you have
aggrieved by the taking of this temple?
Power is held by worth, yes indeed, but
also by the sufferance of one’s peers. It
is never good to seek their wrath."
". . .
Whose temple?" Oskin Yahlei
said. "And whose wrath?"
“The temple and the wrath are one
and the same. And the bodies in the
convenient storage area next door, the
cemetery of the temple, that you are
even now hoping to use to further your
pitiful plans - they are the same as
well. They belong to this same some-
one. They are a reserve of material for

such as you, for such as you but not
for you, yourself. You are," I said, now
really warming to my role, "you are a
clever upstart, clever but not wise, not
wise with the cunning of years and the
knowledge of your place.” I tried to put
a boom and the roll of dark thunder
into my own voice. "You wish to know
whose ground this is?
Then know
you for a certainty that this ground is
mine."
His jaw dropped, it actually dropped.
"But you - but this -"
"Mine.
And you use it by my suf-
ferance,
a commodity now growing
increasingly scarce." I shot a stare at
him.
Out of the corner of my vision
something else caught my attention -
the gold ring on the middle ﬁnger of his
left hand. The black aura that clung to
his form like a faint mist still seemed
tied to the ring: in fact, now that I

looked,
Oskin Yahlei seemed to be
wearing the aura in the same way he
was wearing the ring. Wearing it, not
generating it himself. The ring glinted
in the ﬁrelight as I started to shift my
gaze back away from it. Glinted - wait
a minute.
That wasn’t all.
The ring
was moving. The ring was twisting on
Oskin Yahlei’s ﬁnger, by itself, turning
slowly one way, then the other, trying
to gradually slide its way up the ﬁnger
toward its ﬁrst joint, screwing itself
deliberately off his hand.
Oskin Yahlei reached across with
his other hand and absent-mindedly
pushed the ring back down his ﬁnger.
I raised an eyebrow, and then he sud-
denly realized where I’d been looking.
He closed his good eye, the skin of his
face wrinkling around it in a grimace
of pain. "The ring," he said.
"Yes, the ring," I said. "Indeed, yes,

the ring. Tell me now tales of this ring."
"Why do you toy with me?" Oskin
Yahlei said, his eye still closed. "Issue
your judgment and let us be done with
it."
"I toy with you as is my pleasure.
Tell me of this ring."
He wet his lips. If he was operating
out of his depth, like I’d ﬁgured, then
by pretending to be one of the big boys
I’d suspected I might be able to intimi-
date him into going belly-up. By now I
was pretty sure he wasn’t really a god,
he was just an imposture. He wasn’t a
god, he was a necromancer, a human
necromancer, how competent I didn’t
know, but he sure wasn’t fast enough
on his feet to be too hot an operator;
he hadn’t run his game well enough
before, and he was folding too easily
now.
He’d gotten by so far through
bluster and ﬂinging his power around

when he knew there wasn’t anybody
else there who could ﬁght him, and
by cowing people into doing his work
for him. Well, now I’d managed to in-
timidate him.
I’d badgered him onto
the defensive, and as long as he stayed
there it looked like I might get out of
this thing in one piece. I might be okay,
that is, as long as he didn’t force me to
prove I was who I said I was.
"This ring," Oskin Yahlei said slowly,
"is mine."
"You may wear the ring, but that
does not make it yours. And do not tell
me it was a birthday present, either; I
have heard that one before."
He paused again, thinking.
I was
thinking too, or I’d have kept the pres-
sure on him.
If he wasn’t a god, the
big question at the moment was where
he’d gotten the power of a god.
It
looked to me like the ring was the key.

If somebody’s power was in their aura,
and the black aura that seemed to be
the manifestation of Oskin Yahlei’s
godlike abilities was tied to the ring,
then it was only logical to conclude
the ring was the source of that power.
The problem was, I didn’t know any-
thing about the abilities of the ring
itself, and only a little about the ca-
pabilities of Oskin Yahlei wearing it.
Eventually I was going to have to try
to take Oskin Yahlei out, me with only
Gashanatantra’s crotchety sword and
my own wits to fall back on, and I
wanted to have a better idea of what
I’d have to face.
"The ring passed to me only re-
cently," Oskin Yahlei said reluctantly.
"It was part of a deal, and now it is
mine. The ring ﬁts only one wearer, its
ﬁrst wearer, and its power becomes the
power of the owner. The power of the

ring is now my power. I am the one to
be reckoned with."
"You are not the one to decide that,"
I said. "You would match my power, my
power, against the power of a ring? Not
enough to be a fool, you must have lost
your reason as well."
"I meant no provocation. I seek your
pardon."
"We will see about that, too, when I
have heard the truth. You mention a
deal. There is more to this deal than
you wish me to suspect. Such a ring
is a greater reward than your cunning
would deserve. It must have been in-
tended for another, yes?"
"What are you talking about?"
"You know exactly what I’m talking
about." At least I hoped he did; I still
wasn’t sure I did. I was still pushing
the hunch and the bluff, but as I did,
something was starting to click. And

then I thought I had it.
Oskin Yahlei mumbled something to
himself. Then he said, "I cannot speak
of it."
"You mean you do not wish to speak
of it. You do not wish to speak, because
to speak you would have to tell of your
treason, your double-cross against the
one whose creature you are."
He looked at me, wheels turning in
his brain, and then suddenly his face
went even whiter and his eye snapped
open in shock and sweat burst out on
his skin. "You," he said. "It was you all
along. You were the one I never saw."
"The ring is not yours," I said in my
tone of ruin.
"The ring is mine.
This is why I
know you.
That is why I have been
here in Roosing Oolvaya, watching you,
seeing your plans, learning your fail-
ures, assembling your doom." Inside

I’d gone cold.
I was reacting to him,
making things up as I went along, fol-
lowing his hints and his lead, but what
I’d stumbled onto had the taste of truth.
Even if it wasn’t true, at the moment it
was enough that Oskin Yahlei believed
it. This thing with the ring had been a
real god’s plot in the ﬁrst place, and Os-
kin Yahlei the necromancer had been
working for him.
He’d been working
for him, but he hadn’t known the iden-
tity of his boss. Whatever the plan had
been, the ring was the thing the god
was supposed to get out of it, to help
him increase his own power no doubt,
except Oskin Yahlei had pulled a fast
one and kept the ring for himself. That
much I felt pretty sure of now.
The
leap I’d made was in saying that the
god Yahlei had been working for was
really Gashanatantra.
But it made sense.
Yahlei had

double-crossed Gash, and now Gash
was using me as his surrogate to track
down Yahlei. I was supposed to dispose
of Oskin Yahlei, and then Gash would
show up and pocket the ring, only 1
didn’t think it would be quite that sim-
ple. I couldn’t see someone like Gash
giving up the chance for a real meaty
revenge against an upstart menial like
Yahlei.
And I didn’t think the real
Gash was going to be too pleased if
he found out I’d gone impostor myself,
and that I’d confounded the insult by
ﬁguring out what was going on.
Even if I was wrong about Gash’s
role it only made things worse. Oskin
Yahlei could have been working for
somebody else entirely, and Gash had
merely stumbled onto the setup him-
self. In that case, whoever Yahlei had
double-crossed was still out there, and
I’d have not only one very powerful and

very nasty customer to contend with,
but two.
The one thing that looked certain
was the ring. Whoever was out there,
they’d want the ring. Oskin Yahlei had
said that the ring would only work for
the original wearer, but that was the
kind of restriction a smart technician
could usually get around; yeah, they’d
want the ring, all right.
Everybody
would want the ring. At the moment,
though, Oskin Yahlei had the ring, and
I had Oskin Yahlei.
But I didn’t want him to panic. If he
tried anything at all, anything desper-
ate, the chance that I wouldn’t be able
to handle it was excellent. I tightened
my glare on him.
"Yet you still may
have your uses," I said. "Your doom is
not immutable. I can avert the harsh
decree."
". . . You are still toying with me."

"No. I will give you your chance. You
will take it if you have the sense."
"What must I do?"
"What do you think? First, the ring."
He sighed.
"Yes.
Very well." He
grasped the arms of his chair and rose
reluctantly to his feet. "Will you have
me just yank it off, or will you allow us
more prudent precautions?"
"Since we are at our leisure here, pre-
cautions are a reasonable step. Make
no rash assumptions, though - remem-
ber that I know your perﬁdy. You are
on parole, and I will be vigilant."
Oskin Yahlei looked at me, his ex-
pression of sudden hope shadowed by
the cast of fear.
He gave a stiff nod.
"My workroom is up the stairs."
I rose from my own chair, taking the
grip of the walking stick in my right
hand. Oskin Yahlei moved ahead of me
toward the circular staircase in the cor-

ner of the room. I took a breath and
followed him.
My foot was on the ﬁrst riser and I
was beginning to allow myself tenta-
tive congratulation for actually pulling
this thing off when the skin under my
collar began to squirm.
Faintly, very
faintly, I caught the hint of a larger, dif-
ferent space, being perceived through
other senses than my own.
A new
awareness stirred in the back of my
mind.
I’d had a feeling a little like
this once in a jungle, when something
that had been watching me had looked
away, and then had suddenly turned in
my direction again. Maybe my senses
were sharper now than they’d been
earlier in the day or maybe I’d just
been something else; either way I’d
been afraid of this sensation. I didn’t
know how great my chance was of ex-
plaining to Gash why I was running

around impersonating him, let alone
telling him what I’d found out, but I
wouldn’t have bet more than an ool on
me, myself. I’d been hoping I wouldn’t
have to ﬁnd out. Unfortunately, all of
a sudden it looked like I wouldn’t have
the luxury of the choice. The presence
hovered there in the back of my mind,
watching, listening, waiting. The bit of
awareness that was trickling through
reeked of surprise - it couldn’t believe
what it was sensing. It couldn’t believe
what I was up to.
The wheel had just advanced, and
I had the unpleasant feeling I knew
who was rolling under the tread.
I
may have had Oskin Yahlei, but now
it looked like Gashanatantra had me.
The handle of the walking stick started
to vibrate in my hand.
My body was still mine, but who
knew how long that would last;
I

thought I was already feeling some
resistance in my limbs. I hurried my
next steps on the stairs. Oskin Yahlei
was almost a half-turn above me, ap-
proaching the exit to the room on the
next story.
"You wanted me to get
him, well, I’m getting him," I thought
desperately to myself.
"Do you have any idea of the full
power of this ring?" Oskin Yahlei said.
I mumbled something in response.
Oskin Yahlei paused and turned on
the steps, but by the time he could see
me I had managed to put on a stern
face, and the walking stick yanking my
arm in a spasmodic dance was on the
other side of my body from him.
He
stared down at me, I stared up at him,
and then he turned back and headed
up. I went after him. I was ﬁve or six
steps behind when the sword decided
to ﬂame on.

The fact that I’d thought Gash might
try to talk directly to the sword didn’t
help me at all. Sparks spraying on the
risers as the sword condensed out of
its cloud, the sword whipped my arm
up and around and threw me forward
in a lurch; I would have dropped the
sword, but my ﬁngers were locked in a
rictus around the hilt. Oskin Yahlei’s
head was already through the entrance
in the ceiling, his hand ahead of him
on the railing, not nearly far enough
ahead of me to get out of the way. His
head started to spin and incline down-
ward in my direction as he heard the
sudden whine of the sword, and then
my shoulder went into the back of his
knee. The sword cut through his arm
and into his side with a spray of shoot-
ing ﬁre, like hot metal being beaten on
a forge, and Oskin Yahlei began to fold
toward the ﬂoor.
His head snapped

hard against the solid wood railing,
ﬂipping him over, and the sword pulled
free with a wet slurp.
Something ﬂashed against the cor-
ner of my vision overhead, making a
quick szoop/sproing sound, but I was
busy with other things.
The sword
was moving in again.
Oskin Yahlei’s
body had fallen half on the ﬂoor of the
second story room, half stretched down-
ward on the stairs, and I was sprawled
along the upper steps across his legs.
I got my left hand braced against my
right forearm, trying to drag the sword
off its trajectory and embed it in the
ﬂoor, but it was no longer bothering
with distractions from the likes of me.
Ahead of my face, I could see Oskin
Yahlei’s drooping eyelid, the eye be-
hind lolling low in its socket. It focused
on me as the tip of the sword began to
scrape toward him through the wood

of the ﬂoor. His ﬂesh seemed to ﬂow
toward the blade in slow liquid waves.
"You are not Gashanatantra," Oskin
Yahlei said.
"No," I said around my clenched
teeth, "and you weren’t Death, either,
so maybe that makes us even."
The ring on his hand was spinning
frantically now,
a wisp of friction-
raised smoke rising from the ﬁnger
around it, and vague blue ﬁgures were
forming in the air above us. The black
aura was alive with shimmering high-
lights and eager snapping sparks. In
fact, tendrils of aura seemed to have
wrapped themselves around the sword
blade, pulling it closer.
I threw my
weight against the sword one last time
to force it back. Then all at once, as
I had known it would, the sword tore
clear of the ﬂoor and threw me to the
side and dove deep into the torso of

Oskin Yahlei. He made a horrible gur-
gling sound and went rigid.
"I’m sorry," I started to say, but be-
yond us in the room was a ﬂash of
motion and another unexpected voice
yelling over mine, "Don’t touch that
ring!"
My thought and my action came in
the same instant.
My thought was,
"Gashanatantra! He’s here!" My action
was plain. I wrapped my hand around
the gold ring and yanked it clear of
Oskin Yahlei’s ﬁnger.

Chapter17
COUNTERPLOTS
AND
COUNTERSPELLS
MAX
HAD
ASSUMED
something
would go wrong and had wondered
what it would be, but this was the
quickest answer he’d ever been hit
with. Blowgun and dart at the ready,

he watched Oskin Yahlei’s head rise up
through the ﬂoor at the top of the stair-
case, taking his aim on the emerging
neck. Another rapid footstep sounded
behind Yahlei on the stairs.
Without
warning, the whine of magical ener-
gies suddenly released burst up into
the workroom. Oskin Yahlei started to
spin. A fan of sparks spouted up the
stairs toward him like a fountain of
pink lightning, arching over his head
and out across the room, and a nim-
bus of ﬂame pulsing with the beat of
the whine swung up from behind, cut
through his right arm and into his
back, and hurled him toward the ﬂoor.
Max hesitated, then tracked the falling
Yahlei downward with the blowgun
and puffed.
Just as the dart left the
barrel, Oskin Yahlei’s head caromed
off the heavy banister and ﬂipped him
to one side; the dart shot through the

space where he should have been and
embedded itself in a beam.
So that was the way it was going to
be. Yahlei’s attacker had now appeared
through the ﬂoor himself, the sword in
his hand wearing its power like a blaze
of ﬁery pearls.
Max popped the next
dart into the blowgun. He was decid-
ing whether to go after Yahlei again or
switch to the new complication when
it abruptly became apparent that the
new guy and his sword were not in
agreement on what they were doing.
The sword was straining toward Oskin
Yahlei, but the man had gotten his left
arm braced under it and was trying
to force it out of the way and into the
ﬂoor. Through the rain of sparks, Max
could see the muscles standing out on
the guy’s arm and neck, his teeth were
clenched, and his face was turning red
with blood, but the sword was going to

win.
It was one of those lousy overmus-
cled enchanted swords with half a
mind of its own, and all of that mind
was bent on drinking blood and de-
vouring ﬂesh. It’s going to get it, too,
Max thought disgustedly, so goodbye
Oskin Yahlei.
That wasn’t the only
goodbye - Max was sure this was just
the kind of situation the Death in the
ring loved: hacking, pain, destruction.
He would be coming awake.
As long
as the ring stayed on Yahlei’s ﬁnger,
though, he couldn’t get out, and with a
little luck the conﬁnement spells Max
had ready could calm him back to qui-
escence.
Max dropped the blowgun
and made a pass with his hand, ﬂutter-
ing his thumb painfully over his wrist.
The blue spirals of the ﬁrst spell took
shape over Oskin Yahlei’s head.
Yahlei spoke, his voice little more

than a wet rattle. "You are not Gashana
Max heard.
The other guy’s response was even
fainter, but Yahlei was facing away
while the guy was pointed straight in
Max’s direction so the words carried
toward him. "No," the man said, "and
you weren’t Death, either, so maybe
that makes us even."
Oh, no, Max thought, not Gashanatan
is he around too? If this guy was tied
up with him, there was no telling what
he might do. In fact, Max realized sud-
denly, there was telling what he might
do, the idiot.
The sword pulled free
from the ﬂoor panel that had caught
it up and dug deep into Oskin Yahlei.
Oskin Yahlei stiffened, the black aura
rising off his skin like a hardening
shroud. The man leaned forward over
him.
Max was on his feet and around the

desk, yelling desperately, "Don’t touch
that ring!", his hands making fren-
zied passes and the blue conﬁnement
framework dropping toward the ﬂoor.
The guy didn’t hesitate.
He lurched
forward, grabbed Yahlei’s ﬁnger, seized
the ring, and pulled.
The ring came free in his hand.
A long yellow ﬁlament of lightning
jumped from Oskin Yahlei’s ﬁnger to
the ring and squirmed for an instant in
the air, smoke curling up from both the
ﬁnger and the ring. A ripple washed
through the black aura, starting at
the ﬁnger and spreading in a quick
expanding circle across the surface of
Yahlei’s body, as though the aura was
shaking itself loose from the skin. The
blue conﬁnement grid locked into place
around Oskin Yahlei. The grid had as-
sumed a lozenge shape formed of small
faceted planes, each ﬂat surface circu-

lating with whirlpool whorls, one face
now folding outward to encompass the
ring; tiny fuzzy marbles glowing with
blues and greens separated themselves
from the inside surface of the grid and
began to bounce around the interior.
The matrix closed on the guy’s arm.
The man still had the sword in one
hand and the ring in the other.
Nei-
ther object was quiet - a web of silver
electricity centered on the ring had
enveloped his left hand, illuminating
the bones with each coiling ﬂash, and
the sword held the other hand tight
in its grip as it fed on the ﬂesh of
Yahlei.
Max ground to a halt and
started madly throwing power into the
grid, trying to stabilize it, pushing the
next spell in the series to release. The
reaching appendage of matrix touched
the other man’s skin. Then - at the cir-
cle of contact - a sudden ZZZZ-NAPP!,

a powerful on-and-off ﬂash of incendi-
ary blue!
A backlash surge quivered
across the matrix and caught Max in
its force and threw him away from the
stairs into the desk; the edge of the
ﬁeld at the surface of the guy’s arm
swelled, turned white, and shattered.
Tumbling white shards cascaded down.
Max reeled back up and gestured
again.
What the hell had happened
there?
He sent a quick probe at the
guy, at the guy’s aura. The aura was
- huh? It was multiplexed. The man’s
own aura was overlaid and interwoven
with the master-wave and a set of lock-
lines and some other stuff he couldn’t
immediately recognize from the aura
of somebody else, from a somebody
else he did indeed recognize. So that’s
where Gashanatantra comes into it,
Max thought, new possibilities ﬂicker-
ing through his mind.

But the end of the matrix ﬁeld was
still open and the black aura was up
to something. From a look at the guy’s
aura, the matrix would never be able to
lock together in its strongest conﬁgura-
tion, through his skin - the aural lines
were too strong. Max hurled a modiﬁer
string. hoping the matrix would hold
long enough to encase Oskin Yahlei
and the ring and the other guy too.
The black aura was a molting sheath of
smoky vellum seen through the surface
of the blue lozenge, gathering itself
for a move. A new shaft of lightning
ripped from Yahlei’s ﬁnger toward the
ring, and then the sheet of aura ﬂowed
off his body and down the thunder-
bolt in a smooth wave. The lightning
darkened, the aura drew itself in, con-
densing and growing more solid as it
arched out, and the force of the leading
edge of the aura slammed dead center

down the bore of the golden ring.
WHOOOOMM!!
A blaze of elec-
tric white winked out from the ring.
The ﬂoor shook, things fell off the
shelves, even the heavy desk jumped
up and hopped a foot back as the light
fogged out vision like a sudden thick
cloud.
Max dimly saw the form of
the guy ﬂing out its arms and hurtle
backward down the staircase, all the
color washed from his body and his
front stained boiling white. The sword
pulled free from Oskin Yahlei and ﬂew
after him, beginning to spin end-over-
end as it left his hand, but the ring
held stationary in the air, its spinning
glow visible even through the haze of
Max’s ﬂash-blindness. Max staggered
back against the desk, ﬁghting to stay
on his feet in the pounding shockwaves.
The conﬁnement matrix was in shreds.
His second- and third-order vise-clamp

spells were ﬁghting their way toward
the ring but were already losing force;
they’d never make it on their own.
A black funnel spun out of the other
side of the ring. It was the black aura,
passing into the ring as a solid tube
and fanning into a vortex as it left.
Tracers of force leapt from the walls
toward the vortex, each giant spark
making the cloud pulse red or yellow
or green from its interior radiating
out, and sending lines of light whip-
ping around the surface like barrel
hoops.
Max grabbed control of the
third conﬁnement spell, fed it a new
shot of power from his metabolic re-
serve, and squeezed. The spell turned
a brighter blue and tightened on the
ring.
The tube of inﬂowing black be-
gan to narrow, Max gritted his teeth
and fed again, blue ﬂashed, and a
corkscrew kink grew in the tube as

the spell dug in further, fragments of
black ﬂaking off like spray from an
ocean breaker.
The vortex was now
the height of the room, surrounded by
expanding shock-spheres bursting like
bubbles, silver and orange and blue,
but in the midst of it something physi-
cal was taking shape. There was little
doubt what that was, or rather, who.
The form of the trapped Death was
coming through.
Max
held
the
conﬁnement
ﬁeld
steady and began to concentrate on
the link-phrases that would call up his
new coupling spell, the one he’d used to
ﬁght the eye of Oskin Yahlei with Kar-
lini back at the castle; if he swung out
with that kind of hyperenergetic slug,
it should be good enough to knock even
a Death into a manageable state. The
coupling intermediary unfolded itself,
a concave burgundy-colored plate with

moving tendrils on its back ﬂoating in
the air over the desk; the plate split
into its four smaller replicas, and –
Lightning ﬂashed again in the depths
of the roiling cloud.
The cloud now
ﬁlled the room, and in its core was a
mounting ﬁre condensing in a roughly
human shape.
Out of the constant
shaking, seemingly out of the earth
beneath the temple, an immense moan
grew, swelling into thunder.
A beam
cracked loose from the ceiling, began
to pivot down into the vortex, and
burst spontaneously into ﬂame.
Ice
had been congealing on the walls; one
roof-hanging icicle that had been grow-
ing with incredible speed directly out
of the air exploded in a billow of steam.
A feeling of dread ﬁlled the room.
In the heart of the ﬁre, a Presence
began to form.
Max abruptly decided he’d better

change tack - he’d never be able to ac-
tually get the Death back in the ring,
not at this stage, not the way things
were going; the only thing he might
be able to do was control the damage.
The Death was manifesting in an atti-
tude of extreme vexation, a very, very
dangerous condition indeed. The cou-
pling spell split again into its swarm
of tiny modules and descended toward
an ornamental skull on the desk as
Max reached out for the quiescence se-
quence of his programmed spell-chain;
maybe that could calm the Death down,
help him instantiate normally, instead
of -
A ﬁreball pulsed through the vortex,
the outer layers of cloud and all the ice
on the walls vaporized in a sudden fog
of dark steam, pieces of roof hurtled
upward into the night, coils of force
gathered, and the Presence reached

out. Max, ﬂying again through the air
caught in the force of the vortex, hit
the wall, bounced off, hit another wall,
and fell to the ﬂoor. Something burned
on his chest - his amulet! Silver lights
were racing across its surface. The tiny
sapphires and the few larger stones
and the big ruby had come ablaze with
color and were blasting twining shafts
of energy back out at the vortex. Now,
that’s interesting, Max thought.
And
then the Presence noticed him.
Max felt the ﬂail of its attention
shift in his direction.
This manifes-
tation of the Death had become an
essence consumed with frenzied rage
and moderated by only the barest trace
of sentience. As Max opened his mouth
for a last-ditch word of power, the thing
lashed out at him with ﬁre. The ﬂame
struck the energy shaft from Max’s
amulet.

A crack of massive thunder! - a ti-
tanic ﬂash of red!
- the ﬂame broke
against the ﬁeld of the amulet and
curled off to the sides (like a water
wave crashing around the prow of a
boat) and the impact of colliding ﬁelds
smashed Max backward as the wall
disintegrated around him, but Max
himself
was
impossibly
unscathed,
well, quite a bit singed actually yet
certainly alive; Max twisted (now in
mid-air), saw a split-second image of
onrushing ﬂoor and cowering guards,
the ﬂoor came up as it spun down to
its proper place, and Max collided with
it on one foot and fell to the other
knee in a crouch.
A pile of smolder-
ing wreckage dropped on his back. He
shook his head and forced himself back
to his feet, fragments of wood panel
cascading off him onto the ﬂoor.
The rubble had also fallen on the

Guardsmen he noticed next to him,
but true to form they had already spot-
ted him and decided he was someone
worthwhile to attack and were con-
verging on him with their swords. And,
also true to form, his own rapier was
buried somewhere in the ruin of the
upper room.
"Max!" said the voice of Zalzyn Shaa.
Max whipped his gaze up and saw a
sword spinning toward him above the
heads of the soldiers.
He ducked un-
der the lunge of the ﬁrst man, straight-
ened up with his left shoulder in the
guy’s stomach, lifting him off his feet
and throwing him backward into the
man just behind him, jabbed the elbow
of his other arm into the breastbone of
another soldier at his back on the op-
posite side, got his left hand on top of
the head of a fourth soldier, and used
that as a grip to help ﬂing himself into

the air. The ﬂying sword slapped into
his right hand outstretched above the
clamor.
His other hand was still on the head
of the soldier he’d used as a vaulting-
pole. Max pushed off clockwise as he
reached the top of his leap and began to
descend. His new sword traced a down-
ward spiral path, looping gracefully
but with remarkable speed around
the lunges and guards and attempted
slashes of the troopers, leaving a neat
trail of red outlined across their torsos.
The troopers fell, Max began another
leap over their declining heads in the
direction of Shaa’s voice, and -
A large ﬁreball burst out of the mez-
zanine workroom and paused over-
head, trailing orange jets like the tail
of a comet.
Waves of terrible heat
slammed out, the beams and the wall
and the ceiling around it exploding

into ﬂaming ash.
Within the blaze
of plasma, crude features appeared,
a pair of jagged eyes and a red sav-
age mouth. Max whipped his head in
and wrapped himself into a ball as the
mouth curled into a sneer.
The lips
parted.
A scorching wind smashed into Max
with the force of a lead hammer and
drove him into the ﬂoor, except the
ﬂoor itself had already blown through
from the pressure and was tumbling
into the basement. Something caught
at Max’s side, debris pelted him and
scraped him loose, he plunged again,
and as he opened one eye and got a
glance off under his arm (still in his
tucked position with his head sunk
onto his chest and his arms wrapped
around his head) he hit bottom, slid
two feet along an embankment, rolled
over an edge sharp with pointy stones,

and plopped into a stream of steaming
water. Disgusting water - the blast had
broken through the foundation all the
way into the sewer under the temple.
Flaming pieces of the temple ﬂoor were
striking all around, raising a constant
fountain of water that vaporized in the
hot air.
Max got his nose out of the
water to breathe, trying to assess his
health and collect his thoughts, but
then with another massive rumble a
new mound of debris appeared over-
head, silhouetted against the yellow
storm of ﬂames in the building above,
the pile of debris (surely an entire wall
at least) expanded in his vision and
grew huge, and then the stuff dropped
full along the line of the open sewer.
Max’s personal protection ﬁeld had
done pretty well for him so far - it
couldn’t ward off everything, but it did
mean he was only bruised and bloody

and in moderate pain rather than to-
tally pulped. How it would fare against
the equivalent of a major avalanche,
though . . .
As fast as he could, Max
spoke a preconjured word reserved for
signiﬁcant emergency. Energy drained
from his body and slammed into his
shield as the rubble descended.
The
ﬂaming avalanche caught him and
threw him into the sewer wall, crush-
ing him into the stones, and then the
weight and the force were dragging
him down, down beneath the level of
the water, down to the bottom of the
sewer bed, down into the muck, mash-
ing the air from his lungs, pinning him
to the rock without a hope of move-
ment.
Dimly, through the rushing
in his head, he heard the roar of the
Death far above. His awareness began
to ebb.
Max tried to concentrate - surely

there was still some way out!
- but
all his mind would focus on was the
mess he had left up above.
The pro-
cess of recorporation had gone about
as badly as it possibly could. Instead
of having all the Death’s personality el-
ements instantiate in concert together,
the component of wrath and rage had
seized control, with all the power of
a Death at its disposal.
There was
no intelligence there now, and the only
consciousness was the desire to destroy.
Such
cases
were
occasionally
men-
tioned in the texts: the Frozen Dunes
covering a hundred square miles on
the southern hemisphere continent of
Zinartica where a city-state had once
stood were supposedly the result of one
of them.
The situation was bad, it was very,
very bad.
They were dealing with a
mad god. And the man upstairs on the

ﬁring line was Shaa.
Shaa raised his arms. This was ex-
actly the kind of mess he tried to keep
himself out of; it would cost him, there
was no doubt about that, the only ques-
tion was how much. Again, the curse,
Shaa thought, that damnable curse.
But there was no help for it. That
was Max down there.
The chains holding him to the wall
had come apart but the manacles were
still on his wrists.
Shaa bent secon-
daries from the wild energy sheeting
out of the temple, established a forcing
function with a muttered sentence and
a small sweep of his ﬁngers, added the
modiﬁer for iron.
Field lines formed
over him in the air, intensiﬁed as they
swung past his shoulders,
glowing
blue-green, and funneled like water
through a ruptured dam into the man-

acles. His skin underneath the mana-
cles stung, and then with a soft tenta-
tive cracking the metal, dropped past
freezing into the supercooled, split and
fell past him to the pavement, sizzling
in the night air. It had taken an extra
second he could ill afford but hopefully
would be worth it; Shaa knew it would
be easier to just get the cuffs off than
to contain the feedback from the iron
interacting with his aura.
The temple in front of him was en-
gulfed in ﬂame, and the street was full
with a rabble of faltering guardsmen
and men wearing purple pretzels. The
arsonist who’d been brought in with
Shaa sprawled on the ground nearby,
hands still manacled behind his back.
Through the gaping hole in the wall
and past the sheet of ﬁre Shaa saw a
churning mass of hovering ﬂame, now
sporting eyes and a ragged mouth and

dark reaching talons.
Either Oskin
Yahlei’s true form has been unleashed,
thought Shaa, or something very pow-
erful doesn’t like him.
The patterns
of the thing’s aura boiled as well with
ﬂames of the mind, blistering images
rolling in insane torrents, snatches
of personality jumbled with memory
and intellect, all tangled together in a
searing ﬂood.
Which meant the thing might react
on an instinctual level. Shaa stretched
out, carefully shaping the motion of his
hand. The aura was rotating madly in
the ﬂames, not as any kind of neatly
woven matrix but with arching loops
and whorls and trailers that shot out
to the sides and dangled free in the air,
torn dead-end straws from a busted
basket. Shaa selected a bristle patch of
trailers, nudged them around toward
the main mass, felt for their common

frequency. With a complex pass of his
other hand, a cigar-shaped cloud of
matrix symbols pulsing and rippling
in a complex compound beat sprang
up around the trailer patch. The cloud
and the trailers began to resonate
against each other. Coils of dizzy ﬂame
spun out from the oscillating surface.
Shaa gritted his teeth and pushed,
and the trailers and the attached cloud
jammed into the main mass of the aura
of the thing.
The recoil threw him clear across
the street into the wall in front of the
opposite house.
Even without direct
contact he felt the irritant grow, felt
the Presence notice it and try to swat
it away, and felt a titanic roar as the
now-fully resonating ﬁeld expanded
out into the rest of the aura.
Shaa
pushed himself into the ground at the
base of the wall. He felt a blast of heat,

the leaves of the tree over his head
ﬂared and burned, and the remains of
Oskin Yahlei’s temple house exploded,
sending chunks of ﬂaming wreckage
out across the city. He felt a dark roil-
ing shape burst upward, writhing in
upon itself, and head for the river.
He’d been lucky - the principle of
economy of force had worked.
If the
Presence, certainly a god gone mad,
had been operating on anything higher
than a basal level the maneuver would
never have worked;
creatures with
their intelligence intact were usually
able to ignore a hotfoot.
If that side
of his luck held, the thing wouldn’t re-
member who Shaa was when it calmed
down.
On the other hand, his breathing
was labored, much too labored, and the
pain in his chest had the force of the
weight of an elephant behind it.
He

coughed, and noted a ﬁne spray of pink
froth. A hand helped him to his feet.
"Wow, man, that was really some-
thing," said the man who burned down
buildings with a note of professional
respect.
Shaa shook off the hand and took
a staggering step toward the temple.
The heat singed him even across the
street. The sound of the ﬁre matched
the roaring in Shaa’s own head.
"I
have a friend down there," he said.
The surface of the rubble heaved in
the ﬂames and settled further.
"Hey,
man, I’m an expert," said the arsonist,
"listen to me.
There ain’t nobody in
there no more.
This is something I
know."
"You don’t know my friend," Shaa
said. He tried to raise his arm, got his
hand to the level of his chin. The arm
was much heavier than it should be,

and the crushing pain in his chest had
moved up to include the shoulder.
A
ﬁre-retardant ﬁeld, that’s what I need
ﬁrst, he thought.
He tried the ﬁrst
step, the equation for a ﬁre-relevancy
matrix. The breath froze in his chest.
He fell backward into the grip of the
arsonist.
"You don’t look so hot," the man said.
"All white and gooey."
"Let me down," Shaa said.
It was
worse than he had thought.
It had
gone beyond congestive heart failure
this time.
His use of magic, tied by
his curse not only into his general
metabolism but directly into the car-
diovascular system, was giving him a
full-ﬂedged heart attack.
It looked like I’d really, ﬁnally blown
it.
I yanked off the ring, and with
a shock like knives driving straight

through my skin the thing seemed
to weld itself to my ﬁngertips.
The
sword Monoch had my right hand and
now the ring had my left, and a mag-
ical ﬁreﬁght like I’d never seen was
breaking out directly in front of my
nose. I couldn’t follow it, things hap-
pened that quickly.
Lights exploded,
winds blew back and forth; the black
aura got up off Oskin Yahlei like its
own living creature, ﬁghting its way
through the strange blue cages that
dropped around it, and then the blue
cage was after me, too, ﬂowing over my
hand holding the ring. Hello, Gash, I
thought, are you there?
I didn’t get an answer and the sword
didn’t want to help either, it was too
busy gorging itself on Oskin Yahlei, but
then the blue cage closed on my wrist
with an electric shock down to my
bones, stopped by itself, and suddenly

fell apart. The man who’d startled me
into thinking he was Gash fell back,
rallied himself, and launched another
attack. I didn’t take it personally, in
fact I was glad for the attention; in the
few seconds that had passed I’d real-
ized a couple of important things. The
black aura had been locked to the ring
until I’d let it out, and it was going to
cause everybody a lot of trouble unless
somebody got it back in. Wherever he’d
popped up from, that’s what this other
guy was trying to do. Probably he even
knew what was going on. Hopefully I’d
survive to talk to him about it, since I
had a feeling the aura in the ring was
going after me ﬁrst.
I was trying to ﬁght back myself, but
the ring was ignoring me, the sword
was ignoring me, Gash had gone to
hide under a rock someplace, indeed
the only thing that seemed to be notic-

ing me at all was the black aura, which
was throwing itself straight through
the ring toward my face. Forces tried
to tear my ﬁngers loose from the bone.
That was when the world turned white,
a giant blast WHAAAMED!! into me,
the ring ripped loose from my hand
leaving pieces of my ﬁngers still at-
tached, and I was tumbled backward
down the stairs, trailing a column of
acrid white vapor from the front of my
body.
I hit the banister and spun in
the air, something caught me square
across my upper back, something sur-
prising soft and yielding, and all of a
sudden I was sprawled upside down
with my feet waving over my head,
tangled in the ripped fabric of one of
Oskin Yahlei’s overstuffed armchairs.
Monoch made a cartwheel across my
vision, clanged against the stone ﬂue of
the ﬁreplace, and dropped somewhere

behind my head.
I struggled to my feet, having to fall
on the ﬂoor ﬁrst to manage it.
He-
lices and ﬂaming balls and the sharp
ﬂashes of released energies were still
rolling down through the top of the
staircase.
I was aware of the blood
ﬂowing down my left hand and the
ﬁery mass of bruises along my front,
but I wasn’t going to let a little pain
stop me now.
The man ﬁghting up-
stairs was my big hope for getting
loose from Gashanatantra.
If I was
going to get him to do that, though, the
thing he had to do ﬁrst was deal with
the aura I’d set loose from the ring. I
grabbed up the sword Monoch with
my right hand. The sword was more
sluggish than usual - it tried to do
its turning-my-arm-inside-out number
but its heart wasn’t in it; all it really
wanted to do now was lay around and

digest.
"Shut up and cooperate," I
growled at it, and I was just starting
toward the stairs when the wall into
the temple and that side of the ceiling
fell in.
I dove to the ﬂoor and covered my
head as the rest of the ceiling burst
into ﬂame from above.
It occurred
to me, irrelevantly under the circum-
stances, that the din of destruction was
very faint in my ears; I wondered if one
of the close blasts had blown out my
eardrums. A rain of debris was falling
into the temple. In the middle of it I
spotted the magician from the room
upstairs now on the temple ﬂoor, in the
process of cutting down a group of sol-
diers with a sword. Again I got my feet
under me, favoring my hand and body,
and lurched across the heaving ﬂoor
toward the temple.
I took two steps,
a third, and then the sword abruptly

leapt out to the side and jerked me
toward the circular staircase.
"What
are you -" I yelled, but as I started to
yank Monoch back my eyes ran along
the line of the pointing blade and fell
on the thing smoldering ahead at the
bottom of the steps, trailing a dying
funnel of green magic. It was the ring.
The ﬂoor under my feet was pitch-
ing madly, and whole sections were
ripping free and disappearing to some-
where below. "Okay," I said to Monoch,
"there’s the ring. What am I supposed
to do with it?"
It suddenly occurred to me that if
the ring didn’t actually come into con-
tact with my ﬂesh I probably wouldn’t
set it off.
One of the armchairs had
slid across the ﬂoor into reach and was
caught up against a dangling beam
torn loose from the ceiling. I gingerly
grabbed a torn piece of satin fabric

with my left hand, gritting my teeth
at the raw scraping on my torn ﬁngers,
parted the remaining threads, leapt
a widening chasm, and landed at the
base of the stairs, dropped the cloth
over the ring, held my breath, and
picked the satin-wrapped ring back up.
The ring was warm and mobile in
the cloth but showed no inclination to
attack. I tied a quick rough knot and
eased the bundle into my pocket, then
turned back to the temple.
In the brief moment it had taken me
to snatch up the ring, almost the entire
temple ﬂoor and large sections of the
walls had disappeared, and the frac-
tures in the ﬂoor had spread almost to
my feet. The magician in the temple
was gone, and the guards he had been
ﬁghting, and what seemed like half
the remaining structure of the tem-
ple was cascading after them into the

basement.
A swooping ball of ﬂame
dominated the airspace, leaving ﬁre
behind it in the air and on the walls
and dancing along all the remaining
wood I could see. Peals of harsh roar-
ing thunder were echoing through the
rush of the ﬂames.
In the smoke and heat it was getting
difﬁcult to breathe, but every obvious
exit was blocked by ﬁre. Every possible
exit except one - the basement space I
could see through the holes in the ﬂoor
was still dark. It looked like the ﬁre
hadn’t started to really burst down-
ward yet. I hooked my arm around a
protruding bearing beam now stripped
clean of its ﬂoor panels and swung
myself down.
Light from the ﬁres trickled through
and I had some glow from the sword
Monoch as well, certainly enough to
move with.
I clambered onto a long

canted section of boards that had fallen
and landed intact, still together in
their original assembly, and scurried
ahead.
A good person-height sepa-
rated my head from the level of the
temple ﬂoor but I bent low, trying to
balance the need to hurry to escape in-
cineration against the requirement of
evading the notice of the ﬂame-thing.
The stone ﬂoor of the basement had
fractured where I could see pieces of
it beneath the rubble.
The bramble
of beams approaching on my left had
come alight with spreading ﬁres, so I
steered right, dropping further to the
ﬂoor and easing myself under a groan-
ing heap of wall listing over on the
other side. My next footstep landed on
an apparently solid piece of stone ﬂoor,
my weight shifted, and the stone gave
way. I slid after it, fell free through my
own height, and landed up to my hips

in a channel of moving water.
Another giant wail exploded from
above.
I looked up, and was just in
time to see the ﬂame-creature burst
upward through the roof and arch
away into the sky. Over me on all sides
was a solid curtain of ﬁre. It was well
and truly time to get the hell out, and
the sewer I’d fallen into was the best
route I’d spotted so far. I hadn’t seen a
sign of the magician who’d confronted
Yahlei, but he had to be down here
somewhere too; hopefully he was not
only down here but still alive as well.
Right ahead of me sticking out of the
water was a large mound of wreckage
with small tufts of ﬁre at its top.
I
moved toward it.

Chapter18
REPERCUSSIONS
AT LAST, thought the Lion of the
Oolvaan Plain as he bounded up yet
another ﬂight of stairs, leaving behind
him yet another trio of guards sinking
slowly to the ﬂoor, the blood of dripping
swords. The business had started as a
pain-in-the-neck, but now he was into
the good part: he hadn’t had so much
fun since the last time he’d knocked

heads in a bar ﬁght on a trade mis-
sion to Drest Klaaver.
The Lion had
come around to the admission that his
runt son Jurtan had not done badly.
Of course, it had taken the satisfac-
tion of killing or maiming a dozen or
two of Kaar’s guardsmen to put him
in the proper frame of mind, but after
all what were guardsmen for anyway?
And ahead of him now at the top of the
stairs was the door to Kaar’s private
apartments.
Jurtan’s father leapt powerfully up
the steps, taking them two and three at
a time, twirling his nicked and dented
sword in absent spirals at his side. He
reached the top, landing on both feet
with a powerful THUD that shook the
short balcony. In front of him was the
door. At the other end of the balcony,
cowering intelligently against the wall,
were four guards. The Lion bared his

teeth at them and growled. One of the
guards grinned weakly back at him
and tossed something across the ﬂoor.
It was a key - the key to Kaar’s door.
The Lion’s snarl widened.
He strode
across to the door, kicking the key con-
temptuously out of the way, planted
one booted foot on the ﬂoor, and raised
the other sole-ﬁrst. His mighty thews,
though slightly stiffened these days
through lack of sufﬁcient use, nonethe-
less strained, his whole body contract-
ing forcefully, his foot exploded against
the door, and with a giant CRASH-
RIIPP!! the lock tore completely loose
from the heavy wood panels, part of
the stone door frame disappeared in
a sudden cloud of gritty dust, and the
door smashed open. The Lion sprang
after it into the room.
The antechamber was the receiving
room of the Venerance.
The far wall

held a wide expansive window looking
west across the river and over the city:
the curtains were open. In front of the
window was a large desk. At the desk,
with his back to the door, gazing out
at the city, sat the slight, rather sal-
low form of Kaar, his head propped on
his hands. "It was Oskin Yahlei," Kaar
said quietly. "Oskin Yahlei made me do
it."
"Then he’s dead meat too," snarled
Jurtan’s father. "Who the hell is he?"
"I think you’re going to be a little late
for him."
The Lion looked up, following the di-
rection of Kaar’s gaze.
With the cur-
few and the late hour, Roosing Oolvaya
was quiet, the dark broken across most
of the city only by the glow of the oc-
casional street-lamps. Near the north
wall the situation was different. A low
hill and the surrounding neighborhood

stood out in powerful reds, bright as
the light of day, in the heat of a foun-
tain of ﬂame twisting high into the air.
"That’s Yahlei’s place over there," Kaar
said. "I don’t know what he is, not re-
ally, but from the way he killed my fa-
ther and trapped me I know he’s just
oozing with power. Anybody who could
hit him like that -" Kaar nodded out at
the scene "- is bound to be even worse."
A ball of ﬁre rolled upward from the
tower of ﬂames and arched out over the
city. The ball was leaving a dying trail
behind it in swooping, looping curls,
and the trail only emphasized its path:
toward the river, toward the Palace of
the Venerance, toward the Lion and
the watching Kaar. The ball swelled in
their vision and took on added detail.
"Sorcery, damn it," snapped the Lion.
"There’s always sorcery, I hate -"
"Look," Kaar said, "if it’s all the

same to you, I’d just as soon you kill
me before that thing gets here.
I’d
rather face a sword."
Jurtan’s father scowled down at him.
Kaar didn’t seem half the oaf he re-
membered. If he was telling the truth,
it sounded like he’d learned something
from his experiences.
The old Vener-
ance was gone now, and the place still
needed somebody in charge.
Maybe
Kaar wouldn’t be a bad choice after all.
On the other hand, he’d kept the
Lion penned up in the dungeon for
days. The Lion raised his sword.
"That’s strange," Kaar said.
"It
seems to be stopping."
The Lion looked back up. Kaar was
right. The ball of ﬂame, now over the
river channel between the docks and
their position, had bent around in a
tight circle low above the surface of the
water. It cast a sullen red light across

the river swells. The window glass rat-
tled in its frame. A low wind began to
rise.
"Look, fellow," said the man who
burned down buildings, "you’ve got to
get away from here. This whole neigh-
borhood could go up."
Shaa, lying full-length on the ground
with one hand pressed to his chest, his
head propped up against the base of
a wall, was breathing with difﬁculty
through his open mouth.
He opened
one eye, looked up at the arsonist, and
nodded.
He reached up an arm and
the arsonist pulled him to his feet. The
entrance to an alley was visible just to
the west along the street. They began
to stumble toward it.
"What’s the matter with you, any-
way?" the arsonist said.
"We receive the dooms we know,"

Shaa said testily. His ankles felt boggy,
"What dooms? What are you talking
about?"
"When I conjure." Three words, Shaa
thought, and I’m out of breath. What a
mortifying condition. He started again.
"When I conjure, I am inﬂicted, with
a backlash. Proportional to the, mag-
nitude, of the work." He put a hand
against the building wall at the en-
trance to the alley, leaned over, and
panted. "Unfortunately," he managed,
"that isn’t, the whole curse."
The arsonist was already almost lost
in the shadows deeper in the alley, but
Shaa could see him pause and turn his
head. "What do you mean, that’s not
the whole curse?"
"There’s a part, that involves, my sis-
ter."
"ZALZYN SHAA!!"
The voice came out of the empty air

over the arsonist’s head in a powerful
hollow echo. The arsonist clapped his
arms over his head and fell over into
a pile of trash. A ﬂight of pigeons be-
hind Shaa in the street ﬂoppered into
the air.
Aargh, Shaa thought.
What
timing, what wonderful timing.
"What is that?" wailed the arsonist.
Shaa sagged to the ground, propping
his back up against the corner of the
building. "Eden. My sister."
"ZALZYN SHAA!!" A cornice cracked
and dropped to the cobblestones, shat-
tering into dust and shards of chunky
plaster,
"Uh, thanks for getting us out of
there and everything,” muttered the
man who burned down buildings, strug-
gling to his feet. "but I’m gonna take
off now." He broke into a run and van-
ished down the alley.
"WAS THAT A FRIEND OF YOURS

"Purely a matter of, circumstance,"
Shaa gasped. "How’s the family?"
"THEY ASK ABOUT YOU," Eden
said, "WHEN THEY WANT TO AN-
NOY ME." A row of windows overhead
exploded out in a liquid cloud of twin-
kling ﬁrepoints.
Shaa waited for the crashing and tin-
kling to settle themselves out against
the roar of the spreading ﬁre down the
block.
He took a deep breath.
let it
out slowly around the giant hand in his
chest.
"If you keep this up, Roosing
Oolvaya may sue you, for renovation
costs."
"THEY’RE WELCOME TO TRY.
BY THE LOOKS OF THINGS YOU’R
DOING PRETTY WELL IN THAT
LINE YOURSELF .
"There’s no need, to act so implaca-
ble. Why not sit down, have a drink,
or a bowl of hot soup, or something."

In a sudden gust, a ﬂurry of leaves
from the street and a cloud of ash blew
past Shaa into the alley. ’That’s curi-
ous," Shaa mumbled. The leaves were
going in the wrong direction.
Things
emanate out of the contact point, he
thought, they don’t blow into it. Then
he realized that the gust was not due
to Eden, it was a new, different wind
starting to come up.
"FEELING
RATHER
POORLY,
AREN’T YOU."
"You know the curse."
"YES," said Eden, “I DO INDEED.
WHAT MADE YOU DO IT THIS
TIME?" The voice thundered along
the narrow conﬁned space. Houses on
either side of the alley lurched against
each other, sending pieces of fractured
facade crashing down onto the piles
of trash.
The wall jerked at Shaa’s
back and shoved him sprawling into

the street. Behind him, the wind was
growing into a actual howl.
"That isn’t your wind, is it?" Shaa
said.
Eden paused. "NO," she said, "IT’S
NOT. JUST WHAT IS GOING ON
THERE?"
"A mad god. I think we’re about to
see, what he’s going to do next.” Shaa
took another breath.
"Look, Eden,
you’d better get on with it, if you still
want to have a live victim to harass."
Linked to the curse that incapacitated
Shaa whenever he used magic was an
additional kicker. Shaa and his sister
were cursed to being enemies, and to
mounting raids on each other when-
ever feasible. It wasn’t usually feasible.
Eden could only detect Shaa when
Shaa had activated his power for some
conjuration, and when she couldn’t de-
tect him she generally couldn’t attack.

On the other hand, that also meant
that Eden was able to pounce on Shaa
when he was at his weakest. He had
never been quite this weak before, ei-
ther.
It was a ﬁne arrangement, for fam-
ilies who liked such things;
in the
society where they’d grown up, inﬁght-
ing and internecine discord were the
glue of basic social interaction.
For
Eden and Zalzyn Shaa, though, there
was one problem. They’d always liked
each other.
"CONTACT IS SLIPPING. CRZK
GRZZ
INTERFERENCE!
KNKK
ZGRZT TAKE THSTZZ!" What was
Eden trying? They had found loopholes
before, but the Curse Administrator
was very sticky about letting curse-
parties get away with anything; he
was fairly implacable himself.
Light-
ning crashed in the direction of the

river.
A seagull screeched overhead,
then swooped down out of the darkness
and landed next to Shaa. It waddled
up to his face and eyed him.
Shaa
eyed it back. Eden’s voice at the con-
tact zone said something completely
unintelligible. Then a globule of milky
white looped unexpectedly out of the
contact-point, dropped toward Shaa,
and burst.
"What’s that?" Jurtan said suddenly.
"What’s what?" said Tildamire. She
dropped her end of the ﬁnal Guard
trooper they were dragging into a
storeroom and straightened up.
The
man’s head fell back and thudded onto
the stone ﬂoor.
Jurtan had an arm
out, supporting himself against the
doorframe, and was staring with a
blank look into space. His mouth was
sagging.

"It’s the music, it was going along
kind of hopeful and zingy and then out
of nowhere it picks up these low deep
shuddery organ chords, oom, oom, oom,
oom, ooom, Just getting lower and
lower and slower and slower. I mean -
I mean the music’s mostly shaking, it’s
too low to even hear right, more like an
earthquake with rhythm than music
with notes.
"It feels like something terrible’s
about to happen."
The sheer level of destruction was
the only thing that saved Max.
The
roaring built in his head as the weight
of the collapsed wall ground him into
the rock, the water surged over his
face, he tried to move his hand in a
gesture of power but the rubble held
it pinned in its place. Then, suddenly,
with an abrupt slurping sound, the

water ebbed.
Max coughed, a desperate racking
cough, sucking dusty air into his lungs
against the pressure of the debris on
his chest. The impact of the rubble on
the sewer had opened a chasm in the
facing stones, letting the water and
sludge drain away into a cavity in the
earth.
And not a moment too soon,
either. Max’s mind began to clear.
Far overhead, he felt a terrible pres-
ence lift - the Death was taking off.
Shaa must have been able to do some-
thing. That would be a great (if tem-
porary) help to Max and the rest of
the neighborhood, but implied nothing
good about Shaa’s own probable state.
The Death was still in the vicinity, too
- Max could feel him out there some-
where, radiating his mad anger - and
somebody was still going to have to
deal with him.
Unless another use-

ful person unexpectedly showed up to
take on the job, that somebody was
going to have to be Max; at least he’d
have to try. Of course, Max had a more
immediate problem: the ﬁrst thing he
had to do was get out of the building
before he got crushed or fried from the
approaching ﬁre, or both.
He might
be able to blow the rubble off with
magic. If he was able to manage that,
though, it would drain his already
stretched power reserves most of the
way to nothing. That was not a very ap-
pealing status in which to think about
facing a Death.
Wait a minute - Max thought he
heard
something
upstream
in
the
sewer, something that wasn’t just the
sound of subsiding temple. It might be
a guard - it probably was a guard - but
he ﬁgured even that was worth a try.
"Hey!" Max yelled. "Who’s out there?

Somebody’s alive in here!"
Shadows moved through the rubble
in the rough shape of a person, thrown
toward him by the light of the leaping
ﬂames. "What?" Max heard vaguely.
"Get me out of here, you nincom-
poop!" From the direction of the person,
Max saw a sparking spray of different
light, the source long and solid - the
form of a sword. "You with the sword!"
The wreckage settled with a groan,
wiping out the reply. Max wasn’t sure,
but he thought the man was starting to
tear at the rubble. "What?" Max yelled.
"Say that again!"
"Were you the guy upstairs?"
"Yes, I was upstairs! Were you the
one who ambushed Oskin Yahlei?"
"Yeah," the voice said reluctantly.
It was growing stronger.
A clatter, a
rumble, and the wood shifted further.
A beam started to bend itself across

Max’s right knee.
"Hurry up out there or I’m going to
crack a leg!" Max said,
"I’ll working as fast as I can."
"No, you’re not Use the sword, idiot."
"The sword?"
"Yeah, the sword, the sword in your
hand.
A powered sword like that
thing’ll slice through solid rock."
"Oh." The light swung wildly, mak-
ing a full bass whining sound that
turned suddenly to the screech of rip-
ping wood.
So the guy didn’t know how to use
his own sword.
Not that surprising,
actually, considering the trouble he’d
been having with it before. "Come on,
already!"
"Let me concentrate, will you? There’s
ﬁre coming down my neck!"
"Yeah," Max said,
"mine too." A
small pile of wood chips stirred just

above his head and slid onto his face.
Max shook his head, eyes closed,
and most of the wood fell off. When he
opened his eyes again. a new hole had
opened on his left, and in the hole was
a hand. "Oh-kay," Max said. "This is
more like it. Nice to see you. Just hold
up that large beam on your left and I’ll
try to ease out of here."
"Not so fast," the guy said. "If I let
you out, you’ve gotta help me too."
"What do mean, I’ve got to help you?"
"I’m in big trouble. I’ve got this prob-
lem with Gash -"
"I
don’t
believe
this,"
Max
said.
"Don’t tell me about your big trou-
ble! Whatever it is, your big trouble is
worth about half a thought at the mo-
ment after the mess you’ve started."
"The mess I’ve - hey, do you want to
get out of here or not?"
"Look, idiot, this is all your fault."

"What are you talking about? It was
the gods.
When gods start meddling
around -"
"Don’t give me that!
The gods are
always everybody’s convenient excuse
for things they’ve screwed up by them-
selves."
"Yeah, sure. The only free will I’ve
had lately is whether to cooperate with
Gash and maybe die or try to walk out
on him and certainly die."
The ﬁre was burning closer, and the
beam was settling further onto his leg.
The help Max was getting from his
protection ﬁeld wasn’t going to last
indeﬁnitely.
Max glared out at the
guy, lying full-length along the twisted
path he’d cleared, his form silhouet-
ted against the ﬁre and lit from the
side by the glow of the whining sword.
Max took a breath and forced himself
to speak calmly, "You let him out. You

know who I’m talking about, the Death
in the ring, and you let him out. The
ﬁrst thing you’re going to do after you
get me out is help me get him back un-
der control before he pulverizes your
city. Then I’ll help you with whatever
your problem is. Got it?"
"Okay," the guy said quickly, "that’s
a deal.
Let me hold that beam." He
reached to his left along Max’s leg, got
his arm under the wood, and started
to strain at it. The pressure lessened.
Max had freed his left arm while they
were arguing:
now he’d managed to
squirm it down the narrow passage to
grab a handhold against the rocks. He
pulled with his left hand and pushed
with his right, felt his legs slide, catch,
slide, and hold up at the foot.
"One more time," Max said. The man
heaved, a warning rumble sounded
from above, Max gave a pull and a

twist and a forward scramble, and
then he was free of the hole and scrap-
ing along past the guy and then out
of the guy’s passage entirely into the
open ﬁery air. Behind him the debris
was visibly settling.
Max spun, got
the guy by the foot, and yanked. The
guy came free with a "Yeow!" and Max
shoved him to his feet.
Over their
heads was a solid curtain of ﬂames.
"This way," the guy said, "down the
sewer."
The water level was climbing again,
now over Max’s ankles. "Downstream,"
Max said. "Here, look." He scrambled
onto the pile of debris.
Next to the
wall of the sewer the pile was lower,
with the ﬂames above them and still
off to the left.
Favoring his right leg
and fending off the wall with his right
hand, Max clambered onto the rub-
ble and looked ahead.
Fifteen feet

further down, the roof of the sewer
resumed, unbroken, with a clear hole
underneath it for entrance. Max took a
breath and charged. Flame fanned him
on the left, wood and stone shifted be-
neath his feet, and then he was sliding
through the hole into the open space
of the sewer. The sewer bed was thick
with mud and sludge but only a slowly
rising trickle of water was making it
past the jam upstream; steam rose
from the walls from the heat of the
ﬁres overhead. There were, Max was
glad to see, no zombies in sight. The
tunnel ran a gentle downward course
as the north hill sloped down toward
river level, and a hundred feet or so
further along was an access cover. Max
stopped underneath it.
The guy pulled up next to him. "Who
are you?" he said.
"Max," said Max. He looked back up

the access shaft, then paused. There
was something else strange about this
guy . . .
he concentrated, closed his
eyes, and then suddenly he had it.
Max put his hand up and touched one
ﬁnger to the guy’s temple.
"What are you -"
"What is your name?" Max said, us-
ing the Voice of command,
A shudder ran up the guy’s body. He
made a gargling sound in his throat. "I
-," he said, "I, uh, I - augh!" His head
ﬂopped to the side and started to jerk.
"All right, forget it, relax," Max said,
dropping the Voice, "there’s no time for
this anyway. Didn’t it ever occur to you
that somebody’d slapped you with a
spell of namelessness?"
The guy was moving his head around
with a dazed look, but his acute dis-
tress had faded. "A spell of what?"
"What it sounds like.
Hides your

name, keeps anybody around you from
noticing you don’t have one and that
they’ve never asked you about it. Here,
push me up this thing.”
The guy held out his hand, Max
stepped on it,
grabbed a handhold
overhead, and went up the short ﬂight
of rungs cut into the side of the shaft.
"What did you just do to me?" the guy
said.
"No time," Max said. "We’ve got to go
ﬁnd my friend Shaa -"
"Who’s that?”
"- Zalzyn Shaa, who saved your neck
too, back up there, and who I’m sure
is now in very lousy shape as a result,
and then we’ve got to take care of the
Death you set loose, and we’ve got to
do that before he gets his act together."
Max reached the top of the shaft and
put his hand on the cover, The cover
was heavy, as usual, but unlike an or-

dinary cover this one was vibrating,
almost shaking in its frame. Dust and
a roaring whistle sifted down through
the cracks in the wood.
The cover
drummed against Max’s hand as he
applied his strength to it, and then his
shoulder too.
"I’m gonna need a score-card before
this thing is ﬁnished," the guy below
was muttering, following Max up the
ladder. "Look, Max, about this name-
lessness thing - you might as well call
me, ah, the Creeping Sword, at least
for -"
The cover lifted, wobbled once back
and forth, then lifted itself bodily and
ﬂew off to the side out of view. A ﬂurry
of leaves rushed down over Max’s head,
and behind them the force of a wind
growing toward a howl.
Max rolled
himself out of the shaft onto the street.
Lightning ﬂashed behind him in the

direction of the river.
In the sudden
light-burst, Max could see a mass of
churning
clouds
overhead,
forming
themselves into a giant wheel-shaped
bank centered somewhere toward the
wharves.
He struggled to his feet
against the kick of the wind.
The
head of the other guy - the Creep-
ing Sword, aargh!
- appeared at the
exit to the shaft and glanced around.
Max leaned into the wind, wrapped
his hand around the guy’s tunic, and
yanked him onto the street.
“The Creeping Sword?” Max yelled
over the wind. “You got to be kidding!”
“Hey,” said the guy, “looks like I
need a name and that one’s just sitting
around, okay? I know nobody’s using
it.”
Nobody in his right mind would
dare, Max muttered. I think I like the
namelessness better.
But enough of

this for now - "You’re gonna have to
ﬁnd Shaa yourself!"
"What about the plan you were just
talking about?!" the Sword yelled back,
coming to his own feet.
"It’s out of date, damn it!" A tree
branch whipped past and down the
street, followed by a tumbling ovoid
door.
"This is what I was afraid of!"
Max had his eyes slitted and one arm
out, like a blind man feeling for a
handrail: there were purple curlicues
around his ﬁngers.
The pillar of ﬁre
that had been Oskin Yahlei’s base was
a block or two behind them in the di-
rection they’d come and beyond the
crest of the hill, the ﬁre being torn
into long leaping shreds by the wind.
One of the ﬁery streamers looped to-
ward the ground south of the Yahlei
temple and further away. In an explo-
sion of orange sparks, a new coil of

ﬂames erupted from someone’s roof as
the streamer lashed back into the air.
Suddenly Max grinned.
"Eden, I love you!" he yelled into the
wind.
"What?" said the Creeping Sword,
his mouth next to Max’s ear.
"It’s Shaa!" Max said, "you can’t miss
him! He’s got some kind of beacon on
him, someplace in the street near Os-
kin Yahlei’s!"
"Just a second! Where are you going
and -"
"Wherever the center of this thing
is!" Lightning ﬂashed again; this time
it was deﬁnitely over the river.
Max
turned to go.
The Sword caught his shoulder. "If
this Shaa guy is such a good friend of
yours, why aren’t you getting him?"
Max spun, struck the man’s hand
back, then somehow had a full grip

with his own hand around the Sword’s
neck, the other hand forcing back his
sword arm, was holding him several
inches off the ground, and was shout-
ing up into his face. "Are you planning
to be helpful, or is the only thing you’re
good at being difﬁcult? You want any-
thing left of your city?
You going to
tell me you can take care of this mess?"
Lightning crackled behind Max.
The
Sword’s eyes, drawn past Max toward
the lightning, went wide.
Max ﬂung
him to the side and spun again.
Visible now in the constant ﬂicker
of the lightning, spinning slowly in
the air midway between the island
of the Palace of the Venerance and
the wharves, over the major navigable
channel of the river, was the ghostly
image of a towering castle.
Max ground his teeth, bent over the
Sword, pulling him to his feet, and

stuck an accusing ﬁnger in front of his
nose. "You ﬁnd Shaa and you keep him
alive, you hear me? Anything happens
to Shaa and you’re going to feel like
Gashanatantra was your best friend
compared to the trouble you’re going
to have with me! Wherever you go I’ll
ﬁnd you, get the idea?" Without paus-
ing for a reply, Max turned again and
broke into a run, wobbling in the still-
mounting wind, heading east toward
the river.
Shaa, he thought, damn it, Shaa.
But with the power reserves in the
castle to draw on, the Death might be
unstoppable, that is if the Death man-
aged to get to the power stores.
The
only person who might be able to stop
the Death before that was Max (even
if Max hadn’t done too well against
him back there in the temple), unless
there was some other useful character

wandering around he hadn’t encoun-
tered yet, and what were the chances
of that? My best friend against my god-
damn sense of civic responsibility, Max
thought, and the whole thing probably
a lost cause anyway; so what else is
new. A funnel tube had emerged at the
hub of the wheel of cloud, the lightning
dancing up and down its walls, and
the funnel was reaching downward
toward the river.
Max paused at an
intersection, letting a tangle of wooden
crates and a large bush blow past him
down the cross street, then staggered
ahead. Just as he reached the center of
the street the wind suddenly redoubled
with an even louder howl. The force hit
Max and lifted him off his feet, ﬂung
him ten feet to his right and into the
side of a house, and as he started to
slide to the ground the world abruptly
ﬁlled with sound, the sound of a vast

hollow clang that rolled on and on
like the boom of a twenty-mile-wide
sheet of hanging metal.
Karlini had
not exaggerated, Max realized as the
waves of sound pummeled him from
above and the ground surging in reso-
nance pounded him from below, the sky
was indeed ringing like a solid metal
dome that someone had just struck
with a rod ten miles long.
At least,
Max thought, this may make Roosing
Oolvaya notice that something rough is
going on.
The massive gong died away into
head-stufﬁng echoes.
Max struggled back to his feet. That
removed one problem, anyway - Max
had been trying to decide whether
to expend a chunk of his remaining
power in warning Roosing Oolvaya
that it was a reasonable idea to take
cover, but he didn’t think there was

much he could add to the much more
convincing demonstration of the gong.
In fact, it also removed another prob-
lem - the problem of how Max was
going to stop the castle from coming
through. The answer was simple. He
was too late, too far out of range, and
the emergence cycle was too far gone
with its own momentum. It couldn’t be
stopped. And the castle was material-
izing smack-dab over the middle of the
river.
Screams and cries were erupting all
around, with torches being lit and peo-
ple ﬂinging open windows and other
people beginning to run madly into
the streets.
Max cut around a man
wrapped only in a sheet gazing with
his mouth open to his chest in the di-
rection of the river and pounded again
toward the wharves. The tallest tower
of the hanging castle was solidifying

dramatically, color and substance ﬁll-
ing it like paint spurted on a window
from behind.
The entire castle was
accelerating in its counterclockwise
spin and starting to settle toward the
water. Lightning ﬂashed, then a large
jagged cluster of it struck high up on
another tower, the blue-white energy
clinging to the surface and writhing
its way down the walls like a madly
creeping bramble-bush. A red glow lit
the rock foundation of the castle from
underneath.
A woman ran past Max in the op-
posite direction, yelling, "To the roofs!
To the roofs!" with a great deal of good
sense. In fact, Max suddenly decided,
as the whole expanse of the castle cur-
tain wall congealed and the wave of
crystallization spread out across the
rock, there was no longer a moment to
lose. Just ahead of him along the street

was a four-story building, shop on the
bottom ﬂoor and residence areas above,
the fourth-ﬂoor windows ﬂaring with
candles and the light of another torch
sparkling on the roof. Straight behind
the rooﬂine was the center of the spin-
ning cloudbank alive with the strobe of
lightning, and the sinking mass of the
castle.
The wind had now begun to ease.
Max reached the building,
jumped
onto a shuttered windowsill, caught
hold of a protruding half-timber above
his head, and clambered upward to-
ward the roof. It was really amazing,
Max reﬂected, how after a while you
stopped paying attention to injuries
when things got serious, assuming of
course that you hadn’t actually bro-
ken anything critical; he’d started off
the evening with a torn-up arm, as
events had progressed he’d picked up

more burns and ﬁre damage, a mess
of deep bruises, a badly strained leg,
and maybe even a few cracked ribs and
a ripped muscle or two, and yet here
he was, still swarming straight up the
side of a wall. You do what you have to
do, he thought, or at least you try.
The streets that had ﬁlled with peo-
ple were now just as suddenly empty-
ing again. Max reached the top of the
wall and swung himself out around the
eave.
Ahead of him at the center of
the sharply peaked roof was a small
roof deck surrounded by a sturdy wood
railing.
Although his sword had dis-
appeared somewhere into the jumble
of recent events, Max had retained his
climbing-cord. He slapped out his knife
and snapped in a dart, stretched out
his arm, and activated the mechanism
on his forearm; the springs sproinged
softly, the dart arched up along the

roof, and with a rapid woosh woosh the
dart-end of the cable wrapped itself
tightly around the roof deck railing.
Max belayed the cord around his waist
and walked it up the slope of the roof.
Three adults in night-clothes and
a small child occupied the deck, a
lantern on the ﬂoor and a trapdoor
open at their feet, the harsh wind
ripping at their garments. Their atten-
tion was totally focused on the river
ﬁfteen blocks ahead. Through the oc-
casional gaps in the buildings Max
could see a ﬂickering violet haze over
the sea-wall and the wharves; at least
somebody had energized the ﬂood de-
fense ﬁeld. Gaps were showing in the
clouds overhead and the lightning in
the hub of the wheel was losing force.
A last spray of glowing colors ﬁlled
out a row of crenellations on the spin-
ning castle, the rock at the castle’s

base (already below Max’s eye level)
inexorably closed on the surface of the
water, a tall breaker splashed froth
on the upstream face, and as the rota-
tion of the castle brought the dripping
rock around toward the city, Roosing
Oolvaya seemed to draw its breath in
one giant collective gasp.
Then - a
massive SMACK, SMACK-SMACK-
SMACK of swells slapping along the
underside of the castle became an even
heavier rumble, a smooth mound of
water lifted in a ring all around the
castle, growing tall, huge, above the
castle’s rock base, above the curtain
wall, above the lower battlements, the
top of the mound breaking into churn-
ing foam and starting to curl; and with
the greatest THUD!!
and THUMP!!
and screeching grind of all the castle
dug itself into the riverbed and its mon-
ster wave rushed ashore in the midst

of the wharves.

Chapter19
THE CASTLE OF
DEATH
THE BUILDING BEGAN TO QUIVER
the rooftop vibrating up and down
underfoot
in
a
staccato
drumming
pound that grew louder and stronger
with great speed.
Max had wrapped
his arms around the railing and had
planted a ﬁrm stance on the ﬂoor, an-

ticipating the shaking and not wanting
to be distracted from the spectacle if he
could help it; if he was going to die, he
was going to die, but either way it was
going to be quite a show. The wave hit
the wharves already traveling faster
than the gallop of a seasoned horse, a
vast dark form alight with the glow of
foam and the trapped reﬂection of ﬁre-
light from the city, lifting far above the
warehouses, higher than Max’s van-
tage point, higher than anything else
in Roosing Oolvaya, eight, nine stories
tall, potentially ten or even more.
It
plowed through the mass of packed
ships and straight across the wharves
without a hesitation, carrying barges
and tall-masted river schooners and
keelboats and dock pilings together
into its thundering wall as if they were
all merely sailing into a bank of thick
mist. The top of the wave, now racing

slightly ahead of the main body, had
formed a solid mass of whipping foam
cascading forward as a tube. Then the
wave’s leading edge swept up past the
base of the wharves into the line of
violet on top of the seawall.
Roosing Oolvaya’s ﬂood barrier had
locked into its full-strength conﬁgura-
tion as a dense violet web spun like
extended ﬁshnets along the riverfront.
Suspension cables woven through its
matrix bound the web to pilings of a
deeper glowing purple that rose up
every ﬁfteen feet out of the seawall,
making the whole assembly resemble
a bridge slung on its side.
The pil-
ings were buttressed from behind by
long thick struts driven solidly into
the foundation rock; it was a durable
and resilient barrier indeed. Of course,
the ﬂoods it had been designed for gen-
erally rose slowly and not in a single

crashing surge, and since the highest
ﬂood tide ever recorded in Roosing
Oolvaya had only reached a level of
two stories, the barrier had been ex-
tended upward to a generous height of
three.
The expanding circle of the wave
plowed into the long barrier net ten
blocks south of Max and spread imme-
diately north and south from there in
a fast rolling tower of exploding spray.
Max could feel the power of the secon-
daries kick in as the web snapped tight
against the incredible hurled force of
the water. The net stiffened, strained,
stretched, bowing backward to try to
take up the shock; sections began to
yield as the supporting columns ripped
free from their underpinnings or sim-
ply snapped clear through at the roots;
and at a spot twenty blocks south and
then another ﬁve blocks north the over-

stressed web parted completely, letting
the wave rush clean through the shred-
ded breaches. The tall crest of the wave
poured over the top of the barrier as
spillage over a dam and rushed ahead
into the streets.
But the greatest mass of the wave
was at its base, and its greatest force
as well, and against this the barrier
was doing its job - holding back, fend-
ing off, retarding the internal phase
synchronization,
reﬂecting the reso-
nance of the water back into itself and
rearward into the river - so that in
the half-second of delay the wave had
its bottom cut out from under it and
spread out backward, converting the
single towering mound of water into
a surge that was indeed still tall, still
mighty, still crushing, but now more
elongated and dampened, with much
of its grandest energies spent.

The
ground
lurched
violently
as
the ground-borne shockwaves passed
them, jerking the rooftop perch for-
ward and back in a continuous quak-
ing spasm.
A building a few blocks
straight in front of Max toppled into
its neighbor and both spun together
out of sight. Off to the side other build-
ings were falling too, as the boom and
crash of the approaching water beat
against the ears. A repeating whoosh-
whOOOM!, whoosh-whOOOM! sound
suddenly explained itself as a manhole
cover rocketed into sight at the top of a
geyser spout, propelled by the pressure
of the bore of water bashing through
the sewer under the street. Whoosh -
the water jetted on through the sewer
channel - WHOOM - the next access
cover streaked up into the air at the
head of another fountain column. Then
the ear-ﬁlling rolling bellow seemed im-

possibly to double in its force, and the
wave burst around the corner in front
of them.
Three stories tall and capped by
a ﬁerce mound of glimmering foam,
its churning face thick with tumbling
wood and pieces of rock and (there for
an instant and just as quickly gone)
the complete hull of a small boat, the
wave came roaring down the street. To-
ward Max - its angry top just below his
line of sight - around him - in a sheet of
thrown spray thick as a sudden cloud-
burst - smashing through the building
- with a giant creak and hop and stag-
ger that knocked Max back against the
railing and spun him to his knees - and
miraculously past, ﬂotsam spinning in
its wake and the level of the ﬂood water
slowly subsiding. Spume made looping
patterns in the slack behind the crest.
I
CHARGED
BACK
UP
THE

HILL through the howling wind, look-
ing for this Shaa person.
Between
Gash and Oskin Yahlei and now Max
I was wishing I’d picked up something
safe and simple when I was a kid, like
glassblowing maybe,
rather than a
sword and a curious mind.
At least
Max was gone for the moment, and Os-
kin Yahlei seemed gone permanently,
and Gash was keeping quiet wherever
he was. A big shock knocked me to the
ground with the sound of a giant bell. I
rolled, got up again, rounded a corner,
and found myself down the block from
Oskin Yahlei’s ﬂaming temple.
All the Guardsmen who could move
had long since scattered, leaving a few
huddled shapes behind them on the
street. Flames had made the leap to a
building on the next block downwind,
and to another one a block or two fur-
ther on as well. Fires didn’t bother me

at the moment; I ﬁgured that that cas-
tle dropping into the river was going to
send up a splash big enough to put out
a volcano. I was looking for a beacon,
Max had said. I trotted up the street,
glancing around. Just past the glow of
the Yahlei ﬁre I spotted it.
The
buildings
ﬂanking
the
alley
where I’d stashed Carl Lake had par-
tially collapsed. I didn’t see Carl, but
I did see the body of a man lying on
the ground in the street just across
from the alley entrance. The form was
covered by a whitish-yellow glow cling-
ing to its contours. More of the glow
made a half-dome shape in the air over
him, starting at his head and popping
over in a low arch to end barely beyond
his feet. The man inside had his eyes
closed and was breathing with some
distress through his open mouth.
I
recognized him. He was the same guy

I’d seen being held prisoner by Oskin
Yahlei’s guards when I’d bluffed my
own way through with my imitation of
Gashanatantra. "Are you Shaa?" I said
to the man.
One eyelid creaked open, and the eye
rolled up and found me. "Zalzyn Shaa,"
he said, in a low voice that merged into
a wet cough. "Though only marginally,"
he managed to continue, "at your ser-
vice."
"Your friend Max sent me to ﬁnd
you."
"Ah," Shaa said. "Then please help
me prop myself against that wall."
"What about this glowing thing?"
I hadn’t wanted to touch it; I’d had
enough with magic already to last
another ten years, especially magic I
didn’t know anything about.
"Don’t worry about the ﬁeld," said
Shaa, "it won’t bite.
It was a gift of

sorts."
"If you say so," I muttered. I stowed
the sword Monoch without complaint
on its part, got my better arm under
Shaa’s back, feeling nothing more than
a mild tingling as I slid it through
the glowing dome, and dragged him
through the mounting ground tremors
over to the building. When I stood up
the prickling feeling was still there in
my arm.
Beneath the tingle, though,
my hand (which had gotten a lot of
punishment in the last few hours) was
feeling surprisingly better.
"Is this
thing some kind of healer?" I said, ﬂex-
ing my grip.
"Unfortunately my system is resis-
tant to curative spells," Shaa said. He
sounded a lot better sitting up. "The
ﬁeld seems to be more along the line
of an energy transfuser, in addition
to its attribute of attracting searchers

to the vicinity." He coughed and spit
up ﬂuid. "Just what is going on down
there where you came from?"
The wind had died away while we
were talking.
I couldn’t see the ﬂy-
ing castle from our location, but from
the roaring and general pandemonium
coming from the direction of the river
and drawing closer fast I could make
a pretty fair guess.
"This big castle
popped up over the river and dropped
in. I think we’re hearing the sound of
the wave coming after us now."
"Hmm," said Shaa. "Fortuitously we
are on a hill.
I assume the mad god
summoned this castle?"
"Mad god, Death, yeah, I guess so.
That’s what Max ﬁgured."
"And he proposes to deal with it him-
self?"
"He did seem to have that idea," I
said. "He was pretty testy at the time

we met, or I might have been able to
talk to him more about it."
"Indeed. I take it you are not actu-
ally Gashanatantra?"
"Gash -?" Oh, right, he’d seen my en-
trance at Oskin Yahlei’s. "It’s kind of a
long story."
"I propose we let stories wait until
after the wave," Shaa said, and he was
right, because sure enough the wave
was in the process of showing up. The
street rumbled like a herd of giant
buffalo were pounding up it, a cloud
of spray and mist erupted out of the
Yahlei ﬁre and the heart of the ﬁre
withered into steam, fountains of wa-
ter shot straight up out of the sewer
covers, and then around the corner and
up the street came the wave itself. It
looked like most of its force had already
been spent on the lower sections of the
city, but it still had enough momentum

to spill up the hillside and wash gen-
tly over the two of us there at the top,
leaving debris scattered behind it on
the street. I held Shaa out of the surf
as the top of the water tugged at my
knees.
"Things must be pretty bad down
there," I said.
"What remarkable insight," Shaa
muttered.
I was about to say some-
thing else when I heard a sudden
spasm of coughing and splashing be-
hind us in the alley.
"Oh!" I said. "Carl!" The water was
ebbing. I dropped Shaa back against
the wall and bounded over him.
A
shape was ﬂopping like a long carp
tangled in a mound of debris ten feet
into the alley. I splashed through and
ﬁshed it out. It was indeed Carl Lake.
When Carl had ﬁnished coughing up
enough water to go back to breathing,

he looked up at me. "Thank you," Carl
said, "unless you have merely returned
to ﬁnish your job?"
"I did what I had to do and you know
it."
Carl coughed again, glaring up at
me. "May I join you?" he said to Shaa.
"It is a long wall," Shaa said.
Carl plopped himself down next to
him. "My head is in extreme pain," he
said to me in an accusing tone.
"Maybe we’re even, then."
"Hm," said Carl.
He looked across
the street, at the wreckage of the tem-
ple. What was left of the water on the
street was now mostly foam. "The rea-
son for our conﬂict has passed with the
passing of Oskin Yahlei, yes?"
"Yeah," I said, "I guess so. But -"
"I must interrupt," Shaa said.
"I
regret the necessity of my own inac-
tion when there are important things

to do,
yet you who are not really
Gashanatantra,
on the other hand,
have no such excuse."
"What?" I said.
Shaa raised one eyebrow.
"Primus,
for you to pass yourself off as Gashanata
before Oskin Yahlei, you must have a
high level of effective power. Secundus,
your quite interesting aura supports
this thesis. Tertius and higher, since
from my reading of the situation you
probably had a lot to do with that same
situation in the ﬁrst place, you know
full well where Max is going and what
he’s going to try to do, and you can
further ﬁgure out that he will need all
the help he can get. Now, are you the
man of action you appear or merely a
worn-down counterfeit?"
"Max told me to stay here with you.
He said if anything happened to you,
he’d -"

"Your solicitude is warming," Shaa
said sarcastically. “I am thankfully in
better shape than Maximillian feared;
at least I am not acutely dying. Under
the circumstances, your friend Carl
and I can protect each other for the
time being." Shaa cocked his eyebrow
at Carl; Carl nodded. “Protect, that is,
considering that with a mad god on the
loose Roosing Oolvaya itself may not
be here much longer."
I didn’t like being a pawn, but on
the other hand the situation was what
it was; at the moment their plot was
more urgent than mine.
"All right,"
I said, "I’m going. But if your friend
Max tries to wipe me into the land-
scape somebody’s gonna pay."
"Don’t worry," Shaa said, closing his
eyes. "Whatever happens, someone al-
ways pays."
THE MASS OF THE CASTLE

rose sheer from the dark river deep in
the heart of the current. Waves still re-
ﬂected back from shore to shore, ruined
wharf-front to castle stone; the waves
were still tall but no longer monsters.
Ice sheathed the base of the castle,
sparkling strokes of ﬂash-frozen spray
cast up from the breaking river swells
leaving their crisscrossing tendrils far
up the walls.
The castle shuddered
and eased itself a few feet further into
the muck. A large cake of frost peeled
off the north wall and fell back toward
the water, the high plumes from the
splashes immediately freezing again
against the super-cooled stone.
Each
avalanche of tumbling icicles cast its
own ghost-light streamers on the tow-
ers as it dropped, cold transparent
refractions of ﬂickering green and blue,
and the crackling of the ice and the
pound of the turbulent river and the

massive ﬁdgeting of the castle and the
cries from the city made a huge rolling
groan that rose up into the sky.
The castle had stopped its rotation
as it settled into the river bed. It rested
now at a slight angle off the perfectly
level, with perhaps a ﬁfteen degree
inclination out toward the wharves.
Sourceless lights had appeared be-
hind walls and deep within the towers,
red and blue and purple, illuminating
various details of the castle:
back-
lighting a jagged crenellation here,
the curve of a cylindrical spire there,
the span of a free-ﬂying arch high up
on a downstream pinnacle.
As if the
mere presence of the castle was not
strange enough, part of its structure
was indeed still in motion.
A small
cylindrical tower capped by a peaked
tile roof jutted out from the side of
another, taller tower, with a vantage

point out over the water and down
past the curtain wall. Rather than be-
ing attached ﬁrmly together after the
immutable fashion of stone, though,
the smaller tower was pivoting against
the larger one, swinging back, down,
and out to the side, swooping forward
at the bottom of its arc to point down-
ward at a dizzyingly acute angle, then
barely scraping past the large tower
again at the top of its path; rotating
back, out, around.
In fact, as Max looked closer, it be-
came apparent that the rotating tower
was even stranger yet. Two windows
were visible on the small tower, lit
from within, and the light also cast
into relief the network of stones on the
surface.
Once you had accepted the
fact that the tower actually was mov-
ing, solid stone against solid stone with
no sign of a mechanism in evidence,

one would expect the lighted windows
and the tracery of stone cracks to be
moving along with it.
Instead, the
windows were maintaining their same
orientation, upright with respect to the
larger tower, one facing directly toward
Max and the other mostly edge-on, but
the rotation was making the surface
of the tower and the window and the
stone stretch and ﬂow as the shape
inside swept around; it was as though
the stone surface was artfully sculpted
on a large ﬂexible balloon, and this
balloon was faithfully matching the ex-
cursions of a rigid framework turning
within.
The tallest tower of all sprang out of
the central cluster of spires and halls
and coiled roofs and shot straight up
into the night sky. That tower, if Max
remembered correctly,
was the one
where Karlini had experienced his sec-

ond visitation, when he had stumbled
on the ofﬁce of the Death and had seen
a vision of the Death being attacked.
A glowing red smoke-ring surrounded
the tower just below its pointed roof.
Within the ring, a ball of more intense
and churning red was following a slow
orbit above the stone. On each pass, it
left behind it a crackling red trail that
hung in the air and slowly decayed, al-
most fading to a wisp before the ball of
ﬂame came around on its next trip and
brought it again to life.
The ﬁreball
was merely sitting there, tracking its
way deliberately around, and that was
more worrying than almost anything
else.
It could mean that the Death
was getting itself together and quiet-
ing down. On the other hand, it could
also mean that the Death was gather-
ing its strength for a supreme gasp of
nastiness. Either way, the safe thing to

do was to encapsulate the Death and
reason with it later, but for that to be
possible, the thing that had to be done
ﬁrst was to bleed off the Death’s power
reserves. And that, Max thought dis-
gustedly to himself, is going to need
proximity.
The ﬂood water had dropped be-
low the two-story mark and was still
falling as it ebbed back toward the
river. A body spun past in a tangle of
brush, its staring face upward. Hope-
fully the citywide toll was low - with
the warning given by the ﬂamboyant
nature of the manifestation, people
should have had time to get to upper
ﬂoors.
Even so, buildings had col-
lapsed and other people had undoubt-
edly been caught in the streets, not to
mention the destruction of the ships
and boats; the result was sure to be
grievous if not totally catastrophic. If

the castle stayed where it was, though,
river transit might ultimately be ru-
ined and the economy of the city de-
stroyed. It was certainly time for Max
to get going.
The most feasible route was, again,
the water. Leaving the other occupants
of the roof still staring open-mouthed
at the spectacle that surrounded them,
Max slid down his cord toward the wa-
ter, then balanced himself temporarily
against a beam. The ebbing tide was
choked with fractured wood, carriages
and carts and wagons, chairs and as-
sorted small furniture, pots, shrubs,
and, yes, here and there a body. Quite
surprisingly, though, Max had man-
aged to retain his backpack, due no
doubt to the reinforced construction
of the straps, and in the pack was his
face-mask and breathing tube; most
of his water-resistant outﬁt had been

shredded but at this stage that was
beside the point. Max ﬁtted the mask
into place, shook loose the cable, eased
himself into the water, pointed himself
toward the river, and began a careful
crawl stroke.
He swam with the current.
Land-
marks were difﬁcult to make out, but
the most important landmarks would
be the river and the castle; those would
be difﬁcult to miss. People were begin-
ning to rouse themselves in the build-
ings around him - relighting lamps,
pulling others out of the water.
Max
rounded a corner. The street ahead of
him was covered by mounds of ﬂoating
lumber, from pieces the size of match-
sticks all the way up to full structural
beams and intact fragments of ﬂoor,
twirling and shifting together on the
water. One wall of a building protruded
above the surface, a jagged platform of

ﬂoor still attached to it ﬁve feet up.
Several people had gathered there and
were shining a lantern on the water
below.
Beyond the wall and the tan-
gled wood fragments, looming like a
square-edged leviathan with its back
barely awash, sat a riverfront ware-
house, pushed off its foundation and
carried as a battering ram through
several built-up blocks. Max made his
way past its crushed front and along
a side wall that was fairly much un-
broken. Behind the warehouse, swept
clean by its own plowing mass, a chan-
nel stretched clear and straight to the
river.
The current was more deﬁnite here,
although the swells and smaller waves
washing back from the river into the
city were becoming more pronounced.
Max swam ahead along the channel.
A ﬂickering source of purple light ap-

proached on his right: then, lifted by a
wave, Max saw a crackling shaft of lacy
violet about ten feet long hanging just
above the water, rolling absently with
the swells - a piece of the ﬂood barrier
matrix.
He passed it with a deliber-
ate distance to spare.
The shredded
remains of the rest of the ﬂood bar-
rier web slipped by underneath, then
a ragged section of wharf. Max pulled
up, treading water, raised his head
above the surface, and pursed his lips
in thought, for ahead of him in the
river, the half-moon rising now in sil-
houette beyond it, was the castle of the
Death.
The rock groundwork and most of
the outer walls had sunk beneath the
water, and of course the main entrance
as well.
Since the side of the castle
facing Roosing Oolvaya was the one
canted over at an angle, the crenel-

lated top of the curtain wall was only
ten feet above the water level, low
enough for the larger waves to ride
completely over it. Max lifted his hand
into the air and tentatively sketched
a string of compact characters.
He
hadn’t tried this before, but the prin-
ciple was well-founded; there was no
reason it shouldn’t work.
The char-
acters ﬂowed together, melting and
merging, and wound into an open cir-
clet of soft silver, a smaller solid disc
hanging from it; Max lowered the cir-
clet over his head, resting it above his
brow, and positioned the solid disc in
front of his left eye.
While the disc appeared solid, it
was still massless and immaterial, and
so passed smoothly through the truly
solid form of the face-mask that was
also in front of Max’s eye.
Through
the viewing disc the castle appeared

brighter and the water less distinct.
The foundation and the submerged
walls were clearly discernable ahead
and below, and at their heart the dark
pool of energy interwoven with the ma-
trix of the rock. Fine black tendrils ran
up through the castle, inﬁltrating the
walls and internal airspace like nerves
or branching capillaries.
The image
had the pulse of a heartbeat rhythm,
shifting
proportion
and
perspective
amorphously with each regular surge:
beat - the castle went depth-negative,
reversing its dimensions, so that the
side arcing toward Max seemed to sud-
denly embed itself in space and curve
away - beat - side and front structures
superimposed
themselves,
crowding
each other in an irregular mapping
- beat - shift, change - beat - shift,
change. Unfortunately this wasn’t the
information Max was looking to ﬁnd

out, since at the moment he was in-
terested more in traps, and viewing
things from the perspective of the sec-
ond quantum level was quickly giving
him a headache to boot.
The near
point of the castle was only ﬁfty yards
away but that was apparently too far
for such details as trap nodes.
He
could see one area of reasonable detail,
though - the red smoke-ring circling
the topmost tower. Through the quan-
tum lens, the red ﬁreball was a spray of
hot anthropomorphic shapes and mad
ﬁeld lines wound about with arching
helices. Max didn’t know whether that
meant the Death was calming down
or getting ready to run amok, or what,
but the image certainly didn’t look
serene. Another thing he was looking
to ﬁnd, that he hadn’t been able to see
either, was the location of Roni and
Karlini and the rest of their gang.

Max ﬂipped the lens up on its cir-
clet and nosed over into the water.
A wave came up behind him, lifting
him as he paddled. Would it be high
enough? . . .
it was. The wave broke
against the curtain wall of the castle,
but Max was riding it toward its peak;
he slipped with the crest between two
square crenellation stones, across a
small lagoon covering an underwater
courtyard, and washed up next to the
interior wall facing onto the yard, just
below a window. He pulled himself up
on the sill, saw nothing inside, and
rolled through.
The ﬂoor was awash to ankle-depth
but the room was empty. Max crossed
it quickly, trying not to splash, posi-
tioned his lens again in front of his eye,
eased open the door, and peeked out
onto a ﬂat landing off a circular stair-
case. The same sheet of shallow water

covered the landing.
A deeper pool
hooded the descending stairs, large
bubbles bursting on its surface.
A
low orange glow suffused up through
the water from some unseen source
below. In the vague light Max’s right
eye made out the features of stair and
stone resting quietly and apparently
inert. His left eye could see the scene
more distinctly through the lens, but
the viewer revealed no sign of greater
activity. He moved up the stairs.
Through the lens, the stairs rippled
and revolved,
seeming to suddenly
point down when he was still obviously
going up, abruptly receding to a dis-
tance of miles and then popping back
to sit atop his nose. He passed a room
on his right; his right eye saw it as
a simple sitting chamber but his left
added a churning blue disc hanging
in the air at neck-level.
Additional

rooms passed on the left, the staircase
coiled tighter and steepened its pitch,
and then the wall opened on the right
into a level corridor. Max took a step
toward the corridor and froze. The cor-
ridor was constricting about thirty feet
ahead, drawing together from all four
sides like a soft tube pinched around
by ﬁngers; his left eye saw it and his
right eye saw it too. In the center of
the constriction zone dangled a small
kaleidoscopic vortex.
Max spun back
to the staircase and froze again. Some-
thing from below was following him
rapidly up the steps.
Max backed warily upward. Give me
a break, already, he thought, I don’t
have time to.waste like this. He had to
ﬁnd Karlini - an orange glow spread up
the stairs, strobing with the heartbeat
rhythm of the castle. A distant tremor
ran through the ﬂoor.
Max glanced

around, behind him, down - DOWN!
He ﬂung himself back, scrabbling con-
vulsively upward, as a twisted mass
festooned with pincers and shining
with a sick orange glare sprang up
through the stone ﬂoor itself and spun
toward him. Max ﬂung a destabilizer
at it, followed by a barrier disk; the
disk folded twice along sudden orange
creases and toppled melting to the ﬂoor
while the destabilizer dart degraded
into a pile of tiny leaves that hung
ﬂuttering in the air; the orange thing
pulsed again and changed, gaining sev-
eral long-stalked eyes with multiple
pupils and a set of mobile jaws; and
Max turned and ran full-tilt away from
it up the stairs.
A turn-and-a-half
above, the staircase ended at a dead-
wall landing. A single doorway opened
to one side.
The construct was right behind him,

now sporting a dragging tail and ven-
tral ﬁns.
The walls around Max as
seen through the lens were squirming
with life, the veins of black energy in
them throbbing with knots of slipping
silver.
Half-a-dozen veins had leapt
out from the walls and were embedded
in the orange construct, feeding it sil-
ver globs - that gave Max an idea. He
backed through the door, trading ma-
neuver room for time while his ﬁngers
wove in the air. He had entered a cir-
cular chamber twenty feet across with
a peaked ceiling and several open win-
dows, an observation turret slapped
onto the side of the major tower. The
orange creature shot after him, its pin-
cers gnashing, but missed the doorway
and plowed into the wall. That didn’t
stop it; with a grinding growl a ﬁve-
foot section of stone next to the door
exploded into gravel and smoky dust,

and the creature pushed its way into
the room. The thing’s half-dozen eyes
turned to face him.
It had been a long time since Max
had worked this particular kind of
transformation and it was a compli-
cated one to boot, but the technique
was coming back. He pumped activa-
tion potential into the transmutation
bridge – there, he had it! The air cur-
dled behind the creature. A foot-long
section of each dancing feeding tube
turned gold, then yellow, then gray;
the construct paused, three of the eyes
whirling to peer around behind it; and
the tubes of energy began to stretch
and fall toward the ﬂoor like wisps
of smoke suddenly possessed of solid
weight. That was in fact close to the
truth; Max had gotten them with a
solidiﬁcation bridge that was warp-
ing mass into their immaterial matrix

structure.
Two of the veins cracked
in mid-air and splintered.
The crea-
ture was waving its pincers around,
lights and refractive effects sparkling
around them as it snapped off wards
and counterﬁelds, but the bridges had
their contacts ﬁrmly bound and with
its power rapidly declining the crea-
ture couldn’t shake them. Its orange
color faded toward a translucent yel-
low. Then the eyes wobbled up to peer
at Max and one of the hanging mouths
broke into a nasty grin. The construct
grabbed at the solidiﬁcation bands, re-
versed its own polarity, and yanked.
A wave of accretion poured along the
feeding veins and burst through the
construct in a surge of pulsing gray.
The statue that had been the con-
struct dropped toward the ﬂoor, the
snarling mouth lagging in the air for
an instant behind it, the whole assem-

bly still gaining mass at an accelerated
rate. Max began to lunge around it to-
ward the door. The mass hit the stone
ﬂoor weighing a ton or more, the ﬂoor
cracked around it, a giant shudder
shook the room as the cracks ran up
into the walls, the ﬂoor canted abruptly
outward, and with a ﬁnal lurch and
rumble the entire room pulled free
from the tower wall and started to fall.
The doorway slid up and away barely
short of Max’s ﬁngers. He turned and
vaulted across the room, hit ﬂoor and
leapt again, sprang headﬁrst in a clean
plunge through the window space op-
posite the doorway, and arched over in
a long swan dive toward the water far
below.

Chapter20
THE DANCE OF
DEATH
THE FALLING TURRET ENTERED
THE WATER thirty feet to Max’s right
and a second ahead; the splash had
barely begun to reach him when he
sliced into the river.
The blow drove
the air from his lungs. He let his mo-
mentum carry him deep, felt his ears

pop as the pressure wave from the
turret radiated past overhead, turned,
stroked back to the surface, shook the
water out of his eyes, took a deep gasp-
ing breath, and looked around. He had
shrugged out of his backpack in mid-
air so the impact wouldn’t rip his shoul-
ders off; now in the river swells start-
ing to carry him downstream there
was no sign of it. A ﬂash caught his
attention out of the corner of his vision.
Upstream and high in the air, a moving
pinpoint slid down against the stars,
no, more than a pinpoint, a dot, not a
dot at all but a disc, a disc with sprout-
ing lines on both sides, ﬂapping lines;
and then abruptly the moving dot was
a large swooping bird, claws down and
open and grasping, painted dim white
by the light of the moon, gliding toward
Max over the surface of the water. The
bird ﬂapped once more, Max raised his

arms, the claws swelled, and with a
thud to his chest and a lurch in his
stomach he was jerked into the air. In
two powerful wing thrusts the bird
gained altitude and banked toward the
castle.
The river tilted crazily below.
Max looked up instead.
A hood with two bright sparks at
about the right place for eyes peered
back at him around the neck of the bird.
"Fortunate are you waited I around,"
Haddo said.
Another wing-ﬂap,
and the bird
cleared a battlement with no more
than ﬁve feet to spare.
"Thanks,
Haddo,
you’re a handy guy!" Max
yelled up.
Haddo had been plan-
ning to loiter in the vicinity of Roosing
Oolvaya to see what happened there
before heading back to the castle. Of
course, it had ended up saving him a
trip, since the castle had come to him

instead. "What’s the situation?"
"Karlini, must help. Progressing is
evacuation -"
Haddo broke off and squawked an-
grily at the bird.
The bird banked
sharply right, skimmed a wall, ﬂapped
once more, skimmed the ridge of a slate
roof, and brought its wings up, cupping
them underneath; the three of them
paused abruptly in mid-air and then
dropped. Below the bird and rushing
up at them was the landing-ﬁeld. Ten
feet above the ﬁeld the bird opened its
claws; Max, who’d been anticipating
this, curled free and rolled down onto
the grass. The bird glided across the
ﬁeld, grabbed a bundle of books and
other packages wrapped in a net, stuck
its left wing in the air and snapped to
the right, and passed out of sight just
above another wall and a line of chim-
neys. Max came to his feet and trotted

across the ﬁeld. A man with sacks over
both shoulders came out of a door in
front of him.
"Oh, good," said the Great Karlini,
swinging the sacks to the ground,
"you’ve showed up."
"You can thank Haddo," Max said,
"yet another time. You don’t want to
ﬁnd out what you’d do without him.
But things downstairs in this castle of
yours are getting pretty hairy; I don’t
know how long it would have taken me
to get up here on my own. What’s the
situation?"
Karlini began stufﬁng sacks and
loose books into another net.
"We’d
gotten ready to evacuate like you sug-
gested, so we’re almost ﬁnished, now.
This is the end of the stuff from the
towers, and Wroclaw’s got a boat down-
stairs. Roni’s with him."
A rolling tremor ran through the

castle, followed by the rumble of stone
collapsing
somewhere
out
of
sight.
"Yeah," Max said, "and what about
you?"
Karlini swallowed and gnawed on
his lip. "I still can’t leave. Whatever it
is that’s locked into me hasn’t turned
itself off."
"I was afraid of that," Max muttered.
"The Death may have a manual over-
ride on your hook-line, but he’s got to
be sentient to use it, all of which means
we’ve got to get you loose ourselves, un-
less of course we can think of some
way to get the Death calmed down and
make him friendly at the same time."
"It does look that way. You have any
ideas?"
Max had ﬂipped down his lens and
was studying Karlini through it. Kar-
lini’s form was suffused with a vague
skeleton of wispy black, but unlike

the construct Max had just fought,
the streamers inside Karlini were self-
contained, with no apparent connec-
tion to the rest of the castle’s energy
matrix.
"I think there’s some reso-
nant effect going between you and the
castle," Max said.
"Maybe if we can
destabilize the castle ﬁeld we can pry
you loose.
If we destabilize the ﬁeld
we may also be able to bleed off en-
ergy from the Death, which may make
him more tractable if we hit him with
something like a conﬁnement shell."
Karlini shrugged. "Okay. How?"
"What did you ﬁnd out from your
probes after I left?"
"Well," Karlini said, "I couldn’t get
past the defenses on the power reser-
voir, but I did manage to sneak a tap
into the energy transmission system;
I think I can run a shunt if we need
it. Oh!, - I also found the castle’s jump

engine, ﬁgured out part of the activa-
tion mechanism too. That thing takes
a lot of power.
Unfortunately, all of
these contraptions are embedded in
the foundation, and the foundation’s
under thirty feet of water."
"That’s going to be a problem,’• Max
said. "I don’t think we have the extra
time to set up a dive-bubble, so we’ll
have to work it remote. The way I see
it, we’ve got to handle these things to-
gether at the same time: we have to get
the Death under control, move this cas-
tle out of the river, and pry you loose,
keeping ourselves alive at the same
time." A large shape rose into the air
beyond the wall at the end of the ﬁeld,
becoming Haddo and the bird.
They
glided over the yard, snatched the last
net off the ground, and swooped off
into the night.
Max and Karlini straightened. "That’

it for the airlift," Karlini said, "so I
guess that means we have to get back
to work."
"Right. Where’s the tower with our
friend the mad god?"
"This way." Karlini took off across
the ﬁeld and through a doorway, Max
right behind him.
"I know a route
that’ll get us around the worst of the
obstacles."
"The god will be pulling a lot of
power himself," Max said.
"We can
bleed off some of that energy to fuel a
beat-resonance wave and try to over-
load the stability focus-points.
The
castle will have to feed more power
into the stabilizers, and that’ll make
them stand out against the matrix
background; we superimpose a shunt
surge on top of the resonance wave, tell
it to home in on the stabilization loci,
change the beat frequency, and maybe

we can blow the stabilizers out. With
all that going on the god should be
weakened enough for the conﬁnement
shell to work."
"Did you bring the ring?" Karlini
said, heading up a long ﬂight of stairs.
The castle was quieter in this section,
and the space-warping effects and per-
ceptual illusions that had hit Max
lower down were much less ﬂagrant.
A wall rippled and changed texture on
the left, but the stairs were stable.
"No, damn it; it disappeared in the
mess when the Death got out. You were
wrong, you know - there was only one
Death, not two. Just the Death from
this castle, and Oskin Yahlei using his
power."
“But you don’t have the ring."
“I did the best I could. It’ll make the
conﬁnement more difﬁcult but I think
we can still pull it off. While I’m doing

the incarceration, you’ll set the jump
engines to trigger off a time-decay fuse-
"
"Where are we going to send the cas-
tle?"
"We don’t want to drop it on an-
other populated area, what it’s done
to Roosing Oolvaya’s been enough. I’m
sure there isn’t enough power around
to throw it into orbit ... probably the
safest place is the middle of the ocean."
"It may be simpler to return it to
wherever it started from in the ﬁrst
place," Karlini said, coming out the top
of the stairs and charging to the right
along a hallway; the ceiling of the hall
was shifting between gray stone and a
translucent gauze-like substance that
glowed bright yellow.
"I think that
location’s programmed into the mecha-
nism."
"Fine," said Max. "You set the jump

engine to activate however you want,
as long as we have enough time to get
out of here ﬁrst, and while we’re get-
ting out I’ll deal with your hook-ﬁeld;
the power ﬂux should be low enough
by then to be able to shake you loose.
Well, what do you think, is it all going
to work?"
Karlini paused at the foot of a new
circular stair leading up into a tower
opening off their current hall and
glanced back over his shoulder at Max.
"You’re the expert in gods, not me.
What do you think?"
". . .
Iffy," Max said. "I don’t really
understand all the guts of this second-
level stuff yet, and we’ll be trying some
pretty complicated manipulcations.
I
don’t know if we’ll have enough power
to make up for the inexperience."
"Are there any alternatives?”
"I do have one other idea, but I don’t

even want to try it unless we absolutely
have to."
“. . . One of those."
"Yeah," Max said, “it’s one of those,
all right."
Karlini had cocked his head and
closed his eyes, apparently listening
to something somewhere else.
He
opened his eyes, straightened again,
and squared his shoulders. "Roni and
Wroclaw are pulling away," he said.
"This is it, then."
"Right." Max had been sketching
in the air,
and now another head-
band
with
vision-disc
settled
over
Karlini’s brow.
Through the lenses,
they could see giant cables of winding
black coming together from all parts of
the surrounding structure and funnel-
ing upward through the tower walls,
coiling around each other and merg-
ing together as they rose toward the

tower’s peak and the mad Death. Max
dragged an armchair away from an
end-table in the hall, plopped it down
at the base of the stairs, and began
making passes over it.
One of his
coupling-intermediary disk-formations
took shape above the seat cushion.
Static
charge
crackled
-
another
of the heartbeat change-pulses.
The
stone walls heaved in a long rippling
wave like the snap of a whip; behind
them, the hall they’d just used as an
entrance folded in on itself ceiling-ﬁrst
in a cloud of billowing dust. "That was
our exit!" Karlini yelled over the noise.
"We’ll blast through the outside wall
and jump if we have to!" Max yelled
back.
Karlini’s reply was drowned out by
another massive rumble.
The ﬂoor
rocked forward, back, then subsided
into a low shudder, several degrees

of new tilt added onto its previous
downhill slant.
The armchair had
been enveloped in a swarm of dart-
ing blue mites as the disc split and
split again, and Max could feel its
energy beginning to ﬂow through the
transformer coupling into his own body.
Max leaned in through the tower en-
try and glanced up; through his lens
he could see red waves of pulsatile
light spilling down from above, the
staircase seeming to writhe and snap
like a plucked string. He reached gin-
gerly upward with a passive probe -
yes, the mad god was still there, still
gathering strength through the black
cables, but also apparently still un-
aware of their presence below. With a
muscle-wrenching pass over the chair,
he started to formulize the framework
for the ﬁrst conﬁnement shell.
Karlini had one palm pressed ﬂat

against the stone of the wall, his teeth
clenched in concentration; his other
hand was carefully sketching ﬁgures
in the air. The ﬁgures were oozing from
magenta to silver, losing their separate
forms and breaking into small round
plates like scales.
The scales spun
away from Karlini in the shape of a
miniature tornado and began to ﬁll
in the surface of a large glistening
teardrop-shaped glob suspended next
to him. A ripple ran through the glob
and it started to oscillate, its form slid-
ing from long and thin to short and
plump and back again like a pool of
hanging quicksilver, its colors revers-
ing ﬁgure-for-ground at each pulse;
then all at once the glob surged for-
ward and ﬂowed into the wall. Just as
it entered the wall the pool fractured
into a sudden cloud of smaller droplets.
Each droplet darted toward one of the

coiling black cables and sunk into it,
and began to spiral down along the ca-
ble toward the heart of the castle. "Are
you ready, Max?" Karlini said.
A nestled series of counter-rotating
meshwork spheres hung over the re-
mains of the chair, apparently forming
one continuous surface communicat-
ing along twisted shifting boreholes.
"Yeah, almost," Max said, "but I’m still
a little out of range.
I want to get
closer."
"Better move it, then; we should see
something from the stability points in
under a minute . . . what’s that?"
The
sphere-construct
had
moved
ahead of Max and was ﬂoating up
the stairs to the tower.
A rolling
blue cloud ﬁnished condensing around
Max’s hand; he made a ﬁnal pass above
the cloud with his other hand and the
cloud heaved and took off, trailing a

line of knotted blue behind it like a
ﬁshing line.
The cloud banked for a
quick turn once around Karlini and
then dove straight into his chest. Blue
smoke puffed out around his torso. The
blue line had stretched out across the
room, growing wispy and almost invis-
ible against the stone, but it became
distinct again where it terminated in a
solid blue bracelet locked hard around
Max’s wrist.
“If we have to bail out
before I get back down I might have to
crack you loose by remote," Max yelled
to Karlini, now following the sphere
up the stairs, "and I think we’ll have
enough going on without having to run
a fresh spell-guide too!"
"Okay!" Karlini said, his voice ring-
ing in along the blue line. "Be careful!"
"Yeah," Max muttered.
His whole
body was tingling from the slug of
energy he’d absorbed from the chair;

he’d have to use that energy soon or
blow it off, or he’d go unstable himself.
Another turn up the stairs, and the
red glow from the top was becoming
harsh in its glare. Black coils of power
surged up around him through the
walls. Max stretched out, felt around
- yeah, there was the Death, all right,
still orbiting the tower and sucking in
power from the castle.
Max tugged
at the conﬁnement sphere, adjusting
control parameters. The sphere broke
apart, segment by segment and layer
by layer in a quick radial stream, the
fragments shot toward the walls and
dove through them to merge with the
black current, and the disassembled
pieces shot upward toward the mad
Death.
"Here it goes!" came Karlini’s voice,
and at the same moment the stairs
lurched underfoot.
A rending groan

so low in pitch that Max felt rather
than heard it vibrated through the
stone. Riding on top of the groan was a
throbbing whine, pulsating out-of-time
and out-of rhythm against the heart-
beat pattern of the castle as a whole.
A wave ran up the black energy coils;
their progression speeded up, slowed.
reversed, surged forward, stopped, and
went into a pattern of quick jerks back
and forth.
Max felt out again and
snarled - the Death had sucked up
part of his conﬁnement matrix along
with his power feed, but not enough of
it for full activation.
Max bled power into the conﬁne-
ment framework, trying to force more
matrix elements toward the Death
along the guide of the black carrier
beams. The now-stalled current heaved
sluggishly.
The Death inhaled again,
more forcefully, like a man trying to

draw in oxygen through a clogged air-
line, the current lunged ahead -
Through his control-link with the
matrix framework Max felt a click, a
SNAP, a swirl of agglomeration! The
Death had sucked up the pieces of the
matrix!
Embedded in the substance
of the mad god, spread around him
and through him, binding him in coils
of constricting power, the conﬁnement
spheres were locking together! A trail-
ing barrage of solidiﬁcation fronts ran
up the black feeder tendrils, leaving
crystallization in their wake. A boil ap-
peared on the side of the outer sphere
and popped, ejecting the matrix’s keel-
string.
The keel-string shot out and
embedded itself deep in the castle
stone; the conﬁnement ﬁeld, still gain-
ing strength, began to constrict; then,
all at once, a gout of heat and ﬂame
and raw heaving power came bursting

through the not-yet-closed interstices
in the overlapping matrix spheres, as
the Death recognized suddenly that
it was being trapped, and was not
pleased, no, not pleased at all.
Max threw power, power into the
matrix grid, power into the feeder cut-
offs, power into the keel-string.
The
mad god was deﬁnitely weaker than
an instant before, wilder, disoriented
by the gyrations of the castle’s internal
mechanisms as they tried to compen-
sate for the destabilizing forces beat-
ing at it. From his infusion of energy
and his level of preparation, Max was
stronger than he’d been earlier, back
at Oskin Yahlei’s, but that didn’t mean
the Death was weak yet enough to sur-
render or that Max was strong enough
to force him. A section of tower wall
half-a-turn below Max crumbled and
fell away. The stairs writhed beneath

his feet. Max refused to be distracted
by more antics of stairs; he was concen-
trating instead on using his last power
to hold on. It wasn’t until the section
of circular stair above him whipped
ﬂexibly back over his head and wound
itself twice around his body that Max
caught on, too late, to the fact that the
entire tower was folding and writhing,
shattering rocks were ﬂying off to the
sides, and the tower was sliding off the
face of the castle toward the river.
Not again, Max thought, his stom-
ach knotting with the abrupt down-
ward acceleration.
He pulled his left
arm loose; then, with a THUD that
threw his head straight back into one
of the dancing stones above him, the
remains of the tower hung up against
a lower battlement and began to rotate
outward, the tower toppling over onto
its side; and then, with a THOOMP!!

like the tail of a mile-long beaver slap-
ping a pond the tower sank ﬂat and
full-length into the river.
Max’s thoughts were gooey and his
lungs (the air blown out of them by
the impact) were ﬁlling with water, his
head throbbed with waves of agony, but
the one principle he had programmed
down to the depths of his personality
was Do Not Die Until You’re Ready!
He made the pain goad him, he slid,
he clawed, he wrenched, he shoved,
he pulverized a stone slab with the
last gasp of his transfused power, he
fended off another section of wall tum-
bling more slowly toward the riverbed,
and at last there was nothing above
him but water, but there seemed to be
an awful lot of water and no surface he
could ﬁnd . . .
Then something had him by the
shirt, a hand, pulling him upward -

air! - and over a low gunwale of raw
wood onto a pile of rope in some kind of
small boat. Max retched up water and
desperately sucked in air, his eyes still
closed and his mind sloshing in the
bottom of his skull like melted gelatin.
"Roni?" he croaked.
"What are you talking about?" It
wasn’t Roni’s voice, it wasn’t even the
voice of a woman, but it was familiar.
Max’s mind staggered up and began to
put itself in gear. "I’m -"
"The Creeping Sword," Max gasped,
coughing over the side.
"Yeah, right, I found your friend
Shaa, he’s safe back in the city, and -"
Max spit once more, then turned to
gaze upwards, still drawing in loud
gulps of air through his open mouth
but now making himself take notice
of the scene above, forcing himself not
to close his eyes under the pain. The

tower had taken a wide section of lower
wall with it as it fell; smoke and vapor
hung behind in the sky.
A spray of
multicolored curlicues and shooting
ﬁreworks was erupting out from the
high gash where the tower had been
attached, casting bursts of sharp light
through the billowing clouds of dust;
hopefully that meant Karlini was alive
and still working in the rubble. Above
the castle and winding through the
spires, a compact red sun swooped and
darted in swift arcs like a tailless kite
bound down by the keel-line.
Pieces
of stone ﬂowed like putty toward it as
it passed; in fact, the castle’s entire
upper works had started to sag and
melt.
The castle’s heartbeat rhythm
of pulsing change was visibly accel-
erating.
One of the rotating towers
detached itself and slid toward the wa-
ter, then abruptly changed its mind

and tumbled upward into the sky. The
red ﬁreball swept down again toward
the river, close enough for Max to make
a quick check on the conﬁnement ﬁeld -
it was holding, most of the way around,
but the last critical tie-points were
starting to decay. "What a mess," Max
muttered across a thick tongue. "If I
only had that damned ring I could -"
"What
ring?"
said
the
Creeping
Sword, suddenly hearing Max through
his
own
running
commentary
and
interrupting himself in mid-remark.
"You mean Oskin Yahlei’s ring? I’ve got
it."
Max whirled his head. It was a mis-
take, it had almost made him pass out,
but - "You WHAT?"
"Yeah, I’ve got it here, I spotted it -"
"Where is it? Quick! Give it to - no,
wait a minute, yeah - you hold it."
"What are -"

"Shut up and hold still, you’ve just
gone from contingency plan to center
stage."
"Now wait a second -"
"Look up there and then give me
another cute remark," Max snapped.
He was gesturing furiously with both
hands, digging down past the bottom
of his energy store, the corner of his
lower lip clenched intently between his
teeth. A blue coupling-disc formed it-
self reluctantly in front of the Creeping
Sword’s chest. The disc wobbled, and
the concave surface facing the Sword
turned yellow and purple in a checker-
board pattern.
In the maze of ﬁne
structures on the back of the disc, new
connections were growing.
Something large landed near them
in the water, splattering molten gravel
around the boat. The Creeping Sword
opened his mouth.

"You wanted to be clear of Gashanatan
didn’t you?" Max snarled. "Well, this
may do it." The disc sank onto the
Sword’s chest, delicate tendrils reach-
ing out from it into his body. "I’m going
to try to couple Gash’s power through
his link to you into the containment
ﬁeld in the ring. Get out the ring and
hold it up, and keep that sword of
yours under control."
The walking stick that was the
Sword’s sword in disguise had started
to whine.
"Shut up," the Sword mut-
tered at it, fumbling at his belt.
A pillar of harsh red shot out of the
ﬁreball and across the sky in a focused
beam;
one apex of the conﬁnement
matrix had ﬁnally decayed and was
leaking out. The disc on the Creeping
Sword’s chest burst into sudden blue
life with a vibrant hum.
The Sword
choked back a "Yeaow!" and held up

the ring. An array of lenses and hov-
ering silver meshwork herders had
emerged from the disc and were pass-
ing through each other, jockeying for
position. Max growled at them.
In the red glare that illuminated the
castle and the river and threw high-
lights across the city waterfront and
the Palace of the Venerance, something
else was forming - a bank of clouds,
emanating from a point directly over
the castle and blowing out radially,
starting a clockwise spin. A pinwheel
of silver electricity spiraled out from
behind a battlement and arched out
toward the water. "Here we go," Max
said, making a last gesture and folding
his ﬁngers together tip-ﬁrst to let them
writhe under his palm. A whiff of dust
shot out of the back of his hand and
curled toward the chest of the Creep-
ing Sword.
The dust spun into the

coupling-disc.
The disc ﬂashed lightning-blue and
seemed to lengthen itself backward
into the Sword’s chest cavity, through
it, behind it, elongating into a tun-
nel,
stretching off in a zigzagging
warp.
The Creeping Sword looked
down, an unsettled expression on his
face, and had started to say, "I don’t
think Gash likes -" when with a loud
WHOOOEEERLL!!.
something ap-
peared in the far distance of the tunnel
and hurtled back out toward them, a
form of solid royal blue so sharp it
burned the eyes; it bashed out through
the disc in a thick rippling column, con-
stricted itself into a point, and leapt
toward the ring. The ring burst out in
a hot burning gold as the blue column
sliced down its bore and looped into
the sky.
Fifty feet above the river it
disappeared against the night black.

Max’s eyes were slitted, watching
the careening red ﬁreball. One second,
two - where was that thing? It wasn’t
working! Forget it now, they were all
doomed, and –
A round spot of blue appeared on the
side of the ﬁreball. The grid of the con-
ﬁnement ﬁeld stood out suddenly like
a glyph writ in lightning, blue light-
ning, the blue spot pulsed and ﬂowed
out, the ball ﬂashed with competing
forces - WHOOOM!!
- silver-white
with the blinding impact of an explod-
ing sun washed the scene with glare.
The world broke into two colors - the
upper face of the castle and the near
face of the Palace and the wave-peaks
radiated a smoking ﬂaring silver, and
the shadows and hollows behind cast
the dead black of the abyss. Waves of
thunder rolled. Then -
The air was suddenly still. The thun-

der faded to mere echoes returning
from the hills, the glare easing to after-
images. Near at hand, Max heard a low
sucking, slurping sound - SLOIAYER-
RRULLP! - against the dying booms of
the thunder. The space inside the ring
ﬂashed once, red running to blue, and
the colors spun out and fell against
the surface of the metal. A nimbus of
ghostly blue wafted through the ring
and dissolved slowly in the air. "Well?"
said the Creeping Sword.
"Let’s put it this way," Max said. He
was having trouble putting words to-
gether, and his vision was refusing to
clear. "Don’t try - don’t try to wear that
ring or, or we’re going to have to go
through all of this another time."
"Then you did what you were trying
to do?"
"Yeah, we got lucky."
"What about Gash?"

"I don’t know, don’t know." The wind
was coming up again; a sheet of water
blew off the crest of a river swell and
sloshed into the boat. "Now gotta get
Karlini." Overhead, the wheel of clouds
was thickening.
The upper works of
the castle glowed a sullen molten red,
drooping and smoldering in strange liq-
uid forms. Max felt out along the spell-
guide. "Karlini! Karlini, you there?"
"Max?" The sound of Karlini’s voice
was distant and weak.
"Glad you’re
back - the castle’s about ready to go."
Max’s vision was not clearing, it was
getting worse, it was closing in from
the sides in a dark band. The throb of
his head ﬁlled the air. The voice of the
Creeping Sword sounded as far away
as Karlini’s. "Max? Max!"
HE WAS WOBBLING IN THE
STERN OF THE ROWBOAT, looking
up at the castle and talking to some-

body who wasn’t there, his left arm
half-raised and his right knee slowly
folding, and them he just settled to one
side, fell over on the rope piled in the
bilge, and came to rest with his head
hanging out over the gunwale.
He’d
bled off so much weight since I’d seen
him earlier that he looked like a victim
of sudden starvation - his clothes were
dangling on him like sheets - and the
parts of him exposed to the air seemed
pretty well bashed in under the nasty
red glow from the castle. "Max?" I said
again, but he was out. And he’d left me
holding the bag.
Gash was still back there some-
where, I could feel him, but Max’s
little trick had taken him by surprise;
he was weakened too, so I didn’t think
I had to worry about him for a while.
The real problem now wasn’t Gash, it
was Max. He’d given me a pretty rough

time, treating me the way I don’t let
anybody treat me, using me as a con-
venient tool for his own schemes, not
seeming to care whether he killed me
in the process.
And the process had
hurt - my chest where he’d slapped his
blue whatever-it-was spell felt like the
riverfront of Roosing Oolvaya looked.
Not only that, it had hurt Gash too,
and I’d felt that at second-hand back
through the metabolic link; I’d really
gotten it coming and going.
I wasn’t
sure how I was able to be on my own
feet myself, but I was, and I had to
make some quick decisions because I
was the one on the spot.
The simplest thing would be to for-
get this guy Shaa, forget the other
friend Max had been talking to up in
that castle, whatever his problem was
and whatever Max had intended to do
about it, and just roll Max over the side

back into the river. If he came looking,
I could tell Shaa I hadn’t made it out
here in time, and if I really had to I
could blow town or lay low for a few
months.
Yeah, most likely somebody
would come after me, but I’d had people
after me before; probably still did, for
that matter, it was part of the business.
The important point was that I could
get rid of Max, right now, and I’d never
have a better shot.
Not only was it
reasonably the best idea for me, it had
a lot to recommend it from a purely
good-sense and good-of-the-community
viewpoint.
I hate magic, and one reason is the
mess it’s made of the world; magic is
more destabilizing than any other force
of man or nature. Add a little magic to
a situation and just watch how quickly
things get out of hand. I didn’t know
how much of the current disaster had

been caused by Max and his crew and
how much of it they’d been ﬁghting
themselves, but now my favorite city
was a wreck, who knew how many
people were dead, river trade could
be ruined for years, and what really
had been solved? It was inﬁghting in
a small group, that’s what it was, and
all it did was trample people trying to
live their lives and stay out of the way.
If I took out Max it looked like I’d be
ridding the world of a prime player in
a game I didn’t like.
I almost made myself do it, I really
almost did, and in a way, that shocked
me more than anything else, because it
was the kind of thing I’d promised my-
self I’d never ever do again. This mess
had woken feelings I’d been trying to
grapple with for years. They say you
learn. They say you do what you have
to do and after awhile you get used to it,

but I’d done things years before when
I was nothing but a dumb hired-sword
punk kid that still hung dark in my
memory, making me squirm whenever
I thought of them and sending me out
in the street to do something nice for
some other poor dumb idiot. Maybe I
just had a resistance to education. On
the other hand, either we’re all going to
be barbarians, or somebody has to rein
themselves in, decide when they’re go-
ing to draw their own line, or decide
when there’s something they have to do
because they think it’s the right thing
to do, even if it doesn’t directly beneﬁt
themselves, even if sometime it may be
incompatible with their own survival.
I’d done that, and that was the way I
tried to live my life.
What is a good guy, really?
Some-
body who has principles and stands
up for them? Somebody who does the

right thing when they have a choice?
Maybe.
But what’s the right thing?
Keep the strong from taking over the
world?
Sometimes.
Don’t murder
people if you can help it?
Some peo-
ple deserve murdering, so what then?
Help out your friends?
Usually.
But
what was the answer, the real answer?
Damned if I know, and anyway the sit-
uation didn’t demand the whole book;
on the scale of potential crucibles this
one was pretty small, the whole affair
was relatively minor to anyone who
wasn’t actually in Roosing Oolvaya at
the moment. It didn’t matter. I didn’t
know what a good guy was, but I al-
ways thought of myself as one of them.
I could see Max thought of himself
the same way. Both of us tried to do
the right thing as we saw it, even if it
wasn’t necessarily the right thing for
us. If I threw Max back in the water

I couldn’t think of myself as the kind
of person I wanted to be anymore, and
that was worth a lot more to me than
avoiding the trouble I’d surely inherit
by keeping him alive.
So Max collapsed in the stern and I
had to think of what he’d want me to
do next.
The most urgent problem would be
this Karlini person he’d been talking
to. The water around the submerged
base of the castle was foaming and
churning, piles of large bubbles were
boiling up around it, and the general
tenor of the dancing lights on the walls
and the descending cloud bank over-
head seemed to imply that the castle
was building up to a big event, and
that event was coming real soon. Max
had a link to Karlini back up in the
castle and Karlini would be waiting for
Max to help bail him out of some Jam.

Under the circumstances, my bet was
that the thing Karlini needed bailing
out of was the castle itself.
I could see a faint light-blue glow
starting at Max’s left hand and looping
off toward the castle. I dropped down
next to him and stuck my own hand in
that beam. What had Max done? - it
looked like he’d just talked. "Hello?" I
said. "Anybody there? Karlini?"
Sure enough, I heard a faint voice.
"Who are you?" it said. "Where’s Max?"
"Max isn’t doing too well, he’s out
cold. What kind of help did you need
from him?"
I thought I heard a low "auugh!"
kind of sound from the other end. Then,
"If you need to ask, I’m sunk."
"Karlini!" I said. "I may be able to
shoot you some more power, if that’ll
help."
"I don’t know what he was going

to try," Karlini muttered, "and this
castle’s going to move any second."
I still had the ring in my hand,
clenched on my palm in a ﬁst; tin-
gling waves of heat were spreading
out from it through my hand and up
my arm. I still had Gash’s metabolic
link, too.
Between the two of them
they had to be good for something. I
put my other hand, the one holding
the ring, in the beam, and started to
concentrate.
Help Karlini, I thought.
Help Karlini!
I’d had practice with
this kind of thing twice before, now,
even if those episodes hadn’t worked
quite as planned; this time it was com-
ing more easily. I got my other hand
free and slapped Max across the face a
few times for good measure, splashed
some water in his eyes. The blue beam
rippled.
"What’s going on down there?" Kar-

lini said.-
I was looking straight ahead with
my jaw locked and my mind wound
around "HELP KARLINI!", and so I
saw it start to happen.
The disc of
clouds overhead had been dropping;
just as they reached the spire of the
castle’s tallest tower the whole castle
strobed white, ﬂickered, and began
to fade. Roosing Oolvaya lights glim-
mered behind it.
Next to me in the
boat, Max was still unconscious. He’d
been out for the count, but maybe he
was warming up a bit - he’d started
coughing, thrashing his head against
the water now splashing over him from
the wind-driven waves breaking on the
boat, and his hand was ﬂuttering. His
hand? I touched the ring to it. A puff
of pale blue ﬁlled with snaky lines like
the core of a bramble bush boiled up
out of the air and shot up the beam

toward Karlini.
I thought I heard a
voice say, "Max! I’m loose!", and then
a length of blue thread tumbled out of
the sky like a snapped kite string and
coiled across the boat.
High up on the castle, at the ragged
base of the tower Max had ridden down
to the river, another dot appeared and
started to fall. I could see that the dot
was turning into the ﬁgure of a man,
and that was too bad because it was
falling outward from the castle but not
out far enough, and there was a stone
wall and a cluster of small buildings in
its way long before the waves. Except-
Except he’d timed things better than
I had, and he knew more about what
was happening too; so when he hit the
uppermost roof in his path a second
later the castle was by then no more
than an outlined ghost drawn in spi-
derweb against the city, insubstantial

as a cloud and fading further, and he
passed straight through it without a
catch and continued in the same tra-
jectory toward the water. The water -
THE WATER!
The castle was gone, and all of a sud-
den there was a big castle-sized hole
in the river where there had been rock
an instant before, and the water was
starting to pour into it like a falling
cliff. It was hopeless, hopeless for all
of us, but I grabbed for the oars. Kar-
lini fell.
Then, suddenly behind him
in the midst of the cloud of thrown
spray, behind him and coming up fast
- a white shape, a large growing mov-
ing shape, the shape of a giant bird!
Bird and Karlini disappeared as the
rowboat rocked, the incredible pull of
the cataract dragging us backward. I
was thinking "HELP!” and "RESCUE!"
and other such things but nothing was

happening, nothing good anyway, noth-
ing but the downhill slide of the boat;
another couple of seconds maximum
and that was going to be that. A ﬂicker
of motion at the side, low above the
waves - the bird again!, coming toward
me with labored wing beats that barely
cleared the water, Karlini no longer in
the air by himself or in the river but
in the dangling claws of the bird; and
that was great for him but there was
no way the bird could manage another
person-sized passenger, let alone two.
I dropped the oars, spun, yanked the
boat’s rope out from under Max, and
hurled it into the air.
The rope tan-
gled, uncoiled, started to fall, the bird
ﬂashed by overhead, the rowboat spun
down the smooth rushing surface of
the torrent - the rope snapped taut!
The eyebolt at the prow where the end
of rope was knotted creaked and began

to tear through the wood.
I grabbed
the rope and strained back against it
as hard as I could . . .
But the long moment passed and
the rope held, and the hole behind us
in the water ﬁlled, and the waves and
giant ripples began to race anew back
and forth across the surface of the river.
The bird let go of the rope and soared
exhaustedly away, and I picked up the
oars.
From the bottom of the boat I heard
a loud groan. I looked down.
Max had one eye half-open with part
of its pupil showing, and was trying to
lever himself up with a hand on the
side of the boat. "Karlini?" he croaked.
"Under control."
"Castle?"
"Up and gone."
Max’s eye slumped closed and he
sagged back into the bilge.
"Well,"

he said faintly, "I guess that was all
simple enough."

Chapter21
BACK AT THE
BILIOUS GNOME
IT WAS FINALLY GODSDAY. On
Godsday in a city like Roosing Oolvaya,
where no particular god held unchal-
lenged domination, shops were usually
open and people went about whatever
commerce they chose; other people, of
course, typically scurried from tem-

ple to temple, currying their accus-
tomed favor.
This was not a typical
Godsday, though, and so three activi-
ties were the most popular - cleaning
up and dredging out,
appealing to
the gods, and appealing to the spir-
its; the remaining bars were packed.
Cleanup might take weeks, reconstruc-
tion would take even longer, and the
owners of the two intact shipyards
would become very rich, but all of
that felt very long-term at the mo-
ment.
Even with all the work to be
done, many of the luckier inhabitants
of Roosing Oolvaya (and everyone who
had survived considered themselves
lucky, at least in some measure) felt
they deserved at least a moment’s cele-
bration.
The
common-ﬂoor
of
the
Bilious
Gnome might have been mistaken for a
hospital sickroom, what with the num-

ber of bruised, smashed, splinted, and
wrapped people in attendance.
Few
people in sickrooms, though, could tear
through a freshly roasted side of beef
with the abandon of Maximillian the
Vaguely Disreputable, who, beneath a
liberal swath of bandages, looked as
though he had just come off a three-
month stretch of dedicated dieting.
Attempting to match him bite-for-bite
from across the large table, and falling
further and further behind, was the
Great Karlini.
"Watch out with that
gravy, dear," said Ronibet, wiping a
small brownish glob from her sleeve,
"It’s all Max’s fault, anyway," Karlini
said, pausing in mid-chew and sliding
the words out the side of his mouth.
Max pointed a knife at him. "Don’t
forget who wandered into a castle that
didn’t belong to him in the ﬁrst place."
Karlini said something else around

his mouthful of food that this time was
totally unintelligible. "You’d better not
repeat that," Max said.
Wroclaw had produced a damp cloth
and was devoting his professional at-
tention to the gravy spot. He bent to
scrutinize his handiwork, lowering his
mouth to the level of Roni’s ear. "Mas-
ter Maximillian’s level of agitation is
still uncommonly high," he said in a
low voice.
"It’s Shaa," Roni murmured.
"He’s
worried about Shaa." Wroclaw glanced
casually toward the end of the table.
"With some justiﬁcation, it would ap-
pear."
Shaa was reclining in a large mud-
encrusted chair that was covered by a
fairly clean sheet, his legs elevated and
outstretched along a bench. He had a
ﬂagon balanced on the chair’s armrest.
"Thank you, no," Shaa said to Jurtan

Mont, who was reaching toward the
ﬂagon with the reﬁll pitcher.
"I am
suspicious enough of this beverage
as it is." Shaa sniffed ostentatiously
at his cup, then broke into a sudden
paroxysm of wet coughing.
Max looked sharply up.
He gazed
down the table at Shaa, his face blank.
Shaa indicated the ﬂagon, "Noxious
emanations," he said.
"It is possible
that water has inadvertently been sub-
stituted for the requested ale. Could I
interest you in a verifying taste?"
"I’ve had enough water in the last
few days to hold me for the next ﬁve
years," Max said. "Try it on your poi-
son tester, there."
Jurtan Mont, who was of course the
individual to whom Max had alluded,
opened his mouth to try a rejoinder.
His sister Tildamire kicked him un-
der the table. "A wise woman," Shaa

murmured approvingly to her.
"Re-
sponding to Max can often lead to
complications. Would you appropriate
the asparagus?"
Max’s attention had already wan-
dered. Recuperation from a bad spell-
drain ordinarily left his mind part
vegetable, and that part mostly onion,
garlic, and other roots known for their
nasty temperament. The major thing
on which he had focused his limited
concentration was indeed the problem
of Shaa.
Shaa had insisted on mak-
ing it in from the street under his
own power, but the effort had left him
breathless and drenched in sweat; his
face was still white and his breathing
difﬁcult now, almost two hours later. It
was graphic conﬁrmation of his state.
Shaa had told Max earlier that in his
professional opinion as a physician, he
might last six months.
On the other

hand, medical science being as impre-
cise as it was, the time could be closer
to six weeks. Or, he had added, a mira-
cle could occur. With Shaa’s resistance
to magic-based cures, though, ﬁxing
him would be a knotty problem.
Of
course, Max did have some ideas.
It
was about time to rid Shaa of those
damn curses anyway.
The only sounds for a moment were
those related to eating; the man now
calling himself the Creeping Sword
had just ﬁnished his story and every-
one was digesting as much of it as
they chose to. Karlini wiped his plate
with a chunk of bread.
"One thing I
don’t understand," he said, chewing
thoughtfully on the crust. "I still don’t
know how I got decoupled from the
castle.
Max had something in mind
but he didn’t know exactly how he was
going to work it.
That was while he

was awake – but when it came to it,
he wasn’t even awake, he was uncon-
scious."
"Then why did you jump?" said the
Creeping Sword. Karlini shrugged. "I
felt something all of a sudden, like
. . .
like indigestion all over my body,
maybe." Karlini glanced at the empty
bowl that had held the potatoes. Kar-
lini was quite fond of potatoes, and had
ﬁgured large in the bowl’s demise. "I
ﬁgured that was it, Max pulling me
loose, and it was, but anyway I didn’t
have a choice. I didn’t want to ride the
castle where it was going; it was al-
ready coming apart and I didn’t know
if it would survive the jump. I doubt it
did, by the way. I thought I might have
destabilized things enough on my own
for me to pull away without stopping
my heart again, and if I jumped I was
betting Haddo would catch me."

"Again to rescue comes faithful ser-
vant," Haddo said, a carrot disappear-
ing into the dark void inside his hood.
"Yes, thank you again, Haddo," Kar-
lini said.
"Lots of us thank you," said the
Creeping Sword. "Like me. You pulled
me out of that whirlpool."
"Good are thanks," Haddo said, "also
for faithful bird.
Welcome gives bird,
welcome give I. But thanks, everything
is not. When extreme is danger, demon-
strated is value of faithful servant, so
also perhaps would not mind faithful
servant particular recognition."
"What
recognition?"
Karlini
said.
"What are you talking about, Haddo?
Everybody knows what you did, every-
body’s thanked you."
"Am talking bonus," said Haddo.
Wroclaw’s ears perked up.
"You want a what?" Karlini said.

"Simple is word. Also, is pertinent
other topic, of contract to renegotiate,
of status to elevate. Great may Karlini
be, better not to also be cheap."
Karlini looked at his plate, then
at the dramatically shrunken carcass
dominating the table’s center.
"Roni,
how did that old heartburn recipe go?"
"Calm down, dear. Haddo, we’ll dis-
cuss this later."
"Wise is mistress," Haddo said, bow-
ing his hood demurely. "Always obedi-
ent, is faithful servant."
Karlini made a rude sound. "Quiet,"
Roni said, “ dear.
Then maybe you’ll
get an answer to your question. Max?"
"Well," Max said, "magic isn’t al-
ways strictly deterministic, you know.
The way the Sword describes it, some-
thing happens when he goes into this
spell-mode. What it is exactly, I don’t
know; some kind of resonance effect

against his metabolic link, maybe. It
sounds like he can say what he wants
a spell to do, but he doesn’t have to go
through the work of actually designing
the spell and setting it up.
He just
says, ’Do this,’ and the spell-ﬁeld tries
to ﬁgure out something that’s close to
what he wants. That sound plausible
to you, Sword?"
"I guess," said the Creeping Sword.
"But I don’t care. I’m getting rid of it
as soon as I can. I don’t want to cast
spells. I tried it three times and it only
worked right once."
"You got the results you wanted ev-
ery time, didn’t you?" Max said.
"In
my book that record’s pretty strong.
Anyway, in this case, the Sword’s spell-
mode decided the best way to ’Help
Karlini’ was to get me to help Karlini,
even if I wasn’t conscious, so it went in
and dug something out of my mind. I

wish I could remember what it was it
found."
"That’s not a very neat answer," said
Jurtan Mont. "What about -"
"In a mess like this you’re lucky if
you get one neat answer out of the
whole thing. Results are usually more
important than answers, anyway."
Shaa looked at Max; Roni and Kar-
lini looked at Max too, then looked
at each other. "Is that the same Max
we know who Just said that?" Karlini
whispered. "Who said answers aren’t
important?"
"I think so -"
Results, Jurtan Mont thought. Well,
okay; I found out some new stuff about
myself, stuff that doesn’t look half bad,
Tildy’s free, Dad’s square with Kaar,
Kaar’s getting square with the city, and
it looks like Dad may even be willing
to take another look at me, too. I guess

when you look at it that way, it’s really
not bad, not bad at all.
Max, for his part, was looking over
his own shoulder toward the door,
where the voice of a man had opened
up, bellowing, "You! Hey, you!"
"What’s your problem?" Max yelled
at him.
"We’ve paid for our space,
we’re just trying to have a pleasant
lunch here." Shaa had said the Bil-
ious Gnome was the only half-decent
place around that was halfway intact:
he’d assured Max there would be no
repercussions from any of his previous
escapades.
"Maximillian -" Shaa said across the
table.
The man in the door was fa-
miliar to him. He was the bartender
who’d been on duty the last time Shaa
had been at the Bilious Gnome, when
he and Jurtan Mont had been chased
by the Guard.
The man’s face was

proceeding through shades of color
heading toward purple.
"YOU!" he
said, pointing an accusing ﬁnger at
Shaa from the end of his outstretched
arm. "Get out of my place!"
"Are you the owner?" Shaa said.
"Don’t start nothing with me! I said
out, and out you -"
"I happen to be rather comfortable
at the moment," Shaa said, "and some-
what debilitated to boot, and as such
am reluctant to leave this" he indicated
the mud underfoot and the temporary
ladder leading to the second ﬂoor with
a wave of his own hand "inspiring and
tasteful establishment.
If you must
press the issue, let us discuss matters
with the owner."
The man who had served the party
emerged from the back room, rubbing
his hands on a gray towel. "What’s the
excitement here, folks?"

"Are you the owner?" Shaa said.
"I’ll do for it."
"You will do," Shaa said, "if you are
the owner."
The man squinted at him. "Are you
crazy?
Nobody’s seen the owner in
years.
I just manage the place, hold
part of the receipts back in case the
guy shows up. I ain’t never seen him
myself, you understand, but he’s the
kind of guy you don’t want to cross, if
you get my drift, they made that pretty
darn clear when his man bought the
place."
"How would you recognize him if he
does appear?" Shaa said slowly. Max
looked over at him, examining his face,
recognizing in his voice a certain note
of growing suspicion.
"When he bought the Gnome a cou-
ple years ago he sent over this little
crystal cube."

A
nonplussed
look
appeared
on
Shaa’s face,
a once-in-several-years
occurrence.
"Bring the cube," Shaa
said.
The manager looked at him, opened
his mouth, then closed it without a
word and went out into the back room.
A moment later he returned.
In his
hand was a small faded purple cloth
tied at the top with a drawstring, He
handed the bag to Shaa.
Shaa loos-
ened the string and inverted the bag
over his hand, and a clear crystal cube
about a thumb’s-length along each
edge dropped into his palm. Shaa scru-
tinized the cube with a contemplative
expression. Then he touched the ball
of his thumb to a depression in its
polished face.
Deep in the heart of the cube, a
strong purple glow burst out.
"I’ll get your money," said the man-

ager, and stumped off again toward the
back.
Shaa removed his thumb from
the cube, and the glow died. Everyone
at the table, all of whom had been star-
ing at the cube, shifted their gazes up-
ward to the face of Shaa. Shaa tilted
his head back and began to examine
the ceiling.
"You have anything you’re interested
in telling us?" Max said.
Shaa hrrumphed and cleared his
throat.
"Well, ah, you recall the pe-
riod when I was Waterfront Health
Inspector for Roosing Oolvaya? I, ah,
invested some of my proceeds in local
business. Actually, you see, I employed
a ﬁscal advisor, and I was a bit behind
on keeping track of things, ah, myself.
Then, well, the post of Health Inspec-
tor moved abruptly to another, and I
moved on, away from Roosing Oolvaya.
In some haste."

The manager was returning with a
hefty iron-bound chest.
He dropped it with a heavy thud on
the table in front of Shaa.
"My own place," Shaa said to him,
glancing sadly around the room at the
broken windows, smashed staircase,
holes in the walls, and fractured ta-
bles still left from his own earlier visit,
and at the superimposed damage from
the ﬂood, "and in such a state. Friend
Manager, you should make it a point to
cultivate a better class of clientele in
the future.”
