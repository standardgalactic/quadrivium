Mony men ore iust one skill owoy from hoving the kind of interoctions with
women thot they wont. Jocob wos on exomple of this. Thirty-four yeors
old, successfi.rl in his business, fit ond o shor;c dresser, he didn't understrcnd
why he wosn't more successful with women. He noticed thot his friends-
some of whom were sloppier, fotter ond less finonciolly successful-
seemed to be oble trc get women, but somehow he couldn't. He could tolk
tc women but olwoys ended up "iust friends." h wos discouroging.
Jocob thought he wqs miles ond miles owoy from his gool of being suc-
cessful with women; in focf, he wosn'l. He hod iust obout every skill he
needed to succeed with women ond o lot more, but he didn't know how
to tolk to women so they felt he wos "romontic moteriol." Thot wos the
one skill he wos missing. Once we tought him the bosic Flirting Moves
ond the skills of tolking to women, his level of success with them rose
dromoiicolly.
You moy hove o similor problem. Secretly, like Jocob, you moy hove
wondered if there wos something wrong with you. You moy hove
thought thot there's something obout you thot you couldn't see but thot
women could which drove them owoy. Or, like Jocob, you moy feor thot
you hove some bosic flow *rot continuolly sets you up lo be "iust friends"
wilh women.
The good news is thot nothing could be further from the hulh. Sure,
you've got problems. Eveqybody does. But os you've probobly seen,
plcnty of men with more problems thon you succeed with women. The

good news is lhere's no bosic flow inside of you thot keeps you from
hoving the relotionship you desire. lf you con communicote ot oll, you
con creote romontic connections wifi women. You moy simply be one
skillowoy.
When you're one skill owoy from being o good seducer,you're like o cor
with one flot tire. A cor with one flot tire drives os though it hos some-
thing seriously wrong with it. lt's impossible to control, the ride is rough,
ond chonces ore you'll never gel where you wont to go in it. Driving it,
you'd be likely to conclude thot it hos serious, serious problems.
Once you reolize thot the problem is o flot tire, though, you see thot iust
becouse the problem wos noticeoble didn't necessorily meon thot it wos
fotol. By fixing the flot-o simple l0-minute procedure once you know
how to do it-you tronsform the entire cor ond con gel where you wont
to go eosily.
When Jocob leorned thot the flot tire in his doting system wos his inobil-
ity to tolk trc women in o woy thot mode them think romontic thoughts
obout him, he wos oble to correcl the problem ond his interoctions with
women improved instontly. He hod the missing piece ond wos qble to
seduce women.
Your problems, loo, moy not be os big os you thought. A simple set of
new skills moy moke oll the difference. lf you've ever leorned ony skill
then you con leorn how to tolk to women; you've simply never been
tought how before. l/s like leorning ony new procedure. Once you mos-
ter fie bosics, the rest seems eosy. This book will teoch you whot you

There ore two types of communicotors. You must figure out which type
of communicotor you ore, becouse eoch type must proctice ond use the
skills in this book differently.
rflB lll[l|0uG||leD $0ln|nllnruam||
Most of our studenls, ond most of lhe men who ore ottrocled lo our work,
ore inlroverled communicotors. These ore men who cotegorize them-
selves os shy. They hove o hord time tolking with women ond ore more
likely to end up o wollflower thon the lih of the porty. These men often
hove no clue qbout whot to soy lo women ond need lo slort very slow-
ly, toking one smoll slep ot o lime ond building from there.
The primoqy chollenge for the introverled communicotor is leorning to
express himself. He needs lo intensify ond escolote his signols by 500
percenl. He needs ic focus on tolking more loudly, moking more eye
conloct, overcoming his shyness, being curious, osking queslions, show-
ing romontic interest ond toking risks. ln short, he doesn't need to worry
obout toning himself down; he needs to worry obout turning himself up.
ile Hr[1|0u0l|m[ c0nlnffilcauol|
The extroverted communicotor tends to be enthusiostic, silly ond fun.
These ore often men who ore in soles, teoching or other fields thot
involve lots of interoctions wifi people.
lr,&r${N8tsi!!e
Extroverted communicoicrs odore being the center of ottention. They
oren'l necessorily scored to tolk to women, but they often don'l know whot
trc soy. They often think thot the woy trc seduce o womon is trc turn up the
volume of their personolity. This is whot the introverted communicotor
needs trc do-but for the extroverted communicoicr; il's o reol mistrrke.
lf you're on exlroverled communicolor, ky listening more, tolking more
solty ond chilling out. Don't try so hord. ln short, the exlroverted com-
municotor doesn'l need to worry obout turning himself up; he needs to
worry obout toning himself down.
As you reod this book, keep in mind which type of communicotor you
ore. This will influence your decisions obout how oggressively you use
this moteriol.

lf you ore like most of our sfudenls, tolking to women seems complicot-
ed, confusing ond difficult. Yes, there will be chollenges os you leorn to
tolk to women, but if you're willing to slort ot the beginning ond do the
work involved, over time you'll succeed. Unfodunotel, mony of us think
thot fie best woy to go obout leorning is to skip the first slep, or even
the first few steps, ond to go directly lo "lhe good stuff." Building o firm
foundotion in the first few simple steps of tolking to women will help dro-
moiicolly once you stort opplying those steps to the more complex skills
we will present loter in this book.
A bod seducer-let's coll him Bob-hos trouble becouse he hosn't mqs-

Seducing women by tolking to them is o process. The first step of thot
process is onswering the question "How do you get thot initiol conloct
with o womon?" Aftrer we hove onswered thot question, we will go on to

We hotre lrite, useless odvice like "Just be yourselP' or "Just go tolk to
her!" This kind of odvice is worse thon useless becouse it offers nothing
specific to do yet leoves you feeling bod obout yourself for not following
it. Sure, being yourself is o good thing, but how should you do thot with
women? More specificolly, which port of yourself should you be? We oll
weor mony hots in our lives. When you opprooch o womon, should you
be the self you ore ot work? The self you ore ot church? The self you ore
ot o strip club? We oll need lo cultivote the romontic ports of ourselves-
the ports thot ore noturolly fun ond seducfive, but iusl soying you should
do so is nol enough. lf iust being yourself hod worked, you wouldn't be
reoding this book. "Just be yourselP' is pretty worthless odvica.

The some goes for "Just go tolk to her." We've oll been given this lome
odvice, but most of us hove no clue whot fo tolk to o womqn obout. The
o$er doy, o shockingly beoutiful young womon we know wos wonder-
ing oloud to us why our books, oudio courses ond other moteriol ore
necessory ot oll. 'All you hove to do is go up to people ond tolk ond iust
be yourself," she told us. "lt olwoys works for me!" As she soid this, her
full breosts rose ond fellwith eoch breoth ond her beoutiful blonde hoir
swoyed os she moved her heod.
We olso know o mon who is o model in o lorge city. When we go out
with him, we're olwoys omozed*hol women opprooch him ond give
him their phone numbers. He olso likes to tell us his "secrel": "Just be
yourself qnd tolk trc women! lt's reolly not o big deql!"
Obviously, both these people moke most of us wont to vomit with roge.
You don't hove to work hord ot leorning how to tolk to the opposile sex
if you ore in the top .01 percent of beoutiful people; if you're thot hot,
the world will beot o poth to your door. For the rest of us, lhere ore spe-
cific skills to leorn, which ore much more effective thon "Just be yourselP'
ond "Just go tolk lo her."
Our work hos olwoys been obout breoking complex sociql interoctions
infic teochoble steps so lhose who employ our methods con succeed. Our
ctudents hove discovered o new level of eose ond freedom with women
when they've leorned lo use this moteriol. We'll stort smoll, so thot no
mqller how shy you hove been, no motler how shut down you've been,
no motter how mony problems you've hod with women, you will be oble

We remember how hord it wos to tolk to women ond how much couroge
it took for us to lronsform our skills ond our obilities. We remember how
we wished we hod help in figuring out whqt to do, ond we remember
how we hod to stort with very smoll steps before we could move on to
longer conversotions. We hod to figure out tolking to women firough
triol ond error. At first we constontly foiled. We were eoch os uncom-
fortoble ond owkword when tolking to women os ony guy we've ever
met. We foiled more often thon you've foiled, ond we mode fools out of
ourselves time ofter time-but we stuck with it ond tronsformed our dot-
ing lives. We mention this not to tool our own horns but to give you
hope. No motler where you ore in your life, no motler how little experi-
ence you hove with women, there is hope. You con leorn to seduce
women. You con leorn how to tolk to women. And you con hove the suc-
cess you wonl.

You con'l be on effective seducer unless you feel self-expressed oround
women. A mon who is self-expressed hos chorocter. By thot we meon
thot he's on individuolwho follows his own poth. He feels confideni mok-
ing decisions obout where he wonts to toke his life. He embroces fie
woys in which he is similor to os well os ihe woys in which he is differ-
enl from others. He is oble to be himself without being overly concerned
obod how women will respond-ond he's not tqying to control or fix
women. He is outhentic ond honest. He doesn'l squelch himself, suppress
himself or hide from life.

When we soy thot you should be selFexpressed, this olso meons thot you
must find your own woy with the moteriol in this book. None of our
books or oudio courses ore designed to be o set of rules lo box you in.
We oll hove different opprooches with this moleriol-even we, Ron Louis
ond Dovid Copelond, hove very different opprooches from one onoth-
er. We ogree on the fundomentols bui we opprooch them differently.
The moin commonolity omong oll effective seducers is thot eoch
embroces his unique opprooch ond style. The best woy for you to com-
municote with women is to find your unique style. Otherwise you'll seem
foke qnd feel qwkwqrd when tolking lo women.
l-e/s digress for o second ond look ol the opposite of selFexpression:
withholding, feeling bottled up ond unoble to tolk to women. We've
bund thot men ore most upset, frustroted ond ploin ol' nuts when they
oren't self-expressed. Not getting loid doesn't drive guys nuts; o guy con
go months without getting loid. Whot drives men nuts is nol interocting
wiih women, not tolking lo women, hiding oul ol home ond not being in
lhc gome. Whot drives men nuls is hoving the desire to moke conlocl
wilh women ond not doing onything obout it.
Avoiding the risks of life drives men crozy-not foiling or being reiect-
rd, When you're engoged in life, toking risks ond interocting with
womon, women will find you ottroclive. Whot foils every time, however,
lr rioying on the sidelines of life feeling bottled up ond depressed.

Your first tosk on the poth to becoming o seducer is lo underslond ond
occepl thot you, the mon, ore going to hove to interrupt women in order
to get their ottention ond stort o conversolion.
Le/s exomine the word "intrerruption." h's o horsh word. Most of us osso-
ciole interrupting people with being rude, obnoxious or disrespectful.
For mony of us, this is especiolly true regording interrupting women.
When we soy interruplion, we don't meqn to imply being rude or
obnoxious ot oll. We use the word inlerruption, though, becouse it com-
municoles o horsh truth obout tolking to women: when you first interoct
with o womon, you will probobly hove lo do something specific to direct
her otlenlion owoy from whotever else is going on in her life ond toword
you. You ore going to hove to toke some oclion-though os you will see
it doesn't hove to be o big oction-to get her ottention. There's forceful-
ness oboul the word interruption thot describes the energy you will need
to do this.
As you hove no doubt noticed, women ore usuolly not thinking obout
you. They ore off in their own world, on their own vector, in their own
flow. Hot women ore not likely to come up to you ond soy, "Hey, yov
look like on interesting guy. lwould love to hove o conversolion with you
ond then seduce you." Therefore, if you ore going to interoct with
women, your first tosk is to get their ottention. And you get their otten-
tion by interrupting fiem.

ln o certoin sense/ you ore interrupting women on o deeper ond deep-
er level with every stoge of o seduclion. You inlerrupt her when you first
soy hi to her. You inlerrupt her on increosingly deeper levels when you
tolk for the first lime, when you osk for her number ond emoil oddress,
when you hove Romontic Conversotions, when you osk her for ond con-
duct the first dote, when you go for the first kiss ond so on. You ore
olwoys interrupting her ond initioting something deeper. The burden of
initioting ond interrupting women will be on your shoulders until you
die. The tools in this book will help you corry thot lood. ln foct, they con
turn this burden into o boon for you - not iusl with women but with every
oreo of your life.

Sometimes o mon will osk us, '!Vhy should I risk reiection? lsn'l this the
oge of equolity? Why don't women initiote with me, ond interrupt me?"
You know, it/s funny-women tolk o lot obout how men don't feel
enough. They comploin thoi men oren't more sensilive ond bemoon how
oll thot "mole privilege" ond "mole power" hove mode men shut down
emotionolly. Well, you know the truth os well os we do. Men's egos
oren'l o mess becouse men ore so oll-powerful or becouse men live lives
of complete ond totol privilege qnd eose. Men's egos ore o mess
becouse they don't hove ony tools for hondling relection, ond they hove
tc throw their ego in the sewer every lime they opprooch-ond risk
bcing reiected by-o womon. So of course men oren'l going to be emo-
tionolly sensitive. Constonl reiection mokes you wont to be o little less
cmotionolly sensitive, right? Whot on oslonishing surprise.

Here's the bottom line: women don'l opprooch you becouse doting is not
foir. Thot's why. They don't wonl to throw their egos in the sewer, ond
they don't hove io becouse they're women. They ore ollowed to demond
equolity os much os they wont ond still leove oll the risking of initiotion
to you (ot leost in the eorly ports of doting).
We suggest thot you occepl thot this is the woy it is qnd thot insteod of
being upset obout it, you reolize thot this octuolly gives you o certoin
kind of power. lf you hove to do oll the interrupting ond initioting, you
gei to soy when you will opprooch o womon. You get to soy when you
will osk her ouf you get to soy when you will fli* with her. Once you
stort seeing thot hoving to do oll the initioting ond hoving to toke oll the
risks gives you the power to go ofter whot you wonl, lhe fqct fhot women
don't hove to initiote with men will not bother you so much.
Okoy, our little men's rights speech is over. We ogree thot you hove
every right to be mod obout this stote of offoirs-but stoying mod does-
n't work. lt won't get you the girl. The good news is thqt when you know
how trc toke the proper risks with women, one step ot o time, you don't
hove to shut down your emotions ond become on unfeeling ierk in order
lo initiqte with women. And once you know how to do it, you'll be qble
to go ofter the women you wont with o lot more freedom thon most
women feel they hove lo go ofter the men they desire.
Your obility to initiote with ond interrupt women is criticol. Everything in
this book is built on thot skill. Successful seducers understond the stoges
of seduction ond ore willing lo stort ot the beginning. Before we give you
specific woys to stort inlerrupting women, it will be helpful for you to

As you leorn to interrupt ond initiote with women, you must remember
rhot oll your interoctions with women bosicolly boil down lo o numbers
gome. A certoin omounl of the time you will succeed; the resl of the time
you won't. The greot thing is thot if you hove enough interocfions, your
success is oll but qssured.
lfs like the insuronce solesmon who knows thot he needs to moke 75
cold colls to get one oppointment ond thot it trckes four oppointments to
get one sole. Therefore, he knows thqt he needs to moke 300 cold colls,
give or toke, lo get one sole. He knows ifs o numbers gome ond thot oll
he hos to do is to continue moking those colls. Eventuolly the numbers
willwork in his fovor ond he'll mqke o sole. With women, it might toke
l0 interruplions to get one conversotion, 10 conversotions to gel one
phone number qnd l0 numbers to get one dote. This is good to know
becouse eqch "foiled" interoction brings you closer trc success.
ln How lo Succeed wilh Women, we wrote time ond ogoin fiot doting

thot doting is o numbers gome becouse knowing thot will help keep you

The key difference between successful seducers ond unsuccessful ones is
thot the successful ones know il's o numbers gome ond keep going no
motler whot. Unsuccessful seducers whine to their friends, hide in their
bedrooms or feel upset ond give up opprooching women entirely. Troin
yourself to see thqt opprooching women is o numbers gome.

Men olten feel bod obout themselves when they see on opportunity to
opprooch or tolk to o womon ond they don't toke it. They don't toke the
opportunity becouse they ore scored or upset or becouse they simply
don't know whot to soy. This leods to missed opportunities ond plenty of
good old-foshioned self-criticism. "l wos such on idiot not to tolk to her,"
hese guys will soy tc themselves. 'Whot o moron I om. I con't believe how
stupid I wos not to tolk to her. lt wos o perfe'ct opportunity. She wos so hot.
l'll probobly never gel on opportunity like thot ogoin, ond I blew itl"
There ore lots of times in life when beoting up on yourself to get your-
self to behove better is o good ideo. There ore lots of times when it
works. Unbrtunotely, this is not one of those times. When you don't toke
on opportunity with o womon ond then punish yourself for not toking it,
you lusl ottoch o lot of poin to the whole ideo of toking opportunities to
tolk to women. This mokes you less likely to tolk to o womon the next
time on opporfunify comes up/ nol more.
There's o sequence in the woy most men treot opportunities with women.
First, you don'l see opporfunities ot oll. h seems like there ore no women
on his plonet for you trc interoct with. Second, you stort to see opporfuni-
l{}*syyr!$&iil!; l**e!s{}.'{iri&, Eiif i*si*$ {gl, **tt -fxpllsssi'3}!
ties but don'l yet hqve the obility to trrke them. lf you ollow yourself to let
thot be okoy, in time you simply find yourself storting to toke those oppor-
tunities thot life presents to you. Howeve4 if you beot yourself up for not
trcking opportunities, this sequence is disrupted. Beoting yourself up for not
toking opporlunities iust mokes it horder to see ond trcke them in the future.
People who troin group focilitotors know thot this is true. At first, students
moy hwe no ideo ot oll obout how to leod o certoin type of process in
o group; they simply wotch in owe qs other people leod. ln time, they
stort to understond how to leod but they don't quite know the process
well enough to step oul ond octuolly leod; they wotch from the sidelines,
full of good ideos obout how they would leod o process but not quite
reody to toke chorge themselves. lf they ollow this to hoppen without
beoting up on themselves, in time they simply nolice thot they ore step-
ping out ond leoding*ond nothing speciol needs to hoppen for thot to
occur. lf they beot lhemselves up, however, they stoll the entire leorning
process ond moke it horder to toke oction when the time comes.
Once you breok the link between seeing on opportunity ond feeling bod
obout not toking it, you cqn breok the hold thot this cycle hos over you.
Wc suggest thot you let yourself go through o phose of purposely not
toking opportunities with women. Just observe them ond let yourself feel
good obout yourself even when you oren't toking them. Soy lo yourself,
'l'm oble to see opportunifies, ond thot/s on importont step. l'll toke
opporfunities loter." ln time, your nervous systrem will be so used to spot-
llng opportunities thot it will be much eosier to trrke them.

ln this book we ore going to teoch you effuctive trcols thot con help you hwe
deep, romontic ond seductive conversotions with women. But lc wield these
tools effectMely you musl underslrcnd the noture of risking with women.
Doing ony of the things we tolk obout in this book will require toking
some risk. Most men ore exlremely overse to risking with women; they
live their lives trying to ovoid it. Mony men who oren'l successful with
women ore committed to eliminqting risk with women; tho/s their unsuc-
cessful strotegy for.success.
Men ore obsessed with not risking with women moinly for two reosons.
Firsl, they don't wont to be hurt by o risk gone wrong. lt totolly sucks to
toke some big risk with o \ /omon only to be shot down in one of the
olmost infinite number of woys women hove of shooting down men.
Second, men-especiolly shy men-wont to eliminote risk with \/omen
becouse they ore ofroid thot they will somehow hurt the womon they risk
ill9G,_,'Ulsiilt itg$lvrr" S{I{. LOrtUIlUts {Ut i{lt "{fprgJniuf
with. They ore ofroid thot if they toke o risk, the womon will be upset,
offended or emotionolly domoged in some woy.
For ihese men, the opporent onswer to both of these problems is
decreosing risk ond increosing control over their interoctions with
women. They stort looking for the foolproof, olwoys-completely-in-con-
trol, no-risk system for seducing women. Like o bod solesmon who seeks
thot "mogic close" thot will force o customer to buy, buy,buy, o guy who
con't risk with women will look for psychologicol tools thot con force o
womon to be ottrocted to him. He'll buy pig-pheromone colognes, hop-
ing the scent will owoken o womon's inner vixen. He'll ploy "subliminol
seduclion" oudiotopes for her, hoping it will somehow creote chemistqy
between them. Or he'll tqy to leorn hypnosis, hoping to use it to bom-
boozle o womon into toking her ponts off. He does oll this in on ottempt
ic eliminote oll risk with o womon ond to estoblish in its ploce complete
conhol over qll of his interoctions with her.
There ore severol problems with this. First, eliminoting oll risk with o
womon ond estoblishing complete control over your interoctions with her
doesn't work. ln foct, il's the opposite of whot works with women. Think
obout how you feel when you're wilh someone who's committed to com-
plebly controlling your interoction with him ond the outcome of thot inter-
oction: you con't get owoy fost enough. Well, thof's exoctly how women
belwih o mon who's committed to eliminoting risk, controlling the inter-
oction ond forcing o cerloin outcome. (solesmen ore sometimes like this.)
h doesn't motler how good o pre-scripted rop you come up with; i/s

Second, most men get discouroged with me$ods of seducing women in
which the monlrq seems lo be "control, iontrol, control." Men wonl to
be oble to express themselves ond creote successful, seductive interoc-
tions wifi women. As one mon told us, "lf I wonted to hide behind o
'foke self,' fien I might os well go to o proslitule." lf you wont onything
deep or spontoneous with women, eliminoting qll risk ond controlling
everything is not the woy to get it.
At the some time, it olso doesn'l work to "iust do if'-to toke huge risks
with women oll of the time. We used to know o guy whose life's philos-
ophy wos "Go for lhe roor." This meont thot every time he sow some-
thing scoqy or risky, he hod to do it-becouse if he didn't, os he put it,
he "wosn'f reolly living his life." We think this is ridiculous, ond the trou-
ble it creoted in his life bocks us up on thot. Just becouse you con toke
o huge risk with o womon doesn't meqn thot you should.
Just os risking becouse you con isn'l the onswer, letting go of qll control
in your inleroctions with women is probobly o bod ideo trco. Letting go
of guiding or directing conversqlion in ony woy will oll too often gel you
onother femole "triend," ond we've qll hod quite enough of thot.
lf eliminoting risk entirely ond controlling every'hing doesn't work with
women, ond toking oll the risks you con ond letting go of oll control
doesn't work, whol does? The onswer is thot you must loke risks, but you
musl toke them in o sensible, oppropriote ond orderly foshion.
Surprisingly ond porodoxicolly, you octuolly provide more of o sense of
both sofety ond excitement to women when you toke intelligent ond
oppropriote risks with lhem one step ol o lime. Tho/s whot creotes both
chemistry ond trust.

Mony men think thot when they toke o risk with o womon they ore some-
how toking something from her, but the iruth is this: when you toke on
oppropriofie risk with o womon you ore giving something to her. Your
risk with her creotes o spoce for her fo toke o risk bock with you, which
builds trust, sofety ond ottroclion with you. lf you don't ioke o risk with
her there's no spoce for her to risk with you, qnd she con't hove o relo-
tionship with you, even if she wonis one.
Think of it this woy: often o guy will woit oround for o womon to risk
with him before he risks with her. He wonts her to soy hi, he wonts her
trc osk him out, he wonts her to go for the first kiss. But why should o
womon do something you oren't willing to do? Remember, most of the
lime q womon is looking to you to set the poce ond feel for your inter-
oction. lf you toke q smoll risk with her, she will see on opening to do
lhe some wiih you. lf you toke no risks ot oll, try to keep conlrol of every-
thing ond work lo force o certoin outcome with her, she will do the some
with you-ond itwon't be the outcome you wont. She will be controlling
ond defensive, ond her gool will be to get owoy from you.
Ar o generol rule, women will only risk os much os you do, if thot much.
When you toke on oppropriole risk with o womon, it octuolly provides
on opening for her to be self-expressed ond hove fun with you. This is
whot we meon when we soy thot you must provide risks for women.
Whcn you toke on oppropriote risk with o womon, you give her the
opportunity trc risk bock with you. Thot's providing o risk, ond it's the
foundotion for creoting chemistqy ond trust with women.

When the two of you toke o smoll risk together-for instonce, you moy
provide o risk by winking qt her ond she moy risk smiling bock-o little
trust is built between you. You con then build on thot trusl to provide o
slightly lorger risk. For instonce, you moy provide o risk by osking her
'Whofs the story behind lhot?" obout her neckloce, ond she moy toke
o risk by telling you obout how she got it on o trip to Centrol Americo.
When thot risk hos gone well, there is even more trust between you. You
con then provide the next lorger risk ond she con risk bock. ln lime, o
sense of trust ond sofety develops.
Simultoneously, this process creotes o reol sense of excitement ond
chemistry between you. The two of you ore constontly in the process of
being "on the edge" with eoch other, constontly reveoling o little more
of yourselves with every risk, olwoys trusting ond risking o little more
eoch time. Thot process is where excitement ond chemistry come from.
Thot process is where o lot of oilroclion comes from. And thot is o
process you con leorn how to monoge without being conlrolling, trying
to eliminote risk or ottempting to force on oulcome.

Building o relotionship with o womon is o lot like building o house in which
your intimocy ond connection con live. You build thot house one brick ol o
time. Every lime you fiake o risk ond she trckes one bock ond it works, you
put onolher brick in the wolls of the house. After o while you've built four
wolls of trust thot con contnin the relotionship you hwe with her.
;{}s*n***}}}9r w{}}s*{}. *1,**. ,;{pi*$it}lq $*l} $i*if"f}i$risiii'it}tx
lf you risk too much loo fosl, you ore trying to live in the house before it
is built, ond trouble will come if ony problems occur. At the some time,
if you don't risk ot oll, you never even build o foundotion for o relotion-
ship, much less the four wolls ond roof. The level of risk you should toke
is reloted to how much of this house you hove built. lf you hove o lot of
trust built up from toking mony risks together you con proceed lo some
bigger risks. lf you don't hove o lol of trust built up you need to toke
smoller risks.
lfs importont to underscore thot trust is built over lime ond thot chemistry
ond ottroction ore not the some os trust. A mon who doesn't hove much
hcility or experience with risk will trust o womon woy too fost. He'll trusl
hcr utterly ond completely with his entire heort the moment he experi-
onces ony chemistry with her. Thofs o reolly bod ideo.
Wc hod one student who wos doting o women whom he wos cerloin
wq3 "fhe one" ofter only one dote. He wos hoving tremendous success
wih her os he meosured it: she seemed to like him, it wos very exciting
ond delightful to be with her ond they were hoving omozing sex togeth-
rr, He iumped in deep, reolly opening his heort lo her in o motler of
doyr, totolly risking himself emotionolly. After oll, whot could possibly go
Yvrpng in such o whirlwind romonce?
Wrll, plenty could go wrong ond plenty did go v/rong. After o couple of
vrtkr, this "perfect womon" disoppeored. She rorely returned his colls
qnd rtrcrted blowing off their dotes. Finolly she told him, "l like you, but

iionship right now. Besides, l'm sort of seeing this other guy..." He wos
devostoted, heodbroken ond even more ofroid of toking risks with
women thon he hod been before.
When you meet o hot womon with whom you hove greof chemislry, yovr
tendency might be to toke big emotionol risks with her os quickly os you
con. Thot is o big mistoke. h's insone to risk your entire heort right owoy.
Toke smoll risks one ot o time ond build fust over time. lf you risk too
much too quickly you'll hove your heort sploftered oll over the povement,
ond you'll hove short, possionole offoirs thot end with you being heort-
broken qnd olone.
Thot hoppens when you iump in too deep too fost, ond you do thot when
you misfoke chemistqy for truslworthiness. Just becouse you hove chem-
istry with o womon doesn't meon she won't floke out on you. lt doesn't
meon she won't hove emotionol problems thot will couse her to leove. lt
doesn'l meon you con counl on her. But when you hove greot chemistry
with o womon, you're oll too likely to think thot it meons you con count
on her, ond you'll end up risking too much with her.
The solution is trc go sloily ond build trust with o womon before you give
her your heort fully. ln other words, you must risk slowly, over time, in
the woy we will show you. lf you ore going trc foll in love with o womon
you ore reolly ottrocted lo, you need to toke risks one slep ol o lime to
find out if you con lrust her. You need to know if she's o psycho who's
going trc go nuls ond toke off on you, breoking your heort. You con only
find this out by risking the proper omount ot the proper tempo.

On the up side, most women ore incredibly ottrocted to o mon who con

things slowly ond build o connection \ /e con trust." Soying this sort of
thing tends to moke o womon feel reolly sofe wifi you ond desire you
oll the more. After oll, you oren't just trying to get os much sex out of
her os you con, like oll those other guys. She likes this; therefore, she
wonls lo hove sex with you. A mon slowing things down ond risking with

Le/s look ot how to provide risks for women. Mosl nice guys do not toke
enough risks qnd they do not provide enough risks for women, so
women hove loo few opportunities to toke risks bock. How do you pro-

trc put up o hundred dollors. But if she puts up o penny bock, you know
you con tqke the risk to put up o nickel. lf she gives you o nickel bock,
you con then put up o dime.
Let's give some specific exomples now of the kinds of risks you con toke
ot different levels: penny risks, dollor risks ond $10 dollor risks.
l"Greet," we heor you soying-"now lolking wilh women is like bonk-
ing ond investing." Who would've known?)
Bizorrely, though, thot is whot tolking lo women is like. Successful
investors leorn lo toke intelligent finonciol risks; most of fie time they
leorn how fo do thqt by toking smoll risks ond moving up to lorger ones
os they gei better ot it. As o resuh, they get better returns thon do peo-
ple who never invest their money, who never firke ony risks with it ond
who leove it in the bonk eorning interest ot three percent or less. By
leorning obout intelligent risk, successful inveslors ore oble to leveroge
lheir ossets, toking the risks thot deliver the best returns.
Penny Risks. You con think of the first risks you toke with o womon-
the interruptions thol ollowyou to speokwith her-os penny risks. Soying
hi is o penny risk. So is moking eye contocl, winking ot her, smiling ot
her, checking out her body ond the other Flirting Moves. Eoch one of
these smoll octions tokes o risk with o womon ond gives her the oppor-
tunity to risk bock with you by being responsive in some woy. lf she does
respond with o risk of her own, you ore in business ond con move on lo
the dollor risks.

Dollor R.isks. The dollqr risks ore lorger, but if the penny risks went
well, why not move on? Complimenting o womon is o dollor risk, os is
osking o question we'll teoch you, 'lVho/s the story behind rhot?" The
Goodbye lntroduclion, which you'll leorn, is o dollor risk, os is Situotionol
Flirting, Deepening ond osking Romontic Questions. These risks oll pro-
vide her with the opportunity to risk more by shoring more obout herself
with you. So she storts to risk liking you, which meons she could get hurt.
These risks ore whot generote the excilement in o relotionship.
$ t O Oollqr R.isks. Asking for her number ond emqil oddress, setting
up o dote, showing up for the dole, doing somelhing together on the
dote, touching her, going for the first kiss ond being even more sexuol
ore oll bigger risks. These risks ond oll the risks thot leod up lo her shor-
ing her life with you, even if only for o little while. She slorts to risk thot
you might chonge her life in woys she did not plon on.
This is on exciting process for both of you. And with eoch new risk you
evoluote how it went before toking the next one. lf o smoll risk did not
pon oul, don't go on to toke o bigger risk. lnsteod, you might wonl to
toke o smoller risk ond see if thot works. This is oll o motter of risking
step by step.
lfs importont for you to reolize the risks you provide when deoling with
women. Eoch risk offers o spoce for mogic to hoppen between the two
of you, ond it's o gift thot you os o mon provide. You're not perpetroF
ing evil or hurting someone else; you're providing thot excitement thot
women need so much.

Everything we will teoch you in this book is to some degree o risk you
will hove lo toke with women. By knowing thot ond by being oble to tqke
those risks one step ot o lime, you will hove the power to creole excite-
menl ond trust in your inleroctions with women. Of course, some of
those risks won't work out, but we'll teoch you how to hondle reiection
too. ll/s oll port of leorning how to tolk to women.
As you use the tools in this book, your monlro should not be "control, con-
hol, conhol." Thot will only get you intrr trouble. Your monlro should be
"risk, risk, risk." lntelligent risks, token step by step. By using these tools
to risk being romontic rother thon to conhol the interoction, you will be
oble to mqnqge the orderly unfolding of o relotionship. lt moy be short-
term, il moy be long term. lt moy be deeply intimote, it moy be purely
sexuol. But there will be o reol connection-ond you won't hove to sell
yourself out to get it.

An importont ospect of self-expression is curiosity. h's similor to enthusi-
osm: you've goi lo use it or lose it. Once you've repressed your curiosi-
ty long enough, it tokes time to gel it bock.
Mony of us were tought os children not lo osk questions, to ovoid being
loo curious. We qll know the expression "curiosity killed the cot." Asking
questions ond being curious were often soid to couse trouble.
N,l$*Nr|jp$i;i$ &XsrNr*ll_ *is&, $[!8i']$i&i| *il$ &{}ls"*lrsFesfi i*ii
Another "problem" with curiosity is thot when you stort osking questions
you slop being in conhol of the interocfion. When you osk o womon
questions obout herself, suddenly you're nol in control of whot she might
soy. As we've soid, most guys come to us wonting o line or rouline.
They're looking for o structure they con impose on on interoction thot
will keep them in control ond get her romonticolly interested. But when
you loke the risk of not knowing whot is going to hoppen, ond surren-
der to the choos of interoctions ond conversotions with women, you're
more likely to connect with them ond more likely to come ocross os fun
ond ottroclive.
You con stort the process of letting out your curiosity by osking \ /omen
questions ond simultoneously letting go of ony oufcome. Let go of trying
to get into her ponls ond getting her number (for o second) ond iust see
if it feels different. We're not soying thot trying to get info her ponts is o
bod thing ot oll-we're iust soying thqt when you concentrotre on getting
into her ponts os your sole oulcome ifs very difflcult to moinloin o con-
versotion ond therefore hord to get into her ponls.
You never know where q conversotion is going to go wifi o womon, but
if you've got to stoy in control ond reslroin your own curiosity ond never
osk o queslion you don't olreody know the onswer tc you'll never be suc-
cessful. Most men lusl give up becouse not knowing where on interoc-
tion is going is iust too scory.
Another odvontoge of leorning to be curious is thot i/s not the leost bit
monipulotive or scom-oriented. When you toke risks with women ond
they risk with you, reol intimocy con develop.

We're now going tc explore how to osk women questions. This is not
rocket science. So mony men feel like they need trc know the right things
to soy to o womon. The truth is thot you don't need speciolized esoteric
queslions; you iust need to know how to be curious ond osk questions.
Le/s look ot the different kinds of questions you con osk. There qre ini-
tiol questions, the first questions you osk someone. Then there ore fol-
low-up queslions, which follow up on the response to your first question.
Pretty simple so for, right? You got it. The bosic sequence is you osk o
question, she responds ond you osk onolher question. lt s olmost like
hoving o reol live conversotion where you ore opening your mouth ond
tolking! One question leods to onother ond before you know it women
ore reveoling themselves to you. They ore risking themselves to you ond
you ore risking with them by osking questions ond reveqling yourself.
Here ore some hondy, eosy-fo-use rules for osking queslions ond hoving
good conversotions with women.

you get your hoir so ugly?" or "How did you get so slupid?," you oren'l
going to go onyraAere good. We include these only for comic relief.

Mony of our students moke the error of moking siotements rother thon
osking questions. For exomple, o student recently told us thot he'd osked
o womon o question the other doy. Here's how he described it: 'lVe
were qt o concert ond I soid to her, 'The floor sure is sticky."'Well, tho/s
not o queslion, ond thot doesn't offer much of on opening for her to
respond. You need to osk questions thot evoke o response from her, not
simply mqke slotemenls.

lf you were ol o concert ond you wolked up to o womon ond soid, "l
sure like the bond," Louis ond Copelond would come to your house ond
breok your finger. This is o slotrement obout yourself, not o question
obout her. You must leqrn the difference. This point seems simple, bul
mony guys mess it up. You need to osk her something thot will engoge
her in o bock-ond-forth conversotion, noi spew your opinions obout life.

At firsl, o womon won'l be interested in you or your opinions. lnsteod,
she'll be inlerested in tolking obout herself. This meons thol your focus

When you're interocting wiih o womon ond osking questions you ore
not ollowed to osk "Do you come here often?" You ore olso prohibited
from osking obout the weolher. Those two questions ore so clichgd thot
you will come ocross os o totol boneheod. The lost thing you ore for-
bidden from osking is'nVhofs your sign?" These oll sound too much like
lines ond come ocross os boring ond stupid. The good news is thot there
ore countless good, simple questions. Once you get your curiosity cir-
cuitry going, you won'l hove o problem osking them.

You might find yourself wondering, "Gee, ore lhose breost implonts?
How do they stond up so well?" Thofs obviously not o question you're
going to wont to osk. We probobly don'l hove to tell you this, but we
wonled to double- ond quodruple-check.
We're not suggesting thot you ovoid thinking obout sex or ovoid won-

l0[f tFfl sfi lte lv*':tstt" &is&. {}{iri*$sg e}l{l $clr.gx$p*s${*n
things we qll wonder obout when we tolk to women. Don't even tqy to
suppress fiose thoughls. We're iust soying thot none of those questions
will fly. Just remember thot you risk foce slops, explosive forms of vio-
lence, sexless nights ond trouble if you moke overtly sexuol comments.

It helps trc soy something like 'Wov/' or "Reolly'' or 'Thofs interesting"
before osking o bllow-up question. When you use those phroses, trcke o
breoth between questions ond listen to her response/ so q womqn won't
hel os if you're grilling her. Put owoy the interrogotion-room spotlight ond
moke sure you woid.bombording her with ropid-fire questions. Some
men will keep osking o womon '1/Vhy? Why? Why?" or borroge her with
questions until she flips out. Tho/s onother woy trc hove her feel like she's
locked in on inlerrogoiion room with you. lf you osk one question ot o time
ond go ol o slow, reloxed poce, lhe conversotion will foel nofurol ond eosy
trc susficin.
When some guys ore excited they feel pumped up. While being ener-
gized is o good thing, sometimes guys in this stote tend to osk too mony
questions too quickly ond nol ollow women enough time to respond. Just
remember to slow down, give her time to respond, odd o few oppre-
ciotive comments ond you'll be fine.

Remember, ifs not your foult she wos unfriendly, ond you did nothing
wrong by opprooching her. When o womon is unfriendly, the best thing
to do is lo move on to the next one. lfls pointless to woste your time ond

SITUATION: You're ot o concert, listening to the music ond stonding

recommend you stort employing when tolking lo women:
First, breothe deep into your body. Mony men breofi shollowly, ond
high in their chests-this reolly doesn't leove you feeling powerful-for
lhot, you need to breothe more deeply. We coll this "breofiing into your

thot feeling going oll the woy down to the core of your body, oll the woy
down into your bolls. lt moy sound silly, but ifs been our observotion thot
it mokes o big difference.
Second, osk yourself whot you could be curious obout with this womon.
Third, listen lo the response you gel.
Here's o choin of curiosity questions thot you could use ot the concerl:
"So, whot do you think of the bond?" When she onswers, "They're
greol," run through the sequence ogoin:
o Breqthe into your bolls.
o Ask yourself whot you could be curious obout in her response.
o Listen to lhe onswer.

We strongly recommend you proctice being curious wifi both men ond
women. A gome thoi we like to ploy (though we don't tell other people
\ /e ore ploying it!) is seeing how long we con go in o conversotion with-
oul reveoling onything obout ourselves. ln the gome, you're only
ollowed to osk questions of onother person.
We were recently listening to o speech given by morketing guru Joy
Abroms. He wos tolking obout the power of questions ond the power of
listening. Abroms told o slory obout o time he wos troveling cross-coun-
try ond met o guy on on oirplone. Abroms storting osking the guy ques-
tions obout himself. They tolked for hours-neorly the whole trip. At the
end of the conversotion, the mon lurned to Abroms ond soid, 'You ore
the most interesting guy l've ever mel." Abroms commenled fiot the
ironic port wos thot he (Abroms) did not soy onything obout himself; he
iust kept osking questions.
We mention this story lo show how people will bond with you ond feel
comfortoble with you when you give them the gift of osking questions.
When you provide women on opportunity trc tolk ond express themselves,
they will not only feel bonded to you but they will olso feel oppreciotive
lhot someone listrened to them. They moy not consciously reolize thot you
only listened lo them ond only osked questions without shoring much
obout yourself. Still, os in Abroms's story they will be conscious of feel-
ing closer to you.

You've leorned obout the importonce of interrupting ond initioting inter-
octions wifi women. Here's o simple woy to stort putting thot knowledge
into oction, storting todoy.
Lel's tolk specificolly obout how you interrupt women ond redirect their
otlention toword you. Mony men think thot whot they reolly need is o
greot opening line. Guys often osk us, 'Whot ore the opening lines thot
women like?"
Here ore some opening lines we know women don't like, jusi for your
omusemenl:
"Hey boby, let's do breokfost tomorrow-sholl I coll you or nudge
you?"
"Hi, my nome is Dovid. Remember il, becouse you'll be screoming
it loter tonight!"
"Hey boby, ore you weoring your spoce underweor tonight?
Becouse your oss is out of this world!"
"Hey se4y, how would you like to ioin me in doing some moth?
Le/s odd you ond me, subhoct our clothes, divide your legs ond
then muhiply!"

"Excuse me, do you hove o quorter thot I con borrow? I told my
mother thot I would coll her when I found the girl of my dreoms."
"Congrotulolionsl You've been voted most beoutiful girl in this
room. The grond prize is o night with me!"
"Hey boby, is your dod o boker? Couse you sure hove greol bunsl"
We ore getting nouseoled.
Lefs be obsolutely crystol cleor: we ore nol suggesting you use these
lines. We include them to drow your ottention to the bosic problem with
opening lines: no motter how cute, sexy or obnoxious your opening line
is, ofter you've used it, you ore still foce to foce with o womon. When
you use some opening line, she either loughs, snorts or throws o drink
in your foce. Then you still hqve to come up with something to soy next.
lf onything, cutresy opening lines moke it horder to connecl with o
womon, becouse so often they ore stupid lines thol piss women off.
The University of Chicogo did o study of opening lines (your tox dollors
ot work!) ond found thot "Hi" is the mosl effective opening line with o
womon. "Hi" is followed in effectiveness by "Do you like the bond?" (But
only if there's o bond ploying-try to keep thot in mind.)
The bottom line is ihere is no opening line thot con keep you from hov-
ing lo generote o conversotion with o womon, so you might os well use
hi-ot leost it won'i piss her off. Of course, you'll still hove the problem
of needing to generote o conversotion with her, but we'll get to thot.
First, lefs tolk obout thot best of oll opening lines, the word "hi."

Getting into the hqblt of soying hi to women is on importont first step in
hoving longer conversotions with women, conversolions thot leod to
seduction ond sex. Therefore, leorning to soy hi is your first tosk in inter-
rupting ond initioting with women.
This is obvious but importont fo note: soying hi to o womon estoblishes
o precedent of communicotion thot con work to your odvontoge. After
you soy hi to o womon, il's noturolto continue tolking with her-but it'd
be weird to tolk if you hodn't soid hi. Therefore, soying hi is your first
step toword seduction ond sex.
For inslonce, hove you ever been in o sifuotion where, if you'd only soid
hi to o womon right owoy, it would hove been oppropriote to tolk to her
loier on? Perhops it hoppened while you were woiting in line. You got in
line ond you noticed o very pretty girl in front of you, but you didn't soy
hi to her when you first sow her os you got into the line. You were in
your own world or you were trco ofroid to soy hi or you didn't wont to
interrupt her or you used whotever your stondord excuse is for not inler-
rupting ond initioting with women. You stood in line next to this beouti-
ful womon for o little while ond you reolized thot you wonted to tolk to
her-perhops you even thought of something the two of you could con-
verse obout-but by then you couldn't, becouse it would hove seemed
weird to stort iolking to her ofbr ignoring her for so long. lf only you
hod soid hi when you first got into line you would hove hod some prece-
dent of ocknowledging eoch other's existence, ond it would hove been
much eosier to trolk more loler.

You've probobly hod thot kind of thing hoppen. We hove, too. Such sod,
lost opportunities ore the result of not setting o precedent of being o guy
who tolks to women. They're the result of not soying hi.
lf you ore going to leorn to tolk to women ond implement whot you leorn
qnd become good ot it, you hove to be oble to toke scory octions ond
boil them down into steps thot ore so smoll thot they ore noi scory ony
more or ore iust scolf enough thot you con still do them. The Hi Progrom
is o greot woy to do thot.
The Hi Progrom is reolly simple: you decide how mony womon you ore
going to soy hi to eoch doy ond you do it. Suppose you decide to soy
hi to I0 women o doy. Loter on, while you're wolking down the streel,
you see I0 women ond you soy hi to them. You go to the moll, you see
10 women, you soy hi to them.
When you follow the Hi Progrom, you become the kind of guy who iust
noturolly finds himself soying hi io women, so when you're in thot line
you hove olreody sqid hi to thot cute girl in front of you ond you con
eosily move on lo some other conversotionol sequence.

ond write it on o piece of poper or on index cord. Corry thot cord with
you ond keep trock of how mony women you octuolly soy hi to os you
go firough your doy.
This moy seem silly, but it's importont. lf you don't hove on ideo of how
mqny women you soid hi to, il,s very eosy to get stopped ond stoy
stopped. lf you keep trock, you con look ot your index cord ond soy,
'Wow, I soid I would soy hi to l0 women o doy ond I soid hi tro zero
women yesterdoy ond two todoy." Then you con look through this section
ogoin, figure out whot your problem is ond correct it. lf you don,t keep
trock, i/ll be eosier to delude yourself, overlook hends ond blow the power
of the entire progrom.
On the olher hond, keeping trock olso helps you feel good obout whot
you've occomplished. Especiolly if you've been o shy guy, looking ot
your cord ond seeing you soid hi to 32 women todoy con feel pretty
good. lt's worfh doing.
2. fn" women you sqy hi to don,t hove to heor you soy
hi. At this point, the importont thing is thot you open your mouth ond
soy hi. Whofs not importont ot this luncture is whether women heor you.
So open your mouth ond soy hi whether you think she con heor you or
not. The women you soy hi to con be wolking in the other direction or
even weoring heodphones. lt doesn't mqfier. Just soy hi.
A lot of guys soy, 'Vell, oll the women I sow this week-oll of them, I00
percent-were weoring heodphones qnd were Rollerbloding the ofier
woy or for some olher reoson wouldn't hove heord me, so I didn,t soy

hi." Well, thofls gorboge. These guys didn't soy hi becouse they were
scored, ond they used o womon's inobility trc heor them os on excuse for
not following the progrom. Open your mouth ond soy hi. lt doesn't mot-
ter if she heors you or not.
3. Soy hi to ony womqn you see. Tho/s right, ony womon. She
con be old, fot, disobled-it doesn't motter. Remember, this is obout
building your initiotion muscle so you con interrupl women ond redirect
their ottention, no motter how briefly, toword you. At this point, it cqn be
with ony womon ot oll; it doesn'l motier.
{- C"l.btote thqt you did it. Often we tolk with o guy who would
only let himself feel good obout himself if he monoged to convince o
trciclly unottoinoble, uninterested supermodel whom he met on the sfeet
to sleep with him in 15 minutes or less. Then ond only then would he
ollow himself to hel good obout whot he occomplished with women.
We,ve soid it before ond we'll soy it ogoin: thot kind of ottitude is o mis-
tqke. lf you ore leorning to tolk to ond seduce women, you must ollow
yourself to feel good ond to celebrqte eoch step in the process of getting
loid. Beoting yoursell up ond feeling bqd will not help becouse o guy
who is reolly down on himself is inherently unollroclive to women. So
reword yourself; proise yourself for soying hi. h will help stort you on
your woy to becoming o moster ot tolking to women.
lf you try lo proctice the Hi Progrom but put down your effort ond suc-
cess iust becouse you oren't getting loid yet, you will only impede your
own process. Let yourself feel good obout toking oction. Tell yourself
m$ ilipf,s0nffi s l,ibalits
things like 'Vow, I soid hi to l0 women! I om the mon!" Find something
lo celebrote obout the progress you ore moking in interrupting ond ini-
tioting wilh women. You might wonl to keep o iournol obout it, perhops
writing, "l om the mon becouse I soid hi to 25 women todoy. I con see
fhot I reolly om breoking out of my shell, ond tho/s greof." Or you con
get your body involved: moke some little motion, like shoking your fist
powerfully while soying, 'Yes! I soid hil"
We're omozed by the extenl to which the men we work with resist feel-
ing good obout the smoll steps ond smoll octions they toke wilh women,
bul il's importont thot you do so. Most men hove o hord time celebrot-
ing ony occomplishment thot isn't on ordeol. Thot won't work with
women. Women like to be oround men who feel good obout themselves,
so it mokes sense to reword yourself ond feel good obout toking this first
slep in tolking to women: soying hi to them.
You musl do this. So mony of our students will soy things like 'lVell, I
wos wolking down the street ond I soid hi to 20 women in five minutes
ond it wos eos, so therefore it doesn't count." Or they soy, 'Yeoh, I soid
hi to t 0 women, but they were oll old or ugly, so it doesn't count." They
discredit their work before they even see the positive effucts of it.
Mony men who hove o hord time trrlking lo women ore often cought in
this trop: i/s either got trc be troo hord, ond thus they con't do it, or i/s too
eosy, so it doesn't count. h/s os if they hoven't sufbred enough to ollow
themselves to foel good obout whot they did. Don't moke this mistoke.
E. Pructicc out loud. Some men ore stopped by the ideo of soying
hi to women they don't know. They stort to soy hi ond they choke up.

Our experience hos shown us thot men ore very inventive in screwing
up the Hi Progrom. Here ore fie mosl populor trops guys foll into. Leorn
these ond ovoid them ond you will be fine.
l. Oisquolifyirg oll women. You con screw up the Hi Progrom by
disquolifying every womon os o condidote for o hi. Usuolly it works like
this: o guy refuses to soy hi lo most women becouse they ore not hot
enough. He then refuses to soy hi to lhe resl becouse they ore so hot thot
he's intimidoted. The solution is lo remember this: your iob is to soy hi
to something femole qnd humqn. Thofs oll.
2. Woiting for the "perlecl momenl." The truth is there's never
o perfect moment ic soy hi. You iust hove trc do it. lf you con't iust soy hi,
you're going to hove o reolly hord time generoting conversotions with

women. Woiting oround br the perfect moment fic soy hi guorontees thol
you'll never soy hi becouse the perfect momenl never comes. you hqve lo
moke thot moment hoppen by interrupting her flow ond creoting it.
Mosl conloclwith women is not going to hoppen unless you moke it hop-
pen. You need your interruption muscle to be strong so you con creote
thot contoct. This is criticol. Remember, you olone ore responsible for
interrupting women ond initioting contoct wifh them. you hove to do it.
f. O,tty soying hi ro women who mqke eye contocr with

Guys soy to us, 'You guys told me to soy hi to I O women o doy ond I
thought thot would be reolly eosy, but then no womon mode eye contocr
with me, so I couldn't soy hi to ony of them."
Listen: if you ore going through life woiting for women to moke eye
contoct with you before you soy hi, you ore woiling for women lo initi-
ole with you before you will interoct with them. You ore trying to ovoid
interrupting \ /omen, qnd how well hos thot been working in your life?
Not very well. The terrible truth: you must soy hi to women even if they
oren't looking ot you. Women ore rorely going to moke eye contocl with
you before you soy hi. They ore going to ovoid contoct becouse thot is
whol women ore progrommed to do. Soy hi onywoy.
f. O.ittg upset by women's responses. you,ll get oll sorts of
responses when you soy hi. Some will be worm, some not. One of the ben-
efits of the Hi Progrom is you stort to leqrn thot her response doesn'l mot-

body movements lo emphosize the humor in their monologues. studying
these performers should give you on ideo how to integrote your body
into your own speoking style.
Moke Eye contccr. Port of developing o physicor presence is troin-
ing yourself to moke eye conroct with women. when you enter o room,
do you sweep rhe room moking brief eye confoct wirh women or do you

lf there oren't mony speed chonges or volume chonges in your speoking

most guys tolk quietly is becouse they're scored of interrupting or upset-

your bolls.

We first tolked oboui speoking from your bolls in chopter l. lt sounds
slronge, but il's very effective. We've oll hod moments when we felt

it felt like it iust come out of our core ond people iust stopped ond lis-

you'll find thot it come from your guts or oll the woy down from your
bolls. Most likely it wos os if on energy come up from thot port of your
body ond out your mouth. We're going to teoch you how to reproduce
thot experience ot will.
Men who feel intimidoted oround tolking to women cut off their life ener-
gy ond their vitolity. When you speok from your bolls you feel more con-
fident becou3e you hove your life energy supporting you. When you
hove vitolity ond confidence, tolking to women is much eosier.

The ideo of speoking from your bolls or your guls is not thot unusuol.
We know thot peok performers in sports ond other fields incorporote this
concept into their success sirotegies. They get reolly grounded in their
guls or their bolls; they feel o conneclion to thot oreo, they breothe into
it ond they get psyched up. Peok performers use this proctice to moke
themselves feel strong, confident ond powerful before they go into o
speech or importont situolion.
This is on owkword thing to discuss; the notion of coming from your bolls
is so foreign thot our only connection to tolking obout it is to ossociote it
with mqsfurbotion. We wont you to stort ossocioting speoking from your
bolls with hoving the power to help you get whot you wont wilh women,
not with something to feel emborrossed oboul or hide from.
Here's how you con use this energy. Stort by closing your eyes ond sens-
ing the energy qround your nwd ond your bolls. We're not tolking
obout ierking off here or onything like thot-sense il internolly. Sense
thot energy, sense your bolls, ond then breothe into it. Next, feel your
breoth circulote down io your guts ond bolls ond then come bock up.
The more comfortoble ond fomilior you become with thot energy, the
more confident you will feel with women. The more fomilior you ore with
thot energy, the eosier it will be to occess thot sense of colm qnd confi-
dence when you ore tolking to women. This simple proctice con be done
onytime, onywhere.
When they first stort working with us, mosl of our students tend to speok
from their heods or their throot. ltt os if they ore cut off below their
necks. They don't feel powerful ond insteod ovoid being grounded ond

in touch with their power. They ore used to ovoiding their bolls ond gurs
when they feel scqred. You con troin yourself, however, to focus on this
oreo; over time, il will greotly enhonce your self-confidence.
Breothing is on importont ospect of leorning to speok from your bolls. rt
olwoys sounds silly when someone tells you to breothe; if we weren,t
breothing, we'd be deod, obviously. But you con breothe deep down
inside of yourself ond imogine the oir going deeply-or you con breothe
shollowly. when men feet intimidoted, they usuoily breothe shollowly.

When you're in the flow of being excited, however, ifs ottroctive to

People wont lo be oround excited people. lf you're willing to occept

ple will olso be okoy with it. lf you're willing to occept those silly

Act excited obout mundone things. You con choose to be excited

house, be ofroid to tqlk lo onyone ond be ofroid to show your
interest in ony'hing, but this will only keep you further owoy lrom

Defunding, opologizing ond prctecting yourself. When tolk-
ing to women, mony men feel os if they hove to defend themselves. They
immediotely ossume thot every'hing o womon soys is o personol ottock.
These men oct os if women ore oul to get them, out to humiliole them,
ond the only fhing they con do to reroliote is be prepored for on
inevitoble ottock.
When Bob fhe bod seducer tolks to women he is conslontly on guord
ond wondering when she will ottock him. He stores ot her with on ongry
expression. When o womon osks him o personol queslion he tokes on o
defensive tone ond soys, 'tVhot do you meon by fhot?" or 'lVhy do you
think thofs your business?" Bob is so wropped up in his poronoio $ot
he is unoble to hove o conversqtion with o womon'
Toking o defensive posiiion when you're tolking lo women does not
work. When you toke on o defensive position ond ossume o womon is
ottocking you, being oggressive or trying to horm you, you seem
uncomforioble, meon ond nosty. You need to be open when you're tolk-
ing fo women. When you're focused on defending yourself or opolo-
gizing for your sexuol interesl you connot listen to o womon ond connol
hove fun with her. When you're with o womqn, look for times when
you're defending ond protecting yourself ond times when you oren't'
Whofs the difference? Whot ore the internol triggers?
l[8 lllnsr &am8 [r Telfiins [8 td0ln*n
The other side of being defensive is being protective. Whot ore you pro-
tecting yourself from when you're tolking to women? Usuolly you ore
protecting yourself from reiection or from looking like o moron, or else
you're simply tqying too hord to look good. Unfortunotely there is noth-
ing you con do but toke risks wiih women. You olwoys risk looking stu-
pid, being vulneroble ond being owkword. Approoching women is
inherently risky ond vulneroble. You hove to decide to live with it.
Another common trop is opologizing for your sexuol inleresl. Shy men
feel os though opprooching women is wrong. They think thot if they
show romontic or sexuol intreresl il in some woy hurts o womon. These
men think they ore so powerful thot they con ruin ony womon's doy
merely by commenting thot she is beoutiful or showing ony interest.
Strotegizing. There ore concrete skills you con leorn to help you suc-
ceed with women. ll/s smort to study seduction moferiols; stud this book
ond our other products ond leorn os much obout yourself, women,
romonce ond sexuolity os possible. Studying, however, is oll obout
preporotion. Once you're hoving on ocfuol conversotion with o womon/
oll the rules chonge.
Once you're in on octuol conversotion with o womqn ifs best to try to
forget obout forcing on oulcome; relox ond hove fun. To be in the pres-
ent moment you need lo give up qny strotegy thot you moy hove.
There ore o few reosons why strotegizing does nol work:
o The experience of being with women chonges from moment lo
momont, to ony rtrotegy you employ will not be opplicoble to the

ineviioble curvebolls women will throw ol you' How con you hove
o strotegy for q situotion thol hos no predictobility? You con't'
Strotegizing mokes you blind to openings' When you ore tolking
to women lhere ore subtle openings to osk for phone numbers' ini-
tiote different types of conversotions, go lor the first kiss, ond
more. When you're focused solely on your strotegy you will not
see the openings for moving things further' You need to be in on
odd Zenlike stote of being immersed in the situolion yet detoched
enough to see when to osk for her phone number' lf you ore solely
focused on o slrotegy you'll miss the openings'
Strotegizing is not fun' Why do we keep tolking obout fun? Fun
men lurn women on. When you're hoving fun you're in the flow
ond when you're miseroble ond struggling you ore not ottroctive'
When you focus on o strotegy ond work hord to seduce women'
you toke oll the fun out of ir ond moke tolking to women feel like
work. Relox ond find woys to enioy the experience'
Strotegizing mqkes you come ocross os o freok' A mon who is
focused on o sirolegy comes ocross os owkword ond uncomfort-
oble. Telemorketers ore olwoys irying to use cule lines ond stupid
questions lo engoge you ond they olwoys come ocross qs time
wosters. Sqlesmen who hove on ogendo or ore using o soles slrol-
egy come ocross os creepy. When you ore focused on o slrotegy
or using o technique you roo will come ocross os superficiol ond
creepy.

qn octuol fight he uses evefihing he's ever leorned during his troining.
He uses the blocks, the kicks, the punches ond more.
But to do thot, during the octuol fight he must give up ony strotegy ond
ony skill he's leorned ond be ovvore of the other fighter. He must be open
to responding to onything thot hoppens. lf he's focused on showing off,
strotegizing or expecling the other fighter to fight o porticulor woy he's
in for o rude owokening. The momenl he storts thinking he understonds
how fhe fight will go he'll likely get his oss kicked. The moment he storts
expecting o kick or o punch, the other fighter will do something com-
pletely different ond knock him out. With women you need to let go of
ony strotegy ond skill you've leorned ond be open lo whotever hoppens.
When you con be owore, presenl ond open, tolking to women will be
fluid ond fun.
Monipuloring. Do you wont to leorn o surefire method for feeling like
o ierk? Do you wont to find o woy to feel guilty, crummy obout yourself
ond regretful? Monipuloling women is one woy you con creole o situo-
tion where you feel like o totol ierk.
We've worked with thousonds of men, ond the number one concern lhey
hove in seducing women is thot they wont to dote ond hove sex without
being o lerk. Men tell us thot when they monipulote ond lie lo women
they feel terrible. They feel guilty ond depressed. Men tell us thot even
when monipulotion works the cost is nol worth it. The ultimole cost for
monipuloting women is your self-esteem. Fortunotely, you don'f need to
monipulote. You con build reol connections, using the tools in this book.

Looking for certsinty. lf you wont to leorn to be o powerful seduc-

ity. Tolking lo women is like iumping off o high diving boord. So whol
do you do? You con either climb bock down or decide not trc iump or
you con muster up the couroge lo go for it. lf you iump there ore o few
seconds in which you ore folling through the oir, which hels scory exhil-

Tolking to women is like iumping off o diving boord. At first there is no
woy of knowing how things will go. You don't know if she's got o
bofriend, if you're her type, if you'll offend her with o comment or if
you'll toke her home thot night ond hove sex with her. To hove o chonce
ot success, however, you need to iump ond go for it ond understond thot
you hove no clue qbout whether you'll succeed or foil. We oll get scored
when we first opprooch o womon. We oll feel nervous ond uncertoin
ond doubt our skills. You con still go for it, though. Your iob is to feel the
feor ond still do it onyrroyl
Resisting the truth. Mony of our students hove o hord time focing
the horsh reolities of doting women. Most men wonl o sonitized version
of doting women; they wont the version without the risk of poin ond
humiliotion. Guess whot? Tho/s not reol. Most women on this plonet ore
not the slightest bit interested in doting you. So whot? You're only look-
ing for the hondful of women who ore.

Lefs get honest here. Hqrsh truths thot you must foce:
Some of our students meet women who hove boyfriends ond they
will not occept the foct thot the womon is olreody token.
Some of our students keep colling o womon even ofter o few dotes
hove gone bodly. They foil to occept the foct thot the womon is not

Some of our students keep colling women even ofter o few dotes
hove gone bodly. They foil to occept thot they don,t like the

We oll meet women we find ottroctive who hove no interest in us.

l/s importont to see the truth ond occept focts. When you hold on to folse
hopes ond lie to yourself i/s hord to succeed with women. poin con be
o greoi motivotor. h/s our belief thot ifls better to be honest ond reol, ifs
befter to feel the poin of foilure ond loneliness, fhon it is to lie to your-
self. The poin con become on olly, not something to resisi. When you,re
oble to be honest it's much eqsier to come up with on qction plon ond
get bock into the gome of doting.
Forcing qn outcome. As men, one woy we succeed in life is by forc-
ing outcomes. lf you're o compufer progrommer, for instonce, through

ly leod ic sex. He thinks thot if he con solve her emotionol problems she
will wont tc dote him. Then, trc his surprise, things pon out difhrently.
lying. Some doting "experts" encouroge men to lie to women os o woy
lo gel sex. We ore wholly ogoinst lying to women ond do not in onywoy
encouroge you to lie. We wont you to cultivote the skills to creote relo-
tionships wilh women you con feel good oboul, nol regret.
Whot does lying soy obout you? Lying soys thot you ore the kind of guy
who connot gel women by being honest. You connot get women unless
you pretend you're someone else. You cqnnol get women if you ore iust
you. Lying leods to o lock of self-respect ond to regret.
Lying might work in the short term, but ultimotely ifs veqy costly. Whot if
you end up reolly liking o womon ond wont to pursue o relotionship with
her? Then she finds you out you lied to her ond she's no longer inlerest-
ed. Whot if you forget obout the lies you told ond o womon cotches you
in one of your lies? How is thot going to go over? Whot if the word gets
oround thol you're o lior?
The bottom line is thoi lying is unnecessory ond tends to couse more
problems thon i/s worth. lnsteod, we recommend you cultivote internol
integrity ond ovoid lying to women.

Beoting up on yourself. One key difference between successful
seducers ond unsuccessful seducers is thot the most successful seducers
don't beot themselves up. lnsteod, they constontly focus on the woys in
which they ore successful with women.
Doting women is o long-term proiect, qnd os with oll long-term proiects
the gool is smoll incrementol progress over time. somerimes there will be
big sleps forword; sometimes, smoll steps bockword. Along the woy
there will be upset, poin, horsh reolity, scory moments, fun ond ioy. you
need to develop on internol opprooch trc see the positive steps you toke
with women. ln the confusing, long odyssey of doting women, you need
to constontly look ot the movement ond steps you've loken ond con-
stontly compliment ond reword yourself for your own progress.
You con either look ot eoch interoction with women qnd kick yourself for
the woys you blew it or you con celebrote the foct thot you octuolly did
somefiing. Unfortunotely, beoting up on yourself hos become o woy of
life for mony of our students. They moke o proctice out of feeling guilty
for ony opportunities they didnt toke with women, errors they mode
while tolking to women ond opportunities to osk for phone numbers they
didn't toke. lnsteod, we recommend you keep irock of oll the things you

woys you've pushed yourself in new directions, if will enhonce your self-

Be quthentic. We've olreody tolking obout being self-expressed ond

You need to find your edge, the ports of yourself thot ore unique.
Women wonl o mon with possion ond energy. Look ot how you con
express yourself with women ond show your chorocfer.
Hqve fun. Fun ollrocts more fun. Depression oilrocts more depression;
feor otirocts more feor. women wont to be oround fun men. one req-
son comedions get women, even though mony comedions ore not por-
ticulorly otfroctive, is becouse they ore fun to be oround. women find
men who moke them lough or ore fun to be oround sexy ond exciting-
in o$er words, potentiol lovers. For mony women ployfulness, fun ond
sexiness ore linked. Hove fun ond moke every interoction fr-rn for both of
you.
Give up how it hos to look. When you,re deoling with women
you need to give up your ideos of how o conversotion or interoction
should look. You never know whot will hoppen. Moybe you end up tolk-
ing to o womon ot o concert ond you get her number but don't bring her
home. Moybe o womon seems reolly into you but never colls you bock.
Moybe she's only interested in you os friend ond not o lover. you will not
find this out unless you give up your preconceived notions of how ir
should look, ond find out whot reolly is there. you hove no clue whot the
relotionship will look like. And since you connot control the interoction
or her interest level, oll you con do is show up ond go with the flow.

By going with the flow we don't meon being totolly possive ond not try-
ing to move things into o more seductive reolm; you should toke risks to
moke things os seductive os possible. But if you ore too focused on get-
ting o number/emoil oddress or hoving on inleroclion look o porticulor
woy you will miss the direction she wonts things to go. You will miss the
cues she's giving you ond openings lo toke the interoclion deeper.
h's o porodox. At one pointyou need to give up ony ottochment ond ony
focus on whof things need to look like. At the other you need to try to
push things inlo more romontic spoces. Be cognizont of both of these
opprooches qnd do your best lo stoy in behveen both.
Cut off communicotion qnd ovoid people ond situotions
thot moke you uncomfortoble. Sometimes you need to cut o dote
short ond leove. A mon who hos selFrespect does nol stoy in situotions
where he feels condescended to, obligoted to poy for things thot don't
feel right or offended or otherwise mode uncomfortoble by o womon'
Once ogoin we're not tolking obout being rude or meon, bul sometimes
dotes ore not going well ond even feel reolly bod. We're giving you per-
mission to leove these situolions ond go somewhere else. You do not need
to subiect yourself to women ond situolions thot feel bod. You will likely
end up folking to ond doting women who you're not into being oround.
ln those situolions the best tqctic is to leove when there's on opportunity
trc do so.
Stoy in communicqtion wirh friends qnd buddies. One of the
best woys to increose your skills with women is to hove o buddy you con

tolk to obout how your seducfion experimenrs ore going. A buddy is
good becouse you con coll him for support bounce ideos off of him.
Hwing someone you con blk b obout women on o regulor bosis is very help-
ful in stoying motivoted, pushing yourself ond overcoming trouble. you
will olso leorn o lot obout yourself by being o buddy ro onother mon in
helping him dote women.
Focus on your gools ond keep your word to yourself obout opprooching
ond soying hi to women. You need to come up wifi o seduction plon.
This meons you hove gools, both shorr ond long-rerm. This meons you
come up with o strotegy to proctice tolking to women. perhops you com-
mit to soying hi to l0 women per doy, procticing the Romontic Moves o
few limes per week ond hoving qt leost two Deepening conversotions
(oll of which you will leorn loter in this book). Whotever your gools ore
you need to push yourself to keep your word.
unsuccessful seducers don't toke fieir promises seriously ond blow off
occomplishing their gools. successful seducers keep their word no mot-
ter whot. lf they promise to tolk to o cerroin number of women eoch doy
or week, they do it.
Moke ir inro o gqme. Tolking to women is o gome. yes, there ore
emotionol components to deoling with women; yes, ir feels like your ego
is on the line oftentimes, but ir's only o gome. lfs not reor. lt's not o mor-
ter of life ond deoth. There ore no reol consequences.

l|sffr t;{! lall{ T0 ll!,{r|ll0n
So how con you shift the focus from being serious ond heovy to hoving
fun ond enioying the gome? You con stort trocking your progress, doing
things iusr for the hell of it, checking things oul knowing i/s not thot seri-
ous ond creoting your own rules.
Dqnce in the conversolion. Hove you hod the experience where
you were folking fo someone ond time iust seemed to stqnd still ond the
next thing you knew hours hod possed? ln those moments you were in
the flow, you were doncing in the conversotion. You were open ond free
ond iusr reolly synched up with the other person. So how do you repli-
cote thd experience? There is no cleor poth to doing it every doy or ol
will. Just be open to doncing in o conversotion lodoy. The gool is to hove
fluidity in your communicolion.
Hqve self-respect. The problem with domoging your self-respect to
pursue o womon is thot it is selFreinforcing: the more your betroy your
own self-respect ond grovel to o womon, the more likely you ore to
betroy yourself ogoin the next lime. To moke motters worse, when you
violote your self-respect with o womon, it orouses her contempl for you,
ond she will treot you even worse. lf you stoy oround for thot, she'll hurt
you even more. You'll be left wondering why you-such o nice, under-
stonding guy-ore cought up with o womon who treqts you so bodly. lt
will oll be becouse you sold your self-respect for sex, which is o bod deol
ond olmost never octuolly gels you the girl.
This doesn'i meon you should be meon lo o womon, go crozy or do ony-
thing else thot would domoge your self-respect. You iust hove to decide
where the line is ond live with it intelligently.

We've noticed thot mony of our students ore frustroted becouse hey
expect women trc oct the woy men do, ond to be motivoted in the some
woy men ore. To help correct lhis, we've put trcgether this list o[ the rules
ofwomen.
These rules ore generolizotions; you will, of course, find women who ore
exceptions to oll o[ lhem. Don't worry obout it' The boftom line is' your
interoctions with women will go more eosily if you oct os though these
rules ore lrue.
Women qre nol ecrewed'uP men' Women ore not iust screwed-
up or illogicol men. They ore women' lf you relote to women os if they
were iust screwed-up men, you'll olwoys be trying to moke women oct
the woy you wish they would oct-thot is, the woy you would oct'
Women hcrve o different inregrity fiom men' While men ore
more likely to hove integrity to their word, women ore more likely to
hove integrity to their feelings. This meqns thqt i[ o womon's feelings tell
her to do something thot is controry to whot she soid she'd do, such os
showing up for o dole, she's likely to do whot her feelings tell her to

rother thon to follow her commitment. Another woy ro soy this is to soy
thql women ore, on the whole, more committed to doing whot their emo-
tions fell them fion they ore to keeping their word. Don'r ler rhis drive
you crozy. h/s not bod, iust different from the woy you qre.
Women wont to be free to chonge lheir minds. Women wont
to be oble to chonge their minds os much os they wont whenever they
wont for whotever reoson ihey wont or for no reoson ot oll. This moy
seem crozy or illogicol toyou, but remember-she's following her feel-
ings, not her verbol commitments.
Women use hints snd innuendoes to tell you whot they
wonl. When you interoct with women, don,l expect them to be direct
with you obout whot they wont. Once ogoin, fiis isn,t being screwed-
up, it's lust o difference in the woys men ond women do things. This
meqns thot when you osk women whot they wont you should provide o
menu of options rother thon expecting them to generote ideos.
Women wonl life fo be on unending dote. Women wont
things fo be romontic. ln some woys they prefer on emotionol roller-
coosler to o smooth ride. Another woy to soy this is to soy thoi women
hove o wide emotionol ronge ond wont lo express ii fully.
Women cqn be surprisingly meon. Mony men who,ve gone
through o divorce hove found out how surprisingly meon women con
be. ln some woys this is becouse women ore more invested in the con-
cept of foirness thon men ore. while you don't expect life to be foir ond
don't think obout it much, the women in your life very well mighr. So if

To moke molers worse/ os you leorn how to lolk to women, you ore like-

it ond how tc keep moving forword, even in the foce of foor of reiecrion,
is criticol.
Becouse seduction is o numbers gome/ you'll wont to move firough o lot

been oble to lough in the foce of reiecrion (ot leost some of the time),

the time). You must be oble to do this, too.
we moke o lot of oppeoronces on rodio ond TV coll-in shows qnd we
receive emoil from o loi of men. The number one question we ger is
"How do I hondle reiecfion?" Here,s how you con do it the woy thot top

Le/s compore how men who consistently foilwith women hondle reiec-
tion with how relection is hondled by men who succeed wifi women.
There's o fundomentol difference.

ll$ur tr8 tffl& &w8nl8ll
First, let's toke o look ot how guys who foil with women hondle reiection
ond the feor of reiection. When Bob the bod seducer is reiected by o
womon, the first thing he does is moke thot womon into his "one-ond-
only hope" of ever hoving sex ogoin. He does this by ideolizing her:
"She wos so prefi ond I never get to meet women like her. She hod the
whole pockoge-greot body, owesome tils, broins, o successful coreer.
She reolly could hove been 'the one'!"
The second thing Bob does is decide thot her reiection of him is his fqult.
He'll tell himself, "She reiected me becouse l'm so ugly ond l'm stupid.
Whol mokes me think l'd be ottroctive lo o womon like her, onywoy? l'm
nol otlroctive. All I om is o piece of shit. I know thot. Plus, whot I soid to
her wos incredibly stupid. I reolly hondled it wrong. I reolly freqked her
out. I should iust crowl bock into my hole ond die. l'll never succeed with
women. Why do I olwoys hove such bod luck with women? I suck."
But woit-there's morel After evisceroting himself in step two, Bob, ond
unsuccessful seducers like him, tokes onolher key step loword using this
reiection to keep himself from ever toking o risk with o womon ogoin:
he wollows in the poin of it. Thot's right, ofter moking the womon inio
"the perfect womon" ond moking the reiection completely his own foult
ond coming up with on explonotion for the reiection thot is os poinful os
he con devise, brilliont Bob dwells in thol poin.
He reploys the experience of being reiected over ond over, giving him-
self o new dose of emotionol poin every time he relives it. He imogines
the look on her foce when she reiected him ond thinks how upset she
musl hove been. He tells himself thot she no doubt convened o meeting
uruuMbomrdfllllll- -
f
ilnt|dtinc freic$bisr and lrnis rrswd t{ffnsn
of oll of her friends iust ro tqlk obout the houmo thot Bob put her
through. He imogines thot his reputorion, such os it wos, is ruined. He
tells himself fhor now "everyone will knov/' he wos rrying to be o seduc-
er-ond it's oll becouse he bungled things so bodly.
And then Bob wonders why it tokes him four months to get up rhe nerve
to opprooch onother womon, ond why torking ro women is so incredi-
bly hord.
sure, this is on exrreme exomple. But the weird thing is thot ifs not oll
thqt unusuol. We've known mony men who do this-ond worse!-ro
themselves on o regulor bosis. Heck, we even used to be such guys. lf
eifher of us osked o womon our ond she soid no, or if either of us tried
to kiss o womon ond she soid, ,,Oh, I only like you os o friend,,, we,d
go inio the whole "l suck, she wos so prefl;y', routine. We,d moke her our
one-ond-only hope, then soy, "rf only r were more onroctive or luckier or
smorter or riche/' or whorever... Then we'd dwell in the poin for doys
ond use lhot "foilure" ro moke ir even horder to opprooch women ogoin.
Just the other doy we irrlked to o guy who hod this problem. He told us
obout how he went bollroom-doncing o month ogo ond o womon there
reiectred him. This wos o month ogo ond he wos stirr recreoring the poin
of il, over ond over, on o doily bosis. He con,t even opprooch other
women becouse he's too busy reliving the poin of thot one reiection.
You've probobly done this too.
People noturolly think thot they need ro know they con survive whorever
life might throw ot them. so in order to be sofe, when o womon reiects
o mon, poil of him wonts to moke thot relection os bod os possible so
uuu,lrulnumnfiff%.

l|Etlt &0 tra|l* m !lt0m*n
thot he knows he con survive il no motter how bod it gets. People coto-
strophize reiection ond moke it much worse thon it is to see if they con
moke iilhrough. You ore probobly doing the some thing when you tqy
to moke sure you con survive the worsl possible explonotion obout why
o womon moy hove reiected you.
Cotostrophizing probobly comes noturolly to humon beings. Think obout
it. Which of our oncestors were more likely to survive-the ones who
never worried obout ony'hing or the ones who worried constontly obout
things thot could go wrong ond who mode sure they were reody for ony
bod thing thoi might come olong? Obviously, the oncestors who worried
obout possible future problems hod on edge on those who never wor-
ried.
The some principle does not hold true when it comes to reiection. Those
who put themselves through the poin of reiection over ond over don'l
hove on edge on fie men who don't think obout reiection. li's unneces-
sory ond it doesn't help the slightest bit in getting you whot you wont
wifi women. ht like Mork Twoin soid: "l've suffered mony horrible mis-
fortunes, mosl of which never hoppened'" You don't need lo hove o life
of horrible misfortunes thot never hoppened. Jusl becquse you con moke
something bod emotionolly doesn'f meet lhot you should. You ore not
obligofed to do so iust to prove thot you con survive it. Knowing this will
help o lot in the oreo of reiection.
One of the moin reosons thot tolking to women is so difficult for most
men is thot $ey've creoted so much emolionol poin -thonks to their woy
of hondling reiection-thot when they think obout risking with women
[|{|!l|iill$ na,isssis|| a||s psllis $rslrgd lfi$tn$|N
they con only feel oll thot poin. once you'reoble to reverse thot process
ond hove experiences of being reiected thor oren'r upsetting, it will be
much eosier to iniliote more with women-ond to hove more success.
Now lel's look of reiection firough the eyes of q successful seducer.
When q successful seducer like Bruce encounrers reiection, he olso fol-
lows o three-step process, olbeit o different one from Bob's. when Bruce
encounlers reiection, the first thing he does is remind himself thot doting
is o numbers gome ond thot in no wqy is this womon his one-ond-only
hope. sfotisticolly, whotever you do with o womon is probobry going to
foil onywoy becouse thot's iust life. He soys this to himself: "Greqr. Thofs
one more no I don't hove lo heor on my woy lo on inevitoble yes.,,
second, Bruce comes up with on explonorion of her reiection thot does
not moke it his fouh. specificolly, he creores on explonotion for the reiec-
tion thot is becouse of he4 not becouse of him. He moy soy to himself,
"She must be o lesbion" or "She must be ill,, or ,,Moybe her dog iust
died." lt doesn't motter whor it is os long os ir,s somerhing thot his broin
con lotch on to thot isn't cotostrophic ond thot doesn,t involve him.
Lefs spend q few moments tolking obour this strep becouse it is so impor-
tont ond so hord for o lot of fie men we work with. Just becouse on
explonotion is horribly negotive ond poinful doesn't meon you ore
required by low to believe ir. The truth is you hove no clue why she reiect-
ed you. Moybe she wqs in o hurry. Moybe her cot died. Moybe she does-
n't speok English. You don't know, ond it doesn'f serve you to believe the
worsi possible explonotion. Moke up something positive! lt reolly is iust
os likely to be true or 3ome horrible explonotion tho/s oll obout you.

Guys so often think thot they ore oll-knowing ond omnipotent. But the
truth is you ore not the center of o womon's universe; she is the center of
her universe. The reosons why she does things ore more likely to be
obout her thon obout you. Bul it's incredibly common for o guy ttc think
thot o womon's world is obout him. He'll tell himself, "l know why she
didn't soy hi bock. She could tell thot l'm o bod guy, thot I iust wont to
get in her ponts ond l'm only interesled in sex." Meonwhile, the guy isn't
importont enough to the womon for her to spend her processing cycles
on oll these detoils obout him. She's iust trying to moke it through the
doy, she hos incredible cromps, her feet hurt, she's mod ot her boss or
wholever.
Believe it or not, the womon who reiected you does hove o life outside
of you. And thot life is much more likely to be the reoson thot she reiecF
ed you thon is her obility ond inclinotion to see into your soul ond divine
whot o scummy guy you ore. She's iust not thot interested in you. She
hos problems of her own.
DAVID: l'm thinking obout o time o few yeors ogo when I thought I wos
reiected by o womon. I soid hi to her ond mode some olher remork
ond she iust trotolly blew me off. She ignored me complebly ond
wolked owoy. I wos left thinking thot I must hove done something
wrong. I felt like o trchl wodhless bum. I mentioned fiis incident to o
friend of hers who osked me, 'lVere you on her left?" I soid yes, I
wos. He soid, 'Vell, she's very hord of heoring in generol ond con't
heor in her left eor ot oll. I olwoys moke sure to be on her right
when l'm tolking to her." lt turned out she hqdn't heord me! The
"reiection" hod nothing to do with me ot oll. I thought, '!Vhy didn't I
come up with thot explonotion?"

You musl not moke this mistoke. you must come up with on explonotion
for the reiection fhot is not obout you. Let's soy thor ogoin: you must
come up with on explonotion fhot is not obout you. Moke it her prob-
lem. Moke it o problem with the environment. rt doesn,t motter- just
moke it o problem thot hos nothing to do with you.
lmogine you soid hi to the womon ot the grocery srore. she didn,r soy
hi bock. Whot ore some explonotions thot hove nothing to do with you?
"She iust got stobbed wifh o pencil in her leg.,, ,,She,s suffering from
omnesio." "She iusl got out of the hospitol.,, ,,She,s been here since 5
o.m. ond is exhousted." ,,She,s hoving her period.,, lt doesn,f motier.
come up with some explonotion. one thot works reolly well is "oh, r
guess she's just reolly in her own world." Usuolly i/s true. Usuolly women
ore iust cought up in their own world-ofrer oll, everyone is.
Now b the third ond finol step. Afler Bruce reminds himself thot doting
is o numbers gome ond fiol she wosn'r his one-ond-only hope ond ofter
he comes up with on explonotion for her behovior thot hos nothing to
do with him, he redirects his focus toword something empowering.
once ogoin, you ore not required by low to dweil in your suffering ond
experience the poin of reiection over ond over ogoin iusr becouse you
con. smort seducers think obout something else-onything else. pick up
q newspoper; listen to the rodio, go wotch W, go on o wolk, go flirt with
qnother womon-do something, but do it insrontoneousry, ond ret your-
self get into doing it. The longer you woir, rhe more likely it is you will
dwell in your poin. You've gof to keep moving.

One greol ottention-redirecting question is 'lVhot do I wont to do right
now?" Often this question will help refocus the energy of the reiection
into some octivity thqt is useful to you. One mon we know wos fli*ing
online with o womon whom he hod previously hod sex with ond whom
he wos hoping to get into bed with ogoin. At one point in their lnstont
Messoge conversotion, she storted telling him obout this new guy she
hod met ond obout how he hod come over for o night of hot sex the
evening before.
Noturolly, he felt reiected. So first he reminded himself thot doting is o
numbers gome ond thot this womon wos not his one-qnd-only hope.
Second, he mode the reiection her problem by exploining to himself thot
she wos o very unsloble olcoholic (which wos true| ond wos probobly
drunk right then. Third, he redirected his ottention by osking himself,
'lVhot do lwont to do right now?"
He reolized thot he wonted lo stop tolking to this womon ond onswer
some personols ods. So tho/s whot he did. He wos oble to use the ener-
gy of the reiection to odvonce his whole seduction system, ond it
worked. He stopped thinking obout the reiection ond got into thinking
obout new opportunities with women.
The importont thing is thot you redirect your ottention to something spe-
cific. l/s not enough to tell yourself, "Don'l think qbout lhe reieclion"
wifiout putting some other octivity into its ploce. You need to think obout
something specific or you'll iust end up thinking obout the reieclion you
oren't supposed to be thinking obout. Find something else to focus on.

You probobly know o guy who does oil this outomoticoily. He seems
impervious to reiection. When you're ot o bor with him, you notice thot
nothing stops him. After he,s reiected by o womon, he,ll soy trc you, ,,Oh
well, she threw o drink in my foce-r guess [m on to the next one. Ho
hol" You've probobly wondered how he did it. weil, this is how. He
remembers ir's o numbers gome ond thoilhd rejecfion wos iust one more
no he didn't hove trc heor ogoin on his woy to the inevitoble yes. He
mokes the reiection her problem ond then redirects his oilenrion by mov-
ing on to fhe nextwomon (or onything else). Thus he evenruolly succeeds.
Remember thot you hove to do oll three steps; you con't just do the one
you like the best. Lefs go over rhese three sreps one more rime ond then
give you some more exomples:
' 
Remind yourself thor doting is o numbers gome ond thor this
womon wqs not your one-ond-only hope for sex. Remember thot
this is one more no on the woy to the inevitoble yes.
o creote on explonotion for the rejection thot hos nothing to do with
you. Moke it o problem with her or o problem wirh the environ-
menl but not o problem with you.
o Redirect your ottention. Find something else ro think obout or do.
Ask yourself, 'lVhot do I wont to do right now?,, to give yourself
ideos for things you con use the energy from the reiection to do.

The best woy to become expert ot hondring reiection is to procrice the
reiection process. lf you ore doing the Hi progrom (you ore doing the Hi
Progrom, oren't you?), it will give you o loborotory in which to experi_
ment with the reiecfion process. When women don,t soy hi bock or when
they scowl or give you ony orher response thot you consider o reiection,
proctice the releciion process. Firsf, remind yourself thot ifs o numbers
gome ond thot this is one more no you don't hove to heqr ogoin on your
woy to the eventuol yes. second, come up with on expronotion for the
reiection thot hos to do with her, nor you. And third, redirect your oren-
tion, perhops by osking yourself, ,Whot do I wont to do righr now?,,
Here ore some tips for leorning the process:
wrire il down. rt reolly herps if you write down the reiection process
os you do it. The reoson i/s imporicnilo write it down is thor doing it in
your heod is deceptive, especiolly ot first. lt/s eosy fo do o sloppy ond
incomplete iob if you ore iust thinking your woy through fhe three-srrep
process. You will think you hove done the process, but you octuoily wiil
not hove-you will hove thought obout doing it, which your mind wiil
misinterpret os hoving octuolly gone through the process for reor. Writing
down the reiection process gets it out of the reolm of the obstrod ond inro
the reolm of the reol.
You moy wont to corry oround o pen ond some poper so thot you con
grob o minute or lwo ond write down the process os you go through

doy ond then spend five minutes in the evening writing down ond clor-
ifying whot they did in their heods eorlier. Some men set oside o couple
of minutes twice o doy to write down fieir processes.
After you've written it down o number of times, you won't need to wrile
it down so much onymore, olthough we still write it down on occosions
when reiections seem to get to us more thon they ought to.

hove to woit to experience reiection lo use this process. You con olso use
it when you ore thinking obout opprooching o womqn ond you feel the
feor of rejection trying to slop you. Tell yourself, "lf this doesn't go the
woy I wont il to, I simply hove lo remember thot doting is o numbers
gome ond thot this will be one more no on the woy to my eventuol yes.
So even if she soys no lo me, this interoction will get me closer lo my
gool. Also, if she reiects me, it will probobly be becouse she is in her
own world or hos o heodoche todoy or something like thot. lf she does-
n'i work out, l'll go tolk to thot other womon over there. Piece of coke,
l'm reody to go!" This will prime your broin qnd put the interoction in
perspective. So whot if it doesn't work? Eventuolly one {ond more) will.
Do ir doily. As with ony skill, it is much eosier to mosler hondling
reieclion if you proclice the three-step process on o doily bosis. lf you
soy hi to o womon ond she ignores you, do the three-step process. lf you
fli* with o \ /omon ond il doesn't go well, do the three-step process. lf
you osk o womon out for coffee ond she soys no, do the three-step
process. lf you go for the first kiss qnd she soys she iust wonls to be
l|englin$ *$*s$i0n e|},1mn* nN'0tll}d yd8r$ll
friends, do the fhree-step process. You need to proctice ond hove it be
so ingroined in your mind thot you iust do it ony rime you need ro. This
will keep you going ond keep you from getting stuck, ond thot is olt thor
motlers.
Do ir unfil you get nesults. oftentimes if you use the reiection
process thoroughly you will feel completely better. sometimes you'll feel
90 percent better or even only 50 percent better. Thor's oll okoy-i/s
moving in the right direciion, ond thots whqfs importont.
Whot is not occeptoble is doing the reiection process ond feeling zero
percent, one percent or lwo percent betier. you oren't done with the
process until you feel substontiolly better ond hove some energy to move
on to something else. lf you find you don't feel better, go through the
process ogoin. Remind yourself thot doting is o numbers gome; reolly
feel how you've iust heord one more no thor you'll never need to heor
ogoin. come up with new, more compelling reosons thot moke the reiec-
tion her problem, not yours. Find something thot you reolly wqnt to do
ond thot engoges your focus. And keep doing this until you feel some
emotionol movement. Until thot hoppens, you reolly oren't finished with
the reiection process.

The only circumstonce under which you will not need ro moster the reiec-
lion process is if you ore nor getting reiected-ond if you ore nor geiling
reiected you ore not doing enough interruptions ond initiorions wirh
women ond you orc much less likely to succeed with them.

Thot's so imporlont we'll soy it ogoin: getting reiected is o good sign
becouse it meons thot you ore toking oction with women, toking risks
ond doing whot you hove to to creole obundont relotionships with
women in your life. Remember our student who soid hi to more thon 300
women in o week in his ultimotely successful quest to get sex ond o girl-
friend? He soys, "l mode use of the rejection tools on o doily bosis. lt

You need to leorn how to hondle the inevitoble onxiety ond feor thot
comes up when you opprooch ond tolk lo women. Experiencing feor in
these situotions is very common, so we're going to teoch you some bosic
skills to overcome ponic ond onxiety.
Mony of us mistokenly think there ore men out $ere who ore seduclion
mosters who never experience ony feor ond con go up to ony womon
ot ony time ond seduce them. The truth is thot we oll get scored ond feor-
ful when opprooching women. We often get scored when opprooching
women for the first time, qnd so do oll of our studenls. The point is to
leorn how to hondle onxiety ond ponic ond opprooch women even
when you feel nervous.
Mony top othletes experience feor ond nervousness before going into o
big gome, but they've leorned lo use feor to their odvontoge. They've
leorned to use the feor os o molivolor, os somelhing thot helps tham gci

in the flow, rother thon something thot rokes them out of the gome.
we've heord rumors thot hockey god Gordie Howe would puke in the
locker room before every gome. He would be overcome with onxiety,
but he leorned how to feel the feor ond go for it onyvoy. our hope is
thot you loo con leorn how ro honsform your feor ond use it to your
odvontoge.
Lefs get reol: if there's one thing thor generotrss ponic, i/s going up to
women ond tolking to fiem. one of fie hordesf things to do is to initi-
ote inleroction with o womon in o ploce like o bor or the street when you
don'l hove ony excuse to tolk to her.
Feor hits eoch mon differently. Feor occurs on o spectrum, from ontici-
potoqy feor like butterflies in your stomoch ond slight nervousness to oll-
out ponic ond totol terror. We've worked with men on oll points of the
spectrum. The tools in this section ore for men who hove mib or smoll
omounts of ponic. lf you suffer from oll-out ponic ottocks with women,
you need to look deeper, perhops fo onti-onxiety medicotion or theropy.
We ore not theropists or doctors, ond hondling ponic is not our oreo of
expertise' We con tell you thot if you hove ponic ottocks there is help.
we've hod mony students overcome extreme onxiety with women by
combining theropy, medicotion ond our moteriols.
Here ore o few tools for you to leorn ond proctice. The more you con
proctice them when you'reolone in q womon-free environment, the eos-
ier it will be to use them when you,re obout to opprooch o womon.
Breothing. Men ore often tense oround women ond forgeilo breofie,
or whon they do breothe they toke shollow breoths. proctice breothing

llslr ur! lsill te |ry|l|$s{t
deeply. Deep breothing is the fundomentol skill in overcoming ponic
becouse when o person gets tense the first fiing thot chonges is his
breothing. lt becomes shollow ond increoses in speed, ond oll of o sud-
den his body shifts into fight-or-flight mode. When you breothe ropidly
ond shollowly, your broin is olso offected; you think less cleorly ond
enter o spirol thot leods to more ponic. The trick is lo stort deep breoth-
ing before you get neryous oround women ond to continue deep breoth-
ing when you opproqch women.
Here's how you do ih proctice breothing slowly ond fully into your
obdomen. We recommend you breothe in ond count to four ond then
breqthe out while counting to four. After o few minutes of breothing
deeply, you should be much colmer. Proctice this on o doily bosis so thot
you con slow down your breoth ot will.
Visuolizing. Sto* by closing your eyes ond breothe deeply for five or
l0 seconds. Next, imogine o reloxing scene. Moybe you imogine you're
in bed or on the beoch; moybe it/s your boyhood home or your fovorite
nolure spot-it doesn't reolly motter. All thot motters is thot it onchors o
feeling of colm, sofety ond reloxqtion. lt sounds silly, we reolize, but it
octuolly works.
Visuolizing o colm scene iust before you go up ond tolk to o womon is
very usefi,'l in getting yourself into o reloxed, ployful mode. The cool porl
is thot you con use the some reloxing scene over ond over ogoin, which
will help you stoy colm. You con keep recolling lhot scene eoch time you
feel nervous.
,|fitdlins $&l8s&isn and piltric Rr8lilil, l,Jllm8n
Recolling q time you fult powerful ond confidenr. This will
offect your posture ond breothing, ond your overoll sense of confidence
with women. stort by recolling o time when you reolly hod bolls, when
you feorlessly went for something ond produced on extroordinory result.
When you recoll o fime you felt powerful, you don,t hove to drow on o
situotion where you felt powerful with women. lr could be o footboll
gome/ o roce you won/ when you osked for o roise, o greot speech you
gove or ony moment of victory in your life. lt's o woy to boost your con-
fidence. lfs o woy for you lo tell yourself, ,yes, l,ve got bolls, l,ve done
stuff thot is omozing, I con do this-no question obout it, no doubt.,,
We've oll hod momenls where we,ve performed beyond whot we
thought our copobilifies were. And you, yes, you, hove hod rhose
momenls too.
lf you toke o few seconds trc recoll o time you were powerful, you'il bd o
lot more powerful when you opprooch o womon. Remember lhose
moments ond use your post success to fuel your confidence with women
trcdoy.
Strefching. When you feel shessed ond tense, your body in rurn trens-
es up. Affer you hove done some deep breothing ond visuorized success,
ifs olso useful to srretch your body to help it relox. stond up ond toke o
few minutes to stretch your body from heod to toe. Breothe os you do it.

Ghonging your thoughts. lf you ore like most guys, the moment
before you ore going to trclk to o womon your thoughts get ugly-reol
ugly. You ihink obout oll your post foilures, oll the woys in which you
suck, oll the reosons you're o foilure with women. ln the foce of oll thot
self-flogellotion, who con be successful? Troin yourself to think obout
something pleosont, even fun, when you're oround women. Think obout
food, sporls, sex/ your fovorite movie, whotever. When you hel stressed
ond nervous, thinking obout something you enioy will help perk you uP
so you con hove fun.
Nol roking your thoughts so seriously. We oll think crozy stuff
sometimes. But iust becouse you hove o thought one moment doesn'l
meon you ore going lo hove it the next. We heor thot people who med-
itote for yeors ond yeors often comment thot they get io o ploce where
they stop toking their thoughts, feelings ond body sensolions seriously.
They reolize thot ot every moment there ore new thoughts ond senso-
tions possing through their body, ond thot's iust life.
The experience of meditqlors suggests thot we ore olwoys in o stote of
flux. One momenl we might be foeling extreme leor ond the next
moment the feor will turn into something difhrent. You ore olwoys
chonging, so one woy to be reloxed is to think, "l'm nol going to hove
this ponic thought for more thon o minute or lwo; then it will chonge.
Remind yourself thot your thoughts ond body sensotions ore nol reol ond
don't need to dictote your behovior.

You con even imogine thot someone like John Trovolto (in his role in the

Toking q wqlk. Leove wherever you ore ond wolk oround the block

leorning toi chi or yogo is greotly useful in leorning to stoy colm. You
con pick up books on these types of exercise or toke courses. Since toi
chi, chi kung ond yogo tend to be meditotive, students often find they
con use the skills to stoy colm in their doily lives, porticulorly in stressful
siluotions.
Drinking heovily. Just kidding. You con try this mefiod, but it will
usuolly bockfire. Perhops you'll colm down, but you might olso become
o belligerent jerk. You need to gouge how often ond how much you
drink so thot you con feel confident qnd orticulote ond think cleorly
when you're oround women.
There ore o lot of other things thot you con do to relox. These ore iust o

try them. The point is lo find proctices you con toke on to remoin colm

Feeling tense ond ofrqid is perfectly normol, but hoving tools to over-

As we've soid before, there is o srep-by-srep sequence of events in
seducing o womon. As you reorn ihe skiils for frirting ond torking to
women ond proctice them with women, you'll probobly find it helpful to
remember the phoses of seducing o womon.
The first phose of seducing o womon is getting yourserf reody. you
olwoys need to be getfing your mind creor ond determining if onything
is stopping you. lf there,s o post reiection stopping you, you must get
over it (see the previous two chopters). you musr ger your mind creor;
remember ond celebrote your posr victories ond get yourself into o peok
performonce srqre. You must be reody for possibre reiecrion, ond hove
hondled your ponic' Wherher you're on o coffee dote, obou*o soy hi
lo o womon or going for o first kiss, you ore orwoys going to be botiling
yourself ond your own frome of mind. Thots phose one.
The second phose of seducing o womon is inrerrupting her ond gefiing
her ottention. You must initiorre wirh women, ond it tokes guts to do thot.
It tokes gurs ro initiote the first kiss. lt tokes guts to initiote getting her
phone number ond emoil oddress. rt tokes guts rrc initiote everything. And
thofs your iob. Never foil to remember thot ir's your lob, excrusivery.

ll0trmauill{0ln0n
The third phose is the ropport phose, lhe romonce-building phose. Thot
is when you ore hoving o conneciion with somebody in which she feels
like you underslond her, she feels like she understonds you ond you iust
hove o nice conversotionol flow. The skills in this book will help you
occomplish this.
The fourth phose introduces o physicol connection. She sees you os o
potentiol romonlic portner. This involves light sensuolity.
Finolly, the fifth phose is getting inlo more "heovy''sexuol stuff. You storF
ed by getting yourself reody, interrupting her, developing ropport ond
moking her see you os o romontic possibility. Now you ore initioting thol
nexi foroy inlo sexuol contoct.

During o typicol interoction with o womon, you ore going to go through
stoges one through five over ond over ogoin. You ore olwoys going to
come bock to your stote of mind ond getting yourself prepped. You ore
olwoys interrupting her on o deeper ond deeper level.
But these phoses con olso hoppen out of sequence. You ore conslontly
going in os deep os you con go ond then bockpedoling. You go in ond
you ore holding honds ond you stop holding honds then you go bock
into the interruption phose. You might be moking out ond oll of o sud-
den find yourself bock in the ropport-building phose. A dote is unpre-
dictoble. You hove to let thot flow hoppen.

Before we get into the specific tolking ond flirting skills, there ore o few
generol concepts we should cover: the three time fromes of on interqc-
tion wifh o womon, leoving her wonting more ond other foctors in how
you oppeor to o womon.

lf you ore going to succeed in tolking to o womon, you need to know
iust how urgent the situotion with her is. Every mon hos hod o wonder-
ful womon wolk out of his life forever becouse he wosn't conscious of
how urgenl it wos to toke o risk with her right then. Understrrnding the
three time fromes of on interoction will help keep thot from hoppening.
You only hqve q few minutes. ln this situotion you only hove o
few minules, or moybe iust o few seconds, to moke contocr. you ore on
o troin or in o line ond this is your one-ond-only chonce. you soy hi to
her ond it leods to o conversotion. You hove to get her number or emoil
oddress right then. lf you blow it, she is going to be gone-lirerolly. ln
this situotion you hove to cut to the chose quickly. you hove to risk o lot
to get her phone number or emoil oddress or ilrs oll over.
one of our students told us obout being in one of these situqtions recently
while in line ot the post office. There wos o pretfy girl who wos olso in line
who mode eye contrcct with him severol fimes. He soid hi ond they storted
trc chot, but her furn come up ot the counrer ond she wos drown owoy.
www.ebook3000.com

ll$tlr l,s lhll{ 1{ wsl|r6n
Alter she finished her business ond wos leoving, he got out of line ond
followed her inlo the lobby. "Excuse me," he soid, "but I iust got ihe
strong feeling thot I ought to soy hi lo you. I know il seems slronge, but
I iust hod this feeling obout you. Could I hove your emoil oddress, ond
perhops we could get logefier somelime?" He hod o brief window of
opportunity ond he needed to toke o big risk, so he took it. lf he hodn't,
she would hove been out of his life forever.
You hqve q fuw hours. This is o situotion like on oll-doy seminor,
o porty or o work-reloted octivity where you know the womon you ore
interested in is going to be oround for o little while. You don't hove to
risk it oll right owoy; you con offord to woit, to toke smoll risks with her
over o few hours rother thon toking o reolly big risk oll ot once.
You hove days, weeks or longer. This is the woitress you con go
bock ond see over ond over or lhe womon in your oerobics closs who
olwoys works out ol 5 p.m. on Tuesdoys ond Thursdoys. You con risk
much more sloily with these women ond build o conneclion over lime.
Knowing these three lime fromes helps you know how much you must
risk ond how quickly you must do so. lf you ore putting gosoline into
your cor ond the womon of the nexl cor is otlroctive qnd you wont to
tolk to her then you hod better risk o lot right then, becouse she is obout
to disoppeor from your life. On the other hond, if thot some womon
shows up ot on eight-week closs you ore toking, you don't hove lo risk
big right owoy by going for her phone number or emoil oddress. You
con risk big if you wont, but you cqn olso toke smoller risks ond seduce
her over time.

l/s best to leove o womon wonting more. Thot meqns ifs beiter if your
conversotions with her ore shod.
Thofs not how mosr guys flirt wirh women. wirh most guys, if on inter-
oction with o womon is going well, they push it ond keep tolking until
something bod hoppens. only when rhere's o problem or bod feeling
with the womon do they sfop. Thot meons they olwoys monoge ro end
their interoctions with women on sour notes. Thofs bod.
These guys think, '!V'ow, this is going greot. Therefore, l,m not going to
try to get her number qnd close the deol, r'm iusr going to keep rorking.,,
Or they think, T V'ow this is going greot. Therefore, l,m not going to
come bock ond tqlk to her more loter; l'm going to stoy here qnd be
omozed thot i/s going well until she inevitobly gets bored. when she
gets bored I will get tense ond then when r get tense I will mess evelr-
thing up ond she will finolly soy, ,Oh, I hove to leove.,,,
okoy, moybe no guy octuolly thinks thqt-but thot's how it works out in
proctice.

Unfortunotely,you will find o woy to blow it during those first inleroc-
tions if you give it enough time. Therefore you hove tro leove while things
ore going well. ond leqve her wonting more.
Your fli*ing interoctions need to be long enough to give her o pleosur-
oble experience qnd leove her wonting to see you ogoin. lf i/s going
well, don't breok the rules-get out of there on o high note so she's left
wonling more of you, nol tired of you ond wonting less.
Thot is olso o woy to keep yourself empowered. lf you stop your flirting
interoctions wilh women while they qre still fun, you con be hoppy oboul
how well it wenl. lfll chorge you up. And thot will keep your obility to

As you stort using the iechniques in his book, you'll noturolly begin to
find yourself in conversotions with women. Lel's go over o few pointers
obout sounding ond looking good.
Breqthe more deeply. As we mentioned before, mony men breothe
into ond speok from their upper chests ond throots. This gives their voic-
es o nosol sound ond it mokes them sound tense when they tolk io
women.
T

$firs $s$n{ rllnw"
Proctice breothing from deeper in your body. Breothe more deeply ond
let your stomoch go in ond out os you do. Then toke o deep breoth so
you con feel your voice originoting from deeper in your body rother
thon exclusively from your throot ond heod. This will give your voice
more resononce ond moke il for more ofiroctive to listen to.
Adiusr your tempo. Over the next doy or so, let yourself become
owore of the speed ot which you tolk. some men tork so quickly thot
they're exhousfing for women to listen to. lf you tend to ,,speed rop,, peo-
ple, you need to proctice slowing down. lf you notice yourself tolking
reolly quickly, pouse ond toke o deep breoth. sometimes blinking slow-
ly helps.
By the some token, we've worked with some men who tolk so sroily ond
ponderously thot it's hypnotic-ond exceptionolly boring-ro listen to
them. lf you're q mon who tolks ve4y slowly, you might consider being
o little more onimoted in your speoking. Breothing more deeply will help
with this, qs will ollowing yourself ro express more of your exciremenr
when you ore tolking to people. proctice sounding more excited when
you tolk with people ond see how it feels.
Mqke eye contocf. lf you ore looking oll over the proce or sroring ot
the floor, you ore going to be unottrocrive to women. while your inter-
oction with o womon should not be o storing conrest, do mointoin some
eye contocl with her.

extremely seductive, ond ifls something you con eosily leorn to do in
your conversotions with her.
Noticing ond ocknowledging detoils obour o womon seporotes you from
other men. Mosl men don't see detoils, or if they do, they don,t comment
on lhem. Noticing detoils sets you oport from the crowd. lt mokes you
more otlroctive.
'Who/s the story behind thot?" is o simple question ro osk ofter you,ve
soid hi ond noticed some detoil of o womon's presentotion. lf you,ve got-
ten qt oll good ot soying hi, using this skill is eosy. ,lVhot,s the story
behind fiot?" is on excellenl question to osk o womon: ilrs open-ended
ond it gives her o chonce to tolk obout something thot might be impor-
tont to her.
lf o womon is weoring on inreresting-looking ring or eorrings or if she
hos on interesting briefcose or pin-bosicolly, if there,s ony'hing obout
her to which she moy hove poid speciol ottention-you con soy, ,,Oh,

Almost every womon hos o detrcil obout her obout which you could osk
'lVhot's the story behind thot?" You might soy, 'Thot looks like on inter-
esting book you're reoding. Whofls the strcry behind lhot?" or "l see you're
corrying tJne Rader mogozine. Thot looks interesting-who/s the story
behind fhot?" or "l hoven't seen o loptcp compufier like thot before. Who/s
the stcry behind fiot?" lt is o greot woy to open up olmost qny converso-
tion.
We con heor you soying, "But osking lVhot's the story behind thot
mogozine you ore reoding' doesn't moke sensel" You're right-ond thot
lock of "sense" is port of the power of the question. h's very open, so
she's free to interpret il ony woy she wonls, ond thot might leod to some-
thing interesting. At the worst, she'll osk you, 'lVhot do you meon?" ond
you con osk o follow-up queslion such os 'lVhot is it obout thot mogo-
zine thot you like?" or "Are there ony orticles in it thot porticulorly inter-
ested you?"
Of course, ifs better to notice detoils obout physicol oppeoronce lhot ore
more meoningful to her thon her loptop or the mogozine she is corry-
ing, but there moy not olwoys be something like thot ovoiloble. lf so, il's
fine to go for something mundone.
RON: Asking 'lVho/s the story behind thot?" con work reolly well. For
inslonce, I wos tolking trc this womon in line ot o coffee shop. She
wos right in front of me, so I soid hi ond she soid hi bock. I noficed
she hod on this lndion brocelet with oll these morkings on it, so I

We once hod o cooching client who reported to us ihot he used 'lVhofs

b her, 'Oh, thofs on inleresting pin. Where did you get it?' And she
soid, 'Oh, I got it qt q siore.' Thot wos the end of the conversotion-it

Another cooching client sow o womon who wqs weoring o reolly inter-

Did you spot the errors? Both of these men osked the question in woys
thot limited the onswers the women could give. The first guy soid, "Thofs
on interesling pin. Where did you get it?" Well, there's o very simple
onswer to thot question: "l got it ol o store." The question limited the kind
of onswer she con give; she could only tolk obout where she obtoined
it, which wos probobly boring for both her ond the mon.
On the other hond, soying, 'Thofs on interesting pin, whofs the story
behind lhot?" is very open. She con onswer with olmost onything thot
inierests her. She could soy, "l got it in New Zeolond" or "l gol it ot he

on incredibly wide ronge of possible onswers, which mokes it eosier for

We're obout to teoch you seven Romontic Moves (olso colled Flirting
Moves) to memorize ond implement in your life. When you implement
these moves while tolking to women your success rote will increose
greotly. lf you conduct Romontic Conversotions ond don't integrote these
moves, you'll likely stoy sfuck in the dreoded friend zone. So ifs time to
get seductive ond leorn the Romontic Moves.
The moin reoson some men get stuck in the friend zone is becouse they
don't know how to show fteir romontic interesl. Other men get stuck in
the friend zone becouse they're ofroid of being reiected. Men in both
cotegories con leorn the Romontic Moves, use them without risking their
heorts ond souls, ond finolly stop coming ocross os perpetuol friends.
lf you're like o lot of our students, you've looked ot the bod boys who
get women ond decided you weren't going be like them. You probobly
decided thot if getting women meont you'd hove to lie, monipulote

There is good news, however: you don't need to be o ierk to gel women,
though you con leqrn some things from the bod boys. The bod boys ore
willing to show their romontic inlerest right owoy ond risk rejection. The
bod boys ore willing to be upfront with their sexuol inlerest. You con
leorn lo be up front ond show your romontic interesl to women in woys
thot ollow them to feel opprecioted ond respected. We'll show you how.
When you meet o womon for the first time, i/s cruciol thot she knows
yov're o romqntic possibility. lf she sees you os only o friend, it's hord to
become her lover. We believe thol women decide within three minutes
of meeting o mqn if he's o potentiol lover or not. lf you send cleor sig-
nols fiot you're only intrerested in being friends (by not doing the
Romontic Moves), you'll blow your chonces of something more intimote
developing loter.
Men oflen think thot the Romontic Moves do not opply if o womon is
extremely ottroctive. You follow the some rules when deoling with hot
women os you do with olhers. Show your romonlic interest right owoy
with ollwomen.
h/s importont for you to fomiliorize yourself with oll of the Romontic
Moves. Find the ones thot ore toughest for you ond keep procticing them
until they feel noturol. Hopefully some of them will be eosy for you. lf so,
keep procticing them ond refining your skills. After o while, when you/re
fomilior with oll seven moves , yov'll find yourself effo*lessly integroting
them into your flirting ond your conversotions with women.

Another pitfoll to which unsuccessful seducers succumb is only using one

wilh women you will not be successfi.rl. You will nol send enough cleor,

look into her eyes "loo long." Looking into o womon's eyes,,too
long" creoles o momenl of intimocy between you ond her. ln holding eye
contoct, you're creoling o little moment in which she recognizes thot
you're romonticolly interested in her. A friend would ovoid eye contoct
ond be more cqulious, but you're no longer iust o friend. You ore step-
ping into the potentiol lover cotegory ond creoting moments of infimocy
by moking eye contoct with her.
Here's how to do il At some point while you're speoking, or during o

h's importonl to remember fiot this is not o storing conlesl, iust o little
moment of intimocy. When Bob the bod seducer looks ot o womon, he
slqres too long ond too deeply. He lenses up his body, leons in close to
her foce ond stores ot her long ond hord. The key to looking into o
womon's eyes "loo long" is to ovoid turning it into o big deol. Look into
her eyes for o beot too long-iust long enough to creote o speciol
momenl.
lf you're o guy who tends to ovoid eye conioct ond store ot the floor, you
need to proctice looking into women's eyes when you trrlk. Hoving o dif-
ficult time moking ond holding eye contoct is o very common problem,
but there is help. The cure is to stort looking women directly in ihe eye
for o few seconds ond then wolking owoy.
You con develop new skills wifh women, like tolking ond mointrcining eye
contoct, by hoining your nervous system in smoll doses lo do uncomforF
oble things ond experiment with new behoviors. When you proclice
shetching yourself in new woys, you will eventuolly become desensitized
ond fuel comfortrrble being with women. lf you're willing to stort smoll
ond build your confidence slowly over time, you'll evenluolly overcome
your feors ond be successful. lf you hove o hqrd time looking o womon
in the eyes when you tolk, stort procticing todoy. Over the next few
monlhs you will feel more confident ond comforlrble initioling ond hold-
ing eye conloct.

Moke decisions quickly ond eosily. Men who ore decisive come

ocross trc women?
When you're with o womon, moke decisions quickly ond eosily. lf you,re
on o dote ond you con sil in one corner of the coffee shop or the other,
choose quickly. lf you're ordering wine ot o bor, decide quickly. lf you,re

looking ot o womon ocross o room ond you give her o wink. Winking
creotes o little intimole momenl between you ond her. The key to success
in winking ol o womon is to be subtle ond moke sure the wink is o quick
shored moment between the two of you, not o long uncomfodoble ordeol.
Here's how to blow it:
o lf you contorl your foce ond look like on oxe murderer while blink-
ing both of your eyes ot ropid speed, you will not come ocross os

lf you wink ot o womon ond then run toword her, you will look

lf you wink ot o womon ond then stick out your tongue in on

Check out her body. Checking out o womon's body does not meon

There's o porodox obout mony women. On lhe one hond, they're offend-
ed when you store ond check out their bodies too long. On rhe other
hond, they work out oll the time so they con hove greoi bodies, dress

Checking out o womont body is o good move becouse ifs not something

quickly, you're letting her know you're romonticolly interested in her ond
not o ierk.
Here's how to blow it:
Get lo$ in storing ot her breosts.
Store qt her crotch ond lick your lips.
Nod your heod emphoticolly up ond down.
Soy "l om sloring ol your bodocious tits" when she osks you whot
you're looking ot.

Keep your body powerful. Who ore some of your seduction
heroes in the movies? ls ii Will Smith? John Trovolto? Billy Bob Thornton?
Clint Eostwood? Humphrey Bogort? The nome of your screen hero isn't
importont; the point is thot you'll likely be more seductive if you model
your behovior ond poslure on your hero. Men who ore seductive hold
their body in o powerful woy so when they're stonding, sitting or mov-
ing they come ocross os both foscinoted ond foscinoting. The woy to do
this is to pretend thot you ore foscinoted, foscinoting ond powerful ond
then stond ond move in thot woy.

Lefs do on experiment. Right now os you reod this book, sit in your
choir like you're bored to teors. Now sir up ond reod this book like
you're gefting o million dollors of volue from Louis & Copelond. Whofs
the difference in your body posture? Whofs the difference in your oilen-
tion? How does your body feel? When you ore in o stote where you ore
otlenlive ond keeping your body powerful it will show in your body lon-
guoge ond in your presentotion.
When you're interocting with o womon ond keeping your body power-
ful, you're not distrocled. You're poying oilention to her, not checking out
other women. You're not looking of your wolch, reoding q newspoper,
messing oround with your polmtop compuler-you,re only focused on
her. We're not suggesting you hove o wild, moniocol look in your eye;
don't store ot her cross-eyed ond never blink while tolking. Just focus on
the womon you're tolking to ond keep your body powerful.
Compliment her. When you compliment o womon the woy o friend
compliments o womon, you soy, 'Wow, thofs o reolly nice briefcose you
hove." When you compliment o womon the woy o potrentiol lover com-
pliments o womon/ you soy/ 'lV'ow, you ore o beoutiful womon. you

ol complimenls. As o potentiol lover; you wont to let her know thol you,re
noticing romontic detoils obout her ond you're willing to toke risks in
tolking to her.
When you compliment women you con soy things like ,,1

duced to o womon by o mutuol friend, for instonce, you might soy, "Oh,

When complimenling o womon, be on the lookout for detoils. When you
con see ond ocknowledge the detoils $ol o womon hos put o lot of effort
into, you come ocross os o potentiol lover. As we soid, o friend compli-
ments o womon on her briefcose, cor or something impersonol. A poten-
tiol lover compliments o womon on her eorrings, neckloce, hoir, smile or
something more intimote.
Somelimes friends ond lovers moy notice the some thing obout q womon
but they will bring il up in very different woys. A friend might notice o
neckloce ond soy, 'Thq/s o veD/ nice neckloce." A potentiol lover might
soy, 'lVow, thq/s o reolly lovely necklqce you're weoring, ond it iust
mokes you glow even more." A friend might soy, "l like how your belt
molches your shoes." A potentiol lover would soy, "l noticed your belt
ond shoes motch. They drow out the color in your eyes ond moke you
look even more beoutiful."
You'll moke mistokes olong they woy-we qll do. One of the situotions
mony of our students need to encounler is offending o womqn by push-
ing o compliment too for. Thot con be o good thing to experience.
Flirting with women requires risk, ond when you risk with o womon,
sometimes you will occidentolly offend her. This is port of life. The only
woy to stoy perfectly sofe is lo remoin in the friend zone. lf you're will-

ing to toke some risks ond give o womqn some compriments, you,il find
out how fo push the boundory betueen friend ond rover, despire rhe
occosionol mistoke.
As you proctice complimenting women, it's importont to find your own
unigue compliment style. Do you feel comfortoble complimenting o
womqn on her smile? whot feels too overtly sexuol to you? Whot seems
cheesy to you? Get ouf there ond find the style thot's best for you. When
you do, your confidence ond success will increose tremendously.
Whisper to her. When you whisper fo o womon, you creole o
moment of intimocy between the two of you. lt's like the resr of the world
is shut out for o second ond you,re olone together.
lf you hwe the opportunity rrc whisper during o conversorion, i/s o greot
move b mqke. For exomple, you might whisper fic o womon, ,,1 hove ic con_
hss thot you're reolly beoutiful," ot "r reolly om enioying tolking rrc you.,,
Whispering is o good tool to use to emphosize romontic tolk.
Here's how to do it:

These ore fundomentol moves to moke when you're with women to
insure thot you won'l come ocross os o friend. When you use the
Romontic Moves, you'll furn ony conversotion into o romontic one ond

When you're feeling too intimidoted to try to hove o long conversotion

But she's busy lifting weights, ond it seems like your gym isn't such o

Here's whot you do: leove the gym when she is between sets or stretch-

do it!): "Hi, l'm iust leoving ond I only hove o second here, but before I

The Goodbye lntroducfion hos four ports, ond they're oll importont:
Tell her yov're leoving. You tell her you ore leoving by soying some-
thing like "l hove to go nov/' or "l'yegorio run, my friends ore woiting for
me outside."
This is o very importont step. Most of the time, women you don,r know
well qre going to osk themselves some combinotion of three things when
you first interrupt them or toke o conversotion into deeper, riskier terri-
tory. These questions ore obout her sofety; they ore 'Whot is he going
to do to me?," "How long will it toke?" ond '!Vhy is he soying this to
me?"
This is why, when you do the Goodbye lntroduction, your first words ore
"l hove to leove." Soying thot you hove to leove mokes it eqsier for her
to listen to you becouse il onswers two of her most pressing questions.
She knows the interoction won't toke long, ond since il won,t toke long,
there's less bod stuff thot you'll hove iime to do to her. Addressing those
sofety questions is importonl, ond soying "l hove to leove" or some vori-
otion thereof hondles thot nicely.
h/s importont to know thol you con'l iust onswer her sofety questions
explicitly through some sort of direct, dignified conversotion, which men
somelimes try to do. Men who try to olloy women's feors directly olmost
olwoys foil; they end up soying something like "l'm not o stolker or ony-
thing, I wonted lo meet you" or "Don't be ofroid, I iusl wonted lo soy hi.,,

ll0uj 00 mn I0 tll0ln0n
These never work, becouse soying these things is so incredibly suspi-
cious thot they steer o womon bock into her sofety questions. She'll
instontly osk herself, 'lVhy is he telling me he's not o stolker? ls it
becouse he is one? Who/s he going to do to me? How long will it toke?"
She ends up terrified, ond the conversotion goes nowhere good.
Soying "l hove lo go," on the other hond, isn't ot oll suspicious ond
onswers her sofety questions well enough for her to relox ol leqst o little.
This ollows her to be more open ond receplive to whot you soy next,
when you...
Tell her you couldn'l leove without complimenting her. You
simply soy, "but I iust couldn'l leove without infoducing myself to the
womon who..."
Compliment her. The compliment itself will depend on the situotion
you ore in. Whot is it obout her thot you're odmiring? Are you odmir-
ing her style? her posture? her rodionce? her smile? Whotever it is, you
compliment il. (This is within reoson, of course-if you're odmiring o
womon's breosts, for inslonce, we shouldn't hove to tell you thot soying
"l couldn'l leove without introducing myself to the womon who's got one
hell of o rock" is not going to sound very seductive.) Find something to
odmire obod her thot she'll see os o compliment ond give it to her-soy
something like 'the womon who is so incredibly rodiont" or "who hos
such o beoutiful smile."
fi0ftan&is il0ys$, li0s{lcs lntl 0{g0tis||
lntroduce yourself. This port is simple-simply stote your nome.
she'll probobly respond by relling you her nome ond being friendly.
After oll, whot does she hove fo lose if you're obout fo leove onyrvoy?
From there you con either moke some chitchot (which we,ll tolk obout
soon) or leove, your self-esteem increosed by hoving token o risk ond
hoving hod o reol, romonric interoction with on qftroctive womon.
The Goodbye lntroduction doesn'f usuolly get you o dote right owoy.
whof it does do is moke you into the kind of guy who opprooches
women directly ond romonticolly, ond o big port of becoming o seduc-
er is becoming thot klnd of guy. Anhis point in the seduction skill build-
ing, the point is not to get her in bed; the poinf is to get you to be the
kind of guy who con do this sort of thing. The Goodbye lntroduction
builds thot oggressive, seductive muscle, which is whot will help you suc-
ceed with women.
Furihermore , iI you use the Goodbye rntroduction ot o gym, bor or ony-
ploce you might see the womon ogoin, you now hove qn opening with
her: you've complimented heri you've introduced yourself to her os o
powerful mon ond you know her nome. Next time you see her, you con
soy hi ond use your other flirting skills with her.

You con use the Goodbye lntroducfion to get o womon's phone number

but I iust hqd to stop ond soy hello lo fie womon who is so beoutiful. Hi,
my nome is Dovid." She might soy, "Hi, my nome is Soroh." From there
you con soy pretty much onything. lf you're ot the gym, for instonce, you
cqn osk her how she likes the gym or how often she works out. You con
osk 'lVhot's the stoqy behind thot?" or use ony of the other flirting skills.
When you ore reody, you leove-ond we suggest you do this while the
conversotion is still fun. Firsl, soy lo her, 'You know, I reolly hove to go,
but you seem like on inleresling person qnd I would reolly like to know
you o little better. Whot would it be like if we got together sometime?

As you con see, the Goodbye lntroduction is reolly very simple. You
opprooch her, tell her you're leoving, tell her you couldn'f leove without
complimeniing her, compliment her, introduce yourself ond either leove
or stoy ond toke the conversotion forther.

Skipping the first port. The most common error men moke with this
is skipping the first port of the Goodbye lntroducrion. They stort tolking
to o womon but they don't tell her "l'm obout to leove, so I only hove o
moment to lolk to you." This leoves her not knowing whot you ore going
to do to her or how long it will toke ond sends her right bock into her
sofety questions. She thinks, "Oh my god, whot is he going tc do ond
how long is this going to toke?" You've got to tell her you only hove o
momenl ond will be leoving, even if lhe contoct slretches out into o much

Not reolly complimenting her. lf you're used to being iust friends
with women, it con be very hord to compliment $em on something
romonlic or sensuol. You might be ofroid to let o women know thot you
think she is beoutiful. You might be emborrossed or worry thot your
compliment might hurt her in some woy. You might worqy thot everyone
will know whot you soid to her ond will lough ot you.
When you let these feors run you, you're likely to give o tepid compli-
ment, like'You hove o reolly nice briefcose" or'Those ore nice shoes."
Such mild complimenls don't show your romontic interest ond don't
show thot you're the kind of guy who's willing to toke some risk with
women. You're likely to come ocross os too mild, ond tho/s not good.
Nol feeling good oboul doing it. Hoving soid thot, if you're veqy
shy, giving o mild compliment ('Thot's o very nice pin you're weoring")
might be oll you con do ot first. lf so, do it ond celebrote thot you did it;
if you're shy, thot moy be o big step. Don'l expect it to blow her owoy,
becouse it won't. But it moy give you the confidence you need to give o
bigger compliment nexl time, ond tho/s oll thot reolly motters.

the first few times you do the Goodbye lntroduction will be very scory
for you. You'll be ofroid thot something terrible will hoppen or thot she'll
be incredibly upset by it or thot she'll lough ot you or thot everyone will
know whot you did ond you'll be o complete ond uiter fool in eveqyone's

go through those first few scory times to get to thot point. lf you woit for
it not to feel risky before you try, you'll never try.

Remember thof dofing is q numbers gome. As you begin to
proctice Situotionol Flirting, it's o good ideo to remember our old odoge:
"Doting is o numbers gome." Situotionol Flirting is not going to work
100 percent of the time; nothing does. Situotionol Flirting is not o quick-
fix kind of thing. Not oll women ore going to be receptive to humor;
some will get scored ond stoy scored. To o certoin exlenl, ifs o crop-

remember thol doting is numbers gome.
Women look ro you for certointy thof fhings qre okoy.
When you're procticing Situotionol Flirting with o womon, you must pro-
vide o sense of certointy for her thot whot you're doing is okoy, thot
there isn't ony problem with you ioking oround with her or with her iok-
ing oround with you.
Some women might be o little bit scored ot first when you stod doing
Situotionol Fli*ing becouse you ore definitely interrupting them on o deep-
er level ond osking them trc ioin you in o humorous, ployful pretend reol-
ity. They ore going to be looking ot you, your behovior ond your level of
confidcncc ond combrt to figure out whether or not there's o problem.

"Oh my God, is this going to work? l'm doing o horrible thing-l'm

will moke it more likely thot she will get upset. lf you seem to be think-
ing, "Greol! l'm moking this ioke ond she is going to look to me ond if
I om okoy wifi it she'll probobly be okoy with it too," she will more like-
ly be fine with it.
Ultimotely, if you moke o Situotionol Fli*ing ioke ond she hos o problem
with it, remember: il's o numbers gome ond her problems ore hers, so
whot else con you do?
Use your body. Using your bo* involves smiling, moking eye contrrct
with ond putting energy ond vitolity intn your voice. lf you're frowning,
scowling, looking ot the foor or mumbling, it's going to be hord br you trc
get Situotionol Fli*ing tc work br you. Smile, breothe, look ot her ond give
it your best shot!
Proctice, proctice, proctice. Situotionol Flirting is complicoted enough
thot you probobly won't moster it overnight. lf you're used to trying to
control conversotions with women, ond most unsuccessful seducers ore,
it moy loke some proctice before you get used to letting go of control-
ling the conversotionol outcomes ond moking creolive misinterpretotions
ond osking outrogeous questions.
To succeed qt Situotionol Flirting, you need to be in the flow of the

sod of outrogeous or silly question? Whot con I creotively misinter-
pret in this situotion thot might be funny?" I thought obout o misin-
lerpretotion: whot if she wos on undercover cop looking to orrest
underoge kids for trying to buy olcohol?
So I smiled ond osked he4 "So, whot ore Vou doiryfr Are you scout-
ing for oll the underoge people who ore trying6 buy beer? You're
not going tc bust me, ore you?" She loughed ond loked bock, "l
don't know, you don'l look too young!" I held out my wrists for her
imoginory hondcuffs ond soid, 'You could bust me if you wont "
ond we loughed together. lt moy look stupid when you reod it here
but she wos loving it.
So I took the next step: I soid, "My nome is Ron, whofs your
nome?" h led to something. I could hove gone for her emoil oddress
or phone number. lf I see her ogoin, I olreody hove o connection
with her, so it will be eosy to build upon it. We hove o fun imogi-
nory world between us now. She knows she con be silly with me.
DAVID: You hove probobly noticed thot very pretty girls often work ot
bookstores. lwos ot one such bookstore ond I sow o prefi girl
who worked there iust sort of honging out behind the informotion
$isll0lri8fiat fiirsi{ts
counter. I osked myself the question, 'lVhot is there in this situo-
tion obout which I con osk some sort of outrogeous or silly ques-
tion? Whot con I creotively misinterpret in this situotion thot might
be funny?"
So I went up to her with the book I wqs holding, smiled ot her ond
soid, 'This book looks pretty good. Hove you reod it? Con you
review it br me?" She soid she hodn't reod it, so I soid, smiling ond
prelending to be shocked, 'lVhot, you hoven't reod oll the books in
the bookstore? I thought you knew qll of the booksl You look so
knowledgeoble there behind the informotion countrer!" And she
loughed ond soid, "Nope, not mel Though I do like trc reod, I
hoven't gotien to oll the books yet. l'm still not even done with the lit-
eroture seclion, ond they keep odding to it!"
RON: There's o lot of stuff you con do in o bookstrcre. I hod on experi-
ence once when I wos in o bookstore ond I sow o womon looking ot
books obout UFOs. l osked myself, 'Whot is fiere in this situotion
obout which I con osk some sorl of outrogeous or silly question?
Whot con I creotively misinterpret in this situotion thot might be
Ivnny?"
Here's whot I did: smiling, I held up o book ond osked, 'lV'ere you
obducted by o UFO? I wos obducted once. Whot do you think? Ler,s
shore some qbduction sficries." lt sounds stupid, but she wos lough-
ing. lt put her ot eose.

ln thot situotion, you mighr olso "misinterpref' o womon to be on olien
ond soy, 'lV'ow, so ore you o beoutiful olien here to obduct people for
tests? l'll bet thotyou ore...ore you going to toke me?" lt mokes o ioke,
compliments her ond shows your romontic interesl. lt/s going to be hord
for her to stuff you inlo the "iust friends" cotegory ofter you confidently
told her she wos bequliful during your first interoction with eoch other.
DAVID: Here's onother exomple. I wenl into the bonk, ond there wos
o girl behind the counter, ond we were doing some bqnking lrons-
oction-o typicol bonking experience. I osked myself the question,
'Whot is fiere in fiis situotion oboul which I con osk some sort of
outrogeous or silly question? Whot con I creotively misinterpret in
this situotion thot might be funny?"
And here's whot I soid: "So, do you get Iokep<Wrcentoge of the
money ihot comes in? You know, like o grotuity?" And she loughed
ond soys, "Oh, thofs so fr.rnny-lwish I could." Then I took our little
shored fonicsy one sfiap further: "Oh, but then you would hove ic
pqy o percentoge of whot goes out, too. Thot would be bod." She
loughed ond soid, "Oh no, I wouldn't like thot port*l'd iust keep
the money when it comes in." I smiled ond soid, 'Thot would be
perfect for you! I con see it now...You get trc keep lhe money
becouse you do such o greot iob!" She soid, 'Yeoh, thot would be
perhct. Here's your money, hove o greot doy!" Next lime she sees
me, she'll be reody to hqve onother fun interoction with me.
Here's onother exomple. I wos ot the bonk oround Chrislmostime,
ond os I went up to the treller I noticed thot right by her window
there wos o gloss ior full of Tootsie Rolls with o bow oround it. I
n
utur!,[ouhil!rlfllmH

looked ot thot condy, ond osked myself the question, 'Whot is there
in this sifuotion obout which I con osk some sorl of outrogeous or
silly question? Whot con I creotively misinterpret in this situotion thot
might be funny?"
So I smiled ond soid, 'A ior of Tootsie Rolls! ls this br me?" She
soid, 'tVell, it depends...Hcve you been good this yeor?" And I
thought, "Grerll, she's ploying olong! Thots wonderfr;|." I soid, "l
think l've been pretty good, but in some woys l've been pretly bod,
too." She loughed, ond I soid, "l don't know, I might need some cor-
rection os well os some rewords. Do you think you would be oble trc
do thot?" She loughed, I went on with my tronsoction ond I left hov-
ing hod o successful Situotionol Flirting interoction.
Notice how these flirting intreroctions hoppen with women you see
every doy in ploces you go on o regulor bosis: the bonk, the gro-
cery store, bookstores ond so on. Using this tool, you con use these
ploces lo meet ond connect wilh women.
RON: There is one womon ot my bonk who I om working on. I om
getting closer lo osking her out by flirting with her on o regulor
bosis. So every time I go in there, I continue o running ioke
Situotionol Flirting move I storted with her weeks ogo. She is iust o
bonk treller, but I olwoys kid her obout becoming bonk president. I
soy, "Okoy, Liso, when ore they going to moke you president of
the bonk? l/s obod time! I know you hove been doing this work
only so you con infiltrote the bonk, ond I know thot pretty soon
you ore going to be the president. ln foct, I om going to be your
orrilirnt..." lt is iusl this for-out story thot I keep sustoining ond
www.ebook3000.com

l|rlur $0 lll,r x0 tj$|lme|l
thot we build upon every time I see her. l'll soy things like 'lVhen
you ore the president, I will come ond I will shovel the snow off
your cor ond we'll hong out, you'll do personol loons to me, ond
together we'll moke o killing in interest rotes..."
h/s eosy to keep it going, ond she loves it. ln her doy-to-doy lib, she
probobly feels like the lowest rung on the lodder-which she is-
ond here is o guy who octr.rolly con see her nol only for whot she is
but in o for-oul, flottering woy. So thot hos gone reolly well for me.
DAVID: Restouronts ore onother greot ploce to proctice Situotionol
Flirting. For instonce, nol too long ogo I wos in o bokery where
they hod o giveowoy going: you dropped your business cord in
this fish bowl ond if they picked it out, you won q yeoy's worth of
free breod. There wos o cute giil #hind the counter next to the
fish bowl. I osked myself the question, 'lVhot is there in this situo-
tion obout which I con osk some sort of ouirogeous or silly ques-
tion? Whot con I creotively misinterpret in this situotion thot might
be fi.rnny?"
I soid to her, "So, you're going to give me o yeoy's worth of free
breod, huh?" She soid, "Sure, if you win." I soid, "L,el me piclure
lhis now: you're going to pull up in o gigontic truck ond dump o
yeoy's worth of breod on my lown?" She loughed ot the imoge ond
soid, "No, no, I won't be doing it!" I soid, "Oh, so somebody else
will be dumping the breod on my lown ond you will be like the fig-
ure in the bockground who mokes if hoppen but doesn't reolly come
trc deliver it herself?" She loughed ond soid, "No, no, the breod will

come once o week." And so I creoted thot humorous interoction with
o womon by osking myself whot I could creotively misintrerpret into
on oulrogeous, frlnny question.
RON: Here's onother exomple from o coffee shop. I wos sitting in o
coffee shop reoding the book You Just Don't lJndersftrnd. lfs obout
men's ond women's relotionship ond communicolion issues. l'm siF
ting there reoding this book ond it is boring me, so I storted osk-
ing the womon sifting ot the next toble whot she thought obout oll
of these exomples. l'd osk her things like "lt sqys women feel like
men tqy to fix them insteod of listening. Do you think thot/s true?
Hos thot been true hr you?" lt turned out to be on hour-long con-
versolion, ond I got her number ond emoil ond ended up doting
her. Thot oll come out of osking her o silly question from the book,
eliciting her opinion ond tolking. Then, oll of o sudden, we were
connected.
ln this exomple, Ron didn't even "misinterpre/' onything. He wos simply
willing to toke whot wos in the environment ond omplify it o litle. He
wos osking himself if the exomples in the book he wos reoding were
true. Then he took his curiosity ond osked lhe womon ot the next toble.
ln o woy, thofls whot oll of this is obout. When you do Situotionol
Fli*ing, you loke whot is in the environment ond moke it o little bigger,
o little more fonciful, until it becomes o little world in which you ond o
womon con enter together. You con leorn to do this with proctice.
n

l|0!r t0l8llr l0 ws8ell
Your Situotionol Flirting con be truly oulrogeous. Just keep osking your-
self, 'lVhot is there in this situotion obout which I con osk some sort of
outrogeous or silly question? Whot con I creotively misinterpret in this
situotion thot might be funny?" The opportunities reolly ore everywhere.
For instonce, if you're drinking o cup of coffee with o womon, you could
look ot the grounds in the bottom of the cup ond soy something like "l
heord thot some people con tell your fortune by looking ot your coffee
grounds...ifs sort of like ostrology. People do it in Turkey. Would you like
me to reod your fodune? Would you reod mine?" lf you're drinking teo,
you con osk, 'Vould you reod my teo leoves for me? I wont to find out
obout love." She will lough. ond thot is o funny, romontic thing.
This doesn't even hove to be o big deol. When you're leoving o restou-
ront ond your pretty woitress osks you, "Do you wonl your receipt?" You
\
con soy, '{ell, yes, I om going to tqke this os o memento of our time
't
together. l'll'keep it forever." lf you smile while you do it, there's o good
chonce she'll lough, ond you'll hqve hod o Situotionol Fli*ing intreroclion.
Situotionol Flirting is nol necessorily obout getting her phone number {or
emoil oddress) right then ond there, olthough you con certoinly use it to
get her number. lt is more obout being o guy who knows how to flirt,
becquse flirting, combined with soying hi, combined with osking
'!Vho/s ihe story behind lhol?," combined with the Romontic Questions,
combined with giving risks, combined with everything else in this book,
is whot not only gets you o dote but gets you o dote with o womon who
hos been primed ond tested ond who is more thon likely reody to be
romontic or even sexuol with you well before the dote even hoppens.

DAVID: Here's onother exomple of Situotionol Fli*ing. This is ot o den-
tis/s office. I wos getting my teeth cleoned-ond if tho/s someihing
you hwen't done in six monfis or so, you should probobly coll up
your dentist ond moke on oppointment. The receptionist wos o very
pretty girl. As she wos checking me in, I osked her; 'Are you the
guordion of this bod, evil ploce?" She soid, "Oh yeoh, l'm the
guordion oll right." I soid, 'Well, con you put o spell on me, oh
guordion, so the work on my teelh won'i hurt?" She soid, 'lVell, I
don't know." So I soid, 'Okoy, how obout you put o spell on me so
thot the teeth cleoning won't hurt?" She giggled ond soid, "Okoy, l'll
put o spell on you. But I think you will still wont trc try the
Novocoin." So I come bock with, 'lVell, I don't know. I om preily
bewitched by you olreod, but okoy." We hod this wonderful pking
conversofion obout how she hod this mogicol power ond it wos fun
br us both.
RON: I con think of one exomple of Situotionol Flirting thot Dovid ond
I did together every time we sow o cerloin womon ot our locol co-
op groceqf store. She wos kind of punky-looking ond would weor
ormy fotigues most of fie time. So we nicknomed her the Generol,
ond every lime we wenl there we would solule her: "Hello
Generol, how ore you todoy? Whot ore our orders?" She would
iust crock up.
We hod o running ioke obout her being on ormy spy. We'd osk her,
'Are you here spying or ore you here for some covert operotion?"
And she would soy, 'Yep, l'm here spying." We'd soy somefiing
like "So, you're here to see whot is going on in this sficre in cose

you hwe to moke o ficcticol move, right?" And she'd soy something
like "l'd tell you, but l'd hove to kill you." lt wos reolly fi.,n, ond
when we'd come in, her eyes would light up ond she would reolly
look brword to tolking to us.
Here's onolher exomple: We were in New York City on o beoutiful
spring doy once doing some promotion for one of our books ond
we were wolking down the street ond these three beoutiful women
come out of this noil spo. They hod iust hod their noils done ond
lhey were odmiring lhem, ond I sqid to lhem, "Oh, i/s the beoutiful
noil women! You musl be here to show the world your beoutiful
noils. Con we see?" They were thrilled fic show us their new noils.
We told them how beoutiful they looked ond how beoutiful their
noils looked ond they were loughing ond giggling. We ioked obout
how they musi be getting reody to be in on internotionol noil conlest
ond they thought it wos greot. lt wos reolly fun for us trco.

Situotionol Flirting occomplishes o number of worthy gools:
when you proctice sifuotionol Flirting with o womon, you show thot
you're not iust o friend becouse you're ploying with her in o woy thot o
lowly mole friend never would.
You're interrupting her ot o deeper level ond inlecting yourself into her
consciousness. This shows her thot you're the kind of guy who con go
ofter whot he wonts ond con moke things hoppen.
You provide pleosure for the womon. you creote o little moke-believe
world together, which is o welcome relief from the difficulty ond redium
of her normql life.
situotionql Flirting olso brings out o ployful port of yourself, which is
se4y to women. Remember, silliness ond sexiness hove o close relotion-
ship. When you flirt ond ore silly with o womon ond provide her with
reossuronce thot things ore okoy, you become sexier to her.

ll0lx [0lbllr m til0lnon
Finolly, you provide o fun experience for yourself. When you hove fun
with o womon, you leove the interoction chorged up, with higher selF
esleem ond more energy thon when you stortred.
As you get better ond better ot Situqtionol Flirting, you'll find thot it cre-
otes q self-reinforcing rycle: the more you proctice it with women, the
more energy you hove, ond the more you wont to do it with women.
And thot's good. .

This is only o lesl... When you conduct o Deepening conversotion,
you qre testing to see if o womon might be someone you wont to go out

you'll either tolk obout topics she's possionote obout or you should prob-

Be on the lookout for openings to osk for o dole, phone number, or emoil

Deepening is for women to hove positive experiences with you, hove

CASSIE: Yes, I do.
DAVID: Where do you work?
CASSIE: lwork down ot the hospitol.
DAVID: Let me osk you o question. ln every iob there ore ospects thot
you dislike ond moments when you feel like you reolly don't like
whot you ore doing, but then lhere ore moments when you feel
like you reolly ore doing whot you were pul on eorth to do. I
would be curious to know, if you would core to shore, whol ore
some of lhose moments for you?
CASSIE: Well, I help the fomilies of children who ore getting orgon
tronsplonts. I do oll the coordinoting ond I olso deolwith oll of
their emotions.
DAVID: Tho/s reolly incredible.
CASSIE: Yes, il's on omozing iob. And lhere ore times when I om

doing whot I wos put on eorth here to do. I get the surgery ond
the orgons coordinqted. I get the kids reody ond I get the fomilies
reody ond it is like I become o member of their fomily for o while.
DAVID: Wow, thot is reolly incredible. You must reolly be o womon
who volues moking o difference in people's lives.
CASSIE: I reolly do, thot is whot I reolly love obout my iob.
DAVID: I don't get to see thot kind of o thing in o womon every doy. I

she is most possionole obout ond then you resficfigd it bock trc her,
which is how Deepening works. hrs o good exomple of strcrting wifi
o simple question ond hoving the conversotion become more intimote
ond personol. From there, Dovid could hove built up to osking br
her phone number or osking br the doe.
DAVID: ln this Deepening Conversotion I wos oble to get o lot of
informotion from her. She seemed very interested in tolking to me
ond gove lengthy onswers to eoch of my questions.

DAVID: Whot do you do?
SOPHIE: l'm on occountonl.

oble line up oll those numbers ond oll those columns. lt must feel
incredible when you hove evefihing bolonced ond everything is
perfectly in order.
SOPH lE: Yes, tho/s exoctly whot ifs like.
DAVID: Lefs tolk obout this exomple. ln this exomple I come up with o
woy to bed bock to her the exciiement of those best moments in
occounling, When I fed thot bock to her I wos oble to see some-

thing in her life thot most guys do not see. Most guys would hove
soid something like "So, whol kind of softwore do you use os on
occounlont?" Bul I wos oble to see the mogic of hoving oll the
numbers line up. When I reflected her possion bock to her, her
eyes got big ond shiny.
RON: One thing thot lwont to highlight in Dovid's exomple is thot he
took o risk when he described to the occounlonl whot might be
exciting obout her iob. I like thot he soid, "l finolly found on ongle
thot I thought might work." Lel's underline the phrose "mighl
work." When you ore hoving Deepening Conversotions, you're
going to be toking risks ond trying things out ond somelimes
folling flot on your foce. Dovid ond I hove enough experience,
ond hove foiled enough, thot we hove o clue of whot might work
ond whqt might not work, bul the only woy for you to get to o
ploce where you know whot works is through triol ond error.
DAVID: With both of my exomples, I could hove chosen lo osk less
intimote queslions-queslions thot would hove mode me more of o
friend thon o romontic possibility. With the sociol worker, for exom-
ple, I could hove soid, "Oh, where do you work? ls thot o good
iob? Wow, whot ore the hours like?" Those would hove been ques-
tions thot would hove kept me in the friend zone. lnsleod I osked,
'Whd is it obout thot thot mokes you possionote, thot mokes you
feel turned on?" When I met the occountont, I come bock with, "lt
must hel incredible when you hove every'hing bolonced." She
soid,'Yes."

h's importonl to remember thqt some women hote their jobs. So if
you osk, 'tVhot do you do for o living?" o womon might soy
something like, "lwork for o dentist. I om his receptionist ond I
reolly hote it." Then if you osk her if there is onything she likes
obout her iob, she's likely to soy, "No." lf thot hoppens, here,s
how to hondle it. We recommend you soy, "Okoy, I would be curi-
ous to know, if you ore willing to shore, whot is it thot you ore

Ron tolked to q womon recently who told him she hoted her iob. So he
knew to ovoid osking her obout it. lnsteod, he osked whot she,s most
possionote obout in her life.
KATE: I love qnimols ond I volunteer ot the pet shelter.
RON: Thofs interesling. Whot ore fhe best moments when you're vol-
unteering ot the pet shelter?
KATE: Some of the best moments for me ore when o dog comes in
ond they ore sick ond I om oble to work with them qnd nurse them
bock to heolth. I spend time with them ond then o fomily comes in
ond odopts them. lt mokes me reolly hoppy when everything
works out well. lt mokes me feel like I hove mode o difference in
the world.

KATE: Yeoh, I reolly do volue helping people. Thonk you, thofls nice to
heor you soy thot.
RON: Well, I don't meel women every doy who ore so focused on
helping people. I think tho/s reolly speciol ond I cqn see thot you
ore o speciol womon.
RON: The point of this exomple is thot o Deepening Conversotion con
go well when you osk o womon whot she's possionote obout in
her life ond ovoid focusing on her iob. Asking o womon whot
she's possionote obout in her life is o good woy to shift the topic
whenever she mentions thot her iob sucks. lt's o good technique to
use when o womon storts tolking obout ony ospect of her life thot
is difficult, stressful or chollenging. You con eosily move on to
more pleosont topics by osking her whot she's possionote obout.

DAVID: So Heidi, you seem inleresting to tolk to. l'd be curious to
know whot you do for o living?
HEIDI: l'm o writer ond q cook. I cook for o couple of people who ore
reolly busy. Both of my iobs ore pretty fun.
DAVID: Thot sounds interesting. Whot do you like trc write obout?
H E lD l: I write obout cooking, heolth ond current events. Sometimes I
review restouronts, somelimes I write oboul cooking ond other
0Bspslti[$
times I write obout heolth issues. one of the best ports of my iob is
thot I trovel ond wrire freelonce orticles for trovel mogozines. All
of my interests tie together.
RON: Le/s stop for o second. How is the conversotion going, Dovid?
DAVID: l'm hoppy with it ot this point. As we exomine odditionol
exomples of Deepening, you'll see how we go from osking whot
she does for o living to whot she,s possionote obout. I olreody
osked Heidi whot she likes to wrire obour, which is o woy to storr
exploring whot she's possionole obout. By ry osking personol
queslions, she sees me os o guy who is interested in whot she hos
to soy ond who cores obout her life.
RoN: A big port of Deepening is poying ottention to detoils. Romonce
is in the detoils. lt would hove been eosy for Dovid to soy, ,,Oh,
you're o cook ond you write, whot else do you like to do?',lnsteod
of overlooking $e defoils ond osking mundone, generol quesrions,
Dovid wos oble to dig deeper into specific interests of Heidi's ond
feed them bock to her.
Lel's go bock ond look ot more of Dovid,s conversqfion.
DAVID: I see how it oll kind of fits togetheri the cooking, the troveling
ond writing obour restouronrs ond food. Tho/s inreresting, it is
olmost os if there is this whole lifestyle oround cooking ond writing
for you.
HEIDI: Yes, tho/s very much whoi my life is obout. Those ore my key

DAVID: I know thot in every kind of iob or coreer there qre ports of it
thot kind of suck. Moybe it sucks to be woshing the dishes or cleon-
ing o kitchen, but I olso know there ore other moments thot ore reol-
ly stellor-momenls where you reolly hel like this is whot you were
pul on this eorth to do. I would be curious to know whot some of
those moments ore for you.
RON: I wonl irc butt in here ogoin. One of the clossic Dovid lines is whot
he iust osked Heidi. l/s o greot phrose.
DAVID: Here's onother question I recommend: 'lVhd might be one of
those moments where you feel the work you ore doing is reolly turn-
ing you on?" When you osk thot question or lhe one I iust put to
Heidi, the womon you're tolking to will hove to slort exploring her
life in o new woy. Let's look ol the conversotion some more.
HEIDI: Like I soid before, I reolly like to trovel, ond i/s greot thot I con
trovel so frequently. I reolly enioy meeting new people ond seeing
new ploces. Somelimes I om flying somewhere ond I think, 'lVow, I
om getting poid to do this."
DAVID: You ore moking o contribufion lo people's lives, loo. ln both the
foods you ore cooking ond in your wriling you're moking o differ-
ence in people's heolth.
HEIDI: Tho/s true. lom reolly interested in heolth ond nutrition. I like
teoching people qbout it becouse I believe the emotionol, physicol
ond spirituol ospects of life ore oll connected.
DAVID: Thofs cool. l've done o lot of cooking myself.
HEIDI: Thofs greot!
gs$psnllxs
DAVID: When I om cooking o meol, it's nice to be in o kitchen where
everything is humming olong. You've got oll these different pots of
food cooking, oll the ingredients qre cut up ond you reolly feel like
you ore on top of it oll.
HEIDI: I love thot feeling. Thofs q good woy ro describe whot i/s like
to be cooking o multi-course meol.
DAVID: Somelimes l've got o zillion things going ond l,m doing one
thing with one hond ond something else with onother. There ore
mony pots of food oll cooking ond eoch pot is cooking ot o differ-
ent temperoture ond everything is going olong iust perfectly. I
sometimes iust get lost in the process.
Yes, thot's o wonderful feeling.
RON: Le/s iump in ond moke some commenb obout where this con-
versotion is going.
DAVID: t told Heidi thot she contribures to people,s lives through her
writing ond her cooking. I decided thot it wos more powerful to
look ot how she contributes to people's lives rother thon osking
whot she likes to cook or some less personol queslion. From there I
wos oble to odmire the foct fiot she mokes o difference in peo-
ple's lives ond then feed it bock to her.
RON: ln these exomples of Deepening you con see how we ore oble
to describe to women the exciting ports of their lives in woys they
do not usuolly see. We ore volidoting something thot they don,t
normolly ossociote with themselves. When we ocknowledge those
things, like Dovid did with Heidi, we bond with the women.

DAVID: I wont to point out thot I took o risk when I told her thot I om
inleresled in cooking. As o generol rule, you should limit how
much you shore obout yourself, ot first. lt never ceoses to omoze
me how often I rediscover lhot women ore not interested in men
during the initiol conversolions.
I decided thot it wos okoy to mention thot I om into cooking
becquse I thought it would be o bonding detoil. I olso thought I
could use my interest in cooking os o springboord to stort describ-
ing good feelings ossocioted with cooking. So I tolked obout how
good it feels to hove severol things cooking ol once ond how eosy
it is to get lost in the process.
RON: Yes, thot wos o good segue for her to tolk obout her experience
os o cook. Since you ore octuolly into cooking it wos o good
move. There is no reoson to lie or even be misleoding to get
women into your life or into your bed.
DAVID: When I menlioned oll the pots going ol once ond being in the
flow of cooking, I knew she would relole to thot description. When
she responded, I could see her eyes light up, ond she smiled.
When you ore oble conduct o Deepening Conversolion ond include
the Romontic Moves, you will reolly stond oul from other men. Lel's
continue on with the conversotion ond see where it goes.
HEIDI: lfs octuolly like putting on o show or something, becouse you
hove oll these little components coming together ot once. I cooked
in restquronls for yeors ond often hod the experience of people
working together to prepore something wonderful to eot. I know
exoctly thot feeling you're tolking obout.
trssssnin9
DAVID: l've noliced thot there is o flow when I om cooking; ifs olmost
like you're doncing with it. There is olso the moment with the pres-
entotion where you ore octuolly putting the food out. I don't know
if you ever think obout putting the food on the plote ond how
beoutiful it looks on the tqble.
HEIDI: Oh yes, I om reolly picky obout thot. When I used to cook in o
reslouront, I didn't let onyone else do the finishing of the dish. t
think it is reolly importont for me to hove it bolonced visuolly ond
to hove o nice color controst going on with the different foods thot
ore on the plote. lt is definitely on ortistic thing ond I reolly
express myself through the presentotion of food.
DAVID: Those moments ore reolly speciol. There is ollthe setup ond
oll the preporolion, ond then you toke o second ond look ot oll the
food ond feel oll the effort you iust put into creoting somefiing
wonderful. You reolize thot in 20 minutes the food will be gone,
but there is thol perfecl moment iust before you serve the food. Do
you know whot l'm soying?
HEIDI: Yes, I do. l've hod thot experience frequently in my life ond i/s
reolly speciol. lt's reolly exhiloroting.
DAVID: I con see thol ortist in you. I see the ortistry in getting the food
perfect for people ond the qrlistic presenlotion. A wonderful meol
is something so creolive ond reolly gives people on experience.
The right meol is so memoroble. You put together o meol, you put
it in front of your guests ond it is perfect in every woy. You've
mode o reol contribution, which is greot.

RON: Lefs iump in ogoin. So how ore things going, Dovid?
DAVID: l'm hoppy with how things ore going. I see thot lhe converso-
tion hos gotten more inlense ond we're getting olong well. First
off, there wos tolk obout how greot it feels to be in o kitchen. ln
the bock of my mind I wos soying, 'lVell, I know lwonl her to be
feeling o sense of connection lo me, ond l'm seeing things in her
life thot she doesn't get to shore with mosl people." So I osked
myself whot else in fie oreo of cooking might be o moment where
she would feel those reolly good feelings? When I osked myself
thol question, I decided lo mention thot the moment of presentotion
is o moment where you might feel reolly good. So I osked her
obout the presenlolion. Heidi seemed to get off on thot question. I
told her, "l con see thot ortist in you." She responded positively to
thot.
You con see #ot Deepening is not gimmicky stuff. You con tell from
Heidi's comments thot she volues orl, creotivity ond selFexpression. 
I
om not using cheesy lines with Heidi, l'm trying lrc find woys to moke
o deeper conneclion.
By the woy, my conversotion with Heidi will continue in the next

DAVID: Now lel's look ot o shod conversolion betueen me ond
Megon. This conversolion is o greot exomple of Deepening ond
goes through the Deepening structure we've been teoching you. I
stort by osking Megon qbout her iob, ond the conversotion unfolds
nicely from there.
DAVID: Whot do you do in your life thot reolly inspires you?
MEGAN: lt's reolly importont to me to hove iobs thot inspire me. For
yeors I hod o iob thot I iust loved. I wos in chorge of o smoll-town
Chomber of Commerce, ond they thrived on tourism. I hod o boll
working lhere, coming up with new ideos ond promoting the
town.
DAVID: lt sounds like there were o lot of moments in thot iob where
you reolly felt like you were doing whot you were put on eorth to
do.
MEGAN: Yes, I conslontly felt like lwos doing my life's work. When I
hod o new ideo, everyone got behlnd it ond implemented it.
Sometimes the iob wos reolly difficuh. Sometimes the people in ihe
community were hord lo work with or there would be unexpected
problems. ln the end, however, when eoch proiect wos over, every-
one wos olwoys hoppy ond I wos responsible for oll the success.

ln this conversolion, look ot how Ron keeps deepening the conversotion
with Terri. Ron gets owoy with being very direct with Terri. Depending
on your personolity, being silly, obnoxious ond sort of pushy with
women might work. Whot mokes this exomple with Ron work is thot he
is ployfulwith Terri but only octs silly in the conlext of ropport building.
He conlinues to osk her questions obout whqfls importont lo her ond
whot she's possionote obout. You con get owoy with being o bod boy
when you combine moking o connection, being respectful, hoving fun
ond pushing the limits oll ot once. When you only ioke oround ond only
oct obnoxiously, o womon will not connect with you.
RON: Whoi ore you possionote obout in your life?
TE RRI: Music is one thing I reolly like. I recently storted singing ond
l'm olso leorning how to ploy the guitor.
RON: Thofs greot. I love the guiior ond l've been ploying for o long
time. I don't meet mony women who ore ospiring guitor pros.
TERRI: I iust love music. A friend of mine is o guitor ployer ond wonF
ed me to slort leorning so we could ploy together. I thought the
guitor might be more fun thon the drums.
RON: I ploy guitor, so I know whot thot is like when you ore ploying
ond you get lost in the music ond you feel like "this is greot' ond
you lose yourself for o few moments in the music.
TERRI: Yes, I know whqt it feels like to lose myself in music. I hove o
question for you, did you sing with other people when you were
ploying?
RON: Yeoh, I ployed in bonds for o long time. lwos olso o touring
musicion for o few yeors.
DAVID: I wonl to iump in here for o moment ond look ot how Ron
went quickly went from tolking obout music to tolking obout the
moment where you ore ploying music ond getting lost in the
process. He is looking for moments where Terri feels possionote.
He is toking whot she's tolking obout, which is music, ond looking
for woys to feed it bock to her in o romontic monner. Let's go bock
ond reod more.

RON: The oct of ploying music is o lot of fun. You know the feeling of
getting lost in music ond being oble to sponloneously creote some-
thing reolly bequtiful?
TERRI: Yeoh, I hove wriften some songs ond it's fun.
RON: Thofs greot thol you've been oble lo write music.
DAVID: Let's breok in here ogoin for o second. Ron tolks obout getting
lost in music ond she does not reolly onswer. So he goes bock ond
tries to qsk her o similor queslion. Ron disploys tenocity in thot he
hos to keep guiding lhe conversoiion into romonlic spoces no mot-
ler how Terri replies. When you ore hoving Deepening
Conversotions, ifs importont thot you keep guiding o womon
toword possionote conversofions ond possionote trcpics. Eventuolly,
you'll either successfully iurn lhe conversolion to something she's
possionote obout or you'll probobly wont to stop tolking to her.
Le/s look of some more:
RON: Tho/s greot thot you've been oble to wrile music.
TERRI: I reolly enioy writing music ond l'm focused much more on
music these doys thon on my job. Music iust reolly iuices me up
these doys.
RON: Do you go see live music o lot?
Terri: I don't see mony live bonds right now. l've mostly been focusing
on leorning how to ploy the guitor ond olso on creoting my own
music. l've been reolly unhoppy with my iob these doys, but music
hos been reolly fun.
llsgp$l|inc
RON: All right, set $e mood for me. Lefls soy you invite me over to lis-
ten to you sing ond ploy guitor. Lel's soy you invite me over for o
privolre listening porty, whot would the mood of it be? Whofls the
experience like for you when you ore sitting there listening to
music thot you love?
DAVID: Let's iump in. How is this conversotion going for you ot this
point, Ron?
RON: At this point I om trying to moke the big shift into osking for her
phone number ond/or osking for the dote. We've tolked obout
music ond I feel like our ropport is pretty good. So now I wont to
try to test her ond see how receptive she is to the ideo of me com-
ing over to her ploce. lf she's unreceptive lwill go bock in ond do
more Deepening, ond if she's open I will osk for the number.
Another odvontoge of testing Terri by osking how she'd feel to
hove me over lo her ploce is thot it tokes the conversotion lo o
much deeper oreo.
DAVID: Another thing Ron did in thot segment of the conversotion
wos to ovoid the trop of osking her why her iob sucks. Mony of us
foll into $e trop of trying to be compossionote mon ond coring by
osking her obout work problems. Hoving o womon tolk obout
oreos of her life thot ore not going well is generolly o bod ideq. lt
is o woy to kill o seduction. Luckily, Ron ovoids thot trop ond storts
looking ot whot it would be like for Terri to hove him over to her
house. This is where he storts pushing the limits.

RON: I wonbd to osk her o ploful ond silly question so thot if she
didn't wont to go out with me my comments would sound like o
ioke. At the some time, if she is intrerested in me she knows thot I
om inlerested in going out with her. I like testing women in o
humorous monner becouse I leorn o lot obout where I should toke
the conversotion next.
Let's listen lo Terri's onswer:
TERRI: My choice in music reolly chonges o lot. lf I om ploying guitrcr
ond singing then il's probobly folksy, ocoustic music, nothing
foncy. Tho/s the style of music I like ploying the most.
RON: Okoy, lefs set the scene ogoin. You've invitred me to your ploce
ond you ore serenoding me ond I om wotching you closely. Thot
sounds wonderful.
TERRI: Are you going to sing olong?
RON: Not ot this second, but I would if I wos with you ot your ploce.
TERRI: Do you know hormony? Con you sing hormony with me?
RON: Sure, thofd be greotl
TERRI: Gon you help me operote my four-trock recorder? I hoven't fig-
ured oUf how to use it ond l'd like to record myself singing some
of the songs l've writlen. Are you good with recording equipment?
RON: l've done quite o bit of recording ond would hove fun ploying
oround wifi your four-trock mochine. I could come over ond help
you if you wont me to.
ll0&n8llinc
DAVID: As you con see Ron wos working to noil down o dote with
her. He soid, "l could come over ond help you if you wont me to."
It seems like their conversotion is heoding towords o dote ond
Terri seems receptive to going out with him. She's osking Ron if he
con sing hormony ond she's wondering if he knows how to use
recording equipment-oll good signs. You con olso see thot he's
not octing like o friend, lhere's o romontic feel obout lhe converso-
tion.
ln the next chopler, we'll look ot severol more conversotions ond leorn
Advonced Deepening skills. But let's go over whot you've leqrned so for.
The Deepening process seems pretty simple when you reod obout it, but
conducting o Deepening Conversolion con sometimes be confi.rsing.
Here ore some key poinls to remember:
RBUl$llt 0F gil[Eillle$ Fot' [88Delll|lg
c0lluBl'$ffinll$
Focus on whct q womqn is possionofe oboul. The purpose of
Deepening is to look for oreqs in o womon's life where she feels possion
ond feed it bock to her. You ore volidoting ospects of her life thot most
people do not see or qcknowledge. When you show o womon thqt she's
speciol, she will feel oppreciotive ond bond with you.
Poy oltention lo defqils. Poy ottention to fie detoils of whot the
womon is soying ond look for woys to feed bock those deirils trc her in o
romontic woy.

Avoid the Deepening trop. As we mentioned before, when you
ore osking o womon Deepening Questions, somelimes she'll mention
negofive ospects of her life. lfs importont to qvoid topics thot she is upset
obout. When bod things come up, redirect lhe conversolion to whot is
working in her life ond whot she's most interested in.
Alwoys include the R.omqntic Moves. As we olso soid before,
to insure thot you come ocross os o romonlic possibility, you need to use
the Romontic Moves. lf you hold eye conloct loo long, moke decisions
quickly ond eosily, wink ot o womon, check out her body, compliment o
womon, keep your body powerful ond whisper to her, your chonces of
hoving o successful Deepening Conversotion ore greotly increosed.
This is only o test... ln these exomples, you con see how Ron ond
Dovid were testing the womon's ottroction ond receptivity by using the
Deepening conversotionol structure to push things o little. You should do
this, too.

A good woy to slorl o Deepening Conversolion is to osk o womon

ond flirtotious ond there is o lot of eye contocl, so I wont to bring up

before pushing conversotions in o romontic direction. Our students
often think they need to woit until the end of o conversolion to bring
up romontic lopics, but ifls often better to bring up romontic topics
eorly on. lf there is o spoce to osk Romqnlic Questions, go for it.
To turn up lhe romonce with Sue, I osked her whot o greot dote

When we left off with this chot, Ron hod iust osked if Sue thought going
lo o concert would be o fun dote.
SUE: l'd enioy going to o concerl. l'd even enjoy iust going to o bor
ond listening lo some live blues. Nothing is more fun thon hoving
fun, drinking ond doncing your feet off.
RON: Well, whot qbout going on rides on the bock of o Horley?
SUE: I think thot would be greot too. l'm on odventurous person ond I
love bikes. So my ideo of o good time would be lo just get in the
cor, or get on o bike if it is o nice night, ond iust heod out some-
where ond moybe iusl go oll night ond foll osleep where we end
up-moybe iust sleep outside under the stors. I think thot would be
so much fun.
DAVID: Le/s iump in. How is this going?
RON: I om getting o lot of useful informotion from Sue. I om osking
questions ond getting informolion on where to possibly toke her
on o dote. I om qlso osking her questions thot will hove her think
of going out with me. Lostly, I om hoving fun tolking to her.
Hoving fun when tolking to o womon is reolly importont. lf o con-
versotion is not fun i/s often o sign thot the womon is not inlerest-
ed in you. Whenever you're not hoving fun il's importont to osk
yourself who/s nol working. Are you nervous? Are you trying too
hord to get into her ponts? ls she boring you so bodly you wqnt to

ed ond being interesting oll work together.
Let's listen in some more:
RON: You've convinced me. I om reody to toke you oul, ond we leove
tonight. l/s our secret operotion.
SUE: [Loughs] I wont to explore the whole world, which is my possion.
I hove o gool to trovel oround the world before I die.
RON: Where hove you troveled? I don't meet o lot of women who
reolly go for whol they wont. I meet o lot of women who wont lo
go for it, but most don'f hove the guts lo go out ond reolly do it.
SUE: I hove been to Europe ond Mexico, but I reollywont to go to
Asio ond Austrolio. The next trip I om plonning is to visit Asio.
DAVID: Lel's iump in ogoin. ls fiere ony'hing you wont to soy, Ron?
RON: lwos feeling closer ond closer to osking her out. lwos hoppy
with the poce ond depth of the conversotion. Sue seemed to be
hoving o good time tolking to me ond we were bonding.
I used humor to connecl with her. Turning o dote inlo o secret
operotion mode it more fun ond exciting. I took the conversotion
into o different direction ond in the process we both hod fun.
Women like to go on odventures ond they like it when you con be

ln this conversotion Dovid uses the Deepening Questions you've been
leorning.
We wont to worn you oheod of time thot Louro is on odd womon, bul
very ottroctive. She tolks obout wonting to simplify her life ond ot times
comes ocross like o survivolist. Are there o lot of weird women out there?
Yes! Are there women who ore inlerested in topics you find siupid, bor-
ing ond insone? Yes! Are there women who will soy things ond give
opinions you strongly disogree with? Yes! So it's importont thot we
include some women in this book who ore o bit odd ond off-kilter since
you're likely to encounter them in your own doting life.
ln tolking lo rondom women you will encounler women who seem odd
to you. We oll encounter women who soy unusuol things. Our tosk is to
decide if they're worth pursuing. lf so, we need to stop focusing on the
unusuol ospects of their personolities. Once you're pursuing o womon/
horboring negotive iudgments obout her tend to get in the woy of o suc-
cessful seduction. Once you're in o relotionship, you need to ignore the
ospects of o womon's personolity thot bother you. lt's colled coping with
the horsh reolity.
DAVID: Hi Louro, nice to see you. l'm curious-whot is your iob?
LAURA: I own o smoll hotel, but I om getting out of the hotel business
to simplify my life. I olso own o computer consulting compony.
*&lJan8s{ $*fp8lli,ts
DAVID: Simplifying your life is such on importont thing. lwould guess
thot you ore someone who volues trying to simplify things when
everything seems complex. ls thot true?
LAURA: Absolutely, I keep working ot it ond olwoys try to simplify
things for myself.
DAVID: Whot does your vision of o simple life look like?
LAURA: Just o simple house in fie country ond not hoving to work
much.
DAVID: Thot sounds nice ond much more loid bock.
Lel's iump in. Hor/s this conversotion going for you, Dovid?
DAVID: At the beginning I osked her whot else she would like to do in
business. I wonted to throw o wide o net so she wouldn't feel cor-
nered by my queslions. You wonl lo osk women open-ended ques-
tions ond give them the room to respond how they wont.
Since Louro mentioned thot she wos simplifying her life, I osked
her obout ii. ln the bock of my mind, lwos looking for something
she's possiorrote obout, ond I kept osking questions until she gove
me somefiing to work with.
LAURA: I reolly om turned on by the ideo of living in the country
being pretty self-sufficient ond iust being oble to do whotever I
wont to do.
DAVID: So you reolly volue selFsufficiency, doing whot you wont to
do ond toking it eosy?

you wonl lo do. Tho/s cool. I don't get to meet women every doy
lhot ore so direct in their lives. lt sounds greot to live somewhere
beoutiful ond be oble to sit in the sun ond hove o good time.
DAVID: Le/s iump in ogoin. ln ihe lost seclion I spent o lot of time voli-
doting her desire trc live in q secluded oreo ond simplify her life. I
wont her to bel odmired. ln feeding bock to her the quolities she

ln the previous chopter Dovid tolked to Heidi. Here's the conclusion of
their conversolion. ln this exomple, Dovid uses Deepening to get Heidi's
phone number.
DAVID: How long hove you been writing?
HEIDI: l've olwoys enioyed writing. ln foct my Mom hos these funny
little books thot I wrote when I wos o kid which she held on to. lt is
reolly hilorious looking ol them.
gsmml8$ n*rpnlli8{r
DAVID: Whot wos one of your books obout?
One of them wos obout my cot Snowboll.
DAVID: Your cot Snowboll?
H E I D I : Yes, it wos o book full of little illustrotions. lfs pretty fi,rnny to
look ot.
DAVID: l'd like lo heor obout it.
H E I D I : lt's mode out of construction poper ond eoch poge hos onother
little foct obout my cot. I wos probobly 5 when I mode it. Loter,
when I wos Z or so, I come oul with o bigger book obout uni-
corns.
DAVID: Wow, fho/s so cool. Thofs o reolly sweef childhood imoge.
Do you feel thot now you're oble to top into thot little-kid energy
when you ore creoling stuff ond writing?
HEIDI: ltop into itsometimes. lcon feel itwhen lom writing for
myself but nol usuolly when I om wriling for work. I find myself
being oble to be free when I om not writing under the pressure of
o deodline.
DAVID: Would you sqy thot you get those moments where you feel
like o little girl ogoin? You know, iust letting it oll go ond feeling
hoppy ond corefree?
HEIDI : Yes, definitely.
RON: Let's breok in here ogoin qnd dissect whot Dovid's done so for.
Tell us whot you're thinking ot this point in the conversotion.
n
tlrsu,fioutruou{lEluf

ll0u lI0 l0llr ls l{lla8n
DAVID: Well, I knew from my previous conversotion with Heidi thot
she works os o wriler. So I osked her obout the writing. Then she
told me obout the books she wrole os o kid. I odmired Heidi for
writing those little books. When she tolks obout her current writing
I osk her obout topping into thot little-kid energy.
I om trying to focus the conversotion on feelings lhol ore open,
receptive ond sweet. l'm bringing up imoges of feeling free ond
hoppy like o little kid. You should focus on osking women obout
the best moments in their lives, both post ond presenl.
When Heidi told me obout the books she wrole os o kid, I soid,
'Wow, thqt's so cool." She wos shoring something from her heort
lhere, somelhing kind of intimote. Heidi wos shoring something
with me thot she would not necessorily shore with o sfonger, so I
wonted to volidote her for shoring those things wiih me.
HEIDI: lwish I could incorporote those feelings of freedom ond won-
der more into my professionolwork. Sometimes I con, but il's reol-
ly fun to let thot side out.
DAVID: You seem like o reolly interesting womon. lt's reolly greot fiot
you're doing things in life thot you're turned on by. l'm curious to
know whot you're mosl possionote obout in your writing. Do you
hove those momenls like 'tVow this is whot I wos put here to do"
ond you feel like the writing is coming through you?
HEIDI: Yes, lgo through periods like thot. I feelthotwoywhen l'm not
thinking obout the finol product, not thinking obout whot I need to
do. I feel reolly hoppy when l'm qble to iust enioy the process-
n6mr80s [re]s|lin$
when I con let go ond enioy writing. Those ore olso moments
where I think, 'Wow, I om getting poid to do this, it's such o fun
thing for me." Then there ore limes when I hove writer's block ond
I lust con't write ot oll ond I hove o complete lock of foith in my
writing. Sometimes there ore weeks when I iust dreod writing.
As you con see, Dovid is using stondord Deepening Questions with
Heidi. He is olso digging into whot she's possionote obout ot o deeper
level. Since he knows she's o writer he is osking himself whot could be
momenls in her life where writing feels the best. He then osks her whot
it's like when writing seems to flow, ond he osks her to describe those
feelings to him.
Asking o womon 'lVhot ore you most possionole obout?" is o clossic
Deepening Question. h/s one of those phroses you con use over ond over
in Deepening. Whenever you con find o woy to use thot question, you'll
bring the conversolion to o deeper level ond built more intimocy.
One lesson to leqrn from this exomple is to ovoid going into negotive
spoces with o womon, os we sow in the previous chopter. Heidi begon
tolking obout writer's block, which is reolly o bod feeling. lnsteod of tolk-
ing more obout writey's block ond trying to console her, Dovid simply
redirected her ottenlion. h's utter suicide lo try to fix o womon's prob-
lems. Our suggestion is to redirect her ottention.
When Bob the bod seducer is with o womon ond she mentions o prob-
lem he immediotely osks her to describe the problem in greot detoil:
"Oh, writcr's block sounds terrible. Tell me more obout it. Wow, thot
n
ullu[o$o!Wun!,[lfi
www.ebook3000.com

|'0r,J u8 |rl,{ !s |'ds}l|8ll
sounds like obsolute torture. How often does it hoppen to you? I heord
oboul o writer who hod writer's block ond she hod to be put into o psych
word - do you think thqt would ever hoppen to you?" Bob stupidly thinks
thot if he octs sympotheticolly enough ond ollows o v/omon lo shore her
deepest poin with him then she will like him. Bob in foct olienotes women
by osking so mony serious ond intense questions $ot he comes ocross
os o complele downer. By osking women to describe their poin in
greoter detoil Bob shoots himself in the foot ond digs himself deeper inio
o hole thot he con'l gef out of.
Rother thon hove Heidi tolk obout whofs not working in her life or how
often she hos wriler's block, Dovid chonges the subiect ond osks her whot
else she likes to wrile obout ond if she writes poetry. When he osks her
questions obout whot she likes in her life he shows thot he's interested in
her, but he's not giving energy to the depressing things she's tolking
oboul. He is responding by guiding lhe conversotion into o positive direc-
tion. Your iob is to guide conversolions inlo romonlic ond intimotre spoces
ond qvoid topics where o womon is likely to get depressed or feel poin.
DAVID: Whol gives you the most ioy in writing?
Heidi: I like to go to coffee shops ond observe people. I love to eoves-
drop on people. lt's fun for me to iust stort writing obout the person l'm
observing ond imogine fiol I know them. I stort writing diolog ond
imogining thot I know whot they're thinking. Sometimes my coffee-shop
writing turns into short slories. lt's reolly fun for me to do thqt kind of
writing, i/s iust something silly I enjoy.
$$us[l8s* $EEsEnin*
DAVID: Tho/s interesting, Heidi. I don't get to meet o lot of women
who ore thot creotive. lfls fun lo heor obout your writing.
HEIDI: Thonks, I love thot kind of writing. I reolly enioy observing
people ond leorn o lot from wotching people.
DAVID: Are you observing me right now?
No, not ot oll.
DAVID: Now l'm scored. Uokinglyl
HEIDI: lwrite some poetry but l've never hod ony published. I don't
usuolly shore my poetry with people; i/s iust o privote thing.
DAVID: Moybe if we get to know eoch other better o time will come
when you will wont to shore some poetqy with me. I understond
moybe now is not the right time to shore it.
Do you write poetry?
DAVID: No I don't. I om more of o nonfiction writer, but I know whot
ifs like to be in the flow like you were tolking obout eorlier. Where
you foel like the words ore iust flowing through you ond it bels like
you're in the donce of writing. Those ore moments when you fuel like
you reoch beyond whot you're normolly oble to reoch ond you come
up wit*r moteriol thot is better thon who you know yourself to be.
Yes, I know thot feeling very well.
DAVID: An importonl port of my life is hoving work situotions ond
friends in my life thot bring out the better me ond help me see
myself in o new, better light. Hoving those people oround mokes
lifu moro fun ond exciting.

HEIDI: I reolly like writing ond you iust mode me think obout how cool
it is to be oble to write somelhing ond ollow someone else to see
something briefly through your eyes ond iust know whot it is like
to be you just for o second.
RON: Let's interrupt for o second ond exomine Dovid's conversotion
with Heidi. The conversotion storted off plolul ond eosy ond now
it's getting much more intimote ond intense. Dovid's doing o good
iob hoving o heorl-to-heort tolk with Heidi.
DAVID: I storted out thot section offirming her. I told her I don't get to
meel o lot of women who qre os creotive os she is.
RON: But you ore olso ioking oround, moking some funny comments.
You're teosing her, ond thot seems to be o good woy to go with
Heidi. She seems receplive to you ond wouldn'l be reveoling so
much obout herself unless she felt comfortoble with you.
DAVID: Humor is port of the bonding process. When Heidi tells me
thot she likes to observe people, I soy, 'Are you observing me?" I
olso soid, "Moybe if we get to know eoch other beiler o time will
come when you will wont to shore some poetry with me." I didn't
push her reol hord lo show me her poetry; I iust wonted to bring
up the lopic of going out with me in o fun, holFioking woy.
One thing to notice is thot Ron ond I use o lot of "you" stoiements.
ln the most evocotive visuqlizotions, lhe person tolking does his
best to include the listener in the sifuotion he is describing. For
exomple, 'You see yourself wolking down the sloirs"; 'You see lhe
things oround you";'You feel this." All of these exomples use
8$sallss$ Ss8ssni|}s
"you" Io creote cleorer imoges. h's very useful to describe things
from o "you" point of view. Tolking to women is oll obout getting
them to feel things, visuolize things ond imogine things.
Thofs why utilizing the you perspective in your speoking is so
importonl. lf you ore describing how greot it feels to be in the flow
of writing you might soy, "l feel so good when I om there ond the
energy is lust flowing through me ond the words ore iust flowing
through me." h's o lot more powerful to soy, "li feels so good
when you ore there ond you ore writing ond the words ore iust
flowing through you ond you feel so connected to something lorg-
er thon yourself, do you know whot I meon?" I wos iust describing
thot feeling os if she is hoving it. My hope is fiot when I use you
stotemenls she'll soy to herself, "lt's omozing thot I om with this
guy who understonds thoi."
RON: lwont to point out thot in fie previous conversotion Heidi is
tolking more then Dovid. Dovid is shufting up long enough to listen
to whot she's soying. He's lhen toking his time to conslruct o
response thot is either o bonding visuolizolion or o question thol
pulls the conversolion into o more intimote spoce.
Eorlier in this book we tolked obout the power of describing
romonlic scenes ond situotions to women. We told you thot whot
you describe lo o womon is whot she will feel. When you describe
romontic scenes o womon hos to go inside herself ond experience
those feelings. A new woy to opply the principle of describing
feelings is io osk o womon Romontic Questions. When o womon
onswers Romontic Questions ond describes o romontic situqtion to
It

you, she'll experience it while describing il to you. For exomple, if
you osk o womon obout her dreom vocolion ond she describes ii
lo you, she will hove lo go into her imoginotion ond experience il.
Whether you describe romonlic scenes to o womon or you osk
Romontic Questions thot invoke o romontic response from o
womon the result is the some: she experiences romontic feelings.
Let's go bock ore reod more of the conversotion.
DAVID: I would like to know more oboul you. Moybe I could reod
some of your writing somelime. Whot would it be like if we got
together for o cup of coffee sometime ond lust tolked more obout

Another exomple of volidoting her is when I soid I don't get to
meet mony women who hove lived like thot. An importont ospect
of Deepening is osking questions to find out whot o womon vol-
ues. From there, fie nexl slep is odmiring whot she volues qnd
feeding it bock to her.
KATIE: Do you like to trovel?
RON: Yes ldo, olthough lrorelygo plocesos unusuolos Bonglodesh.
l/s omozing when you trovel, you get to see new things ond expe-
rience q new culture. When you lrovel you get to let different ports
of yourself come out. Do you know whot I meqn?
KATIE: Yes, tho/s one of the moin reosons I love to see new ploces.

RON: I would be interested lo know whot port of your trip touched
your heort the most.
KATIE: The woy people were welcoming to me ond let me into their
homes. lt is not something thot you see every doy. My fovorite port
of the trip wos meeting new people. I mode o lot of speciol con-
nections.
RON: Did you hove ony experiences thot kind of iust sticks in your
heort? Do you recoll experiences thqt ore postcord moments thot
you'll remember for the rest of your life? l'd be curious lo know if
you hod experiences ond moments like thot.
DAVID: Lefls iump in. Whot's interesting lo me in this conversotion is
thot Ron is toking this seemingly mundone conversotion thot hos
nothing romontic in it ond progressively toking it to deeper levels
of ropport building. Ron ond Kotie hqve o connection building.
She is storting lo lrust him, ond he is listening ond feeding bock
the positive things she is soying. By listening ond feeding bock
whot he heors, Ron is showing his interest in Kotie.
RON: Kotie storted osking me questions. But opening conversotions
with women ore more obout how you moke them feel, not obout
your showing off, so I tried to ovoid tolking obout myself ond
insteod focused on feeding bock to Kotie $e positive feelings of
troveling.
Next, I osked odditionol Deepening Questions to get her tolking
more obout troveling. I osked Kotie, 'lVhen you ore troveling,
whot touches your heort the most?" Then I osked her, 'lVhot ore

you tolk to women.
KATIE: Well, it's not something I core to think obout often, but there
wos o reolly bod slorm ond there wos o mudslide thot we some-
how escoped. Thot port of the trip sticks out in my mind.
RON: Wos ihere o good port to thot crisis? Like feeling thot you hove
o deeper oppreciotion for life? Whot wos the most positive thing
you wolked owoy from thot experience feeling?
DAVID: Lel's iump in ogoin. We've seen conversotions move into neg-
otive directions before. We told you thot il's imporlont to redirect
conversolions inlo more positive topics. When Kotie mentioned she
wos stuck in o mudslide lhe conversotion could hove become
depressing ond unpleosont. Ron wos oble to gently move the con-
versolion to o different topic ond keep focused on building his
ropport with Kotie.
RON: I noticed thot Kotie wos running the horrible scene of borely
escoping o mudslide in through mind. I didn't wont her to feel the
bod feelings ossocioted with thot experience, so I took the conver-
sotion in q different direction. I wosn'l sure whol to soy to her, but
I come bock with, '!Vos lhere o good porl to thot crisis?" I knew I
hod to move quickly ond come up with something to guide the
conversotion onto o different topic.
DAVID: lf you hod let Kotie keep tolking obout the mudslide it could
hove become o depressing. She might hove soid, "Kids died in
thot mudslide..." So il's greot thot Ron interrupted her. Women

don't olwoys tolk obout upbeot subiects so you need to leorn how
to furn negotive lopics into positive ones.
You con hondle negolive lopics by osking ony of the following questions:
'aVhot wos the best port of it?"
'lVos there o positive port in oll of it?"
"Whot did you leorn from lhol experience?"
"How hos thol experience chonged you?"
KATIE: Surviving the mudrlide mode me oppreciote life o lot more. At
$e some time I felt proud of myself for surviving such o scory
experience ond chollenging myself. I reolly like pushing myself
ond putling myself out $ere. l'm glod I hod such on intense expe-
rience in Bonglodesh.
RON: I con see in tolking with you thotyou reolly push yourself ond
live life on fie edge. lt seems like you're someone who is strong in
the foce of uncertointy. I reolly odmire how you live life fully.
RON: One thing I noticed in tolking to Kotie is thot she pushes herself
lo try new things ond is reolly courogeous qnd odventurous. ln
Deepening I om looking for whot she is possionote obout ond
whot she volues, so I wonted lo let her know thot I see her os o

RON: I know exoctly how it feels to reolly push yourself ond reolly go
ofbr whot you wont. Like when you meet someone you con con-
nect with or you feel like they open their heort to you in o certoin
woy. There is something reolly speciol obout being open like thot. I
donl think we get enough of those moments in our lives.
KATIE: Being in Bonglodesh ond hoving people be so kind to me
mode me wont to be more open to people in my everydoy life. I
try to be friendly when I om out oi the grocery store doing little
tosks ond erronds thot seem mundone.
RON: lt's been greot to meet you, but I need to run in o second.
Moybe we could get together for o cup of coffee sometime ond
tolk some more.
Kolie: Sure, thot would be greot. Moybe you could tell me obout your
trovel experiences.
RON: Whd is your phone number ond emoil oddress? lt would be
greot to go out sometime this week.
KATIE: Here, l'll write down my number ond emoil.
RON: When Kotie mentioned thot she tries to be friendly when she's
out shopping ond running erronds, I thought thot wos o good
segue trc osking her out. I wonted lo end the conversqtion on o

Here's o good phrose to use when osking o womqn for her num-
ber: "h/s been nice tolking to you, perhops we con get together
sometime ond tolk obout this some more." You don't need ony-
thing foncy or speciol. You don't need o perfect line, you iust need
to open your mouth ond qsk her out. After you hove her phone

Le/s recop whol we've leorned in this chopter:
Conversqlions with women somelimes foil. Deepening
Conversqtions don't olwoys go well. There is no mogicol formulo to hove
successful conversotions wilh women 100 percent of the time. Sometimes
the conversotion goes well ond sometimes you flot on your foce.
When bod-luck seducer Bob hos Deepening Conversotions thot go
poorly, he's shocked. "l did whot Louis & Copelond soid in thot domn
book ond the one womon I tolked to didnt wont to moke out with me.
Those guys ore ierks. I wonl my money bockl" Bob foils to reolize thot
mosl conversotions with women will not leod to getting o phone number,
let olone sex. Bob's so focused on finding o mogicol solution to getting
women trc dote him thot he forgets thot tolking to women is o numbers
gome, ond work. lnsteod of tclking to severol women until one is interest-
ed in tolking lo him, Bob would rother blome everyone else ond comploin.

The trick in rolking lo women is to be persistent. When one
conversotion goes poorly, move on ond tolk to onother womon. When
o conversotion goes poorly, iust cholk it up to experience. lf you ore per-
sistent ond tqlk to dozens of women, you'll eventuolly hove successful
Deepening Conversotions. Afiter o few successful Deepening
Conversotions you'll get o phone number ond things will keep pro-
gressing from there. lf you ore willing to do the work ond be potient,
success is inevitoble.
lnclude yourself when describing scenes. ln Deepening you
ore creoting romontic imoges through descriptions of romontic scenes.
ln Advonced Deepening you ore describing scenes where you ond your
conversolionol portner ore together in the scene.
For inslonce, insteod of describing o greot concerl, describe o sifuotion
where you ond she ore ot o concert together hoving o wonderful time.
When you describe romontic scenes with the two of you, o womon will
hqve to go inside ond imogine thot picture of the two of you together. By
describing scenes to o womon you increose your chonces of getling her
number. You'll olso improve your chonces of hoving her see you os o
romontic possibility.
We reolize thot including yourself when describing scenes to women con
be confusing. l/s o new skill thot you need lo procfice. Try writing out
polentiol conversolions ond proctice osking questions out loud ot home.
The more proctice you hove the eosier it will be to include yourself in
scenes when you hove o womon in front of you.
nfiran88d 88sp*llinc
Assume ropporl. By this we meon thqt when you're tolking to o
womon you should ossume she is enioying tolking to you ond being with
you. When o solesmon ossumes ropport. he ossumes thot his prospec-
tive customer likes him, is interested in whot he's selling, hos similor vol-
ues ond trusts him. h's cruciol to ossume the best when you're with o
womon.
Bob ossumes thol every womon he tolks to will hote him ond thot every
interoction will go poorly. When he tolks to women ond osks Deepening
Questions his certointy thot the interoclion will go poorly comes ocross
in his fone of voice ond his presence. Becouse Bob is so cerloin his con-
versotions will go poorly, he comes qcross os ongry ond meqn.
You con teoch yourself to ossume ropport by reminding yourself thot
women ore interested in tolking lo you ond find you otlroclive. You con
tell yourself thot the interoclion is going well. When you ossume women
like you, you will not only feel more confident ond more reloxed, you
will olso be more romontic, eosygoing ond likeoble. Assuming ropport
is cruciol in tolking to women.
Ask open-ended questions. We've menlioned the importonce of
osking open-ended questions before. You need to cosl the widest net
possible when tolking io women. The gool is to creole o spoce for
women to feel comfortoble ond reloxed tolking to you. Bob is o moster
of osking questions so thot women feel tropped. Here's on exomple of
Bob's ottempl ot Deepening:
BOB: Hi, did you see the new John Trovolto movie?
I
llilIu[rubllqlglrrltultti

ll$$ &e trat'i ls s,smsl}
WOMAN: No, I hoven't. Did you?
BOB: So you didn't see thot movie? Why not? ls it becouse you don'l
like movies or is it becouse you don't like John Trovoltq?
WOMAN: Oh, I iust hoven't seen o movie in few months. l've been
working o lot. Did you see the movie?
BOB: Oh, so you must reolly hote your iob since you hove to work so
much. I hote iobs where they force you to work overlime ond don't
poy you.
WOMAN: Oh, I must go now. Bye.
Bob osks closed ("yes-or-no") questions thot hove on occusotory feel to
them rother thon open-ended questions lhot encouroge o womon to tolk.
Bob not only osks yes-or-no queslions, he orgues with the womon's
response rother thon encouroging her to tqlk. Don't box women into
onswering yes-or-no questions or questions thot limit their options. Ask
open-ended questions so thot lorger conversotions con develop.
Fun, fun, fun. Whot's more romonlic to o womon/ o mon who is
stressed, neryous ond uptight or someone who is reloxed, ployful ond
hoving fun? The onswer is cleor: men who ore oble to enioy themselves
ore much more otlroctive thon guys who ore uptight ond worried.
Women's bullshit detectors ore much more ottuned lhon ore men's.
Women know when you're nol interested in tolking to them, when you're
neryous ond when you're not hoving fun. So we strongly recommend
you find fun woys lo moke conversotions with women fun. Bring up top-
ics thot ore enioyoble for you. Mention things you find funny. Ask ques-
n8{nn88* sEspnl|ills
lions you're curious obout. Hove o good time.
Tolking lo women should not be on ordeql. When Bob tolks to
women he's constonlly preoccupied with osking the perfect queslion. He
is so cought up with his own thoughts ond concerns thot tolking to o
womon is o stressful, horrible offoir. Bob is too ofroid trc toke ony risks
ond so he folls deeper into o feor spirol. He is too ofroid to shore ony-
thing obout himself, mention onything he considers funny or osk ony
quesiions thot ore romontic. His feor creoles o situotion thot is unpleos-
ont for both himself qnd the womon.
Here ore some surefire woys to nof hove fun when you're wilh o womon:
Trying to be perfect
Asking questions thot you don'l core onything obout
Never shoring onything obout yourself
Not toking ony romontic risks
Worqying lhot you're doing evefihing wrong
Never smiling
Solely focusing on getting into her ponts
Never crocking iokes
Worrying thot evefihing you soy will offend her
Solely focusing on hoving her not think you're lrying to get
into har ponts

lf you ore oble to let go, hove fun ond loke some risks with women, you'll
be more reloxed ond more fun to be oround. Fun ottrocts more fun; feor
tends to creole more feqr.
Don'l be o strqngea When tolking to women be on the lookout for
detoils she's shoring with you she wouldn't normolly shore with o
stronger. These ore detoils you wonl to ocknowledge.
Deepening Conversotions ore oll oboul creoting o connection with o
womon thot mokes her feel thot you see some$ing in her to which most
people ore not privy. When you ore oble to see things in her thot most
men don't see, intimocy is creoted. When you stort creoting emotionol
connections, she'll wont to connect more deeply with you.
Admire her. You wont to be the kind of guy who ocknowledges
women. Everyone feels good when they're ocknowledged. When you
odmire o womon for her strengths or loke notice of whot is speciol io her
ond whot is speciol oboul her, she'll feel closer to you.
Ask obout greot momenls in her life. ln Deepening you ore
focusing on o womon's life ond looking for speciol moments to ocknowl-
edge. You ore looking for times in her life when she felt best, moments
she's mosl proud of, her occomplishments ond her possions. Ask women
obout greot moments in their post ond greol momenls in their current
life. Two greot questions to use ore 'lVhot ore you mosl possionole
oboul?" ond 'Whot ore the postcord moments thot you will remember
for the rest of yovr li[e?"

Don't push too hqrd. You do not need to push women inlo sexuol
or romontic tolk. The purpose of Deepening is often iust to bond.
Without the foundotion of bonding there is no hope of turning things
sexuol. lf you skip this eorly work you'll foil miserobly loter on. The gool
of Deepening is trc creole o bond, develop ropport ond loy the ground-
work for osking for o number. Sometimes the conversotion turns romon-
tic; other times ifs much lighter. ln either cose $e gool is to move from
being o stronger to creoting enough of o connection to toke the next step.
Some women qre weird, wocky ond sftqnge. We oll
encounter women who soy unusuol things. lf she's worth pursuing, slop
focusing on the unusuol ospecls of her personolity. Once you ore in o
relotionship, you need lo ignore the ospects of o womon's personolity
thot bother you. lfs colled coping with the horsh reolity.
The importonce of "yott" stqlemenls. The most evocotive writ-
ing ond visuqlizotions strive to put fte lislener in lhe scene by using the
word "you." lfs very useful to describe things from e "you" point of view,
ie, 'Yeo, I think i/s so greqt when you ore hoving o perfect doy, ond you
con iust breothe in ond reolly feel good obout whot you've occom-
plished."
Tolking to women is oll obout getting them to feel things, visuolize things
ond imogine things. Thot's why using fie "you" perspeclive in your
speoking is so importont. Toking on o "you" perspective might toke some
proclice, but il's worth it. Do you understond?

Women mighr turn the tobles on you. Eventuolly o womon will
turn he tobles on you ond stort osking queslions oboul your life ond
possions. We recommend you reply with romontic ond open-ended
responses. You need to reveol detrcils oboul yourself, but you con do so in
q wqy fiot is not brogging or time-consuming or boring for the womon.
When o womon osks Bob whot he's possionote obout in his life he
begins tolking b her obout his new flot-ponel compuler screen, the greot
screen resolution it hos, ond how the competitoy's version sucks. Bob goes
off on o IO-minute longent on o topic lhe womon could core less obout.
Bod move. Jusl give o short response oboul yourself ond then osk oddi-
tionol Deepening Questions ond refocus the conversotion on her.
Shul up qnd listen. When you're conducting Deepening
Conversolions it's cruciol thot she tolks more thon you do. When you're
hoving o Deepening Conversotion, shut your pie hole while she onswers
your question. Don't interrupl o womon when she's tolking. lnsteod, lis-
ten ond trrke time to construct o response thot is either o visuolizotion
bosed on whot she's iust told you or o question thoi evokes more infor-
motion from her.
When Bob conducts Deepening Conversotions, he never shuts up. He
inlerrupts lhe womon when she's tolking obout her fovorite vocolion ond
brogs obout his Aloskon cruise. Bob constontly interrupls women when
fiey're telling him key informotion. Rother thon listen, Bob enioys offer-
ing his opinions on whot o womon is telling him. When Jennifer told him
obout the besl ports of her iob, he lectured her on why she should quit
her iob ond find o higher-poying profession.
$dsaN|88{ $ess8llin$
Bob con't contoin his thoughts enough to creole o bond with women.
You need to shut up long enough for them to respond. A good rule of
thumb is they should tolk Z0 percent of the time, you should tolk 30 per-
cenl of the time.
Tolking to women is like fishing. lf the first question you osk o womon
doesn't elicit o iuicy response, move on lo onother question. ln
Deepening you ore fishing by osking queslions ond finding out whot
she's possionote obout. Once you gei o strong response from he4 osk
more queslions ond feed bock more situotions to her. Just like with fish-
ing, you're potiently woiting for o bite. Once you gel one, you quickly
go for it ond get her tolking obod whot she's possionote oboul.
Deepening Conversqlions ccrn leqd to fouching ond more.
When you con touch o womon os port of o Deepening Conversotion you
ore helping escolote the seduction. Mosl men woit until the end of o dote
before doing onything physicol. During Deepening Conversolions, how-
ever, lhere ore often openings for touch. When osking o womon obout
her ring, for exomple, you could touch her hond. When sitting next to o
womon, you could "occidentolly'' brush ogoinst her orm.
When you touch o womon, do so gently ond os unobtrusively os possi-
ble. lf o womon reocls negotively, thot is o sign to slow the seduction
down. lf o womon seems open to fouching, ifls o sign to go for fie next
level of touching or kissing.
When the conversotion goes downhill. Severol times during
this chopter we mentioned how importont it is to ovoid tolking obout
depresing topics. When o womon slorls tolking obout bod experiences

or depressing lopics, your iob is to redirect the conversotion to o differ-
ent topic. Here qre o few phroses you con use:
'lVhot wos the best port of it?"
'lVos there o good port to lhol crisis?"
"Did you hove o deeper oppreciotion for life?"
'lVhot wos fie mosf positive thing you wolked owoy from thot expe-

toke your conversotions wilh women to on even deeper ond more seduc-
tive level.
Before we cqn get into osking Romontic Questions, though, it's impor-
tont for you to review the power of description, becouse description is
the key thot mokes Romontic Questions work.

There is o fundomentol concept thot underlies everylhing romonlic thol
you soy lo o womon. lt is on ideo qbout the woy people's broins work,
ond it ir vory simple: when you describe something to somebody, she

Hopefully, you ore slorling to get o feel for how oll of this con fit togeth-
er. You initiote with women by soying hi, using the goodbye introduc-
lion, or though ony olher sociol meons thot gets you tolking to onother
humon being. From there you toke some deeper risks, doing the flirting
moves lo get yourself out of the "friends" zone, osking 'Whofs the story
behind thoi?", using situotionol flirting, ond, now, odding in Deepening
conversolions.
Now we'll move on to the next step in tolking to women: Asking
Romqntic Questions. o

must go inside ond imogine it or experience it so she con underslond
whot you ore tolking obout.
The clossic exomple of this phenomenon involves describing on ele-
phont. lt is huge, it hos big white tusks, groy skin, o long trunk ond big
floppy eors. ln order to understond this description, you hod to imogine
whot we were describing, ot leost to some extent. Even if you wonted to
resist us ond decided thot, no motler whot, you were nol going lo imog-
ine on elephont, you'd still hove lo imogine one to know whot you
shouldn't imogine. This is o bosic principle of how the mind works: if you
describe something to someone, ihey outomoticolly imogine it.
This little quirk in the humon mind reolly works in your fovor when you
tolk to women becouse it doesn't only work if you describe things like
elephonts. lt olso works if you describe experiences like love, romonce,
seduction ond orousol. lf we were to describe on experience lo you,
you'd hove to imogine hoving thot experience, ot leosl to some smoll
extenl, simply to understond whot we were tolking obout. (The extent to
which you hod thot experience would depend on how well we described
it.) lt/s on involuntory reoction, ond eveqyone hos it.
This is your occess into the emotionol being of o \ /omon. lf you ore tolk-
ing to o womon ond describing romontic experiences, erotic experi-
ences or emotionol experiences, she is going to hove to go into her mind
ond experience those experiences iust to trock with the conversotion.
When o womon hos those feelings while she is looking ol you then you
ore hoving o romontic interoclion.
n8fl$nlii6 &{g$si$l}s. $&l'& !
lf you don't believe thot describing on experience con influence feelings,
look ot it from the other side: no one would disogree thot describing dis-
gusting things hos on effect on someone's inlernol emolionol slote. You
don't wont your dinner componion to describe creepy, slimy worms
while you're eoting spoghetti becouse you'd noturolly imogine worms
qnd feel revolted by the plote of spoghetti in front of you. This mirrors
the bosic principle of seductive conversolion.
DAVID: Just lost night I wos doing some lnternet flirting. lwos osking
o womon oboul romonlic experiences she hqd hod ond out of the
blue she storted into this tirode obout obortion ond how bod
obortion is ond how she is totolly ogoinst it. Now one thing I
could hove done wos fight with her qbout it, bul olreody she wos
imoging oll this horrible stuff obout obortion in her heod ond feel-
ing her feelings obout it. Fighting would only hove mode il worse.
I could olso hove osked her not to think obout it, but she still
would hove hod to imogine whot she shouldn't be thinking obout,
so it might hove mode those horrible pictures she wos imogining
even more vivid.
So I let her soy whot she hod to soy ond then I come bock with
"L,el's tqlk more obout doting. Le/s ilrlk more obout romonlic experi-
ences. Le/s tolk obout how the heort opens up with someone who
you reolly bel connected fic." Those were the kind of experiences I
wonfed us to be trclking obout so she would be hoving lhose romon-
tic experiences inside ond connect them to me, rother thon hwing
her think obout obortion ond connecting thot to me. And it worked;
she got off her obortion tirode ond we hod o greot romontic tolk.

like everything iust went sour. You were getting olong greot, then sud-

you did. lf you were to look ot o lronscript of thot conversotion, you'd

things you didn't even reolize you were tolking obouf perhops you
tolked obout porn or wor or something else thot, when she imogined it,
reolly turned her off. Sometimes it con be o lot subtler thon you reolize.
With women, you reolly don't know whot is going to hoppen; you hove
to sloy owoke, be presenl ond poy ottention to the conversotionol topics
thot turn her on ond the things thot turn her off.
We will get into the specifics of using romonlic descriptions with women,
but here's the bottom line obout how we use them: through tolking, ques-
iioning ond listening, we look for things thol women ore possionote
obod ond volue. We then either get women to describe the feelings of
those possions ond volues lo us or we describe them to the women. They
qre then oble to experience ond dwell on those feelings while being with
us. This creotes o very reol ond romonlic connection.
Success with women isn't totolly obout whot you look like, whot you do
or how much money you moke, even though those things ore obviously
foctors. Success with women is qbout how you moke women feel*thot's
*r!'lr*r!&is *u8$&i(ln$. pSfQ I
whofls most importont. lf you moke o womon feel excited, turned on ond
opprecioted, she's going to be o lot more likely to go for you.
ln the next few chopters you will leorn the specific flirting skills necessory
to turn onything thol o womon soys into o Romonlic Conversotion. We
meon it*if she tells you she's on occounfont, you'll be oble to turn lhot
into o Romontic Conversotion. The first step is understonding the struc-
ture of Romontic Questions.

A properly osked Romonlic Question hos three components:
o The excuse
The description
The question
Let's look ot eoch port.
THE EXCUSE. When you osk o womon q Romontic Question, you need
to slorl with on excuse. The excuse onswers the question the womon will
be osking herself obout your question, which is '!Vhy is he osking me
this?" lf you con onswer thot question right owoy with your excuse, il will
be much eosier for her lo open up to you.

Most of the fime, women you don't know well ore going to osk them-
selves some combinotion of their sofety questions when you first interrupt
them or when you toke the conversotion inlo deeper, riskier territory.
Remember, these questions ore 'tVhot is he going to do to me?," "How
long will it toke?" ond 'lVhy is he soying this to me?"
When you osk o Romontic Question, the excuse onswers the question
'Why is he soying this trc me?" lt gives her o context for whot you're osk-
ing, which helps o womqn relox into the interoction.
A Romontic Question stonding on its own con seem invosive ond scory
but when you odd on excuse ond description, olmost ony question con
become polotoble.
Lefls try this out on one of the tockiest questions you cqn osk o womon:
"Do you believe in love ot first sight?" You'll probobly ogree with us thot
most women would think of this os o hockneyed line, which il is. But let's
see whol hoppens when we odd on excuse to il. Which question do you
think would moke it eosier for o womon lo relox ond onswer: "Hey, do
you believe in love ot first sight?" or "l've been tolking to my friends
obout this ond sort of toking on informol survey. Do you think people
con foll in love ot first sight?"
We qren't recommending such on overused line, but the second version
of this question would be eosier for o womon to onswer. Thol's becouse
it hos on excuse ottoched to it. The womon con soy to herself, "Oh, he's
osking me this becouse he's been tolking oboui it to his friends. Okoy."

THE DESCRIPTION. This port of o Romontic Question helps guide the
womon to the kind of onswer you ore looking for. lt olso describes the
kind of feelings you wont her to imogine hoving while she is onswering
the question.
Lefs odd o descriplion lo our test question: "l'ye been lolking to my
friends obout this ond sort of toking on informol survey. lt seems like
sometimes you meet someone ond lhere's iust on immediote click, do
you know whot I meon? Like, 'Oh, i/s you,' even though you've never
met before. So l've been wondering, do you think people con foll in love
ot first sight?"
The description we odded to this Romontic Question suggests the feeling
you wont your conversotionol portner to feel ond olso guides her toword
the kind of onswer you ore looking for. Agoin, i/s worth noting thot even
o tocky question con slort seeming downright interesting when you odd
on excuse ond description to it.
THE QUESTION. The question is simply $e Romontic Question itself-
in our exomple, "Do you think people con foll in love ot first sight?"
Once ogoin, lefs look ot the Romontic Question in its entirety. Notice
how much more normol-sounding ond less tocky the question is when
the excuse ond description ore in ploce. Then think obout how well this
would work with o question thot hosn't olreody been beoten to deoth in
every bor in weslern civilizotion:

though you've never mel before. So l've been wondering, do you think
people con foll in love ot first sight?"
Romonlic Questions push the conversotion inlo o romontic direction.
When you osk o Romontic Question, you ore toking things to o more
intimote level. You need to be respectful of thot foct, by setting up your
queslions in the most non-invosive woy thot you con. The woy you do
thot is by hoving on excuse ond o description before you osk your
Romontic Question.
Le/s look ol some exomples.

THE ROMANTIC OUESTION: 'lVhot mqkes your heort flufier?"
You don't iust osk thot question outright becouse it would sound owk-
word ond weird. You'd dump her right into her sofety queslions: 'tVhy
is he soying this to me? Who/s he going to do to me?" You need lo set
up your question with our three-step process.
Here's lhe full woy of osking il: "l wos thinking the other doy obout how
omozing it is to be moved to the point where your heort flutters. Moybe
you've seen o piece of ortwork or heord some music ond itt like the pos-
$sm*nsill $lls8$iells" $a,,& tr
sion lust builds in you ond you feel it so intensely in your heort. l'd be
curious to know, whot mokes your heort flutter? Whot's on exomple in
your life of thot?"
Lefs breok fiot exomple down into the excuse, the description ond the
question itself:
TH E EXC U S E. "l wos thinking the other doy obout how omozing it is to
be moved to the point where your heort flutters." Thol onswers the ques-
tion 'lVhy is he osking me this?" You were thinking obout it the other
doy, tho/s why you're osking obout it.
THE DESCRIPTION. "lt's like the possion iust builds in you ond you feel
it so intensely in your heorl." You describe whot you wont her to experi-
ence so she hos to go inside ond experience thot description, ot leost o
little bit. This olso guides her into the kind of onswer you're looking for.
THE aUESTION. "l'd be curious to know, whot mokes your heorl fluF
ter? Whofs on exomple in your life of thot?" Now she knows why you
osked, she's felt the feeling o little bit ond she's more likely to give you
the kind of emotionol, romoniic onswer you're looking for.

Once ogoin, you wouldn't iusl dump this question on someone withoul
preporolion.
You might soy: "l wos tolking to some friends the other night over din-
ner ond we were tolking obout the feeling of when you meet someone
ond feel like you've known them before. One person wos reolly into the
post-life thing, ond I wosn'f sure whot to think obout thot. l've certoinly
hod those experiences where you meel someone ond you look ot them
ond you feel like you've known them before. lt's like you're meeting them
ogoin, rother thon for the first time. Do you know whot I meon? So, l'd
be curious to know, if you'd be willing to shore obout it, hove you ever
mel someone ond felt like you've met them before?"
Le/s breok it oport:
THE EXCUSE. "lwqs tolking to some friends the o$er night over din-
ner ond we were tolking obout the feeling of when you meel someone
ond feel like you've known them before." You were tolking obout it with
friends the other night, so lhere's o reoson it's on your mind.
THE DESCRIPTION. "One person wos reolly into the post-life thing,
ond I wosn't sure whot to think obout thol. l've certoinly hod those expe-
riences where you meet someone ond you look ot them ond you feel like
you've known them before. l/s like you're meeling $em ogoin, rother
thon for the first lime." This description is greot becouse it runs o little
visuolizotion on her ond reolly points o word picture of the kind of feel-
ing you wont her to experience os she looks ot you. lt will olso guide her
in selecting the kind of onswer you're looking for.

T H E OU ESTIO N. "Hove you ever met someone ond felt like you've met
them before?" When you put it this woy it doesn't sound like o corny
pickup line, which it would if you osked it stroight out. Asking in this woy
gives her the opportunity to shore obout herself ond her experiences of
feeling o reol conneclion when first meeting someone-ond to look ot
you while she describes, ond feels, those feelings.

THE ROMANTIC QUESTION: 'lVhotwos it like the first time you hod

This question osked by itself sounds ridiculous.
But let's odd on excuse ond description ond see how it sounds: "l wos

We were looking bock on high school ond tolking obout first loves ond

There is o moment when your longues first entwine. lt's oll so omozing.

This is obviously o more intense question thon the o$ers. You ore bring-

Here ore some of $e most common questions men hove obod using
Romontic Questions.
QUESTION: How intimote should the questions be?
ANSWER: As you've no doubt noticed, the questions vory in intensity
from relotively low-risk questions like 'lVho/s o speciol ploce you
enjoy going to for vocotion?" lo relotively high-risk questions like
'lVho/s your fovorite moment in o kiss?" As you leorn to impro-
vise these questions, you'll come up with ones thot ore even milder
ond others thot ore even riskier. You decide how intimote o ques-
lion to osk by ossessing two things: how things ore going with the
womon ond the level of risk you wont to toke.
Mosl of the time, you'll wont to stort with the lower-risk questions,
ond, os thot goes well, move up to the higher-risk questions. lf
you're feeling especiolly bollsy, you con move up to the higher-risk
queslions foster. lf you osk them with o sense of certointy thot
evefihing is okoy then things will probobly go fine.
You con tell thot you qre risking too much if you find yourself leov-
ing out the excuse ond description ports of the Romoniic Question.
When guys get tense, lhey tend to leove out the excuse ond the
description ond iust go to the question. lf thot hoppens lo you, you
need to slow down, loke some deep breoths ond osk o lower-risk
querlion.

Q: Whot should I do if she osks me the Romontic Question bock?
A: This hoppens oll the time, ond you should be reody for it. For
instonce, if you osk o womon, 'Whol is your ideo of o reolly
romqnlic dote?" ond she onswers you ond osks you the some
question bock, you need to onswer her. Simply describe o dote
thot sounds reolly romontic lo you. There's no big trick to it; iust
tolk obout o situotion thot sounds romontic to you. lf you con use
your words to point o picture for the two of you trcgether, fiot's
good. lf your description is similor to her ideo of o romonilc dole,
even better.
Obviously, you will wont lo speok from the romoncer porl of your-
self when you onswer this question. lf she describes her ideol
romonlic dote os on evening by the seoshore, iust her ond her
lover eoting lobster ond drinking fine wine, you won't wont to
respond by telling her thot your ideol romontic dote is on evening
drinking beer ot the demolition derby followed by o night of hot
sex with your fovorile Penthouse centerfold. Get into the spirit of $e
thing ond describe something romontic thot she would olso enioy.
Won't showing my romonlic interesl be emborrossing for us both?
It's true thot if you use Romonlic Questions properly she'll know
you're interested in her romonticolly. However, becouse yov're
opprooching the seduction in such o romontic, nonslimy woy, she
is very likely to think thot your desire for her is o veqy good thing
rofier thon o creepy thing she needs to get owoy from.
Asking Romontic Queslions is olso greot becouse you con slort
with the less risky, less obvious ones ond work your woy up to the
Q:
n$milnsie 0u8stil,0s, pa$ I
more intense ones. lf she bolks on the less risky ones ond seems
uncomfortoble, you know not lo go on to the more intense ques-
tions until you get better resuhs with those less risky questions. ln
this woy you con find out her level of interest strep by step without
risking moking things reolly weird for you both by osking some-
thing too inlense out of the blue.
Q: How often should I osk Romontic Questions during on
with o womqn?
You'll see exomples of how we use Romonlic Questions in the
diologs lhot ore coming up in this book, but the short onswer is
this: pepper them in. Romontic Queslions ore not the sole focus of
your discussion. You tolk oboul the weother, lhe news, you do
some of the Flirting Moves, osk her obout her iob ond throw in
Romontic Queslions. lf you pepper them in, it will feel noturol.
Asking loo mony Romontic Quesfions is not the problem most of
our students hove. The first problem most of our students hove is
not osking Romqntic Questions ot oll. The second problem most of
our students hove is dropping out the excuse ond the description
ond iust osking $e question port of the Romontic Question. The
lost ond certoinly the leost problem our students hove is osking too
mony Romontic Questions.
Hoving soid thot, it will probobly feel owkword the first few fimes
you osk one of these questions. As you proctice, you moy leove
some intreroctions with women feeling os if you osked too mony
Romontic Questions or worrying thot you overwhelmed her with

'lt!$J 
&il Tal|{ ls l{ems}}
them. Thofls okoy; ifs port of the leorning process. Overdoing it
once or twice is involuoble to your leorning how to use Romonlic
Queslions. And don't worry*if won't hurt her if you osk "too
mony'' Romontic Questions. She's mode of tougher stuff thon thot.
How should I get storted with Romontic Questions?
Firsl, choose one or two Romontic Questions ond leqrn them by
heort. Remember, thol meons you hove to leorn oll three ports of
lhe queslion: the excuse, the description ond the question itself.
Second, proclice speoking the entire Romontic Question out loud.
When you're olone ol home or in your cor or getting reody to go
to work in the morning, speok your Romontic Questions. This gets
your body used to soying the questions-which is of course whot
you ore going to end up doing. When you ore in front of o
womon, it does you no good to be greot ot soying the Romontic
Question silently in your own mind. You need to be qble to speok
lhe question, ond thot is why you proctice it out loud.
Third, try it out with o womon. Perhops you meet o womon ot o
coffee shop ond you've soid hi, done some of the Flirting Moves
like smiling, holding eye contoct ond winking ot her, oll perhops in
the contexl of doing some Situolionol Flirting. Perhops you've
osked her 'lVhot's the story behind thot?" obout her neckloce ond
thot's generoted some shoring conversotions. Things ore going
well. Then osk your Romontic Question. Moke your excuse, give
your description ond osk owoy. Voild!
Q:

Should I leorn these questions by heo* or improvise them on the
spot?
At firsl you will wonl to leorn one or two Romontic Questions by

tions ond romontic feelings thoi they spork.
As you get more experience, you'll find thot i/s noturol to improvise
the queslions or ports of the questions. At first you will probobly find
it is most nofurol ic improvise new excuses ond descriptions lo go

oble trc improvise the questions lco. As you relox more with o

versotions we ore smiling ond our voices ore friendly. Sometimes in
these diologs we moy soy things thot would seem confrontotionol if they
were soid in on ongry or horsh monner. But they're fine here becouse
our monner is light ond ployful. For instonce, ot one point Ron soys lc o
womon, "So you con relote lo lhe women who wos morried, yet she wos
sleeping with somebody else?" As you'll see in the diolog below, the
womon Ron wos tolking to didnt toke whot he sqid the wrong woy. Thot
wos becouse he wos smiling, they were hoving o good time together
ond it wqs cleqr to her thot he wos joking with her, not insulting her.

RON: lwos tolking lo some friends of mine lost night obout this ond
we were wondering. Somelimes it seems like o dote is reolly going
greol, there's greot flow ond things seem to reolly be cooking ond
you feel incredibly speciol. So I wqs wondering: whot is it like
when you feelvery speciol on o dote?
TERRI: When I om fie focus, when I om included in the conversolion.
I wos iust on o dote lost week ond it wos wonderful becouse the
gentlemon leoned forwqrd on the loble when he wos tolking to me
ond I knew there wos inlerest. lt wos very cleor.
RON: Okoy, cool. So you ore the kind of women who likes it when o
guy tokes chorge of the conversotion yet includes you?
TERRI: Oh yes, obsolutely.
RON: So you wont him to soy things like'You look beoutiful" or "You
know I con'l woil Io," you know, or "l would love to kiss you"?
Thot sort of thing?
TERRI: Yes, the otlention ond the openness. lwonl men who don't iust
queslion me but who ore willing to shore obout themselves too.
Lefs breok in here ond toke o look ol our story so [or. Ron is reolly doing
well wiih Terri. He got the question out ond she is reolly giving him some
informotion. As you reod this you should be osking yourself: whot is
Terri reveoling obout herself thot might help in the seduclion? Ron hos
leorned thot she is reolly turned on by o guy leoning forword on the
toble, so he puts thot doto point into his mind ond he'll use thot loter.
He'll leon forword ond show interest os soon os he con.

Do you hove ony questions for me?

To be with you. Why else would I be here?
TERRI: Bul we iust metl
RON: Well, I believe thot things hoppen for o reqson. Don't you think

ting, moybe we could tolk ogoin. I would love to coll you ond go
out for coffee ond iust hove the fun continue becouse I would hote
for this lo be o one-time thing.

Lefls teor oport the second holf of this interoction. She soys she wonls
guys who will shore obout themselves, so he osks her "Do you hove ony
questions for me?" to show her thot he is open to shoring obout himself.
She come bock with o silly question, 'lVhol ore you doing here?" Very
often, when o womon does something like this, i/s qn invitqtion to be
silly, on invitotion to ploy together in some woy. Ron picked up on thot
ond wos oble to ploy with whot she soid. He mode o ioke ond it went
over well. He wos willing to iust open up his mouth ond soy whqtever
come oul ond hove it be oll right. Remember whot we've soid before:
women ore looking to you lo see how well the inleroclion is going. lf you
seem confident obout it, if you seem ploful ond if you don't seem wor-
ried, then most of the time she is going to be okoy too.
RON: ln lhe end, it seemed reolly noturol to osk for the phone number. I
meon, il wos true-we were hwing o good time ond I did wont to
get trc know her better so I osked her if she would like to go out. lt
wosn't forced. lt felt noturol.
So often our students worry loo much during flirting interoctions. They
seem lo think, '1vell, I wqnt to do it perfectly, so every word needs to
line up with every other word ond it hos to be exoctly right."
Thot simply isn't lrue. As you reod fiese flirting inlerocfions, we hope
you're storting to understond thot flirting is nol o motler of "doing it per-
fectly." ll's o motter of showing up, risking, being curious, committing
yourself to being o source of certointy thot it's going to be okoy ond hov-
ing some fun with it. You'll see ogoin ond ogoin thot we hoven'l rewrit-

ten these flirting diologs to moke them letter-perfect becouse thofs not
how life is, ond you shouldn't get the ideo fiqt it ever goes perfectly.
You'll see thot ifs not necessory for Romontic Conversotions to be per-
fect for flirting ond seduclion lo work. As you proctice you'll hove more
fun ond you will be o lot more seductive.

ln this exomple, Ron is going to tolk to Terri ogoin. ln this conversotion,
he's going to osk the Romonlic Question 'tVhot kind of odventure would
be fun?" Notice how this question opens her up. lt is not necessorily
something thot is going to moke her melt with romontic feelings, like o
question obout her mosi romontic dote might, but it is olso low-risk ond
effective. Here it is:
It sounds like you olso volue fun.
TERRI: Yes.
RON: l've been thinking obout the ploces thot I like to go for odven-
tures. You know-the kind of ploces where you con go ond it's
reolly speciol, fun, exciting ond owoy from your normol doily life.
So if I wos toking you oul whot kind of on odventure would be
reolly fun for you? Would it be o doy trip together?
TERRI: Yes, o doy trip outside or o drive somewhere in the country or
o hike in some woods, somewhere there is o nice view, you know?

TERRI: l've hiked in Howoii ond Alqsko but most of my hiking hos
been in Wisconsin. There ore no mounloins here.
RON: So troveling is o greol possion of yours, is it? Like seeing new
ploces ond going to new exciting outdoor ploces, like in Alosko?
TERRI: Yes, I spenl three weeks in Alosko.
RON: Wow whotwos thqt like?

of the stote. I took q troin from Anchoroge to Foirbonks ond thot
wos o wonderful experience, iusl seeing the middle of the wilder-

RON: I don't get to meet o lot of women who ore such serious go-geF

you ore oble to go on these fun odventures, you know?
TERRI: lt is fun, I do like thot.
Le/s iump in here ogoin ond tolk obout how Ron is doing, flirting with
Terri. Ron is reolly curious, ond his curiosity reolly helps guide him in the
conversolion ond helps the conversotion unfold eosily. For instonce,
when Terri tolks obout her trip to Alosko, Ron gets curious ond osks,
'lVhot wos thot like?" Thqt gives her more opportunity to shore obout
something she cores obout. Ron then compliments her by telling her thot
he doesn'l get to meet women like her very often ond telling her fiot he

RON: The other thing thot I keep osking myself is'lVhot trcpic hos the
iuice?" lt doesn't motter if I om not interested in Alosko or if I om not
interested in troveling; i/s whot lights her up, il's whot gets her going
on something she is possionob oboul. Therefore i/s importont trc
me. And if it reolly does light her up, it will ultimotely get me inter-
ested, even if l'm not interested d the stort.
Let's look ot the rest of this conversotion. Notice how Ron hos fun with
Terri ond iokes oround with her.
TERRI: Howoiiwos onoiher fovorite spot of mine. Hiking olong the
coost, you come ocross o sign thot soys, 'Tidol wove level, stoy
obove this sign." And you hope thot lhere's no tidol wove coming.
RON: Thot sounds pretty odventuresome. Are you telling me thot
behind thot pretty foce of yours is this hellcot, doredevil womon?
TERRI: [Loughs]Well, I om nol o doredevil. I do worry obout life ond

Notice how Ron risked reiection, but in o context in which o reiection
would most likely not hove been personol or horsh. lf the womon wos-
n'i inlerested in him romonticolly, she could very eosily hove simply
given o tepid onswer to Ron's remorks obout being in the bedroom with

it wouldn't hove even been o blonket reiection of him. lt iust would hove
been onother piece of informotion obout her; onother port of lhe conver-

iust kind of curious obout your thoughts obout your ideql vocotion.
HEATHER: I reolly like to trovel. lwent to lrelond obout o yeor ogo,
ond thot wos pretty much the ideol vocotion. I went with o couple
of friends ond il wos o reolly greot trip. We didn't plon things
out-insteod of hoving this huge itinerory we just did whot we
wonted when we wonted to. Thott whot I like to do when I om
troveling. I don't like to hove lo be somewhere ot o certoin lime,
thol's how things ore in my life ot home. So it is reolly nice to be
oble to lust stoy somewhere if you like il or leove if you don't.
DAVID: I bet you get to hove experiences thot woy thot you would not
otherwise hove. You get lo see things thot normol tourists would
not gel to see.
HEATHER: Yes. lthink my ideolvocolion is obout hoving some time to
rest qnd meeting new people ond getting o feel for the culture wher-
ever I om. lfls obout seeing the countryside, hiking, wolking.
Lel's iump in o second. Dovid is doing some cool stuff with this womon
ond it's working. First, he found out where her ideol vocoiion wos. Once
he hod thot he storted osking her obout the best moment on thot voco-
tion, the one momenl when she felt most speciol ond omozed qnd when
n
uU0l,Iut0illlHfflnHn,tll

llsn tslilllrlslfilms'l
she felt like her life wos obsolutely ot its best. He let himself get curious
ond osk follow-up questions. You con see how thot is helping the whole
conversotion unfold in on interesting monner.
We should mention here $ot "fovorite vocotion" is not o very risky
Romontic Question in thol it does not oulomoticolly let her know you ore
romonticolly inlerested in her in the woy thot o question like 'tVhot is
your ideo of o perfect romontic dole?" would. Thot's okoy, becouse this
Romontic Question does nol exist in o void. Along wi$ the Romontic
Queslion, Dwid is doing the Flirting Moves. Also, he will osk her other
Romontic Questions ihot build in intensity ond riskiness qs his interoc-
tions with her unfold.
Dovid is olso getting lots of informotion obout her. He's leorning how she
likes to relox she doesn't like regimented reloxotion; she likes to be oble
to hong oul ond be spontoneous. This informotion will be helpful to him
when he storts designing their Seduction Dote: he'll be sure lo set up o
dote where she hos oplions ond where they con "follow lheir noses"
rqther thon one thot is more tightly regimented or slructured. (You con
reod more obout seduction dotes in our book How lo Succeed wilh
Women, ond in our other products.)
Le/s get bock to their conversotion.
DAVID: Wos there one ploce thot you wenl to where you thought
something like 'Vow this is so speciol, this is so omozing"? Or
wos there one experience you hod, moybe sitting on the beoch,
where you felt like 'Vow, I om herel This is my life, this is omoz-
ing." Moybe it wos someone you met, I don'l know.
*0tllan&il! tll8$ui0ns. pa$! ?
HEATHER: I think itwos when we were hiking oround in o notionol
forest. lt wos reolly beoutiful. lt wos hord to believe I wos reolly
there. I kept telling myself thot I wos in lrelond. lt wos reolly mogi-
col ond beoutiful. There were woterfolls ond rolling hills ond o
loke ond it wos reolly beoutiful.
And onother time wos when we were neor o little town ond we
were driving olong the coostline on this norrow little di* rood, it is
iusl o reolly bizorre driving experience. We reoched o ploce
where the whole rood wos token up by o lorge herd of cottle.
DAVID: Wow.
HEATHER: I guess fiey regulorly do thot, move lhem from one port of
the field to onother.
DAVID: So they were iusl honging out in the rood?
HEATHER: I guess thot wos the only woy. There wos this little boy with
o stick trying to get them in line ond trying to get them lo turn the
corner lo go on this other rood ond it wos iust veqy memoroble.
Thot would never hoppen oround here, ond it wos iust o reolly
funny experience.
DAVID: Yes, wow. Thot sounds greot, like one of those simple, perfect
momenis you'll remember forever ond olwoys feel good obout. I
often think obout those moments when you feel like you reolly
hove lived life. You know, those moments thot loter in your life you
look bock on ond you qre reolly hoppy thot you took the opportu-
nity thot come your woy. lt sounds like you ore pretty hoppy you
ftcok thot opportunity to go on thot trip ond to find out whot there

wos in it for you. So whot obout your future? Are there ploces thot
you fontosize oboul going to thot reolly turn you on to think obout?
Let's breok in ogoin. Dovid found out obout her post fovorite vocolion,
which led to her shoring o simple, wonderful momenl thot she will
olwoys remember. Now Dovid's curiosity hqs token him in the direction
of the future.
HEATHER: I hove olwoys wonted to go to Novo Scotio. I reolly don't
know o lot obout it but l'm interested in the music l've heord from
thol region, ond I understond thot o lot of people who live there
hove Scottish oncestors.
DAVID: Oh, wow.
HEATHER: And I hove heord thot the counlryside is reolly beoutiful
ond thot the music is greol. Like I soid before, one of the best
things obout troveling is meeting people who ore there.
DAVID: I con tellyou ore someone who reolly cores obout connecting
with people, moking reql connections. I find thot reolly ottroclive,
so thot is reolly o cool thing.
Dovid ended by odmiring something obout her-thot she reolly cores
obout moking reol connections, which hoppens to be true, ond by telling
her thot he found thot ottroctive, which olso hoppens to be true. ln this
woy he mode the Romontic Question even more romontic by finding her
interest, odmiring it ond telling her $d becouse of it she's the kind of
womon lo whom he's ottrocted. These lost moves took the whole inter-
oction to o more personol level.

Now we're going to heor Ron tolk to Terri ond osk her some more
Romontic Questions. You'll notice thot ot the beginning he gives the
excuse ond the queslion, but not the description. The reoson for thot is
thot he is in the flow with her ond the conversotion, so there is some flex-
ibility. Until you get good ot it, you reolly should do oll three ports of the
Romonlic Question.
Also, notice thot Ron uses the queslion "Do you believe in love ot first
sight?" Wqtch corefully how he does thot, becouse, os you probobly
know, if you go up to o womqn in o bor ond soy, "Hey boby, do you
believe in love ot first sight?" you will probobly get nothing more from
her thon o drink thrown in your foce. But if you structure it properly, the
woy he does it here, you con reolly gel o conversolion going. He does-
n't leod with thot question but builds up to it, so it seems quite noturol.
RON: You know, I wos tolking to o friend of mine ond we were tolking
obout different times she hos been in love ond whot it wos like,
ond so I would be curious to know whot ore times in your life
when you suddenly felt like you knew you were in love?
TERRI: Oh wow, how mony do you wont to know obout?
RON: I iust wont to know oboul one or two. I con recoll whot it wos
like when you soy trc yourself, 'This person is greo/' ond you love
being with hem ond it is olmost like the world becomes o rosy picture.

TERRI: Right, 'This person is perfed." The chemisiry is there, the com-
mon interests ore there, the wit ond wormth ond ployfulness ore
there. The ployfulness is importont, so lhose things come together,
ond so you soy, "This is it, this is greol."
RON: So it is greot.
TERRI: You iust go oround ond gush.
RON: Do you believe in love ot first sight? ls thot possible?
TERRI: Oh yes.
RON: ls it hoppening right now, os we speok?
TERRI: [Loughs] l'm nol going to tell you thot!
RON: Whqt ore the secrets? Does it hoppen to you, love ol first sight
or lust ot first sight?
TERRI: Lust ol first sight, yes, love ot first sight, no. lt might loke o cou-
ple of sights, though.
RON: A couple of moments?
TERRI: Yes, pretty quickly, usuolly in o few doys.

This time, Ron is tolking to Terri ond he is going tc osk her obout romon-
tic evenings trcgether. One thing to notice is how he brings the things she
soys bock to his relotionship with her ond iS inevitoble success by soying
things like 'You ore giving me lors of good tips on where I con loke you'"
&smafiti8 &uGsais|l$" p8f$ tr
RON: lwould be curious, whot ore some of the best first dotes you've
ever been on? When you meel someone ond it is going greot ond
you might meet for coffee-like we might be doing soon-ond
fiings ore good ond then you go out on o more romontic dole.
Whot qre some romqntic dotes you con recoll thot went greot?
TERRI: Storting out with dinner ond iust wolking oround, moybe
downtown, ond seeing the night sky from vorious ploces, sorf of
checking out whofs here, whofs there, whot new clubs ore there.
Just kind of exploring together. Then wolking bock to the cor ond
thinking, "l don't wont lo go home" ond he soys lo me, "Do you
wont lo go home yet?" ond I soy, "No, not me." Jusl continuing,
finding o quiet ploce... Going to eoch club, opening the door, soy-
ing, "No, too loud," closing the door ond moving on to the next
one. Jusl not wonling the evening to end, iust being together, iust
tolking ond wolking.
RON: So whot is it qbout thot thot is so omozing to you? You were
together wolking oround, ond whot is it obout thot thot is so
romqntic or sensuol to you?
TERRI: Just the wonting to stoy together, wonting to know more obout
the other person to sort of groduolly getting closer, iust sort of
bumping into eoch other iust sod of holding honds, iust step by
step, physicolly getting o llt bit closer, leorning more ond more
ond being ouldoors too, iust enioying the night sky ond enjoying
the sights ond sounds together. lf you were in some exotic ploce,
you would probobly lose your focus, I think, on the other person.

RON: So you ore giving me o lot of good tips on where I con toke
you, is thot whot you ore telling me?
TERRI: Right.
This womon gove Ron q lot of informotion when he osked obout her
ideol romontic dote, ond he got curious ond wonted to boil it down to
the bottom line. So he osked her, "So whot is it obout thot thot is so
omozing Ioyov?" And thot deepened her even more into the beling she
liked so much.
h's worth noting thot you con use the question 'nVhot is it obout thot?"
ony time o womon is describing on experience thot she enioyed' She
enioys going from club to club, iust wolking oround with o guy? Asking
'tVhot is it obout thot thol wos so greot?" will help her focus even more
on those feelings you wont her to be hoving with you.
lf you listen lo o womon's onswers to your Romontic Queslions, she will
often outline whot her ideol dote is. You will then use thot informolion
when you construcl o seduction dote with her. ln this cose, Terry is telling
Ron thot one thing thot might moke her hoppy is wolking oround down-
town, holding honds ond exploring. He's creoled o connection with her,
creoted some romontic feelings ond discovered o potentiol plon for
seducing her. Greot!

DAVID: I wos tolking to o friend of mine recently obout kissing. We
were wolching on old movie on W where there wos o lot of kiss-
ing going on ond we gol inlo o conversotion obout the whole lost
ort of kissing. You know, people dont think obout thot enough.
Oh, logree.
DAVID: I like everything thot your normol guy likes, but sometimes I
ihink I like kissing more thon your overoge guy does.
SUE: Oh, thofs greot.
DAVID: I wqs thinking obout
whot is your fovorite
moment in o kiss? There ore so mony different stoges to o kiss,
you know? Like you ore oboul to kiss, then you stqrt to kiss, then
you ore reolly inio the kiss, then there's the first momenl your
tongues touch... And you could be kissing someone ond the world
iust seems to stop, you know? So whot is your fovorite moment in
o kiss?
SU E: I just love thot very first instont when your lips come together.
There is nothing like it. lt gels good ofbr thot too. But you know,
you ore seporole, you ore seporole, you ore seporote, then you
get closer, closer, closer, you know you ore going to kiss ond then
you know the lips touch. Oh, to me thofs iust sensotionol.
DAVID: Hove you ever hod one of those times where you ore obout to
kiss somebody ond i/s winler ond there's stotic electicity ond there
il o littlc rpork from your lips to theirs, right before your kiss?

SUE: [Loughs] I think thot hos hoppened. But I think it wos his broces.
DAVID: Thot moment iust before it hoppens is my fovorite momenl
too, I think.
SUE: Yes, iust the very inslonl when your lips first touch.
DAVID: Especiolly for the first time with someone ond you reolly like
them ond you reolly trust them.
S U E: Especiolly if they know how to kiss. I meon, I hove been out with
men thd hove been morried ond do not know how to kiss.
Things ore going greot. She's responsive to the question, so thofs reolly
greol news, ond she's getting used to shoring on this level obout such
intimote topics ond hoving if be o good time.
We'll tolk more loter obout the first kiss, but for now, notice how this
Romontic Question could leod to o first-kiss situotion. As they shore
more deeply obout kissing, ond os the vibe becomes more intimote, it
would be o simple motter for Dovid to leon over ond soy something like
'lVhot o greot ideq, I think l'll kiss you right nov/' ond do it.
DAVID: So how do you kiss? Whot would your odvice be for me?
Le/s soy you ond I ore kissing, hypotheticolly, ond if we got to
know eoch other thot woy, whot would be o good kiss?
SUE: Well, I don't like o first kiss where your mouth is honging com-
pletely open. Thot is iust too much bo soon. Thot is iust gross.
Your lips should be iust slightly ported, ond your lips need to be
very reloxed ond flexible. When you touch eoch other's lips, you
*0m8fi&i8 $llaslii$ll$, $ilf$ I
should try to moke the whole lip touch their whole lip. And then
you con just slightly move your lips, like o gentle mossoging kind
of movement, so you ore reolly using your lips like fingers. You
know, you ore reolly filling up the person's lips with your lips, if
you con imogine.
DAVID: I con imoginetyou ore moking me wont to try thot out, proc-
lice my kissing.
This is o spot where octuolly toking thot first kiss would be o fine thing
lo do. Dovid could leon ocross ond soy, 'You meon, something like
this?" ond kiss her exoctly os she described.

QUESTION: Hey guys-l iusl wonled to osk how lo close the deol
with o girl. After tolking trc them br o while I still hove trouble get-
ting their numbers or osking them out on dotes. I would oppreciote
your odvice.
ANSWER: This is simpler thon you might think. After chotting with o
womon for o while ond doing some of the flirting moves so she
knows yov're interested, you simply sey, "Hey, you seem cool.
Whot would it be like if we went out for o cup of coffee sometime?
Could I hove your emoil oddress or phone number?" lf she soys
yes, try lo set up the dote right then.

Mony o successful dote lives or dies on how you use the phone. You'll

her emoil oddress!
I reolly like this girl in school (we ore both in college). I think she is
responsive whenever I tolk with her ond I don't think she hos o
boyfriend. I got her number ond she soid I could coll her, bul l've
cqlled severol times ond she hosn't colled bock. Whot should I do?
Should I leove her olone?
When o womon doesn't coll you bock, it does nol meon thol she
isn't inlerested in you. Never expecl o womon to coll you bock,
Q:
la$ins &lllills f*tfiIer
especiolly ol the beginning of your seduction of her. Shocking os it
moy seem, o womon who is interested in you willvery likely not
coll bock. Of course, neither will o womon who is not interested,
so you jusl con't use collbock frequency os o meosure of how
much she likes you.
So when should you coll her? When you wont to. But don't keep
lewing messoges-simply coll. lf she onswers, greol, but only leove
o messoge once in o while. lf ofter the third messoge she hosn't
colled you bock, she's not interested, ond tho/s too bod. Time trc
move on.
Sodly, the phone con become o reol stumbling block. Don't worry
fiot she might think you ore weird for colling-remembe6 she's
looking lo you to see whether or not she should bel weird obout
things. lf you don't think ifs weird to coll her, odds ore she won't,
either.
This problem points tro the imporlcnce of getting her emoil oddress.
Set up the dote vio emoil or o combinotion of emoil ond telephone
ond you'll be woy oheod of the gome.
How do I deolwifi onswering mochines when trying to set up o
time ond dote for the Priming Dote? I hote to keep colling, trying
to cotch her in person, especiolly becouse Cqller lD ond *69 con
moke it sooo eosy to find oui who iust colled you.

qreo to oreo, but it's often occomplished by dioling *62, ihen the
number-coller lD shows you os "Privote Number." Diol *62, then
the number. lf you get the mochine, hong up. Check your phone
book before trying this; *67 moy nol work in oll oreos.
Of course, fiis doesn't meon you shouldn't ever leove o messoge.
Just don't leove more thon three of them. And how you do this
depends o lot on how hot o leod the womon is. lf you hove greot
ropport with her qnd hove flirted wirh her mony times ond ifs pretty
cleor she's iust being scotterbroined, you con soy something like "l
hove trc tellyou, I hove o policy. I don't meon irc be meon, but I cqn't
leqve more thon three messoges wifiout getting o coll bock. lf you
don't get bock to me, I won'l be oble to coll you for o long time. I
like you ond you seem like o greol womon, but thofs iust whofs up.
Anylvoy, my number is..." This isn't heovy; you're not yelling ot
her...iust telling her the woy it is. You oren't upset, iust strrting the
focts.
lf she doesn't return your colls ofter three messoges, we think she's
probobly not intere$ed. lf you see her, don't mention the colls-do
not confront her obout itl Flirt with her more ond try to set up o dote

Q: Since I begon studying How to Succeed with Women obout o yeor
ond o holf ogo/ over ond over ogoin, l've become exlremely suc-
cessful. l've reoched the point where I con get olmost ony single
womon's phone number ond I now hove o high success role o[
hoving sex on doles.
nftinrfiilltins ftrmsr
However, the big snog l'm hitting lotely is ofter getling the girl's
number. l've hod obout l0 girls over the post monfh who seem
veqy ollrocted to me give up the phone number, ihen either never
coll bock or moke up stupid excuses to not go out. l'm used to
hoving ot leost three dotes per week ond l've hod none for severol
weeks now so it's frustroting.
You certoinly ore hoving some solid success, ond thot is greol.
Whot you ore bumping up ogoinst is o very common pottern
we've noliced with our sfudents: success ond foilure seem to come
in woves. Thot's port of the seduction life. By woves, we meon thot
there seem to be trends in doting thqt ore outside of your control,
bosed in some sort of rqndomness or luck. And it's weird: some-
times every womon colls bock-somelimes none do. Somelimes
every womon you dote wqnts lo sleep with you. Sometimes there
ore periods of no sex. Somelimes every womon you interoct with
is q blonde. Sometimes they oll seem to be schoolteochers.
Stronge though these trends moy seem, they ore normol. And in
time, the trends olwoys furn.
ln the meontime, here ore some other pointers we invite you to refed on:
How long do you woit to coll the womon ofter you get the num-
ber? Perhops you ore woiting too long to coll ond set up the dote.
Moybe you should try to tie down the dote ot the some time you
get the phone number.
Are you octively doing the three-step reiection process when things
don't work oul or ore you getting demorolized?

heor o certoin number of nos before you get o yes, so this is one more
no you won'l hove to heor ogoin on your woy to the inevitqble yes from
someone else.
2. Chonge your interpretotion of why she reiected you from something
thot hqs to do with you lo something thot hos to do with her or with life.
"l guess she didn't heor me." "Looks like she's wropped up in her own
world." "Perhops her dog iust died." Remembe4 iusl becouse on explo-
notion is poinful doesn'l meon you hove to believe it. Find on explono-
tion thot is not poinful for you ond proctice believing thot.
3. Redirect your ottention fo something else. Don't dwell in the reiec-
tion-find something else-onyhing else*ond letyourself get obsorbed
in it.
lf they don't coll you bock, do you then ossume they ore not intrer-
ested ond not coll them ogoin? We recommend thot you expecl
them not to coll you bock qnd thot you coll o number of times-
soy, three times-before you give up on them. With eoch coll, oct

womqn obout nol colling you bock.
Do you ever gel their emoil oddresses? This mighr be o more efbc-

When is o good time to stort sending romontic letters viq emoil? I
hove known this girl for qbout two weeks. Extremely hot. I hove to
shoke guys' honds everywhere I go just becouse they hove seen
me with her. I don't wont to push it too fost with the romontic tolk,
but I olso wont her to think romonticolly obout me. I olso hove her
home oddress if you would like to odd onything there...
Good work on the first steps-going out with o womon you find
ottroctive. Now for $e nexl step-turning mindless honging out
into somelhing romontic ond sexuol.
You don't soy much obout your relotionship now. Whofs it like?
Are you kissing? Moking out? Hoving sex? Heck, ore you even
holding honds? Does she know you ore not iust o friend? This stuff
is importont.
Since you ore relucicnl to mqke romontic trrlk with her, we con
deduce thot you ore probobly not hwing sex with her. You must
stort showing your romontic interesl in her. You must be compliment-
ing her, for one thing. lf you ore noi complimenting her os o womon
or showing your romontic interest ihen you ore reolly in trouble-
she moy be thinking of you os q friend olreod.
Emoil is greot becouse it gives you the opportunity to soy things,
especiolly romontic things, thot you might not normolly hove the
nerve trc soy lo o womon. lt gives you on opporfunity lo run "visuol-
izolionr' on her. Rememberi when you describe something trc some-

one, she hos to go inside ond imogine whot you ore describing iust
to be oble to trock with whot you ore tolking obout. lf I describe o
cow you hqve lo imogine it. By the some bken, if you describe on
experience trc someone, she hos to go inside ond imogine hwing
rhot experience in order to understond whot you ore tolking obout.
So you wqnt to writre emoils thot describe wonderful feelings of love
ond romonce tc the womon of your dreoms. This will gei her in the
right stote of mind for your nexl move.
We suggest love poems. Seorch online or go to o bookstrore or
librory ond look under love poetry. Write her emoils thot soy things
like "l sow this poem ond it mode me think of you. I thought l'd
shore it." Then enclose the poem. Feel free lo use the some Poem on
o number of women, iust so long os they don't know eoch other.
ln your siluotion, romontic emoils should be port of your
opprooch. You should be showing your romontic interest ond tok-
ing her on o Seduction Dote. You should hove on outcome in mind
for eoch dote-kissing her? hoving sex? Be sure to pursue other
women-don't let her be your one-ond-only hope-ond be willing
to risk finding out whot she thinks of you. lf you hoven't kissed her
yet, you should soon. Whotever you do, don't let this thing remoin
"moybe friends, moybe potentiol lovers." Be the mon, push the siF
uotion ond find out.

You've heord the soying "God is in the detoils"? Well, so is sex, os
it turns out. lf you con bring exquisite, detoiled ottention to even o
tiny port of her body, she'll go nuts for more. The mistoke most
men moke is they wont to move on to something big*ond fost. To
odvonce from hond-holding to something more, you hqve to focus
on being smollond slow
This meons slowly coressing the polm of her hond or ftcuching your
fingertips fic hers ond reolly bringing your ottenlion trr the beling of
the sensolion. Or you might iust lightly stroke the inside of her wrist.
You do this to drow her ottention ic the subtleties of the ficuch you
ore shoring. Also, toke your time with it. Most of our students ore
ofroid thot if they don't rush sexuol inbroctions, sex will never hop-
pen. But it turns out the opposite is lrue. lf you show thot you ore
reolly willing fic give her detqiled, ottrentive touching ond thot you
oren't pushing things, it will very often drow her towords you. Also,
if you ore willing trc show thot you hove some foith thqt sex will hop-
pen-you show this by not pushing things too hord, or too fost-
you will be very oltroclive b her. You won't be like oll the bone-
heoded guys who either ore friends becquse they show no intrerest
ot oll or ore ierks becouse they try trc push her into sex.

Commenling on the energy drqws her otlenlion to it without it seem-

you now."
Commenting on ihe energy is olso o greot lesl ic see whether she is
reody for rhe first kiss or not. lf she soys, "Eh, I don't feel much ener-
gy," then you know to not bother trying to kiss her' lf she soys, 'Yes,

then you know to bock off for o while until she is comfortoble. Often
women will pose some sort of problem ot fiis point ic see how you

ls it possible to turn o womon from o friend into o lover even if

Yes, it is possible to turn o womon from o friend to o lover if you
know whot to do-but even then it won't work every time. Some
women keep you os o friend becouse you've been too scored to
moke your romonlic inlerest known or becouse you've mode o

One mon we know did thls with o womon he wos interested in. She
hod doted him o few times, then decided they should be iust friends.
("1'm very excited," she trcld him. "l'm excited you ore going trc be

onolher womon. ln thot ploce of sexuol obundonce, he wos oble to

He told us, "She colled to lell me she'd be trco busy trc see me for o

er we both found the time. Her response? 'But I reolly wont lo see

me, ond l'm confident l'll end up in bed with her." He's free irc be
polient with her, to work the seduction slowly, ond not be ottoched
to the outcome. Be upbeot ond busy if you wont to turn o friend into
o lover.
R.efuse to snoy iust friends. lf you do whot we soy, things will

either get with the progrom (ond probobly soy, 'You've chonged!")

The first kiss con come ot ony time in on interoction with o womon. This
is o criticolly importont point. So mony men mess up their seductions of
women by thinking the first kiss hos lo come ot the end of the dote. They
therefore don't hove their eyes open for opportunities to go for the kiss
eorlier ond put so much pressure on themselves ot the end of the dote
thot they mess up the kiss onywoy.
As you proctice flirting, you'll find thot there ore more opportunilies lo
build up to ond go for the first kiss thon you used to think. For exomple,
we olwoys suggest thot you behove like o gentlemon wi$ women. lf o
womon interests you, lry to olwoys open doors for her. ln o nice restou-
ront, pull out the choir for her. lf she is o possenger in your cor, open the
door for her ond close it for her ofter she gets in. These little gentlemon-
ly moves ore like the Flirting Moves; they keep reminding her thot you
ore nol iust o friend. You ore o mon, treoting her like o womon. This will
go o long woy loword conlinuing the seduction. ln o woy, being o gen-
demon is o form of Situolionol Flirting, becouse you qre using the ele-

ments of the situotion you ore in os o woy of continuolly showing her
your romontic intentions. This con leod to o first kiss.
Here's on exomple: Dovid wos once on o dqte thot hod been set up by
some friends of his. His two friends (o couple) hod decided to ploy
motchmoker ond hod set up o dinner for the four of them. Now, we
olwoys odvise our students not lo count on their friends lo set lhem up,
but ot the some lime being set up is on occeptoble port of your doting
strolegy. lt iust should never be your one-ond-only hope. We olso usu-
olly tell men to hove Priming Dotes before hoving dinner dotes. (A
Priming Dote is o cofhe dote you hove with o womon. You don't move
on to Seduction Dotes-bosicolly evening dotes-until you've estob-
lished some mutuol sexuol inbrest. See our book How lo Succeed wilh
Women for much more on Priming Dotes ond Seduction Dotes.)
But few rules ore corved in stone, so Dovid went olong on this dinner-
ond-doncing dote. lt turned out the womon, Betsy, wos very prefi ond
intelligent. They hod o good time ot dinner; Dovid wos flirting with her,
smiling, holding eye conloct, winking ond checking out her body. He
osked her'Whofls the story behind thot?" ond did some Deepening. He
osked the Romontic Question 'lVhot is your ideo of o mosl romontic
dqte?" ond oll four of them discussed it. Dovid noticed thot ofter this,
Betsy's eyes sporkled os she looked ot him.
After dinner the four of them went doncing. Dovid's friends lei Dovid ond
Betsy off in front of the donce club while they went to pork lhe cor. lt wos
cold, so Dovid took off his iockei ond put it oround B"tty't shoulders os
they wolked trc the club. This wos Situotionol Flirting in thot it wos using
&lrirK lfflllins futlGr
the elements of the situotion fic show romonlic interest (though it wosn't
comic, os most Situotionol Flirting is). As they woited outside the club for
their friends, Betsy osked Dovid, 'Aren't you cold?" He onswered, 'Yes,
but o kiss would worm me up!" She soid, oOkoy,'ond they leoned fitg"th-
er ond kissed.
At thd point, they hod known eoch other obout two hours. He hod firted
ond shown romontic interest ond she hod responded. Once this kiss hod
hoppened, Dovid's queslion wos no longer'lVill she get sexuolwith me?"
The question become one of 'lVhen?" By poying otlention to the environ-
ment ond using the situotion to his odvonlrege, Dwid wos oble to get $e
first kiss well before the end of the dote-ond much more lqter in the
evening.
Here's onolher exomple. Ron wos on o Priming Dote with o womon in o
coffee shop. He hod done the Flirting Moves qnd osked his dote the
Romonlic Question 'lVhot is your ideol romontic dole?" She responded
enthusiosticolly, telling him, 'There ore octuolly three ideol scenorios"
ond describing them in detoil. She then osked him obout his ideol romon-
tic dote, ond they looked into eqch othey's eyes os he tolked obout it.
She excused herself to go to the bqthroom. When she come out of the
bolhroom, she poused in front of the fire burning in the coffee shop's
fireploce. Ron come up behind her ond gently put his honds on her
shoulders. She turned ond smiled, looking into his eyes, ond they kissed
severol times. This wos ofter knowing her for oboul on hour.

One of our students mel o womon ol o compus grocery co-op. They hit
it off ond he osked her if she'd like to go to o coffee shop with him. She
soid yes, so they went lo one ond tolked for over on hour. He did the
Flirting Moves ond Deepening ond osked some Romonlic Questions.
During o Deepening Conversotion he osked her, 'lVhot would you most
like to be doing with your life?" She onswered, ond there wos o very
close, intimote feeling in the oir. She osked him the question bock. He
onswered, "l don't knowwhot lwont to be doing with my life, but I know
thot right now I wont to be kissing you." She blushed ond soid, "Okayi'
ond he leoned ocross ond kissed her. From thot point on, there wos no
question thot their relotionship wos romqntic, not iust friends. Totol time
from meeling her to getting thot first kiss? One hour ond 20 minutes.
Does this hoppen every time? Of course not. But it con hoppen o lot more
thon most men reolize-but you hove lrc toke the opportunity to go for the
kiss when it presents itself. Simply hwing on eye open br opportunity will
dromoticolly increose your chonces of getting the first kiss well bebre the

There ore two bosic conditions fiot must be creoled for the first kiss to
work (for o lol more on this, see How lo Succeed with Womenl. First, she
must not be surprised by the kiss. She must be thinking of it or seeing it
os somewhot inevitoble. This will hoppen if you've shown your romontic
interest, if you've done whot we've outlined in this book, ond - here's the
X-foctor-if she likes you. lf you do fiese things, shet likely to like you,
lo*i'|s &l&ins tunlll8r
but of course, you never know. The bottom line: if you've shown romon-
tic interest, she shouldn't be surprised when you go to kiss her.
Second, she must like the ideo of being kissed. You test this through the
flirting ond Romqntic Conversotions thof you do. lf she resists your flirt-
ing - if she won't hold eye contoct, glores ot you when you check out her
body or turns owoy when you wink-she probobly is not interested in
the first kiss. lf she onswers oll your Romontic Questions with one-word
or evosive replies, she's probobly not interested. Don't bother going for
the kiss; she's nol interesbd.
lf she's been receptive trc oll the other romontic things you've done then you
con go br the first kiss wifi o good chonce of success. There ore o couple
of woys trr do it. You con osk her if you con kiss her, but mony women ftnd
this offonsVe, believe it or nol. You con "iusl do it " but when you do, you
run the risk of doing it ogoinst her will-which is third-degree sexuol ossoult
if it pisses her off enough. (Don't soy we didnt worn youl) We like simply
onnouncing the kiss by leoning trrword her ond sqying something like
'Wow, l'm going tc kiss you" or "Don't ponic, l'm going tc kiss you." This
works well ond doesn't leqve her thinking thot you ore o beggor or o ierk.
