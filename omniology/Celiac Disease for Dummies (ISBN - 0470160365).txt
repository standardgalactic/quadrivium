Sheila Crowe, MD, FRCPC, FACP, FACG, AGAF is a Professor of Medicine

to educate gastroenterologists, other physicians and patients and their 
families about celiac disease whether it is in Charlottesville, elsewhere in the 
USA or overseas.


Dedication
Ian: This book is dedicated to those many people — some of whom I know 
and love (like you, Laura!), some of whom are my patients, and most of whom 
I’ve never met — who live with, but refuse to be beaten back by, the challenges 
of co-existing with celiac disease.
Sheila: This book is dedicated to my mother-in-law, Kay Ernst, who passed 
away in 2002. In 1972 she co-founded the fi rst national support group in 
North America, the Canadian Celiac Association, and spent much of her 
remaining life working for the benefi t of individuals with celiac disease. I am 
also dedicating this book to everyone who lives with celiac disease including 
my patients and my husband Peter and those individuals whose mission it 
is to help those who have celiac disease. These include a growing group of 
gastroenterologists, nutritionists, and other health care professionals whose 
main interest is in caring for patients with celiac disease and others like Kay 
who donate their time and energy in organizations providing information and 
support to the increasing numbers of people with celiac disease and their 
families.
Authors’ Acknowledgements
Ian: I would like to thank my Wiley editors, Robert Hickey, Tracy Barr, and 
Colleen Totz Diamond for continuing to mentor me in my ongoing journey 
as I strive to eventually write an entire page — oh heck, even a single 
paragraph — free of a red edit. On the medical front, I would like to (again) 
thank Dr. Sloane Waitzer for her helpful advice.
Sheila, my co-author, deserves an incredible thank you, not only for the 
efforts that she’s invested in helping bring this book to life, but also for the 
incalculable other ways — scientifi c, clinical, volunteer, . . . that she has 
helped people living with celiac disease lead healthy lives.
Sheila: I am most grateful to my co-author Ian for his energy, humor, hard-
work and support as we have worked together making this book a reality. I 
wish to acknowledge the helpful contributions of the members of our local 
“Charlottesvilli” celiac disease support group, of Janet Rinehart, chairman 
and founder of the Houston Celiac Support Group and a friend and colleague 
from the nine years I spent in Texas, and the excellent group of nutritionists 
that I have worked with at the University of Virginia since 2001 including 
Carol Parrish, Amy Pagano, and others over the years. I am also grateful to 
Shelley Case as her efforts provide outstanding resources on the gluten-free 
diet whether you are a patient or a health professional like me. Thanks also 
to our Wiley editors, Robert Hickey, Tracy Barr, and Colleen Totz Diamond 
for their assistance.

Introduction
W
hat a difference a few years make! It was only a short time ago that 
few people had ever heard of celiac disease. And, when it was a 
subject of discussion, the conversation was typically rife with misconcep-
tions, misapprehensions, and misinformation. Compounding this unfortunate 
scenario was the fact that celiac disease was little taught in medical schools, 
and, outside of select health care disciplines, was off the medical radar. Heck, 
it wasn’t just off the radar; it was somewhere south of Alpha Centauri. Well, 
that was then and this is now. How topical is celiac disease these days? How 
much importance is now properly placed on this common condition? Well, 
let’s put it this way: You have in your hands an entire book devoted to the 
subject!
There’s not much to love about having celiac disease. Celiac disease can 
make you feel crummy. It can lead to damage to your body. It requires con-
stant treatment and vigilance. And it’s a lifelong condition. So if you think 
that being dealt a celiac disease diagnosis is patently and profoundly unfair, 
we won’t disagree because you’re right; it is unfair. But here’s the thing: 
Although having celiac disease is no piece of cake, the wonderful thing — 
the absolutely . . . wonderful . . . thing — is that you can be entirely healthy 
with your celiac disease. You can live a full, active, long and productive life 
with your celiac disease. You can explore the ocean depths or climb the 
Himalayas. You can work on the city subway or have a top-floor office in the 
nearest skyscraper. You can play in the NFL or play in the backyard sandbox 
(age permitting!). And, as for celiac disease not being a piece of cake, well, 
actually you can have a piece of cake . . . so long as it doesn’t contain a nutri-
ent called gluten. As we look at in detail in this book, avoiding gluten is the 
key to successfully living with celiac disease. The world can be your oyster 
(hey, oysters are gluten-free so have as many as you want) and in this book 
we show you how.
About This Book
We’ve written this book for people living with celiac disease, and in case you 
think this phrase is ambiguous, this is by intention because if one member 
of a family has celiac disease, everyone in the family is very much living with 
celiac disease. Which is all to say that we hope Celiac Disease For Dummies 
is helpful whether you are the one who has celiac disease or you are read-
ing this book because someone you care about — a child, another family 
member, or another loved one — has the condition.

2
Celiac Disease For Dummies 
Throughout this book, when we discuss celiac disease as causing one or 
another problem, we are typically talking about untreated or insufficiently 
treated celiac disease. Celiac disease that is properly treated (by, as you 
will discover, meticulously following a diet free of a nutrient called gluten) 
typically causes . . . nothing! Also, whenever we use the term active celiac 
disease, we are again referring to celiac disease that is untreated or insuf-
ficiently treated, in which case there is still active inflammation in the small 
intestine (something which we explain in detail in Chapter 2).
We hope you find this book helpful, interesting, informative, and even enter-
taining. We’d truly love to get your feedback. You can reach us by e-mail at 
celiacdisease@ianblumer.com. (We apologize in advance, however, for 
our being unable to provide responses for medical advice.)
Conventions Used in This Book
This book is co-written by Sheila (hi) and Ian (hello). Sheila lives in 
Charlottesville, Virginia, and Ian lives in Toronto, Ontario. So, begging the 
indulgence of our Canadian readers, we’ve elected to use U.S. spelling since 
that is what most of our readers use.
Most people living in Canada and the United States receive the bulk of their 
health care from a physician, but increasingly people are also (or, instead) 
seeing physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other important allied 
health care professionals. Because it would be onerous to repeatedly write 
out (and, we suspect, boring for you to read) each of these titles, we hope 
you will indulge us and, when we write that we recommend you “see your 
physician” or “see your primary care provider,” that you will read this to 
mean we are advocating that you contact whichever health care professional 
acts as your main health care provider.
And speaking of health care providers, throughout this book we discuss 
the terribly important role of registered dietitians in assisting people living 
with celiac disease to take charge of their condition by healthy, gluten-free 
eating. Registered dietitians have passed stringent academic requirements 
and are part of an officially certified health care profession. Again, because it 
gets awfully repetitious to add the word “registered” before each use of the 
word “dietitian,” whenever we use the word “dietitian” we are specifically 
(and only) referring to registered dietitians. Similarly, when we use the word 
nutritionist we are once again using this term interchangeably with registered 
dietitian.

 Introduction
Following are a few other standard conventions you’ll see in this book:
 
✓ Italic type is used for emphasis and to introduce new terms.
 
✓ Bold indicates the action parts in numbered steps. It also emphasizes 
the keywords in a bulleted list.
 
✓ Web addresses show up in monofont.
What You Don’t Have to Read
We hope that you’ll find everything in this book to be both interesting and 
helpful; however, there are a couple of things that, should you wish, you can 
take a pass on without missing out on any essential information. 
 
✓ Sidebars are shaded areas that contain additional, often scientifically-
based detail on selected topics. 
 
✓ Paragraphs that follow a Technical Stuff icon (we explain what icons are 
all about later in this Introduction) are, as you might surmise, comprised 
of, well, technical stuff.
Reading these materials can be deferred indefinitely (unless you’re mar-
ried to us in which case — Peter and Heather take note — we’ll be mortally 
offended and deeply hurt if you don’t read every single word we’ve written!).
Foolish Assumptions
We have written this book based on the assumption that whatever your 
knowledge of celiac disease, you want to learn more. Period. If you know 
nothing about celiac disease you will find this book allows you to readily 
discover the basics, and if you’re already acquainted with the condition, 
you’ll discover additional details to meet your needs.
How This Book Is Organized
This book is divided into six parts to help you readily find the information 
you’re seeking.

4
Celiac Disease For Dummies 
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis 
of Celiac Disease
In this part, we define the condition and look at how it can impact you emo-
tionally and psychologically. We also take a journey down the gastrointes-
tinal tract and look at how it functions both normally and when injured by 
celiac disease. You’ll discover possible causes for celiac disease (gluten trig-
gers the condition, but why this happens to some people and not others is 
largely a mystery), the way in which celiac disease is diagnosed, who should 
be tested for it, and the different types of celiac disease.
Part II: How Celiac Disease 
Can Make You Feel
Some people with undiagnosed celiac disease have nary a symptom while 
others feel like they’ve been hit by a train. In this part, we look at the many 
different symptoms that can be caused by celiac disease and we point out 
symptoms that might otherwise be potentially passed off as being unrelated. 
We also look at conditions, like anemia, that can be caused by celiac disease, 
and other conditions, like type 1 diabetes with which celiac disease can be 
associated.
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease
The key to successfully managing celiac disease is the complete elimination 
of gluten from your diet. We explore this essential nutritional consideration 
in detail in this part. We also provide helpful tips for shopping and cooking 
gluten-free and what to do should your diet seem not to be working. Also, we 
explore alternative and complementary treatments.
Part IV: The Long Term: Living and 
Thriving with Celiac Disease
Until a cure is found, if you have celiac disease today, you’re going to have it 
tomorrow, the next day, and for the foreseeable future. Therefore, it’s helpful 
to know how to deal with celiac disease at various stages of life. In this part, 
we look at how celiac disease can be managed from childhood to adulthood. 
We also look at how you and your health care team can monitor your celiac 
disease both when it’s under control and when it seems not to be. Lastly, we 
explore some potentially exciting future therapies that may make living with 
celiac disease a lot simpler.

 Introduction
Part V: The Part of Tens
The Part of Tens presents key information that you won’t want to miss. Here 
you discover ten frequently asked questions (likely including those you may 
have asked yourself), ten tips for living normally, and ten myths, mispercep-
tions, and falsehoods you may have heard about celiac disease.
Part VI: Appendixes
The Internet is an invaluable, but sometimes intimidating (or, even worse, 
misleading) resource. In this part, we provide a handy-dandy list of help-
ful celiac disease Web sites worth visiting and a listing of organizations for 
people living with celiac disease.
Icons Used in This Book
There exist political, intellectual, social, and goodness knows how many 
other icons in society. Well, we don’t discuss those here! No, the icons we 
mention here are those that serve as little flags or identifiers — bookmarks 
if you will — that let you know what information you’re going to find in the 
paragraph that follows.
 
This icon signifies that we’re sharing a story about a patient. These stories 
have been specifically selected because they contain elements that you may 
well relate to. (The names and other identifiers have been changed to main-
tain confidentiality.)
 
This  icon lets you know that we’re about to drop some medical jargon on you. 
Don’t be alarmed; we then define or explain the term before we move on.
 
This icon indicates we’re providing information of a technical nature. You may 
find this interesting to read, but it is not fundamental to your understanding of 
celiac disease.
 
When you see this icon, it means the information is essential and you would 
be well served to pay special attention.

Celiac Disease For Dummies 
 
Many — indeed most — aspects of living with celiac disease you can manage 
quite nicely on your own, thank you very much. But there are times when you 
need to seek medical attention. This icon lets you know we’re discussing 
something that will require you to see your primary care provider (be it your 
family physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, and so forth), your 
celiac disease specialist physician, your dietitian or another member of your 
health care team in order to get help.
 
This icon indicates that we’re sharing a practical piece of information that will 
arm you with a time-saving or grief-avoiding measure.
 
This icon means we’re discussing critical issues and that immediate or immi-
nent harm could come to you if the information is overlooked or not heeded.
Where to Go from Here
Celiac Disease For Dummies is written in modular format, which is basically 
a fancy way of saying that this book is structured so that you can open it to 
whatever topic interests you at a particular time rather than having it to read 
it from front to back. Having said that, if you have no familiarity with celiac 
disease, you may find that reading it in just that way works best for you.
Not sure where to start? Well, recognizing there isn’t a bad place to begin 
your journey of discovery, if you’ve just been diagnosed and are finding the 
whole notion of having celiac disease overwhelming, have a look at Chapter 
1 to discover the emotional impact of being told you have celiac disease. 
Alternatively, you may want to flip to Chapter 2 and delve right into an explo-
ration of the human gut, how it works, and what happens to the gut if you 
have celiac disease. Or you may want to do what Ian does whenever he takes 
a For Dummies book home (other than the ones he’s written!) and start by 
reading the Part of Tens chapters. Sure, some of it won’t make sense until 
you’ve read other parts of the book, but you may still find it the most inter-
esting section of all to read.

Part I
Dealing with the 
Diagnosis of 
Celiac Disease

In this part . . .
B
eing diagnosed with celiac disease is, for many peo-
ple, both a shock (who wants to be told you have a 
disease for which there is no cure?) and a relief (knowing 
that with a change to your diet you can maintain good 
health). In this part, you find out how the diagnosis of 
celiac disease is made, the psychological and physical 
impact of the condition, and the various types of celiac 
disease.

Chapter 1
Finding Out You Have 
Celiac Disease
In This Chapter
▶ Understanding celiac disease
▶ Coming to terms with the diagnosis of celiac disease
▶ Considering how celiac disease can make you feel
▶ Treating celiac disease
▶ Living well with celiac disease
▶ Coping with a celiac disease diagnosis
▶ Looking at celiac disease support groups
W
hen you first find out that you or your loved one has celiac disease, 
you may be shocked. No one likes to hear bad news, and, as so often 
happens in this type of situation, you may recall little other than the words 
celiac disease from the conversation you have with your doctor that day.
Over the next few days and weeks, your mind may race non-stop as you mull 
over your new diagnosis and try to come to grips with it. Or, if the diagnosis 
is brand new to you, perhaps you are right now in the process of trying to 
deal with the news.
Celiac Disease For Dummies provides you not just with the facts about celiac 
disease, but the tools to help you master it. In this chapter, our goal is to help 
you understand and come to terms with your diagnosis.
Getting to Know Celiac Disease
Celiac disease, also known as celiac sprue, non-tropical sprue, and gluten-sensitive 
enteropathy, is a condition in which consuming gluten — a protein found in 
wheat, rye, barley, and some other grains — leads, in susceptible people, 
to damage to the lining of the small intestine, resulting in the inability to 

10
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
properly absorb nutrients into the body. This can lead to many different symp-
toms, including fatigue, malaise (feeling generally poorly), bloating, and diar-
rhea. Left untreated or insufficiently treated, celiac disease can lead to damage 
to other organs. If properly treated, celiac disease typically leads to . . . nothing!
 
In your travels, you may see the word celiac spelled as coeliac. Both terms 
refer to the same condition. Celiac is the spelling far more commonly used 
in North America and, hence, the spelling we use throughout this book. 
Incidentally, the term celiac (or coeliac) comes from the Greek word Koila, 
which refers to the abdomen.
Doctors have known about celiac disease for a long time. Articles describ-
ing individuals suffering from diarrhea (most likely due to what we now call 
celiac disease) first appeared over two thousand years ago. It was, however, 
Dr. Samuel Gee who, in London, England in 1887, first described the condition 
in detail and even presciently observed that successful therapy was to be 
found in changing a patient’s diet.
Dealing with the Diagnosis 
of Celiac Disease
Perhaps you are already aware (and if you’re not, you soon will be as it is 
a recurring theme in this book) of the key role that a nutrient called gluten 
plays in triggering celiac disease. As we discuss in Chapter 2, however, 
although gluten triggers the condition, that’s not quite the same as saying it 
causes the condition.
By way of analogy, if ever you were working on your computer and you rou-
tinely pressed a key only to suddenly have your computer crash, one could 
appropriately say that pressing the key triggered the crash, but an underlying 
software glitch caused the problem in the first place.
What, then, causes celiac disease? The quick answer is we don’t know. The 
more complicated answer is a combination of having a susceptibility to the 
condition by virtue of one’s genetic make-up in conjunction with some as 
yet unknown environmental factor. Chapter 2 contains the full story on the 
cause, as best we understand it, of celiac disease.
Unless people are ill with some sort of gastrointestinal (GI) ailment, they 
understandably generally think little, if at all, about the incredibly complex 
processes involved in extracting the good from the food we eat and ridding 
our bodies of the stuff we don’t need. That makes sense. When celiac disease 
enters your life (either directly or by virtue of a family member now being 
affected by it), however, having some familiarity with your GI system proves 
beneficial. Chapter 2 explains how your GI system works when you’re healthy 
and how it malfunctions when you have celiac disease.

11
 Chapter 1: Finding Out You Have Celiac Disease
Some diseases are easy to diagnose. Tell a doctor you have spells where you 
see flashing lights followed by a throbbing headache, and, dollars to donuts, 
the doctor will quickly inform you that you may be suffering from migraine 
headaches.
Diagnosing celiac disease is never that simple. It involves an interview and 
examination by a physician, and necessitates investigations typically includ-
ing blood tests and always having a fiberoptic scope passed through your 
mouth, down your esophagus, through your stomach and into your small 
intestine where a biopsy is then taken. Okay, we admit, that may not sound 
particularly pleasant, but as you see in Chapter 3, it ain’t so bad at all.
If you are diagnosed with celiac disease, or if a close relative has it, you 
may be wondering whether other family members are similarly affected. In 
Chapter 4, we look at who should be screened (tested) for celiac disease and 
how the screening should be done. In Chapter 5, we discuss the different 
types of celiac disease, including those forms typically found at the time of 
screening.
Discovering celiac disease
The first definitive report of celiac disease was 
made by Dr. Samuel Gee in London, England 
in 1887 in his seminal study “On the Coeliac 
Affection.” Dr. Gee astutely observed that “if 
the patient can be cured at all, it must be by 
means of diet.”
He experimented with various diets and noted 
that “A child, who was fed upon a quart of the 
best Dutch mussels daily, throve wonderfully, 
but relapsed when the season for mussels was 
over.” It is, perhaps no surprise to any parent 
that Dr. Gee also reported, “Next season 
(the child) could not be prevailed upon to 
take them.”
In 1950, the link between celiac disease and 
wheat was finally established. In that year, 
Dr. Willem-Karel Dicke, a Dutch pediatrician, 
reported that children with symptoms of celiac 
disease got better when wheat was removed 
from their diet.
His discovery was based on observations that 
during World War II — during which wheat 
products were in short supply in Holland — pre-
viously unwell children, now deprived of wheat-
based products, had relief from their symptoms 
with them only to return upon the reintroduction 
of wheat into their diet after the end of the war.
With the realization that the absence of wheat 
relieved symptoms and the availability of wheat 
resulted in symptoms, Dr. Dicke joined that pan-
theon of clever people who, by using just their 
keen powers of observation, had made discov-
eries that were to improve the lives of millions 
of people.

12
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
Knowing How Having 
Celiac Disease Feels
It could well be that you were diagnosed with celiac disease after having 
been unwell for quite some time. If so, then when you read this section’s 
heading (“Knowing How Having Celiac Disease Feels”), you may have said to 
yourself, “Hey, I can tell you how it feels. It feels crummy. I had belly pain and 
I had indigestion and I had . . . ” Yup, those things sure can happen. But so 
too can many other symptoms or, on the other side of the spectrum, few or 
even no symptoms at all.
In Chapter 6, we look at the whole panoply of symptoms one can experience 
if one has celiac disease. Some of these may lead you to nod your head in rec-
ognition (such as the symptoms we just mentioned), and some may take you 
by surprise (such as discovering the link between celiac disease and condi-
tions as varied as skin rash and infertility).
As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, if left untreated or insufficiently 
treated, celiac disease can not only make you feel unwell, but it can lead to 
serious damage to your body (including causing complications like osteopo-
rosis, anemia, and more).
In Chapter 7, we take a detailed look at these potential complications and 
how to avoid them. In Chapter 8, we look at the many ailments that are not 
directly caused by celiac disease, but are associated with it. We describe the 
kinds of symptoms these ailments cause and the symptoms to which you 
should pay the most heed.
For many people, the most feared complication of celiac disease is cancer. 
Thankfully, celiac disease seldom leads to this, but it can. In Chapter 9, we 
make you aware of the types of cancer that are linked to celiac disease and, 
most important, early warning signs on which you should keep a close watch.
Treating Celiac Disease
Celiac disease can make you feel unwell. It can be a hassle to live with. It can 
cause complications, including damage to your body. Oh joy. So now the 
good news: You have ultimate power over this condition. Even better, this 
power is derived not from taking a truckload of pills — or, indeed, any pills 
at all; no, this power is derived from you modifying your diet to eliminate any 
and all gluten.

13
 Chapter 1: Finding Out You Have Celiac Disease
Modifying your diet to eliminate gluten intake, however, isn’t simple and 
requires lots of work and, like they say about the price of freedom, eternal 
vigilance. In Chapter 10, we look in detail at what constitutes a gluten-free 
diet and provide all sorts of tips to help you make the necessary changes to 
the way you eat and how you eat. And, speaking of vigilance, we also look at 
hidden sources of gluten for which you should be on the lookout.
When it comes to celiac disease, gluten is the most important nutrient that 
affects the health of your GI system, but it’s not the only one. As you see in 
Chapter 11, celiac disease can lead to low iron levels and difficulty digesting 
certain milk products (a condition called lactose intolerance).
Infrequently, but sometimes, despite carefully following a gluten-free diet, a 
person continues to feel unwell. Could it be that gluten is sneaking its way 
into your diet? Or could it be, perhaps, that you either don’t have celiac dis-
ease (doctors do make mistakes, including mistaken diagnoses) or that you 
have an additional ailment that’s causing your symptoms. In Chapter 12 we 
explore these possibilities.
Chapter 13 looks at alternative and complementary therapies that some 
people with celiac disease sometimes consider employing.
Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease
Although people living with celiac disease share many similar challenges, dif-
ferences exist for some people based on age, living condition (home or in a 
college dorm for instance), and special circumstances such as attempting to 
conceive, or being pregnant. Chapters 14 and 15 cover living — and thriving — 
with celiac disease in these situations.
Perhaps it’s been some time since you were diagnosed with celiac disease 
and you are nicely on track with your gluten-free existence. What then? Do 
you need to be monitored for celiac disease-related health issues? If so, how 
should the monitoring be done? Chapter 15 describes the ongoing care of 
celiac disease and ways that you can continue to empower yourself.
Better ways of managing celiac disease may emerge in the future. Indeed, 
there may come a time when you may not need to follow a gluten-free diet. 
In Chapter 16, we explore these and other possible options for dealing with 
celiac disease that may come about someday.

Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
Handling the News
From the time you were first told you (or your loved one) had celiac disease 
until the time you picked up and started reading this book, you probably 
have experienced many different feelings and conflicting emotions.
If you were feeling poorly — especially if this had been going on for a long 
time — with typical symptoms of celiac disease (we discuss these in Chapter 6), 
you likely felt relief that the cause of your troubles was identified and that 
treatment would make you feel better. At the same time, you may have been 
understandably upset that you had been saddled with a diagnosis for which 
there is no cure. All these feelings are perfectly normal.
In this section, we look at a few of the different types of feelings that people 
experience after being diagnosed with celiac disease.
Experiencing denial
Your first reaction upon being told that you had celiac disease may have 
been surprise; indeed, you may have been stunned. And it could be that, 
as the impact of being told you had this life-changing disease sunk in, you 
doubted it could be the case.
“Me? Celiac disease? No way,” you may have said to yourself or others.
You may have then looked up information on the Internet and found that 
your symptoms didn’t match all of those listed on some Web sites; this may 
have provided additional justification to your feelings of denial.
But you still weren’t feeling as well as you should or your lab tests showed 
you were deficient in certain nutrients, or your bone density was low (as seen 
with osteoporosis), or you had some other feature of celiac disease which, 
try as you might, wasn’t going to disappear. Eventually, you likely came — 
perhaps grudgingly — to accept that you had the condition. Or perhaps as 
you read this book, you have only recently been diagnosed and you still can’t 
believe it. Either way, these feelings are perfectly natural.
Being angry
If you felt angry after you were told you had celiac disease, rest assured, this 
is normal and perfectly understandable. You’ve got enough going on in your 
life without being told there is another issue you have to contend with.

15
 Chapter 1: Finding Out You Have Celiac Disease
Having celiac disease isn’t like having a strep throat or bladder infection that 
will quickly go away after a few days of antibiotics; if you have celiac disease 
today, you will have it tomorrow and next week and next month and next 
year, too. And who wants that? Nobody.
It’s also perfectly understandable to be angered by the “work” of having 
celiac disease. All of a sudden, you need to spend far greater effort when 
shopping and cooking, not to mention the additional expense of buying food 
that is gluten-free. Also, in addition to the usual considerations regarding 
fat content, calories, sodium, and so forth, you now also need to scrutinize 
everything you eat to ensure that it doesn’t have gluten.
The diagnosis of celiac disease may not be what led to anger. You may be 
angry that the diagnosis wasn’t made earlier. Many people go months or even 
years, feeling unwell all the time, before their celiac disease is discovered. 
During this time, other, incorrect diagnoses may have been made or people 
may have been told that their problem was “all in your head” or “due to 
nerves.” No wonder a person in this situation feels frustrated or angry.
Another source of anger arises when a person with a delayed diagnosis 
reflects on the lost opportunity to have prevented complications from celiac 
disease (such as, for example, osteoporosis).
By the way, we are not casting stones here. Celiac disease is an ailment that 
can both mimic and masquerade as many other diseases and a delayed or 
“Celiac disease? Me? It can’t be.”
A long, long time ago, when Ian was a naïve 
young thing in second year medical school, he 
was asked by the attending physician in the 
teaching hospital clinic to inform a 45 year-old 
patient that his test results had come back show-
ing that he had celiac disease. Ian recalls sitting 
down beside the man and telling him the news 
and then explaining in great detail — and over 
considerable time — the rationale leading to the 
diagnosis, how the patient’s symptoms fit, how 
the blood tests were abnormal, and how a small 
intestine biopsy showed irrefutable evidence.
Finishing his lengthy monologue, Ian prepared 
to answer the patient’s first question which 
surely was going to be “Okay, so how do we 
treat this?” or, perhaps, “What caused this?” 
or some such thing. Instead, the man looked 
Ian square in the eyes and said, “I don’t believe 
it.” And added, “I don’t mean to sound rude, but 
your tests must be wrong; there’s been some 
mistake. There’s no way I have celiac disease.”
With that, the man stood up, thanked Ian for his 
time, and left. Ian recalls feeling stunned that, 
despite incontrovertible evidence to the con-
trary, the patient was convinced that he didn’t 
have celiac disease. As it turned out, the gentle-
man returned to the clinic a few months later 
after having continued to feel unwell and having 
come — with reluctance — to accept the diag-
nosis and begin treatment. (And Ian came to 
learn that denial is a normal part of the process 
of coming to terms with unwelcome news.)

16
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
missed diagnosis is not uncommon; indeed, many an excellent physician has 
overlooked this diagnosis.
Regardless of the source of your anger, the thing is, feeling angry isn’t useful 
treatment. Eventually, anger has to be left behind so that you can get on with 
your life and get back to and maintain a state of good health.
Feeling sad
Feeling sad upon hearing bad news is perfectly understandable and normal. 
You may find, however, that if you’ve been feeling unwell (especially if it’s 
been for quite some time), your sadness will be mixed with relief now that 
treatment will get you feeling better in short order. You should realize, how-
ever, that even after your celiac disease symptoms are controlled, you may at 
times feel sad that you have celiac disease. With time, that too will pass.
Taking the next step
Upon finding out that you have celiac disease, you experienced times when 
you felt angry or sad, and perhaps you even denied that you had celiac dis-
ease. None of these feelings have gotten your symptoms to go away or your 
blood tests to normalize, and now you’re ready to take the bull by the horns 
(speaking of which, if you choose, you can take more than the bull’s horns 
because unprocessed meat doesn’t contain gluten!) and deal with your diag-
nosis. Wonderful. As you learn the ins and outs of living a gluten-free exis-
tence, don’t get mad at yourself if, from time to time, some of your old angst 
shows up. That is normal and will pass.
When you’re feeling down or frustrated or simply upset at having celiac dis-
ease, you may find the following coping strategies helpful:
 
✓ Be a positive thinker. Focus on how much better you will feel once 
you’re following a gluten-free diet or, if you’re already on treatment, how 
much better you already feel. Unlike so many other diseases, you have 
the power to control things without requiring medication.
 
✓ Know that you’re not alone. Recognize that there are health care pro-
fessionals — most importantly, dietitians — who are there to help you 
learn what you need to know. You’re not on your own!
 
✓ Involve your family. As you learn about living gluten-free, you can share 
your newfound knowledge about nutrition with your partner and your 
children. You will find that you are — or will shortly become — a true 
nutrition resource! Also, involving your family allows them to provide 
you with the support and encouragement you may need and want from 
time to time.

17
 Chapter 1: Finding Out You Have Celiac Disease
 
✓ Seek out a celiac disease support group. Find a support group, either 
one that meets in your community or an online one. We discuss online 
support groups in the next section.
Finding Information and 
Support on the Internet
We certainly hope that you will find this book a helpful tool to assist you in 
your quest to find out more about your celiac disease, but we also recognize 
that a vast amount of additional information is available in Cyberspace. (How 
vast? Last time we checked, using our favorite search engine on the term 
celiac disease, we got 4.6 million hits. Wow!)
Some of the information you find online is good, and some is, to put it chari-
tably, not quite as good (or downright awful to be quite frank). In this sec-
tion, we look at how you can use the Web to find more information about 
celiac disease and how you can seek out Internet support groups to lend you 
a cyber-hand when you need it.
Knowing whether an Internet 
site is reputable
Okay, sure, sometimes it’s obvious when an Internet site is not to be trusted, 
like if you were to come across a site called www.wesellusedcarsand
wealsocureceliacdisease.com. But most of the time, it’s not nearly so 
easy to tell whether you’ve reached a cutting edge, state-of-the-art site, or 
one that is far less reputable.
A Web site that is credible and provides reliable information and advice 
(recognizing that, of course, none of these criteria guarantees the site will be 
sound) generally does the following:
 
✓ Reports facts objectively. The site provides information in an even-
handed way and avoids sensationalism.
 
✓ Relies on science. The site doesn’t rely on testimonials to the exclu-
sion of science. An unusual or unique treatment that appeared to help a 
person with celiac disease isn’t proof that it worked; perhaps the person 
got better for an unrelated reason.
 
✓ Uses ads responsibly. The site doesn’t have advertising or, if it does, the 
ads, like the site, are not over-the-top declarations encouraging you to 
buy “instant cure” miracle-type products.

18
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
 
✓ Aims primarily to inform, not to sell. If the site is run by a scientific 
organization, hospital, health care clinic, or recognized expert on celiac 
disease, the site is likely very reputable. If the site is owned and run by 
a company that is marketing a product, question whether the informa-
tion on the site is appropriately dispassionate and even-handed. Such 
company-owned sites may be perfectly reasonable and good sources of 
information; it’s just necessary to question it, that’s all.
 
 One clue that a site is run by a scientific or academic — rather than a 
commercial — institution is the appearance of “.org” or “.edu” rather 
than “.com” in its Web address. You can find many exceptions to this 
general rule, but it represents a good starting point.
 
✓ Identifies its author. The author or authors of the site are identified and, 
ideally, the site provides background information regarding important 
details such as their professional qualifications and academic affiliations 
(if any).
 
 Use a search engine, such as Google or Yahoo, to search the Internet for 
the names of a Web site’s authors. You may discover an author has writ-
ten hundreds of scientific articles, which is good, or you may discover 
that they’ve just lost their medical license because of incompetence — 
which, ahem, is bad.
 
✓ Uses verifiable facts. Information on the site is referenced or at least 
supported by verifiable facts rather than just being “stream of con-
sciousness” opinion. Also, if the site quotes scientific studies, check to 
see whether they were published in obscure-sounding journals; they 
may be obscure for good reason. (Although, of course, some excellent 
scientific journals have unusual names.)
 
✓ Does not engage in conspiracy thinking. If the site talks about conspira-
cies amongst the medical community or “big business” or government 
or some other organization said to be participant in some Machiavellian 
scheme to “hide the cure” to celiac disease, then not only should you take 
a pass on the site, we would recommend you use your imagination to con-
jure up a cyber-toilet and flush away this offensive and disreputable site.
In Appendix A, we list some helpful and reputable Web sites where you can 
find useful information on celiac disease.
Finding a celiac disease support 
group on the Web
An Internet-based support group (which, depending on the specific nature of 
the group, may also be referred to as a discussion group, discussion forum, or 
chat group) is a place where people affected by a condition, either directly 
because they have it or indirectly because a loved one has it, can exchange 
thoughts, ideas, facts, and suggestions.

19
 Chapter 1: Finding Out You Have Celiac Disease
 
Although forums may require you to join (done by filling out an electronic 
form on their site) before you can post comments, most groups allow you to 
see any already posted material without having to sign up.
Support groups are designed to provide support. That is, however, just the 
tip of the iceberg. Indeed, support groups provide myriad other functions 
above and beyond this. They can also have their downsides, however. In the 
sections that follow, we look at these issues.
Understanding how a online support group can help you
An Internet-based support group can help you by providing the following:
 
✓ Other people’s stories. If you don’t know other people with celiac dis-
ease and as a result are feeling isolated, reading other peoples’ stories 
about how they have been affected by celiac disease can help you real-
ize that you’re not the only person out there battling the condition.
 
✓ Patient-provided tips. You can find many tips that others with celiac 
disease have posted regarding helpful shopping, cooking, and other 
“living with celiac disease” topics. For example, a person may have 
discovered a great place to buy gluten-free foods (either online or at a 
bricks-and-mortar store) and may be keen to share this information.
 
✓ Opportunities to share your story. You may find it cathartic or stress-
relieving to share with others your own trials and tribulations with 
celiac disease.
 
✓ Encouragement. Support groups are designed to provide support! 
Having a bad day? Feeling fed-up with living gluten-free? Let the group 
know and you’ll likely find members quickly commiserate and encourage 
you to keep up your efforts.
 
✓ Opportunities to help others. You can gain satisfaction by helping 
others if you share your own how-to tips with the cyber-community.
 
✓ Success stories. If celiac disease is new to you, you may find it reassur-
ing to read postings from people who have successfully lived with celiac 
disease for many years.
 
✓ Substitute for a “real” support group. If you don’t have a local, “real” 
(as opposed to online) support group, or if you do but are unable to 
attend (out of shyness or scheduling conflicts or lack of time or what-
ever), online forums allow you to still participate in group discussion 
and to do so at times that are convenient for you.
 
✓ Worldwide support. The Web is, by its very nature, a worldwide entity. 
You can use the Web to discover how people are living with their celiac 
disease not only in other cities, but other continents. You may even 
become friends (virtual or otherwise) with people you “meet” in the 
discussion group.

20
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
 
✓ Multi-language support. You may be able to find discussion groups that 
converse in the language in which you are most comfortable.
 
✓ Resource to take to your doctor. If you’re having symptoms of one sort 
or another, you may find postings describing similar issues and what 
was eventually found to be their cause. You could then ask your health 
care provider if your symptoms, too, might be attributable to this.
Recognizing the downsides of online support groups
Like the Internet in general, online support groups have both upsides (see 
the immediately preceding section) and downsides. Here are some of these 
downsides and what you can do to avoid these pitfalls:
 
✓ Question your sources. Anyone can post to a discussion forum. Anyone. 
You could be reading a posting that has been written by a well-informed, 
knowledgeable, well-meaning individual who has something important 
to share . . . or you could be reading a posting by someone who is ill-
informed and is sharing nothing more than misinformation.
 
✓ Avoid endless complainers. Some people participate in a support group 
for no other reason than because they’ve got an axe to grind. Although 
sometimes reading about someone else’s complaints can be helpful in 
its own way, to read complaint after complaint after complaint can get 
to be a real downer.
 
✓ Scrutinize sales pitches. Online support groups may contain postings by 
people whose main goal is to try to sell you something, whether or not 
the product is of proven value or benefit.
 
✓ Turn away sites dominated by a few individuals. Online support 
groups may have posting after posting after posting by a single or small 
group of individuals who dominate, take over, and hijack discussions.
 
✓ Leave mean-spirited groups. Support group postings sometimes degen-
erate into nothing more than name calling, insults, and other derogatory 
rants. Not a pretty sight (or site!).
 
Look for support groups that are moderated; that is, they have someone (typi-
cally a well-meaning, reasoned, and knowledgeable person) who supervises 
the postings and removes those that fall below or outside an appropriate 
minimum standard.
Finding an Internet support group
You can begin your search for an online celiac disease support group by 
typing, in quotes, “celiac disease support group” or “celiac support groups” 
or some other similar phrase into your preferred search engine. You can 
even start your own online celiac disease support group. One way to do this 
is through Yahoo!Groups (http://groups.yahoo.com).

21
 Chapter 1: Finding Out You Have Celiac Disease
 
Some Internet support groups cater specifically to a certain geographic region, 
such as a particular state.
Looking at “Real” (Non-Virtual) 
Support Groups
Whether or not you elect to participate in an Internet-based support group, 
we recommend you consider joining a local, non-virtual-world group. By par-
ticipating in such a group, you can do the following:
 
✓ Get to know real people. You get to meet in the flesh other people living 
with celiac disease. Getting to know snippets of someone’s life by read-
ing postings on the Internet is one thing; spending time with a “real” 
person is quite another.
 
✓ Expand your conversations. Spending time with others allows you to 
have expanded conversations not constrained by the limitations of inter-
acting exclusively online. Online postings are, by their very nature, typi-
cally a few sentences long and necessarily limited in scope.
 
✓ Meet people who know your locale. Local people live locally! The great 
benefit of meeting local people is that your neighbors likely know the 
best places in your community to buy gluten-free foods, the most knowl-
edgeable and helpful dietitians and doctors, and so much more.
 
✓ Mobilize the group to work together. There is strength in numbers. The 
group can order food items in bulk to minimize shipping charges and 
can then divide up the goods amongst the people that ordered the prod-
uct; that way, you (and the others) can help avoid storing large amounts 
of a product that you may use only occasionally. The power of a group 
can also be helpful in persuading a local heath food or specialty food 
store to stock their shop with gluten-free products that the group identi-
fies as tasty and worth having available locally.
 
✓ Participate in organized activities. Participating in such group activi-
ties allows you to learn the “gluten-free” ropes of shopping, cooking, and 
eating out while making new friends and acquaintances. Local support 
groups often organize helpful events such as:
 
• Cooking demonstrations
 
• Food tastings
 
• Restaurant outings
 
• Seasonal parties

22
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
 
✓ Attend presentations. Support groups often invite speakers to talk with 
the group. A speaker may be a celiac disease specialist, dermatologist 
(skin specialist), rheumatologist (arthritis specialist), dietitian, or a 
nurse who specializes in celiac disease. The possibilities are virtually 
limitless.
 
✓ Join a well-managed support group. People participating in a real sup-
port group are less likely to dominate and take over conversations than 
what you find on some online forums. Mind you, we’ve sure seen situ-
ations where a person has taken over the conversation, but it happens 
less often in real support groups than online support groups.
 
✓ Get real, live human support. Sometimes, in moments when you’re 
feeling down, a real hug can feel a heck of a lot better than a cyber-hug. 
(Cyber-hug. Geesh.)
 
Here are a few ways you can find a local support group:
 
✓ Ask your health care provider. Ask your dietitian or celiac disease 
specialist.
 
✓ Look up the listings. If you live in the United States, have a look at the 
state-by-state listings at www.celiac.com or on the Celiac Disease 
Foundation Web site: www.celiac.org/connections.php. You also 
can call them directly (818-990-2354). Other suggestions are listed in 
Appendices A and B.
 
 If you live in Canada, have a look at the Canadian Celiac Association listing 
of affiliated chapters: www.celiac.ca/EnglishCCA/echptr.html.
 
✓ Use an Internet search engine. Use your Internet search engine in the 
same way as would be done if you were looking for a virtual group (see 
the section “Finding an Internet support group,” earlier in this section), 
but add the name of your community to the search request. If you lived 
in, say, Indianapolis, you’d type in “celiac disease support group” and 
“Indianapolis.”

Chapter 2
Celiac Disease and You
In This Chapter
▶ Recognizing what causes celiac disease
▶ Checking out gluten
▶ Digesting how the gut works
▶ Discovering how celiac disease affects your gut
A
s many as 3.3 million people in the U.S. and Canada have celiac 
disease. Unfortunately, many people living with celiac disease don’t 
know they have it. They may not have obvious symptoms (we discuss 
symptoms of celiac disease in Chapter 6), or they may have symptoms for a 
long time and simply become accustomed to living with them. Or sometimes, 
a doctor hasn’t thought of the diagnosis. The list of possibilities is far-reaching.
When celiac disease goes undetected and untreated, it can damage the body 
and even increase the risk of some cancers (see Chapter 9). We hope this 
book helps people recognize when celiac disease may be present so that they 
will know when to speak to their health care provider about the possibility 
of celiac disease — even if it means bringing up the potential diagnosis with 
your doctor. (No doctor is perfect, including ourselves, and no doctor would 
disagree with our stating this as fact.)
Being diagnosed with celiac disease is, in many ways, the start of a journey — 
and a sometimes arduous one at that. In this chapter, we look at questions 
that typically arise after someone has been given the news. Questions like 
“What is celiac disease?” And “What causes it?” And “Why did I get it?” We 
also answer — with apologies to Tina Turner — “What’s gluten got to do 
with it?” Last, we have a look at how your gut works both normally and when 
celiac disease makes it go awry.

24
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
Knowing What Causes Celiac Disease
In order for you to develop celiac disease, several factors must be present. 
(We illustrate these in Figure 2-1 and discuss them in detail in the sections 
that follow this one.) Some of these factors are present from the time of 
conception and several play a role later on in the process. Here are those key 
factors:
 
✓ Genes that put you at risk. In order for you to develop celiac disease, 
you must have something in your genes that puts you at risk of celiac 
disease. Without these “at risk” genes, your risk of getting celiac disease 
is almost nonexistent.
 
✓ A problem with your immune system. To get celiac disease, a specific 
problem within the immune system has to develop in which, after you 
ingest certain types of grain proteins (glutens), your body’s immune 
system behaves abnormally, including making antibodies against some 
of your own tissues. For this reason, celiac disease is classified as an 
autoimmune disease, meaning that the immune system attacks one’s 
own body.
 
✓ Ingestion of gluten. Only the glutens found in some types of grains 
(including wheat, rye, and barley), when ingested, trigger the abnormal 
immune response present in celiac disease. If a person has never eaten 
gluten, they could never get celiac disease. This connection between 
gluten and celiac disease is why celiac disease is treated with a diet that 
does not contain gluten, the so-called gluten-free diet.
 
✓ Increased uptake of gluten by the small intestine. If you have celiac 
disease, a larger amount than normal of gluten gets taken up by the 
small intestine and absorbed into the body. This extra amount of gluten 
amplifies (increases) the abnormal immune response to gluten that we 
mention previously in this list.
 
✓ A damaged small intestine. This results from the abnormal immune 
response to gluten and is the characteristic underlying feature of celiac 
disease.
Medical science doesn’t allow us to change our genes (well, not yet anyhow), 
but free will does allow us to change what we eat. And that is the basic tenet 
of treating celiac disease. By eliminating gluten from your diet, you interrupt 
the processes that we just listed so that the antibodies diminish, the inflam-
mation gradually goes away, and your health is restored. We discuss the 
treatment of celiac disease in detail in Chapter 10.

Genetic influences
Genes are those things found in our cells’ DNA that serve as a blueprint from 
which our body is built and develops. Our genes determine whether we are 
short or tall, blue-eyed or brown-eyed, and so on. Well before medical science 
knew about the specific genes that are associated with celiac disease, it was, 
nevertheless, recognized that celiac disease runs in families. And even within 
families there was additional evidence for a genetic influence because, 
doctors observed, both members within a set of identical twins (who, 
therefore, had the identical genes) were much more likely to have celiac 
disease than were members of a set of non-identical twins (who share only 
half the same genes).
 
Thanks to advances in medicine, a lot is now known about the genetics 
of celiac disease and, in particular, the important role of human leukocyte 
associated (HLA) genes. There are many different types of HLA genes with, 
depending on the type, widely varying roles in how the body functions (or, 
malfunctions, as the case may be). The specific HLA genes involved with 
celiac disease are the DQ genes. (Despite their name, so far as we are aware, 
these genes don’t make one long for soft ice cream; mind you, now that we 
think of it. . . .) 

26
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
Virtually all people with celiac disease have either HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 
genes. Indeed, this association is so strong that if you have neither of these 
genes, you have almost no risk of ever developing celiac disease. Knowing 
this, doctors now use a test to detect HLA DQ2 and DQ8 genes to exclude the 
possibility of celiac disease in certain special situations. We discuss genetic 
testing further in Chapters 3 and 4.
The flip side, however, is not true: since 30 to 40 percent of the North 
American population has these genes, yet only a very small (2 to 3) percent 
of this group develops celiac disease, other factors (including other as yet 
undetermined genetic factors) must be responsible in determining who gets 
celiac disease. We discuss this further in Chapter 16.
The immune system
The immune system is a complex set of cells and organs that protect the body 
from various types of illnesses. A major purpose of the immune system is to 
help fight off bacteria, viruses, parasites, and other infections. The immune 
system also helps get rid of dying cells and cancerous cells within our bodies. 
It seems like every day there emerge a slew of new research findings on the 
incredibly important roles of the immune system in maintaining good health.
However wonderful the immune system is, sometimes, in fact, it does the 
wrong thing and turns against you by attacking your own normal, healthy 
cells. Illnesses in which this behavior is a feature are called autoimmune 
diseases. Examples of autoimmune diseases are systemic lupus erythematosis 
(SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes mellitus (all of which we 
discuss in Chapter 8), and most germane to this book, celiac disease.
Because celiac disease is an immune disease, in this section we look in detail 
at the immune system. Knowing the basics of how the immune system works 
helps you understand what happens when, as with celiac disease, it doesn’t 
function properly. This information can be tough slogging, so we provide 
some handy dandy figures to help illustrate the key points we discuss.
The components of the immune system
The immune system consists of many types of cells and a number of different 
organs. It is made up of two branches:
 
✓ Systemic immune system. Includes organs such as the thymus and the 
spleen, and a variety of types of white blood cells that reside in the 
circulatory system of blood vessels, lymph glands (also known as lymph 
nodes), and lymph channels (that is, the pathways through which lymph 
fluid flows). This system is very important in protecting us against 
infections of the blood and also plays a role in autoimmune diseases.

27
 Chapter 2: Celiac Disease and You
 
✓ Mucosal immune system. Consists of the immune cells present in the 
mucosal surfaces of the body. Mucosal surfaces are the linings of the 
respiratory tract, eyes, nose and sinuses, digestive tract, urinary tract, 
and the reproductive system. The mucosal immune system contains 
immune cells that are important in protecting us from infections of these 
parts of the body.
The immune system has a variety of different types of white blood cells, each 
with their own special function. Here we list some of these and in the next 
section, we discuss what goes wrong when you have celiac disease:
 
✓ T cell lymphocytes (or just T cells for short). Involved in recognizing 
and responding to sick cells, such as cells infected with a virus or 
cancerous cells.
 
✓ B cell lymphocytes. Produce proteins called antibodies. Antibodies can 
attach to tiny molecules called antigens which are present on the surface 
of germs and other substances and allow the body to eliminate them.
 
✓ Neutrophils. Help kill bacteria by releasing enzymes and toxins.
 
✓ Macrophages. Eat (in a manner of speaking) other cells including germs. 
They also act as a delivery service by taking certain proteins (antigens) 
that line the surface of various molecules and bringing them to T cells 
where these lymphocytes can then act on them. (Sort of like an 
underworld boss’s henchmen apprehending someone and bringing them 
to the boss to be worked over.) This is called antigen presentation.
 
✓ Eosinophils. Involved in immune responses to parasites and are also 
important players in controlling the body’s mechanisms associated with 
allergies.
 
✓ Basophils and mast cells. Found either in the blood (basophils) or 
certain body organs including the intestines (mast cells). Their main 
role is in generating an immune response to allergens and to certain 
parasites.
Now that you are armed with this information, we can show you what 
happens with your immune system if you have celiac disease.
The immune response
The immune response is the way in which the immune system reacts when 
exposed to tiny molecules called antigens. It is a wayward immune response 
to antigens that leads to diseases such as allergies and autoimmune diseases 
like celiac disease.

28
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
The role of the T cell
In celiac disease, T cells play the greatest role in the abnormal immune 
response. In the case of celiac disease, glutens are the specific protein to 
which the immune system abnormally responds and thus it is gluten that 
triggers celiac disease. Glutens, which are present in certain foods, enter 
into the mucosal lining of the small intestine where they are then taken up 
by macrophages. Through antigen presentation (see the preceding section, 
“The components of the immune system”), the macrophages “present” these 
foreign proteins to the T cells. The T cells generate an immune response to 
gluten that involves production of inflammatory substances called cytokines 
which damage the intestine.
The role of tissue transglutaminase (TTG)
With celiac disease, excess amounts of gluten enter into the lining of the 
intestine. The gluten then encounters an enzyme called tissue transglutaminase 
(TTG) that has been released from intestinal cells that have already been 
damaged (see the preceding, “The role of the T cell”). When the gluten meets 
up with TTG, a very small piece of the gluten protein is broken off in a process 
known as deamidation. The deamidated gluten tenaciously attaches to and 
stimulates the T cells much more so than regular gluten would. This is the 
last thing in the world you want to happen since it’s the T cells that are 
already causing your gut to get damaged in the first place.
A vicious circle is now created (see Figure 2-2) in which gluten enters the 
lining of your intestine, T cells respond and release cytokines which cause 
damage, this damage leads to more gluten uptake which in turn leads to 
deamidation which stimulates the T cells which causes more cytokines to 
be released which causes more damage which . . . The net result is that the 
lining of your gut comes to resemble a war zone. At present, the only good 
way to bring the war to a halt is removing gluten from the diet. We discuss 
the gluten-free diet in detail in Chapter 10.
Zonulin and celiac disease
Various things in our bodies control how 
well the tight junctions work. Scientists have 
discovered that one such protein, zonulin, plays 
a role in increasing the intestinal permeability 
in celiac disease. It seems that in patients with 
celiac disease, gluten increases the release 
of zonulin from the intestinal cells, thereby 
allowing increased uptake of gluten, which is 
too big to get across the tight junction under 
normal circumstances. This condition is another 
example of how the whole process of events 
leading to intestinal damage in celiac disease 
can get amplified. As we discuss in Chapter 
16, researchers are developing new therapies 
that inhibit zonulin so that increased gluten 
exposure and the resulting immune stimulation 
are quieted down; currently the only available 
therapy is to follow a gluten-free diet (which we 
discuss in Chapter 10).

Increased uptake of gluten 
by the small intestine
The epithelial cells that form the outer-most layer of the small intestine are 
rather brilliant, at least when functioning normally. Like a good parent, they 
know when to hold the line and when to allow things to get by. (Oh, heavens, 
at least we parents try, oh how we try.) In terms of digestion, these cells keep 
germs and other foreigners out of the body while at the same time allowing 
absorption of nutrients into the body.
Many substances are not absorbed into the body through the cells per se, 
but, rather, the miniscule spaces in between the cells. These spaces are 
known as tight junctions (see Figure 2-3). A variety of factors including viral 
infections of the gut, anti-inflammatory medications, and intestinal diseases 
such as celiac disease can cause these tight junctions to be, well, less tight, 
thereby allowing excess amounts and types of substances to gain entry into 
the body. This condition is referred to as leakiness. The increased leakiness 
(also known as increased intestinal permeability) seen with celiac disease is 
one way by which gluten may get a chance to start triggering the abnormal 
immune response which leads to the severe gut inflammation that we 
described in the preceding section.

Environmental factors
Anything apart from factors within our body that may cause illness is 
referred to as an external or environmental factor. As we mention earlier in 
this chapter, many people, although being genetically at risk for getting 
celiac disease, never develop it, which tells doctors that other, environmental 
factors must be responsible for celiac disease. Here are some additional 
clues that environmental factors are involved in celiac disease:
 
✓ Geography. Celiac disease is increasing in frequency in many different 
regions of the world (even though there has not been a surge in the 
number of people in those regions with the HLA DQ2 or DQ8 genes).
 
✓ Age. Celiac disease is showing up less often in children and more often 
in adults. (The average age that people are now being diagnosed with 
celiac disease is over the age of 40, and some people only develop 
problems leading to the diagnosis when into their 80s!)
 
✓ Various forms. Until recently, the great majority of people diagnosed 
with celiac disease had the classical form whereas nowadays most 
people with celiac disease have one of the other forms. (We discuss the 
various forms of celiac disease in Chapter 5.)

31
 Chapter 2: Celiac Disease and You
 
Although consuming gluten leads to the inflammation found in the small 
intestine of people with celiac disease and results in the symptoms and other 
problems that are present, gluten in and of itself does not cause celiac disease. 
Gluten triggers or causes flares of celiac disease in people who are already 
predisposed to the condition.
So then, what is the environmental factor (or factors) that triggers celiac 
disease (in genetically susceptible people)? Alas, the answer is unknown. 
Also unknown are answers to other important questions such as:
 
✓ Why is celiac disease so much more prevalent now compared with 40 
years ago?
 
✓ Whatever the factors responsible, why do they lead to different ages 
when celiac disease shows up?
 
✓ Why do these factors result in such varied ways in which celiac disease 
causes problems?
Although medical science doesn’t have the answers to these questions, 
there’s no shortage of theories. These are potential factors that may play a 
role in why gluten triggers celiac disease:
 
✓ Timing of gluten exposure in infancy. It could be that the timing of 
when babies are first fed gluten-containing foods is an important 
environmental factor leading to celiac disease. Indeed, medical researchers 
consider dietary factors to likely be the most important environmental 
influences. We discuss this in detail in Chapter 14.
 
✓ More gluten in diets. Nowadays people consume more gluten than did 
previous generations. (Through generations of cultivation of grains 
by cross-breeding, agriculture has selected for wheat strains with a 
higher gluten content compared to ancient grains.) It could be that this 
increased gluten exposure to the gut may overwhelm the body’s natural 
defense mechanisms.
 
✓ Excess hygiene. The “hygiene hypothesis” proposes that the increasing 
number of people in industrialized societies with allergic and autoimmune 
diseases (such as celiac disease) are due in part to a relatively sterile 
environment (compared to other or previous societies). People in 
well-off societies have less exposure to germs and have fewer infections; 
the hygiene hypothesis suggests that this factor increases the chances 
of reacting to foods and other proteins in the environment and also to 
one’s own antigens. This situation in turn can increase the chance of 
getting allergies, celiac disease, and other autoimmune diseases.
 
✓ Infections. It could be that during an episode of gastroenteritis (that 
is, an intestinal infection) the inflamed lining of the gut absorbs excess 
quantities of gluten leading to an abnormal immune response which, 
in turn, causes celiac disease. (Although infections remain a possible 
factor in developing celiac disease, this does not seem to explain most 
cases.)

32
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
 
✓ Stomach (gastric) surgery. Sometimes celiac disease shows up after 
patients have part of their stomach removed to treat an ulcer or to help 
severely overweight people lose weight (“bariatric surgery”). Why celiac 
disease shows up in these instances is unknown. Given the relative 
rarity of stomach surgery in people who later develop celiac disease, 
clearly this would be a factor in only a tiny proportion of cases.
 
✓ Stress. Various kinds of stress can influence many diseases, but typically 
by making a condition (such as high blood pressure) worse, rather than 
actually causing the condition to develop in the first place. Current 
medical research does not support previously held notions that stress is 
a cause of celiac disease; however, stress can make symptoms worse.
Examining Gluten
Almost everything humans eat is made from various types of proteins, 
carbohydrates, and fats. When considering celiac disease, the most 
important of these nutrients to know about is a protein called gluten. Gluten 
is a general name for the various storage proteins (also known as prolamins) 
found in grains. (Storage proteins are those proteins in grains available to 
provide nutrients for their future growth in the field.) Ingesting gluten 
triggers celiac disease and thus, gluten needs to be avoided if you have this 
condition.
When we were in medical school, way back when, we learned an acronym to 
remember the four major grains that were thought to trigger celiac disease: 
BROW, which stood for barley, rye, oats, and wheat. Things have changed a 
bit since then, and, as we discuss in the following sections, oats are no longer 
considered a trigger for most patients — which means, now that we’ve lost a 
vowel, we’re looking for a new acronym to use to teach to our own students!
As we discuss in Chapter 1, a Dutch physician observed that during World 
War II, when wheat was not available, previously ill children became healthier 
(and became ill again after wheat’s reappearance after the end of the war). 
This keen observation led to the eventual determination that celiac disease is 
triggered by exposure to gluten, which is a component of wheat and certain 
other grains.
 
Because the term “gluten” refers to a variety of different proteins, you may see 
it written in its plural form: glutens. However, most commonly it is used in the 
singular form.

33
 Chapter 2: Celiac Disease and You
Knowing where gluten is found
Gluten is present in many different types of foods and is also found in many 
commercial products (even including some medicines!). Until not too long 
ago it was very difficult to know if something did or did not contain gluten, 
but today, food and product labels typically reveal this information. Food 
labels don’t always indicate whether a food or product contains gluten, 
however. We discuss this and other gluten-free food and product issues in 
detail in Chapter 10. In this section, we list some commonly consumed foods 
and whether or not they contain gluten.
These foods (unless specially prepared to be gluten-free) typically contain 
gluten:
Breads and other baked products
Prepared soups
Cereals
Salad dressings
Pastas
Snack foods and chocolate bars
Prepared meats (such as hot dogs, 
hamburgers, deli meats)
These foods in their native state do not contain gluten (and can be referred to 
as naturally gluten-free):
Cheese
Nuts
Eggs
Seeds
Fish
Unprocessed meat
Fruits
Vegetables
Legumes
Wine and spirits
Milk
Yogurt
Getting a handle on grains
Grains (cereals) are a major food staple in the human diet throughout the 
world. Not only are grains a key component of what we eat, grains have 
helped dictate how society has evolved. The ability to grow various 
foodstuffs — particularly grains — allowed and promoted the transition from 
hunter-gatherer societies to increasingly large and communal agricultural-based 
societies.

34
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
Wheat, barley, and rye
Wheat is the major cereal grain consumed in many parts of the world, 
including North America and, because wheat contains gluten, wheat is most 
responsible for triggering celiac disease in people living in these regions. 
Gluten found in wheat has two main components:
 
✓ Gliadins. Responsible for dough’s viscosity (thickness) and ability to be 
stretched. More important, in terms of celiac disease, it is the gliadins 
within gluten that are the specific trigger for celiac disease.
 
✓ Glutenins. Responsible for dough’s cohesiveness (tendency to stick 
together), strength, and elasticity.
The attributes of the gluten found in wheat (as we note in the preceding list) 
make wheat useful for making bread and also explains why making bread 
with gluten-free flours is difficult. We discuss the difficulty of gluten-free 
bread-making further in Chapter 10.
Barley contains a specific form of gluten known as hordein. Because barley 
contains gluten, it must be avoided by people with celiac disease.
Rye contains a specific form of gluten known as secalin. Because rye contains 
gluten, it, too, must be avoided by people with celiac disease.
Triticale is a blend of wheat and rye and is also to be avoided if you have 
celiac disease.
What about oats?
At one time, the consensus was that oats could trigger celiac disease, but a 
large number of studies in adults and children have now demonstrated that 
oats can, in fact, be safely consumed by people with celiac disease. There is, 
however, a but. Only pure oats are safe to eat if you have celiac disease and, 
until recently, food manufacturers seldom made products comprised only of 
oats. (The plants mill oats in the same facility as gluten-containing grains.) 
Fortunately, things have changed in some mills and pure oat-containing food 
products are now carried in many specialty food stores and even larger grocery 
store chains. We include a list of brands of pure oats in Appendix A, as well 
as information on how to order these products.
We do need to add one caveat to our ‘pure oats are okay to eat’ comment. 
Some research suggests that a very small number of people with celiac 
disease do, in fact, react to even pure oats.

35
 Chapter 2: Celiac Disease and You
 
The current consensus among celiac disease experts (based on quite a few 
very good scientific studies as well as clinical experience showing oats to be 
well tolerated by both adults and children living with celiac disease) is that if 
you have treated celiac disease and uneventfully eat pure oat-containing 
foods, well, enjoy them. On the other hand, if you’re having problems handling 
pure oats, it may be best to discontinue consuming any and all oat products 
and consult your dietitian and physician for further advice.
Getting a grip on other grains
Most people are familiar with barley, rye, and wheat, however there are a 
number of other, less well known grains. Some of these contain gluten and 
therefore need to be avoided; others do not contain gluten and therefore can 
be safely consumed.
These are grains that contain gluten and must be avoided:
Bulgur
Farro
Couscous
Kamut
Durum
Semolina
Einkorn
Spelt (Dinkel)
Emmer
Triticale
Farina
These are grains that do not contain gluten and are safe to eat:
Amaranth
Nut flours (almond, hazelnut, pecan)
Arrowroot
Quinoa
Buckwheat (kasha)
Potato flour, potato starch
Corn
Rice flour, rice bran
Flax
Sorghum
Indian ricegrass (Montina)
Soybean
Legume flours (bean, garbanzo bean, 
lentil, pea)
Sweet potato 
flour
Mesquite flour
Tapioca (cassava, manioc)
Millet
Teff

Comparing Celiac Disease, Food Allergy, 
and Food Intolerance
In order to explain why they are on a special diet, many people with celiac 
disease understandably (and perfectly reasonably) try to make things easier 
for their friends, coworkers, and restaurant staff by just saying they are 
“allergic to wheat” rather than describing in detail what their condition is all 
about. Although saying you are allergic to wheat is perfectly fine (and indeed, 
this is what Sheila’s husband — who lives with celiac disease and has a PhD 
in immunology — often says), the statement is not perfectly accurate.
As we mention earlier in this chapter, celiac disease is an autoimmune 
disease, meaning that your immune system has turned against — and is 
attacking — your own, healthy tissues. Autoimmune diseases, including 
celiac disease, typically cause chronic problems, not sudden, life-threatening 
crises. Food allergies are caused by a different problem with the immune 
system and can indeed lead to immediate catastrophic situations. A food 
intolerance (such as lactose intolerance, which we discuss in detail in 
Chapter 11), on the other hand, is not related to the immune system and, 
although it leads at times to unpleasant symptoms, is not life-threatening in 
nature. We illustrate the key differences between these three conditions in 
Table 2-1.

37
 Chapter 2: Celiac Disease and You
 
Technically speaking, a food allergy is a special type of immune reaction 
(called an immediate hypersensitivity reaction) that involves immune system 
cells called basophils and mast cells (these are special types of white blood 
cells involved with the body’s allergic response and certain other conditions). 
An immediate hypersensitivity reaction results, upon exposure to a certain 
stimulus, in the immediate release into the bloodstream of a substance called 
histamine, which causes instantaneous — and sometimes life-threatening — 
symptoms such as shortness of breath, a swollen tongue, and a skin rash 
(hives). Perhaps you know people who are allergic to peanuts. They have this 
type of food allergy. People can also be allergic to wheat, which is different 
from celiac disease because the reactions to wheat are immediate and cause 
problems with breathing, hives, and swelling of the mouth and lips. Unlike in 
celiac disease, wheat does not cause intestinal damage in people with wheat 
allergy.
As you know from your own experiences living with celiac disease (or living 
with someone who has celiac disease), this is entirely different from what 
happens if a person with celiac disease consumes a gluten-containing food 
(such as wheat) in which case, such instantaneous, life-threatening symptoms 
don’t occur. Although, as we discuss elsewhere in this chapter (see “What 
goes wrong when you have celiac disease”), the immune system plays a role 
in celiac disease, it is of an entirely different nature.
The one exception to celiac disease and food intolerance being unrelated is 
if you have newly diagnosed and therefore untreated celiac disease in which 
case you may have temporary lactose intolerance. We discuss lactose 
intolerance in greater detail in Chapter 11.
Understanding How the Normal 
Digestive Process Works
Digestion is the process of breaking down foods and then absorbing their 
nutrients into our bodies. The digestive process involves a variety of organs 
(see Figure 2-4), each with their own special roles in helping transform the 
foods and liquids you consume into nutrients that are absorbed into the body 
and waste products that you excrete from your body. The organs involved 
with digestion are the
 
✓ Gastrointestinal (GI) tract
 
✓ Liver
 
✓ Pancreas

38
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
In this section we look at how each of these organs assists with digestion.
 
Figure 2-4: 
The 
digestive 
system.
 
What a piece of work is man (and woman)
Like many people, we marvel at the incredibly 
complex functioning of the most sophisticated 
computer in existence, the human brain. And, 
like many others, we also marvel at how, over 
a lifetime, the human heart will pump 3 billion 
times and a person’s kidneys will filter 1 million 
gallons of blood. Mind boggling numbers 
indeed. But, equally incredible, although not 
getting nearly so much glory, is the work that 
our digestive system does as, over a lifetime, it 
looks after over 100 tons (200,000 pounds; about 
91,000 kg) of food and liquid you’ve swallowed! 
(In case you’re wondering — and we suspect 
you aren’t — that’s equivalent to eating 20 
elephants or, less tasty we presume, 10 city 
buses, not, ahem, including passengers.)

39
 Chapter 2: Celiac Disease and You
Getting down the gastrointestinal tract
Since digestion starts — and finishes — in the gastrointestinal tract (the 
“gut”) let’s begin our journey here.
Normal anatomy of the gastrointestinal tract
The GI tract starts with the mouth where food and liquids enter the body and 
ends at the anus where the wastes of what we eat — along with other things 
like dead bacteria and cells that line the gut — exit as stool. (Stool is the 
medical term for a bowel movement. Last time we checked — clearly we had 
too much time on our hands — there were well over 50 non-medical synonyms 
for stool, many of which you may have some familiarity with, but of course 
we wouldn’t know.)
For the purposes of discussion, the GI tract can be divided into three sections:
 
✓ Mouth
 
✓ Esophagus and stomach
 
✓ Small intestine and large intestine (including the rectum)
In the following sections, we look — figuratively speaking — into each of 
these parts of your anatomy.
Looking at what the mouth, esophagus, and stomach do 
The main job of the mouth is to chew food so it can then be swallowed. The 
mouth accomplishes this feat by using the teeth, tongue, and saliva (produced 
by the salivary glands):
 
✓ Teeth. Help you chew food down into small pieces that are more easily 
swallowed.
 
✓ Tongue. Allows you to taste the food you eat; if something tastes good 
you are, of course, more likely to ingest it (and thus, derive nourishment 
from it).
 
✓ Saliva. Aids in the digestive process, both by moistening food (which 
makes it easier to swallow) and by initiating breakdown of food through 
the action of saliva’s digestive enzymes. We further discuss the role of 
digestive enzymes in the section, “What the pancreas and liver do.”
When you swallow, food moves from your mouth into your esophagus. The 
esophagus is a flexible, muscular tube (conduit) through which the food 
passes as it travels from your mouth into your stomach.

40
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
The stomach is a workhorse. This muscular organ helps digest food in 
two ways:
 
✓ Churning food. Repeated, forceful, contractions, which turns food into 
smaller pieces.
 
✓ Producing acid. Helps break down proteins and other food components.
It takes up to several hours for the contents of the stomach to empty (into 
the small intestine) after a regular meal.
Recognizing the importance of the small intestine
Since celiac disease causes most of its havoc by damaging the small intestine, we 
look at this organ in detail. In this section, we discuss the features of a healthy 
small intestine and later in this chapter (see “Knowing What Goes Wrong When 
You Have Celiac Disease”), we look at abnormalities that can develop.
The small intestine (also known as the small bowel) is a long, coiled tube 
that, if stretched end to end, would measure 21 feet. (Please don’t try this 
at home!) The small intestine is the most vital part of the digestive process 
because this is where virtually all nutrients are extracted from food. The 
small intestine also helps regulate the body’s fluid balance since it is 
responsible for absorbing most of the fluids we drink along with those 
produced by the digestive tract, totaling about 6 to 8 liters a day. You cannot 
survive without your small intestine, and if this part of the digestive tract is 
damaged or partially removed, then you are at risk of malnutrition and 
dehydration depending how much small intestine function you are missing.
The small intestine consists of three sections (see Figure 2-5):
 
✓ Duodenum. The first part of the small intestine, the duodenum measures 
just under 1 foot in length (the jejunum and ileum are each considerably 
longer). The very first part of the duodenum is called the duodenal 
bulb. The stomach empties its contents into the duodenum. Digestive 
enzymes made in the pancreas and bile made in the liver empty through 
a duct into the duodenum. Iron and calcium are some of the few nutrients 
that are absorbed into the body from this part of the small intestine.
 
✓ Jejunum. The jejunum is the second part. The jejunum absorbs the 
major food components including proteins (in the form of small molecules 
like peptides and amino acids), carbohydrates (as small sugars such as 
glucose), fats (as triglycerides), and a variety of vitamins and minerals.
 
✓ Ileum. The third part of the small intestine, the ileum plays a role in 
absorbing vitamin B-12 and bile salts, which are important in fat 
absorption. The very last part of the ileum is, unfortunately, called the 
“terminal ileum.” Why unfortunate? Because we know of at least one 
patient who — egads — took this term to mean they had a terminal 
illness of their ileum! (Terminal, in the case of the ileum, simply means 
“the end” as in train terminal, or bus terminal.)

The small intestine has millions of small, finger-like projections called villi 
that extend inward from the lining of the small intestine and greatly increase 
the amount of surface area available to interact with food and extract 
nutrients (see Figure 2-6). (Villi increase surface area of the small intestine in 
much the same way that the many branches on a tree increase the amount of 
a tree’s surface area compared to having one long trunk.)
The villi, in turn, are lined by even smaller projections called microvilli (also 
shown in Figure 2-6). Microvilli help with digestion because they further 
increase the surface area in the small intestine and also, they contain many 
digestive enzymes. Because microvilli are numerous and are packed closely 
together like a hair brush with many densely packed bristles, the microvilli 
form what is called a brush-border.

Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
The villi and microvilli increase the absorptive surface of the small intestine 
to the equivalent size of a tennis court! Gotta love that.
Knowing what the large intestine and rectum do
The large intestine (also known as the colon) is the wide, 5 foot long part of 
the gastrointestinal tract that connects the small intestine to the anus. The 
colon turns about 1 to 2 quarts of very liquid bowel contents it receives from 
the ileum into about one-third of a quart of solid stool each day. Prior to 
defecation (having a bowel movement), stool is stored toward the end of the 
large intestine, an area called the sigmoid (sigmoid means “s shaped”) colon. 
Just prior to defecating, stool passes from the sigmoid colon into the very 
last part of the large intestine: the rectum. It is the presence of stool in the 
rectum that gives one the urge to go to the bathroom. The very last part of 
the process is the subsequent passage of stool from the rectum through the 
anus into the toilet (latrine, diaper . . .).
 
Although lots of people think the only normal pattern is passing a stool once 
a day, the normal range is actually anywhere from two or three a day down to 
three times a week.
Understanding what the 
pancreas and liver do
The pancreas is a 10-inch long organ located in the upper part of the abdomen 
and behind the stomach. The pancreas produces digestive enzymes that 
travel down a duct from the pancreas and empty into the duodenum. These 
enzymes break down foods into microscopic sizes which then allows them 
to be absorbed into the body across the lining of the small intestine 
(primarily the jejunum). The other essential function of the pancreas is to 
produce hormones such as insulin that help to control metabolism. These 
hormones are released from the pancreas directly into the blood. (In the case 
of insulin, this hormone helps regulate blood glucose; having insufficient 
insulin causes diabetes.)
The liver produces bile which is transported through the bile ducts into the 
small intestine where it helps digest fats. Bile can be stored in the gallbladder 
which acts as a reservoir of bile between meals.

 Chapter 2: Celiac Disease and You
Knowing What Goes Wrong When 
You Have Celiac Disease
In the previous sections, we look in detail at the normal anatomy and functioning 
of the digestive system. In the following sections, we look at the small intestinal 
abnormalities that are present in celiac disease. (The remainder of the 
digestive system is typically unaffected.) We can group these into two 
categories: abnormalities of structure and abnormalities of function.
Changes to the structure 
of the small intestine
The beautifully intricate and elegant structure of the small intestine (sure, we 
know it’s only your bowel, but hey, bowels can be beautiful, in their own 
special way) is the very first thing to be injured if you have celiac disease. 
With celiac disease, the duodenum and jejunum are always damaged; the 
ileum, however, is not usually affected. These are the stages in which damage 
to the small intestine happens after gluten exposure:
 
1. White blood cells, called lymphocytes (these are part of the immune 
system), accumulate in abnormal numbers in the tips of the small 
intestine’s villi. Because of their location in the surface layer (epithelial 
layer) of the small intestine, these lymphocytes are called intra-epithelial 
lymphocytes or IELs.
 
2. The spaces (crypts) below the villi become proportionately longer 
(something called crypt hyperplasia).
 
3. The villi become shorter, or blunted, which is known as partial villous 
atrophy. (Partial because the blunting is not complete. Atrophy means 
“wasting away” or shrinking.)
 
4. The villi become so severely damaged that they are completely 
flattened; this condition is called total villous atrophy.
Figure 2-7 illustrates the various stages of intestinal damage in celiac disease.

Changes to the function 
of the small intestine
In the section, “Recognizing the importance of the small intestine” we 
discuss the importance to digestion of the huge surface area provided to the 
small intestine by the millions of villi (and microvilli). As you might expect, 
because celiac disease causes these villi to shrink — sometimes to the point 
of not even being identifiable — and because significant inflammation is now 
present in the small intestine, this organ’s ability to function is severely 
compromised. Problems with small intestine function may include:
 
✓ Reduced ability to absorb fluids (and increased fluid production by the 
small intestine), which, if sufficiently severe, results in diarrhea.
 
✓ Malabsorption of important minerals (such as iron and calcium) and 
vitamins (such as vitamin D, vitamin K, and folic acid). Malabsorption 
can lead to anemia, osteoporosis, and other ailments.
 
✓ Malabsorption of nutrients such as protein, which in turn may lead to 
progressive weight loss.
We discuss these and other potential complications from celiac disease in 
Chapters 6, 7, 8, and 9. Now, lest you feel overwhelmed and discouraged by 
the problems we’ve pointed out in this chapter, be sure to read Part III of this 
book because that’s where you’ll find out what you need to know to correct 
these problems or avoid them in the first place.

C
eliac disease affects about one percent of the North American population, 
although only a small fraction of this group has actually been diagnosed 
with celiac disease. Indeed, about 90 percent of people with celiac disease 
either don’t know they have it or, in some cases, , are suspected to have it 
(and are treated for it) without first having objective confirmation of the 
diagnosis with appropriate testing. (As we discuss later in this chapter, 
we recommend against treating celiac disease unless the diagnosis is first 
proven.)
A key reason that so many people with celiac disease are undiagnosed is 
that, as we discuss in Chapter 6, the symptoms of celiac disease frequently 
occur with other, more common ailments and, common things being 
common, are attributed (by patients and doctors alike) to one or more of 
these other conditions. Fortunately, both health care providers and people 
in general are becoming more aware of celiac disease and, as a result, celiac 
disease is now being looked for more often.
In this chapter we discuss what should be done once the suspicion first 
arises that you have celiac disease. In particular, we look at the tests that 
should be done to determine whether you do or do not have it.

46
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
Figuring Out Whether You 
Have Celiac Disease
In order to figure out whether you have celiac disease, your doctor typically 
follows four steps:
 
1. Learns about your symptoms.
 
 If you’ve been diagnosed with celiac disease, you probably recall having 
had symptoms of one sort or another that ultimately led you to see your 
doctor who then interviewed you to learn more about how you were 
feeling. “Taking a history” is always the first step that doctors follow in 
figuring out what may be the cause of a patient’s symptoms.
 
2. Examines you.
 
 The second step in determining whether you have celiac disease is a 
physical examination in which the doctor measures your weight, 
looks at your skin, feels your abdomen, and looks for other physical 
abnormalities that can be seen with this ailment.
 
3. Orders blood tests.
 
 We hope that you notice that we discuss blood tests only all the way 
down in Step 3. Medical tests are always complementary to the essential 
information that a doctor learns from talking to you and examining you.
 
4. Sends you for an endoscopy and small intestinal biopsy.
 
 Although the preceding steps are essential, ultimately a doctor can only 
diagnose you as having celiac disease if you first have an endoscopy and 
small intestinal biopsy with the latter being interpreted by the pathologist 
as showing the appropriate features of the condition.
The rest of this chapter discusses each of these steps in detail.
Understanding the Importance 
of Symptoms
If the retail business world is all about “location, location, location,” the 
world of medicine is all about “history, history, history.” By medical history, 
we don’t mean the balms and salves of ancient Rome, but rather, history in 
the sense of what a patient tells a doctor. Ninety percent of a diagnosis is 
based not on a physical examination or laboratory testing but on the story 
you relate when you meet with your physician. (That’s why medical students 
are taught to pay great attention to listening to patients; in medical circles, 
this practice is called “taking a good history.”)

47
 Chapter 3: Diagnosing Celiac Disease
A key part of the history is reviewing what symptoms you are experiencing. As 
we discuss in Chapter 6, some symptoms are considered classical of celiac 
disease. These include complaints like diarrhea, weight loss, abdominal 
discomfort, and really smelly gas and bowel movements (worse than other 
people’s, if that’s possible!), and, in children, failure to grow normally.
Your doctor doesn’t need to be the dean of Harvard Medical School to think 
of celiac disease when these are the complaints; however, as we review in 
Chapter 6, many people with celiac disease instead have other, more subtle GI 
symptoms that point less obviously toward this condition as their cause. Other 
people who are eventually found to have celiac disease may have few or even 
no GI symptoms, but rather, have seemingly unrelated (to celiac disease) 
complaints like fatigue, depression, or muscle and joint aches and pains.
Until the past 5 to 10 years, the classical form of celiac disease (see Chapter 5) 
was largely what led patients, families, friends, and doctors to think of celiac 
disease, but today, people increasingly recognize that these other, less 
obvious symptoms can be due to celiac disease. For this reason, doctors and 
other health care providers have to be alert to the possibility that a person’s 
symptoms may be due to celiac disease.
 
If you are not yet diagnosed with celiac disease but are experiencing the 
symptoms we discuss here and in Chapter 6, ask your health care provider 
if these might be due to celiac disease. Who knows; you may be the one 
that first sets the wheels in motion leading to discovering your own as yet 
undiscovered diagnosis.
Knowing What to Expect from 
the Physical Examination
Although the history is a very important part of a medical visit, an examination 
of your body (a physical examination) is also necessary to help make a 
diagnosis. Here are some of the things your doctor will check and what your 
doctor is trying to find:
 
✓ Weight and height: By knowing your weight and height, your doctor can 
calculate your body mass index (BMI), which indicates whether you are 
underweight, of normal weight, or overweight.
 
 A normal BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9. If you are underweight this may 
be a sign that you are not absorbing nutrients from your food properly 
as is often the case if you have celiac disease. (On the other hand, 
as we discuss in Chapter 6, many people with celiac disease aren’t 
underweight or losing weight; in fact you can have celiac disease and, 
like most North Americans, be overweight, even considerably so.) You 

48
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
can determine your own BMI by using an online tool such as the one 
available at www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi.
 
 Measuring a child’s height is especially important because if a child is 
shorter than his or her peer group or has stopped growing normally, 
these may be clues that the child also has a nutrient absorption problem 
like celiac disease.
 
✓ Blood pressure and heart rate: Having low blood pressure and a 
rapid heart beat can signify a number of different ailments, including 
dehydration (as you may experience if your celiac disease has resulted 
in profound diarrhea). A rapid heart beat (without low blood pressure) 
can also be seen with celiac disease complications or associated 
conditions such as anemia (see Chapter 7) or hyperthyroidism (Chapter 8).
 
✓ Skin: Celiac disease can be associated with a skin condition called 
dermatitis herpetiformis (see Chapter 8). Also, paleness may indicate you 
are anemic (Chapter 7).
 
✓ Mouth: As we discuss in Chapter 7, celiac disease can be associated with 
oral health issues such as mouth ulcers.
 
✓ Abdomen: When your doctor examines your abdomen, this is to 
determine if it causes you discomfort, if your belly is soft or firm, if it 
is distended, and if there is evidence of enlargement of your internal 
organs.
 
✓ Arms and legs: Because celiac disease can affect the muscles and 
nerves in your extremities, your doctor will examine your arms and legs. 
Also, dermatitis herpetiformis (see the previous bullet about skin 
abnormalities) can cause skin changes on your extremities.
 
✓ Rectal exam: We saved this for the, ahem, end. A rectal exam is not 
done all the time but is part of a complete examination for many 
digestive conditions.
Getting Blood Tests
Although the history and physical examination are invaluable tools in figuring 
out whether you have celiac disease, in and of themselves they are not 
sufficient to establish a diagnosis, and you will need to have certain tests 
done. In most medical conditions, including celiac disease, the first tests to 
be done are blood tests.
You will be sent for blood tests for two main reasons:

49
 Chapter 3: Diagnosing Celiac Disease
 
✓ To help determine if you may have celiac disease. The two main types 
of blood tests that can help diagnose celiac disease are:
 
• Antibody tests (also called serologic tests or serology). These are 
virtually always done.
 
• Genetic tests. These are not done routinely but are now being 
more commonly ordered than in the past, partly because such 
tests are now more readily available. (Until relatively recently, only 
special laboratories performed these tests.)
 
✓ To look for evidence of complications from or associated with celiac 
disease. For example, blood tests may reveal that you are anemic, 
malnourished, dehydrated, or have evidence of liver injury. See 
Chapters 7 and 8 for more information on the complications from or 
associated with celiac disease.
In the remainder of this section, we look in detail at the various blood tests 
that are performed to help figure out whether you have celiac disease.
Antibody tests
 
Antibodies (abbreviated as Abs if plural, Ab if discussing just one) are special 
proteins called immunoglobulins (abbreviated as Ig) produced by certain white 
blood cells in our body. The body forms antibodies most commonly in response 
to — and to fight off — infections caused by germs like viruses and bacteria. (To 
discover more about the immune system, have a look at Chapter 2.)
Having antibodies to help us battle an infection is essential, but sometimes 
the immune system makes antibodies that are not only unhelpful, but are 
actually harmful. Conditions in which the body makes antibodies that attack 
a person’s own tissues are called autoimmune diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis 
is an example of an autoimmune disease. In this condition, antibodies attack 
the joints.
Celiac disease is also an autoimmune disease, but in addition to making 
antibodies against one’s own tissues, people with celiac disease also make 
antibodies to gluten which is a protein found in wheat and some other grains.
Medical scientists don’t really know why celiac disease is associated with 
the various antibodies that are found with this condition, but knowing if they 
are present remains very helpful in making (or excluding) the diagnosis, as 
we look at next. In the next few sections, we look at the antibody tests that 
are used to diagnose celiac disease; following that discussion, we summarize 
how your health care provider can then use this information to help determine 
whether you may have celiac disease.

50
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
Tissue transglutaminase antibody
Tissue transglutaminase is a protein found in nearly all the body’s tissues. If 
you have celiac disease, you form tissues transglutaminase (TTG) antibodies 
against this protein. (Two types of TTG antibody are formed: TTG IgA and 
TTG IgG. Most laboratories test for TTG IgA; only select laboratories have the 
ability to test for TTG IgG; see the later section “The issue of IgA deficiency” 
for information on when TTG IgG test is recommended.)
The TTG IgA test is the single most important blood test you should have 
done if your doctor suspects you have celiac disease. As we discuss in 
Chapter 2, in celiac disease, gluten ingestion activates the immune system 
and leads to damage to the lining of the small intestine. Because TTG IgA is 
present in most people with celiac disease, doctors routinely look for TTG 
IgA if they suspect a patient has celiac disease.
 
Even though TTG IgA is a particularly important test in diagnosing celiac 
disease, because it can also be present in some other conditions (such as liver 
disease, congestive heart failure, and other autoimmune diseases), its presence 
does not guarantee you have celiac disease and does not preclude the need 
for a small intestinal biopsy.
In addition to helping doctors diagnose celiac disease, measuring your TTG 
IgA is also helpful in monitoring your condition. As we discuss in Chapter 
15, as you remain on track with your gluten-free diet, your TTG IgA level will 
return to normal. If, on the other hand, it remains elevated, this indicates that 
most likely your gut is still being exposed to gluten, and your diet needs to be 
reviewed to determine how this is happening.
 
Different laboratories have different methods and, as a result, different normal 
ranges for many tests including TTG IgA levels. For this reason, in order to 
ensure apples are being compared to apples, if you need your TTG IgA test 
redone, it is best to go back to the same lab that did your earlier TTG IgA test.
Endomysial antibody
Endomysial antibody (EMA) is an antibody that, like TTG antibodies, targets 
the protein, tissue transglutaminase.
EMA testing used to be commonly performed, but because TTG antibody 
testing tells us similar information, is (a bit) more accurate, is more readily 
available, and is less expensive to perform, EMA studies are now ordered 
much less often.
One additional problem with the EMA test is that sometimes it can be normal 
even in people who have celiac disease; a situation doctors refer to as a “false 
negative” test result. As you can imagine, this can be very misleading as it 
could cause your celiac disease diagnosis to be overlooked. (Although the 
TTG antibody test — covered in the preceding section — can also be falsely 
negative, this false result occurs less often.)

51
 Chapter 3: Diagnosing Celiac Disease
The endomysial antibody is, however, very helpful in one significant way: 
If your result is positive (that is, if you have this antibody present in your 
blood), it virtually guarantees that you do, in fact, have celiac disease.
Gliadin antibody
As we discuss in Chapter 2, gliadin is the component of gluten that is the 
major trigger of celiac disease. Antibodies to gliadin are called antigliadin 
antibodies (AGA).
Because AGA testing is not nearly as accurate as the TTG antibody test in 
diagnosing celiac disease — it has both frequent false positive (meaning that 
the test is abnormal but the person being tested doesn’t have celiac disease) 
and false negative results — the test is now seldom ordered. The exception 
to this is in young children where AGA IgA testing is sometimes helpful for 
diagnosis and monitoring the response to a gluten-free diet as we discuss in 
Chapter 15.
Other antibody tests
Until a few years ago, some laboratories included another antibody test as 
part of their testing for celiac disease. That test detected antibodies to 
reticulin, a protein found in many body tissues, including the intestine. The 
reason that this test is no longer recommended is that it was not very 
accurate, having both high false positive and false negative rates.
Medical researchers are trying to find new antibody tests or combinations of 
antibody tests that may be more accurate than the currently available tests 
to both diagnose celiac disease and to rule out a diagnosis of celiac disease. 
In your Internet travels, you may come across one such test: antibodies to 
a protein called actin. Unfortunately, so far, anti-actin antibodies have not 
proven to be as helpful as initially thought.
Deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies
Recently, researchers have discovered that 
patients with active celiac disease have 
antibodies to a form of gliadin that has been 
modified by the tissue transglutaminase 
enzyme. This form of gliadin is referred to as 
deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP). Studies thus 
far show that IgA and IgG antibodies to DGP are 
very good at detecting celiac disease, but more 
studies need to be done, and these blood tests 
are not as yet widely used.

52
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
The issue of IgA deficiency
People make five types of antibodies (immunoglobulins): IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG 
and IgM. IgA is the major type of antibody made by the immune cells in the 
lining of the digestive tract. About 1 in 500 to 700 otherwise healthy people 
do not make IgA; this condition is known as IgA deficiency. As we discuss in 
Chapter 8, patients with IgA deficiency are at increased risk of infections of 
their respiratory and digestive tracts.
For some reason, patients with celiac disease are more likely to have IgA 
deficiency. This fact is important because if you are IgA deficient, some of the 
key tests that doctors order to figure out whether you have celiac disease 
(such as the tests we discuss in the previous few sections) may be normal 
even if, in fact, you do have celiac disease. This is because if you do not have 
the ability to make IgA, you will make neither normal, healthy IgA antibodies 
(such as those to fight off infections of the respiratory and digestive tracts) 
nor the abnormal IgA antibodies (such as TTG antibodies) that are seen with 
celiac disease.
To get around the problem of diagnosing celiac disease when you have IgA 
deficiency you can have a type of TTG antibody test other than the one 
typically used. The usual TTG test is for TTG IgA, which you will not have if 
you are IgA deficient. The TTG antibody test your doctor may order if you are 
IgA deficient is the TTG IgG test. This test is not available in all laboratories, 
however. Another option is to check your DGP IgG level (see the accompanying 
sidebar “Deamidated gliadin peptide antibodies”).
A stepwise approach to using antibody tests to 
help diagnose (or rule out) celiac disease
If your physician suspects that you have celiac disease, in the majority of 
cases, antibody tests will be ordered. In some instances, as discussed in the 
next section, genetic testing may also be requested. Because of its accuracy, 
the preferred antibody test is the TTG antibody. (Most laboratories, as we 
mention in the preceding section, “Tissue transglutaminase antibody,” 
perform the TTG IgA antibody.)
Looking specifically at your TTG IgA result:
 
✓ If your TTG IgA result comes back positive (that is, you have the TTG 
IgA antibody). This result indicates a sufficiently strong probability 
of celiac disease that the next step is typically to proceed directly to a 
biopsy of your small intestine (as we discuss later in this chapter).
 
✓ If your TTG IgA result comes back negative (that is, you do not have 
the TTG IgA antibody). Your doctor needs to ensure the negative result 
isn’t because you have IgA deficiency and, therefore, will send you for an 
IgA level if this was not already checked. What happens next depends on 
whether your IgA level is normal or low:

53
 Chapter 3: Diagnosing Celiac Disease
 
• Normal. IgA deficiency is excluded, your negative TTG IgA result is 
in keeping with a very low likelihood of celiac disease, and further 
testing for celiac disease is usually unnecessary unless your 
particular situation is so very suspicious for celiac disease that, 
despite these negative test results, you still require additional 
tests — such as an endoscopy and small intestine biopsy — to 
be as definitive as possible whether you do or do not have celiac 
disease. (An example of this situation might be a man or a post-
menopausal woman who is iron deficient and for whom there is no 
evidence of bleeding.)
 
• Low. You likely have IgA deficiency, and your negative TTG IgA 
result may be on this basis rather than the absence of celiac 
disease. Therefore, additional testing is required. If available, the 
next step is usually to measure your TTG IgG level or your DGP IgG 
level. If either of these are positive (or if neither are available), the 
next step is typically to proceed with a small intestine biopsy. If 
this is negative then the probability of you having celiac disease 
is very low and further testing for celiac disease is typically 
unnecessary.
 
To spare patients extra trips to the lab, a doctor may order an IgA level at the 
same time as ordering a TTG IgA level. The downside to doing both tests at 
the same time is the extra cost involved.
In Figure 3-1, we illustrate schematically the usual diagnostic steps that are 
performed when your doctor suspects you have celiac disease. You will 
notice that the final common pathway in order to make a diagnosis of celiac 
disease is an endoscopy and small intestine biopsy. At present, as helpful as 
blood tests are, none exists that is sufficiently accurate, in and of themselves, 
to diagnose celiac disease.
Genetic testing
As we discuss in Chapter 2, you need to have the right (or, perhaps one could 
say, the wrong) genes in order for celiac disease to develop. Because virtually 
all people with celiac disease have the HLA DQ2 or DQ8 genes, if tests show 
you do not have either of these genes, the likelihood that you will ever develop 
celiac disease is remote. In contrast, having one or even both of these genes 
does not mean you have or will later develop celiac disease. In fact, most (97 to 
98 percent) people with these genes do not have celiac disease.
Medical scientists estimate that having the HLA DQ2 or DQ8 genes accounts 
for about 40 percent of the risk of getting celiac disease, which means many 
other factors exist that lead to celiac disease as we discussed in Chapter 2. 
Scientists are working to discover other genes that are necessary for 
developing celiac disease. We discuss the work that scientists are doing in 
this field in Chapter 16.

HLA DQ2 and DQ8 genetic testing can be of value in several situations. 
Common to all of these situations is that the presence of these genes 
indicates a person may or may not have celiac disease, and the absence of 
these genes indicates a person almost certainly cannot have celiac disease.
Here are the situations in which genetic testing is of value:
 
✓ If your doctor suspects you have celiac disease, but your other test 
results do not fit with the diagnosis. In this situation, the fact that you 
have the HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 genes means that despite the other test 
results, you still may have celiac disease. This may prompt a more 
concerted effort to find other evidence of celiac disease.

55
 Chapter 3: Diagnosing Celiac Disease
 
✓ If you have started yourself on a gluten-free diet prior to a diagnosis of 
celiac disease having been made. In this case, a small intestine biopsy 
may be normal either because you have celiac disease and are successfully 
treating it or, on the other hand, because you didn’t have celiac disease 
in the first place. We discuss this scenario further in the section, 
“Diagnosing celiac disease if you are already living gluten-free.”
 
✓ When a person within a family becomes unwell and is discovered to 
have celiac disease, raising concerns that other family members may 
be at risk. This is the most common reason that genetic testing 
for celiac disease is performed. If these family members don’t have 
the HLA DQ2 or DQ8 genes, they can be reassured they are highly 
unlikely to have or to later develop celiac disease. Doing such tests on 
undiagnosed — and asymptomatic — relatives is called screening. We 
discuss screening in detail in Chapter 4.
Other blood tests
In the preceding sections, we look at blood tests performed to help determine 
whether you might have celiac disease. In this section, we look at blood tests 
that your doctor will most likely order to see whether you have either 
complications from celiac disease or some other ailment associated with it. 
(We discuss these different conditions in detail in Chapters 7 and 8.)
These are other blood tests you may have:
 
✓ Hemoglobin level: Hemoglobin is the molecule that carries oxygen in 
your blood stream. Your doctor will order your hemoglobin level to 
determine whether you are anemic.
 
✓ Electrolytes (sodium, potassium) and other blood chemistry: These 
tests are done to determine whether you are dehydrated or have low 
levels of body minerals such as potassium, calcium, and magnesium.
 
✓ Thyroid function: Thyroid disease can occur with celiac disease and 
can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms.
 
✓ Liver tests: Celiac disease can cause liver test abnormalities and may be 
associated with (autoimmune) liver and bile duct diseases.
 
✓ Nutritional tests: Because celiac disease causes malabsorption, your 
doctor will most likely test your blood to look for evidence of deficiencies 
of vitamins and other nutrients.

56
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
Outside Looking In: How 
an Endoscopy Works
To determine whether you have celiac disease, your doctor must hear about 
your symptoms, examine you, and, almost always, order appropriate blood 
tests. At that point, if suspicion remains that you have celiac disease, you 
will need a simple and safe outpatient procedure called an endoscopy and 
small intestine biopsy. We discuss the endoscopy procedure in this section. 
(We discuss biopsies further in the next section; “Take a Little Piece: Small 
Intestinal Biopsy.”)
You may be wondering, as some of our patients do, why a doctor wouldn’t 
forego preliminary steps and go directly to an endoscopy and biopsy if a 
diagnosis of celiac disease is being considered. Although these procedures 
are the only definitive ones, and although they are straightforward and safe, 
they are still much more involved than a blood test, require a patient to give 
up time from work or other commitments, are much more expensive than a 
blood test, and do carry an element of risk — however slight. For these 
reasons and others, doctors seldom subject a patient to endoscopy and 
biopsy without first doing a preliminary evaluation to be certain that these 
procedures are truly necessary.
When you have an endoscopy, a specially trained physician places a narrow, 
flexible, fiberoptic tube (called an endoscope) into your body to look at one 
or another different parts of your gastrointestinal tract. Different endoscopes 
are used, depending on which part of your gut needs to be looked at. 
Figure 3-2 shows what a typical endoscope used to examine your small 
intestine looks like.

 Chapter 3: Diagnosing Celiac Disease
 
Although endoscopy is a general term for this method of examining any part of 
your digestive tract, doctors typically reserve the term for those procedures 
done on the upper digestive tract (the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum), 
not the lower digestive tract. (When the lower part of the digestive tract — 
that is, the colon — is being examined, the procedure is called a colonoscopy.) 
Since the full name for endoscopy is esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), you 
can see why it is easier to simply call it an endoscopy or an EGD.
Preparing for your endoscopy
Not much preparation is required prior to your endoscopy; however, there 
are a few helpful and important measures for you to follow:
 
✓ Plan to bring someone with you to your endoscopy appointment. This 
serves two important functions because that person can:
 
• Provide an extra set of ears. Bring someone to listen in when the 
doctor (or nurse) tells you the endoscopy results. Having someone 
there is especially important if you’ve received sedation because 
you’ll be prone to forgetting what you were told. (We have had 
conversations with an unaccompanied patient after an endoscopy 
only to get a call a few hours later with the patient saying “I can’t 
remember what you told me about the results.” Far better to have 
that extra person with you at the time of your scope so that you 
don’t have to later play telephone tag with your physician and, 
more important, so that you don’t have to worry needlessly.)
 
• Drive you home after the procedure. This is especially important 
if you’ve received sedation because driving after being sedated is 
dangerous.
 
✓ Fast before the procedure. You should not eat or drink for a number 
of hours prior to your test. (See the next section for the details on this 
requirement.)
 
✓ Check with your doctor about medicines. Speak to your doctor to find 
out what, if any, changes to your usual medicines will need to be made. 
For example:
 
• Diabetes medications. May need to be changed in dose or not 
taken the day of (or a portion of the day of) your procedure 
because you won’t eat be eating fully that day.
 
• Anticoagulants (“blood-thinners”). Anticoagulants, including 
medicines such as warfarin (Coumadin) or potent platelet-
inhibiting drugs such as clopidogrel (Plavix), are typically not 
taken for about 5 days prior to an endoscopy. Most endoscopy 
units do not require you to stop over-the-counter doses of aspirin 

58
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
(ASA) or anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen or naproxen. 
Check with both the doctor who prescribes these medications for 
you and also the physician who will be doing the procedure to see 
what their recommendations are for you.
 
• Medicine to be taken during the day of the procedure. For those 
medicines that your doctor says you may continue to take the day 
of the procedure and that you customarily take first thing in the 
morning, ask the doctor who will be performing the endoscopy 
whether you can take them with a sip of water (even though you 
are fasting).
Undergoing the procedure
Physicians performing endoscopies are assisted by endoscopy nurses and 
technicians in an endoscopy unit of a hospital or a specialized endoscopy 
center. An endoscopy (and small intestinal biopsy) is a fast procedure; start 
to finish, it typically takes no more than 10 to 15 minutes or so (a bit longer 
if one includes the time that you rest after it’s done). These are the steps 
involved with an endoscopy:
 
1. If you are having your endoscopy in the morning, you should not eat or 
drink anything after midnight the night before the test (therefore, if your 
test is, say, at 8am, you will have been fasting for 8 hours). If your test is 
in the afternoon, your doctor will probably tell you that you can drink a 
small amount of clear liquids early that morning.
 
 Fasting is important as your stomach needs to be empty both to allow 
the doctor to see properly and also, so that you don’t vomit (and, 
potentially, choke).
 
2. You are brought into the endoscopy suite where you are asked to lie 
on your side on a special table. A small needle is placed in a vein (an 
“intravenous”) in your arm.
 
3. To make swallowing the endoscope easier for you, the doctor or nurse 
numbs the back of your throat by either spraying it or by having you 
gargle with a local anesthetic medicine. To make it more comfortable 
for you to undergo the procedure, you may be given an intravenous 
injection of a small dose of sedative. Both the sedative and the spray will 
wear off within a few hours.
 
4. You are given a protective piece of plastic (a mouth guard) to place 
between your teeth. The scope is then inserted through the opening 
in the mouth guard into your mouth and then passed down into your 
stomach and subsequently into your duodenum. The doctor examines 
the lining of your duodenum where, sometimes, highly characteristic 
changes (such as small notches and fissures) may be seen. Then, as we 
discuss in detail in the very next section, the doctor uses long forceps to 
painlessly take biopsies of your duodenum.

59
 Chapter 3: Diagnosing Celiac Disease
 
5. The scope is withdrawn and, within minutes, the sedation (if you were 
given any) starts to wear off, and you awaken. The doctor (or nurse) dis-
cusses the findings with you and soon thereafter you’re on your way home.
An endoscopy test is usually very well tolerated and, especially if you’ve been 
given a sedative, you’ll almost certainly be surprised when the doctor tells you 
the test is all done. Often, people don’t know the test had even started!
Knowing what to expect 
after your endoscopy
As we mention in the preceding section, “Undergoing the procedure,” you’ll 
probably be surprised at how fast and easy the whole procedure goes. Here 
are a few things to be aware of after the endoscopy has been completed:
 
✓ You may notice a bit of a sore throat after the local anesthetic mouth 
spray or gargle wears off.
 
✓ You can return to normal eating and drinking within a few hours.
 
✓ If you had sedation, you cannot drive, operate heavy machinery, or 
perform other such activities for the rest of the day. For that reason, it’s 
necessary to have someone drive you home after your endoscopy.
Examining What the Doctor Looks 
for During Your Endoscopy
As the doctor performs your endoscopy, he will examine each part of your 
upper gastrointestinal tract. He’ll look at the general health of the lining 
of the different organs and, in particular, will look for evidence of the 
abnormalities that can be seen with celiac disease. Equally important, the 
endoscopist (that is, the doctor performing your endoscopy), will look for 
abnormalities unrelated to celiac disease that could also explain any symptoms 
you’ve been having.
Exploring your esophagus
As we discuss in Chapter 2, the esophagus is the tube that connects the 
mouth to the stomach. The most important abnormality that your doctor 
examines your esophagus for is evidence of inflammation related to gastro-
esophageal reflux and, in rare cases, a narrowing (stricture). We discuss 
these conditions in Chapter 6.

60
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
Surveying your stomach
After examining your esophagus, the doctor will push the scope further down 
into your gastrointestinal tract, now reaching your stomach. The endoscopist 
will examine your stomach to look for ulcers, gastritis (stomach inflammation), 
and other abnormalities that may explain any symptoms — such as upper 
abdominal pain — that you may have been having.
Delving into your duodenum
After the endoscopist examines the stomach, he passes the scope through 
the small channel (the pylorus) that leads from the stomach into the 
duodenum and then, voila, the duodenum, the very first part of the 
small intestine, is reached. Although examining the other parts of your 
gastrointestinal tract is important, when it comes to celiac disease, the 
duodenum is where the money is.
Typically, the endoscope is advanced as far down the small intestine as 
possible. This can range from just beyond the first part of the duodenum 
(known as the duodenal bulb) to the first part of the jejunum. (The jejunum is 
the part of the small intestine just beyond the duodenum.)
Your doctor will carefully examine your duodenum for changes of celiac 
disease and will also take biopsies. (We discuss biopsies in the very next 
section, “Taking a Little Piece: Small Intestinal Biopsy.”) If an abnormal area 
is identified, the endoscopist will make a point of specifically biopsying this 
region.
The specific abnormalities in the duodenum that the doctor is looking for are:
 
✓ Scalloping or notching of the duodenal folds. Normally, the duodenum is 
smooth and free of scalloping or notching.
 
✓ Fissuring or cracking of the mucosal lining between the folds.
 
✓ Absence of the duodenal folds. This can happen in very severe celiac 
disease.
Some newer methods to enhance the ability to detect abnormalities of the 
lining of the small intestine are now available. These include chromendoscopy 
in which a dye or a different wavelength of light is used, and also, there 
are now new, high definition endoscopes available which can help detect 
abnormalities that would have been less likely to be seen with earlier 
generation scopes.

61
 Chapter 3: Diagnosing Celiac Disease
 
A person can have celiac disease yet have a completely normal endoscopic 
appearance of the duodenum (or the entire upper gastrointestinal tract for 
that matter). Therefore, having an endoscopy is not sufficient to make (or rule 
out) a diagnosis of celiac disease. In all suspected cases, biopsies must be 
taken of the small intestine. It is only biopsy confirmation of celiac disease 
that establishes the diagnosis.
Taking a Little Piece: Small 
Intestinal Biopsy
As we mention in the preceding section, the diagnosis of celiac disease can 
only be made based on the results of a biopsy (that is, a tissue sample) of 
your small intestine. In a sense, everything else we discuss earlier in this 
chapter can be considered one long opening act and the small intestinal 
biopsy result the climax of your diagnostic journey.
As we discover in Chapter 2, the small intestine is over 20 feet long and 
virtually any part of it can be damaged by celiac disease. Fortunately, the 
part of the small intestine that is easiest to reach with an endoscope — the 
first part, called the duodenum — is abnormal if you have celiac disease and 
hence is ideally suited for obtaining a biopsy. A biopsy of the small intestine 
is performed at the same time as the endoscopy. After the doctor has passed 
the endoscope into your duodenum, a long forceps is inserted through a 
channel in the endoscope allowing it to emerge into the intestine where the 
forceps can be opened and then closed, painlessly pinching off a tiny sample 
of the lining of the small intestine called the mucosa. The biopsy sample is 
very small indeed, about the size of grain of rice.
It is important to take at least 4 to 6 biopsy samples of the duodenum 
including at least one biopsy from the duodenal bulb. Taking fewer samples 
may miss affected areas of the intestine. (Sometimes celiac disease is 
“patchy,” meaning that not every single area of a portion of the small intestine is 
equally affected.) Using the special techniques of chromendoscopy or using 
a high definition endoscope as described in the preceding section can be 
helpful in targeting abnormal looking areas where biopsies are to be taken; 
this increases the likelihood that, if you have celiac disease, the biopsy 
pieces will show the abnormalities of celiac disease.

62
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
Interpreting a biopsy
To the naked eye, the biopsy sample that your doctor takes at the time of 
your endoscopy doesn’t look particularly impressive; basically it is a tiny 
fragment of pinkish tissue. But put that same biopsy under the microscope 
and, if changes of celiac disease are present, whoa, is that ever a whole 
different story! As we describe in Chapter 2, a biopsy taken from someone with 
active celiac disease can show dramatic changes (well, okay, dramatic to the 
trained observer in any event) resembling a microscopic war zone. However, 
because not everyone with celiac disease has this full-blown microscopic 
picture, the pathologist who looks at the biopsy will also look for milder forms 
of damage that are also consistent with the diagnosis of celiac disease.
 
Of the microscopic changes seen on a small intestinal biopsy taken from 
someone with active celiac disease, the most important abnormalities are 
signs of inflammation, and shrinking (atrophy) of the finger-like projections 
(villi) that are key components in allowing absorption of nutrients into the 
body.
Knowing when the biopsy 
may potentially be wrong
Even though the small intestinal biopsy is considered the gold standard for 
making the diagnosis of celiac disease, there are some potential pitfalls: 
 
✓ A pathologist may misinterpret the biopsy findings and incorrectly 
attribute the observed abnormalities to some other condition even 
though, in fact, they are due to celiac disease.
 
✓ A pathologist may overlook abnormalities altogether and report a 
specimen to be normal even though there are, in fact, features of celiac 
disease present.
Fortunately, in the great majority of cases, if you have a biopsy that has 
celiac disease findings present, the pathologist will find them and report 
them correctly. Also, as we mention previously in the section, “Take a Little 
Piece: Small Intestinal Biopsy,” it is important that the doctor performing the 
endoscopy provide a sufficient number of biopsy samples to the pathologist. 
 
If you have symptoms and physical examination findings and blood tests that 
all point toward celiac disease, but your biopsy report comes back stating 
otherwise, your doctor should consider having the biopsy slides reviewed 
again. A second opinion can’t hurt. If the biopsies turn out to be truly normal, 
then genetic testing should be performed if not already done. If these are 
positive for the HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 genes, then additional testing to get 
biopsies from further down in the small intestine is often recommended. We 
discuss this uncommon situation at the end of this chapter.

63
 Chapter 3: Diagnosing Celiac Disease
Having another small intestinal biopsy
Some people require a second endoscopy and small intestinal biopsy, and 
some do not.
If you have been diagnosed with celiac disease, gotten on track with a gluten-
free diet, and had resolution of your symptoms and laboratory abnormalities 
(including antibody levels), then typically you do not need a repeat biopsy.
On the other hand, if you are not responding to treatment the way you 
should (for example, you continue to have abdominal pain and diarrhea 
despite months of appropriate dietary therapy), then your doctor will 
probably recommend your endoscopy and small intestine biopsy be 
repeated. If the repeat procedure reveals ongoing abnormalities, you and 
your doctor will then need to play Sherlock Holmes (and Watson) and figure 
out why. Typically, the problem is that you are inadvertently still ingesting 
gluten. We discuss this situation further in Chapter 12.
 
Some celiac specialists recommend a repeat EGD and biopsy in all their 
patients within 1 to 2 years of starting the gluten-free diet, but other specialists, 
including us, do not routinely recommend this course of action. We consider 
the ongoing care of celiac disease in more detail in Chapter 15.
Exploring other diagnostic tests
In your travels — especially of the Internet 
kind — you may come across other tests that 
doctors may order to determine whether you 
have celiac disease. Which tests are available, 
and who pays for them, varies depending on 
where you live and what insurance coverage 
you have. These tests are:
 ✓ The blood dot test: This test involves 
obtaining a tiny sample of blood from your 
fingertip and then placing the specimen on 
a card which is impregnated with chemicals 
(reagents) which will change colour to 
reveal if tissue transglutaminase (TTG) 
or antigliadin antibodies are present. The 
blood dot test available for home use in 
Canada is marketed under the trade name 
“Biocard” and costs approximately $50.00 
CDN. (The blood dot test is not approved for 
use in the U.S.) It is important to be aware 
that when it comes to screening family 
members for celiac disease, the more 
appropriate test is to do genetic testing, 
not measuring antibody levels (either with 
home testing or laboratory testing). It is also 
important to note that how the blood dot 
test should be used in clinical care remains 
to be established.
 ✓ Fecal tests: These tests involve analyzing a 
stool specimen for the presence of celiac 
disease antibodies.
 ✓ Saliva tests: These tests involve analyzing a 
saliva specimen for the presence of celiac 
disease antibodies.
The fecal (stool) and saliva tests have not been 
very well studied or validated so they neither 
replace standard testing nor should they be 
used routinely.

64
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
Diagnosing Celiac Disease When 
You Already Live Gluten-Free
More and more people are going on a gluten-free diet without having a 
confirmed diagnosis of celiac disease.
Sometimes, a gluten-free diet is started without any testing because a person 
believes that he or she is having symptoms that are so typical of celiac 
disease (see Chapter 6) that, in that person’s opinion, the diagnosis seems 
overwhelmingly likely and doing tests seems unnecessary. Other times, 
a well-meaning doctor gets antibody tests that come back positive and 
instructs the patient to start a gluten-free diet without getting an intestinal 
biopsy.
Celiac disease specialists do not advocate starting a gluten-free diet without 
first having had a definitive, biopsy-proven diagnosis. Here’s why:
 
✓ Risks treating wrong condition. As we discuss in Chapter 11, other 
conditions can have similar symptoms to celiac disease, so you may end 
up treating the wrong disease with the wrong treatment.
 
✓ Potentially delays proper treatment. Antibody results, although helpful 
in establishing a diagnosis of celiac disease, are still not as reliable as a 
small intestinal biopsy, so, once again, treating yourself without biopsy 
confirmation of celiac disease may end up delaying your receiving 
proper treatment for the condition that is actually present.
 
✓ Alters test results. If you are on a gluten-free diet but are not feeling 
better, it makes it more difficult to figure out if you do or do not actually 
have celiac disease. This is because antibody tests and biopsy specimens 
become less accurate once someone is on a gluten-free diet. We discuss 
this further in the next section, “Confirming a diagnosis of celiac disease 
when you live gluten-free.”
 
✓ Causes unnecessary screening of relatives. If you are the first person in 
your family to be diagnosed with celiac disease, you may have relatives 
that then want to be (or need to be) screened for the condition. Imagine 
the confusion and hassles to your relatives if they seek out screening tests 
for a condition which, as it turns out, they didn’t need to be screened for 
because you, in fact, never had it to begin with.
See Chapter 13 for a further discussion on this topic.

65
 Chapter 3: Diagnosing Celiac Disease
Confirming a diagnosis of celiac disease 
when you live gluten-free
If you have not been biopsy-proven to have celiac disease, but have been 
following a gluten-free diet, determining if you do or don’t have celiac disease 
can be a challenge.
 
The fact that your symptoms may have improved on a gluten-free diet should 
not be taken as proof that you have celiac disease. There may be many other 
reasons for the improvement. For example, people with irritable bowel syndrome 
(see Chapter 12) sometimes feel better on a gluten-free diet even if they don’t 
have celiac disease. One study showed that a good result from being on a 
gluten-free diet correctly predicted that celiac disease was the underlying 
problem 36 percent of the time. This means that the other 64 percent of 
patients had other problems that in some cases should have been treated 
differently.
If you have undiagnosed celiac disease and you’ve been on a gluten-free diet 
for less than a year and, especially, if you’ve not been meticulously gluten-
free, then the odds are good that one or more of your antibody tests will still 
be abnormal and a small intestinal biopsy would also be abnormal (thus 
confirming the diagnosis). Therefore, in this situation, your specialist will 
probably send you for these tests.
If, however, you’ve been living gluten-free for a year or more, your antibody 
tests and your small intestinal biopsy will most likely be normal. The challenge 
is to figure out if they are normal because you have celiac disease and it’s 
under excellent control or, conversely, if they are normal because you don’t 
have the disease to begin with. To sort this out is a challenge, but the first 
step is to do genetic testing (see Chapter 4) and only if you have the DQ2 or 
DQ8 genes would further tests, such as a gluten challenge (see the next 
section), be warranted.
 
Kelly, a 30 year-old nutritionist came to see Sheila for possible celiac disease. 
She had suffered from bloating and loose bowel movements for several years 
and, concerned that she had celiac disease, she had earlier placed herself 
on a gluten-free diet with subsequent improvement in her symptoms. Sheila 
checked Kelly’s TTG IgA which was normal but she also ordered a HLA DQ2 
and DQ8 test which showed that Kelly did not have these genes. When Kelly 
returned to discuss the results of her tests, Sheila informed Kelly that she was 
very unlikely to have celiac disease and that most likely the reason she got 
better was that the gluten-free diet was helping an underlying irritable bowel 
syndrome or that Kelly could have gluten sensitivity (see Chapter 13) or that 
some other factor may have been responsible. Kelly gradually incorporated 
gluten back into her diet and she continued to feel well thereafter.

66
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
The role of a gluten challenge
As we mention in the preceding section, if you are following a self-imposed 
gluten-free diet on speculation that you have celiac disease, and you then 
have a normal biopsy of the small intestine, this doesn’t prove much. It could 
be that you have celiac disease and it has responded to your diet or it could 
mean that you don’t have celiac disease to begin with.
This conundrum can sometimes be resolved by having you perform a gluten 
challenge meaning that you abandon your gluten-free diet and then, under 
your doctor’s close supervision, wait and see if you redevelop your previous 
symptoms or develop positive antibodies. If this happens, an endoscopy with 
small intestinal biopsy can then be performed. There are, however, some 
problems with the gluten challenge, including these:
 
✓ Becoming ill. Some patients may become very ill soon after beginning it. 
The one good thing about this is that with the return of their symptoms, 
the affected person’s blood tests and small intestinal biopsy equally 
quickly become abnormal if they have celiac disease, so the diagnosis 
can be readily made.
 
✓ Delayed onset of symptoms or antibodies. Some patients, even if 
they have celiac disease, may not develop symptoms or antibodies for 
months in which case the diagnosis remains unclear. In this circumstance, 
most celiac experts recommend endoscopy and biopsy at the end of 6 
months of a gluten challenge.
 
✓ Significantly delayed onset. If you are an adult and you’ve been on a 
gluten-free diet since infancy, it could be years before a gluten challenge 
causes antibodies or intestinal damage to develop. For this reason, if 
you’re an adult who was, as an infant, diagnosed with celiac disease 
without biopsy confirmation and you’ve been on a gluten-free diet ever 
since, rather than having a gluten challenge, you are better off first 
having genetic testing done. If you don’t have the HLA DQ2 or DQ8 
genes, you can be quite sure you don’t have celiac disease, no further 
testing is necessary, and you need no longer follow a gluten-free diet. If 
you have the genes and you have been doing well on the diet then most 
celiac disease specialists recommend you stick with the diet.
Great variation exists among celiac specialists on how the challenge is 
conducted (amount of gluten, duration of challenge, frequency of TTG Ab 
testing during the challenge, timing of the EGD). This depends on the age of 
the patient, how long the patient has been gluten-free, and other factors.
 
If your doctor advises you to reintroduce gluten into your diet, be sure to do 
so only gradually. This applies regardless whether this is being done as part 
of a gluten challenge to detect celiac disease or if you have gluten-sensitive 
irritable bowel syndrome (see Chapter 12) and have been avoiding gluten. In 
these situations, consuming too much gluten too soon can potentially lead to 
marked gastrointestinal symptoms.

67
 Chapter 3: Diagnosing Celiac Disease
Questioning Your Diagnosis
No symptom, no physical examination finding, no blood test and, on rare 
occasion, not even a biopsy result provide perfect accuracy in determining 
whether someone has celiac disease. So, if no perfect way of diagnosing 
celiac disease exists, it could be that you have either been told you have it 
and you wonder whether you don’t or, conversely, you might have been told 
you don’t have it, yet you wonder if, in fact, you do. We look at these two 
issues in this section. We also examine the rare situation when everything 
points to celiac disease but the standard tests aren’t enough to make the 
diagnosis.
Second-guessing celiac disease
If you’ve been diagnosed with celiac disease and are being treated with a 
gluten-free diet yet you continue to feel unwell, this should raise a red flag 
that perhaps something else is amiss. One possibility is that, despite your 
best efforts, you are inadvertently continuing to ingest gluten. (We discuss 
hidden sources of gluten in Chapter 12.) Another possibility is that the 
diagnosis is wrong and you don’t actually have celiac disease.
 
Bill Mason was a 48 year-old veterinarian, who, after having had longstanding 
problems with heartburn, constipation, and bloating, was referred to a 
gastroenterologist. The gastroenterologist performed an EGD with small 
intestinal biopsy, which a pathologist concluded showed features of celiac 
disease. Bill was, therefore, treated with a gluten-free diet, but despite dutifully
following the diet, his symptoms didn’t go away. Because of the lack of 
improvement, his gastroenterologist decided to treat Bill with a potent 
anti-inflammatory medication called prednisone. Alas, not only did this not 
help, but, in fact, Bill started to feel even worse. He therefore went back to see 
his family doctor who then sent Bill to see Sheila for a second opinion. Sheila 
arranged for her own hospital’s pathologist, who specializes in gastrointestinal 
diseases, to review the previous biopsies and, lo and behold, the pathologist’s 
conclusion was that the specimens did not, in fact, show celiac disease, but, 
rather, revealed changes typical of excess acidity (peptic duodenitis). The 
patient was taken off prednisone, was started on anti-acid medication, and 
discontinued his gluten-free diet. Within a few weeks, his symptoms were 
almost gone and he felt like a new person.
 
If you suspect that you do not have celiac disease, even though you’ve been 
diagnosed with the condition, speak to your doctor about your concerns. 
Your doctor can review the different factors that led to the diagnosis having 
been made and the two of you can decide if further investigations or getting a 
second opinion (either from a gastroenterologist who has a special interest in 
celiac disease or by your doctor arranging to have your biopsy slides read by 
a different pathologist) is appropriate.

68
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
In some situations, your doctor may conclude that you don’t have celiac 
disease, but you are unconvinced. Sheila encountered just such a circumstance.
 
Ingrid, a 20 year-old woman with diarrhea, troublesome flatulence, and 
abdominal bloating, was referred by her family doctor to a gastroenterologist. 
Ingrid’s sister had been previously diagnosed with celiac disease, and the GI 
specialist was quite certain that Ingrid also had it. Ingrid’s TTG Ab result came 
back positive, but, to the doctor’s surprise, the small intestinal biopsy result 
was normal. The doctor reassured Ingrid that she did not have celiac disease. 
Ingrid, however, still wondered if she did. Her family doctor, therefore, sought 
a second opinion and referred her to Sheila. Sheila was quite convinced that 
Ingrid had celiac disease, so she had the biopsy specimens sent to a different 
pathologist (one whom she knew to be excellent and very interested in celiac 
disease) and, lo and behold, in fact, typical features of celiac disease were 
present. Ingrid’s doubts had been completely justified; she had celiac disease 
after all.
Looking for suspected celiac disease 
when it can’t be found
As we mention earlier in this chapter, on occasion a person who has both 
clinical features (that is, symptoms and physical examination findings) and 
laboratory test abnormalities (including antibodies) strongly suggesting celiac 
disease nonetheless has a normal endoscopy and small intestine biopsy. This 
can be quite a conundrum. Does the person have celiac disease and it’s being 
overlooked? Or, in fact, is celiac disease not present?
If you are in this situation, these are next set of measures your celiac disease 
specialist can then undertake to sort things out:
 
✓ Have another pathologist look at the small intestine biopsy slides to 
make sure some subtle changes of celiac disease were not overlooked.
 
✓ Test your blood to see whether you have the HLA DQ2 or HLA DQ8 
genes that place you at risk for celiac disease. If you have neither of 
these genes, then you are highly unlikely to have celiac disease.
 
✓ Check to see whether you have some other reason for having antibodies 
most commonly seen with celiac disease. Other, non-celiac disease 
causes include other autoimmune diseases, liver disease, and congestive 
heart failure.
If despite these measures, it is still unclear whether you do or do not have 
celiac disease, the next step is to look for small intestine abnormalities of 
celiac disease further down the small intestine, that is, in areas beyond the 
reach of a conventional endoscope. (The regular endoscope can only reach 
the duodenum and the very beginning of the jejunum.)

69
 Chapter 3: Diagnosing Celiac Disease
The following sections explain the ways your doctor can try to assess areas 
of your small intestine that cannot be reached with a regular endoscope.
Colonoscopy 
With this, the goal is to pass the scope beyond the colon and into the terminal 
ileum (this is the end part of the small intestine). This is called an ileoscopy. 
When the scope is in the terminal ileum, biopsies of this area can then be 
obtained. (Though rare, sometimes the only portion of the small intestine 
that is affected by celiac disease is the terminal ileum.) While the endoscopist 
is performing the colonoscopy, she will take biopsies of the colon to look 
for microscopic colitis since, as we discuss in Chapter 7, this condition can 
sometimes mimic celiac disease and not infrequently occurs with celiac 
disease.
Capsule endoscopy
A capsule endoscopy (CE) is a procedure that allows video images to be taken 
of the intestine beyond the reach of an endoscope. During a CE procedure, 
you swallow an oversize “pill” which in fact is a miniature video camera 
(see Figure 3-3). The pill takes high resolution movies of the lining of the gut 
as it makes its merry way through the intestine, moved along not by a tiny 
propeller but by the bowel’s own natural contractions (something called 
peristalsis). As it journeys through your gut, the camera beams its video 
images to a specially designed recorder (attached to a belt) you wear for 
eight hours, at which time the recorder (and belt) are removed and the 
captured images of the small intestine are downloaded onto a computer 
where a doctor analyzes them for evidence of signs of complications of celiac 
disease such as lumps, bumps, ulcers, and other abnormalities.
If you’re wondering what happens to that high tech capsule, well, eventually, 
you pass it out of your body with your stool, retrieve it from the stool, and 
then simply dispose of it.
In addition to its role in monitoring celiac disease, capsule endoscopy can 
also be used to help diagnose elusive cases. Specifically, there are occasional 
situations where a doctor strongly suspects a person has celiac disease, but 
a regular endoscopy and biopsies don’t detect it. In this situation, it could be 
that celiac disease is indeed present, but only located further down the small 
intestine where a regular endoscope can’t reach. In this situation, a capsule 
endoscopy can be performed, and if the images it captures are compatible 
with celiac disease in this more distant region of the small intestine, then a 
longer type of endoscope (a push enteroscope or a double balloon enteroscope) 
can be used to try to confirm the diagnosis by obtaining biopsies of this 
portion of the intestine. The following section has more details on this 
procedure.

Enteroscopy
Enteroscopy is the same as endoscopy, but using a long scope (an enteroscope) 
that, because of its length, can reach beyond where an endoscope is able. 
Since these techniques are time consuming and require specific expertise, 
referral to a specialized center will often be needed to have such testing 
done.
 
Before you undergo an ileoscopy or enteroscopy, your specialist may ask you 
to eat more gluten than you normally do in the hopes that this will enhance 
the small intestinal damage. (Making your small intestine damage worse is 
helpful only insofar as it helps establish the diagnosis; it is certainly not a long 
term goal!)
If — egads — after all this, a biopsy confirmation of celiac disease has still 
not been made, then further recommendations are made based on your 
individual clinical situation. Often, a trial of a gluten-free diet is undertaken 
to see whether this causes relief of symptoms and resolution of abnormal 
celiac disease antibodies. Alternatively, if you’re not feeling particularly 
unwell in the first place, your doctor may recommend you continue with your 
regular diet and have certain of your tests redone after 6 to 12 months to 
see whether they’ve become more definitive. (In particular, with the passage 
of time, if you have celiac disease your small intestine biopsies will likely 
become more clearly abnormal.)
Fortunately, it is very rare that diagnosing celiac disease is as complicated as 
this!

f celiac disease caused every person with the condition to develop a 
shiny green foot, figuring out who did and who did not have the condition 
would be a piece of cake and as simple as having you take off your shoe. No 
diagnostic uncertainty. No tests necessary. Yes, well, as we all know, things 
are seldom that simple. As we discuss in Chapter 6, there is no symptom (or 
group of symptoms) that is unique to celiac disease. For that reason, when 
someone has suspicious symptoms — such as unexplained diarrhea and 
weight loss — further investigations, such as those described in Chapter 3, 
are required.
But what if you have no symptoms at all? Should you still be tested to see 
whether you have celiac disease? The quick answer is “it depends.” The 
longer answer is, well, the entirety of this chapter. So read on . . .
Knowing When to Screen Someone 
for Celiac Disease
Screening for a disease is the term used when a doctor tests someone who 
doesn’t have evidence of a disease to see if, nonetheless, they do in fact have 
it. In other words, screening is looking for a condition before it turns into a 
problem.

72
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
You may be surprised to learn that throughout your life, you’ve been 
screened for various diseases. Screening begins at birth when all infants are 
tested for hypothyroidism (thyroid underfunctioning). As the years roll by, 
doctors perform other screening tests, including, depending on a person’s 
age and gender, those for diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, 
breast cancer, colon cancer, cervical cancer, and prostate cancer to name 
but a few.
Two main criteria must be met in order to justify screening someone for 
celiac disease:
 
✓ A reasonable probability exists that testing will show you do indeed 
have celiac disease. If the odds of your having celiac disease are close 
to zero, performing testing for this disease is, as you may expect, rarely 
going to be helpful.
 
✓ Determining that you have celiac disease is meaningful. In other 
words, justification to test you for celiac disease only exists if, upon find-
ing out you do indeed have the condition, the institution of a gluten-free 
diet occurs. Also, the diet would need to be of health benefit to you.
We discuss controversies surrounding celiac disease screening in the 
sidebar, “To screen or not to screen, that is the question.”
Determining Who Should Be 
Screened for Celiac Disease
A number of factors put you at increased risk of having celiac disease and, 
therefore, may make screening you for celiac disease more appropriate.
These factors are the most important general situations that may make 
screening you for celiac disease appropriate (we discuss specific situations 
in a moment):
 
✓ If you have a close relative with celiac disease. A close relative is 
considered a first degree relative, that is, a parent, sibling, or child with 
celiac disease.
 
✓ If you have a disease that often occurs together with celiac disease. An 
example of such a so-called associated disorder is having another autoimmune 
disease such as type 1 diabetes. We discuss this and other associated 
conditions in Chapter 8.
 
✓ If you have a disease that can be caused by celiac disease, such as 
osteoporosis or iron deficiency. We discuss these conditions further in 
Chapter 7.

73
 Chapter 4: Screening for Celiac Disease
 
Bill, a 25 year-old patient of Ian’s, had been having problems with abdominal 
cramping and heartburn. Tests were run and a diagnosis of celiac disease was 
made. His perfectly healthy sister, Tara, having heard about her brother’s 
diagnosis, saw her own physician who tested her for celiac disease by sending 
her for appropriate investigations which, as it turned out, showed that she, 
too had celiac disease. Both Bill and Tara had celiac disease, but it was Tara 
who, being free of symptoms or other evidence of celiac disease, had been 
screened for the condition.
The debate continues as to whether screening for celiac disease is justified 
on a widespread basis in the general population. Conversely, determining 
whether screening an individual on a case-by-case basis is a different matter 
because, for a specific individual, a doctor can generally estimate whether or 
not there is a sufficient probability of celiac disease that testing the person 
for it is appropriate.
Screening and genetic ancestry
Because of their genetic ancestry, some people (such as those from the 
Far East or sub-Saharan Africa) are at low risk of having celiac disease. 
Nonetheless, because North America has a long history of immigration from 
all corners of the world and of interracial mating, determining which North 
To screen or not to screen, that is the question
In North America people are screened for 
celiac disease only if it is thought they are at 
significant risk of having the condition. Several 
reasons exist for doing this selective screening 
rather than screening everybody (so-called uni-
versal screening), including:
 ✓ The significant costs of the screening tests.
 ✓ Concerns about diagnosing a condition 
that may never cause clinical problems. (In 
other words, “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”)
 ✓ Identifying a problem for which the affected 
person is, perhaps, not interested in being 
treated.
Screening for diseases is important when the 
disease is contagious or if having the condition 
diagnosed and treated helps prevent dete-
rioration in one’s health, reduced quality of life, 
premature death, or any combination of the 
preceding. Because celiac disease is not con-
tagious, because it does not usually shorten 
lifespan significantly, because people with 
celiac disease who are symptom-free and only 
diagnosed by screening might never get sick 
from it, and because screening tests are costly, 
screening everyone for the condition is gener-
ally thought by health authorities to be inappro-
priate. However, this remains a controversial 
area among experts in the field of celiac dis-
ease and, understandably, is also sometimes a 
point of contention among many individuals and 
their family members who have suffered from a 
delayed diagnosis of celiac disease.

74
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
Americans are genetically at risk is not easy. For this reason, people who, 
based purely on their ancestry, might be considered to be at low risk for 
celiac disease are sometimes screened for this condition anyhow.
Screening and symptoms
 
We recommend you discuss with your doctor whether you should be 
screened for celiac disease if you have any of the following (all of which we 
discuss in Chapters 7 and 8), particularly when other known causes of these 
conditions or symptoms cannot be identified:
 
✓ Alopecia (loss of hair)
 
✓ Dry eyes and mouth
 
✓ Aphthous ulcers (“chancre sores”) of the mouth
 
✓ Erosions of dental enamel
 
✓ Thyroid disorders
 
✓ Indigestion or heartburn
 
✓ Type 1 diabetes mellitus
 
✓ Liver and biliary tract problems (such as abnormal liver enzyme tests or 
autoimmune liver disease)
 
✓ Anemia
 
✓ Irritable bowel syndrome symptoms (bloating, cramps, altered bowel 
habits)
 
✓ Gynecological problems, such as not having begun having periods 
despite reaching an appropriate age, having periods stop before reach-
ing menopausal age, early menopause
 
✓ Obstetrical problems, such as the inability to get pregnant, frequent mis-
carriages, delivering premature babies
 
✓ Osteoporosis, unexpected broken bones
 
✓ Neurological problems, such as neuropathies, difficulties with balance, 
migraine headaches
 
✓ Behavioral disorders, including hyperactivity, difficulty concentrating
 
✓ Mood and thinking problems such as depression, irritability, or 
forgetfulness
 
✓ Growth and development problems in infants and young children includ-
ing lack of growth, insufficient growth, unexplained weight loss
 
✓ Fatigue, if chronic
 
✓ Down syndrome or Turner syndrome

75
 Chapter 4: Screening for Celiac Disease
 
One could consider looking for celiac disease in such instances as case finding 
rather than screening, since many, if not most, of the disorders listed above 
can be associated with celiac disease and since, by definition, screening is typ-
ically considered to be testing for a condition in the absence of any evidence 
that it is present. But hey, we don’t want to get overly nitpicky here.
The preceding list is long and admittedly somewhat intimidating: What 
person, after all, hasn’t had at least some of the features that we noted? 
Indeed, the number of situations in which celiac disease could be considered 
is rather mind-boggling. Turning things on their ear, one could reasonably 
ask, “Who should not be tested for celiac disease?” The truth of the matter 
is that the answers to the questions who to screen and who not to screen 
simply aren’t known. We think a reasonable compromise is for you to be 
screened if you have features in the preceding list and they are persisting or 
unexplained by other, more obvious causes.
Screening, personal choices, 
and one’s stage in life
That the person being screened should want to be screened goes without 
saying. Undergoing screening tests may not be a huge ordeal, but some 
people would rather not undergo these tests, thank you very much. Also, 
some people don’t want to be treated for the condition being searched for, 
in which case there’s no point searching for the condition in the first place. 
Some benefit must be derived from finding out that you have celiac disease, 
and some value obtained by being treated with a gluten free diet.
 
Sheila was hosting a meeting of her local celiac disease support group, and the 
topic of screening relatives came up. One woman (who, herself, had celiac dis-
ease) wanted to have her 86 year-old father screened for the condition. He was 
healthy as an ox and had never had any problems that raised concerns that 
he could have celiac disease, but the woman was worried about her father 
nonetheless. Sheila advised the daughter that it would be best to let her father 
live the rest of his life without undergoing screening. At such a late stage of 
life, the treatment would most likely not benefit him and rather, would likely 
decrease his enjoyment and quality of life. On the other hand, the woman’s 
children were appropriate candidates for screening, because they had many, 
many years of life ahead of them and ample time for celiac disease, if left 
untreated, to harm them.

76
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
Understanding How Screening 
for Celiac Disease Works
Screening for celiac disease is performed in two ways:
 
✓ Genetic testing is performed on either a blood sample or on cells 
obtained from the inside of the cheek (obtained by a painless “scraping” 
of the inside of the cheek). If the test is positive, further investigations are 
then undertaken. We discuss this further in the section “Genetic testing.”
 
✓ Antibody testing is performed on a blood sample obtained from the 
person being screened. If the test is negative (that is, the antibody is not 
present), the test is repeated again every few years. Lifelong re-screening 
applies primarily to first degree relatives of celiac disease patients, 
although if celiac disease has not developed by later in life, a case could 
be made that enough is enough and screening may then be discontin-
ued. (Having said that, because celiac disease can present in every 
decade of life, experts don’t really know when screening should stop 
in someone who has the HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 genes that make them at 
risk of developing celiac disease.)
 
Ideally, the antibody test is performed only after a positive genetic test. That 
way, you will not be sent for needless antibody tests if your genetic test has 
already revealed that you have virtually no risk of having celiac disease.
Genetic testing
Your genes lay out your body’s blueprint. Your genes determine whether you 
have dark hair or blond hair, or are short or tall, and so forth. As we discuss 
in Chapter 2, the genes most associated with celiac disease are called HLA 
DQ2 and DQ8.
If you have the HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 genes, this does not mean that you are 
certain to have celiac disease, but it does mean that you are at increased 
risk. Therefore, if you have these genes, additional tests (including antibody 
testing, and, if positive, endoscopy with small intestine biopsy) are needed 
to determine whether celiac disease is present. The main benefit of having 
genetic screening is that if you don’t have the HLA DQ2 or DQ8 genes, you are 
almost without risk for ever getting celiac disease.

77
 Chapter 4: Screening for Celiac Disease
Antibody testing
As we discuss in Chapter 3, several blood tests are available that check 
whether you have antibodies to various proteins that are associated with 
celiac disease. Of these, the most accurate one to help diagnose (or, if 
absent, exclude) celiac disease is the IgA antibody to tissue transglutaminase 
(TTG IgA).
Knowing which test method is best for you: 
Genetic testing or antibody testing?
Just like the expression “different strokes for different folks,” so, too, when it 
comes to deciding which screening test is preferred for different individuals:
 
✓ Genetic screening is preferred if you are being screened because you 
are at increased risk of having celiac disease since you have a close 
(first degree) relative with celiac disease. This test is particularly help-
ful if the result shows you do not have the HLA DQ2 or DQ8 genes, as 
the lack of these genes means your risk of having or later developing 
celiac disease is so remote that, in fact, you will not need any further 
screening.
 
✓ Antibody screening is preferred if you are being screened because you 
are at increased risk since you have an autoimmune condition. (Genetic 
screening is typically not done in this situation because medical stud-
ies have shown that if someone has an autoimmune disease, they likely 
have the HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 genes so testing for these is not helpful.)
 
The TTG antibody can be falsely elevated in autoimmune diseases, congestive 
heart failure, and liver diseases. Therefore, if you have one of these diseases 
and your TTG Ab result is positive, this result is not a reliable indicator for 
celiac disease and, depending on your particular situation, you may need a 
biopsy of your small intestine performed.
Asymptomatic Celiac Disease 
Detected by Screening
When an asymptomatic individual (that is, someone who has no symptoms) 
undergoes screening and is found to have celiac disease, they have either the 
silent or latent forms of celiac disease. We discuss these and the other types 
of celiac disease in Chapter 5.

78
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
The long-term outlook for people diagnosed with silent or latent celiac dis-
ease is unknown, and some controversy exists as to whether such individu-
als should be treated with a gluten-free diet. On the one hand, some studies 
demonstrate an improved quality of life after asymptomatic celiac disease is 
detected by screening and treated by a gluten-free diet. On the other hand — 
and diametrically opposed! — some studies report a reduced quality of life in 
screen-detected celiac disease patients who go on a gluten-free diet.
Given this conflicting information, doctors are often understandably hesitant 
to screen everyone at risk of celiac disease, seeing as when these asymptom-
atic forms of celiac disease are discovered, what should be done, if anything, 
remains unclear.

A
lthough most people — including many health care professionals — 
think of celiac disease as being one condition, there are, in fact, several 
different forms. In this chapter, we look at the various forms of celiac disease, 
what they have in common, and how they differ. Most importantly, we dis-
cuss why this is important for you to know.
What’s in a Name: The Different 
Types of Celiac Disease
In its classical — and best known — form, celiac disease is associated with 
abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and malnutrition. And as you may expect, 
if there is a classical form, there is bound to be one or more non-classical 
forms. Non-classical forms of celiac disease are the atypical form, the silent 
form, and the latent form. It is now known that the majority of people with 
celiac disease do not have the classical variety; rather, they have one of 
these other types. Table 5-1 illustrates the key features of the different forms 
of celiac disease; you may find it helpful to refer back to this table as you 
read the chapter.

Textbook Disease: Looking at 
Classical Celiac Disease
For two thousand years, when doctors described what we now call celiac 
disease, they were discussing the classical form of celiac disease. Similarly, 
when celiac disease has been discussed in the press or at the dinner table or 
at the office water cooler, it has been this variety of the condition that typi-
cally was being considered. The following sections discuss the symptoms, 
diagnosis, and treatment of this form of celiac disease.
Symptoms of classical celiac disease
Classical celiac disease can occur in adults but more typically begins in early 
childhood. It is characterized by symptoms that arise directly from damage 
to the small intestine. The affected person has abdominal bloating and 

81
 Chapter 5: What Type Am I? Looking at the Forms of Celiac Disease
discomfort, and diarrhea. Also, because the damaged bowel becomes unable 
to properly absorb nutrients into the body (a condition called malabsorp-
tion), the individual with classical celiac disease starts to break down some 
of his or her own tissues to provide nutrients to supply energy for the body’s 
normal functioning. This leads to loss of muscle mass and weight loss.
In children, the malabsorption that is present means there are insufficient 
nutrients present to allow for proper weight gain, growth and physical 
maturation (a condition called failure to thrive). In particularly severe cases, 
a child’s bones may not develop properly, leading to bowing of their legs 
(called rickets; see Chapter 7). We discuss celiac disease in childhood in 
detail in Chapter 14.
Diagnosing classical celiac disease
As with the other forms of celiac disease, a person with classical celiac dis-
ease has abnormal blood tests; most importantly, he or she typically has the 
presence of tissue transglutaminase IgA antibody (TTG IgA). We discuss this 
test in detail in Chapter 3.
 
The TTG IgA test will not be reliable if a person has a deficiency of the IgA 
antibody. Therefore, if you have the symptoms we discuss in this section yet 
after doing some blood tests, the doctor determines that celiac disease is not, 
in fact, present, we recommend you ask the doctor whether the IgA level was 
tested. If it wasn’t, it needs to be. We discuss the issue of IgA deficiency in 
detail in Chapter 3.
 
Classical celiac disease cannot be diagnosed unless a small intestine biopsy is 
obtained and found to be abnormal. We discuss this test in detail in Chapter 3.
Treating classical celiac disease
The mainstay of treating classical celiac disease is following a gluten-free 
diet. Meticulously. Conscientiously. Strictly. Ah, we think you get the point. 
The speed with which a person responds depends, in part, on how long he or 
she has been unwell, how severely damaged is the small intestine, and how ill 
he or she is, but in general, once treatment is underway, the person with clas-
sical celiac disease will soon start to improve with progressive resolution of 
the abdominal symptoms and diarrhea. If a child has had stunted growth and 
development, he or she will usually have a spurt and, depending on when 
the diagnosis was made and how severe is this complication, may eventually 
catch up to his or her peer group in size and maturation.

82
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
 
Jane was on the verge of tears when she brought Brittany, her four year-old 
daughter, to see the pediatrician. Sick with worry, Jane told the doctor how 
Brittany would sometimes cry in pain, would have such bad diarrhea that she 
was sometimes not making it to the bathroom in time, and had stopped grow-
ing. The doctor took one look at the clearly malnourished child and recog-
nized why Jane would be so worried. The doctor carefully examined Brittany 
and then said to her mom, “Jane, your daughter has textbook findings of celiac 
disease. We should be able to quickly confirm this and get treatment under 
way.” Sure enough, subsequent tests established that Brittany had classical 
celiac disease. Shortly after starting a gluten-free diet, Brittany quickly began 
to regain her health and once again became a vibrant and growing child.
When Symptoms Suggest Something Else: 
Looking at Atypical Celiac Disease
Atypical celiac disease is the form of celiac disease characterized by the 
absence of or, at most, only a very small number of small intestinal symptoms 
with the predominant complaints being related to some other organ. This is in 
distinct contrast to classical celiac disease wherein symptoms are primarily or, 
often exclusively, related to the small intestine and the associated malabsorp-
tion. Also, atypical celiac disease is most commonly diagnosed in adults and 
relatively less often in children. However, even in children, the atypical form is 
being seen more often, especially in older children.
Despite the lack of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, the small intestine is dam-
aged if you have atypical celiac disease.
Atypical celiac disease is much more common in society than is classical 
celiac disease. (Hmm . . . if something that is called “atypical” is much more 
common than is something that is called classical — reasonably a synonym 
for “typical” — we think a case could be made for reversing the names. But, 
oh my, imagine the confusion that would lead to. “Mr. Smith, you have classi-
cal celiac disease, no wait, you have atypical celiac disease, no wait, you 
have . . .” Guess, we’ll just stick with the existing classification!)
 
Because atypical celiac disease is, well, atypical, it is a diagnosis that is often 
not considered by doctors. For that reason, if you think you may have it 
(based on the features we discuss in the next section), feel free to mention 
the possible diagnosis to your physician. As always, we’ll be happy to take the 
blame should your doctor — perish the thought! — take offense at your rais-
ing the issue.

83
 Chapter 5: What Type Am I? Looking at the Forms of Celiac Disease
Looking at GI symptoms of 
atypical celiac disease
When present, GI symptoms may include mild indigestion, heartburn, abdom-
inal cramps and bloating, diarrhea, and/or constipation. Because these GI 
symptoms are mild and because they are so commonly seen in otherwise 
healthy individuals or people with any of a whole slew of different ailments, 
most physicians wouldn’t — perfectly understandably by the way — readily 
consider celiac disease as the culprit. More likely, if you were having these GI 
symptoms, a doctor would entertain diagnoses such as:
 
✓ Irritable bowel syndrome, a condition characterized by abdominal 
discomfort and altered bowel habits (frequently involving both constipa-
tion and diarrhea). (We discuss this condition in Chapter 12.)
 
✓ Gastro-esophageal reflux, an ailment in which acid from the stomach goes 
back up into the esophagus. (We discuss this condition in Chapter 12.)
Examining non-GI symptoms 
of atypical celiac disease
As we mentioned earlier in this section, atypical celiac disease is character-
ized by a paucity or complete absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Many 
different circumstances lead to the ultimate diagnosis of atypical celiac dis-
ease. What they have in common is someone (be it a physician, a nurse, a 
dietitian, another health care provider or, importantly, a patient) thinking of 
the possibility.
Many different scenarios may lead — sometimes sooner, sometimes later — 
to a diagnosis of atypical celiac disease, including when a person is discov-
ered to have otherwise unexplained
 
✓ Anemia
 
✓ Osteoporosis or low impact fracture (we define these terms in the section 
“Osteoporosis due to atypical celiac disease”) in adults; rickets in a child
 
✓ Infertility
 
✓ Erratic blood glucose levels in the setting of type 1 diabetes
 
✓ Skin rash
 
✓ Nerve damage
 
✓ Bleeding

84
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
 
✓ Calcium deficiency
 
✓ Vitamin deficiency
 
✓ Tooth (enamel) defects in a child
We discuss the first four of the listed items in detail in the following sections. 
We discuss the other listed items (and many of the other possible health 
issues that can lead to a diagnosis of atypical celiac disease) in Chapters 7 
and 8.
Anemia 
The small intestine is damaged if you have atypical celiac disease just as it is 
with the classical form. When the small intestine is damaged, it loses its abil-
ity to absorb into the body essential nutrients required to make red blood 
cells. The three most common types of anemia that are seen are those due to 
low levels of
 
✓ Iron (anemia due to low iron is called iron deficiency anemia)
 
✓ Folic acid (or folate)
 
✓ Vitamin B12
 
You can have a deficiency of iron, folic acid, or vitamin B12 without necessarily 
being anemic. In this case, it is only when these specific nutrients are mea-
sured on a blood test that the deficiency is identified.
Deficiency of iron, folic acid, or vitamin B12, whether or not associated with 
anemia, does not necessarily cause symptoms.
 
Bill was a perfectly healthy 40 year-old man who, after seeing a notice in the 
local newspaper asking for blood donors, headed down to the local clinic. 
To his shock, as he went through the screening process done prior to giving 
a donation, he was told he would not be allowed to give blood as he was 
anemic. He had felt completely well. Following the clinic’s advice, he went to 
see his family physician, who discovered that Bill was low in iron. Tests to rule 
out bleeding were normal (low iron can be caused by blood loss), so further 
testing was undertaken and, lo and behold, it was determined that Bill had low 
iron due to iron malabsorption due to celiac disease. He was treated with a 
gluten-free diet and, for a time, iron supplements, and his iron level gradually 
returned to normal. After his anemia had corrected, he returned to the blood 
donor clinic and was able to donate.
We discuss the subject of anemia and celiac disease in more detail in Chapter 7.
Osteoporosis 
Osteoporosis is a condition where loss of bone strength and mass (amount) 
occurs. Having osteoporosis increases your risk of a fracture. As we dis-
cuss in Chapter 7, to have healthy bones, you must have not only sufficient 

85
 Chapter 5: What Type Am I? Looking at the Forms of Celiac Disease
amounts of calcium and vitamin D in your diet, but you must also have a 
healthy small intestine that can absorb these nutrients from the gut into your 
body. If you have celiac disease, you may not be able to properly absorb cal-
cium and vitamin D and as a result you can develop osteoporosis.
 
Because osteoporosis causes — and this is a surprise to most people — no 
symptoms at all, it is typically undetected until it either is found when a person 
is sent by their doctor for a routine osteoporosis screening (bone mineral 
density) test or when an individual sustains a low impact fracture. In medical 
parlance, a low impact fracture is defined as a fracture of a bone (excluding the 
small bones of the hands or feet) that occurs despite only minor trauma such 
as a seemingly harmless fall.
When celiac disease is the cause of osteoporosis and fractures, this is the 
usual chain of events leading to the diagnosis of celiac disease:
 
1. An apparently healthy person has a seemingly harmless fall.
 
2. Despite the person having had only a minor fall, he or she sustains a low 
impact bone fracture.
 
3. Surprised that such minor trauma lead to a fracture in a healthy person, a 
doctor questions whether the person has some underlying bone disorder, 
such as osteoporosis, that made that person susceptible to a fracture.
 
4. The doctor orders a bone mineral density (BMD) test to evaluate the 
patient’s bones and it comes back showing osteoporosis.
 
5. The physician questions why this healthy person would have osteopo-
rosis and, aware that osteoporosis can be caused by malabsorption, 
orders tests looking for this condition.
 
6. Blood tests confirm evidence of malabsorption, and the doctor then 
runs further tests, including those for celiac disease, to determine 
why malabsorption is present. Lo and behold, celiac disease is found. 
(Sometimes, a doctor may order celiac blood tests during Step 5.)
As you might imagine, the poor person who, until the fracture, had thought 
themselves to be perfectly well is typically stunned to find out he or she has 
not just one, but two underlying conditions: osteoporosis and celiac disease. 
There is, however, one silver lining to this. Unlike other people with osteopo-
rosis, a person in this situation has one additional, highly potent therapeutic 
weapon available to help rebuild bone strength; use of a gluten-free diet. The 
gluten-free diet heals the intestine which will then allow for the resumption of 
normal absorption of calcium and vitamin D.
You may perhaps have noticed that in the preceding numbered list we twice 
referred to a doctor questioning the unanticipated occurrence of a problem 
and then doing further tests which subsequently led to an unexpected dis-
covery. Alas, not all physicians are so questioning and for this reason many 
people with fractures don’t have their osteoporosis discovered and, if the 
osteoporosis was due to celiac disease, don’t have this discovered either.

Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
 
You can be your best advocate and you can help your doctor help you and 
others in the following ways:
 
✓ If you have celiac disease and you ever sustain a low impact fracture, 
ask your doctor to test your bone density to determine if you have 
osteoporosis.
 
✓ If you are not known to have celiac disease and you sustain a low impact 
fracture, ask your doctor to test you for osteoporosis. If osteoporosis is 
found, ask your doctor to also test you for celiac disease.
 
✓ Whether you have celiac disease or not, feel free to share with others 
the information discussed in this section. If you know someone that has 
had a fracture despite only minor trauma, mention to that person that 
you read how osteoporosis (and celiac disease) can cause this.
Infertility
Although it remains a controversial topic and although the link is not consid-
ered fully proven, there appears to be an association between infertility and 
celiac disease.
 
Jill was a 34 year-old woman who, despite years of trying to start a family, 
had been unable to conceive. She had had repeated meetings with her gyne-
cologist and had been poked, prodded, and tested more than she could have 
dreamt possible, yet no cause for her infertility had been discovered. Her 
husband, too, had been tested, but nothing untoward showed up. Jill decided 
to do her own research and, turning to the Internet, she discovered that there 
were cases where similarly infertile women had been found to have celiac 
disease and once placed on a gluten-free diet had successfully conceived. She 
approached her gynecologist with this information and was tested for celiac 
disease. Despite having not a single other symptom of the disease, her results 
came back positive. Jill met with a dietitian, began a gluten-free diet, and a few 
months later was back in the doctor’s office. Before the doctor said a word, 
he knew that his patient was pregnant: Jill’s ear-to-ear smile told the story. 
Indeed, the story continued as, over the next few years, Jill ended up having 
two further, successful pregnancies. She was so overwhelmed by both her joy 
and how she had discovered her own celiac disease that she ended up start-
ing a local community celiac disease support group.
Jill, in the preceding anecdote, had atypical celiac disease; that is, in her 
case, her celiac disease had not caused gastrointestinal symptoms — or any 
other symptoms for that matter — with one exception: she had infertility. 
Was Jill infertile because of her (atypical) celiac disease? And was she able to 
conceive because she was then treated with a gluten-free diet? It’s impossible 
to know for certain, but medical research suggests this could be the case.

87
 Chapter 5: What Type Am I? Looking at the Forms of Celiac Disease
 
It pays to be your own advocate. If you have infertility and routine tests don’t 
reveal a cause, ask your doctor to consider the diagnosis of celiac disease. It 
could well be that this is something they’d already considered and had previ-
ously excluded. Or it could be that because you hadn’t had any of the symp-
toms of celiac disease that are most familiar to doctors (that is, gastrointestinal 
symptoms), the diagnosis of celiac disease hadn’t been considered.
We further discuss the relationship of infertility and celiac disease in Chapter 14.
Erratic blood glucose control (in people with type 1 diabetes) 
Type 1 diabetes is the form of diabetes that most commonly onsets in chil-
dren or young adults and requires the immediate introduction of — and 
ongoing use of — insulin therapy. Controlling blood glucose levels in type 1 
diabetes is a fine balance between many factors, including, most importantly, 
food intake, exercise, and the amount of insulin given. If these are out of sync, 
then blood glucose control can become erratic.
As we discuss in Chapter 8, because celiac disease causes malabsorption, it 
can lead to unstable blood glucose control in a person with type 1 diabetes. 
Fortunately, nowadays, diabetes specialists are usually familiar with this and 
routinely test for celiac disease in this situation. If celiac disease is discov-
ered, following a gluten-free diet usually quickly improves the blood glucose 
control. Because celiac disease presenting this way is unassociated with 
other symptoms of celiac disease, it is said to be the atypical form of celiac 
disease that is present.
 
In the preceding paragraph we mentioned that diabetes specialists are usu-
ally familiar with the relationship between type 1 diabetes and celiac disease, 
which is to say that not all such specialists are especially aware of this con-
nection. Also, not every person with type 1 diabetes is being followed by a dia-
betes specialist. For these reasons, if you have type 1 diabetes and your blood 
glucose control has become unexpectedly erratic, we recommend that you 
ask your health care provider if you’ve been tested for celiac disease. If you 
haven’t been tested for celiac disease, and if no other apparent explanation 
exists for your problem, you should have this testing undertaken.
Hushed but Not Forgotten: 
Silent Celiac Disease
Silent celiac disease (also sometimes called subclinical celiac disease) has 
three key features. The affected person:
 
✓ Does not have symptoms (gastrointestinal or otherwise) of celiac dis-
ease and does not have other diseases or health problems that would 
provide clues they have celiac disease.

88
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
 
✓ Has typical blood test abnormalities of celiac disease (and, like the 
other forms of celiac disease, is associated with certain HLA genes as we 
describe in Chapter 4).
 
✓ Has small intestine biopsy findings of celiac disease.
Uncovering silent celiac disease
As you may expect, because silent celiac disease is, by definition, not associ-
ated with symptoms, it is most likely to be discovered as an incidental and 
unexpected finding, such as when a person has a small intestine biopsy done 
during an endoscopy being performed for an entirely unrelated condition 
(such as having an ulcer) or is tested for possible celiac disease as part of 
a research study being done on close relatives of someone who is known to 
have celiac disease. (We discuss screening in detail in Chapter 4).
Treating silent celiac disease: 
Should you or shouldn’t you?
Arguments can be made both for and against treating silent celiac disease 
(with a gluten-free diet). In support of not treating it, one could point out that:
 
✓ The person with silent celiac disease feels perfectly well; why, therefore, 
ask that person to initiate therapy for something that isn’t bothering him 
or her? (That is, “if it ain’t broke why fix it?”)
 
✓ Following a gluten-free diet is not an easy thing to do; indeed, it is not 
only inconvenient, but it can also be frankly difficult. Why, therefore, 
recommend that a perfectly healthy person take on this burden?
 
✓ Doctors don’t have any long-term scientific data to show that treating 
silent celiac disease is of value in protecting and preserving health, so in 
the absence of this data, isn’t it inappropriate to advocate treating it?
On the flip side of the argument, in support of treating silent celiac disease, 
one could point out that:
 
✓ A person with silent celiac disease may feel completely well, but that 
isn’t a reason not to treat them. Rather, this simply means that they 
were fortunate to be discovered before celiac disease had had time to 
make them sick. Treating them now will help keep them from later get-
ting sick.

89
 Chapter 5: What Type Am I? Looking at the Forms of Celiac Disease
 
✓ It’s not rare that a person who had no awareness of having symptoms 
only recognizes with the benefit of hindsight, once they’ve been follow-
ing a gluten-free diet for a time, that in fact they had been having symp-
toms. In other words, it was only after symptoms they’d had chronically 
(and therefore didn’t even notice them anymore) went away that they 
realized they’d ever been there in the first place.
 
✓ Following a gluten-free is not easy, but getting sick and running into 
complications from untreated celiac disease is far worse.
We wish harder scientific evidence were available to tell us what advice 
we should give patients, but, well, it isn’t. In the absence of this evidence, 
doctors — including us — need to rely on our best clinical judgment. We 
know how much damage can be done by celiac disease; indeed, we see it 
all the time. So even though we don’t have foolproof evidence that patients 
with the silent form of celiac disease benefit from following a gluten-free diet, 
we prefer to err on the side of caution. For that reason we advocate that if 
you have silent celiac disease, you follow a gluten-free diet. Most of our col-
leagues, by the way, offer similar advice to their patients.
Lurking in the Background: 
Latent Celiac Disease
Latent celiac disease (also sometimes called potential celiac disease) has 
three key features. The affected person:
 
✓ Does not have symptoms due to their celiac disease.
 
✓ Has typical blood test abnormalities of celiac disease (and, like the 
other forms of celiac disease, is associated with certain HLA genes as we 
describe in Chapter 4).
 
✓ Does not have small intestine biopsy findings of celiac disease.
The most important difference between silent celiac disease and latent celiac 
disease is that with the former the small intestine biopsy is abnormal and 
with the latter it is normal. Latent celiac disease is most likely to be discov-
ered when someone has an abnormal blood test found as part of a celiac 
disease screening program and then goes on to have a normal small intestine 
biopsy.
 
Celiac disease is, by definition, a condition in which the small intestine has 
certain characteristic abnormalities. Latent celiac disease, by definition is 
associated with a normal small intestine biopsy. This contradiction has led to 
controversy amongst celiac disease experts with some contending that latent 
celiac disease shouldn’t be considered a form of the disease.

90
Part I: Dealing with the Diagnosis of Celiac Disease 
Deciding whether latent celiac 
disease should be treated
There is controversy over whether or not a person with latent celiac disease 
should be treated. The arguments pro and con are much the same as we 
outline in the preceding section where we discuss silent celiac disease, but 
with one major difference. If you have silent celiac disease, by definition you 
have an abnormal small intestine biopsy. In other words, there is clear evi-
dence that your celiac disease is causing damage to your body. Latent celiac 
disease is different. If you have latent celiac disease, by definition you have 
a normal small intestine biopsy and thus no evidence that celiac disease is 
damaging your body.
Because latent celiac disease is not associated with damage to the body — 
and because there is currently no scientific proof that damage would develop 
in the future — justifying treatment for it is harder than justifying treatment 
for silent celiac disease (where, by definition, there is already evidence of 
damage). Nonetheless, some well-respected celiac disease experts believe 
latent celiac disease would eventually lead to damage and that it is better 
to treat it sooner than later. Other celiac disease experts believe that latent 
celiac disease may remain latent indefinitely and, as such, placing someone 
on lifelong treatment (even one not involving medication) is inappropriate in 
the absence of hard scientific evidence that this is beneficial for this particu-
lar group of individuals.
An additional argument in favor of treating latent celiac disease is the possi-
bility that the normal small intestine biopsies that were taken simply missed 
the abnormal intestine due to patchy disease or disease that could not be 
reached because it was further down the small intestine. In other words, the 
person labeled as having latent celiac disease actually had silent celiac dis-
ease. (Although we see the rationale for this argument, we believe that it is 
important to find damaged intestine — such as by using additional tests as 
we discuss in Chapter 3 — before labeling someone as having latent celiac 
disease.)
Our opinion, based on the current literature and our own experience, is 
that there is, at this point in time, insufficient justification to routinely treat 
people with latent celiac disease. We also feel, however, that it is impera-
tive that a person diagnosed with latent celiac disease be monitored for the 
development of more overt disease (that is, one of the types discussed ear-
lier in this chapter). The majority of our colleagues follow a similar approach. 
(We discuss monitoring of celiac disease in Chapter 15.)

How Celiac 
Disease Can 
Make You Feel

In this part . . .
C
eliac disease doesn’t always cause symptoms, but 
when it does, the symptoms can range from mild 
indigestion all the way to severe diarrhea and malnutri-
tion. In this part, you discover how celiac disease can 
make you feel. You also find out about those conditions 
that are either caused by, or associated with, celiac 
disease.

W
hen we speak to celiac disease support groups, we are struck by the 
fact that the label — celiac disease — is often the only thing that 
the roomful of people has in common. Indeed, all people with celiac dis-
ease have their own stories, their own journeys with celiac disease and, in 
the case of symptoms, their own personal ways in which the condition has 
affected them.
As you read through this chapter, you may recognize symptoms you’ve been 
experiencing. In that case, take heart; if you’ve not yet begun your gluten-
free diet or if you’ve only very recently started it, once you’re on track with 
your new diet, you will likely find your symptoms soon start to ease. In other 
words, throughout this chapter when we say that celiac disease causes this 
or the other symptom, we are — unless we specifically state otherwise — 
invariably talking about untreated or insufficiently treated celiac disease.
Many people with celiac disease recognize just how bad and just how long 
they’ve been feeling unwell only after they’ve been diagnosed and treated and 
their symptoms have started to ease. That is, their symptoms had been pres-
ent for so long, they had simply become “part of the wallpaper.” (Sort of like 
after your car has had a tune up and you only then notice, conspicuous by its 
absence, that a longstanding rattle has suddenly disappeared.)

94
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Some of our patients tell us this makes them feel guilty — as if they did some-
thing wrong by having ignored their symptoms and that if only they had men-
tioned them earlier to their doctor they would have been diagnosed — and 
therefore, felt better — sooner.
If you feel this way, we hope your guilt quickly falls by the wayside. First, per-
haps you’re just stoic. Second, it’s perfectly reasonable that you might have 
attributed such everyday symptoms as stomach upset or abdominal cramps 
that everyone (whether one has celiac disease or not) gets from time to time 
to something else. Third, guilt isn’t going to make you feel any better, so 
there’s no point on dwelling on the past anyhow.
Symptoms 101: Looking at the Big Picture
Because celiac disease can be such a many-headed hydra, referring to “typi-
cal” symptoms of celiac disease is seldom appropriate. Indeed, for most 
people, the only thing that’s “typical” about their symptoms is that they’re 
atypical! Indeed, this is even reflected by the fact that the substantial major-
ity of people with celiac disease have what is called the atypical form of the 
disease. We discuss the classification of celiac disease in detail in Chapter 5, 
but with regard to symptoms, here are the key attributes of these types:
 
✓ Classical celiac disease is associated with gastrointestinal symptoms 
such as abdominal bloating and discomfort, diarrhea, and weight loss.
 
✓ Atypical celiac disease has few, if any, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, 
with non-GI symptoms or symptoms present due to complications from 
celiac disease being the predominant features.
 
✓ Silent celiac disease and latent celiac disease do not cause symptoms.
As this list indicates, it is only the classical and atypical forms of celiac dis-
ease that cause symptoms.
Gut Feelings: Gastrointestinal Symptoms
If you’ve been experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms, but, out of embar-
rassment, have been hesitant to see your doctor about them, you’re certainly 
not alone. Indeed, lots of people find themselves in this same boat. Doctors, 
however, are never embarrassed discussing GI symptoms and your doctor’s 
comfort with this will soon put you at ease, too. (In fact, GI specialists have 
been known to say: “It may be poop to you, but it’s bread and butter to me!” 
Well, actually, they word it somewhat less, ahem, tastefully, but we’ve edited 
the saying as this is a family-oriented book.)

95
 Chapter 6: Symptoms of Celiac Disease
 
Jerry was a 25 year-old man who hadn’t been feeling well for quite some time. 
He was feeling constantly bloated and he was spending lots of the time in the 
bathroom with diarrhea. He had put off seeing a doctor, initially because he 
had hoped things would go away on their own and, when they didn’t, because 
he thought he’d be embarrassed talking about his bowel habits. As it turned 
out, it took less than 30 seconds for him to realize he’d had no reason to fear; 
the discussion with his family doctor was no more embarrassing than had 
they been talking about the weather. Jerry’s physician astutely concluded that 
Jerry’s symptoms were not to be passed off and referred Jerry to Sheila for 
further investigation. Sheila discovered Jerry was also having problems with 
excess burping, heartburn, and flatulence (farting in non-medical speak). 
Quickly putting two and two together, Sheila surmised he may have celiac dis-
ease and performed an endoscopy and small intestine biopsy (we discuss 
these procedures in Chapter 3), which confirmed the diagnosis. Jerry was 
placed on a gluten-free diet and within a short period of time, he felt like new.
The gut stops here: Diarrhea, 
celiac disease, and you
Diarrhea is the frequent passage of watery or semi-formed stools. Pretty well 
everyone — whether having celiac disease or not — gets diarrhea from time 
to time, often from relatively harmless (but decidedly unpleasant) conditions 
such as viral gastroenteritis (“stomach flu”).
Loosely speaking: Diarrhea due to celiac disease
Diarrhea is the symptom of celiac disease that is best known to the world at 
large and it comes as a surprise to most people — including many doctors, 
by the way — to learn that, in fact, upwards of 50 percent of people with 
celiac disease have no diarrhea at all; indeed, for some people living with 
celiac disease, the main bowel problem is that of constipation! Contrary to 
popular belief, diarrhea should no longer be considered a hallmark of this 
disease.
Of those people with celiac disease who do get diarrhea, its nature can vary 
to a great extent; both between people and even for a given person. If you 
have diarrhea, it could be that you’ve noticed that you have some days 
where you feel that you’re spending the entire day on the toilet and other 
days where you could be a hundred miles from the nearest bathroom and 
care not a whit (well, passing urine aside).
 
If you have not been diagnosed with celiac disease and you see your doctor 
to report that you are having alternating constipation and diarrhea, the odds 
are high that your doctor will not have celiac disease high up on his radar as 
a possible cause for your problem and instead will be more likely to consider 
irritable bowel syndrome (or IBS; which we discuss in Chapter 12). This is 
perfectly understandable as IBS is a very common cause of these kinds of 

96
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
symptoms. Nonetheless, it cannot hurt for you to mention — especially if 
you’re not responding sufficiently well to treatment for IBS — that you’ve read 
(here) that celiac disease can also cause these symptoms. Who knows; per-
haps you will end up being responsible for figuring out your own diagnosis?
 
Celiac disease does not cause blood to appear in or on the stool. If you see 
blood with your stool, you should let your doctor know. It may be that there’s 
nothing going on beyond some minor problems with hemorrhoids, but much 
more serious causes exist, including bowel cancer. Blood in the stool is not a 
symptom to be ignored.
An absorbing discussion about malabsorption
Some people, especially those with the classical form of celiac disease, 
have severe, unremitting diarrhea. This can be evidence of malabsorption. 
Malabsorption is a condition in which one is unable to properly absorb nutri-
ents from food. If you malabsorb fat, the fat you eat stays in your intestine 
and — it’s got to go somewhere — becomes part of your stool. Having stool 
that contains fat is called steatorrhea. If you have steatorrhea, your family will 
know you have this problem almost as quickly as you do. Why? Well, every-
one’s stool smells, shall we delicately say, unpleasant, but steatorrhea smells 
dreadful. Horrible. “Call in the fumigators” awful. Also, these fatty stools tend 
to stick to the bowl so you may find yourself needing to get a brush to scrape 
off the remnants of your trip to the bathroom, lest the next visitor have an 
eyeful. Other features of steatorrhea are that the stools are bulky and tend 
to float.
Eating when you’re suffering from severe malabsorption is like filling your 
car’s gas tank only to find the fuel gauge showing you’re nearly empty 
because you’ve got a hole in your tank. The gas goes in, but gets drained out 
without being used; your food goes in but also does not get used, the nutri-
ents instead being passed out of your body with your stool.
Malabsorption isn’t an “all or none” phenomenon. Some people with celiac 
disease — especially children with the classic form — have severe mal-
absorption and, as a result, lose a great deal of ingested nutrients from the 
body. This can result in loss of muscle mass, fat stores, fatigue, lethargy, and 
weight loss. Much more commonly, however, malabsorption is selective with 
only a limited variety and amount of nutrients (particularly iron) being lost 
from the body and with virtually no symptoms being present. This is seen 
in many people with the atypical form of celiac disease and, because of the 
frequent absence of symptoms, it is often only after a routine blood test done 
at an annual check-up or for some other, coincidental reason comes back 
abnormal that the diagnosis of celiac disease eventually gets made.

97
 Chapter 6: Symptoms of Celiac Disease
Treating diarrhea due to celiac disease
The mainstay of treating diarrhea (and other bowel complaints) due to celiac 
disease is to follow a gluten-free diet. Within a few weeks of getting on track 
with your diet, you will likely notice an improvement in your bowel troubles. 
It may, however, take months before things are back to normal. If your symp-
toms don’t settle, then you and your health care providers will need to deter-
mine whether some other problem is going on. Considerations, which we 
discuss in detail in Chapter 12, include:
 
✓ Having some other, co-existing intestinal problem (such as irritable 
bowel syndrome)
 
✓ Having a complication from your celiac disease (such as lactose 
intolerance)
 
✓ An incorrect diagnosis of celiac disease
 
✓ Ongoing, typically inadvertent, ingestion of gluten
Olfactory challenges: Sniffing out the 
importance of flatulence
One of our favourite pieces of trivia is the fact that the average adult farts 
thirteen times per day. Although everyone (yup, everyone — even Presidents, 
Prime Ministers, and Princes; not that we would know first hand mind you) 
routinely passes gas, people with celiac disease can be particularly prone to 
flatulence.
When it comes to celiac disease there is no classical or typical pattern of flat-
ulence. Indeed, although if you’re passing more wind than the last Nor’easter 
it’s likely you have a problem with your gut (celiac disease or otherwise), the 
absence of lots of flatus doesn’t necessarily mean that all is well and, in par-
ticular, doesn’t rule out the possibility you’ve got celiac disease.
Flatus is caused by bacteria in the large intestine acting on undigested or 
incompletely digested food (specifically, carbohydrates) that’s made its way 
down to the colon after having not been absorbed into the body by the small 
intestine. As the large intestinal bacteria munch on the nutrients that have 
come their way, they produce gasses including the infamous hydrogen sul-
phide which is the main cause of flatus’s malodour.
 
If you have steatorrhea (see the preceding section), your gas may be particu-
larly malodorous. This can be an important clue for your doctor, so share 
this — so to speak — with him or her; and don’t feel embarrassed (see the 
preceding anecdote to find out why).

98
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Abdominal symptoms: Belly pain, 
bloating, and beyond
As with flatus (see the preceding section), every person on the planet experi-
ences abdominal symptoms of one sort of another from time to time. When it 
comes to celiac disease, however, abdominal symptoms are often much more 
of a problem and indeed, may be part and parcel of one’s existence.
 
When we consider abdominal symptoms, in addition to well known and well 
understood terms (like cramps), there are a few other, sometimes miscon-
strued terms worth looking at:
 
✓ Abdomen. The part of your body between your chest and your pelvis 
(see Chapter 2). We mention this so as to differentiate it from your stom-
ach which, of course, is the organ connecting the esophagus and the 
(small) intestine.
 
 Why mention this at all? For this reason: If you were to mention to a 
health care provider that you are having “stomach pain,” how your 
words are interpreted may be very different than if you were to men-
tion you were having “abdominal pain.” Many people use these two 
terms interchangeably and most health care providers recognize this. 
Nonetheless, to avoid confusion its best to just use the word “abdomen” 
unless you are very certain your symptom really is coming specifically 
from your stomach (which, by the way is often exceptionally difficult 
to know).
 
✓ Bloating. The symptom of feeling that one’s abdomen is overly full. 
Typically if someone says they feel bloated they are referring to a feel-
ing of fullness as if they have too much gas in the intestine, but the term 
is also used by people to describe a similar feeling due to other causes 
such as feeling overly full with food, or even feeling constipated.
 
✓ Abdominal distension. The physical equivalent to the symptom of 
bloating. In other words, it is something that a doctor observes when 
she examines you. Having said that, the word distension is also often 
(and perfectly legitimately) used synonymously and interchangeably 
with the term bloating.
Bloating (and, therefore, abdominal distension) due to celiac disease is 
typically most bothersome after a meal, but can also be present even if you 
haven’t recently eaten. Although bloating is not a serious or life-threatening 
symptom, it can be very unpleasant. Marked and persisting abdominal dis-
tension used to be seen quite often in very young children affected by severe 
celiac disease, but thankfully this seldom happens nowadays as children with 
celiac disease are typically diagnosed (and treated) much earlier in the pro-
cess than used to be the case.

99
 Chapter 6: Symptoms of Celiac Disease
Abdominal cramps are sharp, often piercing, pains which can be felt in a 
variety of places. They are typically fleeting, lasting from seconds to minutes. 
Cramps are usually caused by contractions of the intestine and as the con-
traction relaxes the discomfort eases. Passing flatus sometimes also helps 
ease a cramp, which you probably know from personal experience.
Reflux and heartburn
Reflux is a condition in which acid from within the stomach passes back up 
into the esophagus (as shown in Chapter 2, the esophagus is the swallowing 
tube that connects the mouth to the stomach) giving rise to a burning feeling 
behind the breastbone (sternum).
 
Reflux is the short form for gastroesophageal reflux. If someone has chronic 
problems with reflux, the condition is called gastroesophageal reflux disease 
(or GERD).
As we discuss in Chapter 2, the stomach produces acid, which helps to digest 
food. How much acid is in the stomach? Well, the stomach produces so much 
hydrochloric acid that stomach fluid is, brace for this fact, 1,000,000 times 
more acidic than water.
The stomach has special protective mechanisms so that all this acid doesn’t 
normally damage the stomach lining. (When this mechanism fails, people are 
susceptible to stomach ulcers.) The esophagus, however, doesn’t have these 
same protective features and as a result is susceptible to damage from acid. 
Abdominal symptoms and the 
misdiagnosis of celiac disease
Abdominal symptoms from celiac disease don’t 
have features that are specific to this particular 
illness, which is part of the reason that celiac 
disease so often gets overlooked. Perhaps you 
had the experience, before your celiac disease 
was diagnosed, of telling your health care pro-
vider that you were having abdominal discom-
fort, bloating, and so on, and you were then 
misdiagnosed with some other ailment like, for 
example, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). If so, 
you’re in good company because this happens 
all the time. All we can say is that we hope that 
as both health care providers and health care 
recipients become more aware that celiac 
disease is so common, and how often celiac 
disease presents with atypical features (see 
Chapter 5 for a discussion of the different types 
of celiac disease), that they will have a height-
ened level of alertness to look out for this con-
dition, and the condition will be more quickly 
diagnosed.

Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
To protect the esophagus from being exposed to the stomach’s acid, the part 
of the esophagus that attaches to the stomach has a valve-like feature (called 
the lower esophageal sphincter) that blocks the stomach acid from entering. 
When this valve is weak, acid travels up from the stomach into the esopha-
gus and damages it, giving rise to the symptom of heartburn.
Most people, whether or not they have celiac disease, experience reflux and 
heartburn from time to time — particularly after a large meal or drinking 
more than their fair share of coffee. Heartburn is more likely to be a problem 
as a person enters middle age. Heartburn is also particularly common during 
pregnancy and, especially, labor. (Note to all pregnant women, whether or 
not you have celiac disease: If your husband offers you a slice of pizza when 
you are in labor — as an unnamed author of this book did to his wife in this 
situation many, many moons ago — decline it!)
Non-drug therapy
If you have celiac disease, you may be more prone to reflux and, therefore, 
heartburn. The reflux (and heartburn) may be present both more often and 
more persistently. Following a gluten-free diet can help lessen your reflux, 
but often is insufficient. Here are some non-drug therapies that may help ease 
your symptoms:
 
✓ Avoid ingesting — or, at the least, limit the consumption of — those 
things (such as coffee, tea, spicy foods) that trigger your symptoms.
 
✓ Avoid overeating — especially in the late evening before going to bed. 
(When you are lying down, you are especially prone to reflux because 
you don’t have gravity helping to keep acid in the stomach and out of 
your esophagus.)
 
✓ Avoid excessive liquid intake for a few hours before going to bed.
 
✓ Try to lose weight if you are overweight. (Being overweight is a contribu-
tory factor leading to reflux.)
Drug therapy
Despite the measures we just discussed, many people still have problematic 
symptoms. In this case, a variety of medications are available to help you, 
including:
 
✓ Antacids. Include Maalox, Mylanta, and many others. Antacids can be 
obtained without a prescription and are often an excellent treatment 
choice if you get heartburn just occasionally.
 
✓ H2 blockers. Go by a variety of names, including, in alphabetical order, 
cimetidine (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), and raniti-
dine (Zantac). Many H2 blockers are available over-the-counter and have 
various other trade names. These drugs can be used on an “as needed 
basis” to treat an episode of heartburn or, under a doctor’s supervision, 
on a routine basis to prevent heartburn.

101
 Chapter 6: Symptoms of Celiac Disease
 
✓ Proton pump inhibitors. Go by a variety of names including, in alpha-
betical order, dexlansoprazole (Kapidex), esomeprazole (Nexium), 
lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Losec, Prilosec, Zegerid), pan-
toprazole (Pariet, Protonix), and rabeprazole (Aciphex). Proton pump 
inhibitors are especially potent at suppressing acid production from the 
stomach and have become very popular therapies.
We recommend that if you get just occasional heartburn, simply take an 
antacid or an H2 blocker when you need to. If your problem is occurring 
regularly, follow the non-drug preventative strategies we outline previously. 
If, however, your heartburn is occurring frequently or is particularly bother-
some for you, then speak to your doctor about whether or not you might 
benefit from taking a proton pump inhibitor.
 
Rarely, celiac disease causes such severe and intractable reflux that the 
recurring presence of stomach acid in your esophagus leads to scarring and, 
eventually, narrowing of the esophagus (a stricture). If this happens, you will 
have difficulty swallowing solid foods such as bread or steak with the food 
getting stuck in your esophagus. This is typically felt as a sudden pain behind 
the lower part of your sternum which comes on as you are eating and even-
tually eases as the food finally passes through the obstruction. If you are 
experiencing this symptom be sure to mention it to your doctor so that he or 
she can determine if you have a stricture. Whether you have a stricture is typi-
cally determined by performing an endoscopy (we discuss this procedure in 
Chapter 3).
Indigestion
Indigestion (dyspepsia) is a common gastrointestinal symptom of celiac dis-
ease. Though indigestion can be defined in many different ways, most com-
monly it refers to an aching, uncomfortably full, or burning discomfort which 
typically occurs after eating and is felt in the upper part of the abdomen 
(as opposed to GERD where the main symptom is a burning behind the 
breastbone).
Pretty well everyone, whether having celiac disease or not, experiences indi-
gestion from time to time (think third helping of Christmas turkey, or beer 
and pizza when out with “the boys”). If you have celiac disease, however, you 
are more prone to indigestion, and it may occur without any obvious food 
overindulgence.
Many people with celiac disease have put up with years of bothersome indi-
gestion only to have it nearly vanish within a few months of starting a gluten-
free diet. Indeed, eliminating gluten from your diet will likely be the only 
therapy you require (apart, that is, from possibly needing to avoid that third 
helping of turkey, but, hey, if it’s Christmas, what the heck . . . ).

Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Weight Loss
Until recent years, when much has been learned about celiac disease, it had 
been thought that celiac disease was primarily a childhood ailment and was 
pretty well always associated with weight loss. Although this is true of what 
is called classical celiac disease, it is, in fact, not true of the majority of people 
with celiac disease, most of whom have atypical celiac disease (see Chapter 5 
for a discussion on the classification of celiac disease) and do not experience 
weight loss. Having said all this, weight loss in adults with celiac disease can 
and does occur and, if it happens to you, it’s important that you are aware of 
the possible causes.
 
When you lose weight due to celiac disease, you typically lose no more than a 
few pounds and have no cause for alarm. If, however, you are losing substan-
tial amounts of weight, you should seek very prompt medical attention.
Looking at the issue of weight loss in four different settings is helpful. Weight 
loss due can be caused by:
 
✓ Active celiac disease
 
✓ Dietary change once a person starts following a gluten-free diet
 
✓ A co-existing condition
 
✓ Complications from celiac disease
In the next few sections, we look at each of these scenarios.
Weight loss due to active celiac disease
Having active celiac disease — that is, ongoing damage to the small intestine — 
can lead to weight loss from two main causes.
 
✓ Loss of appetite: Celiac disease can make you feel generally crummy and 
if you feel that way you may not have much of an appetite which, in turn, 
will lead you to eat less. This reduced intake of calories will result in loss 
of weight.
 
✓ Malabsorption: As we discuss earlier in this chapter in the section, “An 
absorbing discussion about malabsorption,” celiac disease damages 
the small intestine, which is the place that nutrients are absorbed into 
the body. If you have a reduced ability to absorb these nutrients into your 
body, they — and the calories they contain — are then lost from the body 
with your stool. This is called malabsorption. Lost calories causes lost 
weight.

103
 Chapter 6: Symptoms of Celiac Disease
Weight loss due to the gluten-free diet
People with celiac disease may find that they lose some weight once they 
start on a gluten-free diet. As we discuss in detail in Chapter 15, following a 
gluten-free diet entails giving up certain calorie-rich gluten-containing foods 
such as is found in junk foods or restaurant buffets. As a result of ingesting 
fewer calories, you may find yourself losing weight after you’ve started your 
gluten-free diet.
Weight loss due to a co-existing condition
As we discuss in detail in Chapter 8, a number of different diseases are not 
caused by celiac disease but occur with greater frequency if you have celiac 
disease. Several of these can result in weight loss unrelated to your celiac 
disease.
If you have celiac disease, have gotten on track with your gluten-free diet, 
and are ingesting sufficient calories, but are still losing weight, then you and 
your doctor should consider the possibility you have one of these co-existing 
conditions:
 
✓ Addison’s disease. The adrenal glands are under-functioning.
 
✓ Depression. People who feel depressed often lose their appetite.
 
✓ Diabetes. Having high blood glucose levels (as is a hallmark feature of 
diabetes) causes weight loss.
 
✓ Hyperthyroidism. The thyroid is over-functioning.
Weight loss due to a complication of 
celiac disease
As we discuss in Chapter 12, celiac disease can cause complications which, in 
turn, can cause weight loss. These are not common occurrences, but if other 
causes of weight loss have not been found, they should be considered. Here 
are the most important ones to be aware of:
 
✓ Pancreatic insufficiency. This is a condition in which the pancreas 
is unable to make sufficient quantities of digestive enzymes, and as a 
result, you get malabsorption.

104
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
 
✓ Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). This is a condition in 
which there are excess numbers of bacteria in the small intestine; these 
excess bacteria consume some ingested dietary nutrients and also 
damage the small bowel, and as a result, digestion is impaired and mal-
absorption develops.
 
✓ Intestinal cancer. Cancer of the small intestine, which we discuss in 
depth in Chapter 9, is a rare complication of celiac disease and is most 
likely to develop if you’ve had many years of severe, uncontrolled celiac 
disease.
 
Save yourself untold grief: Before you and your health care providers start 
an extensive search for one or more of the conditions we mention in the pre-
ceding list, make sure you have eliminated all gluten from your diet. What a 
shame it would be if you went through all sorts of tests to look for why you 
were unexpectedly losing weight if, in fact, the cause was nothing more than 
the fact that you were still (inadvertently) ingesting gluten.
 
Bill, a 35 year-old man, came to see Ian for a routine celiac disease visit. Ian 
asked him how he was feeling, to which the man replied that everything was 
fine. “You sure you haven’t lost any weight?” Ian asked, noticing the patient’s 
belt to have a few worn — and now unused — notches. “Well, now that you 
ask, I guess I have lost some weight.” And, following Ian’s gaze to his belt, he 
added, “Yeah, my wife pointed that out to me, too.” With further discussion, 
the patient realized he had recently been having some palpitations (heart 
pounding) and his hands had been shaky (tremor). As it turned out, he had 
hyperthyroidism; a condition known to be associated with celiac disease. Ian 
treated his patient’s hyperthyroidism and the gentleman quickly regained the 
weight he had lost.
Failure to Thrive in Children
As we discuss in detail in Chapter 14, although children with celiac disease 
can have similar symptoms (like abdominal discomfort and diarrhea) as 
adults, youngsters may also have one unique group of symptoms, which are 
collectively called failure to thrive.
A child who is failing to thrive will have stopped growing and developing at 
the rate of his or her siblings or peers. The child may also be less energetic, 
less able to concentrate (and therefore, his or her schoolwork may suffer), 
and less socially engaged. These symptoms improve when your child is on 
track with a gluten-free diet . . . in which case if they still don’t feel like doing 
their homework, they’ll have joined the ranks of many other healthy kids!

105
 Chapter 6: Symptoms of Celiac Disease
 Non-Gastrointestinal Symptoms 
and Celiac Disease
When most people think “celiac disease” — when they think of it at all — 
they think “gut.” And indeed, the gut is the root of the condition and the 
place that many people experience symptoms. Nonetheless, if you have celiac 
disease, you are at increased risk of other of your organs malfunctioning.
Your other organs may malfunction
 
✓ As a direct result or your celiac disease. An example of this direct 
effect would be celiac disease damaging your intestine and as a result 
impairing your ability to absorb vitamin D into your body with this, in 
turn, leading to osteoporosis.
 
✓ In association with celiac disease. If you have blond hair, you are more 
likely to have blue eyes but, of course, your blond hair did not cause 
you to have blue eyes. This is an association, not cause and effect. In 
the same vein, celiac disease affecting the gut may be associated with 
other bodily ailments without directly causing them. Sometimes, this is 
because if you have one type of immune disorder (like celiac disease), 
you are at increased risk of having other immune disorders (like type 1 
diabetes). More often, however, the reason for this association is either 
only partly known or is simply obscure.
In the following sections, we look at non-gastrointestinal symptoms that you 
may experience if you have celiac disease. Depending on the symptom in 
question, it may be present as a direct result of your celiac disease or, alter-
natively, may be present because you have an associated condition. In either 
case, we’ll let you know. For a detailed discussion on the diseases we men-
tion in this section, have a look at Chapters 7 and 8.
 
As you read in this section of the many ailments that are associated with 
celiac disease, please do us — and, more importantly, yourself — a favor and 
bear in mind that most people with celiac disease never experience any of 
the problems we discuss here. Having said that, they can and thus we feel it’s 
important that you be aware of them.
 
With some important exceptions (such as the skin rash called dermatitis her-
petiformis, which we discuss in a moment), each of the conditions we discuss 
in this section requires their own specific treatment. In other words, the 
gluten-free diet you need to follow to help control your celiac disease does not 
generally help you manage these other ailments.

106
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Rash decisions
If you have celiac disease, you are at increased risk of having one of several 
different types of skin rash. We discuss these conditions in detail in Chapter 8. 
In this section, we note the visual changes seen with some of the skin diseases 
most commonly linked to celiac disease.
 
✓ Dermatitis herpetiformis: If you develop small, intensely itchy, pinkish 
blisters on the elbows, knees, or buttocks (less often on the shoulders, 
scalp, face, and back), you may have dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). The 
link between DH and celiac disease is so strong that DH is sometimes 
referred to as “celiac disease of the skin.” Both conditions are triggered 
by exposure to gluten, have the same antibodies present, and respond 
to the elimination of gluten from the diet.
 
✓ Psoriasis: Should you have red, scaly sores affecting your skin — par-
ticularly the scalp, elbows, knees and back, this may indicate you have 
psoriasis.
 
✓ Vitiligo: If you develop patches of pale (to the point of being white) skin, 
you may have vitiligo.
Mulling over mood, thinking, 
and neurological issues
People with celiac disease are at increased risk of having certain mood, 
thinking, and neurological disorders. It is far from clear why this association 
exists, and it is always worth bearing in mind that an association isn’t the 
same thing as cause and effect. These are the related conditions to be aware 
of (and which we discuss in detail in Chapter 8):
 
✓ Ataxia is a condition in which the balance is affected, causing one to 
walk unsteadily.
 
✓ Epilepsy (“seizures”) is a condition in which episodes of abnormal 
electrical discharge occur in the brain leading, depending on the area 
involved, to abnormal movements or behaviors.
 
✓ Migraine headaches are intense, typically throbbing headaches, which 
are often preceded by visual warning symptoms.
 
✓ Peripheral neuropathy is a condition in which the nerves in the feet (far 
less often, the hands) are damaged, typically causing numbness.
 
✓ Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a condition in 
which the affected person has difficulty paying attention, tends to be 
overly active, and often acts impulsively.

107
 Chapter 6: Symptoms of Celiac Disease
 
✓ Autism is a condition in which the affected person has difficulties com-
municating and interacting socially.
 
✓ Depression and other psychiatric disorders.
Feeling fatigued
In the previous section, we list various mood, thinking, and neurological 
issues. But what if your problem is simply that you feel tired? Run down. 
Exhausted. Worn out. Could this be due to your celiac disease? The quick 
answer is, well, there is no quick answer. In this section, we look at the 
possibilities.
You might imagine that, if you have chronic abdominal pain, are getting 
recurring bouts of diarrhea, and are malnourished because you’re not suf-
ficiently absorbing important nutrients into your body, that you’d feel tired. 
You bet! So yes, if you have these symptoms, it would likely be no surprise to 
you that fatigue is part and parcel of the process. Fortunately, soon after you 
start your gluten-free diet, these symptoms start to ease (though, if you’re 
very malnourished, your tiredness may take longer to improve than the other 
symptoms we just mentioned).
Some people with celiac disease, however, feel fatigued even in the absence 
of gastrointestinal symptoms (and, as we discuss in detail in Chapter 5, most 
people with celiac disease have the so-called “atypical” type in which GI 
symptoms are minimal or non-existent). Although the cause may be unre-
lated and coincidental (literally thousands of different ailments can cause 
fatigue), there are a few celiac-related/associated conditions that can lead to 
fatigue and, therefore, should be considered by you and your doctor:
 
✓ Anemia. As we discuss in Chapter 7, there are several types of anemia 
that may occur if you have celiac disease. Of these, the most common 
one, and also the one most likely to lead to tiredness, is iron-deficiency 
anemia. This is typically readily determined by performing a simple 
blood test.
 
✓ Depression. Tiredness is a common symptom experienced by people 
who are depressed. It is, however, not the only symptom seen with 
depression; rather, it occurs in the context of a number of other features 
including difficulty sleeping, and feeling helpless and hopeless. We dis-
cuss depression in detail in Chapter 8.
 
✓ Fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is a musculoskeletal condition in which 
tiredness is a very common feature. We look in detail at fibromyalgia in 
Chapter 8.

108
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
 
✓ Thyroid disease. The thyroid gland is a small hormone-secreting gland 
located in the front of the neck just above the breastbone (sternum). 
As we discuss in detail in Chapter 8, the thyroid helps regulate a great 
many different processes in the body. If the thyroid is under-functioning 
(a condition called hypothyroidism), fatigue commonly results. What is 
far less widely known is that if the thyroid is over-functioning (a condi-
tion called hyperthyroidism), fatigue is also very frequently experienced. 
If you have celiac disease and you have unexplained fatigue, be sure to 
ask your health care provider if your thyroid function has been checked. 
Your thyroid function is readily tested by performing a simple blood 
test. (The most commonly used test to screen for thyroid malfunction is 
called a TSH, which stands for thyroid stimulating hormone.)
 
If your celiac disease is well-controlled yet you feel fatigued on an ongoing 
basis, you are doing yourself a disservice if you simply attribute your tired-
ness to the fact of your celiac disease. Instead, you should discuss your symp-
tom with your doctor to determine what else might be causing it.
Hormonal (endocrine) problems
If you have celiac disease, you are at increased risk of certain hormonal 
(endocrine) conditions (which we discuss in detail in Chapter 8):
 
✓ Addison’s disease is a disorder of the adrenal glands in which one loses 
weight loss and has low blood pressure and the skin darkens.
 
✓ Type 1 diabetes is a condition in which the body is unable to produce 
insulin, and as a result high blood glucose levels develop. Symptoms of 
elevated blood glucose include excess thirst, frequent urination, and 
weight loss.
 
✓ Thyroid over-functioning (hyperthyroidism), which can cause weight 
loss, fatigue, tremor, palpitations, diarrhea, and other symptoms.
 
✓ Thyroid under-functioning (hypothyroidism), which can cause weight 
gain, fatigue, dry skin, brittle hair, muscle aching, and other symptoms.
Musculoskeletal problems
If you have celiac disease you may be at increased risk of the following mus-
culoskeletal disorders:
 
✓ Rickets and osteoporosis are conditions in which there is insufficient 
bone strength and mass. We discuss these ailments in detail in Chapter 7.

109
 Chapter 6: Symptoms of Celiac Disease
 
✓ Rheumatologic problems (we discuss these in detail in Chapter 8) 
including:
 
• Sjogren’s syndrome is a condition in which you have decreased 
ability to make saliva and tears.
 
• SLE (“lupus” or, more fully, systemic lupus erythematosis) is a dis-
order in which the joints and other body tissues become inflamed 
and painful.
 
• Raynaud’s phenomenon is a condition in which blood flow to the 
fingers and toes is temporarily impaired upon exposure to cold 
temperatures leading to episodes of pallor of the digits.
 
• Fibromyalgia is a condition in which one experiences a variety of 
aches and pains but without evidence of inflammation in the body.
Cancer
Fortunately, cancer related to celiac disease (which we discuss in detail in 
Chapter 9) seldom occurs, but it can. Following are the most important types 
to be aware of:
 
✓ Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma is a form of lymph cell cancer.
 
✓ Small intestine adenocarcinoma is a form of cancer of the small intestine.
Gynecological and obstetrical problems
A variety of different, but related gynecological and obstetrical problems may 
occur if a woman has celiac disease, including:
 
✓ Irregular periods.
 
✓ Infertility. We discuss infertility in detail in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Miscarriages. We discuss pregnancy issues in detail in Chapter 14.
 
✓ Early (premature) delivery.
Other problems
Of the remaining, important disorders associated with celiac disease, the key 
ones to be aware of are:

110
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
 
✓ Anemia. Anemia can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, rapid heart 
beat, and other symptoms. We discuss anemia in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Mouth ailments such as aphthous ulcers (“canker sores”). See Chapter 7 
for more on mouth ailments.
 
✓ Dental problems such as loss of the tooth’s protective enamel coating. 
We discuss this in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Liver and bile duct disorders. Liver disease can lead to jaundice, bleed-
ing problems, and, potentially, many other problems. See Chapter 8 for a 
discussion on liver and bile duct disorders.
 
✓ IgA deficiency. This is a congenital (meaning that one is born with it) 
inability to produce normal amounts of the IgA form of antibody. We dis-
cuss IgA deficiency in Chapter 8.
 
✓ Chromosome defects. Turner syndrome and Down syndrome are condi-
tions due to abnormalities in the chromosomes. (Chromosomes contain 
DNA, which is the genetic blueprint responsible for many of the traits of 
living organisms.) We discuss these conditions in Chapter 8.

▶ Exploring how celiac disease can cause anemia and osteoporosis
▶ Looking at the link between celiac disease and infertility
A
s we explain in Chapter 2, celiac disease damages the small intestine 
and, as a result, impairs the ability to properly absorb nutrients into 
the body. This is called malabsorption. If you have malabsorption, nutrients 
you eat end up being wasted as they are lost from your body with your stool. 
The way in which malabsorption affects you depends on both the type of 
nutrients being malabsorbed and the degree to which this is happening. In 
this chapter, we look in detail at this subject. We also look at several other 
conditions that are related to celiac disease but where the connection to mal-
absorption is less clearly established.
As you read through the sometimes intimidating information you’ll find here, 
we hope you bear in mind two very important things: The various ailments we 
discuss in this chapter are often preventable (depending how and when your 
celiac disease was discovered) and are always treatable. And speaking of treat-
ment, in Chapter 15 we look at how often you should have laboratory tests 
done to monitor your body’s levels of many of the things we discuss here.
Vanishing Vitamins
For the most part, the vitamins that people require for good health are read-
ily available and consumed as part of a healthy diet. However, if you have 
celiac disease, you’re prone to malabsorbing some of the vitamins you ingest, 
leading to insufficient levels of these vitamins in your body. As a result, your 
health can suffer. In this section we look at the various vitamin deficiencies 
that can be seen with celiac disease.

112
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Considerations about taking 
vitamin supplements
Whether or not you have celiac disease, if you are currently taking, or are 
considering taking, vitamin supplements, bear in mind that, just like taking 
a prescription or over-the-counter medicine, taking vitamin supplements 
should be done with proper caution in order to ensure:
 
✓ You actually need any type of vitamin supplement in the first place. If 
you don’t need one, we’re sure you can find better things on which to 
spend your hard earned money.
 
✓ You take only the particular vitamin supplement(s) you need (that is, 
the vitamin(s) in which you are lacking or potentially lacking).
 
✓ You don’t take too much. Unbeknownst to many people, taking too 
much of a vitamin can be toxic.
 
When it comes to all things nutrition, including the taking of vitamin supple-
ments, your dietitian is the expert and best resource. (We like to think that 
as physicians we know a thing or two about nutrition, but we always gladly 
defer to the incredible expertise of the professional, highly trained, dietitians 
with whom we work in our clinics.) We recommend, if you have celiac disease, 
you make a point of speaking to your dietitian about your vitamin require-
ments and how best you can ensure you meet these through your healthy, 
gluten-free eating and, when necessary, by taking supplements. (Your doctor, 
however, needs to be involved, too, because he or she is typically the one to 
decide, with you, whether you need tests to measure certain of your vitamin 
levels, discussed in the following sections.)
 
In this section when we discuss the treatment of vitamin deficiencies, our rec-
ommendations should always be considered as supplementary to meticulously 
following a gluten-free diet.
Vitamin A
Vitamin A is found in:
 
✓ Liver, beef, chicken
 
✓ Eggs, cheese, milk, butter, margarine
 
✓ Carrots, sweet potatoes, spinach, and other green vegetables
 
✓ Mangoes, oranges

113
 Chapter 7: Conditions Caused by Celiac Disease
Deficiency of vitamin A can lead to:
 
✓ The inability to properly see in dim light (night blindness). If not treated, 
with time this can progress to complete blindness.
 
✓ Poor bone development and impaired growth in children.
 
✓ Reduced functioning of the immune system, thus increasing one’s sus-
ceptibility to infections.
 
✓ Dry hair, dry and itchy skin, fragile and easily broken fingernails.
 
✓ Miscarriages and reduced ability to breastfeed.
Healthy people living in developed societies like North America rarely develop 
vitamin A deficiency. If you have celiac disease, you will be unlikely to ever 
develop vitamin A deficiency unless your condition is very severe. Therefore, 
routine use of vitamin A supplements is not necessary. However, if your eye-
sight in low light conditions is not what it should be, let your doctor know. He 
or she can send you for a blood test to measure your vitamin A level.
Vitamin B9 (folate or folic acid)
Vitamin B9, more commonly known as folate or folic acid, is found in:
 
✓ Green, leafy vegetables (such as spinach, swiss chard, cabbage, kale, 
cauliflower, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts)
 
✓ Citrus fruits
 
✓ Beans
 
✓ Animal products
Deficiency of vitamin B9 can lead to:
 
✓ Anemia (see “Low Blood: Anemia” later in this chapter for more 
information).
 
✓ Premature atherosclerosis (“hardening of the arteries”) which, in 
turn, increases the risk of heart attack and stroke. (This is not yet 
fully proven.)
 
✓ Pregnancy complications including damage to the fetus’s developing 
spinal cord.
 
✓ Soreness and inflammation of the tongue.
Contrary to what many people think, vitamin B9 deficiency does not cause 
nerve damage.

114
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Folic acid deficiency is fairly common if you have celiac disease. Therefore, 
when they are first “working up” a person for celiac disease, doctors rou-
tinely test a patient’s blood to see whether the patient is low in this vitamin. 
If you have celiac disease and you are deficient in folic acid, in addition to 
following a gluten-free diet, you should ensure that your diet is rich in foods 
containing this vitamin. It’s also advisable that you take a folic acid supple-
ment (typically in a dose of 1 to 5 mg per day) for anywhere from 1 to 4 
months. Of course, be sure to check with your own health care provider to 
find out what your specific situation calls for.
Vitamin B12
Vitamin B12 is found in:
 
✓ Animal products
 
✓ Dairy products
Because vitamin B12 is found only in animal products (dairy products being 
an extension of this), deficiency is common amongst otherwise healthy 
people who avoid all animal products.
Deficiency of vitamin B12 can lead to:
 
✓ Anemia (see “Low Blood: Anemia” later in this chapter).
 
✓ Nerve damage leading to an unsteady gait.
 
✓ Impaired thinking, memory, and change to one’s personality.
 
✓ Soreness and inflammation of the tongue.
Vitamin B12 is absorbed into the body from the end part of the small intestine 
(the terminal ileum; see Chapter 2 for an in-depth discussion of the small 
intestine). Because this area of the bowel is seldom damaged by celiac dis-
ease, vitamin B12 deficiency is not common in this condition. If, however, you 
do have vitamin B12 deficiency (which can generally be determined by a rou-
tine blood test) due to celiac disease, then the treatment consists of consum-
ing sufficient quantities of foods that are rich in this vitamin and, until your 
bowel is healed and your vitamin B12 levels are back to normal, taking an oral 
vitamin B12 supplement. In some cases, celiac disease leads to severe enough 
malabsorption of this vitamin that oral supplements aren’t sufficient; in those 
cases, vitamin B12 needs to be given by periodic injection into a muscle.

115
 Chapter 7: Conditions Caused by Celiac Disease
Vitamin D
Vitamin D is found in:
 
✓ Fatty fish
 
✓ Eggs
Because so few foods naturally contain vitamin D, it is added to many other 
food products (such as milk). Also, sun exposure allows a person’s skin to 
naturally make one’s own vitamin D (which we think is pretty cool).
Deficiency of vitamin D can lead to:
 
✓ Osteoporosis in adults, rickets in children, and bone pain. (We discuss 
osteoporosis and rickets later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Calcium deficiency.
 
✓ Decreased immune function.
Many other ailments including some types of cancer, premature atheroscle-
rosis (“hardening of the arteries”), diabetes, and multiple sclerosis also seem 
to occur more often in people with vitamin D deficiency although whether 
this is related to cause and effect is not yet known. Determining if there is a 
link between low vitamin D levels and these other diseases — and, if so, why 
the link is there — has become a hot topic in medical research circles.
Although vitamin D deficiency occurs commonly in the general population, it 
is particularly frequent in people with celiac disease and doctors, therefore, 
routinely measure their patients’ vitamin D levels. In addition to following 
a gluten-free diet, treatment consists of taking vitamin D supplements and, 
when necessary, calcium. The dose of vitamin D that you require needs be to 
individualized but usual doses, depending on your dietary intake, range from 
400 to 1,000 units per day. 
 
As they get older, many people, with or without celiac disease, do not have 
sufficient intake of vitamin D in their diets or sufficient sun exposure to make 
enough vitamin D. (Also, the skin’s ability to make vitamin D deteriorates as 
one ages. Geesh, this getting old stuff sure has its challenges!) For this reason, 
routine use of vitamin D supplements is often advised by health care provid-
ers for their patients in this situation. Be sure to ask your health care provider 
whether you should routinely take vitamin D (and calcium) regardless of how 
active your celiac disease is.

Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Vitamin E
Vitamin E is found in:
 
✓ Green, leafy vegetables (such as spinach, swiss chard, cabbage, kale, 
cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts)
 
✓ Asparagus, avocado
 
✓ Oils (vegetable, soybean, canola, corn, cottonseed)
 
✓ Nuts and seeds
 
✓ Milk, eggs
Deficiency of vitamin E can lead to:
 
✓ Anemia
 
✓ Nerve damage
 
✓ Muscle injury
Unless your celiac disease is very severe, you are unlikely to ever develop 
vitamin E deficiency. Therefore, routine testing for vitamin E deficiency is not 
required, and routine supplements are unnecessary.
Vitamin K
Vitamin K is found in:
 
✓ Green, leafy vegetables (such as spinach, swiss chard, cabbage, kale, 
cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts)
 
✓ Avocado
 
✓ Kiwi fruit
The human gut, through the action of the bacteria that normally reside in the 
small intestine (part of the microbiome, the name for the collective group of 
microbes that live within our gut), also manufacturers some vitamin K from 
other nutrients that are eaten. (Clearly — and we admit to some editorial and 
perhaps philosophical license here — the fact that the human body with its 
resident microbiome actually makes vitamin K, just as it does vitamin D (see 
the earlier section) — suggests to us that evolution has determined these to 
be incredibly important vitamins for human survival.)
Deficiency of vitamin K can lead to:
 
✓ Impaired ability of the blood to clot (coagulate); this can result in easy 
bruising, and bleeding from the gums, bladder, gut, and other organs.

117
 Chapter 7: Conditions Caused by Celiac Disease
 
✓ Impaired bone growth and strength. (Why vitamin K deficiency leads to 
bone problems is not fully sorted out.)
Unless your celiac disease is very severe, it is highly unlikely you will be defi-
cient in vitamin K, and neither routinely testing for this nor use of vitamin K 
supplements is necessary. Having said that, if ever you notice unexpected or 
undue bleeding, it is imperative that you — or anyone for that matter — seek 
urgent medical attention.
Missing Minerals
Like vitamins and other nutrients, minerals are also absorbed into our bodies 
in the small intestine so if you have active celiac disease (that is, there is 
ongoing inflammation of your small intestine), you’re at risk of certain min-
eral deficiencies.
 
In this section, when we discuss the treatment of mineral deficiencies, our rec-
ommendations should always be considered as supplementary to meticulously 
following a gluten-free diet.
Calcium deficiency
Calcium is found in:
 
✓ Milk products including milk, yogurt, ice cream, certain cheeses
 
✓ Tofu
 
✓ Canned salmon or sardines containing bones
 
✓ Dark green vegetables, dried beans
Calcium is also often added to foods such as some brands of orange juice, 
rice beverages, and soy beverages.
Deficiency of calcium can lead to:
 
✓ Osteoporosis and, in children, rickets. (We discuss these conditions 
later in this chapter.)
 
✓ Muscle spasms.
 
✓ Seizures (also known as convulsions or epilepsy).
 
✓ Fatigue, irritability, anxiety, and depression.

118
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Calcium deficiency due to celiac disease is seldom severe enough to cause 
seizures. More often, when present, it’s impact is confined to interfering with 
normal bone growth and strength.
Health care providers routinely monitor blood calcium (and vitamin D) levels 
in people with celiac disease — particularly, active celiac disease. If you 
are deficient in calcium, treatment consists of taking calcium supplements, 
usually in a dose ranging from one to several grams per day depending on 
your specific situation including your dietary intake. Also, to maintain good 
bone health, many women — regardless of whether or not they have celiac 
disease — are recommended to take calcium supplements. Speak to your 
dietitian to find out your particular requirements.
 
Low calcium due to celiac disease rarely occurs in isolation; more commonly 
it occurs in the context of low levels of vitamin D. Therefore, supplements of 
both calcium and vitamin D are typically required in this situation.
Iron deficiency
Iron is found in:
 
✓ Red meat
 
✓ Tuna, salmon
 
✓ Chicken and other poultry
 
✓ Clams, oysters, mussels
 
✓ Lentils, beans, chick peas
Some foods are supplemented with iron (so called “iron fortified” foods) 
during processing.
 
Iron found in red meat, fish, poultry, and seafood is more readily absorbed 
into the body (more bioavailable) than is iron found in vegetables, fortified 
foods, or in oral iron supplements.
Deficiency of iron can lead to:
 
✓ Anemia (discussed in detail in the later section “Low Blood: Anemia”).
 
✓ Fatigue. (Iron deficiency can cause fatigue even if anemia is not present.)
 
✓ Tongue pain, dry mouth, and hair loss. These occur infrequently.
Iron deficiency occurs commonly in people with celiac disease. In fact, the 
detection of anemia (due to iron deficiency) is often the first clue that a 
person has celiac disease. Health care providers routinely measure iron 
levels in people with celiac disease.

119
 Chapter 7: Conditions Caused by Celiac Disease
Successfully treating iron deficiency
The mainstays of treating iron deficiency due to celiac disease are to follow 
a gluten-free diet, to ensure one’s diet contains sufficient iron, and, for most 
people, to take an iron supplement. We list iron-rich foods earlier in this sec-
tion; for a full discussion of a gluten-free diet, go to Chapter 10. Here are key 
points regarding oral iron supplements:
 
✓ Three types of oral iron supplements are available: ferrous fumarate, 
ferrous gluconate, and ferrous sulfate. Although a virtually infinite 
number of oral iron preparations are sold on the market, they all contain 
just one of these three types of iron (called iron salts).
 
✓ Each of the available iron supplements contain different amounts of 
iron. When reading the labels on iron supplements, be sure to differenti-
ate the total iron content of a pill from the elemental iron content. It is 
only the elemental iron content that is meaningful. Also, each of these 
iron salts has a different cost, ferrous sulfate being the least expensive.
 
✓ Coated or sustained-release iron supplements are less effective than 
regular iron supplements. Iron is absorbed best from the duodenum 
and the first part of the jejunum (refer to Chapter 2 for a discussion of 
these parts of the small intestine), but coated and sustained-release iron 
formulations are absorbed further down the gut. This mismatch means 
that these iron preparations are less well absorbed into the body.
 
✓ They work less well when taken at the same time as food. Certain con-
stituents of food (such as phosphates) attach to the orally taken iron 
and interfere with its absorption into the body. This is particularly true 
of milk, eggs, coffee, tea, fiber, and cereals. In general, it is best to take 
oral iron supplements on an empty stomach (see later in this list).
 
✓ They shouldn’t be taken at the same time as antacids. Antacids inter-
fere with the absorption of oral iron supplements; therefore, take your 
iron at least 2 hours before, or at least 4 hours after, taking an antacid.
 
✓ Taking vitamin C (ascorbic acid) or drinking a glass of citrus juice 
(like orange juice) at the same time as your iron pill will help the iron 
get absorbed into your body. If you are taking vitamin C, a dose of 250 
mg is recommended.
 
✓ Iron supplements can cause gastrointestinal side effects. GI side-effects 
due to oral iron therapy are quite commonly seen. Symptoms include 
nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, constipation, and, sometimes, 
diarrhea. It’s important to be aware of this lest you think these symp-
toms reflect a problem with your celiac disease acting up. If you are 
having GI side effects from your oral iron pills, speak to your doctor or 
dietician who may recommend the following:
 
• Reducing your dose then gradually building the dose back up. Using 
a low dose then gradually increasing the dose may be better toler-
ated by the gut.

120
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
 
• Taking your iron with food rather than on an empty stomach. Oral 
iron taken with food causes fewer GI side effects than when it is 
taken on an empty stomach. On the other hand, when taken with 
food, the iron is less well absorbed. One way around this is to take 
a higher dose of the iron with food.
 
• Changing to a different iron preparation. Ferrous gluconate may 
cause fewer GI side effects than the other types of oral iron. (This, 
however, is arguable since the amount of elemental, as opposed 
to total, iron in ferrous gluconate pills is considerably less than is 
found in ferrous fumarate or ferrous sulfate. In other words, it may 
be the amount of iron, not the type of iron, that is responsible for 
the side effects.)
 
• Taking liquid iron supplements if you are unable to tolerate any of 
the available iron pills. Liquid iron is called ferrous sulfate elixir.
 
Speak to your dietitian to find out which type and what amount of iron supple-
ment is recommended for your specific situation.
What about iron given by injection?
Because iron taken by mouth is often not well-tolerated, the question comes 
up whether iron can be given by injection instead. Indeed, there are iron 
preparations, expressly designed for this purpose, that are injected by a 
health care provider into a patient’s muscle or vein. Such injections are 
sometimes used to treat iron deficiency in very special situations (such as 
in people who cannot benefit from oral iron because they have had surgical 
removal of their small intestine) and can prove invaluable. Nonetheless, this 
form of iron therapy should not be used routinely, especially when oral iron 
can be used instead.
These are potential hazards to iron injections:
 
✓ The iron leaving a permanent mark (a tattooing effect) on the skin where 
the needle was inserted when injecting iron into a muscle.
 
✓ An allergic reaction to the iron. Such reactions, not seen with oral iron, 
can be dangerous, even fatal. We can think of few things worse than 
someone dying from being given an injection of a medicine that could 
have been given perfectly safely in an oral form.
 
✓ Animal studies suggest that iron injections into muscle can lead to tumors.
 
✓ Injections can cause side effects such as joint pains, back pain, chills, 
muscle aching, nausea, and vomiting. These side effects typically go 
away within a few days.
If the preceding information is a shock to you, you are in good company. 
Indeed, we routinely witness the stunned expression on the faces of the medi-
cal students and junior doctors we teach when we share this same informa-
tion with them.

121
 Chapter 7: Conditions Caused by Celiac Disease
Other mineral deficiencies
In addition to the minerals discussed previously, small amounts of copper, 
magnesium, selenium, and zinc are also required for good health. It is rare for 
a person with celiac disease to be deficient in these elements; therefore, rou-
tine testing or supplementing for these is unnecessary unless a person has 
severe diarrhea or evidence of marked malnutrition.
Low Blood: Anemia
Anemia is defined as an insufficient number of red blood cells. To make red 
blood cells, the bone marrow requires iron, folic acid, and vitamin B12. If your 
celiac disease has lead to deficiency in these nutrients, anemia may result. 
Since the main job of red blood cells is to carry oxygen to the body’s various 
organs, if you’re anemic, your heart, muscles, and other organs are deprived 
of this vital substance. As a result, you may experience symptoms such as 
fatigue, shortness of breath, and reduced stamina when exercising.
 
If you experience the symptoms we just mentioned, be sure to ask your doctor 
whether he or she has recently checked your hemoglobin level (it’s done on a 
blood test) — and, if not, ask for the test.
Anemia due to low iron (“iron-
deficiency anemia”)
As we discuss earlier in this chapter, iron deficiency occurs commonly in 
active celiac disease. When iron deficiency leads to anemia, the condition 
is (unimaginatively, but straightforwardly) called iron deficiency anemia. 
Because iron deficiency anemia is so common in celiac disease, we look at it 
in detail in this section.
How is iron deficiency anemia diagnosed?
Iron deficiency anemia is diagnosed when blood tests show that a person has 
both anemia and low iron.
 
Several different types of blood tests are used to determine whether someone 
is iron deficient. Each of these tests has its pros and cons. The most accurate 
test to determine if you lack sufficient iron is the ferritin. Having a low ferritin 
guarantees you are deficient in iron. Nonetheless, a normal ferritin doesn’t 
guarantee that you are not iron deficient so other tests or a combination of 
tests are often used.

122
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Ensuring your celiac disease isn’t overlooked 
if you have iron deficiency anemia
If your celiac disease has not yet been discovered, and your doctor deter-
mines that you have iron deficiency anemia, celiac disease will likely not be 
high on the radar and you’ll be at risk of having the real cause of your anemia 
(that is, your celiac disease) overlooked. Why? Because from the beginning 
of medical school, doctors-to-be are taught that if they hear hoof beats, they 
should “think horses, not zebras.” This advice is perfectly reasonable and 
sensible, but what if what they’re hearing actually is a zebra? In other words, 
what if your iron deficiency anemia is caused by celiac disease rather than 
one of the more common causes such as menstrual blood loss in a woman or 
colon cancer in an older person of either gender?
Following are a few scenarios where iron deficiency anemia is commonly 
misattributed. If ever you — or a loved one — are in this situation, you can 
help steer the doctor in the right direction. (Fortunately, doctors nowadays 
are more aware of celiac disease in general and iron deficiency due to celiac 
disease in particular, so they’re less likely to overlook this cause than they 
used to be.)
The woman who has periods
Many, many women who have periods have iron deficiency anemia because 
of the iron lost with their periods (blood is rich in iron). Because this occurs 
so often, most doctors who discover one of their female patients who men-
struates has iron deficiency anemia will, perfectly appropriately, forego what 
would typically be unnecessary tests and, instead, simply prescribe iron 
therapy. We wouldn’t be surprised if you, too, have been in this situation.
The key to avoiding having the diagnosis of celiac disease overlooked is this: 
If your iron deficiency anemia is being treated with iron supplements — and 
assuming you’ve been taking them as prescribed — yet you continue to be 
iron deficient, ask your doctor about the possibility that the real problem is 
malabsorption of iron due to celiac disease.
The older person
Any doctor worth his salt (or worthy of your trust as a patient) would never, 
ever, fail to investigate the cause of iron deficiency anemia amongst older 
people (or, for that matter, in women who don’t menstruate or in men of 
any age).
Iron deficiency anemia in the elderly is most commonly due to bleeding from 
the intestine, invariably in such tiny quantities that it’s not visible. This is 
called occult GI blood loss. (Occult as in hidden, not as in sorcery, witchcraft, 
or other such things.)
Because occult GI blood loss is often due to serious diseases, a thorough 
search for the cause must be undertaken. This search typically involves 
having a colonoscopy (where the doctor performing the test will look for a 

123
 Chapter 7: Conditions Caused by Celiac Disease
variety of abnormalities, the most important of which is colon cancer). If the 
colonoscopy is normal, the next step is typically to have an upper endoscopy 
(that is, a scope of your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum; we discuss 
this procedure in Chapter 3) where the doctor will look for problems such as 
cancer, ulcers, and abnormal blood vessels.
The key to avoiding having the diagnosis of celiac disease overlooked in this 
situation is this: if you have had all the appropriate investigations looking 
for evidence of occult GI bleeding and if the tests have found no such cause, 
your doctor should test you for celiac disease. They may know this or they 
may not. If your doctor doesn’t raise the possibility that you may have celiac 
disease and doesn’t arrange further investigations to look for this condition, 
take the initiative and mention to your doctor the possible diagnosis of celiac 
disease. (As always, feel free to blame us for putting you up to this task!)
 
Save yourself an extra endoscopy! If as part of investigations to determine 
if you’re having occult GI bleeding you’re scheduled for an endoscopy, in 
advance of having the procedure done, ask the doctor doing the test to do a 
small intestine biopsy while they’re at it. Otherwise, the endoscopy may end 
up needing to be repeated later on if, once GI bleeding has been excluded, the 
diagnosis of celiac disease is only then being entertained.
How is iron deficiency anemia treated?
The treatment of iron deficiency due to celiac disease is to follow a gluten-
free diet, to ensure your diet includes sufficient iron, and to take oral iron 
supplements as needed. We discuss this topic in detail in the earlier section 
“Iron deficiency.”
 
Andrew, a 35 year-old plumber, was seeing his family physician for a regular 
check-up. He had routine blood tests performed and, to the doctor’s and 
Andrew’s surprise, these revealed that Andrew had anemia. Further blood 
tests revealed that the cause of the anemia was low iron. The doctor sent 
Andrew for a colonoscopy to make sure he wasn’t losing blood from the 
large intestine. The test was normal. Similarly, an endoscopy found Andrew’s 
stomach and small intestine to look normal. Nonetheless, the wise doctor 
performing the endoscopy thought to perform small intestine biopsies, and 
these came back showing typical features of celiac disease. Andrew was sent 
to a dietitian, placed on a gluten-free diet and iron supplements, and in a few 
months his iron level and hemoglobin were both back to normal. At no time 
had Andrew experienced symptoms.
 
As Andrew from the preceding anecdote discovered, you can have celiac 
disease even if you feel completely well, and iron deficiency anemia may be 
the first clue to the presence of your ailment. Indeed, this is one of the most 
common ways that celiac disease first shows up.
If you have iron deficiency due to celiac disease, once you have been on a 
gluten-free diet and iron supplements for a number of months and your iron 

124
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
levels are back to normal, ongoing iron supplements are typically no longer 
required. There are, however, two main exceptions to this: if you’re a veg-
etarian, especially a vegan (as we discuss in Chapter 11, such individuals can 
have difficulty consuming sufficient quantities of dietary iron) or a woman 
who experiences heavy periods. For these people, ongoing use of oral iron 
supplements is often required.
Anemia due to low levels of folic acid
Like iron deficiency, folic acid (folate) deficiency is also common in people 
with active celiac disease. Anemia from folic acid deficiency, however, occurs 
far less often than anemia due to iron deficiency.
 
In your Internet travels, you may come across the term megaloblastic anemia. 
This refers to anemia due to either folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency.
Celiac disease leads to folic acid deficiency and, hence, anemia because of 
insufficient absorption of this nutrient into the body which in turn occurs 
because of inflammation in the small intestine. If you are known to have 
celiac disease, your doctor will likely be routinely monitoring your hemoglo-
bin and folic acid levels. (We discuss ongoing monitoring of celiac disease in 
Chapter 15.)
In addition to following a gluten-free diet, treatment consists of ensuring your 
diet is rich in folic acid. We discuss this topic in detail earlier in this chapter; 
see the section “Vitamin B9 (folate or folic acid).”
Anemia due to low levels of vitamin B12
Anemia due to low levels of vitamin B12 occurs uncommonly in celiac disease. 
Unlike iron and folic acid, vitamin B12 is absorbed into the body from the end 
part of the small intestine (the terminal ileum); an area of the bowel seldom 
damaged by celiac disease.
We discuss the symptoms of — and the treatment of — vitamin B12 deficiency 
earlier in this chapter; see “Vitamin B12 deficiency”.
 
In your other reading — of the cyber or more conventional varieties — you 
may come across the term pernicious anemia. Like celiac disease, pernicious 
anemia is also an autoimmune disease; however, the mechanism by which it 
leads to vitamin B12 deficiency is very different.

125
 Chapter 7: Conditions Caused by Celiac Disease
Skeleton Isn’t Just An Olympic Sport: 
Celiac Disease and Your Bones
Although people often tend to think of their bones as being inanimate, in fact, 
bones are incredibly dynamic, with new bone constantly being formed and 
old bone constantly being removed. During childhood, the amount of new 
bone being formed is much greater than the amount being removed and, as 
people age (particularly as we reach our later years), the converse is true.
Since, as we discuss earlier in this chapter, celiac disease may cause mal-
absorption of calcium and vitamin D (both of which are essential for healthy 
bone development and maintenance), this condition puts you at risk of bone 
problems. We discuss these bone abnormalities in this section.
Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a condition in which you lose bone mass (quantity) and 
strength. If you have osteoporosis, you are at increased risk of having a hip 
fracture or a fracture of a bone (vertebrae) in your back. Though osteoporo-
sis is very common even in otherwise perfectly healthy people, having celiac 
disease increases your risk that much further.
Testing you for osteoporosis
The standard test to detect osteoporosis is a form of x-ray called a bone 
mineral density (BMD) test. During this fast and painless procedure, measure-
ments of bone density are made in both the back (the lumbar spine) and the 
hip (the femur; that is, the thigh bone).
Most people in North America are sent by their primary care provider for 
routine BMD testing once they reach the age of 65; however, if you have 
celiac disease, you’re at risk of developing osteoporosis at a considerably 
younger age. For this reason, if you have celiac disease, discuss with your 
doctor whether you should have your BMD test performed even if you are 
decades from collecting your old age pension. The need for this will vary 
depending on your particular situation.
Treating your osteoporosis
Treatment for osteoporosis due to celiac disease includes the following:
 
✓ Following a gluten-free diet. Like other complications related to celiac 
disease, the first step in successfully treating your osteoporosis is fol-
lowing a gluten-free diet. Doing so helps ensure you properly absorb the 
calcium and vitamin D you ingest.

126
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
 
 We strongly advise that everyone with celiac disease see a registered 
dietitian to receive expert guidance regarding a gluten-free diet; seeing a 
dietitian becomes even more important if you have osteoporosis. If you 
have celiac disease and you haven’t yet seen a dietitian, ask your doctor 
to refer you to one or refer yourself.
 
✓ Consuming sufficient amounts of calcium. You should ingest 1.5 grams 
of calcium per day if you have osteoporosis. As most people don’t get 
this amount from their diet, calcium supplements are typically neces-
sary to make up the shortfall. (Again, your dietitian is the best person to 
help you determine how to get the right amount of calcium in your diet 
and how much, if any, supplemental calcium you should take.)
 
✓ Consuming sufficient quantities of magnesium. Magnesium is involved 
with regulating how calcium is absorbed into the body. It is important, 
therefore, that you consume sufficient quantities of magnesium. Your 
dietitian can advise you whether you require magnesium supplements 
and, if so, how much.
 
✓ Consuming sufficient quantities of vitamin D. You should ingest 
approximately 1000 units of vitamin D per day. As with calcium, most 
people require vitamin D supplements in order to reach this amount. 
Your dietitian can review with you how much vitamin D you are getting 
in your diet and how much supplemental vitamin D you need to take.
 
✓ Prescription medication. Depending on the severity of your osteoporo-
sis, you may benefit from taking prescription drugs such as bisphospho-
nates. Your family doctor is typically the first person you should speak 
to regarding whether or not you should take prescription drugs for your 
osteoporosis.
 
The preceding recommendations regarding diet, calcium, and vitamin D intake 
are also the most effective strategies to prevent osteoporosis from developing 
in the first place. As we discuss in Chapter 11, the quantity of vitamin D and 
calcium you need to ingest to help prevent osteoporosis depends on your age 
and other factors. We recommend you speak to your dietitian and physician 
to find out the best amounts for your specific situation.
If you have osteoporosis, your doctor should periodically send you for 
follow-up BMD testing to ensure you are responding sufficiently well to the 
therapies we just discussed. (Many U.S. insurers cover the cost of BMD tests 
performed every 2 years if your initial test was abnormal.)
Rickets
Whereas osteoporosis (see the preceding section) is a condition wherein 
adults lose bone they’ve previously acquired, rickets is a disease of childhood 
in which bone is not properly or sufficiently made in the first place.

127
 Chapter 7: Conditions Caused by Celiac Disease
Just like you need sufficient amounts of raw materials (brick, mortar, and so 
on) to make a brick house, so too do children need the right amounts of cal-
cium and vitamin D in order to create a healthy skeleton. If a child has undi-
agnosed or untreated celiac disease, he or she may not be able to properly 
absorb these nutrients into the body and as a result can develop rickets.
The skeletal abnormality most likely to develop depends on the age of the 
affected child; toddlers, for example, may develop outward bowing of the legs 
(unimaginatively — but aptly — referred to as bow legs), and older children 
may develop inward bending of the legs (knock knees).
Impaired bone development isn’t the only feature of rickets. Other findings 
include:
 
✓ Bone pain
 
✓ Muscle weakness
 
✓ Dental problems (such as poor enamel)
 
✓ Seizures. These are most likely to occur in infants with rickets and are 
related to low calcium levels.
If a child has rickets, it is usually detected when either a parent notices the 
child is not developing normally and therefore brings the youngster to the 
doctor (who confirms the observation), or when a physician examines a child 
brought in for a routine check-up. 
 
If your child has celiac disease, the doctor will know that celiac disease can 
cause rickets and will monitor your child for this. A child with celiac disease 
who carefully follows a gluten-free diet and ingests the right amounts of the 
right nutrients (which your dietitian can teach you all about) as part of a 
healthy diet can expect to develop perfectly healthy bones.
The treatment of rickets (if the rickets is caused by celiac disease) consists of a 
gluten-free diet and sufficient ingestion of calcium and vitamin D. The required 
amounts of calcium and vitamin D depend on the age of the child and the 
severity of the problem. As always, it’s essential that you and your child meet 
with a dietitian to receive expert advice tailored for your specific situation. 
Fortunately, if rickets is detected and treated sufficiently early (especially if the 
child’s bones are still developing), an excellent response to therapy is typically 
seen and, ultimately, the child’s bones can return to normal.
Osteomalacia
Osteomalacia, like osteoporosis, is a condition in which the bones are “weak” 
and prone to fracturing. Also, both conditions have reduced bone density. 
The main difference between the two conditions is that in osteoporosis the 
internal architecture of the bones is preserved, whereas in osteomalacia the 

128
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
architecture is damaged (referred to as defective bone mineralization). By 
way of analogy, imagine a thick wall built of reinforced concrete. If this wall 
had osteoporosis (hmm, we did say imagine), the concrete would be too thin 
but otherwise preserved. If this wall had osteomalacia, the main problem 
would be that the internal reinforcing rods were defective and weak at the 
time the wall was first constructed.
Osteoporosis and osteomalacia share much in common, such as vitamin 
D malabsorption being an important cause and treatment including taking 
supplemental vitamin D and calcium (in addition, of course, to following a 
gluten-free diet). One significant difference between the two conditions is 
that although osteoporosis does not cause symptoms (unless it causes a frac-
ture), osteomalacia can be associated with bone pains and tenderness, and 
muscle weakness. Also, osteomalacia often requires treatment with higher 
doses of vitamin D than does osteoporosis.
Oral Health
Celiac disease can affect various parts of the mouth including the teeth, 
tongue, and gums. We, ahem, look into mouth issues in this section.
Dental health
Enamel is the hard, white, outer coating of the teeth. Children with celiac dis-
ease may develop dental problems as a result of defects in this enamel.
 
When Marjorie noticed her five year-old son, Jimmy, to have yellowed teeth she 
became concerned and took him to the dentist. The dentist asked her if she had 
taken tetracycline during her pregnancy (a known cause of this), but she hadn’t. 
Had he been receiving excess fluoride (another known cause)? Nope. Being 
both smart and tenacious, the dentist did not leave things at that, but rather 
considered other possible causes including celiac disease. She referred Jimmy 
to a pediatric gastroenterologist and, several investigations later, the diagno-
sis of celiac disease was confirmed. Jimmy had not had even a single other 
symptom.
When celiac disease causes damage to the enamel, the affected teeth are 
typically located symmetrically within the mouth (that is, the same teeth on 
both sides of the mouth are affected). Also, the teeth most likely to be injured 
are the incisors. (The incisors are the pointed teeth toward the front of the 
mouth.) Although the enamel can be injured in several different ways, discol-
oration (with the teeth turning cream-, yellow-, or brown-colored) is the most 
common problem.

129
 Chapter 7: Conditions Caused by Celiac Disease
The exact cause of the damage to the enamel is unknown, but it is likely not 
simply a problem with insufficient absorption of nutrients — such as calcium — 
from the gut. Treatment with a gluten-free diet helps prevent further dental 
problems, but, unfortunately, the established enamel defects do not resolve. 
Older children and adults can be treated by their dentist with a variety of 
cosmetic procedures to cover the enamel defects.
The rest of the mouth
These are other things that can go wrong in the mouth if you have celiac 
disease:
 
✓ The tongue can become sore or have a burning feeling. (Similar symptoms 
can also be seen if you have low levels of iron, folic acid, or vitamin B12.)
 
✓ Canker sores (aphthous ulcers) can develop.
 
✓ You may develop sore, cracking of the skin at the corners of the mouth 
(a condition called angular stomatitis or angular cheiltis).
 
✓ The mouth may feel dry. This may be due to decreased saliva produc-
tion; however, in some people this symptom is present despite normal 
amounts of saliva.
Typically, all these problems nicely improve soon after you start a gluten-
free diet.
Infertility and Complications 
of Pregnancy
Having celiac disease may make it more difficult for a couple to conceive; 
that is, celiac disease may increase the risk of infertility. Also, once pregnant, 
a woman with celiac disease may be at increased risk of having a miscarriage. 
These risks are most likely to apply to people with untreated or insufficiently 
treated celiac disease.
Although the explanation(s) for the increased risk of infertility and miscar-
riages is not fully sorted out, factors may include reduced levels of impor-
tant nutrients and abnormal hormone levels. In a woman with active celiac 
disease there may be less frequent ovulation, and in a man, sperm may be 
abnormal or male hormone levels (such as testosterone) may be reduced. 
Additionally, both men and women with active celiac disease are at increased 
risk of other hormonal disorders — such as thyroid disease — that can 
impact on normal reproductive function.
We discuss these topics in detail in Chapter 14.

Hyposplenism and Increased 
Risk of Infection
Until not too long ago, the spleen was thought to be an unimportant organ. 
And until not too long ago, it was also thought that a man couldn’t run a four 
minute mile, the atom couldn’t be split, the sound barrier couldn’t be broken, 
we’d never finish this book before our editor’s deadline . . . well, you get the 
point. In fact, it is now known that the spleen has a number of important func-
tions in maintaining good health, one of which is to help protect against seri-
ous infections from a bacteria called pneumococcus.
There is some (limited) evidence that if a person has active celiac disease, 
his or her spleen may not function normally (a condition called hyposplen-
ism) and as a result that person would be at increased risk of infections from 
the aforementioned pneumococcus germ. For this reason, some experts 
recommend that people with celiac disease be given a pneumococcal vac-
cination to lower the risk of getting this infection. The jury is still out on this 
advice, and we feel it’s premature to recommend this to all people with celiac 
disease. Instead, it should be determined on a case-by-case basis depending 
on your individual circumstances. (There are other conditions for which the 
pneumococcal vaccine is recommended, so speak to your health care pro-
vider to see whether your particular health situation may warrant you being 
given this vaccine.)

H
aving celiac disease doesn’t make you an unhealthy person. Indeed, 
once you found out you had celiac disease, you may have become 
more knowledgeable about your health and more aware of good nutrition 
than most people around you. Not only that, you likely also discovered that 
(gluten-containing foods excepted) you can eat a wide variety of foods, exer-
cise regularly, and, basically, do anything you want to do.
You may be awaiting a “but” and, indeed, here it is: Because you have celiac 
disease, you are at increased risk of having certain other types of health 
conditions. Some of these are directly related to celiac disease, and others are 
simply associated with celiac disease. In Chapter 7, we look at those condi-
tions that are directly related (such as active celiac disease causing malab-
sorption of iron in turn leading to anemia). In this chapter, we look at those 
conditions, such as type 1 diabetes, that are associated with celiac disease.
 
We discuss a number of different health conditions in this chapter. Although 
disparate in many ways, they do have one important thing in common: Apart 
from dermatitis herpetiformis, no definitive proof exists that following a gluten-
free diet will improve any of these conditions; instead, you need to rely on 
other, effective therapies.

132
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Understanding What “Associated” Means
Although you are at increased risk compared to someone without celiac dis-
ease of developing certain health problems associated with celiac disease, the 
odds remain darned good that you will never get any of these conditions. (Just 
like buying two lottery tickets instead of one may double your “risk” of win-
ning the big prize, but your likelihood of winning still remains small. Rats!)
Distinguishing between those things in life that are directly related and those 
that are simply associated can be a challenge. Here are examples to help clar-
ify the distinction. If you use a hammer and you hit your thumb, the action 
and outcome are directly related. The hammer directly caused your thumb 
injury (and the oh-so-delicate words that you quietly murmured). On the 
other hand (so to speak), if you have red hair and skin freckles, your red hair 
did not cause you to have skin freckles; the two traits are simply associated.
We strongly suspect that as more becomes known about celiac disease, many 
of the ailments now said to be linked to celiac disease (as we discuss in this 
chapter) will turn out to be present either with no greater frequency than if 
you didn’t have celiac disease, or alternatively, will be found to be victims of 
“guilt by association” and have no causal relationship.
Skin Deep: Dermatological Conditions
As anatomy professors love to tell first year med students, the skin is a per-
son’s largest organ. Sheila, a gastroenterologist, and Ian, an internist, admit 
to occasional envy of our dermatologist (“skin doctor”) colleagues. While we 
often have to poke and prod, x-ray and ultrasound, endoscope and colono-
scope, to find out what’s causing our patients’ ailments, the fortunate derma-
tologist — occasional skin biopsies aside — just has to look.
There are several skin ailments that are associated with celiac disease. We 
explore these conditions in this section.
 
If you have not been diagnosed with celiac disease and you have a skin rash 
that you think may indicate you have celiac disease, we recommend that 
before you start yourself on a gluten-free diet in the hope this will help your 
skin condition, you first speak to your doctor. As we discuss in Chapter 3, if 
you are on a gluten-free diet, figuring out whether you do or don’t have celiac 
disease is more difficult.

133
 Chapter 8: Conditions Associated with Celiac Disease
Dermatitis herpetiformis
 
Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), literally translated, means “skin inflammation 
resembling herpes.” Despite the name, DH is not caused by the herpes virus 
and, apart from some similarities in the way the rash looks, has no other rela-
tionship to herpes.
Between 15 and 25 percent of people with celiac disease either have or at 
some point develop dermatitis herpetiformis. Conversely, virtually everyone 
with dermatitis herpetiformis has, if looked for sufficiently thoroughly, some 
evidence of celiac disease. As you may expect, therefore, those people who 
are genetically at risk of celiac disease are the same people at risk of DH. 
(We look at the genetics of celiac disease in Chapter 2.) Although dermatitis 
herpetiformis can be found at any age, you are most likely to first develop it if 
you are between the ages of 15 and 40.
Celiac disease and DH share so much in common that DH is sometimes 
referred to as “celiac disease of the skin.” Nonetheless, even if a person has 
both conditions, their severity is not necessarily similar. You can have severe 
GI symptoms from celiac disease but only mild skin problems from DH, or 
you can have very mild (or even nonexistent) GI symptoms from celiac dis-
ease and have severe skin issues from DH.
 
Today, every doctor has at least some familiarity with celiac disease, but 
many physicians are not familiar with (and may have never even heard of) 
dermatitis herpetiformis. For this reason, if you have celiac disease and you 
also have a skin rash — especially if it’s one that has gone undiagnosed or per-
sists despite treatment — there’s no harm in asking your doctor (even your 
dermatologist) whether you might have DH.
Knowing the features of dermatitis herpetiformis
DH is a form of skin rash. Although there can be many exceptions, DH gener-
ally has the following features:
 
✓ The areas most likely to be affected are the elbows, knees, and buttocks 
(less often, the shoulders, scalp, face, and back). The oral or genital areas 
are only occasionally involved. DH doesn’t affect the palms or soles.
 
✓ It consists of groupings of small, flesh colored-to-pink, blister-like sores 
that are raised above the surface of the skin.
 
✓ The rash is intensely itchy. Intense as in “I’m scratching so hard I’m wor-
ried I’m going to peel my skin right down to the bone.” Before the itching 
develops, the small blisters or bumps may have a burning feeling.

134
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Because the itch is so intense, and because the affected person understand-
ably tends to scratch so vigorously, the typical appearance of DH (as we 
describe in the preceding list) can become obscured by the effects of the 
scratching itself (including the absence of blisters if they’ve been scratched 
off before being seen by the doctor). This is one of the reasons that doctors — 
even dermatologists — may (mis)diagnose the rash as being something else 
altogether, like eczema, mosquito bites, allergies, or even psoriasis.
Diagnosing dermatitis herpetiformis
Like pretty well any other disease, the first step in diagnosing DH is having a 
doctor who considers the possibility (or a patient who brings the possibility 
to the doctor’s attention). In determining whether you have DH, your doctor 
will do these key things:
 
✓ Talk to you. The doctor needs to determine when your rash started, 
what it feels like, whether it’s getting better or worse, and so on. Also, if 
DH is suspected, your doctor will want to know whether you have celiac 
disease or symptoms suggesting that you might (see Chapter 6).
 
✓ Examine you. Your doctor will need to carefully inspect your skin, look-
ing particularly for what the skin rash looks like and where on your body 
the rash is located.
 
✓ Send you for blood tests. The most important of these is, as with celiac 
disease, to look for the presence of tissue transglutaminase antibody 
(see Chapter 3). This antibody is present in the majority of people with 
DH. Because a skin biopsy, as we mention in the next bullet, is the only 
definitive way to diagnose DH, a dermatologist may elect to forego this 
or other blood tests in lieu of proceeding directly with a biopsy.
 
✓ Have a skin biopsy performed. The only way that DH can be definitively 
diagnosed is with a skin biopsy. Everything else we mention in the pre-
ceding bullets is complementary to this. These are the most important 
features of having a skin biopsy:
 
• A skin biopsy is a fast and safe outpatient procedure.
 
• In order to get a high quality specimen, the biopsy needs to be 
done by a doctor who is skilled at performing the procedure.
 
• The biopsy should, ideally, be taken from a newly developed blis-
ter because, once it’s scratched and/or sufficiently healed, the 
characteristic findings may no longer be present.
 
• The biopsy specimen is sent by the dermatologist to the labora-
tory where it is analyzed by a pathologist. The pathologist looks at 
the pattern of cells in the biopsy sample and also looks specifically 
for a substance unique to DH called granular IgA antibodies which, 
if present, clinch the diagnosis.

135
 Chapter 8: Conditions Associated with Celiac Disease
 
No test is perfect. Therefore, if you have other features of dermatitis herpeti-
formis, yet your skin biopsy does not confirm this, you should either have the 
biopsy repeated or, alternatively, your doctor should have the specimen 
reviewed by another pathologist.
Understanding why celiac disease is associated 
with dermatitis herpetiformis
At first blush (well, maybe second and third blush, too) it may seem peculiar 
that a condition — celiac disease — that affects the intestine is associated 
with a condition — DH — that affects the skin. The quick and dirty explana-
tion is that both conditions are caused by the same antibodies in response 
to the same trigger (gluten). The more difficult part here is to figure out why 
these antibodies target such different parts of the body. Most likely this is 
because both the skin and the bowel contain certain proteins (called anti-
gens) that are similar enough that the antibodies cannot tell them apart and 
target them regardless of their location. (Just like the old expression: Give 
someone a hammer and suddenly, everything looks like a nail.) If this sounds 
straightforward enough, we’re doing you a disservice! Because why, then, 
do only a fairly small percentage of people with celiac disease get DH? The 
answer is we simply don’t know.
How dermatitis herpetiformis is treated
Although much is unknown about DH, what is, however, abundantly clear is 
how to make it better. Don’t consume gluten. Period. That much is simple. 
What is far less simple is trying to predict how long it will take from the time 
that you eliminate gluten until your skin rash goes away. Generally speaking:
 
✓ Most people notice some initial improvement within a few weeks of 
adopting a gluten-free diet and have almost complete resolution of their 
DH within a few months.
 
✓ The longer and more severe the DH, the longer it takes to start to 
improve and, ultimately, resolve. In the most severe cases, it can take 
well over a year before things are entirely back to normal.
If your symptoms are bothersome enough, while you await the benefits of 
your gluten-free diet to take hold, there are medications you can take to make 
you feel better, faster. We look at these next.
 
Although medications are helpful in the treatment of DH, they do not treat the 
underlying immune problem that causes this disease. The only therapy that 
targets the underlying problem is the elimination of gluten from your diet. 
When you use these medicines, you must, therefore, continue to follow your 
gluten-free diet.

136
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Dapsone
Dapsone is an oral medication. It reduces the inflammation present in the 
skin sores and, as a result, helps improve the rash and ease the itch of DH.
Although generally well-tolerated, dapsone can have serious side effects, 
such as anemia, decreased white blood cell production (which increases the 
risk of infection), kidney damage, and nerve damage. For these reasons, your 
doctor needs to use the lowest effective dose of dapsone for the shortest 
possible period of time. Nonetheless, some people — particularly those with 
severe DH — can take a very long time to sufficiently respond to a gluten-
free diet, and therefore may need to take the medicine for as long as 6 to 12 
months before the dose can be reduced. The occasional person simply has 
such refractory DH that they need to stay on dapsone indefinitely (though, 
again, this should be in the lowest possible dose).
Topical medications
Two types of topical medication can be tried to treat DH (but because they 
aren’t typically helpful, they are not routinely used):
 
✓ Corticosteroid-containing creams work by reducing the amount of inflam-
mation in the affected skin. (Corticosteroids are potent anti-inflammatory 
medications.)
 
✓ Immune-modulating creams (such as drugs called tacrolimus and pimecro-
limus) modulate (hence the name for this drug class) part of the immune 
system and, by doing so, help to suppress the immune reaction in the 
affected skin. As a result, inflammation is reduced.
Vitiligo
Vitiligo is a chronic condition in which a person loses pigment from various 
areas of the skin, and as a result, the affected areas turn white. The hands, 
abdomen, chest, and sometimes face can be involved. In extreme cases, virtu-
ally the entire body can turn white. Although vitiligo is not a threat to one’s 
physical health, the cosmetic appearance, depending on the extent and on 
one’s natural skin color, may be bothersome.
Although the cause of vitiligo is not fully sorted out, it is thought likely to be 
an autoimmune disease, that is, a condition in which the body makes anti-
bodies to its own tissues. Multiple autoimmune diseases tend to occur in the 
same person; this likely explains why people with celiac disease (which is, in 
itself an autoimmune condition) are more prone to vitiligo.
There’s no cure for vitiligo, and it seldom requires treatment beyond sun-
screens, makeup, or skin stains; however, ultraviolet light or prescription 
drug therapy (such as with corticosteroids) is sometimes used.

137
 Chapter 8: Conditions Associated with Celiac Disease
Psoriasis
Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition in which areas of the body (most com-
monly the scalp, elbows, knees, and back, though other areas can also be 
affected) become red and scaly. These sores are called plaques.
Psoriasis, like celiac disease, is an autoimmune condition, and it is likely for 
this reason that the two conditions may co-exist. (This association is, how-
ever, controversial and many experts believe that it is just statistical chance 
that psoriasis and celiac disease — neither being rare disorders — both 
develop in certain individuals.)
If your psoriasis is mild, the only treatment typically required is a topical 
therapy such as applying petroleum jelly (one type being Vaseline), tar, or 
corticosteroids. (There are a great many different types of topical corticoste-
roid medication; your family physician or dermatologist will recommend the 
one he or she feels will work best for you.) Other, more powerful therapies are 
reserved for particularly severe cases. Although it is not as yet proven, most 
experts feel that a gluten-free diet seldom, if ever, helps control psoriasis.
Eczema
Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic skin condition, often 
onsetting in childhood, characterized by itchy, thickened skin most com-
monly affecting creased areas of the body, such as the neck, the front of the 
elbows, and the backs of the knees. Affected somewhat less often are the 
face, wrists, and forearms. Other areas of the body can also be involved.
Eczema is a very common condition in the general population and, like many 
other frequently occurring conditions, a proven link with celiac disease has 
not been established, and its presence may be purely coincidental.
In terms of celiac disease, the most important thing to know about eczema is 
that dermatitis herpetiformis (see “Knowing the features of dermatitis her-
petiformis”) can be misdiagnosed as being eczema.
 
If you have celiac disease and you are diagnosed with eczema, the odds are 
good that you have this condition. Nonetheless, there is no harm (and could 
be much good) in your mentioning to your doctor that you have celiac disease 
and asking if, therefore, the possibility exists that your skin rash actually rep-
resents dermatitis herpetiformis.

138
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Feeling Down in the Dumps: Depression
Feeling sad is a normal part of life. Sadness is a temporary feeling typically 
related to an identifiable and specific cause, be it something as relatively 
minor as having an argument with a friend or as devastating as the loss of 
a loved one. Depression, on the other hand is a severe, overwhelming, and 
persisting feeling of despair often not clearly related to a triggering event. 
Depressed people often sleep poorly, feel tired, have a decreased appetite 
and weight loss and, in some cases, may be suicidal.
Although the exact reasons that people with celiac disease are at increased 
risk of depression are not known, several factors may account for at least 
part of the explanation:
 
✓ Prior to being diagnosed with celiac disease, you may have felt unwell 
for a long time. Indeed, you may have suffered for years from indiges-
tion, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, fatigue, and other symptoms before 
their cause was discovered. Feeling chronically ill can understandably 
take a heavy emotional toll.
 
✓ Before your celiac disease was diagnosed you may have attributed — or 
your family, friends, or doctor may have attributed — your gastrointesti-
nal or other symptoms to emotional causes such as stress. Perhaps you 
came to “beat yourself up” over having symptoms which were inaccu-
rately thought to be due to emotional “weakness” (whatever that is!).
 
✓ After being diagnosed with celiac disease and having started on a gluten-
free diet, you may have concluded this treatment was overly restric-
tive and interfered unduly with your ability to share in the pleasures of 
family celebrations, parties, and other events where food is often front 
and center.
 
✓ Celiac disease causes decreased absorption of certain nutrients. One 
theory holds that this may lead to decreased levels of the brain’s chemi-
cal messengers (neurotransmitters) and that this chemical imbalance is a 
factor in causing depression.
 
✓ The inflammation in the body that results from celiac disease may, in 
itself, affect one’s mood and thinking.
 
✓ Celiac disease is more common among people that share certain genes 
(like family members). This is also true of depression. It could be, there-
fore, that the genes that put someone at risk for celiac disease share 
some link to the genes that put someone at risk for depression, so if you 
have the one condition, you may be at increased risk for the other.
 
If you are suffering from depression, it is essential that you seek help. Although 
your family and friends may offer invaluable support, you should let your 
doctor know how you are feeling so that they can provide you with — or 
arrange for — the medical care you require.

139
 Chapter 8: Conditions Associated with Celiac Disease
Getting a Head Start: Neurological 
Manifestations
As with other ailments we discuss in this chapter, the link between celiac dis-
ease and certain neurological disorders is unclear and may simply reflect the 
coincidental occurrence of relatively common disorders. Having said that, 
there are some neurological conditions which possibly do occur more com-
monly if you have celiac disease. We discuss these in this section. 
Migraine headache
Migraine headaches are typically felt as throbbing, intense, headaches that 
occur on one side of the head or the other and can range in severity from 
the mild to the disabling. The headache is often accompanied by nausea and 
What causes celiac disease 
neurological problems?
In some circumstances, the connection 
between neurological problems and celiac 
disease is easy to find; for example, the person 
with such severe malabsorption that he or she 
develops a very low calcium level (hypocalce-
mia) and as a result has a seizure.
In other cases, the link is less clear, but can 
be inferred. For example, some infants with 
untreated celiac disease, although having 
normal routine blood tests, nonetheless are 
slow to mentally develop (something called 
developmental delay) but improve nicely once 
they are treated with a gluten-free diet. This 
outcome suggests they were suffering from 
a deficiency of nutrients but of such a small 
(though significant) magnitude that blood tests 
were unable to detect it.
Another mechanism has also been described. 
It could be that neurological problems in some 
people with celiac disease develop not from 
malabsorption, but from a defect in the immune 
system itself. Celiac disease is an autoimmune 
disorder (see Chapter 2) leading to inflammation 
in the lining of the intestine (and, in the case 
of dermatitis herpetiformis, in the skin). Cases 
have been described where people with celiac 
disease and brain malfunction had evidence 
of autoimmune damage in the brain itself. 
Whether this was the cause of their neurologi-
cal problems or was coincidental is unknown.
Antibodies to gliadin (AGA) have been sus-
pected as one cause of neurological problems 
in celiac disease, but the evidence for this is 
limited. It has also been proposed that gliadin 
itself is in some way toxic to the nervous system 
and that a leaky gut may also be a factor. Again, 
there is very little scientific information to sup-
port such claims. More recently, antibodies 
to another form of transglutaminase that is 
found in nervous tissue known as neuronal TG 
or TG6 have been detected, and it is possible 
that these may be involved in the neurological 
problems associated with celiac disease. More 
research is needed in this area.

140
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
vomiting. Migraine headaches are often foreshadowed by a warning (aura) 
symptom (or symptoms) such as seeing flashing lights or geometric patterns. 
Some people experience the aura without the headache.
If your migraines are infrequent, the usual treatment strategy is to take a 
serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonist medicine at the first hint you are getting 
a migraine. If your migraines are more frequent, then taking a preventative 
medicine (such as a drug — like propranolol — from the beta blocker family) 
is often advised.
Peripheral neuropathy
 
The peripheral nervous system is that collection of nerves that carries mes-
sages between the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and your 
organs such as the muscles and skin. So, for example, if you move your fingers 
to turn this page (no, not yet!), it is your peripheral nervous system that is 
receiving the instructions from your central nervous system and “telling” the 
muscles in your hand and fingers what to do. Conversely, if you turn this page 
and get a paper cut (sorry), it is your peripheral nervous system that carries 
the pain message from your finger to your central nervous system.
Peripheral neuropathy is the condition wherein nerves within the peripheral 
nervous system are damaged. Depending on which part of the peripheral 
nervous system is damaged, symptoms can vary from numbness, burning, or 
other types of pain in the fingers or toes, to weak muscles.
In most cases, a direct connection between celiac disease and peripheral 
neuropathy is not found and, when a person has both conditions, the connec-
tion is likely to be coincidental. An exception to this rule, however, is vitamin 
B12 deficiency. As we discuss in Chapter 7, vitamin B12 is an important nutri-
ent to keep nerves healthy. If, as occasionally happens, celiac disease dam-
ages the end part of the small intestine (the terminal ileum) — where vitamin 
B12 is absorbed into the body — you will be at risk of vitamin B12 deficiency 
and, as a result, peripheral neuropathy.
 
If you have symptoms like those we have just described, ask your doctor to 
check your vitamin B12 level. This is done on a blood sample.
Ataxia
 
Ataxia is the medical term for imbalance and incoordination. It occurs when 
there is damage to the parts of the nervous system that control balance, posi-
tion, and movement.

141
 Chapter 8: Conditions Associated with Celiac Disease
An (extreme) example of ataxia is the “I can barely walk on my own two feet” 
gait of the bar patron that has had one too many. Many people, however, 
have much more subtle degrees of ataxia. Of all the various neurological 
problems that seem linked to celiac disease, ataxia is the one that occurs 
most commonly, being present, to some degree, in up to 10 to 15 percent of 
people with celiac disease. Nonetheless, it remains to be proven whether 
celiac disease actually causes ataxia and, if so, how it does this.
The one exception is the established link between vitamin B12 deficiency — see 
the immediately preceding section, “Peripheral neuropathy” — and ataxia 
that can result from this deficiency.
 
If you have ataxia, ask your doctor to check the vitamin B12 level in your 
blood.
Epilepsy (seizures)
Epilepsy is a condition in which episodes of abnormal electrical discharge 
occur in the brain leading, depending on the area involved, to abnormal 
movements or behaviors. There are a variety of types of epilepsy, the one 
most familiar to people being grand mal seizures in which an affected individ-
ual suddenly and with little or no warning loses consciousness, has thrashing 
movements of their arms and legs, incontinence, and then a period of confu-
sion lasting up to a few hours before returning to normal.
Some evidence exists that epilepsy is more common in people with celiac 
disease, but the relationship (if any) — with one exception we mention in a 
moment — is far from clear, and the great majority of people with celiac dis-
ease never experience seizures.
Here is the one exception: Celiac disease can cause malabsorption of calcium 
and magnesium leading to deficiency of these minerals; if sufficiently severe, 
you can have a seizure. Fortunately, this degree of calcium and magnesium 
deficiency seldom happens. Doctors routinely check calcium and magnesium 
levels (on a blood test) in people with unexplained seizures.
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity 
Disorder (ADHD)
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a condition in which the 
affected person has difficulty paying attention, tends to be overly active, and 
often acts impulsively. ADHD is typically diagnosed in childhood; however, 
increasing numbers of adults are also being diagnosed. The cause (or causes) 
of ADHD is not known, although numerous theories abound, including the 
possibility that ADHD is, in some way, connected to celiac disease.

142
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
At present, there is very limited evidence for a connection between ADHD and 
celiac disease. Given the lack of good scientific evidence linking celiac disease 
and ADHD and given the many challenges of following a gluten-free diet (espe-
cially, perhaps, in a child with ADHD), treating ADHD with a gluten-free diet is 
not advised. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence of a link between the two 
ailments to warrant routinely screening people with ADHD for celiac disease. 
(It is, however, certainly understandable that parents of a child with ADHD and 
the child’s physician, often out of desperation, choose to test a given child with 
ADHD for celiac disease.) Of course, if a person with ADHD has other features 
(as we discuss throughout this book) suggesting he or she may have celiac dis-
ease, then naturally the appropriate tests should be performed.
Autism
Autism is a condition in which the affected person has difficulties communi-
cating and interacting socially.
The link, if any, between autism and celiac disease is unclear. Some earlier 
scientific studies had suggested that children with autism were more likely to 
have celiac disease, but more recent evidence does not support there being 
an association. Currently, it is not recommended that children with autism 
be routinely screened for celiac disease, nor is it advised that children with 
autism be placed on a gluten-free diet on speculation that it will be of benefit. 
(Nonetheless, we recognize that parents, out of frustration and desperation, 
and also the lack of other treatments, may elect to try their autistic child on 
a gluten-free diet in spite of a lack of scientific evidence that such dietary 
therapy is of benefit.)
Trouble below the surface: Hidden 
neurological problems
Although the great majority of people (of any 
age) with celiac disease do not have obvious 
neurological problems, if sophisticated medi-
cal tests are done on children with celiac dis-
ease, up to 20 percent of them will have some 
evidence of neurological dysfunction. Problems 
identified range from very mild nerve damage in 
the limbs (so mild, the child doesn’t have symp-
toms) to a small brain (something called cortical 
atrophy). Also, some adults with celiac disease 
have been found to have decreased blood flow 
to part of the brain.
Whereas for people who have both celiac dis-
ease and overt neurological disease (such as 
those conditions we discuss in this chapter) 
the connection between the ailments is tenu-
ous and treating celiac disease typically has 
no impact on the neurological condition, some 
scientific evidence suggests people with celiac 
disease and subclinical (that is, not having obvi-
ous symptoms or physical examination abnor-
malities) neurological dysfunction do, in fact, 
have neurological improvement after following 
a gluten-free diet.

Hormonal Health: Endocrine Disorders 
and Celiac Disease
The endocrine system refers to the body’s complex network of glands that 
produce (“secrete”) hormones. Hormones control an array of bodily func-
tions including growth, metabolism, and sexual and reproductive function to 
name but a few.
As you discover in Chapter 2, celiac disease is an autoimmune disease. So, 
too, are a variety of endocrine disorders. If you have one autoimmune dis-
ease, you are at increased risk of having others. Thus, if you have celiac dis-
ease, you are more likely to have some types of endocrine disease. We look 
at these types in this section.
Type 1 diabetes
Diabetes mellitus (virtually always abbreviated simply as “diabetes”) is a dis-
ease in which one has elevated blood glucose (blood sugar) levels due to insuf-
ficient insulin or ineffective insulin or both. (Another, entirely unrelated form 
of diabetes is called diabetes insipidus; the only thing it has in common with 
diabetes mellitus is a tendency to pass lots of urine; our discussion here per-
tains only to diabetes mellitus.) There are two main types of diabetes mellitus:
 
✓ Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that typically first onsets in 
adolescents, teens, or young adults, and always requires insulin therapy.
 
✓ Type 2 diabetes is not autoimmune, typically develops in middle-aged 
or older individuals, and can often be managed — especially in its first 
few years — without insulin.
If you have type 1 diabetes, you have about a 5 percent lifetime risk of being 
found to also have celiac disease (compared to the general population risk of 
about 1 percent).
Exploring how celiac disease affects diabetes
People with type 1 diabetes need to inject themselves with insulin immediately 
before they eat in an amount proportionate to the amount of carbohydrate 
they are about to ingest. (Carbohydrates make blood glucose go up; insulin 
helps bring it down or helps prevent the blood glucose from going up in the 
first place.) This treatment strategy (called carbohydrate counting or carb 
counting for short) generally works very well but is dependent on the ingested 
carbohydrates being predictably absorbed into the body. Undiagnosed or 
insufficiently treated celiac disease (with its attendant affect on carbohydrate — 
and other nutrient — absorption into the body) — confounds this predict-
ability and leads to erratic blood glucose levels. Conversely, there is good — 

144
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
though not foolproof — evidence that once the celiac disease is controlled, 
blood glucose control also improves. See the sidebar, “Why blood glucose 
control is erratic if you have type 1 diabetes and untreated celiac disease,” 
for more on this topic.
 
Anne was a 22-year-old patient of Ian’s with type 1 diabetes. Her blood glu-
cose control had been typically excellent over the years, but for the past 6 
months her control had become increasingly erratic to the point that Anne 
felt she was on a perpetual roller coaster. She couldn’t fathom why this had 
happened. She felt otherwise completely well, her diet hadn’t changed, her 
exercise pattern had remained consistent, and her insulin therapy hadn’t 
altered. Further investigations were undertaken including blood tests and, 
subsequently, a small intestinal biopsy (see Chapter 3). The results came back 
showing that Anne had celiac disease. When Anne heard the news, she was 
initially (understandably) upset, but when she started a gluten-free diet and 
found her blood glucose control to come back in line, she was both pleased 
and relieved.
 
If you have type 1 diabetes and your blood glucose control is erratic for no 
clear reason, discuss with your diabetes specialist whether or not you should 
be tested for celiac disease.
Screening for celiac disease if you have type 1 diabetes
As we discuss in Chapter 4, screening for a disease means testing for it in the 
absence of any evidence that it is present. A common example of screening is 
having your blood pressure checked even when no suspicion exists that it’s 
high; this is done by doctors as part of a routine checkup.
Because your risk of having celiac disease is much greater if you have type 1 
diabetes, some experts advocate that all people (especially children) with 
type 1 diabetes be tested for celiac disease. Other experts advise that, 
because it is not proven that treating entirely asymptomatic people with 
celiac disease improves their long-term health, such testing should only be 
done on people — including those with type 1 diabetes — who are having 
symptoms or other evidence (such as erratic blood glucose levels) that they 
may have celiac disease.
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) has published recommendations 
regarding screening for celiac disease in children and adolescents with type 1 
diabetes. The ADA recommends that they be screened for celiac disease 
soon after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes has been made and, if celiac dis-
ease isn’t found, that screening be redone if the child or adolescent:
 
✓ Fails to grow properly
 
✓ Fails to gain weight properly or loses weight
 
✓ Has gastrointestinal symptoms

145
 Chapter 8: Conditions Associated with Celiac Disease
The ADA also suggests that doctors consider periodically rescreening chil-
dren and adolescents even if they are asymptomatic (that is, not having any 
symptoms to suggest they have celiac disease).
Thyroid disease
The thyroid gland is a small organ located low down in the neck in front of 
and beside the windpipe (the trachea). The thyroid makes thyroid hormone 
which is involved with controlling and regulating many different processes 
within the body. Indeed, if it moves (think bowels), squeezes (heart), bleeds 
(uterus), pulls (muscles), grows (nails), or pretty much performs any other 
bodily function, then the thyroid typically plays at least some role.
The thyroid gland is commonly affected by autoimmune disease and, as mul-
tiple autoimmune diseases tend to occur in the same individual, if you have 
celiac disease (which is an autoimmune condition) you are at increased risk 
of having one of these conditions. Approximately 5 percent of people with 
celiac disease have one of the two thyroid conditions we discuss in this 
section.
 
If, after the reading this section, you’re looking for more information on thy-
roid disease, have a look at the excellent Web site www.mythyroid.com.
Why blood glucose control is erratic if you have 
diabetes and untreated celiac disease
When a person with no health problems ingests 
carbohydrates (some examples being bread, 
potatoes, grains, cereals, rice, and some dairy 
products like milk and yogurt), the carbohy-
drates are quickly absorbed into the body and 
converted to a sugar molecule called glucose. 
The pancreas recognizes that additional glu-
cose has entered the blood stream and instantly 
releases precise quantities of a hormone called 
insulin which allows the glucose to move, in 
just the right amounts, from the blood into the 
body’s cells.
A person with diabetes who is being treated 
with a quick-acting form of insulin taken with 
meals does so in a dose designed to match 
the expected amount of carbohydrate about to 
be absorbed into the body. If you have active 
celiac disease, however, malabsorption may 
cause only a portion of the ingested carbohy-
drate to be absorbed. As a result, a mismatch 
occurs, with too much insulin having been given 
for the amount of glucose present in the blood. 
As a result, low blood glucose (hypoglycemia) 
occurs. Fortunately, once your celiac disease 
is discovered and treated, your bowel will heal 
and the carbohydrates you ingest will once 
again be consistently and predictably absorbed 
with, in most cases, an attendant return of more 
predictable insulin requirements.

146

Graves disease
Graves disease — so called because it was first described by Dr. Robert 
Graves, not because it is a grave disease — is an autoimmune condition in 
which antibodies attack the thyroid and cause it to over-function (a condition 
called hyperthyroidism).
These are some common symptoms of hyperthyroidism:
 
✓ Excess sweating
 
✓ Fatigue
 
✓ Feeling overly hot
 
✓ Frequent bowel movements (sometimes to the point of having diarrhea)
 
✓ Palpitations
 
✓ Thyroid swelling (goiter)
 
✓ Tremor
 
✓ Weight loss
Looking at the preceding list, you can see that some of the symptoms of 
hyperthyroidism are also symptoms of active celiac disease. Specifically, 
both conditions can cause frequent stools, weight loss, and fatigue. For this 
reason, if you have celiac disease and you develop these symptoms you may 
understandably be inclined to attribute them to your bowel disease and 
question whether you’ve inadvertently been ingesting gluten. This makes per-
fect sense, but if the real problem is that you’ve developed hyperthyroidism, 
this will be overlooked. Therefore, if you develop these symptoms, mention 
them to your physician so that you can be assessed and, if indicated, tested 
for hyperthyroidism.
The diagnosis of hyperthyroidism is usually easily confirmed by measuring 
your thyroid hormone levels on a blood test and by performing a nuclear 
medicine test called a thyroid scan. Treatment is with either a drink of 
radioactive iodine (which generally cures the hyperthyroidism within a few 
months) or, used less often, oral medications (which control the problem but 
are unlikely to cure it).
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition in which antibodies attack the 
thyroid and, often, cause it to under-function; a condition called hypothyroidism.
These are some common symptoms of hypothyroidism:
 
✓ Brittle hair
 
✓ Constipation

147
 Chapter 8: Conditions Associated with Celiac Disease
 
✓ Dry skin
 
✓ Fatigue
 
✓ Thyroid swelling (goiter)
 
✓ Weight gain
 
If you develop these symptoms, be sure to see your doctor so that they can 
check to see whether you may have hypothyroidism.
The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is easily made by measuring your thyroid 
hormone levels on a blood test. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is similarly easily 
diagnosed by finding certain thyroid antibodies on a blood test.
Hypothyroidism is treated with oral thyroid hormone supplements. If you’re 
on the right dose of thyroid hormone (this is readily determined by measuring 
your thyroid hormone levels on a blood test), your symptoms of hypothyroid-
ism will all gradually resolve. If, however, they persist despite normal thyroid 
hormone levels, then your doctor will need to look for a non-thyroid cause.
Adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease)
Adrenal insufficiency (typically referred to as Addison’s disease though tech-
nically Addison’s disease is but one form of adrenal insufficiency) is a condi-
tion in which the adrenal glands (small, paired organs which are located just 
above the kidneys) become damaged — typically as part of an autoimmune 
process — and as a result become unable to make sufficient quantities of cer-
tain types of hormones, called corticosteroids.
Two types of corticosteroids are available and, depending on which type is 
lacking, different symptoms result:
 
✓ Glucocorticoid deficiency leads to
 
• Weight loss
 
• Fatigue
 
• Nausea
 
• Abdominal pain
 
• Malaise (meaning you feel generally poorly).
 
✓ Mineralocorticoid deficiency leads to
 
• Increased thirst
 
• Craving for salty foods
 
• Dehydration

148
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
 
• Low blood pressure. (Low blood pressure has a range of severity. 
If it’s mild, it may only cause lightheadedness or faintness, espe-
cially when you first stand up. Severe low blood pressure, how-
ever, can be life-threatening.)
Because both celiac disease and the most common form of adrenal insuf-
ficiency are autoimmune diseases, and because having one such condition 
increases the risk of having another, if you have celiac disease you are at 
increased — though still small — risk of developing Addison’s disease.
If you think of the symptoms you had prior to your celiac disease having 
been discovered and treated, it’s quite possible you recall having had some 
of the same symptoms — such as weight loss, fatigue, nausea, abdominal 
pain, and malaise — we mention in the preceding list. That doesn’t mean you 
have Addison’s disease; indeed, if your symptoms went away once you got 
going on your gluten-free diet and you’ve been fine since, it is highly unlikely 
you have Addison’s disease. Nonetheless, you are at increased risk of devel-
oping Addison’s disease, so it is important that, should you develop the 
symptoms we mention in the previous list — especially if they are severe or 
persisting — that you seek medical attention to have the cause determined.
 
The symptoms of Addison’s disease can be quite nonspecific. For this reason, 
doctors typically (and understandably) look for more common causes to 
explain them. This often leads to a delay in the diagnosis with the correct 
cause not being determined until someone is quite ill.
The diagnosis of Addison’s disease is confirmed by blood tests showing 
decreased glucocorticoid levels (specifically, cortisol), and, sometimes, imbal-
ance of sodium and potassium levels. Treatment consists of taking (oral) 
supplements of the missing hormones.
Now that you are armed with the knowledge we’ve shared in this section, 
you can help avoid this happening to you if you have celiac disease by seek-
ing medical attention when necessary and, even better, mentioning to your 
doctor the possible diagnosis of Addison’s disease when you have (unex-
plained) symptoms like we describe in this section. You may turn out to have 
been very wise to have done so; indeed, you could save your own life!
Disjointed: Rheumatologic Disorders
Rheumatologic disorders are those ailments affecting the musculoskeletal 
system (the muscles, joints, cartilage, and other parts of our anatomy respon-
sible for — and, for pop music fans, doing the — locomotion). Because many 
rheumatologic diseases are caused by immune problems, and because the 
immune system is directly involved in how the entire body functions, many 
rheumatologic diseases also affect the internal organs.

149
 Chapter 8: Conditions Associated with Celiac Disease
Connective tissue disorders
Connective tissue disorders comprise a wide range of diseases in which con-
nective tissues (such as tendons, ligaments, and cartilage) become inflamed 
and damaged. Connective tissue diseases are typically considered under the 
umbrella of “arthritis” ailments; however, joint pains, per se, are not neces-
sarily prominent. Because connective tissue diseases are typically due to an 
autoimmune process and because autoimmune conditions tend to occur in 
groups, if you have celiac disease (which is an autoimmune disease), you are 
at increased risk of also having certain types of connective tissue disease. We 
discuss these conditions in the following sections.
Sjogren’s syndrome
Sjogren’s syndrome is an autoimmune condition in which there is a reduced 
ability to produce certain bodily fluids, especially saliva and tears. Although 
this may, at first blush, seem to be simply an inconvenience, in reality, it can 
cause substantial hardship as we discover in this section. We first look at the 
various ways in which Sjogren’s syndrome can affect someone and, following 
that, we look at helpful ways to reduce symptoms.
 
Like many other of the conditions we discuss in this chapter, if you have 
celiac disease you are at increased risk of Sjogren’s syndrome, but your over-
all risk of acquiring this is still low. Nonetheless, it’s important to know about 
this condition because, armed with this awareness, you can keep an eye out 
for the symptoms we discuss here and seek timely medical attention should 
they develop.
Insufficient ability to make saliva
Like many things in life — and with apologies to songstress Joni Mitchell and 
“Big Yellow Taxi” (“Don’t it always seem to go . . .”) — the ability to make 
saliva is one of those things people don’t think about much, if at all, until its 
gone. And when its gone, it can cause big problems indeed, including:
 
✓ Difficulty chewing food. (Imagine chewing a cracker with no saliva in 
your mouth.)
 
✓ Difficulty swallowing. (Imagine now swallowing that same cracker 
without any moisture in your mouth.) If chewing and swallowing is suffi-
ciently severe, you may find eating so onerous that you actually start to 
eat less and, as a result, lose weight.
 
✓ Increased risk of oral diseases, such as the following:
 
• Dental cavities (caries). This point is a surprise to most people. 
As it turns out, saliva is an essential element in protecting your 
teeth from damage.
 
• Gum disease. Inflammation and infection can occur leading to loss 
of teeth.

150
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
 
• Yeast infections within the mouth (candidiasis). With this prob-
lem, you may find your mouth feels uncomfortable, burns or even 
feels painful. If you look in the mirror and stick out your tongue, 
it can look redder than normal or, conversely, can have white 
patches.
Other oral problems include difficulty speaking for long periods of time and 
altered food taste.
Insufficient ability to make tears
Many people think of tears as being primarily related to shows of emotion. 
And indeed, this is true. Tears, however, are also a key element of the eyes’ 
defense shield protecting these vital structures from being damaged. If you 
don’t make sufficient tears, you are prone to
 
✓ Eye irritation. Eyes have a constant sensation of grittiness as if some 
sand got in your eye and, try as you might, you can’t get rid of it. This 
symptom is usually worse as the day progresses. Eye irritation due to 
Sjogren’s syndrome comes on gradually over years.
 
✓ Ulceration of the cornea. The cornea is the clear outermost part of 
the eye through which light first passes as it first enters your eye. If 
your cornea becomes ulcerated, it can lead to sight-threatening 
complications.
Surprisingly, even people with profoundly dry eyes typically retain the ability 
to cry.
Insufficient ability to make vaginal secretions
As the glands responsible for providing moisture to the vagina are frequently 
involved, women with Sjogren’s syndrome are prone to vaginal dryness. 
Vaginal dryness is a common cause of painful sexual intercourse (dyspareunia).
Insufficient ability to make upper airways secretions
The upper airways are those parts of the respiratory system well above the 
lungs, such as the nose and sinuses. When Sjogren’s syndrome affects these 
parts of one’s anatomy, a dry cough can develop.
Treating Sjogren’s syndrome
A mainstay of treating Sjogren’s syndrome is to maintain moisture in the vari-
ous parts of the body that have become dry. Good oral hygiene is also imper-
ative. There are very many therapies available to treat Sjogren’s syndrome 
including the use of mediations. We recommend you speak to your health 
care provider (typically this condition is looked after by a rheumatologist, an 
arthritis specialist) about these. Here we list a few basic elements of treating 
this condition:

151
 Chapter 8: Conditions Associated with Celiac Disease
 
✓ Avoid drugs (such as decongestants) that can exacerbate oral dryness.
 
✓ Avoid unduly lowering the humidity in your house. Use a humidifier if 
your house is overly dry.
 
✓ Use artificial tears.
 
✓ Sip water regularly, use artificial saliva preparations, and suck on sugar-
free lozenges. (Sugar-free so as to not promote dental cavities.)
 
✓ Maintain excellent oral hygiene. Brush and floss after every meal. See 
your dentist regularly. Ask your dentist about dental fluoride treatment.
 
✓ Use a vaginal lubricant during intercourse.
Lupus (systemic lupus erythematosis or SLE)
Lupus, or SLE, (the thankfully short forms for systemic lupus erythematosis) is 
an autoimmune connective tissue disease in which there is inflammation of 
the joints and, potentially, many internal organs including the lungs, heart, 
and kidneys. Having celiac disease increases your risk of also having lupus; 
however, your overall risk of acquiring this condition remains low.
 
Because lupus is often characterized, especially early on, by nonspecific 
symptoms, a number of which are common to celiac disease, there is a real 
possibility that you may pass off symptoms you are experiencing as being due 
to your celiac disease when, in fact, they are due to lupus. Therefore, should 
you develop symptoms such as those we discuss in this section — especially 
if they are severe or persisting — be sure to speak to your health care pro-
vider about them.
Lupus can cause many, many, different symptoms — far more than we can 
cover here. These are, however, some of the most common symptoms for 
you to be aware of:
 
✓ Fatigue. This is the most common symptom of all and can be severe.
 
✓ Joint pains. This most commonly affects the joints in the fingers, wrists, 
ankles, and the balls of the feet.
 
✓ Skin rash. The most common type of rash affects the nose and cheeks 
and is in the shape of a butterfly; this type of rash is unsurprisingly 
referred to as a butterfly rash. Another common type of rash is one that 
develops in sun-exposed areas upon, well, exposure to sun.
 
✓ Upper abdominal pain. This can occur with lupus (sometimes as a side 
effect from anti-inflammatory medicines used to treat it) and also com-
monly occurs with celiac disease. As you may imagine, therefore, there 
is the significant chance of misattributing this discomfort to the one con-
dition when it is really due to the other.

152
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
 
If despite carefully following your gluten-free diet you have symptoms such as 
those we just described, be sure to see your physician to have the cause — be 
it lupus or something else altogether — sorted out. Don’t do yourself the dis-
service (and cause yourself the potential hazards) of assuming that just 
because you have celiac disease, this explains all that ails you.
The treatment of lupus can be involved and highly complex and typically 
involves a combination of certain lifestyle measures (such as using sun pro-
tection to help avoid getting a skin rash) and medications that help to reduce 
inflammation, control symptoms, and protect your organs.
Fibromyalgia
Fibromyalgia (also known as fibromyalgia syndrome or FMS) is, to borrow 
Winston Churchill’s words about an entirely different subject, a riddle 
wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.
This very common condition causes various musculoskeletal aches and pains 
yet is unassociated with evidence of inflammation or other form of injury to 
muscles, joints, or other organs. Indeed, fibromyalgia is as remarkable for 
what it is (a constellation of aches and pains) as for what it isn’t (inflamma-
tion or apparent damage to the body).
The relationship between celiac disease and fibromyalgia is far from clear 
and could just be a chance association, but there does appear to be a slight 
increased likelihood of having FMS if you have celiac disease. (If a person 
with FMS has intestinal troubles, it is much more likely that these intestinal 
symptoms are due to irritable bowel syndrome than celiac disease. We dis-
cuss this further in Chapter 12.)
These are some of the most common features of fibromyalgia:
 
✓ Six times more common in women than men.
 
✓ Diffuse, unremitting, waxing and waning pain, most commonly in the 
neck, back, chest, arms, and legs.
 
✓ Fatigue and/or lack of feeling refreshed after sleeping.
 
✓ Mood problems (such as depression or anxiety), thinking problems 
(such as poor short-term memory), or headaches.
 
✓ Tender points (despite having what can be very bothersome — even dis-
abling — symptoms, the affected person typically looks well and, when 
examined by a doctor, the only significant finding is that of discomfort 
when the doctor presses on certain muscles and tendons, collectively 
referred to as tender points.)
 
✓ Normal laboratory tests and x-rays.

153
 Chapter 8: Conditions Associated with Celiac Disease
Although fibromyalgia has no cure, a variety of therapies are available to 
help ease fibromyalgia symptoms, including:
 
✓ Patient education (our all time favorite treatment for so many different 
ailments) — which in and of itself is associated with lessening of 
symptoms.
 
✓ Anti-depressant medication.
 
✓ Analgesics (that is, pain killers).
 
✓ Anti-convulsant medication (that is, anti-epilepsy drugs). Despite the 
name, these types of medicines are often used, with varying success, to 
treat a wide variety of ailments, including FMS, where pain is a feature.
Raynaud’s phenomenon
Raynaud’s phenomenon is a condition in which the fingertips or toes tem-
porarily turn white upon exposure to cold (such as taking something out of 
the freezer). The cold exposure causes small arteries in the digits to go into 
spasm which blocks the flow of blood and hence the reason for the white 
appearance.
Raynaud’s is often present in people with connective tissue diseases (see the 
earlier section “Connective tissue disorders”), and also occurs in people who 
use vibrating machinery such as jackhammers. Some evidence exists that 
people with celiac disease are more prone to Raynaud’s phenomenon.
The mainstay of treatment is to avoid cold exposure by, for example, making 
sure to dress warmly, wear gloves in cold weather or when taking items out 
of the fridge or freezer, and so on. There are also medications available to 
help prevent attacks, the most commonly used ones belonging to a class of 
drug called calcium channel blockers.
Liver and Bile Duct Conditions
Having celiac disease increases your risk of developing certain disorders of 
the liver and the bile ducts. We discuss these disorders in this section.
 
The liver performs a number of essential functions including assisting with 
digestion (by making bile acids that help to digest fat), making clotting factors 
to prevent bleeding, storing and manufacturing glucose, and the list goes on. 
Suffice to say that a healthy liver is integral to good health and just as much a 
vital organ as the heart. The bile ducts are those tubes that take bile acids from 
the liver and deliver them to the small intestine.

154
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Abnormal liver enzyme levels
If you have newly diagnosed celiac disease, you have up to about a 40 per-
cent likelihood that your liver enzyme levels (specifically the transaminase 
levels) will be mildly elevated on a blood test. Elevated liver enzyme levels 
do not necessarily mean that you have significant liver disease. Indeed, these 
enzyme levels typically return to normal within months of starting a gluten-
free diet.
 
Although we haven’t seen a study that proves this, we strongly suspect that 
the great majority of non-celiac disease specialists are unaware of the pre-
ceding point. Therefore, if you have newly diagnosed celiac disease and if a 
doctor advises you that your liver tests are abnormal and recommends fur-
ther investigations be undertaken, there’s no harm in asking whether it would 
be safe to simply wait and recheck the tests a few months after you’ve gotten 
on track with your diet. Depending on the state of your health, the degree of 
abnormality of your liver tests, and so on, it may or may not be appropriate to 
adopt this “wait and see” approach.
If you and your doctor elect to follow this “wait and see” approach, and your 
liver tests do not improve despite your following a gluten-free diet, you then 
need to be checked for liver disease. One of the most common causes of ele-
vated liver enzymes, and unrelated to celiac disease, is so-called “fatty liver” 
(which goes by a variety of other, more formal medical terms including non-
alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH). In the next few sections, we look at liver 
diseases that are related to celiac disease.
Common to all these liver conditions is the need for blood tests as well as 
imaging studies such as an abdominal ultrasound to look at the structure of 
the liver and bile duct system. (To see an illustration of the digestive system, 
see Chapter 2.)
Primary biliary cirrhosis
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune disease that leads to per-
manent scarring of the liver. It derives its name from primary (meaning of 
unknown cause), biliary (pertaining, in this case, to the damage to the bile 
ducts within the liver that occurs with this disease), and cirrhosis (meaning 
permanent, severe liver damage). PBC is the most common of the serious 
liver diseases found in people with celiac disease.
Some of the more common symptoms of PBC are
 
✓ Fatigue
 
✓ Itchy skin (pruritis)
 
✓ Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)

155
 Chapter 8: Conditions Associated with Celiac Disease
If, as unfortunately often happens, PBC progresses to the stage of liver fail-
ure, serious complications develop including excess bleeding and thinking 
problems.
Treatment is geared toward controlling symptoms, treating complications 
as they arise, and using medicines to try to stop worsening liver injury from 
occurring. This last strategy often does not meet with success, and should 
cirrhosis develop, the remaining therapeutic option is to have a liver trans-
plant which is not only life-enhancing, but also life-saving.
Autoimmune hepatitis
Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by liver 
inflammation. It goes by many aliases including active chronic hepatitis and 
autoimmune chronic active hepatitis.
Unlike primary biliary cirrhosis (see the immediately preceding section, 
“Primary biliary cirrhosis”), autoimmune hepatitis typically does not lead 
to progressively worsening liver damage. Indeed, many affected individuals 
remain free of symptoms for many years. Some people, however, have severe 
autoimmune hepatitis with rapid deterioration in their condition.
If you have autoimmune hepatitis, you are at a small increased risk of having 
celiac disease. The converse, however, is not true; that is, the vast majority 
of people with celiac disease never develop autoimmune hepatitis.
Not everyone with autoimmune hepatitis requires treatment. For instance, if 
the condition is very mild, some patients do not require therapy. For more 
active cases, potent medicines are used to suppress the inflammation pres-
ent in the liver.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a disease of unknown cause that leads 
to progressively worsening narrowing and, ultimately, destruction of the bile 
ducts. (Bile ducts carry bile from the liver to the small intestine.) This, in 
turn, leads to severe liver damage.
Most patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis initially have no symptoms. 
As the condition worsens symptoms then develop, the first ones typically 
being fatigue and skin itching (pruritis). Fevers and night sweats are also 
common early symptoms.

156
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
As is true of primary biliary cirrhosis (covered in the previous section, 
“Primary biliary cirrhosis”), treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis is 
geared toward controlling symptoms, treating complications as they arise, 
and using medicines to try to stop worsening liver injury from occurring. 
Unfortunately, despite therapy, the disease tends to progress leading to 
severe liver damage requiring liver transplantation.
A variety of other liver diseases (including some forms of viral hepatitis) 
have also been reported to occur more frequently in people with celiac dis-
ease, but a clearly defined relationship remains to be proven and the rela-
tionship is likely purely coincidental.
Chromosomal Disorders
DNA is the substance in the body’s cells that provides the genetic blueprint 
that is directly responsible for some traits (such as hair and eye color) 
and also plays a role in establishing the risk for certain diseases such as 
heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, celiac disease, and many 
other conditions. DNA is contained in a person’s 23 pairs of chromosomes. 
Chromosomes, in turn, are made up of many small regions called genes. 
Certain chromosomal (meaning, related to the chromosomes) and genetic 
(related to the genes) disorders are associated with celiac disease. We dis-
cuss these disorders in the following sections.
Down syndrome
Down syndrome is a condition in which a person has an extra chromosome 
number 21. Normally, people have 23 pairs of chromosomes (numbered 1 
through 23). A person with Down syndrome, however, has three of chromo-
some number 21 instead of the normal two. Although the way in which Down 
syndrome affects people varies, some of the more common features include 
distinct facial characteristics and a reduced IQ. People with Down syndrome 
have the highest risk of celiac disease of any population group — about 16 
percent.
Because celiac disease is so common among people with Down syndrome, 
some medical authorities recommend routinely screening for celiac disease 
in these patients. On the other hand, because following a gluten-free diet can 
be difficult and may reduce quality of life in people with Down syndrome who 
often have a shortened life expectancy as it is, other experts caution against 
such routine screening in this population.

157
 Chapter 8: Conditions Associated with Celiac Disease
Making a diagnosis of celiac disease in a person with Down syndrome can 
be challenging because the affected person may not necessarily be able to 
readily describe his or her symptoms. For this reason, if you have a loved 
one with Down syndrome who develops persisting or worsening symptoms 
of celiac disease such as weight loss, abdominal pain, or diarrhea, we recom-
mend you let the doctor know and ask that celiac disease be considered as 
a possible cause. There’s nothing wrong about being a (well-informed) advo-
cate for the ones you love.
Turner syndrome
Turner syndrome is a genetic condition in which a female is missing all (or 
part of) one of her two X chromosomes. A person with Turner syndrome 
is likely to be short and have other distinct physical traits. She is also at 
increased risk of having celiac disease. About 10 percent of people with 
Turner syndrome also have celiac disease. Because of this increased risk, if 
you have Turner syndrome and you develop symptoms suggestive of celiac 
disease (see Chapter 6), be sure to notify your physician.
IgA Deficiency
IgA (short for Immunoglobulin A) is a group of antibodies that help fight 
infection. Some people are genetically deficient in IgA. The great majority of 
these people never have any ill-effect from it, but a small percent do have an 
increased number of respiratory and digestive tract infections.
As we discuss in Chapter 3, people with celiac disease face a double-edged 
sword: Not only are they at increased risk of IgA deficiency, but having this 
deficiency further complicates matters because it makes it harder to diag-
nose celiac deficiency. (The best blood test — the IgA tissue transglutamin-
ase antibody — to assist with diagnosing celiac disease is unhelpful in the 
setting of IgA deficiency, so other diagnostic measures, such as the IgG tissue 
transglutaminase antibody, need to be performed instead.)

▶ Preventing gastrointestinal cancer
H
aving celiac disease increases your risk of developing certain types of 
cancer. This is understandably upsetting news to most people living 
with celiac disease; however, as the expression goes, being forewarned is to 
be forearmed. Being aware of this risk allows you to follow precautions to 
reduce your risk of developing cancers related to celiac disease and also to 
monitor yourself for clues that cancer may have developed. In this chapter 
we look in detail at these issues.
 
As you read the potentially intimidating or even downright scary information 
in this chapter, please bear in mind two very important things:
 
✓ Having an increased risk is not the same as having a high risk. The 
vast majority of people with celiac disease never develop any of the can-
cers we discuss in this section.
 
✓ There is evidence that the risk of developing the cancers we discuss 
is reduced, if you have celiac disease, by following a gluten-free diet. 
Indeed, within a few years of being on this diet, your risk will likely 
return to that of someone who has never had celiac disease for even a 
day in their life.
One rather unexpected and pleasantly surprising finding about celiac disease 
and cancer deserves special mention here. Some studies suggest that celiac 
disease actually reduces (!) the risk of a few malignancies including breast 
cancer and, possibly, lung cancer. One reason for the lower risk of lung 
cancer may lie in the observation that people with celiac disease are less 
likely to smoke. That’s certainly a welcome finding! Clearly, there is a lot yet 
to learn about the relationship between celiac disease and cancer.

160
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Assessing How Great 
the Increased Risk Is
Your risk of developing any type of cancer as a direct result of your celiac 
disease is very, very small indeed. You may not, however, readily glean this 
from the sometimes alarmist information on this topic that one comes across 
on the Internet. In this section, we explore the topic of cancer risk.
 
When doctors talk of a person being at increased risk of having a particular 
disease, they are actually referring to two different types of risk: relative risk 
and absolute risk.
The differences between these are legion and we wish not only that physi-
cians were more precise in their use of these terms, but that the press was, 
too (regardless whether the press is discussing the risk of a disease, the risk 
of a natural disaster, or any other risk for that matter). Much undo fear is cre-
ated because of the overly loose use of the term “risk.”
 
✓ Relative risk: Relative risk is the risk, or likelihood, of one thing happen-
ing compared to the risk of something else happening. For example, the 
relative risk of a person with celiac disease developing a type of cancer 
called EATCL (which we discuss in detail later in this chapter) compared 
with the risk of this same cancer developing in someone who does not 
have celiac disease is about four fold. (This number varies somewhat 
from study to study, but averages out to four.) In other words, the fact 
that you have celiac disease means you have an approximately four 
times greater likelihood of developing this type of cancer compared to 
the population at large. (It used to be thought that the risk for this type 
of cancer for patients with celiac disease was as high as 50 to 100 times 
greater than for the general population! Recent studies, however, reveal 
that this risk is much, much lower.)
 
✓ Absolute risk: Absolute risk is the risk of something happening without 
comparing it to another risk. If we again look at the risk of developing 
the EATCL cancer mentioned earlier, if you have celiac disease your 
absolute risk of developing this cancer is about one in two hundred and 
fifty thousand which is clearly a very low risk indeed.
Looking at both relative and absolute risk at the same time, for EATCL, if you 
have celiac disease, your relative risk of developing this cancer goes up by 
about four times (which is concerning), which means that your absolute risk 
goes from one in one million to one in two hundred and fifty thousand (which 
is not nearly as concerning). Clearly, despite the higher risk, the odds are 
overwhelming you’re never going to acquire this type of cancer! Basically, if 
something happens very rarely — like this type of cancer — even if the risk 
goes up, it still happens very rarely.

161
 Chapter 9: Celiac Disease and Cancer
If you have celiac disease and remain concerned about your risk of EATCL — 
which would be completely understandable — you might also ponder this: 
Your risk of developing this cancer is the same, according to no less than 
the British Medical Journal — of being killed in your home . . . by a falling 
airplane! Not worried about an airplane hitting your house? Then you likely 
need not be overly worried about getting this form of cancer either.
 
Of course, even though you are at low risk, this is clearly not the same as 
being at no risk, and cancer due to celiac disease does happen. In the remain-
der of this chapter we look in detail at the key information you should know 
about the various celiac disease-related cancers starting with those factors 
that influence your risk of developing cancer.
Factors influencing your risk of cancer
Looking at all people with celiac disease, the risk of any particular individual 
developing a celiac disease-related cancer is very small. But, of course, you 
are an individual, not just a member of a group, and individuals with celiac 
disease have differing cancer risks depending on a few, particular character-
istics. Specifically, compared with all people with celiac disease, your indi-
vidual risk of acquiring a cancer related to celiac disease is increased if:
 
✓ You had celiac disease for quite some time before it was diagnosed. 
(This likely increases your risk of cancer by virtue of the longer duration 
of time that you would have been exposed to gluten.)
 
✓ Your celiac disease has been poorly controlled; especially if you have 
refractory celiac disease (see Chapter 12 for more on refractory celiac 
disease).
 
✓ You haven’t been following a gluten-free diet.
 
✓ You were diagnosed with celiac disease as an adult, especially over age 
50, and not as a child. (Note: This does not apply if you were diagnosed 
as a child and were later told you had outgrown this illness and you then 
returned to eating gluten. In this situation, you have an increased risk of 
developing refractory celiac disease (see Chapter 12) later in life, which, 
in turn, increases the risk of developing EATCL. We discuss the fallacy of 
“outgrowing” celiac disease in Chapter 17.)
Although you can’t control all of these factors, you can follow a gluten-free 
diet. By doing so, your cancer risk will likely quickly fall to the same level as 
people who do not have celiac disease. We discuss other ways to prevent 
cancer later in the later section “Preventing cancer.”

162
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Possible reasons for an increased 
risk of cancer
Why does celiac disease increase the risk of some cancers? The quick answer 
is that medical science simply doesn’t know. Having said that, there are no 
shortage of theories such as these:
 
✓ The chronic, over-stimulation of the immune system caused by celiac 
disease may promote the development of cancer cells and/or interfere 
with the immune system’s normal ability to destroy cancer cells or 
potentially cancerous cells.
 
✓ Celiac disease causes malabsorption of important substances, possibly 
including cancer-fighting nutrients and vitamins. As a result you have 
fewer of these substances to help protect you from cancer.
 
✓ Celiac disease may make the intestine more susceptible to absorbing 
into the body potentially carcinogenic/toxic substances present in the 
foods we eat.
 
✓ The inflammation in the body caused by celiac disease may, in itself, be 
toxic on some tissues and cause them to become cancerous.
Looking at the Types of Cancer for 
Which You Are at Increased Risk
There are several types of cancer for which you may be at increased risk if 
you have celiac disease. Here we list them and in the following sections we 
look at the more common types in detail:
 
✓ Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATCL) is a rare form of 
cancer affecting the small intestine. It’s the cancer most closely linked to 
celiac disease.
 
✓ Certain other types of lymphomas including other T cell as well as B 
cell lymphomas (we discuss T and B lymphocytes that give rise to these 
cancers in Chapter 2).
 
✓ Small intestine adenocarcinoma is a rare cancer of the small intestine.
 
✓ Oropharyngeal cancer is cancer of the mouth and throat.
 
✓ Esophageal cancer is a cancer of the esophagus.
In your travels of the cyberspace kind, you may come across discussions 
about a variety of other cancers that are said to occur more commonly if you 
have celiac disease. The reason why different sources say different things lies 

163
 Chapter 9: Celiac Disease and Cancer
in the fact that scientific studies can vary considerably in the way they are 
performed and the groups of people they evaluate; as a result, different stud-
ies often arrive at different conclusions.
Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma
Of the various cancers associated with celiac disease, enteropathy-associated 
T cell lymphoma is the cancer that is most closely linked. Nonetheless, 
whether or not you have celiac disease, it occurs only rarely (that is, your 
absolute risk for this cancer remains tiny). Because this is the type of cancer 
most closely linked to celiac disease, we look at it in detail in this section.
 
In your Internet travels, you may come across three different abbreviations for 
this one condition:
 
✓ EATCL for enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma. This abbreviation is 
the one most often used, and it’s the one we use in this book.
 
✓ EATL for enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma.
 
✓ EITL for enteropathy-associated intestinal T cell lymphoma.
Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma derives its name from entero (mean-
ing intestinal), pathy (short for pathology or abnormality) associated (having 
to do with), T cell (T cells are the specific type of white blood cells — specifi-
cally white blood cells called lymphocytes — that are involved), lymphoma 
(meaning a cancer that begins in cells of the immune system). You can read-
ily see why it’s called EATCL instead!
 
In your travels you may also come across the term non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 
Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (abbreviated NHL) is the name for a group of differ-
ent types of lymphomas that share certain features in common. EATCL is a 
member of this group.
 
Like virtually every other cell type in the body, cells in the immune system 
can become cancerous (and, as mentioned, these types of cancers are called 
lymphomas). EATCL is a type of lymphoma that starts in the intra-epithelial 
lymphocytes (IELs), which are located in the lining of the small intestine. A 
hallmark of celiac disease (and present in virtually all cases) is an increased 
number of these cells. In those rare cases where these cells become cancer-
ous, it is thought to be a result of their being excessively stimulated by the 
overly active immune system in the small intestine that occurs if celiac dis-
ease is insufficiently treated.

164
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Symptoms of EATCL
These are the most common symptoms of EATCL:
 
✓ Abdominal pain (typically felt as a dull ache or fullness)
 
✓ Diarrhea
 
✓ Fever
 
✓ Loss of appetite (anorexia)
 
✓ Malaise (that is, feeling generally unwell)
 
✓ Weight loss
At one time or another you (and everyone else) have likely experienced most, 
or even all, of the symptoms in the preceding list. Most likely they quickly 
passed on their own. With EATCL, however, the symptoms don’t pass. Day 
after day after day you continue to feel unwell, your weight may progres-
sively fall, fevers may persist, and so forth. If ever you are in this situation, 
you should contact your doctor to be checked out. It may turn out to be 
nothing; however, it could also be that something is seriously wrong, be it 
EATCL or some other, significant ailment. EATCL can also lead to perforation 
(a hole or tear) in the wall of the intestine. If this happens, you can experi-
ence, sudden, severe abdominal pain that requires immediate medical 
attention.
Other features of EATCL that a doctor looks for when they suspect you have 
this condition are:
 
✓ An enlarged liver.
 
✓ A mass (that is, a growth) in your abdomen.
 
✓ Swollen lymph glands. Although EATCL begins in the lymph cells in the 
small intestine, it often spreads to lymph glands elsewhere in the body 
including those that a doctor can feel in locations such as the groin.
Tests to investigate suspected EATCL
If your doctor suspects you have EATCL, you will be sent for a number of dif-
ferent tests, both to establish the diagnosis and, if present, to determine its 
extent. Tests may include the following:
 
✓ An ear, nose, and throat examination to look for swollen lymph glands 
in these areas of your body.
 
✓ A CT (“CAT”) scan of your chest. A CT scan is a type of x-ray and is 
done, in this context, to look for evidence of lymph gland cancer within 
your chest.

165
 Chapter 9: Celiac Disease and Cancer
 
✓ A CT scan of your abdomen to look for this cancer within your abdo-
men. This test sometimes includes having you swallow barium (a chalky 
liquid) before the CT scan is performed. The barium shows up white on 
the x-ray and allows fine details of your small intestine’s appearance to 
be better visualized. This combined barium/CT scan procedure is called 
CT enteroclysis.
 
✓ Barium x-rays to look for this cancer within your gastrointestinal tract.
 
✓ Capsule endoscopy to look for cancerous growths within your gastroin-
testinal tract. (See Chapter 3 for more on capsule endoscopy.)
 
✓ Endoscopic procedures to directly visualize the area where a tumor is 
suspected. (For more on endoscopic procedures, see Chapter 3.)
 
✓ A biopsy of the suspected cancerous tissue.
 
Like virtually any other cancer, a diagnosis of EATCL should only be made if a 
tissue sample (biopsy) of the suspected cancer has been obtained and, when 
analyzed by the pathologist, is found to show certain specific features of this 
disease. In some cases, a biopsy sample of suspected EATCL can be obtained 
by performing an endoscopy; in other cases, abdominal surgery may be 
required.
Treatment of EATCL
EATCL is treated with surgery and chemotherapy (that is, drugs) to try to 
shrink the cancerous tissue. Unfortunately, this treatment often has limited 
effectiveness and the prognosis is poor.
Other lymphomas
Of the various cancers associated with celiac disease, enteropathy-associated 
T cell lymphoma (see the preceding section) has the strongest association 
with celiac disease. However, other types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas are 
somewhat more likely to occur in celiac disease. These include other non-
intestinal T cell lymphomas as well as B cell lymphomas including diffuse 
large B cell lymphoma.
These lymphomas can be associated with swollen lymph glands. Symptoms 
such as fever, drenching sweats, and weight loss may also develop. The main-
stay of therapy is with chemotherapy. Radiation therapy is also often used. If 
a large tumor mass is present, this may require surgery to remove it.

166
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Small intestine adenocarcinoma
Small intestine adenocarcinoma is a form of cancer of the epithelial cells that 
make up the top layer of cells lining the small intestine. This cancer is uncom-
mon in the general population. Having celiac disease seems to increase the 
risk of this cancer. This increased risk may be related to the known cancer 
risk associated with chronic inflammation in the body (as is seen if celiac dis-
ease is untreated or insufficiently treated).
The most common symptoms of small intestine adenocarcinoma are abdomi-
nal pain and weight loss. Sometimes, the tumor can lead to bleeding, in 
which case you would start to pass blood with your stools. Everyone gets 
abdominal pain of one type or another from time to time; however, if you get 
abdominal pain that is particularly bad or that persists (especially if you are 
also losing weight), see your doctor.
Small intestine adenocarcinoma can often be treated by surgically removing 
the diseased part of the intestine.
Oropharyngeal cancer
Oropharyngeal cancer is cancer of the oral cavity (mouth, tongue, and so 
forth). Cancer of the inside lining of the mouth or tongue typically appears as 
a painless area of firm, often pale-colored tissue.
Reports of an increased risk of oropharyngeal cancers come from European 
studies. Interestingly these cancers have not been observed at an increased 
rate in North Americans with celiac disease. We suspect this difference is 
accounted for by the methods used in the studies, not by a true difference in 
the frequency of these tumors on different sides of the Atlantic.
Treatment consists of surgery, sometimes also with radiation therapy.
 
Tobacco smoking and chewing are tremendous risk factors for oral cancer. 
This huge risk is made even higher if you also have celiac disease. We cannot 
emphasize strongly enough the importance, if you smoke, of doing everything 
humanly possible to quit.
 
Oral cancers are often first detected by the dentist during a routine dental 
examination. However, you can look inside your own mouth from time to time 
by using a light and a mirror, and if you see (or feel) anything suspicious, let 
your doctor know.

167
 Chapter 9: Celiac Disease and Cancer
Esophageal cancer
As we discuss in Chapter 2, the esophagus is the swallowing tube that con-
nects the mouth to the stomach.
There are two main types of esophageal cancer: squamous cell cancer and 
adenocarcinoma. It is the squamous cell type of cancer of the esophagus that 
has been reported to be increased in celiac disease. However, the studies 
that showed this increased risk looked at European populations and similar 
evidence of risk for North Americans is lacking. This discrepancy is not read-
ily explained and, as we noted in the previous section regarding orpharyn-
geal cancers, we suspect it relates more to the manner in which the studies 
were done than to true differences in the populations in question.
The most common symptoms of esophageal cancer are weight loss and dif-
ficulty swallowing larger, dry items such as toast or meat, with them getting 
stuck in the esophagus. This is typically felt as a sudden uncomfortable pain 
behind the breast bone (the sternum) developing immediately after swallow-
ing and quickly going away by drinking fluids (which push the food down into 
the stomach). Let your doctor know if you develop these symptoms.
As with cancer of the mouth, tobacco use is a major risk factor in the devel-
opment of squamous cell cancer of the esophagus, so avoiding tobacco is the 
best way to prevent this (and many other kinds of cancer, too).
Treatment of esophageal cancer includes radiation therapy, chemotherapy, 
and surgery.
Other cancers and celiac disease
In addition to the cancers we have already discussed, various medical stud-
ies suggest there may be a small increase of some other types of cancers if 
you have celiac disease.
Cancer of the pancreas, liver, and bile ducts
The risk of cancer of the pancreas, liver, and bile ducts may be increased. 
Cancer of the pancreas typically causes rapid and profound weight loss, and 
upper abdominal and back pain. Liver cancer and bile duct cancer are com-
monly discovered after someone becomes jaundiced (in which a yellow tinge 
affecting the skin and the whites of the eyes is found).

168
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Cancer of the colon (large intestine)
There is conflicting information regarding the risk of colon cancer if you have 
celiac disease. Some medical studies suggest your risk goes up if you have 
celiac disease, and some studies suggest your risk goes down. The fact that 
such opposite research results have been found suggests that, if an increased 
risk of this cancer does exist, it must be very small. (If the risk of a disease 
is dramatically increased, typically different studies carried out in different 
populations should consistently show at least some degree of increased risk.)
 
Colon cancer is quite a common cancer in the general population. We recom-
mend that everyone — whether they have celiac disease or not — starting at 
age 50 get checked out for colon cancer. If you are at increased risk of colon 
cancer because colon cancer developed in a first degree family member (your 
parents or siblings) at a relatively young age (under age 60), then you should 
start having you check-ups earlier than 50 years of age. 
Leukemia
Leukemias are cancers of the white blood cells. Studies have not shown 
an increased rate of these cancers in people with celiac disease, but have 
reported an increased rate if you have a closely related condition called der-
matitis herpetiformis. We discuss dermatitis herpetiformis in Chapter 8.
Breast cancer
Several studies suggest that the risk of a woman developing breast cancer 
is decreased if you have celiac disease but, of course, this is not a reason to 
ignore your breast health. Your primary health care provider or gynecologist 
can tell you the best screening schedule for you to follow.
Screening for Cancer
Screening for a disease is searching for a condition in the absence of evi-
dence, such as symptoms, to suggest it is present. Examples of screening 
for cancer in the general population are performing breast self-examination 
or mammograms in women and performing a prostate examination or PSA 
blood test in men.
Knowing that certain cancers occur with increased frequency in people with 
celiac disease, the question arises whether these cancers should be routinely 
screened for in this population. In order to justify screening for a celiac 
disease-related cancer, the probability of having the cancer would have to 
be sufficient to justify the time, labor, costs, hassles, discomfort, and, impor-
tantly, the risks of the screening tests themselves. (Everything has a risk 
including, for example, the risk of a test result being incorrect and indicating 
an abnormality when, in fact, none exists — a so-called false positive result — 
which would lead to further, unnecessary tests.)

169
 Chapter 9: Celiac Disease and Cancer
At present, routine screening for celiac disease-related cancers is not thought 
to be justified. Screening is, however, warranted for certain individuals such 
as those with refractory celiac disease where the risk of cancer becomes suf-
ficiently high as to make screening appropriate. Screening procedures would 
include a doctor interviewing you to review how you’re feeling and then 
examining your abdomen and checking for swollen lymph glands. A capsule 
endoscopy, an ultrasound of the abdomen, and other tests may also be done. 
We discuss this further in Chapter 12.
Preventing Cancer
As we mention at the outset of this chapter, there is scientific evidence that 
people with celiac disease can reduce the likelihood of developing celiac 
disease-associated cancer by following a gluten-free diet and that doing so 
reduces the risk to the same level as someone without celiac disease within a 
few years.
The most likely reason why following a gluten-free diet provides this pro-
tection (in people with celiac disease) lies in the now well-established link 
between chronic inflammation in the body and cancer. Active celiac disease 
is, by definition, a condition in which there is inflammation. Following a 
gluten-free diet eliminates this inflammation and, hence, reduces your cancer 
risk.
Another option, used specifically to prevent EATCL (explained in the earlier 
section “Enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma”) is to have a bone marrow 
transplant. In this procedure, you are given in intravenous injection of bone 
marrow tissue taken from a donor. The complexity and hazards of this form 
of therapy warrant its use, in terms of celiac disease, only to people with 
severe refractory celiac disease because only these people would be at suf-
ficiently high risk of cancer to justify it. This method to prevent EATCL is 
only available in a few university hospitals worldwide. We discuss refractory 
disease and other treatment options for it in Chapter 12.
 
Because, for most individuals with celiac disease, the likelihood of getting 
cancer is so minimally, if at all, increased (compared to someone without 
celiac disease), special screening and prevention strategies are seldom nec-
essary. As we tell members of celiac support groups who are worried about 
getting a celiac disease-related cancer such as EATCL, if you have celiac dis-
ease, the best possible thing for you to do to protect yourself from cancer is 
to follow the same healthy living strategies as the general population; focus-
ing undue attention on the “rare bird” cancers seen with celiac disease is not 
nearly as helpful.

170
Part II: How Celiac Disease Can Make You Feel 
Here are some ways to protect yourself from getting gastrointestinal cancer 
(and many other health problems while you’re at it):
 
✓ Avoid tobacco products of any kind.
 
✓ Drink alcohol in moderation.
 
✓ Get regular physical exercise.
 
✓ Maintain a healthy weight (Chapter 11 has pointers).
 
✓ Eat a balanced diet that is not too high in fat, red meat, and processed 
foods, and that contains fiber, fruits, and vegetables.
Here’s to your (celiac) good health!

In this part . . .
T
he essential ingredient to treating celiac disease is 
removal of an ingredient: gluten! In this part, you dis-
cover the whys and wherefores of eliminating gluten from 
your diet to keep you healthy. We also explore other 
important nutritional considerations and what to do if fol-
lowing a gluten-free diet doesn’t appear to be working the 
way it should.

I
f you are looking for a silver lining to having celiac disease, perhaps it is 
that you can successfully treat your condition without needing even a 
single medication. (As physicians, we love being able to tell our patients who 
are newly diagnosed with celiac disease that we don’t have to even take our 
prescription pad out of the drawer!) The power to controlling your celiac dis-
ease is all yours.
The key to successfully treating your celiac disease is changing your diet. 
Because consuming gluten is what triggers celiac disease in predisposed 
individuals, the treatment relies on eliminating — not just reducing — gluten 
from your diet.
A diet in which gluten is eliminated is unimaginatively, but fittingly, called a 
gluten-free diet. (Oh wouldn’t it be a joy if doctors could always be so plain-
spoken!) Following a gluten-free diet can be challenging because so many of 
the foods people routinely eat contain gluten and, also, it’s not always readily 
apparent whether a food contains gluten in the first place.
In this chapter, we look at the ins and outs of following a gluten-free diet, 
how to find gluten-free foods when you’re doing your grocery shopping, and 
how to take those purchases and turn them into tasty and healthy gluten-free 
meals. We also look at hidden sources of gluten for which you’ll need to be 
on the lookout to avoid inadvertently consuming gluten.

174
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
Going Gluten-Free
So you’ve just been to your doctor and been told you have celiac disease 
and need to go on a gluten-free diet. As you left the office you may well 
have asked yourself, “What is a “gluten-free diet?” and “What am I supposed 
to do?” You may have felt disarmed, frustrated, and anxious all at once. 
Unfortunately, some busy doctors sometimes don’t say much more than 
telling their newly diagnosed patients to look up this diet on the Internet. 
Looking up medical information on the Internet can be confusing for patients 
and their families because there are so many sites to look at, and these 
often offer very contrasting — or even contradictory — advice. As we tell all 
our patients with celiac disease (and many other diseases, too), and as we 
discuss in Chapter 1, the Internet is a wonderful resource but is also a some-
times dangerous place from which to glean medical information (which is, by 
the way, a major reason we wrote this book).
Knowing what “gluten-free” means
As we discuss in Chapter 2, glutens are proteins found in grains such as 
wheat, rye (in which gluten is in the form of a protein called secalin), and 
barley (in which gluten is in the form of a protein called hordein). Various 
other gluten-containing grains include bulgur, couscous, durum, einkorn, 
emmer, farina, farro, kamut, semolina, spelt (dinkel), and triticale. In North 
America and most of the western world, the major source of gluten is wheat 
because this is the most commonly eaten cereal grain.
The key to staying healthy with celiac disease is following a gluten-free diet. 
This means avoiding any and all gluten.
 
Gluten can be found in many different types of packaged and processed foods. 
Therefore, to succeed with your gluten-free diet, you need to carefully scruti-
nize the labels of any food products you buy or cook with to ensure they don’t 
contain gluten. This is the single biggest challenge in living gluten-free.
In the United States, labeling for the eight main food allergens — milk, eggs, 
peanuts, tree nuts (almonds, Brazil nuts, cashews, hazelnuts [filberts], 
macadamia nuts, pecans, pine nuts [pignolias], pistachio nuts, and walnuts), 
fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat — began in 2006 and labeling for gluten began 
in 2008.
We wholeheartedly support this important labeling when, indeed, a product 
contains these substances. Most people consider it a mixed blessing, how-
ever, when a manufacturer indicates not that the product contains one of 
these food ingredients, but that it was produced in a facility that processes 
these food ingredients.

 Chapter 10: Treating Celiac Disease with a Gluten-Free Diet
On the one hand, it makes sense to exercise this extra caution, for example, 
if there is a chance that consuming a food item (which may be contaminated 
with an allergen) could cause a serious or even fatal reaction. On the other 
hand, it means this same warning is present when there is only the most 
remote likelihood of causing any sort of problem at all. By way of example, 
Sheila recently purchased a salsa containing tomatoes, onions, peppers, 
cilantro, garlic, lemon juice, vinegar, salt, and spices. As expected, and as 
appropriate, neither wheat nor gluten were listed. Indeed, gluten was assur-
edly not present. However, printed below this list of ingredients was the 
statement “Made on shared equipment with wheat, milk, eggs, peanuts, tree 
nuts, soy, fish, and shellfish.” In other words, this product, which clearly 
didn’t contain gluten, was now flagged (likely for legal reasons alone) as 
potentially dangerous. What is the consumer to do in this situation? (And, as 
Sheila’s husband has celiac disease, she is indeed just such a consumer.)
 
When you encounter this predicament, we suggest using common sense when 
deciding whether or not to purchase such an item. Contamination by gluten 
is highly unlikely to occur if a product is, like Sheila’s aforementioned salsa, 
naturally gluten-free. In contrast, if you’re considering whether to purchase a 
baked good (which, therefore, is at higher risk of contamination with gluten) 
made without gluten but in a facility that produces foods containing gluten, 
then we suggest taking a pass on the item.
Knowing whether you need to eliminate 
other things besides gluten
Wheat and other grains contain many different proteins. Of these, glutens are 
the ones responsible for the problems seen with celiac disease. The other 
proteins found in these foodstuffs seldom cause health problems regardless 
of whether you have celiac disease.
Defining a gluten-free diet, according 
to international standards
Different countries have different standards as 
to what constitutes a gluten-free diet. As of July 
2008, a new international codex standard defines 
gluten-free as containing not more than 20 mil-
ligrams of gluten per kilogram of food or less 
than 20 parts per million (ppm). This is similar to 
a new proposed U.S. standard which is expected 
to be put into practice soon. The international 
codex standard also defines “reduced gluten” 
foods as containing between 20 and 100 ppm of 
gluten. However, it is not recommended in North 
America that those with celiac disease consume 
reduced gluten foods. As little as 50 milligrams of 
gluten a day can cause intestinal damage! The 
bottom line: Don’t play with fire; if you have celiac 
disease, avoid any and all gluten.

176
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
Just because you have celiac disease does not mean that you are also prone 
to having food allergies. Indeed, although we’ve looked after numerous 
patients with celiac disease, between us we’ve only had a few patients who 
had both celiac disease and a true food allergy. Similarly, if you have celiac 
disease, you are not at an increased risk of other food intolerances (with the 
exception of lactose intolerance — see Chapter 11 — which can be present 
in some patients who have yet to begin their gluten-free diet). Therefore, the 
only restriction for most individuals with celiac disease is to avoid gluten.
 
Life with celiac disease is complicated enough; don’t make things more diffi-
cult on yourself by looking for things other than gluten to eliminate from 
your diet.
Many people with untreated celiac disease observe what they interpret to 
be intolerance or sensitivity to many different types of foods, but once they 
eliminate gluten from their diet, these other problems melt away. In other 
words, it had been gluten alone to which they had truly been intolerant.
 
If you have celiac disease and have successfully removed all gluten from your 
diet yet you continue to have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms (such as abdomi-
nal cramps and diarrhea), speak to your doctor about whether you may also 
have some other GI disorder such as irritable bowel syndrome or functional 
dyspepsia (which we discuss in Chapter 12).
To find out more about the differences between food allergies, food sensitivi-
ties, and gluten’s effect if you have celiac disease, have a look at Chapter 2.
Examining the reasons for a gluten-free diet
As we discuss in Chapter 2, gluten is the driving force in the immune 
response that leads to intestinal damage in celiac disease. Without gluten 
in the diet, even someone with the genetic predisposition to celiac disease 
would never develop the condition. (This is one reason why some individu-
als, once they’ve had a family member diagnosed with celiac disease, elect 
to put their entire family on a gluten-free diet “just in case” other members of 
the family may also be prone to this condition. We look at the pros and cons 
of doing so in Chapters 14 and 17.)
Once gluten is no longer present in the diet, the immune reaction it triggered 
quickly starts to settle, and the intestine starts to heal. However, if you then 
consume even a small amount of gluten, you reactivate the immune system 
problem that led to your original intestinal damage; in other words, you’ll 
immediately start to undo the healing process. Moral of the story: If you have 
celiac disease, never consume gluten! (Sorry if we sound like a broken record 
on this point, but it’s so important, we’ll risk redundancy for the sake of 
emphasis.)

177
 Chapter 10: Treating Celiac Disease with a Gluten-Free Diet
 
Richard was a 49 year-old Italian-American man who, having recently moved 
to Sheila’s locale, was referred to her for ongoing management of his celiac 
disease. At the time of their first meeting, Richard told Sheila that he was fol-
lowing a gluten-free diet and that he felt perfectly well. When Sheila examined 
him, she didn’t find anything amiss. Nonetheless, subsequent blood tests 
came back abnormal, revealing both a positive tissue transglutaminase anti-
body (see Chapter 3) and iron deficiency anemia (Chapter 7) — findings that 
were in keeping with active bowel damage from celiac disease. Sheila then per-
formed an endoscopy and small intestine biopsy which confirmed the previ-
ous test results. When Sheila shared these results with Richard, he sheepishly 
told her that he “loved pasta” and just “couldn’t stay away from it.” Sheila 
explained to Richard the hazards of ongoing consumption of gluten (as is 
found in pasta) and had Richard meet with an expert nutritionist who rein-
forced this message. Regrettably, Richard ignored the advice, and it was only 
when he then became ill with worsening anemia, shortness of breath, and 
fatigue that he finally took things to heart, eliminated gluten from his diet 
(including changing to gluten-free pasta), and gradually improved. Sheila well 
recalls Richard’s parting words from their most recent visit: “Dr. Crowe, I 
guess I’m lucky that I eventually smartened up. It could’ve been a lot worse. 
Heck, I could have gotten osteoporosis or,” he hesitated, “even cancer.”
Understanding the downsides 
of a gluten-free diet
Following a gluten-free diet is not an easy task. Regrettably, some well-
meaning doctors, in an attempt to reassure their patients, make it out to be. 
Clearly they don’t have to follow it themselves! Figuring out which foods 
are gluten-free and which are not is a big task for most people with newly 
diagnosed celiac disease and can be down-right overwhelming at times. And 
because the person with celiac disease isn’t necessarily the one who buys 
the family’s groceries or does the family’s cooking, these challenges fall on 
other shoulders, too.
Living gluten-free requires knowledge, motivation, and perseverance. Here 
are some of the hurdles you will confront:
 
✓ Preparing gluten-free baked goods. Food preparation involves trial and 
error and, as Sheila knows from her own experiences, can be frustrating 
and downright disappointing at times.
 
✓ Eating out of the home. Whether you eat at the homes of friends and 
relatives, school and work events, or parties; while traveling; or in any 
of the vast number of other situations in which you find yourself eating 
away from home, you can find yourself exposed to gluten even when you 
don’t intend to.

178
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
 
✓ Social pressures. It isn’t always easy to contend with friends or relatives 
who say “Oh, just a bit won’t hurt you” or, in the case of a child with 
celiac disease, the situation where other children make fun of him or her 
for not eating birthday cake at a friend’s party (instead, having brought 
their own gluten-free treat).
 
✓ Being tempted to revert back to gluten-containing foods. As Richard 
discovered in an anecdote earlier in this chapter, it can be darn hard to 
say good-bye to your favorite foods.
Most people with celiac disease complain about missing a few key foods, 
such as bread, pizza, and pasta, when they start a gluten-free diet. In spite of 
the many recent advances in the types and quality of gluten-free food avail-
ability in North America, the truth of the matter remains that gluten-free 
products are often simply not as tasty as their gluten-containing counter-
parts. Adding insult to injury, gluten-free products such as cookies, breads, 
cakes, and other baked goods are generally more expensive than their gluten-
containing equivalents. Indeed, a study conducted by the Celiac Disease 
Center at Columbia University in New York reported that gluten-free versions 
of products like bread, pizza, and crackers are nearly three times as expen-
sive as regular products. (Similar observations have been made in a study 
performed in Canada.) Geesh.
Now, lest we leave this section on a dour note, we must add this: Despite all 
the hurdles we’ve just listed, the vast majority of patients with celiac disease 
and their families adjust very well to a gluten-free diet. Indeed, as the family 
watches a previously ill loved one with recently diagnosed celiac disease 
recover good health, following a gluten-free diet becomes, if not necessarily a 
pleasure, at least a true labor of love.
Getting help
Learning about a gluten-free diet takes time and effort and, most importantly, 
a reliable source of information. It is, therefore, essential that you meet 
with an experienced and knowledgeable registered dietitian (nutritionist) 
to receive expert guidance. Most physicians have neither the time nor the 
necessary knowledge to provide this counseling. (Sheila, who is married to a 
person with celiac disease, likes to refer to herself as one of the few gastroen-
terologists in North America who knows firsthand about the gluten-free diet, 
yet she still relies on nutritionists to assist her in educating her patients and 
their families.)

179
 Chapter 10: Treating Celiac Disease with a Gluten-Free Diet
 
Not all dietitians know as much about celiac disease as would be ideal. 
Therefore, rather than you referring yourself to a dietitian you find in the 
phone book or online, we recommend that you ask your celiac disease special-
ist or family physician to refer you to one. Alternatively, you can call your 
local hospital and ask whether it has a celiac disease clinic; if it does, then you 
can book your own appointment with the clinic’s dietitian. Another option is 
to be in touch with a celiac disease support group and find out who other 
people living with celiac disease are seeing for nutrition counseling.
Saving on your taxes if you are living gluten-free
Having celiac disease can be considered for a 
tax deduction in Canada and the United States. 
The eligibility requirements and the amount you 
can deduct vary depending on the jurisdiction 
in which you live, but in this sidebar, we look at 
some general policies that are typically in place.
To qualify for a tax benefit, you need a letter 
or a completed form from a physician certify-
ing your diagnosis of celiac disease. This typi-
cally requires that you’ve had a small intestine 
biopsy that showed changes of celiac disease.
Eligibility for a possible tax benefit typically 
applies only to the individuals in the household 
who have celiac disease, not to other members 
of the family.
Your annual income, deductions, plus other 
medical expenses are factors that determine 
whether keeping track of the cost of being 
gluten-free and submitting this information is 
worth doing. In the United States, if your total 
medical expenses for the tax year exceed 7.5 
percent of your adjusted gross income, you can 
write off certain expenses associated with celiac 
disease. More information about deducting the 
costs of food as they apply in the United States 
can be found at www.irs.gov/pub/irs-
pdf/p502.pdf and the Canadian counter-
part is available at www.cra-arc.gc.ca/
tx/ndvdls/tpcs/clc-eng.html.
Here are some expenses that qualify as addi-
tional costs of living gluten-free:
 ✓ Differences in the costs of buying gluten-
free foods compared to their gluten-
containing equivalents. Again, document 
the costs of comparable products that are 
not gluten-free.
 ✓ Extra automobile mileage to obtain gluten-
free foods. Keep a log of miles incurred for 
such outings.
 ✓ Shipping charges for mail-orders for pur-
chasing gluten-free ingredients, foods, 
cookbooks, and so on. Itemize these and 
make a note of what the comparable costs 
would have been had you instead bought 
similar, but gluten-containing items. The tax 
department may want this information.
 ✓ Special items that are not used except in 
gluten-free cooking, such as xantham gum.
Be sure to always save any and all receipts for 
these purchases. The tax department requires 
these to support your medical expense claims.
To paraphrase advice from Janet Rinehart, 
chairman and founder of the Houston Celiac 
Support Group and Sheila’s friend and col-
league from the years she spent in Texas, if you 
have a lot of annual medical expenses, keeping 
track of costs of gluten-free items and the asso-
ciated costs is probably worthwhile; otherwise, 
probably not.

180
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
 
If you have private health insurance, check with your insurer to see whether 
your policy covers the costs of dietary counseling. In Canada, there is typi-
cally no charge for obtaining nutrition counseling as long as it is provided in a 
hospital-based clinic.
Shopping Successfully 
for Gluten-Free Foods
The first rule of thumb in going gluten-free is giving up foods that come in 
cans, boxes, jars, and other packages. Eating naturally gluten-free foods such 
as fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, meat, poultry, fish, seafood, dairy prod-
ucts, and certain grains such as rice and (pure) oats will ensure you are not 
inadvertently consuming gluten. These basic items should become the staple 
foods of your diet. (Because processed foods are typically not as healthy as 
non-processed foods, avoiding these is a good idea not only for those with 
celiac disease but for everyone.)
If you’re going to shop successfully for gluten-free foods, you need to know 
which foods contain gluten and which do not. As we discuss in Chapter 2, 
rice, corn, (pure) oats, soy, millet, teff, sorghum, buckwheat (kasha), quinoa, 
and amaranth do not contain gluten. These grains can be used to make flours 
which are helpful when baking gluten-free goods. Other items that can be 
milled into flour and are gluten-free are:
 
✓ Chickpeas (garbanzos)
 
✓ Job’s Tears (Hato Mugi, Juno’s Tears, River Grain)
 
✓ Lentils
 
✓ Peas
 
✓ Ragi
 
✓ Tapioca
 
✓ Wild rice
Corn flours such as masa and hominy are also gluten-free.
When you do have to purchase foods that come in cans, jars, packets, and 
boxes, learning how to read the list of ingredients on the food label is cru-
cial to determining whether the product contains gluten. For some time in 
Canada and recently in the United States, it is the law that these labels indi-
cate if the product contains gluten.
As we mention earlier in this chapter in the section “Knowing what gluten-
free means,” similar to the situation with peanuts and other foods to which 

181
 Chapter 10: Treating Celiac Disease with a Gluten-Free Diet
one may be allergic, manufacturers who cannot guarantee that an item is 
entirely gluten-free must indicate this on the food label using phrases such as 
“Made on shared equipment used for wheat” or “Facility processes wheat.” 
That’s good. What’s bad is that foods that are intrinsically gluten-free must, 
nonetheless, have a food label that implies the manufacturer cannot guaran-
tee the absence of gluten if even the remotest chance exists that during their 
processing they may have become contaminated by some other gluten-
containing product. This is designed to ensure safety, but we think there is, 
at times, excess caution (perhaps for legal reasons) and that all this some-
times does is make it harder to shop. Indeed, many theoretical situations of 
gluten contamination during the manufacturing process in reality are highly 
unlikely to lead to a meaningful or significant level of gluten in the food product.
Here is a list of certain common, gluten-containing ingredients found in pre-
pared foods. Avoid foods with these ingredients:
 
✓ Barley malt, malt extract, malt syrup, and malt vinegar. These malt-
based products all contain gluten (in the form of hordein) as they are 
derived from barley.
 
✓ Soya sauce manufactured from wheat. Soya sauce made from non-
gluten-containing food sources is, however, permitted. More and more 
gluten-free labeled soya sauce brands are available; however, you will 
still come across soya sauce labels that don’t indicate whether or not 
the product contains gluten. In this case, you can contact the manufac-
turer of the particular brand to find out.
 
✓ Modified food starch if it is derived from wheat. Modified food starch 
made from corn, rice, potato, or tapioca is safe to consume. If the label 
simply says “starch” (rather than “modified food starch”), then that food 
starch is cornstarch and is allowed. Other sources of starches must be 
identified in North America.
 
✓ Brewer’s yeast. Brewer’s yeast is not gluten-free. Baker’s yeast and 
yeast extract are gluten-free and are permitted.
 
✓ Products that do not specify their content. Items such as packaged 
flavorings or seasonings may contain flour and other gluten-containing 
products such as malt or soya sauce and thus should be avoided. Spices 
and herbs on their own are naturally gluten-free and thus can be safely 
consumed.
Here are a few items that generate some controversy as to whether they are 
gluten-free or not:
 
✓ Maltodextrin. This can be derived from wheat and is most commonly 
seen in imported European food products. Safe dextrin sources include 
dextrose from corn and dextrans from corn or potato starch. However, 
even wheat maltodextrin is highly processed and purified and studies 
suggest gluten cannot be detected in such products.

182
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
 
✓ Wheat starch. This is used in European gluten-free products but is 
not considered gluten-free in North America because it is not certain 
whether all traces of wheat protein are removed during the processing 
of wheat starch.
For a complete listing of foods allowed and not allowed on a gluten-free diet 
including a detailed discussion of every ingredient and many food products, 
we advise you to read the Gluten-Free Diet by Shelley Case, BSc, RD. Be sure 
to read the revised and expanded edition published in October 2008 (see 
Appendix A).
Cooking Gluten-Free Food
Cooking gluten-free isn’t easy, but is very doable. Indeed, millions of families 
successfully do this every day. Here are key elements and some tips to help 
you succeed with gluten-free cooking:
 
✓ Almost all meat, poultry, fish, seafood, egg, vegetable, potato, and rice 
dishes can be made without adding any gluten-containing ingredients. 
(These foods don’t contain gluten and thus serve as an excellent founda-
tion from which to make a dish.)
 
✓ Avoid flour as a thickener and instead, substitute a gluten-free item such 
as cornstarch, tapioca starch or, when the dish calls for it, cream or 
butter. Although you may be tempted to use a can of mushroom soup as 
a thickener, avoid doing so unless the manufacturer specifically states 
on the food label that the soup is not thickened with flour; if the soup 
contains flour, as it typically does, then it contains gluten.
 
✓ Substitute gluten-free pasta for classical family favorites such as maca-
roni and cheese or lasagna.
 
✓ Leave out the croutons in salads and instead use nuts, sunflower seeds, 
or gluten-free croutons to add crunchy and tasty items.
 
✓ Make your own salad dressings using various oils and vinegars along 
with salt, pepper, mustard powder, and herbs. All these items are free of 
preservatives and are gluten-free.
 
✓ If a dish calls for breadcrumbs, omit them or substitute gluten-free 
crackers or bread crumbs.
 
✓ A nut-butter-sugar crust for a cheesecake base is a very tasty substitute 
for a graham cracker crust.
 
Using naturally gluten-free ingredients is the best way to create tasty, nutri-
tious and healthy meals.

 Chapter 10: Treating Celiac Disease with a Gluten-Free Diet
Baking your own gluten-free food 
As we discuss in this section, doing one’s own baking often presents the 
greatest challenge when it comes to cooking gluten-free. And trying to get 
around this by purchasing gluten-free baked goods is no mean feat either. 
Although more and more stores in North America are carrying gluten-free 
baking, these are not readily available in all parts of the continent and also, 
these goods are expensive.
 
You will likely find your baking challenges are, well, somewhat less challenging 
if you have at least one good cookbook on hand which is specifically written 
for people who, like yourself, want to prepare high quality, tasty, gluten-free 
baked foods.
Learning how to bake gluten-free cakes, quick breads, muffins, cookies, 
piecrusts, and squares is important for most families living with celiac dis-
ease. Mixes for various baked goods are available primarily from smaller 
companies that specialize in gluten-free products, but, as a sign of the 
times, Betty Crocker has just recently come out with a few gluten-free mixes 
for baked goods. As Sheila’s husband said, his mother, who founded the 
Canadian Celiac Association over 35 years ago and who died in 2002, would 
not believe how much more is now available for those with celiac disease!
Meal preparation tips from Sheila’s household
Sheila’s husband Peter has celiac disease, but 
neither Sheila nor their children do. As a result 
of being a celiac disease specialist and, more-
over, as a result of living with a family member 
with celiac disease, Sheila (and, of course, her 
husband) has discovered a number of strate-
gies that have made meal preparation a suc-
cess for her household:
 ✓ Most meals are based on fish, seafood, 
dairy products, poultry or meat, potatoes, 
rice, legumes, many other vegetables, 
fruits, nuts, dried fruits, and sorbets.
 ✓ Salad dressings are made from scratch 
while cheese sauces and gravies are made 
with gluten-free thickening agents.
 ✓ For the members of the family that do not 
have celiac disease, an item or two of 
gluten-containing food such as bread or 
another baked good is added per meal.
 ✓ Wherever possible, similar gluten-free 
items (biscuits, bread, or a sweet baked 
item) are brought out of the pantry or 
freezer for the celiac member of the family.
 ✓ About once a week, dinner is based on 
gluten-containing foods such as pasta 
or homemade pizza. In these instances, 
while Sheila and the kids have the gluten-
containing items, Peter has gluten-free pasta 
or pizza crust which is used as the base for 
the same gluten-free sauces or toppings that 
are being used by the rest of the family.

184
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
 
Note that gluten-free mixes and purchased gluten-free baked goods, though 
often very welcome time-savers, are generally more expensive than are made-
from-scratch gluten-free goods, and may not be as good as the homemade 
product.
If there was an Olympic medal for gluten-free cooking, it would surely go to 
the person who best masters the art of baking gluten-free bread. Successfully 
doing so makes climbing Everest look like a comparative walk in the park. 
(Well, okay, maybe not a walk in the park, but you get the point.) Bread relies 
on glutenin (as we discuss in Chapter 2, glutenin is a component of gluten) 
to give it the texture and other qualities, such as elasticity, that we learn 
to characterize as belonging to bread. Gluten-free breads are often dry and 
crumbly and need to be toasted to make them more palatable. Our patients 
with celiac disease routinely tell us that the number one item that ends up 
going in the garbage (or compost heap), whether homemade or purchased at 
a store, is bread.
Planning meals for the newly diagnosed
If you or a family member has just been diagnosed with celiac disease, you 
will likely find that getting started on a gluten-free diet can be a daunting task. 
Here are some strategies to help you get started with meal planning:
 
✓ Keep things simple and organized. After you’ve mastered the basics, 
allow yourself to move on to more complicated and more varied gluten-
free food shopping and meal preparation.
 
✓ Use the resources available to you. Your dietitian, local support groups, 
gluten-free cookbooks, reputable Web sites, and books (like ours!) can 
help you learn about where to find gluten-free foods and how to prepare 
them.
 
✓ Plan meals and snacks ahead of time. Make a shopping list before going 
to the store. Become familiar with stores that sell gluten-free items and 
learn to read labels.
 
✓ Start with a tried-and-true recipe. When baking, start with a simple 
gluten-free recipe which other people you know have already mastered.
 
If you are the parent of a child with celiac disease, once your child is old 
enough, be sure to involve him or her in the shopping and preparation of 
meals as we discuss in Chapter 14.

 Chapter 10: Treating Celiac Disease with a Gluten-Free Diet
Eating Out Gluten-Free
Eating out of the home presents special challenges for people living with 
celiac disease. Whether it’s going to a restaurant; attending a wedding, birth-
day party, or other family celebration; joining the gang at the annual office 
holiday party; or simply visiting friends or family, these situations create 
dilemmas and difficulties that you don’t encounter at home. In the following 
sections, we look at these challenges and provide helpful tips to assist you 
when you are in these situations. (In Chapter 14, we discuss the special chal-
lenges that the childhood and teenage years present.)
Eating in restaurants 
Eating gluten-free in restaurants, though not easy, is easier than it was only 
very recently. The reason is that more and more national chain restaurants 
are offering gluten-free foods on their menus. Most restaurants, however, do 
not provide this information so, just like when buying anything else, the old 
adage of “buyer beware” holds true here.
When it comes to successfully navigating restaurant foods, bear in mind the 
following:
 
✓ Avoid fast food. Fast food restaurants, which are often life-savers for 
busy families, are generally off limits for those with celiac disease. Sorry. 
The problem is that many of their staples including hamburgers, chicken 
nuggets, seasoned French fries, pizza, hotdogs, and the like, contain 
gluten.
 
✓ Pick the right restaurant. In general, restaurants that are more expen-
sive or are very small are more likely to be able to (and willing to) pre-
pare custom meals from scratch that are free of gluten.
 
✓ Look for high quality cuts of meat or fish. When navigating the menu, 
be aware that dishes prepared with high quality cuts of meat or fish, and 
that use ingredients such as cream, butter, and wine, are more likely to 
be gluten-free.
 
✓ Pay special attention to the side dishes. Even if you’ve ordered a 
gluten-free food item, an accompaniment such as a bread roll may 
contain gluten, even if the waiter assures you it does not! Sheila well 
remembers the time she and her family were in a restaurant and the 
“gluten-free” bread roll given to her husband was identical to the regular 
rolls given to the rest of the family. Geesh! (To be fair to restaurant staff, 
they may simply have insufficient training and as a result may not know 
what they don’t know. As we said earlier, it’s always best to follow the 
old adage about buyer — or, in this case, eater — beware.)

186
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
Here are some gluten-free foods to look for when scanning a restaurant menu 
for suitable foods (or about which you can ask a knowledgeable wait staff):
 
✓ Natural broths
 
✓ Cornstarch thickened gravies and sauces
 
✓ Vinaigrette salad dressings
 
✓ Gluten-free soya sauce
 
✓ Tortillas made from all-corn grain
 
✓ Desserts such as crème brûlée, sorbet, and sherbet. Ice cream is also 
okay as long as it is gluten-free.
 
Some traditional specialities such as gnocchi and matzoh balls may be avail-
able in gluten-free forms but you need to check with the restaurant that they 
do no contain wheat or other gluten-containing flours.
Just like bringing crayons and the like makes dining out with little ones 
immeasurably easier, so too will following some “heads up” tips make your 
gluten-free restaurant dining experience — with or without children — less 
stressful and, ultimately, more pleasant. When you’re dining out:
 
✓ Call ahead. Call ahead to ask questions and let the restaurant know of 
your needs.
 
✓ Avoid busy dining times. Avoid dining at the busiest times, especially 
on a first visit. That way, the wait staff will be able to provide you the 
extra time you may need to discuss your food needs with them.
 
✓ Explain your dietary restrictions. Explain your dietary restrictions to 
the staff. Some staff will be very knowledgeable (in which case the con-
versation will be brief), but others may need a more detailed explanation.
 
✓ Ask questions. Ask about what gluten-free items or meals the restau-
rant has on its menu. Ask how meals are prepared and how gluten-free 
the kitchen and food preparation areas are. In Appendix A, we discuss 
online resources that address issues associated with dining out and 
having celiac disease.
 
✓ Check about cross-contamination. Check into situations of possible 
cross-contamination wherein non-gluten-containing foods become con-
taminated with gluten-containing products. (We discuss this topic in 
detail in the section, “Dealing with Cross-Contamination.”)
 
✓ Use dining cards. If you encounter a language barrier as you try to 
explain your dietary needs, show wait staff dining cards which provide 
information about celiac disease dietary restrictions in a wide variety of 

187
 Chapter 10: Treating Celiac Disease with a Gluten-Free Diet
languages. Depending on the supplier of the cards, these are available 
in English, Thai, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Spanish, French, German, 
Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Greek, and even Swahili. These cards make it 
easier for you to order and eat a gluten-free meal in restaurants in many 
places around the world. There are quite a number of sources for these 
cards, which we list in Appendix A.
 
✓ Express appreciation. Make sure the staff know you are appreciative 
when their extra effort has helped you have a good experience. This can 
be in the form of a generous tip, a thank you note, or another token of 
appreciation. (We realize this point may have sounded kind of patron-
izing, but hey, the more that restaurant staff are rewarded for being 
gluten-savvy, the more likely that they will put in extra effort the next 
time that a person with celiac disease comes to dine. And we think that 
would be great!)
 
✓ Offer repeat business. Return to dining establishments where you have 
had an enjoyable gluten-free meal. Being a “frequent flyer” will likely 
help you get better service.
Traveling with celiac disease
Taking a flight presents its own special challenges. Airline meals (whether 
provided gratis or offered for sale) typically consist of a sandwich or other 
gluten-containing food. Even snacks can be off limits for those with celiac dis-
ease since fewer airlines pass out peanuts and instead offer gluten-containing 
pretzels, crackers, or cookies. For these reasons, we recommend you bring 
your own, gluten-free food with you. Also, any of you who have flown in 
recent years know your own food will likely taste better and cost less than 
what you’d get onboard.
One way of getting around the onboard eating dilemma is to eat a meal 
before you leave home. (We’d caution against you leaving home with the 
expectation you’ll be able to find gluten-free food at the airport. It will be a 
very unpleasant surprise if — as may well be the case — you get there only 
to find out that gluten-free food is not available.) Regardless of what strategy 
you employ, you need to plan ahead because ordering in food at 35,000 feet 
isn’t an option (at least, not as far as we’re aware).
 
Good gluten-free snacks to bring with you on your flight could include a dried 
fruit/nut mixture, pieces of fruit such as apples and oranges, gluten-free gra-
nola bars, and chunks of cheese and gluten-free crackers. Bear in mind that if 
you’re traveling to another country, bringing in certain foods such as fruit will 
be off limits.

188
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
Traveling by train can also present challenges because, depending on the 
train you take, the food selection available may be very limited. It is always 
safer to bring along a few gluten-free items like those we just discussed.
Car travel allows far more options because you can pack items in a cooler for 
longer trips and you can also stop to buy gluten-free food supplies along the 
way. Nonetheless, even here some advanced planning is needed since the 
average rest stop will, naturally enough, not have the gluten-free selection of 
a full grocery store and you may find yourself needing to take an unwanted 
detour off the highway to find a shopping area.
Visiting friends and family
If you were found to have celiac disease when you were very young, it’s likely 
that your friends and loved ones have become at least somewhat familiar 
with your special dietary needs and have learned to make some accommo-
dations for them (even if only to accept that you may opt to bring your own 
food to get-togethers). On the other hand, if you have only recently been 
diagnosed, your friends and relatives may not yet know this and, even if they 
do, like many people they may have minimal knowledge of celiac disease and 
even less knowledge of its dietary requirements.
 
Bill, a 30 year-old patient of Ian’s, shared with Ian the story of his visit to his 
grandmother the day after he had been diagnosed with celiac disease ten 
years earlier. She had lovingly and painstakingly prepared his favorite casse-
role; a dish now off limits for him because it contained gluten. Try as he might, 
Bill was unsuccessful at explaining to his grandmother why he couldn’t eat 
the food, and it was clear she felt hurt and disappointed. Over the next few 
months and after a number of further conversations, Bill’s grandmother did 
ultimately come to a firm grasp of the condition and was able to come up with 
new favorites for him. A few years thereafter, when Bill’s own son was diag-
nosed with celiac disease, Bill remembers marveling at the totally nonchalant 
way in which his grandmother greeted the news and whipped up an exquisite 
gluten-free dish in no time.
 
The best way of avoiding the potentially uncomfortable situation of having 
friends and family perplexed at your new eating needs is, in advance of a get-
together, to inform them of your new dietary requirements. You may even 
want to share your copy of this book with them (but remember to ask for it 
back!). Depending on your comfort with this, you may elect to do as some 
folks with celiac disease have done, and let friends and family know via the 
annual holiday letter of your or a family member’s new need for a special diet.

189
 Chapter 10: Treating Celiac Disease with a Gluten-Free Diet
You will likely discover that for smaller get-togethers, so long as you provide 
your host or hostess with some advance warning of your nutrition require-
ments, they will be pleased to do their best to accommodate. However, for 
larger events such as a wedding, it may not be possible to make changes to 
a menu. In this situation, bring along snacks or even eat in advance of going 
to such a social event where one cannot be assured of receiving gluten-free 
foods. (When Sheila was a medical student, it was not uncommon for her 
husband — who has celiac disease — to eat dinner in advance of going to 
a potluck dinner where gluten-containing pasta dishes would be served. It 
was also not uncommon for him to then eat a second meal if he discovered 
gluten-free foods were available at the dinner. Of course, he was able to eat a 
lot more calories in those days and not gain weight!)
 
Although you may feel it is impolite to refuse Aunt Lucinda’s famous trifle or 
Uncle Joe’s ultimate macaroni and cheese, if they contain gluten, refuse them 
you must. Hurt feelings are unpleasant, harming your health is worse. Just like 
Bill’s grandmother in the preceding anecdote, your friends and loved ones will 
gradually learn to deal with your dietary needs and will ultimately be perfectly 
accepting of them. Why? Because they are your friends and loved ones.
Planning for Emergencies
In the wake of Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, members of Gulf Coast 
celiac support groups had renewed awareness of the need to be prepared for 
such disasters. Everyone, whether or not having celiac disease, should have 
an emergency preparedness plan which includes having on hand bottled 
water, flashlights, candles, matches, compasses, blankets, a can opener, 
butane lighter, pocket knife, something with which to boil water, and non-
perishable foods.
If you have celiac disease, have the following (or similar) items available in 
the event that a hurricane or other disaster forces you to leave your home:
 
✓ Gluten-free protein and/or cereal bars
 
✓ Rice crackers
 
✓ Gluten-free snacks such as gluten-free chocolate bars
 
✓ Dried fruits
 
✓ Nuts
 
✓ Tinned foods
 
✓ Dried packets of gluten-free soups
 
✓ Sugar, tea, coffee, and powdered milk or coffee creamer

190
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
 
Eat the items in your cache before they get too old and replenish these goods 
as they are used up so if, heaven forbid, disaster strikes, you and your family 
are ready to make a hasty exit.
Dealing with Cross-Contamination
Cross-contamination, as it pertains to living gluten-free, refers to the process 
by which an item which should be gluten-free becomes contaminated with 
gluten during the processing or preparation of the food. Cross-contamination 
can occur in manufacturing plants, grocery stores, restaurants, and in the 
home. Because having celiac disease means you must be strictly gluten-free, 
cross-contamination is a very real concern.
These are examples of settings in which cross-contamination may occur:
 
✓ During food processing in manufacturing plants. As we discuss in 
Chapter 2, oats are often milled in plants where gluten-containing grains 
are also milled. This results in cross-contamination of the oats and 
means you mustn’t eat them. (If, however, the label says they are “pure 
oats” then it is alright to eat them.) We list various sources of pure oats 
in Appendix A.
 
✓ Stores with bulk food bins. It is easy to imagine how a bit of the con-
tents of, for example, the wheat flakes cereal bin makes its way into a bin 
of something that is supposed to be gluten free thanks to shared scoops, 
curious kids, and other things along those lines.
 
✓ Re-use of frying oil that was previously used to fry gluten-containing 
foods such as breaded or battered meats, French fries dusted in spiced 
flour, or doughnuts. This can be an issue at restaurants and in the home.
 
✓ Sharing knives. This can lead to breadcrumbs in jams, peanut butter, 
butter, spreads, and dips. It is best to have one serving knife (or other 
serving utensil) per food item that is placed on the table. This utensil 
can then be used to dish out the dollop of jam, butter, or whatever onto 
each person’s plate, not directly onto their toast, bread, crackers, and 
so on. From there each person can use his or her own, individual utensil to 
do the spreading. Not only does this prevent gluten cross-contamination, 
it is the more hygienic way to eat in any event.
 
✓ Using toasters and cutting boards for both gluten-containing foods 
and gluten-free foods. Toaster ovens are easier to clean and keep free 
of gluten-containing crumbs than the traditional upright toaster where 
crumbs collect at the bottom and can cling to the next bread slice. If 
your family elects to use an upright toaster, you may want to have a 
separate one for use by members of the family who have celiac disease.

191
 Chapter 10: Treating Celiac Disease with a Gluten-Free Diet
 
 If you are making homemade gluten-free burgers, toast the gluten-free 
buns before the ones with gluten. This will reduce the risk of cross-
contamination.
 
✓ Grilling surfaces. Grilling surfaces are likely to be used to prepare both 
gluten-containing and gluten-free foods. Therefore, after grilling a gluten-
containing product, be sure to clean the grill before cooking gluten-free 
food. (Also, try to grill the gluten-free food first in any event.)
 
Once a utensil or cutting board is properly washed, the risk of cross-
contamination with gluten disappears. Thus, there is no need for separate 
sets of dishes, cutlery, and other washable food preparation paraphernalia 
for different members of the family.
Sticking with a Gluten-Free Diet
If you have celiac disease, in order to maintain good health, it is essential that 
you follow a gluten-free diet. However, whether you are a kid at a birthday 
party or an adult in a fancy restaurant, it is human nature to want to taste a 
delicious (gluten-containing) cake or other treat that everyone else is oohing 
and aahing over. If you find yourself giving in to temptation (which, by the 
way, we recommend you don’t), don’t beat yourself up over it or dwell on it. 
Instead, the best way to handle a little dietary indiscretion is to get back with 
the (gluten-free) program as soon as possible.
When it comes to voluntarily straying from living gluten-free, we don’t like to 
call it cheating. Maybe it’s just us, but we find the word “cheating” to sound 
patronizing and besides, it tends to connote guilt, which isn’t a particularly 
helpful feeling anyhow. (Well maybe a tinge of guilt is helpful at times, but 
that’s about it.) We prefer to call falling off the gluten-free wagon straying 
from the diet.
Unlike many others with a chronic illness, if you have celiac disease, you are 
able to fully take control of, or “own” your disease. You don’t need medicines 
to control your celiac disease, you don’t need fancy technologies, gadgets 
or wizardry; you just need you. And that involves finding the wherewithal 
to avoid any and all gluten. It also involves recognizing that to err is to be 
human.
 
Living gluten-free is often facilitated and, ultimately, more likely to succeed if 
one is a member of a support or advocacy group, and if there is regular follow-
up with a dietitian. We recommend you do both. In Chapter 1, we discuss how 
to find a celiac disease support group.

192
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
Tracking Down Hidden Sources of Gluten
Through careful label reading and diligent homework you will almost always 
be able to determine which foods are gluten-free (and hence okay for you 
to eat) and which contain gluten (and thus need to be avoided). There are, 
however, sources of gluten other than what is found in food. It is important 
that you be aware of these so-called hidden sources of gluten lest you inad-
vertently consume them and trigger your celiac disease. We look at hidden 
sources of gluten in this section.
Checking the ingredients of 
prescription medications
One of the things Ian hears most often from readers of one of his other 
For Dummies books — Understanding Prescription Drugs For Canadians For 
Dummies — is that they are shocked to find out the number of different non-
medicinal ingredients present in their prescription drugs. Indeed, in addi-
tion to the actual medicine, drugs may contain one or more of many other 
ingredients including (but not limited to) lubricants, coatings, preservatives, 
dyes, sweeteners and, ready for this, gluten! (Gluten is used as a filler or as a 
vehicle to keep the active ingredient in suspension.)
You will not be able to tell from looking at a pill whether or not it contains 
gluten. If you’ve been provided with a package insert it may reveal this, but 
you’ll likely only see this after you’re home and long after you’ve already 
paid for the medicine. Your doctor is highly unlikely to know which company 
makes which drug with gluten. And your pharmacist may not know that you 
have celiac disease and so won’t know to not dispense a gluten-containing 
medicine to you. For all these reasons, the best thing to do is, any time you 
are having a prescription filled at the drug store, tell the pharmacist you have 
celiac disease and ask him to check whether the particular drug contains 
gluten. The pharmacists can look this up on the computer or, if necessary, 
can call the manufacturer on your behalf.
Verifying the ingredients of 
over-the-counter medications
As with prescription medications, over-the-counter drugs may also contain 
gluten. Making things even more difficult is that if you simply pick the pack-
age up off the shelf and leave the store, you will not have had the opportunity 
to have checked with the pharmacist whether the product contains gluten. 

193
 Chapter 10: Treating Celiac Disease with a Gluten-Free Diet
In addition, the pharmacist may not have access in their database to an over-
the-counter product’s ingredients. In these situations the best thing to do is, 
before you take even a single dose of the medicine, contact the manufacturer 
to find out if the drug contains gluten.
 
Some celiac disease support groups maintain databases about the gluten con-
tent of common medications, but bear in mind these may not be fully reliable. 
Other sources include the Ask a Pharmacist option on Web sites for certain 
retail pharmacies and other Web sites such as www.glutenfreedrugs.com. 
A longer list of Web sites with this information is included in Appendix A.
Knowing other sources of gluten 
We are commonly asked by our patients with celiac disease whether it is haz-
ardous for them to use gluten-containing skin creams and lotions. This misin-
formation is unfortunately commonly acquired from online sites. If you, too, 
have wondered about the safety of gluten-containing skin creams and lotions, 
then we can reassure you — as we do them — that using these products is 
perfectly safe. The only way gluten can cause intestinal damage is for it to be 
ingested; gluten applied to the skin or scalp or hair does not put you at risk. 
However, listed below are some real and potential sources of gluten which 
aren’t readily appreciated as problems:
 
✓ Bakeries. Occasionally, bakers who work with wheat flour may inadver-
tently ingest flour that has become airborne and comes to rest in their 
mouth and is then swallowed. If you are a baker with celiac disease, you 
may need to change to a different working environment or, at the very 
least, have your working environment modified.
 
✓ Communion wafers. Communion wafers typically contain gluten. 
Recognizing, however, that some parishioners must avoid gluten, certain 
manufacturers have developed gluten-free wafers. Nonetheless, in some 
more strict interpretations of the Eucharist, gluten-free alternatives are 
not always considered acceptable. As with many things religious, there 
is a range of interpretations on such matters. Some people with celiac 
disease just pass the plate or use a substitute that they bring with them. 
If you are unsure how to proceed, a consultation with your priest or min-
ister may be a good idea.
 
✓ Lipstick. The only cosmetic which might be a source of problems is 
gluten-containing lipstick because it is possible that some of the product 
could enter your digestive system. This is, however, seldom a problem 
since you are highly unlikely to ever ingest any sort of meaningful quan-
tity of this. If, however, you and your doctor discover that your celiac 
disease is not settling the way it should, consider your lipstick as a pos-
sible culprit. The only way that you may be able to determine whether 
your preferred lipstick contains gluten would be for you to contact the 
manufacturer.

194
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
 
✓ Postage stamps and envelope labels. Other sources of hidden gluten 
include some postage stamps and envelope labels. Use a sponge rather 
than your tongue to moisten such items.
 
✓ Play dough. Young children who put things in their mouth are at risk of 
gluten if they consume play dough made with wheat flour. Whether your 
child has celiac disease or not it is advisable to keep them away from 
using play dough until they are past this stage of life.

Exploring Other Nutritional 
Considerations
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at how celiac disease affects the state of your nutrition
▶ Carrying excess weight
▶ Examining lactose intolerance
▶ Eating gluten-free when you are a vegetarian
▶ Investigating other important nutritional considerations
Years ago, before much was known about celiac disease, affected people 
often became increasingly malnourished and, tragically, sometimes died 
as a result. This isn’t going to happen to you! Nowadays, with celiac disease 
being so much better understood and with excellent therapy now available in 
the form of modifying one’s diet, if you have celiac disease, you can be — and 
will be! — fully nourished and as a result, you can look forward to a healthy, 
active, full, productive, and long life.
As we discuss in Chapter 10 and throughout this book, the key to success-
fully living with celiac disease is following a gluten-free diet. In this chapter 
we look at additional nutritional issues that need to be considered.
Understanding Nutritional Deficiencies 
in Celiac Disease
If you are like many people with celiac disease, once your condition is diag-
nosed and successfully treated, you’ll probably look back and realize that 
your now-resolved symptoms had likely been with you for quite some time, 
perhaps years. Indeed, however long you think you’ve had celiac disease, 
you may actually have had it considerably longer because it can take years 
from the time that gluten first starts to inflame the bowel until the time that 
symptoms first develop. Nonetheless, during those early years — even in the 

196
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
absence of symptoms — your damaged intestine was likely already interfer-
ing with your ability to properly absorb nutrients into your body. This, in 
turn, may have made you deficient in these nutrients.
In discussing the implications of nutritional deficiencies, it’s helpful to first 
look at what are the types of nutrients that you need in the first place. This is 
the way in which most nutrients are categorized:
 
✓ Carbohydrates, fat, and protein are the major components of your diet. 
Of their various roles, carbohydrates and fat provide energy (calories), 
and protein provides nutrients to maintain and repair the body.
 
✓ Fluids are necessary to maintain hydration. (A human is 60 percent 
water after all.)
 
✓ Electrolytes include sodium, potassium, and chloride and are vital for 
proper functioning of the body’s cells, including those found in the ner-
vous system, heart, and muscles.
 
✓ Minerals include calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, selenium, zinc, 
and other elements. Minerals play a variety of important roles. Calcium, 
for example, is necessary to build and maintain bone strength and mass. 
Iron is required to make red blood cells. (See Chapter 7 for more on cal-
cium and iron.)
 
✓ Vitamins, also discussed in Chapter 7, are typically divided into two 
categories:
 
• Fat-soluble vitamins are A, D, E, and K.
 
• Water-soluble vitamins are all the rest including the large family of 
B vitamins, and vitamin C.
Malnutrition in celiac disease
Malnutrition is a general term for the condition in which the body is lacking 
sufficient nourishment. Most people with celiac disease ingest what should 
be adequate quantities of nutrients in the form of food and liquid; the prob-
lem is that these nutrients are not sufficiently absorbed into the body — a con-
dition called malabsorption. We discuss malabsorption in detail in Chapter 2.
If celiac disease is severe, it can lead to such marked damage to the small 
intestine that it results in profound malabsorption with dehydration, loss of 
muscle mass, and, in the case of children, a distended belly and skinny limbs. 
The severely affected child with celiac disease resembles youngsters without 
celiac disease from impoverished regions of the world. Fortunately, celiac 
disease rarely gets to this stage nowadays because doctors are more aware 
of the condition, look for it sooner than in the old days, and know how to suc-
cessfully treat it.

197
 Chapter 11: Exploring Other Nutritional Considerations
 
Although knowledge about celiac disease continues to grow in the medical 
community, it still isn’t always considered as soon as it should be. For this 
reason, if you or someone you care about has symptoms or other health prob-
lems that we discuss in this book, and if celiac disease hasn’t been consid-
ered, raise this possible diagnosis with your physician.
Looking at common nutritional challenges
As we discuss in Chapter 5, several forms of celiac disease exist, including 
the classical form in which the affected individual has, well, classical symp-
toms of this condition including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and, often, severe 
malnutrition. It is now known, however, that most people with celiac dis-
ease have the so-called atypical type in which symptoms are far less severe. 
Having less severe symptoms is, of course, good, but it can lead both patient 
and doctor alike to overlook nutrient deficiencies that can be present despite 
the small number of symptoms and a person’s healthy appearance.
 
Poor nutritional status is a concern for all people with celiac disease. Even fol-
lowing a gluten-free diet does not guarantee you are receiving all the nutrients 
you need.
Recent medical studies suggest that in treating celiac disease, too much 
emphasis has been placed on categorizing foods as “allowed” versus “not 
allowed,” and too little emphasis placed on looking at the nutritional quality 
of a person’s gluten-free diet. In particular, these studies have found evidence 
that many people with celiac disease who are following a gluten-free diet are 
not consuming enough of the following:
 
✓ Calcium (see the later section “Consuming calcium” and Chapter 7)
 
✓ Fiber (see the section “Figuring out fiber” and Chapter 15)
 
✓ Iron (see the section “Ironing out iron deficiency” and Chapter 7)
 
✓ Vitamin D (see Chapter 7)
Some studies have also suggested that people with celiac disease following a 
gluten-free diet tend to eat too much in the way of saturated fats.
Part of the reason the gluten-free diet can lead to nutritional deficiencies is 
that gluten-free foods are rarely fortified with (that is, contain added) iron, 
calcium, and other nutrients. These dietary deficiencies of a gluten-free diet 
can make it difficult to correct the deficit in nutrients that were caused by the 
untreated celiac disease in the first place.

198
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
 
If you’ve not had occasion to discuss with your dietitian your intake of cal-
cium, fiber, iron, vitamin D, and saturated fats, bring this up the next time you 
meet. Haven’t seen your dietitian in quite some time and no appointment 
booked? Well, stick a bookmark in this page (we’ll wait till you get back), grab 
the phone, and arrange one.
 
As we discuss in Chapters 14 and 17, some families elect to have everyone in 
the household follow a gluten-free diet even if only one person has the condi-
tion. If this is true of your situation, then be sure you ask your dietitian about 
whether or not the other members of your family are having their nutritional 
needs met. Children in particular have different requirements than do adults.
Ironing out iron deficiency
As we discuss in Chapter 7, many people with active celiac disease have iron 
deficiency due to malabsorption of this mineral. Once you’re on track with 
a gluten-free diet and your small intestine has healed, you will recover your 
ability to properly absorb iron into your body. Nonetheless, you may still find 
yourself being told by your doctor that your iron level (measured on a blood 
test) is low. The reason for this is that a gluten-free diet often contains insuf-
ficient iron. You need, therefore, to make a point of ensuring you’re diet is 
sufficiently rich in iron to meet your body’s needs.
Foods that can supply iron in your gluten-free diet include:
 
✓ Baked potato with skin
 
✓ Red meat
 
✓ Chicken and other poultry
 
✓ Fish such as salmon and tuna
 
✓ Legumes (lentils, kidney beans, chick peas)
 
✓ Seeds, especially pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds
 
✓ Shellfish (clams, oysters, mussels)
 
✓ Tofu
 
✓ Certain gluten-free grains (amaranth, buckwheat bran, quinoa, rice 
bran, teff)
 
✓ Some types of dried fruits (apricots, figs, raisins)
 
✓ Some nuts (cashews, almonds)
 
When choosing where you are going to get your nutritional iron needs meet, it’s 
important to consider that iron from plant foods is less bioavailable (that is, less 
easily absorbed into the body) than is iron from animal sources. Also, certain 
plant compounds such as phytates found in legumes and grains can inhibit iron 
absorption. You can, however, increase the amount of iron you absorb from 
plants sources. To do this, when you are eating plant sources of iron:

199
 Chapter 11: Exploring Other Nutritional Considerations
 
✓ Ingest vitamin C and other organic acids as found in oranges, bell 
peppers, and broccoli. These enhance plant iron absorption.
 
✓ Don’t ingest coffee, tea, calcium or fiber. These interfere with plant 
iron absorption.
 
If, despite following a gluten-free diet, ingesting sufficient quantities of iron 
rich foods, and, when necessary, taking iron supplements, your iron level 
doesn’t return to normal, then your physician needs to ensure your celiac 
disease isn’t still active (that is, still causing inflammation and damage to your 
small intestine). The first step in making this determination is typically to 
recheck your tissue transglutaminase IgA (TTG IgA) level. We discuss this test 
in detail in Chapter 3, and in Chapter 15 we look at the role of this test in moni-
toring your celiac disease.
Consuming calcium
Many people — whether they’re following a gluten-free diet or not — don’t 
consume sufficient amounts of calcium. This is especially challenging if you 
also follow a lactose-free diet (see “Lactose intolerance” later in this chapter) 
or a vegan diet as both these diets are intrinsically low in calcium.
These are the recommended daily amounts of calcium intake:
 
✓ For infants: 500 mg.
 
✓ For children: 800 mg.
 
✓ For adolescents and lactating mothers: 1,300 mg.
 
✓ For the average adult up to the age of 50: 1,000 mg.
 
✓ For adults over age 50: 1,200 mg.
These are gluten-free, calcium-rich foods:
 
✓ Milk products including milk, yogurt, ice cream, certain cheeses
 
✓ Tofu
 
✓ Canned salmon or sardines containing bones
 
✓ Dark green vegetables, dried beans
Calcium is also often added to foods such as some brands of orange juice, 
rice beverages, and soy beverages.
If you have lactose intolerance (which we discuss later in this chapter), you 
can still ingest these calcium-rich dairy products as they are (intrinsically) 
lactose-free:

200
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
 
✓ Yogurt
 
✓ Kiefer
 
✓ Other fermented milk products (sour milk, butter milk)
 
✓ Old or hard cheeses
 
The best-absorbed source of calcium in the diet is that found in dairy prod-
ucts. If you cannot consume any dairy products due to cows’ milk allergy, 
religious beliefs, or other reasons, getting enough calcium can be an extra 
challenge. There are, however, a number of non-dairy sources of calcium that 
you can include in your diet:
 
✓ Amaranth (75 mg, 1⁄4 cup)
 
✓ Blackstrap molasses (172 mg, 1 Tbsp)
 
✓ Bok choy (Chinese cabbage) (~175 mg, 1 cup cooked)
 
✓ Broccoli (79 mg, 1 cup cooked)
 
✓ Collard greens (239 mg, 1 cup cooked)
 
✓ Figs (137 mg, 5 figs)
 
✓ Kale (99 mg, 1 cup cooked)
 
✓ Mustard greens (109 mg, 1 cup cooked)
 
✓ Orange juice with calcium (333 mg, 1 cup)
 
✓ Salmon, pink with bones, canned (181 mg, 3 oz)
 
✓ Sesame tahini (128 mg, 2 Tbsp)
 
✓ Soybeans, green (edamame) (130 mg, 1⁄2 cup)
 
✓ Soymilk, fortified (100–159 mg, 1 cup)
 
✓ Teff, dry (82 mg, 1⁄2 cup)
 
✓ Tempeh (92 mg, 1⁄2 cup)
 
✓ Tofu, firm, calcium-set (137–230 mg, 1⁄2 cup)
Figuring out fiber
Over the past few decades, much has been discovered about the importance 
of consuming sufficient fiber. Not only does a fiber-rich diet help “keep one 
regular” (that is, helps prevent constipation), there is also strong scientific 
evidence that eating lots of fiber reduces the risk of developing a variety of 
diseases including heart disease and certain types of cancer.

 Chapter 11: Exploring Other Nutritional Considerations
Unfortunately, following a gluten-free diet makes it harder for you to get all 
the fiber you need. This is a result of the low fiber content of many gluten-
free flours and other gluten-free grain products. There are, however, excel-
lent ways of overcoming this hurdle by getting your fiber from other sources 
including:
 
✓ Rice products such as:
 
• Brown rice
 
• Rice bran
 
• Rice polish
 
• Wild rice
 
✓ Whole grain corn
 
✓ Non-gluten-containing grains such as:
 
• Amaranth
 
• Millet
 
• Quinoa
 
• Oat bran
 
• Teff
Other gluten-free healthy-eating tips
There are many other healthy ways you can add variety, fiber, and a whole 
host of nutrients including vitamins and minerals to your diet while at the 
same time avoiding gluten:
 
✓ Eat fruits or vegetables with every meal.
 
✓ Sprinkle nuts and seeds (sesame, poppy, sunflower, pumpkin) on salads, 
stir-fry dishes, cooked vegetables, and other dishes.
 
✓ Add dried fruits (raisins, currants, cranberries, cherries, apricots, 
apples), various fresh fruits, and berries of all kinds to cereal, salads, 
desserts, baking batter (pancakes, quick breads, muffins).
 
✓ Add flax seeds or flax seed powder to foods to increase the fiber 
content.
 
✓ Use brown rice or quinoa instead of white rice.
 
✓ Add legumes (like pinto beans, navy beans, black-eyed peas, kidney 
beans), cabbage, and cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower and broccoli) 
to your diet.

Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
Sorting out saturated fats
Saturated fat is the type of fat that comes from animal sources. Saturated fat 
is found in meat (for example, bacon or the marbling seen on steak), butter, 
and cream. (Unsaturated fat comes vegetable sources such as olive oil, canola 
oil, and margarine.)
The increased amounts of saturated fat in the diets of some people with 
celiac disease is explained by the tendency for individuals with this condition 
to eat relatively more meat and dairy products at meals because they cannot 
eat gluten-containing bread.
 
An incredibly handsome, very clever, athletic, and personable young man with 
celiac disease — we’ll arbitrarily call him Peter as in, ahem, Sheila’s husband, 
who, after reading this over-the-top description of himself, is hopefully going 
to be so flattered that he will promise to do the dishes for life — certainly 
demonstrated this over-reliance on saturated fat intake in days gone by. While 
the rest of the family was filling up on a single hamburger (with bun), Peter 
needed to eat two or more gluten-free hamburger patties (sans bun) in order 
to feel satiated. While Sheila and the kids would have a single sandwich for 
lunch, without benefit of bread to fill him up, Peter ate slice after slice of cold 
meat and cheese. Breakfast out of the home could be eggs, bacon or sausage, 
and fried potatoes instead of filling up on toast. As Peter got older, as a greater 
variety of tasty, gluten-free sources of fiber-rich and filling foods became avail-
able, and as he eventually succumbed to his loving wife’s, ah, gentle encour-
agement, he was able to successfully cut way back on his saturated food 
intake.
 
A gluten-free diet doesn’t have to be rich in saturated fats. Indeed, as we 
discuss in Chapter 10, a gluten-free diet can be very healthful because eating 
fresh foods instead of processed, packaged, or prepared foods is the best 
way to avoid ingesting gluten. Adding the extra nutritious foods listed in the 
preceding section to every meal is one way to keep the gluten-free diet more 
varied and minimize the tendency to rely on fatty (and sugar-laden) foods.
Here are some other ways you can reduce the saturated fat in your diet:
 
✓ Instead of bacon and eggs, serve gluten-free oatmeal or another gluten-
free cereal topped with fresh fruit, dried fruit, and/or nuts.
 
✓ Replace processed meat-containing sandwiches for lunch with a salad 
with cheese, nuts, unprocessed meat, and lots of chopped vegetables. 
Include gluten-free breads, breadsticks, biscuits, or crackers. 
 
✓ Rather than serving burgers, make a gluten-free noodle or pasta dish 
served with lots of vegetables.
In case you think these suggestions are just for show, they are actually based 
on what Sheila and Peter ate this Saturday — a Greek salad with tomatoes, 
cucumbers, black olives, and feta cheese at lunch, and a chicken Pad Thai 
with rice noodles, peanuts, red peppers, green beans, and cilantro for dinner.

Having gluten-free items on hand and the time to cook allows you to create 
healthy and tasty gluten-free meals.
Being Overweight and 
Having Celiac Disease
More than half of the people with celiac disease living in the United States are 
overweight at the time their condition is diagnosed. Even overweight people, 
however, may still be malnourished due either to poor eating habits leading 
to insufficient ingestion of important nutrients or, in the case of celiac dis-
ease, malabsorption of certain nutrients.
Whereas historically celiac disease was considered a childhood ailment, cur-
rently the average age at which someone is diagnosed is in their fifties. Since 
most North Americans get increasingly overweight as they age, this also 
applies to people with celiac disease.
Every person, whether they have celiac disease or not, should strive to be at 
a healthy weight. In Chapter 3,we discuss how you can determine if you are 
overweight (or underweight), and in Chapter 15 we look at helpful measures 
you can follow to achieve and maintain a healthy body weight whilst living 
gluten-free.
Celiac Disease and Lactose Intolerance
Lactose intolerance, a situation in which one cannot digest lactose, the sugar 
found in milk, is a very, very common condition whether one has or does not 
have celiac disease. Although lactose intolerance is seldom a serious prob-
lem, it can cause additional difficulties for people with celiac disease. Also, 
symptoms of lactose intolerance are often confused with symptoms of celiac 
disease. In this section we sort through these issues.
 
Lactose is a sugar (which is a form of carbohydrate) found in all mammalian 
milk (human, cow, sheep, goat, and so on). Lactose is also present in milk 
products such as ice cream, cheese, cream, and butter. Lactose is actually 
comprised of two smaller sugars (galactose and glucose) which are joined 
together. Lactose is not directly absorbed into the body, but rather must first 
be broken down into these two smaller sugars. This is accomplished with the 
aid of a special enzyme called lactase which is found on the inner surface of 
the small intestine in an area called the brush border (see Chapter 2 for more 
on the what the small intestine does.) If an individual lacks sufficient lactase, 
the result is that lactose is not properly broken down and absorbed into the 
body.

204
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
Who gets lactose intolerance?
It’s hard to truly consider lactose intolerance a disease or an abnormal condi-
tion since most of the world has this condition. Indeed, it affects the majority 
(over 85 percent) of people originating from Asia, Africa, the Mediterranean, 
and also native North and South Americans. Even in northern European pop-
ulations, lactose intolerance affects about 30 percent of the healthy popula-
tion. It is only relatively recently, with the advent of refrigerators (and hence 
the ability to consume dairy products such as milk, ice cream, and butter), 
that the issue of lactose intolerance has come into the fore.
 
Almost everyone in the world is born with normal intestinal levels of lactase. 
This is of tremendous importance since ideally a newborn’s nutrition comes 
from drinking breast milk, and without lactase an infant isn’t able to absorb 
the milk’s lactose. As people grow up the amount of lactase present in the 
intestine progressively declines eventually leading, in many people, to lactose 
intolerance. The reason for the decline is not known for certain, but prob-
ably lies in the evolutionary fact that, in pre-historic times, a child who had 
outgrown drinking breast milk would have had no need for lactase because 
the only other milk products available for consumption would have been fer-
mented milk products such as cheese and yogurt, in which bacteria did the 
work of digesting the lactose.
How lactose intolerance makes you feel
Symptoms of lactose intolerance include flatulence (that is, farting) and diar-
rhea. These arise because the lactose-intolerant person is unable to suffi-
ciently break down (and absorb) lactose in the small intestine, so the lactose 
travels to the large intestine where bacteria find it a tasty snack and munch 
on it, thereby turning it into gas and diarrhea-promoting substances. Oh joy. 
Fortunately, these symptoms are rarely severe and affected individuals typi-
cally learn to recognize which foods cause the problems and so avoid them.
 
Unlike celiac disease or a food allergy, it is important to note that lactose intol-
erance does not cause any lasting or even transient damage to the intestine.
Celiac disease and your lactase levels
As we mention earlier in this section, the amount of lactase in the small intes-
tine normally falls as one becomes an adult. Nonetheless, there is typically a 
sufficient level to keep most adults free or nearly free of symptoms of lactose 
intolerance. However, if you have celiac disease and your small intestine 
becomes damaged as a result, you are prone to having profoundly low levels 
of lactase. As a result, you may have symptoms not only from your celiac dis-
ease (see Chapter 6) but also from lactose intolerance.

205
 Chapter 11: Exploring Other Nutritional Considerations
As we discuss in more detail in Chapter 12, because temporary lactose intol-
erance is so common with newly diagnosed celiac disease, we recommend 
you follow a lactose-free diet for a minimum of a few weeks after you begin 
your gluten-free diet. Once you are on track with your gluten-free diet and 
your intestine heals, your lactase level will return to normal, you will regain 
the ability to digest lactose, and your symptoms from both conditions will 
go away. Well . . . with one exception: If you already had lactose intolerance 
before you developed celiac disease, you may still have it even after your 
celiac disease is treated and under control.
 
If despite adherence to a gluten-free diet you continue to have symptoms of 
abdominal bloating, flatulence, and diarrhea, let your doctor know. It could be 
that you have lactose intolerance. We discuss how to diagnose and treat this 
condition next.
Diagnosing lactose intolerance
Lactose intolerance in otherwise healthy individuals is typically easily 
recognized — both by people with the condition and by doctors — based 
on two findings:
 
✓ The rapid development of abdominal cramping, bloating, and diarrhea 
soon after drinking milk or a milkshake, eating ice cream, or consuming 
other lactose-containing products.
 
✓ Quick improvement in these symptoms once lactose-containing 
substances have been removed from the diet.
The diagnosis of lactose intolerance is often straightforward enough that an 
affected person can correctly identify it before he or she even sees a doctor. 
When a person has the typical features of lactose intolerance that we just 
described, no special diagnostic tests are needed.
In some situations, the diagnosis of lactose intolerance is less apparent and a 
doctor may request you have a special diagnostic procedure called a breath 
test. In this test, you drink a lactose-containing beverage, and your breath is 
then analyzed to see how much hydrogen gas it contains. If you have lactose 
intolerance, you have excess amounts of hydrogen gas. (As we discuss in the 
earlier section “How lactose intolerance makes you feel,” lactose intolerance 
leads to excess gas being produced in the large intestine. Some of this gas 
is absorbed from the colon into the body and is then present in the mouth 
where the breath test can measure it. Sure beats having a probe put, ah, else-
where, to obtain a direct measurement of the hydrogen content of the gas in 
your colon!)

206
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
 
If you are asked to perform the breath test, be sure to hang out near a toilet 
for a few hours after the test. If you have lactose intolerance, the extra lactose 
you consume during the test can act as a laxative.
If you have celiac disease, the main reason to have a breath test would be if, 
despite following a gluten-free diet, you continue to have symptoms such as 
abdominal bloating, cramps, and diarrhea, and the cause is unclear.
Treating lactose intolerance
You can treat your lactose intolerance in three ways:
 
✓ Take a lactase enzyme supplement immediately before ingesting a 
lactose-containing food. These are available as drops or pills which 
serve the same digestive role as naturally occurring lactase enzyme 
found in the healthy gut. This is the preferred option for most people.
 
✓ Avoid consuming any lactose-containing foods. This option is effective, 
but it can be very restricting.
 
✓ Consume milk products which, prior to sale, have been pre-treated 
so that they no longer contain lactose. This is also an effective option; 
however, these products are more expensive than simply adding your 
own lactase drops to a jug of milk at home.
Despite what many people (including many doctors) think, if you have lac-
tose intolerance, there are some dairy products you can consume. Since 
almost all aged (hard) cheeses, yogurts (unless, as is done only rarely, fresh 
milk has been added after pasteurization), sour milk, and buttermilk are natu-
rally lactose free, you can safely consume these.
 
Many manufacturers label their lactose-free products as, well, “lactose-free.” 
Also, the symbol “live and active culture” on yogurt denotes that the yogurt is 
lactose-free.
If you are seemingly intolerant of many or all milk products, it may be that 
you have a different form of sensitivity to dairy products than lactose intol-
erance or cows’ milk allergy. The long-chain triacylglycerol (a form of fat) 
content of whole milk and cream, as well as items made from these dairy 
products including butter, ice cream, cheese, and yogurt, may be a factor 
in perceived dairy intolerance in patients with functional GI disorders (dis-
cussed in Chapter 12) and other digestive conditions.
 
If you have celiac disease, you must avoid any and all gluten because consum-
ing even tiny amounts will damage your intestine. If, on the other hand, you 
have lactose intolerance or another form of milk intolerance, consuming milk 
products won’t damage your gut, but it will make you feel unwell.

207
 Chapter 11: Exploring Other Nutritional Considerations
Living Gluten-Free as a Vegetarian
A small but growing number of the North American population are vegetar-
ians; that is, they do not consume animal flesh whether it is meat, fowl, fish, 
or seafood. A subset of vegetarians are vegans, meaning that they avoid all 
animal products including eggs and dairy products.
As people who follow a vegetarian diet invariably know, there are a number 
of health benefits to this diet (compared to a non-vegetarian diet) including:
 
✓ Less consumption of saturated fat and cholesterol.
 
✓ Greater intake of fiber.
 
✓ Increased ingestion of the mineral magnesium.
 
✓ More ingestion of certain vitamins such as folic acid, vitamin C, and 
vitamin E.
 
✓ Greater intake of some antioxidants such as carotenoids. Antioxidants 
are substances that protect cells from damage caused by free radicals 
(compounds formed during the metabolism of oxygen in our bodies). 
Carotenoids are certain nutrients, like provitamin A and lycopene, that 
are found in yellow, orange, or red fruits and vegetables.
 
✓ Less likelihood of being overweight.
 
✓ Better blood cholesterol levels.
 
✓ Lower blood pressure.
 
✓ Less risk of heart disease.
Although there are health benefits to following a vegetarian diet, there are 
challenges as well:
 
✓ By avoiding meat, poultry, fish, and seafood, your diet is devoid of the 
major sources of protein, iron, zinc, omega-3-fatty acids, and vitamins A 
and B12.
 
✓ Eliminating eggs and milk products removes from your diet calcium and 
vitamin D in addition to other sources of dietary protein.
Despite these obstacles, with knowledge and care a nutritious, vegetarian, 
gluten-free diet is possible.
Earlier in this chapter, we look at sources of calcium and iron, many of which 
can be consumed by people following a vegetarian diet. See the sections 
“Consuming calcium” and “Ironing out iron deficiency” for details.

208
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
Since ingesting sufficient protein can be a problem for vegetarians, especially 
vegans, make sure you eat a variety of alternate protein sources such as nuts, 
legumes, and various soy products like tofu. Many gluten-free grains such 
as amaranth, buckwheat, millet, quinoa, sorghum, teff, and wild rice contain 
higher levels of protein than wheat. Quinoa is probably the best grain in this 
regard because it is considered a complete protein; that is, it contains ade-
quate levels of all essential amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.
Absorption of the mineral zinc is enhanced by ingesting animal protein and 
inhibited by consuming phyates, compounds found in legumes and whole 
grains. Because of this, it is recommended that vegetarians consume twice as 
much zinc as non-vegetarians. Non-animal sources of foods that are high in 
zinc include nuts, seeds, legumes, and various grains including wild rice.
Insufficient ingestion of vitamin B12 is only a problem for vegetarians who do 
not eat eggs or dairy products. Vegans must use either vitamin B12-fortified 
foods such as soymilk or take vitamin B12 supplements.
 
If you are following a vegetarian diet — especially the vegan form — we 
strongly encourage you to sit down and spend time with a dietitian. They can 
work closely with you to design a nutritious, gluten-free and vegetarian diet.
A list of Internet resources providing dietary information for vegetarians is 
included in Appendix A.

Are You Responding to Your 
Gluten-Free Diet? (And What 
to Do If You Aren’t)
In This Chapter
▶ Knowing whether your gluten-free diet is working
▶ Situations that keep your gluten-free diet from working
▶ Looking at other possible causes to explain why you aren’t responding to your diet
I
f you have very recently been diagnosed with celiac disease and you 
are now starting on your gluten-free diet, you’re probably wondering 
how long it will take for you to feel better, what symptoms will go away the 
fastest, and how long it will take for you to again feel one hundred percent 
(something which, if you’ve been ill for a long time, may be but a distant 
memory). In this chapter we look at these issues and also discuss what you 
should do if, despite following a gluten-free diet, things just aren’t coming 
around the way you expect.
 
To succeed with a gluten-free diet, you must know what is a gluten-free diet in 
the first place! We discuss this in detail in Chapter 10, but even if you’ve read 
and re-read that chapter, we cannot emphasize strongly enough the impor-
tance of you meeting with a skilled, celiac disease-savvy dietitian to receive 
expert advice on how to live gluten-free.
Knowing Whether Your Gluten-Free 
Diet Is Working
There are several ways in which you and your health care team can deter-
mine whether your gluten-free diet is working. You can keep a look out for 
symptoms, blood tests can be performed, and, in some cases, a repeat small 
intestine biopsy is performed. We look at these topics in this section.

210
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
 
Speaking of blood tests to monitor your response to a gluten-free diet: There 
are no rules regarding what tests you should have or how often you should 
have them. As we discuss in Chapter 15, the testing your doctor sends you for 
to monitor your celiac disease depends on your particular circumstances and 
your doctor’s best judgment. In general, though, the more the blood abnormali-
ties and the greater their severity prior to your beginning your diet, the more 
often you’re likely to need these tests rechecked after you begin your diet.
Surveying your symptoms
The best and easiest way for you to tell whether your gluten-free diet is work-
ing is for you to simply ask yourself, “How am I feeling?” If you are like most 
people with celiac disease, within a matter of weeks of starting a gluten-free 
diet, you’ll find yourself answering with a resounding, “A whole lot better.”
 
If you had celiac disease for a long time before it was discovered, and espe-
cially if you’ve been quite ill from it, it may take longer than usual for you to 
feel better.
Following are key symptoms you and your doctor can monitor to track your 
progress (we discuss these and other symptoms in detail in Chapter 6; in 
Chapter 15, we talk about monitoring celiac disease):
 
✓ Your general sense of well-being. This is often one of the very first 
things to improve.
 
✓ Your energy level. This tends to improve in tandem with your sense of 
well-being.
 
✓ Gastrointestinal symptoms. Your indigestions, bloating, flatulence, and 
diarrhea will likely start to ease within a few weeks.
 
Although monitoring how you’re responding to your gluten-free diet by keep-
ing tabs on these symptoms is very helpful, it’s important to remember that 
these and other symptoms also can be present due to conditions totally 
unrelated to celiac disease. For this reason, although doctors (including us) 
put great emphasis on learning about and following your symptoms to help 
gauge your response to your diet, if your symptoms persist, neither you nor 
your doctor should automatically assume the problem is your celiac disease. 
It could, in fact, be that you have some other condition altogether. In this situ-
ation, your doctor will need to send you for other investigations in order to 
determine what is amiss.

211
 Chapter 12: Are You Responding to Your Gluten-Free Diet?
Antibody blood tests
As we discuss in Chapter 3, the single most important blood test to help 
diagnose celiac disease is the tissue transglutaminase (TTG) IgA antibody. 
The TTG IgA antibody can also be used to monitor how your gut is healing. 
If checked a few months after you’ve been on your gluten-free diet, your TTG 
IgA antibody level should be lower in amount than before you started treat-
ment. (The antigliadin IgA antibody — which we also discuss in Chapter 3 — 
can also be used for this purpose but it less reliable so is not as often used.)
If you are IgA deficient (see Chapter 3 for more in-depth information), moni-
toring your response to your gluten-free diet by measuring your TTG IgA 
antibody level won’t be helpful because your body can’t make IgA in the first 
place. If this is the case, your doctor will use other means to monitor your 
progress, including other blood tests such as the IgG form of TTG antibody, 
a hemoglobin level to monitor for anemia (if you were anemic to begin with), 
or a vitamin D level if, prior to treatment, it was low. Sometimes, a follow-up 
endoscopy and small intestine biopsy are required.
 
If you’ve never had a small intestine biopsy performed that proved you have 
celiac disease, monitoring your response to your gluten-free diet by following 
your antibody tests becomes less reliable. It could be, in fact, that you don’t 
actually have celiac disease, and any positive antibody tests you’ve had (or 
continue to have) may be positive for reasons unrelated to celiac disease.
Other blood tests
If, when you were diagnosed with celiac disease, your doctor discovered you 
had a low hemoglobin level (that is, you were anemic) or were deficient in 
iron, vitamin D, calcium, or other nutrients, your physician can monitor your 
progress by checking these levels in your blood from time to time. As you 
follow your gluten-free diet, your bowel should be healing and regaining its 
ability to absorb these nutrients into your body; hence, your levels should 
gradually return to normal.
Once your blood chemistry levels are back to normal, if your doctor had pre-
viously advised you to take supplements (such as iron), he or she may now 
tell you to discontinue them. If so, it’s important to then have these levels 
rechecked a few months later to ensure they remain normal. If they’ve fallen 
again, it may indicate that your intestine is still damaged and unable to suf-
ficiently absorb nutrients into your body.
 
Vitamin D deficiency is so common in the general population (that is, in 
people without celiac disease or any other health problem) that many phy-
sicians and other health advocates recommend vitamin D supplements be 
taken routinely. This is especially so in middle-aged and older women who are 
also routinely advised to take supplemental calcium (to help preserve bone 

212
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
strength and mass). Therefore, if you are a woman in this age group and you 
have celiac disease and your doctor advises you that you can discontinue 
your vitamin D and calcium because your bowel has healed, ask if you should 
continue these nutrients anyway.
Another intestinal biopsy?
Many people with celiac disease never require a second endoscopy and small 
intestine biopsy. Rather, their response to their gluten-free diet can be moni-
tored using the blood tests we describe in the preceding sections. There are, 
however, certain circumstances when a repeat biopsy may be necessary; for 
example if you have:
 
✓ Persisting gastrointestinal symptoms (like abdominal cramps and diar-
rhea) despite following a gluten-free diet.
 
✓ Persisting, unexplained iron deficiency.
 
✓ The return of gastrointestinal symptoms or anemia yet no rise in your 
antibody levels. (If your antibody levels go up simultaneously with the 
redevelopment of symptoms or anemia, a repeat biopsy is not usually 
necessary because the likelihood that gluten has re-entered your diet 
is overwhelming. However, even then, your doctor may decide a repeat 
biopsy is in order, especially if you are quite ill.)
 
✓ The new development of weight loss, anemia, and/or severe diarrhea 
despite following a gluten-free diet. In this situation, an endoscopy and 
small intestine biopsy may help confirm these symptoms are due to 
celiac disease or, alternatively, may reveal some other, unrelated, gas-
trointestinal disorder.
 
✓ Celiac disease but you never had antibodies (such as the tissue trans-
glutaminase antibody) present that are typically seen with active celiac 
disease. In this case, your doctor cannot monitor your antibody levels to 
determine if your bowel is healing.
The persistently abnormal 
small intestine biopsy
Although it’s unlikely you will require a second endoscopy and small intes-
tine biopsy, if you do and it’s abnormal, that does not always mean you have 
active celiac disease. Basically, it depends on what types and degrees of 
abnormalities show up.

213
 Chapter 12: Are You Responding to Your Gluten-Free Diet?
If your repeat biopsy shows classical features of active celiac disease such 
as villous atrophy (explained in see Chapter 3), then it’s guaranteed you have 
active celiac disease. Conversely, if all the biopsy reveals is mild inflamma-
tion, then your celiac disease may, nonetheless, be well controlled. It can 
take years for these mild inflammatory changes (particularly an increased 
number of intraepithelial lymphocytes; see Chapter 3) to resolve; indeed, 
sometimes they never do.
 
If ever you have a repeat biopsy performed and you’re told it shows evidence 
of active celiac disease, discuss with your doctor what specific findings were 
found and how convincing was the evidence that you still have active celiac 
disease. A healthy conversation with your specialist about your results can’t 
hurt and may prove very enlightening; especially if it turns out that your 
biopsy results aren’t proof-positive that you have active celiac disease.
Although it is unknown why increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (a pos-
sible sign of ongoing inflammation) can still be found in biopsies of some 
patients who have been on a gluten-free diet for years, possible explanations 
include the following:
 
✓ Accidental ingestion of miniscule amounts of gluten (which could main-
tain ongoing, mild inflammation in the gut).
 
✓ A very slow-to-heal digestive system.
 
✓ Having some other condition that causes biopsy findings similar to 
celiac disease but occurs unrelated to gluten ingestion. For example, 
increased intraepithelial lymphocytes in the small intestine can some-
times result from anti-inflammatory medications or infections (such as 
that caused by the Helicobacter pylori bacteria).
Exploring Why Your Gluten-Free 
Diet May Not Be Working
In most cases, it is readily apparent if a person is succeeding with their 
gluten-free diet. A previously unwell person, newly diagnosed with celiac 
disease, is placed on a gluten-free diet and, within a matter of few weeks, 
is feeling much better. Soon thereafter, his blood tests are improving, and 
lickety-split, he’s on his way to restored good health. Simple as that. But what 
about the person who doesn’t quickly feel better, or whose lab tests don’t 
show improvement. Could it be that he isn’t responding to his gluten-free diet 
(that is, he has non-responsive celiac disease)?

214
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
The single most important clue to you and your doctor that you’re not suf-
ficiently responding to your gluten-free diet is if, despite carefully following 
your nutrition program, you’re not feeling any better or, especially, if you’re 
feeling worse. An additional, strong clue to your doctor that your gluten-free 
diet isn’t working the way it should is if your lab tests are not improving 
(refer to the preceding sections for information on follow-up tests).
 
Don’t wait months and months to get in touch with your doctor or dietitian 
if you feel that you’re not responding the way you should to your gluten-free 
diet. Your health care providers will want to know if the treatment isn’t work-
ing so that they can figure out why and get you feeling better! In this section, 
we look at the most common reasons why a gluten-free diet may not be work-
ing the way it should.
 
If you’re not responding to your gluten-free diet the way you should, take 
heart. There is always a reason, and once the reason is discovered and recti-
fied, you’ll be back on the road to recovery.
Continued gluten exposure
The most common reason for someone to fail to get better on a gluten-free 
diet is that that person isn’t on a gluten-free diet! This is typically due to one 
of three things:
 
✓ You’re unintentionally consuming gluten. Sometimes, despite your best 
efforts, you are still ingesting gluten-containing food. In this case, it’s a 
matter of sitting down with your doctor and dietitian and identifying the 
source. Other times, non-food sources of gluten are being inadvertently 
consumed. In Chapter 10, we look at these non-food sources of gluten, 
including certain medications and even lipstick.
 
✓ You know you’re consuming gluten and are aware that it can hurt you 
but, for whatever reason, you elect to ignore medical advice (oh yes, 
this does indeed happen; perhaps more often than you might think) and 
to carry on with your old diet.
 
✓ You (incorrectly) believe that “just a little bit of gluten won’t hurt” and 
therefore continue to ingest it.
 
If you aren’t responding to your diet and you recognize that you’re consuming 
gluten, do yourself a huge favor and stop. As long as you continue to ingest 
gluten, your bowel will not heal, and you’ll be at risk of progressive damage 
to your body. The only safe level of gluten that you may consume if you have 
celiac disease is none at all. Also, if you’ve been consuming gluten, let your 
doctor know; otherwise, your physician may end up asking you to perform all 
sorts of tests as he or she tries to discover why it is you’re not getting better.

 Chapter 12: Are You Responding to Your Gluten-Free Diet?
If you’re following a gluten-free diet, yet you’re not getting better, keep a 
detailed record of anything and everything that you’re ingesting (foods, 
liquids, medicines, and so on) and bring the record with you to an appoint-
ment with your dietitian. A celiac disease-savvy dietitian may well discover 
sources of gluten that are not readily apparent to you.
 
Don’t be too hard on yourself if and when you inadvertently eat something 
with gluten or even when you decide to taste just a tiny piece of a homemade 
gluten-containing baked treat. Just climb back on that horse (the gluten-free 
horse that is) and keep fighting to stay gluten-free. We certainly don’t advo-
cate consuming any gluten at all, but we also recognize that nobody is per-
fect. (Consuming even small amounts of gluten is unwise, but so long as the 
amount you’ve ingested is very small and so long as it happens only rarely, 
the odds are good that you and your bowel will be fine.)
Conditions complicating celiac disease
Another relatively common reason why people with celiac disease may 
remain unwell despite following a gluten-free diet is if they have some other, 
additional gastrointestinal ailment that causes similar symptoms to their 
celiac disease. We look at these in this section.
 
Even if you are found to have one of the conditions we discuss here, since 
you also have celiac disease you must continue, uninterrupted, on your 
gluten-free diet.
Lactose intolerance
As we discuss in detail in Chapter 11, lactose intolerance is a very, very 
common condition in which an individual lacks sufficient lactase enzyme to 
properly digest lactose (the sugar found in milk products) and as a result may 
experience gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as abdominal cramps, flatu-
lence, and diarrhea.
Because lactose intolerance is so common in most population groups, there 
are going to be lots and lots of people with celiac disease who also have this 
condition. Indeed, it may well be that before you were diagnosed with celiac 
disease, you were already known to have lactose intolerance. In that case, after 
you’ve been diagnosed with celiac disease, you will need to continue with your 
lactose-free diet (with or without the use of lactase supplements). Otherwise, 
even if you’re following a gluten-free diet, you will have GI symptoms.
If your bowel was quite inflamed before you started your gluten-free diet, you 
may develop temporary lactose intolerance due to transient loss of normal 
levels of lactase. As a result, you may have GI symptoms from both your 

216
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
celiac disease and from your lactose intolerance. These may be indistinguish-
able from one another. Because this temporary lactose intolerance is so 
common with newly diagnosed celiac disease, you should follow a lactose-
free diet for a minimum of a few weeks after you begin your gluten-free diet. 
At that point, although your bowel won’t be completely healed, it will have 
sufficiently replenished its quantity of lactase that you can resume ingestion 
of lactose-containing products.
Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)
Microorganisms (such as bacteria) — also known as microbes — live within 
much of our digestive tract. The number of microbes present increases as 
one moves (figuratively speaking) from the upper small intestine to the end 
of the large intestine. As many as 100 trillion microbes per 1 milliliter of fluid 
are within the lower part of the large intestine. How many is a trillion? Well, 
written out it’s 100,000,000,000,000! Can you imagine that many bugs living 
in a space that is 1⁄5 of a teaspoon of liquid? Yuk! No wonder Mom and Dad 
taught you to wash your hands after going to the bathroom!
Although much remains to be discovered regarding the role (or roles) that 
gut bacteria play in maintaining human health, it is known that they are 
essential in helping normal digestion proceed. If, however, there are excess 
numbers of bacteria in the small intestine — a condition called small intesti-
nal bacterial overgrowth (or SIBO for short) — the bacteria can damage the 
lining of the small intestine leading to malabsorption of fat, protein, carbohy-
drates (including lactose), and other nutrients which, in turn, causes symp-
toms such as diarrhea. (We discuss malabsorption in Chapter 6.)
Many diseases can be associated with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth 
including, importantly, celiac disease. Therefore, if you continue to have GI 
symptoms such as diarrhea despite following a gluten-free diet, SIBO is some-
thing your doctor needs to consider.
SIBO is diagnosed using sophisticated tests including those that measure 
the amounts of certain molecules in your breath, and, looking in the other 
direction, other tests that measure the amounts of certain molecules in your 
stool. Because these tests are difficult to perform, are not always available, 
and are not always reliable, if your doctor believes you may have SIBO, she 
may elect to simply treat you based on her suspicion you have it. The treat-
ment typically consists of a 7- to 10-day course of an antibiotic and then using 
probiotics (see Chapter 13) or eating natural yogurt after the antibiotics are 
completed with the goal of increasing levels of more helpful bacteria such as 
lactobacillus.
Pancreatic insufficiency
As we discuss in Chapter 3, the pancreas is very important in digestion 
because it makes enzymes that travel down into the gut and assist with the 
breakdown of nutrients into small molecules that can then be absorbed into 
the body. This is called the pancreas’ exocrine function. (The pancreas’s 

217
 Chapter 12: Are You Responding to Your Gluten-Free Diet?
other function, referred to as its endocrine function, is to make insulin and 
other hormones that help regulate blood glucose levels.)
For unclear reasons, the pancreas’s exocrine function becomes impaired (a 
condition called pancreatic insufficiency) in the occasional person with celiac 
disease and, as a result, that person develops malabsorption. Symptoms 
include bloating, flatulence, diarrhea, and weight loss. Because these symp-
toms are often also seen with celiac disease, your doctor may not necessarily 
consider pancreatic insufficiency as a cause of your symptoms . . . in which 
case we’re thrilled you’re reading this section! Because now that you’ve read 
this, should your GI symptoms not be responding to a carefully followed 
gluten-free diet, you can bring the possible diagnosis of pancreatic insuf-
ficiency to your doctor’s attention. (If — perish the thought — your doctor 
takes exception to your doing this, as always, feel free to blame us for putting 
you up to the job!)
Because there are no particularly good ways of testing for pancreatic insuf-
ficiency and because therapy is safe and simple, most physicians treat sus-
pected cases on speculation (what doctors call empirical therapy). Treatment 
consists of taking, in pill form, the enzymes that the pancreas normally 
makes. We admit this isn’t the most scientific process in the world, but some-
times a quick-and-dirty approach is the best.
 
Wendy had persistent complaints of loose stools and upper abdominal dis-
comfort in spite of being on a strict gluten-free diet for two years. Her regular 
gastroenterologist suggested a lactose-free diet with lactase supplements. 
This helped, but not completely. Wendy was then referred to Sheila to find 
out why her symptoms weren’t responding. Wendy’s subsequent blood 
tests, including TTG IgA antibody (which had been mildly elevated to start 
with), were normal. Sheila’s dietitian colleague, Nora, was certain Wendy 
was living completely gluten-free. Sheila organized an endoscopy and small 
bowel biopsy, and these were normal. She then prescribed pancreatic enzyme 
supplements and, lo and behold, just a few weeks later Wendy called Sheila to 
let her know that, since starting the enzyme supplements, her symptoms had 
entirely gone away.
Microscopic colitis
Microscopic colitis is an autoimmune disease in which a special type of inflam-
matory cell — called a lymphocyte — accumulates within the lining of the 
large intestine (the colon). There are two types of microscopic colitis: lym-
phocytic colitis and collagenous colitis. If you happen to spend some time on 
the Internet reading about the nuances of these conditions and you find your-
self feeling confused, then take some comfort with the knowledge that most 
every doctor and med student is also confused by this puzzling condition.

218
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
People with celiac disease, for unknown reasons, are more prone to micro-
scopic colitis. The most common symptom is severe, watery diarrhea, typi-
cally far worse than the diarrhea that may occur with celiac disease. The 
condition is diagnosed by obtaining a biopsy of the colon (this is done when 
a colonoscopy is performed; in this procedure, a flexible tube is placed 
through the anus into the large bowel).
Intriguingly (well, at least to docs like us), the large intestine biopsy in lym-
phocytic colitis shows increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (see 
Chapter 3) which is the same feature that is seen in small intestine biopsies 
in active celiac disease. This hints at some common connection between the 
two conditions, but what, precisely, the connection may be is unknown.
For unclear reasons, ingesting gluten can sometimes promote or exacerbate 
the symptoms of microscopic colitis. As you therefore may expect, in this 
situation treatment includes following a gluten-free diet. This diet, of course, 
also treats the celiac disease.
 
There is some scientific evidence that taking ASA (Aspirin and many other 
brands), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as Motrin and many 
other brands), or certain other medications either causes or, at least, aggra-
vates microscopic colitis so your doctor will likely advise you to withdraw 
these medications if possible.
If following a gluten-free diet and stopping any offending drug aren’t sufficient 
to control your microscopic colitis, you then need other therapy. Options 
include prescription drugs such as mesalamine, prednisone or budesonide; 
and over-the-counter bismuth-containing products like Pepto-Bismol.
Gastroparesis
Gastroparesis is a condition in which the stomach takes overly long to empty 
its contents into the small intestine. Although gastroparesis can affect people 
with celiac disease (hence the reason we discuss this condition), fortunately, 
this seldom happens.
The most common symptoms of gastroparesis are
 
✓ Early satiety (that is, feeling full far sooner than normal during a meal)
 
✓ Upper abdominal bloating or discomfort
 
✓ Nausea
As these symptoms can also be seen with celiac disease, on occasion the two 
conditions may be confused.

219
 Chapter 12: Are You Responding to Your Gluten-Free Diet?
Gastroparesis is diagnosed by a special nuclear medicine test called a gastric 
emptying scan in which you ingest a piece of food (usually an egg sandwich) 
into which a tiny amount of radioactivity has been placed. Pictures are then 
taken of your abdomen to see how long it takes for the food to pass from 
your stomach into your small intestine.
If you have gastroparesis due to celiac disease, following a gluten-free diet 
typically helps both conditions and, indeed, your gastroparesis may entirely 
resolve. If, however, this doesn’t happen, prescription medicines are avail-
able to help your stomach work better.
Conditions coexisting with celiac disease
Having celiac disease does not, of course, mean that you cannot have other, 
unrelated, diseases including other gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Indeed, if 
you have celiac disease, you remain as prone to GI conditions unrelated to 
celiac disease as does anyone else. Therefore, if despite carefully following a 
gluten-free diet, you find yourself having ongoing GI symptoms, you and your 
doctor should not automatically blame it all on your celiac disease. Rather, 
the two of you need to consider that you may also have another, coincidental, 
GI problem.
These are the three most important coincidental GI ailments to be 
considered:
 
✓ Gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which stom-
ach acid travels up into your esophagus and causes heartburn. We dis-
cuss this condition in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Functional dyspepsia (also called non-ulcer dyspepsia) is a condition 
in which you experience persisting or recurring pain or discomfort cen-
tered in the upper abdomen despite the absence of “structural” (that is, 
physically apparent) diseases like ulcers of the stomach or duodenum, 
stomach inflammation (gastritis), stomach cancer, and so on. Symptoms 
may also include nausea, feeling full overly quickly as you eat, and/or 
feeling bloated after finishing a meal.
 
✓ Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a condition with variable features, 
but most commonly involving recurring abdominal pain or discomfort 
that improves with having a bowel movement. Affected people also typi-
cally notice a change in the frequency or the appearance of their bowel 
movements (for example, their stools may become long and skinny like 
licorice). Some people with IBS have problems with constipation and 
bloating, while others have diarrhea and urgency where they need to 
find a bathroom ASAP. Although IBS is not serious, for some people it 
can be one big nuisance.

220
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
 
Because conditions like functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome 
can cause symptoms similar to those seen with celiac disease, some people 
who have not been diagnosed with celiac disease mistakenly ascribe their 
symptoms to celiac disease and initiate a gluten-free diet without first having 
these other conditions looked for and without having been tested for celiac 
disease. As a result, the wrong (self-) diagnosis may be made and the wrong 
(self-) treatment given. If you find yourself in this situation, we strongly recom-
mend you see your doctor to be properly evaluated.
 
If you have not been diagnosed with celiac disease, yet you find yourself 
feeling better after starting yourself on a gluten-free diet, don’t take this as 
evidence that you have this ailment. In fact, a recent study showed that only 
one-third of people in this situation actually had celiac disease. The other two-
thirds of the group were using a rather restrictive diet to treat conditions that 
should have been treated in other ways. Remember: The only way to be defini-
tively diagnosed with celiac disease is to first have a small intestine biopsy. 
(Hmm, is that the fiftieth or fifty-first time we’ve mentioned this? Think we’re 
being nags here? Oh well, if it helps keep people healthy, we can live with the 
label.) Go to Chapter 3 for more on how celiac disease is diagnosed.
Wrong diagnosis
You and your doctor should question the diagnosis of celiac disease when 
there is little or no improvement on your gluten-free diet. As we discuss in 
Chapter 3, it is not so rare that a diagnosis of celiac disease is made, for a 
variety of reasons, in someone in whom the condition isn’t actually present.
Following are some of the most common conditions that are mistakenly diag-
nosed as celiac disease (when, in fact, they are entirely different ailments):
 
✓ Irritable bowel syndrome. We discuss this condition in the preceding 
section.
 
✓ Functional dyspepsia. We discuss this condition in the preceding 
section.
 
✓ Other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID). This is a large group 
of conditions that include IBS, functional dyspepsia, and other problems 
which can either co-exist with celiac disease or be mistakenly labeled as 
celiac disease. (For further information on FGID see www.iffgd.org or 
www.theromefoundation.org.)
 
✓ Inflammatory bowel disease. This includes ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s 
disease. These are ailments, of unknown cause, where the intestine 
becomes inflamed and people experience abdominal pain and diarrhea. 
For further information about these conditions, see www.ccfa.org or 
www.ccfc.ca.

221
 Chapter 12: Are You Responding to Your Gluten-Free Diet?
The number of other, less common or even rare conditions that can be mis-
diagnosed as celiac disease is lengthy, and stretches from immune diseases 
(such as common variable immunodeficiency) to other forms of bowel disease 
(such as eosinophilic gastroenteritis) to other forms of food intolerance, and 
the list goes on (and on and on and . . .). There’s no need, however, to look 
for these other, rare birds unless more common conditions, such as those in 
the preceding list, have first been excluded.
The overall approach if you are not 
responding to your gluten-free diet
If your celiac disease symptoms are not improving despite following a gluten-
free diet for at least a few weeks, we recommend you follow this step-wise 
approach:
 
1. Meet with your dietitian to review your diet in detail to ensure you 
are not inadvertently (or even intentionally) consuming gluten; if 
there is no evidence that you’re ingesting gluten, move on to Step 2.
 
2. Remove all lactose from your diet (if you haven’t already done so). If 
this has not helped within a few weeks, then go to Step 3.
 
3. Speak to your celiac disease specialist about the possibility you may 
also have a complicating condition. If this isn’t the case, proceed to 
Step 4.
 
 Complicating conditions included small intestinal bacterial overgrowth 
or pancreatic insufficiency. See the earlier section “Conditions compli-
cating celiac disease” for a more complete list.
 
4. Speak to your specialist about the possibility you may also have an 
unrelated, coexisting condition. If this isn’t the case, move to Step 5.
 
 Coexisting conditions include functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syn-
drome, and others discussed in the earlier section “Conditions coexist-
ing with celiac disease.”
 
5. Speak to your specialist about the possibility that the diagnosis of 
celiac disease is inaccurate and that you have some other ailment 
altogether.
 
 There’s no harm in raising this possibility at any time; you don’t have to 
wait until this step to bring this up with your doctor.
 
If your doctor elects to treat you for conditions in the preceding list, we recom-
mend you be treated for only one condition at a time; otherwise, neither you 
nor your doctor will know which treatment was working for what condition.

222
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
When Your Celiac Disease 
Won’t Settle Down
Though it is not at all likely, it is possible that you will not improve despite 
having gone though all of the steps we discuss earlier in this chapter. You’ve 
reviewed with your dietitian every morsel that enters your mouth and nary 
a spec of gluten is to be found; you and your doctor have either excluded or 
have sufficiently treated any complicating or coexisting condition; the diag-
nosis of celiac disease has been convincingly made; but, well, you’re just not 
feeling the way you should. What then? In this section we look at two impor-
tant causes of non-responsive celiac disease that you and your doctor need 
to consider.
Refractory celiac disease
Refractory celiac disease (RCD) is a rare condition in which a person’s celiac 
disease doesn’t settle despite meticulously following a gluten-free diet for at 
least one year. These are two additional features that need to be present in 
order for the diagnosis to be made:
 
✓ Repeated small intestine biopsies must show persisting abnormalities of 
celiac disease. We discuss these in Chapter 3.
 
✓ All other causes of persistent gastrointestinal symptoms need to be 
excluded.
Some people have RCD from the get-go — that is, from the time they are first 
diagnosed with celiac disease. Other people who develop RCD had initially 
responded to treatment, but as time passed, they redeveloped symptoms 
which wouldn’t go away.
 
The underlying mechanism involved with refractory celiac disease is not fully 
sorted out but is likely related to chronic stimulation of the immune system. 
It is as if the immune system has gotten so chronically over-stimulated that 
it simply won’t shut off. As part of this process, special types of white blood 
cells called T lymphocytes can transform so that they first become prone to 
developing cancer (that is, these lymphocytes becomes precancerous) then 
may subsequently become frankly cancerous. We discuss this rare type of 
cancer, a form of immune system malignancy (lymphoma) called EATCL, in the 
next section and, in more detail, in Chapter 9.

223
 Chapter 12: Are You Responding to Your Gluten-Free Diet?
Who is at increased risk of refractory celiac disease?
Not every person with celiac disease is at equal risk for developing refractory 
celiac disease. Refractory celiac disease is most likely to occur in
 
✓ The elderly
 
✓ People in whom the diagnosis of celiac disease is very delayed
 
✓ Individuals with known celiac disease who, nonetheless, elect to con-
tinue a gluten-containing diet year after year
 
✓ Adults who were diagnosed with celiac disease when they were chil-
dren, but were subsequently told they had “outgrown it” and thus 
resumed consuming gluten. (Sadly, often these patients present later in 
life with complications of untreated celiac disease.)
How is refractory celiac disease monitored?
If you have refractory celiac disease, your specialist will monitor you very 
closely. They will keep a special eye out for evidence of complications from 
the condition including ulcers of the small intestine and enlarged lymph 
nodes (lymph glands), the latter being a possible sign of lymphoma.
You will likely also be sent for tests that allow for an examination of that long 
portion of the small intestine that lies beyond the reach of a regular endo-
scope. These tests include barium x-rays and capsule endoscopy. We review 
these tests in Chapter 9.
 
If you have refractory celiac disease your doctor may mention to you that you 
have either the type I or type II variety. Cancer is rare with either, but of the 
two cancer is more likely to occur with the type II variety and hence if you 
have this form you will be especially closely monitored for the development of 
cancer.
How is refractory celiac disease treated?
There are many different treatment options for RCD including using potent 
drugs like corticosteroids which suppress the immune system, and providing 
supplemental nutrition administered either via a feeding tube (inserted into 
the stomach) or given through an intravenous.
Despite these measures, people with refractory celiac disease remain at 
increased risk of death from infection, malnutrition, and certain types of 
cancer, especially EATCL (which we discuss next).
 
Given the seriousness and rarity of refractory celiac disease, it is usually best 
managed by a specialist who has specific expertise in celiac disease and has 
access to highly sophisticated resources such as is most commonly found in 
university-based, teaching hospitals. We list such centers in Appendix B.

224
Part III: Treating Celiac Disease 
Lest we’ve created undue concern, before we leave this section, we’ll reiter-
ate that refractory celiac disease is a rare disease so you’ll be highly unlikely 
to ever get it. And, even then, the odds of it progressing to the point of trig-
gering a cancer are very low indeed.
Enteropathy-associated T cell 
lymphoma (EATCL)
As we discuss in detail in Chapter 9, enteropathy-associated T cell lym-
phoma (EATCL) is a rare form of cancer that starts in the immune system 
cells located in the small intestine. EATCL is more likely to occur if you have 
refractory celiac disease (see the immediately preceding section). Symptoms 
of EATCL include malaise, loss of appetite, weight loss, worsening diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, and fevers.
 
If you have these symptoms, you must see your physician as soon as possible. 
When your doctor examines you for suspected EATCL, he or she may find 
enlarged lymph glands, a skin rash, an enlarged liver, or an abdominal mass. 
Investigations typically include special x-rays (such as CT scans) of the chest 
and abdomen, and GI endoscopy (see Chapter 3). Treatment may include che-
motherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery.

Alternate and Complementary 
Therapies
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at how non-traditional treatments may help celiac disease
▶ Examining whether alternative and complementary therapies are beneficial
▶ Treating celiac disease by eliminating foods other than gluten from your diet
▶ Discussing whether gluten-free diets help people without celiac disease
A
s we explain in Chapter 10, the mainstay of therapy for celiac disease 
is to follow a gluten-free diet. This has been — hang on to your hats — 
unequivocally, definitively, absolutely, and convincingly proven to effectively 
control the condition. (Not that we’re adamant about this point or anything!) 
Nonetheless, given the restrictions that a gluten-free diet imposes, many 
people with celiac disease understandably wonder whether other treatment 
option may be available, including complementary and alternative therapies. 
We discuss these in this chapter. And, because some people living with celiac 
disease consider following non-traditional (though gluten-free diets), we also 
discuss this topic here.
 
Complementary and alternate medicine (CAM) refers to a group of diverse 
medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not gener-
ally considered a part of conventional medicine. Similarly, complementary and 
alternative medicines (CAMs) are therapies provided by CAM practitioners. 
CAMs include certain herbs, vitamins (often in high dose), minerals, amino 
acids, and dietary supplements.
It is estimated that Americans spend roughly $34 billion a year out-of-pocket 
on complementary and alternative therapies. In this chapter we look at 
whether CAMs may be helpful to you in the management of your celiac dis-
ease, whether they are safe to use, and whether they are a good use of your 
hard-earned dollars.

228
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Important Safety Info about 
Complementary and 
Alternative Medicines
A frequent appeal of complementary and alternative medicines is that they 
are typically considered to be “natural.” And, true enough, CAMs are found in 
nature rather than being created in a laboratory. It is essential, however, that 
you not automatically equate “natural” with necessarily meaning “healthy” or 
“good.” After all, poison ivy, poison mushrooms, lead, arsenic, mercury, and 
a host of other potentially toxic products are also natural. Whether dealing 
with a prescription drug or a CAM, safety is always paramount.
 
Before you start taking complementary and alternative medicines, you should 
be aware of these important safety considerations:
 
✓ If you have celiac disease and you choose to use an alternative or 
complementary medicine, make sure that it is gluten-free. This may 
be very difficult to determine because the label will probably not pro-
vide this information and reaching the manufacturer — particularly 
when the manufacturer is overseas — may be difficult, if not impossible. 
Furthermore, the manufacturer may simply not be aware of this informa-
tion one way or the other.
 
✓ CAMs are not subject to the same legislative regulations or scrutiny as 
are prescription drugs. For this reason, knowing if a CAM is safe to take 
is harder to determine.
 
✓ CAMs that have similar labeling may nonetheless vary considerably 
in their potency. In other words, you may think you’re purchasing the 
same strength product time-after-time whereas what you’re actually get-
ting may differ significantly.
 
✓ Certain CAMs can lead to a dangerous increase in potency of some 
prescription drugs. For example, garlic can increase the potency of a 
strong anticoagulant (blood thinner) called warfarin, potentially leading 
to dangerous bleeding.
 
✓ Some CAMs can lead to a dangerous decrease in potency of some pre-
scription drugs. For example, Coenzyme Q10 can decrease the potency 
of warfarin, leading to dangerous blood clotting.
 
✓ Certain CAMs can alter the amount of a prescription medicine in the 
blood. For example, St. John’s wort can cause the blood level of a potent 
heart drug called digoxin to fall, which could result in a worsening of 
your heart condition.

229
 Chapter 13: Alternate and Complementary Therapies
 
✓ CAMs themselves often contain many different ingredients. Knowing 
how these interact with each other can be very difficult or even impos-
sible to determine.
 
Just as with prescription drugs, be sure to let your health care provider know 
what, if any, alternative or complementary products you are taking. Some phy-
sicians, possibly including yours, may express frustration or become overtly 
upset when they find out you’re taking complementary and alternative medi-
cines. Nonetheless, this must not dissuade you from sharing your CAM use 
with your doctor. Your health may well depend on your doctor being aware of 
what CAMs you are taking so that he can do his best to determine whether the 
CAMs may adversely impact on your prescription medications, your celiac 
disease, or any other health conditions you may have. (By the way, most phy-
sicians, including us, even when skeptical of the putative benefits of a given 
CAM, are fine with patients taking them so long as the product isn’t likely to 
be harmful.)
Prebiotics and Probiotics
 
Prebiotics are defined as foods that do not get absorbed into the body. 
Instead they pass into the colon where they stimulate the growth in numbers 
of healthy bacteria. Probiotics are live bacteria or yeasts that you ingest to 
increase the numbers of these organisms living inside the gut.
People with celiac disease not infrequently consume prebiotics and probiotics 
to try to help treat their condition. Although there is little in the way of scien-
tific studies to recommend their routine use to treat celiac disease, there is one 
special circumstance where probiotics do have a role to play. As we discuss in 
Chapter 12, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth is treated with antibiotics and 
ingesting probiotics. (This does, of course, raise the conundrum as to whether 
probiotics, if recommended by both CAM practitioners and mainstream health 
care providers alike, should be truly considered a CAM. In this case, it’s not the 
product that makes it a CAM, but how it’s used.)
Unlike most other CAM therapies, prebiotics and probiotics are proven to be 
both very safe when used on their own and also when used in combination 
with prescription drugs.
 
Fermented milk products such as yogurt contain probiotic organisms like 
Lactobacillus and are also a good source of calcium, protein, and other 
nutrients.

230
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Herbal Supplements
An herb is defined as a plant without a woody stem. Hmm. All we can say 
is thank goodness Simon and Garfunkel opted to sing about “Parsley, Sage, 
Rosemary and Thyme” instead!
Herbs are tasty, smell nice, and are fun to grow. They are sometimes used as 
part of CAM therapy for celiac disease (and many other disorders, too). Some 
people living with celiac disease take evening primrose, dandelion, saffron, 
nutmeg, or one or more many other herbs. Despite this, there is no credible 
evidence that eating herbs will help control your celiac disease.
 
Although herbal therapies are generally safe, there are reports of people who, 
having consumed herbal medicines, developed various side effects including 
hepatitis, liver failure, and kidney failure. As we say earlier in this chapter, any 
form of therapy must be approached with due caution.
Vitamin Supplements
As we discover in detail in Chapter 7, some people with celiac disease benefit 
from selective use of specific vitamins, particularly vitamin B12, vitamin D, and 
folic acid (also known as vitamin B9). The main role for these supplements is 
in the early stages of celiac disease when you’ve been newly diagnosed, have 
symptoms (such as diarrhea and, possibly, weight loss), and you are just get-
ting going on your gluten-free diet.
Once your celiac disease is under good control and your vitamin stores are 
replenished, it is seldom necessary to continue taking these vitamin supple-
ments — with one exception relating to women and vitamin D. Because most 
North Americans do not get enough vitamin D from their diets or from sun 
exposure and because women are especially in need of sufficient vitamin D to 
help protect their bones from osteoporosis, it may be advisable to carry on 
taking vitamin D indefinitely. If you are a woman with celiac disease, we recom-
mend you speak to your primary care provider (such as your family doctor) 
to find out if you should continue to take vitamin D on an ongoing basis.
 
Although you can find many multivitamins containing every vitamin (and, 
often, a host of other ingredients) under the sun, their use in celiac disease (or 
pretty well any other health condition) is seldom warranted or of value unless 
your eating habits are particularly poor. Further, it is possible to overdose 
from taking too much of a certain vitamin, like vitamin A, which accumulates 
in the body. Taking excess doses of other vitamins that are excreted in your 
urine is harmful only to the health of your wallet as you flush away some very 
expensive urine.

Nature designed us to obtain the nutrients we need from food. Studies indicate 
that diets high in fruits and vegetables are associated with lower rates of vari-
ous conditions including cancers. However, the same benefits are not seen 
when we try to use vitamin supplements to mimic the effect of such vitamin-
rich foods. This suggests that the healthful components of food are complex 
and cannot be fully replaced by supplements, at least at the current time.
Digestive Enzymes
Digestive enzymes are available without prescription in health food stores 
and other commercial outlets. As we discuss in Chapter 12, such enzymes do 
have a proven role to play if you have pancreatic insufficiency (that is, a condi-
tion in which your pancreas is unable to make sufficient amounts of digestive 
enzymes). However, if you have celiac disease and a healthy pancreas (which 
is true of the vast majority of people with celiac disease), then taking digestive 
enzyme supplements provides no health value to you. Having said that, they’re 
not likely to be harmful either, but hey, if you don’t need these supplements, 
we’re sure you can find better ways to spend your hard-earned dollars.
Following the Specific Carbohydrate Diet
Some people with celiac disease (and other health disorders such as inflam-
matory bowel disease, explained in Chapter 12) place themselves on the 
Specific Carbohydrate Diet (SCD).
The SCD is a very restrictive diet that excludes most carbohydrates, includ-
ing lactose-containing milk products. The theoretical basis for the diet — 
there is no scientific proof of this — goes like this:
 
1. Intestinal inflammation associated with conditions such as celiac dis-
ease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is caused by intestinal 
microbes. (Remember, we’re talking theoretical here; there is no proof 
whatsoever for this.)
 
2. Intestinal microbes feed off carbohydrates present in the bowel.
 
3. Ingesting less carbohydrate causes the intestinal microbes to starve and 
helps control the celiac disease or IBD.
It is also postulated that undigested carbohydrates can lead to formation of 
toxic products that destroy intestinal enzymes required for carbohydrate 
digestion and absorption.

232
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Unfortunately, there are no well-designed medical research studies to sup-
port the use of this dietary intervention. Some people with various gastroin-
testinal illnesses report benefit from following the SCD, but most people who 
try it subsequently discontinue it because they observe no benefit.
The major concern about the SCD is whether you will be able, given the 
severe dietary restriction, to consume sufficient calories to maintain good 
nutrition and health. For this reason, we caution against children or under-
weight adults from following this diet.
 
If you think a gluten-free diet is restrictive then the specific carbohydrate diet 
is not for you!
Treating Celiac Disease by Avoiding 
Foods Other Than Gluten
The mainstay of therapy for celiac disease is the elimination of gluten from 
one’s diet. The only other necessary food restriction is the temporary elimina-
tion of lactose (this is the sugar found in milk products) for a time after celiac 
disease is first diagnosed (unless you also have pre-existing or ongoing lactose 
intolerance in which case you will need to remain lactose-free indefinitely.) We 
discuss lactose intolerance and celiac disease in detail in Chapter 11.
Although there are no scientifically proven benefits to be achieved by people 
living with celiac disease eliminating other types of foods from their diet, 
some individuals do find that they feel better if they do. Sometimes this is a 
general feeling of improved health, and sometimes it is a perceived reduction 
in specific symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, cramps, or diarrhea. In 
this situation the person is said to have a food sensitivity or food intolerance.
 
It’s important to avoid confusing a food sensitivity (which is never serious) 
with a food allergy (which can be so serious as to be life-threatening). As we 
discuss in Chapter 2, a food sensitivity is an entirely different kettle of fish 
from a food allergy. A food allergy (such as a peanut allergy for example) is a 
serious problem in which, shortly after ingesting a substance, one develops 
symptoms such as skin rash (hives), shortness of breath, wheezing, swelling, 
and, sometimes, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. If you think you have a food 
allergy, you need to see an allergist to have this fully sorted out and, if the 
problem is confirmed, you should then meet with a dietitian to learn more 
about how to avoid the specific food to which you are allergic. A helpful  web-
site about food allergies is www.foodallergy.org. 
 
Because it is not possible to medically test for food intolerances, except for 
a few sugar intolerances including milk sugar (lactose) and fructose, the only 
way to determine if a specific food may be causing your gastrointestinal symp-
toms is to remove it from your diet and see if, having done so, you feel better.

233
 Chapter 13: Alternate and Complementary Therapies
Removing a limited number 
of foods from your diet
If you are pretty certain one or two foods are the cause of your abdominal 
pains or diarrhea, then try living without this food for a week or so. If this 
doesn’t help, keep a daily record for a few weeks of everything you ingest 
and also note when your symptoms occur. Doing so may allow you to find a 
pattern wherein ingesting certain foods correlates with when you have your 
symptoms. If you find this type of match, you can then try eliminating the 
possibly “guilty” food from your diet and see whether you then feel better.
Bear in mind that, although there is no harm in doing any or all of these 
things, this is, at best, only a semi-scientific approach, and it will be difficult 
or even impossible to ever establish with certainty that any of these changes 
to your diet are actually responsible for any changes in your symptoms.
Trying an elimination diet
If you seem to react to lots of foods and, in spite of keeping a food diary, you 
can’t figure out what foods are making you feel unwell, then we suggest going on 
a so-called elimination diet (also known as an exclusion diet or a hypo-allergenic 
diet). This diet is also gluten-free. If you decide to go on an elimination diet, 
make sure to do so with the advice and assistance of a physician knowledge-
able in this field, such as an allergist, and a nutritionist. This approach is 
not recommended for children, those who are malnourished, and those with 
other conditions managed by dietary means, including diabetes.
With the elimination diet, you severely restrict the variety of foods you eat 
and, if your symptoms resolve, you then begin the detective work of finding 
out what food (or foods) might have been causing your symptoms before 
you removed it (or them) from your diet. The strategy here is to add one 
food type back in to your diet every 3 to 5 days and if this food doesn’t cause 
problems, you keep adding another food into your diet until — voila! — you 
realize it was pork (or chicken or avocados or . . .) that was the reason you 
had nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea soon after you would eat certain meals. If 
specific foods are identified, then you can avoid eating such foods.
If, however, after being on the elimination diet for a few weeks, you do not 
feel any better or if you feel better but, upon sequentially reintroducing 
foods, you are unable to find any specific foods that trigger your symptoms, 
then you can be reassured it is not a specific food or group of foods causing 
the problem but rather just eating in general. Lots of patients have irritable 
bowel syndrome and other so-called functional gastrointestinal disorders 
(FGID; see Chapter 12) and experience non-specific reactions such as bloat-
ing, belching, indigestion, and a sensation of urgently needing to have a 
bowel movement in response to eating. This is particularly likely if meals are 
large, fat-laden, or consumed quickly. 

234
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Removing certain sugars from the diet
Lactose is not the only sugar (or carbohydrate) that can cause gastrointes-
tinal complaints. Fructose and related products (called fructans) as well as 
sorbitol (which is a sugar alcohol) can cause diarrhea and bloating in some 
individuals. There is growing recognition that a larger group of dietary carbo-
hydrates referred to as FODMAPS (hold on now; this stands for the following 
mouthful: fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and 
polyols) can also cause gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in certain settings.
Intolerance to FODMAPs has been studied primarily in people with irritable 
bowel syndrome (IBS), but could well play a role in some folks with celiac dis-
ease, particularly those with an IBS component to their illness. Not enough is 
as yet known about this to routinely warrant any reduction in your consump-
tion of FODMAPS if you’re having GI symptoms (hence we’re including it in 
this chapter on complementary and alternative therapies), but it is some-
thing to consider if you still have problems in spite of a gluten-free diet, and if 
your doctor is not able to find any other reason for this.
Why it’s okay to empirically withdraw lactose, 
but not gluten from your diet
Doctors commonly advise patients with sus-
pected lactose intolerance (see Chapter 11) to 
avoid lactose containing foods for a week or 
two to see if this improves their symptoms. You 
may rightly ask why can’t you can’t do the same 
with gluten. Here are some reasons:
 ✓ Going off lactose will not alter the accuracy 
of subsequent medical testing for lactose 
intolerance whereas living gluten-free, 
depending on the duration, can affect the 
results of diagnostic tests for celiac dis-
ease thereby making it harder to determine 
if you or do not have the condition.
 ✓ Avoiding lactose is generally easier to do 
without professional dietary counselling 
than is avoiding gluten.
 ✓ Perhaps most importantly, feeling better off 
lactose is very likely to predict that you do, 
indeed, have lactose intolerance (that is, 
your own experiment with dietary manipula-
tion allowed for a correct diagnosis) whereas 
feeling better off gluten does not accurately 
predict that the cause is celiac disease.
In Chapter 3 we look at additional reasons why 
we recommend against empirically removing 
gluten from your diet.

235
 Chapter 13: Alternate and Complementary Therapies
Going Gluten-Free to Treat Disorders 
Other Than Celiac Disease
Many people consider following a gluten-free diet even if they have neither 
celiac disease nor dermatitis herpetiformis (a skin disease closely related to 
celiac disease; we discuss this condition in Chapter 8). This is most common 
amongst those who believe they have a food sensitivity specifically to gluten 
(that is, gluten sensitivity) or if they are hoping that avoiding gluten may help 
neurological or mood symptoms they’re experiencing. We discuss these 
issues in this section.
Gluten sensitivity
Gluten sensitivity is not to be confused with the similar sounding term, gluten-
sensitive enteropathy. Gluten-sensitive enteropathy is simply a synonym for 
celiac disease. Gluten sensitivity, on the other hand, refers to the situation 
wherein a person who does not have celiac disease finds that ingesting gluten 
makes him or her feel unwell in one way or another.
Although much is yet to be learned about gluten sensitivity, two key points 
are well recognized:
 
✓ Gluten sensitivity and celiac disease can cause some similar gastrointes-
tinal symptoms such as nausea, abdominal discomfort or cramps, and 
diarrhea. Gluten sensitivity, however, does not cause the severe or spe-
cific problems that can sometimes be seen with celiac disease, such as 
malabsorption and osteoporosis.
 
✓ Whereas celiac disease causes demonstrable inflammation of the small 
intestine, gluten sensitivity does not damage the intestine or, for that 
matter, any other organs. In this sense, gluten sensitivity, even if it 
makes you feel unwell, does not carry the same potential dangers as 
does celiac disease.
The cause of gluten sensitivity
Gluten sensitivity is neither a food allergy (like a peanut allergy) nor a T cell 
mediated disease (like celiac disease). In fact, it is not necessarily gluten that 
is responsible for the symptoms of gluten-sensitivity in the first place.
If you are thought to have gluten sensitivity and have eliminated gluten from 
your diet and felt better thereafter, you may well be wondering how it could 
be that gluten wasn’t actually responsible for your previous symptoms. 
(We’d sure wonder this if we were in this position.) Here’s the explanation: 
Those who adopt a gluten-free diet can no longer eat fast-food and prepared 
foods (as these things contain gluten) and their diet starts to contain more 

236
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
unprocessed or natural foods. Going gluten-free gets rid of many additives, 
preservatives, fats, and other potentially unhealthy substances from the diet. 
Making this major improvement in your diet, it’s no wonder that you would 
feel better! In other words, it’s likely not the removal of gluten that made 
you feel better if you had gluten-sensitivity; it’s eliminating all the other, 
unhealthy stuff that made the difference.
In some individuals with gluten-sensitivity, however, it may be gluten that is 
actually causing symptoms. Gluten can be hard to digest, and some medical 
studies have shown that diets high in gluten resulted in a larger output of 
stool compared to low gluten diets. Perhaps this somehow results in the GI 
symptoms that are noted by people with gluten sensitivity. At present this 
and other existing theories must be considered, well, just that: theories.
The potential hazards of treating presumed gluten 
sensitivity without first ruling out celiac disease
 
If for any reason you or a family member have symptoms that you believe 
are due to gluten, do not commit yourself or a family member to a long-term 
gluten-free diet without first seeing a physician to have appropriate evaluation 
to determine whether celiac disease or some other potentially serious medical 
disorder is present.
Here are some of the many reasons why you or your family member should 
not follow a gluten-free diet without knowing what is being treated:
 
✓ A gluten-free diet may not be the correct treatment for the underlying 
medical problem. A gluten-free diet, for instance, won’t help inflamma-
tory bowel disease (explained in Chapter 12).
 
✓ If you have been on a gluten-free diet for a number of months or 
more, it makes it more difficult to determine whether you have celiac 
disease (see Chapter 3). Similarly, screening family members for celiac 
disease is more difficult if they are already on a gluten-free diet (see 
Chapter 4).
 
✓ A gluten-free diet is expensive, especially if the whole family eats 
gluten-free. Why spend this extra money if you don’t have to? Make sure at 
least someone in the family has a good reason to be eating gluten-free (be it 
celiac disease or gluten sensitivity) before committing to this expense.
 
✓ There is a risk of being less well nourished on a gluten-free diet. 
Before you put yourself on a gluten-free diet you should first meet with 
a registered dietitian to receive their expert advice. (See Chapter 11 for 
more on potential nutritional deficiencies due to celiac disease.)
 
✓ For medical insurance and tax reasons, it can be important to have a 
proven diagnosis of celiac disease. Simply advising an insurer or tax 
department that you felt better not consuming gluten is unlikely to be 
sufficient to assist you with any insurance claims or applications for tax 
deductions. We discuss these issues in Chapter 15.

237
 Chapter 13: Alternate and Complementary Therapies
See Chapter 3 for a further discussion on why empirically removing gluten 
from your diet isn’t wise.
Despite our major concerns about people self-diagnosing and self-treating for 
presumed gluten sensitivity or celiac disease, we do admit there is actually 
one benefit to be had from this. Marketers estimate that 15 to 25 percent of 
consumers want gluten-free foods even though only one percent have celiac 
disease. Even celebrities are “purifying” or “cleansing” using diets without 
meat, diary, sugar, caffeine, and, you guessed it, gluten! With so many people 
putting themselves on a gluten-free diet, the food industry is going gang-
busters to accommodate the burgeoning demand and, as a result, is coming 
up with increasing variety (and palatability) in the gluten-free foods they 
offer. Indeed, creating gluten-free products is now one of the fastest growing 
aspect of the food industry. For those millions of people with celiac disease 
(and for those who have gluten sensitivity) who are looking for new food 
options, this is surely welcome news indeed.
Going gluten-free to treat neurological 
and mood disorders
A gluten-free diet is sometimes used for the treatment of neurological and 
mood disorders ranging from Attention–Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 
(ADHD) and autism, to depression, schizophrenia, neuropathy, seizures, and 
migraines.
As we discuss in Chapter 6 and Chapter 8, celiac disease is associated with 
a variety of different neurological and mood issues. The reason (or reasons) 
for this association is largely unknown. One theory, however, is that gluten or 
components of gluten may be toxic to the brain or nerves. Another theory is 
that the immune response to gluten can lead to antibodies that may damage 
the nervous system. This has prompted some people to follow a gluten-free 
diet to treat neurological or mood ailments, even if they don’t have celiac 
disease.
The scientific evidence for following a gluten-free diet in the absence of celiac 
disease is largely lacking.
 
We strongly recommend that if you or a family member suffer from a neurolog-
ical or mood disorder, you contact your physician to be thoroughly assessed 
before you start yourself or a loved one on a gluten-free diet since other, more 
proven and more effective medical treatments are likely to be available.

▶ Diagnosing celiac disease in children

▶ Beginning a child on a gluten-free diet
▶ Showing your child how to shop and cook to meet her special needs
▶ Growing pains for the parent of a child with celiac disease
A
lthough everyone living with celiac disease shares certain things in 
common — such as the need to avoid consuming gluten — children 
face additional, special challenges that adults do not. And, if you are the 
parent of a child with celiac disease, you likely have already discovered that 
you, too, have challenges that other parents may not have to contend with.
If you have celiac disease and are trying to have a child, you may face certain 
hurdles. Celiac disease can cause infertility (in both men and women) and, 
once you’re pregnant, it can increase the risk of certain obstetrical complica-
tions, including miscarriages.
In this chapter, we look at these important issues. As always, we encourage 
you to bear in mind that, although having celiac disease increases your risk 
of fertility and obstetrical difficulties, the great majority of people living with 
celiac disease are able to successfully conceive, deliver, and raise healthy 
children. (Well, the women do the conceiving and delivering!)

240
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Pregnancy and Celiac Disease
Celiac disease can interfere with a woman’s reproductive function. This 
fact is unknown to most health care providers and, less surprisingly, is also 
unknown to most people living with celiac disease. Even more overlooked 
is that celiac disease can also interfere with a man’s reproductive function. 
Reproductive difficulties range from infertility to miscarriages to delivering a 
small baby. We discuss these important topics in this section.
 
Like so very many other complications of celiac disease, these reproductive 
difficulties apply to active celiac disease. When you’re on track with your 
gluten-free diet, these problems typically resolve.
Infertility and celiac disease
Infertility is typically defined as the inability to conceive (that is, to become 
pregnant) despite a year or more of regular intercourse without contracep-
tion. Although the findings remain controversial, some scientific evidence is 
available to indicate that active celiac disease can cause infertility and, more-
over, that this can happen in both men and women.
Female infertility
In order for a woman to get pregnant, she must be able to ovulate. Ovulation 
is the process wherein an ovum (an “egg”) is released from an ovary. After 
leaving the ovary, the ovum makes its way down the fallopian tube where, 
if one has had recent intercourse, it can then meet up with a sperm and the 
ovum can then be fertilized.
In the absence of ovulation, pregnancy cannot occur (except through in vitro 
fertilization — IVF — but that’s a subject for a different book). Women with 
untreated or insufficiently treated celiac disease have fewer years in which 
they ovulate and, hence, fewer opportunities to become pregnant. This can 
occur on either side of the fertile age spectrum; in other words, women with 
active celiac disease may:
 
✓ First start ovulating (and therefore, first begin having periods) later than 
normal.
 
✓ Stop ovulating (and hence, develop menopause) earlier than normal.
 
✓ Have times where ovulation — and, hence, periods — stop. (This is 
referred to in medical jargon as secondary amenorrhea.)

241
 Chapter 14: Celiac Disease and Pregnancy, Children, and Beyond
It is not known with certainty why some women with active celiac disease 
have these problems with ovulation, but possible factors may be:
 
✓ Malabsorption of nutrients. Celiac disease can result in malabsorption 
of important nutrients required to allow for normal female hormone 
production that regulates ovulation and the menstrual cycle. The poor 
nutrition that results from malabsorption is especially likely to play 
a role if untreated celiac disease has led to a lower than normal body 
weight. We discuss malabsorption in detail in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Endocrine dysfunction. Having celiac disease increases the probability 
of a person also having certain endocrine (that is, hormonal) disorders, 
such as thyroid disease, which in their own right can disrupt ovarian 
function. We discuss this issue further in Chapter 8.
The preceding discussion applies to women with active celiac disease. If you 
follow a strict gluten-free diet, your celiac disease will be inactive and you 
will likely have normal ovulation and normal ability to conceive. Nonetheless, 
and for reasons that are not fully understood, even when having normal 
ovulation and menstrual cycles, occasionally a woman with celiac disease 
may still be at increased risk (compared to women without celiac disease) of 
having difficulty conceiving.
 
Infertility (or recurring miscarriages, which we discuss in the section, 
“Miscarriages”) may be the only manifestation of celiac disease and, indeed, 
can be the very first clue that you have this ailment. If you are having unex-
plained problems with infertility or recurring miscarriages, ask your doctor 
about the possibility that you have (undiscovered) celiac disease.
One final observation before we leave this section: IVF aside, unless you’re 
having intercourse, pregnancy ain’t gonna happen. One scientific study 
found that couples in which one of the partners had celiac disease had sex 
less often than couples in which celiac disease wasn’t present. The reason? 
Probably that the person with celiac disease didn’t feel well and as a result 
was less interested in having intercourse. Makes sense. So too, does it make 
sense that, once the affected person started a gluten-free diet, the frequency 
with which they were having sex — and their satisfaction with their sex life — 
both returned to normal. The moral of the story? Forget about the oysters, 
dark chocolate, and the like; the newest aphrodisiac on the block is clearly 
following a gluten-free diet! (Well, at least if you have celiac disease.)
Male infertility
Many possible reasons exist for a man to have infertility, but increasingly rec-
ognized is the potential for celiac disease to cause this problem. Active celiac 
disease can lead to:

242
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
 
✓ Low male hormone levels. Lower than normal amounts of testosterone 
may occur.
 
✓ Abnormal sperm. Some ways that sperm can be abnormal are
 
• Reduced sperm count. Not enough sperm is present.
 
• Abnormally shaped sperm. Such sperm are less capable of fertil-
izing an ovum.
 
• Defective sperm function. Sperm, as you likely recall from those 
oh-so-uncomfortable sex education classes way back when, “swim” 
up from the vagina into the uterus and then into the fallopian 
tubes where, if there is an available ovum, fertilization takes place. 
Some evidence exists that this swimming action (called motility) is 
impaired in men with active celiac disease.
The reason for these abnormalities is not known for certain, but it could be 
that they result from:
 
✓ Malabsorption. Malabsorption of important nutrients required to allow 
for normal male hormone and sperm production. We discuss malabsorp-
tion in detail in Chapter 6.
 
✓ Androgen resistance. In this condition, a man has ample quantities of 
testosterone (testosterone is a member of the group of male hormones 
collectively called androgens) but the hormone doesn’t work properly 
because the man’s tissues are resistant to its actions.
If you are having problems with infertility on the basis of untreated or insuffi-
ciently treated celiac disease, once you’re on track with your gluten-free diet 
your infertility will likely improve.
Complications of pregnancy
Most women with celiac disease have uneventful pregnancies; however, 
some evidence exists that women with active celiac disease may be at 
increased risk of pregnancy-related complications. (Reassuringly, recent 
studies suggest that even among women with active celiac disease, the risk of 
these complications may not always be greater than what you may expect in 
individuals without celiac disease.)
Miscarriages
A miscarriage (also referred to as a spontaneous abortion) is the spontaneous 
end of a pregnancy at a stage where the embryo or fetus is incapable of sur-
viving, generally defined in humans as being prior to 20 weeks of pregnancy 
(gestation). Women with active celiac disease have an increased risk of 
miscarrying a pregnancy. Indeed, as we mention in the preceding section, 

243
 Chapter 14: Celiac Disease and Pregnancy, Children, and Beyond
miscarriage may be the only clue that a person has (as yet undiagnosed) 
celiac disease.
 
If you have the sad misfortune to have a miscarriage, lest you automatically 
attribute it to your celiac disease or, even worse, blame yourself for not being 
careful enough with your gluten-free diet, bear in mind that miscarriages are 
very common in women without celiac disease. Indeed, 25 percent or more 
of pregnancies result in a miscarriage within a few weeks of conceiving. 
Miscarriages are not only common, but they can also occur for many different 
reasons. Therefore, if you have celiac disease and you have a miscarriage, it 
may well be unrelated to your celiac disease. In other words, don’t feel guilty. 
Having said all that, it always remains terribly important — especially if you 
are pregnant — to follow a healthy, nutritious, gluten-free diet. We discuss the 
gluten-free diet in Chapter 10.
Small babies, intrauterine growth retardation, and premature delivery
A fetus that is smaller than expected for the length of time a women has been 
pregnant is referred to as being small for gestational age. Being small for ges-
tational age occurs as a consequence of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR); 
formerly termed intrauterine growth retardation. IUGR is a condition in which 
the fetus grows and develops more slowly than normal then, when subse-
quently born, is typically underweight.
Many causes exist for IUGR, including a fetus having a genetic defect or 
infection, or the pregnant woman having diabetes or a malfunctioning pla-
centa. An additional cause of IUGR may be celiac disease, which, in some 
studies, has been associated with as much as a threefold increased risk. 
This finding, however, has not been corroborated in other medical studies 
which, in fact, suggested there was no increased risk. Clearly, the jury is 
still out on this issue.
Another reason for delivering a small baby is an early delivery called a pre-
term or premature delivery. Here, too, the evidence that celiac disease may be 
responsible is contradictory.
If celiac disease does, in fact, contribute to an increased risk of a fetus being 
small, having IUGR, or being delivered prematurely, the cause remains to be 
determined.
Helping avoid pregnancy complications due to celiac disease
Although no woman with celiac disease can ever be guaranteed that she can 
avoid pregnancy-related complications, women with celiac disease can follow 
certain precautions to make what are good odds of a healthy outcome into 
even better odds.
We recommend that if you are a woman with celiac disease and you are con-
templating pregnancy, do the following before you try to get pregnant:

244
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
 
✓ Make sure you are meticulously following your gluten-free diet.
 
✓ Ensure your celiac disease symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal dis-
comfort, and fatigue, are better or completely gone. (We discuss symp-
toms of celiac disease in Chapter 6.)
 
✓ If you’ve had problems with anemia, iron deficiency, or other abnormal 
blood chemistry tests, review these with your family doctor or celiac 
disease specialist to make sure they have resolved. (We discuss anemia 
and iron deficiency in Chapter 7.)
 
✓ Check with your celiac disease specialist that your celiac antibody tests 
(such as your IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody level) have returned 
to normal. (We discuss antibody tests in Chapter 3.)
 
✓ Speak to your obstetrician/gynecologist to determine if he is satisfied 
that you are in suitable gynecologic health to attempt to conceive.
Screening infertile women and women with 
recurring miscarriages for celiac disease
Whether or not to screen (that is, test) women 
with infertility for undiagnosed celiac disease 
is controversial.
Some medical studies have found that screen-
ing infertile women for celiac disease detects 
larger numbers of women with celiac disease 
than are seen in control populations made up 
of fertile women. In other words, researchers 
determined that there were significant num-
bers of women with infertility who had hitherto 
undiscovered celiac disease.
Other medical studies, however, have shown 
contradicting findings with researchers deter-
mining that, in fact, there was no greater 
likelihood — in these studies — of an infertile 
woman having celiac disease than of a fertile 
woman having celiac disease.
In the face of this contradictory scientific 
evidence, doctors need to rely on their best 
judgment. And this is ours. . . .
Given that:
 1. Some women with celiac disease are infer-
tile due — often in unknown ways — to 
their celiac disease, and
 2. Treating celiac disease can, is many such 
women, restore fertility, and
 3. Testing for celiac disease is relatively 
straightforward, and
 4. Studies like those quoted above look at 
population groups, not unique individuals 
and their personal situation,
we feel that if you have infertility (or recur-
ring miscarriages), your doctor can reason-
ably decide to check you for possible celiac 
disease. We would also add that, although 
doctors shouldn’t be swayed from objectively 
looking at the available medical research, it is 
awfully hard to not be influenced by the stories 
we’ve heard of infertile or miscarriage-prone 
women whose celiac disease was discovered 
only after they were tested for this and whose 
fertility/pregnancy difficulties resolved after 
their celiac disease was treated.

 Chapter 14: Celiac Disease and Pregnancy, Children, and Beyond
Timing of Gluten Introduction in Infancy
Growing interest exists among people living with celiac disease who are 
about to become (or are new) parents regarding when to introduce gluten 
into the diet of their infant child. Because celiac disease is more common 
among close family members, these parents recognize that their child is, 
therefore, at increased risk of developing celiac disease and, of course, like 
any loving parent, they want to lessen the likelihood of this happening.
Some medical studies suggest that the risk to a child of later developing 
celiac disease is reduced if the child has gluten introduced into their diet at a 
very early stage (before they are 4 months of age). Conversely, other studies 
suggest that it is best to delay introduction of gluten until the child is many 
months older.
How is a parent to know what to do? Pending the results of what hopefully 
will be definitive research results, the current consensus amongst most 
celiac disease experts is that it is best to first introduce gluten to infants who 
are genetically at risk of celiac disease between 4 and 6 months of age.
Breastfeeding, which is always the best way to provide nutrition to an infant, 
also seems to help prevent a child from later developing celiac disease. 
Breastfeeding is especially important during the period of introducing gluten 
into an infant’s diet.
Detecting Celiac Disease in Children
Until not too long ago, celiac disease was thought to be a pediatric condition 
and was seldom first detected in people beyond young adulthood. Today, 
however, we know that not only is celiac disease not exclusively a pediatric 
condition, in fact — and you may, perhaps find this surprising — it is most 
commonly diagnosed in people in their forties and older.
As we discuss in Chapter 5, there are several forms of celiac disease. In the 
past, most children diagnosed with celiac disease had the classical form with 
the main symptoms being gastrointestinal in nature. These children would 
have diarrhea and abdominal discomfort (and, because of malnutrition, 
would often have failed to properly grow, develop, and thrive).
Today, increasing numbers of children are diagnosed with atypical celiac 
disease with few or no gastrointestinal symptoms, the main or only features 
instead being impaired development or growth.

246
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Thankfully, studies suggest that the time to making a diagnosis is shorter 
in children than for adults in whom a diagnosis can be delayed by over ten 
years. Also, increasing numbers of children are being diagnosed through 
screening (we discuss screening in detail later in this chapter), which means 
they are able to be successfully treated for their condition long before it has 
had time to cause them to fall ill.
Diagnosing children with celiac disease
As we discuss in Chapter 3, the first step that must occur when a doctor 
diagnoses an illness is that she must think of the possibility that the illness is 
present. For celiac disease in a child, certain observations — as we discuss in 
the following sections — may lead a physician to consider this ailment.
We think that you should be aware of these features, too; this way, if you 
have a child without known celiac disease who develops these symptoms, 
you can mention, when you see the doctor, that you are wondering whether 
your child has this condition. Who knows? Perhaps you will have helped 
make an otherwise overlooked diagnosis. (As we say elsewhere in this book, 
lest you be concerned your doctor will, perish the thought, admonish you for 
telling them their business, feel free to take this book with you and blame us 
for putting you up to the task!)
Looking at symptoms
 
Unlike in adults, where the doctor gets the story directly from the patient, 
when it comes to children — especially young children — the doctor needs 
to rely on you, the parent, to provide your observations. It will, therefore, be 
helpful for you to mull over the information we discuss in this section before 
you take your child to the doctor so that you have collected as much informa-
tion as possible to share with the physician.
These symptoms can be present in a child with celiac disease (note that 
these symptoms can also occur with other ailments and thus are not unique 
to celiac disease):
 
✓ Abdominal discomfort. Cramping and distention.
 
✓ Abnormal bowel habits. Loose or watery stools, frequent large stools, 
and very smelly stools. Sometimes, however, constipation is the main 
problem.
 
✓ Behavior problems. Irritability, restlessness, and the inability to remain 
attentive or focused. (If you are a parent in this situation, rest assured 
that once your child is following their diet, their mood will likely quickly 
improve — and thus, yours will likely too!).

247
 Chapter 14: Celiac Disease and Pregnancy, Children, and Beyond
 
 As we discuss in detail in Chapter 8, there is some evidence that cer-
tain neurological and behavior problems such as ADHD and autism are 
more likely to occur in children who have celiac disease. Nonetheless, 
the great majority of children with ADHD and autism do not have celiac 
disease and, conversely, the great majority of children with celiac dis-
ease do not have ADHD, autism, or other neurological or behavioral 
difficulties.
 
✓ Dermatitis herpetiformis. A very itchy skin rash with little blisters over 
the elbows, shoulders, and buttocks. (These symptoms suggest the 
child may have dermatitis herpetiformis, a condition we discuss in detail 
in Chapter 8.)
 
✓ Insufficient growth and development. Failure to grow and develop 
normally (called failure to thrive), lack of normal weight gain, and, espe-
cially, the development of weight loss. The child may be shorter than 
others of the same age and may also be shorter than their siblings were 
at a comparable age.
 
 Some children, because of malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D, 
develop a condition called rickets in which the bones have impaired 
growth and strength. We discuss rickets in detail in Chapter 7.
 
✓ Other nonspecific symptoms. Generalized, nonspecific symptoms such 
as pale skin, lack of energy, malaise, and fatigue.
 
If your unwell child is still in diapers, pay special attention to your infant’s 
stools as it will be very helpful for the doctor to hear from you regarding how 
often diapers need to be changed and what is the consistency of your infant’s 
stools.
Another set of important observations you should make before you see 
the doctor is to note your child’s mood, energy, and level of physical activ-
ity. Does your child appear sullen and withdrawn, or happy and energetic? 
Does your child appear listless or is your child crawling, walking, or running 
around all day? A child who is fatigued, sullen, and listless may have these 
symptoms for a host of different reasons, one of which is celiac disease.
We recommend that you also share with the doctor when your child reached 
various developmental milestones (such as sitting, crawling, standing, walk-
ing, and talking) and whether your child is smaller or shorter than other of 
your children. A child who is slow to reach milestones and is shorter than his 
or her siblings were at that age does not necessarily have celiac disease, but 
it is certainly something that needs to be considered.
All these pieces of information will help your doctor fit the puzzle together.

248
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Undergoing a physical examination
When a doctor examines any sick child, there are very many features they 
are seeking. However, specifically in terms of whether the child may have 
celiac disease, the doctor will be checking for the following:
 
✓ Abnormal behavior. Evidence of abnormal behavior, failure to achieve 
developmental milestones, and reduced energy level.
 
✓ Anemia. Pale skin, which might indicate anemia.
 
✓ Dermatitis herpetiformis. Skin rash with characteristics suggesting der-
matitis herpetiformis. (See the previous section.)
 
✓ Insufficient growth and development. One way the doctor determines 
this is by comparing the child’s weight and height to the child’s peer 
group average as well as the child’s prior measurements.
 
✓ Malnourishment. Evidence of malnourishment can reflect the presence 
of malabsorption.
Testing for celiac disease
If, after talking to you and assessing your child, the doctor suspects celiac 
disease may be present, investigations will be required:
 
✓ Stool samples. Analyzed for evidence of malabsorption. (Stool samples 
can also be analyzed to look for other ailments — such as a bowel 
infection — that may be masquerading as, or mimicking, celiac disease.)
 
✓ Blood tests may be requested to look for a variety of different abnor-
malities, including:
 
• Anemia
 
• Vitamin deficiencies
 
• Abnormal body chemistry
 
• Celiac disease antibodies, including the tissue transglutaminase 
(TTG) IgA antibody and the antigliadin antibody (AGA). We discuss 
these tests in detail in Chapter 3.
 
✓ Endoscopy and small intestine biopsy. As we discuss in Chapter 3, an 
endoscopy and small intestine biopsy is — regardless of the age of the 
patient — the only definitive way to diagnose celiac disease. For this 
reason, if the doctor has a strong suspicion that your child has celiac 
disease, she may recommend proceeding directly with this test rather 
than first doing much, if any, other preliminary testing.
 
If your child’s doctor sends your child directly for a small intestine biopsy 
and it confirms celiac disease, the doctor will still likely then ask for the TTG 
IgA and AGA IgA antibody tests to be done because the result will be helpful 
to monitor your child’s progress. For more info on this topic, have a look at 
Chapter 15.

249
 Chapter 14: Celiac Disease and Pregnancy, Children, and Beyond
Doing an endoscopy in kids is not too much different than for adults. In very 
young children, different sedative medications are used and kid-sized endo-
scopes may be used as well. Typically, a parent comes into the endoscopy 
room to provide support until the child is sedated and is then again present 
when the child awakens in the recovery area of the endoscopy unit.
 
An endoscopy and small intestine biopsy are always necessary before a diag-
nosis of celiac disease can be made. We strongly recommend against foregoing 
these investigations and, based purely on speculation, making the diagnosis 
and placing a child on a gluten-free diet. Celiac disease is a serious, lifelong 
condition and following a gluten-free diet is no mean feat. Saddling a child 
with the diagnosis and treatment without first being certain of the diagnosis is 
simply neither fair nor appropriate. (Also, lest you think that a child who feels 
better on a gluten-free diet must surely have celiac disease and that other, 
confirmatory testing is unnecessary, we will note that lots of kids — and 
adults, too — feel better on a gluten-free diet whether or not they have celiac 
disease.)
Screening children for celiac disease
As we discuss in Chapter 4, screening for a disease is testing a person for it 
even if that person has no symptoms or other manifestations of the condition 
being looked for.
Several specific situations exist in which a doctor should consider screening 
a child for celiac disease, including when a child has:
 
✓ An immediate family member (or members) who are known to have 
celiac disease. If one person in the family has celiac disease, other 
immediate family members are at increased risk of also having the 
condition.
 
✓ Neurological or behavioral problems. As we discuss in Chapter 8, a 
variety of different neurological and behavioral problems exist that, for 
unclear reasons, may be more likely to occur if a child also has celiac 
disease. For this reason, some physicians screen for celiac disease in a 
child who has one or more of these other ailments.
 
✓ Type 1 diabetes. As we discuss in Chapter 8, type 1 diabetes is an 
autoimmune disease often onsetting in childhood and associated with 
an approximately 5 percent likelihood of the child also having celiac 
disease. Quite commonly, such children do not have any symptoms of 
celiac disease, and celiac disease wouldn’t have been detected if they 
hadn’t been screened for it.

250
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
For children who are being screened for celiac disease because they have an 
immediate family member with this condition, the best initial screening test 
is to see whether the child has the HLA DQ2 and/or DQ8 genes. If these genes 
are not present, the risk of the child having or later developing celiac disease 
is so low that further screening for celiac disease is unnecessary.
As Sheila knows from her own family’s experience, knowing these genetic 
screening results — whether positive or negative — can be a huge help:
 
✓ If your child does not have the HLA DQ2 or DQ8 genes, you can feel 
greatly reassured that the child will almost certainly never develop 
celiac disease and, as mentioned, repeat screening is not be required.
 
✓ If your child does have either of these genes, you will be armed with the 
important knowledge that further action needs to be taken. Specifically, 
the next step is to check for TTG IgA and AGA IgA antibodies (see the 
immediately preceding section, “Testing for celiac disease,” and the fol-
lowing discussion).
In the event that your child has the HLA DQ2 or DQ8 genes, testing for celiac 
disease antibodies should first be performed when your child is between 5 
and 7 years of age. If these antibodies are normal (that is, depending on the 
laboratory’s testing methods, either completely absent or, at the least, in the 
so-called “normal range”), most pediatric celiac disease specialists suggest 
repeating the antibody tests every 2 to 3 years until the child reaches age 18 
at which point, if the antibody tests have remained negative, they are typi-
cally no longer tested for. However, if at any point your child later develops 
symptoms that suggest celiac disease and he or she is know to be genetically 
at risk, then a TTG IgA antibody test should again be performed, regardless 
of what age your child is (indeed, even if your “child” is now an adult). If the 
antibody tests are increased at any point, an endoscopy and small intestine 
biopsy should be performed to determine if celiac disease is present.
 
If your child has an autoimmune disease like type 1 diabetes, then HLA 
DQ testing is not very helpful and going straight to the antibody testing is 
recommended.
 
If your child has the HLA DQ2 or DQ8 genes, or has TTG IgA or AGA IgA 
antibodies, that does not mean he or she necessarily has celiac disease. It 
does, however, mean that your child may have the condition and that further 
investigations could be warranted including an endoscopy and small intestine 
biopsy. Only the presence of a confirmatory small intestine biopsy allows the 
diagnosis of celiac disease to be made.

251
 Chapter 14: Celiac Disease and Pregnancy, Children, and Beyond
Starting Your Child on a Gluten-free Diet
After your child has been diagnosed with celiac disease, he or she should 
begin a gluten-free diet. Chapter 10 covers in detail the reality of following a 
gluten-free diet; this section revisits some tips from that chapter.
 
Living gluten-free can pose quite a few challenges; especially for children. Here 
are some tips — some admittedly harder to follow than others — that parents 
of children with celiac disease have shared with us that helped them deal with 
these challenges:
 
✓ Base the family’s diet around naturally gluten-free foods such as fruits, 
vegetables, nuts, gluten-free grains and carbohydrates, meats, fish, and 
dairy products.
 
✓ Keep on hand (a limited number of) gluten-free treats that the whole 
family can enjoy. These can include gluten-free packaged and prepared 
foods like rice crackers or rice snacks, popcorn, ice creams, sorbets, 
and candies.
 
✓ When buying items such as cookies, cereals, and certain baked goods 
(scones, loaves), purchase both gluten-free and gluten-containing ver-
sions. Of course, the gluten-containing version should be given only to 
those family members who do not have celiac disease.
 
✓ When baking, prepare gluten-free and gluten-containing versions. 
Placing similar foods on everyone’s plate helps the child with celiac dis-
ease not feel left out.
As you embark on creating a healthy, gluten-free diet for your child, you may 
wonder if life would be easier if your entire family were also eating gluten-
free. Many parents tell us that doing this simplifies shopping and preparing 
food and also makes keeping the child with celiac disease on track with the 
diet easier. (Less temptation is present if everyone in the family is eating the 
same way and if no “off limits” foods are nearby.)
There are, however, challenges to having the entire family eat gluten-free, 
including the difficulty of finding sufficient quantities of gluten-free foods 
each time you shop, incurring additional expense (as we discuss in Chapter 
10, gluten-free foods often cost more than other foods), and asking the entire 
family to take on what are otherwise unnecessary dietary restrictions.
Some parents of children with celiac disease make the point that, in their 
opinion, teaching a child early in life to deal with the challenges they will face 
all of their life keeping gluten-free is best. They feel that having the rest of the 
family eat normally allows the child to develop the “right attitude” and learn 
boundaries at home. Other parents have very different and equally strongly 
held opinions. Needless to say, this topic is hotly debated among families and 
members of celiac support groups.

252
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Shopping and Cooking with Your 
Child Who Has Celiac Disease
Your child with celiac disease, at the appropriate age, needs to learn how 
to recognize gluten-free foods and where to find them not only at home, but 
also in stores and online. Of course, educating your child in these ways is a 
gradual process that evolves as your child grows up.
Even more important is to encourage your child to develop an interest in 
cooking and baking gluten-free. Cooking and baking gluten-free are skills that 
will help throughout the rest of your child’s life. Sheila, her children, and 
their friends are the benefactors of her husband’s interest in cooking, which 
started when he was a child learning to cook gluten-free foods.
In Chapter 10, we look in detail at shopping and cooking gluten-free.
Growing Up Gluten-Free
As any parent knows (or eventually finds out), parenting a child presents 
different challenges that depend on the age of the offspring. In this section, 
we look at some of these age-dependent challenges as they pertain to celiac 
disease.
Dealing with the preschool years
One of the most challenging aspects of keeping a pre-schooler gluten-free is 
when the child is away from home and, especially, when they are out of your 
supervision. Whether attending daycare or preschool, going to a friend’s house 
or attending a birthday party, your child will be constantly at risk of being 
exposed to gluten. Children like to share their food and try other’s food.
The best way to deal with this issue is to educate the people (teachers, other 
parents, babysitters, and so on) who will be interacting with your child about 
celiac disease. Make them aware of what is a gluten-free diet, and the impor-
tance of not deviating from it.
Working with others on this issue will require diligence on your part because 
most people are not particularly conversant with celiac disease and may mis-
takenly believe that “just a little bit” of gluten couldn’t possibly hurt. If they 
feel this way, make sure you correct them on this potentially dangerous mis-
conception! (If you are concerned that you will be met with skepticism — or 
worse — consider showing them this book; as always, we’re happy to be the 
heavies here.)

253
 Chapter 14: Celiac Disease and Pregnancy, Children, and Beyond
 
You may find that providing your child with gluten-free snacks and treats to 
take with them when they are attending celebrations or even simply visiting a 
friend’s house is often helpful — not only for you and your child, but also for 
the parent(s) of the child that he or she is visiting.
Helping your child through the 
elementary school years
As your child goes through the elementary school years, a main challenge 
will be living gluten-free while eating in cafeterias or at sleepovers, camp, and 
other such away-from-home activities. Fortunately, at this age your child can 
be actively involved in their care by letting those people (and their supervi-
sors) with whom they’re spending time know about the need to follow a gluten-
free diet and, depending on your child’s age and level of maturity, telling 
others of what that diet consists.
 
We recommend that, when appropriate, you speak to the people who will be 
supervising your child when outside of the home to inform them about the 
basics regarding celiac disease and gluten-free eating. Again, feel free to let 
them borrow this book; perhaps with you having tagged key pages for them 
to read.
 
Anytime your child will be away from home overnight, whether for a one night 
sleepover or a summer-long stay at camp, he or she will be at increased risk of 
eating gluten. It is important to remind your child to not be lulled into thinking 
that eating gluten must be okay just because he or she doesn’t feel immedi-
ately unwell after consuming it. You may well find her friends and camp-mates 
pressuring her into consuming gluten. Feel free to both forewarn your child 
of this and to prepare her with ammunition to resist such temptation by 
saying — even if not completely accurately — that she is allergic to gluten. 
Nowadays, with so many children having dangerous allergies to things like 
nuts, using the term “allergic” is more likely to convey a sense of importance 
than would be an attempt at explaining the true (and complex) immune nature 
of celiac disease (which, by the way, we describe in Chapter 2).
Grasping teenage challenges
As any parent of a teenager — whether or not the teen has celiac disease — 
knows, the teenage years pose their own special set of parental challenges. 
(We speak from experience in case you’re wondering.) These years represent 
a time when your child wants to exercise his or her independence and this 
often entails a certain amount of rebelling against things that are imposed by 
authority including parents.

254
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
If your child has celiac disease, you may find that even if he was previ-
ously very good at sticking to a gluten-free diet, he may now go out with his 
friends to have regular pizza, burgers, and other gluten-containing fast foods. 
Sometimes, this experimenting leads to symptoms of indigestion, abdominal 
pain, and diarrhea, in which case the teen typically quickly gets back on track 
with gluten-free eating. If, however, your teenage child doesn’t develop symp-
toms, he may be less inclined to resume living gluten-free. This, in turn, will 
put him at risk of developing complications of celiac disease (as we describe 
in Chapter 7).
Giving your teen control of his or her own gluten-free diet is important. You 
should start to let go even in the pre-teen or early teen years depending on 
the maturity of your child. Here are some suggestions for you as a parent of a 
teenager with celiac disease:
 
✓ Don’t punish. Realize that gluten-ingestion “accidents” happen and 
don’t punish them for this.
 
✓ Educate your teen. Facilitate his learning and allow him to develop an 
understanding of his own health issues. Talk to him about the gluten-
free diet and celiac disease as you would or should for other health 
issues like texting while driving, alcohol, drugs, smoking, and sexual 
activities. Speaking in an open, educational, and non-threatening manner 
is often the best way of doing this.
 
✓ Involve your teen in the shopping and cooking. Learning the ropes 
of how to identify food products that are gluten-free and where to find 
them is an important skill to acquire before leaving home. Similarly 
being able to prepare gluten-free foods at home is another helpful skill 
to learn early in life.
 
✓ Have your teen check on gluten-free food availability. Let her check out 
what foods will be available at parties, restaurants, school trips, and other 
activities. That way, she will either be reassured that gluten-free foods are 
going to be available or, if not, can make alternative preparations.
 
✓ Encourage your teen to build a supportive peer group. Just like friends 
don’t let friends drink and drive, your child will want to have friends 
who support their efforts to stay gluten-free. Finding friends who won’t 
make fun of him for his special diet or encourage him to stray from the 
diet is important in teenage years and beyond.
 
✓ Task your teen with exploring menu options at prospective colleges. 
When seeking out colleges, in addition to finding out about the expected 
educational and social experiences, determine what are the available 
eating options. Once she knows where she will be going to college, your 
child can then arrange to meet with the kitchen manager, cook, dieti-
tian, or other relevant personnel at the college cafeteria to discuss your 
child’s gluten-free needs.

255
 Chapter 14: Celiac Disease and Pregnancy, Children, and Beyond
 
We recognize that there are no easy solutions to dealing with a teenage child 
with celiac disease who elects to not follow a gluten-free diet. Each teenager is 
different, each situation is different, and what works for one family may or not 
work for another. Letting your teenage child know that your concerns are 
born of love and caring is essential. You may also choose to enlist the support 
of others (family, friends, and so forth) that love and care about your child. If 
necessary, ask your doctor for help, either directly by speaking to your child 
or by referring your teenager to another, appropriate health care professional 
such as a social worker. Ultimately, however, it will be your child’s responsi-
bility to regain control of their health by returning to a gluten-free diet.
Sending your child off to college
By the time a child with celiac disease has reached young adulthood, he or 
she has typically become accustomed to living gluten-free. Nonetheless, new 
challenges emerge when it’s time to leave home for college. In addition to the 
usual trials and tribulations (adjusting to campus life, dealing with courses 
that are typically harder than those in high school, exploring a new social 
life, and so on), your young adult will face the additional hurdle of trying to 
live gluten-free while eating at cafeterias and with meal-plans that typically 
center around gluten-containing foods such as pizza, pasta, burgers, subs, 
breaded meats, and breads. You probably aren’t surprised to find that more 
than a few college students with celiac disease end up at the health services 
department with a flare of the disease.
Here are some food venues your teenage child must explore in order to stay 
gluten-free during the college years:
 
✓ Cafeteria or dining hall. Meet with the chef or cook at the dining facil-
ity where your child will be eating. Your child can share with the chef 
or cook her dietary needs and, in particular, the importance of having 
gluten-free foods available. (Lest your child feel she’s imposing by 
making special dietary requests, she can rest assured that celiac disease 
is common enough that many other students will likely share the same 
needs. Also, this is a health priority; nothing to be hesitant about here!)
 
✓ Living situation. Choose a living situation that doesn’t mandate use of 
the school or fraternity or sorority meal-plan. That way your teenage 
child can buy and prepare his own food. (See the anecdote which fol-
lows this list.)
 
✓ Nearby stores. Specialty food stores are often located in areas around 
colleges and universities. These shops and even some chains of grocery 
stores carry gluten-free foods. Identify these ahead of time, and if none 
are available, seek other options as listed below.

256
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
 
✓ Online grocery providers. Discover online purveyors of gluten-free 
foods. (Trust us, your young adult child is incredibly well acquainted 
with how to successfully surf the Web.)
 
✓ Restaurants. Locate local restaurants that have gluten-free offerings on 
their menus.
 
✓ Snacks. Eat a gluten-free meal or snack before going out with friends. 
(This isn’t usually necessary, but if your child isn’t sure the gang will 
be heading out to a place that has gluten-free food offerings, it can be 
helpful.)
 
Melissa, a patient of Sheila’s, was diagnosed with celiac disease during her 
sophomore year of college. She did very well on her gluten-free diet (avail-
able to her at the school cafeteria) and remained symptom-free. As the year 
was coming to a close, Melissa confided to Sheila that her sorority required 
that she live in the sorority house for her third year and this concerned her 
because many of the meals provided at the sorority consisted of gluten-laden 
items such as lasagna and other pasta dishes. At Melissa’s request, Sheila 
wrote a letter to the head of the local sorority chapter explaining the need for 
Melissa to live gluten-free. As a result of this letter, Melissa was granted an 
exemption by the sorority and allowed to remain a member but live outside 
of the sorority house. This enabled Melissa to continue to live gluten-free 
and she remained in good health. Did this put her at odds with her sorority? 
Apparently not; she was subsequently elected chapter treasurer!
 
Because gluten-free foods are often more expensive than gluten-containing 
foods, your young adult child’s food budget may be higher than that of other 
students. As we discuss in Chapter 10, in some settings these extra costs may 
qualify for a tax benefit, so be sure to save all receipts.

I
f you’ve recently been diagnosed with celiac disease and have now started 
a gluten-free diet, you may be wondering what to expect next, both in the 
near term and over the longer haul. Perhaps you’ve asked yourself questions 
such as “What do I need to keep an eye on?” or “What does my doctor need to 
keep an eye on?” In other words, what is the ongoing care of your celiac dis-
ease? It’s also quite possible that these are questions that you may have even 
if you’ve had celiac disease for many a year. In either case, you’ve come to 
the right place, because in this chapter, we answer these very questions.
Monitoring Your Celiac Disease
In medical school, doctors-to-be are taught rule after rule about how to 
manage a person’s health (or illness). Indeed, by the time newly crowned 
med students walk up to get their diplomas, their heads are crammed with 
literally thousands upon thousands of “proper ways” to do things. What a 
shock it is when one actually starts to work as a doctor and immediately 
learns that, in fact, there are no rules! There are approaches, guidelines, 
recommendations, policies . . . yes. But as for rules, well, not so much. Or, 
looked at another way, there are as many unique situations as there are 
unique patients, which is, pretty well, everyone a doctor sees. Why this 
preamble? Simply this: You are a unique individual, so the monitoring you 
require and how often you require it depends on your specific situation. 
(And, lest any of our colleagues take offense, okay, we admit there are some 
rules in medicine, but not very many.)

Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Determining how often you should see 
your health care providers
The factors that influence how often you need to be seen by your health 
care providers, including your primary care physician (such as your family 
doctor), your celiac disease specialist, and your dietitian, are based on a 
number of factors, including:
 
✓ How you are feeling.
 
✓ If you were diagnosed with celiac disease in the recent past, how sick 
you were when you were first diagnosed.
 
✓ Whether you’re having a hard time adhering to your gluten-free diet. We 
discuss the gluten-free diet in Chapter 10.
 
✓ Whether you’re having complications from your diet such as undue 
weight gain, weight loss, or constipation. We discuss these topics later 
in this chapter.
 
✓ If you have complications from your celiac disease. We discuss this 
topic in Chapter 7.
Why no rules exist when monitoring 
patients with celiac disease
In the world of medicine, the stronger the sci-
entific proof of something, the stronger are 
the recommendations that result from the sci-
entific proof. For example, there are so many 
thousands of studies showing that smoking is 
harmful to one’s health that doctors can say 
with complete confidence and conviction to all 
their patients that they should not smoke and, 
if they do, they should do their utmost to quit. 
Unfortunately, in the world of medicine, things 
are seldom this cut and dry. Indeed, there is 
seldom scientific evidence of such overwhelm-
ing, incontrovertible, perfectly consistent, and 
universally applicable character that a doctor 
can reflexively recommend to a patient a single 
course of action. This reality is very much the 
case when it comes to monitoring a person who 
has celiac disease.
Because of the paucity of studies on this sub-
ject, doctors have no rules or even rigid guide-
lines to follow regarding what monitoring tests 
should be done or how often they should be 
done (or even if they should be done at all!). 
When health care providers find themselves 
in this situation, they end up, pending new sci-
entific information providing a clearer path, 
following what is referred to as “common prac-
tice” or “best practice.” Common practice, as 
you might imagine, simply means it’s what, for 
better or worse, most doctors do. Best practice 
typically means that a whole bunch of recog-
nized authorities have gotten together, analyzed 
the available medical literature and anecdotal 
experience, and, using common sense, have 
come up with suggested recommendations for 
physicians to follow.

259
 Chapter 15: Ongoing Care of Celiac Disease
 
✓ If you have conditions associated with celiac disease. We discuss this 
topic in Chapter 8.
 
✓ What laboratory test abnormalities you had when you were diagnosed, 
how severe they were, and whether they are improving.
By way of extreme examples to make a point: If your celiac disease was only 
recently diagnosed, and if you were very unwell at the time with bad symptoms 
and markedly abnormal blood chemistry tests, you will need to be a frequent 
visitor to your celiac disease specialist. If you’ve had celiac disease for years, 
you’ve had no problems adhering to your gluten-free diet, you’re feeling well, 
and you’ve had no complications, then your specialist may need to see you 
very seldom. As you may imagine, most people with celiac disease — likely 
including yourself — fall somewhere in between.
 
As a very rough rule of thumb, if you’re pretty healthy overall when you’re first 
diagnosed with celiac disease, you may expect to see your celiac disease spe-
cialist and your dietitian collectively no more than a handful of times over the 
subsequent six months and less and less often as time goes by. It is our per-
sonal preference, as specialists, to routinely see our healthy, uncomplicated 
patients with celiac disease every year or two, but again, there are no rules.
Knowing who does the monitoring
The health care professional who is most responsible for monitoring your 
celiac disease varies depending on your specific circumstances and, in part, 
on the availability of a specialist. Although the diagnosis of celiac disease 
is almost always made by a specialist and although the early monitoring is 
typically done by this same doctor and a dietitian, as time goes by, if you’re 
doing well, your primary health care provider (such as your family doctor) 
will likely have a central role in keeping tabs on your progress. Of course, 
if you are not responding to therapy as you should or if you have complica-
tions from your celiac disease, then the ongoing involvement of a specialist 
will be essential.
If you’ve been doing very well — and especially if there is limited availability 
of celiac disease specialists — the entirety of your celiac disease medical 
care may be handed back to your family doctor by the specialist. If your spe-
cialist has handed your care back to your family doctor, that should not be 
taken to mean that you cannot again be seen by a specialist. Indeed, if ever 
you run into problems with your celiac disease — or if you or your family 
doctor even think you may have run into problems — you can be referred 
back to a specialist.
 
Registered dietitians are an invaluable resource when it comes to matters of 
nutrition. If your problem may relate to dietary issues, a dietitian is typically 
the best person to see.

260
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Knowing what is discussed 
during a monitoring visit
When you see your doctor for a routine celiac disease monitoring appoint-
ment, your doctor will want to find out from you many details regarding how 
you’ve been feeling since your last appointment. We discuss these details in 
this section.
 
You may find reviewing this section helpful to prepare for an appointment 
with the health care providers assisting you with your celiac disease. You will 
be less likely to feel caught off-guard during the meeting or, even worse, leave 
the interview only to then say to yourself “Oh shoot, I forgot to tell/ask the 
doctor. . . .”
 
When you see your doctor for your appointment, that appointment is your 
appointment and you should not feel constrained in what you bring up; indeed, 
you absolutely must share with your doctor anything at all that you feel may 
relate to your celiac disease. You never know when something that seems, at 
first blush, to be unimportant will in fact turn out to be highly significant.
How you’re feeling in general
When discussing various and sundry health concerns, regardless of whether 
the issues are related to celiac disease, very often doctors and patients 
(appropriately) spend considerable time discussing specific issues such as, 
for example, chest pain, joint pain, diarrhea, and so on. What risks getting 
missed, however, is an overview of how you’re feeling. Mary, in the following 
anecdote, illustrates just such a circumstance.
 
Mary was a 45-year-old accountant who came to see Ian for assessment of 
her celiac disease. She had recently moved to the area and this was her first 
visit to him. Ian asked Mary how she was doing to which she responded, in 
great detail and at length, that since starting a gluten-free diet at the time of 
her diagnosis six months earlier, her diarrhea had settled, she had regained 
some weight she had lost, and she no longer had abdominal pains. She con-
tinued, over the next five minutes, to provide a detailed description of vari-
ous and sundry symptoms she had previously had and noted how they had 
all improved. After Mary had finished, Ian recalls saying to her, “Mary, that’s 
great. And very helpful to know. Thanks for the information. Clearly you’ve 
had a major improvement in each of the symptoms that were previously both-
ering you. But what about how you are feeling in general? Do you feel healthy 
or not quite so well?” Mary was taken aback by the question and sat silently 
for a moment. “You know,” she then started, “I hadn’t really thought about 
that. I guess I’ve been so caught up with analyzing each specific symptom, I 
hadn’t thought about how I’ve been feeling in general. Well, now that I think 
about it, even though each of the symptoms I just mentioned is much better, 
I’m actually feeling generally not so hot.” Mary wasn’t aware of any specific 
way in which she was unwell; she just didn’t feel as healthy as she should and 

261
 Chapter 15: Ongoing Care of Celiac Disease
couldn’t put a finger on why. As it turned out, further investigations revealed 
that Mary had an underfunctioning thyroid (hypothyroidism); a condition 
which, as we discuss in Chapter 8, is known to be associated with celiac dis-
ease. Treatment was started and when Mary returned to see Ian a while later, 
she made a point of telling him not only how she was feeling in terms of specif-
ics, but how she was feeling generally which, she was thrilled to report — and 
Ian was thrilled to hear — was now terrific.
What your energy level is like
If you are lacking in energy, feeling generally fatigued, listless, or tired, this 
can be an important clue to your physician that something is amiss with 
your health. The cause may be entirely unrelated to your celiac disease, but 
of the many possible causes for these symptoms, quite a few are known to 
be associated with celiac disease, and therefore need to be considered by 
your health care provider. Possible causes include anemia, iron deficiency, 
thyroid disease, and depression to name but a few. We discuss this topic in 
detail in Chapter 6.
How your bowel habits are and, in particular, whether 
you’re having diarrhea or constipation
Although celiac disease can show itself in many varied ways, the common 
denominator with this condition is inflammation of the bowel, and so keeping 
tabs on whether you have symptoms related to your intestines is important.
If you’re having diarrhea, letting your doctor know is essential. A slew of pos-
sible causes of diarrhea exist, some serious, some not. As we discuss in detail 
in Chapter 12, possibilities include gluten remaining in the diet (that is, your 
diet isn’t truly gluten-free), having a complication from celiac disease, having 
some other, possibly unrelated condition, and so on.
 
Constipation, as we discuss later in this chapter, is a not uncommon con-
sequence of following a gluten-free diet. Be sure to let both your physician 
and your dietitian know if you’ve developed constipation so that they can 
assist you not only with determining the cause, but helping relieve you of 
the problem.
Whether your weight is going up, down, or remaining steady
As we discuss further on in this chapter (see the section “Weighty issues”), 
treatment of celiac disease can lead to both weight loss and weight gain. 
A few pounds in either direction is seldom a cause for concern, but if your 
weight is changing in amounts beyond a few pounds, be sure to let your phy-
sician know. Your doctor will need to determine whether anything of concern 
is present. If no additional medical issue is responsible, then a visit to your 
dietitian will be in order.

Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
For children, their pediatrician must make sure that they are on track on the 
growth curve; that is, gaining the appropriate amount of height and weight for 
their age. (You can find growth curves at www.cdc.gov/GrowthCharts). 
Often, children are below the expected height and weight for their age when 
they are first diagnosed with celiac disease. Once they are on a gluten-free 
diet and their intestines start to heal, they regain the ability to properly 
absorb nutrients into their body, and they begin the process of catching up 
on height and weight. The amount they catch up will depend on the age of the 
child when they first begin treatment. We discuss this in detail in Chapter 6.
 
If you have any doubt whether your child is growing and developing normally, 
and if the physician doesn’t happen to bring up this topic when you take your 
child in for a visit, be sure to raise your concerns with the doctor.
Whether you are on track with your gluten-free diet
As we mention literally dozens of times throughout this book, if you have 
celiac disease and continue to ingest gluten, you will experience ongoing 
damage to your small intestine and risk developing complications of this con-
dition. How essential is following a gluten-free diet if you have celiac disease? 
In a word, absolutely.
Letting your doctor know whether you’re on track — or whether you’re not 
on track — with your gluten-free diet is essential. If you’re not following the 
diet, your physician needs to spend time with you discussing what obstacles 
or barriers are limiting your adherence to your nutrition program. Recently, 
the Celiac Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital developed a question-
naire to assess whether patients were adhering to their gluten-free diet. Two 
questions turned out to be most predictive of how well patients fared adher-
ing to the diet – 1) the frequency of purposeful gluten ingestion and 2) the 
ability to follow a gluten-free diet outside the home. If your answers to these 
questions are “often” and “with difficulty” then we suggest you discuss this 
with your health care provider.
 
Your doctor is not there to judge you; if he is, he’s in the wrong profession! 
If you’re not following your gluten-free diet, you must — this is crucial — let 
your doctor know. If you don’t, your doctor may end up sending you for all 
sorts of unnecessary tests as he tries to discover why you’re not responding 
to your treatment program the way you should.
Monitoring you through testing
If, once you got on track with your gluten-free diet, you quickly became free 
of symptoms (especially gastrointestinal symptoms), and if you haven’t had 
complications from your celiac disease, your doctor will likely not ask you to 
go for much in the way of routing monitoring tests.

263
 Chapter 15: Ongoing Care of Celiac Disease
Several situations exist, however, where additional testing becomes more 
important, such as:
 
✓ If despite following a gluten-free diet you continue to feel unwell. In 
this case, you need to have further testing done to see whether evidence 
exists of ongoing intestinal damage.
 
✓ If you have complications from your celiac disease. In this situation, you 
need to have testing done to ensure that these complications are resolv-
ing. Here are some examples of complications (we discuss these in detail 
in Chapter 7) that would require monitoring through further testing:
 
• Iron deficiency anemia. If you have this problem, your doctor 
needs to keep tabs on your iron and hemoglobin levels.
 
• Vitamin D deficiency and/or calcium deficiency. In this case, 
your doctor needs to monitor your blood levels of these 
substances.
 
• Osteoporosis. If you have osteoporosis, your doctor needs to mon-
itor your bone density with periodic bone mineral density (BMD) 
tests.
 
Although tests can be very important in monitoring your progress, testing is 
always of secondary importance compared to the crucial information your 
doctor will learn about you by simply hearing from you how you’re feeling, 
how you’re doing with your diet, if you’re having symptoms, and so on.
Understanding the role of repeat blood antibody testing
As we discuss in Chapter 3, the IgA tissue transglutaminase antibody (TTG 
IgA) is a key blood test to help determine whether someone may have celiac 
disease. Almost all people with active celiac disease have this antibody. As 
you continue your gluten-free diet, your level of this antibody progressively 
falls and eventually become normal.
Monitoring your TTG IgA level is particularly helpful when you’re not 
responding to your gluten-free diet. For example, if despite having eliminated 
gluten you continue to have symptoms (such as abdominal cramping or 
diarrhea), your doctor can then test your TTG IgA level. If your level hasn’t 
significantly fallen since you started your nutrition program, your doctor and 
you will know that the odds are darned good that gluten is somehow continu-
ing to make its way into your diet (and thus into your gut). At that point, solv-
ing the mystery is a matter of donning your Sherlock Holmes cap, figuring out 
what is the source of the gluten, and eliminating it.
When the TTG IgA is no longer elevated, most specialists recommend that 
this test be checked every year or two, even if the patient is well and all the 
laboratory studies are normal. The rationale for doing this is that if the level 
unexpectedly goes up, it is strong evidence that a person’s celiac disease has 

264
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
again become active. No one has examined whether this type of laboratory 
monitoring practice is medically useful, but the tests are commonly done 
anyhow. (In medicine, as all physicians would readily admit, there is both art 
and science.)
Though used less often, the antigliadin (AGA) IgA antibody level can also be 
measured to monitor your progress. This test is of use primarily in children. 
(It appears to be more helpful in this age group compared with adults.)
The main reason for an adult to be monitored by testing their AGA IgA level is 
the unusual circumstance of an elevated AGA IgA level and a normal TTG IgA 
level at the time of diagnosis.
How the newer test that measures antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptides 
(DGP) — see Chapter 3 — might also be used in monitoring patients on a 
gluten-free diet has not as yet been studied.
Knowing the role of a repeat small intestine biopsy
As we discuss in Chapter 3, in order be diagnosed with celiac disease, you 
first need to have a biopsy of your small intestine. So long as the biopsy is 
conclusive, you remain on track with your gluten-free diet, you continue to 
feel well, and your laboratory tests don’t show anything remarkable, many 
celiac disease specialists (including us) will not find it necessary to have you 
again undergo the procedure in the future.
Some circumstances exist, however, where your doctor may recommend that 
you have a repeat small intestine biopsy. These include:
 
✓ Ongoing symptoms or evidence of malabsorption. If you are having 
ongoing symptoms of celiac disease or if you have persistently low iron 
levels or other evidence of malabsorption despite following a gluten-
free diet, your doctor may first recommend you have antibody studies 
performed or alternatively, may reasonably forego this and recommend 
proceeding directly with a repeat biopsy since it is only a biopsy that 
provides definitive evidence of whether or not there is ongoing bowel 
inflammation.
 
✓ Failure of your antibodies to return to normal levels. If your celiac 
disease antibodies (see the preceding section) do not normalize despite 
what appears to be complete abstinence from gluten, a repeat biopsy 
will help determine whether, despite your careful diet, there is ongoing 
evidence of small intestine injury. If present, it is once again a matter 
of playing detective and hunting down where the ingested gluten is 
coming from.

265
 Chapter 15: Ongoing Care of Celiac Disease
 
✓ Having had no evidence of celiac disease except on a biopsy speci-
men. If when you were diagnosed with celiac disease you had no other 
features to suggest you had this condition except for a positive biopsy, 
the only way your doctor can know whether you still have active celiac 
disease is to once again perform a biopsy. (In other words if you never 
had symptoms, never had abnormal antibodies, and never had other 
abnormal lab tests, then monitoring these parameters will not be of 
value in determining whether you do or don’t have active disease; only a 
biopsy will tell the tale.)
 
✓ Involvement in a research study. If you are enrolled in a research study 
looking at new therapies for celiac disease, the study protocol will 
almost certainly involve having a follow-up biopsy. (If so, you will be 
made aware of this at the time you sign on to participate in the study.)
Some celiac disease specialists, as a matter of routine practice, recommend 
to their patients that a repeat biopsy be performed a year or two after a 
gluten-free diet has been started.
In some situations, during monitoring of your celiac disease, the TTG IgA 
level is elevated and a repeat endoscopy and small intestine biopsy are 
performed, yet — lo and behold — the pathologist finds the biopsy to show 
nothing wrong at all. This doesn’t happen often, but it can and, as we discuss 
in Chapter 3, indicates that the elevated TTG IgA level is, in this particular 
situation, not due to celiac disease, but some other health condition. This 
doesn’t mean the biopsy was for naught; on the contrary, the normal result 
provided the important information that the doctor needed to look elsewhere 
for a cause of the abnormal antibody test because celiac disease wasn’t 
responsible.
 
Here is a case where an abnormal repeat small intestine biopsy provided 
invaluable information. Ian recalls seeing a 35-year-old man who had been 
diagnosed with celiac disease five years earlier after an endoscopy and small 
intestine biopsy showed typical changes of the disease. He was treated with 
a gluten-free diet and did very well, but his symptoms had returned. Ian 
checked the patient’s blood tests and found the TTG IgA level to be elevated. 
The patient, however, was certain he was not consuming gluten. A subsequent 
small intestine biopsy nonetheless showed evidence of active damage from 
celiac disease. The mystery was solved when it was discovered that he had 
recently started taking an over-the-counter medication that, unbeknownst 
to him, contained gluten. He discontinued the medicine and soon thereafter 
started to feel much better.
 
Here is a case where a normal repeat small intestine biopsy provided 
invaluable information. Amy was an 18-year-old who was referred to Sheila 
for investigation of iron deficiency anemia. A blood test revealed that Amy had 
an elevated TTG IgA level, and a subsequent endoscopy and small intestine 
biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of celiac disease. Amy was treated with a gluten-
free diet and iron supplements, but she remained anemic. Repeat TTG IgA 

266
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
testing showed improvement, but in view of her persisting anemia, a repeat 
endoscopy and small intestine biopsy were performed. As it turned out, these 
were normal and, active bowel injury having now been excluded, it was deter-
mined that the actual cause for Amy’s ongoing anemia was not, in fact, celiac 
disease, but rather, was due to menstrual blood loss (and, as it happens, her 
having discontinued her iron supplements). Amy resumed her iron supple-
ments and within a few months her anemia resolved.
Using capsule endoscopy
As we discuss in Chapter 3, capsule endoscopy is a procedure in which you 
swallow a pill-sized camera that then transmits pictures of your gastrointesti-
nal system. Some studies have been done to determine whether this may be 
a better way to monitor the response of celiac disease to a gluten-free diet. 
At the present time, using capsule endoscopy is not common practice. (Also, 
this test is not necessarily covered by health insurance; especially if you are 
doing well on your treatment). However, if you are having ongoing difficulties 
and a regular endoscopy and biopsy can’t sort out what is wrong, then a cap-
sule study may be a good next test.
Managing Ongoing Nutrition Issues
If you felt unwell at the time you were diagnosed with celiac disease, you will 
almost certainly find that, soon after you’ve gotten on track with your gluten-
free diet, you start to feel better. Previous symptoms you may have had 
such as abdominal discomfort, diarrhea, bloating, gas, indigestion, or fatigue 
quickly ease, and abnormal body chemistry such as anemia and low vitamin 
levels also start to correct. All of this, of course, is wonderful news. There 
are, however, a few possible downsides to following a gluten-free diet includ-
ing gaining or losing weight and developing constipation. We discuss these 
issues here.
Weighty issues
As we discuss in detail in Chapter 10, adopting a gluten-free diet isn’t a simple 
matter. It requires much learning and requires great attention to pretty well 
everything that goes in your mouth.
Aside from water and a select few other beverages and foods, everything you 
eat contains energy in the form of calories. And everything a person does 
from sleeping to walking to running a marathon uses up calories. For most 
people, balancing calorie intake with calorie expenditure is a huge challenge; 

267
 Chapter 15: Ongoing Care of Celiac Disease
indeed, most North Americans tip the balance (in a manner of speaking) in 
favor of excess ingested calories for their body’s needs and, as a result, the 
majority of North Americans are overweight. Having celiac disease and fol-
lowing a gluten-free diet can add to this challenge as, at least for some people 
with this condition, it can be even harder to avoid weight gain. On the other 
hand, some people find that adopting a gluten-free diet results in losing 
weight. We look at both sides of this issue in this section.
The ideal weight ranges for height for adult men and women is known as 
body mass index (BMI), which we also discuss in Chapter 3. You can cal-
culate your BMI by using an online calculator. Many online calculators are 
available, including one you can find at www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/
assessing/bmi.
A normal BMI is 18.5 to 24.9. This range is most strongly associated with 
good health and, hence, is the target. These are the other categories:
 
✓ Less than 18.5 is considered underweight.
 
✓ 25.0 to 29.9 is called overweight.
 
✓ 30.0 to 39.9 is termed obese.
 
✓ 40.0 or more is considered morbidly obese.
Gaining weight
As we discuss in Chapter 6, some people with untreated celiac disease do 
not properly absorb nutrients into the body (a condition called malabsorp-
tion) and as a result, lose weight. When you follow a gluten-free diet, these 
nutrients — and the calories they contain — become properly used by the 
body and as a result, you may gain weight. Another reason for gaining weight 
is that eating gluten-free can sometimes lead to an increase in fat in your diet. 
We discuss this and other nutritional issues associated with a gluten-free diet 
in Chapter 11.
If you found yourself gaining weight after you started your gluten-free diet, 
you are surely not alone. Indeed, in one study from Ireland, over 80 percent 
of people with celiac disease gained weight over the 2 years after starting on 
a gluten-free diet. (Only 15 percent lost weight.)
For some people, it can seem that each calorie seems to end up on the hips. 
This can be a shock for someone who was underweight and never watched — 
or needed to watch — what they ate. If you find yourself in this situation, you 
will need to not only watch what you eat (to ensure that your diet is gluten-
free) but also how much you eat (in terms of the number of calories you are 
consuming).

268
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
 
Maurice was a fit, 30-year-old personal support worker at a nursing home. He 
was sent by his family doctor to see Ian after having been found, at the time of 
a routine physical, to be low in vitamin D. Investigations were undertaken 
and it was determined that Maurice was malabsorbing nutrients — including 
vitamin D — because his small intestine was damaged from celiac disease. Ian 
had Maurice meet with a dietitian, a gluten-free diet was successfully insti-
tuted, a vitamin D supplement was begun, and in short order Maurice’s vita-
min D level started to improve. Unfortunately, his weight also climbed. 
Maurice didn’t feel that he was over-eating and he hadn’t reduced his level of 
exercise, yet over the next 2 months, he gained 10 pounds and for the first 
time in his memory, he was overweight. Ian arranged for Maurice to meet 
again with the dietitian and it was determined that in attempts to increase his 
vitamin D levels, Maurice had been drinking an extra 6 glasses of vitamin 
D-fortified milk per day, each of which contained 120 calories. This was pro-
viding Maurice with an extra 720 calories per day! He was shocked with this 
discovery and, as he exclaimed at the time, “No wonder I’m gaining weight!” 
Maurice returned to his usual — perfectly sufficient — quantity of milk intake 
and, by following his gluten-free diet and taking a vitamin D supplement, his 
vitamin D level returned to normal while, at the same time, he lost the extra 
weight he had gained.
Because gaining weight requires an excess of calorie intake compared to 
expenditure, if you are overweight, in addition to being careful about what 
you eat, increasing the number of calories you burn is also helpful. (That is, 
as long as you avoid the trap that so many fall into of eating extra heartily as 
a reward for the exercise you just did!)
 
If you are progressively gaining weight for no ready explanation, get in touch 
with your physician. Your doctor can check to see whether you have some 
other, additional health issue — such as thyroid under-functioning (see 
Chapter 8). If not, then seeing your dietitian would be wise as she can review 
your nutrition program, including your calorie intake and expenditure, and 
help you come up with a plan to achieve and maintain a healthy weight.
 
A person with celiac disease should never, ever, intentionally resume eating 
gluten to purposefully cause malabsorption of calories in attempts to control 
one’s weight. Doing so has the potential to lead to severe health problems, 
such as progressive, severe, bowel damage, and even, potentially, cancer.
Losing weight
Although some people with celiac disease gain weight after they initiate a 
gluten-free diet, the opposite situation can also occur. If you’ve been eating 
pizza, pasta, and many other calorie-rich foods, once you go gluten-free you 
may find yourself eating less of these and also being more circumspect in 
terms of food choices. As we discuss in Chapter 10, living gluten-free typi-
cally means avoiding junk food and also often means avoiding buffet meals or 
prepared foods (because many of the items contain gluten). As a result, many 

269
 Chapter 15: Ongoing Care of Celiac Disease
people with celiac disease end up eating a healthier diet that contains more 
natural foods and fewer processed foods. The net result can be a loss in weight 
in addition to other health benefits. Although we mention this “problem” 
here, we admit that we’ve not met too many people who complain to us about 
shedding excess weight they’ve been carrying around. And as for people that 
didn’t need to lose weight, the pounds that are lost tend to be relatively few in 
number and one’s weight typically stabilizes within a few months.
 
Christine was a 22-year-old somewhat overweight woman who, having just 
graduated from college, headed off to Europe to celebrate. While she was 
enjoying the sights and sounds of Paris, to her dismay she developed abdomi-
nal cramping and diarrhea. She wondered if she’d “eaten something bad.” 
(“Can this really happen in Paris?” she wondered.) Her symptoms persisted, 
forcing her to cut her trip short. Upon her return to the United States, she 
met with her family physician who then referred her to Sheila. Tests were 
performed including an upper endoscopy and small intestine biopsy (see 
Chapter 3), and the results revealed that Christine had celiac disease. She 
began a gluten-free diet and, when she returned to see Sheila eight weeks 
later, Christine was pleased to report that not only had her symptoms gone 
away, but to her pleasant surprise she had noticed that — with her now eating 
healthier — the extra weight she had gained during her college years was dis-
appearing. When Sheila saw Christine later that year, Christine’s weight had 
stabilized at a healthy level, she was carefully following her gluten-free diet, 
and she was feeling great. She celebrated by booking a flight to Paris!
 
If, after starting a gluten-free diet, your weight progressively falls — especially 
if to the point that you are underweight — then you must see your primary 
care provider (such as your family physician) or your celiac disease specialist 
to be assessed. The problem could be as simple as you not consuming suf-
ficient calories (in which case you will then need to also see your dietitian) or 
as complicated as you having some other, undiagnosed, associated ailment 
(see Chapter 8).
Becoming constipated
If you have the classical form of celiac disease (which we discuss in 
Chapter 5), then you are well acquainted with the hassles of frequent trips to 
the bathroom with diarrhea. And we suspect you will be relieved to hear that 
following a gluten-free diet will correct this problem. Alas, although you will 
no longer have diarrhea, your new diet may lead to constipation. (Clearly, 
there is no justice here.) Indeed, regardless of what form of celiac disease 
you have, following a gluten-free diet can lead to this problem.

270
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Constipation can be severe enough that your stools become hard and infre-
quent. The only good thing we can say about this is that it is a sure sign that 
you are on track with your gluten-free diet! Now, lest you think constipation 
is your new and ongoing destiny, let us reassure you that this is not the case. 
Here are some measures you can follow to, ahem, eliminate your constipation:
 
✓ Drink more liquids. Consume at least 8 eight-ounce glasses of liquid per 
day. Also, be sure to ingest liquid-rich foods such as fruits. Be aware, 
however, that apart from water, diet soft drinks and the like, liquids 
have calories and this needs to be taken into account.
 
✓ Eat more (gluten-free) soluble and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber dis-
solves in water, and insoluble fiber does not dissolve in water. We dis-
cuss fiber in more detail in the next section.
 
✓ Exercise more. Exercise helps all aspects of one’s physical and emo-
tional health including bowel regularity.
Treating constipation with soluble fiber
Ingesting soluble fiber, the kind that dissolves in water, not only helps ease 
constipation, but it can also help improve your cholesterol (and, if you 
have diabetes, can help lower your blood glucose levels). Soluble fiber is 
found in varying quantities in all plant foods. Here are some good sources 
of soluble fiber:
 
✓ Legumes, such as peas, soybeans, and other beans.
 
✓ Oats, including oat bran. (As we discuss in detail in Chapter 2, when pur-
chasing oat-containing products be sure you are getting “pure oats,” not 
an oat product that is mixed in with other grains.)
 
✓ Some fruits and fruit juices, including prune juice, plums, berries, 
bananas, and the insides of apples and pears.
 
✓ Certain vegetables, such as broccoli, carrots, and Jerusalem artichokes.
 
✓ Root vegetables, such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, and onions. (The 
skins of these vegetables, however, are sources of insoluble fiber.)
 
✓ Psyllium seed husk. Psyllium is found in certain cereals and is widely 
available commercially in pre-packaged containers.
Treating constipation with insoluble fiber
Insoluble fiber is also known as bulk or roughage. Unlike soluble fiber, insolu-
ble fiber does not dissolve in water.

271
 Chapter 15: Ongoing Care of Celiac Disease
Here are good sources of insoluble fiber:
 
✓ Whole grains. (Remember that you can safely consume only gluten-free 
grains; we list many of these in Chapter 11.)
 
✓ Corn bran. (Again, you can safely consume only gluten-free bran prod-
ucts. Therefore, for example, you cannot consume gluten-containing 
bran products such as wheat bran.)
 
✓ Nuts and seeds
 
✓ Potato skins
 
✓ Flax seed 
 
✓ Vegetables such as green beans, cauliflower, zucchini, and celery
 
✓ The skins of some fruits, including tomatoes
Four of the five most fiber-rich plant foods are gluten-free! These are:
 
✓ Legumes (including several types of beans, lentils and peas)
 
✓ Prunes
 
✓ Asian pears
 
✓ Quinoa
A complete list of gluten-free grains and other dietary sources of fiber are dis-
cussed in Chapter 11.
Treating constipation with commercial fiber supplements
If you find getting enough fiber in your diet difficult (for whatever reason, 
including simple aversion to fiber-rich foods), then eat gluten-free fiber sup-
plements. At least 20 to 30 grams of fiber a day are recommended.
Here are some gluten-free commercial fiber supplements you can use (the 
type of fiber these supplements contain is noted in parenthesis):
 
✓ Benefiber (guar gum).
 
✓ Citrucel (methylcellulose).
 
✓ Konsyl, Metamucil (psyllium). Metamucil products are gluten-free with 
the exception of Metamucil Wafers; these contain gluten, so avoid this 
form of the product.
Generic versions of nearly all these and other brand name fiber products 
are available, but you will need to check with the manufacturer to determine 
whether a particular product is gluten-free.

272
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Treating constipation with laxatives
If you’ve followed the strategies we’ve just discussed yet you continue 
to have problems with constipation, you may need to have tests done to 
make sure no other ailment is responsible. What tests, if any, you will need 
depends on a number of factors including your age, how severe is the prob-
lem, whether you have other medical problems, whether you have previously 
had a colonoscopy, whether you have a family history of colon cancer, what 
medications you are taking (some can cause constipation), and so on.
If further investigations are either not necessary or are performed and found 
to be normal, it comes down to how best to treat your problem. This typi-
cally consists of stool softeners or laxatives or both. Your doctor can advise 
you which of the following products is best for you to take for your particular 
situation:
 
✓ Bulk flow laxatives. These contain polyethylene glycol (PEG) and work 
by causing better flow of the feces. (Hmm, too much information?) 
These products contain smaller amounts of the same compounds used 
in the large volume clean-out preparations for colonoscopy. These are 
available over-the-counter (that is, without a prescription) and are very 
safe and effective.
 
✓ Osmotic laxatives. Milk of magnesium is an example of an osmotic laxa-
tive. Osmotic laxatives work by promoting accumulation of water within 
the bowel. (This is termed an osmotic effect.) They are available over-
the-counter and are safe as long as you do not exceed standard doses. 
Drinking plenty of liquids is recommended when you take this type of 
laxative.
 
✓ Stimulant laxatives. These work by stimulating the intestine to con-
tract and push materials along. Examples of these products are Ex-Lax, 
Senekot, Doxidan (casanthranol), and Dulcolax (bisacodyl). It is okay to 
use these on occasion, but they are not safe for long-term use because, if 
used in this way, the colon can become damaged.
 
✓ Stool softeners. Stool softeners such as Colace and Surfak contain a 
medicine called docusate. Stool softeners have a mild stimulant action 
and, though okay to use for short periods of time, they are best not used 
chronically.
 
See your health care provider if in spite of these measures you have severe 
constipation (bowel movements once or twice a week or even less), if you 
develop rectal bleeding, if you have severe abdominal pain, or if it appears 
that you have become obstructed (nothing, not even gas, is coming out). 
These symptoms may signify you have a serious medical problem that 
requires prompt attention.

 Chapter 15: Ongoing Care of Celiac Disease
Falling Off the Diet
As you continue your journey with gluten-free living, you may find yourself 
tempted, at times, to either abandon or, at the very least not fully adhere to 
your gluten-free diet. If you feel this way, you’re in very good company. Many 
other people with celiac disease feel the same way. Nevertheless, we strongly 
encourage you not to “give in to temptation” or, if you have, to as quickly as 
possible get back to being gluten-free again.
The problem with resuming the consumption of gluten is that it will lead 
to the redevelopment of damage to your intestine, can cause symptoms 
of celiac disease to reappear, and may lead to the serious condition called 
refractory celiac disease (which we discuss in Chapter 11) that causes dread-
ful symptoms and increases your risk of cancer (specifically, a form of 
immune system cancer called EATCL which we discuss in detail in Chapter 9). 
For all these reasons — and at the risk of sounding redundant — we strongly 
advise against resuming any gluten ingestion.
 
Don’t fall victim to the illusion — which we recognize can so easily happen — 
of believing that, if you’ve resumed consuming gluten yet you feel well that 
everything therefore must be alright. This simply isn’t the case. You may feel 
perfectly fine (at least initially anyhow) all the while your small intestine and, 
potentially other parts of your body, are being progressively damaged.
We recognize that all this may sound pretty scary. We also recognize that 
the simple fact of human nature remains that following a gluten-free diet (or, 
for that matter, many other forms of restricted diet) can be very tough and 
that, people being people, you may find yourself at times not only tempted to 
fall off the gluten-free wagon, but actually doing just that. Many people with 
celiac disease do indeed have periods of time where this occurs. To put it 
succinctly, life happens.
If you find yourself in this situation, then we have two things to share. One, 
to paraphrase the famous song (“Pick Yourself Up”), what you need to do is 
pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and start living gluten-free all over again. 
And two, not that we’d ever counsel people with celiac disease to even fleet-
ingly resume eating gluten (because we don’t and never would), but, having 
said that, so long as you get back on track right away and so long as the 
period of time for which you were consuming gluten was very brief, you’ll 
likely be fine.
 
People with celiac disease are less likely to fall off their gluten-free diet if they 
have the support of others; not just family, but also membership in a celiac 
disease support group. We suggest you consider joining such a group. For 
many people joining a group is hugely helpful. Your celiac disease specialist 
or dietitian may be able to tell you of a group local to you. Another option is to 
join an online discussion group. In Appendix B, we list some organizations for 
people living with celiac disease.

Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Taking Charge of Your Celiac Health
As we emphasize throughout this book, we want you to have control over 
your own health and, in particular, control over your celiac disease. We bet 
you feel the same way or you wouldn’t be reading this book right now! In this 
section we share with you some tips on how you can empower yourself by 
ensuring you get the best possible care from your celiac disease health care 
providers. We also discuss being an advocate for you or your loved one with 
celiac disease in matters that extend beyond routine health care.
(How passionately do we feel about the importance of patients being empow-
ered through knowledge? Well, suffice to say that Sheila counsels people 
around the country on this topic and Ian has even written a book on the 
subject. Years ago, he wrote What Your Doctor Really Thinks: Diagnosing the 
Doctor-Patient Relationship.)
Preparing for your appointment with your 
celiac disease specialist
Just like the Boy Scouts motto, when it comes to your forthcoming appoint-
ment with your celiac disease specialist — especially if it is your first visit — 
be prepared. Being prepared helps ensure you — and your doctor for that 
matter — get the most out of your visit and sets the stage for future good 
care.
Here are some ways you can help make your visit to the doctor a success:
 
✓ Bring your records. Bring written records of your prior medical history 
including previous test results. (This is only necessary for your first visit 
to the doctor.)
 
✓ Bring your medications. Bring all your prescription and non-prescription 
drugs with you in their original containers. (Bringing a list is not 
as helpful as even the most carefully itemized lists are notoriously 
inaccurate.)
 
✓ Bring someone with you. Bring a loved one or trusted friend with you to 
act as a second set of ears. (See the next section for more information.)
 
✓ Bring questions. Write down questions you have prior to the visit. That 
way you won’t forget your questions when you’re at your appointment. 
(Also, make notes during the visit and write down questions as you think 
of them.)

275
 Chapter 15: Ongoing Care of Celiac Disease
 
✓ Arrive sufficiently early. Arrive ahead of time for your appointment, 
but understand that the doctor may be running late. Often this is due to 
the fact that the physician is spending extra time with sick patients, and 
you can be confident they would do the same with you. Bring a book or 
other way to spend time in case your appointment is delayed.
 
✓ Bring resources you’ve read. If you want to educate your heath care 
provider, feel free to bring with you information you’ve read — and you 
want them to see, but be as sure as you can that the information you’re 
about to share is reliable; otherwise, you may find your doctor discount-
ing your concerns. (By way of example, bringing in a newspaper clipping 
discussing a recent scientific publication about which you have ques-
tions is a great idea. Bringing in a printed page from Uncle Joe’s Miracle 
Cure for Celiac Disease Web site is, well, hmm, not such a great idea.)
 
Before you leave the appointment, be sure to also prepare for what comes 
next. Are you to go to the lab for blood tests? Are you supposed to call the 
office to report on your progress? Are you to book a return visit with the 
doctor? Knowing what you are to do is essential; trust us, you don’t want to 
risk being “lost in the shuffle.” Your doctor or her staff will likely spontane-
ously bring up the answers to these questions before you leave. If, however, 
she hasn’t, be sure to bring them up yourself with the office staff.
Knowing what to ask your doctor
Asking questions when you visit with your doctor is always a good idea. And, 
of course, your questions will only help you if they get proper answers! If 
what you are told is confusing or does not make sense, ask for clarification. 
It’s your health after all, and you deserve to have sufficiently clear answers 
given to you.
Here are some questions to consider asking your doctor (if they didn’t 
happen to get discussed routinely when you spoke with your physician):
 
✓ Is my diagnosis of celiac disease certain or is there an element of doubt? 
If an element of doubt exists, how is this going to be sorted out?
 
✓ What kinds of tests will I need to have done to monitor my celiac dis-
ease? How often will these need to be done?
 
✓ When do I need to see you again? How often, if at all, will I need to be 
seen by you on an ongoing basis?
 
✓ What symptoms should I look out for? What should I do if they develop? 
Who should I call if they occur?

276
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
 
We are strong believers in having two sets of ears present during your first 
visits to your celiac disease specialist. During these early appointments, a 
great deal of information is being shared and questions like those just listed 
are most likely to come up. At this time in the process, people are most likely 
to be nervous and thus least likely to retain information. Bring a loved one or 
trusted friend with you to your doctor’s appointment; you’ll be glad you did.
Becoming an expert on your condition
We hope that you find this book to be a helpful resource to allow you to 
master your celiac disease (or to allow you to help a loved one master his 
condition). Indeed, we’d be disappointed if you don’t. We also hope that you 
will avail yourself of the myriad resources available to you on the Web. The 
Internet is an incredible storehouse of information on celiac disease (and 
every other topic under the sun). The Internet is, however, also an incredibly 
large repository of misinformation, so you must tread with care and not be 
taken in by “experts” who are out to take you for a financial ride by offering 
some (useless) “miracle therapy” for celiac disease. It’s also very important 
to take with a very large grain of salt those Internet sources that offer exper-
tise (or even just plain opinion) without providing any scientific references or 
background to support their statements.
To help you find reputable information online, have a look at Chapter 2, as 
well as Appendix A where we list good Web sites that provide celiac disease 
information and Appendix B where we list celiac disease organizations and 
centers you may want to contact.
Being an Advocate for 
Your Celiac Health
Celiac disease is a condition in which you, the person living with the condi-
tion, is largely in charge of your own treatment. You should also feel empow-
ered to advocate for yourself to make sure you receive the care that you (or a 
loved one who cannot advocate for himself or herself) deserves.
The first step to being an effective advocate is being knowledgeable about 
your condition, so we’re glad you’re reading this book. Making sure that you 
get the medical care you need is also critical. In the previous few sections, 
we look at how to help ensure productive sessions with your doctor. In the 
following sections, we discuss some other situations you may encounter and 
how you can effectively advocate for yourself.

277
 Chapter 15: Ongoing Care of Celiac Disease
Dealing with insurance companies
Two main situations exist where an insurer may deny you coverage for cer-
tain celiac disease-related care: When you are seeking reimbursement for 
genetic testing and when you are looking for medical health insurance. We 
discuss these and other insurance-related issues in this section.
Getting insurance coverage for genetic testing for celiac disease
As we discuss in Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, testing for the HLA DQ2 and DQ8 
genes can be very helpful in both diagnosing and screening for celiac disease. 
Insurance companies may, however, not cover you or your family members 
to have these tests done.
In this circumstance, you can try to persuade your insurer to change its mind 
by pointing out that performing these genetic tests may actually save money 
in the long run. For example, if a child is screened for celiac disease — and 
found not to be at risk for it — by testing for (and finding they don’t have) the 
HLA DQ2 or DQ8 genes, the child will not, as a rule, need to have repeated 
antibody screening testing done every few years until adulthood).
Getting health insurance
When you apply for health insurance, the insurer will typically ask whether 
you have any known (so-called pre-existing) health issues.
There is often a perfectly understandable rationale for this as the insurer 
wants to protect its investment. (By way of extreme example to make a point, 
an insurer would likely not grant you a million dollar life insurance policy if 
you had but days to live.) The thing is, however, your having celiac disease 
doesn’t make you a bad investment. Heck, you may be a great investment!
If your insurer needs convincing of your being a suitable candidate for health 
insurance, try pointing out that a person with treated celiac disease is as 
healthy as or, because of necessarily needing to eat healthfully, perhaps even 
healthier than the average North American.
Getting insurance coverage for visits to the dietitian
Seeing a dietitian is essential if you are to be knowledgeable about how to 
live gluten-free. Unfortunately, despite this fact, celiac disease is not a condi-
tion for which insurance coverage for a visit to a dietitian is mandated by law 
in the United States. Unless this situation changes, you need to pay out of 
pocket for such a visit. (In Canada, visits to a dietitian are typically paid for 
by the government insurance plan as long as the appointment is with a dieti-
tian working in a hospital.)

278
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Having your doctor help you 
advocate for yourself
Your doctor can arm you with information that will help you advocate for 
yourself. Most often this is in the form of a letter that spells out important 
information such as:
 
✓ Your diagnosis
 
✓ Your treatment plan
 
✓ How long you’ve been under their care
 
✓ Your treatment costs including:
 
• The extra costs of buying gluten-free foods
 
• The need for extra travel (for example, to and from appointments 
with the doctor)
 
✓ The doctor’s invitation (with your permission of course) to speak to 
relevant third parties (such as a potential insurer) on your behalf
This letter should be printed on the doctor’s letterhead and signed by the 
doctor. Make an extra copy (or copies) of the letter to use as you need and 
keep the original in a safe place.
 
Remember to ask your doctor to update the letter periodically; especially if 
you will need it for tax purposes or for travel out of the country.
Handling hospitalizations
As a well-informed patient, you know how to look after your celiac disease. 
Indeed, it is often the case that a person with celiac disease knows more 
than the average health care provider including those working in hospitals. 
For this reason, if you are in the hospital, you need to work especially hard 
at being your own best advocate. Here are some ways you can advocate for 
yourself from within a hospital:
 
✓ Tell all your health care providers including doctors, nurses, dietitians, 
and so forth that you have celiac disease.
 
✓ Before you eat anything that is brought to you, ensure the tag on the 
food tray states that the food is gluten-free.

279
 Chapter 15: Ongoing Care of Celiac Disease
 
✓ Tell the clerk who admits you to hospital that you need to eat a gluten-
free diet. You may find it helps to tell them you are “allergic” to gluten, 
wheat, rye, and barley products.
 
✓ Bring to the hospital copies of an information sheet on celiac disease. 
(Many of the celiac societies and organizations — see Appendix B — 
have these for their members.) You can then hand these out to the 
members of the health care team that are looking after you.
 
✓ Tell the doctors and nurses looking after you (especially the nurse 
dispensing your medications to you) that you can only take gluten-
free medications. (Be prepared for blank looks; many otherwise well-
informed health care providers will be hearing this for the first time.)
 
✓ Ask for a dietitian to visit with you. He will help ensure you get a gluten-
free diet while you’re in hospital.
 
✓ If the admission is not an emergency, you may want to bring some 
gluten-free supplies with you, including crackers, cereals, and breakfast 
bars. However, before you eat any food you’ve brought make sure to ask 
the doctor or nurse whether it is okay for you to eat. Sometimes tests, 
health issues, or other reasons require you to not eat anything at all for 
a period of time.
Selecting a nursing home
Finding a suitable nursing home is invariably a challenge even at the best of 
times. Add in the extra needs of a person with celiac disease, and finding a 
good place can be especially challenging.
Here are some ways you can help ease the process of finding a nursing home 
for yourself or a loved one with celiac disease:
 
✓ Plan well ahead; it may take visits to a number of different facilities 
before you find one that meets your needs.
 
✓ Partner with a loved one or close friend who can help advocate for you.
 
✓ Interview the nursing home administration and, if possible, some of 
the staff, to ensure they are sufficiently knowledgeable about — and 
comfortable with — celiac disease and, in particular, what a gluten-free 
diet is. If they tell you that they “can’t guarantee your food will always 
be gluten-free,” then run for cover; this place isn’t for you.
We list contact information to obtain assistance resolving nursing home 
problems in Appendix A.

What the Future May Hold
In This Chapter
▶ Developing better ways of determining the risk of getting celiac disease
▶ Improving the tests used to diagnose celiac disease
▶ Discovering new treatments for celiac disease
▶ Preventing celiac disease
▶ Increasing awareness of celiac disease
▶ Furthering the research of celiac disease
S
heila and her husband Peter are quite sure that if Kay Ernst, Peter’s 
mother who co-founded the Canadian Celiac Association in 1972 and 
passed away in 2002, were alive today she would not believe the changes that 
have recently occurred in the world of celiac disease. So much has happened 
to advance the scientific understanding of celiac disease, its diagnosis, how 
commonly it occurs, the different ways it presents, and perhaps most impor-
tantly of all, the greater availability of more and better quality gluten-free 
foods. It is clear that if things continue to advance at the rate they have, the 
future for people living with celiac disease will be brighter and brighter.
In this chapter, we look at what this bright future may hold. Now we’re the 
first to admit that predicting the future is, at the best of times, a fanciful thing 
to do. And we wouldn’t want for one moment to suggest that all the things 
we discuss in this chapter are going to happen or even predict when any of 
them will happen. But we also wouldn’t want to leave the impression that the 
status quo will persist indefinitely. It won’t. Indeed, in one form or another, 
better and better ways of managing celiac disease will emerge. Doctors don’t 
typically guarantee much, but this, indeed, we will guarantee.
In this chapter, we mention a number of different research studies that are 
underway. If you would like to keep abreast of these and other celiac disease 
studies, check out www.clinicaltrials.gov. This excellent Web site 
contains a huge inventory of medical studies on all manner of subjects, so to 
narrow your search to just those studies on celiac disease, enter that term

Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Devising Better Ways of Determining 
Your Risk of Getting Celiac Disease
As we discuss in Chapter 2, the genes a person is born with (conceived with, 
actually) predict many things about that person’s future, including skin color, 
eye color, and, most relevant to this discussion, much of their risk for getting 
certain diseases including celiac disease. Celiac disease is triggered by expo-
sure to gluten, but this only happens if you are susceptible to celiac disease 
in the first place and this susceptibility is directly related to your genetic 
makeup.
One of the most robust and exciting areas of medical research these days 
is the field of genetics. With each passing day, more and more discoveries 
are being made. In terms of celiac disease, over the past few years scientists 
have discovered increasing numbers of genes that are linked to the risk of 
a person getting this condition. It’s only a matter of time before this stream 
of discoveries leads to the ability to precisely identify who is and who is not 
at risk for celiac disease. And, armed with this information, a person with a 
very high (or near certain) risk of getting celiac disease has a whole range of 
options available to help him or her avoid running into problems related to 
celiac disease, including being able to
 
✓ Avoid gluten from day one. No gluten exposure, no risk of developing 
gluten-induced damage to the body.
 
✓ Monitor for evidence that celiac disease has developed so that it can be 
picked up early on, before it’s had a chance to take a toll on the person 
that has it.
 
✓ Intervene with other, novel therapies, perhaps even curative ones. (If 
you knew, based on your genes, it was a certainty you were going to 
develop celiac disease, would you submit to experimental therapy to 
“cure” it before it happens? Perhaps yes, perhaps no; either way, this 
type of genetic knowledge would give you the ability to at least consider 
the option.)
Finding Out Why Genetically Susceptible 
People Get Celiac Disease
As we discuss in Chapter 2, people with certain genes, most notably the HLA 
DQ2 and DQ8 genes, are at increased risk for developing celiac disease. If you 
have neither of these genes, you have virtually no risk of developing celiac 
disease. The converse, however, is not true; that is, if you have these genes 
you will not necessarily develop celiac disease.

283
 Chapter 16: What the Future May Hold
Why does having certain genes make a person more susceptible to celiac 
disease (and why does the absence of these genes seemingly protect against 
getting it)? The quick answer is no one knows for sure. The more complex 
answer is that certain genes in people with celiac disease likely influence the 
behavior of their white blood cells (actually a particular type of white blood 
cell called a T cell) leading these cells, when they come across gluten pro-
tein, to think they’ve come across a foreign invader (like a bacteria) rather 
than recognizing gluten for what it is: a nutrient. The T cells’ “intruder alert, 
intruder alert” announcement triggers an immune response, and the small 
intestine becomes damaged as a result. So that’s the bad news.
The good news is that scientists are learning more and more about how the 
immune system of a person with celiac disease responds to gluten exposure. 
Armed with this knowledge, doctors can use novel therapies to target the 
immune problem seen with celiac disease, thereby preventing gluten from 
triggering the condition. (“Ah,” a naysayer may say, “why mess around with 
the immune system when all you have to do is avoid eating gluten.” To which 
we would respond, you’re right . . . except that millions of people with celiac 
disease either don’t follow this advice or, try as they might, still inadvertently 
ingest gluten and become ill as a result; therefore, we need to find better 
treatment strategies.)
Over the past few years, using a scientific method called genome wide analy-
sis study (GWAS), scientists have discovered a number of other genes that 
put a person at increased risk of developing celiac disease. It is unclear why 
or how these genes lead to this risk, but future research will undoubtedly 
clarify this.
Some of these gene discoveries may shed light on associations between 
celiac disease and other conditions. For example, the 10 non-HLA genes iden-
tified by GWAS thus far include some that are also found in people with a 
type of inflammatory bowel disease called Crohn disease. Is this coincidence 
or is there some link between these two diseases? The answer is unknown 
at present, but future research will likely sort this out. Understanding these 
genes may also lead to better diagnostic tests. At present, the only way to 
definitively diagnose celiac disease is by performing a small intestine biopsy 
(as we discuss in Chapter 3); perhaps in the future, a simple blood test will 
be sufficiently accurate, and performing these other procedures will not be 
necessary. (We look at this further in the next section.)

Dr. Cisca Wijmenga and her European collaborators, leading researchers in 
this field. Visit www.rug.nl and type her name in the search engine located

Improving Ways to Diagnose 
and Monitor Celiac Disease
As medical science and medical technology continue their rapid advance, 
newer and better ways of diagnosing and monitoring celiac disease are evolv-
ing. We discuss these here.
Better ways to diagnose celiac disease
As we discuss in Chapter 3, the only definitive way to diagnose celiac disease 
is by performing an endoscopy and small intestine biopsy. Blood tests that 
are currently available, though very helpful, are simply not sufficiently accu-
rate to do away with the need for these other procedures.
There is ongoing research looking for more accurate antibody blood tests 
to help diagnose celiac disease. Although an endoscopy and small intestine 
biopsy aren’t by any means particularly unpleasant procedures, they do 
require you to give up some time to visit a clinic, and it would certainly be far 
better if a simple blood test could instead be done.
It may turn out that antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP; see 
Chapter 3) when combined with other available antibody tests prove to be 
sufficiently accurate to allow for a definitive diagnosis without need for a 
small intestine biopsy. Even if not, with time other precise diagnostic tests 
will undoubtedly become available.
Better ways to monitor celiac disease that 
isn’t responding to a gluten-free diet
When it comes to monitoring celiac disease, if you have ongoing or recur-
ring unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms, your doctor may recommend 
an endoscopy so that he can directly visualize what is the state of affairs in 
your stomach and small intestine. An endoscopy (see Chapter 3) may not be 
particularly unpleasant, but, curious medical students aside, we don’t know 
too many people who would line up to swallow a four-foot long rubber hose if 
an easier alternative were available. At the present time, no other equivalent 
or better option exists to routinely provide the type of images that are seen 
with an endoscope, but newer ways are now playing a role in select situations 
including refractory celiac disease (see Chapter 12) and cancer of the intes-
tine (Chapter 9).

285
 Chapter 16: What the Future May Hold
As time goes by, these emerging procedures will become increasingly sophis-
ticated and increasingly used. Further studies are needed to assess how best 
to use the new technologies in monitoring celiac disease and to determine 
whether the endoscopic findings using a technique known as confocal micros-
copy may one day be able to replace the need for a biopsy. One limitation 
of the more advanced scoping procedures, such as double balloon enteros-
copy, is that they are time-consuming. Fortunately, technology is continually 
improving, and in the future, better instruments and techniques, including 
better capsule endoscopy (see Chapter 3), will become available.
Developing New Treatments 
for Celiac Disease
The proven, highly effective way to treat celiac disease is to follow a gluten-
free diet. There are millions upon millions of people — likely including 
yourself — who know this and do this. But we suspect that, given the choice, 
most of these people would happily return to consuming a full diet if they 
could safely do so. If you also feel that way, we’re happy to tell you that there 
is a bit of light at the end of the gluten-free tunnel. In this section, we look at 
current research efforts being made toward finding celiac disease therapies 
that would allow you to once again consume gluten.
Reducing intestinal exposure to gluten
Have you ever seen a parent bird regurgitate some food and then drop it 
into the waiting mouth of its offspring? Well, maybe we can learn some-
thing from them. While we wouldn’t want to suggest that human moms and 
dads should — yuck! — pre-digest food for their kids with celiac disease, if 
we could achieve this same effect by use of digestive enzymes, this could, 
perhaps, allow for affected individuals to ingest gluten. In what is clearly a 
great bit of lateral thinking, scientists are looking at just this trick; that is, 
rather than avoiding gluten, one would ingest special enzymes that would 
do the work of digestion for you, and by the time the gluten hit your gut, it 
would have been transformed into smaller proteins that wouldn’t trigger the 
immune response (and subsequent bowel damage) that is seen with celiac 
disease.
Even if it turns out that this type of therapy isn’t able to completely and rou-
tinely replace your gluten-free diet, it could still be a great help in a pinch. 
Let’s say, for example, that you’re in a restaurant or at a party or maybe even 
at home and, having just swallowed a mouthful of some scrumptious treat, 
it suddenly dawns on you that it may have contained gluten. All you’d need 

286
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
to do is reach into your pocket or purse, pull out your enzyme supplement 
and swallow it. (If you’re familiar with the treatment of lactose intolerance — 
which we discuss in Chapter 11 — you may note some similarities. Lactose 
intolerance is a condition in which one lacks an enzyme called lactase. One 
form of therapy for this condition is to swallow an oral enzyme supplement 
when you’re consuming lactose.)
 
The enzymes that are currently being tested are called prolyl endopeptidases 
and are found in nature in plants and microorganisms. Two such products are 
currently being tested in clinical studies; ALV-003 from Alvine Pharmaceuticals 
in the U.S. and ANPEP developed at VU University in the Netherlands. The 
research that led to ALV-003 was the work of Dr. Chaitan Khosla at Stanford 
University, an accomplished professor who turned his attention to celiac dis-
ease research after his son, and, subsequently, his wife were found to have 
celiac disease. Sometimes necessity truly is the mother of invention!
We’re very excited about the potential of this form of therapy. Although it 
wouldn’t be a cure, it could make living with celiac disease immeasurably easier.
Decreasing gluten uptake 
by the intestinal wall
If you have celiac disease, greater than normal quantities of gluten can be 
taken up through the leakier intestine present with active celiac disease. 
The taking up of more gluten stimulates the immune system and results in 
damage to the lining of the small intestine, which in turn can cause symp-
toms such as diarrhea. As we discuss in Chapter 2, the specific component of 
gluten that is responsible for triggering the abnormal immune response is gli-
adin. Scientists have discovered a protein called zonulin which appears to be 
a factor in this process. The thinking is that, in celiac disease, ingesting glia-
din leads to zonulin release which makes the bowel wall more porous (leaky). 
This allows more gluten to get into the intestinal tissues where it can cause 
activation of the immune system which in turn leads to intestinal damage.
Dr. Alessio Fasano and his colleagues at the University of Maryland wondered 
if, by interfering with how zonulin works, a person with celiac disease would 
have less uptake of gluten by the intestinal wall (and, thus, less intestinal 
damage). Acting on this suspicion, they discovered a small protein called lar-
azotide that inhibits the action of zonulin. This protein (also called AT-1001) 
has been developed as a potential treatment for celiac disease by Alba 
Therapeutics Corporation, USA. Preliminary clinical studies with larazotide 
have shown favorable results in terms of reducing the levels of IgA tissue trans-
glutaminase antibody in people with celiac disease. (As we discuss in detail in 
Chapter 3, the level of this antibody typically parallels the degree of ongoing 
intestinal damage caused by celiac disease.) We look forward to further studies 
to determine if this is both a safe and effective therapy. Stay tuned.

287
 Chapter 16: What the Future May Hold
Changing the immune response to gluten
Because celiac disease is related to a problem 
with the immune system (see Chapter 2), one 
theoretical way of handling this ailment would 
be to get the immune system to stop malfunc-
tioning when exposed to gluten. If immune 
system therapy were to be helpful, there are 
several places this system could be targeted 
including:
 ✓ Blocking tissue transglutaminase enzyme. 
Doing so would make gliadin (gliadin is a 
component of gluten; see Chapter 2) less 
likely to stimulate the immune system and, 
hence, there would be less small intestine 
injury. Laboratory research is underway at 
Numerate, Inc., and Stanford University to 
develop this as a potential treatment.
 ✓ Blocking the action of proteins made 
by the HLA DQ2 or DQ8 genes. Doing so 
would reduce the T cell immune response 
to gluten and result in less damage to the 
intestine. Researchers at Leiden University 
in the Netherlands and at Stanford 
University have created molecules that, by 
mimicking gluten, may be able to block the 
effects of HLA DQ2.
 ✓ Blocking T cells or the T cell receptor 
(TCR). By blocking T cells or the T cell 
receptor (this is a molecule on the sur-
face of T cells), the T cell is prevented 
from reacting to gluten (so-called immune 
tolerance). One example of how to do this 
is to use an altered type of gliadin which 
blocks the immune response to normal 
gliadin. This is called peptide therapy and 
recent pilot studies in a species of mouse 
show this approach to hold real promise. 
This strategy is being applied to humans 
with celiac disease by an Australian com-
pany, Nexpep, that has developed Nexvax2, 
which contains gluten peptides that will 
induce immune tolerance to gluten.
 ✓ Blocking the migration of so-called killer 
T cells into the intestine. Blocking the 
migration of “killer T cells” into the intes-
tine may prevent damage to the intestine. 
A compound that blocks T cell migration, 
CCX282-B from ChemoCentryx, is being 
tested for its effect in celiac disease in 
clinical studies in Finland.
 ✓ Promoting a different T cell response 
to gliadin. The typical T cell response in 
celiac disease is called a T helper 1 (Th1) 
response. It is thought that by switch-
ing this to a T helper 2 (Th2) response the 
effect of gliadin will be lessened. Allergies 
and parasite infections naturally cause 
Th2 responses. One way to make the body 
develop a Th2 response is through infec-
tion with parasites. This has been used with 
some success in Crohn disease. Scientists 
in Brisbane, Australia have launched a 
study using a hookworm called Necatur 
americanus which is inoculated into the 
skin of people with celiac disease. Sure 
doesn’t sound pretty, but, hey if it is found 
to work safely and effectively that’s okay 
with us!
 ✓ Modulate the way in which specific cyto-
kines, which are part of the immune response 
to gluten (as discussed in Chapter 2), act on 
the intestinal lining. The hope is that this 
will diminish the intestinal damage that 
arises in patients with celiac disease.
Modifying the immune response to gluten is 
attractive in concept but, at this stage in the 
evolution of medical science, is not yet tested 
in humans. Also, because it is not known how 
one could selectively change the immune 
system only within the gut, there would be dan-
gers that the immune system in the rest of the 
body would be adversely affected by this form 
of treatment.

Preventing Celiac Disease: When to 
Introduce Gluten in a Child’s Diet
It is highly controversial whether or not celiac disease may be avoided by 
specifically timing when to first introduce gluten-containing foods into a 
child’s diet. Some studies suggest that early exposure to gluten increases the 
risk of celiac disease. And, just to confuse everyone, other studies suggest 
that early exposure to gluten decreases the risk of celiac disease. Gee, glad 
that’s clear. Hmm.
Fortunately, there are currently studies underway in the United States, 
Finland, and Italy which, upon their completion, will hopefully tell us which 
of these opposite strategies is the better one.
We discuss this topic in detail in Chapter 14.
Increasing Public Awareness
Not so very long ago, when celiac disease was thought to be a rare disease, 
relatively little attention was paid to it (by lay and professional people alike). 
Nowadays, however, armed with evidence that far more people are affected 
by celiac disease than was formerly thought, there is heightened awareness 
of the condition not only by the public, but also by the medical and scientific 
communities and, importantly, the press, too. In this section, we look at some 
of the implications of this.
Public awareness and public policy
For better or worse, it is a simple fact of life that if a disease garners lots of 
public attention, there is an increased likelihood that politicians and other 
health care and research funders will also pay attention and provide more 
robust financial support for researching and treating the condition. In terms 
of celiac disease, its increasing prominence in the public eye has enhanced 
the relative importance given to it by governments and other bodies that 
determine priorities for how research dollars are spent and medical care 
monies used. All this attention can only help lead to better ways to prevent, 
diagnose, treat, and, hopefully, one day cure celiac disease. To which we 
simply say: Thank goodness!
One example of how advocacy can make a difference is illustrated by the 
proactive actions of members of the University of Virginia’s Celiac Support 
Group, the CharlottesVILLI. Members of this group make a point of keeping 
abreast of social and political developments in the celiac disease world and 

289
 Chapter 16: What the Future May Hold
as a result knew of New York Congresswoman Nita Lowey’s re-introducing 
legislation recognizing May as National Celiac Awareness Month. (This 
bill also proposes to educate other lawmakers about celiac disease.) 
CharlottesVILLI members as well as many other members of celiac disease 
support groups in the U.S. have helped support this important bill by writing 
to their Representatives.
 
Like the actions that the CharlottesVILLI and other support groups undertook? 
So do we. Perhaps, then, if you’re not a member of a support group or another 
celiac disease organization (we list a number of these in Appendix B), you may 
want to consider joining one in your community. If none exists, maybe you’ll 
want to look at starting one or, alternatively, joining an online group.
Grass roots organizations, advocacy groups, education, patience, and per-
sistence have all contributed to bringing a once little known condition to the 
attention of health care providers, politicians, and the public.
Public awareness, information, 
and misinformation
There has been a virtual explosion in the number of Web sites (see Appendix 
A for a listing of some of these) and organizations (see Appendix B for a list-
ing of some of these) that focus on celiac disease. This is wonderful in so 
many ways (knowledge is power after all), but as with any explosion there 
can be untoward consequences.
The trouble with Web sites
The greater the number of Web sites and online discussion groups, the more 
likely it is that misinformation will creep in and potentially mislead people 
living with celiac disease. For example, some sites say one thing about what 
constitutes a gluten-free diet and other sites say very different things. We see 
no solution to this — the Internet is (as it should be in our opinion) a place of 
great freedom for the delivery of information — except to advise caution to 
always question not only the information one reads on the Internet, but the 
source of the information.
The difficulty with organizations and groups
Different celiac disease organizations sometimes offer very different and con-
flicting advice to their members on topics such as whether or not a person 
with celiac disease can safely consume buckwheat (you can) or vinegar 
(again, you can, so long as it’s not malt vinegar).
Different celiac disease support groups sometimes offer discrepant informa-
tion regarding the inclusion of oats into the diet. (Oats are almost always 
okay for a person with celiac disease to consume so long as they are not 

290
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
contaminated with other grains; in other words, they need to be “pure oats.”) 
Another unfortunate discrepancy is in regard to whether or not it is safe to 
use gluten-containing topical products such as some lotions, shampoos, and 
soaps. (It most certainly is as long as you don’t drink the stuff!) This misinfor-
mation can still be found in printed and online information of some support 
groups, but we hope this will be changed soon.
As you can likely imagine (or perhaps have already experienced), getting 
conflicting information or advice can be terribly frustrating and leave you not 
knowing what to do.
There can be a number of reasons behind well-intentioned and well-meaning 
organizations and groups providing less than fully accurate information. 
One thing’s for certain: It is not the result of malicious intent. Here are a few 
reasons why people and groups who are trying to be helpful sometimes get 
things wrong:
 
✓ As most people have done themselves in other contexts, when one feels 
strongly about something, opinion sometimes manages to get in the way 
of the facts.
 
✓ Even when one has the facts straight, they can, at times, be interpreted 
in different ways.
 
✓ Scientific discoveries typically occur in research laboratories and 
are generally of a “basic science” nature, meaning that what has been 
found is something to do with molecules, genes, cells, and so on, not 
flesh and blood people. These discoveries can take ten or more years 
to lead to clinical applications (that is, therapy you can actually use). 
Unfortunately, what so often happens is that these very early, very 
preliminary discoveries, which are of uncertain ultimate value, are inter-
preted by the press and then by the world at large as being far more 
definitive and having far greater implications than they often actually do.
Making sense of new information
This is what we recommend you do when you either read about some new 
“discovery” in the world of celiac disease. (Or, as so often happens, when it is 
a loved one or concerned friend who shares the news with you. “Hey Jim, did 
you see the news? There’s a cure for celiac disease.” “Thanks Bob; yup, that’s 
the tenth cure I’ve heard about this month.”):
 
1. Be skeptical — optimistic, but skeptical.
 
2. Check out the details.
 
 Is it really a new discovery or just another article rehashing old data?
 
3. Assess the validity of the source of the information.

291
 Chapter 16: What the Future May Hold
 
 Is it, for example, an article in The New York Times (a good sign that it’s 
reliable) or was it on an anonymous online blog (in which case its reli-
ability would be far more suspect)?
 
4. Discuss the findings with your celiac disease specialist.
 
 They’ll almost certainly be aware of the information and can shed fur-
ther light on it. Nonetheless, in this information age, it is possible that 
you’ve found something before he or she has, so be sure to bring a 
printed copy of the information you found and show it to the doctor.
Identifying Areas for 
Further Investigation
Huge strides have been made in the field of celiac disease in the past number 
of years. Indeed, a mind boggling array of discoveries have been made includ-
ing in (but certainly not limited to) the following fields (Note: We discuss 
each of the topics in this list in Chapter 2 and, in the case of zonulin, also see 
the discussion in the section “Decreasing gluten uptake by the intestinal wall” 
earlier this chapter):
 
✓ Genetics. For example, the discovery of the role of the HLA DQ2 and 
DQ8 genes.
 
✓ Immunology. For example, the discovery of the tissue transglutaminase 
antibody.
 
✓ Epidemiology (the study of diseases within population groups). For 
example, the discovery that celiac disease is much more prevalent than 
was formerly thought. 
 
✓ Pathogenesis (the study of how diseases develop). For example, the 
determination of the role of zonulin.
Armed with this new information, doctors are now better able to diagnose, 
screen for, and treat celiac disease.
In spite of all these exciting developments, there are lots of things that 
remain unknown. Fortunately, there are many, many scientists and clinical 
researchers busily working on filling in the numerous gaps that exist.
Though many areas of celiac disease research are needed, and at the risk — 
egads — of offending some of our colleagues and friends whose areas of 
study aren’t included, in the rest of this section we look at those topics that 
we feel are in special need of attention.

292
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Discovering more about who 
gets celiac disease and why
Much is yet to be discovered in the realm of who gets celiac disease and why 
they get it. We suspect you’ve asked yourself these very questions after you 
or your loved one were diagnosed. Here are some areas in this domain that 
are in need of further research:
 
✓ Understanding more about the pathogenesis of celiac disease. One 
example is learning what role, if any, the TTG antibodies play in caus-
ing intestinal injury. That is, are they directly damaging to the intestine 
or just innocent bystanders? We discuss celiac disease antibodies in 
Chapter 2.
 
✓ Finding those additional genes that predispose someone to acquir-
ing celiac disease. Much is now known about the importance of the 
HLA DQ2 and DQ8 genes, but other as yet largely undefined genes are 
also known to play a role. We discuss the genetics of celiac disease in 
Chapter 2.
 
✓ Discovering factors that lead to the development of celiac disease. At 
present we have lots of theories, but no certainty. (Is it a virus that leads 
to celiac disease? The time that gluten is first introduced into an infant’s 
diet? Improved hygiene in developed countries? Increased amounts of 
gluten in the grains we eat? We look at these and other possible factors 
in Chapter 2.)
 
✓ Finding out why celiac disease has increased in prevalence over time. 
Studies by Dr. Joseph Murray and his colleagues at the Mayo clinic using 
tissue transglutaminase IgA (TTG IgA) testing of stored blood samples 
show that celiac disease was as much as four times less common half a 
century ago.
 
✓ Knowing why the clinical presentation of celiac disease has changed 
over time. For example, most cases are now diagnosed in adulthood and 
most are of the atypical type (whereas in the past most new diagnoses 
were in children who had the classical form). This remains an area wide-
open for investigation. We discuss the classification of celiac disease in 
Chapter 5.
Preventing and screening 
for celiac disease
Although consuming a gluten-free diet is very effective therapy for celiac dis-
ease, following this diet is not an easy task. Far better would be preventing 
celiac disease in the first place. Figuring out how to prevent celiac disease 
is an important area of research, and ongoing research studies are currently 
being conducted in this field.

293
 Chapter 16: What the Future May Hold
Screening for celiac disease is designed to discover it before it has had a 
chance to make someone ill. Knowing who, exactly, should be screened 
for celiac disease is, however, both controversial and uncertain. (Naturally 
enough, uncertainty breeds controversy).
As we discuss in Chapter 4, celiac disease is far less common in some regions 
of the world than in others. In those countries with populations who are at 
significant risk of getting celiac disease the prevalence of celiac disease is 
estimated to be approximately 1 percent. In the U.S. and many European 
countries it is estimated that only 10 to 20 percent of these individuals have 
actually been diagnosed. Finland is one country in which 50 percent have 
been diagnosed. This much higher rate of diagnosis was the result of large-
scale screening.
To better know who should be screened amongst the general population, 
it would be a huge help to know what is the natural history of the silent 
and latent forms of celiac disease (we discuss the forms of celiac disease 
in Chapter 5). Because these types of celiac disease have only relatively 
recently become recognized, there isn’t all that much known about how they 
will affect people as time goes by. This isn’t a moot point because if it turns 
out that, on the one hand, silent and latent celiac disease virtually never 
cause damage to the body, then screening for them wouldn’t likely be neces-
sary because treatment wouldn’t be warranted. On the other hand, if it is 
determined that, if left untreated, they lead to a whole host of problems, then 
screening for silent and latent celiac disease would be invaluable because 
treatment could then be undertaken before complications arise.
We discuss screening for celiac disease in detail in Chapter 4.
Finding better ways to make the 
diagnosis of celiac disease
At present, celiac disease can only be diagnosed by having an endoscopy 
and small intestine biopsy. Other tests, such as blood tests and the like, are 
helpful but are never definitive. As we discuss elsewhere in this chapter and 
in Chapter 3, an endoscopy (and small intestine biopsy) may not be particu-
larly unpleasant, but we have yet to encounter a single patient who wouldn’t 
prefer, all things being equal, to take a pass on these tests if there were only 
a simple blood test that could establish the diagnosis. Finding better ways to 
diagnose celiac disease is an area of active research.

294
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Finding out what happens to people with 
celiac disease as time goes by
As we discuss in Chapter 1, celiac disease was first described centuries ago. 
It was, however, only the classical form of celiac disease that was known to 
exist until fairly recently when the other types (atypical, silent, and latent) 
have been discovered.
Whereas it is abundantly clear that people with the classical form of celiac 
disease must be treated because otherwise the disease will lead to progres-
sively worsening damage to one’s body, there is less known about the long-
term implications of having atypical celiac disease, and hardly anything at all 
known about the long-term implications of having the silent and latent forms 
of the disease. (Initial studies suggest that individuals with the atypical, 
silent, and latent forms of celiac disease have a better course, even without 
treatment, than those with classical celiac disease.) These are huge gaps in 
knowledge about a condition which affects millions of people. More scientific 
research is needed to fill in these blanks.
Improving treatment
The treatment of celiac disease must be made literally and figuratively more 
palatable for people living with this condition. Meeting this need is essential.
Earlier in this chapter, in the section, “Changing the immune response to 
gluten,” we discuss current research that is looking at innovative ways of 
getting around the current need to avoid all gluten-containing foods. While 
the fruits of this research are awaited, what is needed in the here and now is 
better availability, nutritional quality, palatability (there’s that word again), 
and affordability of gluten-free foods.
A need also exists for:
 
✓ Better labelling of gluten-containing foods and medications.
 
✓ Easier methods to avoid cross contamination during food preparation. 
(See Chapter 10.)
 
✓ Reducing the costs of living gluten-free, including how governments 
assist people in offsetting the costs.

295
 Chapter 16: What the Future May Hold
Finding better ways of managing 
refractory celiac disease
Another area of needed research relates to the therapy of refractory celiac 
disease (RCD). As we discuss in Chapter 12, this is a rare, but serious com-
plication of celiac disease in which severe intestinal inflammation is present. 
There are several treatment options to manage RCD, but none that is clearly 
the best option and, accordingly, none that is ideal.
Dr. Christopher Mulder and his colleagues in the Netherlands are leaders 
in managing RCD and are studying innovative therapies including the use of 
bone marrow transplants and the use of a drug called cladribine. Another 
area of promising research relates to a type of inflammatory substance in 
the blood called a cytokine, (specifically one called IL-15), which is thought 
to trigger the intestinal lymphocytes (a type of immune system white blood 
cell) to become pre-cancerous.
Discovering more about gluten sensitivity
As we discuss in Chapter 13, some people react adversely to ingesting gluten, 
but for reasons not necessarily related to the immune system or to celiac 
disease. The reason or reasons for this are unknown and requiring further 
scientific investigation.
Knowing whether tolerance 
to gluten occurs
Gluten “tolerance” refers to the theoretical development of immunity to the 
damaging effects of gluten on the intestine of a person with celiac disease. 
Most celiac disease specialists doubt this exists, but could they be wrong?
A study by Dr. Tamara Matysiak and other European colleagues reported that 
some adults with celiac disease can resume eating gluten without apparent ill 
effects. This is obviously an intriguing prospect, but one that needs much more 
research before anyone with celiac disease — including you! — abandons a 
gluten-free diet.

296
Part IV: The Long-Term: Living and Thriving with Celiac Disease 
Increasing public awareness 
of celiac disease
We saved our favorite topic of all for last. As evidenced by the fact that we’ve 
written this book, you may already suspect that we feel passionately about 
empowerment though knowledge of celiac disease. You bet we do!
We also feel passionately that this knowledge can be used to great effect by 
people living with celiac disease and by health care providers and research-
ers alike to advocate for causes related to celiac disease. Indeed, as a result 
of people advocating for celiac disease, there is now better funding of labs 
making innovative and potentially life-altering discoveries, a quickly expand-
ing array of gluten-free foods available on grocery store shelves and in res-
taurants, and the availability of tax deductions of certain expenses related to 
living gluten-free, to name but a few success stories.
The work is, of course, not yet done, and it will require ongoing and con-
certed efforts at increasing public awareness of celiac disease if the recent, 
wonderful strides that have been made are to continue (which, by the way, 
we feel confident will indeed happen).

O
ver our combined 50-plus years in practice (how lucky that we started 
medical school at the age of 9!), our patients have collectively asked 
us hundreds of different questions regarding their celiac disease. Queries 
have ranged from the easily answered (“Can I catch celiac disease?” No, you 
can’t.) to the nearly-impossible-to-answer (“When will there be a cure for 
celiac disease?” Alas, we just don’t know.). Some questions — whether easily 
answered or not — come up much more often than others. In this chapter, 
we’ve compiled the 10 most frequently asked questions (FAQs).
Do I Need to Have a Small Intestine 
Biopsy to Diagnose Celiac Disease?
Yes, it is. Next question . . .
Nah, we wouldn’t be so dismissive as to not answer this perfectly reason-
able question more fully. Indeed, this question is often raised; not only by 
lay people, but by health care professionals, too. Like much else in the world 
of medicine, there are arguments for and against requiring a small intestine 
biopsy in order to diagnose celiac disease.
We’ll start with the argument against requiring a small intestine biopsy to 
make the diagnosis. People in this camp argue that if someone has symptoms 
of celiac disease (see Chapter 6) and has antibodies that are typically pres-
ent if you have celiac disease (see Chapter 3), then the probability of celiac

Part V: The Part of Tens 
disease is high enough that there’s no reason to burden the person with an 
endoscopy (and small intestine biopsy). Instead, the diagnosis can be made 
on these grounds alone, and treatment with a gluten-free diet can begin. In 
addition, even if the diagnosis is wrong, the person wouldn’t come to harm 
by unnecessarily following a gluten-free diet, and if the diet wasn’t helping 
because, in fact, the person didn’t have celiac disease, they’d seek medical 
attention, and the correct diagnosis would ultimately surface anyhow. 
Fair enough.
Now take look at the other side of the argument: Those who argue that a 
small intestine biopsy should always be done prior to diagnosing celiac dis-
ease say that symptoms of celiac disease are never specific and that similar 
symptoms can be seen with many other ailments, too. Further, they point 
out that the antibodies found in a person with celiac disease can also be seen 
with a variety of other, unrelated health problems. They may also add, given 
the great importance of knowing whether one has celiac disease (in terms 
of the risk of other family members having it, the need to adhere lifelong to 
a special — and costly — diet, the potential health complications arising 
from celiac disease, and so on), that it doesn’t make sense to risk uncertainty 
regarding diagnosis when a simple, safe, fast, and very accurate endoscopy 
and small intestine biopsy can almost always provide definitive evidence one 
way or the other.
These are pretty darn good arguments on either side. But we don’t think it’s a 
toss-up. In our opinion, the implications of having celiac disease are so great 
that the diagnosis should only be made if a small intestine biopsy has been 
performed and found to show appropriate abnormalities.
 
Theresa was a 35-year-old woman who was referred to Ian because her family 
doctor thought she likely had celiac disease. This was a perfectly reasonable 
supposition because Theresa had compatible symptoms (including bloating, 
cramping, weight loss, and diarrhea) and a positive tissue transglutaminase 
antibody (this antibody is almost always found if someone has celiac disease). 
Ian advised Theresa that he thought her family doctor was likely correct, 
but still recommended that an endoscopy and small intestine biopsy be per-
formed to be sure. With some reluctance, Theresa agreed to the procedure. 
As it turned out, Theresa’s small intestine biopsy was normal and further 
tests revealed that all her symptoms and her positive antibody were actually 
related to previously undetected liver disease. If Theresa hadn’t been biop-
sied, a wrong diagnosis would have been made, unhelpful therapy (a gluten-
free diet) administered, her correct diagnosis delayed, and proper therapy 
(for her liver disease) given only belatedly.

 Chapter 17: Ten Frequently Asked Questions
Can I Protect My Child from 
Getting Celiac Disease?
We are often asked by moms and dads who have celiac disease whether they 
can do anything to lessen the risk that their child will also get celiac disease. 
This, of course, begs the question as to whether anybody can be protected 
from getting celiac disease.
The quick answer is no. There is no proven way to prevent your loved 
one — or anyone else for that matter — from getting celiac disease. Medical 
researchers, however, are exploring several hypotheses about how to reduce 
the risk of getting celiac disease. One hypothesis, as we discuss in Chapter 14 
is that the risk is reduced if you delay exposing an infant to gluten. Another 
theory, however, is diametrically opposed and suggests that giving infants 
small amounts of gluten early in infancy is the better thing to do to lower 
their risk. Geesh, how confusing is that?! Until this debate is resolved, we 
recommend you follow the current consensus amongst most celiac disease 
experts that it is best to first introduce gluten to infants who are genetically 
at risk of celiac disease between 4 and 6 months of age.
There is also research suggesting that breastfeeding an infant reduces 
a child’s risk of developing celiac disease. Perhaps this will become yet 
another reason to breastfeed. (Not that any more reasons are necessary 
given the vast number of proven benefits that currently exist.) We recom-
mend that you breastfeed your child for at least the first 6 months of life; 
breastfeeding is particularly important during the period of time that gluten 
is introduced into the infant’s diet.
 
If being involved in medical research may interest you and your family, 
consider contacting a nearby university-based teaching hospital to find out 
whether that institution is performing any celiac disease prevention studies. If 
so, you may consider enrolling your child in one of these studies.
Should I Have My Child Tested 
for Celiac Disease?
If your child has symptoms of celiac disease (we discuss these in Chapter 
6), your child’s doctor should test to see whether celiac disease is present, 
unless there is some other apparent cause. If, on the other hand, your child 
is perfectly well, he or she doesn’t need to be tested for celiac disease unless 

302
Part V: The Part of Tens 
some other reason to do so exists. In other words, it is not currently recom-
mended to test all healthy children for this ailment. There are, however, 
two important circumstances for which you and your child’s doctor should 
consider (there are no hard and fast rules here) having your child tested for 
celiac disease:
 
✓ If your child has a first-degree relative (mother, father, brother, or 
sister) who has celiac disease. (We discuss this further in the later sec-
tion “If I Have Celiac Disease, Will My Child or Sibling Also Have It?”)
 
✓ If your child is known to have a health condition that puts him or her at 
increased risk of also having celiac disease. Most commonly, this other 
condition would be an autoimmune disease such as type 1 diabetes. 
(Having type 1 diabetes , for example, is associated with a 5 percent 
lifetime risk of also having celiac disease.) In Chapter 8, we discuss a 
number of different conditions — including autoimmune diseases — that 
are associated with celiac disease.
 
We’ve worded this FAQ specifically as “should I have my child tested for 
celiac disease?” because, well, that is the frequently asked question we hear. 
Nonetheless, our answer would be the same if the question had been asked by 
any person who has any first-degree relative with celiac disease. (Assuming, of 
course, the first-degree relative was a biological first degree relative, not 
an adopted relative; the increased risk is due to shared genes, not a shared 
environment.)
Testing for a disease in the absence of symptoms or other evidence it is pres-
ent is called screening. We discuss this topic in detail in Chapter 4.
Can You Outgrow Celiac Disease?
You likely recall how much better you felt soon after starting a gluten-free 
diet. And the odds are darn good that as you continued your diet, all your 
previous symptoms gradually resolved and you remained well thereafter. It 
could be — human beings being human after all — that at some point you 
inadvertently (or maybe even intentionally) resumed consuming gluten. 
It’s likely that in short order your old symptoms came back to haunt you, 
reminding you that you had not been cured of your celiac disease, but rather, 
that you still had it and needed to look after it. But what if you had resumed 
eating gluten and your symptoms, in fact, did not return? Or perhaps you 
have a child with celiac disease and, after being entirely well for years whilst 
on a gluten-free diet, you are now wondering whether your child needs to 
continue it? Could it be that you or your child have “outgrown” celiac disease?

303
 Chapter 17: Ten Frequently Asked Questions
So, then, with that 158-word preamble (yup, we counted) under our belt, can 
you, in fact, outgrow celiac disease? Alas, although you will outgrow your 
high chair, your first bike, adolescence (thank goodness), your wedding-day 
tuxedo (sigh), and a million other things, you will not outgrow your celiac 
disease. Similarly, if you have a child with celiac disease, your child won’t 
outgrow it either.
If you are a middle-aged person and were diagnosed in your youth with celiac 
disease it is quite possible that you recall long ago being told by a doctor 
that you could — or would — outgrow your celiac disease. At one time, this 
possibility was entertained by some health care providers. Nowadays we 
know this is incorrect.
So what might happen to you if, feeling completely well, you decide to 
resume eating gluten-containing foods? The answer is, you will develop one 
or more of the following problems:
 
✓ Your symptoms (see Chapter 6) will return, possibly becoming severe 
and exceptionally difficult to settle (see Chapter 12 for information on 
refractory celiac disease).
 
✓ You will develop complications of celiac disease (such as iron-deficiency 
anemia or osteoporosis); see Chapter 7.
 
✓ You may expose yourself to an increased risk of several types of cancer, 
as explained in Chapter 9.
The bottom line: As much as we wish it were otherwise, you cannot, in fact, 
outgrow celiac disease and it is potentially dangerous to resume eating 
gluten, even if, having done so, you feel perfectly well.
If I Have Celiac Disease, Will My 
Child or Sibling Also Have It?
As we discuss in Chapter 2, celiac disease tends to run in families. The reason 
for this is that members of a family share many genes — including those for 
celiac disease — in common.
If you have celiac disease, your first-degree relatives (that is, your mother, 
father, brother, sister, or child) has a risk of somewhere between 4 and 12 
percent of also having celiac disease. (The reason for the broad range in 
numbers is that different scientific studies have found different results.) 

304
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Compare this with the much lower risk (about 1 percent) of celiac disease in 
the general population.
Because the risk of celiac disease is so much higher in first-degree relatives 
of an affected person, these relatives are often screened for the condition. We 
discuss this further in Chapter 4.
How Much Gluten Can I Safely Consume 
If I Have Celiac Disease?
We begin our answer to this question by being dogmatic: If you have celiac 
disease, you should consume no gluten at all. Celiac disease is an immune 
system disease, and the immune system can be triggered by even a minute 
stimulus, so don’t play with fire and don’t ingest gluten. Period.
Okay, so much for dogma; now let’s look at practical realities.
Following a gluten-free diet doesn’t mean that you will never ingest a single 
molecule of gluten. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines 
a gluten-free diet as a diet in which no more than 10 milligrams of gluten is 
ingested per day. In other words, the FDA definition implies that “too much” 
is anything more than 10 milligrams per day. What would 10 milligrams look 
like? About the same size as 1/100th of a peanut. In other words, although 
gluten-free doesn’t mean zero gluten, it’s so close that it can be considered 
one and the same.
As we say throughout this book, if you have celiac disease it is not only 
unwise, it is also unsafe to consume gluten. Having said that, we recognize 
that even the most conscientious of people is likely to ingest gluten — acci-
dentally or otherwise — at some time. Will this be a disaster-in-the-making, or 
will you be okay if this happens to you? Well, so long as it seldom happens, 
and so long as the amount consumed is very small, you will likely be fine.
Can I Skip the Diet and Just Take an Iron 
Supplement to Treat My Low Iron? 
As we discuss in Chapter 7, many people with celiac disease have no — or 
virtually no — symptoms and the condition is discovered only after a blood 
test, typically done for routine purposes, reveals iron deficiency, often with 
anemia present. Iron deficiency in celiac disease occurs because the dam-
aged first part of the small intestine, the duodenum, is unable to properly 
absorb ingested iron into the body.

305
 Chapter 17: Ten Frequently Asked Questions
Given that a person who has celiac disease discovered in this incidental way 
typically feels healthy, it’s not surprising that he or she may ask whether it’s 
really necessary to follow a gluten-free diet and whether an iron supplement 
can simply be taken instead. Our reply (which you may predict if you’ve read 
this chapter from the beginning) is that, regrettably, taking iron alone is not 
sufficient, and you must also follow a gluten-free diet.
Here are three important reasons why you can’t simply consume iron and 
forego the gluten-free diet:
 
✓ Even if you have no gastrointestinal symptoms, your gut is damaged and 
will remain so if you continue to ingest gluten. This damage prevents 
you from sufficiently absorbing into your body the iron you are ingest-
ing and, as a result, despite taking iron supplements you’ll continue to 
be iron-deficient.
 
✓ You may feel fine now, but if you continue to consume gluten, there is 
a good chance that you will eventually feel ill. Even if you don’t, your 
celiac disease may still be taking a silent toll on your body (for example, 
by causing osteoporosis, which we discuss in Chapter 7).
 
✓ Ongoing ingestion of gluten may increase your risk of developing certain 
types of cancer. See Chapter 9 for more on this risk.
Another question about treating iron deficiency that comes up fairly fre-
quently is whether you can get around the problem of malabsorption of 
oral iron by taking iron by injection instead. As we discuss in detail in 
Chapter 7, this can be hazardous and is recommended only for very special 
circumstances.
Should My Whole Family Eat Gluten-free 
If Only One Member Has Celiac Disease?
If a person has celiac disease, there is a significantly increased risk that 
a close family member will be similarly affected. For this reason, we’re 
often asked whether it is wise — or, at the least, easier or simpler — to put 
everyone in the family on a gluten-free diet. (Following a gluten-free diet is 
the mainstay of treating celiac disease. We discuss this diet in detail in 
Chapter 10.) Like most things in the world of medicine, there are some good 
things about doing this and there are — you guessed it — some bad things 
about doing this.

306
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Here are some advantages of having the whole family eat gluten-free:
 
✓ The person who is known to have celiac disease won’t feel singled out 
for dietary restriction because everyone in the family is eating similarly.
 
✓ Food shopping becomes more straightforward if everyone in the family 
is eating the same types of foods.
 
✓ If another family member has — but has not yet been diagnosed with — 
celiac disease, he or she will be on track with therapy.
 
✓ If a family member has been screened for celiac disease and it wasn’t 
detected, that doesn’t guarantee that it won’t later develop. Starting a 
gluten-free diet early in the game introduces a diet that that person is 
going to end up requiring later anyhow.
And here are some disadvantages to having the whole family eat gluten-free:
 
✓ Family members who needn’t follow a gluten-free diet will be eating an 
unnecessarily restricted diet.
 
✓ Following a gluten-free diet typically entails greater grocery costs than 
a conventional diet. If you are buying additional gluten-free foods (as 
you would if your whole family is following this diet), then you’ll end up 
spending more money than you would have otherwise.
 
✓ If a person who is not known to have celiac disease is following a gluten-
free diet, when he or she comes to be tested for the condition, it will be 
more difficult to determine whether he or she does or does not have it. 
We discuss this further in Chapter 3.
 
✓ The family member with celiac disease may not adjust as well to learn-
ing how to deal with staying gluten-free once they leave the home envi-
ronment as compared to someone who learns to live gluten-free while 
living at home. (We discuss this in Chapter 14).
Although the final decision always rests with the family dealing with this 
issue, we advocate great caution before having an entire family follow a 
gluten-free diet when the whole family doesn’t actually have to follow such a 
diet. Celiac disease is a lifelong and important disorder. We feel it best that 
one commit to the often-challenging gluten-free diet only if one has been 
definitively proven to have the ailment.
Is It All Right for Me to Eat Oats?
Until recently it had been thought that anybody who has celiac disease 
should not consume oat-based products (including oatmeal). Nowadays, 
however, it’s been determined that this prohibition wasn’t sufficiently well-
founded to be justified. Indeed, it is now known that the great majority of 

307
 Chapter 17: Ten Frequently Asked Questions
people with celiac disease can consume oat-based products so long as “pure” 
oats are being ingested.
As we discuss in Chapter 2, the misperception about oats triggering celiac 
disease likely arose because the oats that were typically available (and, 
therefore, consumed) were mixed in with other, gluten-containing products. 
In other words, the oats weren’t triggering the celiac disease; the other 
products were. Pure oats (that is, oats not contaminated by other, gluten-
containing products) are now available and are fine for you to consume (see 
Appendix A). Bon appétit!
As much as we’d love to sound dogmatic here and end the discussion with 
the preceding paragraph, alas, in the interests of being entirely scientifically 
accurate, there is one qualifier we need to add to this discussion. There are 
rare individuals with celiac disease whose condition is triggered by oats. 
(This is the other reason why oats were thought to be a trigger for celiac dis-
ease but as it turns out, this is very rare.) So if you eat oats (or oatmeal) and 
develop gastrointestinal symptoms, it would be wise to discontinue eating 
them or, at the very least, have yourself checked out by your doctor to see 
what is causing you to be unwell. (And, of course, either in this circumstance 
or any other, if you develop persisting GI symptoms, it is imperative you seek 
medical attention to be checked out.)
Does Avoiding Gluten Protect Me from 
Getting Other Autoimmune Diseases?
As we discover in Chapter 8, if you have celiac disease (which is an auto-
immune disease, a condition in which the body’s immune system mistakenly 
attacks part of one’s own body), you’re at increased risk of also having 
other autoimmune diseases like type 1 diabetes and certain forms of thyroid 
disease.
A unique feature of celiac disease, in contrast to other autoimmune diseases, 
is that the trigger (gluten) for this condition is known, whereas for other 
autoimmune diseases, it remains a mystery. We are often asked if this mys-
tery is not so mysterious after all. Could it be that gluten exposure not only 
triggers celiac disease, but is also responsible for causing these other auto-
immune diseases (at least, in those people who already have celiac disease)?
In case you’re wondering, we’ve saved this FAQ for last for a very good 
reason: It’s the hardest to answer! It is known with absolute certainty that if 
you have celiac disease, you must not consume gluten because doing so per-
petuates injury to your intestine and potentially leads to other celiac disease 
complications. What is not as clear is whether avoiding gluten — if you 
have celiac disease — has the additional benefit of reducing your risk of 

308
Part V: The Part of Tens 
acquiring other autoimmune diseases or, if they are present, helping to keep 
these other conditions in check.
This is a very important question for scientists to figure out. If avoiding 
gluten does actually help protect people with celiac disease from developing 
other autoimmune diseases, this knowledge will contribute to our under-
standing not only of the particular disease in question, but also of how the 
immune system malfunctions in the first place. Regardless of the answer, 
following a gluten-free diet is an absolute necessity for everyone with celiac 
disease in order to protect them from complications of this disease. If it also 
helps prevent other autoimmune diseases from developing, that will be a true 
blessing. If it doesn’t, well, the diet remains essential for maintaining good 
health anyhow.

A
s with any other health condition, when it comes to having celiac dis-
ease, the goal isn’t just to avoid being ill; the goal is to be able to lead a 
full, active, and healthy existence. In other words, to live successfully.
In this chapter, with the assistance of Sheila’s husband Peter (who has lived 
with celiac disease for 50-plus years), we share ten key tips to help you climb 
the hills, traverse the valleys, and swim the seas of daily life with celiac dis-
ease. Now just before — or just after, if you prefer — you do all that climbing, 
traversing, and swimming, in this chapter we also share tips about dealing 
with workmates and friends, eating out, and, well, let the journey begin.
Strive to Be Healthy
“Living successfully” isn’t, of course, being obliged to live the same routine 
day-to-day (although you’re perfectly welcome to if that’s what you prefer.) 
For most people, living successfully also involves constantly re-evaluating 
how life is lived: looking at how you eat, what exercise you do (or are hoping 
to do), what bad habits, if any, you feel you should abandon, what good 
habits you want to adopt, and so forth.

310
Part V: The Part of Tens 
If you are living with celiac disease, one of the things you’ve had to re-evaluate 
is your diet as you’ve faced the challenges of living gluten-free. But as you 
have already discovered or, if celiac disease is a new diagnosis to you, 
will soon discover, striving to be healthy by making the necessary dietary 
changes involves making healthy changes. Disruptive? Sure. Good for you? 
You bet.
Eating gluten-free is healthy eating because it’s a balanced diet based on 
fresh fruits and vegetables, a variety of carbohydrates, and different sources 
of protein, fats, minerals, and vitamins. A person lives gluten-free to not only 
feel well but to be well, and the necessary dietary changes make this all the 
more likely to happen.
We suspect that you know many people without celiac disease that are also 
striving to be healthy by making their own dietary changes. Perhaps they’ve 
cut down on their saturated food intake or are trying to eat more vegetables, 
get more fiber, reduce how often they consume fast food, and so on. These 
people without celiac disease are looking at making many of the healthy 
eating changes that you with celiac disease already have. Bet it feels nice to 
know that you’re ahead of the (healthy eating) curve!
For a detailed discussion on gluten-free eating, see Chapter 10.
Keep Informed about Your Disease
As physicians (and, in the case of Peter, an immunologist and former veteri-
narian), we are constantly reading about new research findings, attending 
medical conferences, and doing our best to ensure we are current in our sci-
entific knowledge. As a health care consumer, you, too, would be well served 
by ensuring you remain abreast of important aspects of living with your 
celiac disease.
Keeping informed provides you with ways to help you live successfully. 
Whether its highly practical information, like what new gluten-free foods have 
recently made their way onto the shelves of your corner grocery store, or 
more academic information about new discoveries, knowledge is power.
You can remain informed in a number of ways:
 
✓ Your celiac disease specialist will be able to answer questions specific 
to you and your celiac disease. He or she is also a source of general 
information about what’s new in the world of celiac disease.

311
 Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Living Successfully with Celiac Disease
 
✓ Your dietitian — especially if affiliated with a celiac disease clinic — is 
an invaluable resource when it comes to providing you with current 
information regarding gluten-free eating.
 
✓ Being a member of a support group gives you the opportunity to learn 
practical tips that others living with celiac disease have discovered 
(such as what restaurants in your community have the best selection of 
gluten-free menu items). Support groups also provide a venue to which 
invited speakers come to share their expertise on how to manage celiac 
disease and many other relevant topics.
 
✓ You can avail yourself of up-to-date information provided by a number 
of very helpful organizations specifically charged with meeting the 
needs of people living with celiac disease. Here you find both practical 
information as well as scientific information that is geared toward a lay 
(but interested) audience. We list a number of these organizations in 
Appendix B.
 
✓ Reading informed publications (both print and online) keeps you 
abreast of what’s new in the world of celiac disease. Remember, though, 
particularly when it comes to virtual (that is, Internet) publications, you 
need to always consider the source of the information. Anyone with an 
Internet connection can post materials, however inaccurate, to Web 
sites. In Appendix A, we list Web sites that have a reputation for reliabil-
ity and accuracy.
Discover How Avoiding Gluten Is Sexy
Peter was going to write a ten page, exquisitely detailed essay in this space 
graphically discussing how living gluten-free has impacted his sex life. Sheila 
told him he was welcome to do this, but only if she could first draw up the 
divorce papers. Peter reconsidered and, with his wife’s permission, narrowed 
his thoughts down to one sentence. “Living gluten-free has no impact on 
one’s sex life.” And that pretty well ends this discussion. Well, almost. The 
one thing we’d add is, as we discuss in Chapter 14, medical research from 
Italy has found that people with celiac disease who follow a gluten-free diet 
have sex more often — and find it more satisfying — than they do before they 
start their gluten-free diet.
Moral of the story: If you have celiac disease, you’ll be more interested in 
sexual relations if you feel well. And the key to feeling well is getting on — 
and staying on — track with your gluten-free diet.

Prepare for Your Child’s Visit to Friends
Being a parent of any child has all sorts of challenges. Oh, we’d be the first 
to say there are many, many, many joys. But we’d also volunteer that there 
are challenges too. And if you are the parent of a child with celiac disease, 
you likely have already had to deal with some of the extra challenges that are 
present, including what to do when your child wants to eat “normally, just 
like the other kids.” This perfectly natural and completely understandable 
desire to want to fit in with friends at school, in the playground, in the home, 
and so on, can at times be one of the biggest hurdles for both parent and 
child to surmount.
The most important thing about having your child cope with these situations 
is to have clear direction from you. And that direction must include a lovingly 
delivered, but firm stance on the importance of your child not consuming 
gluten-containing foods. However difficult this may be, you must not yield. 
You love your child dearly and, born of this love, is your desire for your child 
to be healthy. And consuming gluten if you have celiac disease is not healthy. 
Period.
As we discuss in Chapter 14, there are a few ways in which you can make 
the difficult task of keeping your child gluten-free, whether she’s a youngster 
eating at a friend’s birthday party or young adult having meals with friends at 
college:
 
✓ Teach your child, as early as is age-appropriate, about what foods con-
tain gluten and the need to avoid them. Again, as age appropriate, take 
her shopping with you at the grocery store and teach her how to tell 
the difference between foods that include gluten and those that don’t, 
including knowing what to look for on food labels. Increase the sophisti-
cation of the explanation you provide to her as she gets older.
 
✓ Teach your child how to cook gluten-free. Peter, cooking gluten-free, is 
able to cook with the likes of an executive chef in a five star restaurant. 
In ten minutes, working from scratch, he can create a six course meal. 
He can create deserts fit for a king. He can leap tall buildings in a single 
bound. He can . . . okay, well, we got carried away there and none of that 
is actually true (except for the tall building leaping, or so he says). But 
what Peter can do, and has done since he was a kid, is prepare excellent 
gluten-free meals. His parents taught him that if he wanted to be inde-
pendent, he’d be best off learning how to shop for and prepare gluten-
free dishes. It’s been an invaluable strategy for him and one you might 
consider fostering with your own child with the amount of information 
you share and the cooking autonomy you allow them being progres-
sively increased as they mature.

313
 Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Living Successfully with Celiac Disease
 
✓ Speak to the parents of your children’s friends and explain to them 
about celiac disease and how it’s treated. You may find them surpris-
ingly willing to do their best to accommodate your child’s needs when 
your child is visiting their house.
 
✓ When going to a birthday party or other celebration, have your child 
take some gluten-free treats with them. For example, if cupcakes are 
being served for Johnnie’s birthday, send along a few gluten-free cup-
cakes so your child does not feel left out. If hotdogs or pizza are going to 
be served, preparing a gluten-free version to drop off with your child at 
a party or an end-of-the-season sports team celebration will be appreci-
ated by the host or coach.
For more tips, have a look at the section “Growing Up Gluten-Free” in 
Chapter 14.
Learn How to Eat Out 
without Standing Out
Unless you are on the flamboyant side, you likely prefer, when eating out, 
to not stand out. Oh sure, you want good service and you surely want good 
food, but you probably don’t want the fact of your celiac disease to become 
an issue (even if it’s as much the restaurant’s issue as it is your own).
There are a number of ways you can have an enjoyable, stress- and gluten-
free dining experience when at a restaurant:
 
✓ Call the restaurant before you go and ask if gluten-free foods are on 
the menu. If so, ask what ones. If not, feel free to suggest that the restau-
rant consider revisiting this and in the future including gluten-free items. 
The restaurant business is the most competitive one out there, and your 
suggestion may well be appreciated, especially if it helps to draw in 
more customers.
 
✓ Order “off” the menu. If you’re with friends or family at a pizza restau-
rant (where gluten-free menu items are typically not commonplace), 
for example, feel free to ask the waiter to have the cook whip together 
a plate of fresh mozzarella, a couple of tomato slices, some basil, arti-
chokes, and olives all drizzled with a little olive oil for a heartier salad. 
They’ll likely be happy to do this. You might also ask if the owner is 
around (if it’s a small restaurant, your waiter and the owner may be one 
and the same); small restaurant owners are, intrinsically, hosts and want 
to please their guests so they are often very accommodating and will 
likely do their best to accommodate your needs and requests.

✓ Take some gluten-free snacks with you. Peter has toted gluten-free 
bread and other goodies to friends’ homes, to the theatre, to parties, to 
restaurants, to, well, pretty well everywhere he goes where food is going 
to be served and he’s not sure they will have gluten-free choices avail-
able. If they do, he packs his snack away for another time; if they don’t, 
well, he’s got some food on which to chow down.
 
✓ Consider having a light meal or snack at home before you go out. It is 
easier to retain your gluten-avoidance willpower if you aren’t starving as 
someone offers you a tasty, but off-limits gluten-containing morsel.
You can find more tips on eating gluten-free when out of the house in 
Chapter 10.
Figure Out How to Save On 
Your Food Purchases
As you probably discovered when you went on your inaugural gluten-free 
grocery shopping trip, living gluten-free means incurring additional expenses. 
In a sense, wheat is the “great extender” in that it takes up a significant por-
tion of the volume of many prepared foods. Replacing wheat-based compo-
nents with alternative products means the manufacturer incurs increased 
food production costs, which, not surprisingly, are passed on to you. (There 
are multiple other cost factors also at play here, including the absence of the 
same economy of scale that is present with regular food production.)
Here are some ways that you can save some money on your gluten-free food 
grocery purchases:
 
✓ Apply for tax rebates that reimburse you for your additional food pur-
chasing costs. As we discuss in Chapter 10, this is not always straightfor-
ward to do.
 
✓ Learn how to do your own gluten-free cooking and baking. In addition 
to being a great hobby, it also helps you save money because cooking 
for yourself is typically less expensive than eating out or buying gluten-
free prepared foods.
 
✓ Fill up your always-hungry teenager by having them eat rice, beans, 
corn (polenta), and potatoes to complement their other nutritious 
foods.

315
 Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Living Successfully with Celiac Disease
 
✓ Find suitable restaurants. Because the less expensive, fast food types 
of restaurants typically don’t provide much in the way of gluten-free 
food offerings (and are generally not very nutritious places anyhow), 
you may feel that you are limited to fancier, more expensive restaurants, 
which often are more likely to have gluten-free options. Another option 
is to find small, family-run restaurants where the owners are on-site and 
typically do the food buying, preparing, and serving themselves. These 
types of establishments are likely to charge less than the fancy place 
down the street. More importantly when it comes to you and your celiac 
disease, although they may not know much about celiac disease, they 
sure as shootin’ know what ingredients are used in their recipes, and 
you can chat with them to make sure you make appropriate gluten-free 
selections.
We look in more detail at these and other money saving food purchasing tips 
in Chapter 10.
Be Prepared for Blank Looks (Or Worse)
You’ve likely had experiences where, when you told acquaintances, friends, 
or workmates that you have celiac disease, you got looks ranging from, at 
best, a blank stare to, at worst, one that says you may as well have told them 
you had the plague. Although things are changing, most people still know 
very little about celiac disease. And in any event, even when they do, discuss-
ing the details about a digestive disease hardly seems like a smooth begin-
ning to a “normal” conversation and hardly an effective pickup line (unless, 
perhaps, you’re in the gluten-free food shopping area of the grocery store, 
but that’s a discussion for another place. Mind you, having said that, we 
could refer you to the “Discover how avoiding gluten is sexy” section earlier 
in this chapter . . .)
Depending on how comfortable you are telling people you have celiac dis-
ease, the people to whom you’re speaking, the specific situation, and so 
forth, you may find it helpful to have different comments or responses pre-
pared in the event the topic of your having celiac disease comes up. Most 
people with celiac disease find the simplest thing to do when chatting to 
people with whom they’re not particularly close is to describe their celiac 
disease as being a food intolerance or a food allergy. This brief description, 
even if not quite accurate, is usually effective at dispensing with the subject 
and moving the conversation on to other subjects.

316
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Have a Good Answer to the Inevitable 
Question — “What Happens When 
You Eat Wheat?”
As we mention in the preceding section, although people may be surprised 
to hear you have celiac disease, they usually drop the subject once you’ve 
explained it in a few words (assuming, that is, you elect to say anything at all) 
or, conversely, opt to provide a more detailed explanation.
Some people, however, out of either curiosity or caring — or, at times, even 
prying — may press you for more details than you’re comfortable providing. 
Chief among these is typically a question along the lines of “What happens 
if you eat wheat?” If you know the person well and want to provide a full 
answer, then, of course, go for it. On the other hand, if you would rather they 
would simply stop asking you anything at all, you might try the one answer 
that Peter has longed to use for decades, but hasn’t yet ever had the impu-
dence (rudeness?) to try. Here’s how his fantasy vignette goes:
Stranger to Peter in food line-up: “Hey, their bread’s great in this place; you 
gotta try some.”
Peter to stranger: “Oh, okay. Thanks.”
Stranger: “But you’re not taking any.”
Peter: “No, not today.”
Stranger: “Why not?”
Peter: “I’m allergic to wheat.”
Stranger: “Oh, ah, that’s weird; what happens if you eat wheat?”
Peter: “My bowels explode.”
Stranger: Suddenly speechless . . .
It’s seldom easy to get into a clinical discussion of one’s bowel habits with a 
perfect stranger.
Assuming you don’t want to tell someone that your bowels will explode if you 
eat wheat (or other gluten-containing products), you may want to have an 
alternative answer at the ready. Often, keeping it simple works best, and a “If 
I eat wheat I get an upset stomach” typically suffices.

Pack Your Bags, We’re Going To . . .
Eating is one of the greatest pleasures on a trip, but also one of the biggest 
challenges or sources of anxiety for someone on a gluten-free diet. Even more 
daunting is the situation when traveling to a country where you don’t speak 
the language. This is another example of how a little preparation can go a 
long way to making the trip go more smoothly.
Before you go, try to learn about the foods likely to be available and served 
in the place to which you’ll be traveling. Using the Internet, you can find out 
what the regional dishes and local recipes are in pretty much any neck of the 
woods. Also, in many countries, food isn’t as mass-produced and processed 
so often as in North America, so dishes containing gluten aren’t as prevalent. 
In Appendix A, we list a number of Web sites that provide helpful information 
about traveling while living with celiac disease.
Most countries have some spectacular gluten-free dishes that you may even 
want to introduce into your regular menu. Can’t eat quiche? Try a frittata. 
Enjoy the Swiss raclette, which is melted cheese on potatoes. And fresh ber-
ries in crème fraiche with a drizzle of excellent balsamic vinegar puts most 
baking to shame. In Italy, you’ll find that there are many alternatives to pasta, 
including corn-based polenta and risotto. Italy also has many food shops that 
cater to people who are living gluten-free. In France, try a charcuterie (a type 
of delicatessen specializing in meats and other prepared foods) for many 
gluten-free options for a great picnic. In Japan, rice is nice. Also, “spring rain” 
noodles are made from rice. And miso soup is gluten-free. In Scotland, they 
use a lot of wheat and bread crumbs, so eating gluten-free has some chal-
lenges. On the plus side, the whisky is gluten-free (due to the distillation 
process).
 
It’s very helpful to learn a few key words of the language local to where you’re 
traveling. Peter has learned how to say he is allergic to wheat and to ask 
whether something is made with wheat flour in 4 languages (though he still 
finds communicating in Scotland particularly tough!). Phrase books also work 
well, as do dining cards (see Chapter 10 and Appendix A). Sometimes, how-
ever, nothing works quite as effectively (and succinctly) as pointing to a dish 
you recognize from your homework as likely to be gluten-free.
Bon voyage!
Deal with the Slipups
Being aware of the importance of avoiding gluten in order to maintain good 
health, most people living with celiac disease strive, as they should, to be as 
careful as they can with their diet. But life happens and the odds are darn 
good that at one point or another (or multiple points for that matter) 

318
Part V: The Part of Tens 
you — and everyone else living with celiac disease — will either intentionally 
or inadvertently consume gluten-containing food.
If and when this happens, the first thing to do is to take a deep breath and 
reassure yourself that you’ve not just swallowed plutonium and you’re not 
about to die! In the next breath tell yourself that your slipup doesn’t make 
you a weak person, it doesn’t make you a dumb person, and it certainly 
doesn’t make you a bad person. Following a strict diet of any type for even a 
few days or weeks can be tough; following a strict diet for the rest of your life 
can be that much more formidable a challenge.
In the third and with every subsequent breath, do your darndest to never 
refer to your gluten-consuming misadventure as cheating. Cheating is some-
thing devious or immoral. Eating gluten isn’t those things. Eating gluten 
represents a break in willpower or an accident or, for children, simply part 
of growing up and experimentation. The term cheating is patronizing at best, 
insulting at worst, and should never be uttered in the same sentence as the 
words celiac disease or gluten. Wow, we feel so much better now that we got 
that off our chest.
So take pride in your usual success following your gluten-free diet, get 
quickly back on track and, should you feel guilty with your slipup, let the 
guilt pass quickly for it won’t serve you much good in the long run.

Ten Myths, Misperceptions, and 
Falsehoods about Celiac Disease
In This Chapter
▶ Looking at misperceptions regarding being overweight and having celiac disease
▶ Discussing myths surrounding gluten-ingestion and celiac disease symptoms
▶ Eliminating the myth of borderline celiac disease
▶ Correcting misperceptions about non-ingested gluten sources
▶ Debunking the idea that celiac disease is always to blame for a return of old symptoms
I
n some ways, celiac disease is a very straightforward condition: The 
bowel gets damaged from exposure to gluten, and by avoiding gluten all 
will likely be well. And in other ways, celiac disease is incredibly complex: 
Why does one person get celiac disease, yet someone else does not? Why 
does one person get a whole host of symptoms and someone else no symp-
toms at all? Why does one person run into other autoimmune diseases and 
someone else has no other health issues? The questions go on.
We think it’s this mixture of the readily explained, and the complex and confus-
ing that leads to so many of the myths, misperceptions and, at times, down-
right falsehoods that surround this often puzzling condition. In this chapter, 
we look at the ten most common such issues our patients bring up with us.
Heavy People Can’t Have Celiac Disease
As we discuss in Chapters 6 and 7, celiac disease causes malabsorption, 
meaning that nutrients you ingest are not properly absorbed into your body. 
These nutrients have to go somewhere, so if they are not being absorbed into 
your body, they then go out of your body (with your stool). Also, as the nutri-
ents are lost from your body, so are the calories they contain. It makes sense, 
therefore, to conclude that losing calories from your body would lead to 
weight loss. Indeed, this is exactly what happens to many people with active 
celiac disease.

320
Part V: The Part of Tens 
The thing is, however, when it comes to malabsorption due to celiac disease, 
it’s not an “all or none” issue. The substantial majority of people with active 
celiac disease successfully absorb into their body most of the nutrients (and 
thus, calories) they consume. They often do have some malabsorption; it’s 
just that it’s selective in terms of which nutrients are malabsorbed and lim-
ited in the degree to which they malabsorb. So if most nutrients — and the 
calories they contain — are being absorbed into the body, it comes down 
to how many calories are being ingested versus how many are being lost. 
For many people with celiac disease, just like for most people in general, the 
calories we eat exceed the calories we use up, leaving us with a net surplus of 
calories which ends up making us overweight.
Here are a couple of other reasons why people with celiac disease can be 
overweight:
 
✓ Perhaps the person was considerably overweight before he developed 
celiac disease. When he then acquired this condition, it could be he 
lost weight, perhaps even substantial weight, but depending on his size 
before he became ill, he may still carry around extra pounds at the time 
he was diagnosed.
 
✓ Once you follow a strict gluten-free diet, any problems you previously 
had with malabsorption will resolve. At that point you will, just the like 
everyone else, be at the mercy of that notorious and sometimes oh so 
frustrating balance between calorie intake and calorie expenditure.
Eat Gluten and You Feel Immediately Ill
If you have celiac disease, you should consume no gluten; it is the consump-
tion of gluten that leads to damage to your gut and the symptoms (see 
Chapter 6) that then arise. Having said that, it is a myth that all people with 
celiac disease immediately develop symptoms after ingesting gluten. Here are 
some important reasons for this:
 
✓ Not everyone with celiac disease has symptoms. You may well be 
one of the many people who were diagnosed either through screen-
ing (Chapter 4) or after an unexpected, abnormal test result was found 
(Chapter 7). So if you felt fine when you were consuming gluten before 
you were diagnosed with celiac disease, it’s quite possible that you 
will continue to feel well when you consume gluten after you were diag-
nosed. (Note: This is not a reason to resume ingesting gluten! If you 
have celiac disease, you should consume no gluten at all! Hmm, we think 
we’ve said that before.)

321
 Chapter 19: Ten Myths, Misperceptions, and Falsehoods about Celiac Disease
 
✓ Although ingesting gluten triggers your immune system and leads to 
damage to your intestine, this isn’t instantaneous. For most people 
with celiac disease, it takes days, weeks, or even months before the 
damage becomes severe enough to cause symptoms. This is unlike the 
immune problem seen if you have a peanut or bee sting allergy, in which 
case you have an immediate reaction upon exposure to these agents.
After reading the preceding list, you may have come to the conclusion that 
ingesting gluten will not make you feel immediately unwell. Excellent; we’re 
glad we convinced you. But — well, yeah, there’s a but — some people with 
celiac disease, for reasons that are unclear, do, in fact, start to feel unwell 
with symptoms of bloating, abdominal discomfort, and indigestion develop-
ing within hours of ingesting gluten.
So, is it a myth that if you consume gluten you will feel immediately unwell? 
For most people, yes, it’s a myth. But for some people it is a reality.
You Can Have Borderline Celiac Disease 
We never take exception when a person advises us that they or a loved one 
has “borderline” celiac disease. Oh, sure, it’s a myth, and one can no more 
have borderline celiac disease than one can be borderline pregnant, but the 
person with this misperception got it from somewhere and that somewhere 
is typically a well-meaning but misinformed friend, relative or — more com-
monly in years gone by — doctor. Like pregnancy, when it comes to celiac 
disease, you either have it or you don’t. And speaking of the myth of border-
line celiac disease, as we discuss in Chapter 17, it is also a myth that you can 
“outgrow” celiac disease.
If ever you have been told you had borderline celiac disease, most likely 
this happened because you had some other condition (a bowel infection, for 
example) or were too-quickly labeled as having celiac disease without benefit 
of a small intestine biopsy; then, when you got better, you were told that you 
got better because you only have borderline celiac disease.
Another possibility is that you do, in fact, have the real deal; that is, you 
were told you had borderline celiac disease, but you actually do have celiac 
disease. This is most likely to occur if the type of celiac disease you have is 
either the silent, or latent, form of the disease. These types of celiac disease 
are unassociated with symptoms. We discuss the various types of celiac dis-
ease in Chapter 5.
Because celiac disease is so important a condition, with so many health 
implications, if you’ve been diagnosed with “borderline celiac disease,” we 

322
Part V: The Part of Tens 
encourage you to speak to your physician to find out on what basis this 
determination was made. If you had a small intestine biopsy, ask your phy-
sician what it showed and compare these findings to those we discuss in 
Chapter 3. If you didn’t have a biopsy, ask what, if any, antibody studies were 
done and compare your results to those we also discuss in Chapter 3.
 
If you were told long ago that you had borderline celiac disease, it may (or 
may not) be worth your while to be retested for celiac disease beginning with 
having appropriate antibody or genetic testing done. (Often a genetic test is 
a particularly good way to start since, as we discuss in Chapter 3, if you don’t 
have certain genes, you almost certainly cannot have had, or ever get, celiac 
disease.) Be sure to speak to your current doctor about this.
You Cannot Eat Buckwheat
If you’re like us, when you think of buckwheat it’s not only the ingredient you 
think of, but Eddie Murphy’s impersonation of the Buckwheat character from 
the old TV show The Little Rascals.
Buckwheat doesn’t contain gluten and in fact, it is not even closely related 
to the wheat family. This grain is a healthy, nutritious addition to your diet, 
whether or not you have celiac disease. Amongst other uses, buckwheat can 
be used as an ingredient in pancakes or added to salads and soups.
 
There is, however, one important precaution: Some products contain both 
buckwheat and other, gluten-containing grains, so read labels carefully to 
make sure you only purchase pure buckwheat or buckwheat mixed only with 
other gluten-free ingredients.
You Must Avoid All Products with Gluten
Sometimes it seems to us that gluten is about as ubiquitous as the air we all 
breathe. As we discuss in Chapter 9, gluten can be found not only in foods, 
but also in some shampoos, creams, and lotions. A commonly held myth is 
that if you have celiac disease or dermatitis herpetiformis (DH), using such 
gluten-containing products can trigger your celiac disease or your DH. In a 
word (well, two actually), it can’t.
The only way that your celiac disease will be triggered is by you ingesting 
gluten. So long as your shampoo, cream, lotion, and so forth stay on your 
skin and out of your mouth (as if!), they won’t come in contact with your 

323
 Chapter 19: Ten Myths, Misperceptions, and Falsehoods about Celiac Disease
small intestine and thus, will be unable to cause your disease to flare. This is 
also true of DH which, as we discuss in detail in Chapter 8, is a skin disease 
very closely linked with celiac disease. If you have DH, it is safe for you to use 
gluten-containing topical products.
Lipstick may also contain gluten, but so long as your lipstick does as its name 
says it should — that is, stick to your lips — your insides will remain a stranger 
to your lipstick’s gluten and thus, your use of lipstick won’t pose a risk.
 
For the sake of completeness, we’ll add one qualifier here: Albeit very rare, 
it is possible that some speck of gluten-containing lipstick will, indeed, find 
its way into your insides and lead to problems. So if you’re strictly avoiding 
gluten yet you continue to have gastrointestinal symptoms, make sure your 
lipstick is gluten-free. You’ll need to contact the lipstick manufacturer to find 
this out.
Vinegar Is Forbidden
As an impressionable youngster, Ian recalls being seated at a not-yet-cleaned 
table at a famous delicatessen in Montreal. The waiter came by, took the 
vinegar bottle off the table, turned it upside down, and sprinkled its contents 
over the table. He then grabbed a cloth and wiped off the dirty table. Hmm, 
vinegar as a cleaning solution? Guess so. (But, Ian wondered, did he now 
really want to put a cleaning solution on his French fries?) One commonly 
held myth about celiac disease is that if you have this condition, the only 
acceptable use for vinegar is as a cleaning solution. Well, if you, too, have 
this understanding, then we’re pleased to say it ain’t so. As it turns out, apart 
from malt vinegar, vinegar is perfectly fine for you to consume if you have 
celiac disease.
The reason for the exclusion of malt vinegar from the “vinegar is safe” policy 
is because it is made by malting barley and, as we discuss in Chapter 2, 
barley contains gluten. For this reason, if you have celiac disease, you should 
not consume malt vinegar.
Feeling Fine Means No Celiac Disease
People with celiac disease can have nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal 
cramps, diarrhea, weight loss and, as we look at in Chapter 6, many other 
symptoms. And people with celiac disease can have no symptoms at all. 
When we tell someone in the former group the news that we’ve discovered 

324
Part V: The Part of Tens 
the cause of their problem (celiac disease), this is typically greeted with 
mixed emotions: relief at knowing that a cause has been found and that 
treatment will relieve their symptoms; and upset at finding out they have a 
chronic disease to contend with.
On the other hand, when we determine — such as at the time of screening a 
relative of a person with celiac disease — that a person who is entirely free 
of symptoms nonetheless has celiac disease, we are frequently greeted with 
disbelief. “How can I have celiac disease? Celiac disease makes you feel lousy, 
and I feel fine,” we often hear.
As it is, however, you can feel perfectly well yet not only have celiac disease, 
but actually have or later develop complications from it such as osteoporosis 
and anemia. Although in some ways, that you may feel perfectly well yet have 
celiac disease is good — who wants to feel unwell after all? — it can actually 
be bad because it understandably makes it harder for many people to accept 
the diagnosis and to follow a gluten-free diet.
 
If your celiac disease was discovered during investigations to find out why 
you had some other health problem such as iron deficiency or osteoporosis, 
but, because you have no symptoms, you don’t believe you actually have the 
condition and therefore haven’t adopted a gluten-free diet, we strongly recom-
mend you speak to your celiac disease specialist (or primary care provider) 
and share your thoughts with them. She can then review with you on what 
basis the diagnosis was made and, if it turns out the diagnosis is uncertain, 
further evaluation would be in order. Otherwise, if the evidence is incontro-
vertible, we hope you come to accept that you have celiac disease and follow 
a gluten-free diet. It’s your health after all, and you need to protect it. 
If, however, you have silent or latent celiac disease (see Chapter 5) and 
therefore have no apparent health problems, you and your physician need to 
decide together whether you should be treated.
You Are More Likely to Have Food 
Allergies and Food Intolerance
One common misunderstanding surrounding celiac disease is the impres-
sion that having this particular food-related condition makes you more likely 
to have other food-related conditions such as food allergies or intolerance. 
We can certainly see where this concern arises since all these conditions 
are related to the ingestion of food, but, in fact, with the exception of lac-
tose intolerance (which we discuss in detail in Chapter 11) that’s pretty well 
where the similarities end.

325
 Chapter 19: Ten Myths, Misperceptions, and Falsehoods about Celiac Disease
As we discuss in Chapter 2, there are major differences between celiac dis-
ease, food allergies, and food intolerance, including the time between when 
you eat something and when you start to react to it, the symptoms that 
occur, and the underling immune problem, if any. Given the disparate nature 
to these conditions, discussing them in the same breath is, in keeping with 
our food theme, like comparing apples to oranges.
You Can’t Share Cooking Implements
As we mention repeatedly in this book, having celiac disease means you must 
avoid any and all gluten. So you might reasonably conclude that would mean 
you should not share a toaster or cooking utensils with family members who 
are not on a gluten-free diet, lest these items become “contaminated” with 
gluten which might then be ingested.
Well, as it turns out, when it comes to sharing a toaster this isn’t quite as 
black and white as it might at first appear. It depends on the type of toaster 
you use:
 
✓ Toasters with removable racks: If you use a toaster with racks, so long 
as you clean the racks (soap and water will do) before you use them, 
you’ll be fine and you don’t require a separate toaster.
 
✓ Upright toasters: If your family shares an upright toaster (which typically 
does not have removable racks), then it’s very difficult to avoid having 
your bread pick up someone else’s crumbs. Therefore, you may be 
better off using your own toaster.
As for sharing cooking utensils, again, so long as you thoroughly wash them 
before you use them to prepare your own, gluten-free foods, you’ll be fine.
For more information on these and other issues about cross-contamination 
have a look at Chapter 10.
If Your Old Symptoms Return, It’s Likely 
Due to Celiac Disease
If you have celiac disease and you’re meticulously following a gluten-free 
diet, you probably feel just fine. But, perhaps you can recall a time prior to 
your diagnosis, a time when — if you’re like many people with celiac dis-
ease — you had gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as nausea or cramps or 
bloating or diarrhea or one of the many other celiac disease symptoms that 

326
Part V: The Part of Tens 
we describe in detail in Chapter 6. Having this recollection, it would be per-
fectly understandable, should you happen to redevelop these symptoms, if you 
were to say to yourself “before I was diagnosed with celiac disease, I had these 
symptoms, and now they’re back, so my celiac disease is likely responsible.”
Well, although we agree that this line of thought would be perfectly reason-
able, it may not actually be right. Indeed, if you’re being really careful with 
your gluten-free diet, there’s a darn good chance that your recurrent symp-
toms are unrelated to your celiac disease and may be due to something 
else altogether. In other words, having excellently controlled celiac disease 
doesn’t protect you from getting the same, other health problems that 
anyone else can get. Also, as we discuss in Chapter 8, having celiac disease 
does increase your risk of developing certain other ailments.
Here are just a few examples of symptoms that may mislead you (and, by the 
way, your health care provider) into prematurely concluding your celiac dis-
ease is flaring:
 
✓ Abdominal cramps and diarrhea. Sure, these symptoms could reflect a 
flare of your celiac disease. On the other hand, they could actually mean 
you’ve come down with a gastrointestinal infection (like stomach flu or 
food poisoning for example).
 
✓ Nausea. Perhaps this is due not to your celiac disease, but has occurred 
as a side effect from a new medication you’re taking.
 
✓ Fatigue. Type “fatigue” into an Internet search engine and you’ll get mil-
lions of hits. Type “fatigue” and “celiac disease” into that same search 
engine and you’ll get several hundred thousand hits. In other words, 
there are tons of causes of fatigue unrelated to celiac disease.
 
✓ Weight loss. Although active celiac disease causes malabsorption and 
this in turn can lead to weight loss, many other conditions also cause 
weight loss, including hyperthyroidism (thyroid over-functioning) which 
occurs with increased frequency amongst people with celiac disease — 
regardless whether the celiac disease is under control.
Having said all this, you shouldn’t discount the possibility that your symp-
toms are indeed indicative of your celiac disease flaring. What to do? We rec-
ommend, if you redevelop GI problems or other of your previous symptoms 
and they don’t promptly settle, that you check carefully to see whether you 
are inadvertently ingesting gluten (see Chapter 10 for a discussion on what 
foods contain gluten and on hidden sources of gluten).
If you are accidentally consuming gluten, of course you need to eliminate 
this. If you’re not, then, as we discuss in detail in Chapter 12, there remain a 
number of other possible causes that may account for your symptoms and 
for which you and your health care provider can explore.

Part VI
Appendixes

In this part . . .
H
ere are two appendixes you won’t want to remove. 
In this part, we share Web sites worth visiting and 
we look at organizations that are available to assist people 
living with celiac disease.

Appendix A
Web Sites Wor th Visiting
W
e love the Internet. It’s a treasure-trove of useful information that can 
help a person stay informed, stay current, and stay healthy.
We hate the Internet. It’s a storehouse of useless tripe that can mislead, mis-
guide, and cause misadventure.
Geesh, so what is a person with celiac disease to do? Well, you can continue 
reading this appendix, because here we list a whole bunch of Web sites that 
have a reputation for providing accurate and useful information.
The information you’ll find on these sites will likely be of value not only to 
you, but also to your family and friends, and, depending on your particular 
situation, perhaps workmates or classmates with whom you spend time (and 
to whom you’re hesitant to lend out this book lest you never see it again! Just 
kidding of course. Sort of.).
In this appendix, you discover Web sites ranging from those devoted to gluten-
free cooking to where to get dining cards (these, as we discuss in Chapter 
10, are cards that contain celiac disease information that you would give to 
wait staff in restaurants) to allied health issues and everything in between. 
(We don’t, however, include Web sites that focus on gluten sensitivity. Gluten 
sensitivity, as we discuss in Chapter 12, is, at least at the present time, an ill-
defined entity without solid scientific studies from which to make recommen-
dations about diagnosis or treatment.)
The list of sites in this appendix is by no means all inclusive and, given the 
rate new celiac disease related businesses and organizations are popping 
up and given the inherently dynamic nature of the Web, it’s guaranteed 
that there will always be new sites regularly making an appearance on the 
Internet. Therefore, if your favorite Web site is not listed here, please realize 
that we did not omit good sources of information intentionally. (Have a site 
you particularly like? We’d love to hear about it. You can reach us at celiac 
disease@ianblumer.com.)

Part VI: Appendixes 
Four footnotes before we get to our list:
 
✓ If you’re looking for university-based celiac disease centers, celiac dis-
ease support groups, or celiac disease foundations, you can find these 
listed in Appendix B.
 
✓ If you’re wondering whether you should trust a site that you come 
across as you surf the Web and that isn’t listed in this Appendix, have a 
look at Chapter 1 where we discuss helpful ways to determine the likely 
worth of a Web site.
 
✓ If you follow one of the URLs (that is, Web addresses) that we provide 
and get a message along the likes of “this page is no longer available” or 
“this page has been removed” or some other similar (frustrating) mes-
sage, instead try going to the home page of the site and look for a new 
link to the page you’re searching for. (Often the easiest way to get to the 
home page of a Web site is to delete everything in the address bar of 
your browser after .com or.org and so on then press Enter.)
 
✓ Last, and most importantly, always first speak to your health care pro-
viders before you make any change to your celiac disease (or other 
health) management based on what you’ve read on a Web site.
Oh, okay, we can’t help ourselves; we’ve got one other footnote to mention 
before we move on. Some of the sites we list here are commercial and have 
products such as gluten-free cookbooks for sale. These cookbooks can be 
very helpful and that’s why we mention the sites in the first place. For the 
record, though, we want to note that we have no affiliation whatsoever with 
any of these sites and in particular no financial interest.
General Celiac Disease Web Sites
If you’re looking for general information on celiac disease, in addition to 
checking out those organizations and support groups we list in Appendix B, 
you can surf over to the sites we list here.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) 
Celiac Disease Awareness Campaign
www.celiac.nih.gov
This excellent site, run by the National Digestive Diseases Information 
Clearinghouse (which is a service of the National Institute of Diabetes and 
Digestive and Kidney Diseases), and a result of the combined efforts of 

331
 Appendix A: Web Sites Worth Visiting
professional, voluntary, and governmental organizations, has as its goal to 
“heighten awareness of celiac disease among health care professionals and 
the public.” It does this by presenting information in a concise, straightfor-
ward and very readable way.
Children’s Digestive Health and 
Nutrition Foundation (CDHNF)
www.celiachealth.org
This site, run by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, 
Hepatology and Nutrition (NASPGHAN), is intended to “provide a vital 
resource for medical professionals, parents and patients.” A highlight of the 
site is its excellent series of PDFs on various important celiac disease topics.
Determining Whether Your 
Child Is Growing Properly
A child with celiac disease is at risk of not growing at a normal rate. (We dis-
cuss this issue in Chapter 14.) Therefore, tracking the child’s growth as they 
get older is important. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has 
a series of charts at www.cdc.gov/growthcharts to help you calculate 
whether your child’s growth is progressing as it should.
Determining Whether You or Your 
Child Are at a Healthy Weight
www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Web site, designed to be 
“your online source for credible health information,” provides interactive 
forms to calculate body mass index (BMI) for both adults and children. 
Knowing your BMI provides an indicator if one is at a healthy weight, over-
weight, or underweight. (We discuss BMI and its implications in Chapter 15.)

332
Part VI: Appendixes 
General Nutrition, Vitamins, 
and Minerals
In Chapter 10, we focus on the nutritional needs of one’s diet. Here are some 
sites that provide helpful information on healthy eating.
The Center for Nutrition Policy of 
the United States Department 
of Agriculture
www.mypyramid.gov
This branch of government has created MyPyramid.gov to provide “steps to 
a healthier you.” On this site you’ll find lots of information on healthy eating 
and, in a clear sign of this digital era, podcasts for download.
The National Institutes of Health 
Office of Dietary Supplements
www.ods.od.nih.gov
This site provides detailed information on the use of dietary supplements.
Health Canada
www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/index-eng.php
Health Canada’s highly respected Eating Well With Canada’s Food Guide is 
available at this site. Sure, it’s got a long Web site address, but it’s well worth 
the effort of typing it into your favorite Web browser.
The National Dairy Council
www.nationaldairycouncil.org
The National Dairy Council site has, as you might expect, information on 
dairy nutrition. Here you will find information on vitamin D and calcium, and 
there are also helpful materials on lactose intolerance.

333
 Appendix A: Web Sites Worth Visiting
Gluten-Free Cooking and Eating
In Chapter 10, we discuss the ins and outs of a gluten-free diet. The sites we 
list in this section provide you with additional information on eating gluten-
free. (Also, see Appendix B for a listing of other celiac disease support groups 
and organizations that provide a wealth of information on eating gluten-free.). 
Many of these sites also have free online recipes and some have gluten-free 
cookbooks for sale. One thing pretty well all the sites listed below share in 
common is having a very creative name.
 
✓ The Celiac Scene (www.theceliacscene.com) has an excellent search 
tool to help you find restaurants that make a point of having gluten-free 
menu options.
 
✓ The Gluten Free Dietitian (aka: Tricia Thompson, MS, RD) created her 
site (http://glutenfreedietitian.com) to “help you or someone 
you love successfully follow a nutritious gluten-free diet.” Tricia’s site 
advises she will do her best to respond to emails sent to her.
 
✓ Glutenfreeda (www.glutenfreeda.com) is designed to “help people 
with dietary restrictions return to a normal life of eating, cooking and 
entertaining.” They state they provide “the largest collection of gluten 
free recipes in the world” with over 3,000 recipes. We’re drooling 
already!
 
✓ Celiac Central (www.celiaccentral.org) is the Web site of the 
National Foundation for Celiac Awareness, an organization “dedicated 
to raising awareness and funding for celiac disease that will advance 
research, education and screening amongst medical professionals, chil-
dren, and adults on a gluten free diet.”
 
✓ Carol Fenster’s Savory Palate (www.savorypalate.com) offers a 
selection of gluten-free recipes.

Shauna James Ahern and has stunning pictures of (and recipes for) 
gluten-free foods.

the well known Canadian dietitian, Shelley Case. Shelley specializes in 
gluten-free nutrition.
 
✓ Hey That Tastes Good (www.heythattastesgood.com) is aptly sub-
titled “How I learned that gluten-free doesn’t mean taste-free.”
 
✓ La Tartine Gourmande (www.latartinegourmande.com) has a large 
inventory of recipes, but note that not all of them are gluten-free so 
make sure you follow the appropriate link to get to the site’s gluten-free 
section.

334
Part VI: Appendixes 
Ordering Gluten-Free Foods Online
There are more and more Web sites where you can purchase gluten-free 
foods. (Also, in Appendix B we list some celiac disease organizations and 
support groups that have information on this topic.) Here are a few Web sites 
that have caught our eye and our taste buds:
 
✓ Against The Grain (www.againstthegraingourmet.com), in addition 
to having a very clever name, has as its goal to “bring dietary normalcy to 
those requiring a gluten-free diet, and distinctive, great tasting bread for 
everyone else.” One of their offerings, their “Original Gluten-free Baguettes,” 
is a favorite of Peter, Sheila’s husband who lives with celiac disease.
 
✓ ’Cause You’re Special (www.causeyourespecial.com) offers “gour-
met gluten-free foods.” Their Hearty Biscuit Mix has received rave 
reviews from members of Sheila’s local celiac disease support group.
 
✓ Olive Nation (www.olivenation.com) features Italian food including 
gluten-free pasta. Le Veneziane Corn Pasta is 100 percent corn and very 
good!
 
✓ Da Luciano (www.dalucianos.com) features gluten-free pizza and pasta.
Where to Buy Pure Oats
As we discuss in Chapter 10, consuming oats if you have celiac disease is 
almost always perfectly safe so long as it pure oats (that is, oats not contami-
nated with some other grain) you are eating. Here are sites where you can 
order pure oats:
 
✓ Gifts of Nature Oats (www.giftsofnature.net)
 
✓ Gluten-Free Oats (www.glutenfreeoats.com)
 
✓ Chateau Cream Hill Estates (www.creamhillestates.com)
 
✓ FarmPure Foods (www.onlyoats.ca)
 
✓ Great Northern Growers (www.greatnortherngrowers.com)
Choosing a Gluten-Free Beer
Beer is brewed from grains that contain gluten so there is always concern 
whether beer may contain gluten. The process of making most beers gets rid 
of the gluten but to be safe a number of breweries in North America are sell-
ing gluten-free beer made from sorghum, millet, buckwheat, rice, honey, and 
hops. Here are some breweries and the name(s) of their gluten-free beer(s):

335

ranging products to assist the person living with celiac disease as they 
trek around the globe.
Dietary Restrictions Apart 
from Living Gluten-Free
As we discuss in Chapter 11, individuals with celiac disease may have 
additional dietary restrictions. These add to the challenge of maintaining 
adequate nutritional intake whilst remaining gluten-free. Here are some Web 
sites to assist you if you have lactose intolerance, are a vegetarian, or have 
food allergies:
Lactose intolerance
The National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse (http://
digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/lactoseintolerance/
index.htm) is an excellent resource to learn more about living with lactose 
intolerance.
Following a vegetarian diet
Here are some Web sites designed to help people follow a vegetarian diet:
 
✓ The Vegetarian Resource Group (www.vrg.org) is a non-profit orga-
nization that has, as part of its stated mandate, a goal of “educating the 
public on vegetarianism.”

The following sites can provide information and assistance in getting the help 
you or your loved one need whether it is keeping gluten-free while residing in 
a nursing home or assisting with the financial costs of living gluten-free:
 
✓ The Celiac Sprue Association (www.csaceliacs.org/documents/
THENURSINGHOMECHALLENGE.pdf) discusses nursing home challenges 
faced by people living with celiac disease.

deductions incurred by having celiac disease.

338
Part VI: Appendixes 
Other Gastrointestinal Conditions
As we discuss in Chapter 12, if you have celiac disease and you continue to 
have gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms despite following a gluten-free diet, it 
could be that you have some other, coexisting GI condition. Here are some 
Web sites where you can find more information on some of these conditions.
Inflammatory bowel disease
The Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (www.ccfa.org) and the 
Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation Canada (www.ccfc.ca) Web sites contain very 
helpful information about Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis.
Functional gastrointestinal disorders
Useful information about the many forms of functional GI disorders includ-
ing irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia can be found on the 
Web sites of the International Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal 
Disorders (www.iffgd.org) and the Rome Foundation (www.therome 
foundation.org).

Appendix B
Organizations for People 
with Celiac Disease
I
n the past decade, there has been a relative explosion in the number of 
societies, centers, foundations, and support groups for and about celiac 
disease. We list these in this appendix. Although this list is comprehensive, 
new celiac disease bodies are born all the time, so there will invariably be 
some organizations not captured here. If yours isn’t listed, heavens, we mean 
no disrespect.
Celiac Disease Societies 
and Support Groups
As we discuss in Chapter 1, if you have celiac disease you may find belonging 
to a support group helpful, as you can become acquainted with others who 
share your condition, who know its challenges, and who have insights into — 
and tips on — dealing with and ultimately mastering it. You will be able to 
derive support and knowledge through the group’s social and educational 
programs.
In this section, we list the major national societies and support organiza-
tions. There are also many smaller, excellent, support groups such as the one 
based out of Sheila’s university medical center which, because of space con-
straints, we unfortunately can’t include here.
The organizations we discuss in this appendix have many chapters; you can 
find them listed on the main Web sites that we provide.

Part VI: Appendixes 
Celiac Disease Centers at University-
based Medical Institutions
Many university-based (academic) institutions have centers that specialize 
in — and have resources devoted to — celiac disease. Here are some of these 
institutions, organized by region and listed alphabetically by city. The Web 
address for most of these centers is overwhelmingly long (and defies even 
the most deft keyboarder to transcribe correctly) so in most cases we’ve 
written the institution’s main address from where you can use their search 
engine or links to find their celiac disease clinic.
