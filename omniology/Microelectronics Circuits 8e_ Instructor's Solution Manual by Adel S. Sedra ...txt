Ex: 1.9 (a) D can represent 15 equally-spaced
values between 0 and 3.75 V. Thus, the values are
spaced 0.25 V apart.
vA = 0 V ⇒D = 0000
vA = 0.25 V ⇒D = 0000
vA = 1 V ⇒D = 0000
vA = 3.75 V ⇒D = 0000
(b) (i) 1 level spacing: 20 × +0.25 = +0.25 V
(ii) 2 level spacings: 21 × +0.25 = +0.5 V
(iii) 4 level spacings: 22 × +0.25 = +1.0 V
(iv) 8 level spacings: 23 × +0.25 = +2.0 V
(c) The closest discrete value represented by D is
+1.25 V; thus D = 0101. The error is -0.05 V, or
−0.05/1.3 × 100 = −4%.
Ex: 1.10 Voltage gain = 20 log 100 = 40 dB
Current gain = 20 log 1000 = 60 dB

Solutions to End-of-Chapter Problems
1.1 (a) V = IR = 5 mA × 1 k = 5 V
P = I2R = (5 mA)2 × 1 k = 25 mW
(b) R = V/I = 5 V/1 mA = 5 k
P = VI = 5 V × 1 mA = 5 mW
(c) I = P/V = 100 mW/10 V = 10 mA
R = V/I = 10 V/10 mA = 1 k
(d) V = P/I = 1 mW/0.1 mA
= 10 V
R = V/I = 10 V/0.1 mA = 100 k
(e) P = I2R ⇒I =

1000 mW/1 k = 31.6 mA
V = IR = 31.6 mA × 1 k = 31.6 V
Note: V, mA, k, and mW constitute a
consistent set of units.
1.2 (a) I = V
R = 5 V
1 k = 5 mA
(b) R = V
I = 5 V
1 mA = 5 k
(c) V = IR = 0.1 mA × 10 k = 1 V
(d) I = V
R =
1 V
100  = 0.01 A = 10 mA
Note: Volts, milliamps, and kilohms constitute a
consistent set of units.
1.3 (a) P = I2R = (20 × 10−3)2 × 1 × 103
= 0.4 W
Thus, R should have a 1
2-W rating.
(b) P = I2R = (40 × 10−3)2 × 1 × 103
= 1.6 W
Thus, the resistor should have a 2-W rating.
(c) P = I2R = (1 × 10−3)2 × 100 × 103
= 0.1 W
Thus, the resistor should have a 1
8-W rating.
(d) P = I2R = (4 × 10−3)2 × 10 × 103
= 0.16 W
Thus, the resistor should have a 1
4-W rating.
(e) P = V2/R = 202/(1 × 103) = 0.4 W
Thus, the resistor should have a 1
2-W rating.
(f) P = V2/R = 112/(1 × 103) = 0.121 W
Thus, a rating of 1
8 W should theoretically
suffice, though 1
4 W would be prudent to allow
for inevitable tolerances and measurement errors.
1.4 See figure on next page, which shows how to
realize the required resistance values.
1.5 Shunting the 10 k by a resistor of value of
R results in the combination having a resistance
Req,
Req =
10R
R + 10
Thus, for a 1% reduction,
R
R + 10 = 0.99 ⇒R = 990 k
For a 5% reduction,
R
R + 10 = 0.95 ⇒R = 190 k
For a 10% reduction,
R
R + 10 = 0.90 ⇒R = 90 k
For a 50% reduction,
R
R + 10 = 0.50 ⇒R = 10 k
Shunting the 10 k by
(a) 1 M results in
Req = 10 × 1000
1000 + 10 = 10
1.01 = 9.9 k
a 1% reduction;
(b) 100 k results in
Req = 10 × 100
100 + 10 = 10
1.1 = 9.09 k
a 9.1% reduction;
(c) 10 k results in
Req =

10 + 10 = 5 k
a 50% reduction.

To make the current through R equal to 0.2I, we

that the current through it will be 0.8I; thus
0.2IR = 0.8IR1 ⇒R1 = R

The input resistance of the divider, Rin, is
Rin = R ∥R1 = R ∥R

Now if R1 is 10% too high, that is, if
R1 = 1.1R

the problem can be solved in two ways:
(a) Connect a resistor R2 across R1 of value such
that R2 ∥R1 = R/4, thus
R2(1.1R/4)
R2 + (1.1R/4) = R

1.14 For RL = 10 k , when signal source
generates 0−0.5 mA, a voltage of 0−2 V may
appear across the source
To limit vs ≤1 V, the net resistance has to be

(a) Node equation at the common mode yields
I3 = I1 + I2
Using the fact that the sum of the voltage drops
across R1 and R3 equals 10 V, we write
10 = I1R1 + I3R3
= 10I1 + (I1 + I2) × 2
= 12I1 + 2I2
That is,
12I1 + 2I2 = 10
(1)
Similarly, the voltage drops across R2 and R3 add
up to 5 V, thus
5 = I2R2 + I3R3
= 5I2 + (I1 + I2) × 2
which yields
2I1 + 7I2 = 5
(2)
Equations (1) and (2) can be solved together by
multiplying Eq. (2) by 6:
12I1 + 42I2 = 30
(3)
Now, subtracting Eq. (1) from Eq. (3) yields
40I2 = 20
⇒I2 = 0.5 mA
Substituting in Eq. (2) gives
2I1 = 5 −7 × 0.5 mA
⇒I1 = 0.75 mA
I3 = I1 + I2
= 0.75 + 0.5
= 1.25 mA
V = I3R3
= 1.25 × 2 = 2.5 V
To summarize:
I1 = 0.75 mA
I2 = 0.5 mA
I3 = 1.25 mA
V = 2.5 V
(b) A node equation at the common node can be
written in terms of V as
10 −V
R1
+ 5 −V
R2
= V
R3
Thus,
10 −V
10
+ 5 −V
5
= V
2
⇒0.8V = 2
⇒V = 2.5 V
Now, I1, I2, and I3 can be easily found as
I1 = 10 −V
10
= 10 −2.5
10
= 0.75 mA
I2 = 5 −V
5
= 5 −2.5
5
= 0.5 mA
I3 = V
R3
= 2.5
2 = 1.25 mA
Method (b) is much preferred, being faster, more
insightful, and less prone to errors. In general,
one attempts to identify the lowest possible
number of variables and write the corresponding
minimum number of equations.

that is, without a load connected. It follows that

1.34 Comparing the given waveform to that
described by Eq. (1.2), we observe that the given
waveform has an amplitude of 0.5 V (1 V
peak-to-peak) and its level is shifted up by 0.5 V
(the first term in the equation). Thus the
waveform looks as follows:
v

1.36 The two harmonics have the ratio
126/98 = 9/7. Thus, these are the 7th and 9th
harmonics. From Eq. (1.2), we note that the
amplitudes of these two harmonics will have the
ratio 7 to 9, which is confirmed by the
measurement reported. Thus the fundamental will
have a frequency of 98/7, or 14 kHz, and peak
amplitude of 63 × 7 = 441 mV. The rms value of
the fundamental will be 441/
√
2 = 312 mV. To
find the peak-to-peak amplitude of the square
wave, we note that 4V/π = 441 mV. Thus,

1.38 If the amplitude of the square wave is Vsq,
then the power delivered by the square wave to a

Example 1.3 the input resistance of the first stage
is much larger than the source resistance.

1.61 To obtain the weighted sum of v1 and v2

their output currents. Each transconductance

Consider first the path for the signal requiring
higher gain, namely v2. See figure at top of next
page.
The parallel connection of the two amplifiers at
the output and the connection of RL means that
the total resistance at the output is
10 k ∥10 k ∥10 k = 10
3 k.

vo2 = v2

10 + 10 × Gm2 × 10
3
= v2 × 0.5 × 20 × 10
3 = 33.3v2
To reduce the gain seen by v2 from 33.3 to 20, we
connect a resistance Rp in parallel with RL,
10
3 ∥Rp

= 2 k ⇒Rp = 5 k
We next consider the path for v1. Since v1 must
see a gain factor of only 10, which is half that
seen by v2, we have to reduce the fraction of v1
that appears at the input of its transconductance
amplifier to half that that appears at the input of
the v2 transconductance amplifier. We just saw
that 0.5 v2 appears at the input of the v2
transconductance amplifier. Thus, for the v1
transconductance amplifier, we want 0.25v1 to
appear at the input. This can be achieved by
shunting the input of the v1 transconductance
amplifier by a resistance Rp1 as in the figure in
the next column.

The correspondences between the current and
voltage variables are indicated by comparing the
two equivalent-circuit models above. At the
outset we observe that at the input side of the
g-parameter model, we have the controlled
current source g12I2. This has no correspondence
in the equivalent-circuit model of Fig. 1.16(a). It
represents internal feedback, internal to the
amplifier circuit. In developing the model of
Fig. 1.16(a), we assumed that the amplifier is
unilateral (i.e., has no internal feedback, or that
the input side does not know what happens at the
output side). If we neglect this internal feedback,
that is, assume g12 = 0, we can compare the two
models and thus obtain:
Ri = 1/g11
Avo = g21

1.77 Since the overall transfer function is that of
three identical STC LP circuits in cascade (but
with no loading effects, since the buffer
amplifiers have infinite input and zero output
resistances) the overall gain will drop by 3 dB
below the value at dc at the frequency for which
the gain of each STC circuit is 1 dB down. This
frequency is found as follows: The transfer
function of each STC circuit is
T(s) =
1
1 + s
ω0
where
ω0 = 1/CR

1.78 Since when C is connected to node A the
3-dB frequency is reduced by a large factor, the
value of C must be much larger than whatever
parasitic capacitance originally existed at node A
(i.e., between A and ground). Furthermore, it
must be that C is now the dominant determinant
of the amplifier 3-dB frequency (i.e., it is
dominating over whatever may be happening at
node B or anywhere else in the amplifier). Thus,
we can write
200 kHz =

1.79 The LP factor 1/(1 + jf/105) results in a
Bode plot like that in Fig. 1.23(a) with the
3-dB frequency f0 = 105 Hz. The high-pass factor
1/(1 + 102/jf) results in a Bode plot like that in
Fig. 1.24(a) with the 3-dB frequency
f0 = 102 Hz.
The Bode plot for the overall transfer function
can be obtained by summing the dB values of the
two individual plots and then shifting the
resulting plot vertically by 60 dB (corresponding

When this condition applies, the attenuator is said

Thus when the attenuator is compensated
(C1R1 = C2R2), its transmission can be
determined either by its two resistors R1, R2 or by
its two capacitors. C1, C2, and the transmission is
not a function of frequency.
1.83 The HP STC circuit whose response
determines the frequency response of the
amplifier in the low-frequency range has a phase
angle of 5.7◦at f = 100 Hz. Using the equation
for ∠T(jω) from Table 1.2, we obtain
tan−1 f0
100 = 5.7◦⇒f0 = 10 Hz
The LP STC circuit whose response determines
the amplifier response at the high-frequency end
has a phase angle of −5.7◦at f = 1 kHz. Using
the relationship for ∠T(jω) given in Table 1.2,
we obtain for the LP STC circuit.
−tan−1 103

B = 7.3 × 1015 cm−3K−3/2;
k = 8.62 × 10−5eV/K; and Eg = 1.12 V

Substituting the values given in the problem,

For intrinsic silicon,

Using μn = 1350 cm2/V · s and
μp = 480 cm2/V · s, and q = 1.6 × 10−19 C we
have
ρ = 2.28 × 105 -cm.
Using R = ρ · L
A with L = 0.001 cm and
A = 3 × 10−8 cm2, we have
R = 7.6 × 109 .
(b) nn ≈ND = 5 × 1016 cm−3;

nn

Using μn = 1200 cm2/V · s and

nn

As expected, since ND is increased by 100, the
resistivity decreases by the same factor.

1.101 This is a one-sided junction, with the
depletion layer extending almost entirely into the
more lightly doped (n-type) material. A thin
space-charge region in the p-type region stores
the same total charge with higher much higher

Increasing ND by 4× will increase the charge
density on the n −type side of the junction by 4×.
We see from Eq. (1.45) that since NA ≫ND ≫ni
(i.e. at least a couple of orders of magnitude) a
4× increase in ND will have comparatively little
effect on V0. Thus, we can assume V0 is
unchanged in Eq. (1.49), and the junction width

Solutions to Exercises within the Chapter
Ex: 2.1 The minimum number of terminals
required by a single op amp is 5: two input
terminals, one output terminal, one terminal for
positive power supply, and one terminal for
negative power supply.
The minimum number of terminals required by a
quad op amp is 14: each op amp requires two
input terminals and one output terminal
(accounting for 12 terminals for the four op
amps). In addition, the four op amps can all share
one terminal for positive power supply and one
terminal for negative power supply.
Ex: 2.2 Relevant equations are:
v3 = A(v2 −v1); vId = v2 −v1,
vIcm = 1
2(v1 + v2)
(a)
v1 = v2 −v3
A = 0 −4
103 = −0.004 V = −4 mV
vId = v2 −v1 = 0 −(−0.004) = +0.004 V
= 4 mV
vIcm = 1
2(−4 mV + 0) = −2 mV
(b) −10 = 103(2 −v1) ⇒v1 = 2.01 V
vId = v2 −v1 = 2 −2.01 = −0.01 V = −10 mV
vIcm = 1
2(v1 + v2) = 1
2(2.01 + 2) = 2.005 V
≃2 V
(c)
v3 = A(v2 −v1) = 103(1.998 −2.002) = −4 V
vId = v2 −v1 = 1.998 −2.002 = −4 mV
vIcm = 1
2(v1 + v2) = 1
2(2.002 + 1.998) = 2 V
(d)
−1.2 = 103[v2 −(−1.2)] = 103(v2 + 1.2)
⇒v2 = −1.2012 V
vId = v2 −v1 = −1.2012 −(−1.2)
= −0.0012 V = −1.2 mV
vIcm = 1
2(v1 + v2) = 1
2[ −1.2 + (−1.2012)]
≃−1.2 V
Ex: 2.3 From Fig. E2.3 we have: v3 = μvd and
vd = (Gmv2 −Gmv1)R = GmR(v2 −v1)
Therefore:
v3 = μGmR(v2 −v1)
That is, the open-loop gain of the op amp is
A = μGmR. For Gm = 20 mA/V and
μ = 50, we have:
A = 50 × 20 × 5 = 5000 V/V, or equivalently,
74 dB.
Ex: 2.4 The gain and input resistance of the
inverting amplifier circuit shown in Fig. 2.5 are
−R2
R1
and R1, respectively. Therefore, we have:
R1 = 100 k and
−R2
R1
= −10 ⇒R2 = 10 R1
Thus:
R2 = 10 × 100 k = 1 M

From Table 1.1 we have:

The negative input terminal of the op amp (i.e.,
vi) is a virtual ground, thus vi = 0:
vo = vi −Rii = 0 −Rii = −Rii
Rm = vo
ii

io = 0

ii

= −10 k
Ri = vi
ii
and vi is a virtual ground (vi = 0),
thus Ri = 0
ii

Since we are assuming that the op amp in this
transresistance amplifier is ideal, the op amp has
zero output resistance and therefore the output
resistance of this transresistance amplifier is also
zero. That is Ro = 0 .

Connecting the signal source shown in Fig. E2.5

vi is a virtual ground that is vi = 0, thus the
current flowing through the 10-k resistor

Therefore,

If A = 105, then G = 9.999 and ϵ = −0.01%

Exercise 2–5

for the circuit to behave as a difference amplifier
with a gain of 10 and an input resistance of
20 k, we require
Ad = R2
R1
= 10 and
RId = 2R1 = 20 k ⇒R1 = 10 k and
R2 = AdR1 = 10 × 10 k = 100 k
Therefore, R1 = R3 = 10 k and
R2 = R4 = 100 k.

Ex: 2.21
Refer to the model in Fig. 2.29 and observe that
v+ −v−= VOS + v2 −v1 = VOS + vId
and since vO = v3 = A(v+ −v−), then
vO = A(vId + VOS)
(1)
where A = 104 V/V and VOS = 5 mV. From
Eq. (1) we see that vid = 0 results in vO = 50 V,
which is impossible; thus the op amp saturates
and vO = +10 V. This situation pertains for
vId ≥−4 mV. If vId decreases below −4 mV, the
op-amp output decreases correspondingly. For
instance, vId = −4.5 mV results in vO = +5 V;
vId = −5 mV results in vO = 0 V; vId = −5.5
mV results in vO = −5 V; and vId = −6 mV
results in vO = −10 V, at which point the op amp
saturates at the negative level of −10 V. Further
decreases in vId have no effect on the output
voltage. The result is the transfer characteristic
sketched in Fig. E2.21. Observe that the linear
range of the characteristic is now centered around
vId = −5 mV rather than the ideal situation of
vId = 0; this shift is obviously a result of the
input offset voltage VOS.

Exercise 2–7
Ex: 2.22 (a) The inverting amplifier of
−1000 V/V gain will exhibit an output dc offset
voltage of ±VOS(1 + R2/R1) =
±3 mV × (1 + 1000) = ±3.03 V. Now, since the
op-amp saturation levels are ±10 V, the room left
for output signal swing is approximately ±7 V.
Thus to avoid op-amp saturation and the attendant
clipping of the peak of the output sinusoid, we
must limit the peak amplitude of the input sine
wave to approximately 7 V/1000 = 7 mV.
(b) If at room temperature (25◦C), VOS is trimmed
to zero and (i) the circuit is operated at a constant
temperature, the peak of the input sine wave can
be increased to 10 mV. (ii) However, if the circuit
is to operate in the temperature range of 0◦C to
75◦C (i.e., at a temperature that deviates from
room temperature by a maximum of 50◦C), the
input offset voltage will drift from by a maximum
of 10 µV/◦C × 50◦C = 500 µV or 0.5 mV. This
will reduce the allowed peak amplitude of the
input sinusoid to 9.5 mV.
Ex: 2.23
(a) If the amplifier is capacitively coupled in the
manner of Fig. 2.32(a), then the input offset
voltage VOS will see a unity-gain amplifier [Fig.
2.32(b)] and the dc offset voltage at the output
will be equal to VOS, that is, 3 mV. Thus, almost
the entire output range of ±10 V will be available
for signal swing, allowing a sine-wave input of
approximately 10-mV peak without the risk of
output clipping. Obviously, in this case there is
no need for output trimming.
(b) We need to select a value of the coupling
capacitor C that will place the 3-dB frequency of
the resulting high-pass STC circuit at 1000 Hz,
thus
1000 =

2πCR1
⇒C =

2π × 1000 × 1 × 103 = 0.16 µF
Ex: 2.24 From Eq. (2.35) we have:
VO = IB1R2 ≃IBR2
= 100 nA × 1 M = 0.1 V
From Eq. (2.37) the value of resistor R3 (placed in
series with positive input to minimize the output
offset voltage) is
R3 = R1 ∥R2 =
R1R2
R1 + R2
= 10 k × 1 M
10 k + 1 M
= 9.9 k
R3 = 9.9 k ≃10 k
With this value of R3, the new value of the output
dc voltage [using Eq. (2.38)] is:
VO = IOSR2 = 10 nA × 10 k = 0.01 V

Exercise 2–8
At fb, the open-loop gain drops by 3 dB below its
value at dc; thus it becomes 103 dB.
For f ≫fb, | A| ≃ft/f; thus
At f = 300 Hz, | A| = 3 MHz
300 Hz = 104 V/V
or 80 dB
At f = 3 kHz, | A| = 3 MHz
3 kHz = 103 V/V
or 60 dB
At f = 12 kHz, which is two octaves higher than
3 kHz, the gain will be 2 × 6 = 12 dB below its
value at 3 kHz; that is, 60 −12 = 48 dB.
At f = 60 kHz, | A| = 3 MHz
60 kHz = 50 V/V
or 34 dB
Ex: 2.27
A0 = 106 V/V or 120 dB
The gain falls off at the rate of 20 dB/decade.
Thus, it reaches 40 dB at a frequency four
decades higher than fb,
104fb = 100 kHz ⇒fb = 10 Hz
The unity-gain frequency ft will be two decades
higher than 100 kHz, that is,
ft = 100 × 100 kHz = 10 MHz
Alternatively, we could have found ft from the
gain-bandwidth product
ft = A0 fb = 106 × 10 Hz = 10 MHz
At a frequency f ≫fb,
| A| = ft/f
For f = 10 kHz, | A| = 10 MHz
10 kHz = 103 V/V or 60 dB
Ex: 2.28
20 log A0 = 106 dB ⇒A0 = 200,000 V/V
ft = 20 MHz
For a noninverting amplifier with a nominal dc
gain of 100,

ωtV ≤SR
that is, V ≤SR
ωt
⇒V ≤SR

resulting in

From Appendix F we know that the 10% to 90%

ωt
.
Thus, tr ≃0.35 µs
If an input step of amplitude 1.6 V (10 times as
large compared to the previous case) is applied,
the output will be slew-rate limited and thus
linearly rising with a slope equal to the slew rate,

Variation of the −15-V supply by ±1% results in
a ±1% variation in the output voltage. Thus the
total variation in the output voltage can be ±3%,
resulting in VO in the range 4.85 V to 5.15 V.

For iL

(b) Rin = 0  (because of the virtual ground at

of the value of RL).
(c) If iI is in the direction shown in the figure
above, the maximum allowable value of iI will be
determined by vO reaching −12 V, at which point
vx = −iImax × 10
and
vO = −12 = vx −iLmax ×1 = −10 iImax −11 iImax
⇒iImax = 12
21 = 0.57 mA
If iI is in a direction opposite to that shown in the
figure, then
vx = 10iI
vO = vx + iLRL = 10iI + 11iI = 21iI
The maximum value of iI will result in
vO = +12 V. Thus
12 = 21iImax ⇒iImax = 12
21 = 0.57 mA
Thus, the allowable range of iI is
−0.57 mA ≤iI ≤+0.57 mA

2.27 The inverting amplifier has a gain of
−10 V/V resulting in an output voltage of +10 V.
Thus, there is 2 mA current in RL. With
R2 = 10 k, as shown in Fig. P2.17, there is
1 mA current in R2 for a total of 3 mA coming
from the ideal op-amp output. If the output
current must be limited to 2.5 mA with the same
gain, the output voltage must remain +10 V and
the current in R2 must be limited to 2.5 −2 =
0.5 mA. This requires,
R2 = 10
0.5 = 20 k
To keep the same gain, −R2/R1 = −10. Hence,
R1 = R2
10 = 2 k
2.28 R1 = R1nominal(1 ± x%)
R2 = R2nominal(1 ± x%)
|G| = R2
R1
= R2nominal

1 ± x%
Thus,
|G|max ≃R2nominal
R1nominal
× (1 + 2x%)
|G|min ≃R2nominal
R1nominal
× (1 −2x%)
Thus, the tolerance of the closed-loop gain is
±2x%.
For Gnominal = −100 and x = 1, the closed-loop
gain will be in the range −98 V/V to −102 V/V.

2.30 Output voltage ranges from –10 V to +10 V

∴Voltage at the inverting input terminal will
vary from −10
5000 to
10
5000 (i.e., –2 mV to +2 mV).
Thus the virtual ground will depart by a
maximum of ±2 mV.

equal currents ⇒I1 = I. A node equation at node
1 results in the current through (R/2) as 2I. At
node 2, we have a resistance R to ground and an
equal resistance looking to the left. These two
resistances must carry equal currents ⇒I2 = 2I.

Choosing R2 = 500  ⇒R1 = 15 k. The
circuit will work properly as long as the op amp
does not saturate (i.e., as long as VO ≤−10 V).
But
VO = Vx −ILRL
= −IR1 −ILRL
= −0.1 × 15 −3.1RL
The maximum allowed value for RL can now be
found by substituting VO = −10 V, thus
RL = 2.74 k

To obtain an input resistance of 100 k, we
select R1 = 100 k. From Example 2.2 we have

2.60 An ideal op amp has infinite gain and, thus
zero differential input. The op-amp inputs are tied
directly to the sinusoidal signal. Thus, the
common-mode input is VICM = sin(ωt).
In an inverting configuration, the ideal op amp
again ensures zero differential input. Since the
positive op-amp input terminal is grounded, the
common-mode input is zero.
Voltage followers must tolerate a common-mode
input whereas the inverting configuration does
not.

We solve this problem by replacing the network

equivalent. The resistance seen looking into the
network is dominated by the 100 resistor to
ground, which is much smaller than the other
resistances in parallel with it. Thus,

Thus, the first stage produces a differential output

The gain of the first stage is


= 101. If
the op amps of the first stage saturate at ±12 V
then −12 V ≤101vIcm ≤+12 V
⇒−0.12 V ≤vIcm ≤0.12 V
As explained in the text, the disadvantage of
circuit in Fig. 2.20(a) is that vIcm is amplified by a
gain equal to

1 + R2
R1

in the first stage and
therefore a very small vIcm range is acceptable to
avoid saturation.
(b) In Fig. 2.20(b), when vIcm is applied, v−for
both A1 and A2 is the same and therefore no
current flows through 2R1. This means the
voltage at the output of A1 and A2 is the same as
vIcm.
⇒−12 V ≤vIcm ≤12 V
This circuit allows for a much larger range of
vIcm.

Acm = 0
CMRR = ∞
If all resistors have ±1% tolerance, the
differential gain will be slightly affected; Eq. (1)
indicates that in the worst case Ad can deviate by
approximately ±4% of the nominal value. The
common-mode gain, however, undergoes
dramatic change because of the significant effect
of resistor tolerances on the operation of the
difference amplifier in the second stage. Equation
(2.19) can be employed to evaluate the worst-case
common-mode gain. For our case,
Acm2 = 0.5[1 −(1 ± 0.04] = ± 0.02
The common-mode gain of the first stage will
remain approximately unity. Thus the ±1%
resistor tolerances will mainly affect the
common-mode gain of the instrumentation
amplifier, increasing it in the worst case to
|Acm| = 0.02
Correspondingly, the CMRR will be reduced to
CMRR = 20 log | Ad |
| Acm |
≃20 log
 21
0.02

= 60.4 dB
as opposed to the ideal infinite value!
If 2R1 is reduced to 1 k, Ad increases to
201 V/V while Acm remains unchanged at
0.02 V/V. Thus, CMRR increases to about 80 dB.
We conclude that increasing the gain of the first
stage increases CMRR.

Note that circuit (a) has the advantage of infinite
input resistance. However, it has the limitation
that the load impedance must be floating. This
constraint is removed in circuit (b), but the input

where t is in µs. At the end of the pulse,
t = 10 µs,
vO(10 µs) = −100(1 −e−10/159) = −6.1 V
Beyond t = 10 µs, the capacitor discharges
through RF. Thus, including RF results in the
nonideal integrator response shown in Fig. 3.

which is low-pass STC function. The pole (or
3-dB) frequency is
ωP =
1
(A0 + 1)CR
The ideal integrator has ωP = 0. Observe that as
A0 →∞, ωP →0. The dc gain is −A0, which is
the dc gain of the op amp.
If an ideal Miller integrator is fed with a −1-V
pulse signal of width T = CR, the output voltage
can be found as follows: The −1-V pulse will
cause a current I = 1 V/R to be drawn through R
and C. The capacitor voltage, which is vO, will
rise linearly according to
vO = 1
C It = 1
CRt
Thus, at t = T (the end of the pulse) the output
voltage reaches 1 V and then stays constant at this
value.
If the integrator is made with an op amp having a
finite A0 = 1000, the response to the −1-V step
will be that of an STC low-pass circuit. Thus,
vO = vOfinal −(vOfinal −vOinitial)e−t/τ
where
vOfinal = −1 V × dc gain
= −1 V × −1000
= 1000 V
vOinitial = 0 V
τ = 1
ωP
= (A0 + 1)CR = 1001CR
Thus,
vO = 1000(1 −e−t/1000CR)
At t = T, which is equal to CR,
vO(T) = 1000(1 −e−0.001)

IB1 = 1.9 µA and IB2 = 2.1 µA,
VOmin = 1.9 × 100 −2.1 × 5 × 10
= 190 −105 = 85 mV
Thus the dc offset at the output will be in the
range of 85 mV to 115 mV. The bulk of the dc
offset at the output, that due to IB, can be reduced
to zero by making the dc resistances seen by the
two input terminals equal. Currently, the positive
input terminal sees a resistance R3 = 5 k and
the negative input terminal sees a resistance equal
to R1 ∥R2 = 100
9 ∥100 = 10 k. Thus the two
resistances can be made equal by connecting a
5-k resistance in series with R3. The resulting
dc offset voltage at the output will be
VO = IOSR2 = 0.2 × 100 = 20 mV
Since IOS can be of either polarity,
VO = ±20 mV
The same result could have been found by
replacing R3 in Eq. (1) by (R3 + R4) where
R4 = 5 k.
If the signal source resistance is 15 k, then the
resistances can be equalized by adding a 5-k
resistor in series with the negative input lead of
the op amp.

Since the two op-amp input terminals see equal

2.107 At very low frequencies, the gain is A0,
thus
20 log A0 = 98 dB ⇒A0 ≃80,000 V/V
At f = 100 kHz, the gain is 40 dB or 100 V/V.
Thus
ft = 100 kHz × 100 = 10 MHz
Since ft = A0fb ⇒fb = 10 MHz
80,000 = 125 Hz.
2.108 f = 10 kHz |A| = 20 × 103
f = 100 kHz |A| = 4 × 103
Thus, a change of a decade in f does not result in
a factor of 10 reduction in gain; in fact, the gain
reduces by only a factor of 5. It follows that the
first frequency (10 kHz) is less than fb. Therefore,
we must use the exact expression for |A|, that is,

Vp = 0.1 V
When the output is at its peak,

1 k = 10 mA
i =

100 k = −0.1 mA; therefore
iO = 10 + 0.1 = 10.1 mA is just over
iOmax = 10 mA.
Therefore, the input amplitude must be reduced
slightly to ensure an undistorted output. With
Vp = 99 mV, the output peak is
vO = 9.9 V < vOmax and the output current is
iO = 9.9 + 9.9
100 = 10 mA = iOmax
At the negative peak of the output voltage,
vO = 9.9 V, iL = −9.9 mA, i = 0.099 mA, and
iO = −10 mA = iOmax, the maximum allowed.

2π × 2.54 × 105Vomax = 106
⇒Vomax =

2π × 2.54 × 105 = 0.627 V
(c) At the peak of the output sinusoid, the
feedback resistor (having a value of
5 × 20 = 100 k) will draw only
0.627/100 = 0.006 mA. This is negligible
compared to the op-amp output current limit of
±1 mA. Thus, we focus on the current required to
charge and discharge the load capacitance at the
output zero-crossings, where the op amp is on the
verge of slew rate limiting at 1 V/ s. The
required current is,
C × dvO
dt = C × 106
Equating this with the op-amp output current
limit gives the largest capacitive load that can be
driven in this way,

Solutions to Exercises within the Chapter
Ex: 3.1 Refer to Fig. 3.3(a). For vI ≥0, the
diode conducts and presents a zero voltage drop.
Thus vO = vI. For vI < 0, the diode is cut off,
zero current flows through R, and vO = 0. The
result is the transfer characteristic in Fig. E3.1.
Ex: 3.2 See Fig. 3.3(a) and 3.3(b) During the
positive half of the sinusoid, the diode is forward
biased, so it conducts resulting in vD = 0. During
the negative half cycle of the input signal vI, the
diode is reverse biased. The diode does not
conduct, resulting in no current flowing in the
circuit. So vO = 0 and vD = vI −vO = vI. This
results in the waveform shown in Fig. E3.2.

Ex: 3.15 With a reverse voltage, the diode in Fig.
3.10 will not conduct. Thus, the voltage drop on R
will be zero, and the reverse voltage on the diode
is −VD = −VDD. To ensure we respect the peak
inverse voltage, we require VDD = VD > −30 V.
Hence, the minimum voltage on VDD is −30 V.

From Fig. P4.5 we see that when vI < VB; that is,
vI < 3 V, D1 will be conducting the current I and
iB will be zero. When vI exceeds the battery
voltage (3 V), D1 cuts off and D2 conducts, thus
steering I into the battery. Thus, iB will have the
waveform shown in the figure. Its peak value will
be 60 mA. To obtain the average value, we first
determine the conduction angle of D2, (π −2θ),
where
θ = sin−1
3
6

= 30◦
Thus
π −2θ = 180◦−60 = 120◦
The average value of iB will be
iB|av = 60 × 120◦
360◦
= 20 mA
If the peak value of vI is reduced by 10%, i.e.
from 6 V to 5.4 V, the peak value of iB does not
change. The conduction angle of D2, however,
changes since θ now becomes
θ = sin−1

10−3 = ISe0.7/VT
(1)
For VD = 0.71 V,
I = ISe0.71/VT
(2)
Combining (1) and (2) gives
I = 10−3e(0.71 −0.7)/0.025
= 1.49 mA
For VD = 0.8 V,
I = ISe0.8/VT
(3)
Combining (1) and (3) gives
I = 10−3 × e(0.8 −0.7)/0.025
= 54.6 mA
Similarly, for VD = 0.69 V we obtain
I = 10−3 × e(0.69 −0.7)/0.025
= 0.67 mA
and for VD = 0.6 V we have
I = 10−3e(0.6 −0.7)/0.025
= 18.3 µA
To increase the current by a factor of 10, VD must
be increased by △VD,
10 = e△VD/0.025
⇒△VD = 0.025 ln10 = 57.6 mV
3.19 IS can be found by using IS = ID · e−VD/VT .
Let a decrease by a factor of 10 in ID result in a
decrease of VD by V:
ID = ISeVD/VT
ID
10 = ISe(VD−V)/VT = ISeVD/VT · e−V/VT
Taking the ratio of the above two equations, we
have
10 = eV/VT ⇒V ≃60 mV
Thus the result in each case is a decrease in the
diode voltage by 60 mV.
(a) VD = 0.700 V, ID = 1 A
⇒IS = 6.91 × 10−13 A;
10% of ID gives VD = 0.64 V
(b) VD = 0.650 V, ID = 1 mA

3.21 We can write a node equation at the anodes:
ID2 = I1 −I2 = 5 mA
ID1 = I2 = 3 mA
We can write the following equation for the diode
voltages:
V = VD2 −VD1
If D2 has saturation current IS, then D1, which is
20 times larger, has saturation current 20IS. Thus
we can write
ID2 = ISeVD2/VT
ID1 = 20ISeVD1/VT
Taking the ratio of the two equations above, we

Solving the above equation with I1 still at 8 mA,

Assuming VD changes by –2 mV per 1◦C increase

For ID = 1 mA, 530 mV ≤VD ≤610 mV
For ID = 3 mA, 558 mV ≤VD ≤638 mV
Thus the overall range of VD is between 530 mV

increase of VD by V:
ID = IS eVD/VT
10ID = IS e(VD+V)/VT = IS eVD/VT · eV/VT
Taking the ratio of the above two equations, we
have

Thus the result is an increase in the diode voltage
by 60 mV.
Similarly, at ID/10, VD is reduced by 60 mV.
(a) VD = 0.70 V, ID = 10 mA
⇒IS = 6.91 × 10−15 A;
ID × 10 gives VD = 0.76 V
ID/10 gives VD = 0.64 V
(b) VD = 0.70 V, ID = 1 mA
⇒IS = 6.91 × 10−16 A;

ID/10 gives VD = 0.64 V
(c) VD = 0.80 V, ID = 10 A
⇒IS = 1.27 × 10−13 A;
ID × 10 gives VD = 0.86 V
ID/10 gives VD = 0.74 V
(d) VD = 0.70 V, ID = 1 mA

ID × 10 gives VD = 0.76 V
ID/10 gives VD = 0.64 V
(e) VD = 0.6 V, ID = 10 µA
⇒IS = 3.78 × 10−16 A
ID × 10 gives VD = 0.66 V
ID/10 gives VD = 0.54 V
3.27 The voltage across three diodes in series is
2.0 V; thus the voltage across each diode must be
0.667 V. Using ID = ISeVD/VT , the required
current I is found to be 3.9 mA.
If 1 mA is drawn away from the circuit, ID will be
2.9 mA, which would give VD = 0.794 V, giving
an output voltage of 1.98 V. The change in output
voltage is −22 mV.
3.28 Connecting an identical diode in parallel
would reduce the current in each diode by a factor
of 2. Writing expressions for the currents, we
have
ID = ISeVD/VT
ID
2 = ISe(VD−V)/VT = ISeVD/VT · e−V/VT
Taking the ratio of the above two equations, we
have
2 = eV/VT ⇒V = 17.3 mV
Thus the result is a decrease in the diode voltage
by 17.3 mV.
3.29 We can write the following node equation at
the diode anodes:
ID2 = 10 mA −V/R
ID1 = V/R
We can write the following equation for the diode
voltages:
V = VD2 −VD1
We can write the following diode equations:
ID2 = ISeVD2/VT
ID1 = ISeVD1/VT

3.30 For a diode conducting a constant current,
the diode voltage decreases by approximately 2
mV per increase of 1◦C.
T = −20◦C corresponds to a temperature
decrease of 40◦C, which results in an increase of
the diode voltage by 80 mV. Thus VD = 770 mV.
T = + 85◦C corresponds to a temperature
increase of 65◦C, which results in a decrease of

(a) Assuming a current flow from the positive to
the negative supply voltages, D2 will be
conducting. A voltage division between the two
resistors would place forward bias on D1, so let’s
assume D1 is also conducting, placing +0.7 V at
its anode. Thus, as shown in Fig. (a),
V = 0 V
ID2 = 0 −(−3)

I + ID2 = 3 −0.7

⇒I = 2.3 −1 = 1.3 mA
These results are consistent with our assumptions.
(b) Again assuming D2 is on, a voltage division
between the two resistors will negatively bias D1.
Hence, we assume D1 is off.
I = 0
ID2 = 3 −0.7 −(−3)
3 + 1

V = −3 + 1.325 × 1 = −1.675 V
Thus, the anode of D1 is at −1.675 + 0.7 =
−0.975 V which confirms that it is reverse-
biased.

3.43 Available diodes have 0.7 V drop at 2 mA

∴DC biasing current I = 0.5 × 10 = 5 µA
(c) Now I = 1 mA.

From the results of (a) above, for I = 1 mA,
vo/vi = 0.995; thus the maximum input signal
will be
ˆvi = ˆvo/0.995 = 1/0.995
= 1.005 V
The same result can be obtained from the figure
above where the signal across the two series
diodes is 5 mV, thus
ˆvi = ˆvo + 5 mV = 1 V + 5 mV = 1.005 V.

0.1 A
Ten diode connected in parallel and fed with a

diode = 0.1
10 = 0.01 A
Small signal resistance of each diode

iD
= 25 mV
0.01 A = 2.5 
Equivalent resistance, Req, of 10 diodes
connected in parallel is given by
Req = 2.5
10 = 0.25 
If there is one diode conducting 0.1 A current,
then the small signal resistance of this diode
= 25 mV
0.1 A = 0.25 
This value is the same as of 10 diodes connected
in parallel.
If 0.2  is the resistance for making connection,
the resistance in each branch
= rd + 0.2 = 2.5 + 0.2 = 2.7 
For a parallel combination of 10 diodes,
equivalent resistance, Req, is
Req = 2.7
10 = 0.27 
If there is a single diode conducting all the 0.1 A
current, the connection resistance needed for the
single diode will be = 0.27 −0.25 = 0.02 .

A similar table can be generated for the negative

For vI > +10.7, vO will be saturated at +10 V

To supply a load current of 2 to 7 mA, the current
I must be greater than 7 mA. So I can be only
10 mA or 15 mA.
Now let us evaluate VO for both 10-mA and
15-mA sources. For the 10-mA source:
Since IL varies from 2 to 7 mA, the current ID will
varry from 8 to 3 mA.
Correspondingly, the voltage across each diode
changes by △VD where
3
8 = e△VD/VT
⇒△VD = 25 ln
3
8

= −24.5 mV
and the output voltage changes by
△VO = 2 × △VD = −49 mV
With I = 15 mA, the diodes current changes from
13 to 8 mA. Correspondingly, the voltage across
each diode changes by △VD where
8
13 = e△VD/VT
⇒△VD = 25 ln
 8
13

= −12.1 mV
and the output voltage changes by
△VO = 2 × △VD = −24.2 mV
which is less than half that obtained with the
10-mA supply. Thus, from the point of view of
reducing the change in VO as IL changes, we
choose the 15-mA supply. Note, however, that
the price paid is increased power dissipation.
3.62 (a) Three 6.8-V zeners provide 3 × 6.8 =
20.4 V with 3 ×10 = 30- resistance. Neglecting
R, we have
Load regulation = −30 mV/mA.
(b) For 5.1-V zeners we use 4 diodes to provide
20.4 V with 4 ×30 = 120- resistance.
Load regulation = −120 mV/mA

10 = VZ0 + 7 (0.025)
⇒VZ0 = 9.825 V
(b) The minimum zener current of 5 mA occurs
when IL = 20 mA and VS is at its minimum of
20(1 −0.25) = 15 V. See the circuit below.
R ≤15 −VZ0
20 + 5
where we have used the minimum value of VS,
the maximum value of load current, and the
minimum required value of zener diode current,
and we assumed that at this current VZ ≃VZ0.

3.74 Refer to Fig. P3.74. When vI is positive, vA
goes positive, turning on the diode and closing
the negative feedback loop around the op amp.
The result is that v−= vI, vO = 2v−= 2vI, and
vA = vO + 0.7. Thus
(a) vI = +1 V, v−= +1 V, vO = +2 V, and
vA = +2.7 V.
(b) vI = +3 V, v−= +3 V, vO = +6 V, and
vA = +6.7 V.
When vI goes negative, vA follows, the diode
turns off, and the feedback loop is opened. The op
amp saturates with vA = −13 V, v−= 0 V and
vO = 0 V. Thus

(d) vI = −3 V, v−= 0 V, vO = 0 V, and

Finally, if vI is a symmetrical square wave of
1-kHz frequency, 5-V amplitude, and zero
average, the output will be zero during the
negative half cycles of the input and will equal
twice the input during the positive half cycles.
See figure above.
Thus, vO is a square wave with 0-V and +10-V
levels, i.e. 5-V average and, of course, the same

During the diode’s off interval (which is almost
equal to T) the capacitor discharges and its
voltage is given by
vO(t) = 11.3 e−t/CR
where C = 100 µF and R = 100 , thus
CR = 100 × 10−6 × 100 = 0.01 s
At the end of the discharge interval, t ≃T and
vO = 11.3 e−T/CR
Since T = 0.001 s is much smaller than CR,
vO ≃11.3

Now, using the fact that the charge gained by the
capacitor when the diode is conducting is equal to
the charge lost by the capacitor during its
discharge interval, we can write
iCav × △t = C Vr
⇒iCav = C Vr
△t
= 100 × 10−6 × 1.13

iDav = iCav + iLav
where iLav is the average current through R during
the short interval △t. This is approximately

Chapter 3–32
iDav = 4.8 + 0.113 = 4.913 A

which is equal to the average value. This is a
result of the linear vI which gives rise to a
constant capacitor current during the diode
conduction interval. Thus iCmax = iCav = 4.8 A.
Also, the maximum value of iL is approximately
equal to its average value during the short
interval △t.
3.83 Refer to Fig. P3.78 and let a capacitor C be
connected across each of the load resistors R. The
two supplies v+
O and v−
O are identical. Each is a
full-wave rectifier similar to that of the
tapped-transformer circuit. For each supply,
VO = 12 V
Vr = 1 V (peak to peak)
Thus
vO = 12 ± 0.5 V
It follows that the peak value of vS must be
12.5 + 0.7 = 13.2 V and the total rms voltage
across the secondary will be
= 2 × 13.2
√
2
= 18.7 V (rms)
Transformer turns ratio = 120
18.7 = 6.43:1
To deliver 100-mA dc current to each load,
R = 12

Now, the value of C can be found from
Vr = Vp −0.7

To determine the required PIV rating of each
diode, we determine the maximum reverse
voltage that appears across one of the diodes, say
D1. This occurs when vS is at its maximum
negative value −Vp. Since the cathode of D1 will
be at +12.5 V, the maximum reverse voltage
across D1 will be 12.5 + 13.2 = 25.7 V. Using a
factor of safety of 1.5, then each of the four
diodes must have

3.85 The input is an AM signal with carrier
frequency ω0 = 2π × 106 rad/s and time-varying
amplitude Vp(t) = 1.5 + sin(2π × 103t) Volts.
With CR = 0.1 ms, the output time constant is
much longer than the period of the carrier,
1/106 = 1s. Thus, the output drops very little
between successive peaks of the carrier.
However, the time constant is much smaller than
the period of Vp(t) so that vO will follow changes
in Vp(t). A sketch appears in Fig. 1.

△VE = −60 mV
Since the collector current remains unchanged at
αIE, the collector voltage does not change:
△VC = 0 V

Assuming operation in the active mode,

Thus,

which is greater than VB, verifying that the
transistor is operating in the active mode, as
assumed.

Exercise 4–6
Ex: 4.27 Refer to the circuit in Fig. 4.27:
IB = 5 −0.7
100
= 0.043 mA
To ensure that the transistor remains in the active
mode for β in the range 50 to 150, we need to
select RC so that for the highest collector current
possible, the BJT reaches the edge of saturation,
that is, VCE = 0.3 V. Thus,
VCE = 0.3 = 10 −RCICmax
where
ICmax = βmaxIB
= 150 × 0.043 = 6.45 mA
Thus,
RC = 10 −0.3
6.45
= 1.5 k
For the lowest β,
IC = βminIB
= 50 × 0.043 = 2.15 mA
and the corresponding VCE is
VCE = 10 −RCIC = 10 −(1.5 × 2.15)
= 6.775 V
Thus, VCE will range from 0.3 V to 6.8 V.
Ex: 4.28 Refer to the solution of Example 4.10.
IE =

RE + [RBB/(β + 1)]

3 + (33.3/51) = 1.177 mA
IC = αIE = 0.98 × 1.177 = 1.15 mA
Thus the current is reduced by
△IC = 1.28 −1.15 = 0.13 mA
which is a −10% change.
Ex: 4.29 Refer to the circuit in Fig. 4.30(b). The
total current drawn from the power supply is
I = 0.103 + 1.252 + 2.78 = 4.135 mA

Exercise 4–7
From the figure we see that Q1 will be off and Q2
will be on. Since the base of Q2 will be at a
voltage higher than −5 V, transistor Q2 will be
operating in the active mode. We can write a loop
equation for the loop containing the 10-k
resistor, the EBJ of Q2 and the 1-k resistor:
−IE × 1 −0.7 −IB × 10 = −5
Substituting IB = IE/(β + 1) = IE/101 and
rearranging gives
IE = 5 −0.7

To obtain vCE that results in iC = 0, we first use
Eq. (5),

4.23 Dividing Eq. (4.14) by Eq. (4.15) and
substituting iC/iB = βforced gives
βforced =

Assuming operation in the active mode,

V2 = −10.7 + IC × 5

Since V2 is lower than VB, which is 0 V, the
transistor is operating in the active mode, as
assumed.

Since VC < VB, the transistor is indeed operating

(d) Refer to Fig. P4.28(d). Since the collector is
connected to the base with a 10-k resistor and β
is assumed to be very high, the voltage drop
across the 10-k resistor will be close to zero and
the base voltage will be equal to that of the
collector:
VB = V7
This also implies active-mode operation. Now,
VE = VB −0.7

4.32 Since the BJT is operating at a constant

every ◦C rise in temperature. Thus,
|VBE| at 0◦C = 0.7 + 0.002 × 25 = 0.75 V

iC will be 1.2 mA at,

The intercept of the iC–vCE straight line on the iC

Thus,

4.41 ICBO approximately doubles for every 10◦C
rise in temperature. A change in temperature from
25◦C to 125◦C—that is, an increase of
100◦C—results in 10 doublings or, equivalently,
an increase by a factor of 210 = 1024. Thus ICBO

Thus,
At 20◦C, T = 293 K and VT =

At 50◦C, T = 323 K and VT =

If the transistor is operated at vBE = 700 mV,
then (i) At 20◦C, iE becomes
iE = 0.5e(700−692)/25.3 = 0.69 mA
(ii) At 50◦C, iE becomes

For vBE = 0.5 V,
iC = 10e(0.5−0.7)/0.025 = 3.35 µA
At a current IC and a BE voltage VBE, the slope of
the iC–vBE curve is IC/VT. Thus,
Slope at VBE of 700 mV = 10 mA

As temperature increases, an approximate
estimate for the temperature coefficient of VE can
be obtained by assuming that IE remains constant
and ignoring the temperature variation of β.
Thus, we would be neglecting the temperature
change of the (IBR2) terms in Eq. (2). From
Eq. (2) we can obtain the temperature coefficient
of VE by utilizing the fact the VBE changes by
– 2 mV/◦C. Thus,

At 75◦C, which is a temperature increase of 50◦C,
VE = −8.16 + 0.022 × 50 = −7.06 V
As a check on our assumption of constant IE, let
us find the value of IE at 75◦C:
I1(75◦C) = VBE(75◦C)
R1
= 0.68 −2 × 10−3 × 50

IE(75◦C) = I −I1(75◦C)

which is reasonably close to the assumed value of
1 mA.

For VCC = 5 V and βforced = 10 and

⇒IB ≤0.36 mA
Thus,
VCC −0.7
RB

⇒RB ≥11.9 k
From the table of 1% resistors in Appendix J we
select
RB = 12.1 k
Substituting in Eq. (3), we have
RC = 1.35 k
From the table of 1% resistors in Appendix J we
select
RC = 1.37 k
For these values:
IC = 5 −0.2

IB = 5 −0.7

Thus,

(a) For RB = 100 k,

101
= 1.16 mA
VE = IERE = 1.16 × 1 = 1.16 V
VB = VE + 0.7 = 1.86 V
Assuming active-mode operation, we obtain
IC = αIE = 0.99 × 1.16 = 1.15 mA
VC = 3 −1.15 × 1 = +1.85 V
Since VC > VB −0.4, the transistor is operating
in the active region, as assumed.
(b) For RB = 10 k,
IE =
2.3
1 + 10
101
= 2.09 mA
VE = 2.09 × 1 = 2.09 V
VB = 2.09 + 0.7 = 2.79 V
Assuming active-mode operation, we obtain
IC = αIE = 0.99 × 2.09 = 2.07 mA
VC = 3 −2.07 = +0.93 V
Since VC < VB −0.4, the transistor is operating
in saturation, contrary to our original assumption.
Therefore, we need to redo the analysis assuming
saturation-mode operation, as follows:
VB = VE + 0.7
VC = VE + VCEsat = VE + 0.2
IB = 3 −VB
RB
= 3 −VE −0.7
10

10
(1)
IC = 3 −VC
RC
= 3 −VE −0.2
1
= 2.8 −VE
(2)
IE = VE
RE
= VE
1 = VE
(3)
Substituting from Eqs. (1), (2), and (3) into
IE = IB + IC
gives
VE = 0.23 −0.1 VE + 2.8 −VE
⇒VE = 1.44 V
VC = 1.64 V
VB = 2.14 V
IB = 3 −2.14
10
= 0.086 mA
IC = 3 −1.64
1
= 1.36 mA
Thus,
IC
IB
= 1.36
0.086 = 15.8
which is lower than the value of β, verifying
saturation-mode operation.
(c) For RB = 1 k, we assume saturation-mode
operation:
VB = VE + 0.7
VC = VE + 0.2
IB = 3 −(VE + 0.7)
1
= 2.3 −VE
IC = 3 −(VE + 0.2)
1
= 2.8 −VE
IE = VE
1 = VE
These values can be substituted into
IE = IB + IC
to obtain
VE = 2.3 −VE + 2.8 −VE
⇒VE = 1.7 V
VB = 2.4 V
VC = 1.9 V
Now checking the currents,
IB = 3 −2.4
1
= 0.6 mA
IC = 3 −1.9
1
= 1.1 mA
Thus, the transistor is operating at a forced β of
βforced = IC
IB
= 1.1
0.6 = 1.83
which is much lower than the value of β,
confirming operation in saturation.

Writing an equation for the loop containing the
BEJ of the transistor leads to
IE =
3 −0.7
4.7 + 43
101
= 0.449 mA
V5 = −3 + 0.449 × 4.7 = −0.9 V
V6 = −0.9 + 0.7 = −0.2 V
IC = αIE = 0.99 × 0.449 = 0.444 mA
V7 = 3 −0.444 × 3.6 = +1.4 V
(d)
An equation for the loop containing the EBJ of
the transistor yields
IE = 3 −0.75 −0.7
6.2 + 110
101
= 0.213 mA
V8 = +3 −0.213 × 6.2 = +1.7 V
VB = 1 V
IC = αIE = 0.99 × 0.213 = 0.21 mA
V9 = −3 + 0.21 × 10 = −0.9 V
(e) See figure on the previous page. First, we use
Thévenin’s theorem to replace the voltage divider
feeding the base with VBB and RB:
VBB = −3 +
6
480 × 300 = +0.75 V
RB = 180 ∥300 = 112.5 k
Next we write an equation for the loop containing
the EBJ to obtain
IE = 3 −0.75 −0.7
6.2 + 112.5
101
= 0.212 mA
V11 = +3 −0.212 × 6.2 = +1.7 V
V10 = 1.7 −0.7 = +1 V
IC = αIE = 0.99 × 0.212 = 0.21 mA
V12 = −3 + 0.21 × 10 = −0.9 V
Note that these results are nearly identical to
those for case (d) above.
4.56 Refer to Fig. P4.56. To obtain IE = 0.2 mA
and VE = 2 V we select
RE =
2 V
0.2 mA = 10 k
Now, the base voltage has to be
VB = VE + 0.7 = 2.7 V
For IB2 = 0.1 mA, the value of RB2 must be
RB2 = VB
IB2
= 2.7 V
0.1 mA = 27 k
The base current IB is
IB =
IE
β + 1 =
0.2
100 + 1 = 0.002 mA
and the current IB1 through RB1 is
IB1 = IB2+IB = 0.1+0.002 = 0.102 mA
The required value of RB1 can now be found as
RB1 = 9 −2.7
0.102 = 61.8 k
The collector current IC is
IC = αIE = (
β
β + 1) IE = 0.99×0.2 = 0.198 mA
To obtain VC = +5 V, we select RC as
RC = 9 −5
0.198 = 20.2 k
Consulting the table of 5% resistors, in Appendix
J, we find the nearest resistance values to be:
RE = 10 k, RB1 = 62 k,
RB2 = 27 k, and RC = 20 k
We can use these values to determine
IE =
9 × (
27
27 + 62) −0.7
10 + 27∥62
101
≃0.2 mA
VE = 0.2 × 10 = 2 V
VB = 2.7 V
IB2 = 2.7 V
27 k = 0.1 mA
IC = 0.198 mA
VC = 9 −0.198 × 20 = 5.04 V
Which are equal or very close to the desired
values!
4.57 Refer to the circuit in Fig. P4.57.

currents are zero. Thus

(b) For vI = −2 V, Q1 will be off and Q2 will be
on, and the circuit reduces to that in Fig. 1. Since
VB > −2 V, VC will be lower than VB, and Q2
will be operating in the active region. Thus
IE = 2 −0.7

VE = VB −VBE = −1 −0.7 = −1.7 V
IE = VE −(−3)
1
= −1.7 + 3
1
= 1.3 mA
Assuming active-mode operation, we have
IC = αIE ≃IE = 1.3 mA
VC = +3 −IC × 1 = 3 −1.3 = +1.7 V
Since VC > VB −0.4, the transistor is operating
in the active mode as assumed.
(b) For VB = 0 V,
VE = 0 −VBE = −0.7 V
IE = −0.7 −(−3)
1
= 2.3 mA
Assuming operation in the active mode, we have
IC = αIE ≃IE = 2.3 mA
VC = +3 −IC × 1 = 3 −2.3 = +0.7 V
Since VC > VB −0.4, the BJT is operating in the
active mode, as assumed.
(c) For VB = +1 V,
VE = 1 −0.7 = +0.3 V
IE = 0.3 −(−3)
1
= 3.3 mA
Assuming operation in the active mode, we have
IC = αIE ≃IE = 3.3 mA
VC = 3 −3.3 × 1 = −0.3 V
Now VC < VB −0.4, indicating that the transistor
is operating in saturation, and our original
assumption is incorrect. It follows that
VC = VE + VCEsat

IC = 3 −VC

(d) When VB = 0 V, IE = 2.3 mA. The emitter
current becomes 0.23 mA at
VB = −3 + 0.23 × 1 + 0.7 = −2.07 V
(e) The transistor will be at the edge of
conduction when IE ≃0 and VBE = 0.5 V, that is,
VB = −3 + 0.5 = −2.5 V
In this case,
VE = −3 V
VC = +3 V
(f) The transistor reaches the edge of saturation
when VCE = 0.3 V but IC = αIE ≃IE:
VE = VB −0.7
IE = VB −0.7 −(−3)

VC = VE + 0.3 = VB −0.4

(b) The transistor cuts off at the value of VB that
causes the 2-mA current of the current source
feeding the emitter to flow through the 1-k
resistor connected between the emitter and
ground. The circuit under these conditions is
shown in Fig. 2.
Observe that VE = −2 mA ×1 k = −2 V,
IE = 0, and VB = VE + 0.5 = −1.5 V. Since
IC = 0, all the 4 mA supplied by the current
source feeding the collector flows through the

Chapter 4–24
We require IE to be nominally 1 mA (i.e., at
β = 100) and to remain within ±10% as β varies
from 50 to 150. Writing an equation for the loop
containing the EBJ results in
IE =

RE + RB

(2)
4.3
RE + RB

= IEmax
(3)
If we set IEmin = 0.9 mA and solve Eqs. (1) and
(2) simultaneously, we obtain
RE = 3.81 k
RB = 49.2 k
Substituting theses values in Eqs. (2) and (3)
gives
IEmin = 0.9 mA
IEmax = 1.04 mA
Obviously, this is an acceptable design.
Alternatively, if we set IEmax in Eq. (3) to 1.1 mA
and solve Eqs. (1) and (3) simultaneously, we
obtain
RE = 3.1 k
RB = 119.2 k
Substituting these values in Eqs. (2) and (3) gives
IEmin = 0.8 mA
IEmax = 1.1 mA
Obviously this is not an acceptable design (IEmin
is 20% lower than nominal). Therefore, we shall
use the first design. Specifying the resistor values
to the nearest kilohm results in
RE = 4 k
RB = 50 k
To obtain the value of RC, we note that at the
nominal emitter current value of 1 mA,
VC = −1 V,
IC = αIE = 0.99 mA
RC = −1 −(−5)
0.99
= 4.04 k
Specified to the nearest kilohm,
RC = 4 k
Finally, for our design we need to determine the
range obtained for collector current and collector
voltage for β ranging from 50 to 150 with a
nominal value of 100. We compute the nominal
value of IE from
IEnominal =
4.3
4 + 50
101
= 0.96 mA
We utilize Eqs. (2) and (3) to compute IEmin and
IEmax,
IEmin =
4.3
4 + 50
51
= 0.86 mA
IEmax =
4.3
4 + 50
151
= 0.99 mA
Thus,
IEmax
IEnominal
= 0.99
0.96 = 1.03
IEmin
IEnominal
= 0.86
0.96 = 0.9
which meet our specifications. The collector
currents are
ICnominal = 0.99 × 0.96 = 0.95 mA
ICmin = 0.99 × 0.86 = 0.85 mA
ICmax = 0.99 × 0.99 = 0.98 mA
and the collector voltages are
VCnominal = −5 + 0.95 × 4 = −1.2 V
VCmin = −5 + 0.85 × 4 = −1.6 V
VCmax = −5 + 0.98 × 4 = −1.1 V

Since VC = 2 V is lower than VB, which is
+2.3 V, the transistor will be operating in the
active mode. Thus,
IC = βIB = 50 × 0.023 = 1.15 mA
To obtain VC = 2 V, we select RC according to
RC = VC
IC

2 V
1.15 mA = 1.74 k
Now, if the transistor is replaced with another
having β = 100, then
IC = 100 × 0.023 = 2.3 mA
which would imply
VC = 2.3 × 1.74 = 4 V
which is impossible because the base is at 2.3 V.
Thus the transistor must be in the saturation mode
and
VC = VE −VECsat

for the loop containing the EBJ of Q1 as follows:

rearranging, we obtain

The current I1 through the 10-k resistor is
given by
I1 = IC1 −IB2 = IC1 −IE2
101
Noting that the voltage drop across the 10 k
resistor is equal to (IE2 × 8.2 + 0.7), we can write
I1 × 10 = 8.2IE2 + 0.7
Thus,

at all other nodes in terms of V, utilizing the fact
that a saturated transistor has |VCE| = 0.2 V and
of course |VBE| = 0.7 V. Note that the choice of

Thus

Since kn = k′
nW/L and W/L is dimensionless, kn
has the same dimensions as k′

Two conditions need to met for vOV and rDS
Condition 1:
rDS,1 =
1
400 × 10−6 (W/L)vOV,1
= 250 ⇒(W/L) vOV,1 = 10
Condition 2:
rDS,2 =
1
400 × 10−6 (W/L) vOV,2
= 1000 ⇒(W/L) vOV,2 = 2.5
If condition 1 is met, condition 2 will be met since
the over-drive voltage can always be reduced to
satisfy this requirement. For condition 1, we want
to decrease W/L as much as possible (so long as it
is greater than or equal to 1), while still meeting
all of the other constraints. This requires our
using the largest possible vGS,1 voltage.
vGS,1 = 1.8 V so vOV,1 = 1.8 −0.5 = 1.3 V, and
W/L =
10
vOV,1
= 10
1.3 = 7.69
Condition 2 now can be used to find vGS,2
vOV,2 = 2.5
W/L = 2.5

(a) |vSG| = |Vtp| + |vOV|

(b) For the p-channel transistor to operate in
saturation, the drain voltage must not exceed the
gate voltage by more than |Vtp|. Thus
vDmax = −0.9 + 0.5 = −0.4 V
Put differently, vSD must be at least equal to |vOV|,
which in this case is 0.4 V. Thus vDmax = −0.4 V.

Figure 1 shows graphs for iD/kn versus vDS for
various values of vOV. Since the right-hand side
of Eq. (1) does not have any MOSFET
parameters, these graphs apply for any n-channel
MOSFET with the assumption that λ = 0. They
also apply to p-channel devices with vDS replaced
by vSD, kn by kp, and vOV with |vOV|. The slope of
each graph at vDS = 0 is found by differentiating
Eq. (1) relative to vDS with vOV = VOV and then
substituting vDS = 0. The result is

Thus, rDS will vary in the range of 2.5 k to
125 .
(a) If W is halved, kn will be halved and rDS will
vary in the range of 5 k to 250 .
(b) If L is halved, kn will be doubled and rDS will
vary in the range of 1.25 k to 62.5 .
(c) If both W and L are halved, kn will remain
unchanged and rDS will vary in the original range
of 2.5 k to 125 .
5.30 (a) Refer to Fig. P5.30. For
saturation-mode operation of an NMOS
transistor, vDG ≥−Vtn; thus vDG = 0 results in
saturation-mode operation. Similarly, for a
p-channel MOSFET, saturation-mode operation
is obtained for vGD ≥−|Vtp|, which includes
vGD = 0. Thus, the diode-connected MOSFETs

The saturation–triode boundary is determined by

vGS = vGD + vDS, one has
vGS = 0.4 + 1.0 = 1.4 V at the boundary.

increases VA by a factor of 4 and hence increases
ro by a factor of 4.
Halving VOV results in decreasing i′

of 4. Thus, this alone increases ro by a factor of 4.
The overall increase in ro is by a factor of
4 × 4 = 16.

5.41 Case (a): Since VGS > 0 and VDS > 0,
transistor 1 must be NMOS. Also, since in both
situations VDG is positive, the NMOS transistor is
operating in saturation and we can obtain Vt from
(1 −Vt)2
(1.5 −Vt)2 = 100
400 ⇒Vt = 0.5 V
To find kn we write
100 = 1
2kn(1−0.5)2 ⇒kn = 800 µA/V2
Case (b): Here VSG and VSD are both greater than
zero, thus transistor 2 must be PMOS. Also, since
in both situations VGD is positive, the PMOS
transistor must be operating in saturation and we
can find | Vt | from,
(2−| Vt |)2
(3−| Vt |)2 = 50
450 ⇒| Vt |= 1.5 V
To find kp we write
50 = 1
2 kp(2−1.5)2 ⇒kp = 400 µA/V2
Case (c): Since VSG and VSD are both positive,
transistor 3 must be PMOS. At the second
operating point, VGD is positive and thus the
transistor is operating in saturation. However, at
the first operating point, VGD is −1 V and we
cannot tell whether the transistor is in saturation
or in the triode region. Assuming saturation-mode
operation in both cases, we can find | Vt | from
(2−| Vt |)2
(3−| Vt |)2 = 200
800 ⇒| Vt |= 1 V
We thus see that at the first operating point
VDG =| Vt | confirming operation in saturation, as
already assumed (actually, at the boundary

between saturation and triode). We can find kp by
writing
200 = 1
2 kp(2−1)2 ⇒kp = 400 µA/V2
Case (d): Since VGS > 0 and VDS > 0, transistor
4 must be NMOS. At the first operating point,
VDG = 0 and the transistor must be in saturation.
At the second operating point, VDG is negative by
3 V and it is not clear whether the transistor is in
saturation or in triode region. Assuming
saturation in both cases,
(2 −Vt)2
(4 −Vt)2 = 72
270 ⇒Vt = −0.136
Since Vt must be positive, we conclude that our
assumption of saturation-mode operation in the
second case is not correct, and the transistor must
be operating in triode. Thus
1
2(2 −Vt)2
(4 −Vt) × 1 −1
2 × 12 = 72
270 ⇒Vt = 0.8 V or 2.7 V
The second solution does not make physical
sense as it results in ID = 0 at the first operating
point. Thus
Vt = 0.8 V
and kn can be found from
72 = 1
2kn(2−0.8)2 ⇒kn = 100 µA/V2
The results are provided in the filled-out table
above.

(b) V2 = +1 −VDS = 1 −1 = 0 V
(c) V3 = VSD = VSG = 1 V
(d) V4 = +1.25 −VSG = 1.25 −1 = 0.25 V
Now place a resistor R in series with the drain.
For the circuits in (a) and (b) to remain in
saturation, VD must not fall below VG by more
than Vt.
Thus,
IR ≤Vt
Rmax = Vt
I = 0.5
0.1 = 5 k
For the circuits in (c) and (d) to remain in
saturation, VD must not exceed VG by more than
|Vt|. Thus
IR ≤|Vt|
which yields Rmax = 5 k.
Now place a resistor RS in series with the
MOSFET source. The voltage across the current
source becomes
(a) VCS = 2.5 −VDS −IRS
(1)
To keep VCS at least at 0.5 V, the maximum RS
can be found from
0.5 = 2.5 −1 −0.1 × RSmax
⇒RSmax = 10 k
V1 = 2.5 −0.5 = 2 V
(b) VCS = 1 −VDS −IRS −(−1.5)

(a) Q1 and Q2 are matched. Thus, from

split equally between Q1 and Q2:
ID1 = ID2 = 100 µA
V1 = V2 = 2.5 −0.1 × 20 = 0.5 V

10% is relatively small, given the large variations
in kn and Vt (50% increase in each). The new
value of VD is

5.58 (a) Refer to the circuit in Fig. P5.58(a).
Transistor Q1 is operating in saturation. Assume
that Q2 also is operating in saturation,
VGS2 = 0 −V2 = −V2
and
V2 = −1 + ID × 4
⇒ID = 0.25(V2 + 1)
Now,
ID = 1
2kn(VGS2 −Vt)2
Substituting ID = 0.25(V2 + 1) and VGS2 = −V2,
0.25(V2 + 1) = 1

0.1(V2 + 1) = V2
2 + 0.8 V2 + 0.16
V2
2 + 0.7 V2 + 0.06 = 0
⇒V2 = −0.6 V
Thus,
ID = 0.25(V2 + 1) = 0.1 mA
and
VGS2 = 0.6 V
Since Q1 is identical to Q2 and is conducting the
same ID, then
VGS1 = 0.6 V
⇒V1 = 0.5 −0.6 = −0.1 V
which confirms that Q2 is operating in saturation,
as assumed.
(b) Refer to the circuit in Fig. P5.58(b). From
symmetry, we see that

V4 = +1 V
Now, consider the part of the circuit consisting
of Q2 and the 4-k resistor. We observe
the similarity of this part with the circuit
between the gate of Q2 and the −1 V supply in
Fig. P5.58(a). It follows that for the circuit in
Fig. P5.58(b), we can use the solution of part (a)
above to write
ID2 = 0.1 mA
and
VGS2 = 0.6 V
Thus,
V5 = V4 −VGS2 = 1 −0.6 = 0.4 V
Since Q1 is conducting an equal ID and has the
same VGS,
ID1 = 0.1 mA
and
VGS1 = 0.6 V
⇒V3 = V4 + VGS1 = 1 + 0.6 = 1.6 V
We could, of course, have used the circuit’s
symmetry, observed earlier, to write this final
result.

5.60 Refer to the circuit in Fig. P5.60. First
consider Q1 and Q2. Both are operating in
saturation and since they are identical, they have
equal VGS:
VGS1 = VGS2 = 2
2 = 1 V
Thus,
ID2 = ID1 = 1
2 μnCox

L (VGS1 −Vt)2

2 × 400 × 0.5

Now, Q3 has the same VGS at Q1 and is matched
to Q1. Thus if we assume that Q3 is operating in
saturation, we have
ID3 = ID1 = 50 µA
Thus,
I2 = 50 µA
This is the same current that flows through Q4,
which is operating in saturation and is matched to
Q3. Thus
VGS4 = VGS3 = VGS1 = 1 V
Thus,
V2 = 2 −1 = 1 V
This is equal to the voltage at the gate of Q3; thus
Q3 is indeed operating in saturation, as
assumed.
If Q3 and Q4 have W = 5 µm, nothing changes
for Q1 and Q2. However, Q3, which has the same
VGS as Q1 but has 10 times the width, will have a
drain current 10 times larger than Q1.
Thus
I2 = ID3 = 10 ID1 = 10 × 50 µA
= 0.5 mA
Transistor Q4 will carry I2 but will retain the same
VGS as before, thus V2 remains unchanged at 1 V.

both W and L are doubled, kn remains unchanged.

iD becomes 0.412 mA; and for vDS = 10 V, iD

The depletion-type MOSFET operates in the
triode region when vDS ≤vGS −Vt: that is,
vDG ≤−Vt, where Vt is negative. In the case
shown in Fig. 1, vDG = 0. Thus the condition for
triode-mode operation is satisfied, and

Solutions to Exercises within the Chapter
Ex: 6.1 Refer to Fig. 6.2(a) and 6.2(b).
Coordinates of point A: Vt and VDD; thus 0.4 V
and 1.8 V. To determine the coordinates of
point B, we use Eqs. (6.7) and (6.8) as follows:
VOV

B =

knRD

Thus,


B = 0.4 + 0.213 = 0.613 V
and
VDS

B = VOV

B = 0.213 V
Thus, coordinates of B are 0.613 V and 0.213 V.

Since the collector voltage is allowed to decrease
to +0.3 V, the largest negative swing allowed at
the output is 2 −0.3 = 1.7 V. The corresponding
input signal amplitude can be found by dividing
1.7 V by the gain magnitude (320 V/V), resulting
in 5.3 mV.

Although a larger fraction of the input signal
reaches the amplifier input, linearity
considerations cause the output signal to be in
fact smaller than in the original design!

ID = 1

VD = 5 −6.2 × 0.49 = 1.96 V
Ex: 6.35 Refer to Example 6.12.
(a) For design 1, RE = 3 k, R1 = 80 k, and
R2 = 40 k. Thus, VBB = 4 V.
IE =
VBB −VBE
RE + R1∥R2
β + 1
For the nominal case, β = 100 and
IE =
4 −0.7
3 + 40∥80
101
= 1.01 ≃1 mA
For β = 50,
IE =
4 −0.7
3 + 40∥80
51
= 0.94 mA
For β = 150,
IE =
4 −0.7
3 + 40∥80
151
= 1.04 mA
Thus, IE varies over a range approximately 10%
of the nominal value of 1 mA.
(b) For design 2, RE = 3.3 k, R1 = 8 k, and
R2 = 4 k. Thus, VBB = 4 V. For the nominal
case, β = 100 and
IE =
4 −0.7
3.3 + 4∥8
101
= 0.99 ≃1 mA
For β = 50,
IE =
4 −0.7
3.3 + 4∥8
51
= 0.984 mA
For β = 150,
IE =
4 −0.7
3.3 + 4∥8
151
= 0.995 mA
Thus, IE varies over a range of 1.1% of the
nominal value of 1 mA. Note that lowering
the resistances of the voltage divider considerably
decreases the dependence on the value of β, a
highly desirable result obtained at the expense
of increased current and hence power
dissipation.
Ex: 6.36 Refer to Fig. 6.55. Since the circuit is to
be used as a common-base amplifier, we can
dispense with RB altogether and ground the base;
thus RB = 0. The circuit takes the form shown in
the figure below.

To establish IE = 1mA,

RE
⇒RE = 4.3 k
The voltage gain vo
vi
= gmRC, where
gm = IC
VT
= 40 mA/V.
To maximize the voltage gain, we select RC as
large as possible, consistent with obtaining a
±2-V signal swing at the collector. To maintain
active-mode operation at all times, the collector
voltage should not be allowed to fall below the
value that causes the CBJ to become forward
biased, namely, −0.4 V. Thus, the
lowest possible dc voltage at the
collector is −0.4 V + 2V = +1.6 V.
Correspondingly,
RC = 10 −1.6
IC

⇒RB = 162 k

RC = 7.5 k
The resulting value of IE is found as
IE = 10 −0.7
7.5 + 160
101

and the collector voltage will be
VC = VCC −IERC = 2.3 V
Ex: 6.38 Refer to Fig. 6.57(b).
VS = 3.5 V and ID = 0.5 mA; thus
RS = VS
ID

0.5 = 7 k
VDD = 15 V and VD = 6 V; thus

ID = 1
2knV2
OV
0.5 = 1
2 × 4V2
OV
⇒VOV = 0.5 V
Thus,
VGS = Vt + VOV = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 V
We now can obtain the dc voltage required at the
gate,
VG = VS + VGS = 3.5 + 1.5 = 5 V
Using a current of 2 µA in the voltage divider, we
have
RG2 = 5 V
2 µA = 2.5 M
The voltage drop across RG1 is 10 V, thus
RG1 = 10 V
2 µA = 5 M

ro, we use

The current through RB1 is

B =

knRD

Av = −knRDVOV
= −10 × 20 × 0.2 = −40 V/V
The lowest instantaneous voltage allowed at the
output is VDS

B = 0.22 V. Thus the maximum
allowable negative signal swing at the output is
VDSQ −0.22 = 1 −0.22 = 0.78 V. The
corresponding peak input signal is
ˆvgs = 0.78 V
|Av|

Thus,

Substituting VDD = 2 V, rearranging the equation
to obtain a quadratic equation in knRD, and

The transistor enters saturation when
vCE ≤0.3 V, thus the maximum allowable output
voltage swing is 1 −0.3 = 0.7 V. The
corresponding maximum input signal permitted
ˆv be is
ˆv be = 0.7 V
| Av| = 0.7
160 = 4.4 mV
6.5 To determine | Av max|, we use Eq. (6.23),
| Av max| = VCC −0.3
VT
Then, for VCE = VCC

we obtain
| Av| =
VCC −VCC

VT
= VCC

Finally, if a negative-going output signal swing
of 0.4 is required, to obtain maximum gain the
transistor must be biased at VCE = 0.4 +
0.3 = 0.7 V and the gain achieved
becomes
| Av| = VCC −0.7

(c) From part (a) above, the maximum
instantaneous input signal while the transistor
remains in saturation is 1.61 V and the
corresponding output voltage is 0.61 V. Thus, the
maximum amplitude of input sine wave is
(1.61 −1.5) = 0.11 V. That is, vGS ranges from
1.5 −0.11 = 1.39 V, at which
iD = 1
2 × 1 × (1.39 −1)2 = 0.076 mA
and
vDS = 5 −0.076 × 24 = 3.175 V
and vGS = 1.5 + 0.11 = 1.61 V at which
vDS = 0.61 V.
Thus, the large-signal gain is
0.61 −3.175
1.61 −1.39 = −11.7 V/V
whose magnitude is slightly less (−2.5%) than
the incremental or small-signal gain (−12 V/V).

On the verge of satuation
VCE −ˆvce = 0.3 V
For linear operation, vce = Avvbe
VCE −| Av ˆvbe| = 0.3
( 5 −ICRC ) −| Av| × 5 × 10−3 = 0.3
But
| Av| = ICRC
VT
Thus,
ICRC = | Av|VT
and
5 −| Av|VT −| Av| × 5 × 10−3 = 0.3
| Av|( 0.025 + 0.005 ) = 5 −0.3
| Av| = 156.67.
Note AV is negative.
∴Av = −156.67 V/V
Now we can find the dc collector voltage.
Referring to the sketch of the output voltage, we
see that
VCE = 0.3 + | Av| 0.005 = 1.08 V
6.16 To obtain an output signal of peak
amplitude P volts and maximum gain, we bias the
transistor at
VCE = VCEsat + P
The resulting gain will be
Av = −VCC −VCE
VT
which results in VCC of
VCC = VCE + | Av|VT
Thus the minimum required VCC will be
VCCmin = VCEsat + P + | Av|VT
but we have to make sure that the amplifier
can support a positive peak amplitude of P,
that is,
| Av|VT ≥P,
otherwise the transistor cuts off at or near the
positive peaks.
In the results obtained, tabulated below, VCEsat =
0.3 V and VCC is the nearest 0.5 V to VCCmin.

Using the small-signal voltage gain with

Using the exponential characteristic
yields
iC = ICevBE/VT
= 1 × e5/25 = 1.22 mA
Thus, △iC = 0.22 mA and
△vO = −△iCRC
= −0.22 × 2 = −0.44 V
Repeating for △vBE = −5 mV as
follows.
Using the small-signal voltage
gain:
△vO = −80 × −5 = +0.4 V
Using the exponential characteristic:
iC = ICevBE/VT
= 1 × e−5/25 = 0.82 mA
Thus, △iC = 0.82 −1 = −0.18 mA and

At vCE = 0, iC = βiB
∴iC = 50 × 100
= 5 mA
Given the base bias current of 50 µA, the dc or
bias point of the collector current IC, and voltage
VCE can be found from the intersection of the load
line and the transistor line L1 of iB = 50 µA.
Specifically:
Eq. of L1 ⇒iC = IC ( 1 + vCE/VA )
= 5 ( 1 + vCE/100 )
= 5 + 0.05vCE
Load line ⇒iC = VCC −vCE
RC
= 10 −vCE
∴10 −vCE = 5 + 0.05vCE
VCE = vCE = 4.76 V
IC = iC = 10 −vCE = 5.24 mA
Now for a signal of 30-µA peak superimposed on
IB = 50 µA, the operating point moves along the
load line between points N and M. To obtain the
coordinates of point M, we solve the load line and
line L2 to find the intersection M, and the load
line and line L3 to find N:
For point M:
iC = 8 + (8/100)vCE and iC = 10 −vCE
∴iC

In addition to the component at (2ω), there is a dc
shift in the value of iD given by
2.5 × 0.0152 × 0.5 = 2.8 × 10−4 mA = 0.28 µA
Compared to ID = 100 µA, this shift is
negligible.

Av = −gmRD

To obtain maximum gain while allowing for a
0.2-V peak signal at the drain, we bias so that
VDS = 0.2 + VOV
(1)
which indicates that the minimum signal at the
drain will be equal to VOV. Since we can express
the gain magnitude of
| Av |= VDD −VDS
0.5VOV
Thus,
10 = 1.8 −VDS

From the circuit, we obtain
VG = VGS + 0.5 × 7
= 1.5 + 3.5 = 5 V
which is consistent with the value provided by the
voltage divider.
Since the drain voltage (+7 V) is higher than the
gate voltage (+5 V), the transistor is operating in
saturation.
From the circuit
VD = VDD −IDRD = 15 −0.5 × 16 = +7 V, as
assumed

small-signal resistance r is given by
r ≡vx

6.35 Refer to Fig. P6.53. The transistor is biased
at IE = 0.33 mA. Thus
re = VT
IE

0.33 mA = 75 
Replacing the BJT with its T model results in the
following amplifier equivalent circuit.
The input resistance Rin can be found by

To obtain maximum gain and the largest possible
signal swing at the output for veb of 10 mV, we
select a value for RC that results in
VC + | Av| × 0.01 V = +0.4 V
which is the highest allowable voltage at the
collector while the transistor remains in the active
region. Since
VC = −5 + ICRC ≃−5 + 0.5RC
then
−5 + 0.5RC + gmRC × 0.01 = 0.4

achieved by biasing the transistor at the lowest

active mode at the negative peak of vo.
Thus

Rin ≃re
To obtain an input resistance of 75 ,
re = 75  = VT
IE
Thus,
IE = 25 mV
75  = 0.33 mA
This current is obtained by raising RE to the value
found from
IE = 10 −0.7
RE
= 0.33 mA
⇒RE = 28.2 k
Thus, n = 28.2
10 = 2.82.
The collector resistor becomes

Note that the dc voltage at the collector
remains unchanged. The voltage gain

6.57 Refer to Fig. P6.57. Since β is very large,
the dc base current can be neglected. Thus the dc
voltage at the base is determined by the voltage
divider,
VB = 5
100
100 + 100 = 2.5 V
and the dc voltage at the emitter will be
VE = VB −0.7 = 1.8 V
The dc emitter current can now be found as

RE

between 0.2 and 0.5 mA and also for IC above
1.25 mA. Practically speaking, one normally uses

the low value to minimize power dissipation. The
required value of IC is found by substituting for ro
and 1/gm from Eqs. (2) and (3), respectively, in
Eq. (1) and equating Gv to 50. The result (after
some manipulations) is the quadratic equation.
I2
C −2.25IC + 0.625 = 0
The two roots of this equation are IC = 0.325 mA
and 1.925 mA; our preferred choice is
IC = 0.325 mA.

Also,

VG = VS + VGS

Thus the voltage drop across RG1(5 V) is
larger than that across RG2(4 V). So we

RG2
RG1

⇒RG2 = 0.8RG1 = 0.8 × 22

Specifically,

It can be shown that the resulting ID will be
ID = 0.204 mA, which is very close to the desired
0.2 mA. Since VD = VDD −
IDRD ≃+6 V and VG ≃4 V, and the drain
voltage can go down to VG −Vt = 3.3 V, the
drain voltage is 2.7 V above the value that causes
the MOSFET to leave the saturation region.

IDmin is obtained with Vtmax and knmin:
IDmin = 1
2 × 0.2(5.07 −1.5)2 = 1.27 mA
With RS installed and Vt = 1 V,
kn = 0.3 mA/V2, we require ID = 1.5 mA:
1.5 = 1
2 × 0.3(VGS −1)2
⇒VGS = 4.16 V

Thus,

0.058I2
D −1.757ID + 2.488 = 0
which results in
ID = 28.8 mA, or 1.49 mA
The first value does not make physical sense.
Thus,
ID = 1.49 mA ≃1.5 mA
which is the maximum value. The minimum
value can be obtained by using kn = 0.2 mA/V2
and Vt = 1.5 V in Eq. (1),
ID = 1

0.038 I2
D −1.442ID + 1.274 = 0
which results in
ID = 37 mA or 0.91 mA
Here again, the physically meaningful answer is
ID = 0.91 mA, which is the minimum value of ID.
Thus with a 0.62-k resistance connected in the
source lead, the value of ID is limited to the range
of 0.91 mA to 1.5 mA.

RB2
RB1 + RB2

⇒RB1

Given that RB1 and RB2 are 1% resistors, the
maximum and minimum values of the ratio
RB1/RB2 will be 3.225 × 1.02 = 3.2899 and
3.225 × 0.98 = 3.1608. The resulting VBE will be
0.699 V and 0.721 V, respectively.
Correspondingly, IC will be
ICmax = 1 × e(0.710−0.699)/0.025
= 1.55 mA
and
ICmin = 1 × e(0.710−0.721)/0.025
ICmin = 0.64 mA
VCE will range from
VCEmin = 3 −1.55 × 2 = −0.1 V
which is impossible, implying that the transistor
will saturate at this value of dc bias!
VCEmax = 3 −0.64 × 2 = 1.72 V
It should be clear that this biasing arrangement is
useless, since even the small and inevitable
tolerances in RB1 and RB2 caused such huge
variations in IC that in one extreme the transistor
left the active mode of operation altogether!

Thus,

Since β ranges from 50 to 150 and IB is fixed at
0.01 mA, the collector current IC will range from
0.01 × 50 = 0.5 mA to 0.01 × 150 = 1.5 mA.
Correspondingly, VCE will range from
(3 −0.5 × 2) = 1 V to (3 −1.5 × 2) = 0 V. The
latter value implies that the high-β transistor will
leave the active region of operation and saturate.
Obviously, this bias method is very intolerant of
the inevitable variations in β. Thus it is not a
good method for biasing the BJT.

|Gv | ˆvsig = 7.3 × 0.154 = 1.13 V
(d) To be able to double ˆvsig without leaving
saturation, we must reduce ˆvgs to half of what
would be its new value; that is, we must keep ˆvgs
unchanged. This in turn can be achieved by
connecting an unbypassed Rs equal to 1/gm,
Rs =

Since ˆvgs does not change, the output voltage also
will not change, thus ˆvo = 1.13 V.

Comparing the results above to those of Problem
6.124, we see that raising the resistance values
has indeed resulted in increasing the transmission
from source to transistor base, from 0.371 V/V to
0.636 V/V. However, because IC has decreased
and gm has correspondingly decreased, the gain
from base to collector has decreased by a larger
factor (from 97.83 V/V to 43.2 V/V), with the
result that the overall gain has in fact decreased
(from 36.3 V/V to 27.5 V/V). Thus, this is not a
successful strategy!

To maximize the open-circuit voltage gain
between base and collector while ensuring that
the instantaneous collector voltage does not fall
below (vB −0.4) when vbe is as high as 5 mV, we
impose the constraint
VC −| Avo| × 0.005 = VB + 0.005 −0.4

For dc analysis, open-circuit the two coupling
capacitors. Then replace the 9-V source and the
two 20-k resistors by their Thévenin equivalent,
namely, a 4.5-V source and a 10-k series
resistance. The latter can be added to the 10-k
resistor that is connected to the base. The result is
the circuit shown in Fig. 1, which can be used to
calculate IE.

which is greatly reduced because of the absence
of bootstrapping. The latter causes the lower node
of the 10-k base-biasing resistor to rise with the
output voltage, thus causing a much reduced
signal current in the 10-k resistor and a
correspondingly larger effective resistance across
the amplifier input.

If all transistors are matched and are obviously

To keep Q2 in saturation,

value needed to keep Q3 in the active region,

So, with only one transistor diode connected, we
can get 25 µA, 50 µA, 200 µA, and 400 µA, or
four different currents.
Now, if two transistors are diode connected, the
effective width is the sum of the two widths.

(3) W = W3 = 40 µm ⇒VSG = 0.82 V

Thus, the change in IO is 0.15 mA.
7.18 Refer to the circuit in Fig. P7.18.
V2 = 2.7 −VEB = 2.7 −0.7 = +2 V
V3 = 0 + VEB = +0.7 V
Thus, Q3 and Q4 are operating in the active mode,
and each is carrying a collector current of I/2.
The same current is flowing in Q2 and Q1; thus
V1 = −2.7 + I

But
V1 = −VBE1 = −0.7

and each transistor has EBJ areas proportional to
the current required. Multiple, parallel transistors
are acceptable.
Note: This large value of R is not desirable in
integrated form; other designs may be more
suitable.
Even without knowing exact circuitry, we can
find the total power dissipation as approximately
PT = PCC + PEE
PT = 5 V (0.1 + 0.2 + 0.4 + 0.8) mA
+5 V (0.1 + 0.5 + 1 + 2) mA
PT = 7.5 mW + 18 mW = 25.5 mW
7.20 (a) Figure 1 shows the current conveyor
circuit with Y connected to a voltage V, X fed
with a current source I, and Z connected to a
voltage VZ that keeps Q5 operating in the active
mode. Assuming that all transistors are operating
in the active mode and that β ≫1, so that we can
neglect all base currents, we see that the current I
through Q1 will flow through the two-output
mirror Q3, Q4, and Q5. The current I in Q5 will be
drawn from Q2, which forms a mirror with Q1.
Thus VEB2 = VEB1 and the voltage that appears at
X will be equal to V. The current in Q5 will be
equal to I, thus terminal Z sinks a constant
current I.

Figure 2 shows the special case of V = 0 V. As

Replacing the MOSFET with its hybrid-π model
but neglecting ro results in the equivalent circuit
in Fig. 1. Observing that the controlled-source
gmvgs appears across its control voltage vgs, we
can replace it by a resistance 1/gm, as indicated.
Thus the small-signal resistance of the
diode-connected MOS transistor is 1/gm. For the

Now, gm is reduced by a factor of 5 and ro is

ID = 100 µA
A0 = 50 V/V
ID = 25 µA
A0 = 100 V/V
ID = 400 µA
A0 = 25 V/V
From Eq. (7.42), gm is proportional to

changing ID from 100 µA to 25 µA reduces gm
by a factor of 2. Changing ID from 100 µA to

output resistance of the current-source load,

second stage is

If L is to be an integer multiple of 0.13 µm, then
L = 0.39 µm
The gain achieved will be −10.6 V/V.
To raise the gain to 20 V/V, ro1 ∥ro2 has to be
raised to 40 k, which requires
L = 2 × 0.367 = 0.734
Again, to use a multiple of 0.13 µm we select
L = 0.78 µm.
This doubling of L will mean a doubling of W for
each of the three transistors. Thus the area (WL)
of each transistor will increase by a factor of 4
and the total gate area of the circuit will increase
by the same factor.

To obtain the maximum allowable negative signal

7.52 Refer to Fig. P7.52. To obtain maximum
output resistance, we use the largest possible Rs
consistent with IDRs ≤0.2 V. Thus
Rs = 0.2 V

Now, for Q2 we have

Thus,

(b) gm1 = 2 ID1

VOV2 = VOV1. Thus the maximum value of vo is
3.3 −0.224 = 3.076 V. Thus the peak-to-peak
value of vo is 3.076 −0.23 = 2.85 V.
Correspondingly, the peak-to-peak value of vsig

where Re is in kilohms.
(a) For Rout = 5 ro, Eq. (1) gives
Re = 0.208 k = 208 
(b) For Rout = 10 ro, Eq. (1) gives
Re = 0.495 k ≃500 .
(c) For Rout = 50 ro, Eq. (1) gives Re = 4.8 k.
From Eq. (1) we see that the maximum value of
Rout/ro is obtained with Re = ∞and its value is
101, which is (β + 1).
7.57
(a) Refer to Fig. 7.18(a) and note that the current

that enters the source of the transistor, thus
io = isig

and
io

20 + 1.46 = 0.93 A/A
Thus, a change in RL of 100% results in a change
in the current gain of only 2%.

Rin = 20 + 200

Chapter 7–22
Thus, a change of +900% in RL results in only a
change of −0.16 or −17% in the current
gain.
(e) The fact that the current gain io/isig of the CG
amplifier changes very little in the face of large
changes in RL indicates that it functions as a
current buffer.

current gain becomes
io
isig

10.2
10.2 + 0.4 = 0.94 A/A
Thus, in the face of a 100% change in RL, the
current gain decreases by 0.02 which is
approximately 2.1%:
(d) If RL is increased by a factor of 10 or by
900%, from 200 k to 2 M, the current gain
becomes
io
isig
= 0.98 ×
10.2
10.2 + 2
= 0.82 A/A
which is a decrease of 0.15 or 15%.
(e) A current buffer works to keep the current
gain as constant as possible in the face of changes
in the load resistance RL. From the results of (c)
and (d) above we see that the CB amplifier fulfills
this requirement admirably!

To obtain maximum negative signal swing at the
output, we select VG so that the voltage at the
drain of Q1 is the minimum permitted, which is
equal to VOV (i.e., 0.15 V). Thus
VG = 0.15 + VGS2
= 0.15 + VOV2 + Vt
= 0.15 + 0.15 + 0.4 = 0.7 V
The minimum permitted output voltage is
VG −Vt = 0.7 −0.4 = 0.3 V or 2VOV.

Thus,
VG4 = VDD −VSG4 = 1.3 −0.55 = 0.75 V
To obtain the largest possible signal swing at the
output, we maximize the allowable positive
signal swing by setting VD4 at its highest possible
value of VDD −|VOV| = 1.3 −0.15 = 1.15 V.
This will be obtained by selecting VG3 as follows:
VG3 = VD4 −VSG3
Since
VSG3 = VSG4 = 0.55 V
VG3 = 1.15 −0.55 = 0.6 V
The highest allowable voltage at the output will
be
vD3max = VG3 + |Vtp|
= 0.6 + 0.4 = 1 V
Since both Q3 and Q4 carry the same current
I = 100 µA and are operated at the same
overdrive voltage, |VOV| = 0.15 V, their W/L
ratios will be the same and can be found from

the highest allowable voltage at the output will be

VGS = VI = 0.6 V = Vt + VOV
Thus,
VOV = 0.6 −0.4 = 0.2 V
Similarly, for Q4,
VSG = VDD −VG4 = 1.3 −0.7 = 0.6 V
Thus,
|VOV| = VSG −|Vt| = 0.6 −0.4 = 0.2 V
The maximum allowable voltage at the output is
vOmax = VG3 + |Vt3|
= 0.4 + 0.4 = 0.8 V
The minimum allowable voltage at the output is
vOmin = VG2 −|Vt2|

Thus the output voltage can range from 0.5 V

Chapter 7–33
Analysis of the circuit proceeds as follows. Since
re1 = re2, we obtain
ie2 = ie1
(1)
Node equation at node 1:
ie3 + αie2 = ie1 + ie2
Using Eq. (1) yields
ie3 = (2 −α)ie1
(2)
Node equation at node 2:
ix = αie2 + (1 −α)ie3
Using Eqs. (1) and (2) yields
ix = ie1[α + (1 −α)(2 −α)ie3]
ix = ie1[(2 −2α + α2)]
(3)
Finally, vx can be expressed as the sum of the
voltages across re3 and re1,
vx = ie3re + ie1re
Using Eq. (2) yields
vx = ie1re(3 −α)
(4)
Dividing Eq. (4) by Eq. (3) yields
Rin = vx
ix

Thus, for IREF = 0.2 mA,

7.90 Replacing each of the three transistors in the
Wilson current mirror in Fig. 7.38(a) with its
T model results in the circuit in the figure.
Here, we have applied a test voltage vx to
determine Rin,
Rin ≡vx
ix
Since all three transistors are identical and are
operating at the same ID,
gm1 = gm2 = gm3
Now from the figure we see that
i1 = i2
and
i2 + i3 = i2 + i1
Thus
i3 = i1 = i2

Thus

The voltage vx can be expressed as the sum of the
voltages across 1/gm3 and 1/gm1:
vx = (i3/gm3) + (i1/gm1)
Substituting i3 = i2 and i1 = i2, gm1 = gm3 = gm,
and
vx = 2 i2/gm
But i2 = ix; thus
vx = 2 ix/gm
and thus
Rin = 2

IREF −IO = 0.8
100 = 0.008 mA = 8 µA
IO = 180 −8 = 172 µA
(c) Refer to Fig. 8.38(c). Since Q1 and Q2 are
now operating at equal VDS, we estimate
IO = IREF = 180 µA.
(d) The minimum allowable VO is the value at
which Q3 leaves the saturation region:
VOmin = VG3 −Vt

(e) Diode-connected transistor Q4 has an
incremental resistance 1/gm4. Reference to Fig.
7.38(b) indicates that the incremental resistance
of Q4 would appear in series with the gate of Q3
and thus carries zero current. Thus, including Q4
has no effect on the value of Ro, which can be
found from Eq. (7.99):
Ro = gm3ro3ro2

Solutions to Exercises within the Chapter
Ex: 8.1 Referring to Fig. 8.3,
If RD is doubled to 5 k,
VD1 = VD2 = VDD −I
2 RD
= 1.5 −0.4 mA
2
(5 k) = 0.5 V
VCMmax = Vt + VD = 0.5 + 0.5 = +1.0 V
Since the currents ID1, and ID2 are still 0.2 mA
each,
VGS = 0.82 V
So, VCMmin = VSS + VCS + VGS
= −1.5 V + 0.4 V + 0.82 V = −0.28 V
So, the common-mode range is
−0.28 V to +1.0 V
Ex: 8.2 (a) The value of vid that causes Q1 to
conduct the entire current is
√
2 VOV
→
√
2 × 0.316 = 0.45 V
then, VD1 = VDD −I × RD
= 1.5 −0.4 × 2.5 = 0.5 V
VD2 = VDD = +1.5 V
vO = VD2 −VD1 = +1 V
(b) For Q2 to conduct the entire current:
vid = −
√
2 VOV = −0.45 V
then,
VD1 = VDD = +1.5 V
VD2 = 1.5 −0.4 × 2.5 = 0.5 V
vO = VD2 −VD1 = −1 V
(c) Thus the differential output range is
+1 V to −1 V.

ID1 = ID2 = I
2 = 0.08 mA
VD1 = VD2 = VDD −ID1,2RD
= 1 −0.08 × 5 = +0.6 V
VO = 0 V
Since VCM = 0.4 V and VD = 0.6 V,
VGD = −0.2 V, which is less than Vtn (0.4 V),
indicating that our implicit assumption of
saturation-mode operation is justified.
(d) VCM = −0.1 V
VS = −0.1 −VGS = −0.1 −0.6 = −0.7 V
ID1 = ID2 = I
2 = 0.08 mA
VD1 = VD2 = VDD −ID1,2RD

(e) The highest value of VCM for which Q1 and
Q2 remain in saturation is
VCMmax = VD1,2 + Vtn
= 0.6 + 0.4 = 1.0 V
(f) To maintain the current-source operating
properly, we need to keep a minimum voltage of
0.2 V across it, thus
VSmin = −VSS + VCS = −1 + 0.2 = −0.8 V
VCMmin = VSmin + VGS

VS = 0 + VSG = +0.6 V
VD1 = VD2 = −VSS + IDRD

Since for each of Q1 and Q2,
VSD = 0.6 −(−0.5)
= 1.1 V
which is greater than |VOV|, Q1 and Q2 are
operating in saturation as implicitly assumed.
(b) The highest value of VCM is limited by the
need to keep a minimum of 0.2 V across the
current source, thus
VCMmax = +0.9 −0.2 −VSG
= +0.9 −0.2 −0.6 = +0.1 V
The lowest value of VCM is limited by the need to
keep Q1 and Q2 in saturation, thus
VCMmin = VD1,2 −|Vtp|

Thus,

The lower limit on VCM is determined by the need

The upper limit on VCM is determined by the need

All transistors have the same channel length and
are carrying a dc current I/2. Thus all transistors
have the same ro = |VA|
I/2 . Also, all transistors are
operating at the same |VOV| and have equal dc
currents, thus all have the same
gm = 2(I/2)
|VOV| = I/|VOV|. Thus all transistors have
equal intrinsic gain gmro = 2|VA|/|VOV|. Now, the
gain Ad is given by
Ad = gm(Ron ∥Rop)
= 1

2gm(gmro)ro = 1

Q.E.D.
To obtain Ad = 500 V/V while operating all
transistors at |VOV| = 0.2 V, we use
500 = 2|VA|2
0.04
⇒|VA| = 3.16 V
Since |V′
A| = 5 V/µm, the channel length L (for
all transistors) must be
3.16 = 5 × L
L = 0.632 µm
To obtain the highest possible gm, we operate at
the highest possible I consistent with limiting the
power dissipation (in equilibrium) to 0.5 mW.
Thus,
I =

Note that since vG1 = vid = 0.283 V, Q1 is still

vO = vD2 −vD1 = 1 −0.2 = 0.8 V
(d) iD1 = 0.04 mA and iD2 = 0.12 mA. Since this
split of the current I is the complement of that in
case (b) above, the value of vid must be the
negative of that found in (b). Thus,
vid = −0.104 V
vGS1 = 0.541 V
vS = −0.645 V
vGS2 = 0.645 V
vD1 = VDD −iD1RD

vO = vD2 −vD1 = −0.4 V
(e) iD1 = 0 (Q1 just cuts off) and iD2 = 0.16 mA.
This case is the complement of that in (c) above,
thus

Summary
A summary of the results is shown in the table
above.
8.11 Refer to Fig. P8.2.
To determine VOV, consider the case vid = 0,
0.1 = 1
2 × 5 × |VOV|2
⇒|VOV| = 0.2 V
With vG2 = 0 and vG1 = vid, to steer the current
from one side of the differential pair to the other,
vid must be the ends of the range
−
√

√
2 |VOV|
that is,
−0.283 V ≤vid ≤+0.283 V
At vid = −0.283 V, Q2 just cuts off, thus
vS = |Vtp| = 0.4 V
and
vSG1 = 0.4 −(−0.283) = 0.683 V
At this value of vSG1,

iD1 = 1
2 × 5 × (0.683 −0.4)2
= 0.2 mA
which is the entire bias current.
vD1 = −0.9 + 0.2 × 4 = −0.1 V
Thus, vDG1 = −0.1 −(−0.283) = +0.183 which
is less than |Vtp|; thus Q1 is still operating in
saturation, as implicitly assumed.
vD2 = −0.9 V
Finally,
vO = vD2 −vD1 = −0.8 V
At vid = +0.283 V, Q1 just cuts off, thus
vSG1 = |Vtp| = 0.4 V and
vS = +0.283 + 0.4 = +0.683 V
and thus
vSG2 = 0.683 V
which results in
iD2 = 1
2 × 5 (0.683 −0.4)2
= 0.2 mA
which is the entire bias current. Here,
vD1 = −0.9 V
vD2 = −0.9 + 0.2 × 4 = −0.1 V
which verifies that Q2 is operating in saturation,
as implicitly assumed.
Finally,
vO = vD2 −vD1 = +0.8 V

For the transistor to remain in saturation
vDmin ≥vGmax −Vtn
where
vGmax = VCM + Vpeak(input)
= 0.5 + 0.005 = 0.505 V
Thus,
VDD −2.1 ≥0.505 −0.5
VDD ≥2.105 V
Thus, the lowest value of VDD is 2.11 V.

Equating the gains from Eqs. (1) and (2), we get

That is, the differential pair must be biased at a
current twice that of the CS amplifier. Since both
circuits use equal power supplies, the power
dissipation of the differential pair will be twice
that of the CS amplifier.
8.21 Since both circuits use the same supply
voltages and dissipate equal powers, their
currents must be equal, that is,
ID = I
where ID is the bias current of the CS amplifier
and I is the bias current of the differential pair.

Because the voltages at their gates are zero and at

(b) Refer to Fig. 8.15(a).
The maximum value of VCM is limited by the
need to keep Q1 and Q2 in the active mode. This
is achieved by keeping vCE1,2 ≥0.3 V.
Since VC1,2 = 0.4 V,
VEmax = 0.4 −0.3 = 0.1 V
and
VCMmax = VBE1,2 + VEmax
VCMmax = 0.574 + 0.1 = 0.674 V
The minimum value of VCM is dictated by the
need to keep the current source operating
properly, i.e., to keep 0.3 V across it, thus
VEmin = −1.2 + 0.3 = −0.9 V
and
VCMmin = VEmin + VBE1,2
= −0.9 + 0.574 = −0.326 V
Thus, the input common-mode range is

vid = 200 mV appears across (2 re + 2 Re). Thus
the signal across (re + Re) is 100 mV. Since the
signal across re is 5 mV, it follows that the signal
across Re must be 100 −5 = 95 mV and thus
Re = 19re
(See signal distribution on the figure above.)
The input resistance Rid is

The determination of a suitable value of VCC
requires information on the required input

Suffice it to say that the dc voltage drop across

(a) For vB1 = +0.5 V, Q1 conducts all the
current I (0.4 mA) while Q2 cuts off. Thus Q1
will have a VBE obtained as follows:
VBE1 = 0.7 + 0.025 ln
0.99 × 0.4
1

= 0.677 V
Thus,
VE = +0.5 −0.677 = −0.177 V
which indicates that VBE2 = +0.177 V, too small
to turn Q2 on.
VC1 = VCC −IC1RC
= 2.5 −0.99 × 0.4 × 5
= +0.52 V
VC2 = VCC −IC2 × RC
= 2.5 −0 × 5 = 2.5 V
Observe that Q1 is operating in the active mode,
as implicitly assumed, and the current source has
a voltage of 2.323 V across it, more than
sufficient for its proper operation.
(b) With vB1 = −0.5 V, Q1 turns off and Q2
conducts all the bias current (0.4 mA) and thus
exhibits a VBE of 0.677 V, thus
VE = −0.677 V
which indicated that VBE1 = +0.177 V, which is
too small to turn Q1 on. Also, note that the
current source has a voltage of
−0.677 + 2.5 = 1.823 V across it, more than
sufficient for its proper operation.
VC1 = VCC −IC1RC
= 2.5 −0 × 5 = 2.5 V
VC2 = 2.5 −0.99 × 0.4 × 5 = +0.52 V
8.38 Refer to Fig. 8.15(a) and assume the
current source I is implemented with a single
BJT that requires a minimum of 0.3 V for
proper operation. Thus, the minimum voltage
allowed at the emitters of Q1 and Q2 is
−2.5 V + 0.3 V = −2.2 V. Now, since each of
Q1 and Q2 is conducting a current of 0.2 mA,
their VBE voltages will be equal:
VBE1,2 = 0.7 + 0.025 ln
0.99 × 0.2
1

= 0.660 V
Thus, the minimum allowable VCM is
VCMmin = −2.2 + 0.660 = −1.54 V
The upper limit on VCM is dictated by the need to
keep Q1 and Q2 operating in the active mode, thus
VCMmax = 0.4 + VC1,2
= 0.4 + (2.5 −0.99 × 0.2 × 5)
= +1.91 V
Thus, the input common-mode range is
−1.54 V ≤VICM ≤1.91 V

Since Q2 has twice the EBJ area of Q1, the

that is,
iE2 = 2 iE2
Thus,
iE2 = 1 mA
and
iE1 = 0.5 mA

iC2 = 200 −138 = 62 µA
(c) For vid = 200 mV while iC1 = 138 µA and
iC2 = 62 µA: Since iC1 and iC2 have not changed,
vBE1 and vBE2 also would not change. Thus,
vB1 −vB2 = vBE1 + iE1Re −iE2Re −vBE2
= (vBE1 −vBE2) + Re (iE1 −iE2)

With Re,
vid = 200 mV →iC1 −iC2 = 76 µA
Gm = 76 µA

Thus, the effective Gm has been reduced by a
factor of 10, which is the same factor by which
the allowable input signal has been increased
while maintaining the same linearity.

Using Eq. (2), we obtain

Using this value for I, we get

determine the allowable value of Ad,

⇒Ad = 63.2 V/V
Thus, by reducing VCMmax from 1.4 V to 1 V, we
are able to increase the differential gain from

results in

8.63 It is required to raise the CMRR by 40 dB,
that is, by a factor of 100. Thus, the cascoding of
the bias current source must raise its output

We observe that by accepting a larger offset we
are able to obtain a higher gain. Observe that the
gain realized is proportional to the offset voltage
one is willing to accept. Also, observe that the
bias current required increases by a factor equal
to the square of the increase in gain.

(a) RC1 = 1.04 × 5 = 5.20 k
RC2 = 0.96 × 5 = 4.80 k
To equalize the total resistance in each collector,
we adjust the potentiometer so that
RC1 + x × 1 k = RC2 + (1 −x) × 1 k
5.2 + x = 4.8 + 1 −x
⇒x = 0.3 k
(b) If the area of Q1 and hence IS1 is 5% larger
than nominal, then we have
IS1 = 1.05IS
and the area of Q2 and hence IS2 is 5% smaller
than nominal,
IS2 = 0.95IS
Thus,
IE1 = 0.5 × 1.05 = 0.525 mA
IE2 = 0.5 × 0.95 = 0.475 mA
Assuming α ≃1, we obtain
IC1 = 0.525 mA
IC2 = 0.475 mA
To reduce the resulting offset to zero, we adjust
the potentiometer so that

The current I splits equally between the two
emitters. However, the unequal β’s will mean
unequal α’s. Thus, the two collector currents will
be unequal,
IC1 = α1I/2
IC2 = α2I/2
and the collector voltages will be unequal,
VC1 = VCC −α1(I/2)RC
VC2 = VCC −α2(I/2)RC
Thus a differential output voltage VO develops:
VO = VC2 −VC1

The input offset voltage VOS can be obtained by
dividing VO by the differential gain Ad:

is kept constant, VOV will be reduced by a factor
of 2. Thus VOS becomes
VOS = 2 mV

To reduce this output voltage to zero, we apply a
dc input voltage vid in the direction shown in Fig.

the direction shown which is opposite in direction
to VO and of course |vod| = |VO|, thus

The gain Ad is found as follows:
Ad = α × Total resistance in collectors
Total resistance in emitters
= α × 2RC

where

IE1

2I/3 = 3VT
2I

thus,
Ad =
2αRC
4.5 VT/I = 2αIRC
4.5 VT
(2)
Substituting in Eq. (1) gives
vid = 0.75 VT = 18.75 mV
Now, using large signal analysis:
vid = VB2 −VB1 = (VB2 −VE) −(VB1 −VE)
IC1 = IS1e(VB1−VE)/VT
(3)
IC2 = IS2e(VB2−VE)/VT
(4)
where IS1 = 2 IS2.
To make IC1 = IC2,
IS1e(VB1−VE)/VT = IS2e(VB2−VE)/VT
e(VB2−VB1)/VT = 2
VB2 −VB1 = VT ln 2
Thus,
vid = 17.3 mV
which is reasonably close to the approximate
value obtained using small-signal analysis.
8.84 A 2-mV input offset voltage corresponds to
a difference △RC between the two collector
resistances,
2 = VT
△RC
RC
= 25 × △RC
20
⇒△RC = 1.6 k
Thus a 2-mV offset can be nulled out by adjusting
one of the collector resistances by 1.6 k. If the
adjustment mechanism raises one RC and lowers
the other, then each need to be adjusted by only
(1.6 k/2) = 0.8 k.
If a potentiometer is used (as in Fig. P8.84), the
total resistance of the potentiometer must be at
least 1.6 k. If specified to a single digit, we use
2 k.

8.96 The currents i1 to i13 are shown on the
circuit diagram. Observe that i11 = i7 = i3 (the
current that enters a transistor exits at the other
end!). Also observe that the mirror Q3 and Q4 is
indeed functioning properly as the drain currents
of Q3 and Q4 are equal (i12 = i2 = 1
4gmvid).
However, the currents in their ro’s are far from
being equal!
There are some inconsistencies that result from
the approximations made to obtain the results
shown in Fig. P8.96, namely, gmro ≫1. Note for
instance that although we find the current in ro of
Q2 to be 1

ro are 1

ro, which is approximately

The purpose of this problem is to show the huge
imbalance that exists in this circuit. In fact, Q1
has |vgs| = 1
4vid while Q2 has |vgs| = 3
4vid. This
imbalance results from the fact that the current
mirror is not a balanced load. Nevertheless, we
know that this circuit provides a reasonably high
common-mode rejection.

8.102 To determine Gmcm we use Eq. (8.133) and
assume ϵ to be negligibly small, thus
Gmcm =

where RSS = 100 k, Am = 0.98 A/A,

(0.98 −1) −

= 2.61 × 10−4 mA/V
The common-mode gain can now be found as
| Acm |=| Gmcm | (Rod∥Rom)
= 2.61 × 10−4 × (50∥75)
= 7.83 × 10−3 V/V
The CMRR can be found as
CMRR = | Ad |
| Acm | =

7.83 × 10−3
= 3.83 × 103 or 71.7 dB
8.103 To obtain CMRR = 80 dB or
CMRR = 104 we must design for a
common-mode gain | Acm | of
| Acm |= | Ad |
CMRR = 40
104 = 4×10−3 V/V
But,
| Acm |= Gmcm(Rod∥Rom)
Thus,
4 × 10−3 = Gmcm × (40∥40)
⇒Gmcm = 2 × 10−4 mA/V
Now, using Eq. (8.133) with ϵ assumed
negligibly small and ro = Rod, we obtain

Ideally, the dc voltage at the output is zero.
(b) The upper limit of VICM is determined by the
need to keep Q1 and Q2 in saturation, thus
VICMmax = VD1 + Vt
= VDD −|VSG4| + Vt
= 0.9 −|Vt| −|VOV4| + Vt
= 0.9 −0.2 = +0.7 V
The lower limit of VICM is determined by the need
to keep Q5 in saturation,
VICMmin = −0.9 + |VOV5| + |VGS1|
= −0.9 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.4 = −0.1 V
Thus
−0.1 V ≤VICM ≤+0.7 V
(c) vOmax = VDD −|VOV6|
= 0.9 −0.2 = +0.7 V
vOmin = −VSS + |VOV7|

Thus ID7 will exceed ID6 by 20 µA, which will

where
ro6 = 50 k

8.106 Refer to Fig. P8.106.
(a) With the inputs grounded and the output
at 0 V dc, we have
IE1 = IE2 = 1
2 × 0.4 = 0.2 mA
IE3 = IE4 ≃0.2 mA
IE5 ≃0.5 mA
IE6 = 1 mA
(b) The short-circuit transconductance of the first
stage is
Gm = gm1,2 = IC1,2
VT
≃0.2 mA
0.025 V = 8 mA/V
The voltage gain of the first stage can be obtained
by multiplying Gm by the total resistance at the
output node of the stage, i.e., the common
collectors of Q2 and Q4 and the base of Q5. Since
ro2 = ro4 = ∞, the resistance at this node is equal
to the input resistance of Q5 which is Rπ5,
rπ5 = β
gm5
where
gm5 = IC5
VT
=
0.5
0.025 = 20 mA/V
thus
rπ5 = 100
20 = 5 k
Thus the voltage gain of the first stage is given by
A1 ≡vb5
vid
= −Gmrπ5
= −8 × 5 = −40 V/V
The voltage gain of the second stage is
A2 ≡vc5
vb5
= −gm5RC
where RC5 is the total resistance in the collector
of Q5. Since ro5 = ∞, RC5 is simply the input
resistance of the emitter follower Q6, we have
RC5 = Ri6 = (β + 1)(re6 + RL)
where
re6 = VT
IE6
= 25 mV
1 mA = 25 
Ri6 = (100 + 1)(0.025 + 1)
= 103.5 k
Thus
A2 = −20 × 103.5 = −2070 V/V
The gain of the third stage is given by
A3 = vo
v5

RL
RL + re6

1 + 0.025 = 0.976 V/V
The overall voltage gain can now be obtained as

resistance, the total resistance in the collector of
Q7 now becomes the input resistance of Q8,
which is
Ri4 = (β + 1)(re8 + R6)
= 101 × (0.005 + 3) = 303.5 k
Thus the gain of the third stage now becomes
A3 = −α

and the overall voltage gain increases to

If the original amplifier is loaded in RL = 100 ,
Gv = 8513 ×

152 + 100 = 3378 V/V
Thus, although the output resistance of the
original amplifier is much lower than that of the
modified one, the overall voltage gain realized
when the original amplifier is loaded in 100-
resistance is much lower than that obtained with
the modified design. Thus, replacing the 15.7-k
resistance with a constant-current source is an
excellent modification to make!

Refer to Fig. (a) for the dc analysis. Replacing the
68 k-33 k divider network by its Thévenin
equivalent, we obtain
VBB = −5 V +

33 + 68 × 10 V

RBB = 68 k ∥33 k = 22.2 k

The upper limit of VICM is determined by the need
to keep Q5 in saturation, thus
VICMmax = VDD −|VOV5| −|VSG1|
= 0.9 −0.21 −0.61 = +0.08 V
The lower limit of VICM is determined by the need
to keep Q1 and Q2 in saturation, thus
VICMmin = VG3 −|Vt|
= −VSS + |VGS3| −|Vt|
= −0.9 + 0.61 −0.4 = −0.69 V
Thus
−0.69 V ≤VICM ≤+0.08 V
The output voltage range is
−VSS + VOV6 ≤vO ≤VDD −|VOV7|
that is,
−0.69 V ≤vO ≤+0.69 V
The results are summarized in the table at the top
of the page.
8.111 (a) Increasing (W/L)1 and (W/L)2 by a
factor of 4 reduces |VOV1,2| by a factor of 2. Thus
gm1,2 = 2ID/|VOV1,2| increase by a factor of 2.
(b) A1 is proportional to gm1,2, thus A1 increases
by a factor of 2 and the overall voltage gain
increases by a factor of 2.
(c) Since the input offset voltage is proportional
to |VOV1,2|, it will decrease by a factor of 2. This,
however, does not apply to VOS due to △Vt.

(b) The upper limit on VICM is determined by the
need to keep Q1 and Q2 in saturation, thus
VICMmax = VD1,2 + |Vt|
= VDD −|Vt| −|VOV| + |Vt|
= 1.2 −0.15 = 1.05 V
The lower limit on VICM is determined by the
need to keep Q5 in saturation, thus
VICM = |VOV5| + VGS1,2
= 0.15 + 0.15 + 0.35 = 0.65 V
Thus
0.65 V ≤VICM ≤1.05 V

8.114 Refer to Fig. 8.38. From Example 8.7, we
obtain
IC1 = IC2 = 0.25 mA
IC4 = IC5 = 1 mA
IC7 = 1 mA
IC8 = 5 mA
Thus
re1 = re2 ≃25 mV
0.25 mA = 100 
re4 = re5 = 25 mV
1 mA = 25 
With 100- resistance in the emitter of each of
Q1 and Q2, we have
Rid = (β + 1)(2re1,2 + 2Re1,2)
= 101 × (2 × 0.1 + 2 × 0.1)
= 40.4 k
Thus, Rid increases by a factor of 2. With 25-
resistance in the emitter of each of Q4 and Q5, the
input resistance of the second stage becomes
Ri2 = (β + 1)(2re4,5 + 2Re4,5)
= 101 (2 × 0.025 + 2 × 0.025)
= 10.1 k
Thus, Ri2 is increased by a factor of 2. The gain of
the first stage will be
vo1
vid
=
α × Total resistance between the collectors
of Q1 and Q2
Total resistance in emitters of Q1 and Q2
≃
40 k ∥10 k
2 × 0.1 + 2 × 0.1 = 20 V/V
Thus the gain of the first stage decreases but only
slightly. Of course, the two 100- resistances in
the emitters reduce the gain but some of the
reduction is mitigated by the increase in Ri2,
which increases the effective load resistance of
the first stage.
The gain of the second stage will now be
A2 = vo2
vo1
= −α
3 k ∥Ri3
2 × 0.025 + 2 × 0.025
From Example 8.14, Ri3 = 234.8 k, thus
A2 ≃−3 ∥234.8
0.1
= −29.6 V/V
which is half the value without the two 25-
emitter resistances. The gain of the third stage
remains unchanged at −6.42 V/V, and the gain of
the fourth stage remains unchanged at 1 V/V.
Thus the overall voltage gain becomes
vo
vid
= A1A2A3A4
= 20 × −29.6 × −6.42 × 1
= 3800.6 V/V
which is slightly less than half the gain obtained
without the emitter resistances. This is the price
paid for doubling Rid.
8.115 The output resistance is mostly determined
by R5. To reduce Ro by a factor of 2, we use
Ro = 152

76 = 3000 ∥

⇒R5 = 7.37 k
This change in R5 will affect the gain of the third
stage, which will now become
A3 = −R5 ∥(β + 1)(re8 + R6)
R4 + re7
= −7.37 ∥(101)(0.005 + 3)
2.3 + 0.025
= −3.1 V/V
which is about half the original value (not
surprising since R5 is about half its
original value). Thus, the amplifier gain will be
reduced by a factor of 2. To restore the gain of the
third stage to its original value, we can reduce R4.
This will, however, change Ri3 and will reduce
the gain of the second stage, though only slightly.
For instance, to restore the gain of the third stage
to −6.42 V/V, we use
2.3 + 0.025
R4 + 0.025 = 6.42

⇒R4 = 1.085 k

Now Ri3 = 101 × (1.085 + 0.025) = 112 k and
the gain of the second stage becomes

= −58.4 V/V
which is a slight decrease in magnitude from the
original value of −59.2 V/V.
8.116 (a) Refer to Fig. P8.116. The current ID in
each of the eight transistors can be found by
inspection. Then, gm of each transistor can be
determined as 2ID/|VOV| and ro as |VA|/ID. The
results are given in the table at the top of the page.

(c) See figure on next page. With vicm applied to

and Q2 with an equivalent circuit composed of a
controlled current, vicm/2RSS in parallel with a
very large output resistance (Ro1 and Ro2 which
are equal). The resistances Ro1 and Ro2 will be
much larger than the input resistance of each of
the mirrors Q3 −Q5 and Q4 −Q6 and thus we can
neglect Ro1 and Ro2 altogether. The short-circuit
output current of the Q4 −Q6 mirror will be

Q.E.D.
(e) The upper limit on VICM is determined by Q1
and Q2 remaining in saturation, thus
VICMmax = VDD −|VSG| + |Vt|
= VDD −|VOV|
The lower limit on VICM is determined by the
need to keep the bias current source in saturation,
i.e. maintaining a minimum voltage across it of
|VOV|, thus
VICMmin = −VDD + |VOV| + |VGS|
= −VDD + 2|VOV| + |Vt|
Thus
−VDD + |Vt| + 2|VOV| ≤VICM ≤VDD −|VOV|
The output linear range is
−VDD + |VOV| ≤vO ≤+VDD −|VOV|

To double fH by changing Rin, Eq. (2) indicates
that R′
sig must be halved:
R′
sig = 25 k
which requires Rin to be changed to Rin2,
25 k = 100 ∥Rin2
⇒Rin2 = 33.3 k
This change will cause | AM| to become
| AM2| =

33.3 + 100 × 3 × 4.1

which is about half the original value.
To double fH by changing RL, Eq. (2) indicates
that Cin must be halved:

Using Eq. (1), we obtain
1.83 = 1 + 0.2(1 + gmR′

Thus,
R′
L2 = 1.05 k

⇒RL = 1.24 k
and the midband gain becomes
| AM2| =

which is about a quarter of the original gain.
Clearly, changing Rin is the preferred course of

2π × 244 × 10−9 = 652 kHz
The estimate obtained using the open-circuit time
constants is more appropriate as it takes into
account the effect of CL. We note from Eq. (1)
that τCL is 16.4% of τH, thus CL has a significant
effect on the determination of fH.

2π × 620 × 10−9 = 257 kHz
The interaction of Rsig with the input capacitance
contributes all of τgs (50 ns) and a significant part
of τgd, namely
Cgd[Rsig(1 + gmR′
L)] = 1 × 10(1 + 50) = 510 ns
Thus, the total contribution of Rsig is
50 + 510 = 560 ns
which is 560
620 = 90.3% of τH. To double fH, we
must reduce τH to half of its value:
τH = 1
2 × 620 = 310 ns
Now,

fP3 =

2π × 9 × 10−12 × 0.67 × 103
= 26.4 MHz
Thus, the three poles have frequencies 1.59 MHz,
7.94 MHz, and 26.4 MHz. Since the frequency of
the second pole is more than two octaves higher
than that of the first pole, the 3-dB frequency will
be mostly determined by fP1,
f3dB ≃fP1 = 1.59 MHz

But,
τCL = CLR′

becomes less and less realistic, which is due to
the fact that it does not take CL into account.

MHz, τH must become
τH =
1
2πfH
=
1
2π × 200 × 106
= 795.8 ps
Since τgs remains constant at 26.6 ps, τCL must be
increased to
τCL = 795.8 −26.6 = 769.2 ps
But,
τCL = (Cgd + CL)Rgd
thus,
769.2 = (5 + CL) × 18.7
⇒CL + 5 = 41.1 fF
CL = 36.1 fF
Thus, the amount of additional capacitance to be
connected at the output is
36.1 −25 = 11.1 fF
9.58 The figure above shows the high-
frequency equivalent circuit of the amplifier
where the transistor has been replaced with its T
model with ro neglected. The transfer function
Vo/Isig can be found as follows:
Vgs = −Isig/Yin

Vgs = −

2 × 100 × 1000
= 6.8 + 64.5 + 6.7 + 5000 ns
Obviously the last term, which is due to the pole
at the output node, is dominant. The frequency of
the output pole is
fP =
1
2π × 5000 × 10−9 = 31.8 kHz
fH ≃fP = 31.8 MHz
Because the other poles are at much higher
frequencies, an estimate of the unity-gain
frequency can be found as
ft = | AM| fP = 105 × 31.8 × 103 = 3.18 GHz
This estimate of ft is not very good (too high!).
The other three poles have frequencies much
lower than 3.18 GHz and will cause the gain to
decrease faster, reaching the 0 dB value at a
frequency lower than 3.18 GHz. Also note that fT
of the BJTs is 1 GHz and the models we use for
the BJT do not hold at frequencies
approaching fT.

This equation results in two solutions,

The second answer is not very practical as it
implies the transistor is operating at
gm = 9/373 = 0.024 mA/V, a very small
transconductance!. We will pursue only the first
answer. Thus,
RL = 27 k

If VOV of the current source is reduced by a factor
of 2 while I remains unchanged, (W/L) must be
increased by a factor of 4. Assume L remains
unchanged, W must be increased by a factor of 4.
Since CSS is proportional to W, its value will be
quadrupled:
CSS = 400 fF
The output resistance RSS will remain unchanged.
Thus, fZ will decrease by a factor of 4 to become

9.78 See figure below. The mirror
high-frequency equivalent circuit is shown in the
figure. Note that we have neglected ro. The model
of the diode-connected transistor Q1 reduces to
re1 in parallel with Cπ1.
To obtain the current-transfer function Io(s)/Ii(s),
we first determine Vπ in terms of Ii. Observe that
the short-circuit at the output causes Cμ2 to
appear in parallel with Cπ1 and Cπ2. Thus,

To determine fH we use the method of
open-circuit time constants. Figure 9.33(b) shows
the circuit with Vsig = 0 and the four capacitances
indicated. Again, recall that here RL = ro2. Also,
in our present circuit there is a capacitance CL at
the output.
Capacitance Cμ1 sees a resistance Rμ1,
Rμ1 = Rsig ∥Rin

To find the resistance Rπ1 we refer to the circuit
in Fig. 9.33(c) where Rin2 is considered to include
ro2,
Rin2 = 25 k ∥1000 k = 24.4 k
We use the formula for Rπ1 given in

Rμ2 = (1 + gm2ro2)(Rin2 ∥Rout1) + ro2

We can determine τH from

2πCS

2πCS
⇒CS = 4.8 µF
Select CS = 5 µF.
Of the two remaining poles, the one caused by
CC2 has associated relatively low-valued
resistances (RD and RL are much lower than RG),
thus to minimize the total capacitance we place
fP3 at 10 Hz and fP1 at 1 Hz. Thus,
10 =

2πCC2(RD + RL)

2πCC2(20 + 10) × 103

fP2 =

fP3 =

Since fP2 ≫fP1 and fP3, we have
fL ≃fP2 = 95.5 Hz
9.95 The amplifier in Fig. P9.95 will have the
equivalent circuit in Fig. 9.41(b) except with
RE = ∞(i.e., omitted). Also, the equivalent
circuits in Fig. 9.42 can be used to determine the
three short-circuit time constants, again with
RE = ∞. Since the amplifier is operating at
IC ≃IE = 100 µA = 0.1 mA and β = 100,

Chapter 9–42
Using the information in Fig. 9.42(a), we
determine τC1 as
τC1 = CC1[(RB ∥rπ) + Rsig]
To make the contribution of CC1 to the
determination of fL equal to 10%, we use
1
τC1
= 0.1ωL = 0.1 × 2πfL
⇒τC1 =
1
0.1 × 2π × 100 = 15.92 ms
Thus,
CC1[(200 ∥25)×103 +20×103] = 15.92×10−3
⇒CC1 = 0.38 µF
Select CC1 = 0.5 µF.
For CC2 we use the information in Fig. 9.42(c) to
determine τC2:
τC2 = CC2(RC + RL)
To make the contribution of CC2 to the
determination of fL equal to 10%, we use
1
τC2
= 0.1ωL = 0.1 × 2πfL
⇒τC2 =
1
0.1 × 2π × 100 = 15.92 ms
Thus,
CC2(20 + 10) × 103 = 15.92 × 10−3
⇒CC2 = 0.53 µF
Although, to be conservative we should select
CC2 = 1 µF; in this case we can select
CC2 = 0.5 µF
because the required value is very close to 0.5 µF
and because we have selected CC1 and CE larger
than the required values. The resulting fL will be

(f) A Bode plot for the gain magnitude is shown

The gain at fP2 (10 Hz) is 12 dB. Since the gain
decreases by 40 dB/decade or equivalently
12 dB/octave, it reaches 0 dB (unity magnitude)
at f = fPC/2 = 5 Hz.

(f)
A = 0.8 × 100 = 80
Af =

which is a 2.44% decrease.

(f)
A = 0.8 × 104
Af =
0.8 × 104
1 + 0.8 × 104 × 0.0009

which is a 2.44% decrease.
Ex. 10.3 To constrain the corresponding change
in Af to 0.1%, we need an amount-of-feedback of
at least
1 + Aβ = 10%
0.1% = 100
Thus the largest obtainable closed-loop gain will
be
Af =
A
1 + Aβ = 1000
100 = 10 V/V
Each amplifier in the cascade will have a nominal
gain of 10 V/V and a maximum variability of
0.1%; thus the overall voltage gain will be
(10)3 = 1000 V/V and the maximum variability
will be 0.3%.

Figure 1
Figure 1 shows the circuit prepared for
determining the loop gain Aβ. Observe that we
have eliminated the input signal Vs, and opened
the loop at the gate of Q where the input
impedance is infinite obviating the need for a
termination resistance at the right-hand side of
the break. Now we need to analyze the circuit to
determine
Aβ ≡−Vr
Vt
First, we write for the gain of the CS amplifier Q,
Vd
Vt
= −gm[RD ∥(R1 + R2)]
(1)
then we use the voltage-divider rule to find Vr,
Vr
Vd
=

R1 + R2
(2)
Combining Eqs. (1) and (2) gives
Aβ ≡−Vr
Vt
= gm[RD ∥(R1 + R2)]

Aβ = gm

1 + 36.36 × 0.2 = 4.4 V/V
If Aβ were ≫1, then
Af ≃1
β = 1
0.2 = 5 V/V
Ex. 10.6 From the solution of Example 10.5,
1 + Aβ = 60.1
Thus,
fHf = (1 + Aβ)fH
= 60.1 × 1
= 60.1 kHz
Ex. 10.7 Refer to Fig. E10.7. The 1-mA bias
current will split equally between the emitters of
Q1 and Q2, thus
IE1 = IE2 = 0.5 mA
Transistor Q3 will be operating at an emitter
current
IE3 = 5 mA
determined by the 5-mA current source. Since the
dc component of Vs = 0, the negative feedback
will force the dc voltage at the output to be
approximately zero.

Comparison with the results of Exercise 10.5
shows that the expressions for A and β are
identical. However, Rin and Rout cannot be
determined using the method of Exercise 10.5.
Ex. 10.9

A = 1000 A/A

Af =

1 + Aβ = 1000
101 = 9.9 A/A
Rif =
Ri
1 + Aβ = 1000 
101
= 9.9 
Rof = Ro(1 + Aβ) = 100 k × 101
= 10.1 M
Ex. 10.10 Refer to the solution of Example 10.7.
If μ is reduced from 1000 V/V to 100 V/V, A will
be reduced by the same factor (10) to become
A = 64.9 mA/V
and the loop gain will be correspondingly
reduced,
Aβ = 64.9
Thus, the amount of feedback becomes
1 + Aβ = 65.9
and the closed-loop gain Af becomes
Af =
A
1 + Aβ = 64.9
65.9 = 0.985 mA/V
The input resistance becomes
Rin = Rif = (1 + Aβ)Ri
= 65.9 × 101 = 6.7 M
The output resistance becomes
Rout = Rof = (1 + Aβ)Ro
= 65.9 × 61 = 4 M
Ex. 10.11 Refer to the solution of Example 10.7.
To double Af

ideal we need to reduce β to half its
value. Since β = RF, the feedback resistance RF
becomes
RF = 500 
Now, since A is given by
A =
Rid
Rid + RF
μ
1
gm + (RF∥ro2)
ro2
RF + ro2
the value of A becomes
A =
100
100 + 0.5
1000
0.5 + (0.5∥20)
20
0.5 + 20
= 982.7 mA/V
Thus, Af becomes
Af =
A
1 + Aβ =
982.7
1 + 982.7 × 0.5
= 1.996 mA/V
Ex. 10.12 To obtain Af

ideal = 100 mA/V, the
feedback factor β must be
β =
1
100 = 0.01 V/mA = 10 
But,
β =
RE1RE2
RE1 + RE2 + RF
For RE1 = RE2 = 100 ,
10 =
100 × 100
100 + 100 + RF
⇒RF = 800 
Since the ideal value of (Io/Vs) is 100 mA/V, the
ideal value of the voltage gain is,
Vo
Vs
= −IoRC
Vs
= −100 × 0.6
= −60 V/V

Exercise 10–9
1 + A0β = 1 + 105 × 0.01 = 1001
The pole will be shifted to a frequency
fPf = fP(1 + A0β)
= 100 × 1001 = 100.1 kHz
If β is changed to a value that results in a nominal
closed-loop gain of 1, then we obtain
β = 1
and
1 + A0β = 1 + 105 × 1 ≃105
then the pole will be shifted to a frequency
fPf = 105 × 100 = 10 MHz
Ex. 10.19 From Eq. (10.40), we see that the
poles coincide when
(ωP1 + ωP2)2 = 4(1 + A0β)ωP1ωP2
(104 + 106)2 = 4(1 + 100β) × 104 × 106
⇒1 + 100β = 25.5
⇒β = 0.245
The corresponding value of Q = 0.5. This can
also be verified by substituting in Eq. (10.42).

β = 0
To simplify matters, we normalize s by the

complex-frequency variable S = s/104, and the
characteristic equation becomes
(S + 1)3 + 103β = 0
(1)
This equation has three roots, a real one and a
pair that can be complex conjugate. The real pole
can be found from

Dividing the characteristic polynomial in (1) by

Exercise 10–10
From this single-pole response (low-pass STC
response) we can find the unity-gain frequency
by inspection as
f1 = fP × 1000
= 104 Hz
The phase angle at f1 will be −90◦and thus the
phase margin is 90◦.
Ex. 10.22 From Eq. (10.48), we obtain
| Af (jω1)|
1/β
= 1/|1 + e−jθ|
= 1/|1 + cos θ −j sin θ|
(a) For PM = 30◦, θ = 180 −30 = 150◦, thus
| Af (jω1)|
1/β
= 1/|1 + cos 150◦−j sin 150◦|
= 1.93
(b) For PM = 60◦, θ = 180 −60 = 120◦, thus
| Af (jω1)|
1/β
= 1/|1 + cos 120◦−j sin 120◦|
= 1
(c) For PM = 90◦, θ = 180 −90 = 90◦, thus

Ex. 10.23 For a phase margin of 45◦,
φ = −135◦. Locating the point φ = −135◦on
the phase plot in Fig. 10.38, we find the
corresponding point on the gain plot at 80 dB,
that is,

Af =
A
1 + Aβ =
105
1 + 105 × 10−4

Ex. 10.24 To obtain stable performance for
closed-loop gains as low as 20 dB (which is 80
dB below A0, or equivalently 104 below A0),
we must place the new dominant pole at
1 MHz/104 = 100 Hz.
Ex. 10.25 The frequency of the first pole must be
lowered from 1 MHz to a new frequency
f ′
D = 10 MHz
104
= 1000 Hz
that is, by a factor of 1000. Thus, the capacitance
at the controlling node must be increased by a
factor of 1000.

For Vs = 1 V, we obtain

Vi = Vs −Vo = 1 −0.999

If A becomes 1000(1 −0.1) = 900 V/V, then we

Af =

1 + 900 × 0.099 = 9.99 V/V
Thus Af changes by −0.11%.
(ii)
A = 0.9 × 100 = 90 V/V
Af =
90
1 + 90 × 0.09 = 9.89 V/V
Thus, Af changes by −1.1%.
(iii)
A = 0.9 × 20 = 18 V/V
Af =
18
1 + 18 × 0.05 = 9.47 V/V
Thus Af changes by −5.3%. We conclude that as
A becomes smaller and hence the amount of
feedback (1 + Aβ) is lower, the desensitivity of
the feedback amplifier to changes in A decreases.
In other words, the negative feedback becomes
less effective as (1 + Aβ) decreases.

Chapter 10–3
If we satisfy condition (1) with equality, we can
determine the required value of β. We must then
check that condition (2) is satisfied. Thus,
500
1 + 500β = 0.99 ×
1000
1 + 1000β
⇒β = 0.098
For this value of β, we obtain
Af, nominal =
1000
1 + 1000 × 0.098
= 10.101
Af, low =
500
1 + 500 × 0.098 = 10
Af, high =
1500
1 + 1500 × 0.098 = 10.135
Thus, the low value of the closed-loop gain is
0.101 below nominal or −1%, and the high value
is 0.034 above nominal or 0.34%. Thus, our
amplifier meets specification and the nominal
value of closed-loop gain is 10.1. This is the
highest possible closed-loop gain that can be
obtained while meeting specification.
Now, if three closed-loop amplifiers are placed in
cascade, the overall gain obtained will be
Nominal Gain = (10.1)3 = 1030
Lowest Gain = 103 = 1000
Highest Gain = (10.135)3 = 1041
Thus, the lowest gain will be approximately 3%
below nominal, and the highest gain will be 1%
above nominal.

dAf /Af

⇒Densensitivity factor ≡1 + Aβ = 50
β = 49
500 = 0.098 V/V
If the A = 1000 amplifiers have a gain
uncertainty of ±10%, the gain uncertainty of the
closed-loop amplifiers will be
= ±10%
100
= ±0.1%
If we require a gain uncertainty of ±0.1% using
the A = 500 amplifiers, then
±0.1% = Gain uncertainty of A = 500 amplifiers

with temperature and time. Correspondingly, Af
varies from (25 −1%) i.e. 24.75 V/V to
(25 + 1%) or 25.25 V/V. Substituting these
quantities into the formula for the closed-loop

and that for the second segment is
Af2 =

Thus, the transfer characteristic of the feedback
amplifier can be described as follows:
For |vS| ≤0.9 V,
vO/vS = 11.1 V/V
For 0.9 V ≤|vS| ≤1.4 V,
vO/vS = 10.1 V/V

The transfer characteristic is shown in the figure

10.17 Let the gain of the ideal (nonvarying)
driver amplifier be denoted μ. Then, the
open-loop gain A will vary from 2μ to 12μ.
Correspondingly, the closed-loop gain will vary
from 95 V/V to 105 V/V. Substituting these
quantities into the closed-loop gain expression,
we obtain

1.105 + 1.105 × 12μβ = 6 + 12μβ

which is about a factor of 10 higher than the gain
required in the less constrained case. The value of

feedback factor β is
β = 3.885
41.66 = 9.33 × 10−2 V/V
which is a factor of 10 higher than the case with
Af = 100.
(b) Finally, for the case Af = 10 ± 0.5% we can
write by analogy
μβ = 41.58
μ = 418.7 V/V
β = 9.93 × 10−2 V/V
10.18 If we use one stage, the amount of
feedback required is
1 + Aβ = A
Af
= 1000
100 = 10
Thus the closed-loop amplifier will have a
variability of
Variability of Af = ±30%
10
= ±3%
which does not meet specifications. Next, we try
using two stages. For a nominal gain of 100, each
stage will be required to have a nominal gain of
10. Thus, for each stage the amount of feedback
required will be
1 + Aβ = 1000
10
= 100
Thus, the closed-loop gain of each stage will have
a variability of
= ±30%
100
= ±0.3%
and the cascade of two stages will thus show a
variability of ±0.6%, well within the required
±1%. Thus two stages will suffice.
We next investigate the design in more detail.
Each stage will have a nominal gain of 10 and
thus
1 + Aβ = 1000
10
= 100
⇒Aβ = 99
⇒β = 0.099
Since A ranges from 700 V/V to 1300 V/V, the
gain of each stage will range from
Af, low =
700
1 + 700 × 0.099 = 9.957 V/V
and a high value of
Af, high =
1300
1 + 1300 × 0.099 = 10.023 V/V
Thus, the cascade of two stages will have a
range of
Lowest gain = 9.9572 = 99.14 V/V
Highest gain = 10.0232 = 100.46 V/V
which is −0.86% to +0.46% of the nominal 100
V/V gain, well within the required ±1%.
10.19 If the nominal open-loop gain is A, then
we require that as A drops to (A/2) the
closed-loop gain drops from 10 to a minimum of
9.8. Substituting these values in the expression
for the closed-loop gain, we obtain
10 =
A
1 + Aβ

Substituting in Eq. (1) gives

and
β = 50 −1
500
= 0.098 V/V
If β is accurate to within ±1%, to ensure that the
minimum closed-loop gain realized is 9.8 V/V,
we have

Aβ = 899
Substituting (1 + Aβ) = 900 into Eq. (1) yields
A = 100 × 900 = 90, 000 V/V
The value of β is
β =
899
90, 000 = 9.989 × 10−3 V/V
If A were increased tenfold, i.e, A = 900, 000, we
obtain
Af = 900, 000
1 + 8990 = 100.1 V/V
If A becomes infinite, we get

Thus,
AMf =
AM
1 + AMβ
ωLf =
ωL
1 + AMβ
Thus, both the midband gain and the 3-dB
frequency are lowered by the amount of
feedback, (1 + AMβ).
10.22 Let’s first try N = 2. The closed-loop gain
of each stage must be
Af =
√
1000 = 31.6 V/V
Thus, the amount-of-feedback in each stage
must be
1 + Aβ = A
Af
= 1000
31.6 = 31.6
The 3-dB frequency of each stage is
f3dB|stage = (1 + Aβ)fH
= 31.6 × 20 = 632 kHz
Thus, the 3-dB frequency of the cascade
amplifier is
f3dB|cascade = 632

21/2 −1 = 406.8 kHz
which is less than the required 1 MHz.
Next, we try N = 3. The closed-loop gain of each
stage is
Af = (1000)1/3 = 10 V/V
and thus each stage will have an
amount-of-feedback
1 + Aβ = 1000
10
= 100
which results in a stage 3-dB frequency of
f3dB|stage = (1 + Aβ)fH
= 100 × 20 = 2000 kHz
= 2 MHz
The 3-dB frequency of the cascade amplifier
will be
f3dB|cascade = 2

21/3 −1
= 1.02 MHz
which exceeds the required value of 1 MHz.
Thus, we need three identical stages, each with a
closed-loop gain of 10 V/V, an
amount-of-feedback of 100, and a loop gain
Aβ = 99
Thus,
β = 0.099 V/V

Similarly, for vI = −0.7 V, we obtain vO = 0 and

100 = −7 mV
Thus, the limits of the deadband are now ±7 mV.
Outside the deadband, the gain of the feedback
amplifier, that is, vO/vS, can be determined by
noting that the open-loop gain A ≡vO/ve =
100 V/V and the feedback factor β = 1, thus

Thus μ must be increased by the factor

431.1 = 2.343 to become
μ = 2343 V/V
10.25 (a) Setting the open–loop gain to ∞, the
voltage Vgs1 reduces to zero and the current in the
source of Q1(Id1) becomes zero. This isolates the
feedback network which is the voltage divider
(RF, RS1). Thus,

resistance is infinite, obviating the need for
adding a termination resistance. Also, observe

10.33 (a) Refer to Fig. P10.33. Assume that for
some reason vS increases. This will increase the
differential input signal (vS −vO) applied to the
differential amplifier. The drain current of Q1 will
increase, and this increase will be mirrored in the
drain current of Q4. The increase in iD4 will cause
the voltage at the gate of Q5 to rise. Since Q5 is
operating as a source follower, the voltage at its
source, vO, will follow and increase. This will
cause the differential input signal (vS −vO) to
decrease, thus counteracting the originally

The value of Af (10.5 V/V) is 0.45 less than the
ideal value of 11, which is about 4%.
10.35 (a) Refer to Fig. P10.35. Let Vs increase
by a small increment. Since Q1 is operating in
effect as a CS amplifier, a negative incremental
voltage will appear at its drain. Transistor Q2 is
also operating as a CS amplifier; thus a positive
incremental voltage will appear at its drain.
Transistor Q3 is operating as a source follower;
thus the signal at its source (which is the output
voltage) will follow that at its gate and thus will
be positive. The end result is that we are feeding
back through the voltage divider (R2, R1) a
positive incremental signal that will appear across
R1 and thus at the source of the Q1. This signal,
being of the same polarity as the originally
assumed change in the signal at the gate of
Q1(Vs), will subtract from the original change,
causing a smaller signal to appear across the
gate-source terminals of Q1. Hence, the feedback
is negative.
(b) Setting the open-loop gain to ∞, the voltage
Vgs1 reduces to zero, which in turn causes the
current in the source of Q1 to be zero. Thus the
feedback voltage across R1 is simply determined
by the voltage divider ratio of (R1, R2), thus
β =
R1
R1 + R2
β =

If the loop gain is large, the closed-loop gain
approaches the ideal value

Thus,
Af

(c) VG1 = 0.9 V
VS1 = VG1 −VGS1
= VG1 −Vt1 −VOV1
= 0.9 −0.5 −0.2 = 0.2 V
VG2 = VDD −VSG2
= VDD −|Vt2| −|VOV2|
= 1.80 −0.5 −0.2 = 1.1 V
Thus, current source I1 will have 0.7-V drop
across it, more than sufficient for its proper
operation. Since VS1 = 0.2 V the dc current
through R1 will be
IR1 = VS1
R1
= 0.2 V
2 k = 0.1 mA
Now, a node equation at S1 reveals that because
ID1 = 0.1 mA and IR1 = 0.1 mA, the dc current in
R2 will be zero. Thus, it will have a zero voltage
drop across it and
VS3 = VS1 = 0.2 V
Thus, current source I3 will have across it the
minimum voltage required to keep it operating
properly. Finally,
VG3 = VS3 + VGS3
= VS3 + Vt3 + VOV3
= 0.2 + 0.5 + 0.2 = 0.9 V
Thus, current source I2 will have across it a
voltage more than sufficient to keep it operating
properly.

Refer to the A circuit.
Transistor Q1 is a CS amplifier with a resistance
R11 in its source:
Rs = R11 = R1 ∥R2 = 2 ∥18 = 1.8 k
Transistor Q1 will have an effective
transconductance:
Gm1 =
gm1
1 + gmRs
=
1
1 + 1 × 1.8 = 0.36 mA/V
The output resistance of Q1 will be
Ro1 = (1 + gm1Rs)ro1
= (1 + 1 × 1.8) × 100 = 280 k
The total resistance at the drain of Q1 is
Rd1 = rocs1 ∥Ro1
= 100 ∥280 = 73.7 k
Thus, the voltage gain of the first stage is
A1 = −Gm1Rd1
= −0.36 × 73.7 = −26.5 V/V
The gain of the second stage is
A2 = −gm2(rocs2 ∥ro2)
= −1(100 ∥100) = −50 V/V
To determine the gain of the third stage, we first
determine the total resistance between the source
of Q3 and ground:
Rs3 = rocs3 ∥ro3 ∥(R1 + R2)
Rs3 = 100 ∥100 ∥20
= 14.3 k
Thus,
A3 =
Rs3
Rs3 + 1
gm3
=
14.3
14.3 + 1
1
= 0.935 V/V
The overall voltage gain A can now be found as
A = A1A2A3
= −26.5 × −50 × 0.935 = 1240 V/V
(e) We already found β in (b) as
β = 0.1 V/V
(f) 1 + Aβ = 1 + 1240 × 0.1 = 125
Af =
A
1 + Aβ = 1240
125 = 9.92 V/V
which is lower by 0.08 or 0.8% than the ideal
value obtained in (b).

Ro
1 + Aβ
To obtain Ro refer to the output part of the A
circuit.
Ro = (R1 + R2) ∥rocs3 ∥ro3 ∥

gm3
= 20 ∥100 ∥100 ∥1
= 935 
Rof = 935
125 = 7.5 
Note: This problem, though long, is extremely
valuable as it exercises the student’s knowledge
in many aspects of amplifier design.
10.36 (a) Refer to Fig. P10.26. Let Vs increase
by a positive increment. This will cause the drain
current of Q1 to increase. The increase in Id1 will
be fed to the Q3 −Q4 mirror, which will provide
a corresponding increase in the drain current of
Q4. The latter current will cause the voltage at the
output node to rise. A fraction of the increase in
Vo is applied through the divider (R1, R2) to the
gate of Q2. The increase in the voltage of the gate
of Q2 will subtract from the initially assumed
increase of the voltage of the gate of Q1, resulting
in a smaller increase in the differential voltage
applied to the (Q1, Q2) pair. Thus, the feedback
counteracts the originally assumed change,
verifying that it is negative.

(b) The negative feedback will cause the dc
voltage at the gate of Q2 to be approximately
equal to the dc voltage at the gate of Q1, that is,
zero. Now, with VG2 ≃0, the dc current in R2
will be zero and similarly the dc current in R1 will
be zero, resulting in VO = 0 V dc.
(c) Figure 1 shows the A circuit. It also shows
how the loading effect of the β network on the A
circuit, namely R11 and R22, are found. The gain

A = gm1,2(ro2 ∥ro4 ∥R22 ∥RL)

the output of A1 will decrease and this will cause
the output of A2 to increase. This, in turn, causes
the output of A3, which is Vo, to increase. A
portion of the positive increment in Vo is fed back
to the positive input terminal of A1 through the
voltage divider (R2, R1), The increased voltage at
the positive input terminal of A1 counteracts the
originally assumed increase at the negative input
terminal, verifying that the feedback is negative.

(a) Setting A = ∞results in the voltage between
the two input terminals of the amplifier μ being
zero. Thus the current into these two terminals
also become zero. As a result, the voltage across
RF equals Vs and the current through RF; namely
Vs/RF flows into the source terminal of Q. Thus

which gives the required value of RM as
RM = 0.205 k = 205 
This value is about 25% lower than the value that
results in an ideal Af of −5 V/V. This is because
of the limited amount of loop gain available here.

10.50 (a) Refer to Fig. P10.50. With A set to ∞,
the voltage between the two input terminals of

of the feedback amplifier. Observe that the
resistance RF senses the output current Io and
provides a voltage IoRF that is subtracted from Vs.
Thus the feedback network is composed of the
resistance RF, as shown in Fig. 2. Because the
feedback is of the series-series type, the loading

10.56 Figure 1 on the next page shows the
equivalent circuit with Vs = 0 and a voltage Vx
applied to the collector for the purpose of
determining the output resistance Ro,
Ro ≡Vx
Ix
Some of the analysis is displayed on the circuit
diagram. Since the current entering the emitter
node is equal to Ix, we can write for the emitter
voltage
Ve = Ix[Re ∥(rπ + Rb)]
(1)
The base current can be obtained using the
current-divider rule applied to Re and (rπ + Rb) as
Ib = −Ix
Re
Re + rπ + Rb
(2)
The voltage from collector to ground is equal to
Vx and can be expressed as the sum of the voltage
drop across ro and Ve,
Vx = (Ix −βIb)ro + Ve
Substituting for Ve from (1) and for Ib from (2),
we obtain
Ro = Vx

Q.E.D.
For Rb = 0,
Ro = ro + (Re ∥rπ)(1 + gmro)
The maximum value of Ro will be obtained when
Re ≫rπ. If Re approaches infinity (zero signal
current in the emitter), Ro approaches the
theoretical maximum:
Romax = ro + rπ(1 + gmro)
= ro + rπ + βro

The situation that pertains in the circuit when
Re = ∞is illustrated in Fig. 2. Observe that since
the signal current in the emitter is zero, the base
current will be equal to the collector current (Ix)
and in the direction indicated. The
controlled-source current will be βIx, and this
current adds to Ix to provide a current (β + 1)Ix in
the output resistance ro. A loop equation takes the
form
Vx = (β + 1)Ixro + Ixrπ
and thus
Ro ≡Vx
Ix
= rπ + (β + 1)ro
which is identical to the result in Eq. (3).
10.57
Figure 1 shows the situation that pertains in the
transistor when μ is so large that Vb ≃0 and
Ie ≃0. Observe that
Ib = −Ix
Writing a loop equation for the C-E-B, we obtain
Vx = (Ix −βIb)ro −Ibrπ
Substituting Ib = −Ix, we obtain

Thus, for large amounts of feedback, Rout is

independent of the amount of feedback. This
phenomenon does not occur in MOSFET circuits
where hfe = ∞.

which is larger than the value found in Problem
10.63 (155.15) by about 2.5%. This small
difference is a result of the approximations
involved in the general method. The more
accurate result for Aβ is the one obtained here.
However, the loop-gain method does not make it
possible to determine the input and output
resistances of the feedback amplifier.

setting the open-loop gain to ∞, the input voltage
Vg1 becomes zero and thus the currents in R1 and

10.70 (a) Converting the signal source to its
Norton’s form, we obtain the circuit shown in
Fig. 1(a) on the next page.
This is a shunt–shunt feedback amplifier with the
feedback network consisting of the resistor Rf . To
determine β, we use the arrangement shown in
Fig. 1(b) on the next page,
β = −1
Rf
Now, for Aβ ≫1, the closed-loop gain becomes
Af ≡Vo

The voltage gain Vo

For Rs = 10 k, we obtain
Rf = 1 M
Now consider the amplifier stage shown in Fig.
P10.70(b). First, we determine the dc bias point
as follows:

10 + 15 −0.7

Rin = 10 ∥15 ∥2.27 = 1.65 k
Rout = 7.5 k
Avo = −gm × 7.5 k
= −44 × 7.5 = −330 V/V
Figure 2(a) on the next page shows the equivalent
circuit of the amplifier stage. Figure 2(b) shows
the A circuit of the feedback amplifier made up of
the cascade of three stages. Observe that we have
included Rs and RL as well as R11 and R22. The
overall gain A ≡Vo/Is cam be obtained as
follows:
Ri = Rs ∥RF ∥1.65 k
= 10 ∥1000 ∥1.65 = 1.414 k
V1 = IiRi = 1.414Ii
(1)
V2 = −330V1 ×
1.65
1.65 + 7.5 = −59.5V1
(2)

(3)
Vo = −330V3 ×

(1 ∥1000) + 7.5

(4)
Combining (1)–(4) gives

Since

which is slightly lower than the value found in
Example 10.10 (1076.4), the difference being
about −10%. This is a result of the assumptions
and approximations made in the general feedback
analysis method.
From Example 10.10 (or directly from the β
circuit) we have
β = −0.1 A/A
Thus,
A = −9709

slightly for the earlier results, Af is identical; an
illustration of the power of negative feedback!
10.76 (a) If μ is a very large, a virtual ground
will appear at the input terminal. Thus the input
resistance Rin = V−/Ii = 0. Since no current
flows in Rs, or into the amplifier input terminal,
all the current Is will flow in the transistor source
terminal and hence into the drain, thus
Io = Is

Figure 4 shows the circuit of the cascode
amplifier in Fig. P10.76 with VG replaced by
signal ground, and Q1 replaced by its equivalent
circuit at the drain. This circuit looks identical to
that of Fig. P10.76(a). Thus we can write
Io ≃gm1vi
Rout = ro2(1 + μgm2ro1) = ro2 + μ(gm2ro2)ro1
≃μ(gm2ro2)ro1
Compared to the case of a regular cascode, we
see that while Io ≃gm1Vi as in the regular
cascode, utilizing the "super" CG transistor
results in increasing the output resistance by the
additional factor μ!
10.77 (a) Refer to Fig. P10.77. Let Is increase.
This will cause the voltage at the input node,
which is the voltage at the positive input of the
amplifier μ, to increase. The amplifier output
voltage will correspondingly increase. Thus, Vgs
of Q1 increases and Io1 increases. This
counteracts the originally assumed change of
increased current into the input node. Thus, the
feedback is negative.
(b) The negative feedback will cause the dc
voltage at the positive input terminal of the
amplifier to be equal to VBIAS. Thus, the voltage
at the drain of Q1 will be equal to VBIAS. For Q1 to
operate in the active mode, the minimum voltage
at the drain must be equal to VOV which is 0.2 V.
Thus the minimum value of VBIAS must be
0.2 V.

Figure 1 shows the circuit for determining Rin,
Rin ≡Vx

A node equation at D1 gives
Vx = (Ix −gm1Vgs)ro1

Vgs = μVx,
thus
Vx = Ixro1 −μgm1ro1Vx

Since μgm1ro1 ≫1, we have

10.79 (a) Refer to the circuit in Fig. P10.79.
Observe that the feedback signal is capacitively
coupled and so are the signal source and RL; thus,
these do not enter into the dc bias calculations
and the feedback does not affect the bias. The dc
emitter current in Q1 can be determined from

To simplify matters, let s

(1)
This equation has three roots, which are the poles
of the feedback amplifier. One of the roots will be
real and the other two can be complex conjugate
depending on the value of K. The real pole can be
directly obtained from Eq. (1) as
(1 + S1)3 = −K3
(1 + S1) = −K
S1 = −(1 + K)
(2)
Now we need to obtain the two other poles. The
characteristic equation in (1) can be written as
S3 + 3 S2 + 3 S + (1 + K3) = 0
(3)
Equivalently it can be written as
(S + 1 + K)(S2 + aS + b) = 0
(4)
Equating the coefficients of corresponding terms
in (3) and (4), we can find a and b and thus obtain
the quadratic factor
S2 + (2 −K)S + (1 −K + K2) = 0

Figure 1
Figure 1 shows a sketch of the Bode plot for
| Aβ|. Observe that the unity-gain frequency will
occur on the −40 dB/decade line. The value of f1
can be obtained from the Bode plot as follows:
The −40 dB/decade line represents gain drop
proportional to 1/f 2. For a drop by only 20 dB (a
factor of 10) the change in frequency is by a
factor
√
10, thus
f1 =
√
10 × 103 Hz = 3.16 × 103 Hz
However, the Bode plot results are usually
approximate. If we require a more exact value for
f1 we need to iterate a couple of times using the
exact equation in (2). The result is
f1 = 3.085 × 103 Hz
The phase angle can now be obtained using (1) as
follows:
φ = −tan−1
ω1
2π × 10 −tan−1
ω1
2π × 103
= −tan−1 f1
10 −tan−1 f1
103
= −tan−1(3.085 × 102) −tan−1(3.085)
= −89.81◦−72.03◦= −161.84
Thus,
Phase margin = 180◦−161.84 = 18.15◦
To obtain a phase margin of 45◦:
The phase shift due to the first pole will be ≃90◦.
Thus, the phase shift due to the second pole must
be ≃−45◦, thus
−45◦= −tan−1 f1
103
f1 ≃103 rad/s.
Since f1 is two decades above fP we need A0β to
be 100. Thus, β will now be
β = 100/105 = 10−3
Figure 2 shows a sketch of the Bode plot for | Aβ|
in this case. The closed-loop gain is 60 dB.

Figure 1
For a unity-gain buffer, β = 1, thus
A0β = 105 and fP = 10 Hz
Since the loop gain rolls off at a uniform slope of
−20 dB/decade, it will reach the 0 dB line
(| Aβ| = 1) five decades beyond 10 Hz. Thus the
unity-gain frequency will be
f1 = 105 × 10 = 106 Hz = 1 MHz
The phase shift will be that resulting from a
single pole, −90◦, resulting in a phase margin:
Phase margin = 180◦−90◦= 90◦
10.93 Figure 1 is a replica of Fig. 10.38 except
here we locate on the phase plot the points at
which the phase margin is 90◦and 135◦,
respectively. Drawing a vertical line from each of
those points and locating the intersection with the
| A| line enables us to determine the maximum β
that can be used in each case. Thus, for
PM = 90◦, we have

A horizontal line at the 60-dB level will intersect
the vertical line at fP2 = 106 Hz at a point Z1.
Drawing a line with a slope of −20 dB/decade
from Z1 will intersect the 100-dB horizontal line
at a frequency two decade lower than fP2, thus the

frequency ω′
P2 higher than ωP3. Thus the gain of
the compensated amplifier will fall off, starting at
ω′
P1, with a uniform slope of −20 dB/decade until
it reaches 0 dB at the second pole, which is now
that with frequency ωP3. The frequency of the

which indeed is higher than ωP3.
10.97 The new pole must be placed at
fD = 1 MHz
104
= 100 Hz
In this way the modified open-loop gain will
decrease at the uniform rate of −20 dB/decade,
thus reaching 0 dB in four decades, that is at 1
MHz where the original pole exists. At 1 MHz,
the slope changes to −40 dB/decade, but our
amplifier will be guaranteed to be stable with a
closed-loop gain at low as unity.
10.98 We must move the 1 MHz pole to a new
location,
fD = 20 MHz
104
= 2 kHz
This reduction in frequency by a factor of
1 MHz
2 kHz = 500 will require that the total
capacitance at the controlling node must become

Thus, IC = 0.4 × 2 × 5 = 4 mA
Ex: 11.8 Refer to Fig. 11.14.
(a) To obtain a terminal voltage of 1.2 V, and

IC1 = 1 × e−0.1/0.025 = 0.018 mA
I = 0.43 mA
Ex: 11.9 (a) From symmetry we see that all
transistors will conduct equal currents and have
equal VBE’s. Thus,
vO = 0 V
If VBE ≃0.7 V, then
VE1 = 0.7 V and I1 = 15 −0.7

If we neglect IB3, then

Exercise 11–5
Thus, VE1 = +10.6 V and I1 = 0.88 mA. No
further iterations are required and IC1 ≃0.88 mA.
To find IC2, we use an identical procedure:
VBE2 ≃0.7 V
VE2 = 10 −0.7 = +9.3 V
I2 = 9.3 −(−15)
5
= 4.86 mA
VBE2 = 0.025 ln
4.86 × 10−3


= 0.643 V
VE2 = 10 −0.643 = +9.357
I2 = 4.87 mA
IC2 ≃4.87 mA
Finally,
IC3 = IC4 = 3.3 × 10−14 eVBE/VT
where
VBE = VE1 −VE2
2
= 0.62 V
Thus, IC3 = IC4 = 1.95 mA
The symmetry of the circuit enables us to find the
values for vI = −10 V as follows:
IC1 = 4.87 mA IC2 = 0.88 mA
IC3 = IC4 = 1.95 mA
For vI = +10 V, we have vO = VE1 −VBE3
= 10.6 −0.62 = +9.98 V
For vI = −10 V, we have vO = VE1 −VBE3
= −9.357 −0.62 = −9.98 V
(c) For vI = +10 V, we have
vO ≃10 V
IL ≃100 mA
IC3 ≃100 mA
IB3 = 100
201 ≃0.5 mA
Assuming that |VBE1| has not changed much from
0.6 V, then
VE1 ≃10.6 V
I1 = 15 −10.6
5
= 0.88 mA
IE1 = I1 −IB3 = 0.88 −0.5 = 0.38 mA
IC1 ≃0.38 mA

Thus, IC1 ≃0.38 mA
Now for Q2 we have
VBE2 = 0.643 V
VE2 = 10 −0.643 = 9.357
I2 = 4.87 mA
IB4 ≃0
IC2 ≃4.87 mA (as in (b))
Assuming that IC3 ≃100 mA, we have
VBE3 = 0.025 ln
 100 × 10−3
3.3 × 10−14

= 0.72 V
Thus, vO = VE1 −VBE3
= 10.58 −0.72 = +9.86 V
|VBE4| = vO −VE2
9.86 −9.36 = 0.5 V
Thus, IC4 = 3.3 × 10−14e0.5/0.025
≃0.02 mA
From symmetry we find the values for the case
vI = −10 V as:
IC1 = 4.87 mA,
IC2 = 0.38 mA
IC3 = 0.02 mA,
IC4 = 100 mA
vO = −9.86 V

Lower limit on vO = −IRL = −9.3 × 1

Corresponding input = −9.3 + 0.7 = −8.6 V
If the EBJ area of Q3 is twice as large as that of
Q2, then
I = 1
2 × 9.3 = 4.65 mA
There will be no change in vOmax and in the
corresponding value of vI. However, vOmin will
now become
vOmin = −IRL
= −4.65 × 1 = −4.65 V
and the corresponding value of vI will be
vI = −4.65 + 0.7 = −3.95 V
If the EBJ area of Q3 is made half as big as that of
Q2, then
I = 2 × 9.3 = 18.6 mA
There will be no change in vOmax and in the
corresponding value of vI. However, vOmin will
now become
vOmin = −VCC + VCEsat
= −10 + 0.3 = −9.7 V
and the corresponding value of vI will be
vI = −9.7 + 0.7 = −9 V
11.2 Refer to Fig. 11.3. For a load resistance of
100  and vO ranging between –5 V and +5 V,
the maximum current through Q1 is
I + 5
0.1 = I + 50, mA and the minimum current
is I −5
0.1 = I −50, mA.
For a current ratio of 15, we have
I + 50
I −50 = 15
⇒I = 57.1 mA
R =

57.1 mA = 163 
The incremental voltage gain is Av =

For RL = 100 ;
At vO = +5 V, iE1 = 57.1 + 50 = 107.1 mA

Av =

The upper limit on vO is determined by Q1
leaving the saturation region (and entering the

by Vt volts:
vImax = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3 V
To obtain the corresponding value of vO, we must
find the corresponding value of VGS1, as follows:

iL = 3 −VGS1

The lower limit of vO is determined either by Q1
cutting off,
vO = −IRL = −1.6 × 1 = −1.6 V
or by Q2 leaving saturation,
vO = −VDD + VOV2
where
VOV2 = VGS2 −Vt = 0.9 −0.5 = 0.4 V

Chapter 11–3
Thus,
vO = −2.5 + 0.4 = −2.1 V
We observe that Q1 will cut off before Q2 leaves
saturation, thus
vOmin = −1.6 V
and the corresponding value of vI will be
vImin = vOmin + Vt
= −1.6 + 0.5 = −1.1 V
11.6 Refer to Fig. 11.3. With VCC = +5 V, the
upper limit on vo is 4.7 V, which is greater than
the required value of +3 V. To obtain a lower
limit of −3 V, we select I so that
IRL = 3
⇒I = 3 mA
Since we are provided with four devices, we can
minimize the total supply current by paralleling
two devices to form Q2 as shown below.

The resulting supply current will be 3 × I
2 rather
than 2I which is the value obtained in the circuit
of Fig. 12.2. Then the supply current is 4.5 mA.
The value of R is found from
R = 4.3 V
1.5 mA = 2.87 k
In a practical design we would select a standard
value for R that results in I somewhat larger than
3 mA. Say, R = 2.7 k. In this case I = 3.2 mA.
Power from negative supply = 3 × 1.6 × 5

equal to VCC. Thus, since Q2 conducts a constant

Similarly, for vI sufficiently negative so that QP

equivalent circuit of the class AB circuit in Fig.

with its hybrid-π model, and the small resistances
of the diodes have been neglected. As well, we
have not included ro of each of QN and QP.

Chapter 11–11
The circuit in Fig. 1(a) can be simplified to that in
Fig. 1(b) where
rπ = rπN ∥rπP
(1)
gm = gmN + gmP
(2)
Since gm ≃1
re
, then from (2) we obtain
1
re
= 1
reN
+ 1
reP
or, equivalently,
re = reN ∥reP
(3)
We observe that the circuit in Fig. 1(b) is the
equivalent circuit of an emitter follower with the
small-signal parameters rπ, gm, and re given in
Eqs. (1), (2), and (3). Furthermore, its β is given
by
β = gmrπ = (gmN + gmP)(rπN ∥rπP)
(4)
For the circuit in Fig. 1(b), we can write
vi = vπ + vo

vo =

Q.E.D.

11.31 Refer to Fig. P11.31. Neglecting the small
resistances of D1 and D2, we can write for the
voltage gain of the CE amplifier transistor Q3,
vc3
vi
= −gm3Rin
(1)
where Rin is the input resistance of the class AB
circuit, given in the statement of Problem 11.30
as
Rin ≃β[RL + (reN ∥reP)]
(2)
where
β = (gmN + gmP)(rπN ∥rπP)
(3)
The voltage gain of the class AB circuit is given
in the statement of Problem 11.30 as
vo
vc3

RL
RL + (reN ∥reP)
(4)
Now, we can combine (1), (2), and (4) to obtain
the voltage gain of the circuit in Fig. P11.31 as
vo
vi
= −gm3β[RL + (reN ∥reP)]
RL
RL + (reN ∥reP)
⇒vo
vi

where β is given by Eq. (3).
11.32 The total resistance in the base circuit
(while neglecting the small resistances of D1 and
D2) is RBIAS ∥ro3. Thus, utilizing the equivalent
emitter follower for the class AB stage, we obtain
for the output resistance
Rout = re + (RBIAS ∥ro3)
β + 1
where
re = reN ∥reP
and
β = (gmN + gmP)(rπN ∥rπP)
11.33 At 20◦C, IQ = 1mA = ISe(0.6/0.025)
⇒IS (at 20◦C) = 3.78 × 10−11 mA
At 70◦C, IS = 3.78 × 10−11(1.14)50
= 2.64 × 10−8 mA
At 70◦C, VT = 25273 + 70
273 + 20 = 29.3 mV
Thus, IQ (at 70◦C) = 2.64 × 10−8e0.6/0.0293

Additional power = 2 × 20×19.7 =788 mW
Additional temperature rise = 10 × 0.788

At 77.9◦C:
VT = 25
293 (273 + 77.9) = 29.9 mV
IQ = 3.78 × 10−11 × (1.14)57.9e(0.6/0.0299)

etc., etc.
11.34 (a) VBE = 0.7 V at 1 mA
At 0.5 mA,
VBE = 0.7 + 0.025 ln0.5
1 = 0.683 V
Thus, R1 = 0.683
0.5
= 1.365 k
and R2 = 1.365 k
VBB = 2VBE = 1.365 V
(b) For Ibias = 2 mA, IC increases to nearly 1.5
mA for which
VBE = 0.7 + 0.025 ln1.5
1 = 0.710 V
Note that IR = 0.710
1.365 = 0.52 mA is very nearly
equal to the assumed value of 0.50 mA, thus no
further iterations are required.
VBB = 2VBE = 1.420 V
(c) For Ibias = 10 mA, assume that IR remains
constant at 0.5 mA, thus IC1 = 9.5 mA
and VBE = 0.7 + 0.025 ln9.5
1 = 0.756 V
at which
IR = 0.755
1.365 = 0.554 mA
Thus,
IC1 = 10 −0.554 = 9.45 mA
and VBE = 0.7 + 0.025 ln9.45
1
= 0.756 V
Thus, VBB = 2 × 0.756 = 1.512 V
(d) Now for β = 100,
IR1 = 0.756
1.365 = 0.554 mA
IR2 = 0.554 + 9.45
101 = 0.648 mA
IC = 10 −0.648 = 9.352 mA
Thus, VBE = 0.7 + 0.025 ln9.352
1
= 0.756 V
VBB = 0.756 + IR2R2
= 0.756 + 0.648 × 1.365
= 1.641 V
11.35 Figure 1 on the next page shows the VBE
multiplier together with its small-signal
equivalent circuit prepared for determining the
incremental terminal resistance r,

Now,
ix = gmvπ +
vπ
R1 ∥rπ
(1)
vx = vπ +

Dividing (2) by (1) gives
r = 1 + R2/(R1 ∥rπ)
gm +
1
R1 ∥rπ
= R2 + (R1 ∥rπ)
1 + gm(R1 ∥rπ)
For R1 = R2 = 1.2 k, IC = 1 mA, and β = 100,
we have
gm = 40 mA/V
rπ = 100
40 = 2.5 k
Thus,
r = 1.2 + (1.2 ∥2.5)
1 + 40(1.2 ∥2.5) = 60.2 
11.36
At vI = 5 V, we have
VE1 = +5.7 V
IR1 = VCC −VE1
R1
= 10 −5.7
R1
= 4.3
R1
To allow for IB3 = 10 mA if needed while
reducing IE1 by no more than half, then IR1 must
be 2 × 10 = 20 mA. Thus,
R1 = VR1
IR1
= 4.3
20 = 0.215 k = 215 
Similarly,
R2 = 0.215 k = 215 
Next, we determine the values of R3 and R4: At
vI = 0, assume VEB1 = 0.7. Then
VE1 = 0.7 V

vO = iLRL

Let’s check that iE4 is zero. The voltage at the
base of Q4 is
VB4 = 1 −VBE2
≃1 −0.74 = 0.26 V
The voltage across R4 and VEB4 is

which is sufficiently small to keep Q4 cut off,
verifying our assumption that iE4 ≃0.

2 µA = 932 k
R1 = 0.600
2 µA = 300 k
R2 = 932 −300 = 632 k
Now find vI for vO = 10 V and RL = 1 k.
Q2 is conducting most of the current and Q4
conducting a negligible current.
∴IC2 ≃IL = 10 V
1 k = 10 mA
∴The current through each of Q1 and Q2
increases by a factor of 10
2 = 5
Thus VBE2 = 0.66 + 0.025ln5 = 0.700 V
VBE1 = 0.602 + 0.025ln5 = 0.642 V
and IB1 = 5 × 0.2 µA = 1 µA
∴The current through the multiplier is
IBias −1 = 20 −1 = 19 µA. Assuming most of
the decrease occurs in IC5, we obtain
∴IC5 = 18 −1 = 17 µA
VBE5 = 0.7 + 0.025 ln
17 µA
1 µA

= 0.598 V
∴VBB1, the voltage across the multiplier is
VBB = 0.598 × 932
300 = 1.858 V
It follows that VEB3 becomes
VEB3 = 1.858 – 0.700 – 0.642 = 0.516 V
i.e. VEB3 has decreased by 0.600 – 0.516 = 0.084
V
Correspondingly, IC3 will decrease by a factor of
e
−0.084
0.025 = 0.035.
∴IC4 becomes 0.035 × 2 = 0.07 mA
This value is close to zero, no iteration required.
∴vI = 10 + 0.7 + 0.642 −1.858
vI = 9.484 V
Now find vI for vO = –10 V and RL =1 k.
iL = −10
1 k = −10 mA
Assume that current through Q2 is almost zero.
∴IC4 ≃10 mA
The current through Q4 increases by a factor of 5
(relative to the quiescent value).
∴The current through Q3 must also
increase by the same factor. Thus
|VBE3| = 0.602 + 0.025 ln5 = 0.642 V
|VBE3| has increased by 0.642 −0.602 = 0.04 V.
Since Q1 and Q2 are almost cut off, all of the IBias
now flows through the VBE multiplier. That is an
increase of 0.2 µ. Assuming that most of the
increase occurs in IC5, VBE5 becomes
VBE5 = 0.7 + 0.025 ln
18.2 µA
1 mA

≃0.600 V
The voltage VBE5 remains almost constant, and
the voltage across the multiplier will remain
almost constant. Thus the increase in |VEB3| will
result in an equal decrease in |VBE1| + |VBE2|, i.e.
VBE1 + VBE2 = 0.660 + 0.602 −0.04
The current through each of Q1 and Q2 decreases
by the same factor, let it be m; then
0.025 ln m + 0.025 ln m = −0.04 V
⇒m = 0.45
Thus IC2 = 0.45 × 2 = 0.9 mA
Now do iteration
IC4 = 10.9
IC4 has increased by a factor of 10.9
2
= 5.45
∴|VBE3| = 0.602 + 0.025 ln 5.45
= 0.644
vI = vO + |VEB3|

of Q3 is (VCC1 −VD). For Q3 to turn on, the
voltage at its base must be at least equal to
VCC1 = 35 V. This will occur when vI reaches the
value
vI = VCC1 −VZ1 −VBB
= 35 −3.3 −1.2 = 30.5 V
This is the positive threshold at which Q3 is
turned on.

Because QN and QP are matched, a similar
situation pertains when QP is supplying
maximum current, and
vOmax = +2.05 V
Thus, the output voltage swing realized is

Similarly, Eq. (2) shows that QN turns off and
iDN = 0 when

substituting this into Eq. (1) gives
iDP = IQ(1 + 1)2 = 4IQ

(d) In the quiescent state the dc voltage at the
output of each amplifier must be of the value that
causes the current in QN and QP to be IQ. Thus,
for the QP amplifier the output voltage is
VDD −VSG = VDD −|Vtp| −|VOV|
= 2.5 −0.5 −0.15 = 1.85 V
Similarly, the voltage at the output of the QN
amplifier must be
−VSS + VGS = −2.5 + 0.5 + 0.15
= −1.85 V
(e) QP will be supplying all the load current
when QN cuts off. From Eq. (11.47) we see that
QN cuts off when
μvO −vI
VOV

Substituting this in Eq. (12.46), we find the
current iDP to be
iDP = IQ(1 + 1)2 = 4IQ
Since in this situation

The collector current in Q2 is approximately
constant at 200 mA. The maximum
collector-emitter voltage arises at vO = +5 V.
vCE2max = +5 V −(−10 V) = 15 V
Thus, we must specify the transistors to handle
the maximum current of Q1, with a factor-of-2
safety margin,
ICmax = 2 × 300 = 600 mA
and we must specify the breakdown voltage to be
more than the maximum collector-emitter voltage
of either Q1 or Q2, with a factor-of-2 safety
margin.

VICMmin = −VSS + Vtn + VOV3 −|Vtp|

The total gain is

ID6

Ro = ro6 ∥ro7 = 25 ∥30 = 13.6 k
Ex: 12.3 The feedback is of the voltage sampling
type (i.e., the connection at the output is a shunt
one), thus
Rout = Rof =
Ro
1 + Aβ
where
Ro = ro6 ∥ro7
A = gm1(ro2 ∥ro4)gm6(ro6 ∥ro7)
β = 1
Thus,
Rout =
ro6 ∥ro7

Usually,
A ≫1
Thus,
Rout ≃

Phase margin = 180◦−(90◦+ 17.5◦) = 72.5◦
(e) To obtain a phase margin of 85◦, we need the

12.8 If the phase margin is 80◦, the phase due to
the second pole fP2 at the unity gain frequency ft
must be 10◦. Thus,
tan−1 ft
fP2

Since ft = 1 MHz,
fP2 = 1 MHz
tan10◦= 5.67 MHz
12.9 For a phase margin of 85◦with a closed
loop gain of 100, the phase at f1 due to the pole at
5 MHz must be at most 5◦; thus,

⇒fD = 180 Hz
To find the required value of CC, we use the

This is the maximum value that C2 can have; if

Thus ft is lower than fP2 and fZ.

decreased by 1/5. To maintain the same phase
margin,

The compensation capacitance must increase,

Thus,
ft =

= 15.92 MHz
Phase due to the two nondominant poles at ft
= −2 tan−1
15.92
50

= −35.3◦
Thus,
Phase margin = 90 −35.3 = 54.7◦
To increase the phase margin to 75◦, the phase
due to the two nondominant poles must be
reduced to 90 −75 = 15◦, i.e. each should
contribute 7.5◦, thus we must reduce ft to the
value obtained as follows:
tan−1

ft
50 MHz

= 7.5◦
ft = 50 × tan7.5◦= 6.58 MHz
This is achieved by increasing CL,
6.58 × 106 = 1 × 10−3

12.32 Refer to Fig. 12.9. When Vid is sufficiently
large to cause Q1 to cut off and Q2 to conduct all
of I, Q3 will carry a current IB. However, Q4 will
carry (IB −I). The current IB in Q3 will be
mirrored in the drain of Q6. Thus, at the output
node the current available to charge CL will be
IO = IB −(IB −I) = I
and the slew rate becomes
SR = I

The introduction of RS slightly reduces the
dominant pole frequency to 1/(Ro + RS)CL, and
thus also reduces the unity-gain frequency, ωt,
and slightly increases phase margin.
Much more important, connecting the feedback
network to Vf instead of Vo introduces a
left-half-plane zero at −1/RSCL, which has a
phase lead and thus adds to the phase margin
tan−1(ωtRSCL).

12.35 Figure 1 above shows a folded-cascode
single-stage op amp circuit that is complementary
to that in Fig. 12.10.
12.36 (a) Figure 1 on the next page shows the dc
bias currents of all transistors as well as the
various dc node voltages. Since Q12 and Q13 have
VG = +0.4 V and VS = +0.85 V, both will be cut
off.
(b) Figure 2 on the next page shows the currents
and voltages during slewing. We assume that
Vid is sufficiently large to steer I = 320 µA into
Q1 and turn Q2 off. Now, at the drain of Q1 we
can write
ID12 + ID9 = 320 µA
(1)
The current through Q14 becomes
ID14 = 20 µA + ID12
(2)
Also, since Q9 has (W/L) equal to ten times that
of Q14, we have
ID9 = 10 ID14
(3)
Solving (1), (2), and (3) together yields
ID12 = 10.9 µA ≃11 µA
ID14 ≃31 µA
ID9 ≃310 µA
Thus,
ID10 = ID9 ≃310 µA
ID4 = ID10 = 310 µA
IO = 310 µA
Thus, the current available to charge CL has
increased from IB = 200 µA to 310 µA, a factor
of 1.65. The slew rate will increase by the same
factor. However, it is possible that the large
current that Q4 now conducts can raise the voltage
at its source and thus at the drain of Q10 to a value
that drives Q10 into the triode region. In this case,
the current that Q10 provides will be reduced and
the full increase in SR will not be realized.
To determine the voltage at the drain of Q1, we
first find VG14,

Chapter 12–16
VG14 = VDD −VSG14
When ID4 was 20 µA, |VOV14| was 0.15 V. Now
ID4 = 31 µA and thus |VOV14| becomes
|VOV14| = 0.15 ×

31
20 = 0.19 V
Thus,
VSG14 = 0.45 + 0.19 = 0.64 V
and
VG = 1 −0.64 = +0.36 V
Next, we estimate VGS12. Since ID12 is only 11 µA
and assuming Q11 is, say, similar to Q1, then
VOV12 = 0.15

11
160
= 0.04 V
Thus,
VGS12 = 0.45 + 0.04 = 0.49 V
It follows that
VD1 = 0.36 −0.49 = −0.13 V
which is sufficient to keep Q1 and Q11 in the
saturation region.
12.37 First we determine VOV:
90 = 1
2 × 400 × 20 V2
OV
⇒VOV = 0.15 V
VBIAS = Vt + 2VOV = 0.45 + 2 × 0.15
= 0.75 V
Figure 1 shows the voltages at the various nodes
in the mirror circuit. The minimum voltage
allowable at the output terminal is
vOmin = VBIAS −Vtn
= 0.75 −0.45 = 0.3 V
which is 2VOV.
The output resistance is

gm3 = 2ID
VOV
= 2 × 0.09
0.15
= 1.2 mA/V
Ro = 1.2 × 111.1 × 111.1 = 14.8 M
Figure 1
12.38 Since Q3 is operating in the common-gate
configuration and since the resistance in its drain
is low, the input resistance at its source is 1/gm3.
This resistance appears in parallel with ro1 which
is much larger. Thus, the total resistance at this
node is ≃1/gm3 and since the total capacitance is
CP, the pole introduced will have a frequency
fP ≃
1
2πCP/gm3
=
gm3
2πCP
Q.E.D.
Now,
ft =
gm1
2πCL
where gm1 = gm3 because all transistors are
operating at the same values of ID and |VOV|.
For a phase margin of 80◦the phase at ft
introduced by the pole at fP must be only 10◦,

To keep the gain and the permissable range of

of 4, thus RC becomes

12.50 For I5 = 10 µA = I, then
Q5 emitter area
Q1 emitter area = 1
For I6 = 40 µA = 4I, then
Q6 emitter area
Q1 emitter area = 4
If we connect a resistance R6 in the emitter of Q6,
then I6 changes to a new value determined as
follows:
VBE6 + I6R6 = VBE1
I6R6 = VBE1 −VBE6
= VT ln I

Ro6 = 3 + (3.47 ∥100) × 10−3(1 + 1200)

Thus, increasing the BEJ area by a factor of 4 and
adding a resistance R6 to restore the current to the
desired value of 10 µA increases the output
resistance by a factor of about 2.5!

To increase Ro to 14 M, we must increase R1 so
that

⇒R1 = 1.8 k
12.53 (a) If Q1 has emitter resistor R1 and
conducts a current IE, the resistor in the emitter of
Q2 is R1 + R1 and it will conduct a current
IE −IE so that
VBE1 + IER1 = VBE2 + (IE −IE)(R1 + R1)
VBE1 −VBE2 = IER1 −IE(R1 + R1)
Using a small-signal approximation, we
recognize the change in VBE on the left-hand side
of the expression is IEre.

Thus,

Thus,

The resistance Ro7 is the output resistance of Q7,
which has an emitter-degeneration resistance

From Fig. 12.18 we see that the current through
R7 is approximately (IC1 + IC7), that is, 3I. Thus,
R7 = 0.2

Since Q3 and Q4 are cut off, the current through
R9 is equal to IE9 or approximately IC9, thus

common-mode input signal △VCM. The CMF
circuit will respond by causing a change △VB in
its output voltage that can be found from its

R7 = 20 k
thus
Aβ = (23 ∥12.9) × 103

(c) For a change △I = 0.3 µA, the corresponding
change in VCM without feedback is
△VCM = △I(Ro7 ∥Ro9)
The negative feedback reduces this change by the
amount of negative feedback 1 + Aβ ≃Aβ, thus
the actual △VCM becomes
△VCM ≃△I(Ro7 ∥Ro9)
Aβ
Substituting for Aβ from Eq. (1), we obtain
△VCM = △I(re7 + R7)

which is identical to the value found in

Figure 1 shows the input stage with the two extra

these devices are simply in series with Q1 −Q4,

Thus the input resistance increases but the gain
decreases: The additional diodes introduce
negative feedback in the input stage; same effect
as adding a resistance in the emitter of a
common-emitter amplifier.
12.63 From Eq. (12.86) we have

where
gm1 = 0.38 mA/V
Ro6 = 2.63 M
Ro7 = 31.1 M
ϵm = 1 −0.995 = 0.005
Thus,
CMRR = 0.38(2.63 ∥31.3) × 103/0.005

or 105.3 dB
12.64 Please note that an error occurred in the
first printing of the text: Q9 is biased at 19 µA.
With a resistance R in the emitter of Q9, Ro9
becomes

Thus, Ro to the left of node Y becomes

Now,

Thus,

Selecting r1 = 10 k, we obtain r2 = 90 k.

2π104 × 10−9 = 15.9 k
Using Eq. (13.65) and selecting R1 = 10 k,

Using Eq. (13.66) and setting R2 = 10 k, we
obtain

The center-frequency gain is given by Eq.

Ex: 13.23 Refer to Fig. 13.29 and Eqns.

0.1 × 10−3 × 10 × 10−9 =

Thus, the condition of oscillation is satisfied.

Since ω0 is not a function of R, changing R has no
effect on ω0, that is, △ω0 = 0.
Ex: 13.28 Refer to Fig. 13.37. Noting that the
sinusoid at the positive input terminal of the op
amp has a peak amplitude of 0.9 V, to obtain a
5-V peak amplitude at the output, the closed-loop
gain of the op amp must be

The closed-loop poles are found by setting
L (s) = 1; that is, they are the values of s,
satisfying
3 + s × 16 × 10−5 +
1
s × 16 × 10−5 = 3.03
⇒s = 105

(b) The frequency of oscillation is

Since the limiter circuit is symmetric, the
negative peak amplitude also will be 10.68 V.
Thus, the peak-to-peak amplitude of the output
sinusoid will be
ˆvop−p = 2 × 10.68 = 21.36 V
Ex: 13.30 (a) For oscillations to start, we need
from Eq. (13.121), R2/R1 = 2; thus the
potentiometer should be set so that its resistance

Figure 1 shows the location of the five poles in the
s plane. To find ω0 and Q of the two pairs of com-
plex poles, we refer to Fig. 13.9 which shows the
definition of ω0 and Q. Now, for the (p1, p∗

For the pair (p2, p∗
2),
ω02 = 105 rad/s
ω02
2Q2
= 105 cos 36◦
⇒Q2 = 0.618
The real-axis pole gives rise to the denominator
factor (s + ω0); that is, (s + 105). Thus, the
denominator of T(s) can be written as
D(s) = (s+ω0) (s2 +s ω0
Q1
+ω2
0) (s2 +s ω0
Q2
+ω2

where ω0 = 105 rad/s, Q1 = 1.618, and
Q2 = 0.618.

the dc gain is unity,

13.12 Since there are four poles (and four zeros)
this is a fourth-order (N = 4) filter. The
complex-conjugate pole pair with ω0 = 103 rad/s
and Q = 1 gives rise to the denominator factor
(s2 + s 103 + 106).

All the transmission zeros are at s = ∞. To find
the poles, we have to factor the third-order
denominator polynomial. Toward this end, we
find by inspection that one of the zeros of the
denominator polynomial is at s = −1. Thus, the
polynomial will have a factor (s + 1) and can be
written as
s3 + 2s2 + 3s + 2 = (s + 1)(s2 + as + b)
where by equating corresponding terms on both
sides we find that
b = 2
a + 1 = 2 ⇒a = 1
Thus,
s3 + 2s2 + 3s + 2 = (s + 1)(s2 + s + 2)
and the poles are at
s = −1

s2 + s + 2 = 0

13.23 Figure 1 (on the next page) shows the
bandpass filter realized as the cascade of a
first-order low-pass filter and a first-order
high-pass filter. The component values are
determined as follows:
Rin = R1
To make Rin as large as possible while satisfying
the constraint that no resistance is larger than
100 k, we select
R1 = 100 k
The low-frequency gain of the low-pass circuit is
(−R2/R1). With R1 = 100 k, the maximum
gain obtained is unity and is achieved by selecting
R2 = 100 k
This implies that the required gain of 12 dB or
4 V/V must be all realized in the high-pass circuit.
The upper 3-dB frequency of the bandpass filter is
the 3-dB frequency of the low-pass circuit, that is,
50 × 103 =
1
2πC1R2
⇒C1 =
1
2π × 50 × 103 × 100 × 103
= 31.8 pF
Next, we consider the high-pass circuit. The
high-frequency (f ≫50 Hz) gain of this circuit is
(−R4/R3). To obtain a gain of −4 V/V, we select
R4 = 100 k
R3 = 100
4
= 25 k
The lower 3-dB frequency of the bandpass filter
(50 Hz) is the 3-dB frequency of the high-pass
circuit, thus

Since both Z1 and Z2 have a parallel structure, it
is far more convenient to work in terms of Y1(s)

Each pair of complex conjugate poles,
pk, p∗
k = ωp(−k ± j k)
gives rise to a quadratic factor in the denominator
of T(s) given by
s2 + sωp(2k) + ω2
p(2
k + 2
k)
where
ωp = 2π × 3.4 × 103 rad/s
Thus, we obtain for the five pole pairs:
p1, p∗
1: (s2 + s 0.0448ωp + 0.9961ω2
p)
p2, p∗
2: (s2 + s 0.1302ωp + 0.8144ω2

5: (s2 + s 0.2830ωp + 0.0450ω2

The transfer function T(s) can now be written as
T(s) =

Product of five quadratic terms
The value of B determines the required dc gain,
specifically

For DC gain =

we select

= 7.60 × 1040
13.39 Amax = 0.5 dB, Amin ≥20 dB, ωs

Using Eq. (13.31), we obtain
ϵ =
	
10Amax/10 −1
=
	
100.05 −1 = 0.3493
Using Eq. (13.32), we have
A(ωs) = 10 log[1 + ϵ2(ωs/ωp)2N]
= 10 log[1 + 0.34932 × 1.72N]
For N = 5, A(ωs) = 14.08 dB
For N = 6, A(ωs) = 18.58 dB
For N = 7, A(ωs) = 23.15 dB
Thus, to meet the As ≥20 dB specification,
we use
N = 7
in which case the actual minimum stopband
attenuation realized is
Amin = 23.15 dB
If Amin is to be exactly 20 dB, we can use Eq.
(13.32) to obtain the new value of ϵ as follows:
20 = 10 log[1 + ϵ2 × 1.714]
ϵ =

100 −1
1.714
= 0.2425
Now, using Eq. (13.30) we can determine the
value to which Amax can be reduced as
Amax = 20 log
	
1 + ϵ2
Amax = 20 log
	
1 + 0.24252
= 0.25 dB
13.40 Using Eq. (13.32), we have
A(ωs) = 10 log[1 + ϵ2(ωs/ωp)2N]
For large A(ωs), we can neglect the unity term in
this expression to obtain
A(ωs) ≃10 log [ϵ2(ωs/ωp)2N]
Substituting A(ωs) ≥Amin we obtain
20 log ϵ + 20N log(ωs/ωp) ≥Amin
⇒N ≥Amin −20 log ϵ
20 log(ωs/ωp)

13.42 (a) Consider first the Butterworth filter.
For the given Amax = 1 dB we find the
corresponding value of ϵ using Eq. (13.31) as
ϵ =
	
100.1 −1 = 0.5088
Next we use Eq. (13.32) to determine the
attenuation at ωs = 2ωp, as
A(ωs) = 10 log10(1 + 0.50882 × 212)
= 30.3 dB
(b) We next consider the Chebyshev filter. Its ϵ
is the same as that for the Butterworth filter, that
is,
ϵ = 0.5088
The attenuation at ωs = 2ωp can be determined
using Eq. (13.32) as
Figure 1
A(ωs) = 10 log[1 + 0.50882 cosh2(6 cosh−12)]
= 56.7 dB
which is nearly twice as much as the attenuation
provided by the Butterworth filter. A sketch of
the transmission of both filter types is shown in
Fig. 1.
Note that we have expanded the vertical scale to
show the details of the passband.

13.47 Refer to the circuit in Fig. 13.19(c). Since,
at the center frequency, the LC circuit acts as an
open circuit, the circuit reduces to R. We can
change the gain to 0.5, by splitting R into two
equal parts, each equal to 2R. The voltage divider
(2R, 2R) will provide at ω0, a gain of 0.5. The Q
factor will be determined by the parallel
equivalent of 2R and 2R. Since the latter is
equivalent to R, Q will remain unchanged, as
required. The resulting circuit is shown in Fig. 1.

13.57 (a) Figure 1 above shows the analysis. It
is based on assuming ideal op amps that exhibit
virtual short circuits between their input
terminals, and draw zero currents into their input
terminals. Observe that:
(1) The circuit is fed at port-1 with a voltage V1.
The virtual short circuit between the input
terminals of each of A2 and A1 cause the voltage
at port-2 to be
V2 = V1
(1)
(2) With port-2 terminated in an impedance Z5,
the current that flows out of port-2 is
I2 = V2
Z5
(3) Following the analysis indicated, we find the
input current into port-1 as
I1 = V1
Z2Z4
Z1Z3Z5
This current could have been written as
I1 = V1
Z2Z4
Z1Z3
I2
(2)
(4) Equations (1) and (2) describe the operation
of the circuit: It propagates the voltage applied to
port-1, V1, and to port-2, V2 = V1; and whatever
current is drawn out of port-2 is multiplied by the
function (Z2Z4/Z1Z3) and appears at port-1.
(5) The result of the two actions in (4) is that the
input impedance looking into port-1 becomes
Z11 ≡V1
I1
=
V2
I2(Z2Z4/Z1Z3)
=
Z1Z3
Z2Z4
 V2
I2

or
Z11 =
Z1Z3
Z2Z4

Z5
(b) If port-1 is terminated in an impedance Z6,
the input impedance looking into port-2 can be
obtained by invoking the symmetry of the circuit,
thus
Z22 =
Z2Z4
Z1Z3

Z6
Thus, the circuit behaves as an impedance
transformer with the transformation ratio from
port-2 to port-1 being
Z1Z3
Z2Z4

and from port-1 to
port-2 being
Z2Z4
Z1Z3

.
Since Z1, Z2, Z3, and Z4 can be arbitrary functions
of s, the transformation ratio can be an arbitrary
function of s. Thus the circuit can be used as an
impedance converter. For instance, the particular
selection of impedances in Fig. 13.20(a) results in
the transformation ratio from port-2 to port-1

Fig. 13.20(a) converts a resistance R5 into an
inductance L = C4R1R3R5/R2. Other conversion
functions are possible and the circuit is known as
a Generalized Impedance Converter or GIC.

which the phase of the loop gain is zero. From

Oscillations will start if the magnitude of the loop

Chapter 13–32
Since the phase shift of the frequency-selective
network is 180◦, the amplifier must have a phase
shift of 180◦. Also, the loop gain at ω0 must be at
least unity. Since the frequency-selective network
has 12-dB attenuation, the amplifier gain must be
at least 12 dB or 4 V/V.

This value of (r2/r1) results in sustained
oscillations. To ensure that oscillations start, we
make r2/r1 slightly greater than 2.
13.88 For the circuit to oscillate, two conditions
must be satisfied:
(1) The total phase shift around the loop should
be 0 or 360◦, and
(2) The loop gain must be at least unity.
Here we have three amplifier stages (Fig.

at the oscillation frequency ω0, must be 120◦.

If R3 and R6 are open circuited, substituting
R6 = ∞in Eq. (1) yields
ˆVo = 1.5VD = 1.05 V
This result can be obtained directly from the
circuit: If R3 and R6 are open circuited, the
positive peak of the output will be the voltage at
which D2 conducts. At this point, vO = ˆVo and
v1 = 1

Equating the imaginary part on the RHS to zero,
we obtain for the frequency of oscillation ω0

Equating the real parts on both sides gives the
condition for sustained oscillations as

2π × 10 × 103 × 10 × 103
= 1.59 nF
where we used R = 10 k. Now, for sustained
oscillations,
Rf = 2R = 20 k
However, to ensure oscillation will start, we use a
slightly smaller value for Rf .
To determine the limiter component values, we
first derive an expression for the peak amplitude
of vO1, i.e. ˆvO1. At the time vO1 = ˆvO1, diode D2
is conducting and clamping the voltage at the
common node of R3 and R4 at VD volts. Writing
an equation for that node while neglecting the
current in the diode relative to the current in R3
and R4, we obtain
ˆvO1 −VD
R3
= VD −(−V)
R4
where V is the magnitude of each of the two
supply voltages. This equation can be rearranged
to the form
ˆvO1 = VD + (R3
R4
) (V + VD)
Thus, for VD = 0.7 V and V = 15 V, to obtain
ˆvO1 = 5 V, the required (R3/R4) is found from
5 = 0.7 + (R3
R4
) (15 + 0.7)

The square wave v2 will have a peak-to-peak
amplitude
V = 1.4 V
The component at the fundamental frequency ω0
will have a peak-to-peak amplitude of
4 V/π = 1.78 V. The filter has a center-frequency
gain of 2, thus at v1 the sine wave will have a
peak-to-peak amplitude of approximately 3.6 V.
The output amplitude can be doubled by adding a
diode in series with each of the diodes in the
limiter.

13.96 If the closed-loop amplifier in Fig. 13.38

Q.E.D.
13.105 Figure 1(a) shows the filter circuit that is
part of the oscillator in Fig. 13.45. We need to
derive the transfer function V1/V2. We will do the
derivation in two steps:
First, we will show that the input impedance
Zin ≡V/I is an inductance L and we will find its
value. Thus, the circuit has the equivalent shown
in Fig. 1(b). Second, we will derive the transfer
function of the circuit in Fig. 1(b) on the next
page.
To obtain the input impedance Zin, we analyze the
circuit as shown in Fig. 1(a). The key point
here is that the ideal op amps cause the voltage
between the two input terminals of each to be
zero. Thus, the voltage V at the input terminal
propagates to the other side of the circuit. The
remainder of the analysis is straightforward with
the result that the input I is given by
I = V/sCR2
Thus, the input impedance Zin is
Zin ≡V
I = sCR2
which is that of an inductance L,
L = CR2

13.112 (a)
Figure 1
Figure 1 shows the equivalent circuit.
(b) Oscillations will occur at the frequency for
which the tuned circuit has infinite impedance.
This is because at this frequency the phase shift
around the loop will be zero. Thus,
ω0 = 1/
√
LC
At this frequency, no current flows through R.
Thus the voltage Vc2 will be
Vc2 = (gm2Veb2)RC
and the voltage Vo will equal Vc2, thus
(gm2Veb2)RC = Vo = 2Veb2
which yields the condition for sustained
oscillation as
gm2RC = 2
For oscillations to start, we impose the condition
gm2RC > 2
(1)
But
gm2 ≃I/2
VT
Thus, the condition in (1) can be expressed as
IRC > 4VT
that is,
IRC > 0.1 V
(c) Selecting IRC = 1 V means that oscillations
will start and will grow in amplitude until Vo is
large enough to cause Q1 and Q2 to alternately
turn on and off. When this happens the collector
current of Q2 will be 0 in half a cycle and equal to
I in the other half cycle. Thus a square wave
voltage of amplitude IRC = 1 V peak-to-peak
will develop at the collector of Q2. This square
wave voltage is applied through R to the bandpass
filter formed by the RLC circuit. Thus, the
sinusoid that develops across the LC circuit—that
is, Vo—will have a frequency ω0 and a
peak-to-peak amplitude of
 4



π V .
There will be third, fifth, and other odd
harmonics, but those will be attenuated because
of the selectivity of the bandpass RLC circuit.

∴The output is a symmetric square wave of

Since VTH = −VTL = 1 V, if the average shifts by
an amount so either the +ve or -ve swing is
< 1 V, then no change of state will occur.
Clearly, if the shift is 0.1 V, the output will be a

Ex: 14.1 Observe the two PMOS transistors in

the parallel path with three PMOS transistors in

The value of RD can be obtained from
RD = VDD −VOL
ID

When the switch is open, ID = 0 and
PDrawn = VDDID = 0
When the switch is closed, ID = 20 µA, and
PDrawn = VDDID = 1.0 × 20 = 20 µW
Ex: 14.3 If Vx remains unchanged at 0.0225 V,
then
knRD = 1
Vx
=

0.0225 = 44.44
For RD to be 10 k,
kn = 44.44
10
= 4.444 mA/V2
Thus,
4.444 = 0.54 × W
L
⇒W
L = 8.22
The parameters VOH, VOL, VIL, VIH and thus NML
and NMH do not depend on the value R (but on
Vx) and thus their values will not change.
The current IDD drawn from the power supply
during the low-output interval becomes
IDD = VDD −VOL
RD
= 1.0 −0.033
10
= 96.7 µA
and the power drawn from the supply during the
low-output interval is
PD = VDDID = 1.0 × 96.7 = 96.7 µW
Since the inverter spends half of the time in this
state, we have
PDaverage = 1

Now,
VOH = 1.0 V
From Eq. (14.22) we get
VOL =
1.0
1 + 1.0 −0.35
0.12
= 0.16 V
From Eq. (14.12) we obtain
VIL = Vt + Vx = 0.35 + 0.12 = 0.47 V
From Eq. (14.20) we have
VIH = 0.35 + 1.63
√
1.0 × 0.12 −0.12
= 0.80 V
Thus,
NML = VIL −VOL = 0.47 −0.16 = 0.31 V
NMH = VOH −VIH = 1.0 −0.80 = 0.20 V
During the output-low interval, we have
IDD = VDD −VOL
RD
= 1.0 −0.16
10
= 84 µA
and
PD = 1.0 × 84 = 84 µW
Thus,

by utilizing the PUN in Fig. 14.11(a) and then
finding the dual PDN. Note that two additional
inverters are needed to generate A and B, for a
total of 12 transistors.
14.11 Y = ABC + ABC + ABC
(1)
Using this expression to directly synthesize the
PUN we obtain the circuit shown in Fig. 1.
This PUN circuit requires 9 transistors plus three
inverters for a total of 15 transistors.
This, of course, does not include the transistors
required for the PDN which we shall consider
shortly. Inspecting the PUN circuit reveals the
potential for eliminating two transistors through
what is known as "path merging." Specifically the
two transistors in the top row that are controlled
by A can be merged into a single transistor, and
the two transistors in the bottom row that are
controlled by C can be merged into a single
transistor. The result is the 7-transistor PUN
shown in Fig. S14.11(b).
We next consider the realization of the PDN. A
straightforward realization can be obtained by
finding the dual of the PUN in Fig. S14.11(a).
This is shown in Fig. S14.11(c). It requires nine
transistors plus three inverters. The latter, of
course are the same three inverters needed to
obtain the complemented variables in PUN. The
circuit in Fig. S14.11(c) does not lend itself to

path merging, at least not in a straightforward
way.
There is, however, an alternative way to
synthesize a PDN with a lower number of
transistors. We simply obtain Y from the
expression in Eq. (1) using DeMorgan’s law as
follows:
Y = ABC.ABC.ABC
= (A + B + C)(A + B + C)(A + B + C)
(2)
Direct synthesis of Eq. (2) results in the circuit of
Fig. S14.11(c). However, further manipulation of
the expression in (2) results in a more economical
realization, as follows:
Y = AB(A + B + C) + AC(A + B + C)
+ B A(A + B + C) + B C(A + B + C)
+ C A(A + B + C) + CB(A + B + C)
+ C(A + B + C)
= ABC + B C + A B + A C
= ABC + A(B + C) + B C

A direct realization of this expression results in
the PDN shown in Fig. S14.11(d). This circuit
requires 8 transistors (not counting the inverters).

(b) This expression can be directly realized with
the PDN shown in Fig. S14.12(a). Note that the
circuit requires 12 transistors in addition to the
three inverters needed to generate A, B, and C.
(c) From inspection of the PDN in Fig. 1 we see
that we can combine the two transistors
controlled by A and the two transistors controlled
by A. This results in the PDN realization shown in
Fig. 2 which requires 10 transistors, not counting
those in the inverters. See Fig. S14.12(b) above.
(d) The PUN in Fig. S14.12(c) (next page) can be
obtained as the dual of the PDN in Fig. S14.12(b).
Combining the PDN and the PUN gives the
complete realization of the even-parity checker.
Note: The number of transistors in the PDN of
Fig. S14.12(b) can be reduced by 2 by combining
the two transistors in the bottom row that are
controlled by C, and the two transistors that are
controlled by C. The resulting 8-transistor
realization is shown in Fig. S14.12(d) on the next
page. However, it is not easy to obtain a PUN as a
dual of this circuit. See Fig. S14.12(d) on next

PDN shown in Fig. S14.13 on the next page.
14.14 S = AB C + A BC + AB C + ABC
= A(BC + BC) + A(BC + B C)
This is the same function as that of the odd-parity
checker in Problem 14.12. Thus the realization of
the S function will be identical to that in
Fig. S14.12(a) of Problem 14.12.
As for C0 we write
C0 = ABC + ABC + ABC + ABC
This expression can be minimized as follows:
C0 = (A + A)BC + (B + B)AC + (C + C)AB
= BC + AC + AB = A(B + C) + BC
which can be realized directly by the PUN of the
circuit in Fig. S14.14 on page 14-8 where the
PDN is obtained as the dual network of the PUN.
In addition to the 10 transistors, we need three
inverters to generate A, B and C.

Figure S14.24 shows a sketch of the VTC where
we have approximated the VTC in the transition
region by a straight line with a slope equal to the
maximum possible small-signal gain, namely 50
V/V. We can use the geometry of the VTC to
determine VIH and VIL as follows:
|Slope| = 50

Thus,

NMH = VOH −VIH
= 1 −0.408 = 0.592 V
NML = VIL −VOL

Since we approximated the VTC in the transition
region by a straight line, the large-signal voltage
gain will be equal to the small-signal voltage
gain,
= −50 V/V
14.25 Here, VOH = 0.9 V, and VOL = 0.0 V
Also, VIH −VIL ≤0.9/3 = 0.3 V
(1)
Now, the noise margins are “within 30% of one
other.” Thus, NMH = (1 ± 0.3) NML or
NML = (1 ± 0.3) NMH. Thus, they remain
“within” either NMH = 1.3NML or
NML = 1.3NMH, in which case either
NML = 0.769NMH or NMH = 0.769NML
For the former case:
0.769(VOH −VIH) = (VIL −VOL) or
0.769(0.9 −VIH) = VIL −0, whence
VIL = 0.692 −0.769VIH
Now, from (1), VIH = VIL + 0.3
Thus,
VIL = 0.692 −0.769 (VIL + 0.3)
= 0.461 −0.769VIL
and VIL = 0.461/1.769 = 0.26 V
whence VIH = 0.3 + 0.26 = 0.56 V
Alternatively, NMH = 0.769NML and
(VOH −VIH) = 0.769 (VIL −VOL) or
0.9 −VIH = 0.769VIL −0 and
VIH = 0.9 −0.769VIL, with (1),
VIL + 0.3 = 0.9 −0.769VIL, and
1.769VIL = 0.6, whence VIL = 0.34 V
and VIH = 0.3 + 0.34 = 0.64
Thus, overall, VOH = 0.9 V, VOL = 0.0 V,

VIH ranges from 0.56 V to 0.64 V, and
VIL ranges from 0.26 V to 0.34 V, in
which case the margins can be as low as
NML = VIL −VOL = 0.26 V and
NMH = VOH −VIH = 0.9 −0.64 = 0.26 V
and as high as 0.34 V.

⇒Wp = 2.5Wn = 2.5 × 1.5 × 65 = 244 nm
Silicon area = WnLn + WpLp

= 1.5 × 65 × 65(1 + 2.5)

(b) VOH = VDD = 1 V
VOL = 0 V
To obtain VIH, we use Eq. (14.35):
VIH = 1
8(5VDD −2Vt)

8(5 × 1 −2 × 0.35)

To obtain VIL, we use Eq. (14.36):
VIL = 1
8(3VDD + 2Vt)
= 1
8(3 × 1 + 2 × 0.35)
= 0.4625 V
The noise margins can now be found as
NMH = VOH −VIH
= 1 −0.5375 = 0.4625 V
NML = VIL −VOL
= 0.4625 −0 = 0.4625 V
The noise margins are equal at approximately
0.46 V; a result of the matched design of the
inverter.
(c) Since the inverter is matched, the output
resistances in the two states will be equal. Thus,

8(3 × 2.5 + 2 × 0.5)

NMH = NML = 1.0625 V
Silicon area = WnLn + WpLp
= 1.5 × 0.25 × 0.25 + 3.5 × 1.5 × 0.25 × 0.25
= 4.5 × 1.5 × 0.252 = 0.42 µm2

Eq. (14.40): r =

3.5 × 1 = 0.53
Eq. (14.39): VM = r(VDD −|Vtp|) + Vtn
r + 1
= 0.53(2.5 −0.5) + 0.5
0.53 + 1
= 1.02 V
Thus, VM shifts to the left by 0.23 V. Assuming
VIL shifts by approximately the same amount,
then
VIL ≃1.0625 −0.23 ≃0.83 V
Since NML = VIL, NML will be reduced by
approximately 22% (relative to the matched
case).
Silicon area = WnLn + WpLp
= 1.5 × 0.25 × 0.25 + 1.5 × 0.25 × 0.25
= 3 × 0.252 = 0.19 µm2
which is a reduction of 55% relative to the
matched case.

r + 1
= 0.756(2.5 −0.5) + 0.5
0.756 + 1
= 1.15 V
Thus, relative to the matched case the switching
point (VM) is shifted left by (1.25 −1.15) = 0.1
V. Assuming that VIL is reduced by
approximately the same amount, then
VIL = 1.0625 −0.1 = 0.9625 V
Thus, NML which equals VIL is reduced by about
9% (relative to the matched case).
Silicon area = WnLn + WpLp
= 1.5 × 0.25 × 0.25 + 2 × 1.5 × 0.25 × 0.25
= 3 × 1.5 × 0.252
= 0.28 µm2
Compared to the matched case, the silicon area is
reduced by 33%.
14.32 For vI = +1.5 V, QN will be conducting
and operating in the triode region while QP will
be off. Thus, the incremental resistance to the left
of node A will be rDSN,
rDSN =

Thus,

14.33 From Eq. (14.39) we have
VM = r(VDD −|Vtp|) + Vtn
r + 1
rVM + VM = r(VDD −|Vtp|) + Vtn
r(VDD −|Vtp| −VM) = VM −Vtn
⇒r =

14.35 Refer to Example 14.3 except here:
VDD = 1.3 V, Vtn = |Vtp| = 0.4 V, μn = 4 μp,
and μnCox = 0.5 mA/V2. Also, QN and QP have
L = 0.13 µm and (W/L)n = 1.5.
(a) For VM = VDD/2 = 0.65 V, the inverter must
be matched, thus
Wp
Wn
= μn
μp
= 4
Since Wn/L = 1.5,
Wn = 1.5 × 0.13 = 0.195 µm. Thus,
Wp = 4 × 0.195 = 0.78 µm
For this design, the silicon area is
A = WnL + WpL = L(Wn + Wp)
= 0.13(0.195 + 0.78) = 0.127 µm2
(b) VOH = VDD = 1.3 V
VOL = 0 V
To obtain VIH, we use Eq. (14.35):
VIH = 1
8(5VDD −2Vt)
= 1
8(5 × 1.3 −2 × 0.4)
= 0.7125 V
To obtain VIL, we use Eq. (14.36):
VIL = 1
8(3VDD + 2Vt)
= 1
8(3 × 1.3 + 2 × 0.4)
= 0.5875 V
We can now compute the noise margins as
NMH = VOH −VIH = 1.3 −0.7125
= 0.5875 V ≃0.59 V
NML = VIL −VOL = 0.5875 −0
= 0.5875 V ≃0.59 V
For vI = VIH = 0.7125 V, we can obtain the
corresponding value of vO by substituting in Eq.
(14.34):
vO = VIH −VDD
2
= 0.7125 −0.65 = 0.0625 V
Thus, the worst-case value of VOL is
VOmax = 0.0625 ≃0.06 V, and the noise margin
NML reduces to
NML = 0.5875 −0.0625 = 0.5250 V
or approximately 0.53 V.
From symmetry, we can obtain the value of vO
corresponding to vI = VIL as
vO = VDD −0.0625
= 1.3 −0.0625 = 1.2375 V ≃1.24 V
Thus, the worst-case value of VOH is
VOHmin ≃1.24 V, and the noise margin NMH is
reduced to
NMH = VOHmin −VIH
= 1.2375 −0.7125 = 0.5250 V
or approximately 0.53 V.
Note that the reduction in the noise margin (about
0.06 V) is slight.
(c) The output resistance of the inverter in the
low-output state is

μnCox(W/L)n(VDD −Vtn)

Chapter 14–15
Since QN and QP are matched, the output
resistance in the high-output state will be equal,
that is,
rDSP = rDSN = 1.48 k
(d) If the inverter is biased to operate at
vI = vO = VM = 0.65 V, then each of QN and QP
will be operating at an overdrive voltage
VOV = VM −Vt = 0.65 −0.4 = 0.25 V and will
be conducting equal dc currents ID of

VOV

Transistors QN and QP will have output
resistances ron and rop given by
ron = VAn

rop = |VAp|
ID
Since no values are given for VAn and VAp we
shall use the data in Table K.1, namely
V′
An = 5 V/µm and |V′
Ap| = 6 V/µm
Thus,
VAn = 5 × 0.13 = 0.65 V
|VAp| = 6 × 0.13 = 0.78 V
ron = 0.65 V
23.4 µA = 27.8 k
rop = 0.78 V
23.4 µA = 33.3 k
We can now compute the voltage gain at M as
Av = −(gmn + gmp)(ron ∥rop)
= −(0.19 + 0.19)(27.8 ∥33.3)
= −5.8 V/V
When the straight line at M of slope −5.8 V/V is
extrapolated, it intersects the line vO = 0 at

the transition region can be considered
(0.762 −0.538) = 0.224 V.
(e) For Wp = Wn, the parameter r can be found
from Eq. (14.40):
r =

4 × 1 = 0.5
The corresponding value of VM can be
determined from Eq. (14.39) as
VM = 0.5(1.3 −0.4) + 0.4
0.5 + 1
= 0.57 V
Thus, VM shifts by only −0.08 V. We can
estimate the reduction in NML to be
approximately equal to the shift in VM, that is,
NML becomes
NML = 0.5875 −0.08 ≃0.51 V
The silicon area for this design can be computed
as follows:
A = L(Wn + Wp)
= 0.13(1.5 × 0.13 + 1.5 × 0.13)
= 0.051 µm2
This represents a 60% reduction from the
matched case!
(f) For Wp = 2Wn, we have
r =

VM = 0.707(1.3 −0.4) + 0.4
0.707 + 1
= 0.61 V
Thus, relative to the matched case, VM is reduced
by only 0.04 V. Correspondingly, NML will be
reduced by approximately an equal amount, thus
NML becomes
NML ≃0.59 −0.04 = 0.55 V
In this case, the silicon area required is
A = L(Wn + Wp) = L × 3Wn
= 0.13 × 3 × 1.5 × 0.13
= 0.076 µm2
which represents a 40% reduction relative to the
matched case.

To obtain tPLH, consider the situation in Fig. 1(a).
Here, PD has just opened (at t = 0) leaving
vO = 0 V at t = 0+. Capacitor C then charges
through the on resistance of the pull-up switch,
Ronu, toward VDD, thus
vO(t) = V∞−(V∞−V0+)e−t/τ
= VDD −(VDD −0)e−t/τ
= VDD(1 −e−t/τ)
At t = tPLH, vO = VDD/2, thus
VDD
2
= VDD(1 −e−tPLH/τ)
⇒e−tPLH/τ = 0.5
⇒tPLH = τ ln2 = 0.69τ
For C = 10 fF and Ronu = 20 k, then
τ = 10 × 10−15 × 20 × 103 = 200 ps
and
tPLH = 0.69 × 200 = 138 ps
Next we determine tPHL by considering the
situation depicted in Fig. 1(b). Here, PU has just
opened, leaving vO(0+) = VDD. Capacitor C then
discharges through the on resistance of the
pull-down switch, Rond, toward 0 V, thus
vO(∞) = 0, thus
vO = 0 −(0 −VDD)e−t/τ
= VDDe−t/τ
At t = tPHL, vO = VDD/2 and we get
VDD
2
= VDDe−tPHL/τ
⇒tPHL = τ ln2 = 0.69τ
Here,
τ = CRond
= 10 × 10−15 × 10 × 103 = 100 ps
Thus,
tPHL = 69 ps
The propagation delay tP can now be obtained as
tP = 1

vO(t2) = 0.1VDD = e−t2/τ

Ex: 15.6 With an additional 0.1 pF, C becomes

(b) To reduce the extrinsic component of tP by a

Exercise 15–3
This component remains unchanged. The
extrinsic component
tP,ext = 4.88 −0.88 = 4

tP = 0.88 + 4
2 = 2.88 ps
(d) Area = WnL + WpL

By scaling Wn and Wp by a factor of 2, the area
increases by a factor of 2.
Ex: 15.9 L = 0.18 µm, n = 1.5, p = 3
(a) Four-input NOR gate: Refer to Fig. 15.8.
For NMOS transistors: W/L = n = 1.5 = 0.27

For PMOS transistors: W/L = 4p = 12 = 2.16

Area of NAND gate

Thus,
NOR area
NAND area = 1.7496

Ex: 15.10 Refer to Fig. 15.9.
(a) Maximum charging current is the current
supplied by the four identical PMOS transistors.
Minimum charging current is the current supplied
by one of the PMOS transistors. Thus, the ratio of
maximum to minimum currents is 4.
(b) There is only one possible configuration for
discharging a load capacitance, namely, when all
4 NMOS transistors are conducting. So, as far as
capacitor discharge is concerned, the ratio is one.
Ex: 15.11 Pdyn = fCV2

Ex: 15.13 Pdyn = fCV2

C decreases by a factor (0.13/0.5) and VDD
decreases from 5 V to 1.2 V; thus for the same f,

Solutions to End-of-Chapter Problems
15.1 (a) Capacitor C is charged to 10 V and the
switch closes at t = 0, thus
vO(0+) = 10 V
Capacitor C then discharges through R
exponentially with vO(∞) = 0
vO(t) = 0 −(0 −10) e−t/τ
⇒vO(t) = 10e−t/τ
(b) For C = 100 pF and R = 1 k, we have
τ = 100 × 10−12 × 1 × 103 = 100 ns
tPHL = 0.69τ = 0.69 × 100 = 69 ns
tf = 2.22τ = 2.2 × 100 = 220 ns
15.2 (a) Switch opens at time t = 0, thus
vO(0+) = 0 V. The capacitor then charges by a
constant current I, thus
It = CvO(t)
⇒vO(t) = I
C t
(b) For I = 1 mA and C = 10 pF the time t for
vO to reach 1 V can be found as
1 =
1 × 10−3
10 × 10−12 t
⇒t = 10−8 s = 10 ns
15.3 VOH = VDD
At t = 0, vI goes low and the transistor turns off
instantly, thus
vO(0+) = VOL
Now capacitor C charges through R toward
vO(∞) = VDD, thus
vO(t) = VDD −(VDD −VOL) e−t/τ
At t = tPLH,
vO = 1
2(VOL + VOH) = 1
2(VOL + VDD), thus
1
2(VOL + VDD) = VDD −(VDD −VOL)e−t/τ
⇒tPLH = 0.69τ
For R = 10 k and we wish to limit τPLH to 100
ps then the maximum value that C can have is
found from
0.69 × C × 10 × 103 = 100 × 10−12
⇒C = 1.45 × 10−14 F
= 14.5 fF
15.4 (a) VOL = 0 V
VOH = VDD = 1.2 V
NML = VIL −VOL = VDD
2
−0
= 0.6 V
NMH = VOH −VIH = VDD −VDD
2
= 0.6 V
(b) Capacitor C discharges through Ron of PD,
vO(0+) = VDD = 1.2 V
vO(∞) = 0 V
Thus,
vO(t) = VDDe−t/τ
⇒tPHL = 0.69τ
= 0.69 × 0.1 × 10−12 × 2 × 103
= 138 ps
(c) Here the capacitor charges through Ron of PU
toward VDD. Thus,
vO(0+) = 0, vO(∞) = VDD,
vO(t) = VDD(1 −e−t/τ)
At t = tPLH, vO(t) = VDD/2, thus
tPLH = 0.69τ
= 0.69 × 0.1 × 10−12 × 2 × 103
= 138 ps
Finally, we obtain τP as
τP = 1
2(tPLH + tPHL)
= 1
2(138 + 138) = 138 ps

To obtain tPLH, consider the situation in Fig. 1(a).
Here, PD has just opened (at t = 0), leaving
vO = 0 V at t = 0+. Capacitor C then charges
through the "on" resistance of the pull-up switch,
Ronu, toward VDD, thus
vO(t) = V∞−(V∞−V0+)e−t/τ
= VDD −(VDD −0)e−t/τ
= VDD(1 −e−t/τ)
At t = tPLH, vO = VDD/2, thus
VDD
2
= VDD(1 −e−tPLH/τ)
⇒e−tPLH/τ = 0.5
⇒tPLH = τ ln2 = 0.69τ
For C = 20 fF, Ronu = 2 k, then
tPLH = 0.69 × 20 × 10−15 × 2 × 103
= 27.6 ps
Next we determine tPHL by considering the
situation depicted in Fig. 1(b). Here, PU has just
opened, leaving vO(0+) = VDD. Capacitor C then
discharges through the on resistance of the
pull-down switch, Rond, toward 0 V, thus
vO(∞) = 0, thus
vO = 0 −(0 −VDD) e−t/τ
= VDDe−t/τ
At t = tPHL, vO = VDD/2 and we get
VDD
2
= VDDe−tPHL/τ
⇒tPHL = 0.69τ
Here,
τ = CRond
= 20 × 10−15 × 1 × 103 = 20 ps
Thus,
tPHL = 0.69 × 20 ≃13.8 ps
The propagation delay tP can now be obtained as
tP = 1
2(tPLH + tPHL)
= 1
2(27.6 + 13.8) = 20.7 ps
15.8 (a) tP = 1
2(tPLH + tPHL)
Since tP = 45 ps, then
tPLH + tPHL = 90 ps
(1)
Now, since Icharge is half Idischarge, then

Chapter 15–3
tPLH = 2tPHL
(2)
Using (1) together with (2) yields
tPLH = 60 ps
tPHL = 30 ps
(b) Since the propagation delay is directly
proportional to C, then the increase in
propagation delay by 50%, when the capacitance
is increased by 0.1 pF, indicates that the original
total capacitance is 0.2 pF.
(c) The reduction of propagation delays by 40%
when the load inverter is removed indicates that
the load inverter was contributing 40% of the
total capacitance found in (b), that is,
Cout = 0.12 pF
Cload = 0.08 pF

15.12 Refer to Example 15.2.
The method of average currents yields
tPHL = 15.0 ps
The method of equivalent resistance yields
tPHL = 27.6 ps
If the discrepancy is entirely due to the reduction
in current due to velocity saturation in the NMOS
transistor, then the factor by which the current
decreases is 15.0/27.6 = 0.54.
The value of tPLH does not change (in fact there is
a slight decrease due to various approxi-
mations). We may therefore conclude that the
effect of velocity saturation is minimal in the
PMOS transistor.

the extrinsic part by 40 ps. Now the original value
of the extrinsic part is
tP = 80 ×
45
45 + 15 = 60 ps
A reduction by 40 ps requires the use of a scale
factor S,
S = 3
This is the factor by which (W/L)n and (W/L)p
must be scaled. The inverter area will be
increased by the same ratio, that is, 3.
15.18 Figure 1 on the next page shows the
CMOS logic gate with the (W/L) ratios selected
so that the worst-case tPLH and tPHL are equal to
the corresponding values of the basic inverter
with (W/L)n = n and (W/L)p = p. Observe that
the worst case for discharging a capacitor occurs
through the three series transistors QNA, QNC, and
QND. To make the equivalent W/L for these three
series transistors equal to n, we select each of
their (W/L) ratios to be equal to 3n. Finally, for
the discharge path (QNA, QNB) to have an
equivalent W/L equal to n, we selected W/L of
QNB equal to 1.5n.
For the PUN, the worst-case charging path is that
through QPB and one of QPC or QPD. Thus we
select each of these three transistors to have

Figure 1 shows the circuit with the W/L ratio of
each of the eight transistors indicated. Observe
that the worst-case situation for both charging
and discharging is two transistors in series. To
achieve an equivalent W/L ratio for each path
equal to that of the corresponding transistor in the
basic inverter, each transistor is sized at twice
that of the inverter. Including the two inverters
required to obtain the complemented variable, the
area is
A = 2WnL + 2WpL + 4 × 2WnL + 4 × 2WpL
= 10L(Wn + Wp)
= 10 × 28(56 + 84)
= 39,200
15.20 (a) Examination of Eq. (15.19) reveals
that the NMOS transistors Q1 and Q3 contribute
Cn = 2 Cgd1 + Cdb1 + Cg3
(1)
and the PMOS transistors Q2 and Q4 contribute
Cp = 2 Cgd2 + Cdb2 + Cg4
(2)
The only difference in determining the
corresponding capacitances in Eqs. (1) and (2) is
the transistor width W. Thus each of the
components in Eq. (2) can be written as the
corresponding component in Eq. (1) multiplied
by (Wp/Wn). Overall, we can write
Cp = Cn

(e) (i) For Cw = 0, we have
Wp = Wn:
tP = 29.32 × 103Cn
Wp = 2.4 Wn: tP = 29.32 × 103Cn
Thus, in the case where C is entirely intrinsic,
scaling does not affect tP. This is what we found
in Eq. (15.26).
(ii) For Cw ≫Cn, we have
Wp = Wn:
tP = 14.66 × 103Cw
Wp = 2.4 Wn: tP = 8.625 × 103Cw
Here C is entirely extrinsic, thus scaling the
PMOS transistors has resulted in a decrease in tP.
We conclude that using a matched design reduces
tP only when C is dominated by external
capacitances. The matched design, of course, has
the drawback of increased area.

L = 0.90 nm, Wn = 180 nm, Wp = 360 nm,
n = 180/90, p = 360/90
(a) Circuit (a) uses a six-input NOR gate and one
inverter.
The six-input NOR requires:
6 NMOS transistors each with W/L = n
and
6 PMOS transistors each with W/L = 6p
The inverter requires
1 NMOS transistor with W/L = n
and
1 PMOS transistor with W/L = p
Thus,
Area = 6WnL + 6 × 6WpL + WnL + WpL
= L(7 Wn + 37 Wp)
= 90(7 × 180 + 37 × 360)
= 90 × 14, 510 = 1,305,900 nm2
(b) Circuit (b) uses two three-input NOR gates
and one two-input NAND gate.
Each three-input NOR gate requires
3 NMOS transistors, each with W/L = n
3 PMOS transistors, each with W/L = 3p
The two-input NAND gate requires
2 NMOS transistors, each with W/L = 2n
2 PMOS transistors, each with W/L = p
Thus,
Area = 2 × 3 × WnL + 2 × 3 × 3 × WpL
+ 2 × 2 × WnL + 2 × WpL
= L(10 Wn + 20 Wp)
= 90(10 × 180 + 20 × 360)
= 90 × 9000
= 810,000 nm2
Thus circuit (a) required 1305900/810000 = 1.61
times the area of circuit (b).
15.22 When the devices are sized as in Fig. 15.9,
tPLH that results when one PMOS transistor is
conducting (worst case) is
tPLH = 0.69RpC

For the case in which all p-channel devices have

Figure 1
Refer to the circuit in Fig. 1. For QNA and QNB,
(W/L) is equal to that of the NMOS transistor in
the basic matched inverter. Thus,
kNA = kNB = k
For QPA and QPB, (W/L) is equal to twice the
value of the PMOS transistor of the basic
matched inverter. Since for the matched inverter
kp = kn = k, here we have
kPA = kPB = 2k
(a) Figure 2 shows the circuit for the case input
A is grounded. Note that QNA will be cut-off and
has been eliminated. Switching will occur at
vI = V which will be near VDD/2. At this point,

QNB and QPB will be in saturation and QPA will be
in the triode region with a very small voltage VX
across it. All transistors will be conducting the
same current ID. For QPA we can write
ID = 2k

or
ID = k(1.3 VX −V2

(1)
For QPB we can write
ID = 1

or
ID = k(0.65 −VX −V)2
(2)
Finally, for QNB we can write
ID = 1
2k(V −0.35)2
(3)
Next, we solve Eqs. (2) and (3) together to obtain
VX in terms of V. Equating Eqs. (2) and (3) gives

(V −0.35) = 0.65 −VX −V
±0.707(V −0.35) = 0.65 −VX −V
(4)
First try the solution corresponding to the + sign
on the left-hand side of (4):
0.707(V −0.35) = 0.65 −VX −V
⇒VX = 0.897 −1.707 V
(5)
Since VX ≃0, this equation gives
V = 0.53 V
which is reasonable. The other solution gives
−0.707(V −0.35) = 0.65 −VX −V

⇒VX = 0.403 −0.293 V
For VX ≃0, this equation gives
V = 1.37 V
which is obviously impossible! Thus Eq. (5) is
the solution that is physically meaningful. Next
we substitute for VX. From Eq. (5) into Eq. (1) to
obtain
ID = k 1.3(0.897 −1.707 V) −k(0.897
−1.707 V)2
= k(0.361 + 0.843 V −2.914 V2)
(6)
Equating this value of ID to that in Eq. (3) gives
(V −0.35)2 = 2(0.361 + 0.843 V −2.914 V2)
⇒6.83 V2 −2.39 V −0.6 = 0
⇒V = 0.54 V
This is a reasonable value: It is greater than
(VDD/2), which is required since QNB has a
conductance parameter k while QPB has a
parameter 2k. Of course, VSG of QPB is smaller
than that of QNB because of VX. The latter,
however, is small. It can be found by substituting
for V = 0.54 in Eq. (5),
VX = 0.89 −1.707 × 0.54 ≈0 V
(b) Figure 3 shows the circuit when the
corresponding input terminals are connected
together. The two parallel NMOS transistors can
be replaced by an equivalent NMOS transistor
QNE having a W/L = 2n and thus a
transconductance parameter 2k. The two series
PMOS transistors can be replaced by an
equivalent PMOS transistor QPE having a
W/L = (2p/2) = p and thus a transconductance
parameter k. We are now ready to determine the
threshold voltage, denoted V as before. Here,
both QNE and QPE will be operating in saturation
and conducting a current ID. Thus, for QPE we
can write
ID = 1
2k(VDD −V −0.35)2
or
ID = 1
2k(0.65 −V)2
(7)
and for QNE, we can write
ID = 1
2 × 2k(V −0.35)2
or
ID = k(V −0.35)2
(8)
The value of V can be obtained by solving (7) and
(8) together. Equating (7) and (8) gives
1
2(0.65 −V)2 = (V −0.35)2
One solution is
⇒
1
√
2
(0.65 −V) = V −0.35
⇒V = 0.47 V
This is a reasonable, physically meaningful
answer and thus there is no need to find the other
solution. As expected, V is lower than (VDD/2),
which is a result of the fact that QNE has a larger
(twice as large) transconductance parameter than

QPE. Thus, QNE needs a smaller VGS that VSG of
QPE to provide an equal ID.
15.24 (a) Refer to Fig. 15.11(c). By inspection
we see that
tP = τ1 + τ2 + ... + τn−1 + τn

To obtain the value of x for optimum
performance, we combine the two optimality

ln x = 1
⇒x = e
Q.E.D.
15.25 (a) n = 4
Minimum delay is obtained when the scaling
factor x is given by
xn = CL
C
Here,
x4 = 1600C
C
= 1600
⇒x = 6.32
tP = 4xCR
= 4 × 6.32CR = 25.3CR
(b) Let the number of the inverters be n.
Optimum performance is obtained when
xn = CL
C = 1600
and
x = e = 2.718
n = ln 1600
ln e
= 7.4 ≃7
Thus, we use 7 inverters. The actual scaling
factor required can be found from
x7 = 1600
⇒x = (1600)1/7 = 2.87
The value of tP realized will be
tP = 7 × 2.87CR
= 20.1CR
which represents a reduction in tP by about
20.6%. Thus adding three inverters reduces the
delay by 20.6%.
15.26 E = CV2
DD
= 10 × 10−15 × 1.82 = 32.4 fJ
For 2 × 106 inverters switched at f = 1 GHz,

= 64.8 W
IDD = PD
VDD

1.8 = 36 A
15.27 (a) The currents decrease by a factor of
1.2
1.8 = 0.67; that is, the new current values are
0.67 of the old current values. However, the
voltage swing is also reduced by the same factor.
The result is that tP remains unchanged. The PDP
will be reduced by a factor of 0.44.
Since the maximum operating frequency is
proportional to 1/tP, it also will remain
unchanged.
(b) If current is proportional to V2
DD, the currents
become 0.672 of their old values. This together
with the reduction of voltage swing by a factor of
0.67 will result in tP increasing by a factor of
(1/0.67) and the maximum operating frequency
being reduced by a factor of 0.67. The PDP
decreases by a factor of 0.67.
15.28 Each cycle, the inverter draws an average
current of

Chapter 15–11
Since Iav = 150 µA, then the average current
corresponding to the dynamic power dissipation
is 120 µA. Thus,
Pdyn = 3.3 × 120 × 10−6 = 396 µW
But,
Pdyn = fCV2
DD
Thus,
396 × 10−6 = 100 × 106 × 3.32 × C
⇒C = 0.36 pF
15.29 Pdyn = fCV2

DD, reducing
the power supply from 1.2 V to 1.0 V reduces the
power dissipation by a factor of

1.2
2
= 0.694.
The power dissipation now becomes
0.694 × 10 = 6.94 mW. Since
Pdyn is proportional to f, reducing f by the same
factor as the supply voltage (0.83) results in
reducing the power dissipation further by a factor
of 0.83, i.e.,
Additional savings in power = (1 −0.83) × 6.94

after the switch closes (t = 0+). At this instant
the capacitor voltage in VOH. The capacitor then
discharges and eventually reaches the low level

that in Fig. 2(b). Using this circuit, we can
express vO as

(e) For VDD = 1.8 V and C = 2 pF, we have

Thus, ID will range from 0.184 mA to 0.216 mA

Thus, the discharge time ranges from 46.3 ps to

Our decoder is an extension of that shown:
We have M bits is the address (as opposed to 3)

Now, each of the 2Mword lines is connected to M
NMOS devices and to one PMOS transistor. Thus
the total number of devices required is
M2M (NMOS) + 2M (PMOS)
= 2M (M + 1)
Ex: 16.13 Refer to Fig. 16.38: Our tree decoder
will have 2N bit lines. Thus it will have N levels:
At the first levels there will be 2 transistors, at the
second 22,. . . , at the Nth level there will be 2N

Refer to Fig. 16.11(b) and to Fig. 1 on the next
page. Figure 1(a) shows vX versus vW and Fig.
1(b) shows vZ versus vX. Both of these VTCs are
identical with a gain in the transition region of −6
V/V. The equation of the linear transition region
in Fig. 1(a) is
vX = −6(vW −0.6) + 0.6
(1)
for
0.5 V ≤vX ≤0.7 V
The two VTCs in Figs. 1(a) and (b) can be used
to obtain the VTC of the cascade of the two
inverters, that is, vZ versus vW, which is shown in
Figure 1(c). The slope at the midpoint, point C in
Fig. 1(c), is −6 × −6 = 36 V/V. The two
switching points, at vW = 0.583 V and 0.617 V,
can be determined using Eq. (1) and setting
vX = VIL or VIH. The width of the transition
region is 0.617 −0.583 = 0.033 V. This value
can also be obtained from 1.2 V/36 V/V
= 0.033 V.
Finally, we show in Fig. 1(c) the three points
A, B, C:
A (0 V, 0 V); B (0.6 V, 0.6 V), C (1.2 V, 1.2 V)

(a) When φ is high, the transmission gate is
conducting (i.e., Q5 and Q6 are conducting) and
the line D is connected to the input terminal of
G2. Thus Q = D and Q = D. The two feedback
loops around G2 are open because although Q1 or
Q4 can conduct (if D = 1 and thus Q = 0, Q1 can
conduct while if D = 0 and thus Q = 1, Q4 can
conduct) their conduction paths are blocked by
Q2 and Q3 which remain cut off when φ is high.
(b) If D is high, then Q is low and Q is high.
Now, if φ goes low, the transmission gate turns
off, thus the input of G2 is isolated from D. The
high value at the gate of G2 is maintained by the
feedback loop around G2 consisting of Q1 and Q2,
both of which conduct, thus connecting the input
node of G2 to VDD. Meanwhile, Q3 and Q4 are at
cut off.
(c) If D is low, then the voltage at the input of G2
will be low (0 V) and thus Q will be high and Q

will be low. When φ goes low, the transmission
gate turns off and the input node of G2 is isolated
from D. The low voltage at the input node of G2
is maintained by the feedback loop around G2
consisting of Q3 and Q4, both of which conduct.
Meanwhile, Q1 and Q2 are cut off.
(d) No. The circuit connects either VDD or ground
directly to the input of G2 which establishes the
value of Q and Q. When φ goes low, a feedback
loop closes around G2, thus locking in the value
of Q (equal to D) and thus Q (equal to D).
16.18 Figure 1 on the next page shows the
equivalence of a NAND gate to an OR gate with
inverters at the inputs. We can use this
equivalence to derive an SR flip-flop utilizing
two cross-coupled NAND gates starting from the
one utilizing NOR gates, as shown in Fig. 2 (next
page).

reset the flip-flop, R is lowered to zero, resulting
in Qn+1 = 0. The situation with both R and S
lowered to zero results in an undefined output and
is thus avoided.

circuit in Fig. 16.14(a) to fall from VDD to VDD/2,
where VDD/2 is the threshold voltage of the
inverter formed by Q3 and Q4 in Fig. 16.15.
The second component is the time for the output
of the Q3 −Q4 inverter to rise from 0 to VDD/2.
We will denote the first component tPHL and the
second tPLH.
To determine tPHL refer to the circuit in
Fig. 16.19. The capacitor discharge current iC is
iC = iDeq −iD2
To determine the average value of iC, we
calculate iDeq and iD2 at t = 0 and t = tPHL. At
t = 0, vQ = VDD, thus Q2 is off,
iD2(0) = 0
and Qeq is in saturation,
iDeq = 1
2 × 500 × 1
2 × 0.8
0.13 × (1.2 −0.4)2
= 492.3 µA
Thus,
iC(0) = 492.3 −0 = 429.3 µA
At t = tPHL, vQ = VDD/2, thus both Q2 and Qeq
will be in the triode region,

Thus,
iC(tPHL) = 461.5 −230.8 = 230.7 µA
and the average value of iC over the interval t = 0
to t = tPHL is
iC|av = iC(0) + iC(tPHL)

= 429.3 + 230.7

tPHL = C(VDD/2)

= 27.3 ps
Next we determine the time tPLH for the output of
the Q3 −Q4 inverter, vQ, to rise from 0 to VDD/2.
For this purpose we use an equation from
Example 16.2,
tPLH =

As noted, this fully complementary circuit uses

which Q10 and Q12 are omitted.
Note further that an effective 9-T version exists in
which Q6 and Q8 are moved below Q5 and Q7,
then merged into a single grounded-source
device. Note that all of the designs can employ
the latter idea to reduce the transistor count by 1.

maximum CB increases by a factor of 4. Thus, the
number of cells can be increased approximately
by a factor of 4 to 4096 bits, requiring two more

Figure 1
The relevant part of the circuit is shown in Fig. 1.
It is assumed that Q = 0, that is, initially vQ =
0 V. Also it is assumed that the B line voltage is
VDD. When the word line is selected and the gate
of Q6 is pulled to VDD volts, Q6 conducts and
operates in the saturation region. Its current I6
charges CQ whose voltage vQ rises from 0 V and
thus Q3 conducts and operates in the triode
region. Current I6, in addition to charging CQ,
also supplies a current equal to I3. Equilibrium is
reached at the value of VQ that makes I3 equal to
I6 and thus CQ stops charging. The design is
based on VQ being sufficiently small to prevent
the latch from changing state (nondestructive
readout). Usually, one imposes the condition that
VQ ≤Vtn.
The operation of the circuit is described by
equations identical to (16.20)–(16.27) except for
(W/L)5 replaced with (W/L)6 and (W/L)1
replaced with (W/L)3. The graph in Fig. 16.23
applies here also with the same changes
mentioned. Finally, Eq. (16.27) provides the
constraint on the (W/L) ratios that results if VQ is
to be less or equal to Vtn.

Initially, the cell is storing a zero, thus vQ = VDD
and vQ = 0 V. To write a 1, we lower the B line
0 V and select the cell by raising the word line
(the voltage at the gate of the access transistor Q5)
to VDD. We assume that the voltage at the gate of
Q2 (which is vQ) will remain low for a while.
Transistor Q5 will conduct and its current I5 will
discharge the small capacitor CQ and vQ will
decrease. This will allow Q2 to conduct.
This process continues until vQ is pulled to the
threshold voltage of transistor Q3 which causes
the latch to toggle. That is, equilibrium will be
reached when
VQ = Vtn
and,
I2 = I5
At this point, Q2 will be operating at the edge of
saturation and its current will be given by Eq.
(16.26) with I4 replaced by I2 and (W/L)4
replaced by (W/L)2. Simultaneously, Q5 will be
operating in the triode region and and its current
will be given by Eq. (16.29) with I6 replaced by
I5, (W/L)6 replaced by (W/L)3, and VQ replaced
by VQ.
It follows that the process for writing a 1 is
similar to that for writing a 0, and the condition
on the (W/L) ratios will be identical to that in Eq.
(16.31).

16.40 We need four inverters to implement the
0.8-ns delay block.
16.41 Since 210 = 1024, there are 10 address
bits.
The decoder has 1024 output lines. The NOR
array requires 20 input lines (for the 10 address
bits and their complements).
Each output line has one PMOS transistor; for a
total of 1024 PMOS transistors.
Each output line has 10 NMOS transistors for a
total of 1024 × 10 = 10, 240 NMOS transistors.
The total number of NMOS and PMOS
transistors is 11,264.
16.42 In a 1-Mbit-square array, there are 1024
columns, requiring 10 address bits.
1024 NMOS pass transistors are needed in the
multiplexer. The NOR decoder has 1024 output
lines; each output line has one PMOS transistor,
for a total of 1024 PMOS transistors. Each output
line has 10 NMOS transistors, for a total 10,240
NMOS transistors. Total number of transistors
= 1024 + 1024 + 10, 240 = 12,288
16.43 A square 1-Mbit array has 1024 columns,
requiring 10 address bits. Ten levels of pass gates
are required.
Using the expression given to the answer of
Exercise 16.12, we have
Total number of transistors = 2(2N −1)
= 2(210 −1) = 2046
16.44 The value of Gm is given by
Gm = gmn + gmp
Since the inverters have a matched design, then
gmn = gmp
and
gmn = μnCox

Thus,
Gm = 0.4 mA/V
Assume a read 1 operation,
vB = 0.5VDD + △V(1)e(Gm/CB)t
Thus,
0.9VDD = 0.5VDD + △V(1)e(Gm/CB)t
0.4VDD
△V(1) = e(Gm/CB)t1
⇒△V(1) = 0.4VDDe−(Gm/CB)td
(1)
Substituting VDD = 1.2 V, Gm = 0.4 mA/V,
CB = 0.4 pF, and td = 1 ns, we obtain
△V(1) = 0.177 V
Thus the signal between the B and B lines is
2△V(1) = 0.353 V = 353 mV
If the time can be relaxed by 1 ns, then t1 = 2 ns
and
△V(1) = 0.065 V
and the required signal between the B and B
becomes
2△V(1) = 130 mV
If instead we have △V(1) = 0.177 V and
t1 = 2 ns, we can see from Eq. (1) that CB can be
increased by the same factor t1 is increased, that
is, by a factor of 2. Thus CB can become
CB = 2 × 0.4 = 0.8 pF
Thus the bit line length can be increased by
100%, i.e., doubled. Doubling the length of the
bit line will double the delay time required to
charge the bit-line capacitance to 4 ns.

Q.E.D.
(1)
An identical expression can be obtained for the
case a 0 is being read.
(b) If td is to be reduced to one-half its original
value, Gm must be increased by a factor of 2. This
can be achieved by doubling the width of all
transistors (because gmn and gmb are proportional
to (W/L)n and (W/L)p, respectively).
(c) Consider Eq. (1) in two situations: (1)
△V = 0.2 V and Gm = Gm1, (2) △V = 0.1 V and
Gm = Gm2. If in both cases the same value of td
results, then

To increase Gm by a factor of 1.44, the widths of
all transistors must be increased by a factor
of 1.44.
