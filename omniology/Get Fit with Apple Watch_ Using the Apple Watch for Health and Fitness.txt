Introduction
If you are like me, you are willing to put in some time and effort to maintain 
good health and even increase your level of fitness. However, it’s hard to 
maintain the discipline to take the necessary actions day in and day out, 
over the long haul. It’s too easy to fill up the day with necessary activities 
such that when evening rolls around it’s too late to fit in the exercise that you 
know you should do.
Fitness trackers can help to keep you motivated for a while, but when the 
novelty wears off, most of them find themselves in the back of a drawer. To 
be a consistent aid to maintaining fitness, a wearable device must be more 
than just a fitness tracker. This is where the Apple Watch really shows its 
value. Yes, it is a fitness tracker, but it is also much more than that. It is an 
elegant premium timepiece and a supremely convenient communication 
device. It also has some unique features that you cannot get with any other 
device, wearable or not.
In the first several short chapters of this book I will provide a brief 
introduction to the general features of the Apple Watch and how to use 
them. I will then move into the real subject area of the book: how to use the 
Apple Watch to help you to maintain good health and improve your physical 
fitness, day in and day out, over a period of months and years. The Apple 
Watch is an appropriate accessory at the opera or ballet just as much as it is 
at the gym or out on the trail.
The Apple Watch contains a comprehensive suite of built-in applications that 
perform many of the functions that people are accustomed to performing on 
their smartphones. The Apple Watch serves as an extension of a person’s 
iPhone that eliminates the need to rummage around in a purse or reach into 
a pocket to pull it out and then unlock. In addition to the built-in apps, the 
Apple Watch is supported by several thousand third-party apps that run 
on your iPhone and are ported via either Bluetooth or Wi-Fi directly to your

watch. A number of these apps deal with health and fitness, enabling watch 
wearers to tailor their daily, weekly, and monthly exercise programs to their 
own individual needs.
The Apple Watch sounds the opening bell to a new era, when wearable 
technology truly enters the mainstream. There may be no better way to 
appreciate where the future is flowing to than to experience the Apple Watch 
for yourself.

Part I
Apple Watch Basic Facts

3
Chapter 1
Common Features
The Apple Watch comes in three collections, aimed at three different 
audiences and with three different price points. Within these collections, 
you can buy the Apple Watch in 38 different configurations. Despite these 
differences, which I will discuss in Chapter 2, the three collections have 
much in common. The functional hardware, the software, and the physical 
dimensions are the same among all three.
Case Dimensions
People come in all sizes, and that variability extends to wrists. Wrist size 
does not necessarily have anything to do with gender. Apple Watch cases 
come in two sizes: a smaller one with a height of 38mm and width of 
33.3mm and a larger one with a height of 42mm and a width of 35.9mm. 
People with smaller wrists will likely find the 38mm model more comfortable. 
It also weighs a little less than the 42mm model does, which may make a 
difference to marathon runners and others who move their arms a lot in the 
course of a day. The 42mm model will likely be preferred by people with 
larger wrists or those who want the largest display size available.
Digital Crown
Mechanical watches have had crowns longer than wristwatches have 
existed. Pocket watches, such as the one Abraham Lincoln wore, have 
crowns too. The crown of a mechanical wristwatch is a little wheel on the 
side that you turn to “wind” the watch. Winding turns the spring that powers 
the clockwork mechanism that causes the movement to advance the hands 
on the dial as time passes. This type of crown is strictly an analog device.

CHAPTER 1: Common Features
4
Of course, the Apple Watch does not have a mechanical movement and 
thus does not need to be wound. Nonetheless, people have come to 
expect watches to have crowns, and since the Apple Watch is really more 
of a computer than it is a watch, there needs to be some way to control 
its functions. One way to do that is using the touch-sensitive display, but 
another way is to give control functionality to a digital crown.
With the crown on a mechanical watch, you can do two things: set the 
hands to the desired time and wind the spring. With the digital crown on the 
Apple Watch, you can do three things: scroll to navigate across the display, 
zoom in or out, and tap to return to the previous screen.
With the Apple Watch on the left wrist (which is where most right-handed 
people will put it), the digital crown is on the right side of the watch from the 
vantage point of the wearer. Left-handers, on the other hand (pun intended), 
usually prefer to put their watch on the right wrist, where it is less likely to 
interfere with what they are doing with their dominant left hand. Apple handles 
this in a way that no traditional watch could. When setting up the watch, left 
handers can flip the display 180 degrees, making it easy for them to place the 
watch on their right wrist and operate the digital crown with their dominant left 
hand. An additional benefit of locating the watch on the nondominant wrist is 
that the touchscreen display can be manipulated with the dominant hand.
Retina Display, Gestures, and Force Touch
Steve Jobs introduced the Retina Display when he unveiled iPhone 4. He 
gave it a special name because the pixel density, and thus the resolution, 
of the display was greater than on previous Apple products. On the 38mm 
Apple Watch, the pixel density is 290 pixels per inch, and the display 
resolution is 272×340. The display on the 42mm model is a little bit sharper, 
with 302 pixels per inch and a resolution of 312×390. At these values, the 
sharpness of the display on both Apple Watch models is not quite up to that 
of an iPhone but is close.
The Apple Watch display responds to touch in much the same way that an 
iPhone does.
 Taps indicate selection or some other action, which 
depends on the active app.
 Vertical swipes scroll the current screen either up or down.
 Horizontal swipes move to either the previous or next 
page, assuming the app being displayed has a page-
based interface.
 Left-edge swipes navigate back to where you  
came from.

CHAPTER 1: Common Features
5
The one difference between the touch capabilities of the Apple Watch and 
iPhones is that pinches are not supported on the Apple Watch.
Force Touch adds a new dimension to the touch-sensing capabilities of 
the Apple Watch. It detects the amount of force applied by a user’s finger. 
When a press with significant force is applied, the currently running app may 
display a screen with options, such as to exit or pause the current activity.
Heart-Rate Sensor
People interested in improving their health know that exercise is important. 
What they may not know is how much exercise is the right amount for the 
fitness goals that they have set for themselves. Those who are trying to 
improve their health by losing weight will have different requirements from 
elite athletes who are trying to get the absolute maximum performance 
out of their bodies. One way to gauge how hard your body is working is to 
monitor your heart rate in terms of beats per minute. You want your heart 
rate to be high enough to move you toward your fitness goal, but not so high 
as to be a risk.
For several years athletes have been monitoring their heart rate by strapping a 
sensor to their chest, which transmits heart-rate readings to their smartphones 
via a Bluetooth connection. These straps are not very comfortable to wear 
and do not give immediate feedback on the fly because it’s not a good idea to 
be looking at your phone while you are running or biking.
On the other hand, a quick glance at your Apple Watch can be done 
frequently without problems. The Apple Watch monitors blood flow in your 
wrist to determine heart rate. By glancing at your Apple Watch periodically 
while exercising, you can modify your pace or exertion level to match what 
you are trying to achieve.
Accelerometer
An accelerometer is an instrument that detects a change in motion. This 
could be from standing still to running, or it could be from changing direction 
while you are moving. It can be used to track movement in places where 
GPS location services are not available. The accelerometer in the Apple 
Watch is a key component of the system that records your movements. That 
information gets translated by software into meaningful fitness information, 
such as distance traveled and pace.

CHAPTER 1: Common Features
6
Gyroscope
A gyroscope is an instrument that detects motion but in a different way from 
the way the accelerometer works. It detects rotation around an axis. For 
example, when you lift your wrist to glance at your watch, it is the gyroscope 
that recognizes what you are doing and signals the processor to activate the 
display. There is no point in running the watch’s battery down, powering the 
display when you are not looking at it.
Taken together, the accelerometer, the gyroscope, and the GPS functionality 
in your companion iPhone give you accurate information about where you 
are, where you have been, and where you are headed.
Ambient Light Sensor
The readability of a watch is going to be quite different on a sunny afternoon 
than it would be on a moonless night. In spite of that, you are going to want 
to read it easily in both cases and everywhere in between. To address this 
challenge, Apple has included an ambient light sensor in the Apple Watch. If 
it senses that the display has to compete with bright sunlight, it will crank up 
the luminosity. On the moonless night, your dark-adapted eyes don’t need 
as much pixel power but still need some. Ordinary indoor lighting requires a 
moderate amount of light. Software in the watch will determine the optimal 
display power level based on the amount of light detected by the ambient 
light sensor.
Speaker and Microphone
The Apple Watch has both a speaker and a microphone, so you can talk to 
Siri, Dick Tracy–style, with the watch up in front of your mouth. When Siri 
responds, you will be able to hear what she has to say. For a quick answer 
to a question that occurs to you, this beats pulling out and unlocking your 
phone, hands down (er, I guess at least one hand is up—the one attached to 
the watch you are talking into).
Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi is supported. This means that when you are within range of a Wi-Fi 
hotspot, you can communicate with any of your other devices, such as your 
iPhone, that are also within range of that hotspot. When you are at home, 
within range of your wireless router, you don’t have to carry your iPhone 
around. Your watch will link to it and enable you to make and receive calls 
right from your watch.

CHAPTER 1: Common Features
7
Bluetooth
The Apple Watch supports Bluetooth 4.0, which is the mechanism that 
it uses to communicate with its paired iPhone. It can also be used to 
communicate with other Bluetooth-enabled devices, assuming you have the 
apps designed to connect to the devices you want to communicate with.
Water Resistance
The Apple Watch is water-resistant rather than being waterproof. It’s pretty 
hard to waterproof a device that has a speaker and microphone, which 
would not react well to being immersed. However, if you are out in the 
rain and get a little water on the watch face, that should not be a cause 
for concern. Of course, you should take reasonable steps to minimize 
your Apple Watch’s exposure to water, as well as anything that might 
compromise the integrity of the watch case, such as dropping the watch on 
a hard surface.
Magnetic Battery Charger Cable
Although the Apple Watch claims to be water resistant, it is still a good idea 
to protect its innards as much as possible from liquid spills. That means 
you want to have as few ports of entry into its insides as possible. For this 
reason, Apple opted not to recharge its battery through a micro-USB port 
but rather with an inductive charger. The charging cable that comes with the 
watch attaches magnetically to the backside of the watch and terminates in 
a USB connector. You can recharge the watch by plugging the charger cable 
either into a powered device that has a USB port, such as a laptop, or into a 
USB power adapter.
USB Power Adapter
The USB power adapter is the same device you use to recharge your 
iPhone. It converts alternating current wall power to direct current at a 
voltage that the watch is designed to accept.

CHAPTER 1: Common Features
8
Quick Start Guide
The Apple Watch is a sophisticated device with a lot of capability. Getting 
the full value out of it will take some time and experimentation. To help you 
come up to speed as quickly as possible, a Quick Start Guide is included in 
the box your Apple Watch comes in.
Summary
Regardless of which of the 38 different configurations of the Apple Watch 
that you buy, you are getting a lot of capability in a compact package that 
is handily located on your wrist. All the functionality that is present on the 
top-of-the-line gold Apple Watch Edition is also present on the lowest-cost 
Apple Watch Sport. That being the case, what are the differences between 
the three collections and the different models within each collection? That is 
what Chapter 2 is about.

Chapter 2
The Collections
Watches mean different things to different people. Some people consider a 
watch as just a convenient way to find out what time it is. Others consider 
it a fashion statement, and still others consider it to be a piece of jewelry 
that also happens to tell time. Smartwatch owners also have different 
expectations of what their watch will do for them. Apple was aware of the 
differences in what people are looking for in a smartwatch, and as a result, 
Apple offers three different families of the Apple Watch, each of which is 
called a Collection. Each Collection differs from the other Collections in the 
materials the watches are made of and in the bands that are offered.
All three families offer the same sizes of watch case: 42mm for larger wrists 
and 38mm for smaller wrists. As you would expect, the 38mm models 
feature fewer pixels on somewhat smaller faces. All the watches in all the 
Collections have the same functionality, regardless of case size or price. As 
you saw in Chapter 1, these features include the following:
 Digital crown
 Retina Display with Force Touch
 Heart-rate sensor
 Accelerometer
 Gyroscope
 Ambient light sensor
 Speaker
 Microphone
 Wi-Fi (802.11b/g/n), 2.4GHz

CHAPTER 2: The Collections
10
 Bluetooth 4.0
 Up to 18 hours of battery life
 Water resistance
The sensors and communication features enable a wide variety of useful 
functions to be performed by the many apps that continue to be written 
by third parties who desire access to the Apple Watch customer base. In 
Chapter 9, I will discuss a number of third-party apps that specifically relate 
to health and fitness.
The Three Collections
Apple has released the Apple Watch in three distinct families, called 
Collections, that differ from each other in target audience, appearance, 
options, and price. High quality in design as well as in form and finish are 
a top priority for all three Collections. However, all the models within a 
Collection are optimized for their particular audience.
 The Apple Watch Collection is designed for people who 
value elegance and appearance as well as functionality.
 The Apple Watch Sport Collection is aimed at people 
who will be wearing their watch during vigorous 
exercise, such as running or cycling. Functionality and 
lightweight are perhaps more important to these people.
 The Apple Watch Edition Collection is for people who 
want the best, most exclusive accessories and are 
willing to pay for them.
The watch faces in all three collections are rectangular with rounded 
corners. The screen resolution of the 42mm model is 390x312 pixels, and 
the resolution of the 38mm model is 340x272 pixels. Apple calls the display 
a Retina Display, which is also how iPhone displays are designated.
The Apple Watch Collection
The Apple Watch is designed for all-day wear. You could wear it on an 
early-morning run, later at the office, and in the evening at the opera. It 
contains all the health and fitness functionality of the watches in the Apple 
Watch Sport collection but in a package that conveys an impression of 
sophisticated elegance.

CHAPTER 2: The Collections

The Case
The case is constructed out of either highly polished stainless steel or 
space-black stainless steel. The steel is a refined 316L alloy that is cold 
forged to make it 80 percent harder than ordinary stainless steel. The casing 
is polished to a mirror finish. The space-black version has an additional layer 
of diamond-like carbon (DLC) that gives the case a distinctive look.
The Crystal
The crystal face of the Apple Watch really is a crystal, rather than some 
kind of glass. It is pure crystalline sapphire, which except for diamond is 
the hardest transparent material on Earth. The hardness provides the best 
scratch resistance available, short of having a pure diamond crystal watch 
face. However, it is also more brittle than the Ion-X glass used on the Apple 
Watch Sport, making it more prone to shattering if it suffers a hard blow, as 
it might in some intensive sports.
The Bands
Bands are made from three different materials: top-grain leathers, durable 
fluoroelastomer, or the same stainless steel used in the cases. Three distinct 
varieties of leather band are available, along with two kinds of steel band 
and one kind of fluoroelastomer band.
In addition to the different material available, there are also color choices. 
The leather loop comes in stone, light brown, bright blue, and black. These 
bands are handcrafted from Venezia leather in Arzignano, Italy, at a tannery 
with a history that spans five generations. Concealed magnets enable the 
wearer to wrap the band around the wrist for a precise fit.
The classic buckle, available only in black, is milled at the ECCO tannery in the 
Netherlands. The closure is a stainless steel buckle of traditional design. The 
classic buckle weighs less than any of the other bands that Apple offers. 
The combination of the stainless steel Apple Watch and the classic buckle 
actually weighs less than the Apple Watch Sport’s aluminum case with any 
of the fluoroelastomer bands available with that watch.
The modern buckle comes in soft pink, brown, midnight blue, and black. 
Produced at a French tannery with a history that goes back more than 200 
years, it has a sleek look and a two-piece magnetic closure, as well as an 
inner layer of Vectran for strength and stretch resistance.
The fluorelastomer bands are made out of the same material as the bands 
used by the Apple Watch Sport Collection. In the Apple Watch Collection, 
the fluorelastomer band is available in white and black. It is soft on the skin 
but strong and has a pin-and-tuck closure.

CHAPTER 2: The Collections
12
The link bracelet, crafted out of the same 316L stainless steel alloy as the 
Apple Watch case, is comprised of more than 100 components. Attention 
to detail is evident in both the design and the finish. It features a butterfly 
closure and gives you the ability to add or remove links for a perfect fit. 
Stainless steel and space-black stainless steel versions are offered.
The Milanese loop is a new interpretation of the classic design developed in 
Milan at the end of the 19th century. It is a woven stainless steel mesh that 
loops around, with a magnetic closure, thus assuring that the band fits the 
wearer’s wrist exactly. In keeping with the band that inspired it, the Milanese 
loop comes in only one color, stainless steel.
The Apple Watch Sport Collection
If your primary reason for getting an Apple Watch is to help you improve 
your health and fitness, the Apple Watch Sport may be the one for you. 
Because the case is an aluminum alloy rather than stainless steel or gold, 
the Apple Watch Sport is somewhat lighter than most of the Apple Watch 
models and all the Apple Watch Edition models. Also, if you’re going to be 
wearing your watch during intensive workouts, you may not want to subject 
an exclusive Apple Watch Edition to that kind of environment.
The Case
The case of the Apple Watch Sport is made from an aluminum alloy 
that is 60 percent stronger than traditional aluminum alloys, enhancing 
scratch resistance while maintaining a light weight on the wrist. The case 
is available in two colors, silver and space gray. As you would expect, 
the aluminum case is lighter than the stainless steel case of the Apple 
Watch and also lighter than the gold case of the Apple Watch Edition. For 
people running a marathon or some equally challenging endurance sport, 
that small difference in weight becomes more and more significant as the 
workout or race continues.
The Crystal
For this watch, the crystal is not actually crystal. It is Ion-X glass, which is 
similar to Corning’s famous Gorilla Glass. It is likely not quite as scratch 
resistant as sapphire, but more importantly for people engaged in active or 
even extreme sports, it is a good deal more shatter-resistant. It will bend 
before it will break.

CHAPTER 2: The Collections
13
The Bands
For the Sport model, only one type of band is offered, the fluoroelastomer 
band that is also offered on the Apple Watch and the Apple Watch Edition. 
Five colors are offered with the Apple Watch Sport: white, blue, green, pink, 
and black. Although the different color bands are all made of the same 
material, they do not all weigh the same. This may matter for athletes who 
want to encumber their bodies with the absolute minimum weight during a 
competition. The black band weighs the least at 37 grams, and the white 
one weighs the most at 47 grams. The lightest “official” Apple Watch band, 
however, is not offered with the Apple Watch Sport. It is the classic buckle 
band offered with the Apple Watch. At 19 grams, it is about half the weight 
of the lightest band that comes standard with the Apple Watch Sport. If you 
are determined to minimize the weight of your Apple Watch, you are advised 
to purchase an Apple Watch Sport along with an extra classic buckle from 
the Apple Watch Collection.
The Apple Watch Edition Collection
The Apple Watch Edition is clearly for people who value exclusivity and 
elegance more than price. Edition Collection prices are such that only a limited 
number of people will be able to afford having a watch from this collection.
The Case
The case of the Apple Watch Edition is made from one of two different 
18-karat gold alloys, one yellow gold and the other rose gold, formulated for 
hardness to resist scratches and other vicissitudes of everyday wear. The 
Apple Watch Edition is a premium product in every way, and the smooth 
lines and mirror polish of the gold case are outstanding examples of fine 
craftsmanship.
The Crystal
As is the case with the stainless steel Apple Watch, the crystal face of the 
Apple Watch Edition is pure crystalline sapphire, which except for diamond 
is the hardest transparent material on Earth. The hardness provides the best 
scratch resistance available, short of having a pure-diamond crystal watch 
face. However, it is also more brittle than the Ion-X glass used on the Apple 
Watch Sport, making it more prone to shattering if it suffers a hard blow, 
as it might in some intensive sports. I don’t expect too many people to be 
wearing their Apple Watch Edition during intensive sports.

CHAPTER 2: The Collections
14
The Bands
For the Edition watches, bands are color coordinated with the cases.  
The white sport band is paired with the rose gold case, and the black sport 
band is paired with the yellow gold case. The black classic buckle and the 
midnight blue classic buckle are both paired with the yellow gold case.  
The rose gray modern buckle forms a nice complement to the rose gold 
case, and the bright red modern buckle goes well with the yellow gold case. 
Of course, if you want a different case/band combination, you can purchase 
additional bands separately.
Apple Watch Functions That Require an 
iPhone
The Apple Watch is a marvel of miniaturization, packing amazing 
functionality into a small package. However, the smallness of that package 
means that some functions that are routinely performed by smartphones 
will not fit into a watch strapped to a person’s wrist. A Bluetooth wireless 
connection between the Apple Watch and an iPhone 5 or newer with at least 
iOS 8.2 makes the power of the iPhone available instantly by a quick glance 
at an upturned wrist.
There are, of course, a number of functions that the Apple Watch can 
perform all by itself. However, there are also things that you probably have 
become accustomed to your iPhone providing, which still require that you are 
carrying your iPhone when you access those functions through your watch.
For the initial release of the Apple Watch, running the watchOS 1 operating 
system, any function that requires Internet access will work only when your 
iPhone is within Bluetooth range of your Apple Watch. If you have updated 
your watch to watchOS 2, it will connect to the Internet directly, provided 
you are logged in to and within range of a Wi-Fi network. Phone calls and 
GPS will still require that the iPhone that is paired with your Apple Watch be 
nearby. This means that when you are out on a run without your iPhone, the 
Apple Watch will still be able to display your pulse rate, the number of steps 
you take, the distance traveled, and the calories burned. It will not, however, 
be able to show you the route you have run, unless the course you run is 
completely covered by Wi-Fi. Siri will be able to talk to you, but she will be 
able to perform any tasks for you that require Internet access only if you are 
within range of a Wi-Fi network.

CHAPTER 2: The Collections
15
Health and Fitness Applications of Apple Watch 
That Do Not Require an iPhone
While you are out on that run, monitoring your pulse rate, calories burned, 
and other variables, you will also be able to listen to the music stored on 
your Apple Watch. A set of Bluetooth headphones will convey the music 
from your watch to your ears with high-fidelity stereo sound. The main 
things you will miss while out without your iPhone and out of Wi-Fi range are 
messages, notifications, and alerts. You might be relieved to have some time 
free of those interruptions anyway.
Summary
The Apple Watch comes in three varieties, called Collections. They all have 
the same functionality, but for people primarily interested in fitness and 
health applications, the Apple Watch Sport Collection is most appropriate. 
To operate, an Apple Watch must be paired with an iPhone of no earlier 
vintage than iPhone 5. There are functions that can be performed only if 
the paired phone is within Bluetooth range, other functions that can be 
performed without the paired iPhone if you are within range of and are 
logged into a Wi-Fi network, and some functions that the watch can do all 
by itself when neither the paired iPhone nor Wi-Fi is nearby.

Chapter 3
Operating the Apple 
Watch
The Apple Watch is much more than just a timepiece, and the additional 
functionality that it has requires some learning by the wearer in order 
to unlock its full capability. The Apple Watch acts as a handy (wristy?) 
extension of the wearer’s iPhone and as such delivers a lot of computing 
power and functionality in a convenient package. The minimalist design of 
the Apple Watch gives the user a limited number of ways to interact with it. 
Despite this, it can do a surprising number of things.
Suppose, like me, you have decided to wear an Apple Watch to enhance 
your health and fitness as well as tell you the time of day. Apps on the Apple 
Watch, from both Apple and from third-party developers, can keep you 
focused on getting a healthy amount of exercise every day. They can also 
record your workouts so that you can track trends in your performance as 
well as your vital signs. The first step in improving your health with Apple 
Watch is to pair it with your iPhone.
Pairing the Apple Watch with Your iPhone
For the Apple Watch to use the processing power and other resources of 
its owner’s iPhone, it must be paired with the iPhone. Pairing sets up a 
two-way communication channel between the two devices. For the Apple 
Watch to deliver its full functionality, it must be within Bluetooth range 
of its paired iPhone. There are some things it can do when away from its 
paired iPhone, such as record the distance you have run or walked and  
the number of steps you have taken. However, it will not record your route, 

CHAPTER 3: Operating the Apple Watch
18
and its accuracy will be somewhat less than it would be if it had access 
to the GPS connection provided by your iPhone. After you pair the Apple 
Watch with your iPhone, you can enter inputs through the touchscreen, 
the digital crown, the button, and voice via Siri. The Apple Watch can send 
inputs to you via the screen, through the taptic engine, through audible 
tones, and also via Siri.
The Apple Watch works with the iPhone 5 and all newer models running 
iOS 8.2 and newer versions of that operating system. If you are still using an 
earlier iPhone, it is probably past time to upgrade anyway.
The pairing procedure is somewhat involved, consisting of a number of 
steps. Before you begin, you will need to make sure both your iPhone and 
your Apple Watch are ready to be paired and synced.
1.	
On your iPhone, go to Settings ➤ Bluetooth and 
make sure Bluetooth is on.
2.	
Make sure your iPhone is connected to either Wi-Fi 
or a cellular network.
3.	
Turn on your Apple Watch by pressing and holding 
the side button next to the digital crown until the 
Apple logo appears on the screen.
4.	
Make sure both your iPhone and your Apple Watch 
are charged up.
5.	
Keep the iPhone and Apple Watch close together 
during the pairing and syncing operation.
Now you can begin the pairing operation. Follow these steps:
1.	
Launch the Apple Watch app on your iPhone. This 
will display a screen similar to Figure 3-1.  

CHAPTER 3: Operating the Apple Watch

2.	
On your Apple Watch, select the language you want 
the Apple Watch to use when communicating with 
you. A list can be scrolled through by rotating the 
digital crown or swiping the screen. Tap the desired 
language to make your selection.
3.	
Tap Start Pairing on both your Apple Watch and 
iPhone. A pairing animation that looks like a swirling 
cloud of molecules will appear on the watch face.
Figure 3-1.  Apple Watch pairing screen

CHAPTER 3: Operating the Apple Watch

4.	
Hold your iPhone over the watch and center the 
pairing animation in the viewfinder on the iPhone 
screen. Keep the two devices aligned until you see 
a message saying “Your Apple Watch is Paired.” If 
for some reason this doesn’t work, you can pair the 
devices manually, following the instructions on your 
iPhone. Figure 3-2 shows your iPhone display after a 
successful pairing.

5.	
On your iPhone, tap the Set Up as New Apple 
Watch option and follow the steps to get the Wrist 
Preference screen. Pick a wrist by tapping Left or 
Right on the iPhone. (If you are re-pairing a watch 
that had previously been paired but then de-paired, 
select Restore from Backup rather than Set Up as 
New Apple Watch.)
6.	
Read and agree to the terms and conditions.
7.	
Sign in with your Apple ID password.
8.	
Review settings for Usage and Diagnostics, Location 
Services, and Siri. They will be shared by the iPhone 
and Apple Watch. Figures 3-3 through 3-5 show 
these three steps in the process.

10.	 As a convenience, you can elect to unlock your 
watch automatically whenever you unlock your 
iPhone. This will save some redundant typing and is 
still pretty safe. Figure 3-7 shows the relevant screen 
on your iPhone. You must approve this option on 
your watch.

11.	 Sync iPhone apps that work with the Apple Watch by 
tapping Install All on your iPhone. If you are running a 
third-party fitness app, you will want to do this rather 
than selecting Choose Later.

that informs you that your Apple Watch is now ready 
to use.

Manipulating the Touchscreen
Since it is impractical to attach either a keyboard or a mouse to a watch, 
the Apple Watch relies primarily on a finger interacting with the touchscreen. 
There are three kinds of actions you can perform with a finger: swipes, taps, 
and presses.
Figure 3-8.  The Apple Watch is ready

CHAPTER 3: Operating the Apple Watch
28
Swipes are a quick sweep of a finger across the touchscreen. They can be 
performed either from the top down, from the bottom up, from left to right, 
or from right to left. Each of these could potentially cause a different action, 
depending on the app. For example, if the clock face is displayed, swiping 
down from the top will surface your most recent notification. Swiping up will 
display a screen enabling you to either select or deselect Airplane Mode, 
Do Not Disturb Mode, or Silent Mode. It will also enable you to ping your 
misplaced iPhone. When you do, your phone will emit a series of ping tones, 
enabling you to find where you left it. Figure 3-9 shows this screen.
Figure 3-9.  Handy control screen for frequently used functions
In the Activity app, with the three rings showing, swiping up from the bottom 
will display the calories you have burned so far today, the number of steps 
you have taken, and the distance you have run, walked, or cycled. Figure 3-10 
shows my totals in the morning before doing much of anything. I had better 
get more active pronto.

CHAPTER 3: Operating the Apple Watch
29
In the Activity app, starting at the three rings screen, swiping from right to 
left displays the Move ring (Figure 3-11) along with the number of calories 
the watch has calculated that you have burned today.
Figure 3-11.  Current progress shown by the Move ring
Figure 3-10.  Result of swiping up in the Activity app

CHAPTER 3: Operating the Apple Watch
30
Swiping from right to left again shows the Exercise ring (Figure 3-12), and 
swiping a third time shows the Stand ring (Figure 3-13).
Figure 3-12.  Exercise ring before today’s first exercise session
Figure 3-13.  Stand ring after watch has detected at least one minute of standing so far  
this morning

CHAPTER 3: Operating the Apple Watch
31
Swiping up from any of those ring screens shows a bar graph displaying 
when you did your moving, exercising, or standing, on an hour-by-hour 
basis throughout the day.
Taps are used to make selections. On the Home screen, which displays little 
circular icons for the apps you have installed, tapping an icon launches the 
associated app. Figure 3-14 shows the Home screen on my Apple Watch, 
showing some of the apps I use.
Figure 3-14.  Apple Watch Home screen
Force Touch, which is putting a finger on the screen and pressing, acts as an 
additional control; the function depends on the app that is running and the 
page that is currently displayed on the screen.
Twirling the Digital Crown
The digital crown, which looks a lot like the crown that you wind on a 
mechanical watch, can be manipulated in two different ways, either twirling 
it or pressing in. When you twirl the crown, what it does depends on the 
context. In some cases, it acts much like the wheel that sits between the 
buttons on a two-button mouse. Twirl it in the upward direction to cause 
the display to scroll up or in the downward direction to cause the display to 
scroll down.

CHAPTER 3: Operating the Apple Watch
32
Figure 3-15 shows the Home screen displayed in Figure 3-14 after it has 
been scrolled up.
Figure 3-15.  Home screen after a scroll-up swipe
This works, of course, only if the app you are running uses up and down 
scrolling. You can achieve the same result by swiping the display up or down 
with a finger. In a different context, the crown acts as a zoom control. Twirl it 
up to zoom in or down to zoom out. This is the behavior you get when you 
twirl the crown in the Photos app. Figure 3-16 shows some recent photos in 
the Photo app, and Figure 3-17 shows that same screen after scrolling up.

CHAPTER 3: Operating the Apple Watch
33
Figure 3-16.  Some recent photos
Figure 3-17.  Sognefjorden on a cloudy day

CHAPTER 3: Operating the Apple Watch
34
In the Activity app, you get the scrolling behavior when you twirl the crown 
rather than the zooming behavior.
Pressing the crown in takes you back to where you were before you entered 
the current app. For example, if you entered the Activity app by tapping 
the Activity icon on the clock face, pressing the crown in returns you to the 
clock face. If you entered the Activity app by tapping the Activity icon on the 
Home screen, you are returned to the Home screen.
Pressing the Button
The button located on the same side of your watch as the digital crown 
gives you instant access to the 12 people you call most often. Figure 3-18 
shows what happens when I press this button.
Figure 3-18.  Apparently I call only seven people with any regularity
By pressing the button, you can call them right from your watch, Dick Tracy–
style, rather than fishing your phone out of a pocket or purse. The Friends 
screen displays a small icon for each of the 12 people you have identified 
as friends on your phone’s Apple Watch app. By selecting one of them and 
pressing the phone handset icon, your watch will initiate a call to your friend.

CHAPTER 3: Operating the Apple Watch
35
If you press and hold down the button, it performs a different function, 
giving you the option of either powering off your watch or tapping into its 
power reserve. You may want to power off the watch if you don’t want to 
be interrupted for a period of time or if you want to conserve battery power. 
Tapping into the power reserve gives you a little more time before the watch 
shuts down.
Feeling Touched by the Taptic Engine
The Apple Watch is pioneering new ground here by applying haptic 
feedback to a mass-market product. Haptic feedback adds another of your 
senses to the ways that a watch can communicate with you. Traditional 
mechanical watches can communicate with you in only one way—you have 
to look at it. Some smartwatches add a second mode of communication: 
sound. They emit a tone or a synthesized voice. Apple Watch adds a third, a 
touch that you can feel as a tap on the back of your wrist. Apple has coined 
the clever word taptic to describe the technology, combining tap with haptic.
Inside the watch, a linear actuator will discreetly tap your wrist when you 
receive an alert or notification. You can choose to either deal with this 
incoming news or ignore it for now, avoiding the interruption that pulling out 
your phone or even glancing at your watch would cause.
You can even communicate with other Apple Watch wearers taptically by 
sending them a tap or two. Since your watch is constantly monitoring your 
pulse, you can even send your heartbeat to someone. This expands the 
ways you can contact people to an entirely new dimension: voice, text, 
emoji, tap, and now heartbeat too.
Summary
This chapter covered how to get your Apple Watch up and running in sync 
with your iPhone. It also described how to control your watch with the 
touchscreen, as well as with the digital crown and the button. In addition 
to the inputs you receive from the sights and sounds you receive from the 
screen and the watch’s speaker, the watch reaches out and touches you 
with its taptic engine. Apple has found ways to convey a lot of information to 
you through three channels in a compact package.

Chapter 4
Running the Built-in Apps
The built-in apps on the Apple Watch mirror many of the built-in apps on 
the iPhone but are adapted to the smaller form factor and screen size. In 
addition, there are new apps that are exclusive to the watch and make use 
of its features. In this chapter, I will give you a brief overview of the apps that 
correspond to iPhone apps, with special attention to differences between 
the two implementations. Native apps that are aimed at health and fitness, 
such as the Activity app and the Workout app, will be covered in detail in 
later chapters.
Messages
Text messaging is a two-way street. You can receive messages and also 
send them. With an iPhone it is possible to type a text message and send 
it. That is not really practical with the Apple Watch, which lacks a keyboard. 
However, you can record an audio message and then choose to send  
either the audio file or a text translation of the audio file, created by Siri’s 
speech-to-text software.
When you receive a message on your watch, it gives you the option of 
replying. A large number of communications can be answered with a brief 
reply that falls into one of a few categories. Your watch gives you the option 
of replying by tapping one of a number of “canned” responses, such as 
those shown in Figure 4-1.

CHAPTER 4: Running the Built-in Apps
38
In addition to the ones shown in Figure 4-1, the following are other possible 
responses:
Thank you.
Sorry. I can’t talk right now.
Can I call you later?
You’re welcome.
My pleasure.
No problem.
NP
Talk later?
Thanks!
An emoji
An audio message
You can select one of a number of emojis, such as the one shown in 
Figure 4-2.
Figure 4-1.  Selected responses to an incoming text message

CHAPTER 4: Running the Built-in Apps
39
You can use the audio message to send either an audio or a text message 
using speech-to-text, if none of the standard replies listed previously is 
appropriate.
Phone
To make a call on your phone, you must pull it out of your pocket or purse 
and then get past your Lock screen, either with a code or a thumbprint. After 
selecting your phone icon, you can then choose between finding the person 
you want to call by specifying Favorites, Recents, Contacts, or Voicemail,  
or you can type in the person’s phone number on your phone’s keyboard.
The Apple Watch doesn’t have a keyboard. However, in most cases it is a 
lot easier to make a call from your watch than from your phone. Your watch 
is right there on your wrist. Just lift up your wrist and select the Phone icon 
from the Home screen (Figure 4-3), and you can find the person you want to 
call in either Favorites, Recents, Contacts, or Voicemail (Figure 4-4) just as 
you can with your phone.

Figure 4-4.  Four ways to retrieve a phone number

CHAPTER 4: Running the Built-in Apps
41
If the person you want to call cannot be found in any of those categories, 
you will just have to pull out your phone to make the call. You will very 
quickly start to view this as a hassle rather than as being normal. Phoning 
with the watch becomes natural quickly.
Mail
The small screen of the Apple Watch cannot display everything that a phone 
can display. When a mail message comes in to the watch, the text of the 
message is displayed as well as a notice to the effect that there are elements 
of the message that have not been displayed. Figure 4-5 shows the display 
when a terribly important message came in from Google Analytics.
Figure 4-5.  I have received a message regarding a free AdWords credit
Lacking a keyboard, the watch is not well suited for composing, typing, and 
sending e-mail messages. To do that, you will need to pull out your iPhone.
Calendar
The Calendar app on your Apple Watch links to the Calendar app on your 
iPhone. Whenever you enter an event on your phone, it will appear on your 
watch too. If you are using the default watch face, any event occurring today 
will appear there too, which is a handy reminder. You will see it whenever 

CHAPTER 4: Running the Built-in Apps
42
you glance at your watch. The Calendar app displays any events that you 
have already entered with your phone or other device but does not allow 
you to change them with the watch. Figure 4-6 shows the reminder for an 
upcoming appointment.
Activity
If you, like me, have bought your Apple Watch primarily as a tool to help you 
improve your health and fitness, then the Activity app is the one that you will 
use the most. In Chapter 5, I will cover the details of this health and fitness 
tool. Here I will only say that it is designed to get you to move your body 
more often and more vigorously than you otherwise would. In some ways, 
it acts like an addictive game, in which you constantly want to improve the 
best “scores” you have achieved in the past. It even supplies an assortment 
of “atta boys” called achievements to give you psychic rewards for reaching 
new levels of activity.
You can even brag to your friends about the latest achievements that you 
have earned to maintain a friendly rivalry that will improve not only your own 
fitness but the fitness of your Apple Watch–wearing friends as well. Come 
to think of it, I should text my brother right now and let him know about my 
latest two achievements. He probably has even more that he can tell me 
about and challenge me with.

Workout
The Workout app is one that you will not find on your iPhone. It uses the 
sensors in your Apple Watch to take data during your formal workouts. The 
data it takes and reports to you depend on the specific type of workout that 
you are doing. In Chapter 6, I will go into detail on all the different types of 
workouts that the app monitors. These include the following: outdoor run, 
outdoor walk, outdoor cycle, indoor walk, indoor run, indoor cycle, elliptical, 
rower, stair stepper, and the mysterious “other.”
The app enables you to set goals and then records your progress toward 
achieving them. You can compare your performance against your best 
previous performance at each different activity.
Maps
The Maps app on your Apple Watch is an extension of the Maps app on 
your iPhone. If your phone shows a particular location and the surrounding 
area, your watch will show the same location but not quite as much of the 
surrounding area. Figure 4-7 shows a map with a pin identifying a location.
Figure 4-7.  A location near Interstate 205 is pinpointed

You can use the digital crown to either zoom in or zoom out. Zooming 
out will give you more context, while zooming in will give you more detail. 
Figure 4-8 shows the pinpointed location after zooming in. It is B.J. Willy’s 
Public House & Eatery.
Figure 4-8.  Zoomed in view of location shown in Figure 4-7
If you asked Maps to give you a recommended route from one location 
to another using your phone, your watch will show the same route. If you 
are traveling from one of those locations to the other, you can refer to your 
watch for directions. Even better, as the helpful voice on your phone gives 
you directions, the haptic engine on your Apple Watch taps your wrist three 
times while sounding a tone, just before each turn that you should make.
Passbook and Apple Pay
On your iPhone, Passbook is the app you can use to store electronic 
images of boarding passes, shopping lists, retail coupons, and merchant 
loyalty cards. You can also store credit and debit cards on it. This makes it 
convenient to board an airplane or save money at the checkout counter. It 
also saves you from pulling out your wallet for the appropriate piece of plastic. 
In fact, your wallet could become a lot thinner, with many fewer cards.
On your Apple Watch, the Passbook app syncs with the Passbook app on 
your phone, so any cards, passes, lists, or coupons that you have there 
will also appear on your watch. You can consult your shopping list while 

CHAPTER 4: Running the Built-in Apps

shopping. As each item is checked at the register, it is removed from the list 
on your watch. Figure 4-9 shows an item that is on my shopping list but has 
not yet been checked out at the register.
Figure 4-9.  I need to buy some almond milk
To pay with Apple Pay, present your watch to the appropriate reader just like 
you could present your phone when making a purchase or boarding a plane. 
Figure 4-10 shows the card you will be paying with and the merchant you are 
buying from. It also serves as your loyalty card for that merchant.

CHAPTER 4: Running the Built-in Apps
46
The advantage is that a flick of the wrist and a double-click on the side 
button is a lot easier and faster than pulling out your phone, getting past the 
Lock screen, and pulling up the Passbook app. You do have to pull up the 
Passbook app on your Apple Watch by tapping its icon on the Home screen, 
but as long as your watch has been on your wrist, it assumes that you are 
still you and does not ask you to prove who you are.
Siri
With watchOS 2, the Siri on your watch functions the same way as Siri 
on your phone. As long as you are within range of a Wi-Fi signal, you can 
access the Internet directly from the watch. In addition, there are a few 
things that Siri on your watch can do that Siri on your iPhone cannot. Siri on 
your watch can interface directly with the watch’s Activity app. Thus, you 
could say something like, “Hey, Siri, start a 20-minute run,” and Siri would 
start the Workout app. You don’t even need to open the app. Siri can also 
provide glances if you say something like “Hey, Siri, show me the Instagram 
glance.” You can access Siri by raising your wrist to wake up the watch and 
then saying “Hey, Siri.” Alternatively, press and hold down the digital crown 
until Siri asks you how she can help you. She will answer your question as 
text typed onto the watch face if she can, possibly accompanied by a snarky 
remark, or do your bidding in some other but nonetheless appropriate way. 
I just asked Siri what the current temperature is in Oregon City, Oregon. 
Figure 4-11 shows her response.

Wow. 104 degrees! I think I’ll pass on my usual two-mile run today.
Music
One of the primary applications of the iPhone for many people is as a music 
player. The iTunes store offers a massive selection of music on a per-song 
or per-album basis. You can buy this music and play it on your phone, either 
through the phone’s speaker or through headphones. The Music app on 
the Apple Watch is an extension of what you have on your iPhone. You can 
call up any music that you own on your phone from your watch. You don’t 
need your phone to play music or audio, however. Your watch can store 
2GB locally. The watch doesn’t have a great speaker, and it doesn’t have a 
headphone jack either. However, you can listen to high-quality audio through 
Bluetooth headphones, which don’t need to be plugged in to work. Up-
tempo music can be encouraging while you are working out at the gym or 
while running or cycling. Figure 4-12 shows my watch while I am listening to 
an up-tempo running remix. This kind of music can really encourage you to 
pick up your pace.

Camera Remote
Selfies can be a lot of fun but do not usually give you a well-composed 
photograph. It’s hard for a photographer to hold a camera and be part of 
a group shot at a family gathering at the same time. A time delay works 
fairly well, but usually somebody in the picture will look distracted or be 
scratching an itch when the picture is finally taken. Camera Remote is 
another new app that is exclusive to the Apple Watch. You can compose 
your group photo, including yourself, with your iPhone set in position. The 
display on your watch shows you exactly what your phone camera sees. 
With a tap, you can either take an immediate photo or set a delay of a few 
seconds so that the picture does not show you tapping your watch. As long 
as your watch is within Bluetooth range of your phone, you can come up 
with all kinds of creative ways to use the Camera Remote app. Bluetooth 
range is about 30 feet. Figure 4-13 shows a selfie of me, not holding my 
phone. Since I am not tapping my Apple Watch, you can tell I opted for the 
three-second delay.

Remote
Whereas the Camera Remote app enables you to control your iPhone 
camera from your watch, the Remote app enables you to control your Apple 
TV or any iTunes library that you may have on a Mac or Windows PC within 
Bluetooth range. I no longer need to spend time hunting for my TV remote. 
With the Apple Watch, my remote is now right there on my wrist. Figure 4-14 
shows the first part of the instructions for setting up the Remote function.

Weather
The iPhone gives you a full update from The Weather Channel on today’s 
weather hour by hour, as well as current temperature, a ten-day forecast, 
and a number of statistics on sunrise and sunset times, chance of rain, 
humidity, wind, precipitation, air pressure, visibility, and UV index. The watch 
also gives the current temperature, ten-day forecast, weather hour by hour, 
sunrise and sunset and (by tapping) the chance of precipitation. Unless you 
are a real weather geek, the watch gives you everything you probably want 
to know about the weather today and for the next ten days.
That’s a lot of data, but the weather statistic that concerns me the most right 
now is the temperature. Figure 4-15 shows the current temperature and the 
predicted temperatures for the next 11 hours.

Stocks
The iPhone Stock app shows the Dow Jones, NASDAQ, and S&P 500 stock 
indexes, as well as the current price and daily price movement of a number 
of securities of your choosing. It also displays a news feed for one of those 
indexes or stocks, which you can change with a tap to the screen. The 
watch displays the same indexes and securities but does not display news 
feeds. There is not enough screen real estate for that. Figure 4-17 shows the 
major indexes. Securities are listed below them. Scroll down to see them.
Figure 4-17.  The Stocks app on Apple Watch
Photos
On the iPhone, subscribers to a shared iCloud photo album can post photos 
and view photos posted by other subscribers. You can subscribe to multiple 
shared albums. The Photos app on your watch shows the most recent 
photos in your current album as a mosaic of tiny images. Figure 4-18 shows 
an example.

CHAPTER 4: Running the Built-in Apps
53
By twirling the digital crown, you can zoom in on a single picture. You can 
also use the touchscreen to move around on the mosaic so that you can 
zoom in on images other than the one that happens to be located at the 
center of the display. Figure 4-19 shows the image one space to the right of 
the one in the center of Figure 4-18.

You cannot see any comments that may accompany an image or see the 
date it was uploaded or who has “liked” it. You may question the value of 
having an unordered collection of postage stamp–sized images at your beck 
and call, right on your wrist, but I imagine anyone separated from loved ones 
will appreciate being able to see the latest pictures that those loved ones 
have uploaded among all the other pictures in a family album. The small 
size of the image is probably not appropriate for fine-art photography or 
astrophotographs of planets and galaxies.
Alarm
On the iPhone, the Clock app has an alarm function. On the Apple Watch, 
the Alarm app gives you the same functionality. It enables you to set an 
alarm in the same way that you would set the alarm on a bedside alarm 
clock. Figure 4-20 shows the Edit Alarm screen that you can use to set the 
alarm time, the frequency of repeating, the alarm label, and whether you 
want to activate the Snooze function.
Figure 4-19.  Photos display zoomed in to a single image

CHAPTER 4: Running the Built-in Apps
55
Unlike an old-fashioned alarm clock, you can name an alarm with a label 
and set it to repeat on a daily basis or on the specific days of the week 
that you choose. Like an old-fashioned alarm clock, you can also give it a 
snooze function if you want. You can set multiple alarms, each distinguished 
from the others by its label.
Stopwatch
Another function of the iPhone Clock app is the Stopwatch function. The 
Stopwatch app on the Apple Watch operates in pretty much the same way. 
You tap the green button at the lower right to start the stopwatch. It will turn 
red. Tap it again to stop the count. Tap the white button on the lower left to 
reset the display. Figure 4-21 shows the Stopwatch, with the analog display.

Timer
The Timer app on the watch enables you to set a time in hours and minutes. 
When you tap the Start button on the screen, the display starts to count 
down. When the count reaches zero, a chime starts to sound and continues 
sounding until you dismiss it with a tap on the Dismiss button. Figure 4-22 
shows the timer set to count down 15 minutes.

World Clock
The World Clock function of the Clock app on the iPhone displays the 
current time at five cities around the world. The World Clock app on the 
watch gives you the current time at the same five cities, even showing 
whether it is daytime or nighttime at those cities. This can be helpful in 
telling you whether it is a good time to call in the time zone of people you 
might consider calling. You can add additional cities or delete existing ones 
on the iPhone. Your watch will reflect the changes immediately. Figure 4-23  
shows that it is nighttime in Portland at 9:45 p.m. but that Portland has 
not been in the dark for very long. An orange dot pinpoints the location 
of Portland on the world map, to the right of the terminator (the curvy line 
separating day from night).

The Settings app on the Watch deals with the main things you might 
want to set without pulling out your phone, such as the time, Airplane 
Mode, Bluetooth, or the Do Not Disturb function to turn off notifications 
and messages. Display brightness, sound level, and haptics can also be 
adjusted here. You can also control whether the passcode is functional, as 
well as change it. Figure 4-24 shows the first several items that you can 
control from the Settings app.

Summary
Versions of most of the built-in apps on the iPhone are also available on the 
Apple Watch. In addition, apps that are exclusive to the Apple Watch, such 
as the Exercise app, provide additional functionality. Versions of popular 
third-party apps are also available for download from Apple’s App Store. I will 
discuss some of them in Chapter 9.

The Apple Watch in 
Health & Fitness

Chapter 5
Keeping Active with the 
Activity App
People have a variety of reasons for obtaining and using an Apple Watch, 
but the predominant reason for many is the idea that it will help them to 
be healthier. Scientific studies have shown that inactivity leads to ill health, 
while becoming more active enhances health. A device that a person wears, 
such as a watch, can be a powerful tool to motivate that person to be more 
active than they otherwise would.
What Weightlessness Does to Astronauts  
in Orbit
I imagine that you have heard that when astronauts come back to Earth after 
several months in space, they are considerably weakened. Figure 5-1 shows 
three astronauts who have just spent several months in orbit. They have 
lost bone mass and muscle and must be helped out of their space capsule 
and carried to the aircraft that will take them back to the space port. What 
causes this?

CHAPTER 5: Keeping Active with the Activity App
64
You probably don’t realize it, but for every minute of every day your body is 
fighting the powerful force of Earth’s gravity. Ever since you were born, you 
have been building and maintaining strength to enable you to function in 
Earth’s gravity field.
Astronauts in orbit do not experience that gravity field. For all intents and 
purposes, they are weightless. They float around within the International 
Space Station. They no longer have to fight the force of gravity. Their bodies 
adapt to the new environment by shedding bone and muscle mass that is 
not needed in a zero-gravity environment. This is no problem as long as 
they stay in space. The problem arises when they return to Earth. They must 
undergo months of rehabilitation before they can get back to the strength 
that they had before venturing into space. Although the astronauts no doubt 
have fun flying around the space station like Superman, they pay a price for 
that privilege when they return to Earth.

CHAPTER 5: Keeping Active with the Activity App
65
How Too Much Sitting Is Like Weightlessness 
in Space
Lying in bed or sitting in a chair is much like being weightless in space. You 
are not fighting gravity, at least not to the extent you would be if you were 
standing up, so your body adapts to the lesser load by surrendering bone 
mass and muscle.
Studies have shown that people with a sedentary life style in which they 
do not move around much are more prone to a number of degenerative 
diseases and tend to die at younger ages than their more active peers. The 
mere act of standing up and spending time in a standing position exposes 
you to the full force of gravity. If you spend enough time standing, your body 
will adapt to the need for strength by building up your bones and packing on 
the muscle you need to function in a one-g world.
The takeaway message here is that the more time you spend fighting the full 
force of gravity, the more adapted you will be to living and functioning on 
Earth. It’s easy to fall into a habit of spending a large part of the day shielded 
from gravity by sitting. We sit at our desks to work. We sit on the couch to 
watch TV. We sit at the table to eat our meals. We sit in the stands to watch 
sports contests where other people are being active instead of us. To break 
that deadly habit, it would help to be reminded to get up and move. That’s 
exactly what the Activity app on the Apple Watch does for us.
The Activity App: More Fun Than a  
Three-Ring Circus
If health and fitness were reasons for you to obtain an Apple Watch, the 
Activity app is the one you will be referring to most often. Not only does 
a quick glance tell you how far along you are toward reaching your daily 
activity goals, but the app also taps into everyone’s natural inclination 
to try to excel at competitive games. The app makes a game out of 
choosing healthy behaviors. The display shows three concentric rings: 
the Move ring, the Exercise ring, and the Stand ring. Each ring tracks your 
performance on a different activity. Figure 5-2 shows the display after an 
early morning run.

CHAPTER 5: Keeping Active with the Activity App
66
The Move Ring
The outermost, Move ring shows your progress toward your daily movement 
goal; a brightly colored dot grows into an arc that extends around the 
perimeter of a circle as you move. When the ring forms a complete circle, 
you have reached your goal. The distance traveled on the Move ring 
translates directly into the number of calories the watch has estimated that 
you have burned. The app uses the history of how you have been doing to 
set new weekly goals for you. If you want, you can set your own goals rather 
than going by what the watch thinks is best for you.
It doesn’t take a math whiz to figure out that if the number of calories you 
consume as food and drink exceeds the number of calories you burn, you 
are going to gain weight. These days, the number of calories in every kind of 
food you can buy in the store is listed on the label or in a handy app on your 
phone. You can add up your daily calorie consumption to see how much you 
have to burn off with activity in order to maintain your current weight. Any 
activity beyond that should put you on the road to losing weight.
You also burn a certain number of calories just by being alive. You burn 
more when you move or engage in other strenuous activities. If your 
calorie income from food and drink exceeds your calorie outgo from basic 
metabolism and activity, over time you will pack on the pounds.
Figure 5-2.  The Activity app display

CHAPTER 5: Keeping Active with the Activity App
67
The purpose of the Activity app is to motivate you to make active rather than 
passive choices throughout the day. Take the stairs rather than the elevator. 
Ride your bike to the corner store rather than driving there in your car. At 
minor decision points throughout the day, make the more active choice. 
Your reward will be a payoff in terms of calories burned. As a bonus, you’ll 
likely feel better too.
The Exercise Ring
The Exercise ring shows the number of minutes of energetic activity that 
you have completed. This also translates to calories burned, and the more 
energetic the activity, the faster the calories are burned. Any activity you 
engage in that causes you to exert yourself as much as you would with a 
brisk walk is considered exercise and causes the Exercise ring to move 
around the circle. What you consider to be a brisk walk may not agree 
with what the Apple Watch considers a brisk walk to be. I have found that 
walking my dog does not move the Exercise ring ahead. However, jogging 
with him does the trick, except for those times when he stops to examine 
something on the ground, which happens quite often. At least I get credit for 
the jogging part. The Exercise ring closes with a full circle when you have 
exercised for 30 minutes in a day. If you continue to exercise after achieving 
your goal, the ring continues to move around, gradually changing its shade 
of green so that you can see which loop you are on.
Any kind of exercise will do. You may decide to jog for a half hour on one 
day and lift weights on the next. Thirty minutes of either one will close the 
circle of the Exercise ring. You get the most credit for aerobic exercise. 
Fifteen minutes of jogging will advance the Exercise ring more than lifting 
weights for an hour.
The Stand Ring
The innermost, Stand ring reminds you to stand at least once for a minute  
or more during each of 12 hours of the day. Each time you complete  
one of those one-minute or more standing sessions, the Stand ring extends 
one-twelfth of the way around the circle. The goal is to keep your body used 
to the idea that you are living on a one-gravity planet rather than floating 
around in space. Your body needs to be constantly reminded to remain 
strong. If you don’t remind it, the body will switch to an energy-saving mode 
that depletes your strength and thins your bones.

CHAPTER 5: Keeping Active with the Activity App
68
The Apple Watch can’t really tell whether you are sitting or standing. It can 
tell only whether you have moved a significant distance in the past hour. If 
you stand at your standing desk for more than an hour, as I often do, the 
Apple Watch will remind you to stand. I solve this problem by taking a break 
and doing something that requires movement for at least a minute. A brief 
tour of the premises will do the trick nicely. The inner blue ring will advance 
by an hour, and you will be one-twelfth of the way closer to the daily goal of 
standing for at least one minute during 12 different hours of the day.
The Winner’s Circle
The competitive aspect of the Activity app comes in when you look at your 
watch and see that it is getting late in the day and your Activity rings are 
nowhere near complete. You are motivated to get up out of your chair and go 
walk the dog, run an errand, or perform some other chore that will get you 
up and moving. When you come to the end of the day and all three of the 
rings on your Activity app are complete (Figure 5-3), you will experience a real 
sense of accomplishment. You will have won the game for today and in the 
process will have become just a little bit healthier.
Figure 5-3.  Mission accomplished!

CHAPTER 5: Keeping Active with the Activity App
69
Your Unobtrusive Coach
Partway through your day, your watch will beep a couple of times, and when 
you glance at the screen, it will give you a report of how many calories you 
have burned, minutes you have exercised, and hours during which you have 
stood. It then encourages you to take action to move closer to your goals. 
Often this reminder comes at a time when you ought to take a break and do 
something different anyway. At the least, it gets you thinking about your plan 
for the rest of the day and how you might work in the activity or exercise you 
need to do to close all three of your rings.
Create an Activity Program Tailored to  
Your Needs
When it comes to maintaining health and improving fitness, everyone is 
starting from a unique point on the health and fitness spectrum and aspires 
to end up at a better point on that spectrum. What that better point is 
depends on what is physically possible and on the amount of effort that a 
person is willing to put in to achieve it. The Apple Watch can start you off on 
your journey to greater health by encouraging you to spend time standing, 
moving, and exercising. If you find that it is either consistently too easy or 
consistently too hard to complete one of the Activity app’s three rings, you 
can adjust it to a level that challenges you to stretch a little but does not put 
completing a ring out of reach.
Ideally, standing for a least a minute in each of the 12 hours in a day will not 
be too difficult. It really is harmful to sit for too long. We are not designed to 
be sedentary. For the overwhelming majority of the existence of humanity, 
we have had to work practically all day at vigorous physical tasks. Sitting in 
an office for eight hours every day is a recent phenomenon, and our bodies 
are not optimized for spending so much time essentially motionless.
Standing on a regular basis is a first step (no pun intended) toward better 
health; moving raises the bar a notch higher, and exercising will return the 
most benefit for the least amount of time spent. If you complete your three 
rings consistently, day in and day out, you will be healthier, and you will feel 
better too. As a bonus, you will be more productive at whatever you do.

Chapter 6
Building Strength and 
Endurance with the 
Workout App
For the health and fitness enthusiast, this is the one to use to track and 
record your progress in aerobic workouts. Workout types include Outdoor 
Running, Outdoor Walking, Outdoor Cycle, Indoor Running, Indoor Walking, 
Indoor Cycle, Elliptical, Rower, Stair Stepper, and Other.
Before Starting Any Workout Program
The object of working out is to improve your health and fitness, and a  
well-designed program will definitely do that. However, it is also possible  
to damage your health by engaging in a program that is not right for your 
body or your current state of fitness. It is always advisable to consult your 
doctor before making any significant change in your customary exercise 
program.
Note  In Chapter 9, I will be describing third-party apps that cover some of 
the same ground as the built-in Workout app. In many cases, the third-party 
apps provide information that the built-in app does not, and vice versa. You may 
decide to use more than one during a workout to get a more complete picture of 
your performance.

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
72
While you are working out, be alert to what your body is telling you. If it 
is telling you that it is not ready to reach the goals that you have set for 
yourself on your Apple Watch, back off. Gradual progress from goals that 
you can achieve comfortably is the best way to improve. Move from one 
performance plateau to the next after you have spent some time on your 
current plateau. Don’t try to be a hero and reach too far.
How Your Progress Is Tracked
Each of the exercise types that the Workout app supports has 
characteristics that can be measured by the sensors in the watch. The 
movements that you make, how rapid and forceful they are, and your heart 
rate are all measured and fed into an algorithm. From those readings, plus 
the duration of the activity, the Workout app can estimate how many calories 
you have burned during the workout.
The algorithm takes into account the type of activity you are engaged in. For 
example, an outdoor run will burn more calories than will an outdoor walk, 
even if both continue for the same amount of time, say, 30 minutes. The 
Other category is a catchall designed to handle any activity other than the 
ones explicitly named. Since the Workout app does not know how vigorous 
your activity will be in the unknown Other activity, it makes an assumption. 
It assumes your calorie burn rate will be the same as it would be for a brisk 
walk. For this reason, the accuracy of the calorie count that it gives you will 
probably not be quite as good as for the known activities. Apple has done 
considerable research on the calorie burn rate for a variety of different types 
of people for each of the known workout types.
At the beginning of the workout, set your goal, or even No Goal, which will 
vary from one exercise type to another, and then press the virtual Start 
button. At that point, commence exercising. When you have reached your 
goal, your watch sounds a tone and taps your wrist lightly with its taptic 
engine. It then congratulates you on a job well done.
Note  Pressing down hard on the screen will display the page with the End and 
Pause virtual buttons. Swiping from left to right through all the screens will also 
take you to the End/Pause screen. If for any reason (such as to take a phone 
call) you want to pause your activity, tap the Pause (double vertical bar) button. 
When you have finished the activity, tap the End button, which is an X icon.

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
73
Figure 6-1.  Workout End/Pause buttons
Warning  Be sure to tap the X icon at the end of your workout to inform your 
Apple Watch that the workout has ended. If you neglect to do this, the Workout 
app will continue to rack up calories burned as if you were still exercising. This 
can lead to some ridiculous calorie burn totals that will distort your statistics. At 
the end of each exercise, you are given the option to either save or delete the 
result of the workout. You probably want to delete those for which you forgot to 
tap the X icon at the end of the workout. Figure 6-1 shows the workout ending 
screen, featuring the X that you tap to formally end the workout.
Warning  The Workout app uses a lot of electricity while it is running. This 
will cause your watch battery to run down, and you may not make it to the end 
of the day before your watch asks you if you want to switch to power reserve 
mode. In power reserve mode, Apple Watch shuts down all its functions except 
time keeping. Even the time is not displayed unless you press the button next to 
the digital crown. Use the Workout app judiciously, and be sure to turn it off just 
as soon as your workout is finished.

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
74
Supported Workouts
Different workouts make different demands on your body and burn calories 
at different rates. For that reason, Apple has calibrated nine of the most 
common activities that people do for fitness workouts. When you want to 
perform one of these nine workouts, you can choose it from the Workout 
app, and it will estimate the calories you are burning with that activity, based 
on the testing that Apple has previously done in its fitness lab. As you add 
workouts to the data available to the app, it will adjust to more closely track 
your actual exertion level.
Outdoor Running
Outdoor running is my favorite workout. It is highly efficient in that you can 
burn more calories in less time than you can with any of the other standard 
workouts. It has other benefits too, of course. One benefit is that it doesn’t 
require any special equipment. If you are out in the country, the fresh country 
air can be a joy to breathe. The sights and sounds of the area you run 
through can be beautiful and relaxing. Even in the city, you can probably find 
a pleasant place to run. Getting away from your normal duties and concerns 
can free your mind to live in the moment. I have some of my best ideas while 
out running.
Set your goal for the exercise on your watch for the distance you want to 
run, the number of calories you want to burn, the amount of time you want 
the exercise to last, or no goal at all. Figure 6-2 shows the Outdoor Running 
start screen with a distance goal. You can either increase or decrease the 
distance you want to run by tapping the plus (+) sign or the minus (-) sign 
or by twirling the digital crown either up or down. This will increment or 
decrement the displayed distance by a fraction of a mile (or a fraction of a 
kilometer if your app is set to record kilometers rather than miles). You can 
set the distance you want to run today using repeated taps. It’s a lot easier 
to just twirl the crown, so that’s what I do. As a default, the watch will start 
with the most recent distance you have run and will also list the longest 
distance you have run previously.

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
75
If the app is set, for example, to record distances in miles and for this 
workout you would like to use kilometers instead, just press firmly on the 
display. The screen will change to the MI/KM display, and you can select a 
new set of distance-measuring units.
If you choose to save your workouts, the Workout app will remind you of 
your longest run so far and thereby encourage you to exceed it. You can set 
your current goal to either the longest or the most recent run that you have 
made, or you can set it to another distance of your choice with a twirl of the 
digital crown.
When you start running, the app will start measuring your heart rate and will 
continuously monitor it during your run. You can see your current heart rate 
as you run by merely glancing at your watch. This is useful because you 
can judge your level of effort by your heart rate and adjust your speed up 
or down to keep it in the range that your doctor has recommended for you 
based on your age and fitness level. It will also tell you how long you have 
been running so far. Figure 6-3 shows a typical display.
Figure 6-2.  Outdoor Run start screen

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
76
I find that keeping tabs on my heart rate occasionally during a run keeps 
me in my optimal performance zone. On hilly terrain, it is interesting to see 
how my heart rate changes when transitioning from an uphill climb to a 
downhill stretch.
In addition to heart rate, the Workout app also tracks and displays elapsed 
time, pace, distance traveled, and calories burned. You can display 
whichever of those is of most interest to you on your watch while you are 
running. With a swipe you can move from one display to another. The app 
tracks and displays all this data on the fly in real time.
Outdoor Walking
If you are just getting started with an exercise program, it is a good idea 
to start with walking before you consider running. For the outdoor walk 
activity, you can set a calorie burn goal, a time of activity goal, or a distance 
goal as you do with the outdoor run activity. You can also choose the No 
Goal option if you want to record a workout but with no fixed goal in mind. 
Figure 6-4 shows the display for the calorie burn goal.
Figure 6-3.  Workout screen in the middle of a run

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
77
Everyone has a different level of fitness to begin, walks a different route over 
different terrain, and has a different preferred speed. Some people may walk 
with their dog, in which case the dog may have a preferred speed. Because 
of all these variables, it makes sense to set your calorie burn goal low at 
first until you can figure out what it should be for one of your typical walking 
sessions. As with running, don’t forget to tap the End button at the end of 
your walk. As with the Outdoor Run app, your heart rate is continuously 
monitored during the exercise, and you can see it at a glance. A record is 
also kept that you can review later on the Health app on your iPhone.
Outdoor Cycling
The Outdoor Cycle activity is like the Outdoor Run and Outdoor Walk 
activities in that you can set a goal for either calories to burn, distance to 
travel, or time to spend on the activity, or you can leave it open ended and 
not set a goal. The starting display is the same as it is for outdoor running 
or walking and you set your goal the same way, either with the digital crown 
or with the plus or minus signs on the display. The information the app gives 
you during the exercise is the same too, including elapsed time, current 
speed, distance traveled so far, and heart rate.
Figure 6-4.  Outdoor Walk calorie burn goal

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
78
As with the running and walking apps, pressing on the display or swiping 
from left to right across the display brings up the End and Pause buttons. If, 
for example, you ride to the store to pick up a few groceries, you can pause 
the workout before going into the store and then resume it when you mount 
your bike to head back home. This way, you can get credit for a workout and 
perform some useful task at the same time.
Indoor Walking
Walking is a good exercise, even if it is not convenient to do it outside, 
either because of bad weather or for some other reason. This is where a 
treadmill comes in handy. If you have one at home or a membership at a 
local gym, you can do your walking workout inside, where the weather is 
always clement. If you don’t have access to a treadmill, you can achieve 
much of the same effect by walking around in circles. That’s what I do when 
I want the Activity app to recognize the fact that I have stood up for at least 
a minute.
As I mentioned in Chapter 5, the Activity app cannot recognize whether you 
are sitting or standing if you have been standing still for a long time, as I do 
at my stand-up desk. To get the Activity app to recognize the fact that I am 
indeed on my feet, I walk in a loop from my kitchen to the dining room to the 
living room and then back to the kitchen again. When I do this several times, 
the app recognizes that I have indeed stood up for at least a minute.
Indoor walking differs from outdoor walking in that you are not traveling any 
appreciable distance. This means that the GPS in your iPhone cannot track 
the route you have traveled and calculate the distance you have covered. 
The Workout app nonetheless calculates the distance you have traveled, 
and if you have entered a distance goal, it will congratulate you when it 
determines that you have reached your goal. Lacking the additional 
information that GPS would have provided, the distance it displays will not 
be as accurate as it would be for outdoor walking, but it will be a reasonable 
approximation. 
Note  Speaking of approximations, the distances recorded for all the workouts 
that involve distance are approximations. Even though the display will give you 
your distance traveled, down to 1/100th of a mile or 1/100th of a kilometer, the 
accuracy is really not that good. You may find variations of as much as one-
tenth of a mile on multiple traversals of the same course. For indoor walking 
and indoor running, the reading will typically be even less accurate. However, 
it will still be in the ballpark. If your goal in working out is to improve your 
overall fitness, putting in an exact number of miles per day is probably not the 
important thing. The important thing is that you are working out regularly at the 
level of effort that is appropriate for where you are in your conditioning program.

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
79
Indoor Running
You can get in an indoor running workout by cranking up the speed on 
your treadmill to your preferred running pace. Everything else remains the 
same as for indoor walking. The Workout app counts calories burned, 
tracks the duration of exercise, and approximates “distance” traveled; it 
then congratulates you when you reach the workout goal that you have set. 
You will burn calories faster while running than you would by walking, so 
you should reach your calorie goal sooner. Of course, if you set an exercise 
duration goal, that’s how long the exercise will last, whether you ware 
walking or running.
Indoor Cycling
Well-equipped gyms today have stationary bicycles that you can “ride” 
to maintain fitness when riding a real bicycle outside is not feasible. Bad 
weather is one reason not to mount a real bicycle. Another is being in 
a place where cycling is not possible or not safe. When on vacation on 
a cruise ship, for example, cycling around the promenade deck is not 
permitted. Luckily, all cruise ships have gyms, and most are equipped 
with stationary bicycles. If you live in a city that experiences smog alerts, 
exercising indoors is probably a good idea on those days. This applies to 
walking and running as well as cycling. During pollen season, people with 
allergies or other respiratory problems would be well advised to favor indoor 
workouts. The Indoor Cycle activity in the Workout app operates the same 
way as the indoor walk and indoor run activities. You can set a calorie goal, 
a time goal, or no goal, before pressing the Start button. Calories burned, 
elapsed time, and heart rate will be continuously recorded. At the end of the 
exercise, you can choose to either save or discard the record of the session.
Elliptical
Like the indoor walk, run, and cycle, working out on the elliptical machine 
does not involve movement from one place to another, so GPS tracking 
is not effective. However, it is a real workout and can be quite strenuous. 
The extensive testing that Apple did before the release of the Apple Watch 
included taking measurements of the energy expended by a variety of 
people as they exercised on elliptical machines. Based on those tests, it 
calculated the number of calories expended, based on the elapsed time 
and the exerciser’s heart rate. The watch display shows all three: elapsed 
time, calories burned, and heart rate. An elliptical workout can be a vigorous 
aerobic exercise that strengthens muscles as well as the cardiovascular 
system.

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
80
Rower
The rowing machine in the gym simulates the exercise your body would get 
if you were rowing a boat. It works your shoulders and your calves as well 
as your cardiovascular system. You can burn more calories on a rowing 
machine than you can on an elliptical machine, for the same amount of 
minutes spent on the exercise.
As is the case for the elliptical workout, the Apple Watch records elapsed 
time, calories burned, and heart rate while you are rowing. If you save the 
data taken during a workout, you can review it later. The app will retain both 
your longest and your most recent workout. You can set either one as a goal 
to shoot for that same duration again, a calorie burn goal, or a new goal of 
your choosing, or you can exercise without a specific goal.
Stair Stepper
The stair stepper is another machine you will find in health and fitness 
gyms, designed to build your cardiovascular fitness. As the name implies, it 
simulates the action of climbing a flight of stairs. For that reason it also helps 
to strengthen the muscles in your legs and lower body. As with the elliptical 
machine and rower, your Apple Watch will record and display your heart 
rate and will also record elapsed time and estimated calories burned. The 
calories-burned estimate, as is the case for all the other exercises that GPS 
cannot detect movement in, is based on tests run at Apple’s fitness lab. 
You can set a goal for the duration of your workout, or you can record your 
session with no fixed goal.
Other
Of course, there are a lot of exercises you might do that are not included 
in the previous list. For these you can select the Other option. Your Watch 
will assume that whatever you are doing, it will work your body at a level 
equivalent to a brisk walk. As with the stationary exercises, elapsed time, 
calories burned, and heart rate will be recorded and will be saved if you 
choose to save them.
How the Workout App Works
The Workout app pulls in heart rate data from your watch’s heart rate sensor, 
location data from your iPhone’s GPS signal, and motion data from the 
watch’s accelerometer. The accelerometer measures total body movement 
and steps taken. Its readings are used to calculate the calories you burn 

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
81
throughout the day. The heart rate sensor delivers data that is used to help 
calculate the intensity of a workout, which in turn feeds into the calculation 
of calories burned.
Setting Workout Goals
People come in all shapes and sizes, ages, and levels of conditioning, and 
they have different ideas about what they want to gain from an exercise 
program. Some just want to slow the decline in their physical capacity as 
they age. Others may want to build up their body to the point where it is 
performing at an elite level. In between there are a near infinite number of 
intermediate goals.
One of the first things you should do after consulting your doctor on any 
limits that you should not exceed is to set a fitness goal to work toward. 
If your goal is simply to slow the decline of functionality because of aging, 
starting an exercise program will surely do that. You will almost surely find 
that your goal is too conservative. A regular exercise program should give 
you increased strength and stamina, as long as you are consistent, giving 
your health the high priority it deserves.
A more ambitious goal might be to run in a 10-kilometer (10K) race at some 
point. Your goal should be ambitious enough such that you will have to 
stretch in order to accomplish it but not so difficult that it is truly beyond 
what you will ultimately be capable of. Once you do accomplish your initial 
goal, you can always set a higher one.
 Building Cardiovascular Fitness
Your cardiovascular system, consisting of your heart, lungs, and all the 
blood vessels in your body, is more important for keeping you alive than 
anything else. As such, it should be the top priority of your workout program. 
All exercises will raise your heart rate above what it is when you are sitting 
quietly, reading, watching TV, or typing a book manuscript as I am doing 
now. However, the exercises that will do your cardiovascular system the 
most good are the ones that will raise your heart rate the most, as long as 
they don’t put you in danger from overexertion.
The nine workouts featured by the Workout app are all good for building 
up your cardiovascular system. You may choose one that you particularly 
like, or you could mix things up and do one exercise on one day and 
another exercise on a different day. You could even do a different exercise 
on each day of the week. You would get your cardio work in that way, but 
you would also work different muscle groups, giving you a more all-around 
strength-building experience.

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
82
Shaping and Toning
Beyond the basic cardio workouts, some people may want to improve their 
appearance by creating a more classic shape. Abdominal exercises are an 
example of workouts that can help with this. You can use the Workout app 
when doing ab exercises, using the Other choice rather than one of the nine 
specific ones such as Outdoor Run or Elliptical. You may also want to use 
one of the third-party apps specifically targeted at ab workouts. I will cover 
these in Chapter 9.
Building Strength
Any exercise that you do will build strength in one or more muscle groups. 
Running will surely build strength in your leg muscles, as will cycling, 
providing you do it vigorously. Even walking slowly will at least help you 
keep the strength you already have. All these activities also strengthen your 
cardiovascular system. The elliptical machine and rower also work your arms 
and upper body. Using the Workout app along with these activities will help 
to keep you disciplined and will give you a sense of how much effort you 
have expended doing each of these exercises. While the Workout app is 
active, heart-rate data is being continuously sent to the Health app on your 
iPhone. You can review this data after a workout to get a sense of how hard 
each exercise is pushing you.
Tracking Progress with the iPhone Health App
The Health app on the iPhone acts as a repository for up-to-date information 
on the state of its owner’s health. It accepts information from a variety of 
health-related apps, devices, and its paired Apple Watch to create a picture 
of the current health of the owner, as well as historical health data. Some of 
that data will be automatically routed to the Health app from the Workout 
app, some will be routed from third-party apps, and some can be entered 
manually by the iPhone owner.
The Dashboard
The Dashboard gives you a quick picture, in the form of line graphs, of how 
you have been performing. You can look at a year’s worth of data, a month’s 
worth, a week’s worth, or a day’s worth. The quantities being tracked are 
either data points sent in by apps or data points entered by you, based on 
measurements such as weight, which are not measured by a connected 
device. There are a number of different quantities that you can display on the 
Dashboard. I will briefly describe the ones that I find most useful. Figure 6-5 
shows the Dashboard.

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
83
Walking + Running Distance
Walking and running distance is tracked using your iPhone with its GPS 
capability. Software determines by the speed at which you are traveling 
whether you are either walking or running or traveling in some kind of 
vehicle, such as a bicycle or automobile. Only the distance covered at a 
normal walking or running pace will be recorded in the Walking + Running 
Distance category. If you are a bicyclist rather than a runner, your workouts 
will be recorded under Cycling Distance. Figure 6-6 shows the Walking + 
Running Distance graph with the current month’s data displayed.
Figure 6-5.  Health app Dashboard

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
84
There is an option to either show or not show this chart on the Dashboard, 
as well as an option to show all the data in this category that the Health app 
has collected. You can also add a data point manually.
Weight
Neither the Apple Watch nor the iPhone has a way of measuring your 
weight…yet. To keep track of this, you will need to enter your weight manually. 
Figure 6-7 shows how my weight has varied during the current month.
Figure 6-6.  Walking + Running Distance display on Dashboard

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
85
Body Mass Index
Body mass index (BMI) is a simple computation based on a person’s height 
and weight. Assuming your height doesn’t change from day to day, it will 
track changes in weight. The Health app will do the computation for you. 
All you need to do is accept the answer it provides you. BMI moves up and 
down in sync with changes in weight, so the BMI graph looks exactly like 
the Weight graph.
Heart Rate
The Health app uses the heart-rate sensor in the Apple Watch or a sensor 
embedded in a chest strap paired with either the Workout app or a third-
party fitness app to record your heart rate during an exercise. If your 
Workout app is running, it will take data from the Apple Watch. If you are 
wearing your chest strap and running a third-party fitness app, the Health 
app will take data from that. The Dashboard display shows a bar graph in 
which the bottom end of each day’s bar shows the lowest heart rate during 
the day, and the top end shows your highest heart rate during the day. 
Figure 6-8 shows the current month’s high and low heart-rate data.
Figure 6-7.  Weight display on Dashboard

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
86
Steps
The accelerometer in your Apple Watch and the one in your iPhone emit 
a distinctive signal when you take a step, either while walking or running. 
The Health app counts these steps and displays them on the dashboard. 
One way to improve your fitness is to take more steps during the day. With 
the Steps display on the Dashboard, you can see how you are doing and 
perhaps reverse a trend of ever-lower step counts. Figure 6-9 shows the 
current month’s data for Steps.
Figure 6-8.  Heart Rate display on Dashboard

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
87
Workouts
The Workouts display on the Dashboard records the time you spend 
exercising each day, where a level of exertion at or above that of a brisk walk 
counts as time spent working out. Workout data is recorded as a bar graph, 
and your average time spent working out over the past month is shown as 
well as the amount of time you spent working out yesterday. After your first 
workout of the day, yesterday’s data is replaced by today’s data.
Figure 6-9.  Steps display on Dashboard

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
88
Health Data
With the Health app on your iPhone, you can record and retain information 
about every aspect of your health and level of fitness. You can enter some 
information yourself, and other data will be sent automatically to the Health 
app from the Workout app on your Apple Watch or from third-party fitness 
apps running on your Apple Watch or iPhone.
Body Measurements
Body Measurements is an example of a category of information that 
currently you must enter manually. The items measured are as follows:
 Body fat percentage
 Body mass index
 Height
 Lean body mass
 Weight
Height and weight are easily measured, and the Health app will compute the 
body mass index from those two quantities. Body fat percentage and lean 
body mass require a more elaborate measurement. If you have been tested 
for those things, you can enter the results of the tests here. If you have not, 
in most cases you can do just fine without that data.
Fitness
The Fitness category tracks the things you have been doing to improve your 
overall fitness. In many cases these are the same things that you have been 
tracking on the Dashboard. The categories are as follows:
 Active Calories
 Cycling Distance
 Flights Climbed
 NikeFuel
 Resting Calories
 Steps
 Walking + Running Distance
 Workouts

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
89
When you use the Apple Watch Workout app, it will track active calories 
burned, cycling distance, resting calories, steps, walking and running 
distance, and workouts. NikeFuel is a program conducted by Nike (surprise!) 
that uses the Apple Watch to measure the amount of effort you put into 
movement. In that sense, it is similar to the Apple Watch’s Workout app. If 
you use it, your results will show up in the Health app. Flights climbed is an 
entry you can make manually after climbing one or more flights of stairs.
Me
In the Me category, you can enter a little information about yourself.
 Birth date
 Sex
 Blood type
This data isn’t all that valuable. Your birth date is handy so people can 
send you a cheerful birthday greeting once a year. Your sex is generally 
pretty evident just by looking at you. Your blood type might be handy in an 
emergency situation in which you need a blood transfusion. However, nobody 
is going to give you a transfusion based just on what your iPhone says. They 
will take a sample of your blood and type it before giving you a transfusion.
Nutrition
You would have to be a real diet weenie to fill in all the data that could 
potentially be recorded in this category. You would have to enter it all by 
hand, since neither your Apple Watch nor your iPhone can sense what you 
eat and drink. Among many others, nutrients you can enter include the 
following:
 Biotin
 Caffeine
 Calcium
 Carbohydrates
 Chloride
 Chromium
 Copper
 Dietary calories
 Dietary cholesterol
 Fiber

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
90
Good luck entering the number of micrograms of biotin and milligrams of 
caffeine you consume every day.
Results
Elite athletes preparing for major competitions want to get every last bit of 
performance out of their bodies, whether it’s that last hundredth of a second 
in a sprint or that last kilometer in an ultramarathon. To do so, state-of-the-
art training programs test and try to optimize every aspect of an athlete’s 
body and mind. The Health app gives you the opportunity to record physical 
parameters that are indications of your state of health. Many of these require 
elaborate instrumentation, but if you have access to these resources, you 
may be able to squeeze some extra performance out of your body. Tests 
include the following:
 Blood Alcohol Content
 Blood Glucose
 Electrodermal Activity
 Forced Expiratory Volume, 1 sec
 Forced Vital Capacity
 Inhaler Usage
 Number of Times Fallen
 Oxygen Saturation
 Peak Expiratory Flow Rate
 Peripheral Perfusion Index
Some of this data will come in from source apps, and others can be added 
manually.
Note  The Apple Watch uses its green LED pulse oximeter to measure heart 
rate. However, a pulse oximeter is a sophisticated instrument and is capable 
of measuring more than that. One thing that it could potentially measure is the 
peripheral perfusion index, which is a measure of the strength of a person’s 
pulse. In its first release, the Apple Watch does not report this information. 
Possibly it will in a later release after Apple has had some time to perfect the 
technology.

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
91
Currently all the results in this category must be entered manually. Some will 
always require manual entry, but others may become measurable with later 
releases of the source apps that feed data into the Health app.
Sleep
With the Sleep category, you can record either the amount of time you 
spend in bed each day or the amount of time you are actually asleep. For 
“in bed” time, you can record the time you get into bed and then record the 
time you get up the next day. For “asleep” time, it is a little harder to make 
accurate entries. After you get into bed, how do you know how long it will 
take you to go to sleep? The next morning, how do you know when you 
stopped actually sleeping before being alert enough to make an entry in the 
Health app? Perhaps a rough estimate of these times is enough for most 
purposes.
Vitals
Your vital signs are the measurements that most closely track your state 
of health. If they fall out of the normal range, you have a serious health 
problem. When they flatline, you are dead. The following are stored by the 
Health app:
 Blood pressure
 Body temperature
 Heart rate
 Respiratory rate
Of these, heart rate is measured by the Apple Watch while the Workout 
app is running. It is also measured by some third-party apps that also 
serve as sources for the Health app. Blood pressure is a quantity that can 
be calculated, based on measurements made by a pulse oximeter. This 
function is not available in the initial release of the Apple Watch but may 
become available in a later release. Currently, there is no sensor for body 
temperature in the Apple Watch, and it has no way of measuring respiratory 
rate in breaths per minute. Whenever you have these variables tested, you 
can enter the results manually. 
Sources
The Health app can draw data directly from physical devices, such as 
your Apple Watch and your iPhone, as well as from third-party apps. The 
following are a few apps that can serve as sources for the Health app along 
with the types of data they share.

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
92
MyHeart
MyHeart is one of the Research Kit apps. Run by Stanford University, it 
monitors study participants for possible cardiovascular abnormalities. 
MyHeart will share only two data items with the Health app: a person’s 
height and weight. However, it will gladly accept many data items that the 
Health app is willing to share with it, such as the following:
 Blood glucose
 Cycling distance
 Date of birth
 Diastolic blood pressure
 Flights climbed
 Heart rate
 Height
 Oxygen saturation
 Sex
 Sleep analysis
 Steps
 Systolic blood pressure
 Walking and running distance
 Weight
 Workouts
By taking and analyzing all this data, the researchers hope to determine 
what factors increase chances of contracting cardiovascular disease and 
what practices or characteristics might be protective against it. Some of 
these data items, such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, cycling 
distance, steps, and walking and running distance can be gleaned from the 
Apple Watch Workout app. People enrolled in the MyHeart program can 
contribute data to the program every time they engage in a workout.
Note  Research Kit is a collaboration between Apple and several groups of 
academic researchers, investigating various diseases and conditions. The idea 
is to collect data from test subjects who own an Apple Watch and are willing to 
share their data with the researchers.

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
93
RunKeeper
The RunKeeper fitness app shares more than just height and weight 
information with the Health app. It also shares active calories burned, 
cycling distance, walking and running distance, and workouts.
The Health app will share all those same things, in the reverse direction, with 
RunKeeper as well as sharing the date of birth and sex of the user.
Runtastic and Runtastic Pro
Runtastic, like RunKeeper, shares active calories burned, cycling distance, 
walking and running distance, and workouts with the Health app but does 
not share height and weight data. Furthermore, Runtastic does not accept 
any information coming in the reverse direction from the Health app. If you 
want any data to be recorded in either Runtastic or Runtastic Pro, you will 
have to enter it manually rather than it coming in from another app.
Strava
Strava is another fitness app similar to RunKeeper and Runtastic. Like those 
two apps, it will write to the Health app the data that it takes for active 
calories, cycling distance, walking and running distance, and workouts. It will 
also read from the Health app the date of birth, sex, and weight information.
Aside from RunKeeper, Runtastic, and Strava, there are many other fitness 
apps, too numerous to mention, that make use of the sensors in the Apple 
Watch. Try several and then stick with the one you like best.
Medical ID
The Medical ID screen in the Health app gives your name and birth date 
as well as any medical conditions that you have chosen to reveal about 
yourself. If emergency medical personnel encounter you at a time when you 
are unable to communicate, information listed here could enable them to 
give you more appropriate treatment than they otherwise could.
Setting New Goals
After you have set goals that stretch your capabilities just a little bit, you will 
eventually reach a point where you are able to meet those goals consistently. 
When this happens, it is time to set new goals. Perhaps you should be 
running a longer distance or at a faster speed. Perhaps you should increase 

CHAPTER 6: Building Strength and Endurance with the Workout App
94
the number of minutes per day that you spend working out. Aim to always 
be in the position of being just slightly out of your comfort zone. A workout 
should be hard work. Just make sure you do not overdo it.
Summary
The Workout app is the Apple Watch’s primary tool for motivating you to 
engage in vigorous exercise of some form every day. If you use it on a 
consistent basis, you will get stronger and faster and have more endurance. 
The secret to progress is to use the app consistently. Once use of the Workout 
app becomes habitual, your fitness level will improve as a matter of course.

Chapter 7
Using the Apple  
Watch with the iPhone 
Health App
Strictly speaking, the Health app is an iPhone app, not an Apple Watch app. 
It was around long before the Apple Watch was introduced. However, the 
arrival of the watch has increased the value of the Health app tremendously. 
The Apple Watch senses your movements and vital signs in real time while 
you are exercising and transmits that information directly to the Health 
app via the Bluetooth connection between your Apple Watch and your 
iPhone. The Health app records this data and presents it to you in graphical 
form as well as in the form of raw data. With the charts on the Health app 
Dashboard, you can tell at a glance how far you have run or walked today, 
what the range of your heart rate has been today as well as for the current 
month, and perhaps the number of steps you have taken.
Configuring the iPhone Health App
iOS8 and newer versions of the Apple operating system on iPhone will have 
an Apple Watch icon on the Home screen, as shown in Figure 7-1.

CHAPTER 7: Using the Apple Watch with the iPhone Health App 
96
When you tap the icon, the My Watch screen shown in Figure 7-2 appears.
Figure 7-1.  iPhone screen showing Apple Watch icon

CHAPTER 7: Using the Apple Watch with the iPhone Health App 
97
The My Watch screen first shows controls such as App Layout, Airplane 
Mode, and Apple Watch, followed by a list of built-in apps. Scroll down 
to find the Health app. Select it and enter the information that it asks for, 
which includes birth date, sex, height, and weight. These facts will be used 
by formulas that calculate key information, such as your body mass index 
and how hard you are pushing yourself during an exercise. This information 
may also be shared with third-party fitness apps to augment the information 
that they collect on your workout sessions. One of the cool things about the 
Health app is that it acts as a central hub for all your health and fitness apps, 
both native and third party. They can all share data with the Health app, and 
vice versa.

Setting Your Watch as a Data Source
Once your Apple Watch has been paired with your iPhone and once the 
built-in apps, such as the Activity app and the Workout app, have been 
downloaded to it, your Apple Watch will automatically be considered as 
a data source for those apps. You will also want your watch to be a data 
source for third-party health and fitness apps that you may have. I will 
discuss several of these apps in Chapter 9, along with how to set your 
watch as a data source for them.
Using the Health App Main Menu
When you tap the Health app icon to call it up, you will be placed into one 
of four modes, identified by icons at the bottom of your iPhone screen. They 
are Dashboard, Health Data, Sources, and Medical ID.
The Dashboard, shown in Figure 7-3, displays graphs of metrics showing 
a history of your fitness and health stats. Some of these are provided by 
default to get you started; others you can add yourself. You can also delete 
default graphs that you don’t want.

CHAPTER 7: Using the Apple Watch with the iPhone Health App 
99
The Health Data screen, shown in Figure 7-4, is divided into seven major 
categories. Many of these hold data that you enter manually, but two of 
them, Fitness and Vitals, also can accept data directly from the Apple 
Watch, as well as from third-party applications.
Figure 7-3.  Dashboard

CHAPTER 7: Using the Apple Watch with the iPhone Health App

Figure 7-4.  Health data
The Sources screen shows the apps and devices from which the Health 
app can accept data. As Figure 7-5 shows, my copy of the Health app can 
accept data from the MyHeart ResearchKit app, Runkeeper, Runtastic Pro, 
and Strava, as well as from my Apple Watch and from my iPhone.

CHAPTER 7: Using the Apple Watch with the iPhone Health App 
101
The Medical ID screen (Figure 7-6) shows your picture, your name, and your 
age, as well as any medical conditions that might be helpful if you ever need 
medical help but are not able to communicate.
Figure 7-5.  Sources

Tracking the Data That Interests You
The data-gathering capabilities of the Apple Watch can be both a blessing 
and a curse. They are a blessing in that you are able to record and analyze 
information that it was not practical to collect in the past. They are potentially 
a curse in that so much data is collected that separating the signal from the 
noise can be daunting.
What you want to do is track the data that interests you and be able to easily 
ignore the rest. For tracking the data of interest, the Health app’s Dashboard 
graphs give you an overview of the data items of interest and show such 
things as variability from day to day as well as trends in the data.
Data is captured and maintained in these seven categories:
 Body Measurements
 Fitness
Figure 7-6.  Medical ID

CHAPTER 7: Using the Apple Watch with the iPhone Health App 
103
 Me
 Nutrition
 Results
 Sleep
 Vitals
All of these areas are important to a person’s overall health, but the Apple 
Watch is particularly involved with the Fitness and Vitals categories.
Fitness Data
The main message that the Apple Watch conveys regarding fitness is that 
action enhances fitness. The more active you are, the more fit you are likely 
to become and likely to remain. There are a variety of things you can do 
to remain active. Having multiple activities that keep you moving will also 
keep things interesting. With its accelerometer and with the iPhone’s GPS, 
the Apple Watch can get a good sense of how active you are. Primarily, it 
measures activity in terms of calories burned.
Active Calories
Calories (actually kilocalories but called calories for short) are a measure of 
heat. Just being alive and keeping your body up to 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit 
burns calories. Even sitting still burns calories. Sitting motionless while 
contemplating your next move in a tough chess game burns more calories 
than you would imagine. It is said that the brain actually uses up to 20 
percent of the total calories consumed by a person. What those chess 
players claim is actually true: thinking is hard work.
However, the calories you burn keeping alive and thinking are not active 
calories. Active calories are the calories that you burn when you go above 
and beyond and get your body moving. The more vigorously you move, the 
more active calories you will burn.
Cycling Distance
The Workout app discussed in Chapter 6 enables you to record both 
outdoor and indoor cycling workouts. When you are cycling outdoors, the 
GPS function on your iPhone will enable the app to calculate the distance 
you have traveled. When you are cycling indoors on a stationary bike, the 
Workout app will estimate how far you have gone, based on accelerometer 
readings and heart rate. In both cases, the Workout app will send its 
calculated distance to the Health app, and it will show up on the Health 

CHAPTER 7: Using the Apple Watch with the iPhone Health App 
104
app’s Dashboard as well as appearing as numeric data when you tap the 
Show All Data option of the Fitness ➤ Cycling Distance category.
Flights Climbed
The Workout app does not record actual flights of stairs climbed but does 
record workouts on a stair-stepper machine in the gym, which simulates 
climbing flights of stairs. If you want to record actual flights of stairs that you 
have climbed, you can enter the number of flights manually and keep track 
that way. This is the same thing you would do, for example, to manually enter 
your weight after you weigh yourself on your bathroom scale every day.
If you want to record time spent on a stair stepper, you will have to translate 
the time you spend on the machine into flights of stairs climbed and then 
enter that number manually into the Health app’s Health Data section, 
namely, the Fitness ➤ Flights Climbed category.
NikeFuel
NikeFuel is a metric for measuring whole-body movement. It is implemented 
with an app running on either an iPhone or Android phone, which uses 
accelerometer readings to sense and record your body’s movement. 
Movement that NikeFuel detects is routed to the iPhone Health app, where it 
can be displayed on the Dashboard along with the other fitness metrics that 
you choose to display.
Resting Calories
The Health app differentiates between active calories and resting calories. 
Resting calories are burned by keeping your heart pumping and other vital 
processes operating, as well as contemplating your next chess move. 
You also burn a few resting calories while deciding whether you want your 
groceries to be bagged in paper or plastic. The Health app records resting 
calories, but neither the Activity app nor the Workout app includes resting 
calories in their totals. If you want to record resting calories, you will have to 
do so manually, possibly using figures you obtain from a third-party fitness 
app that records total calories rather than just active calories.
Steps
The Apple Watch uses its accelerometer to estimate the number of steps 
you take in the course of a day. Those readings are automatically transferred 
to the Health app on your iPhone and show up on the Dashboard’s Steps 
graph. The graph gives you a rough idea of how active you are by showing 

CHAPTER 7: Using the Apple Watch with the iPhone Health App 
105
how many steps you have taken so far today, compared to how many you 
took each day of the current week, month, or year. Figure 7-7 shows the 
Steps graph and the controls you can use to configure the display.
Figure 7-7.  Steps graph
The graph shows you how many of your steps your source app or device 
has recorded so far today, as well as a history of how many steps you have 
taken in past days.
Walking + Running Distance
For most people, walking and running are the two activities that will make 
up the bulk of a person’s body movement activity, although cycling may 
rate high for some. Walking and running recorded either by the Workout 
app or by one of the third-party fitness apps that runs on the watch will be 
transferred to the Health app and appear on the Walking + Running Distance 
graph on the Dashboard. A quick glance at the graph (Figure 7-8) will tell 
you whether you need to go for a run before you wrap things up for the day.

CHAPTER 7: Using the Apple Watch with the iPhone Health App 
106
Workouts
The Workouts graph (Figure 7-9) shows the time spent working out per day 
in hours and minutes. Data comes from the Apple Watch’s Workout app and 
also from third-party fitness apps.
Figure 7-9.  Workouts graph
Figure 7-8.  Walking + Running Distance graph

CHAPTER 7: Using the Apple Watch with the iPhone Health App 
107
Warning  If you activate both your Watch’s Workout app and a third-party 
fitness app, the Workouts graph will take data from both, making it look like you 
are working out twice as long as you really are. Your workout is counted twice.
This just means that if you are concerned about accurately tracking your 
workout time, you should choose to use either the Workout app or one  
third-party app of your choice. Having, for example, Runtastic and Strava 
both running while exercising would also double count your workout time.
Vitals Data
Under the Vitals category, the basic signs of your overall level of health are 
recorded. These are the things that health professionals check whenever 
you go to the doctor for any reason: blood pressure, body temperature, 
heart rate, and respiratory rate. If any one of these indicators deviates from 
what is considered normal, that gives the doctor a clue as to where your 
trouble might lie. Of course, it’s good to know this information even before 
you go to the doctor. Early detection of a problem could cause you to seek 
treatment before a condition becomes acute.
Blood Pressure
Although the Apple Watch does contain a pulse oximeter, which theoretically 
can be used to measure blood pressure, blood pressure readings are not a 
feature of the watch’s first release. Speculation abounds on why this may 
be so. However, since the hardware is present, it is possible that a future 
software update may release the capability to measure blood pressure. Then 
again, maybe not. We will just have to wait and see.
Body Temperature
When you visit the doctor’s office, a medical assistant probably sticks a 
temperature probe in your mouth to take your temperature. The Apple 
Watch does not have a temperature probe, and even if it did, you probably 
would not want to stick it into your mouth anyway. Any time you do have 
your temperature measured, you can manually add that measurement as a 
data point to the Health app if you want.

CHAPTER 7: Using the Apple Watch with the iPhone Health App 
108
Heart Rate
The Apple Watch measures your heart rate, and those measurements show 
up in the Health app (Figure 7-10). This happens automatically, without any 
manual intervention. Readings are taken throughout the day, and a bar on 
the Heart Rate graph extends from the lowest heart rate measured during 
the day to the highest. If the automatic measurements do not happen as 
often as you like, you can always start the Workout app, which will take 
readings on a frequent basis.
Figure 7-10.  Heart rate graph
If you want, you can also see the raw data that is used as the basis for the 
graph (Figure 7-11).

CHAPTER 7: Using the Apple Watch with the iPhone Health App 
109
Respiratory Rate
Respiratory rate is measured in breaths per minute. Like blood pressure, 
this is a vital sign that could be measured by the sensors within the Apple 
Watch but is not offered in the first release of the Apple Watch. Picking up 
rhythmic chest expansions from the wrist is a challenging measurement to 
make. We will have to wait to see whether this is ever offered. However, the 
capacity is there to record this data in the Health app, so if you ever have 
your respiratory rate measured at a clinic or sports medicine facility, you can 
enter that data manually, and it will appear on the Health app Dashboard.
Figure 7-11.  Showing all data

CHAPTER 7: Using the Apple Watch with the iPhone Health App 
110
Summary
If you are a stats geek like I am, after you have run the Health app for a 
while, you will soon find yourself referring to it often. The information it 
records and displays on your fitness-related activities and heart rate gives 
you a near real-time view of the state of your fitness and your overall health. 
It can also give you advance warning of incipient problems before you 
would otherwise become aware of them. The usefulness of the Health app 
is multiplied by its connection to the Apple Watch, over what it is when used 
only with the iPhone.

Chapter 8
The ResearchKit Health 
Projects
A physician’s guiding principle is “First, do no harm.” As a result, new 
treatments for diseases must be tested thoroughly, preferably in double-
blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials, before they can be 
approved and then prescribed to patients. For trial results to be considered 
statistically significant, a large number of study participants are needed, 
and typically recruiting enough participants with a given disease or with 
susceptibility to the disease is difficult. Progress in translating research into 
clinical treatments is slower than it could be because of this bottleneck in 
the process of conducting clinical trials.
The recent phenomenon of crowd sourcing has the potential to break the 
logjam by opening up a large pool of potential test subjects for research into 
common ailments. Millions of people own iPhones and Apple Watches. Many 
of these people would like to see medical research move ahead faster and are 
willing to devote some of their time and effort to help. Apple’s ResearchKit is 
aimed at those public-minded Apple Watch and iOS device owners.
What ResearchKit Is and How Researchers 
Can Use It
ResearchKit is a platform upon which applications can be built that gather 
information from the sensors on the Apple Watch and iPhone, which 
specifically address highly targeted health-related questions. Researchers in 

CHAPTER 8: The ResearchKit Health Projects
112
a wide variety of medical fields can team up with app developers to create 
apps that monitor the location, activity, and vital signs of participants on a 
continuous basis.
With millions of Apple Watches on the wrists of people all over the world, 
researchers will have little difficulty recruiting thousands of participants. The 
large number of enrolled participants massively increases the statistical power 
of the conclusions that are drawn from the research studies. The research 
can be conducted much more cheaply than would normally be the case, an 
important point at a time when research grants are getting harder to win.
Diseases Initially Addressed by  
ResearchKit Apps
The first research studies to use ResearchKit apps are designed to gain 
insight into five diseases that cut a path through huge swaths of the 
populace, causing great suffering and drastically shortening lives. Let’s take 
a brief look at each.
Asthma
Asthma is a respiratory disease due to chronic inflammation of the airways in 
the lungs. It is characterized by wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, 
and coughing. In severe cases, it can be fatal. Approximately 300,000 people 
die per year worldwide from asthma, and about 280 million people are affected 
by it to a greater or lesser degree. Asthma is the third leading cause of death in 
the United States after heart disease and lung cancer.
Asthma is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. 
There are a number of genes that are involved and a wide variety of 
environmental conditions that can trigger a severe asthma attack among 
those who are genetically susceptible.
Mt. Sinai, Weill Cornell Medical College, and LifeMap have developed the 
Asthma Health app with ResearchKit. In addition to collecting data daily on 
the condition of study participants, using the Apple Watch link to its paired 
iPhone’s GPS capability, it can also warn them of a potential asthma attack 
trigger, such as high air pollution when they are about to enter an area that is 
currently under an air pollution alert. Maybe it would be better to wait and go 
downtown on another day.

CHAPTER 8: The ResearchKit Health Projects
113
Parkinson’s Disease
Parkinson’s disease is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous 
system. It is characterized by movement-related symptoms including 
shaking, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty walking. It is a 
progressive disease and in advanced stages affects cognitive function 
and behavior. Most cases occur after age 50, and the disease becomes 
progressively more prevalent at higher ages.
Globally, about 7 million people are affected by Parkinson’s disease, of 
which about 1 million reside in the United States. In 2013, approximately 
103,000 people died of Parkinson’s disease worldwide. The disease is a 
tremendous and growing drain on the healthcare systems of all the countries 
of the world.
The University of Rochester and Sage Bionetworks have developed the 
mPower app, which uses the sensors and computing power in the iPhone 
and Apple Watch to measure a person’s dexterity, balance, memory, and 
gait. The gyroscope in the Apple Watch can sense abnormal movements, 
enabling researchers to track the progression of the disease. Participants 
may also notice their own symptoms and report them.
Diabetes
There are several types of diabetes, the most prevalent of which is 
diabetes mellitus, also known as Type 2 diabetes. It is a metabolic disorder, 
characterized by high levels of glucose in the blood, due to insulin 
resistance. Incidence of diabetes mellitus has grown dramatically coincident 
with the worldwide growth of obesity in recent decades. As of 2010, 
approximately 285 million people had been diagnosed with the disease. 
Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease, which typically chops ten years off 
the life expectancy of people who have the condition. People with diabetes 
are more likely to suffer complications such as heart disease, stroke, 
diabetic retinopathy, and kidney failure. Blood flow to the limbs is impaired 
in advanced cases, sometimes requiring amputation.
The Massachusetts General Hospital has developed the GlucoSuccess app, 
which is used to track the diet, physical activity, and medication use of study 
participants. It can also inform participants how their food choices, activity 
level, and medication compliance affect their blood glucose level. This 
could lead to behavioral changes that improve the quality and length of the 
participant’s life.

CHAPTER 8: The ResearchKit Health Projects
114
Breast Cancer
Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women. It affects 
men too but is 100 times more common in women than in men. Although 
treatment has improved dramatically in recent years and extended the lives 
of breast cancer survivors, there were still more than 521,000 breast cancer 
deaths worldwide in 2012. North America has the highest breast cancer rate 
in the world, so a disproportionate number of people with the disease reside 
in North America.
A diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer probably has a more devastating 
psychological impact on those who are diagnosed with it than on those with 
any other type of cancer. Depressed mood and fatigue are common side 
effects of treatment.
The Share the Journey app, developed by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, 
UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Penn Medicine, and Sage Bionetworks 
enables study participants to give information about energy levels, cognitive 
ability, and mood. The object of the study is to find ways to improve the quality 
of life of people after they have been treated for their cancer.
Cardiovascular Disease
Cardiovascular disease is the number-one killer in the developed world. 
It shortens lives and causes great distress for those affected by it, either 
directly or indirectly. The cardio part of the word cardiovascular has to do 
with the heart, and the vascular part has to do with the arteries and veins 
that the heart pumps the blood through in order to supply oxygen to all the 
cells of the body. If a cell doesn’t get oxygen, it dies. If enough cells die, the 
person dies.
Sometimes the blood cannot get to where it needs to go because blood 
vessels are clogged up with plaque. Other times a blood clot blocks a major 
vessel also preventing blood from going where it is needed. If the heart is 
not beating with a regular rhythm, that can also be deadly, as can various 
defects in the heart’s valves.
The MyHeart Counts ResearchKit application, created by Stanford University 
in association with the American Heart Association, first asks participants 
a series of questions about themselves. These include the usual statistics, 
such as birth date, sex, height, and weight. It also asks what time a person 
usually goes to sleep and when they usually wake up.
After people sign up, they are asked to check in every day and answer a 
few questions. Some of these questions are asked only once, while those 
that might change on a daily basis are asked every day. In addition to the 

CHAPTER 8: The ResearchKit Health Projects
115
questions answered, the app also takes data recorded by the watch’s 
gyroscope and accelerometer, as well as the iPhone’s GPS readings, to tell 
how active you are.
Periodically, the app will ask you to take the six-minute walk test. For this 
test you are asked to walk as far as you can in six minutes. Over the course 
of the study, any change in your maximum walking speed will be noted. 
In addition to the distance walked, your average and maximum heart rate 
during the test will also be recorded.
Every day, the app will ask you whether you wore your Apple Watch all day 
and all night yesterday, or just all day. Since the watch’s battery does not 
last 24 hours between charges, you will most likely answer “All day but not 
all night.” You may also answer “About half the time” or “Rarely if at all.” 
Figure 8-1 shows this screen. 
Figure 8-1.  Question about how long you had your watch or iPhone on you yesterday

CHAPTER 8: The ResearchKit Health Projects
116
It will also ask you whether you engaged in any activities yesterday that 
were not recorded (Figure 8-2). If you say yes, it will ask how long and how 
vigorous those activities were. Finally, it will also ask you how many hours of 
sleep you logged last night (Figure 8-3).
Figure 8-2.  Question about whether you engaged in any activity that was not recorded

CHAPTER 8: The ResearchKit Health Projects
117
What Future ResearchKit Apps Will Do
As time goes on, you can expect that many more researchers will use 
ResearchKit apps as a means of tapping into a large population of potential 
test subjects. If one of these is on a subject that you would like to help 
advance, you can volunteer to participate. Ideally, the result will be a benefit 
to many people in the future and possibly even yourself.
Summary
This chapter covers the ResearchKit tool that researachers in a variety of 
fields can use to gather data from large numbers of Apple Watch users, thus 
increasing the statistical power of any conclusions they come to. The first 
applications are all medical in nature, but any research that can make use 
of the physiological parameters or movement data recorded by the Apple 
Watch is a candidate for a ResearchKit application.

Chapter 9
Third-Party Health and 
Fitness Apps
Although the built-in health and fitness apps are well designed (as we have 
all come to expect from Apple), they do not have the depth that is available 
from developers whose whole business revolves around health and fitness. 
Many mature health and fitness apps are available for the iPhone. Some 
of the best of these have extended their iPhone apps to make use of the 
convenience and added functionality of the Apple Watch. In this chapter,  
I will give brief descriptions of a few of them, highlighting the best features 
of each and describing the added capability provided by the watch.
In the first release of the software development kit (SDK), Apple did not give 
third-party developers the ability to acquire data from the watch’s heart-rate  
sensor. With the advent of watchOS 2, this capability has now become 
available to developers. Alternatively, you can feed heart-rate data to your 
third-party apps by pairing a Bluetooth chest-strap heart-rate monitor with your 
iPhone. With the chest-strap monitor, you will not be able to see your heart rate  
on your wrist while exercising, but you may be able to see it by glancing at 
your phone, both in your third-party app and in Apple’s Health app. The Health 
app will take heart-rate data from a Bluetooth chest-strap heart-rate monitor if 
one is present and from the Apple Watch if one is not present.
The purveyors of third-party apps all want to make money from their apps, 
but different apps will do that in different ways. Some apps will provide basic 
functionality for free and additional functions for premium or elite members, 
who pay a fee for the added value. Other apps, such as Nike+ Running, just 
want to encourage you to run more so that you will wear out your shoes 
sooner and buy a new pair of Nike shoes. In fact, Nike records not only 

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
120
the mileage of your runs but also the total accumulated mileage on your 
running shoes. When mileage exceeds a certain level, the app encourages 
you to buy a new pair of shoes. There is a direct link to the Nike store where 
you can buy not only shoes but all kinds of running apparel. Lacking an 
apparel store of its own, Endomondo runs advertisements for Under Armor 
and other sponsors at the bottom of the iPhone screen. The free version of 
Runtastic runs advertisements and also makes sure you know how to go to 
the Runtastic online store.
Nike+ Running
Nike, as you might guess from the name of its app, is primarily interested 
in getting people running. Runners need good shoes, and they run through 
them (pun intended) quite often. Runners need to replace their shoes more 
often than, for example, weight lifters or cyclists. Furthermore, runners 
who are trying to improve their performance are sure to want the kind of 
statistical information that can be provided by the sensor-laden iPhone and 
the equally high-tech Apple Watch.
The iPhone Part of Nike+ Running
The Nike+ Running app was available before the Apple Watch was 
released and gives runners a lot of information about their runs but, like 
all smartphone apps, is not particularly convenient to interact with while a 
person is actually running. The main advantage for runners, or exercisers of 
any kind, of the Apple Watch is that you can garner useful information from 
it with a quick raise of your wrist and a glance at your watch.
The main menu of the iPhone part of the Nike+ Running app, shown in 
Figure 9-1, indicates that there is some real depth to this app, with a variety 
of categories. Let‘s take a brief look at them.
Warning  A low-power Bluetooth connection between the iPhone and the Apple 
Watch, or between the iPhone and an external device such as a heart-rate monitor, 
can be a source of problems. Functions that once worked stop working. Apps 
that work on the iPhone don’t run on the watch. In many cases, these problems 
are because of Bluetooth communication issues. They can often be resolved by 
deleting the third-party app having the problem and then reinstalling it.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps

Home
The Home screen, shown in Figure 9-2, encapsulates your cumulative 
statistics. At the top it shows how far you have run since you started using 
Nike+ Running. In addition, it shows your average pace over that distance 
as well as the distance of your most recent run. Tapping BEGIN RUN at the 
bottom takes you to the Run Setup screen, where you can set up such things 
as whether you want to hear music while you run, whether you will be running 
outdoors or indoors, whether you want your phone display to be vertical or 
horizontal, whether you want to let your Facebook friends know that you 
have just started running, and whether you want to change your run settings.
Figure 9-1.  Nike+ Running app main menu

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
122
At the bottom of the Run Setup screen is the START button. Press it to 
begin a workout. A countdown timer that you set to a convenient interval, for 
example three seconds, begins. When it reaches zero, your run timer begins, 
as shown in Figure 9-3.
Figure 9-2.  Home screen
Note  If you are running indoors, for example on a treadmill, Nike+ Running 
cannot track your route with GPS and must estimate the distance you have 
run based on accelerometer and gyroscope tracking of your rhythmic body 
movements. This estimate will not be as accurate as the distance estimate of an 
outdoor run when you are carrying your iPhone with its GPS capability.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
123
There is a Pause button that you can press if you want to interrupt your 
workout for any reason. It takes you to a screen (Figure 9-4) where you can 
either resume the workout or end it. 
Figure 9-3.  A workout has started

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
124
To resume the workout, all you need to do is tap the green Resume button. 
To end the workout, press and hold the red End button. The workout will 
end, and you will be returned to the Home screen, which will now show your 
updated stats.
Activity
The Activity screen shows you a synopsis of your most recent runs: your 
distance, your pace, and your elapsed time, as well as how you felt and the 
type of surface you ran on. By scrolling up, you can see records of earlier 
runs. By tapping the right edge of one of those runs, a map of the route will 
be displayed, and the color of your track will indicate your relative speed: 
green for fastest, yellow for slower, orange for even slower, and red for 
stopped. Figure 9-5 shows where I walked with my dog, Mojave, who liked 
to stop and sniff the ground every now and then. The times that he did show 
up as red spots. An emoji shows that I felt good on the walk, and an icon 
shows that I have less than three miles on my Gel Nimbus 16 shoes.

Friends
Nike+ is a social community. If you want to join the community, select 
Friends and then press the MAKE MY ACCOUNT SOCIAL button. You can 
request that people you know who are already social members of Nike+ 
accept you as a Nike+ friend. You can keep up on how active your friends 
are, and you can motivate each other to be more active.
Challenges
You can challenge any of your Nike+ friends to a race. You set the distance 
and the time limit. An example might be 30 miles within 30 days. The first 
person to run the required distance within the stated time wins a virtual medal. 
Everyone who completes the challenge wins something. You can also accept 
a challenge posted by one of your friends. This is a good way to engage with 
your community and to motivate yourself and others to be more active.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps

Coach
This option gives you a virtual coach who will prepare you for a race in the 
future. You can specify a 5K, 10K, half-marathon, or marathon, and the 
coach will give you a program that will take you through the conditioning 
you will need to complete such a race. The program will include walking, 
running, resting, and cross-training, getting progressively more intense as 
race day approaches.
Settings
This option gives you the opportunity to set a number of variables, such 
as privacy settings, to the way you want them. For our purposes, the most 
important thing here is the instruction on how to configure your iPhone 
so that it links to your Apple Watch so you can view your progress while 
running, with a glance at your watch.
Shop Nike
Nike would be missing a chance if it didn’t take the opportunity to show you 
some of its featured products for runners, and this is the place it does it. The 
Shop Nike option is a direct link to the Nike.com web site.
Starting and Ending a Run from Your iPhone
You can both start and end a run with your iPhone as described earlier in the 
Home section. You can also start and end one from your Apple Watch. Let‘s 
look at that next.
The Apple Watch Part of Nike+ Running
Because of the small screen on the Apple Watch, there is not much room 
for displaying running statistics. However, the watch comes in handy by 
enabling you to both start and stop recording your run without hassling with 
your phone. When you select the Nike+ Running app from your watch’s 
Home screen, you see the Start screen shown in Figure 9-6.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
127
Tapping the figure of the runner launches the app, the audio coach on your 
phone announces “Beginning workout,” and the run timer starts counting 
elapsed time.
Tapping the watch during the run rotates through displays of Pace, Duration, 
and Miles (assuming you did not set your app to measure distances in 
kilometers). Figure 9-7 shows the Duration display.
Figure 9-6.  Nike+ Running Start screen
Figure 9-7.  The elapsed time of your run is one thing that is displayed
A glance at your watch will let you know how you are doing while you are 
running.
Using Force Touch shows the display in Figure 9-8.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
128
At the end of your run, be sure to press the End button so that the statistics 
recorded are accurate. If you want to pause in the middle of a run for any 
reason, such as taking a phone call, press the Pause button. Since you can 
store more than one choice of music to run by on your watch, you can even 
start listening to a new mix by pressing the Change Music button. There is 
no way to plug earbuds or headphones into the Apple Watch, but you can 
access the music stored on it with Bluetooth headphones.
Endomondo
Although fitness apps such as Nike+, Endomondo, RunKeeper, Runtastic, 
and their competitors were originally designed to track running sessions 
and still work best for that sport, it is possible to use some of these apps for 
other sports too. Different sports put different demands on the body, so their 
calorie burn rates will vary. Many third-party apps, Endomondo included, 
calculate calorie burn differently, depending on which exercise you tell it 
you are doing. Running burns more calories per hour than walking does, for 
example.
The iPhone Part of Endomondo
Like Nike+ Running, Endomondo has a main menu of options, shown  
in Figure 9-9.
Figure 9-8.  The End, Pause, or Change Music screen

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
129
Let‘s look at each option in turn.
Upgrade
Most of these third-party apps work on the same revenue model. A lot of 
effort and expense goes into developing these apps, and the companies 
that create them want to recover their investment and make a profit on top 
of that. They do this by providing a basic set of features for free and then 
charging for a “premium“ or “elite“ or perhaps “gold“ membership, which 
unlocks additional features that the user may find to be of value. After a user 
of the free product has developed a history with that product, she is unlikely 
to switch to a competitor and lose all that historical data about her past 
performance and progress. As she becomes more dedicated, she is more 
likely to upgrade.
Figure 9-9.  Endomondo main menu

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
130
In Endomondo’s case, a premium membership will give you additional 
statistics, access to training plans, and analysis of heart-rate monitor 
data. Because first-generation third-party apps do not have access to the 
Apple Watch’s heart-rate data, you must use a chest-strap monitor with 
a Bluetooth connection to feed heart-rate data to Endomondo. When the 
Endomondo app is updated to work with watchOS 2, check to see what 
additional capabilities are present.
Endomondo helps support the free version of the app with advertisements. 
If you buy the premium program, you can elect to replace the space the ads 
take up with data that you might actually care to see.
There are a number of additional features available to premium users that 
people might find worth the cost of a membership.
Workout
During a workout, the app displays the number of kilocalories burned so far, 
the distance traveled, and the user’s heart rate in beats per minute. Figure 9-10 
shows the workout screen.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
131
This figure was captured partway through a walking workout when no heart-
rate monitor strap was being worn and no GPS signal was being received. 
Lacking GPS, the app could not record the distance traveled.
Figure 9-11 shows the result screen at the end of a workout when GPS is 
not working.
Note  Some fitness apps, such as Nike+ Running, will estimate distance 
traveled using body movements when GPS is not available, but Endomondo 
does not do this; it displays 0.00 miles.
Figure 9-10.  Workout screen partway through a workout

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
132
In addition to date and time of the workout, duration in minutes, calories 
in kilocalories, and hydration in fluid ounces are recorded. For a non-GPS 
workout, Distance shows as 0.00 miles. You can add a note if you want. The 
map at the top shows the entire contiguous United States because, lacking 
GPS, Endomondo could not narrow down location more precisely. There 
is an advertisement for Endomondo Premium at the bottom of the screen, 
which does not show in Figure 9-11. Nike+ Running does not display ads on 
the free version of the app but reminds users when they should start thinking 
about replacing shoes that have put in a lot of miles, and the main menu 
contains a link to the online Nike store.
Friends
The Friends option has two functions: it records your activities and shares 
them with friends, and it shares your friends’ activities with you. Figure 9-12 
shows the screen displaying my most recent activities.
Figure 9-11.  Workout Summary screen

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
133
Tapping the friends icon at the top right will switch the display to show the 
recent activity of your friends who are also using Endomondo. Endomondo 
friends are friends by mutual agreement. One of you must send an invitation, 
and the other must accept it.
History
When you select the History menu item, a scrollable screen appears that 
lists pointers to workout summaries of all the workouts that you have done 
since you started using Endomondo. Figure 9-13 shows my most recent 
workout history.
Figure 9-12.  Friends screen, showing user’s recent activities

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
134
In addition to today’s 36-minute walk with no operating GPS, a 1-hour and 
19 minute weight-training session is shown, as well as a 30-minute walk and 
a 5-minute treadmill run, which also shows zero miles run. Endomondo does 
not estimate distance run on a treadmill like the Apple Watch Workout app 
does when you specify Indoor Run.
More elaborate statistics are available to people who purchase a premium 
membership, including graphs showing trends over time.
Training Plan
Training plans are a premium feature of Endomondo, meaning they are not 
available on the free version of the product. However, if you would like to 
prepare for a race, going premium could well be worth the cost. A training 
plan is tailored to your current level of fitness and is dynamically adjusted as 
you go along. You can train for anything from your first 5-kilometer race to a 
marathon. A plan can help you if all you want to do is increase your speed with 
no particular race in mind. An audio coach encourages you along the way.
Figure 9-13.  Recent workouts

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
135
Commitments
To keep yourself motivated, you can make a commitment to a certain 
distance, duration, or calorie goal, such as the one shown in Figure 9-14.
Figure 9-14.  A commitment to a running goal
Endomondo will periodically remind you of how you are doing and display 
what percent of your goal you have already accomplished. You can also 
receive encouragement from your friends by sharing your commitment 
with them, along with your progress toward achieving the goal you have 
committed to. Your friends can also share their goals with you.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
136
Challenges
Challenges are another way you can share mutual encouragement 
with your Endomondo friends. You can challenge specific friends to 
accomplish specific goals within a specific time frame at a specific sport. 
The competitive aspect makes it easier for you to motivate yourself to 
accomplish the goal of the challenge. Of course, if you have friends on 
Endomondo, they might challenge you to a goal of their choosing. In this 
way, everybody benefits. You can always decline to accept a challenge, if for 
some reason you do not want to engage in it.
Routes
Endomondo will store your favorite routes for you. You can create a route by 
tracing your route on www.endomondo.com and saving it. The app will calculate 
the distance and show it to you on a map, as shown in Figure 9-15.
Figure 9-15.  An example route

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
137
When you create a route, you can name it and specify whether it is private or 
public. If private, only you can see it. If public, any Endomondo member can 
see it and may challenge you to run that route in a faster time than they can 
run it.
One nice thing about public routes is the fact that if you are visiting some 
place and would like to take a run, you can be pretty sure that a public route 
listed on the Endomondo web site is a good one.
Settings
The Settings option on the Endomondo app is similar to the Settings option 
on other health and fitness apps. It enables you to set the parameters that 
you want your Apple Watch to display, including distance, heart rate, speed, 
duration, and average speed.
The Apple Watch Part of Endomondo
As is true for all the first-generation third-party Apple Watch apps, if the 
watch is separated from its paired iPhone by more than about 30 meters, it 
ceases to function. With the advent of watchOS 2, apps that are compatible 
with it will continue to work, as long as you are within range of a Wi-Fi 
signal. This is not much help when you are out on a trail run.
You can select the statistics that you want Endomondo to display during and 
after an exercise. Figure 9-16 shows the watch display after the five-minute 
treadmill run mentioned in the “History” section. Duration shows 5 minutes 
and 25 seconds. Distance on the treadmill shows 0.00 miles, and the app 
estimates that I burned 60 calories in the process.
Figure 9-16.  Duration, Distance, and Calories display

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
138
Sweeping a finger across the screen from right to left shows additional statistics, 
although in this case they are not very helpful, as shown in Figure 9-17.
Figure 9-17.  Pace, Average Pace, and Heart Rate screen
Because no distance was measured, the Pace metric shows a blank, and 
Average Pace shows zero minutes per mile. Heart Rate shows zero beats 
per minute because heart-rate monitoring was not being done. It’s kind of 
a hassle to put on a heart-rate monitor chest strap, and after you do, it is 
not the most comfortable thing in the world. The fact that the Apple Watch 
measures heart rate without you even having to think about it is a real 
advantage. It is unfortunate that the first-generation third-party apps such as 
Endomondo cannot use the data from the watch heart-rate monitor.
RunKeeper
Although running is implied by the name RunKeeper, as is the case with 
Endomondo, RunKeeper will adjust the calorie burn rate it calculates, based 
on the activity you are doing. The choices are as follows:
Running
Cycling
Mountain Biking
Walking
Hiking
Downhill Skiing
Cross Country Skiing

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
139
Snowboarding
Swimming
Wheelchair
Rowing
Nordic Walking
Other
The iPhone Part of RunKeeper
As Figure 9-18 shows, the main RunKeeper screen on the phone shows 
where you are on the map and prompts you to start a run.
Figure 9-18.  RunKeeper main screen

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
140
Type of workout, route, and music playlist can be specified at the top of 
the screen, and a menu sits at the bottom, along with an advertisement for 
RunKeeper Elite, the paid version of the app.
The menu at the bottom has options of Me, My Plan, Start, Friends, and 
Settings. The Me screen, shown in Figure 9-19, shows how many miles you 
ran last month and how many you have run so far this month.
Figure 9-19.  The Me screen
It shows how many activities you have recorded on RunKeeper and links to 
detailed records of all those activities. It also offers Insights as a premium 
feature, informs you of any challenges, charts workouts per week over the 
past couple of months, and lists your personal records.
The My Plan option takes you through a series of questions that determine 
what you want to achieve and where you are right now on the road to 
getting there. RunKeeper will then tailor a plan to your requirements, but you 
will need to be an Elite member in order to get it.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
141
The Friends option informs you whenever a RunKeeper friend has performed 
an activity and also informs all your RunKeeper friends when you complete 
an activity. As you would expect, the Settings option enables you to set up 
RunKeeper the way you want it.
At the end of a run, RunKeeper shows you the route you have run along with 
your time, pace, and calories burned (Figure 9-20).
Figure 9-20.  A short out-and-back by the river
In addition to time, pace, and calories, RunKeeper also gives you splits at 
mile marks and stacked graphs that show pace, elevation, and heart rate. 
Figures 9-21 and 9-22 show those three graphs.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
142
Figure 9-21.  Pace and elevation graphs

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
143
The halfway point of the run was also the peak elevation. I stopped for a 
minute there, as chronicled by a drop in my heart rate. Resuming the run 
brought my heart rate back up to what it had been before the pause.
The Apple Watch Part of RunKeeper
The Apple Watch component of RunKeeper gives you all the information and 
control that you need before, during, and after the run. You can safely keep 
your iPhone in a pocket, without having to refer to it until later when you 
want to examine your stats. Figure 9-23 shows the Start screen.
Figure 9-22.  Elevation and heart rate graphs

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
144
The Pause button enables you to pause the run. If you press it, you are given 
the choice of resuming or ending the workout. After you have ended it, you 
can either save or delete the workout. Later you can consult your phone at 
your leisure to look at saved workouts.
When you tap the Go Running button, a friendly voice emerges from your 
pocketed phone, announcing that the run has started. Along the way you 
can see how you are doing, as shown in Figure 9-24.
Figure 9-23.  RunKeeper Start screen
Figure 9-24.  Screen while run is in progress

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
145
As with the other apps in this category, the user is given the chance to “Go 
Premium” just below the circular button that you tap to start recording a run.
Figure 9-26 shows what you see at the end of a run.
Strava
The Strava fitness app is specifically aimed at running and cycling, and you 
can switch from one to the other on the fly during a single workout. The 
capabilities are similar to those of the other apps described in this chapter, 
but the presentation of the information is somewhat different.
The iPhone Part of Strava
On the iPhone part of the Strava app, Figure 9-25 shows the start screen for 
running.
Figure 9-25.  Running Start screen

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
146
A map of the route taken is displayed, along with distance, time, average 
pace, and calories burned. Swiping from right to left shows the elevation 
profile of the run, as shown in Figure 9-27.
Figure 9-26.  Statistics at the end of a run

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
147
Figure 9-27.  Elevation profile
The route displayed has a steep climb at the end of the course.
Tapping the Pace button shown in Figure 9-27 gives you a graph of your 
pace as it varied over the course. Figure 9-28 shows what this looks like.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
148
Split times appear in a bar graph at the bottom of the screen in Figure 9-29.
Figure 9-28.  Record of pace over the course of a run

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
149
As you would expect, the steep uphill stretch was a lot slower than the 
earlier part of the route.
The Apple Watch Part of Strava
The Apple Watch part of the Strava running and cycling app is rather 
minimalist. Figure 9-30 shows the start screen for running.
Figure 9-29.  Bar graph of split times

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
150
LifeSum
LifeSum is a health and fitness application, but it approaches those topics 
from a different perspective than the apps I have covered so far. Whereas 
the apps, both built-in and third party, that I have covered so far deal with 
time and effort spent exercising, LifeSum is primarily concerned with the 
flow of calories through a person‘s body. It records everything that a person 
eats and drinks in a day to arrive at a total number of calories consumed 
The start screen for cycling is similar, except instead of a running shoe 
inside the circle, there is a bicycle. After a run is completed, the route taken 
is displayed on the watch, as shown in Figure 9-31.
Figure 9-30.  Start screen for running
Figure 9-31.  Route displayed after a run

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
151
and balances that against calories burned through exercise. The beginning 
user of LifeSum enters their current weight and a target weight. LifeSum 
then generates a program that will take the person from their current weight 
to the target weight they want to reach. If users are below their calorie goal 
for the time of day, LifeSum encourages them to eat. If they have not drunk 
enough water, they are encouraged to down a glass of water. In addition to a 
daily calorie goal, consumption of carbohydrates, protein, and fats are also 
tracked and compared to target values. Ratios vary depending on the user’s 
goals. A person wanting to lose weight would have different needs from a 
body builder.
The iPhone Part of LifeSum
After you have configured LifeSum on your iPhone, the Diary screen looks 
something like Figure 9-32, which is my screen at the beginning of a day 
before I have consumed anything.
Figure 9-32.  Diary screen at the beginning of a day

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
152
Eight glasses is the minimum that LifeSum recommends that a person 
drink in a day. As you add records of exercise that you do, additional empty 
glasses will appear, indicating that your hydration needs have increased 
because of your increased activity.
It shows the number of calories I should consume today to stay on track 
with my weight loss goal (1943) as well as the number of grams of carbs, 
protein, and fat that should be included in my day’s diet. It also shows that 
so far I have consumed zero calories and have burned zero calories through 
exercise. The lower part of the scrollable screen shows the top part of the 
launch pad for a demo of LifeSum.
In addition to helping users track the calories they consume and burn, 
LifeSum also encourages them to keep adequately hydrated. Figure 9-33 
shows eight empty 8.9-ounce glasses that will be filled as you press the plus 
sign to indicate that you have drunk the equivalent of a glass of water.
Figure 9-33.  Water tracking section of Diary screen

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
153
Figure 9-35 shows the Diary section that covers lunch, dinner, snacks, and 
exercise before you have made any entries for the day.
LifeSum records what you eat and drink for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and 
snacks, as well as what exercise you do. It holds a large database of foods 
for which it knows the calorie content and a database of exercise activities 
along with the number of calories burned per unit time by engaging in 
those activities.
Note that if you want to eat a food that is not in the LifeSum food database, 
you can add it by using the LifeSum barcode scanner on your iPhone by 
pressing the SCAN A BARCODE button shown in Figure 9-34 and then 
aiming your phone at the barcode on the new food product.
Figure 9-34.  Using the barcode scanner to add a new food

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
154
Almost too faint to be seen in Figure 9-35 is the recommendation that I 
consume between 583 and 777 calories for lunch, between 758 and 991 
calories for dinner, and between 0 and 389 snack calories.
You can enter what you have eaten in either LifeSum‘s desktop app or its 
mobile app. After you have entered breakfast, your Diary will look something 
like Figure 9-36.
Figure 9-35.  Diary section at the start of a day

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
155
Each component of the meal is listed along with the number of calories it 
contains. Figure 9-37 shows the snack section of the Diary and shows that 
I have gone overboard on snacks today, packing away 699 calories that put 
me 48 calories over my target for this time of day (2:11 p.m.).
Figure 9-36.  Breakfast entry in Diary

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
156
If you have been faithful at making an entry in your LifeSum Diary every time 
you drink water as well as every time you eat anything, LifeSum will keep 
you up to date. Figure 9-38 shows that I had downed six glasses of water by 
6:56 p.m. 
Figure 9-37.  Snack section of Diary

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
157
By the end of the day, as shown in Figure 9-39, I had added another snack, 
pushing my snack calorie total up to 869. I’m really going to have to do 
something about that. I had also done a little exercise, giving me 67 calories 
to balance against the 869 in snacks. I have to do better than that, and 
LifeSum will help me to do it by making the imbalance glaringly obvious.
Figure 9-38.  Keeping track of daily water consumption
Note  Don’t take the recommendation of eight glasses of water every day as 
gospel. Different people have different hydration needs, based on their body 
type, how hot it is, how much they sweat, and how active they are. Also, any 
liquid such as tea, juice, or soda is almost entirely water and should count too. 
For sure, beer counts.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
158
At the end of the day, Figure 9-40 shows that I had consumed 1,647 calories 
but had burned only 67 in exercises. I have my eating pretty much under 
control but will have to do better in the exercise department.
Figure 9-39.  Too many snacks, too few exercises

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
159
The Apple Watch Part of LifeSum
The Apple Watch portion of the LifeSum app does two things. First, it 
enables you to enter your meals and exercise sessions without pulling out 
your phone. Second, it delivers timely reminders if you are under or over 
your calorie, water drinking, or exercise goals for a particular point in the day. 
Figure 9-41 shows a reminder screen that you would get early in the day.
Figure 9-40.  End-of-day calorie totals

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
160
You can specify that you have eaten either a small, a medium, or a large 
breakfast. Whether a breakfast is classified as small, medium, or large does 
not depend on the size of the breakfast but on its calorie content. Thus, 
a large bowl of oatmeal with skim milk would be a small breakfast, but a 
couple of pancakes with butter and maple syrup and a couple of sausages 
would be a large breakfast. Average calorie values are assigned to the small, 
medium, and large breakfasts, so the accuracy is not nearly as good as 
it would be if you entered the actual foods you ate into your iPhone, your 
laptop, or your desktop computer. If you want, you can enter the Small, 
After eating breakfast, when you tap the green “Add breakfast” button, the 
screen in Figure 9-42 appears.
Figure 9-42.  How big was your breakfast?
Figure 9-41.  Encouragement to eat a healthy breakfast

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
161
Similar messages appear for other meals, snacks, and exercise sessions. 
I have found LifeSum to be helpful in keeping me within range of my food 
consumption goals, and it gives me subtle encouragement to shift my diet 
in a healthier direction. I can counter consuming too much fat by not putting 
quite so much peanut butter on my whole-wheat bagel. The bagel is actually 
pretty good without anything on it at all.
Runtastic
Runtastic is primarily a running app, similar to Nike+ Running, Endomondo, 
RunKeeper, and Strava. As you have seen, there are small differences 
between these apps, but the main functions are largely the same.
The iPhone Part of Runtastic
Like Nike+ and Endomondo, Runtastic has a main menu that you access 
by tapping the three stacked horizontal bars in the upper-left corner of your 
iPhone screen. Figure 9-44 shows most of the options. You can see the rest 
by dragging a finger up from the bottom of the screen.
Figure 9-43.  Breakfast data has been entered
Medium, or Large description of your breakfast and edit it from your iPhone 
later to replace the value of the meal with the calorie counts of what you 
actually ate.
Once you have entered a value for a meal, your Diary will give you an 
“attaboy,” such as the one in Figure 9-43, and tell you how many calories 
you have left to match your calorie consumption goal for the day.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
162
Activity
The Activity option takes you to the screen you see at the start of a run or 
other activity (Figure 9-45). The pulsing blue dot on the map shows where 
GPS has located you. The Start button is at the bottom. When you press 
the Start button, your activity either starts immediately or starts after a delay 
that you are able to set, in seconds.
Figure 9-44.  Runtastic main menu

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
163
Figure 9-45.  Activity screen at the start of a run
When the activity starts, a voice announces “Session started,” and the 
clock starts counting seconds. There is now a slider at the bottom of the 
screen. When you drag it from left to right, the session is paused, and the 
voice helpfully says “Session paused.” At this point, the slider is replaced 
by two buttons; the one on the left says Finish, and the one on the right 
says Resume. These do what you would expect. The Finish button ends the 
activity. The Resume button picks up where you left off when you dragged the 
Pause slider. Figure 9-46 shows the screen after tapping the Finish button.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
164
By selecting an emoji, you can give a snapshot of how you felt and how 
challenging the route was. Tap the Done button when you are finished. At 
this point, the friendly voice will summarize the statistics of the run and 
display what has been recorded (Figure 9-47).
Figure 9-46.  Characterize how you felt and what the course was like

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
165
Pressing the mountain icon in the top center will display weather information 
as well as the emojis that you have selected. Pressing the bar graph icon will 
display a graph of your speed throughout the course as well as its elevation 
profile. At the bottom, your splits are given along with elevation gain and 
loss during each of the splits. Figure 9-48 shows this data-packed screen.

By tapping whichever activity interests you, the same screen appears that 
you saw at the conclusion of that activity. The stats, weather, speed and 
elevation graph, and split table are also available.
Statistics
The Statistics screen (Figure 9-50) gives you your performance metrics for 
the previous month and a snapshot of how you have done so far this month.

It displays distance covered, time engaged in activities, elevation gain, 
elevation loss, kilocalories burned, and cheers received from your friends for 
your efforts.
Newsfeed
The Newsfeed option lets you share with your friends what you have been 
doing and enables you to see what they are doing. Figure 9-51 shows the 
time, weather condition, and route of a 1-mile walk. It also shows award 
icons for greatest elevation gain, fastest kilometer, and fastest mile walks.

You can see what your friends who use Runtastic are doing. You can also 
make new friends by asking to see the activities of nearby users who may not 
be your friends already. Find someone who seems to be running the same 
distances that you are at about the same pace, and you may have found 
yourself a good running partner. Figure 9-52 shows what this looks like.

Another thing you can do is show your running friends (or walking friends, 
cycling friends, and so on) what the course looked like on your most recent 
activity. Figure 9-53 is an example, showing the road less traveled.

Routes
Runtastic users have the ability to add their favorite routes, whether for 
running, walking, cycling, or any other activity that involves going from one 
place to another, to a geographic database on the Runtastic web site. Just 
specify the route on a map by clicking points on the route. This is a great 
way to discover interesting routes that other people have found enjoyable or 
challenging. Figure 9-54 shows one of my favorite routes (in blue), along with 
pieces of routes that other people have entered (in black).

When you create a route, you can enter a description of it, and Runtastic 
will include a graph that shows the elevation profile of the route.

Training Plan
Olympic champion Dieter Baumann has developed several training plans, 
including a weight loss plan that will help you to lose weight over a span of 
22 weeks, and several running plans that range from plans for the complete 
beginner all the way to plans to prepare you to run (and finish) a marathon. 
Plans are aligned to how fast you want to run. In addition to the running 
training plans, there is a Bikini Body Prep plan for women, conducted by 
Lunden Souza, a certified personal trainer.
Training plans are free to Premium members of Runtastic.

Colors indicate speed, where blue is for easy warming up and cooling 
down, green is for slow running, yellow is for medium running, and red is for 
fast running.
Interval Training
Interval training is one of the best ways to increase speed and endurance. 
High-speed intervals are interspersed with low-speed intervals. During the 
high-speed intervals you run faster than you normally would, and during the 
low-speed intervals you recover to prepare yourself for the next high-speed 
interval. Several programs are offered, as shown in Figure 9-56.

Story Running
Story Running is a Premium feature. You can choose a story that runs 
somewhere between 30 and 40 minutes and listen to it through your 
headphones or earbuds while you run. The story could be science 
fiction, adventure, travel, inspiration, or something else, but the common 
denominator is that you are in the story and success depends on you to run. 
You could be running to escape ravenous wolves, to lose weight, or just to 
enjoy a run through the scenic beauty of Austria, described in detail by the 
program narrator.

The Settings screen enables you to customize the way the app behaves. 
Figure 9-57 shows you the types of things you can control.

The Units option enables you to specify whether reports will be in terms of 
miles, pounds, and degrees Fahrenheit or in terms of kilometers, kilograms 
or stone, and degrees Celsius.
The Voice Coach option allows you to toggle the voice on or off that makes 
helpful announcements during a run.
GPS senses when you are stopped. If Auto Pause is enabled, every time 
you stop, Runtastic will pause the clock that is timing your run so that your 
stopped time does not lower the pace that is recorded. This saves you 
from manually pausing the clock when, for example, you stop to take a 
phone call.
LIVE Tracking lets you share an activity in real time with your Facebook 
friends or people on the Runtastic.com web site. It can send you cheers to 
keep you motivated while you are running or working out.
The Heart Rate option lets you hook up a chest-strap heart-rate monitor and 
sync it to Runtastic. If you do hook up such a monitor, it will send its data to 
the iPhone Health app just like your Apple Watch does.
Speaking of the iPhone Health app, the Partner Accounts option on the 
Settings menu is the place where you enable connecting Runtastic with the 
Apple Health app. You can also connect to MyFitnessPal here. Both are 
resources for retaining a record of your fitness-related activities.
You can use the Social Sharing option to share your activities on Facebook 
and Twitter.
Go to Shop
This option takes you to Runtastic.com, where you can buy more Runtastic 
merchandise.
More Runtastic Apps
As the name implies, this option encourages you to download other 
Runtastic apps, such as Runtastic Me, Road Bike, Mountain Bike, Sleep 
Better, Leg Trainer, and Butt Trainer.
The Apple Watch Part of Runtastic
With the Apple Watch part of the Runtastic app you can start, pause, and 
end a run, as well as elapsed time, distance covered, and heart rate if you 
have your chest-strap heart-rate monitor on and active. The first generation of 
Runtastic cannot access the heart-rate data generated by the Apple Watch. 
To see that, you must go to the Health app on your iPhone. Even if you control

If you press the History button on the main screen shown in Figure 9-58, a 
display similar to Figure 9-61 will appear. It shows your three most recent 
activities and is scrollable so that earlier results can be displayed.
Press the green Start button and the activity will commence, either 
immediately or after a programmed delay that you have previously specified 
on your phone.
When you finish an activity, pressing the screen will activate Force Touch 
and display a screen giving you the option to either end or pause the 
activity. If you end it, the screen in Figure 9-60 will appear, giving you the 
opportunity to record how you felt during the activity and what kind of 
terrain your route took you over. You may also be given the option to share 
the activity on Facebook.

The main things you probably want to know about your current and previous 
activities are right there on your wrist. If you want more details, you can find 
them on your phone. Even more is available at Runtastic.com, which you 
can view on an iPad or PC.
Runtastic Six Pack
There are other kinds of fitness in addition to the aerobic fitness you get 
from running, walking, cycling, and other sports that get you breathing hard. 
One is to sculpt your body into the best possible shape. Perhaps the most 
iconic example is someone with “six-pack” abs.
Six-pack abdominal muscles are not easy to come by. The abdominal 
muscles must be strengthened and toned, but they also must be uncovered. 
Most people have a layer of fat that hides any six-pack that might be lurking 
underneath. Getting rid of excess fat is accomplished through diet, as 
covered by the LifeSum app earlier in this chapter. Strengthening and toning 
the abdominal muscles calls for physical movement exercises, which is what 
the Runtastic Six Pack is all about.
Figure 9-62.  Statistics display
Selecting Statistics from the main menu will show you something similar to 
Figure 9-62. It shows your totals for the current month in distance, duration, 
and elevation gain. Scrolling down will also show you elevation loss, calories 
burned, and cheers received from your friends.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps

Let‘s look at each of these options in detail.
Training Plan
Figure 9-64 shows the initial Training Plan screen. It describes the Level 1 
training plan that will get you started with three sets of three exercises, with 
eight repetitions in each set.
The iPhone Part of Runtastic Six Pack
The Runtastic Six Pack app goes beyond merely timing and recording an 
activity like other apps covered here do. It actually coaches you through a 
training program. The free version of the app introduces you to an avatar 
who performs the exercises that make up the training program. You are 
encouraged to perform the same exercises right along with the avatar. The 
main menu includes a number of helpful tools to move you along on your 
way to six-pack abs. Figure 9-63 shows the menu.
Figure 9-63.  Main menu

Figure 9-64.  First Level 1 exercises
The first exercise is the Tabletop Crunch + Twist (Figure 9-65). Your virtual 
trainer, either Daniel or Angie, performs the exercise, and you follow along. 
Your cadence is called by a narrator’s voice, and appropriate music is played 
in the background.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
182
After three sets, you move along to the Hip Drops exercise (Figure 9-66).
Figure 9-65.  A snapshot in the middle of the Tabletop Crunch + Twist
Figure 9-66.  Hip Drops exercise when twisted to the left
The Crunch is the final exercise in this phase of Level 1. Figure 9-67 shows 
Daniel in the midst of performing it.

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
183
After completing these three exercises the prescribed number of times, you 
move on to new exercises. There are seven in all that comprise Level 1, 
which you will cycle through in ten days. To move on to Levels 2 and 3, you 
must purchase the full version. The seven Level 1 exercises will clearly be 
good for you, but 50 are available to purchasers of the full version, which 
can be had for a reasonable purchase price.
My Workouts
After you have gone through the training plan, to keep your momentum, you 
may decide to perform one or more of the predefined workouts described 
under the My Workouts option. Figure 9-68 shows the first of them and lists 
the names and durations of all five. All of these workouts are available only 
with the full version of Six Pack. The first, the Get in Shape workout, can 
be completed in less than nine minutes. The remaining four workouts take 
anywhere from 6 to 29 minutes to perform.

All Exercise Videos
There are three levels of exercise videos: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Seven 
of the easy ones are available to users of the free version, but the rest 
of the easy ones and all the medium and hard ones are available only to 
purchasers of the full package. Figure 9-69 shows the Easy exercises.

All Tips of the Day
Helpful tips can make your journey smoother as you move toward your 
fitness goals, whether that includes building a six pack, running a new 
personal record for the mile, or lifting more weight than you ever have before. 
Currently there are more than 50 tips of the day that you can cycle through.
Body Fat Visualization
The Body Fat Visualization graph shows what your body should look like, 
based on your weight and percentage of body fat. The Runtastic Libra is a 
device that measures not only your weight but also your body fat and water 
percentages. Data is transferred via Bluetooth to your iPhone. Figure 9-70 
shows the Daniel avatar as he would look with 13 percent body fat. Based 
on your actual measurements, made by the Libra, Daniel would be a stand-in 
for you, showing how you look with the most recent measurement of your 
percentage of body fat and weight.

Get the Full Version
This option is just a plug for upgrading to the full version of Runtastic 
Six Pack. Depending on your goals and how helpful you are finding the 
free version to be, you may decide to spend a few bucks and get the full 
package. It looks like it is worth the price to me.
Settings
Under the Settings option shown in Figure 9-71, you can select a training 
plan, a trainer, and a voice coach, and you can connect a chest-strap heart-
rate monitor.
Figure 9-70.  Visualizing the ideal you

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
187
Naturally, Runtastic would like you to buy and connect its own brand of 
heart-rate monitor, but these devices all work the same way, so competing 
brands will work just as well.
Partner Accounts will let you connect with MyFitnessPal. If you do, Six 
Pack will share information with MyFitnessPal, and vice versa. MyFitnessPal 
can serve as a central repository for data about fitness that comes in from 
multiple apps, with Six Pack being only one of them.
The Use AirPlay with your Apple TV option will enable you to watch Daniel 
or Angie go through their paces on the big screen. This could be easier than 
trying to hold an iPhone while doing sit-ups.

Pressing the Next Training button will take you to the start of the training 
plan that you are currently working on. If you are at the beginning of Level 1, 
you will see the screen shown in Figure 9-73.
Music Store
At the Runtastic Music Store you can buy music packs in a variety of 
genres that are all designed to keep you motivated and moving. One pack 
is provided for free so you can see what the packs are like without having to 
buy one first.
More Runtastic Apps
As I’ve noted elsewhere in this book, Runtastic has multiple apps, each 
aimed at helping you in a different way. You can download them from this 
menu option.
The Apple Watch Part of Runtastic Six Pack
Once you are familiar enough with a training plan so that you don’t need to 
watch Daniel or Angie do the exercises while you are doing them, you can 
launch the Six Pack app on your Apple Watch. This will display the screen 
shown in Figure 9-72.
Figure 9-72.  Six Pack main menu

CHAPTER 9: Third-Party Health and Fitness Apps
189
When you tap the Start button, the voice coach on your phone will start 
talking you through the exercise in the same way as when you do the same 
exercise from your phone. The only difference is how you pause or end the 
session. Instead of tapping a control on your phone, press on the watch 
face to activate Force Touch. Options to pause and stop will appear, as well 
as the option to skip to the next exercise. If you elect to stop, when you 
come back later, Six Pack will return you to where you left off rather than 
taking you back to the beginning. Once you start on a training plan, your 
virtual trainer wants you to work through it to completion.
If you press the My Workouts option on the menu in Figure 9-72, a message 
will appear informing you that the workouts are available only in the full version 
of Six Pack. If you have the full version, then you can pick one of the five 
workouts described earlier in the iPhone section and shown in Figure 9-68.
Summary
For me, the real value of the Apple Watch as a tool to enhance health and 
fitness is delivered by the third-party apps rather than the built-in apps 
provided by Apple. This is even more true with the release of watchOS 2, 
which allows third-party apps to access the sensors on the watch. Even in 
their initial releases, the third-party apps provided a lot more information 
than the built-in apps do. The fact that this information is available on the fly 
while I am exercising, and can be accessed by a quick glance at an upraised 
wrist, is how the Apple Watch really earns its place on that wrist.

What Could Be 
Improved?
No product is ever perfect. Whatever it is, it can be improved. This is especially 
true of the first release of a technical product such as the Apple Watch. 
Apple has worked hard to make the Apple Watch as useful as possible, 
while still being able to release the product while the market window was 
still open. There are some improvements that Apple will have to make to 
ensure the watch’s continuing success. There are others that fall into the 
“nice-to-have” category. It will be interesting to see how many of these ideas 
ultimately are incorporated.
Increase Battery Life
Apple claims that with normal usage, the Apple Watch battery should last 
about 18 hours before it needs to be recharged. This means that some 
people will wear their watch from the time they wake up to the time they 
lay down at night with no problem. It also means that other people will 
continually run out of power before they run out of day. Apps use power, 
Bluetooth uses power, notifications use power, alerts use power, and flicking 
your wrist to illuminate the display uses power. The more things you use 
your watch for, the more power it will use. The bottom line is that the people 
who use their watches the most will run out of battery power the soonest 
and find themselves in the Power Reserve situation in which the functions 
they depend upon are unavailable and all they can do is read the time. 
Shortly thereafter, they can’t even do that. Thus, the number-one thing that 
needs to be improved is the battery life. This is probably not something 

CHAPTER 10: What Could Be Improved?
192
that can be accomplished with an application software update, although if 
an app is being a particular drain on the battery, it might be updated in a 
way that helps a little. It would be good to know, on an app-by-app basis, 
how much power each app is drawing. Perhaps Apple could provide that 
information, and users could decide whether they really need one that turns 
out to be a power hog.
Incorporate GPS into Apple Watch
Apple has marketed the Apple Watch as a health and fitness accessory, 
and indeed, fitness buffs have been early adopters of the device. People 
who want to track their activity, such as runners, walkers, or cyclists, are 
interested in knowing where they have been on a recent outing, rather 
than merely receiving an estimate of the number of steps they have taken. 
Location data requires GPS. The iPhone has GPS capability, and while you 
carry it, you can know the route you have taken. However, one of the great 
advantages of having a fitness watch for an athlete is that she does not have 
to carry her phone on a run or other workout. Unfortunately, when you leave 
your iPhone behind, you leave your GPS capability too. The Apple Watch 
will record how long you have been gone and estimate how many calories 
you have burned, but it will not tell you where you have been.
It’s fine to say that Apple should add GPS capability to the Apple Watch, 
but there is a price to be paid for that capability. Adding GPS to the Apple 
Watch would add weight and take up space. This would likely require the 
Apple Watch to be bigger and bulkier. However, the biggest disadvantage is 
that the watch would draw more electrical power and run down the battery 
sooner. If it is true, as I claim, that the most needed improvement of the 
Apple Watch is to increase its battery life, adding GPS would be pushing 
things in the wrong direction. It’s hard to see how Apple could both increase 
battery life and add GPS capability to the watch at the same time, without 
compromising the elegant design of the original product. If history is any 
indicator of things to come, Apple will not compromise the elegant design.
Connect Directly to the Internet, Regardless 
of Where You Are
Just as you must have your iPhone on your person to use GPS to track 
where you are, you also need it to access the Internet when you are out of 
range of a Wi-Fi node. This means that although it is convenient to use the 
Apple Watch to receive notifications, alerts, e-mails, and stock quotes, as 
well as many other functions, you will need to be within range of Wi-Fi to 

CHAPTER 10: What Could Be Improved?
193
do so. Giving the watch all the major capabilities of an iPhone would be 
desirable, but it would entail added weight and bulk on the wrist and, most 
importantly, additional battery draw, causing the watch to run out of power 
sooner. Technology will have to advance before this capability is added to 
the watch.
Incorporate Blood Pressure Monitoring
Incorporating blood pressure monitoring is an additional capability that 
potentially will not require added weight or bulk because the hardware 
needed to perform this function is already included in the original version of 
the Apple Watch. However, the capability is not turned on. Apple has chosen 
to hold this capability back for reasons that I’m sure make sense to Apple. 
We will have to wait to see whether this capability is added at a later date 
through a software update or whether it will require a hardware modification. 
In the latter case, we are probably talking about buying a new watch, 
similar to the way we have needed to buy a new iPhone every time we want 
significantly upgraded capability.
Incorporate Oxygen Saturation Testing
The same hardware included in the Apple Watch that does blood pressure 
monitoring also does oxygen saturation testing. Because, in the initial 
release, this hardware is not activated, oxygen saturation is not monitored. 
If the capability is ultimately added, it will probably happen at the same time 
that blood pressure monitoring is added. As noted, this may be delayed until 
the technology improves, either by improving the accuracy of the reported 
results, by decreasing the amount of power this circuitry would draw if it 
were activated, or both. Oxygen saturation is a biometric value that has 
value to elite athletes who are trying to squeeze every possible ounce of 
performance out of their bodies. It would probably not mean much to casual 
exercisers who are just trying to maintain a healthy fitness level. This may be 
why Apple has not yet turned this feature on.
Activity App Algorithm Improvements
For the person who bought the Apple Watch primarily as an aid to health 
and fitness, the Activity app is the one that she will probably be referring to 
most often throughout the day. It is always running and always recording 
movement, exercise, and standing status. Thus, improvements in the Activity 
app will probably be the ones that watch wearers will notice the most.

CHAPTER 10: What Could Be Improved?
194
Deducing Whether a Person Is Sitting or Standing
One of the truly useful features of the Apple Watch is its ability to sense that 
the wearer has been still for more than an hour and alert her that it is time 
to stand up for at least one minute. However, it is somewhat annoying to 
receive this alert when a person has already been standing continuously for 
the past hour. Apparently the sensor responsible for this function cannot 
differentiate between a person who has been sitting for an hour and a 
person who has been standing in the same place for an hour. You don’t 
need to be a Buckingham Palace guard to stand unmoving for a whole hour. 
I often stand at my stand-up desk, doing my work, for more than an hour 
at a time. The Activity app tells me it is time to stand up anyway. I have 
found that I can satisfy it by leaving my desk and walking around in circles 
for a minute. This is probably just as well because I believe it is probably no 
healthier to stand in one place for an hour than it is to sit for the same length 
of time. Perhaps it would be better if rather than telling a person to stand 
for one minute, the Activity app would encourage her to move around for a 
minute.
Deducing Exercise to Include Nonaerobic Sports
Running, cycling, and even brisk walking clearly count as exercise. However, 
so do other things that do not necessarily transport your body from one 
place to another or raise your heart rate far above your normal level.
Vigorous weight lifting, where your muscles are fatigued to the extent that 
you cannot lift a weight even one more time than you already have, should 
count for something. However, such effort does not register on the Exercise 
ring of the Activity app. The Activity app should be improved to count more 
activities that should count as exercise but currently do not.
Add More Sports to Those Tracked by the 
Workout App
The Workout app tracks outdoor running, outdoor walking, outdoor cycling, 
indoor running, indoor walking, indoor cycling, stair stepper, rower, elliptical, 
and “other,” which is assumed to burn calories at the same rate as brisk 
walking. These are many of the most popular aerobic exercises, but the 
functionality completely ignores anaerobic exercises, such as weight lifting. 
In addition, there is no provision for many recreational activities, such as 
soccer, football, baseball, bowling, golf, and basketball. Running is involved 
with a number of these but not on a continuing basis, so, for example, using 

CHAPTER 10: What Could Be Improved?
195
the outdoor running option during a baseball game would give a calories 
burned estimate that is far from the number of calories actually burned.  
I’m not saying making an accurate estimate would be easy. Clearly, a pitcher 
is going to be burning a lot more calories than is a first baseman.
Summary
Clearly there are things about the Apple Watch that stand to be improved. 
Unfortunately, trade-offs are such that providing added capability in one 
area would require a decrease in capability in another. Just about any 
capability that you add will require additional power consumption, which 
implies a reduction in battery life, unless an entirely new type of battery 
is incorporated in the watch, one that has significantly increased power 
density. Such a “super battery” does not promise to arrive any time soon, 
so since extended battery life is probably the improvement that most people 
would want over any other, additional capabilities that require power are 
unlikely to appear in the near future. Having said that, additional capabilities 
that can be implemented by software upgrades may happen.

Appendix A
Setting Up Your  
Apple Watch
Because the Apple Watch is much more than just a watch, setting it up for 
the first time is somewhat more involved than just winding the crown as you 
would an old-time mechanical watch. The watch works hand in hand with 
your iPhone and must be paired with it so as not to be confused with any 
other nearby iPhones. Pairing your Apple Watch with your iPhone is covered 
in Chapter 3.
You will be asked to make some choices, such as whether you want to wear 
your watch on your left wrist or your right. I appreciate this option since I 
am one of the minority who prefer to wear their watch on their right wrist. 
The display is flipped 180 degrees from what it is for those who prefer their 
watch to be worn on the left wrist. With this capability, you can read it right 
side up regardless of which wrist the watch is on, and more importantly, you 
can easily operate the digital crown and the button next to it.
The My Watch Control Panel on the iPhone
Once you have activated your watch and paired it with your iPhone, you 
may want to customize a number of settings. The default settings will work 
well for most people most of the time, but you may find a few that you 
want to change. You can do this by tapping the Apple Watch icon on your 
iPhone’s main screen. This will display the My Watch control panel shown in 
Figure A-1.

APPENDIX A: Setting Up Your Apple Watch 
198
Here you will see the categories of options that you can modify. Options are 
also available for the built-in apps, as well as the third-party apps that you 
may have. Third-party apps on your iPhone that have extensions for the Apple 
Watch will have been automatically updated to enable your watch to use 
them. It’s a good idea to run through all these options at least once so that 
your watch is doing what you want it to do and displaying the information 
you want to see.

The Apple Watch Home Screen
The Apple Watch Home screen is the jumping-off point for whatever you 
want your watch to do for you. When you raise your wrist to look at your 
watch, it turns on and displays the time on the watch face that you have 
chosen from the many available. You can also customize the information 
that is shown on that watch face in addition to the time. Do any such 
customization with the My Watch app on your iPhone. Figure A-2 shows the 
default watch face.
Figure A-2.  The default watch face
In addition to your local time, it displays the day of the month, your next 
calendar appointment, the temperature, an icon showing your activity 
level so far today, and the time in Cupertino, California, where Apple’s 
headquarters is located. You can remove locations from the World Clock 
app (which is the source of this information) that you don’t want or 
substitute locations that you do care about. Tapping the miniature Activity 
icon will take you directly to the Activity screen, home of the famous Activity 
rings. These rings will give you a quick picture of how active you have been 
so far today.
