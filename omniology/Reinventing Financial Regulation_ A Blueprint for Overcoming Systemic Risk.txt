Reinventing 
Financial 
Regulation
Financial regulation has lost its compass and been led astray. The perspective 
of this book is neither that of the neoliberal who is instinctively against med-
dling regulators nor that of the unreconstructed Stalinist who is suspicious 
of private enterprise. If we are to finance better health and education for 
all of our citizens, we need economic growth. Growth requires risk takers. 
Too little risktaking starves the economy, feeding economic, social, and politi-
cal malaise. Excessive risktaking allows a few players to flash brightly before 
plunging us all into darkness. To achieve a Goldilocks1 amount of risktaking—
not too hot, not too cold, not too large, not too little—requires a fresh take 
on financial regulation. This is not to be confused with the decision to have 
more or less regulation—the binary choice presented by competing political 
ideologies. What we need is a substantial reinvention.
Chapter 2 sets the stage, showing why we regulate the financial sector consider-
ably more than we do other industries. This stems from the singular consumer 
protection problems that finance poses as well as the fact that banking is highly 
systemic. If a green grocer consistently sells bad apples, you can shop elsewhere 
with minor repercussions. By contrast, most people will only buy a few financial

products in their lifetime—a mortgage, a life insurance policy, a pension, and 
perhaps a car loan. Unfortunately they rarely find out if these are bad products 
until it is too late to rectify the problem. More importantly, the consequences 
of having swallowed the wrong product could be life changing. Perhaps it was 
an unlucky decision. But they might also have been persuaded to purchase 
something wholly inappropriate by a commission-grabbing salesperson. Much 
work is required to protect all consumers from conflicts of interest and the 
other causes of the mis-selling of financial products. Further measures are 
needed for protecting particularly vulnerable consumers. My thoughts on this 
are set out in Chapter 7.
By and large, the problem of consumer protection is understood. Systemic 
risk, on the other hand, is much cited but little understood. It is fast becom-
ing a phrase that means so many things that it no longer means anything in 
particular. In fairness, while consumer protection and systemic risk are distinct 
challenges with separate foundations and remedies, they are not always easy 
to differentiate, especially when in the throes of a financial crisis. Taxpayer 
bailouts of the financial sector during the highly systemic, Global Financial 
Crisis (GFC)2 of 2008–09 caused dramatic increases in public debt for those 
countries engulfed by the financial crunch. Amid slumping growth and ris-
ing unemployment, the crisis countries responded with varying degrees of 
public-sector belt tightening as well as central-bank largesse. This is not new. 
Past financial disasters have been similarly punishing for ordinary members of 
the public. The losers can be loosely classified as those most dependent on 
public-sector safety nets or with their savings in bank deposits and this time 
around the victors have been those with homes and other assets that rose in 
value as interest rates sank to zero.
Financial crashes and their responses are as political as they are technical—a 
subject I address in Chapter 3. Disgusted by the immorality of the situation, 
many justifiably angry people gravitate toward the bad apple theory of finan-
cial crises. They propose cleansing the system by locking up evil bankers and 
reclaiming their bonuses. No one doubts there is room to enforce existing 
laws more rigorously. But legal solutions offer little redemption. Crashes follow 
booms. Blame is widely shared and several of today’s villains were yesterday’s 
heroes. Courts are ill-equipped to sort that out in any coherent way.
Dissatisfied in neither seeing a lot of bankers led off in chains nor much change 
in bank behavior, voters and populist politicians began chanting “Never again!” 
and “Let the banks fail!” When the point is made that letting individual banks 
fail can have systemic repercussions, the common response is that bank res-
cues must be self-funded and specifically targeted to ordinary banking and 
2Throughout this book the Global Financial Crisis is abbreviated to GFC.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
there should be no opportunity for regulatory arbitrage between nations. 
Bailouts, it is shouted, must never again be taxpayer funded. Yet it is unclear 
that this is possible or desirable and in Chapter 4, I explain that the financial 
system is actually incapable of insuring itself against a systemic disaster.
All is not lost. Regulation can be reinvented to be less prone to the extremes 
of the boom-bust cycle and the iniquities this pattern brings. However, even 
reinvented regulation of the financial sector cannot be done through a single 
instrument.
We look at the issues of banning certain financial products in Chapter 9; 
restricting bankers’ pay in Chapter 10; the efficacy of pressing criminal law 
to change behavior in Chapter 11; using tax policy in Chapter 12; rearranging 
regulatory institutions in Chapter 13; and the role of international regulation 
in Chapter 14. The greatest inadequacy of financial regulation remains its 
inability to deal with systemic risk. That is where this book offers the greatest 
reimagination of financial regulation. I build the case in Chapters 3 and 4 and 
offer my proposals for dealing with it in Chapters 5 and 6.
The systemic character of banking flows from the nature of the credit econ-
omy. When a house owner borrows money from one bank to pay his builder 
for refurbishment, the builder may deposit the cash in another bank. That sec-
ond bank could then use the builder’s deposit to lend to someone else, who in 
turn uses that loan to pay another, who makes a cash deposit in a third bank. 
One bank’s borrower is thus another’s depositor, and that depositor serves to 
fund yet another bank’s borrower, and so on. The failure of one bank, causing 
the receiver to pull its loans, will bring down several others. This is the nub of 
the systemic risk problem. Connectivity in the banking system runs deep. No 
other industry is like this. It is also why regulators should be more wary than 
they have been in demanding systemic regulation of other sectors and activi-
ties in finance that are not as fundamentally systemic as deposit-taking lenders.
Shareholders of a bank usually worry only about the loss of their invest-
ment in that particular bank. They do not feel a responsibility to consider 
the combined losses of the shareholders, depositors, and borrowers in all the 
other banks that would be brought down by the failure of their bank. They 
believe that responsibility rests with others, namely the government. From 
the perspective of the financial system as a whole, therefore, shareholders 
underinvest in the safety of individual banks. One of the guiding lights of finan-
cial regulation—its North Star—is to make all banks take greater precautions 
than they would if left to their own devices. These safety measures should rise 
where a bank’s size or connectivity increases the probability that its failure will 
generate systemic repercussions. Regulation should seek to internalize this social 
externality so that bigger, highly connected banks face tougher requirements 
than their smaller or less connected competitors.

During the two decades or so prior to the GFC, the zeitgeist proclaimed 
that markets were the source of much that was right and good in the world. 
Governments bore the blame for what was wicked and wrong. Regulators lost 
their mojo—their ambition shrunk to encouraging the worst banks to look 
like the best. Banking regulation was crafted in the image of what the biggest 
banks said they were doing. Worse still, regulators achieved this by effectively 
mandating all banks to have the same expensive credit and risk models as the 
largest banks. Rather than having the big banks face tougher requirements, 
they were handed a competitive advantage. Some of the regulators scurrying 
around today wagging their fingers and declaring that no bank is too big to 
fail or jail were the very ones who contributed to them bloating in the first 
place. Regulators are also guilty of dismissing the concerns of those of us who 
argued that the new “risk-sensitive” approach to bank regulation emerging in 
the late 1990s would inflame systemic risks.3
Risk sensitivity sounds so correct that many blindly assumed it must be so. 
It is utterly wrong. Under the mantra of greater risk sensitivity, prudence, 
and transparency, banks were forced to set aside more capital for loans they 
thought were risky and less for those they thought were safe. They made 
this determination using regulatory-approved common risk models, driven off 
publicly available data. However, banks don’t generally get into trouble by issu-
ing loans they already estimate will be risky. Industry practice dictates they put 
aside more capital for these risky loans or secure greater collateral—like a 
lien on a business owner’s home—and agree on additional covenants. A typi-
cal demand is that the loan is instantly repayable in full unless the borrower 
keeps 12 months’ interest on deposit at the bank. Where banks frequently 
come undone is by issuing loans to those they believed were safe-but later 
became risky. Following the risk-sensitive approach, since the loans were clas-
sified as safe, they set aside the least amount of capital to guard against their 
failure. This is why the banks that looked wholly undercapitalized in 2008 
were often those that boasted levels of capital substantially above their mini-
mum, risk-sensitive, requirements just 12 to 18 months previously. Its not the 
things you know are dangerous that kill you.
Banks were all utilizing similar risk models fed by the same data. Inevitably 
their holdings were concentrated in the same assets that the models indicated 
provided the optimum mix of return and risk. In Chapter 8, I explain that the 
3As the Financial Crisis was emerging, Martin Wolf, Economics Editor at the Financial Times, 
speaking at the paper’s Annual Economists’ Dinner in November 2008, in London, said,  
“I am not seeking to deny that a few people saw important pieces of the emerging puzzle and 
some saw more than a few pieces. In my gallery of heroes is Avinash Persaud, who told us early 
and often that the risk-management models on which regulators foolishly relied were absurd 
individually and lethal collectively.”

concentrated purchases of these assets, bidding up prices and bidding down 
quality, turned these previously safe assets into risky ones. When they turned 
sour, the risk models instructed every bank to sell simultaneously. This turned 
them from uncorrelated, stable assets into correlated, volatile ones. Bank risk 
models were pushed into an apoplexy of selling orders that opened up liquid-
ity black holes in the financial system.4 Signs of this behavior were already 
visible during the Asian crisis of 1997–98, the Long-Term Capital Management 
debacle in 1998, and the dot-com bust in 1999–2000. Risk-sensitive regulation 
added to systemic risk. Regulators sought to make individual banks safe and 
ended up making the entire system perilously unsound.5
To work, the risk models required a fictitious view of risk, one in which there 
was just one thing called risk that could be dialed up and down. Whenever 
regulation failed the regulators would effectively try to dial risk down. Not 
only was this shutting the stable door after the horses had bolted but it unin-
tentionally created another risk. Attempts to reduce risk often simply pushes 
it elsewhere. When it caused a problem in that new site, regulators there 
simply shoved it along someplace else. The systemic implication of this is that 
risk kept on being thrust from site to site until it could no longer be seen. 
That is a dangerous space for risk to occupy.6
The reinvention of financial regulation must confront the paradox that the 
process of anointing something safe actually makes it risky for the reasons I 
previously cite.7 Safety is not statistical; it is behavioral. I argue in Chapter 5 
that managing risk in the system should not rest on contemporary estimates 
of what is safe or risky. Efforts to do so will inevitably fail. Risk sensitivity 
should be thrown out of the window. I suggest it is replaced with a new con-
cept of risk capacity. The first half of this book shows how that idea naturally 
emerges from a long, hard look at the actual challenges we face rather than 
the imaginary dragons we think need slaying.
When an institution has risk capacity it can absorb a risk. Take liquidity risk, 
the risk that an asset will fetch a far lower price if one is forced to sell it this 
minute rather than sell at a time within the next year or so. In Chapters 5 and 6,

Andrew Hill describes this as the “Persaud paradox”—wherein “the observation of safety 
creates risk and the observation of risk creates safety.”

I show that a young pension fund that does not need to raise cash to pay out a 
pension for five years or more has a capacity for liquidity risk. It can own assets 
for an extended time thereby avoiding the worst moments to sell. However, 
the same pension fund may have limited capacity to hold concentrated credit 
risk. Liquidity risks fall with time, but credit risks rise over time. The probabil-
ity that a credit will blow up in the next hour is much lower and more certain 
than the likelihood that it will explode anytime within the next five years.  
A bank with a diversified set of borrowers and overnight depositors has the 
capability of absorbing credit risks but little capacity to swallow liquidity risks.
The other key tenet of a reinvented financial regulation must acknowledge that 
different parts of the financial sector possess varying capacities for absorbing 
distinct risks. Moreover, it recognizes that this is a crucial source of systemic 
strength. Crude ring fencing of different sectors of the financial system will not 
make it safer. All this does is restrict natural fits between risk and risk capac-
ity. Such restrictions increase the system’s vulnerability. We need to promote 
an incentive structure that drives risks to the right places. Capital-adequacy 
requirements should be based on the mismatch between an institution’s risk 
capacity and the risks it is taking across the financial sector. By so doing, we 
would incentivize institutions with one type of risk capacity to safely earn the 
risk premium from buying assets with that type of risk and to sell other assets 
they own to those better suited to holding them. Risks would no longer be 
banished from the visible world and left to lurk menacingly in dark corners. 
They would instead be drawn to that part of the system where they are best 
absorbed. The system would then be safer than its individual parts.
The ideas presented are partly about a fallacy of composition. Trying to make 
individual financial firms safe does not necessarily make the financial system 
safe. This book is about how you risk manage the financial system from the 
start rather than dancing around the individual consequences of not doing so. 
After consumer protection, that must be the principal object of regulation 
and this book expands on these and related issues. It is a blueprint of how 
regulation can be reinvented so that the risktaking necessary for growth and 
development is done more safely. Finance is a fascinating subject. All of human 
emotions, failings and some virtues can be found there. In addition to argu-
ment, I have shared a number of anecdotes and stories in the hope that you 
will enjoy reading this book and will be enticed to join the debate.

Why Do We 
Regulate 
Finance?
And Do So Over and Above the Way We 
Regulate Other Businesses?
In this chapter, we look at regulation of financial institutions and how it differs 
from regulation in other industries.
Introduction: Why Regulate?
The debate surrounding regulation in general, not only of the financial variety, 
is polarized. There are those who are so suspicious of private enterprise that 
they believe almost everything should be regulated. Others are convinced that 
even well-intentioned regulation has such adverse unintended consequences 
that bureaucratic red tape should be cut to the barest of threads.

Worse than this polarization of opinion is the way prevailing opinion changes 
over time. During economic booms, when private-sector ambition knows 
no bounds, the laissez faire camp is triumphant in public debates—driving 
a ­liberalization agenda and skyrocketing sales of Atlas Shrugged.1 At some 
point, this trend of liberalization overreaches itself, thereby contributing to 
an unsustainable boom that eventually collapses. Amid the wreckage of the 
too-lightly-regulated economy, the more dirigiste minded nag that they told us 
so. The indignant public debates that follow help drive a wave of public inter-
vention. This begins to restrict some aspects of the economic recovery. The 
political, intellectual, and economic cycles create a system that do not check 
but amplify each other.
Before we get to financial regulation, it should be noted that financial firms are 
regulated like ordinary corporations. There are, however, some “carve outs” 
made for them—they are often exempt from both national and international 
competition laws on the grounds of financial stability. But they are gener-
ally subject to standard corporate laws and other laws of the land, such as 
­employment law, health and safety standards, and product liability laws.
So, why do we need to regulate finance over and above the way other firms are 
regulated? Why would company, product-liability, health and safety, and other 
laws not be adequate to protect those buying a financial good as opposed to 
any other good? I try not to wear too much philosophy and theory on my 
sleeve in this book though. I am conscious that if it is not on your sleeve it is 
probably hiding inside it. John Maynard Keynes famously wrote that “practical 
men who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influ-
ence, are usually the slaves of some defunct economist.”2
Let me say upfront, then, that my starting point for each issue that I grapple 
with in this book is that there should be regulation where there are significant 
“market failures.” Where there are not, the government should be reticent to 
regulate. Economists generally define a market failure as a situation where the 
outcome from unhindered private negotiations is biased in some way against 
1Atlas Shrugged is the 1957 novel by Ayn Rand that describes a dystopia in which society’s 
most successful businesspeople abandon their fortunes and the nation in response to 
aggressive new regulations.

Harcourt, Brace: 1936).

another outcome with which society would be better off—even after any 
winners have compensated the losers.3 I recognize that this seemingly light 
idea is laden with value judgments.
Many will find this position too circumscribed. Even if a market failure does 
not appear to exist, surely government is required to consider the conse-
quences of inequality and social capital. Governments routinely impose envi-
ronmental levies on private activity to provide a better future for us all. These 
are vitally important issues. However, there are reasons for continuing with 
this narrow starting point in terms of financial regulation— as opposed to all 
other aspects of government policy. One of the most important but neglected 
reasons why financial regulation failed in the first decade of the 21st century 
was that it was given too many additional tasks that undermined the focus 
on systemic resilience. Tacked onto financial regulation were goals of tackling 
fairness, anti-money laundering, and combatting the financing of terrorism. In 
the way they are currently constituted, these tasks are so pervasive that they 
lend themselves to a box-ticking, legalistic approach, as opposed to one based 
around incentives to promote better behavior. This infected the culture of 
regulation. But the triumph of the box tickers came at the expense of systemic 
resilience.
This is not to say that we should ignore the serious concerns of money laun-
dering, terrorist financing, and inequality. Where governments chose to pur-
sue a wide variety of worthy financial policies such as combatting financial 
crime, broadening financial inclusiveness, and distributing taxes more fairly, 
there should instead be separate agencies working on dealing with these 
issues specifically. They should not be lumped into one parcel of regulation 
that is the responsibility of an omnibus agency. The separation of goals and 
policies would likely improve the overall effectiveness of the financial system’s 
resilience as well as act to prevent financial crime. The hope would be that 
these agencies talk to one another and share information—but let’s not be 
too ambitious. We will return to these issues in greater depth in Chapter 13 
when considering the shape of financial regulation and its institutions.
3Market failures are commonplace and economists have broadly identified five causes. The 
first is when there are differences in information between two sides of a bargain, where 
one side knows less than the other. There could also be the nonexistence of competitive 
markets, which could limit profit or expand the production of a monopoly. Then, there 
may be “public goods” where people can benefit from or access something without having 
to pay to do so, like clean air or a public park in the city. The next cause of market failure is  
private contracts failing to fully internalize their effect on others, such as the effects of 
noise or pollution on neighbors. The final broad cause of market failure occurs when there 
are conflicts of interest between principals and agents—for example, when proprietary 
traders bet shareholders’ funds to boost their own bonuses.

While financial regulation should have narrow objectives, it still can, and indeed 
must, be carried out in a manner that recognizes some wider goals such as 
public trust. This might seem as if it’s nebulous and pandering to political 
correctness, but the consequences of a loss of public trust in regulation are 
tangible and substantial. During the global financial crisis that began in 2007, 
the public consensus was that a too-cosy relationship between government, 
regulators, and bankers had created a financial system that privatized the ben-
efits of banking to a few and socialized the costs and risks to everybody else. 
Public trust in regulators to do the right thing evaporated. One result of this 
is that any governmental rescue operation became politically constrained. This 
contributed to the decision to let Lehman Brothers fail, with the attendant 
deep and wide-reaching consequences that followed.4 It also led to a substan-
tial backlash and perhaps, in some areas, a swing in the pendulum of regulation 
too far the other way.
Market Failures in Finance That Require Specialized 
Regulation
There are two substantive market failures that are common in finance and 
less common elsewhere. It is these failures that require financial firms to be 
regulated over and above the regulation of firms in other sectors.
Lack of Consumer Protection
The first substantive market failure involves the financial market’s inherent 
weakness in protecting consumers. Markets protect consumers well when 
there are a large number of small, repeat transactions and when it is quick and 
easy to identify a “bad” purchase and avoid replicating it. 
If a green grocer in Grantham, England, Alfred Roberts, sold bad apples, soon 
enough the good people of Grantham would stop buying his apples and pur-
chase them from another green grocer. Alfred would have quickly spoken 
to his supplier to rectify the poor produce, and all the while his competitor 
would be reaping the benefits of the extra business. If Alfred’s supplier could 
4I was in Washington at the time of the G-20 Summit that took place shortly after Lehman’s 
failure in September 2008. I recall, amid the debris of the Lehman fallout, Lorenzo Bini 
Smaghi, the Euro-area G-20 deputy, coming out of a meeting and saying to the assembled 
officials and journalists something like, “We have decided not to let any important financial 
institution fail” and someone posing the question, “Why didn’t you decide that before 
the collapse of Lehman Brothers?” Without pause, Bini responded, “Before Lehman 
Brothers, there was not the political mandate to save the banks.” Whatever the judgment 
on whether Lehman should or should not have been saved, I think he was correct in his 
assessment of the change in political climate.

not deliver better apples, Alfred might decide to turn his apples into a fine 
cider. Consumers would benefit from the availability of a new product. In 
this scenario, market discipline works, everyone is better off, and Ayn Rand5  
followers are happy. Self-regulation works. 
Apples are a healthy choice but they do not make the world go around. Many 
markets are more complex. Consider the market for taxicabs, for instance. 
In a big city, it is unlikely you will hail the same cab twice over a short period 
of time. If you are new to the city and the taxi driver takes longer to get to 
your destination than necessary, or overcharges, you may not be aware of the 
abuse. Furthermore, the taxi driver will not bear the consequences, as you are 
unlikely to be a repeat customer. Unchecked market forces could encourage 
more taxi drivers to shortchange their passengers. This would give all taxi 
drivers a bad reputation. It would drive customers away from using taxicabs, 
creating both an unsatisfied need for taxicabs and unemployment among taxi 
drivers6—a classic example of market failure. Nobel laureates Joseph Stiglitz 
and George Akerlof highlighted the many market failures that arise out of 
information asymmetries and also their possible regulatory remedies.7 
The market failure that would arise without regulation is the rationale behind 
the widespread use of taxi-licensing schemes. Sometimes this regulation  
takes the form of a qualifying test or it may require tamperproof meters. 
Reporting infringements is usually made easy. Asymmetrical information is the 
reason why fares and taxis are more strictly regulated at train stations and 
airports, where passengers may be unfamiliar with the rules, and, pardon the 
pun, get taken for a ride. Few fear being ripped off when jumping into the back 
of a highly regulated “black cab” in London. Of course, while licensing systems 
protect consumers, they also protect industry incumbents—the cab drivers 
in this case—by creating barriers to market entry, reducing competition, and 
as a result raising profits. The strength of opposition to the mobile-taxi hailing 
“app” Uber by drivers of black cabs is a measure of how much they have to 
lose from greater competition.

When it comes to retail finance, like mortgages, life insurance, and pensions, 
consumers generally make a few large, seldom-repeated transactions—the 
exact opposite of the characteristics needed for a market to be good at 
protecting consumers. Moreover, financial transactions are often long term. 
Consumers only realize they have bought the wrong pension, life insurance 
policy, or endowment mortgage, often with severe consequences, long after it 
is possible to rectify the problem—because the original seller has moved on 
or closed down. Financial consumers need far more protection than consum-
ers of apples.
The traditional response to market failures, especially those born of asym-
metric information and conflicts of interest between “advisors” and “sellers,” 
has been to segment the market between retail and wholesale consumers. 
An ordinary retail consumer like “Aunt Agatha on the Clapham omnibus”8 
is someone who cannot be expected to have specialist knowledge of finance. 
Wholesale consumers like banks, hedge funds, and insurance companies are 
expected to, and indeed are paid vast sums to, have sufficient specialist knowl-
edge. In the name of consumer protection, how financial products are sold 
and represented to retail customers and any conflicts of interest arising from 
the transaction are rigorously regulated. This is one aspect of what is now 
referred to as microprudential regulation.
With wholesale markets between professional experts, the demand for con-
sumer protection is less and the need to support innovation and liquidity 
greater. In these markets, regulators rely on caveat emptor.9 This is the kind of 
elegantly simple solution that economists love, where the points of regulation 
appear to connect with the points of market failure. 
In practice, how best to protect consumers has been a live topic that is contin-
uously evolving—invariably in the direction of greater protection. This trend 
has been partly powered by cash-strapped governments placing increased 
choice and reliance on consumers. The shift in the burden of choice and the 
provision of pension, health, and education to ordinary households has led 
to the creation of new markets and, in turn, additional consumer protection 
rules. It is with some irony yet inevitability that the banks that pioneered the 
retail finance revolution in the United Kingdom, during which private pensions 
were partly filled with the shares of newly privatized utility companies, were 
the same banks caught up in misselling scandals just a few years later. Lloyds

policies through its branches between 2000 and 2001. No less than 44 percent  
of those policies were deemed unsuitable for the savers to whom they  
were sold.10 
Each spectacular failure of the misselling rules ushered in new rules. Following 
the misselling scandals of the 1980s, rules on how and by whom products 
could be sold were tightened. Some would argue that the subprime mort-
gage scandal that happened ten years later suggests they were not tightened 
enough. In the 1990s, a wave of scandals, revealed by the dot-com boom and 
bust, centered on the conflict of interests by bank analysts (do you recall the 
cases of Henry Blodget and Jack Grubman?11). This led to a strengthening of 
rules on conflicts and disclosures. By the early 2000s, those conflict-of-interest 
rules were again being scrutinized following the credit-derivatives scandals.12 
In practice, it is far from clear that regulating the sale of products to retail 
consumers has given them adequate protection. Instead, it has simply meant 
that they must sign ever-more-complicated waivers they do not understand.
Furthermore, during the previous and prior financial booms, wholesale cus-
tomers revealed their ineptitude in handling complex financial products, 
making the distinction in expertise between retail and wholesale consumers 
appear to be less useful than had been hoped. In short, there are a set of 
market failures, fairly unique to finance, that requires all consumers—not just 
the vulnerable—to be better protected. Market forces alone are inadequate. 
This is a critical role of financial regulation that we will return to in Chapter 7. 
Systemic Risks
The second type of market failure concerns the systemic nature of banking. 
Crucially, not all financial firms are involved in systemic activities. Unless they 
stray from the essence of insurance activity, insurance companies face risks 
that are not particularly systemic.13 Banking, however, is highly systemic. The 
essence of banking involves making loans that can be multiple times greater

these scandals.
12Much has been written about the conflict of interest between credit-rating agencies, 
issuers of credit instruments, and investors. I think the case, while legitimate, is overstated 
given that the vast amount of credit ratings on single issues where the same issuer-pays 
business model did not fail. However, the point is that there is great pressure for rules to 
address the issue. In November 2012, Australia’s federal court ruled that the credit-ratings 
agency Standard & Poor’s (S&P) misled investors prior to the Global Financial Crisis by 
giving its safest credit rating, AAA, to complex securities, which later lost most of their 
value. At time of writing, S&P has stated its intention to appeal the decision.

in Chapter 6.

than the initial capital funded by the bank through short-term deposits or 
other borrowing that the bank promises to repay in full with interest. The less 
the initial capital, and the wider the gap between interest paid and interest 
received, the more profitable it is for the bank. But there’s also a greater risk 
that the bank will come undone if a wave of bad lending wipes out its capital 
or if enough depositors seek a withdrawal of the cash that the bank has lent 
over the long term in order to earn a margin.
While it is clear why banks are vulnerable to failure, this alone does not 
explain why the failure of one bank can so easily undermine all banks. The fol-
lowing illustration may help to do so. When a customer deposits $1,000 in a 
bank, the bank may keep 10 percent in reserve and lend $900 to a borrower. 
The borrower may then pay this money to a supplier who deposits this in her 
bank, which keeps 10 percent in reserve and lends $810 to another borrower, 
who pays this amount to someone else, who deposits this in his bank, which 
keeps 10 percent and lends $729. This goes on and on until on the back of a 
single $1,000 deposit and 10 percent reserve ratio, almost $10,000 is lent and 
spent.14 The credit multiplier is large. It is also partly dependent on the size of 
reserves and capital the bank regulators impose.
If one bank fails and the receivers try to recover all of their loans, it will start 
a domino effect of bringing down many banks. This is a key difference between 
banking and almost any other industry. If the high street insurance broker 
fails, or Alfred Roberts’s green grocers goes bust, neighboring competitors do 
not also fail. Often the opposite is true. The failure of a competitor can cre-
ate more opportunities for remaining firms. Many believe that governments 
should let banks in difficulty fail rather than expensively bailing them and their 
highly remunerated employees out using taxpayer dollars. But these people 
neglect the interconnectivity of the credit economy. Governments are pushed 
into offering individual bailouts to banks because of the strong potential for 
failure of the entire banking system if they do not. 
Connectivity runs deep in the financial sector. Systemically important firms 
in this sector do not even need to be lenders. Credit-rating agencies, custo-
dians, and clearinghouses are not banks but they are highly connected par-
ties. A failure of confidence in one of them will have a systemic effect. The 
systemic nature of banking is also related to but not wedded to size. Lehman 
Brothers was one of the smallest of the bulge-bracket investment banks. Yet, 
on September 15, 2008, the failure of this relatively small bank almost took 
down the entire global financial system because of its interconnectivity, espe-
cially in the credit-derivative markets. 
14This is a fair approximation of what is going on, but in reality banks create deposits when 
they give loans.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
15
Moreover, the path of contagion does not always follow actual connections. 
There are not many choices for collateralized lending besides mortgages and 
car loans. The failure of a small bank lending to home owners could make 
depositors fear that their own bank was involved in similarly poor lending. 
This mistrust can start a run on deposits, reversing the credit multiplier and 
leading to widespread bank failures. It is important to remember that the trig-
ger points of the last financial crisis were not the kind of institutions to top 
anyone’s “too big to fail” list: Bear Sterns, Washington Mutual, Northern Rock, 
IKB, and Lehman.
Because of the multiple paths of contagion, just making banks smaller would 
not make the financial system much safer. In Chapter 4, we examine the issue 
of size in greater detail. But the wider point is one of externalities. Bank share-
holders will invest in the safety of a bank to balance their private returns with 
the risk that they could lose their original investment. This private calcula-
tion does not take into account the wider social costs of the collapse of the 
banking system that could follow the contagious collapse of one bank. From 
the perspective of the financial system as a whole, left to their own devices, 
shareholders would underinvest in bank safety. History, replete as it is with a 
large number of banking crises, suggests that this is so.15
There is an anxiety that banks are becoming increasingly irrelevant and it is 
the shadow banks—such as the highly leveraged investment houses that are 
effectively in the lending and insurance businesses—where the risks are piling 
up. Consequently, over time many nonbanks and their activities have become 
subject to additional regulation. This is primarily done in the interest of con-
sumer protection as well as ensuring these institutions are sound, operation-
ally secure, and well governed. 
There are genuine concerns, but they can be overstated from a systemic per-
spective. Like an ordinary shadow, these nonbanks are often connected to the 
banks. Most of them are only able to do what they do because they borrow 
from banks or because they appear to offer banking activities. While the insti-
tutions and instruments differ in every systemic crisis,16 what is common is 
that the growth of credit as well as the source of this credit through different 
avenues, invariably occurs at the banks. The regulation of bank lending from 
a systemic perspective and the enforcement of banking perimeters will influ-
ence what happens in the shadows to a large degree.

A Brief History of Financial Crises and Their 
Regulatory Response
Banking and financial crises prior to the 19th century, such as the South Sea 
Bubble17 or the Mississippi Bubble,18 were devastating but infrequent. These 
crises often arose in response to major wars that had bankrupted national 
treasuries, creating a supply of IOUs of various kinds. By periodically wiping 
out war debts, these crises had beneficiaries as well as victims. In the 19th and 
early 20th century, as the credit economy and international trade financed by 
credit grew, panic-occasioning bank runs were commonplace and the atten-
dant victims more widespread. It is no surprise that this period of financial 
instability coincided with the rise of political and economic thought on the 
inherent instability of laissez faire capitalism.19
By the middle of the 20th century, banking crises had dried up. This was 
a direct response to four institutional and regulatory changes. In the first 
place, central banks had evolved into the lender of last resort. Bank deposits 
were also insured by the government. Then, there was a reduction of conflicts 
of interest through a fragmentation of the financial system, enshrined in the 
United States in the 1933 Banking Act (known as Glass-Steagall) that sepa-
rated commercial and investment banking. And there was the Bretton Woods 
system, which fragmented international finance into financial flows that funded 
the trade of goods and services (relatively free of control) and flows for invest-
ment (more tightly controlled). We will return to each of these later.
17The South Sea Company was founded in 1711 as a public–private partnership to 
consolidate and reduce the cost of the British Government’s war debts. The company 
was granted a monopoly to trade with South America; hence its name. Essentially, it was 
a bet on the future outcome of the War of the Spanish Succession, which Britain was 
involved in, over Spain’s control of trade with South America. Company stock rose greatly 
in value as it expanded its operations dealing in government debt, peaking in 1720 before 
collapsing.
18The Mississippi Company of 1684 was founded earlier than the South Sea Company, but 
it was only converted to a similar purpose in 1718 at the height of the euphoria around 
the South Sea Company, an early version of international contagion of financial euphoria 
and despair and of Parisian financiers following in the footsteps of their counterparts in 
London. Even without the help of 21st-century communication, both companies collapsed 
together. In 1718, John Law’s Banque Royale had subsumed the Mississippi Company and 
others with a monopoly on trade in French possessions as well as the right it had been 
given to issue notes guaranteed by the king.
19Karl Marx wrote The Communist Manifesto in 1848 and Das Kapital between 1867 
and 1894. In the latter, he expounded the idea that human societies progress through 
class struggle and that capitalism created internal tensions, which would lead to its own 
destruction. Nineteenth-century financial panics were seen as symptoms of this impending 
doom.

Crises have many parents but the breakdown of the Bretton Woods  
system20 of pegged exchange rates in August of 1971 may have contributed 
to the currency crises that spilled over into the banking crises that followed.  
In the decades of crisis after the breakdown of Bretton Woods, a critical 
aspect was the general worldwide liberalization of bank, capital, and exchange  
controls—including the formal repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act by the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act of 1999.21 Banking crises were sporadic in the 1970s but 
became more frequent in the 1980s and even more so, with greater interna-
tional spillovers, in the following decade.
The 1990s was a particularly wretched decade for international financial 
­stability and this may have contributed to a policy response that brought 
greater exchange-rate stability in the first decade of the new millennium. In 
1992–93, the European monetary system was in crisis, presaged by the aban-
donment of exchange-rate pegs in Scandinavia the year before. Britain and 
Italy were kicked out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism and +/–15 percent 
exchange rate bands replaced +/–2.25 percent bands. Then, there was the 
Mexican-led “Tequila crisis” of 1994/95. The years 1995–96 saw currency tur-
moil on the periphery of Europe.
The Asian Financial Crisis, which began in July 1997, unfurled into the Russia 
debt crisis of August 1998, via the Korean currency crisis. The Russian crisis 
helped to blow up Long Term Capital Management, a highly leveraged hedge 
fund, later in 1998, and the litany of crises ended with the Brazilian devaluation 
of January 1999. The first decade of the 21st century began with the dot-com 
debacle of 1999–2002. A prolonged period of growth and low volatility pre-
saged “the great credit crunch,” which started in 2008.
Looking back at the history of the 20th century, it is tempting to argue that 
we do not need to overanalyze financial regulation. We must merely return to 
the Bretton Woods system and Glass-Steagall era of few banking crises and 
strong economic growth. This reasoning is persuasive but has a few caveats. 
For one, Bretton Woods would need to be substantially modernized, as it was 
designed for a different world with substantially less financial mobility. It is also 
20The defining feature of the postwar Bretton Woods system was an obligation for each 
country to adopt a monetary policy that maintained its exchange rate parity to the US 
dollar. The International Monetary Fund was established to help bridge temporary balance 
of payments shortfalls, and there was provision for an adjustment of parities if an imbalance 
of international payments were to be persistent.
21The formal name is the Financial Services Modernisation Act. However, even before this 
act the demise of the Glass-Steagall Act had effectively occurred through increased liberal 
interpretations.

vital to recognize that the golden years of 1949–70 may have been flattered by 
the postwar reconstruction of Western Europe, when the United States lent 
substantially to Europe for the purchase of its capital goods.22
Another caveat is that the disruptive growth of emerging economies over the 
past two decades, which has led to a far-greater spread of economic power 
between countries and a more dramatic decline in poverty than occurred 
between 1949 and 1970, may not have occurred under the stability afforded 
by the Bretton Woods system. Stability is prized at times of crisis but it favors 
economic incumbents. Allowing all a fair opportunity may demand some dis-
ruption and turmoil at times.
Post–Bretton Woods
Let us focus further on the financial crises that have taken place since the 
collapse of Bretton Woods. Depending on the measure and definition of a 
banking crisis, there have been over 50 major crises post–Bretton Woods.23 
This number is enough for the empiricists to ask how costly and widespread 
financial crises are. Across countries and crises, the average cost of these 
banking disasters, in terms of lost output, is around 20 percent of GDP.24 The 
cost of crisis resolution has also been substantial, amounting to an average of 
30 percent of GDP.25 Estimates of the cost of the 2007–09 crisis are a work 
in progress, but they run to several trillions of dollars and over 25 percent 
of GDP. Moreover, GDP measures do not capture the full range of effects, 
including rising inequality and poverty levels. Those living on the edge fall over. 
Armed only with child nutrition data, it is possible to correctly identify the 
Indonesian Financial Crisis of 1997–98.26 
22President Harry Truman signed the Marshall Plan on April 3, 1948, granting $5 billion in 
aid to 16 European nations. During the four years that the plan was operational, the United 
States donated $13 billion in economic and technical assistance (especially for rebuilding 
transport networks) to help the recovery of European countries that had joined in the 
Organisation for European Economic Co-Operation, the forerunner to today’s OECD. 
In current dollars, that would be approximately $150 billion, which represents around  
5 percent of what was then the US GDP. And it worked. GDP in 1951, for Marshall Plan 
recipients, was at least 35 percent higher than in 1938.

Crisis avoidance also comes with costs. National regulatory bodies cost  
hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of staff members to run.27 
New regulations may lead to lost output and there may be many unintended  
distortions and costs. In any case, crises are not all bad and can have hard-to-
quantify benefits. Allowing Barings Bank to fail in 1995 after one of its head 
traders, Nick Leeson, lost $1.3 billion in futures contracts sent a strong signal 
to banks that internal controls must be tightened. This included dealing with 
the previously neglected relationship between trading and settlement. Barings, 
the oldest merchant bank in London, had by 1995 become relatively small and 
not very connected. Its failure was not systemic and was an opportunity for 
banks to learn the positive lesson that internal changes in bank behavior could 
prevent another Leeson-like disaster. The logic behind the popular idea of not 
allowing banks to get too big to fail is something I discuss more critically in 
Chapter 4.
A “good” crisis is one where those doing the “right stuff” survive, sharpening 
incentives for banks to do what is right and for customers and investors to 
look more closely at the actions banks are taking. A bad crisis is one where 
a bank that has invested heavily and wisely in safety is knocked over by the 
panic triggered by another bank that had earlier taken a more reckless atti-
tude to safety. The bad may bring down the good. And when all are brought 
down, it is hard to distinguish the bad from the good. What then is the point in 
being good? This question deters banks from investing in safety the next time 
around, making crises more likely. Based on this outcome, trying to reduce the 
likelihood and extent of a systemic banking crisis is worth the effort and cost. 
This is not just a financial equation. It is also worth the effort to avoid systemic 
crises if their wider economic and social costs are high and it would be hard 
to insulate companies and individuals from them. 
Banking Regulation Today
Banking regulation has evolved, a little disjointedly, and today rests on a few 
main pillars and institutions. A crucial one is the role of the central bank in 
providing emergency liquidity to halt the failure of a bank due to a tempo-
rary loss of liquidity rather than the poor quality of its loan book.28 This loss 
of liquidity might have stemmed from the failure of another, unrelated bank 
sparking panic and a withdrawal of deposits across the banking system. 
27The combined costs of the UK’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and Financial 
Conduct Authority reached £664 million (circa $1 billion) in 2013.
28Think of this type of liquidity as cash flow. A bank may have assets that exceed its debts 
and so is solvent, but it may not be able to sell those assets overnight to meet an interest 
payment or a cash withdrawal and so is illiquid. Of course, in the dynamic of a crisis these 
neat conceptual distinctions become blurry.

Chapter 2 | Why Do We Regulate Finance?
20
The earliest incarnations of today’s central banks were established to help 
fund war debts, in part through the issuance of national currency required for 
the payment of taxes. The Bank of England, the Bank of Amsterdam, and the 
Sveriges Riksbank began life that way in the 17th century although they soon 
developed lender-of-last-resort facilities.
More recently, established central banks were developed specifically for the 
purpose of the lender of last resort. The US Federal Reserve owes its birth 
in 1913 to the Panic of 1907, when the financial system had to be bailed out 
by J. Pierpont Morgan, raising concerns that the sustainability of the financial 
system was improperly dependent on a few private actors. In carrying out 
lender-of-last-resort activities, modern central bankers cite Walter Bagehot’s 
dictum that central banks should lend freely but only to solid firms and only 
against good collateral and at interest rates that are high enough to dissuade 
borrowers without a genuine need.29 This is eminently sensible. However, in 
the present day, where it is near impossible and considered deceitful to keep it 
secret that a bank has taken advantage of an emergency facility at the central 
bank, this knowledge is itself enough to create or deepen panic. 
It is suggested that one of the contributing factors to the LIBOR scandal30 
during the last credit crunch is that banks were allegedly, with the tacit under-
standing of the Bank of England, unwilling to reveal the true costs of their bor-
rowing lest signs of a relatively high cost would trigger a run on the bank. An 
ingenious way of cracking this “borrower’s curse” was used in 2008 when US 
Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson awarded the ten largest US banks $25 bil-
lion each—regardless of request or necessity. This eliminated the ostracism of 
those banks that actually were in difficulty. Those that were not simply repaid 
the loans when the time came to do so.
The second pillar of banking regulation is the use of deposit insurance. This 
insurance, given to individuals up to a certain limit, is backed by government 
guarantee—often through premiums paid by banks. This can contain panic 
from spreading among depositors concerned that their bank may be vulner-
able to failure if another bank fails. “Bank runs” were frequent in the 19th and 
early 20th century, culminating in the many bank failures after the Great Crash 
of 1929. This experience, along with examples of mutual financial insurance in 
Hong Kong and elsewhere, led to a raft of deposit insurance schemes being 
established in the 1930s.31 During the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), there

21
were signs of a return to bank runs. Perhaps because we had gone for a long 
period when insurance limits were not lifted, a significant number of savers felt 
insufficiently covered. The limits were promptly raised.32 
The next pillar of banking regulation surrounds issues of consumer protection 
as discussed earlier. These issues are different in character from those relat-
ing to monetary policy, emergency liquidity, and insurance to avoid runs. They 
have more to do with the legal minimum rights of consumers and investors 
concerning their treatment and disclosures made to them by financial firms. 
Many of these rights evolved out of old self-regulation exercises but when 
these proved inadequate, they were codified in laws and enforced by regula-
tory institutions. These institutions can sit within central banks, or, because 
of the more-legal-than-economic discipline of their employees or an area of 
activity, they are sometimes stand-alone agencies of government.
Modern banking supervision rests on the requirement that banks hold a 
­minimum amount of capital. This, alongside scrutiny of operational and risk 
control, is designed to make individual banks safe and less of a risk both to 
their customers and investors and to the financial system as a whole. Minimum 
capital adequacy of banks is often seen as the quid pro quo for the govern-
ment-backed guarantee and liquidity provision just mentioned. The design of 
the capital requirement seeks to be sensitive to the credit risks being taken—
referred to as risk-sensitive capital adequacy. According to the approach, a 
bank that solely lends to the US government is taking less credit risks than 
one that only lends to small businesses in emerging markets. 
The present starting point of capital adequacy requirements is the notion 
of risk-weighted assets. The required amount of capital is a percentage of 
a bank’s risk-weighted assets, where some assets have low-risk weights, like 
government bonds, while others carry high-risk weights—such as loans to 
weakly capitalized corporations. The purpose of the Basel 1 Capital Accord, 
concluded in 1988,33 was to establish minimal capital requirements and inter-
national norms for risk weights to be used by internationally active banks to 
ensure that a rogue bank did not become a risk to the international financial 
32In the United States, where there is one of the longest histories of deposit insurance, the 
original limit in 1934 was $2,500. This was doubled in 1935 and held at that number until 
being doubled again in 1950 to $10,000. By 1980 it had been increased in four increments 
to $100,000, where it stood for an unprecedented gap of 28 years before being raised to 
$250,000 on October 3, 2008 in the aftermath of the Lehman collapse and signs of mini-
bank runs developing.
33In 1988 the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) of G-10 central banks 
and regulators published a set of minimum capital requirements (Basel I) for international 
banks in their member countries.

22
system. Unintentionally, this accord and its later installments—Basel II and 
Revised Basel II—became the benchmark for the global regulation of all banks. 
There are many challenges with this risk-sensitive approach that we will touch 
on in the following section and return to in greater detail over the next few 
chapters.
An Overreliance on Bank Capital
The reliance on capital as the insurance against risk, and therefore the pref-
erence for institutions that appear well capitalized, is one of the histori-
cal reasons why regulators were uncomfortable with banking competition. 
Regulators did not want to face a phalanx of small, barely profitable, thinly 
capitalized banks so they were largely exempted from the competition and 
trade laws applicable to other firms. If they felt they would not be endangered, 
regulators often favored better-capitalized banks swallowing their less-well-
capitalized neighbors. Competition concerns were waived aside in the name 
of financial stability. The 2008 takeover of HBOS by Lloyds Bank in the United 
Kingdom, and of Bear Sterns by J. P. Morgan in America, fit this long-tested 
bias. Over time, this preference for institutions with the most capital led to 
banking systems being dominated by a small number of profitable institutions 
that were deemed too big to fail.
The logic of the capital adequacy response to systemic risks is that if all insti-
tutions were well capitalized, there would be less chance of a bank failing. And 
if a bank failed, the capitalization of others, as well as the deposit insurance 
and the central bank’s emergency-liquidity provision, would stop bank runs. 
The core belief was that if microprudential regulation ensured that individual 
banks had strong internal credit controls and adequate capital, the system 
would be safe. There would be no need to agonize over a bank’s liquidity.  
A well-capitalized bank could always get access to liquidity. Were there ever 
to be a general panic that starved well-capitalized banks of liquidity, the only 
appropriate response would, in any event, be central bank action. Contrary 
to popular opinion, there is often a strong logic behind what regulators think 
they are doing.
The underlying model of what a banking crisis looks like, which underpinned 
this focus on bank capital, conceived a crisis as being caused by a rogue bank 
failing. This rogue bank would have perhaps held less capital than others or 
would have had worse credit controls. Given the systemic nature of banking, 
this failure would then spread to other well-managed banks. Yet this is not 
what we observe in practice. If it were so, then because this kind of rogue 
behavior is uncoordinated across banks, financial crises would be fairly ran-
dom events that even in hindsight would be hard to predict. While such bank 

Reinventing Financial Regulation
23
failures do exist, such as the Johnson Matthey Bank, which failed in 1984, 
Continental Illinois Bank (1984), British & Commonwealth Merchant Bank 
(1990), BCCI (1991), and Barings (1995), they are often well contained by the 
authorities and do not generally spread. Managing a rogue bank is not the criti-
cal problem that bank regulation needs to solve. 
Widespread financial busts, on the other hand, with their enormous eco-
nomic, fiscal, and social costs, is the problem we do need to worry about. 
But these are not random. The busts almost always follow financial booms. 
In the next chapter, we will examine the evidence for this assertion. Here we 
should merely observe that in previous financial regulation there was a fallacy 
of composition, namely that ensuring individual banks are safe does not make 
the system safe. In the middle of the boom, as asset valuations rise and risk 
measures fall, the banking system and all its major banks appear to be well 
capitalized and better capitalized than in the past. In the middle of the bust, as 
valuations collapse and measured risks soar, the banking system and all of its 
major banks appear to be too thinly capitalized, dependent on overstretched 
valuations and unduly concentrated in their lending. It is the system that goes 
rogue. Risk and capital are endogenous to the economic cycle. The problem 
is not risky loans not performing but so-called safe loans becoming risky at 
the same time. To combat crises and the financial cycle, microprudential regu-
lation of individual banks is not enough. The next few chapters explore this 
problem and its solution.

What Causes 
Financial Crashes
And the Implications for Financial Regulation
Financial crashes ought to be occasions of great learning and introspection. 
Crashes occur as a result of being largely unanticipated. Those who had 
warned of an unsustainable boom had long before been ridiculed or beaten 
into submission.1 However, crises appear to be such multifaceted and com-
plex affairs that all and sundry can point to an aspect of the crisis they had 
predicted. Positions can become entrenched rather than open to reassess-
ment. Authority figures who had dismissed the warning signs characterize  
the root causes as unknowable and suggest the crisis merits fundamental 
changes to our understanding of economics, institutional arrangements, and 
legal regimes. When banks are bailed out to the tune of trillions and social 
security nets are cut back in response, the regulatory debate, traditionally car-
ried out in dimly lit corridors, is suddenly bathed in the bright light of political 
intrigue. Politics sends the debate down a parochial and partisan chute that 
produces recycled proposals often harbored for decades by one side or the 
other. The aftermath of financial crises creates a situation of numerous solu-
tions in search of a problem.

1In 1996, my friend Tony Dye, Chief Investment Officer of Phillips & Drew, warned that 
there was a “dot-com bubble” and began pulling client funds out of stocks. But the market 
continued to soar and after repeated underperformance, clients began to leave, in droves, 
pulling down the assets the firm managed from £60 billion to £35 billion. In March 2000, 
Tony, by then nicknamed Dr. Doom, was asked to take early retirement. Before the new 
manager could change the fund’s allocation, the dot-com bubble burst and the fund shot to 
the top of performance rankings. Tony was vindicated but the process had been grueling. 
He died in 2008 at the age of just 60.

Solutions in Search of a Problem
Lasting solutions require a clear understanding of the underlying issues we are 
trying to resolve. To assess the validity of either the risk-sensitive capital ade-
quacy approach at the heart of the Basel II Accord on Banking Supervision, or 
the introduction of new leverage and liquidity ratios in the postcrash “Revised 
Basel II,” we need to consider how these approaches could have avoided the 
problems at hand.
The authorities are relatively good at containing idiosyncratic bank failures. 
Between 2008 and 2012, the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 
(FDIC) closed 465 failed banks without fuss and similar bodies elsewhere have 
notched up reasonable successes in this regard. That’s not the problem over 
which we are still searching for a solution. Day-to-day protection of consumers, 
outside of widespread bank failures, is a large area in which regulation could 
do better. We address consumer protection in greater detail in Chapter 7.  
While the line between providing too much protection and too little cus-
tomer choice will be continuously redrawn as society evolves, we do at least 
have the tools or means to effect better balance. Managing systemic risk in 
the financial sector to avoid or moderate the cycle of boom-bust is the major 
problem that continues to elude a solution.
This chapter focuses on understanding the causes of financial busts and  
considers financial regulation from the perspective of how it addresses them. 
A vital challenge of this task is to penetrate the political obfuscation. The 
politics of financial crises run deeper than party politics. Financial crises and 
their preceding booms lead to shifts in power between slices of society such 
as creditors versus debtors, financiers versus producers, home owners versus 
tenants, as well as the private sector versus public sectors. Power is nothing 
but political.
Is reducing systemic risk too broad or ambitious a goal? Isn’t trying to identify 
the causes of financial crises opening a hornet’s nest that regulators should 
best leave alone? Perhaps. But the cost of failure to limit crises is so great that 
we need to try, and, as will be argued in this book, we can do better than we 
have done recently. We also have a wealth of history and experience of bank-
ing crises to draw on. While crises may differ in instruments and institutions, 
the broad, underlying currents are similar.2 It should also be remembered that 
banks have not always been regarded as systemically fragile as they appear to

be today.3 When my father began investing in the stock market, banks were 
considered boring, defensive stocks that faithfully delivered an attractive divi-
dend, but not much else.4
The Politicization of Financial Crashes
The economic, financial, and social costs of financial crises are enormous, and 
often the initial response is to boot the politicians out of office. Between early 
2007 and the reelection in the US of President Barack Obama in November 
2012, almost every country deeply affected by the Global Financial Crisis 
(GFC) failed to reelect the incumbent government. Public anger at the bailout 
of banks, followed by severe public expenditure cuts and revenue-raising mea-
sures to finance the rescues, brought down governments in Britain, Denmark, 
France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Spain, and Greece. Arguably, President Obama’s 
first election in November 2008 benefitted from the backlash against the 
Republican Party unleashed by a crisis that erupted during the Republican 
presidency of George W. Bush.5
The contagion of financial crisis to political crisis is not new. The Asian 
Financial Crisis of 1997 to 1999 lit many political fires. Estimates suggest that 
over a thousand people died in a series of ugly riots in Indonesia during May 
1998, and the crisis eventually forced the resignation of President Suharto. 
Bankers had achieved in less than two years what human rights campaign-
ers had been trying to do for thirty-one. The 1994/95 Mexico Peso Crisis 
laid the ground for the first electoral defeat of the PRI party in 70 years. In 
the UK, Sterling’s ejection from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism on 
September 15, 1992, ended the Conservative Party’s long-established reputa-
tion for economic stewardship, condemning them to the opposition benches 
for over a decade. The Spanish peseta’s devaluation during the EMS crisis had 
a similarly devastating effect on Prime Minister Gonzalez’s PSOE party.
3See Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff, This Time Is Different: Eight Centuries of 
Financial Folly (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2009).
4This past boring banking period is sometimes attractively referred to in the United 
Kingdom as “Mainwaring banking” after Captain George Mainwaring in the popular British 
1970s TV sitcom Dad’s Army. Captain Mainwaring was the pompous, blustering buffoon, a 
stickler for rules and order, who led the home guard of misfits rejected for serving in the 
war’s main front in the fictional seaside town of Walmington-on-Sea during World War II. 
He derived his sense of self-importance from being the town’s stingy bank manager.
5US Republicans may complain that the seeds of the crisis were sown in the deregulation 
of the US banking system under the previous Democrat Treasury team of Rob Rubin and 
Larry Summers. Democrats could retort that it was fuelled by the fiscally unsustainable 
combination of “Bush tax cuts” and the Iraq and Afghan wars. Because the financial cycle 
is longer than the political one, crises throw up many legitimate questions over their 
parenthood.

Financial crises can be the death knell for any incumbent government what-
ever its complexion. From a safe distance, the spread of crisis from finance 
to politics could appear to have some benefits. Brutish regimes that seemed 
intractable being removed, and the arrival of fresh leaders able to disown past 
blunders, facilitates an early return of international capital.6 
The Bad Apple Theory of Financial Crises
The scenario just described is hardly reassuring if you are the political incum-
bent when a financial crisis erupts. Any rescue of politicians’ political fortunes 
must involve them being seen as acting promptly and resolutely. This neces-
sitates projection of a theory of how it all fell apart without too much scrutiny 
of their role in the buildup to the crisis. Consequently, many governments 
adopt what I term the “bad apple theory” of banking crises.7 The bad apple 
theory presents the crisis as one caused by bad bankers, knowingly selling bad 
products out of bad foreign jurisdictions to innocent voters. It is a narrative 
of bankers pulling out smoking weapons of financial mass destruction8 from 
their jacket pockets, hurling them into a crowd of bewildered consumers, and 
then sprinting away.
The bad apple theory allows governments to move decisively to prosecute 
the bankers, ban the financial products, and get tough with foreign jurisdic-
tions.9 It allows them to personalize blame with the added bonus of being able 
to distance themselves from it. Above all, it allows governments to be seen 
as swiftly swinging into action. The press also loves the bad apple theory sto-
ries. Unashamed at providing little scrutiny of bankers earlier, and lapping up 
the advertising revenues that banks provided them, the press salivates at the 
prospect of a good chase and demolition of real-life “villains.” Even Hollywood 
finds the bad apple theory compelling as a wonderful morality play.10
6Financiers threaten hell and damnation at the merest hint of a loan default, so the 
speed with which international capital returns following default is one of the mysteries 
of financial history. Several countries appear to have routinely devalued and defaulted. 
Argentina, Venezuela, Mexico, Turkey, Greece, Spain, and others have each defaulted over 
six times in less than six generations.

December 10, 2010.
8Warren Buffet famously referred to derivatives as financial weapons of mass destruction 
in his annual letter to shareholders in 2002. At the time, the world was engrossed in what 
turned out to be a charade around Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction.

10The Global Financial Crisis has spawned a handful of movies including Inside Job (2010), 
narrated by Matt Damon; Margin Call (2011), starring Kevin Spacey, Jeremy Irons, Zachary 
Quinto, and Paul Bettany; and Too Big to Fail (2011), based on Ross Sorkin’s book.

In chasing their villains, the popular press often plunges deep into the well of 
xenophobia. Listening to a few elder statesmen in Europe during the European 
sovereign credit crisis of 2011-2013, their biggest disappointment was not the 
partly foreseen limitations of the original single-currency framework but rather 
how quickly member-state unity slid into grubby national finger-­pointing.11 
Many Greeks blamed their predicament on German bankers and publicly 
appealed to the specter of the German occupation 60 years earlier. French 
and German bankers in turn blamed “lazy Greeks” and scheming American 
and British hedge fund managers with their toxic derivatives. European gov-
ernments blamed US credit rating agencies. UK Parliamentary watchdogs and 
US congressional committees demanded appearances of everyone for their 
15 minutes of public shaming.
No one was interested in a narrative of the failure of the system of regulation. 
If it was the whole system of regulation that had collapsed, then who would 
the finger of blame be specifically pointed at? Who had responsibility for the 
regulatory system at the time? Less tangible villains make for less attractive 
press copy and the bad apple theory was secured.
Proponents of the bad apple theory also believe that the bankers were able 
to peddle bad products out of bad jurisdictions because banking regulation 
was not comprehensive enough across institutions, instruments, and jurisdic-
tions. Cries of “global banks need global regulation” were oft repeated. There 
is some truth to this, but I hesitate to conclude that what was needed was to 
make the existing bad regulation more comprehensive than it was.
Fundamentally, any argument about too little or too much regulation misses 
the mark. We should be pinpointing good vs. bad regulation, as in poorly 
focused or wrongly conceived regulation. It is not that risky assets proved 
risky and the regulation did not capture them all, but that the safe ones, for 
which the system required little capital to be put aside, turned bad at the same 
time. If what we had was bad regulation, then doubling up on it was never 
going to make things better and could actually make them worse.12 In fairness, 
many regulators recognize this even if politicians prefer simpler explanations 
of there being too little good and too much evil.
Incentives are critical. Precious little happened during the Global Financial 
Crisis that was not explicitly incentivized to happen either by the market-
place, regulation, or both. To effect behavioral changes the incentives have to 
be changed. “Originating” loans and then packaging them to redistribute as 
fast as possible, as opposed to holding onto them, was the proclaimed new 
11I have heard this lament from two distinguished Europeans, economist, ECB Vice President 
and former Italian Finance Minister Tomaso Padoa-Schioppa (1940–2010) and economist, 
former European Commissioner and Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti.

­business model of banks in the first decade of the 21st century. Was this 
because ­bankers were knaves and knew the loans they originated would blow 
up, or was it because holding loans required expensive regulatory capital? 
Meanwhile, originating and then redistributing loans allowed for significant 
up-front fees and much less capital, which boosted shareholder returns. The 
banking model was not in conflict with the regulatory model—it was a reflec-
tion of it.
There were and always are bad apples that should be pursued and prosecuted. 
Regulation must be tightened to close regulatory evasion. But we should have 
modest expectations of the impact this will have on reducing the incidences 
of banking crises. In Chapter 11, we discuss in more detail the relative merits 
of using criminal or civil law in pursuing the bad apples. But the bad apples did 
not so much cause a crisis as have their rogue behavior revealed by it. Warren 
Buffet put it most succinctly when he suggested, “(a)fter all, you only find out 
who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.”13 Even if all the bad apples 
were removed, the banking crisis would still have occurred. In truth, we were 
let down by a system of banking regulation that not only failed to prevent the 
crisis but actually amplified it.
What Causes Banking Crises?
Banking crashes are not random events. They almost always immediately fol-
low the peak of financial booms. There is a financial cycle of boom and bust. 
Despite the spread of financial innovation and shadow banks, financial booms 
almost always take place in the form of a boom of credit growth and property 
prices. Famous booms that presaged notorious crashes include those during 
the Roaring ’20s in the United States and Europe, the Barber Boom of 1972–74  
in Britain, the Tesobonos Boom of 1992–94 in Mexico, the Asian-Tigers Boom 
of 1995–97 in South East Asia, the dot-com bubble of 1998–2000 centered in 
the United States, and the Great Moderation, also in the United States from 
2004 to 2006. The general rule is simple—the bigger the boom, the more 
colossal the crash.
Although financial cycles are influenced by the economic and policy cycles, the 
length of financial cycles is longer, which makes both statistical measurement 
and apportioning blame challenging.14 Financial booms are often a long sweep 
of moderately accelerated credit growth over six to seven years, reaching a 
sharp peak right at the end. However, despite the methodological and quanti-
tative challenges, booming credit growth and property prices are not difficult

to locate. Crashes, meanwhile, tend to have elements of both sharpness, espe-
cially in the early collapse of investment, and elements of lingering drag as the 
banking system remains fragile for a while.15
The cause and effect of boom-bust can be seen a little more clearly if we look 
at it in a tighter time frame than normal through a perverse set of banking 
and currency crises centered around the 1988 Basel 1 Accord on Banking 
Supervision, which contributed to its subsequent revision (Basel II). Under 
Basel 1, lending to an OECD government was considered not risky while lend-
ing to a non-OECD government was seen as being more so. This was always 
a slightly odd distinction, as the OECD was originally established in 1948 to 
run the US-financed Marshall Plan for a Europe ravaged by war and while 
its membership expanded in later years, it kept its predominantly Western 
European—plus American and Japanese—focus.
Membership in the OECD was never based on credit worthiness. This 
Western European, US, and Japanese bias was replicated in the composition 
of the Basel Committee. (Some argue that the failings of Basel I and II are an 
example of the financial consequences of membership bias.) The problem 
arose when an emerging-market economy joined the OECD, automatically 
switching its Basle rating from risky to not risky. Doing so allowed interna-
tional banks to lend to borrowers in the country with much less capital than 
before. A surge in foreign currency lending almost always followed, more than 
the country could safely absorb and so lending would promptly succumb a 
year or two later into a banking and currency crisis. Mexico and Hungary 
joined the OECD in 1994. Their banks crashed in 1995. In Mexico, the crisis 
spread via the devaluation of the peso to neighbors, creating the so-called 
Tequila crisis. The Czech Republic joined the OECD in 1995 and suffered a 
banking and currency crisis in 1996. South Korea joined in 1996. By 1997 its 
banks and currency had crashed, fueling the Asian Financial Crisis.
While the identification of booms and busts is not simple, there is a wealth of 
statistical evidence for the financial cycle.16 The message is clear. If we want 
to tackle the problem of banking crashes, we have to attend to the problem 
of banking booms.

Addressing the Boom
It might seem that we should focus on eliminating the boom-bust credit cycle. 
But it is unlikely that this could be done. Moreover, even if it were possible, it 
is debatable whether it would be the right thing to do. We have written much 
about the misery of busts but the pride that precedes the fall is not without 
usefulness. Booms trigger the imagination, creating ambitious schemes that 
would never have otherwise materialized, or not have happened in a timely 
manner. Many of these schemes had lasting worth. Vast networks of canals, 
railways, electrification, fiber-optic cabling, and even the Internet were lugged 
on the back of financial booms.17 Our goal is not to eliminate the boom-bust 
cycle but to moderate it—to nurture sustainable economic progress that is 
not shaken to death by soaring booms and plunging busts or strangled to 
death by overly burdensome regulation.
By reducing uncertainty, the lessened financial and economic volatility that 
would result could augment underlying growth. We need to cushion the deso-
lation of crashes—often hardest on those who have least benefited from the 
boom. To moderate the amplitude of the boom-bust cycle requires either 
boom limitation measures, bust absorptive buffers, or both.
The distinction between the ending of boom-bust and the moderation of 
boom-bust is critical. The argument used by Chairman Greenspan and others 
against the Federal Reserve acting to moderate the boom in financial assets 
is that booms and busts are hard to define. If the object were the surgical 
removal of booms and busts, I would agree that we lack measurements that 
are calibrated in sufficient-enough detail and the instruments with which to 
do so. However, if the aim is to lean against the wind, to moderate persistently 
above-normal growth in credit, and to dampen otherwise-calamitous conse-
quences, then we do have sufficient ability to measure when to do so.18 This 
is the essence of a countercyclical credit policy, which is one of the proposals 
we explore in Chapter 5.
17Carlota Perez has done some fascinating research suggesting that each technological 
revolution in the past has given rise to a paradigm shift and a “new economy.” She shows 
how these “opportunity explosions,” which are focused on specific industries, also lead to 
the recurrence of financial bubbles and crises. See Carlota Perez, Technological Revolutions 
and Financial Capital: The Dynamics of Bubbles and Golden Ages (Cheltenham, UK: Edward 
Elgar, 2003).

Fools or Knaves?
What causes booms? In the last crisis, bankers pulled out of their jacket 
­pockets smoking weapons of mass destruction that they threw into a crowd 
of bewildered consumers, and then they ran toward them, stuffing as many of 
these products as they could into their back pockets. Banks got themselves 
into trouble by originating and repackaging credit instruments and then not 
distributing them far enough. They established “special-purpose vehicles” so 
that they could hold on to them and create the financial leverage to increase 
their exposure. Bear Stearns, one of the first investment banks to come 
unstuck in the GFC, was very active in this sector as were Lehman Brothers 
and many others.
A host of people lost considerably in Lehman Brothers’ failure. However, few 
individuals suffered more personal losses than its 25,000 managers and staff. 
Why would Lehman managers press so close to these instruments if they 
knew they were going to blow up? Some have calculated that if you were to 
total up the previous decade of bonuses, the bankers were still ahead even 
after their firms closed and their stock awards had became worthless. But 
bygones are bygones. Past cash bonuses were banked and maybe even spent. 
Dick Fuld, Lehman’s CEO, personally lost $900 million as a result of the col-
lapse of Lehman.19 From my own banking experience, I would suggest it unlikely 
that investment bankers thought it okay to lose fortunes of this magnitude on 
the grounds that they had made enough money before. Perspective, or even 
loyalty to firm or their products, has not been a defining feature of modern 
investment bankers. If the bankers expected these products to explode they 
would have bailed, implemented strategies that better insulated them, or at 
least a strategy that did not involve clinging onto these products so tightly 
with their own bonus pools. They were fools and they fooled themselves.
Generally, a few people doing things that they know are risky does not cause 
financial booms. Booms originate with many people believing their actions 
are safe—so safe that, as returns start shrinking because everyone is doing 
the same thing, they feel justified in “doubling up” their bets. Using derivatives 
or employing more borrowing are the ways greater leverage is intention-
ally achieved, justified on the grounds that a safer world requires bankers 
to employ more leverage if they are to generate the same returns as in to

New York Times, September 11, 2008.

generate the same return as in the riskier past.20 In the wonderful world of 
hindsight, we know that the belief that it is safe to “double up” is wishful think-
ing spurred by a contagion of greed. But this thinking is also often supported 
by the arrival of some new technological advance like railways, motor cars, or 
electricity that does objectively transform economic activity.
An essential point is that booms are characterized by mass euphoria that 
seeps through and is reinforced by aspects of life beyond financial markets. 
Booms are ages of technological advance and a belief that the white heat of 
technology will melt away our problems.21 TV pundits and popular historians 
paint a picture of linear progress and perpetual betterment.22 Movies reflect 
the optimism of the day, like Charlie Chaplin’s 1925 film The Gold Rush or 
the top-grossing movie of 2004, Shrek 2. Even economists appear less dis-
mal as they discuss the increasing employment and growth opportunities of 
some new technology, while Nobel laureates expound the benefits of financial 
innovation. Governments claim to have solved major economic challenges. 
Financial booms are not a circumscribed conspiracy.
Booms quickly blast off from their fundamental foundations and begin feeding 
upon themselves. Higher asset valuations lead to higher returns and stronger 
asset values, justifying higher borrowing and more spending, which creates 
even higher asset values justifying more borrowing. The wheels on the boom 
bus keep turning with valuations being propped up by less and less actual cash 
earnings.23 The housing market is particularly prone to boom-bust cycles. In 
housing booms, lenders feel that their lending is safely collateralized against an 
20Traditional finance theory suggests that investors’ return expectations relate to their 
perceptions and appetites for risk. The more risk, the more returns. Moreover, it has often 
been thought that different investors have different appetites for risk but that these did 
not change; what changed were their returns and expectations of returns. However, there 
is some evidence that investors have return expectations based on what was achieved 
in the past and that they regulate the amount of risk required to achieve those returns. 
When the world is a safer place and returns fall, they have to take on more risk (by 
increasing their risk appetite) to push returns back up. See Manmohan Kumar and Avinash 
D. Persaud, “Pure Contagion and Investors’ Shifting Risk Appetite: Analytical Issues and 
Empirical Evidence,” International Finance 5, no. 3 (November 2002), pp. 401–436.
21Harold Wilson, then leader of the British Labour Party, famously coined this phrase 
when he said, “A new Britain would need to be forged in the white heat of [this] scientific 
revolution.” (Speech to annual party conference, Scarborough, in September 1963.)
22In What Is History? (New York: Vintage, 1967), Edward Hallett Carr speculates that our 
view of where we are in history relates to whether we are in a boom or bust. In a boom, 
we tend to view progress as linear: things are good now, they were less good before, and 
they will get even better tomorrow. In a bust, we adopt a cyclical view of where we are: 
things are bad now, they were good before, and one day they will be good again.

apparently liquid security with rising valuations—so safely collateralized that 
they do not need to bother greatly with the income details of the name on the 
mortgage application form. The argument was that should a mortgage holder 
be unable to keep up with future repayments, their house could always be 
sold for a sum greater than the original loan. This optimistic thinking, powered 
more by greed than wonton neglect, lay behind the 2007/8 subprime mort-
gage debacle in the United States.
This scenario highlights a fundamental problem with bank risk management 
models. These models assume that when a bank wants to sell some security, 
they will be the only ones doing so which is a reasonable assumption during 
booms. But when the wheels of a boom stop spinning, many banks will be 
forced into the sale of similar assets at the same time as everyone else. This will 
depress valuations sharply, turning previously liquid assets into illiquid assets, 
only disposable at a deep discount of their previous or long-term valuation.24
Today this is routinely characterized as a “black swan” event after Nassim 
Taleb’s 2007 book of the same name. It suggests a situation where the dis-
tribution of outcomes—an example would be the number of bank failures/
rescues in the United States—is “fat tailed” and extreme outcomes are more 
likely than a “normal” distribution would imply. Bankers and regulators now 
routinely run black swan stress tests on their lending portfolios. However, this 
characterization critically misses the endogeneity and dynamic of the pro-
cess,25 where the bust is not an extreme random event but a corollary of 
the previous boom. The reality is probably better described as two separate 
distributions of outcomes. Imagine a histogram with bars showing the number 
of quarters in which there were no bank failures, one failure, two failures, 
three and so on. Of the two distributions we are talking about, the first is a 
normal distribution, with the highest bar representing the number of quarters 
where there have been, say, just a couple failures; the lower bars representing 
the number of quarters where there have been only one or three failures; 
and the lowest bar of all representing zero and more than four failures. This 
is a true reflection 75 percent of the time. However, during late boom and 
bust, this pattern dissolves into an entirely different distribution of outcomes 
closer to a U shape (a type of beta distribution) where there is a much longer 
period of no bank failures than normal (none occurred between June 2004 
and February 2007) followed by an extremely high number (152 failures were 
recorded in 2010 alone).

25This endogeneity is something that Nassim Taleb, an insightful thinker, understands and 
writes about but that is not always understood by those using his terminology.

The Failure of Risk-Based Capital to Safeguard 
the System
In the previous chapter we argued that outside of consumer protection, the 
primary reason we regulate banks is not to stop “one-off” bank failures. Since 
they have limited collateral damage, these one-off failures can be good lessons 
that everyone can learn from—as in the case of the 1995 collapse of Barings 
Bank. The main reason we regulate banks, or why we should be doing so, is 
to reduce the frequency or amplitude of systemic crashes in which good and 
bad alike fail. That invariably means moderating the previous boom. Booms are 
driven by a broad underestimation of risk, a cycle that is itself self-reinforcing. 
This is why risk-based capital adequacy requirements on their own can make 
the financial system less safe rather than more so—as observed during the 
last financial crash and explained in the following paragraph.
Credit mistakes are made primarily during the booms. As a boom progresses 
and lending expands rapidly, it is desirable that the banking system act conser-
vatively, putting aside more capital as a cushion against an increasingly likely 
future crash. However, the boom is only happening because the perception 
and contemporaneous measurements of risk are low and falling. In a system 
where the amount of capital put aside is based on the current measurement 
of riskiness of the assets (the sum of risk-weighted assets), as the boom pro-
gresses, and measured risks fall, it appears that the banks have more capital as 
a percentage of their risk-based assets and are therefore able to lend more 
without more capital. As banks collectively expand their lending, prices of 
assets rise, giving the impression that risks have fallen further. The cycle inten-
sifies.26 Those banks in trouble post-2007, when the riskiness of their assets 
soared, were ones that appeared to have capital well in excess of regulatory 
minimums and historic levels prior to 2007. 
Structural Risk Limits Are Better
Measured risks are procyclical. A risk-based regulatory system discourages 
putting aside capital when it is plentiful for some future time when it will be 
scarce. During a crash, this system also discourages lending when, in hindsight, 
collateral valuations are often at their lowest point. To avoid this procyclicality,

we need a regulatory system that is less dependent on “statistical” measures 
of risk and more reliant on what I would call “structural” measures of risk, 
i.e. measures of risk detached from contemporaneous developments and per-
ceptions. Structural measures of risk would measure, for instance, the size of 
mismatches between assets and liabilities by maturity, or currency, say, rather 
than current correlations between asset prices or frequency of recent price 
declines. The new 3 percent leverage ratio (of equity and equity-like assets to 
total assets—including those off the balance sheet) proposed in revised Basel 
II is a structural risk limit. While it is may seem crude, it does limit the amount 
of leverage that could be built on the belief that assets are currently safer than 
they will turn out to be in a crash.
The other “structural” risk limit introduced in the revised Basel II is the net 
stable funding ratio, which requires banks to hold enough guaranteed funding 
to enable them to withstand the closing of the money markets for as long as 
12 months. Banks don’t like these structural limits and have mounted tough 
opposition to their early implementation. However, the leverage ratio and net 
stable funding ratio represent a subtle, important and fundamental departure 
from a risk-based system that has otherwise been more likely to amplify the 
boom-bust cycle than to moderate it. In Chapter 5, we discuss a more system-
atic way of building on these early initiatives.

Why Taxpayers 
Need to Be on 
the Hook
The Financial System Cannot Insure Itself
The period immediately after a major financial crisis, such as the Global 
Financial Crisis (GFC) that engulfed the industrialized economies between 
2007 and 2011, is one ripe for radical financial reform. Cries of “this time is 
different” heard during the boom are replaced with shouts of “never again” as 
the bust unfolds.1 Crises are the handmaidens of financial reform. For example, 
the requirement that a bank must publish an audited account of its assets and 
liabilities can be traced back to the collapse of Royal British Bank in 1856. The 
US Federal Reserve was created in 1913 as a direct response to the Panic of 
1907. The 1929 stock market crash gave birth to the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, 
which separated US commercial and investment banking for over 50 years. 
The 1974 establishment of the Basel Committee of G-10 Bank Supervisors 
followed the collapse of Germany’s Bankhaus Herstatt in June of that year and 
the ­subsequent liquidity crisis in New York. The list goes on.

1On January 20, 2010, President Obama introduced his proposals limiting the size and 
activities of the largest banks by saying, “Never again will the American taxpayer be held 
hostage by a bank that is too big to fail.”

The moment for radical reform is in the direct aftermath of a crisis. If this 
opportunity is not grasped, it soon gets submerged and bad reforms instead 
surge in. Oftentimes, regulators, caught up in extinguishing the fires of a finan-
cial crash, quickly recognize the point of origin. Despite having contributed 
to the crisis by designing the previous flawed bank regulations,2 the Basel 
Committee of Bank Supervisors delivered a blueprint for meaningful reform 
as early as April 2009 (referred to as the revised Basel II or, more commonly, 
Basel III), a mere seven months after the Lehman Brothers collapse. Revised 
Basel II is for the most part a reasonable construct that attempts to address 
Basel II’s failures and push it in the right direction. But, over time, as taxpayers’ 
money has been seen to be bailing out wealthy, undertaxed bankers, and the 
ensuing government deficits has led to the scrapping of social programs for 
the less fortunate, justifiable moral indignation has morphed into understand-
able anger. This anger caused that early consensus on what went wrong to 
be lost amid the salacious details of individual villainy and created a backlash 
against government bailouts. Taxpayers were no longer prepared to be cast as 
the lender or insurer of last resort. The roar came for greater retribution and 
alternatives that were less state and taxpayer reliant. This chapter explores 
the extent to which such alternatives might work in the light of the actual 
problems that need solving.
Locking Up Bankers May Be Satisfying
Locking up bankers is not the solution to financial crashes. Since April 2009, 
many of the critical changes to the Basel Accord, such as the requirement 
for more stable funding and more equity, have been diluted and delayed. This 
retreat from Basel coincides with the strengthening of proposals seemingly 
focused on the punishment and shackling of bankers.
As discussed in the previous chapter, politicians are often drawn to the “bad 
apple” theory that crises are caused by bad people doing bad things often out 
of bad foreign jurisdictions. Having absolved themselves of responsibility as 
poor regulators they then embark on crushing all the bad apples they can pick. 
Both the Left and Right queue up to express their fury at the bankers in the 
eye of the storm. Even other bankers, not similarly tarred, joined the braying 
mob no doubt to emphasize their own innocence.

An illustration of these diverging trends occurred in September 2013 when 
Stefan Ingves, Basel Committee Chairman, told the Financial Times that the 
proposed capital rules on instruments could be softened. Yet, only a couple 
months earlier, the UK government had announced tough amendments to the 
Banking Reform Bill. These amendments, following on from the recommen-
dations of the cross-party Commission on Banking Standards, consisting of 
distinguished members of both houses of Parliament,3 had introduced a new 
criminal offense of reckless misconduct for the management of a bank. The 
offense carries fines and a possible custodial sentence.
These legal initiatives, targeted at bankers, were framed by noble attempts to 
reduce the asymmetry of privatized gains and socialized losses. However, such 
initiatives will not protect us from financial crises. Moreover, because they 
increase the responsibility of senior managers on the one hand, and reduce 
their authority on the other, these measures could make banks even harder  
to manage—a scenario that bodes ill for financial stability. In Chapter 11, we 
will take a closer look at the role of criminal vs. civil law in financial regulation. 
For now it is suggested that while the palpable anger is justified, it solves 
little. The ascendence of the politically convenient idea that financial crises are 
caused by bad individuals condemns us to repeat boom and bust cycles. 
Of course, individual bank failures may be caused by individual actions. 
However, the authorities are already well equipped to deal with individual 
bank failures. They did this well with the collapse of Bank of Credit and 
Commerce International in 19914 and Barings in 1995. It is financial crashes 
causing destruction on a monumental scale that we must be better at avoid-
ing, reducing, or cushioning. Huge financial crashes do not arise from random 
acts of malfeasance. As suggested in the previous chapter, busts almost always 
follow booms. The longer and wider the boom, the deeper and more all-
encompassing the subsequent crash. Long, widespread booms do not happen 
because a few people do things they know are risky. Booms occur because 
droves of people are engaged in investments they believe are safe - so safe 
that it justifies doubling up on them. This misguided sense of well-being finds 
support in the dominant thinking of the day, broadcast by newspapers, univer-
sities, and even regulatory bodies. Often, the most sanctimonious regulators 
and central bankers are people who once presided over the annual publica-
tion of their central bank’s Financial Stability Review that was a cheerleader of

4Regulators, in response to money laundering allegations, triggered the 1991 collapse of 
the BCCI. They did not step in to mop up a collapse that had otherwise occurred. BCCI 
remains a mystery. It was implicated in the Iran-Contra affair and the CIA-supported 
funding of the Mujahideen’s resistance to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Regulators 
raided BCCI just as the Mujahideen declared victory.

the the idea that “this time is different” and that financial innovation will keep 
us safe as houses.5 The inconvenient truth is that even if all those potentially 
guilty bankers were not around before the financial crisis, it would still have 
happened. 
There is a suspicion that when the UK Parliamentary Commission was con-
sidering amendments to the Banking Reform Bill and the introduction of 
a new criminal offense, uppermost in its members’ minds was the case of  
Mr. Fred Goodwin. As CEO of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Goodwin 
had led a meteoric expansion followed by a spectacular bust of the bank 
while receiving handsome personal rewards along the way. He had backed big 
leveraged buyouts and audacious takeovers that took this once-small regional 
bank to being ranked the largest bank in the world by assets.6 These takeovers 
include that of the larger National Westminster Bank, which RBS had incor-
porated when it was three times its size by assets; the expensive takeover of 
US-based Charter One Financial; and, finally, the ill-fated attempted takeover 
of ABN Amro. Overzealous expansion contributed to the timing and magni-
tude of a failure that was so enormous it demanded public involvement lest 
the entire financial system be jeopardized. If ever there was a case of reckless 
­misconduct, this was it.7 
Yet, for the better part of a decade, the supervisors of RBS did not find these 
buyouts and takeovers reckless. They cheered them on. Supervisors believed 
larger banks were safer for all because of their higher capital ratios and econ-
omies of scale. During Mr. Goodwin’s tenure, the RBS cost-to-income ratio 
markedly improved with profits, capital, and assets showing strong growth. 
Supervisors also had an implicit tendency of wanting “national champions” 
to grow large. It gave them a bigger seat at the table of international regula-
tors. Finance, remember, was also routinely exempted from the remit of the 
­competition authorities on the grounds of financial stability.
5There are many examples and it is invidious to name names, but before history is 
airbrushed, it is helpful to reflect on the following quote from a highly intelligent central 
banker, no doubt consistent with the advice of his staff: “[It is] important [to ensure] that 
regulators keep enough distance from the markets to give financial innovations such as 
credit derivatives a chance to succeed. The new market for credit derivatives has grown 
largely outside of traditional regulatory oversight, and as I have described, evidence to 
date suggests that it has made an important contribution to financial stability.” Roger 
Ferguson Jr., Bank for International Settlements, Financial Engineering and Financial Stability,  
www.bis.org/review/r021122d.pdf, November 20, 2002.
6At its peak, RBS had assets of approximately $3 trillion and 200,000 employees.
7The case for the prosecution is best laid out in Ian Fraser’s book Shredded: Inside RBS,  
The Bank That Broke Britain (Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2014).

Further, banking often appears to benefit from economies-of-scale.8 Equity 
markets roared Mr. Goodwin on with higher share prices. The credit markets 
were unperturbed. His good deeds were even publically recognized when in 
2004 the plain Mr. Fred Goodwin became Sir Fred Goodwin—knighted for 
services to the banking industry. The tragicomedy of financial crashes is that 
today’s criminals were yesterday’s heroes. What appears the morning after to 
have been a reckless party was deemed modern and clever the night before. 
In the fatal words of Chuck Prince, former Citibank CEO, “when the music is 
playing you have to get up and dance.”9
Bankers were allowed to place risky bets in which they pocketed the gains 
while passing on losses to taxpayers. What happens in the new regime to 
those who make reckless investment decisions but are lucky? There is a dis-
tinct danger that we end up criminalizing the unlucky ones, while letting the 
equally reckless but lucky, go free. Surely, the full range of fiscal and regulatory 
measures, coupled with civil remedies, must be used to alter this skewed 
incentive structure. Even if we could provide well-distributed justice, locking 
up individual bandits is not going to save us from financial crashes. It is this 
narrow thinking that fosters a dangerous complacency, which in turn makes us 
vulnerable to the next financial boom.10 
We have shown that the criminal behavior of a few individuals is not the driver 
of crashes. Crises are the result of the madness of crowds. This runs counter 
to popular thinking that sees wisdom in crowds. Maybe crowds are often 
wise,11 but we are not going to minimize the heavy financial, economic and 
social cost of crises if we do not address the collective delusions underpining 
800 years of recorded financial folly.12
8However, the relationship between size and average costs has been found “to be U-shaped, 
suggesting that small banks can benefit from economies of scale as they grow bigger, but 
that large banks seem to suffer from diseconomies of scale and higher average costs due 
to factors like complexity as they increase in size.” Ingo Walter, “Economic Drivers of 
Structural Change in the Global Financial Services Industry,” Long Range Planning 42, nos. 
5–6 (2009), pp. 588–613.

stopped some time back.

Any lasting solution must make us less beholden to malleable measurements 
of value and risk. The current measurements almost always underestimate 
risks in the boom and overestimate them in the bust. We must be less reli-
ant on capital adequacy requirements based on these flawed measures of 
value and risk. Remember that many of the failed banks appeared well capi-
talized a year before crashing. In Chapters 5 and 6, we consider future rules 
geared toward minimizing the structural mismatch between risk taking and 
risk capacity—and do so across the entire financial sector. However, before 
looking at these proposals, it is useful to explore others that have gained 
popularity, especially in the United States, by promising to reduce tax payers 
burden through greater application of market discipline. 
One of these ideas focuses on improving self-discipline by threatening bank-
ers with jail time rather than reassuring them of a bailout. Attorney generals, 
who are political appointees, have been itching to stand up to the bankers and 
proclaim, “No bank is too big to jail on my watch”.13 This of course is easy to 
declare now but much harder to voice during a boom, when banks and bank-
ers try to wrap up some of their profits in good works. We have just argued 
that there are challenges in relying on criminal law to protect the financial 
system and will consider this again in greater depth in Chapter 11.
Other popular bailout approaches to saving the financial system that don’t 
involve taxpayers include automatic bail-ins of creditors and limiting bank size 
so that they cannot grow too big to fail. A third idea is to ring fence the nar-
row retail parts of banks that the taxpayer would underwrite from the fancier 
parts of investment banking that they would not. What is common to all these 
proposals is the idea that competition and contained bank failure will provide 
the discipline to deliver a safer banking system without expensive taxpayer 
bailouts. In the rest of this chapter, we consider each of these ideas from the 
perspective of financial stability. 
13At a press conference held on May 19, 2014 announcing the criminal plea by Credit 
Suisse in a tax evasion case, US Attorney General Eric Holder said that “this case shows 
that no financial institution, no matter its size or global reach, is above the law.” This 
seems to be the right stuff. However, I can’t help noticing that the firms the United States 
has targeted for megafines—UBS, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Credit Suisse, and BNP 
Paribas—are all non-US firms. This may be either a reflection of a nationalist motivation 
for justice or a concern stemming from the collapse of Arthur Andersen in 2002, when it 
was found guilty of criminal obstruction, showing that criminal convictions can collapse 
financial institutions. I can see, if not agree with, the political logic that says that if actions 
taken on the banks could kill them, better to kill the foreign ones that have modest local 
business.

Why “Bail-Ins” Won’t Work
Bail-in securities, also known as hybrid bonds, “CoCos,” or “wipeout bonds,” 
are du jour in regulatory circles. A bail-in security is a bond that pays a cou-
pon in good times. However, when the ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets 
falls below a preassigned level, the instrument converts into equity that is 
subordinated to all other debt and at risk of total loss. This new equity injec-
tion automatically dilutes existing shareholders. Regulators have approved 
instruments with an additional earlier trigger level that leads to the coupon 
being unpaid. The instruments could be market-based, contingent, convertible, 
capital instruments (so-called CoCos). Alternatively, the bail-in may be part of 
an official resolution regime where bond creditors must be bailed in before 
there is any public capital injection, as in the case of the 2013 EU rescue pack-
age for Cyprus. A hybrid can also be used where the authorities treat certain 
instruments with preapproved automatic bail-in features as permissible forms 
of regulatory capital.14 Barclays, UBS, Credit Agricole, SNS Reaal, and Societé 
Generale have all issued hybrid bonds with projections that at least €150  
billion (and maybe more) will be issued in the next few years.15 
Bail-ins promise to rectify failing banks with minimal financial fallout and  
taxpayer exposure. This all seems quite proper. Recurring images of bankers 
placing large bets using other people’s money, running off with the winnings, 
and leaving the taxpayer to pick up the losses, have given this initiative politi-
cal salience. But bail-ins are fools’ gold.16 They will not save taxpayers from 
exposure in times of financial crisis and could actually contribute to making 
matters worse.
While the terminology might be modern and clever bail-in securities are 
nothing new. They are market-based insurance instruments; a throwback to 
the failed philosophy at the heart of the Basel II Accord that made the mar-
ket pricing of risks the frontline defense against financial crises.17 However, 
financial crises are a result of a market failure. Using market prices to protect 
against market failure simply will not work. 
14Under Basel III, CoCos could qualify as either additional tier-one or tier-two capital 
depending on the triggers.

Financial crashes happen when markets least anticipate them. Bail-in investors 
underestimate risks in a boom and are shocked and ruined in a downturn. In 
2014, even before the economy was fully free of the clutches of the Global 
Financial Crisis (GFC), investors were queuing up to buy CoCo bonds at levels 
of interest rates considered historically low but which looked good compared 
with near-zero interest rates available on short-term deposits or Treasury Bills. 
Credit Agricole’s CoCo, issued in February 2014 and offering a 7.8 percent 
coupon, generated $25 billion of orders chasing a $1.75 billion issue.
In stable times, bail-in investors will use the optimistic valuations of these 
instruments as collateral against other investments and expenditure. When 
an event occurs that brings prices crashing down, bail-in investors will lose 
substantially and simultaneously. As bail-in investors face gaping, unantici-
pated losses, everyone will leap into risk-aversion mode. The ensuing fire 
sale of assets will cripple financial markets, sending asset values into further 
decline and undermining the solvency of the banking system.18 One mecha-
nism of this switch to general risk aversion, in a mirror image of the GFC, 
would be the likely contagion of rating downgrades of CoCos that would 
happen the minute one of them is unexpectedly converted into equity in 
the down phase of a macro-financial cycle. Bail-ins are supposed to happen 
before a bank has failed, to avert failure, but simultaneous bail-ins across a 
number of banks, coupled with the downgrade of CoCos issued by other 
banks, will bring a crisis forward and spread it. It is hard to imagine that any-
one who lived through the contagious fires of a financial crisis would seek 
refuge in such an idea. 
It does no good for protagonists of CoCos to argue that bail-ins were never 
designed to deal with systemic crises. If they are not created to meet this 
need, then they are unnecessarily dangerous. Central banks have already been 
dealing effectively with individual bank failures for decades. Furthermore, it is 
unrealistic to think that Europe only required another €150 billion of capital 
to offset bank losses and that bailing in this large but not overwhelming sum 
would not have been destabilizing. At the time of bail-ins being triggered, the 
markets would be paralyzed by uncertainty and spooked by a speculation 
of losses many times greater than the realized losses once the system has 
been stabilized. In September 2008, amid panic and a collapse in asset prices, 
creditors to Lehman Brothers were braced for a near $200 billion loss from 
its bankruptcy that month. However, by 2014, when the dust had settled and 
asset prices had recovered, the receivers were able to return them all of 
their money.

Gold,” Policy Brief 14-23, Peterson Institute for International Economics, November 2014.

What’s more, there remains the vexing problem of who should be the owner 
of bail-in securities. In the interests of financial stability, it should not be other 
banks or investors who get their leverage from banks, like hedge funds. Banks 
would then have to make payouts when they were least able, increasing the 
likelihood of a liquidity-sapping fire sale of assets. Regulators are convinced 
that long-term investors should own bail-in securities. This is troubling. Saving 
taxpayers by pushing pensioners under the bus is objectionable. Moreover, 
bygones are bygones, and once we are in a crisis, the economic consequences 
of imparting a large current loss to pensioners—who tend to spend much 
of their pension income—is likely to be more severe than giving a liability to 
future taxpayers. 
Furthermore, these securities are exactly the wrong kind of assets for long-
term investors. Long-term investors, such as life insurers or pension funds, 
should hold assets where risks fall over time—like public and private equity, 
where being long term is an advantage. They should shy away from assets 
where risks rise over time, like bail-in bonds. If I own a bail-in security for one 
day, the probability of it ever being bailed in is much smaller than if I hold on 
to the same security for 25 years.19 Regulators ought to be alert to this.
Bail-in proposals make for good politics and bad economics.20 Ostensibly, their 
raison d’être is to save taxpayers. Yet the experience of resolution-inspired 
“creditor bail-ins,” such as at Lehman’s in September 2008 and Cyprus in the 
spring of 2013,21 is that they end up being more costly than when taxpayers 
are more fully engaged through temporary ownership. This is borne out by 
the experience of Lloyds and RBS in the UK or AIG, where the US govern-
ment recently realized a profit of $22.7 billion. The harsh truth is that once 
regulation has failed and a financial crisis is upon us, the only player with copi-
ous amounts of the assets that matter, good credit, and enough time, is the 
taxpayer. Crisis management that bypasses taxpayers will in all likelihood fail 
and would definitely be inefficient.
Perhaps systemic crises would be better understood if they were defined as 
a scale of crisis that cannot be privately self-insured. The amount of liquidity 
and capital required to insure a bank against a time when all liquidity freezes, 
19This is a critical, though complex, point that we shall return to in greater depth in 
Chapter 5.
20But it doesn’t make for good politics when a bail-in actually takes place—witness 
Greece, Cyprus, and Ireland—as those bailed in seldom feel they have been reasonably 
compensated for, or sufficiently warned of the loss.
21On March 25, 2013, the Eurogroup, (European Commission, European Central Bank and 
other EU agencies) and the International Monetary Fund announced a €10 billion injection 
of cash to Greece on the condition that Cyprus would bail in depositors. Deposits below 
€100,000 were saved in the final negotiations, but the accounts were frozen for deposits 
above this level as well as for other creditors. They were to be repaid based on the amount 
that the receivers could recover.

and all asset valuations collapse, is not viable at a systemic or institutional level. 
Banks would become nothing more than deposit boxes, unable to provide 
significant credit and struggling to compete with that space underneath the 
mattress. 
Why Eliminating “Too-Big-to-Fail” Is Not a 
Solution to Systemic Risk
A popular narrative of the financial crisis is that the banks knew that if they 
became really huge they would be classified as too big to fail.22 The story con-
tinues that the bankers knew that were their high-earning, high-risk bets fail, 
it would be reasonable to expect a bailout by the government of a large bank. 
Even in the near collapse and public rescue, they expected not to be sacked as 
they were the only ones with sufficient understanding of the complexities of 
a large bank to ensure any rescue plan succeeded. Managers might have to be 
motivated to help. They would not have to go into hiding.23 The narrators of 
this story explain that this created at least two adverse incentives. Banks were 
encouraged to expand even when commercial logic, the capacity of internal 
systems, and the governance necessary to cope with size, dictated against such 
expansion.24 Once banks became too big, they were further incentivized to 
take even riskier bets. The moral of this tale is to ensure that banks never get 
too big. In the words of Allan Meltzer, perhaps most famously quoted by Sir 
Mervyn King, “If a bank is too big to fail, it is too big.”25 
Like all popular narratives, this tale is simple and compelling. But it doesn’t sit 
well with the facts. It was actually the smaller banks, or at least those chal-
lenging the largest banks, that were the catalysts for the crisis. Think of Bear 
Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Countryside, and Washington Mutual in the US, IKB 
22The logic was that because of the bank’s size, complexity, and interconnectedness, should 
it fail, there would be such severe, broad, and adverse consequences that the authorities 
would try to avoid failure by rescuing the bank.
23Despite much heat and light about banks originating toxic instruments, when it came 
to rescuing the banks, many of the architects and traders of these instruments had to be 
retained, even lured by bonuses, so that regulators could understand, value, and unwind the 
offending instruments. The decision to retain them was not without anguish.
24In my experience as a non-executive director of a few organizations, managements 
everywhere, not just in banking, assume that there are economies of scale and so growth 
will always improve the current financial position. Growth is then touted as the solution 
to financial vulnerability rather than a contributory cause. Instead, I have observed that 
organizations often exhibit unforeseen diseconomies of scale. After a period of growth, 
critical IT, HR, and accounting systems snap under the strain, requiring fast, unanticipated, 
and costly expenditures. This imperils the organization’s financial position, whereupon 
management touts the solution of more growth.

in Germany, the Cajas in Spain, Northern Rock, Halifax Bank of Scotland, and 
Bradford and Bingley in the UK. The crisis was based on these banks challeng-
ing the largest ones, like HSBC, J. P. Morgan, and Deutsche Bank, all of whom 
were better placed to withstand the eventual onslaught. This is typical of other 
crises too. One of the most severe banking crises in the UK, referred to as 
the Secondary Banking Crisis of 1973–75, occurred when the Bank of England 
had to avert the failure of 30 small banks and assist 30 others that had lent 
excessively to the bust property market—a common feature of banking crises.  
A decade later, the United States suffered the savings and loan disaster, where 
a quarter of the savings and loan associations in America failed. Taxpayers 
forked out $341 billion to save them.
It is certainly the case that a number of big banks quickly followed the smaller 
ones into crisis. Names like RBS in the UK, Fortis in Belgium, Allied Irish 
in Ireland, and Bankia in Spain are obvious examples of this phenomenon. 
Justification for their rescue has often been related to both their size and 
their interconnectivity. However, these were often small banks that had bal-
looned rapidly as a result of aggressive behavior and exhibited greater simi-
larities to the “challenger” banks in their market-share hunger, than with the 
­franchise-managing larger banks. 
The evidence of financial crises disrupts simple conclusions. This includes the 
one suggesting that banking failures were driven by an irresponsible compla-
cency borne out of the security of being too big to fail. Certainly, competition 
is almost always a good thing, especially from the perspective of customer 
choice and political independence. But the correlation between challenger 
banks, big or small, and subsequent bank failure, makes gray-haired regulators 
wary of concentrating on making banks smaller. The trade-off between aggres-
sive competitors and financial instability is not an unfounded bias but rather 
one that is historically well supported.26
Risk is caused by concentration. Increasing the number of banks might support 
financial stability if it increased total diversity in banking behavior. However, if 
the majority of banks behave homogenously then having more smaller banks 
will not impact diversity. They are likely to behave the same as a signal they are 
not a riskier proposition than others, or because they are compelled to do 
so to change by regulators or accountants on the grounds of “best practice”.
A mass of hungry, small banks may even increase concentration. Small banks, 
having a less commanding view of markets than the handful of large banks, 
tend to cling to the older, mechanistic, loan-approval systems. Being small and

seemingly insignificant, these players disregard the significance of all banks 
lending to the same sector. Without a backward glance, they accelerate when 
in a booming economy, where borrowers look safe and their collateral appears 
sound. Four huge banks or forty smaller banks acting in an identical manner 
will produce the same outcome—a deadly increase in systemic risk. But res-
cuing, or taking into public ownership forty institutions is far more challenging 
than four. The savings-and-loan disaster and the secondary banking crisis were 
particularly frustrating, protracted affairs. 
Policy makers may wish to make big banks smaller in an effort to increase 
competition and consumer choice. They may even be those courageous souls 
who want to see a reduction in the power of the bank lobbies by limiting the 
size of banks.27 The lobbying power of an industry with many small players, for 
example savings institutions or individual consumers, is usually weaker than 
that of those industries with a few large players—such as banks, energy, and 
defense.28
Increased competition and consumer choice and a weaker banking lobby are 
all laudable goals. But breaking up the big banks into smaller players with 
the expectation that this will lead to a safer financial system is misguided.  
If anything, it takes us into more dangerous territory. In a world where uncer-
tainty is the only constant, the more players present, the more standardized 
the metrics employed. The larger the herd, the deeper the concentrations 
of risk—which indicates a higher probability of systemic failure and an even 
greater challenge in managing such failure.29 
A laudable alternative path is for regulators to insist that systemically impor-
tant institutions carry additional capital. This would force banks to internalize 
the adverse, wider consequences of a bank being too big to fail while continu-
ing to offer customers and well-capitalized institutions the benefits of econo-
mies of scale. Basel III and the Financial Stability Board have moved toward

in Global Finance,” in Monetary Orders: The Political Foundations of Twenty-First Century Money, 
ed. Jonathan Kirshner (New York: Cornell University Press, 2002).
28This is not always the case. Some countries, especially those with a culture of local 
mutual-savings institutions, like Germany and previously the UK, convincingly argue that 
they speak with the powerful voice of “ordinary men and women.”

this alternative. Those classed as systemically important financial institutions 
(SIFIs) must set aside an extra dollop of capital, consisting of 2.5 percent of 
risk-weighted assets.30 
The utility of this approach would have to be prevented from erosion over 
time by the forces of political economy. There is significant reputational risk 
to regulators who fail to identify an institution that later proves systemic. 
Conversely, they face little reputational risk from identifying an institution 
as systemic even if it is not. Add the fact that there is no shared understand-
ing of systemic risk, and it is likely that these lists will continuously lengthen 
and broaden in scope. The definition of systemically significant will get boiled 
down to size and it is likely that several large nonbank financial institutions 
will be netted by this definition. Many life insurers and asset managers have 
greater assets than some banks and increasingly find themselves classified as 
“systemically important” and treated as such. Yet, as long as their supervisors 
ensure that they stick to their core business, and their liabilities are not used 
as a cash proxy, or are not being on lent to others, then they are not systemic. 
Too broad a list would defeat the purpose behind requiring SIFIs to have more 
capital. The idea is to internalize the adverse social consequences of the pri-
vate decision to become systemically important or not. Firms could choose 
to become systemically significant, or move into systemically significant busi-
nesses, but they would need more capital to do so. They may then conclude 
that it is more profitable to remain systemically insignificant. We will return to 
some of these issues in Chapter 5. 
Ring Fencing
Another popular idea is to “ring fence” retail banking operations so they are 
insulated from perilous investment-banking undertakings. The argument is that 
taxpayers must bail out banks because were they not to act, the payments sys-
tem would buckle and strain. No confidence in the payments system inevitably 
leads to the entire financial system failing hotly, followed by the collapse of the 
entire economy. The argument goes that banks endanger themselves by doing 
many things that are not related to the payments system. Some argue that if 
we could disentangle systemically important activities like deposit taking and 
loan making from the rest, we would be able to limit a taxpayer-funded bailout 
to the systemic, narrow, retail-focused division.
30In November 2013, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) updated the list of globally and 
systemically important banks to include: Bank of America, Bank of China, Bank of New York 
Mellon, Barclays, BBVA, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman 
Sachs, Groupe BPCE, Group Crédit Agricole, HSBC, ING Bank, Industrial and Commercial 
Bank of China Limited, J. P. Morgan Chase, Mitsubishi UFJ FG, Mizuho FG, Morgan Stanley, 
Nordea, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander, Société Générale, Standard Chartered, State 
Street, Sumitomo Mitsui FG, UBS, Unicredit Group, and Wells Fargo.

This would allow banks to do both investment and retail business, benefitting 
from common brands. However, these different activities would be ring fenced 
from each other. The ring fencing would be done to try and ensure that the 
failure of the investment bank would not bring down the retail bank, and, if the 
retail bank had to be rescued, it could be saved without aiding the investment 
arm of the operations.31 From a taxpayer’s perspective, the logic is impeccable. 
But it is not clear to me that this makes fundamental sense from the indus-
try’s perspective. Are there strong benefits in creating common yet separate 
brands that would justify the existence of this odd creature? I suspect that 
investment bankers endorse ring fencing because they feel it will allow them 
to break free of the shackles of copious amounts of burdensome banking 
regulations that they feel are irrelevant to them.
Ring fencing is actually more troublesome than it first appears. Although there 
is much discussion around the growth of the shadow banking system and 
derivative instruments, this has been accompanied by a rapid expansion of 
bank lending. Shadow banking, derivatives, and the fancier side of banking, 
complement the traditional banking system. They are not the alternatives or 
substitutes some seem to believe they are. 
After the collapse of Continental Illinois, as well as other individual bank fail-
ures, regulators became disillusioned with the traditional model where loan 
officers made subjective judgments on customers’ credit worthiness. The sup-
posed independence of markets looked more attractive. Starting with the 
1996 Markets Risk Amendment of Basel I and solidified with Basel II, regula-
tors promoted the application of market values to traditional banking. Capital 
had to be set aside based on market valuations and the estimations of credit 
rating agencies. Before long banks were utilizing credit derivatives to mea-
sure, manage and allocate lending exposures. Removing these structures in 
order to ring fence simplified deposit taking and bank lending and makes retail 
finance more expensive but not necessarily any safer.
However perverse it may appear, the way forward to a safer financial system 
is to embrace risk rather than try to ban it. The oxygen of growth is risk. Risk 
must be managed, spread, pooled, and diversified. But to think we can make it 
disappear altogether is delusional. Any attempt to systematically rid one area 
of risk simply shifts it to a new location. As we rid it from that new area it 
simply shifts again. This process continues not until risk disappears but until 
31This idea is perhaps best articulated and argued in the 2011 Vickers Report written by 
the Independent Commission on Banking. Set up by the UK government in 2010, the 
commission was charged with proposing structural reforms that would promote stability 
in the UK banking system.

we can no longer see it—hardly the makings of a good risk-management strat-
egy.32 And yet this is the objective of too much of today’s regulation. To really 
tackle systematic risk we need to know as much about where it is going to as 
where it is coming from. 
A better approach recognizes that in a growing economy there will be risk 
and the task is to decide how best to absorb it. This requires substantial risk 
transfers across the financial system. Large lending institutions, because of 
their potential for diversification across credit risks, have the capacity to 
absorb credit risk. They should be encouraged to hold credit risk. They should 
also sell the risk they cannot easily soak up. If they are typical banks taking 
in short-term deposits this is principally long-term liquidity and market risks. 
Long-term savings institutions with their long-term liabilities, have the capacity 
to absorb liquidity and market risk. They could buy these risks from banks and, 
in return, sell them credit risk.
Not all risk transfers are good. Those that took place pre-boom were the exact 
opposite of what would be desired from a systemic risk perspective and were 
at the center of the financial crisis. However this was largely because regula-
tors made it costly for banks to take credit risks through capital requirements 
and discouraged long-term savers from buying illiquid assets. Consequently, 
risk ended up where it was best hidden from capital requirements and regu-
lation rather than where it would have been best absorbed naturally. Banks 
were left carrying liquidity risk in vehicles that were off their balance sheets 
and had little risk-absorptive capacity. This shifted credit risk to hedge or pen-
sion funds. Of course these funds had even less natural capacity to hold the 
risks but the capital requirements for doing so were lower. 
The right risk transfers happen when the capital adequacy regime reflects 
mismatches between an institution’s natural risk capacity and the risk it is 
holding. Risks are then incentivized to go where they are best absorbed and 
held. It is the simplest way to safely risk manage the financial sector while 
facilitating economic growth. In the next chapter, we shall look more closely 
at this concept and how it could be implemented. For now, I observe that 
poorly constructed ring fences hamper appropriate transfers of risk and cre-
ate trapped reservoirs of badly matched credit and liquidity risks—a scenario 
that is neither safe nor efficient.

How Should 
We Regulate 
the Financial 
System?
In this chapter, the focus is on the areas where my work offers the greatest 
departure from current practice and thinking. I will show that a reinvention 
of financial regulation can deliver a financial system that is less prone to crash 
and can do this without ossifying finance. It will achieve these goals because it 
is better at managing financial risk across the financial system.
In Chapter 2, I identified the two principal aims of financial regulation as  
containing systemic risk and protecting consumers protection. In Chapter 3, 
I argued that, today, understanding how to contain systemic risk is the greater 
challenge for policy makers. Consumer protection is an equally vital objective 
of financial regulation. In the past, consumers of finance have been undoubt-
edly let down by the inadequate regulation of unscrupulous providers. Yet,  
I believe regulators show greater understanding of what should be done in 
the area of consumer protection than in the area of systemic risk. Regulators 
are prioritizing protection of genuinely vulnerable consumers—especially 
from the deceitful and aggressive selling of financial products. They want to 
5

Chapter 5 | How Should We Regulate the Financial System?
56
ensure that consumers are free of the perils of conflicts of interest by financial  
service providers while simultaneously supporting choice and innovation in 
the industry so that the average consumer can better manage their financial 
risks and uncertainties.
Exactly where along the continuum of protection and choice the balance 
should be is of course one of the critical challenges—in finance as it is in 
other areas. Regulators are unlikely to ever settle the point of balance, as 
it shifts over time with the ebb and flow of societal sensitivities. This is yet 
another process that has procyclical and political dimensions. In the backlash 
after a financial crisis, the line tends to be redrawn on the side of the greater 
consumer protection of all. Some activities are banned outright and responsi-
bility and liability shifts to providers. In boom times, the line is often redrawn 
in the other direction1 with regulators pressured to abolish “financial repres-
sion.”2 The heated debate that surrounds consumer protection is inevitable. 
However, it is not an indication that regulators are as much in the wilderness 
with consumer protection as they are with systemic risk. We will explore 
consumer protection in greater detail in Chapter 7.
Several measures show that the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) that began in 2007  
and reached its nadir after the collapse of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, 
was the deepest and longest crisis since the Great Crash of 1929 and the ensu-
ing Great Depression of the 1930s. That Depression ushered in the greatest 
number of structural reforms of the financial sector to take place at one time.3 
Indeed, it paved the way for the most internationally agreed vision of collec-
tive stability—signed at Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods, New 
York, in 1944.4 There is some evidence that systemic risks have grown steadily  
following the breakdown in the 1970s of this Bretton Woods system of 
pegged exchange rates and capital controls. Crises post-Bretton Woods have 
each seemed deeper or broader than the last. Before the GFC of 2007–9, we  
experienced the global crisis dubbed the “dot-com debacle” of 1999–2002, 
1In 1996, as the dot-com euphoria was getting going, the US Congress passed legislation to 
remove some restrictions on retail access to hedge funds. In retrospect, this would have 
been the time to tighten them.
2Financial repression includes such policies as maximum loan rates or minimum deposit 
rates. These policies are designed to protect vulnerable consumers from usury. However, 
since they stop the market for loans or funds clearing at whatever price they clear at, they 
do reduce the total possibilities available to all borrowers and savers.
3In the United States, the 1929 Great Crash and subsequent Great Depression of the 1930s  
gave birth to the Banking Act of 1933 (more commonly known as the Glass-Steagall Act). 
The bill was designed “to provide for the safer and more effective use of the assets of 
banks . . . to prevent the undue diversion of funds into speculative operations and for other 
purposes.” It separated commercial and investment banking. The crisis also brought into 
fruition the Securities Act of 1933 and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

and the Making of the Postwar Order (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2014).

marked as one of the most debilitating postwar crises of the developed world. 
We should also note the devastating regional crises—such as the Asian 
Financial Crisis of 1997–98 and the earlier European Monetary System (EMS) 
Crises of 1992–93 and 1995. The EMS crisis was broader, if not deeper, than 
the preceding Latin American Debt Crisis of 1983–85.
Some argue that the trend of ever-increasing financial crises is actually part 
of a longer-term cycle. Whenever I hear discussion of trends and cycles,  
I am reminded of E. H. Carr’s wry observation that the way we view the past,  
and whether it resembles a trend or cycle, relates to where we are in the 
present.5 When times are good, we tend to see the past as a trend, with things 
just getting better and better over time. When times are bad, we tend to see 
cycles and draw the lesson that while things are bad today, they will be likely 
to turn up later. Our optimism is more enduring than our perspective. I am 
also struck by Professor A. C. Pigou’s observation in The Veil of Money6 of the 
changing views of money a little less than 100 years ago and their resonance 
with the last 20 years:
In the years preceding the First World War there were in common use 
among economists a number of metaphors . . . “Money is a wrapper in 
which goods come,” “Money is the garment draped round the body of 
economic life” . . . . During the 1920s and 1930s . . . money, the passive veil, 
took on the appearance of an evil genius; the garment became a Nessus 
shirt; the wrapper a thing liable to explode. Money, in short, after being 
little or nothing, was now everything.
There is no need to draw a conclusion as to whether we are in a short 
trend or a super cycle to be concerned that the financial system, and financial 
­innovation, appears today to be the source of the amplification and spread 
of economic risks rather than a force for their absorption and mitigation. 
Financial crises have for too long been a frequent, severe, and contagious 
phenomenon of our lives. Reasonable observers cannot confidently state that 
financial regulation is on the right track and all that is required is nudging 
bank capital adequacy requirements up a couple percentage points, tighten up  
exemptions to the requirements and maybe some additional tweaking.7

The Practice of History (New York: Cromwell, 1968). See Edward Hallett Carr, What Is 
History? (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1961).

7Besides the introduction of the long-term stable funding ratios, which are being delayed 
anyway, much of Revised Basel II (more popularly known as Basel III) could be characterized 
in this way.

In fairness, many in the developing world have been making similar ­observations 
for some time as they watched “emerging markets” experience increasingly 
deep and contagious crises. In the post-Bretton Woods era, the sequence of 
international emerging market crises started with the Latin American Debt 
Crisis followed by the Tequila Crisis,8 before moving on to the Asian Financial 
Crisis, with a host of deep but less international crises in between.9 During 
these emerging market crises, the default response of wealthy countries 
declared that the system was not a problem. The fault lay with these poor 
countries who lacked the necessary fiscal and political discipline to prevent 
themselves from being so badly hit. The inevitably bitter medicine they offered 
up directly, or through agencies they influenced, like the IMF, was real wage 
cuts through austerity and devaluation and mandatory opening up to inter-
national banking.10 Reforming the international system and ring-fencing local 
bank capital only rose to the top of the agenda, along with an acknowledge-
ment of the adverse implications of pursuing austerity simultaneously, when 
the GFC engulfed the rich nations. What we consider to be self-evidently 
right for others is often not what we consider right for ourselves.
No one said life was fair. However, it is worth noting the connection between 
the international political economy in the twenty years prior to the GFC and 
aspects of that crisis. Having been severely burned by crises in the 1980s and 
1990, and feeling that their concerns and complaints about the working of 
the international financial system went unheeded, ­emerging markets sought 
ways to reduce their dependency on the ­international financial system and its 
institutions. Faced with improving trade positions as a result of exchange-rate 
depreciations during the Asian crisis and increased ­consumption in rich coun-
tries, they channeled surpluses into ­rainy-day reserves and funds. An initially 
reinforcing, but ultimately unstable feedback loop emerged.11 Reflecting the 
superior liquidity and dominant role of the US dollar in international financial 
transactions, the national savings of these countries were ­concentrated in US 
8The “Tequila Crisis” of 1994–95 centered on Mexico and the pressure on the exchange 
rate band—relating to a prior borrowing binge—that “broke” at the end of 1994.  
The cumulative 55 percent devaluation of the Mexican peso had adverse consequences for 
its Latin trading partners and competitors.

Capital Flows in Calm and Turbulent Times: The Need for New International Architecture

10This is how the IMF acquired its moniker, “It’s Mostly Fiscal,” and why one cannot 
underestimate the degree of resentment many in developing countries feel toward the 
organization.

David Folkerts-Landau, and Peter Garber in “An Essay on the Revived Bretton Woods 
System” (Working Paper 9971, Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic Research, 
September 2003).

Government instruments. This ready ­buying of government debt loosened the 
reins of fiscal discipline in the United States, facilitating fiscal adventures such 
as the Bush Tax Cut and wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Low interest rates on 
government debt created a demand for private investment and consumption 
that spilled over to other countries as reflected in a wide US account deficit.
Stronger spending and growth in the world’s largest economies added to 
trade surpluses and international reserves in the main emerging-market 
­exporters. Every economic textbook and macromodel states that a large  
current account deficit, at a time of low unemployment, is a sign of excessive 
demand that should be curtailed by tighter fiscal, monetary, and regulatory 
policy. To do otherwise could lead to inflation or bust. But that is unpopular 
and politicians have elections to fight. Moreover the inflation was coming in 
the form of asset prices rather than items in the consumer price index. It 
was far better for politicians, central bankers, and investors in these rising 
asset prices to assert that this time is different. It was better to worry about 
­deflation in Japan and to view the large current account deficits in places 
like the United States and, United Kingdom as signs of structural investment 
booms driven by the superiority of American and English bankers and their 
financial system over which policy makers were powerless. The resulting asset 
market bubble inevitably burst.12
It was easier for policy makers in the spending countries to focus on the 
­conduct of other countires. To do otherwise would have forced them to 
­examine their failure to conduct adequately tight fiscal, monetary, and 
­regulatory policies. In reality, global reserve increases played an aggravating 
part in the story of the past 20 years. However, they were more a symptom 
of excessive borrowing than a cause of the crisis.13 Greater faith in an inter-
national lender of last resort that does not require troubled countries to 
throw out the baby with the bathwater in return for emergency assistance 
that might have provided greater diversity in the investment of savings. This, in 
turn, might have tempered the boom that led to the bust.14 It is all a huge “if.” 
Foreigners are always easier to blame but the scale of the boom meant that 
the main protagonists had to be local to the world’s largest economies rather 
than on the periphery. Perhaps the simple point is that there is an interna-
tional dimension to financial regulation that we have so far neglected. We will 
consider this again in Chapter 14, but first let us focus on what must be done 
on the home front.

Financial Regulation and Procyclicality
In Chapters 3 and 4, I argued that while the financial sector may have more 
than its fair share of crooks, financial crashes are not caused by the antics 
of a few.15 The antecedent of financial crises is often some prior event or 
­reasonable belief—frequently centered on the arrival of a new technology 
that initially drives a collective underestimation of risk and boom. Market 
participants are drawn into areas widely perceived to be safe. Confidence 
and conviction is as widespread as it is intense creating a haughty spirit,  
often ­celebrated in popular culture making everyone feel they can make a  
fortune in the ­markets.16 When the safe turns out to be risky, widespread 
shock, dislocation, and despair ensues. In short, the problem is a collective 
miscalculation of risk that sustains the financial boom and sows the seeds for 
the inevitable bust to come.
The “procyclicality” of the financial cycle is why the Basel II shift toward 
more market-sensitive risk measurements, such as banks’ own internal risk 
­models or public credit ratings, was fundamentally flawed. It was doubling up 
on ­danger inevitably leading to disaster. Credit availability is the major deter-
minant of asset prices, especially in housing markets.17 As a boom develops, 
rising valuations and falling assessments of risk push down Basel II–type capital 
requirements, incentivizing banks to lend more by pushing up asset valuations. 
The history of rising asset prices pushes down perceived risks.18 Those banks 
that don’t increase their lending in the boom lose market share and face 
15It doesn’t always look that way, as financial booms and the greed they unleash increase 
the number of swindlers, the size of the swindles, and the propensity of the ordinary public 
to be swindled.
16In a story that has been distorted by time and moment, Joe Kennedy, father of President 
Kennedy, claims to have sold his stocks in the winter of 1928, less than a year before the 
Great Crash, after his shoe-shine boy told him to buy Hindenburg shares—makers of the 
Zeppelin. “You know it’s time to sell when shoeshine boys give you stock tips. This bull 
market is over,” Quoted in Ronald Kessler’s “The Sins of the Father: Joseph P Kennedy and 
the Dynasty He Founded”, (Warner Books, March 1997).

18Simply put, banks are required to put aside capital—approximately 8 percent of risk-
weighted assets. If reported risks fall, the amount of capital required falls. Invariably what 
happens in a boom is that reported risks fall at the same time as assets grow, so that the 
dollar amount of capital may well rise to record levels. What we observe precrisis is a 
rising leverage ratio (total assets to bank equity) and postcrisis, when risk is reestimated, 
is that capital has fallen to dangerous levels.

­slipping stock prices.19 At the top of the boom, when banks should be most 
cautious, the constraining forces of bank regulation and capital requirements 
are weak,20 with reported capital at historically high ratios to risk and flattered 
by inflated valuations and deflated risk assessments.
Equally troubling is when this process shifts into reverse during a bust. 
Collapsing valuations and rising risk assessments push up capital requirements, 
reducing lending and borrowing—even though the credit mistakes were made 
previously. This deleveraging shrinks asset valuations further, reducing lending 
yet again and deepening the recession. Banking regulation should act to check 
the financial cycle but the switch to a so-called risk-sensitive approach in  
Basel II inevitably, and predictably, amplified the crisis.21 
While many may find it self-evident that you cannot prevent market failures 
with the greater use of market prices,22 there are those whose Panglossian 
view of markets leads them to counter that the underlying problem of mises-
timation of risks is really an issue of misinformation. If only market participants 
had better information they would make the best-possible judgment. This is 
reinforced by the frequent cry of indignant participants post-crash, exclaiming 
that if only they had been forearmed with such-and-such information, they 
would not have joined the party the night before. 
It was only after the GFC that the mortgage originators’ lack of due

for bank managers. Unfortunately for Mr. Prince the music had stopped but he was still 
dancing.

21An increasing number of people claim to have correctly predicted the crisis. But predicting 
that something in the economy and society is amiss and predicting the inevitability of a 
banking crisis are different. Contrary to public opinion, there were a number of people 
who identified the direct causal link between the increasing market sensitivity of banking 
regulation and a future banking crisis. The problem was that few wanted to hear it. See: (1)

the outsiders only became clear as the Japanese property bubble burst in the 
1980s. The same was true in the United States during the Panic of 1907.23 
The idea that market failure is caused by inadequate information is behind the 
near-religious faith placed in transparency and in moves made toward greater 
disclosures, mark-to-market accounting, the encouragement of credit bureaus, 
credit ratings, and more.
In general, the more information, the better, and the disposition of greater 
transparency should only be tempered by specific cause.24 Information 
asymmetries are at the heart of consumer protection issues. More exten-
sive disclosure of potential conflicts of interest and greater transparency are 
important contributions to consumer protection from unfair practices. They 
are also devices to preserve the integrity of, and confidence in, the financial 
system. However, my close-up experience of several financial booms leaves me 
unconvinced that it is a lack of disclosure that is the root cause of systemic 
risks. Enhanced transparency would not have made much difference. This is an 
inconvenient notion for those on the post-crisis hunt for that smoking gun of 
who knew what and when they knew it. 
Generally in today’s world, information is more widely disseminated and more 
quickly revealed than ever before. Yet this explosion of information has not 
coincided with weaker financial crises. The opposite has occurred. As we have 
discussed, booms are caused by a collective belief that a new technology will 
transform the future. Invariably, this comes with the assertion that old rela-
tionships lack relevance and there is a new paradigm so investors should zero 
in on the new metrics. If an investor during the dot-com bubble of 1997–99, 
insisted on finding out more about the profit and loss of one of the instant 
multimillion-dollar start-ups—Pets.com, e-Toys.com, or Webvan.com25—
she would have been laughed out of town as a dim-witted dinosaur. In a voice 
23“By 1890 just 300 trusts [in the United States] controlled 5,000 companies. Financial 
practices aided insiders while relevant information to investors and other outsiders 
remained problematic and usually hidden.” Gary Giroux, Business Scandals, Corruption and 
Reform (Santa Barbara, CA: Greenwood Press, 2013).
24There are examples of where greater transparency, especially in the greater frequency 
of reporting, can lead to greater market instability. See Benu Schneider, ed., The Road to 
International Financial Stability: Are Key Financial Standards the Answer? (New York: Palgrave 
Macmillan, 2003). Similarly, disclosures can bring harm to private asset holders—making 
them out as targets for physical harm for example—and so a public interest test should 
be brought to bear on the form and extent of disclosures. I once started receiving hate 
mail at my home address from an anti-vivisection group, that had caused serious harm to 
some of their other targets, because I was sometime previously a director of a division of 
State Street Bank and another division of the bank was at the time of the letters acting as 
a custodian for an asset manger who held shares in a company that had tested its products 
on animals. The custodian’s name was down as the owner of the shares.

just $2.5 million by 2001.

reserved for teaching young children, it would be explained that the new 
metric is obvious, only the stupid fail to understand the value of the number 
of “eyeballs”26 and those not on board with the new metrics, will miss out on 
huge gains. This collective delusion was prolonged—over three years in the 
case of the dot-com bubble—because the starry-eyed evangelists appeared 
right, hip, and rich. The heretics in hair shirts appeared wrong, staid, and more 
impoverished with every passing year. Avoiding embarrassment in front of 
one’s peers is a powerful insulation that protects bubbles from bursting early. 
One of the defining aspects of the GFC was that the ­underlying technological 
revolution was the least tangible of all previous ­revolutions. Even tulip mania 
had tulips.27 The notion this time around was that the cleverness of bankers 
and the sophistication of their computer models allowed risks to be better  
managed.28 Hubris is unbridled in financial booms. Added to the belief in  
better risk management was a traditional housing market boom like those 
that underscore most financial booms. Many of the new risk management 
products that ended up exploding were instruments aimed at diversifying real 
estate risk. Although they are frequent, housing booms also come with a host 
of reasons why traditional borrowing limits no longer apply and why property 
prices in a particular area must keep on outpacing the rise of incomes, rents, 
GDP, reservoir capacity, bridge capacity or car parking spaces. In London, 
the stories tend to hover around planning or other genuine restrictions 
on new housing supply or the appeal of London to the world’s latest set of  
tax-averse, newly-enriched tycoons.29
During the GFC, little attention was paid to income ­verification because prop-
erty prices were expected to rise strongly. If ­property prices are expected to 
rise by 20 percent per annum, a loan of 99 percent of the value of the prop-
erty, with the slimmest of equity protection for the lender at the outset, would 
have a buffer of 40 percent in a mere two years. By 2005 and 2006, almost no 
one had experienced a 40 percent decline in property prices for almost two 
26Or the number of visits to online shops.
27Arguably, some of the ventures during the South Sea Bubble of 1720 in England were 
equally intangible. The allure of the discovery of South America for Western Europeans 
drove that bubble higher. One prospectus during the South Sea Bubble read: “A company 
for carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.” See 
Charles Mackay, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds (Lexington, KY: 
Maestro Reprints, 1841/2014).
28Hans Christian Andersen’s story, The Emperor’s New Clothes, comes to mind.
29Less often stated by the boom’s cheerleaders, but equally important, is how much easier 
it is to borrow money to invest in housing, with the attendant tax advantages, than for 
almost any other investment. Lord Adair Turner, former Chairman of the UK’s Financial 
Services Authority, among others, has frequently emphasized this driver of property and 
financial booms. See Jerin Matthew, “Lord Turner: Britain’s Property Frenzy Will Lead to 
Another Financial Crisis,” International Business Times, March 27, 2014, www.ibtimes.

decades, long beyond the memory of the fresh-faced borrowers, real-estate 
agents, and lenders. Lenders easily convinced themselves that, if after a couple 
years borrowers could not afford repayments, they would be able to repos-
sess the property, resell it, and still make a full recovery of their loan, interest 
and costs. This held so as long as the property value had not fallen by more 
than a seemingly impossible percentage. It is a short jump from this thinking 
to adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), where repayments start off low before 
rising after two years, or even Northern Rock’s Tomorrow Mortgages that 
were 120 percent of the value of the property being mortgaged. 
Upfront mortgages and real estate commissions created incentives for aggres-
sive selling that must be addressed. However, booms and busts exist on a scale 
too huge to be easily reduced as the sole work of greedy commission agents. 
Booms are aided and abetted by the average person who is buoyed by a belief 
that it all makes sound financial sense. What appears obviously foolish in the 
cold light of hindsight seemed to almost all as clever the night before. Financial 
regulation has to act as a countervailing force to these long swings of market 
optimism. It cannot rely on statistical measures of current risk or market esti-
mates of future risk. To do so would make financial regulation procyclical, in 
danger of augmenting market failures rather than dampening it. 
This was the grave error of Basel II. Many conscientious souls, who spent a 
major part of their career bringing Basel II to fruition, understandably find 
it tough to admit to the fundamental flaws of the exercise. Some argue that 
it was not Basel II at fault but rather mark-to-market accounting and bank-
ers’ pay. They remind us that Basel II was not yet in full force in the boom 
years leading up to the GFC.30 While mark-to-market accounting and bank-
ers’ pay did play an adverse role—something we ­discuss in Chapters 8 and 
10—this argument is disingenuous. The philosophy of Basel II was about a 
more market-sensitive approach—of which the adoption of mark-to-market 
accounting and market-sensitive risk management models were key ele-
ments. Tied up with this philosophy was the notion of enhanced reliance 
on market discipline that would make intervening in market valuations, 
market risk assessments, bank business models, and market-determined 
pay both unnecessary and distortionary.31 Moreover, this philosophy had  
triumphed in Basel long before the implementation of Basel II.32 It is found 
30A sophisticated version of this defense of Basel II can be found in the response to 
my general arguments by Jesus Saurina, the highly intelligent, conscientious director  
of the Stability Department of Banco de España, in the IMF’s Finance and Development  
(June 2008), pp. 29–33.
31Market discipline was the essential component of the third of Basel II’s three pillars.

in the amendments to the implementation of Basel I as early as the 1996 
amendment on market risks, which introduced the idea of banks using  
their own internal risk models based around short-term developments in 
market prices.33 
Macroprudential Responses
A common response to the crisis and failure of bank regulation has been the 
establishment of new systemic risk committees. Consisting of the wise and 
well-connected, they are tasked with determining if capital adequacy require-
ments should be raised or left untouched.34 Charles Goodhart and I have 
been among those pushing hard for a more macroprudential approach and 
support steps being made in this direction. Of course, there are quite a few 
challenges that come with this emerging approach to macroprudential policy. 
It is another inconvenient truth of financial crises that many central bankers 
had the discretion to tighten lending limits during the boom times and chose 
not to exercise that discretion.35 The collective inability of humanity to escape 
the preoccupations of the present is not easily overcome by anointing a  
special few to do so. A crucial lesson of the crisis is that we need more rules 
to rein in credit growth during a boom. Greater discretion is not required. 
A rule based on bank profitability or credit growth could determine when 
capital requirements are raised during a boom or relaxed during periods of 
financial stress.36 
33The supervisory-approved methodologies were based around “value at risk” models 
that estimated the potential loss a bank may face from recent volatility and correlation 
of market prices. These models are procyclical, with short-term volatility and correlations 
being low during quiet times, encouraging the buildup of risk but spiking sharply higher 
during periods of crisis, dictating a sell-off of risky assets and causing further increases in 
volatility, correlations, and so on. See Avinash Persaud, “The Folly of Value-at-Risk: How 
Modern Risk Management Systems Are Creating Risk” (lecture, Gresham College, London, 
December 2, 2002).
34On December 16, 2010, the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) was established and 
given responsibility for the macroprudential oversight of the EU’s financial system and the 
prevention or mitigation of systemic risk to the financial system. On April 1, 2013, the 
UK established an independent Financial Policy Committee (FPC) at the Bank of England 
charged with a primary objective of identifying, monitoring, and taking action to remove 
or reduce systemic risks with a view to protecting and enhancing the resilience of the UK 
financial system.
35Federal Reserve Chairman, William McChesney Martin, famously said in a speech given 
on October 19, 1955: “The Federal Reserve, as one writer put it, after the recent increase 
in the discount rate, is in the position of the chaperone who has ordered the punch bowl 
removed just when the party was really warming up.”
36Charles Goodhart and Avinash Persaud, “How to Avoid the Next Crash,” Comment 
Page, Financial Times (January 30, 2008). This is a proposal for time-varying capital adequacy 
requirements based on the acceleration in credit growth. An alternative approach focused 
on bank profitability is favored by the Swiss National Bank among others.

I favor rule-based countercyclical capital requirements but they are not  
without complication. An ill-designed approach could lead banks to respond 
by concentrating their lending in the booming sector and away from other 
sectors as the booming sectors are best able to turn a profit even after paying 
higher capital charges. Raised capital requirements could be confined to the 
booming sectors or banks made to lower loan-to-value ratios to ­borrowers 
in those sectors. This might appear inelegant and ad hoc (banks may try 
to get around the definitions of the curbed sector). Banking regulation is 
often ad hoc. Bear in mind that it would be a temporary measure, regularly 
updated in response to the shifting borders of the booming sector. Arguably,  
a macroprudential policy is more about concentrations than aggregates of 
­lending. Capital requirements can rise with increased concentrations of risk on 
a bank’s balance sheet thereby encouraging diversification as well as ­creating 
a capital buffer.37 This is more elegant than simple countercyclical shifts in 
capital requirements and the long-term covariance of credit risks should be 
managed. However, on its own this does not solve the underlying problem. 
Statistical correlations of risk are, like almost everything else, procyclical.  
The same world appears to be a diversified and liquid place in a boom and a 
concentrated, illiquid one in a crash.38 
And the challenges do not end there. There must be a way of reducing capital 
requirements in the postboom era, allowing capital to be released and buffers 
used up. Lowering capital requirements just as people are recognizing that  
the world is a riskier place than they thought is just as difficult to achieve as  
raising them beforehand when the world looks to be a safer place. The politics of  
discretionary countercyclical action is harder than the economics. This 
explains why it is talked about rather than implemented. It emphasises the 
need for a more rule-based approach.39 The rule must be seen as inviolable so 
that in practice it only rarely gets set aside.
Even more challenging is that we would be raising and lowering ratios of 
capital that are themselves based on a fundamentally flawed calculation.  
The current system of bank regulation requires capital to be set aside against 
risk-weighted assets. The more risky the assets, the higher the weight and 
the more capital that must be set aside. This appears elegant and logical. 
Who is against “risk sensitivity”? The statisticians and bank supervisors have, 
37This could be measured by estimating the covariance of the risks the bank is running.

NJ, 2011).

through long use, established this rule as a norm. But that doesn’t make it 
right. If a lender believes a loan is risky—loans are assets for a lender—under 
­normal banking practice this is addressed by requiring additional guarantees 
or ­collateral. The lender is not going to award the loan on the same terms 
as others and just put aside more reserves. They might also lower the loan-
to-value ratio at which they will lend and charge a higher rate of interest. 
Consequently, the expected return, including what is recoverable if the loan 
fails, already takes into account the risks of lending. Capital is needed, then, 
not to ensure the safety of banks if a risky loan fails (already covered by higher 
collateral and reserves funded by higher interest rates charged on risky loans) 
but to protect the bank from a systematic underestimation of risks that over-
whelms these reserves. 
Basing the capital requirement on the original estimation of the riskiness of a 
loan implies that a bank is more likely to underestimate the risk of a loan that 
it already considers risky. The degree of error in risk estimation is propor-
tional with the original estimation of risk. This is unlikely to be the case. Banks 
do not make loans that at the outset they consider risky, and when they do 
these risks are mitigated with collateral requirements. The greatest danger to 
a bank’s ability to survive is if a large proportion of loans that it considers safe 
turn out to be risky. But under the risk-sensitive approach, banks carry least 
capital against their greatest danger: previously considered safe loans turn-
ing risky. This is one of the fundamental flaws of the so-called risk-sensitive 
approach of Base
In Sending the Herd off the Cliff Edge,40 I identified another fundamental flaw. 
By setting capital adequacy requirements against risk estimates, banks are 
encouraged to concentrate lending into areas that statistical measures of the 
past suggest are safe yet offer slightly better returns than other safe areas. 
This concentration pushes the price of these assets up to the point where 
they become overvalued and vulnerable to a mass exit, turning what was safe 
into something risky. In a world of uncertainty, common data sets and com-
mon risk models, the observation of safety creates risk.41 These are interesting 
areas that I would love to discuss more but this book is confined to seeking 
solutions. It is to these solutions that we now turn.
One nod to the challenges previously noted is the reintroduction of the 
­leverage ratio alongside risk-sensitive capital adequacy requirements. This 
limits the amount of lending in aggregate—across seemingly safe and risky

John Eatwell and Murray Millgate flatteringly refer to this as the “Persaud Paradox.”

fascinating study on value-at-risk, The Number That Killed Us: A Story of Modern Banking;

borrowers—relative to capital. It also completely restricts capital to loss-
absorbing assets like cash reserves, shareholder funds, and the like. Of the 
second-best solutions to complicated problems this belt-and-braces approach 
has merit.42 
Another nod to the challenges of the risk-weighted approach to estimat-
ing capital adequacy is regulators’ rising use of “stress tests.” Regulators are  
asking banks to assess the effect of certain specific scenarios—like the fall of 
the price of houses by 40 percent—on their capital buffers. If a bank reports 
that its capital levels fall below the regulators’ threshold level then capital levels 
must be increased. This is more useful conceptually than practically. Banks 
make part of their profit through maturity transformation—borrowing short 
and lending long—so will fail in any scenario in which liquidity disappears for 
a long time. Revealing this potential instability could itself set off a bank run. 
Finance is full of such troublesome dynamics. Consequently, the stress tests 
applied tend to be narrowly short of the kind that all banks would fail. At the 
edge of the permissible, these stress tests end up capturing the degree to 
which a bank’s funding is not dependent on external liquidity conditions. It is 
better to measure and influence that directly rather than indirectly. Reducing 
this funding risk should be the touchstone of endeavors to keep the financial 
system safe.43 With the current approach to macroprudential policy fixated 
on capital, we will be left with a system that is either overly dependent on 
error-prone measurements of risks44 or demands ever more capital. The focus 
should be on risk managing the system, a concept already alluded to and which 
we now give more detailed consideration. 
Risk Managing the Financial System
The GFC settled the debate—for now—on the need for a macropru-
dential dimension to regulatory policy. However, it may have done this with-
out clearly establishing common ground on the meaning of ­“systemic 
risk” and how best to manage its various causes. In the absence of 
­common understanding and a common framework, macroprudential  
42This approach is well described in Anat Admati and Martin Hellwig’s, The Bankers’ New 
Clothes: What’s Wrong with Banking and What to Do About It (Princeton, NJ: Princeton 
University Press, 2014).
43Funding liquidity has receded from the center of attention today. However, 
when the GFC first emerged in 2007 it did so as a crisis in funding liquidity.  
The institutions most in trouble, like Northern Rock, HBOS and Bradford and Bingley  
in the UK, were those that had relied most on the short-term money market funding— 
which dried up—of long-term mortgages.
44Scaling up or down these error prone risk assessments by countercyclical mechanisms 
is unlikely to solve the underlying problem that banks are most harmed by previously 
considered safe assets becoming risky rather than risky assets being risky.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
69
regulation is in danger of reverting to an enhanced microprudential exercise,45 
with ­macroprudential merely meaning that we have a wider set of risks to 
consider and to provide capital against. As the economy slows, perhaps under 
the ­burden of more unproductive capital, the collective amount of risk rises, 
requiring more capital.46 At times, the new capital adequacy regime appears 
more procyclical, and not contracyclical as intended. Many bankers complain 
that lending today, at a time of record-low interest rates and depressed valu-
ations, is being constrained by regulation.47
In financial booms, when liquidity is plentiful, there is a belief that all risks can 
be extracted and measured by the volatility and return of their traded price 
and totted up into a single measure of risk. Banks could then increase or 
lower their activity to match this risk with their risk appetite. This vision of 
risk is convenient for the statistical models used by banks and, partly through 
their influence, colored the approach to risk taken by the Basel bank regula-
tors. But this idea is wholly incorrect. There are many different types of risk 
and their difference means they cannot be tallied together and the aggregate 
amount notched up or down to match a level of capital or risk appetite. From 
a financial regulator’s perspective, the main risks with systemic implications 
are liquidity, credit, and market risks. These risks are different from each other, 
not because we give them different names and describe them differently, as we 
might describe different colors, but because they must be hedged differently. 
It is meaningless to add them together.
The liquidity risk of an asset is the risk that, if forced to sell the asset tomor-
row, a deeply discounted price would be accepted to entice an unwilling buyer 
as compared to the price that might be achieved if there was more time to 
find a buyer. Hedging liquidity risk does not come from owning a diverse 
range of equally illiquid assets but by having the time to sell—perhaps through  
long-term funding or long-term liabilities. I live in a Californian-styled glass 
and steel house that happens to sit in a leafy, Victorian suburb of London. 
Many people find the house fascinating and part of my neighbors’ Sunday 
ritual is to walk their friends past the house, look at it, point at some aspect 
and talk about it. But with its walls of glass, most cannot envisage themselves 
actually living there. If I needed a quick sale I would have to accept a larger 
discount than others who may live in more conventional homes. It is not that 
45I am particularly worried about this being the unintended outcome of the move to the 
European Banking Union. See Avinash Persaud, “Vive la difference,” Guest Article, Economist 
(January 26, 2013).
46There is some research that questions the intuition that more capital means less lending. 
See Thomas Hoenig, “Safe Banks Need Not Mean Slow Economic Growth,” Financial Times 
(August 19, 2013).
47To be fair, bankers are not only referring to capital adequacy requirements when they say 
this, arguing moreover that anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism finance rules also 
make them reluctant to do any new business.

Chapter 5 | How Should We Regulate the Financial System?

the market price is lower but that there is not one singular market price.  
To achieve the highest price requires more time with uncommon and illiquid 
assets. Somewhere in Berlin is an avant-garde couple who want my house but 
I have to wait for them to visit my London suburb before I can sell it. This 
liquidity risk would be major had I funded the house purchase with a three-
month loan that I rolled over every three months, hoping that at the point 
of each of these rollovers, the loan company did not have a change of heart 
about the housing market. It is much less of a risk with a 30-year mortgage. 
The liquidity risk of an asset can be hedged by having long-term funding.
The credit risk of an investment is the risk that a borrower will default on  
its payments of interest and or principal. Credit risk is not hedged by having 
long-term funding because it rises the more time there is for a default or 
some other unforeseen disaster to take place. If, at their birth in 2000, I gave 
my twin boys a gift-wrapped bond issued by one of the high-flying compa-
nies of the day, like Jarvis Construction Company, without the possibility of  
selling it until they were 18, I would have given them something that is a cross 
between an asset and a time bomb. The likelihood that something cataclysmic 
will go wrong at any time during a period of 18 years is bigger than the likeli-
hood that something will go wrong over the next five, or one year, or one 
week, or one day.
If I could sell the bond at any time within the 18 years, it would sharply reduce 
the credit risk. I might have sold it before the Potters Bar rail accident in 
2002 that killed seven people at a time when Jarvis had the rail maintenance 
contract. Unnerved, I might have sold the bond shortly afterward and avoided 
the second rail accident one year later that harmed the company’s reputation. 
I may have sold it when the company dived headlong into debt-backed infra-
structure projects in 2004. I could have sold it a few years later just prior to 
the GFC and avoided the bonds becoming worthless in 2010 as the company 
collapsed under the weight of too much debt in an era of reluctant lenders. 
In an uncertain world time increases credit risk.48 The way to hedge credit 
risk is to spread exposure across a large number of diverse credits, where 
the risk of one borrower not being able to afford interest payments is uncor-
related with another. Combining railway construction and maintenance bonds 
or loans with the credit risk of renewable energy firms, for instance, would 
reduce aggregate credit risk compared to a portfolio of lending to only one 
of these risks.
48This effect of time can be seen in the differential pricing between long and short-dated 
credit default swaps on the same credits.

The market risk of an asset is the risk that its long-run market price will 
fall—like the risk that oil prices will fall on the announcement of a new oil 
­discovery. To hedge market risks requires either diversifying risks across 
time—by ­having long-term funding of those assets to eliminate the need for 
an inopportune time to sell—or across assets or some combination of these 
two activities.
Risk-Absorptive Capacity
Arrayed against these different risks are individuals and firms with characteris-
tics that give them intrinsic capacities for naturally hedging different risk types. 
A long-term pension or life insurance fund, for instance, receiving a regular 
set of contributions or premiums for 20-odd years in return for a lump sum 
payment, has a capacity to absorb liquidity risks, though no particular ability 
to spread credit risks.
The right place for a risk is where there is a capacity to absorb that type of 
risk. One critical advantage of placing risk where it can be best absorbed if 
it erupts is that it becomes less dependent on its size being measured cor-
rectly. Incorrect measurement of risk is at the heart of financial crises and 
something almost all financial market participants succumb to through the 
economic cycle. If risks in the financial system are in the wrong place, then no 
reasonable amount of capital will save the system.
Not only does placing risk where there is a natural capacity to absorb it 
improve the resilience of the financial system, it also makes good investment 
sense. Imagine two pots of identical amounts of savings at the beginning. One 
is invested in a portfolio of blue-chip equities and another in a portfolio of 
government bonds. We return 20 years later. The likelihood that the pot 
invested in equity markets has outperformed the pot in bonds is high.49 But 
this higher long-run return comes with substantially greater short-run volatil-
ity than the investment in bonds. If there is capacity to ignore the short-run 
volatility without suffering from, or having to manage that risk, this is ­nirvana. 
This might be because, for example, it is a pension maturing in 20 years,  
allowing for liquidity-risk and market-risk premiums which give the equity 
portfolio its higher long-run returns. However, not all savers have that luxury 
hence these risk premiums exist.
In a situation that dictates assets be converted into cash at short notice for 
a medical emergency, an investment or allocation to bonds or cash would be 
necessary. A bank that is funded by depositors who can withdraw their funds

without notice does not have the capacity to lock its funds away without 
access and therefore cannot earn the liquidity premium. What it does have 
is the capacity to absorb individual credit risk by virtue of its superior ability 
to spread credit risks across thousands of borrowers. Some may fail to make 
payments on their debts but most will honor their debts and pay interest.  
It can earn the credit risk premium. The safest return for investors is the 
return available for choosing a type of risk that they have a superior capacity 
to absorb.
If all the risks in the financial system were placed where there was the best 
capacity to absorb them, then both the financial system and individual borrow-
ers and savers would be at a Pareto-optimal combination of safety and return. 
This means that more safety is possible but only by reducing returns and more 
return is possible but only by reducing safety. Crucially, this return is higher 
than what is sometimes called the risk-free rate of return, i.e. the return 
on assets with the greatest liquidity and credit quality and least market risk, 
such as short-dated US government bonds. This is therefore not a proposal 
for narrow or repressed forms of finance. The return society can safely earn 
is greater than that approach would allow. It is the risk-free return, plus the 
liquidity premium earned by those with a capacity to earn it, plus the credit 
risk premiums earned by those with a capacity to earn them, plus the market 
risk earned by those with a capacity to earn it.
We need capital for those junctures with a mismatch between risk capacity 
and risks being taken for a variety of possible reasons. This capital require-
ment would not only act as an additional, if expensive, loss absorber, but its 
expense would exploit the power of markets to pursue lower costs to good 
use. It will incentivize good investment practice as investors first match the 
risks they take with their risk capacity. Socially positive innovation is incen-
tivized as investors seek to maximize all of their risk-absorbing capacities. 
Furthermore, this promotes systemically strengthening risk transfers as those 
with credit risks but little absorptive capacity for such risk trade them for 
other risks for which they do have absorptive capacity.
These risk transfers will play the greatest role in reducing systemic risk It is 
critical therefore that this capital regime applies equally across the widest 
definition of the financial sector—from insurance firms to banks to hedge 
funds. In the next chapter we will examine in greater detail how this approach 
would work from the perspective of the non-bank financial sector, like insur-
ance and pensions.
Note how different these risk transfers would be compared to the systemically 
dangerous transfers that contributed to the GFC and which made ring-fencing 
parts of the financial system seem attractive. Risk transfers are motivated by  
a firm’s need to reduce capital requirements. Capital that is available for 
absorbing losses is capital that is not earning returns making it expensive to 
hold. If capital requirements are based on mismatches, risks will be driven to 

Reinventing Financial Regulation
73
where they are best matched. This was not the scenario prior to the GFC.  
As we have discussed earlier, banks were required under Basel1 and 11 to 
hold capital for the credit risks they took but not their liquidity risks. This 
incentivized them to shed credit risk—the one risk they have superior capac-
ity to absorb. It also made them take on liquidity risk which is the very risk 
they have little capacity to hold but for which they had no capital charge  
for holding.
Little that happened during the boom was not incentivized by the regulatory 
regime. Banks sold their liquid credit risks to pension funds and insurance 
companies. Sometimes this occurred directly or via special purpose vehicles 
(SPV). Matters were made worse because banks offered these SPVs a liquidity 
backstop.
The spread of mark-to-market accounting to corporate pension schemes 
and other developments made it tough for these funds and other long-term 
savings institutions to hold illiquid assets, which, by their very nature cannot 
be priced accurately at a high frequency. This is discussed more intensely in 
the next chapter and in Chapter 8. For now we note that these long-term 
savings institutions sold banks the illiquid assets they had a superior ­capacity 
to hold and purchased from the banks liquid credit risks that they had no  
particular advantage in holding. They paid for liquidity they did not need  
and they did so through lower returns. Risk transfers amplified the GFC 
because they went in the exact opposite direction to the matching of risks to 
risk capacity.
How can capital requirements be based on risk mismatches? Risks need to be 
separated on the basis of how they can be hedged. Most risks will be separated 
into liquidity, market, and credit risks. In the case of liquidity risks, pools of illiq-
uid assets can be matched with pools of funding with different maturities. For 
instance, if an institution has raised funds through a 12-month time deposit,50 
this funding could be matched against assets that can easily be turned into 
cash within 12 months. This can include, for instance, bond ­instruments with a 
less than 12-month maturity. Some instruments with longer maturities could 
be classified as being effectively more liquid, perhaps because they are backed 
with liquid collateral or are considered a safe asset in times of stress—such 
as long-term government bonds. Bank supervisors would have to approve the 
classifications.
Risk-absorbing capital would have to be furnished against the liquidity risk of 
less-liquid equities, bonds and loans, unless there are additional longer-term 
pools of funding. Matching the liquidity of pools of assets with pools of funding

74
is easier than trying to do the task asset by asset. It also provides for changes 
in funding and will help to minimize and isolate those liquidity risks that ­cannot 
be easily matched with funding. These unmatched risks could either be sold 
to someone with more longer-term funding (for whom the assets would be 
more valuable) or capital could be put up against them.
Within the banking sector, regulators have taken one step toward this goal 
through the introduction of the net stable funding ratio. The goal is to match a 
bank’s long-term assets with an equal or greater amount of long-term or stable 
funding. This is one of the new regulations that bankers are most ­vehemently 
opposed to, yet from a systemic risk point of view it is one of the most impor-
tant pieces of new regulation. Regulators must not retreat. Of course banks 
can only effectively shed liquidity risks if there is a more appropriate entity to 
hold these risks. It is critical that those with a capacity to hold liquidity risk 
are rewarded for doing so by basing their capital requirements on unmatched 
rather than aggregate risks. Yet, under the noses of the new systemic risk 
committees, the new regulation of insurance and long-term savings institu-
tions looks set to achieve the opposite, through an emphasis on short-term 
valuation and risk that makes little economic sense for them.
The wrong formulation and proposal of the Solvency II regulation for life 
insurance companies and pension funds might force the natural holders 
of the financial system’s liquidity risk to try and avoid it. We take up this 
issue in greater detail in the next chapter. It is worth noting here that forc-
ing long-term institutions to behave like short-term ones will be the big-
gest contributor to systemic risk since the original version of Basel II. It is a 
betrayal of moves toward a more macroprudential approach to ­regulation. 
Macroprudential should partly mean a realization by regulators that the finan-
cial system’s resilience is about where risks reside across the financial and  
economic system as a whole and not just at banks.
In the case of credit risk, capital should be put up against the degree of ­long-run 
diversity of credit risks. A higher concentration would require higher capital, 
rewarding those with more diversified lending and automatically raising ­capital 
requirements as the boom lifts asset prices while it drives up ­covariances. 
Regulators could adjust the amount of capital to be held against liquidity and 
credit risk so that we begin at the same current level of capital but with 
completely changed incentives, ones that could lead to lower capital but  
safer lending.
Conclusion
The central problem we are facing is a collective underestimation of risks 
that leads to the euphoria of the boom and the despair of the inevitable bust. 
This underestimation is often triggered by a new discovery that appears set 
to change the world as we know it. For a while, this perception becomes  

Reinventing Financial Regulation
75
reality as asset prices strengthen and a rising tide lifts all boats. Booms are 
the triumph of optimists. The secondary issue is that resulting from this 
­process market-based measurements are procyclical. At the top of the boom,  
seconds before anarchy descends, market measures of risk are near record 
lows, short-term correlations appear low and bank-capital ratios therefore 
appear to be near record highs. Risk-sensitivity is a bankrupt idea.
We can make the system safe in a way that does not rely on an ability to 
­measure the size of risks. Risk sensitivity must be replaced with the notion 
of risk-absorptive capacity. There are different risks which individuals and 
firms have varying capacities to absorb. If I place a risk where it can be safely 
absorbed were it to erupt then there is no need to be accurate at measuring 
that risk. Capital requirements should be levied on the mismatch between 
risks held and the capacity to hold those risks. This will provide a buffer to 
absorb risks and it will incentivize risks to go to where they can be best 
absorbed and most safely held. The systemic benefits will only be fully realized 
if this approach is extended across the entire financial system and not limited 
to banks.
It would lead to systemically strengthening flows of credit risks to banks from 
life insurers and pension funds and liquidity risks from banks to life insurers 
and pension funds. This is the polar opposite of what occurred prior to the 
GFC. The increasing reliance on measures of risk for markets and valuation in 
banking regulation in the decade prior to the GFC made a procyclical financial 
system even more procyclical. Financial regulation must act as a counterveiling 
force to the financial cycle. It cannot hinge on contemporaneous measures of 
risk and value. Sanity is not statistical.51

Putting the New 
Framework to 
the Test
The Regulation of Life-Insurance and  
Pension Funds
Insurance regulation, often viewed as a dreary backwater by politicians and 
economists, is as critical as the banking sector in promoting financial stabil-
ity, economic growth, and consumer protection. Life insurance and pension 
plans are almost as ubiquitous as mortgages. Their providers hold $50 trillion 
worth of assets worldwide.1 In the last chapter, I argued that financial stability 
is best achieved through a transfer of risk based on the different risk capaci-
ties between short-term funded institutions like banks and long-term funded 
institutions such as life insurers and pensioners. Banking and insurance stabil-
ity are simply different sides of the same coin. To view them as two separate 
endeavors is a grave mistake. The regulation of both banking and insurance 
must be integrated from a systemic risk perspective.

For the moment, we will leave the institutional aspects of integrating banking 
and insurance regulation and return to them in Chapter 13. This chapter takes 
a deeper look at the alternative regulatory framework proposed in Chapter 5 
and peers at it from the perspective of life insurers and pension funds rather 
than just banks. If I expressed frustration in the previous chapter that the 
banking regulation train had left the station in the wrong direction, I would like 
to express urgency here, because at the time of writing the regulation train 
has only just pulled in to the insurance platform. There is still a chance for reg-
ulators to fix what has been proposed before it is too late. Consequently, we 
will also take the opportunity to see how our alternative framework ­differs 
from the current framework of regulation of insurance firms.
Solvency II2 is an EU directive designed to harmonize the regulation of insurers 
and pension funds. However, it has significant extraterritorial reach beyond the 
EU for reasons peculiar to it and to insurance regulation worldwide. Seeking 
greater consumer protection and an improved financial system, the European 
Parliament approved the Solvency II Directive in March 2014. It is slated to 
come into effect on January 1, 2016.3 In its current form, the asset allocation 
that Solvency II imposes on firms will be a disaster. It will be a catastrophe 
for consumers, financial stability, and economic growth. An alternative asset 
allocation, attuned to the risk that the assets of an insurer fall short of its 
obligations as they come due, would correct this problem. Instead we have 
been presented with one that is overly sensitive to the current volatility of 
asset prices.
On paper, Solvency II is not an international standard of insurance regulation, 
like Basel II is for banking supervision. However, Solvency II will easily assume 
as important an international role as Basel II. Its significant extraterritorial 
reach emanates from three separate directions. Since Solvency II is designed 
to cover an insurance company operating across different EU countries, the 
focus of its supervision is set “upward” to the parent company and not down-
ward to the level of the local entity or product. Consequently, the US sub-
sidiary of insurance companies headquartered within the EU, such as Allianz, 
Aviva, ING, and Mapfre, fall within the scope of Solvency II compliance.

Regulation 2015/35.
3Solvency II was initially due to be implemented on January 1st, 2013, but concerns over its 
impact caused that date to be pushed back. Even post-January 1, 2016 its implementation 
will only be phased in.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
79
The EU subsidiary of a non-EU insurance group like MetLife, Canada Life, 
Travellers, or Tokio Marine will also have to comply with Solvency II as stand-
alone entities.4 In a partial attempt to address the reporting, accounting, capi-
tal, and other issues arising from this extraterritoriality, intense international 
efforts are underway. The EU Commission and the US National Association of 
Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), have been meeting to ensure consistency in 
the regulation of EU and non-EU group insurers. US insurers are particularly 
angry about Solvency II’s reach and the prospect of an additional, and in their 
eyes unnecessary, layer of regulation. Although the US insurance market is big-
ger than the EU’s because US insurers are regulated at the state rather than the 
federal level, the EU is the larger insurance jurisdiction. Consequently, obtain-
ing the status of regulatory equivalence in order for there to be only one set 
of regulations, often requires US States and the rest of the world to shoehorn 
their domestic regulation into the requirements of Solvency II.
Separately, in September 2008, prompted by the collapse of US-headquartered 
insurer AIG, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) began efforts to create an inter-
national standard for the regulation of what it considered to be systemically 
important insurance companies.5 This list included a number of non-European 
groups like AIG, MetLife, and Prudential Financial in the United States and  
Ping An Insurance in China.6 However, given the EU countries influence on the 
FSB, the long reach of Solvency II, and the lack of fundamental thinking about 
the nature of insurance companies’ risks, a version of Solvency II has been 
established as the standard to which the FSB holds these firms.
Regulation of banks and insurers has long pivoted around the idea of moving 
firms toward best practice.7 Basel I and II, designed for only the internation-
ally systemically important banks, became the standard for all banks. Deviations 
were considered suspect. Pushed along by extraterritoriality, the pressure for 
equivalence, and the FSB’s initiative, Solvency II, with its approach of “market 
consistent” valuations and risk assessments when calculating capital require-
ments, has become the “best practice” standard in insurance and pension fund 
regulation globally. It is the embodiment of the current approach to insurance 
regulation and the current path regulators are on, the world over.
4There were early concerns that the whole group of a non-EU insurance company with an 
EU subsidiary would have to comply but that is not the case. US and other non-EU groups 
complain that having the EU subsidiary comply with Solvency II as a stand-alone entity, 
with its own capital-adequacy requirement, reduces the scope for its customers to benefit 
from efficiencies in capital management of the larger group.
5Whether insurance companies are systemic in the same way as banks is an interesting 
question but space constraints preclude this from being properly addressed here.
6The FSB has declared the following insurance companies to be globally and systemically 
important: Allianz SE American International Group Inc., Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Aviva 
PLC, Axa SA, MetLife Inc., Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China Ltd., Prudential 
Financial Inc., and Prudential PLC.

What’s Wrong with the Current Approach to 
Insurance Regulation?
Solvency II was developed at the turn of the century and modeled on the 
Basel II Accord, which regulates the supervision of international banks. Both 
documents reflect deep faith in the “marketization of finance”. As discussed 
earlier, this is the idea that markets are better than financial firms and individu-
als at pricing and managing financial risks. This belief in markets, as discussed 
in Chapters 4 and 5, was not limited to regulators but was part of the larger 
zeitgeist of the 1990s and a common conviction in the windward side of finan-
cial booms. Underpinning the marketization of finance were the related beliefs 
that all assets have one price—the price that can be obtained were the asset 
to be sold in the marketplace—and that the riskiness of an asset is the short-
term volatility of this price. Remember that the capital-adequacy regimes 
developed under both Basel II and Solvency II marched in union with the shift 
toward mark-to-market accounting and risk management systems based on 
the volatility of current prices.8 These ideas followed the capital asset-pricing 
model popular with mutual funds investing in continuously trading markets.
The majority of assets in the world, such as property, infrastructure, and 
human capital, are not continuously traded. Yet many regulators saw their task 
as shining a bright light on the dark world of insurers and pension funds buying 
unlisted and untraded investments. They sought to create a brave new world 
where life insurers would hold assets that everyone could price and assess the 
risk of in the same way. Prior to the GFC, there were many perceived benefits 
to such an approach, including creating fraud-busting transparency, leveling 
playing fields, and the imposition of market discipline. Some of the frauds I 
discussed in earlier chapters brought these issues to greater prominence in 
the past than they may be today. Investment banks also fancied this approach 
as it opened up an entirely new universe of financial innovation where risks 
and balance sheets could be sliced and traded.9
Solvency II’s solvency capital requirement is made up of a series of capital 
requirements for the risk of different activities, including, insurance, counter-
party and investment risk. In the last quantitative impact assessment reported 
by the European Insurance and Occupational Pension Authority (EIOPA), 
capital for the market risk of investments constituted the largest component 
of life insurers’ capital requirements under the new Solvency II proposals. 
8Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Daily-Earnings-At-Risk (DEAR) are examples of these risk 
management approaches.
9It was not simply good luck for investment banks that regulators adopted this approach. 
They had a strong hand in making the case. See Avinash Persaud, “Banks Put Themselves 
at Risk in Basle,” Financial Times, October 16, 2003.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
81
Solvency II requires firms to set aside an amount of capital for market risk that 
would offset a fall in asset values over one year of a size so large that it would 
only occur once every two hundred years.
With equities quoted on an EEA10 or OECD exchange, the standard for-
mula of Solvency II requires capital provision for a 39 percent fall in prices. 
For other equities like emerging-market equities or developed-country pri-
vate equity, it requires provision for a 49 percent11 fall. There are adjustments 
to take account of the financial cycle, the tax effects of insurance loss, and 
the risk-absorptive aspects of some technical-insurance provisions. However, 
according to quantitative-impact assessments, insurers would still need to put 
up capital in the order of 23 percent–28 percent of the value of equity hold-
ings. By comparison they are only required to put up 3.0 percent of the value 
of a 10-year A-rated corporate bond or 2.1% of the value of an EU govern-
ment debt instrument with an A rating. Preparation for Solvency II and previ-
ous regulatory preferences have already pushed insurers’ holdings of equity 
and property down to half of what they were in the 1990s. However, despite 
being just 12 percent of all of their holdings today,12 these holdings will still 
account for 37 percent of life insurers’ capital-adequacy requirements under 
Solvency II.13
Parallel with Basel II, large insurance companies may adopt regulatory-
approved internal risk models beyond these standardized specifications. But 
these models are not a license to deviate from the central treatment of risk as 
a once-in-a-two-hundred-year annual fall in asset prices. It is merely a license 
to extend this approach to asset classes not yet considered by the regulators 
in the standard formula. Following a series of quantitative-impact assessments 
and simulations, it is widely accepted that, as a result of the disproportionate 
impact on their after-capital-charge returns, Solvency II will lead to a switch 
out of public and private equity, infrastructure bonds, property, and low-rated 
corporate bonds.14 Regulators do this in the name of protecting consumers

14Even before the most recent quantitative-impact assessment in 2014, the Economist 
Intelligence Unit Report for BlackRock conducted a survey looking at 223 insurers with 
European operations, finding that 97 percent of insurers agree that the equity-risk premium 
would have to rise to justify them investing in equities given the new capital charges. Ninety 
one percent agree with the idea that share prices will be lower as a result of Solvency II,  
and 91 percent agree that corporations will respond by switching from equity to debt 
issuance. For a simulation exercise on the impact of Solvency II on insurers’ investments,

Investments (Ghent, Belgium:  Vlerick Centre for Financial Services, September 2014).

from insolvent insurers. Yet it is actually not in the interests of consumers 
of long-term insurance or pension products and has other, wider, adverse 
consequences for financial stability and economic growth. It is hardly in the 
insurer’s interest to annoy their regulator, or even to worry about systemic 
risk. However some insurance CEOs have seen fit to draw attention to the 
likely negative impact on infrastructure financing in both private and public 
remarks.15
The architects of Solvency II describe their framework as being risk sensitive 
and adhering to market-consistent valuations. These terms sound so terribly 
sophisticated and self-evidently sensible that the underlying thinking behind 
Solvency II is afforded scant scrutiny. After all none would instead insist on 
being risk insensitive or market inconsistent. Yet this framework rests on a 
fundamentally flawed view of the investment risk of a life insurer or pension 
fund. The riskiness of the assets of a life insurer or pension fund with liabilities 
that will not materialize before ten, even twenty years, is improperly measured 
by a once-in-a-two-hundred-year drop in prices on a one-year basis. The capi-
tal asset-pricing model fails to take into account that institutions with different 
liabilities have different capacities for absorbing different risks.
Of course not all insurers have long-term liabilities. Casualty insurers, like 
those who write motor or health insurance policies, have potentially short-
term liabilities. However, in Europe and elsewhere, 80 percent of the assets 
held by insurers are held by life insurers.16 The regulatory-induced reduction 
in the holdings of long-term investments by long-term savings institutions will 
lead to a fall in returns to and a rise in risks taken by consumers. It will reduce 
the risk-absorptive capacity of the financial system, making it less resilient. 
Anticipation of Solvency II and other regulatory and accounting pressures has 
already reduced their equities holdings but today insurers and pension funds 
still hold approximately 15–20 percent of equities in developed markets.17 The 
arrival of Solvency II will accelerate this trend of equity disposals and increase 
the cost of long-term investment by companies, in turn leading to a stunting 
of economic growth. To understand fully why it is not in the interests of con-
sumers, the financial system, and the economy for life insurers and pension 
funds to eschew long-term assets like equities, we must do a quick rehersal of 
the fundamental principles of risk capacity introduced in Chapter 5. We will 
then apply these principles to the assets of a life insurer or pension fund with 
20-year liabilities.
15On August 14, 2013, the UK’s Independent newspaper, quoted Mr. Tidjane Thiam, then 
CEO of Prudential Insurance of the UK, as saying that “the proposed Solvency II regime 
could prevent insurers from investing in infrastructure and property . . . costing the UK jobs 
and growth.”

The Fundamental Principles of Investment Risk
The risk free rate of return is that available from taking no risk—such as cash 
in a bank with a US government deposit guarantee. An investment return over 
and above the risk-free rate of return can only be obtained by taking an invest-
ment risk. Different potential returns are earned by taking different risks. The 
main investment risks are credit, liquidity, and market risk. For example, if an 
investor in a US corporate bond made a 7 percent return over a year, this 
return is composed of:
	1.	 The risk-free rate (the return available on cash); plus
	2.	 The return from taking a credit risk (the risk that the 
issuer of the bond will go bust over the year); plus
	3.	 A liquidity risk (the risk that the holder of the bond will 
have to accept a lower price if he has to sell it quickly and 
cannot wait to find a more interested buyer); plus
	4.	 A return for taking a market risk (the risk that the price of 
the bond falls because the market value of the cash flow 
declines, perhaps as a result of rising US interest rates).
Investment risks are categorized into credit, liquidity and market risks because 
they are fundamentally different rather than as a matter of convenience. The 
test of this difference is that if an investor did not want to take one of these 
risks, each of these three risks that she did not want to take would have to be 
hedged18 differently.
How to Hedge Different Investment Risks
Hedging credit risks is done through diversification. For example, to spread 
the credit risk of holding a General Motors bond, it can be held within a port-
folio of bonds issued by its main competitors, like Chrysler and Toyota, who 
might sell more cars if GM were to get into trouble. It could also be held with 
bonds issued by companies whose success may come at the expense of all tra-
ditional car companies—like Telsa, an electric-car maker; BP, an oil company; 
Bombardier, a manufacturer of high-speed trains; or Microsoft, the owner of 
Skype, favored by telecommuters.
18Hedging of risks means neutralizing or offsetting them so that they no longer have 
impact. Individuals often hedge risks, like the risk of a motor accident, by buying insurance 
against that risk.

Chapter 6 | Putting the New Framework to the Test
84
Liquidity risks are best hedged by having time to sell. An illiquid asset is one 
whose price falls below what could otherwise be obtained if there was more 
time to find a suitable buyer. My glass-and-steel house in a row of Victorian 
terraces in London will only appeal to a narrow band of buyers. If I was forced 
to sell tomorrow, it would fetch a far-lower price than if I could wait for that 
person with similar taste to find it. One way to create more time to hedge this 
liquidity risk is to finance the asset with a long-term mortgage. In general, the 
more time you have to wait for a suitable buyer, the less liquidity risk you carry.
Market risks are hedged through a combination of diversification across 
uncorrelated market risks and with time to allow for panic, uncertainty, or 
stretched valuations to unwind.
What is clear is that liquidity risks and credit risks are hedged in distinctly 
different ways. Time hedges liquidity risk, but more time in which a shock can 
arrive and a company can go bust increases credit risk. There is little uncer-
tainty and credit risk in holding a General Motors bond for one day but much 
more if it is not sold for 20 years. Diversification across similarly sized but dif-
ferently correlated credit risks reduces aggregate credit risk. However, diver-
sifying across equally illiquid assets does not reduce liquidity risks. Credit and 
liquidity risks are different and cannot be meaningfully added up or sliced and 
mixed together despite the best efforts of former Russian nuclear physicicsts 
working at US investment banks at the turn of the century or anybody else.
Different Capacities to Hedge Different Risks
Financial firms or individuals have a natural capacity to hedge one or more 
types of risk. A bank with thousands of borrowers in different economic sec-
tors has an innate capacity to diversify its credit risk. It can get paid for taking 
credit risks and self-insure against these risks through diversification. That 
is the real business model of banks. However, a bank with loans funded by 
cash deposits or money market funds that can be withdrawn overnight, has 
a limited natural capacity to hedge liquidity and market risks. Ideally such a 
bank should earn its credit-risk premium by lending to a diversified group of 
borrowers and it should charge a goodly sum that covers the cost of trans-
ferring its portfolio of market and liquidity risks to someone else who can 
hedge these risks more cheaply. A contributory factor to the GFC was that 
risk transfers went in the opposite direction to this ideal. Regulatory capi-
tal charges on credit risks but not liquidity risks incentivized banks to sell 
credit risks and buy liquidity risks. For example, where banks sold credit risks 
through a special purpose vehicle, they often sweetened the deal with a liquid-
ity backstop—an agreement to buy back the assets.

as the price of Lehman’s illiquid credit assets plunged below its liabilities.19 
However (and not without irony), the longer the administrators took to 
unpick the complexity of the banks’ assets and liabilities, the further the prices 
of those assets recovered. Seven years later, the administrators of the UK 
operation were able to announce that they had recouped all of the cash owed 
to secured and unsecured creditors. Despite their own enormous bill, a mod-
est surplus was left.20 Illiquidity played a major role in the last banking crisis 
just as it had in many before.
A life insurer or young pension fund with a likely concentration of payouts in 
20 years time has a natural capacity to take liquidity and market risks and earn 
the associated risk premia. It does not have a natural capacity to hold credit 
risk.21 Imagine two different portfolios of assets with the same expected 
return over the next 12 months. The first is a package of poor, but highly 
diversified and liquid credit risks, listed and traded frequently on an exchange. 
The second is a portfolio of government-guaranteed loans that cannot be sold 
on without a lengthy permission process. This second instrument has low 
credit but high liquidity risks. Imagine, too, that the investment strategy of the 
life insurer is to lock away the two portfolios in a safe and only open it when a 
life-insurance payout in made in 20 years. While the average return maybe the 
same, the distribution of outcomes of these two portfolios change with time. 
There is a higher likelihood that the first portfolio with poor credits under-
performs the second portfolio with poor liquidity because over a significant 
time period one of the credits in the portfolio of poor credit risks will have 
gone bust. The longer the period, the greater the probability of this outcome.
The Challenge for Long-Term Investors Is Short-Fall 
Risk, Not Short-Term Volatility
The risk that matters to the life insurer or pension fund is the risk of a shortfall 
in the return of the asset when they need it. If they have a liability in 20 years, 
taking a liquidity risk during the first 10 years does not engender a shortfall, 
but taking credit risks during that time does. Shortfall risk is different and

not well reflected, if at all, in the daily, monthly, or even annual volatility of the 
price of the asset. The capital-asset pricing model is not designed for someone 
facing shortfall risk in 20 years but rather for the investor who may have to 
liquidate her assets in the short term. Assets with low annual volatility, but 
where the risk of a loss rises over time, or cannot be reduced with time, may 
pose greater shortfall risk for a long-term investor than assets that exhibit 
high annual volatility but with risks that fall over time. The same amount of 
cash invested in a diversified portfolio of liquid credit risks may have a lower 
annual volatility but a higher risk of failing to achieve the investment objective 
after 20 years than a diversified portfolio of illiquid private-equity assets. From 
a life insurer or pension fund’s perspective, Solvency II gets the notion of risk 
completely muddled.
The best strategy for investors is to first hold the risks that they have a natural 
ability to hedge and sell the ones they cannot hedge to those who can. The 
risk inherent in a particular asset is not the same for everyone at all times. 
Risk is contingent on who owns it and for what purpose. To satisfy a hunger 
for investment returns, begin by eating the free lunch on offer and understand 
that all subsequent lunches come with a bill. This may seem obvious, but 
Solvency II actually generates the opposite behavior.
The S&P 500, Life Insurers, Pension Funds,  
and Solvency II
The investment principles discussed can be tested by examining the risks 
faced by a US subsidiary of a European life insurance firm when holding the 
components of the S&P 500 Index of large, liquid US stocks. Since 1928, the 
S&P 500 Index has boasted an average return significantly above the risk-free 
rate of US government T-bills or the riskier 10-year Treasury bonds.22 The 
credit and liquidity risks of this index23 are small so this extra return is likely 
compensation for market risk. Recall that market risk is hedged by both time 
and diversification. The longer the time period over which the S&P 500 stock 
portfolio is held and the more the market risk is spread, the greater the prob-
ability that returns at the end of the period will be positive and the shortfall 
risk reduced. Let us examine how this has played out in the past.
22Although the S&P 500 is estimated back to 1928, the original index started form in 1928 
as the S&P 90 until 1957 when it became the S&P 500.
23This is through the futures market. Futures in the S&P 500 (as opposed to funds that hold 
the component shares) are one of the most liquid financial instruments.

87
Over the last 22 years, the average daily return of the S&P 500 has been 0.03 
percent.24 While this is more than double the average daily return of three-
month US T-bills, this figure is not properly representative of the distribu-
tion of daily returns. Forty-eight percent of daily returns were negative. Six 
percent of daily returns were more than two standard deviations south of 
zero25—reflecting a “fat-tailed” distribution where the likelihood of extreme 
outcomes is greater than a normal distribution.26 A money market fund or 
casualty insurer that may have to liquidate assets on short notice has no time 
to spread this size of market risk. The additional return for that investor from 
owning the S&P versus T-bills is not a free lunch. It comes with a significant 
increase in shortfall risk.
Over the past 86 years, the average annual return of the S&P 500 has been  
12 percent which is no less than the daily return annualised.27 However, the 
risk or distribution of these annual returns is meaningfully different than for 
daily returns. Only 29 percent of annual returns were negative versus 48 per-
cent of daily returns. A mere 3 percent of annual returns were more than two 
standard deviations below zero versus 6 percent of daily returns. The distribu-
tion of returns is less fat tailed and significantly shifted into positive territory.
Since 1928, the average cumulative return over discrete 10 year periods has 
been 196 percent. Each of the 10-year periods except for 1928–1938 was 
positive. Although this single losing decade included the 1929 Great Crash, the 
Great Depression, and the 1937 stock market collapse, the loss over ten years 
was only 6 percent.28 Similarly, only 7 percent of the 76 overlapping 10 year 
periods since 1928 have been negative. This confirms the earlier proposition 
that liquidity and market risks fall with time. The shortfall risk for an investor 
with long-term liabilities is lowered by holding assets with low credit risks but 
high market and liquidity risks.
The picture is stronger still if we look at 20 year time spans—though there 
are only a few of these discrete periods. The average return is 583 percent, or 
370 percent if you remove 1938–1958 on the grounds that the rebound from 
the Great Depression to postwar euphoria is unlikely to be repeated. None 
of the four discrete 20 year spans or even the 66 overlapping 20 year periods 
24Data was provided by CLSA Ltd.
25Standard deviation is a measure of the distribution of outcomes. In a normal distribution—
one that looks like a bell jar—68.3 percent of outcomes are within one standard deviation 
from the mean, 95.5 percent of outcomes are within two standard deviations from it, and 
99.7 percent of outcomes are within three.

ten year period was greater than zero but this highlights my point that more time reduces

have been negative.29 There have not been any negative returns either from 
investing in 10-year Treasury bonds over the same 20 year spans. However, 
the average 20-year return for 10-year US government bonds has been much 
lower than for equities at 165 percent (or 120 percent if you remove the best 
decade, 1988–2008, on the grounds that the great disinflation is unlikely to be 
repeated from here).
When considering the shortfall risk of assets backing long-term liabilities such 
as life insurance and pensions, we should consider the impact of inflation on 
long-term returns. Over 20 years even modest rates of inflation can seriously 
erode the purchasing power of a pension. Consumers are more concerned 
with the real value30 of a future pension or life-insurance payout than they are 
with its nominal value. If we were to consider real returns over 10 or 20 year 
holding periods, equities might be safer and more rewarding than government 
securities. Since 1928, the average real 10-year cumulative return on equities 
has been 113 percent with only one decade from 1968 to 1978 of negative 
real returns of –17 percent. Over the same span, the average real 10-year 
cumulative return on US government bonds has been 29 percent—just one 
quarter of the real equity return —with two decades of negative performance 
when they were –13.7 percent (1938–1948) and –3 percent (1968–1978).31 
There have only been nine discrete 10 year terms since 1928, but, if we con-
sider overlapping 10 year windows, equities have had a positive real return 89 
percent of the time and US government bonds only 66 percent of the time.
Now recall that under Solvency II, life insurers are required to hold capital of 
up to 24 to 28 percent of the value of an equity portfolio and little or no capi-
tal for holding a government-bond portfolio that prior to the European credit 
crisis might have contained Greek and Cypriot bonds. Unlike a money market 
fund, a life insurance or young pension fund (with a high probable concentra-
tion of payouts in twenty years' time and a low probability of payouts in the 
short term) does not need to liquidate the vast majority of its portfolio in the 
short term. It can earn the substantial market-risk and liquidity-risk premia 
available in moving from bonds to equities without substantially increasing 
shortfall risk. If we consider inflation, there may well be an increase in real 
returns with no increase in short-fall risk at all from the switch.
29Even the harrowing period in the stock market from 1929 to 1948 is positive once 
dividends are reinvested. Today, in the US, where dividends are becoming a rarity, the 
importance of dividends on equity returns in the past is often forgotten.

Consumer Protection
When presented with the theory of investment risk as argued, some regula-
tors have pleaded that it is better to be safe from a practical perspective than 
waylaid by fanciful theories. John Maynard Keynes once said that practical 
men who believe themselves exempt from any intellectual influence are usu-
ally slaves of some defunct economist. In this case, they are the slaves of a 
defunct financial theory that equates all financial risk to annual value-at-risk 
estimates—an idea that proved wholly inadequate during the last crisis.32 Even 
worse, here playing it safe means shifting risk to those least able to bear it—
the consumers of insurance and pensions.
The wider consequence of forcing life insurers and pension funds to hold liquid 
assets when they do not need liquidity is that the same amount of life insurance 
or pension is then more expensive for consumers to buy. Insurance is a luxury 
rather than a necessary good. Its consumption rises with income. If we add that 
most ordinary consumers are liquidity-constrained, should the same amount 
of future life insurance or pension costs more today, the average consumer will 
buy less rather than sacrifice the grocery bill. They are likely to be less insured. 
Solvency II is shifting risk from those most able to manage and bear it—insti-
tutions with full-time professionals that pool and spread risks—to those least 
able to manage and bear it. Although this book is focused on systemic risks, 
there are deep connections between systemic risks and consumer protection 
and this is but one example of where getting systemic risks wrong, often in the 
name of consumer protection, can harm consumers indirectly.
Regulators are not only pushing life insurers into an asset class with generally 
lower returns they are doing so at a time when the outlook for long-term 
bond returns is particularly skewed to the downside. Near-zero interest rates, 
modest economic growth, postcrash risk aversion, geopolitical uncertainty, 
and a massive central bank bond-buying program have all pinned bond prices 
to the ceiling. A whole constellation of stars will have to be correctly aligned 
if prices were not to fall sharply. Basel II capital-adequacy rules helped push 
banks into excessive mortgage risk. Today, Solvency II is leading consumers of 
insurance companies like lambs to a slaughter.
Systemic Risks
It is right from an investment perspective for life insurers or young pen-
sion funds to hold good-quality credits with high liquidity and market 
risks–like diversified portfolios of government-backed infrastructure bonds,  
32See Avinash Persaud, “Market Liquidity and Risk Management” in Liquidity Black Holes: 
Understanding, Managing and Quantifying Financial Liquidity Risk (London: Risk Books, 2002).

Chapter 6 | Putting the New Framework to the Test
90
asset-backed securities or public and private equity. It is also correct from the 
perspective of the insurance buyer who gets more coverage for a given pre-
mium. And it is proper too from a systemic-risk perspective. If these market 
and illiquid risks were held by short-term investors, like money market funds, 
hedge funds, or banks, there would be phases of steep, self-feeding declines in 
asset prices as all investors try to offload the same assets simultaneously when-
ever liquidity or market conditions went south. Doing so pushes up short-term 
volatility and reported risk, promoting more sales and price declines. Putting 
long-term risks in fast hands will make the financial system more fragile.
The life insurer or pension fund unpeturbed by short-term volatility would 
be the ideal counterparty for a bank wanting to sell a package of market and 
liquidity risks where the bank retains the credit risks. There are clear individ-
ual and systemic benefits of this type of risk transfer. Too often in the past, the 
precise opposite risk transfer took place because transfers were not driven 
by where the greatest risk capacity was to be found but where the lowest 
regulatory-capital charges were. Life insurers were seduced by the low capital 
charges incurred when buying packages of securitized credit risks with high 
credit ratings. AIG, the insurer, did so in bankruptcy-inducing proportions, but 
other insurers were also guilty of similar conduct if on a more modest scale.33
Arguably, there is no reasonable amount of capital that could bring safety to 
a financial system if risks are held in all the wrong places. We are doomed to 
failure if all the liquidity risks are held by those with no liquidity and all the 
credit risks are held by those who cannot diversify them. From a regulatory 
perspective, risk capacity is a more critical concept than the “market con-
sistent valuations” and “risk sensitivity.” It is a grave disappointment that it 
remains largely neglected by regulators.
Economic Growth
Critical to any economic growth is investment. We need capital expenditure 
on laying fiber-optic cables; launching communication satellites; and building 
airport, train, and road networks. All else being equal, the lower the cost of 
capital, the higher the level of investment. Investment assets tend to have long 
development times as well as being large and not easily divisible. Half a train 
station is not as easy to sell as a completed one. These projects carry huge 
liquidity and market risks. The funding costs would be lower if they were 
financed by those with a natural capacity for taking liquidity and market risks 
33We all tend to fight the last war and avoiding a repeat of AIG has been a strong 
motivation for insurance regulators in recent years. But, arguably, AIG was a special case 
of an institution acting like a bank while in an insurer’s clothes and could be dealt with 
more specifically.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
91
such as the life insurers and pension funds. If these natural buyers of long-term 
assets are denied the ability to do so, then the cost of capital will be higher 
than it would otherwise be with the resulting effect of lowering investment 
and economic growth.
The degree to which investment would be lower than it could otherwise be 
depends on the amount of long-term savings versus short-term savings and the 
degree to which short-term savers can substitute for long-term savers in holding 
long-term assets. In Europe, life insurers and pension funds own approximately 
€10 trillion of assets, or more than half of EU GDP or half of all institutionally 
owned assets. If Solvency II did not get in the way, a life insurer with 20-year 
liabilities would always be able to outbid a hedge fund that offers near-immediate 
liquidity to its investors because the insurer does not need to find a costly hedge 
for the liquidity risks. These are not easily substitutable investors. Consequently, 
investment will suffer at a time Europe can least afford for it to do so.
What Is to Be Done?
The fundamental principles of risk capacity previously discussed point to a dif-
ferent but straightforward approach to the solvency-capital requirement. It is 
an approach that reflects the risk that the investment will fall short of what is  
required. The shortfall risk of an asset is not independent of the liability it is up 
against but rather is intrinsically linked to it. If the liability is an expected pay-
out of €100,000 in 10 years and the asset is a monthly investment in a basket 
of public equities, by using past data on the 10-year returns of the asset, we 
can estimate the likelihood that the investment will fail to achieve the payout. 
Capital requirements would be sized to offset this risk.
This would imply very different capital requirements from those of Solvency 
II. For instance, consider a firm with long-term liabilities. The capital to be 
set against a diversified portfolio of blue-chip equities might be less than for 
a portfolio of long-term, liquid bonds that carry the same expected annual 
return. This need not be done one liability at a time. It can be done with buck-
ets of similar liabilities and buckets of assets matched against them. Where the 
shortfall risk is greater than, say, 0.5 percent, the insurer would be required 
to reduce it by raising the level of the premium, changing the asset class, or 
raising the level of capital.
Conclusion
To consider the risk of a life-insurance and pension fund as being well mea-
sured using an estimated once-in-two-hundred-year decline in annual asset 
prices is fundamentally flawed. The return and price of assets already reflects 
a measure of the asset risk to the average holder. Consequently, the starting 

Chapter 6 | Putting the New Framework to the Test
92
point for the regulator ought to be whether the risks to life insurers or pen-
sion funds from holding an asset are lower or higher than already reflected 
in the market price. In both this chapter and the last we have shown that this 
relates to what the asset is being used for and by whom. Market-consistent 
valuations sound sensible but are not a desirable objective across individuals 
or firms with different liabilities. Private-equity funds are a risky investment 
for a casualty insurer to hold but safer for a life insurer with liabilities beyond 
the redemption period of the fund. To the life insurer, it matters not what the 
price of assets and the risk of holding those assets is tomorrow or at year end. 
Their main concern is the risk that their investment return falls short of what 
is required when it is required: shortfall risk.
The consequence of properly matching risk taking with risk capacity is that 
insurers, consumers, the wider financial system, and the economy will be able 
to move to a superior risk-return point. If Solvency II were to appropriately 
set solvency-capital requirements for investments around the shortfall risk of 
holding certain assets against certain liabilities, consumers would have cheaper 
but equally adequate insurance. The financial system would be safer as risks 
flowed to where they were best spread or diversified, and the resulting lower 
cost of capital would boost investment and economic growth. Nothing stops 
us traveling in this direction but ourselves. Regrettably, in its current form, the 
proposed capital regime in Solvency II will take us the opposite way.

C h a p t e r 
Protecting 
Consumers
My principal objective in writing this book has been to correct a fallacy of 
composition, namely that the current regulatory route has made individual 
firms safe but in so doing has actually increased the whole financial system’s 
fragility. Casualties among ordinary consumers in a systemic crash are high. 
If we can make the system safer, this should give them greater protection. 
Often, proposals presented as making the system safer are really about better 
consumer protection. Examples of these include measures that encourage 
or ban certain instruments, the choice of discouraging bad behavior through 
either civil or criminal law, and the rearrangement of regulatory institutions.  
I address these questions over the next few chapters.
Even in a safe system individual firms can and will fail and individual consum-
ers can and will fall victim to wrongdoing. In this chapter, I focus on those 
aspects of consumer protection that are independent from systemic risk con-
cerns. Those only interested in new ideas on systemic risks may wish to skip  
this chapter.
In a departure from the rest of this book, I do not assert that there needs 
to be a complete reinvention of existing regulation when it comes to con-
sumer protection. The current regime is inadequate but not heading in the 
wrong direction or unhelpful. My aim is to offer thoughts on how we can 
push beyond the existing regulations. The framework of consumer protection  
I present mirrors my approach to systemic safety—particularly in applying 
the risk capacity concept used with regards to banks in Chapter 5 and insur-
ers in Chapter 6. Readers may be interested to see how far this idea can be 
extended, in this case to ordinary consumers. Let us begin by briefly reminding 
ourselves why consumers in the financial industry need extra protection.

Why Do Financial Consumers Need More 
Protection Than Other Consumers?
In most industries, consumers make repeat purchases. They can quickly iden-
tify inferior quality and easily take their business elsewhere. Purchasing an 
unsatisfactory product does not incapacitate them. Consequently, purveyors 
of consistently sour orange juice go out of business and consumers expect 
the remaining providers to offer a tried and tested product. Market incentives 
generally work in the interests of consumers. When markets fail, product 
liability laws step in to protect consumers’ rights and enforce the responsibili-
ties of sellers and producers. Public and private consumer advisory and infor-
mation bodies can also facilitate optimum protection of consumers’ interests.1
Buying financial products is completely different. We do not shop for and 
change our mortgages, life insurance, pensions, and car loans on a weekly 
basis. These are products that you have for a long time, sometimes a life-
time. A savings instrument, like an endowment policy, can run for more than 
twenty years. It can take years to realize you have bought a lemon2 by which 
time the original seller may no longer exist, leaving you without a remedy 
to correct the situation. The consequences of buying an inadequate pen-
sion or a too-costly mortgage can be catastrophic—including old-age pen-
ury and even homelessness. The plight of those holding subprime mortgages 
in the United States will still be fresh in the minds of readers. In Australia, 
the collapse of HIH Insurance in March 2001, with losses of approximately 
A$5.3 billion,3 affected over one million policyholders. It left an estimated 
50,000 people facing severe financial difficulties. Many were the seriously ill 
with income protection policies, car accident victims, and those with defec-
tive homes. British readers will recall the disastrous end of the world’s old-
est mutual insurer, the Equitable Life Assurance Society, which was closed 
to new business in December 2000. Its near 1.5 million members suffered a  
£4 billion loss, ameliorated somewhat when the UK Government stepped in 
with £1.5 billion in compensation a decade later. Similarly, when the Executive

Life Insurance Company, California’s largest life insurance firm, went bust

policies would have lost everything had the US Government not taken over 
the ­company’s liabilities.
The average buyer of retail financial products does so only a couple of times 
during a lifetime. He has significantly less expert knowledge than sellers 
engaged with these products daily. This particular asymmetry of information 
and opportunity, in favor of the seller, makes it possible to beguile the inexpe-
rienced buyer into decisions that really only advantage the seller rather than 
the buyer.4 The miscellany of conflicts of interest and abuse of asymmetrical 
information includes excessive commissions and bonus payments for push-
ing clients into particular products regardless of the suitability.5 Such con-
flicts of interest were thrust into the limelight during the 1980s and 1990s, 
coinciding with the Thatcher and Reagan administrations of the 1980s and 
their later imitators. On both sides of the Atlantic, the government priva-
tized state assets thus creating a new supply of private assets. It pulled back 
from state-sponsored social insurance which led to a new demand for these 
assets. Deregulated financial intermediaries were paid to bring the supply and 
demand sides together.6 In the process, a financial institution’s traditional fidu-
ciary obligation to look after its client’s interests swirled in ever-increasing 
conflict with other interests.7 Asymmetrical information and conflicts of inter-
est are the most common and often the worst instances of consumer abuse. 
But they did not first come ashore with the deregulating governments of the 
1980s. While the scale may have increased, there is a long history of con-
sumers being swindled by purveyors of financial products as far back as the 
Mississippi and South Sea bubbles of 1719–208 and no doubt before.

Journal of Economics 84, no. 3 (1970), pp. 488–500.

The Elements of Modern Consumer 
Protection
The main elements of consumer protection have been constant for the last 30 
years and approximate to a philosophy of individual responsibility. Consumers 
are free to make their own choices. However, especially for nonexperts in 
finance, choices should be free of undue pressure and made from an informed 
position. One critical element of this philosophy is the distinction between 
“vulnerable” consumers requiring extra advice, information, and protection 
and others who may be assumed to have the expertise and resources to look 
after themselves. This general approach could be characterized as “caveat 
emptor” rather than “caveat vendor.”9
A critical issue in practice is defining who constitutes a vulnerable con-
sumer. They are deemed a broader group than those in a home for the 
bewildered. The term includes people who could lose their livelihoods 
by buying something they do not understand. In some jurisdictions it also 
includes those deemed politically vulnerable—such as minority consumers.10 
Strict regulation exists regarding not so much what but how financial prod-
ucts are sold to vulnerable consumers. For instance, there are many juris-
dictions that have regulations about the information that must be disclosed 
in a contract and understood by the purchaser. There are also often rules 
concerning which messages must be avoided in advertisements so as not to 
give a false impression of less risk or greater virtue ­inherent to a particular 
financial product. A popular approach taken by independent financial advi-
sors is to ask ordinary consumers what their risk appetite is, and, based on 
the response, to steer them toward certain types of instruments and away  
from others.
9While the principle of caveat emptor, Latin for “buyer beware”, gives responsibility 
to buyers, it does not mean that sellers are beyond reproach. This concept is neatly 
encapsulated in the following extract from the Bank of England’s Fair and Effective Markets 
Review (London: Bank of England, 2014, p. 17):
“[Caveat emptor] . . . has always been subject to the general law on fraud and misrepresen-
tation, which has long been relatively strict, embodying the principle that (in the words of 
a Victorian judge, Lord Macnaghten in Gluckstein vs. Barnes [1900] AC 240) ‘sometimes 
half a truth is no better than a downright falsehood’. And over the years the practical 
application of the caveat emptor principle has been further qualified by judicial and statu-
tory intervention (for example on implied terms), by disclosure and other provisions of 
consumer law, and, in the context of investment transactions, by statutory and regulatory 
rules. For example, caveat emptor does not trump the regulatory obligation on a firm to 
act ‘honestly, fairly and professionally.’ Market manipulation cannot therefore be said to be 
consistent with caveat emptor, even where it takes place between two counterparties of 
broadly equal bargaining power and sophistication.”
10Vendors are required not to discriminate against vulnerable consumers, which can 
sometimes rub against the need to give this group additional care.

Incidentally, most governments insure cash deposits at banks but only up to 
a level designed to cover the cash savings of the vulnerable and less well off. 
This limit tends to be raised in a crisis and languishes at forgotten levels during 
the good times.11
Another key element of modern consumer protection concerns conflicts of 
interest between producers or sellers of financial products and those who advise 
buyers. Initially, only clear conflicts of interest, but later even potential conflicts, 
must now be disclosed. Increasingly, these conflicts, as well as certain types of 
referral fees, are being barred altogether. Financial education designed to make 
consumers less vulnerable and wiser to potential conflicts of interest is often seen 
as a critical element of the informed choice approach to consumer protection.
The final key element of current consumer protection is the prudential regu-
lation of firms offering financial products to vulnerable consumers. This so-
called “microprudential” regulation is designed to ensure that firms do not 
collapse leaving their customers in the lurch. Arguably, the microprudential 
regulation of banks began as the quid pro quo of deposit insurance, introduced 
by the Glass-Steagall Act (1933) in the United States and through similar leg-
islation in several other countries around that time.12 Since the state carried 
the risk from deposit insurance, and banks profited from this, microprudential 
regulation of banks happened the way a car insurer might place covenants on 
a driver’s age to improve the odds that the insurance would not be called.
Explicit state guarantee of insurance payouts is far less common than it is 
for bank deposits.13 However, as we have seen in the case of Equitable Life 
and Executive Life, states often feel compelled to provide a safety net when 
insurance firms fail, mainly because of the huge number of ordinary consum-
ers involved. Today this is being used as a justification for more extensive 
­regulation of insurance firms’ solvency.
11In October 2008, the limit of the Federal Deposit Insurance’s guarantee of bank deposits 
was raised from $100,000 to $250,000.
12Today, around 100 countries have some form of deposit insurance. Typically, not all 
depositors are insured. The insurance tends to only cover retail deposits—so not deposits 
of companies or counterparties. Even on retail deposits, there is a cap with the current 
EU cap set at €100,000. The argument for capping is that it limits the cost of the scheme, 
protecting those least able to protect themselves—the vulnerability distinction—while 
also eliminating the spectre of bank runs.
13This is because a key motivation of deposit insurance is to stop a bank run. Depositors 
recognize that the failure of one bank can trigger the failure of others. However, their 
precautionary attempt to pull out their deposit from a safe bank for fear of losing it 
during a collapse could itself cause a collapse. Runs on insurance firms are far less likely 
(except in the rare case of reinsurance, insurance firms do not lend to insurance firms) 
so there is no need to avoid them by insuring insurance payouts. There are schemes to 
help alleviate insurance losses. In the US, for instance, several individual states (but not the 
federal government) must place a proportion of insurance premiums into a fund that can 
be drawn on to compensate customers in case of an insurance firm’s failure.

The Historical Evolution of Modern Consumer 
Protection Regulation
Each failure to protect consumers has pushed the evolution of regulation in 
this area. I would argue that it is easier to appreciate this by looking at older 
crises rather than the GFC where the scale of bailouts14 shifted the focus of 
reform from consumer protection to taxpayer protection. Faced with the 
unpopularity of slashing government expenditure to finance bank bailouts, 
politicians have sought ways of involving the private sector next time around 
(see Chapter 4), including private sector funding of deposit insurance.15
The GFC also popularized the belief that certain financial instruments are 
inherently dangerous and should never be sold to vulnerable consumers.16 
There is still a preference for regular warnings from regulators about the use 
of certain instruments—like financial spread bets in the UK—rather than the 
imposition of outright bans, but bans are becoming more frequent. On August 
6, 2014, the UK’s new Financial Conduct Authority used its consumer protec-
tion powers for the first time in suspending the sale of “cocos” to retail inves-
tors on the grounds that the instruments were “highly complex” and “unlikely 
to be appropriate for the mass retail market.”17 Yet the distinction between 
what is appropriate or inappropriate is murky. It is hard to comprehend why, if 
cocos are too risky for retail investors, financial spread bets are also not too 
risky given their extreme volatility and the poor odds of beating the house.18
Looking back before the GFC, conflicts of interest were seen to have played a 
major role in both the 1907 and 1929 stock market crashes. The 1933 Glass-
Steagall Act tried to deal with the interweaving of commercial lending, stock 
14The headline-hitting pledges of Treasury support to banks came to over $7 trillion 
worldwide, with the UK government alone pledging £1.2 trillion. However, the final 
amount of direct support, and the ultimate cost once repayments are considered, was a 
small fraction of this, excluding the final costs of the support offered through the central 
bank, which has not yet been accounted for.
15In December 2013, EU member states agreed on reforms that would require governments 
to impose fees on banks equivalent to 1.0 percent of insured deposits, earmarked for 
disbursing the costs of resolving or rescuing banks.
16For an explanation of why this is generally a bad idea, see Chapter 8.
17Cocos (or contingent, convertible, notes) are bonds issued by banks that pay an attractive 
coupon in good times and in bad; contingent on the issuer’s capital falling below a stated 
threshold, they convert into equity that could be lost completely without any recourse. 
For the FCA press release on restriction of the sale of cocos, see www.fca.org.uk/news/

18Further compounding the mixed messages, in the UK financial spread bets are also 
subject to the lowest level of betting tax—3.0 percent—but are banned outright in many 
other jurisdictions.

trading, and underwriting viewed as a root cause of the boom and bust that 
brought considerable losses to ordinary consumers. It sought to resolve the 
conflicts of interest that the connection of activities within the same insti-
tutions created—such as the corporate finance division raising money for 
corporate clients by helping them to issue securities and then selling those 
same securities to clients of the brokerage or asset management divisions. 
Glass-Steagall divorced commercial banking from securities underwriting. 
Commercial banks were not allowed to issue, underwrite, sell, or distribute 
any type of security with the exception of US-government and government-
agency securities and certain municipal bonds.19
Hindsight suggests that this enforced, legal separation provided important 
protection to consumers. However, it became increasingly leaky. The division 
was eroded over time and was constantly attacked by industry lobbyists, sug-
gesting that US competitiveness was being undermined relative to the many 
jurisdictions without similar separation. Samuel Johnson’s oft-quoted remark, 
“Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel”, comes to mind. In 1999, the 
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act formally removed laws separating commercial bank-
ing, investment banking, and insurance activities, though by then the divisions 
had long since been undermined.
In the run up to the 1999 change in the law and shortly afterward, con-
flicts of interest returned with a vengeance, helping to propel the dotcom 
boom to great heights. The revelation of these conflicts in the inevitable bust 
spawned a series of laws and legal settlements worldwide. Once again they 
were designed to lessen conflicts of interest or at least require disclosures 
of potential conflicts. The most recognized law was the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
of 200220 in the United States. It mandated greater disclosures of conflicts 
by securities analysts. Other rules sought to reduce conflicts by unbundling 
investment banking services. Trading commissions, for instance, could no lon-
ger include an unquantified payment for research or for giving trading clients 
access to investment banking clients.21
19Following the Glass-Steagall Act, the doyen of banking at the time, John Pierpont Morgan, 
chose to remain in commercial banking, but two of his partners, Harold Stanley and Henry 
Morgan, founded a new investment bank: Morgan Stanley.
20The official title is the Public Company Accounting and Investor Protection Act more 
commonly known as SOX. It was enacted on July 30, 2002 in the wake of a series of major 
corporate and accounting scandals, including WorldCom and Enron. Enron’s collapse 
brought down Arthur Andersen—at that time one of the “big 5” accounting practices. 
The company was found guilty of criminal charges relating to its auditing of Enron.
21This was a particular concern during the dotcom and later housing-finance bubbles when 
ordinary investors felt that banks were giving their more frequent trading clients, like 
hedge funds, priority access to information and opportunities regarding their investment 
banking clients.

In the UK the government’s attempt from the late 1980s onward to reduce 
state provision of pensions, by incentivizing and facilitating greater private 
provision, was a precursor to a spate of misselling scandals. Lloyds TSB was 
considered the worst offender, with 44 percent of the 22,500 policies sold 
between 2000 and 2001 being deemed inappropriate for the investor. Rules 
on how financial products are sold to retail investors were subsequently 
strengthened.
Around the same time as the pension misselling scandal in the UK, the Enron 
and WorldCom scandals were unraveling across the Atlantic. They involved 
conflicts of interest between auditors and the managers and shareholders of 
companies. One of the main achievements of Sarbanes-Oxley was the estab-
lishment of US standards for external auditor independence. This restricted, 
for instance, audit firms from offering non-audit services—like manage-
ment consulting for audit clients. Several countries have followed suit with  
similar legislation.22
Microprudential regulation of financial firms has evolved substantially with 
each wave of bailouts. The capital that banks must set aside has become a 
highly complex affair of estimating a bank’s risks. Minimum capital levels to be 
set aside against risk-weighted assets has increased though what constitutes 
risk and what is deemed capital swings back and forth.
Is the Current Approach Working?
The liberal consumer protection philosophy described earlier has prevailed for 
the last 30 years. The approach that existed before was more rigid, bounded 
as it was by the 1929 stock market crash and ensuing global depression and 
at the other end by the 1980s liberalization of finance.23 Deposits were guar-
anteed up to strict limits to avoid bank runs, and, as described previously, a 
separation of retail and commercial banking from investment banking was 
legally enforced to avoid conflicts of interest. While the regulatory narrative 
is of course highly politicized, it is arguable that consumer protection made 
strong gains between 1929 and 1979. Subsequently, there was less progress on 
defending consumers from abuse and more on enhancing consumer choice. 
Whatever the narrative, the abuse of consumers in relation to financial prod-
ucts has not noticeably trended lower with time and legislation over the past 
22SOX-like regulations on auditor independence and stricter corporate governance were 
enacted in Canada, Germany, and South Africa in 2002; France in 2003; Australia in 2004; 
India in 2005; and Japan and Italy in 2006.
23In the UK, there was a raft of liberalization measures that were collectively referred to 
as the “Big Bang” of 1987. In the US, Glass-Steagall was watered down through the 1980s 
and effectively repealed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999.

30-odd years. I do not believe the current approach is delivering better pro-
tection. This is so despite the explicit recognition that consumers need extra 
legal protection coupled with the acute public and political awareness of con-
sumer hardship resulting from faulty financial products.
Measuring consumer protection, however, raises a plethora of issues. What 
should the reference point be? Is it the number of actual victims of financial 
fraud versus the past figure or even the number of potential victims that mat-
ters? How do we compare different frauds inflicted upon consumers? Can we 
take into account consumer losses that do not go through the legal system?
In August 2012, the American SEC brought a civil enforcement action accus-
ing ZeekRewards of perpetrating a massive Ponzi scheme in which a penny-
bid auction site promised 1.5 percent daily returns to members who paid to 
place bids on goods where the lowest unique bid “won.” The court-appointed 
receiver estimated that some 2 million people were defrauded the tune of 
$600 million.24 Was it a financial-fraud or garden-variety consumer fraud? 
Was the sub-prime scandal worse because half a million families who took out 
a subprime mortgage had their home in foreclosure?
On the subject of subprime—another highly politicized issue—there is a 
question as to whether all subprime borrowers were truly victims since many 
would not have had a home but for a subprime mortgage. The numbers game 
brings interesting comparisons. It would suggest that “subprime” had fifty-
times-worse consequences than the fate of a mere ten thousand elderly and 
retired people persuaded by Lloyds TSB and others in the UK to replace 
reasonable state pensions with dud private ones. It is difficult to compare 
and contrast consumer protection over time. However, even drilling down to 
similar types of consumer protection failings does not reveal a recent down-
ward trend.
Prior to 2007, it might have been arguable that enhanced microprudential 
regulation of banks had delivered a downward trend in bank failures. Post-
2007 this is revealed to have been an illusion.25 There were just 4 bank fail-
ures in the United States in 2004 and none in either 2005 or 2006. However, 
this quiet period was followed by 297 failures between 2009 and 2010 alone. 
Foreclosures of mortgages followed a similar trajectory.

Increased consumer information, education, disclosure and greater protec-
tion of vulnerable consumers have not protected consumers from being 
lured into the most traditional of investment frauds—the Ponzi, or pyramid, 
scheme. Although the term is often used too liberally, a real Ponzi scheme, 
named after Charles Ponzi’s 1920 scheme in Boston, is one where existing 
investors are paid returns from the cash of new investors. This unsustainable 
strategy works so long as the amount of new money flowing in is greater 
than the money owed to existing investors. With an attractive-enough rate of 
return being promised, and initially delivered, these schemes can last for a long,  
long time.26
The demise of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities was an unpleasant 
Christmas gift to thousands of investors in December 2008. In terms of the 
loss of investor principal, it was the largest Ponzi scheme in history (at circa 
$17.3 billion). The trial and subsequent human tragedies means that few are 
unaware of Bernie Madoff. Yet despite this scandal, and despite the visible tell-
tale signs of any Ponzi scheme in the form of unrealistically high and steady 
investment returns, consumers still queued up to join later schemes or failed 
to exit them. Post-Madoff, investors in Stanford Investment Bank’s certifi-
cates of deposit lost between $4.5 and $6 billion. Lenders to Petters Group 
Worldwide lost $3.7 billion. Investors in Nevin Shapiro’s Capitol Investments 
USA lost over $150 million. More than five years after closing down Madoff, 
the SEC closed Edwin Fujinaga’s Ponzi scheme where investors lost $800 mil-
lion.27 It seems that consumer choice and consumer protection are as much 
substitutes as they are compliments.
This book has already dealt extensively with the failure to save banks using 
risk-sensitive approaches to bank regulation.28 So here we will focus on pro-
tecting consumers other than by ensuring the vendor doesn’t collapse. There 
are a handful of reasons why the existing efforts to protect consumers fall 
short of their goal. Let us examine these in greater detail before contem-
plating possible solutions. It is important to focus on the actual problem we 
are trying to solve rather than getting waylaid by the myriad of potentially 
good ideas.

What Is the Problem We Need to Solve?
At the core of this issue is the reality that most consumers are liquidity con-
strained. Regulators in developed countries imagine that the rest of society is 
like themselves. They are employed, work hard and become more senior over 
time. Each new pay grade allows them to put aside interest on the mortgage, 
payoff the car loan, and perhaps add to a pension and life insurance. They also 
spend time dealing with the new robber barons running hedge or private 
equity funds from the comfort of their mega yachts. What regulators some-
times forget is that those on median incomes lead a very different existence. 
The average consumer behaves as if cash-strapped with few assets and would 
consume more today if she could borrow on the basis of future earnings—a 
definition of being liquidity constrained.
This behaviour may be a reflection of social pressures to increase consump-
tion as well as the realities of income inequality. In the UK, while the vocal 
economic and political elite earns multiples of £100,000, the average income 
of a working person is £27,820. But even this average is not representative. 
The median income, which 50 percent of the population earn less than, is 
£22,880 with 25 percent earning less than £14,300. Compare that with the 
average cost of renting a two-bedroom flat in London at £19,260. London is 
the most expensive part of the UK and incomes are often higher. However, 
rents are still as much as £6,558 or 29% of national median incomes for a one-
bedroom flat in County Antrim and North Lancashire—the cheapest part of 
the country, with attendant lower incomes, higher unemployment, and preva-
lent underemployment.29 Many countries have a more even income distribu-
tion than the UK or the United States. Yet the harsh truth is that in most of 
the world, ordinary consumers do not have much spare cash and want more. 
They exhibit a strong liquidity preference.30
Some suggest that liquidity concerns are merely part of today’s fashion and 
are often fashionable following a major crisis. But evolutionary psychologists 
argue that strong liquidity preferences in humans are ancient. What psycholo-
gists call a “positive time preference” is hardwired into our genes and not 
merely a feature of the less fortunate. Our genetic design has evolved over 
several hundred thousand years in an environment where survival was a min-
ute-by-minute affair. It made sense to opt for existing gains or pleasures rather 
than a hypothetical benefit in an uncertain future.31

Maynard Keynes in The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (New York: 
Harcourt Brace, 1936).

No matter how many brochures or investment warnings are thrust in front 
of them, liquidity-constrained people favor riskier bets where they put aside 
less and hope to receive more.32 Liquidity-constrained people spend a greater 
proportion of their income on lottery tickets than others.33 Most people who 
participate in lotteries understand that they are bad bets. The expected out-
come is negative—the ticket price less the probability of winning, times the 
outcome if you do win is a loss. Yet they continue to buy lottery tickets 
weekly because doing so offers a miniscule chance of escaping their current 
predicament. When a financial advisor opens a box of chocolates, reads out 
the different ingredients, and asks which one they have an appetite for, liquid-
ity-constrained individuals willingly take riskier choices.
Unintended consequences are a major issue with attempts to protect con-
sumers. For example when single careers limited to one or two employers 
over a lifetime of continuous work were common, pension plans, life insur-
ance and medical plans were usually linked to the employer—the so-called 
occupational pension and health schemes. Employers used these schemes to 
incentivize loyalty where the longer an employee stayed, the greater the ben-
efits. In return, loyal employees received the benefits of risk spreading, pool-
ing, and professional management of their pensions and often also received a 
subsidy (effectively paid for by those who only stayed with the employer for 
a short while). Overall this proved a mutually satisfactory bargain. However, 
there were alarming instances of troubled firms dipping into the pension plan, 
underfunding it, or closing it down without adequate provision for previous 
pension commitments.
Robert Maxwell’s sudden death in 1991 revealed that the Mirror Group boss 
had, it appears, stolen £400 million from the 32,000 member-strong company 
pension scheme. Another classic example was the sale in 2000 of the last 
British mass-market car manufacturer, MG Rover, to a group that was advised 
by the firm’s auditors and included its former CEO. The price tag? £10. The 
government supported the takeover on the grounds that it would keep Rover 
in British hands and jobs local. The so-called “Phoenix Four” took the firm pri-
vate, apparently pocketed £42 million from the pension fund before the firm 
collapsed in 2005 with no payouts or pensions for current and past workers.
Inquiries into these affairs called for widespread reforms to make their 
repetition impossible. Enacted reforms in the UK and elsewhere included 
requiring employers to fully account and provide for their future pension 
liabilities. However, the present value of these liabilities and funding gaps swing

markedly with the rise and fall of long-term interest rates and stock markets. 
This was a particular problem for old or downsized companies like national 
coal, rail or post-offices. These were companies whose pension funds and 
commitments were huge relative to current company size. The value of the 
pension fund fluctuated immensely with changes in the business’ earnings. 
This scenario was further complicated by steadily rising life expectancies that 
in turn increased pension liabilities. Longevity risk—having to pay a pension 
for a longer period than anticipated as life expectancies rose—played a role 
in the demise of the Equitable Life Assurance Society. The management at 
companies with large pension funds were frustrated as attempts to rectify 
challenges at the operating company level were swamped by shifts outside of 
their control, such as the general direction of stock prices, shifts in interest 
rate levels, and increased longevity risk. Securities analysts came to view such 
companies as really pension funds or, in the United States, as retiree medical 
plans, with a small operating business attached. This disincentivised firms from 
continuing their pension and similar commitments.
Over time, firms began switching from defined-benefit or final-salary pension 
schemes to defined-contribution schemes. In a defined-contribution scheme, 
the final pension is determined by whatever size of annuity could be bought 
with the value of the pension pot. Pensions became variable, dependent on 
investment performance, (largely stocks), rather than fixed in proportion to 
final salary or length of service. This meant that the liability was no different 
than the asset—a positive development from the perspective of the operating 
company. There would be no more wild swings in earnings as a result of the 
performance of things the company could not influence. In short the employer 
ceased to act as insurer of the employees’ pension, merely the manager.
This was sold to pensioners on the basis that there was less chance of a 
company failure ruining their pension à la Maxwell and it made pensions as 
portable as employment and careers had become. But it also meant that the 
risk of the final pension being inadequate had effectively shifted from the firm 
to the employee. Employees are far less able to manage these additional risks. 
In the name of protecting consumers from pension fraud, regulators shifted 
much of the pension risk to those least able to manage it. Trying to protect 
consumers from pension fraud risk through accounting standards had unin-
tended and significantly adverse consequences.
Traditionally, economic theory held that greater choice was always to be pre-
ferred. Up until the GFC that was also the credo followed by regulators.34 Over 
the past twenty years, economics has begun to embrace and incorporate new 
psychological research that offers a more critical evaluation of choice. It is 
34I recall UK regulators, prior to the GFC, wondering aloud whether it was right to 
deny the less well off the choice and benefits of investing in hedge fund-leveraged and 
unconstrained investment firms.

Chapter 7 | Protecting Consumers

now suggested that while some choice is desirable too much can be debilitat-
ing. Nobel Laureate Daniel McFadden argues that excessive consumer choice 
creates the perception that there is a significant risk of getting it wrong—a 
problem augmented by the fear of getting life-impactful financial decisions 
wrong.35 Arguably this explains why rising incomes in many countries and the 
associated pension, health, and welfare reforms have actually led to increased 
anxiety and unhappiness. There is an increase in uncertainty and risk attached 
to the benefits that were previously considered—rightly or wrongly—as an 
entitlement. Prolific choice has become a double-edged sword.36
Conflicts of interest remain a major cause of consumer grief. They continue 
to exist because they are imbedded in the actual business model of financial 
advice. Advisors get paid by telling consumers to do something that either 
directly or indirectly generates a commission. Today these commissions must 
be disclosed, are increasingly unbundled, and some are simply banned. The 
obvious answer is to extend the scope of these bans. However the reality is 
that consumers do not want to pay directly for advice, especially if that advice, 
however correct, involves telling them to do nothing, or is something they 
could have done themselves. More bans have not meant more independent 
advice. There is merely less advice now. Once more, regulation has shifted 
greater responsibility onto consumers.
Another challenge we face with consumer protection relates to the interplay 
between past norms and new risks. Regulators find it difficult to ignore the 
baggage of their history. They could easily ban new-fangled products like bail-
in securities on the grounds of being too risky. However, almost all the cutting-
edge products are merely new combinations of preexisting products. The 
risks they carry can be recreated using old, common instruments. Yet stating 
that consumers can no longer be trusted to buy what they, their parents and 
grandparents, have always been able to buy is politically untenable.
Several products our parents bought, such as unlisted penny stocks, time-
shares and cash-value life insurance were also likely to lose them money. 
Consider for a moment the buying of ordinary shares. The annual volatility of 
the S&P 500 Index—a diversified portfolio of five hundred stocks—is around 
20 percent. The volatility of various individual stocks within that portfolio is 
much higher and the median investor holds possibly one, maybe two, stocks 
35See Daniel McFadden, “Free Markets and Fettered Consumers” (AEA Presidential Address, 
January 7, 2006). Professor McFadden shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences 
with James Heckman for his work on the development of theory and methods for analyzing 
discrete choice.
36Some, like Renata Salecl and Barry Schwartz citing experimental psychology and 
consumer studies, describe too much choice as debilitating, a tyranny, and a source of 
despair. See Renata Salecl, The Tyranny of Choice (London: Profile Books, 2011).

but not five hundred. These stocks are often not chosen for their diversifica-
tion. More than likely they were inherited through employment or a connec-
tion to a family business. Regulators stop institutional investors with their 
expert, professional investment managers from buying too many equities but 
dare not ban retail investors from doing the same. History can get in the way 
of trying to make regulation coherent.
Despite all the financial education, independent advice, and mandated dis-
closures, the best predictor of consumers’ investment decisions is often tax 
policy. The average consumer’s principal savings are tied up in property. Not 
only can consumers leverage up to own a property investment, if they cat-
egorize it as their main home, the returns are often free of capital gains tax. 
In several countries, most notably the United States, mortgage interest is also 
tax deductible.
Life insurance policies enjoy favorable tax treatment. Often, after exhausting 
their tax-free investment accounts, consumers are persuaded to buy opaque 
investment instruments (cash life insurance policies) disguised as life insurance 
policies solely for the tax benefits. Financial regulators and the tax authori-
ties are seen as distinctly separate plates, yet much of the financial industry 
lies along the active fault lines of the two. To ignore tax policy is to ignore a 
significant aspect of how consumer choice works in practice.
Increased consumer choice and increased disclosures to make those choices 
better informed, coupled with some additional safeguards, seems an almost-
noble approach, nested in individual responsibility. Alas, it does not work in a 
world of liquidity-constrained individuals. This failure is further confounded by 
conflicted investment advice, accounting practices that discourage the choices 
customers really need and tax policies that encourage substitution of proper 
investment decision-making with tax planning. But to note these constraints 
is not to advocate an abandonment of the existing tools of consumer protec-
tion. Indeed, efforts to reduce conflicts of interest, rules on how something 
should be sold, and what disclosures are required are all exemplary and nec-
essary. However, they are simply insufficient in a liquidity-constrained world. 
Preserving the distinction between vulnerable and regular consumers is cor-
rect—although in the section below I suggest drawing the line between them 
differently. Doing so would improve the functioning of the financial system and 
its capacity to provide financial protection to certain consumers. It has also 
been argued that the mere presence of hedge funds and private equity firms 
distorts markets, tilting them against vulnerable or even ordinary consum-
ers. The popular solution advocated in Europe is that they are taxed out of 
­existence. I will examine this solution before presenting my own.

Should We Clamp Down On Hedge Funds 
and the Like In the Name of Consumer 
Protection?
Financial markets need liquidity to operate properly. A well-functioning market 
is one where locating a buyer for every seller and vice versa does not require 
wild price swings. Liquidity requires diversity.37 In a sense, it requires “losers”, 
namely investors prepared to bet that a falling market will soon turn around. 
While the crowd sells, they buy, providing liquidity and helping to stabilize mar-
kets. To be buyers when all others are sellers, they must be working with dif-
ferent valuations, objectives, or capacities. “Chasers”—those who sell markets 
that are going down in price or buy those going up—drain liquidity and cause 
instability. Regulators should observe the proportion of “losers” and “chasers” 
in their markets and consider ways, like those we will discuss in Chapter 12, of 
stopping their markets being overrun by chasers. Failure to do so risks a repeat 
of events like the May 6, 2010, “Flash Crash,” when the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average Index plunged over five hundred points, or 4 percent, in a matter of a 
minutes—the biggest intraday points swing in the Index’s history.38
So to function well, financial markets need a section—albeit a relatively small 
proportion—of investors who are unconstrained. They must want to buy 
when all others are selling or are critically prepared, as we shall see further 
on, to sell insurance against future losses when everyone else wants to buy 
it. Who would want this role of “loser,” or financial insurer? Should it be 
Aunt Agatha, risking her life savings, or alternatively, a hedge fund with seri-
ously wealthy investors who could afford to lose everything in the fund? In 
the interests of financial market liquidity, those investors who can prove that 
they have a level of assets where the risk of old-age penury is small should be 
unconstrained. This goes hand in hand with being unprotected by the state. 
Unconstrained does not mean above the law on insider-information or creat-
ing false markets. It is simply that they can afford to lose everything and should 
never be bailed out. The distinction we should draw, therefore, is not between 
financial experts and non-experts but between those with the capacity to 
absorb huge losses and those who cannot.39

Liquidity Risk (London: Risk Books, 2003).
38I remember the Flash Crash well. I got up to give the after dinner talk at a conference in 
Geneva as the meteoric fall began. Only later did I understand why everyone was ignoring 
my carefully planned remarks and staring, nose down, open mouthed, at their BlackBerrys.
39After the GFC, many well-remunerated financial experts in asset management companies 
objected to being termed experts. They stated that they could not have possibly known 
what they were buying when they placed credit default swaps in their portfolio to spice 
up returns and boost performance bonuses. It is best not to assume anyone is an expert. 
Focus should be directed at their capacity for loss.

Individual Capacity for Risk and Loss
Following on from our earlier discussion, we should assume that ordinary 
consumers, no matter how much information, disclosure, and warnings they 
have, would behave in a liquidity-constrained manner by placing irrational 
bets.40 How should they be protected? I suggest borrowing from the frame-
work based on the concept of risk capacity developed in Chapter 5 for banks 
and Chapter 6 for insurers. This is a subtle but crucial shift from the cur-
rent approach of using risk sensitivity and risk appetite. Liquidity-constrained 
individuals will go for the greatest potential return, within the boundaries 
of familiarity or social acceptability. Often these are bad bets. They do not 
even represent the best return per risk.41 Simultaneously, in asking consumers 
about their risk appetite, financial advisors are posing the misleading connec-
tion that higher returns are available only to the brave. Of course while higher 
returns come from taking greater risks, certain individuals have a greater abil-
ity to absorb particular risks than others. Extra returns are available to them 
without being bold and fearless. Others have less capacity to absorb the same 
risks so for them the return available requires a higher level of bravery. The 
game of good investment is not to be the bravest. The key is to first maximize 
the return available by taking risks that are less of a risk to you than for others 
given your specific capacity to absorb those risks.
Factors that influence this absorption rate include how the financial risk is 
being taken and funded and whether a consumer has a natural ability to hedge 
the risk. Also important is whether the consumer possesses a superior under-
standing and knowledge of the risk, which makes it smaller for him than oth-
ers. Take the example I discussed in the previous chapter. If a consumer is 
saving to foot the expense of a medical emergency, he has little scope to earn 
extra returns from taking liquidity risks. Recall that liquidity risk is the risk that 
asset prices would be significantly lower if you were forced to sell tomorrow 
as opposed to having time to find a willing buyer. The consumer may have 
some modest scope to take liquid credit risks if he is able to diversify his 
investments. If, on the other hand, he is putting aside a monthly amount for a 
pension in twenty years’ time, he has the capacity to earn extra returns from 
taking liquidity and market risks. He doesn’t have the capacity to absorb inex-
pertly managed credit risks as credit risks rise over time allowing for a cor-
porate bankruptcy or other adverse credit event to materialize. The “What is 
your risk appetite?” approach to consumer financial advice rides roughshod 
over the essential connection between risk taking and risk capacity.
40See M. Friedman and L. Savage, “The Utility Analysis of Choices Involving Risk,” Journal of 
Political Economy, 1948, Vol 56.
41Which would be the preferred position of a risk and liquidity-neutral investor.

Chapter 7 | Protecting Consumers
110
Consumers are borrowers as well as savers. Indeed, in the Anglo-Saxon world, 
they often borrow to purchase assets (homes) that eventually become their 
principal savings. However it may be easier to comprehend consumer protec-
tion issues from the perspective of a consumer buying a dud savings product. 
I will illustrate my suggested approach with the case of savings products, but 
similar principles can be applied to borrowing. In a sense, borrowing is merely 
savings in reverse. You receive the payout up-front and then repay through 
monthly contributions. The protection concerns are about whether the size 
or variability of those contributions are understood and appropriate to the 
circumstances of the consumer.
Ordinary consumers should only be able to invest in insured funds. A further 
set of consumers with more than a certain minimum level of assets would be 
allowed to invest in uninsured funds. The insurance could come from either 
insurance firms or financial providers purchasing financial insurance securities, 
like financial options. It is likely that part of the return of the less ordinary 
investors will come from selling financial insurance to ordinary consumers, 
helping to close the investment loop. There are some parallels here with the 
original Lloyds insurance market where syndicates of wealthy “names”, who 
were occasionally ruined by doing so, insured the rest of us.
There would be different tiers of maximum losses. The logic of this tiered 
arrangement is fourfold. The risks available to liquidity-constrained consum-
ers need to be limited for the reasons previously cited in this chapter. Once 
a consumer has sufficient liquidity in safe assets to buffer life’s unanticipated 
events, she can afford to take proportionally greater credit and liquidity risks 
with savings and borrowing products. Those with more disposable income 
have a greater capacity to take credit and liquidity and market risks than oth-
ers. Finally, to achieve the best allocation of their resources, mixing assets and 
liabilities, consumers need to be explicit about what capacity for risk their 
investments or borrowing requires. It might be the capacity to lock up funds 
for a lengthy time, or be able to manage a diversified pool of credit risks.
For example, a fund could be insured against a loss of principal in excess of 
10 percent on a daily basis. This insurance sets the risk capacity of the fund. 
To reduce insurance premiums and boost net returns, this fund’s manager 
would end up taking credit rather than liquidity risks. He would also invest in 
a diversified portfolio of short-dated bonds of corporates with plenty of inter-
est cover from their earnings. Another fund could be insured against any loss 
of principal, but only after a five-year period. The manager here has a wider 
capacity to invest in liquidity and market risks but not credit risks. This diver-
sified portfolio would have a significant equity component as well as other 
investments whose risks can be spread over time.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
111
Regulators would only have to set the broad parameters of the insured funds 
market that retail investors would be allowed to invest in freely. The market 
would then develop on its own. There would be funds that insured end-of-
period returns up to one day, six months, two years, and beyond. Funds could 
also insure against a loss of principal greater than 0 percent, 5 percent, 10 per-
cent, and 20 percent. Ordinary consumers would only have access to invest 
in a higher tier after reaching a minimum level of investment in the lower tier.  
A consumer wishing to invest in a fund that was insured against a loss of prin-
cipal greater than 10 percent must show investments in funds with a loss of 
principal of less than 5 percent.
Minimum investment-per-tier levels would be informed by consumer surveys 
and set quite low. The purpose is to provide the most restraint to those 
with the least capacity to take risk. Others can be less constrained. In 2015, 
American households have, on average, $12,800 to save or spend on dis-
cretionary items and individuals less than that.42 We accept that the mean 
average hides a skewed distribution and the authorities may prefer to use the 
median rather than the mean level.43 The minimum investment in the lowest 
risk tier before a consumer is allowed to proceed to higher tiers could be set 
at 50 percent of the average annual discretionary spending and savings avail-
able to individual consumers ($6,400). The minimum investment in the next 
tier could be set at 25 percent ($3,200), the next tier at 12.5 percent ($1,600), 
and so on.
Many will share my extreme unease at the extent of paternalism being pre-
sented here. They may prefer an alternative where disposable income is 
automatically placed in different accounts in accordance with the structure 
described, but which consumers can then opt to reallocate. A traditional 
economist might argue that this is a nuisance. People will end up where they 
would otherwise have chosen to be after the unnecessary costs of both time 
and expense. However, there is now a substantial amount of literature on how 
simple, gentle nudges can and do change behavior.44
This alternative approach is probably best mated with a more muscular 
approach to ensuring independent financial advice. Instead of multiple disclo-
sures and lengthy fine print, financial advisors should be banned from any rela-
tionship with financial services providers. They should be paid by an agency

More than eighty-five years later, consumer protection in the financial industry 
remains a crucial and highly charged issue. Worldwide many a politician has 
built a hefty career on this single issue. In 2015, the “freshman” Massachusetts 
senator, Elizabeth Warren, was thrust into the democratic senate leadership 
mainly because of her relentless campaigning on this issue. Legislators have 
rapidly responded over the years with ever-tightening rules regarding conflicts 
of interest and disclosures. Yet each turn of the legislative screw appears to 
merely mark time before the next costly deception entangles us. The solu-
tions I have described run the danger of paternalism. This must be weighed 
against the current approach of informed choice which has proved insufficient 
to the challenge that ordinary consumers, given the choice, eagerly and delib-
erately, make bad bets.

How Accounting,  
Credit, and  
Risk Standards  
Create Risk
And What To Do About It
Financial practitioners and regulators largely agree that the Global Financial 
Crisis (GFC), and other recent crises, was compounded by the use of 
International Financial Reporting Standards. These standards emphasize 
marking the value of assets to their current market price. The accountant 
shorthand for this practice is “mark-to-market.”1 The application of IFRS’s

Liquidity,” Banque de France, Financial Stability Review, no. 12, October 2008.

standard that governs the loan-loss provisions for financial institutions and 
extends mark-to-market2 meant that when asset prices fell sharply in 2007 
and 2008, financial institutions were forced to raise capital to set against the 
deterioration in their asset/liability ratio. To raise cash quickly they had to 
liquidate assets. This depressed asset prices, which in turn caused an increase 
in computed risk, a need for more capital and more selling. A vicious cycle 
ensued that was driven primarily by these valuation conventions rather than 
an actual need for readily available cash.
This unfortunate cycle might have been broken if cheaper asset prices had drawn 
in cash-rich buyers looking for bargains. However, most of these buyers were 
themselves constrained by similar valuation approaches. These valuations were 
embedded in modern risk management systems that fed off short-term price 
volatility and correlation or utilized credit ratings that are a lagged response 
to price developments. Valuation and risk systems forced potential buyers to 
either stand back or put up an onerous amount of capital to be set against 
the computation of risks.3 We have touched in the last few chapters on the 
unhelpful procyclicality of bank and insurance capital adequacy requirements.4 
The requirement that participants adhere to both current asset valuations 
and risk assessments driven by the volatility and correlations of these prices 
was a critical component of this negative dynamic.
2The stated intent of IAS 39, or the International Accounting Standard 39, is to harmonize 
accounting standards internationally. These standards are set by the International 
Accounting Standards Board, which is an independent body of the IFRS Foundation that 
is monitored by, and accountable to, the European Commission, the Japanese Financial 
Services Agency, the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the Emerging Markets 
Committee of IOSCO, and the Technical Committee of IOSCO—the International 
Organization of Securities Commissions. IOSCO is comprised of 120 securities regulators 
and 80 securities market participants. These accounting and reporting standards are the 
standard used in the EU and many other countries except the United States, which uses 
its own set of rules known as GAAP, or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.
3I recall a discussion about a survey of buyers of credit derivative instruments that 
happened just before a meeting of CESR, the Committee of European Securities 
Regulators, at which I gave a presentation. If memory serves, the meeting took place 
in Paris sometime in 2008. Almost every respondent reported that credit derivative 
instruments were now extremely cheap but they would not be buying any. Through their 
risk management systems formidably high capital requirements were imposed for holding 
instruments with high volatility whether they were near rock bottom or not.
4See in particular Chapters 3, 5 and 6.

In a financial crisis, when readily available cash or other forms of liquidity are 
in short supply, the price of most financial assets falls substantially below the 
price they would fetch after the crisis is over or when a bond matures. The 
extra yield (above the yield of an otherwise identical asset)5 that an illiquid 
asset must offer to incentivize investors to buy or hold them is known as the 
liquidity premium. Usually for those securities that trade on an exchange the 
liquidity premium is a forgettable fraction of a percentage point. However, 
during a crisis it can rise to tens of percentage points or more. Assets that 
are most distant from ready cash will offer the greatest liquidity risk premium.
Several commentators have suggested that, during a crisis, mark-to-market 
accounting should be suspended. This would limit asset holders being forced 
to liquidate assets at the worst possible time because of accounting and valu-
ation rules rather than because of a pressing need for cash. In crises, policy 
makers are cornered into limited choices and uncomfortable trade-offs and so 
I am generally sympathetic to such heterodox proposals and less attracted by 
opposing moral hazard arguments. However, I believe there are better solutions 
that would not weaken incentives for responsible lending before the crash. In 
previous chapters in this book I have suggested that to stop or soften financial 
crashes we must tackle the booms. Offering forbearance from mark-to-market 
accounting during a crisis, yet using them during the preceding boom, will not 
reduce the frequency or severity of subsequent crashes. It could actually worsen 
the crisis—particularly if this pattern of policy response became routine.
Moreover, financial crises are a febrile time. Rumors morph into self-fulfilling 
prophecies as panic and fear whip through the economy. It is not the time to 
indulge in greater opacity and uncertainty by fiddling with valuation standards. 
This is not to negate the view that a significant revision to accounting rules is 
desirable. But a rule revision based on having complete faith in the messen-
ger’s every word during the good times but shooting him in the bad is unlikely 
to work in the long run.
The focus on the role of accounting standards in financial crises is a little unfair. 
In previous chapters we argue that financial cycles are amplified by a number 
of factors working in unison. There was the so-called risk-sensitive capital 
adequacy regime we have described and discussed previously in Chapters 5 
and 6. Then there were regulatory-approved and promoted market-sensitive 
risk management systems.6 In these systems, risk limits and sell orders are 
triggered in response to a rise in short-term price volatility and correlation. 
5One with a similar risk of credit default or that is similarly exposed to the volatility of 
some market price. An example is the shares of two oil companies with similar exposures 
but where one has a larger free float of shares.
6Under Basel II, banks that could boast sophisticated price-sensitive risk models like 
Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Daily Eearnings At Risk (DEAR) could adopt the internal risk 
model approach to calculating capital adequacy, often resulting in lower capital adequacy 
requirements.

Embedded in these first two approaches, and in the reporting standards banks 
used, was the mark-to-market valuation approach. Often, in blaming a process 
they were uninvolved with, one set of professionals try to disentangle the 
effects of each approach. In reality they are a single package. Mark-to-market 
accounting standards were simply one limb of a wider regulatory philosophy 
to publicly incorporate market prices into the valuation of assets, the assess-
ment of their risks, and the response to both. It may now seem obvious that 
this is circular and conducive to systemic collapse. Yet it was part of the domi-
nant market fundamentalism we have described before. Back then to disagree 
with this fundamentalism risked ridicule and being branded a heretic.7
From Bank Finance to Market Finance
The 20-year trend prior to the GFC was the “marketization” of finance: a shift 
from bank finance to market finance. Loans were originated and securitized by 
banks, rated by credit rating agencies, and then relocated to investors. Cynics 
argue this was really regulatory arbitrage. Risks were transferred, (at least on 
paper), from the regulated sector where capital had to be put aside for credit 
risks, to the unregulated sector, where it did not.8 But bear in mind that bank 
supervisors and regulators who were on the Basel Committee in the 1990s 
had welcomed the marketization of banking risk. They looked favorably on a 
process that appeared to distribute risks away from a small number of large 
and systemically important banks to a large number of investors. Attempts have 
been made to distract us from the regulators’ role as protagonists in the 
7I suspect I was called a heretic more often than some who now try to argue they called 
it right, but in godless Britain being called a heretic is often a compliment. I recall in 2005 
one official from the UK’s FSA, who has gone on to very senior regulatory positions, 
responded to my suggestion that risk transfers should not be left entirely to the market 
but incentivised to go where they are best absorbed, by calling me a “Stalinist”. Now that 
hurt.
8This sometimes happened within the same institution. Early on in the crisis, Charles 
Goodhart observed that many of the banks that needed to be rescued or failed in the 
GFC were those that appeared to follow the “originate and relocate” model, where 
loans were issued and then packaged into groups of loans that were then securitized and 
sold off, but they did not relocate the risks far enough. Holding the opinion that these 
instruments were of good value, they clung on to too much of the risk in off-balance-
sheet special-purpose vehicles to which they also foolishly extended a liquidity backstop. 
For a detailed study of this behavior, see Viral V. Acharya, Philipp Schnabl, and Gustav 
Suarez, “Securitization Without Risk Transfer,” Journal of Financial Economics 107, no. 3 
(2013), pp. 515–36.

ancien regime by emphasizing iniquitous behavior among bank originators and 
credit rating agencies and the potential collusion between the two.9 Do not 
be too distracted.
Context is paramount. In fairness to regulators, the banks had proved inferior 
at managing risk on their balance sheet in the past. In the mid-1970s, there 
were economic crises that spilled over into banking crises in the United States, 
United Kingdom, and elsewhere. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 
was formed by the Group of Ten10 in response to these crises—in particular 
the messy international liquidation of Cologne-based Herstatt Bank in 1973.11 
9Many inquisitors focus on the role of the suspicious business model of credit rating 
agencies—where they are paid by those they rate—as a reason why the originate-
redistribute model failed. They ignore the fact that the agencies only adopted this model 
after investors stopped paying for ratings. Why pay for a good whose value increased the 
more common it became? They also overlooked the fact that this flawed business model 
worked reasonably well for single-issue ratings. Where the ratings failed spectacularly was 
in structured products and this is where the agencies were acting more as statisticians, 
not their strength, than as credit analysts. They used statistical models, which assumed 
sample independence. This assumption was undermined by regulatory encouragement of 
the disclosure of rating methodologies. Using this disclosure, banks built security packages 
to the likely rating, destroying sample independence. The rating agencies profited and 
actively participated in this process, though never as much as the banks. I recall sitting on 
a panel in 2000 with Barbara Ridpath, then a member of Standard & Poor’s rating agency 
and hearing her presciently state that making credit ratings part of bank regulation was 
going to be bad for everyone including the rating agencies.
10The Group of Ten (G-10) is actually 11 countries today, having originally been made 
up of the eight countries (Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the 
United Kingdom, and the United States) that agreed in 1962 to participate in the General 
Arrangements to Borrow from one another and from the central banks of two others, 
Germany and Sweden. In 1964, the group was joined by Switzerland. Before the G-20 
Group of Finance Ministers and Central Banks was established post-Asian Financial Crisis 
of 1997–98, the G-10 was the financial complement to the G-7 political powers. It is a sign 
of the changed international political economy that the Bretton Woods system of pegged 
exchange rates, negotiated and signed by 44 countries in 1944 under the auspices of the 
UN, was dismantled by the Smithsonian Agreement signed in December 1971 by this 
unofficial grouping of 11 countries. For more history of the Basel Committee, see Charles 
Goodhart’s definitive work, The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision: A History of the 
Early Years, 1974–1997 (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, October 2011). For 
a reflection of the different international political economy of Bretton Woods, see Eric 
Helleiner’s fascinating Forgotten Foundations of Bretton Woods: International Development 
and the Making of Postwar Order (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2014).
11On June 26, 1974, German regulators closed the troubled Bank Herstatt. However, they 
did so before Herstatt’s New York branch delivered dollars in return for deutschmarks 
that Herstatt’s Frankfurt branch had received before the closure. This caused a dollar 
shortage in New York for several days. In an attempt to avoid what became known as 
the Herstatt risk, the G-10’s Basel Committee was established to improve regulatory 
cooperation. Amongst other things it supported the development of the real-time gross 
settlement system for banks, and some 32 years later, the continuous linked settlement 
platform for foreign exchange transactions.

118
But the Committee’s work did not reduce the frequency of bank failures. In the 
late 1980s and early 1990s, US-based bank regulators would have had the Latin 
American debt crisis and the Savings-and-loans disaster12 preying on their minds 
plus the collapse of institutions such as Continental Illinois,13 MCorp and All 
First, among others. Each collapse threatened widespread dislocation if taxpay-
ers’ money was not liberally spent in a bailout or put at risk through guarantees.
The 1990s witnessed widespread banking crises in Japan, Sweden and Finland. 
It is worth recalling that one of the other motivations for the establishment of 
the first Basel Accord on banking supervision was Western powers¢ concern 
that the rapid emergence and increasing systemic importance of Japanese 
banks was linked to less stringent capital requirements in Japan.
Fresh out of the UK’s “secondary banking crisis” of 1973–75 and the resulting 
concentration of commercial banks into just the four majors, UK regulators 
did not suffer any generalized crises during the 1980s and 1990s. However, 
they still had to grapple with the collapse of a host of small to medium-sized 
institutions such as British and Commonwealth, Barings, and Johnson Matthey 
Bank, as well as the much larger, though less UK focused, Bank of Credit and 
Commerce International (BCCI).
Before the 1990s, banks, like other companies, primarily used historic cost 
valuations for their loan books. Re-valuations to reflect current prices were 
infrequent. The marketization of banking brought the greater use of mar-
ket prices in the valuation, measurement, and control of bank risks. During 
quiet times, taking credit risks out of the dark corners of bank balance 
sheets and placing them into the open arena of continuously priced financial 
markets seemed reasonable. It appeared to offer greater liquidity, lower 
risk premium and a more sophisticated, nuanced risk management than the 
model of bank finance underpinned by the first Basel Accord (“Basel 1”) 
on bank supervision.14 By being more conducive to transparent, frequent, 
12The savings-and-loan crisis was the failure of 747 savings-and-loan associations (S&Ls) 
in the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The ultimate cost of the crisis, as 
estimated by a financial audit of the Resolution Trust Corporation set up to rescue the 
S&Ls, was approximately $160.1 billion.
13The Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Company was at one time the seventh-
largest bank in the United States as measured by deposits. In May 1984, the bank became 
insolvent, due partly to bad loans purchased from the failed Penn Square Bank N.A. of 
Oklahoma—loans for the Oklahoma and Texas oil boom of the late 1970s and early 
1980s. It was then the largest-ever bank failure in US history, and it is said that the 
phrase “too big to fail” became popularized by Congressman Stewart McKinney in a 1984 
congressional hearing on the FDIC’s intervention with Continental Illinois.
14One of the problems of Basel I was that it did not take a nuanced view of risk but 
allocated risk between crudely defined buckets. Over time it was felt that banks were 
“gaming” these distinctions to take more risk than first appeared.

external valuations, market-price based finance was perceived as helping to 
decrease fraud and increase market discipline. Under the glare of mark-to-
market, surely banks would behave better. At least the intentions were good.
Market flaws have been laid bare by the GFC to such an extent that it may be 
difficult to recall that until quite recently it was the flaws of credit officers and 
supervisors that preoccupied regulators. The market vigilantes were assumed 
to be less forgiving than credit officers and bank executives. Back when Basle 
II was developing, corporate and securities fraud was the pressing concern. 
During the 1980s and 1990s, fraud featured in a number of salacious sto-
ries. In America, the savings-and-loan debacle exposed improper behavior and 
accounting—often with a political dimension.15 Crony capitalism was rife. In 
Canada, there was the Bre-X mining stock scandal in the mid-1990s. Australia 
had the Pyramid Building Society bust of 1990. In the UK there was the 1987 
Blue Arrow Affair. The riveting case of Morgan Grenfell’s rogue asset manager, 
Peter Young also had the British public enthralled.16
15One of the most notorious cases was Charles Keating’s Lincoln Savings-and-loan 
Association, whose failure in April 1989 cost the US Government $3.4 billion. Large, 
concentrated, speculative real estate investments contributed to the fast growth and 
subsequent failure of the institution. In 1986, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) 
found that his S&L had $135 million in unreported losses and had surpassed the regulated 
direct investments limit by $600 million. Mr. Keating tried to thwart the FHLBB in several 
ways. He commissioned the then private economist, Alan Greenspan, to write a study 
which concluded that direct investments were benign. He tried to hire FHLBB members 
or their wives. He finagled the appointment by President Reagan of his friend and debtor, 
Lee H. Henkel Jr., to the FHLBB. He recruited help from a group of US senators who 
later became known as the Keating Five: Alan Cranston, Dennis DeConcini, John Glenn, 
Donald Riegle, and the only Republican of the group, Senator John McCain. It is alleged 
that Mr. Keating made political contributions of about $1.3 million to this group and that 
Senator McCain and his family were treated to several trips using the firm’s private jet 
and to Mr. Keating’s private retreat in the Bahamas.
16Peter Young, an Oxford math graduate, joined Morgan Grenfell in 1992 and rose rapidly 
through the ranks. Two years later, he took over the European Growth Trust Funds. The 
funds reported strong performance from investments in a number of small-technology 
stocks, attracting more inflows. Mr. Young rapidly acquired rock-star status, which he 
greatly enjoyed. When one of the companies he had invested in came under investigation 
by the American SEC, internal suspicions were raised. Investigations revealed that Mr. 
Young had orchestrated a complex system of mirrored investments to conceal his large 
investments in obscure high-tech businesses, including his personal company, many of 
which had gone sour. He was able to falsify the fund’s performance because the stocks 
were unquoted so valuations were not based on a market price. The fraud case took 
a further turn to the sensational when Mr. Young turned up at his trial at the City of 
London Magistrates’ Court wearing a scarlet blouse and matching tight skirt and insisted 
on being addressed as “Beth.” He later attempted to castrate himself and in 2002 was 
deemed unfit to stand trial. Deutsche Bank reportedly lost about £400 million as a result 
of the affair and subsequently dropped the Morgan Grenfell name that it had bought as 
part of a $1.48 billion acquisition in 1989.

For bank supervisors, “marketization” was the future of banking and the future 
looked brighter than the murky past. The marketization of banking was not 
so much a conspiracy directly hatched by the “gnomes of Zurich” as by the 
gnomes of Basel.17 It was integral to their approach to banking and cemented 
in the European Capital Requirement Directive and the new International 
Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards (Basel II).
This vision of market-sensitive regulation was swathed in the political zeitgeist 
of the 1980s and 1990s. The consensus was that the state had overreached itself 
during in the prior two decades. Through deregulation and privatization, the 
correct balance would be restored. Prime Minister Thatcher’s election in 1979 
and President Reagan in 1980 are often cited as the turning point in this politi-
cal thinking. However, its genesis was much earlier and lasted long after they 
had demitted office. Cold economic logic alone cannot create seismic politi-
cal shifts. For that kind of movement there must be the additional ­ingredient 
of passionate belief. The zeal for privatization went beyond the economics of 
defining certain government activities as really commercial and better suited to 
private ownership. It was driven by an increasingly held faith in the democratiz-
ing influence and financial discipline of markets and the ­market price.
The privatization of government and the marketization of banking were flip 
sides of the same coin. Without acknowledging this context, it would be hard 
to explain why banking regulators had fashioned a regulatory regime that 
placed market prices at its core, when tackling market failure should have 
been the main organizing principle. Earlier in Chapter 2, I argued that the prin-
cipal reason we regulate the banking system over and above standard corpo-
rate regulation is because markets fail. There is, of course, a legitimate debate 
on where the boundary, or the lace, lies between laissez faire and intervention. 
Across a wide spectrum of activities, market discipline offers many benefits, 
but it would be a rare circumstance, when relying more on markets was the 
solution to a natural market failure.18
The preeminent role of market prices in the measurement, reporting and 
control of risk is reflected in the last couple booms. As the asset values rose, 
and the market price of risks fell, regulatory standards and mechanisms did 
not constrain bank lending or force a tightening of lending standards. Instead  
the opposite happened. Banks were incentivized to redouble what was later 
seen as imprudent lending. And later, when the value of assets fell and the 
17Of course banks and bankers played an important role in lobbying for the underlying 
approach embedded in Basle II. The irony of regulatory capture by bankers, helping to 
create a regulatory system that ultimately failed the banks and their shareholders was not 
lost on the Financial Times headline writer for my op-ed, “Banks Put Themselves At Risk In 
Basle,” Financial Times, October 16, 2002, reprinted at the end of this book.

markets.

price of risks rose, those same regulatory standards and mechanisms worked 
to keep banks from lending, reinforcing deflationary pressures. Mark-to-
market accounting definitely played a role in this behavior, but as an ­integrated 
­component of a wider set of mechanisms. However pleasing to bank ­regulators, 
the blame for the liquidity crisis cannot be laid entirely at the feet of accoun-
tants. Blame also rests at the shrine built to the market paradigm where regu-
lators, bankers and accountants met to worship.
Cheerleaders for the regulatory regime operating prior to the GFC ­comfort 
themselves with the thought that at least no one else saw the crisis was 
­coming. But inconveniently it was foreseen. There were warnings that the 
marketization of risks contained a Faustian bargain. Greater liquidity, lower-
risk premiums and the appearance of sophisticated risk management in quiet 
times happened at the expense of systemic liquidity when markets are under 
stress.19 The broader intellectual and political context allowed the gnomes of 
Basel to sweep aside these warnings.
En passant, there is an interesting unintended consequence of making market 
prices central to the management and control of risks and capital. When 
markets fail, liquidity disappears and the authorities are compelled to inter-
vene, they are now obligated to set a floor in the market price of the kind of 
assets they would not normally touch. The marketization of banking has been 
associated with a switch in the role of the central bank from lender of last 
resort for a handful of institutions to “buyer of last resort” for the markets.20 
As argued earlier, this is a far more arduous task.21 The levers of influence are 
diminished, unintended consequences widen and the space for important but 
delicate subtleties and nuances is lost.
19One general warning was contained in “An Academic Response to Basel II,” written by 
a raft of eminent thinkers in financial economics: Jon Danielsson, Paul Embrechts, Charles 
Goodhart, Con Keating, Felix Meunnich, Oliver Renault, and Hyun Song Shin. See Special 
Paper Series 130 (London: LSE Financial Markets Group, May 2001). There were others. 
A couple years prior to the paper above, I included a specific warning of the Faustian 
bargain between everyday trading liquidity at the expense of systemic liquidity in my 
paper “Sending the Herd off the Cliff Edge: How Modern Risk Management Systems 
and Investor Herds Create Risk,” (Jacques de Larosiere Awards in Global Finance, IIF, 
Washington, 2000).

The Perils of Homogeneity
Banking regulation has historically focused on identifying good practices at 
certain banks and then making these practices the standard to which all oth-
ers must comply.22 Protagonists of Basel II oddly boasted that the framework 
better aligned regulatory capital with what the best banks were doing. It is a 
poignant reminder of the power of the prevailing zeitgeist we discussed in 
the last section that they were blinded to the senselessness of that statement. 
Surely the aspiration of regulation is to push banks to a different point than 
they might otherwise arrive at and towards a framework for operation that 
will better incorporate the social externalities of banking, which, left unat-
tended, would lead to a state of calamitous failure. Because of the liquidity 
transformation and the quasi-money involved in bank deposits, banking is 
systemic. The banks’ focus on their private interests will lead them to under-
invest in systemic stability. We discussed this basic requirement for regulation 
in Chapters 2 and 3, and the notion of banking having social externalities is a 
well-traversed idea.23
I have discussed the dangerous procyclicality of giving the central role to mar-
ket prices in a variety of processes from assessment of risk, to valuation of 
assets, to risk management. What I would like to explore further in this sec-
tion is something related but separate—namely the deleterious effects on 
liquidity and stability of common behavior in financial markets. At the very 
heart of the approach of banking regulation was the faulty idea of creating 
more homogenous behavior by imposing common standards and rules.24 This 
common behavior was artificially created by the widespread adoption of the 
market price, and hence a single, common price, in the valuation of assets and 
their risks. However, as I discuss later, other regulatory initiatives can produce 
homogenous behavior and so it is important to appreciate the perils of homo-
geneity in general.

Practice (Chichester, UK: Wiley, 2004).
24There was a period after the Asian Financial Crisis in which financial policy makers 
thought that their main job was to self-evidently encode and enforce standards. For a 
while, the IMF thought it had found a new role as a vanguard of international codes and 
standards. See Benu Schneider, ed., The Road to International Financial Stability: Are Key 
Financial Standards the Answer? (Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave Macmillan, 2003).

A common mistake is to see measures of market size as synonymous with 
its liquidity. If a financial market has only two people but whenever one per-
son wants to buy an instrument, the other wants to sell it, the market is 
liquid. Imagine next a market with 1,000 participants all using the same invest-
ment universe, the same market data, the same best-practice, valuation, risk- 
management, and accounting systems and the same prudential controls based 
on published credit ratings. When one member wants to sell an instrument 
in response to these systems, so does everyone else. This is an illiquid mar-
ket. At any one time there will only be buyers or only sellers. An elementary 
prerequisite for liquidity is having buyers and sellers simultaneously. A market 
may be big in terms of the number of participants, but if at any one time it 
has primarily buyers or sellers, the thinner it is in terms of liquidity. Liquidity 
is about diversity.25
This tends to be an issue in times of market stress. During quiet times when 
markets seem directionless, they appear to exhibit good liquidity. However, 
this proved to be false liquidity. It is there when you do not need it and 
disappears when you do. When an event takes places that creates market 
stress and liquidity is most needed, these common rules and systems send 
all participants in the same direction and liquidity is drained. I call this false 
liquidity during the quiet times in markets “trading liquidity.” It is a concept  
well illustrated by the ever-tighter spreads between the prices at which traders 
buy and sell the same security.26 I term liquidity when the system is under 
stress “systemic liquidity” i.e. that liquidity available at times when short-term 
traders are all trying to swap assets for cash simultaneously.27
Outside of finance, common standards that lead to common behaviour are 
generally a good thing. You want your railways, electricity and gas companies 
to abide by common standards. Drivers should obey traffic lights, drive in the

Financial Liquidity Risk (London: Risk, 2003). See also Avinash Persaud, “Liquidity Black 
Holes” (Working Paper, State Street Bank, 2001).
26This is sometimes reflected in lower transaction costs, but the presence of a large 
number of high frequency traders looking to catch a trend can increase the market-
impact of trading which is often the largest component of transactions costs, often equal 
to bid-ask spreads, broking commissions, settlement and clearing fees and transaction 
taxes put together.
27I first drew this distinction in my explanation of different types of liquidity in a paper 
I cowrote with Marco Lagana, Martin Perina, and Isabel von Koppen-Mertes: “Implications 
for Liquidity from Innovation and Transparency” (Occasional Paper Series 50, Frankfurt am 
Main, Germany, European Central Bank, August 2006). This notion has been taken up by a 
number of others. See Anastasia Nesvetailova, Financial Alchemy in Crisis: The Great Liquidity 
Illusion (London: Pluto Press, 2010) and Jakob Vestergaard, “Crisis? What Crisis? Anatomy 
of the Regulatory Failure in Finance,” (DIIS Working Papers 2008/25, Copenhagen: Danish 
Institute for International Studies, 2008).

same direction and on the same side of the road. Using common terminology 
agglomerates activity and increases safety in everything from architecture to 
everyday conversation. It is no surprise, then, that bank regulators, who do not 
all have professional experience in the workings of financial markets, would 
be attracted to the benefits of a common standard.28 But finance is different. 
Homogeneity of behavior in financial markets will reduce systemic resilience. 
Heterogeneity strengthens it.29
The notion that liquidity requires diversity may at first appear counterintuitive—
especially to financial commentators who routinely confuse market capital-
ization or turnover with liquidity. How often have you heard the liquidity 
of the foreign exchange market extolled in the same breath as recent esti-
mates of total daily turnover in the market? However, it is a familiar idea in 
the literature on networks, big systems as well as microstructures whose 
resilience rests on diversity, or what some fields term redundancy. Systems 
and networks in which participants have identical tastes and responses are 
prone to collapse.30
First, the good news. Most societies contain enough routine diversity in terms 
of economic liabilities and assets for there to exist a substantial amount of 
systemic liquidity naturally and without trying. A pensioner, a young saver put-
ting aside money for a distant future, an insurance company and a charitable 
endowment all have varying objectives and divergent capacities for dissimilar 
risks. This diversity should be reflected in different valuation and risk manage-
ment systems. For example, an illiquid five-year bond backed by good collateral 
would be a risky asset for an investor funding her investment by borrowing 
and repaying the money every day—like a one-day cash deposit. However,  
as we have discussed at length in Chapters 5 and 6, it would be a safe asset for  
28Traders, whose status prior to the GFC was as “masters of the universe” and whose 
words were taken more seriously than they are today, also vigorously expounded the 
view that anything that caused “fragmentation” of markets was self-evidently evil.
29This was one of the messages of my paper “Sending the Herd off the Cliff Edge: How 
Modern Risk Management Systems and Investor Herds Create Risk,” (Jacques de Larosiere 
Awards in Global Finance, IIF, Washington, 2000) reprinted at the end of this volume.

an institution like a young pension fund with no cash commitments over the 
coming ten years. It is not just capital adequacy requirements that must vary. The 
risk management, valuation, and accounting systems used by institutions with 
overnight funding must be different from those used by long-term investors.31
The bad news is that the trend for employing the same valuation, account-
ing, and risk management rules artificially reduces this natural diversity and 
increases systemic fragility. Some of the special-purpose investment vehicles 
(SPVs and SIVs) that were forced to sell assets in the credit crunch were made 
to do so because of this homogeneity of standards. Their funding had not 
dried up but they were subjected to the common rules that all banks used.
One of the key lessons of the GFC is that a critical factor in systemic resilience 
is funding liquidity. When the system freezes, those with short-term funding 
topple over. Stability lies with those who have secured long-term funding. 
They are the risk absorbers. However, by using mark-to-market valuation in 
accounting, capital adequacy requirements and risk rules, regulators failed to 
make any distinctions between those with a funding liquidity issue and those 
without. They did not and do not currently differentiate the risk absorbers 
from the risk traders. Risk traders, or simply financial traders, move between 
different risks—ostensibly trying to find relative value though often simply 
following short-term trends. As a result of short-term funding these traders 
have limited capacity for holding onto a risk and carrying heavy losses. It is 
those with long-term funding liquidity, or long-term liabilities, who have the 
capacity to absorb market and liquidity risks. The absence of any distinction 
between risk traders and risk absorbers at the regulatory and accounting level 
led to a disproportionate growth in the number of risk traders in the financial 
system. The explosion of high frequency trading is also a part of that because 
the lowering of capital requirements for short-term liquid assets held on the 
trading book of banks gives a regulatory advantage to risk traders. The rise of 
risk traders who shuffle assets between each other most of the time, but look 
to drop them all and get to the exit before others in the bad times, gives the 
appearance of greater liquidity and lower transaction costs through greater 
31To illustrate this point “…Imagine a long-term investor called Felicity Foresight. Every 
year Felicity knows which are the ten best currency trades for the year and she puts 
them on at the beginning of the year and uses a state-of-the-art, daily mark-to-market, 
value-at-risk, risk-management system. Over the past ten years she would have lost money 
in almost every year, stopped-out by her risk-system when the trades had gone against 
her. Whatever you think your investment style is, it really is largely determined by your 
risk-management system. Investors proudly proclaim a raft of different styles, models, 
approaches, but the vast majority adopt the same risk management approach and so they 
behave like everybody else, leading to little diversity and many black holes.” in Avinash 
Persaud, Liquidity Black Holes, UNU/WIDER, Discussion Paper No. 2002/31, March 2002,

trading turnover and finer dealing spreads. This provides some political cover 
for the preponderance of these traders. However, all along, systemic liquidity 
is deteriorating and the financial system is becoming more fragile. Evidence of 
this is the increasing number of large price movements that are big enough 
for some investors to lose substantial sums, before they can reverse like the 
“Flash Crash” of May 2010.32
The fundamental systemic problem with the originate, rate and relocate 
model was not the deceptiveness of the bankers or rating agencies and their 
conflicts of interest. That was a problem but was one that could have been 
addressed by microprudential regulation. The fundamental problem was that 
a disparate group of market participants, borrowers, creditors, and investors, 
by using common valuation, accounting, credit rating, market risk systems and 
prudential controls, ended up behaving homogenously in times of stress. They 
were either only buyers or only sellers of risk at the same time. There were 
numerous players involved in trading, which the authorities mistook for a 
greater spread of risk, but there was little functional diversity. Risk is about 
behavior. Appearing to spread risk from a few, well-known, disparate players, 
to a large number of players, behaving homogenously, concentrates risk.33
Reintroducing and Developing Diversity in a 
Financial System
In this chapter, and more at length in Chapters 5 and 6, I have discussed the 
importance of maintaining a diversity of liabilities or funding in the develop-
ment of financial market liquidity. There are several ways in which financial 
diversity has been artificially and erroneously reduced and in which it can also 
be preserved, protected or even reintroduced.
32On May 6, 2010, at 2:30 p.m., the S&P 500 Index fell almost 600 points before recovering 
a few hours later. 21,000 trades were eventually cancelled because it was felt this 
movement was not legitimate and a new rule imposed that stopped trading whenever a  
stock fell by more than 10% in any five minute window. In Liquidity Black Holes:  What They 
Are and How They Are Generated, published in the Singapore Foreign Exchange Market 
Committee’s Biennial Report, 2001–2002, Singapore, I develop a statistical test for 
liquidity black holes that reveal how much the equity markets have become more prone 
to this behavior over time.
33For an early critique of how risks were being spread and yet concentrated, see Avinash 
Persaud, “Credit Derivatives, Insurance Companies and Liquidity Black Holes,” Geneva 
Papers on Risk and Insurance 29, no. 2, April 2004, pp. 300–12.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
127
Regulators’ adoption of credit ratings as a measuring tool for credit risk on 
bank balance sheets reduced diversity and in the process undermined good 
banking. A good bank lends to some that others will not, based on its superior 
credit knowledge. It does not lend to some that others will lend to, again based 
on superior credit knowledge. The originate, rate and relocate model works 
against this. Modern lending and investing by banks or shadow banks is done 
using common, public data, and public ratings.34 If banks and investors are not 
incentivized to be deeply knowledgeable about the credits that one of them 
quickly resells to the other, they will not invest in doing so. Under the business 
model that regulators pushed on the industry in the name of transparency and 
standardization, the profit opportunities for the insiders versus the investors 
are where the common rating system initially overvalues a credit. No surprise 
then that when the credit derivative instruments packaged and sold by banks 
to investors began to fail investors were shocked about the underlying risks 
of these instruments, triggering even greater risk aversion and a big stampede 
for the exit.
Greater diversity in how institutions lend would strengthen resilience. More 
diversity in how others invest in loans repackaged as securities would also 
strengthen resilience. But this diversity is being narrowed, ironically, in the 
name of effective regulation. During the GFC, there was much moaning about 
too many gaps in regulation across countries, institutions and instruments. 
Many believed it was these gaps that undermined regulation.35 If only we could 
close these loopholes, they said, regulation would work. They see the crisis as 
resulting from unfettered finance. We need more regulation they argued and 
we must have a common regulatory system across all countries, states, institu-
tions and instruments. I recognise the good intentions of those who hold this 
view, and there is no shortage of instances of inadequate regulation. However, 
I am cautious about some of the proposed solutions. We have to acknowledge 
that most of the behaviour during the GFC was incentivized to occur because 
of the existing regulation. It is misguided to argue about whether more or 
less regulation is required before we have better regulation. It is proven that 
commonality in finance holds systemic dangers. We need high standards but 
not ones that generate common behaviour. Diversity is not the enemy of 
the financial system. It is the savior. This includes diversity of institutions and 
instruments. In the next chapter we shall examine instruments. For the rest 
of this section, we will examine how to preserve the diversity of institutions.
34Given the oligopolistic industry of credit ratings, there is also little diversity in individual 
ratings or the general direction of ratings.
35For an excellent balanced articulation of this view, see Richard B. Freeman, “Reforming 
the United States’ Economic Model After the Failure of Unfettered Financial Capitalism,” 
Chicago-Kent College Law Review, 85, no. 685 (2010).

The crisis has been the occasion for renewed calls to implement greater 
regulation of nonbank institutions that appear to be conducting banking busi-
ness like hedge funds and money market funds. Europe has been particularly 
vocal regarding hedge funds. In the United States there is more concern about 
money market funds, high-frequency traders and even asset managers. In the 
case of hedge funds, the motivation behind regulation is a reflection of an 
unhelpful conflation of issues.
Big commercial banks, especially those that do not lend to, or trade with, hedge 
funds, caution that if they are subject to unduly onerous regulation, banking 
will simply flow to the nonbanks. This would create new and unforeseen risks. 
The issues here are regulatory but they also involve competition. Since hedge 
funds are private, focused on outperforming other investors, they are secre-
tive and usually closed or by invitation only. This secrecy can harbor decep-
tions, unethical and even illegal behavior. In a case that typifies these concerns, 
the US Securities and Exchange Commission, on July 19th, 2013, charged 
leading hedge fund manager, Steven Cohen, with rewarding employees with a 
$9 million bonus for trades that should instead have raised internal suspicions 
of insider trading. It has been suggested that Mr. Cohen was able to reward 
the behavior and reap the profits for his firm because of the hedge fund’s lack 
of transparency. Further, in the GFC, the authorities felt that hedge funds were 
establishing “short positions” and spreading negative rumors about certain 
financial stocks. It was assumed they were doing this in order to drive these 
stocks down to the point where the covenants with their lenders would force 
an issue of further equity, which would in turn validate the lower share prices 
and generate profits from the shorts.36
This perspective on hedge funds ought to be softened a little by the observa-
tion that not all should be tarred with the same brush. Secrecy can also harbor 
baseless rumors. We often assume the worst when we are ignorant of the 
truth—which is why more transparency is generally good. Governments have 
a long history of disproportionately blaming foreign speculators for local dif-
ficulties. And lest we forget, there is no shortage of poor behavior from public, 
collective, investment funds such as mutual funds and unit trusts.37 Moreover, it 
is illegal to undermine market integrity with false rumors. Mandatory report-
ing of trades and disclosure of beneficial owners makes getting away with 
illegal behavior harder today than ever before. 
36On September 18, 2008, acting in concert with the UK’s FSA, the US SEC responded to 
these concerns by prohibiting short selling the stock of financial companies.
37See Footnote 11 in this chapter. For further stories of the misselling of pension plans, 
deceitful hyping of stock recommendations by conflicted analysts, and market timing 
abuses by public fund providers, see Avinash Persaud and John Plender, Ethics and Finance 
(London: Longtail, 2007).

Reinventing Financial Regulation
129
We implore and assume that regulators effectively enforce existing laws on 
disclosures, insider trading, market abuse and all else and we ask if, with that 
condition, nonbanks should be regulated in the same manner as banks. An 
unleveraged hedge fund that invests the equity of its shareholders has limited 
spillover effects. It is like a nondeposit-taking bank with a 100 percent equity-
to-loan ratio. As a result it is not a systemically dangerous activity. If the share-
holders of such funds are restricted to the wealthy who can afford to lose 
their shirt on an investment without jeopardizing their livelihood, then hedge 
funds could play an important stabilizing role in markets. Financial market 
liquidity needs losers. We need people prepared to buy when everyone else 
is selling, taking a short-term loss in the belief that the market will soon turn 
and they will profit handsomely from going against the tide. Who should the 
potential losers be? Should it be Aunt Agatha’s pension fund, George Soros, 
Steven Cohen, or Lewis Bacon?38 Private equity funds potentially provide a 
similar stabilizing role, purchasing companies undervalued by the public mar-
kets, perhaps as a result of their preferences, constraints, and restrictions, and 
selling overvalued ones.
The systemic risk of nonbanks like hedge funds, private equity, and money mar-
ket funds should be addressed by limiting leverage. It must also be made clear 
to those putting money in these nonbank institutions that they are investors 
not creditors. They must be able and prepared to lose all and be aware that 
these institutions do not carry deposit insurance. We should regulate who 
can buy into a hedge fund to ensure this is the case. These non-bank institu-
tions get their leverage from banks, and this supply can be limited through 
regulations on bank lending. While we must ensure that laws are followed by 
all, that consequences for not doing so are prohibitive, and that reporting is 
full and prompt, we must be very careful to ensure that regulation does not, in 
the name of levelling playing fields, restrict a diversity of views, trading strate-
gies, and risk appetite. If we want a resilient financial system we need diversity. 
A Different Approach to Value Accounting
The diversity that matters is not what institutions are called, not what sectors 
they may appear to be in, and not the different investment styles and objec-
tives they may claim to follow.  We need behavioural diversity. To have genuinely 
diverse behavior, in a world that generally shares the same information, we 
need a value accounting system that is better at linking the value of an asset to 
various holders and to their divergent risks of holding that asset. Below, I will 
describe a system of value accounting that dovetails with the system of capital 
adequacy regulation we described in Chapters 5 and 6.

If you are desperate for cash and must sell your house tomorrow, the price you 
will achieve will be different from the price you would get if you could wait to 
find the buyer who particularly wants your house. What if the house is not on 
the market but an assessment of your current assets and liabilities is required 
in order to decide how to better balance them? Which price should be used 
for valuation? This conundrum acknowledges that at any one time the same 
asset can have different but equally legitimate values. Critically, the determining 
feature of the most appropriate price depends as much on how the asset is 
funded as the asset itself. An equity portfolio purchased with short-term funds 
is quite a different beast from one purchased with long-term funds.
Accountants, regulators and politicians find the idea that the same asset can 
be priced differently by different people, disorienting and self-evidently wrong. 
Regulators have been known to complain when they see banks valuing the 
same assets and risks dissimilarly. But it is the regulators who are mistaken. 
Diversions in valuation of the same asset may be the result of the ­contrasting 
ways in which the asset is funded. Accountants and regulators commit a fun-
damental error believing that there is something called risk that looks the 
same no matter who is holding it. The riskiness of an instrument depends on 
who is holding it and why, how it was funded and their response to changes in 
its short-term price. Perhaps in 1954, when Harry Markovitz39 was pioneering 
the mapping of volatility for different assets, when the savings markets were 
slim and instruments were infrequently traded, risk was inherent in the type 
of assets held. Today, deep markets for savers, real-time prices, high-frequency 
trading, common data, cheap computing power and self-feeding cycles make 
risk much more about behavior than ever before. The current application of 
finance and accounting theory has not kept pace with this change.
Valuing things has troubled economists since the discipline began. Economics 
has always recognized that the value-in-use of a good to one individual may 
not be the same for another person. Trading only happens when people value 
the same good differently from each other thus creating the opportunity for 
39At the RAND Corporation in California, Harry Markovitz and his associate George 
Dantzig were the developers of what became known as the “efficient,” or the Markovitz 
frontier between risk and return, where risk was defined as price volatility. Markovitz 
had the algorithm and Dantzig had the computing power. Markovitz won the 1990 Nobel 
Prize in Economics for his contributions to finance and portfolio theory. The frontier 
was presented as static, and generations of finance practitioners have been taught to 
think of it as if it were so. In “Sending the Herd off the Cliff Edge” (2000), I argued that 
in the age of costless information, computing power, real-time prices and trading, and 
public pressure on investors for relative outperformance, the observation of the risk-
return frontier in the past, changes investment behavior today. This in turn changes 
the risk-return frontier tomorrow and makes the past risk return frontier possible to 
observe but not to achieve.

a mutually beneficial swap. For convenience, value was linked to price through 
the mechanism of exchange. For an accountant or a regulator, it is obviously 
easier to have a single price for an asset. In truth many goods are infrequently 
traded, if at all,40 and many people will value the same product differently.
Mark-to-market is the price that an asset would achieve were it sold tomor-
row. It is the price on exchange. But for the corporate pension-fund investing 
for the next 20 years, the price to be considered is related to the current 
value of an asset that, with some risk and uncertainty, will deliver a particular 
value in 20 years time. The influences on that long-run price today are often 
quite unlike those acting on today’s price. For instance, today’s market price 
will be strongly related to the general demand for cash and the ability to 
quickly realize the asset for cash. At times of financial stress, illiquid assets will 
see their price fall far. What we term the long-run price would ignore these 
issues. Price would instead reflect an assessment of the risks and uncertainties 
attached to the value of the asset in 20 years time when today’s volatility or 
the intervening series of booms and crashes are long forgotten.
If a corporate pension fund requires market prices to be used to assess its 
solvency, and it follows a regulatory regime demanding a higher level of cash 
should solvency based on market prices dip below a certain level, the fund’s 
investments would tend to be confined to assets that exhibited low, short-run 
price volatility. This would effectively force long-term investors to behave as 
if they are short-term market participants lacking the resources to endure 
volatile, temporary shifts in liquidity and market price. Consequently, they are 
unable to earn the liquidity premium available to long-term investors who can 
lock up cash in illiquid and volatile investments. This is a huge loss for pen-
sioners who are ironically the very group regulators claim to be protecting. 
Existing and upcoming regulatory pressures to use mark-to-market pricing of 
assets and risks is forcing long-term institutions to earn a credit risk premium 
by taking credit risks they have limited capacity to hedge. Alternatively, they 
demand higher customer contributions than would be unnecessary were they 
earning the liquidity premium by safely taking on the risks they have capacity 
to hedge over the long term.
Furthermore, as already noted, when the financial system experiences a shock 
and the banks, with their short-term funding, are forced to sell assets, the 
system is safer if long-term investors are able to view these assets in terms of 
their long-term cash flows and not solely based on their short-term market  
conditions. Forcing long-term investors to behave like banks will oblige

them to sell assets at the same time as the banks, resulting in systemic fragility.  
Systemic resilience requires the presence of investors who can value an 
asset differently, so that when one is selling, the other is buying. The different 
requirements of short and long-term funding provide a genuine capacity to 
price an asset differently.
How could we achieve that? There are broadly two methods to estimating 
the current price of an asset, beyond simply using the historic cost. First, 
there is the discounted cash flow approach closely related to the traditional 
value-in-use notion. By estimating the future cash flows of an investment, and 
taking into account future risks and uncertainty by discounting these cash 
flows (typically by using the weighted-average cost of capital), it is possible to 
establish a net present value of an asset. Any investment funded by long-term 
liabilities41 could be measured using this approach. The valuation of future cash 
flows could be carried out by a third party so that the absence of a traded 
price does not mean the pricing is biased. How long the funding or liabilities 
need to be to justify this approach is not clear. What is essential is that it is 
long enough to be able to weather temporary dips in liquidity and market 
prices. Most financial crises are sharp but short, over within 6 to 24 months. 
The effects of the GFC have lingered far longer. A conservative approach 
would be to limit this valuation of assets to those that are funded or backed 
by liabilities with a maturity greater than 36 months.
The alternative approach is the market price approach, that is, using the asset 
price if it were sold tomorrow. Any asset funded by liabilities maturing in 
less than 6 months should be priced this way. A weighted average of the two 
approaches could be used for assets with funding between 6 and 36 months.  
It would be cumbersome and inflexible to match each asset with its own funding.  
However, pools of assets can be matched to either pools of short-term  
funding or pools of long-term funding with a maturities greater than 36 months.  
Assets can be switched between pools. All that matters is that the assets you 
will have to sell if your short-term funding is not rolled over are valued on 
the basis that they may be sold tomorrow. Those assets that you do not need 
to sell overnight because they are matched with long-term funding, must be 
priced on the basis of their long-term cash flows. I call this approach, which 
I first introduced back in 2008, “mark-to-funding.”42
41An example of an asset funded by long-term liabilities is the purchase of a house  
(the asset) with a mortgage (the liability) that does not need to be repaid for 30 years.  
The maturity of this funding/liability is 30 years.

Mark-to-funding is not an easy choice. In the GFC, banks that could not have 
survived another day without public injections of liquidity were allowed to 
claim that they were holding assets to maturity. This facilitated pricing of these 
assets based on historic costs, which, in many cases, was far higher than the 
current market price. The positive effect of this on the reporting of bank 
balance sheets was offset by the negative effect of investor uncertainty over 
when the assets would or could be sold and at what price. Under mark-to-
funding, the banks would have to price these assets in relation to the maturity 
of their funding which in most cases is short-term. Mark-to-funding helps 
because it moderates a crisis through natural rather than artificial means. On 
a mark-to-funding basis, long-term savers would find that the assets being sold 
by the banks had become cheap and buying them cheaply would boost their 
solvency. This would arrest the vicious cycle of asset price decline triggering 
fresh selling. Mark-to-funding would incentivize and reward banks that have 
more long-term funding. During a crisis, it would allow banks to match those 
assets that had fallen the most and where the risks had risen mainly because 
of short-term factors with pools of long-term funding. This would limit the 
sale of the most troubled assets in an already-weakened market that would 
only aggravate collective losses. Banks would then need to raise less cash and 
would be able to do so by selling their most liquid and highly priced assets.
Accounting Treatment of Long-Term Savings 
Institutions
We have rehearsed the underlying point that institutions with different liabili-
ties should value assets differently a few times in this and previous chapters. 
This is a radical idea and since many readers think more about bank regula-
tion than insurance regulation, it is worth drilling down specifically to how 
this would work for long-term savings institutions. There is an understandable 
instinct to shield individual savers, particularly the elderly, dependent on pen-
sions or insurance policies. At the same time, pension funds and insurance 
companies can only generate returns for their members by taking some risk. 
The regulatory approach should not be about stopping pension funds and 
insurance firms from taking risks, but about how to ensure they take appropri-
ate risks. Too often, appropriate risk is wrongly equated as low or moderate 
risk. In Chapter 6 we showed how appropriate risk-taking is supervisory code 
for taking less of the kind of risks that are most appropriate for long-term 
investors to take. In our approach it means taking those risks that are best 
absorbed.
It is my contention that the valuation rules embedded in regulation, and not 
just the capital adequacy requirements but also the accounting standards are 
pushing pension and life insurance funds and sometimes sovereign wealth 
funds to take the wrong kind of investment risk. It is exposing these funds 

Chapter 8 | How Accounting, Credit, and Risk Standards Create Risk   
134
and their customers to inappropriate danger. In thinking about what the right 
kind of investment risk is for pension and insurance funds to take, we must 
review the nature of risk. Recall that there is not one kind of financial risk but 
several, and that “riskiness” has less to do with instruments and more to do 
with behavior. Risk is a chameleon. A “risky” instrument held by a bank may be 
a “safe” instrument if held by a pension fund. In Chapters 5 and 6, we discussed 
in depth the three types of risk that financial institutions are most exposed 
to: market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. The way to diversify market and 
liquidity risk is through time. The more time available, because the funding or 
liabilities are long term, the more the institution can ride out passing periods 
of illiquidity or price volatility. But having more time does not allow you to 
hedge credit risks, because the risk of a credit defaulting rises the more time 
there is for the default to take place. A young pension fund or life insurance 
company has the ability to earn the market and liquidity premium but not 
the credit risk premia. It should therefore invest in high-quality credits that 
offer higher yields because they have low liquidity and experience short-term 
market volatility.
What pension and life insurers should avoid is investing in highly liquid instru-
ments and low-volatility instruments with large credit premia. In doing so, they 
are paying—through foregone returns—for a liquidity and short-term stabil-
ity they do not require. They are also earning a premium for a risk they have 
little natural ability to hedge because of their long-term liabilities. Yet this is 
precisely the path they are being driven down by mark-to-market, valuation, 
risk, and other market-price-driven regulatory standards. A pension fund is 
required to match the duration and value of its assets to its liabilities, value 
its assets as if they will be sold tomorrow and earn a high yield. It can only 
do so by raising premiums or buying liquid instruments with poor credit. This 
is one of the reasons for the relatively strong demand for ultra-long-dated 
corporate and emerging-market sovereign debt. The loser in this unnatural 
asset allocation is the pensioner or the insured, not the consultants, actuaries, 
and managers.
Banks were also pushed toward the wrong kind of risks. A bank has short-
term funding. It follows that it has little capacity for liquidity and market risks. 
However, it has ample capacity for credit risks as an expert in credit origi-
nation and, through origination activity, is able to actively source and hedge 
across a variety of credit risks. Yet, what did banks do prior to 2008? They sold 
their credit risk to pension funds and funded private equity and hedge funds 
that were effectively taking liquidity and market risk. Both of these examples 
of inappropriate risk taking—pension funds and life insurers eschewing illiquid 
instruments and banks pursuing these instruments—created a net reduction 
in systemic liquidity.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
135
Mark-to-funding will help to change that. It allows long-term institutions to 
maintain customers’ contribution levels while reducing their actual risk by 
opting out of of those risks they are less able to value and absorb. This means 
not touching long-dated corporate credit risk and switching to, for exam-
ple, diversified, quoted, and private equity portfolios. It prevents banks hiding 
shrunken assets behind the notion of holding to maturity and rewards them 
for embracing longer-term funding.
A measure of the misunderstanding of risk in the current regulation of long-term 
savings institutions is the heaping together of both life insurance and general or 
casualty insurance in insurance regulation and accounting. The risk-absorptive 
capacities of these two types of insurance are markedly different. A life insurer, 
that actuaries estimate will need a payout in the distant future, has a capacity 
to absorb liquidity and market risks. It cannot take credit risks that rise the 
more time there is for a credit default to take place. From both an economic 
and investment sense life insurance companies should keep a significant part 
of their investment portfolio in public and private equities and in illiquid but 
asset-backed, or partial government-guaranteed, securities.43 Unfortunately, 
these are often the very type of securities that are discouraged through capi-
tal charges or unapproved for the purposes of “regulatory capital”.
A casualty insurer needs near-immediate access to liquidity. It has limited 
absorptive capacity for liquidity and market risks. Liquid instruments should 
dominate its investment portfolio, with diversification across short-maturity 
credits to boost their returns. Even minority exposures to illiquid or volatile 
assets, often a key part of the insurer¢s strategies for earning above-average 
returns, should be avoided. The current one-size-fits-all approach of insurers, 
using price volatility as the principal measure of risk on the asset side does 
not take into account the maturity of liabilities and makes no economic or 
investment sense. If we think an insurer or pension fund’s risk as the likelihood 
of a short fall in the investment portfolio when it is needed, then the current 
regime makes insurance and pension funds riskier than they should be. 
Conclusion
This chapter has emphasized the value of diversity and argued that the pursuit  
of liquidity and systemic resilience is furthered if institutions with different 
liabilities or funding are allowed to behave differently and in accordance 
with their individual risk-absorbing capacity. Chapters 5 and 6 showed that 
natural diversity in liabilities exists and must be allowed to lead to diversity 
43See Chapter 6.

Chapter 8 | How Accounting, Credit, and Risk Standards Create Risk

in behavior. To artificially suppress this diversity at the altar of common 
accounting standards, risk management approaches, or equal treatment of 
institutions, will undermine systemic liquidity and financial resilience. An 
institution’s capacity to absorb risks is not its appetite or mood for risk, 
which is how risk is haphazardly allocated today. It is something embedded 
in the very structure of its liabilities.
Several market participants publicly claim to be looking for long-term value. 
Yet their value accounting, risk management and investment processes mean 
they act short-term. Under stress, these supervisor-approved systems cause 
diverse market players to act in the same way, killing liquidity and amplifying 
the crisis. This is entirely artificial. It makes little investment and economic 
sense. Risk management and value accounting systems, such as mark-to-fund-
ing, that take into account the fact that the risk of an instrument is linked to 
the liabilities of its holder, will allow the natural heterogeneity of the financial 
system to be present in a crisis, moderating its sharpness and speeding up 
its end.

What to Do 
About Complex 
Financial 
Instruments 
In 2014, at €700 trillion, the notional amount of outstanding derivative ­ 
contracts that were traded over the counter1 exceeded the size of the under-
lying cash markets by more than five times. This goes against the better instincts 
of many outside the financial sector. It seems an unnatural state where the tail 
is wagging the dog. None other than the successful investor Warren Buffet 
famously wrote in the 2002 annual report of his investment vehicle, Berkshire 
Hathaway, “In my view, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, 
carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.”2 When suspi-
cions over the lethal nature of derivatives were seemingly vindicated by the

1Derivative contracts traded over the counter refer to those financial contracts whose 
value is derived from the value of equity, credit, interest rates, and currency instruments 
and are not traded on a public exchange but between two different firms or individuals.
2In testimony to the US House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and 
Governance Reform on November 12, 2008, another accomplished investor, George 
Soros, commented about derivatives: “The risks involved are not always fully understood, 
even by sophisticated investors, and I am one of them.”

central role credit derivatives played in the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the 
popular image of the financial crisis that we painted earlier in Chapters 3 and 
4 was of bankers pulling smoking, toxic credit instruments out of their back 
pockets. These instruments were thrown into a crowd of bewildered consum-
ers and the bankers were last seen grabbing the money and sprinting away. The 
argument was made that the time had come to ban the use of these weapons 
of mass destruction.
More prosaically, others believe that the business model of banks involves 
taking advantage of asymmetric information, that is, overcharging clients for 
complex instruments that are far more complex and opaque than required 
or can be reasonably understood.3 Investors, nursing heavy losses following 
the meltdown of the credit markets in 2008–9, paraded fat prospectuses that 
were weighted down with reams of impenetrable legalese on the subject of 
credit derivative instruments they had purchased and that was before getting 
to the small print. How, they asked, could anyone be realistically expected to 
understand it all? While it may seem incredulous that professional investors 
bought instruments they did not fully understand, they also alleged that there 
was deliberate misinformation. In April 2010, the SEC brought a charge against 
Goldman Sachs for defrauding investors by misstating and omitting key facts in 
the case of the Abacus credit derivative product.4
3One champion of this view is Joseph Stiglitz, who won the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics 
for his work on information asymmetries. This is well illustrated by the 1994 case of 
Bankers Trust and Procter & Gamble. Bankers Trust sold Procter & Gamble a derivative 
contract where it would pay Procter considerable sums if its bet that US and German 
interest rates would continue falling came right. Conversely, Procter would have to pay 
considerable sums to Bankers Trust if the bet went against them. The contract was highly 
complex and leveraged. Small changes in interest rates could chalk up heavy payments. 
After the US Federal Reserve began raising interest rates in February 1994, Procter quickly 
amassed losses of over $150 million on the contract. Procter then sued Bankers Trust for 
selling it an instrument that they claimed they could not be expected to understand. Edwin 
Artzt, Chairman of Procter & Gamble, was quoted in the New York Times on 14 April 
1994 proclaiming that, “Derivatives like these are dangerous and we were badly burned. 
We won’t let it happen again.”
4In a press release of April 16th, 2010, the US SEC alleged that the marketing materials for 
Abacus, structured and marketed by Goldman, indicated that the portfolio of mortgage 
instruments underlying the credit derivative obligation, or CDO, was selected by an 
independent expert in the credit risk of mortgages—the ACA Management. However, 
according to the SEC, in a clear and undisclosed conflict of interest, the Paulson hedge 
fund, which had taken out positions in the CDO that would allow it to benefit if the 
mortgage portfolio defaulted, played a significant role in selecting which mortgages should 
make up the portfolio. Gordon Gekko, it seems, had nothing on John Paulson.

Following the GFC, and indeed almost every financial crisis, financial innova-
tion is viewed with suspicion. It becomes almost a byword for egregious profi-
teering by wily bankers at the expense of innocent customers. It is no surprise, 
that there is a loud clamor for the implementation of radical changes as to 
what financial instruments can be traded, how they are traded, and how they 
are treated once traded. This is considered essential for ­consumer protection 
and upholding the integrity of financial markets.
Here we will reexamine that debate from the added perspective of systemic 
resilience. With this in mind, one extra concern is the rise of over-the-counter 
(OTC) derivative instruments especially in the credit markets over the past 
two decades. This has contributed to the widening gap between gross and net 
exposures. A bank may sell $1 billion of financial insurance to protect a buyer 
against General Motors defaulting on its debts and then buy $970 million of 
the same financial insurance. It earns brokerage fees on gross transactions  
of $1.97 billion but only runs a modest net exposure in the event of a default of 
$30 million, or 1.5 percent of the gross exposure. Normally it is net exposure 
that matters. These are a small fraction of gross exposures and they appear 
to be a more sustainable ratio of the size of the underlying cash markets. 
However, in crisis mode, when panic is inescapable, rumors create uncertainty 
over the ability of the counterparties to these transactions to honor their 
side of the commitments. It is then that gross exposures loom large. Today 
these gross exposures have reached a size where they can easily ­swallow any 
financial institution.
In the case of the Lehman Brothers default in September 2008, the gross 
notional volume of derivative credit contracts that triggered payments was 
estimated to be $400 billion. In the aftermath of Lehman’s collapse, the money 
markets froze, liquidity disappeared and panic set in that many counterparties 
would not be around to fulfill their side of these contracts. At this point losses 
could indeed have been close to $400 billion at Lehman and much more 
elsewhere. Years later, when the crisis had abated and bilateral trades among 
counterparties were netted out and the differences honored, the actual net 
exposure was a payout of only $6 billon.5 My point here is that small net 
exposures belie the systemic nature of the problem. Unless mitigated, the gap 
between gross and net exposures in the derivative markets represents, and is 
a measure of, the size of a systemic risk when market’s freeze.
In response to such concerns, politicians have contemplated aloud the possibil-
ity of banning some derivatives. They have also voiced concern as to whether 
all instruments should be publicly traded. Should new derivative products be 
subjected to regulatory approval before being offered for sale—even on the

default on their website.

wholesale markets? Bankers have predictably opposed these proposals. They 
argue that such restrictions would strangle capital markets, creating “miss-
ing markets” causing welfare losses. Additionally, manufacturing and exporting 
companies would experience increased costs of hedging their revenues or 
liabilities as a result of interest rate swings, fluctuating foreign exchange or 
commodities prices. These higher costs may encourage them not to hedge, 
thereby adding to financial risks. Ably supported by their bankers, execu-
tives from the airline industry have pleaded with the EU Parliament and US 
Congress to have derivative contracts for hedging jet fuel prices exempt from 
regulations requiring these contracts to be centrally cleared. They cite studies 
indicating that central clearing could add as much as 10–20 percent to the 
cost of the hedge—a cost they must pass on to the airlines’ customers.
Regulators have sought a middle road. The emerging regulatory framework 
for OTC derivatives being promoted by the Financial Stability Board does 
not seek to ban all instruments or force them all onto exchanges.6 Its three-
pronged approach attempts to: (a) improve transparency by mandating the 
reporting of all trades, (b) end market abuse behavior, and (c) reduce sys-
temic risk by requiring vanilla derivative options to be centrally cleared and 
exchange traded. Where they are not centrally cleared holders of these 
derivatives would be compelled to have minimum levels of cash against their 
exposures. Is this a compromise born of weakness toward the industry or 
emerging from populist pressure? What are the fundamental principles that 
should guide reaching the right balance? These questions are the subject of 
this chapter.
Political Pressures Postcrash
The GFC created two very different groups of zeros. Workers at the bot-
tom of the employment ladder were forced to accept new, zero-hours con-
tracts with no guarantee of future hours or pay.7 Financial sector employees, 
who retained their jobs, salaries, and fat mortgages, benefited from the col-
lapse in mortgage rates to near zero. Disparities in the lives of victims and 
perpetrators seem stark in the popular narratives, but reality is more complex 
and blurred. In the crisis, many subprime mortgage holders tragically lost their 
homes. However, in the preceding boom they had accessed subprime mortgages.

hours contracts rose 25 percent over 2012 and had risen more than 150 percent since

National Statistics, Colchester, Essex. 2013.

This enabled them to purchase homes that they would never otherwise have 
been able to do. The picture is further obscured by who actually spoke up. 
Those who have weathered the troughs usually stay silent. The voiceless often 
bear the greatest losses and the loudest may actually be complaining about 
something entirely different. There are more than fifty shades of grey when 
it comes to finding the losers and winners. Despite these ambiguities, in the 
heat of crises, policy makers’ hesitancy is often interpreted as a reluctance to 
act or even—such is the politically combustible atmosphere—as complicity. 
Faced with billions of taxpayers dollars being diverted from social programs 
and defense budgets to save banks, politicians need to deliver urgent, decisive, 
and bold action. The final bill for the GFC across the EU and the United States 
will be in the trillions of euros. The public demands that the culprits be seized, 
locked behind bars, and repayment or other restitution made.
Across newspaper headlines and in the eyes of wronged consumers, the 
“crime” looms large, obvious and the (often foreign) bogeyman is writ large. 
A popular parable was of foreign speculators, this time London-based hedge 
fund managers. The story goes that they used derivative instruments to sell 
local stocks they did not own in order to press down company share values 
to the point of triggering bank covenants. These covenants required the com-
pany to issue more shares which would stop the shares from rebounding thus 
­making the original selling a self-fulfilling prophesy. 
While speculation was rife over the role of this short-selling, several studies 
were unable to find clear evidence that short-sellers were targeting financial 
institutions and their loan covenants in a material way.8 This lack of evidence 
was especially clear in comparisons of the performance and trading of nonfi-
nancial stocks. Maria Stromqvist of the Swedish Riksbank summarized these 
studies well when she said, “To simplify somewhat, we can say that the hedge 
funds have been affected more by the present financial crisis than they have 
affected it.”9 Moreover, this kind of behavior was already unlawful, or, where 
not specifically so, could be captured within the catchall of market abuse or 
other prohibition. It is not clear we need something new to deal with this 
kind of abuse when it occurs. Further, despite the amount of ink spilled on 
short-selling, the equity derivative market is only a small fraction of the credit 
derivative market. Remember that it was in the credit markets that the main 
action of the GFC took place.

Yet, for governments faced with the political pressures described, it was 
tempting and even understandable that they should choose to outlaw short-
selling with a swashbuckling draw of the legislative axe. In the GFC, especially 
around the middle of 2009, many countries, including the United States, United 
Kingdom, Italy, Korea, and Spain, issued emergency orders that banned short-
selling of financial stocks. The practical effect of these bans is unclear. Some 
studies suggest that the volatility of financial stocks did fall.10 What is certain is 
that the bans failed to save Lehman Brothers from collapse in September 2008 
and failed to prevent the calamity that followed. Yet, two years after Lehman’s 
failure, amid the European credit crisis, the German minister of finance 
announced a broadening of bans of naked short sales to include euro-denom-
inated government bonds, the credit default swaps (CDS) based on those 
bonds, and shares in Germany’s ten leading financial institutions. In November 
2012, in an attempt to coordinate a number of similar but different initiatives 
across Europe, the EU adopted a regulation that included a ban on uncovered 
(“naked”) CDS shorts on member states’ sovereign paper.11 
The idea that it was financial innovation and complexity—so well embodied 
in Goldman’s Abacus CDO and the industry’s creation of “CDOs-squared”—
which previously tripped up global finance has spawned further proposals. Eric 
Posner and E. Glen Weyl have argued that finance should have the equivalent 
of a Food & Drug Administration to rigorously test new innovations just as 
new drugs must be tested and approved before doctors can prescribe them.12 
As with drugs, such testing might take years, at which point those instruments 
that were approved would then be sold with their appropriate health warn-
ings. This idea has been gaining momentum. It was a major part of the debate

exchanges is solely the traders’ desire to avoid the transparency that might 
squeeze their profit margins. In Chapter 5 we pointed out that a lack of infor-
mation is often an issue when financial markets are in panic, though not always 
legitimately so. In the GFC an information shortage surrounding the size, 
nature, and location of bank exposures to credit default swaps contributed 
to the high uncertainty that effectively closed the ­interbank money markets. 
Add to this mix the numerous stories of shady activities taking place between 
financial institutions or even within them in the “dark pools” of liquidity. On 
July 28, 2014, a class-action lawsuit was filed in New York against Barclays 
for allegedly engaging in a scheme wherein the bank provided high-frequency 
trading firms it traded with confidential information on the large buy-and-sell 
intentions of its institutional clients. Barclays allegedly offered to manage the 
large buy-and-sell intentions of its institutional clients off the public exchange, 
because they were so substantial that, were they to be announced on the 
public exchange, knowledge of their trading intentions would push the mar-
ket against them. If you publicly announce buying a significant number of BP 
shares, for instance, it would send BP shares up making the cost of buying 
them increase. However, if your bank or broker were to quietly buy them 
off-exchange in internal netting arrangements which are called dark pools, 
only announcing the purchase at the end of the day, you would be spared 
the inflated price. By allegedly providing information on these trades to its 
high-frequency trading (HFT) clients (who may have traded more often and 
paid greater commissions than its institutional clients), Barclays defeated the 
purpose of the institutional investors trading off-exchange. If proved it would 
mean that the HFT clients were allowed to front run—that is, buy ahead 
of—institutional clients and profit at the latter’s expense. It was like putting 
its institutional investors into a dark pool and giving only the HFT clients a 
torch. Prior to the lawsuit, Michael Lewis’s book Flash Boys caught the public’s 
imagination with gripping tales of banks routinely allowing their HFT clients to 
feed off their institutional consumers.
Politicians have demanded that all trades be conducted in the bright glare of 
exchanges. Some argue that if traders dealing in complex instruments have 
to avoid the scrutiny of exchanges, or prevent instruments from being cen-
trally cleared and settled, then it is better that these instruments are not 
traded at all. Traders must either make pricing, quantities and terms transpar-
ent or forgo the possibility of trading. This proposal benefits exchanges, many 
of which are no longer mutuals but rather for-profit entities. They are keen on 
rules that proscribe trading off exchanges or require the central clearing of 
transactions. Most clearing houses are either owned by exchanges or partner 
closely with them.13 
13Exchanges are in a delicate position as high-frequency traders also contribute a large 
proportion of their revenues.

However well-intentioned, the proposals examined above are flawed for a 
number of practical reasons and also for quite fundamental ones. Banning 
existing, complex derivative instruments, subjecting new derivatives to testing 
and approval, and requiring all other derivatives to be exchange traded, will 
not achieve the intended goals. Regulators are right to be moderate. Let us 
consider what these fundamental flaws are and suggest ways to achieve the 
greater financial stability we seek. 
A Fundamental Defense of Complexity 
It is a commonly held belief that complex products are obscure, unnecessary 
and socially useless. The only apparent benefit is to bankers pocketing outra-
geous fees from these transactions. There is an element of truth behind some 
of these claims. However the argument against complexity is overdone and 
driven more by fear than fact.
Risk management is not about simply avoiding risks or having simple instru-
ments. Risks are all around us and without taking risks there are no returns 
to be had. As I have argued in earlier chapters, managing risk appropriately is 
in large part about how you accurately match assets and liabilities. If I have 
sold casualty insurance (e.g. a medical or motor plan) to someone who may 
need to be paid out at short notice, it is highly risky for me to invest the bulk 
of my portfolio in illiquid assets like real estate, however simple those assets 
may be. My need for liquidity necessitates holding highly liquid instruments. 
Alternatively, a pension fund manager obliged to make a series of cash pay-
ments in 20 years time should not be in the market for such simple instruments 
like government bonds. They are expensive (providing a low return) and offer 
something the manager does not need to pay for, namely overnight liquidity. 
Government bonds appear safe and simple but actually increases the risk 
that the fund will need additional member contributions to afford future pay-
outs. Long-term liabilities should be matched with long-term assets not simple 
assets. If existing liabilities are complex and changing, forcing the purchase of 
simple assets will result in unmatched risks. Eschewing complex assets in a 
complex world generates risk. 
Moreover, regulators, however wise, sagely dictating which instruments to 
approve and which to ban, is not going to create the stability we crave. Almost 
all complex derivative instruments are built from a combination of simple, 
seemingly safe, financial instruments. I have yet to encounter a complex deriva-
tive instrument that cannot be built using the simplest derivatives such as puts 
and calls. As in architecture, where there are also common building blocks, 
financial complexity and simplicity are not as easy to distinguish as might first 
appear. At the heart of the GFC was a boom in housing finance driven primar-
ily through the relatively simple instrument of a ­mortgage. Few complained

about not understanding the nature of mortgages—especially since they have, 
in some form, been around for literally thousands of years.14
In Chapter 3 we observed that bankers didn’t throw instruments of mass 
destruction into a crowd of bewildered customers only to then hightail it. The 
spectacle was that they ran toward them, all the while trying to stuff as many 
of these explosive instruments into their own pockets as possible. The real 
problem of the originate-and-redistribute model for the banks that failed is that 
they did not redistribute enough. They tried to hold on to as many credit instru-
ments as possible, all the while believing in the alchemy of computer models 
that suggested they could reap returns without risk. Banks created numerous 
off-balance-sheet, SPVs to enable themselves to hold more of these instruments 
and to do so in a more leveraged manner than their balance sheets and regu-
latory capital-adequacy requirements would have otherwise allowed.15 They 
really were more fools than knaves.16 Annointing specific instruments as “safe” 
or “bad” is not going to save us. It could even worsen the situation. Instruments 
are not born from original sin. They become dangerous through excessive, con-
centrated, or distorted use. The easiest way to create concentrated, excessive 
and distorted use of an instrument is for the government to declare it “safe.”
Why We Need Over-the-Counter Markets or 
Even “Dark Pools”
Exchanges work best for instruments where the size of the trade is small 
relative to the market and therefore the announcement of a bid to buy shares 
will not push the price higher, or the announcement of an offer to sell will not 
push the price lower. This captures most of the market for ordinary shares 
of large, publicly listed companies. An announcement to buy €100 of Sanofi 
shares is not going to push up the market price. This is why, without any ini-
tial regulatory mandate, the main venue for trading equities became public 
exchanges. However, in markets where the instrument being traded is large 
relative to the market, where the announcement of a bid or offer, like that 
14The first mortgages were not on houses but on holdings of commodities. The 
centralization of harvests in state warehouses in Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia led 
to the first mortgage contracts. Roman law allowed a creditor to seize the land of a 
nonperforming borrower. A couple thousand years later, mortgages have become more 
common on land and property but they are still common on commodities. In one of the 
earliest records of a mortgage, in 1766, Pierre Berger gave a mortgage to Francis Latour 
in St. Louis, Missouri. The goods covered were a quantity of deerskins.

Transfer,” Journal of Financial Economics 107, no. 3, pp. 515–36.

this is because knaves at least have a shot at redemption.

of buying €100 million of Sanofi shares, would move the market away from 
the bidder or “offerer,” trades ended up being negotiated over the counter. 
Exchanges protect buyers and sellers whose trades cannot move a market 
with transparency and equal treatment. However, this transparency effectively 
undermines the interests of large buyers and sellers whose trades, or merely 
their announcement to trade, move the market against them. This is why they 
go off-exchange.
Imagine an exchange for residential houses that cleared at the end of every 
day. There would be enormous swings in housing prices depending on the daily 
match of supply and demand for houses of certain sizes, styles, conditions and 
neighborhoods. The seller of the same product would receive dramatically dif-
ferent prices depending on which day he announced his intention to sell. Indeed, 
the announcement to sell could itself create an immediate loss. The market, 
recognizing his need to sell an asset for whom there are not many ready buy-
ers, pushes the price lower—a loss that might not have occurred had there 
been private negotiations with potential buyers over several weeks. That the 
vast majority of labor, goods and services are not traded via public exchanges 
is not the result of historic accident or regulatory lapses. It is the natural result  
of most markets being dominated by large and lumpy trades in things that are 
defined by a multitude of different attributes, rather than small trades of stan-
dard things. The more heterogeneous and lumpy the instruments, the greater the 
likelihood that they are traded “over the counter” and not on a public exchange.
In aggregate, bond and currency markets are large, but the bulk of trading 
takes place off-exchange. Bond and currency markets are really comprised of 
several, modestly sized subsectors. While a company might issue one type of 
share, it may have several different bond issues outstanding, each with unique 
maturities, coupons and tax treatment. The market capitalization for all bonds 
may be large but the market for each specific type of instrument—for exam-
ple, bonds with an AA credit rating that mature in 18 months, that have a 
greater than 5.5 percent coupon, paid semiannually, gross of withholding taxes, 
and that are issued in US dollars—may be tiny relative to the overall mar-
ket of bonds. In the case of government bonds, such as those with two-year, 
five-year and ten-year maturities, the majority of trades take place on a few 
“benchmark issues.” Even though the vast majority of issues outstanding were 
once benchmark issues, they are no longer so. Last year’s ten-year bond has 
become a nine-year bond. The market for these “off-the-run” instruments is 
more specialised and less liquid. Once those looking for a standard represen-
tation of long-term interest rates are removed, demand falls off a cliff, leaving 
quite a rarefied group of investors looking for an asset that matches a nine-
year liability.17 Consequently, even these instruments are often ­negotiated 
between buyer and seller rather than traded on a public exchange.

Special?” Journal of Financial Intermediation 20, no. 4 (October 2011), pp. 620–32.

At over $5 trillion a day, the currency market has a higher daily turnover than 
any other market. Yet the majority of currency transactions are for a forward, 
future, or swap, where a specified amount of foreign exchange is delivered 
on a specific date and time.18 These instruments are also largely negotiated 
over the counter between buyer and seller. The market to receive a million 
Brazilian reals in return for Argentine pesos at the close of business next week 
Thursday at 4.00pm Atlantic time is best negotiated and unannounced, lest 
others, aware of the buyer’s need for Brazilian reals at that precise moment, 
squeeze the supply against them.19 Contrary to their depiction in several eco-
nomics textbooks, markets are not passive places where market participants 
pursue their activity independently of one another. They are dynamic places 
defined by ­strategic behavior.
Evidence for this theory of trading venues is found even within the same 
market, where the historical and regulatory influences were similar. In equity 
markets, exchanges are the dominant venue for small trades that have no 
price impact. Large trades are made off-exchange, bilaterally over the counter, 
or in dark pools and often later reported, through the exchange, as a negoti-
ated trade that is then cleared and settled exactly as an exchange trade. The 
negotiated market in equities can be as large as the exchange-traded market.
There have been several previous attempts to put bond and currency markets 
on an exchange that have failed because of the issues discussed. What has 
emerged instead are electronic venues where market makers quote indicative 
prices for small trades as a signal of where they may be open to offers and bids 
for larger negotiated trades which are then afforded the same electronic trail 
of confirmations and settlement as quoted trades. The same argument applies 
to a derivative instrument designed, for example, to hedge the near-unique 
currency needs and risk-tolerances, of an exporter. Forcing these instruments 
onto exchanges would increase volatility. Given the unique nature of the sup-
ply and demand of these bespoke transactions, announcing bids and offers 
would force the market to appear whenever it is not being used and disappear 
when needed.

Derivatives Activity in 2013, last modified December 2013, www.bis.org/publ/rpfx13.htm.
19It is alleged that when the highly leveraged hedge fund, LTCM, ran into difficulty in 
September 1998, it asked its bankers for help. They offered to do so on condition that they 
could get a detailed view of the portfolio. The banks then established positions that would 
profit from LTCM’s need to bail out of certain positions, like its losing long yen, short 
dollar position, and backed out of any support. LTCM then found that, with the market 
knowing its positions, it was impossible to get out of them.

In essence, the liquidity characteristics of different transactions are revealed 
by the chosen trading venue. Instruments are traded where there is greatest 
liquidity. Consumers are not looking for the greatest opacity although opac-
ity sometimes enables liquidity.20 Where the instrument is large relative to 
its market, the greatest liquidity will not be on an exchange that is likely to 
sap liquidity and could lead to missing markets. Although dark pools may be 
abused and this must be stopped, they are not a sinister subplot but a neces-
sary evolution of shifting large blocs of shares with the least market impact. 
They should not be banned or made impossible. To force consumers away 
from their revealed preferences is a mistake.
Being traded OTC rather than on an exchange is not equivalent to being 
unregulated. OTC is not trading under-the-counter. Post-trade reporting is, 
in many cases, now mandatory for OTC trading. This should be the required 
norm. Consumer protection regulation in the housing market, for instance, 
is extensive in many countries. It matters not how a house is sold—online, 
through bilateral negotiation, or traded by some form of auction. Regulation 
of the market is independent of the trade venue. More can be done to protect 
investors trading in dark pools, but that does not mean that we should hoist 
the public exchange model onto markets that have, with good reason, evolved 
differently.
Conclusion 
The arguments presented are not meant to imply that we should ignore the 
derivatives markets as a potential source of financial instability. Rather the 
argument being proffered is that we must be more watchful over behavior 
that creates systemic risks rather than being too particular about instruments 
or trading venues. Instruments and venues come and go, but the underlying 
behavior that causes financial crashes is constant.21 In Chapters 5, 6 and 7, I 
have proposed incentivizing behaviour that strengthens the financial ­system. 
Beyond that, behavior that uses any instruments—derivative, complex, or  
simple—to create false markets or undermine market integrity should be 
­illegal. Huge damage was done through mortgages, the simplest and most 
familiar of instruments.

In the crisis, regulators were also blindsided by a lack of information. Post-
trade transparency must be a requirement independent of whether instru-
ments are traded on exchanges or not.22 Under the European Union’s 2004 
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), market-making firms are 
already obligated to report off-exchange trading in instruments that are also 
traded on EU regulated exchanges. It is not a great leap to require post-trade 
reporting of all trades regardless of where they are traded. Failure to report 
these trades should carry stiff penalties—including the legal unenforceability 
of the transaction.
Banks may have a built-in bias toward selling complex instruments (with their 
fatter profit margins) that are not best traded on an exchange, where a sim-
pler, more liquid, set of instruments could suffice. Many believe that this is the 
driving force behind bank behavior.23 Complex instruments are harder to clear 
and settle centrally, making it more difficult to limit exposures and risks. This 
can also make resolutions more difficult, which represents a potential threat 
of systemic risk. We can internalize this social externality by requiring firms 
to set aside capital for holding instruments that are not centrally cleared and 
settled—irrespective of trading venues. This proposal would act like a tax on 
complexity rather than a ban. Simplicity and central clearing would be incen-
tivized and banks would only trade complex instruments where necessary.
Competition authorities are rightly concerned that since many exchanges own 
clearing houses, any regulation that incentivizes central clearing of instruments 
will allow exchanges to capture the market in trading venues. To address this, 
the authorities can promote the “interoperability” of clearing houses, where 
counterparties choose where they clear their transactions independently of

23However, this is not as clear-cut as some believe. From my experience, corporate 
treasurers often find it hard to justify to their boards the cost and value of hedging their 
financial risks and exposures. They go out of their way to ask for and choose “zero-
cost” options as hedging instruments over more expensive options. Of course, these 
instruments are only zero cost because they have more risk. The cost of insuring against 
a risk has been offset by the premium received for acting as an insurer for another risk. 
For instance, if a Swedish exporter of cars to South Africa makes additional profit when 
the rand rises against the krone, and losses when the rand falls, it could cheapen the cost 
of buying insurance against the rand falling, by selling insurance against and giving up some 
of its profits from, a rise in the rand. But the added challenge for the corporate treasurers 
is that they were frequently too embarrassed to admit they did not fully understand their 
exposures. This embarrassment is accentuated by the fact that companies often chose 
older men to be their safe pair of hands at the Treasury and banks chose highly intelligent 
young women to sell derivative instruments to them.

where they trade them.24 Clearers would be required to grant fair access 
to third-party trading venues. This would also deliver greater financial stabil-
ity by maximizing the netting across a wide range of related instruments—­
irrespective of where the best place to trade those instruments is at any one 
time. Forcing trading venues and clearers to fight separately for business could 
also deliver better services and lower user costs. This would be competition-
supporting horizontal integration of the industry as opposed to competition-
reducing vertical integration. In one swoop, we could boost competition and 
financial stability which, as discussed in Chapter 4, is more rare than realised.25
Another more controversial suggestion for limiting “excessive” complexity 
of behavior would be to place a tax on all small transactions of instruments 
issued within participating countries, or carried out by residents, including 
OTC derivatives. A lesson of the last decade is that low transaction costs 
are good but near-zero transaction costs are questionable. The reason is that 
these near-zero costs allow huge edifices of circular transactions to take 
place—much more than are involved in the underlying transaction. These are 
always hard to unwind in an orderly fashion even if the transactions were 
simple. A small transaction tax would focus minds on the underlying value of 
each transaction and limit socially useless transactions. It would be a tiny price 
to pay if it preserved innovation and risk-reducing complexity.26 We consider 
the merits and difficulties of this idea in Chapter 13.
In this chapter, I have set out a short theory of trading venues that reflects the 
revealed preference for trading liquidity. My proposals try to strike a balance 
between trading liquidity, innovation, consumer protection and systemic risk. 
While it remains in some flux, the emerging regulatory regime for OTC deriv-
atives is close to what I propose. The focus should be squarely on regulating 
behaviour through the macroprudential tools presented in Chapters 5 and 6, 
accounting tools in Chapter 8, financial transaction taxes discussed in Chapter 12  
and on the mandatory reporting, central clearing and settlement of trades 
described in this chapter. Behavior, not instruments and trading venues, is key 
to containing systemic risk and protecting consumers.

26Opponents of financial transaction taxes argue that they are not feasible and because 
they are large relative to trading costs, they would collapse trading, which would increase 
volatility. In Chapter 12, I explain why these arguments are wrong.

C h a p t e r 
Bankers’ Pay
Should bankers’ pay be subject to government regulation? I am referring to 
bankers ensconced in the private sector rather than those employed by state-
owned banks or even to those temporarily in state hands. Many people of a 
certain age instinctively balk at the idea—their attitude colored by memories 
of low, rigid public sector pay scales exorcising motivation and talent. Others, 
touched by a little schadenfreude, believe that the time is ripe for government 
involvement in private-sector pay. It fills me with dread. Having been involved 
in setting investment bankers’ pay, bitter experience has taught me that getting 
it right is nigh impossible at the best of times. This is before introducing the 
added dimension of political and national interests.
In the past, I tried to reward exceptional behavior only to have the recipient 
quit as this was just what he was waiting for to fulfill his dream of opening a 
wholefood restaurant in Provence. It happens more frequently than you may 
think. Reward teamwork over individual performance and the end result may 
be underperformers staying because they would not be as well paid elsewhere 
and your outperformers demotivated and seeking opportunities to be better 
appreciated. While bonuses are calculated in absolute terms, much of their 
effect is based on relativity of expectations to past pay and the remuneration 
of rivals both within the organization or in the industry. Venturing to play these 
complex dynamics with one number is treacherous. I recall the reported com-
ment of a senior banker at the end of a bonus day suggesting that never before 
had so much money been paid to so many disappointed people.
Recent experience of even temporary government ownership, in the case of 
the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in the UK and AIG in the United States, 
reveals some of the challenges that come from adding government involve-
ment to the mix. Consider Stephen Hester’s position. He was parachuted in 
to rescue RBS from the difficulties that had prompted the British government 
to become the majority shareholder in October 2008. Arguably one of the 
hardest jobs in British banking, Hester also had his annual compensation pub-
licly broadcast, scrutinized and tirelessly compared to the plight of victims of

the financial crisis. His reward for taking on one of the most difficult jobs was 
less pay and security than other bank CEOs. This is not to say that he was 
not well paid compared to a nurse or teacher, but that he had easier, more 
agreeable alternative employment opportunities. than signing up for regular 
public floggings.
The complexities of having a public owner cannot be underestimated. 
Governments want to claw back bankers’ bonuses if they made risky deci-
sions in the past and penalize them for not lending enough to small busi-
nesses.1 To this is heaped a host of moral conundrums. Imagine being the 
government-appointed board member of a troubled bank taken over because 
of a concentrated exposure to complex derivative contracts gone sour. Do 
you endure a lasting political roasting for employing and giving bonuses to 
the very people who developed those contracts so that they unwind them 
cost-effectively? Or do you instead bask in your allotted fifteen minutes of 
fame as the person who sent them packing? Of course this leaves you with 
staff clueless to untangle the mess and even greater losses than otherwise. 
Financial crashes are best avoided because they offer up an endless supply of 
­impossible choices.
Despite these difficulties, the experience of the past 30 years has been that 
the consequences of leaving bankers’ pay to the marketplace are even greater. 
As a result, policy makers have reluctantly waded in. Individual compensation 
is now a natural part of the regulator’s remit. The EU has gone further and 
placed a statutory limit on the ratio of bank bonuses to basic pay. Bankers have 
responded with venom and significant individual support for the campaign to 
take the UK out of the EU.
This chapter begins with a glance at the role of individual incentives in shap-
ing banking. We briefly examine the evolution of compensation in the financial 
sector, the issues that have arisen as a result, how they were addressed and 
the unintended consequences that followed. Current proposals and their chal-
lenges are scrutinised. After that, I take a clean page and consider the nature of 
motivation and the implications for bankers’ compensation. In this I am aided 
by copious empirical research in the field of motivation that bank bosses seem 
to ignore. From that I lay out what we should be trying to incentivize and how 
best to do so. My conclusion is surprising—or at least it was to me.
1UK banks were threatened with larger taxes if they did not sign on to Project Merlin, 
effectively a pledge to lend 15 percent more to small- and medium-size enterprises and to 
regional growth initiatives. The commitments were announced on February 9, 2011, by all 
of Britain’s biggest banks: Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, RBS and with respect to 
the lending commitments alone, Santander.

Incentives Matter
Bank behaviour is driven by the incentives on offer. Most would agree that 
banking regulation should act as a brake on unsustainable bank lending. That 
brake should limit the ravages of the inevitable subsequent bust. However, by 
centering bank capital adequacy regulation on market measures of risk that 
fell as the boom progressed, banks’ risk-adjusted assets rose and returns fell.2 
This gave banks both the room and the incentive to lend more. They did so 
making the eventual catastrophe bigger than it would have otherwise been. By 
focusing on narrowly-defined balance sheets, regulation incentivized banks to 
seek fees for originating credit risks that they then shifted off their balance  
sheets.3 Most of what went wrong in the run up to the Global Financial Crisis 
(GFC) was incentivized by regulation, sometimes inadvertently, though not 
always. It was not the result of some unpredictably deviant behavior. I dis-
cussed some of these unintended incentives in greater detail in Chapters 3, 4  
and 5. The point here is that the financial sector responded slavishly to the 
incentives on offer. Getting the incentives right for appropriate and proper 
financial behavior lies at the heart of what regulation of the sector is about.
While I write about banks’ behavior and the incentives behind their actions, it 
is vital to recognize that banks are the sum of decisions taken by individuals or 
committees of individuals. A bank’s process and procedures might make cer-
tain decisions easier, more mindless or even removed any sense of individual 
responsibility. However, that does not negate the fact that the levers of action 
were ultimately pulled by individual bank managers, not automatons.4 What 
incentives are given to these managers is therefore critically important. When 
I say that little happened that was not incentivized to happen, I also mean that 
little occured which was not in line with individual incentives. If we want to 
change bank behavior, we cannot ignore the incentives derived from the way 
individual bankers are paid.
2Falling returns as booms reach their zenith is common and the result of a concentration 
of cash piling into sectors considered safe. The UK’s buy-to-let boom prior to the GFC 
occurred alongside a slide in rental yields. A similar decline in returns to real estate

Financial Crisis of 1997-98.

the balance sheet via agreements to buy back assets (the liquidity backstop) and via brand 
reputation.

the Global Finance Revolution (London: Bene Factum, 2006) when he wrote, “Transactions 
invariably took place at the edge of feasibility, conducted against a competitive background 
under great time pressure. I found few committees of experts considering all of the 
available evidence in wise conclave. Much more typical were decisions taken on the fly, by 
whoever happened to be available, based on a fraction of the full information.”

A Brief History of Compensation 
Arrangements in Banking
As far back as the 1960s and 1970s, there was growing concern among share-
holders that managers’ interests were insufficiently aligned with their own.5 
Managers appeared to pursue size rather than profitability. Size brought big-
ger salaries, fancier offices, first-class travel and maybe a corporate jet. It also 
gave individuals greater self-importance and a deepening circularity of politi-
cal connections, honors, and rewards.6 Motivation, as I discuss later, is not 
only about the paycheck. But the point is that all these benefits came at the 
expense of shareholder returns. A plethora of studies then and now have 
shown that the average acquisition or merger increased managers’ pay but 
reduced profitability and shareholder value.7 This gave impetus to the develop-
ment of employee-share-ownership and stock-option schemes. Shareholders 
hoped, and business schools and management consultants agreed, that giving 
senior managers a larger share of their compensation in the form of stock or 
stock options created a better alignment of their interests with the manager’s. 
Management would be forced to focus on strategies that bolstered dividends 
and the stock price rather than their view from the corner office.
Right from the beginning, managers rallied behind this idea. They even pro-
moted it.8 Linking pay to stock prices seemed objective and outside of the 
control of managers. However, the managers understood, better than the aver-
age shareholder or business school professor, the power inherent in setting 
the terms and pricing of stock options. By influencing the accounting of profits 
and the financial structure of the company, stock options could be a conduit 
for a substantial shift in wealth from shareholders to senior executives.
5This is referred to as the “principal agent problem.” For further discussion of principal 
agent problems, see Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried, Pay Without Performance: The Unfulfilled 
Promise of Executive Compensation (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2004).
6Think of companies such as General Motors, ITT, US Steel, Amoco, Goodyear, United 
Fruit Company, and the Rio Tinto Group. That age of the large corporation with managers 
aspiring to bigger offices with little heed to the interests of shareholders is well captured 
in the 1960 film The Apartment, starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine.
7Researchers calculate that takeovers by large firms have destroyed $226 billion of 
shareholder wealth over the past 20 years. See Sarah Moeller, Frederik Schlingemann, and 
Rene Stulz, “Do Shareholders of Acquiring Firms Gain from Acquisition?” (NBER Working 
Paper 9523, Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic Research, March 2015).
8Critics of the management consultancy firm McKinsey claim that the growth of stock 
options originated with Arch Patton, a McKinsey consultant. In 1952 Jan Trippe, CEO of 
Pan American World Airways, asked Mr. Patton to do a study of stock options for his 
management team. Mr. Patton promoted stock options through a number of articles, many 
published in the Harvard Business Review and in books, including Men, Money, and Motivation: 
Executive Compensation As an Instrument of Leadership (1961). While only 18 percent of 
public companies had stock bonus plans in 1950, by 1960 this had increased to about 60 
percent.

Stock prices today reflect future earnings. This encouraged the stock-incentiv-
ized managers to adopt bold strategies and plans that were quickly reflected 
in advancing stock prices. But sustainable performance was less influenced by 
such plans, perhaps even undermined by them. Consequently, bouts of great 
optimism and steadily rising share prices were punctuated by inevitable dis-
appointment and stock collapses. CEOs took home more wealth during the 
triumph of optimism but their tenures got shorter. This only intensified the 
process. If you are paid in stock options and your tenure is likely to be no 
more than three years because of the inevitable disappointment in a big plan 
or something beyond your control, you need the stock price to do a lot 
in those three years. The dominant post-1980s corporate strategies were 
all dressed up as a maximizing enterprise. This included greater leverage, 
one-time charges on the arrival of a new CEO, smoothing earnings through 
accounting discretion of the intangible assets’ valuation, spinouts of business 
lines and share buybacks replacing dividends.9 However, they also all maxi-
mized the returns of stock option holders, especially those able to reset the 
terms of these options, as most managers were able to do. In the process, 
banks went from being safe, defensive stocks for investors, to risky “growth” 
plays. Stock options also became an agent for greater income and wealth 
inequality.10
Stock Options Were Also Part of the Zeitgeist of 
the 1980s and 1990s
There is a tendency for the wider public to blame what seems dark and impen-
etrable—in this context, stock options—for all that went wrong. However, 
these instruments were merely part of the zeitgeist of an age where markets 
were seen as naturally right. Attempts to thwart markets were not only erro-
neous but certain to fail. Following on the heels of financial deregulation, the 
dismantling and later repeal of Glass-Steagall’s separation of banking, as well 
as the UK’s financial regulation in the 1980s, market prices were placed at 
the center of banking regulation.11 Recall that the Basel II Accord enshrined 
this approach and while Basle II was not launched before 2004, this approach 
9In 2014, for instance, share buybacks were 50 percent more than dividends for the S&P 
500 (source Bloomberg).

had emerged earlier and could be seen in the 1995 market risk amendment 
to Basel 1.12 Financial deregulation, the process of switching from businesses 
relying on preferential government license to relying on stock market-raised 
capital and financial market prices, dovetailed with stock-option touting man-
agers.13 They fed upon each other. Indeed, the biggest sponsors of deregulation 
were these stock option-incentivized managers and the groups sponsored by 
companies they managed. If stock options had not been invented, something 
similar would have taken its place.
When the Music Is Playing, You Have to  
Get Up and Dance
There is a special dimension to the way stock-incentivized bank managers add 
to systemic risk in a highly connected banking system that is worth consider-
ing. Imagine that a bank’s management team believes that the current surge in 
mortgage lending that is driving property prices higher and generating strong 
bank revenue growth will come to a sticky end. After all, this has happened in 
almost every other past episode of rapid lending to the housing market. The 
team could tighten its lending standards even as the boom continues. It knows 
that this would lead to market share and revenue losses. The company will 
also appear underleveraged, overcapitalized, and behind the times. The stock 
market will penalize it for this action and executive stock options will lose 
value. The strongest companies at the beginning of the crisis were considered 
out of touch by the marketplace, such as HSBC and J. P. Morgan. Those that 
were first to flounder, like Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers, RBS, and Bank of 
America, were darlings of the stock market.
Let us assume that this hypothetical conservative bank is proven right. The 
collapsing property market would weaken other banks considerably. Since 
banks lend to banks and one bank’s customer deposit is another bank’s loan, 
this would cause a generalized panic. Liquidity would dry up and as banks 
tend to be funded with short-term deposits, all banks will quickly run into dif-
ficulty. Seeing the banking system under pressure, with the good being brought

13Prior to a package of deregulation in the city of London, coined the “big bang,” markets 
were strictly segmented by regulatory dictate. If a customer wanted to buy a share, she 
would place an order with a broker who would only act as the client’s agent. The broker 
would place an order with a jobber, a principal buying and selling on his own account and 
licensed to trade on the London Stock Exchange dealing floor.

down alongside the bad, the government and central bank would intervene. 
In rescuing the banking system they would lift all boats equally. Stock options 
from the safe bank either go under water along with the stock options of all 
other banks or perform no better than others. Caution, even when right, is 
not rewarded by the stock market.14 Under the spell of the zeitgeist, regula-
tors had a blind spot to this. Instead, during the decade prior to the GFC, they 
imposed even more stock market discipline on bank behavior.15 Chuck Prince 
was dismissed as CEO of Citibank for saying in 2007 that when the music is 
playing you have to get up and dance. From the perspective of the stock mar-
ket and a stock option-incentivized bank manager, he was precisely correct.
Stock Options, Trader Bonuses, and Gambling  
for Redemption
A typical employee stock option is awarded with a strike price of the current 
share price, a ten-year expiry date, and a vesting period. To the uninitiated, 
stock options appear to be long-term remuneration. Banks even refer to them 
as long-term incentive schemes. The accounting cost of issuing this option is 
relatively cheap. It is struck at the current share price. Income in the future 
is worth less than income today and the company only pays out if the stock 
price has risen. Were the employee to exercise the option on receipt, this 
merely gives the right to purchase the company’s shares at the current price. 
It is worthless to him and costless to the company except for minor legal and 
administrative costs. But after the fifth year, for example, the employee could 
buy the company’s shares at the stock price of five years prior. Assuming 
shares have risen at an average of perhaps 7 percent per year, the stock option 
would confer a 40 percent discount on the current share price. The broker in 
the stock would assist the employee who wants to get hold of the cash value 
of the option rather than the stock. Should the share price instead fall below 
the original price, the employee would never cash it in and it would expire 
worthless. 
An important feature of these options, shared by modern traders’ bonuses, is 
the huge potential upside but absent downside. If a trader is down $1 million 
on her trades, for instance, she knows that to close them down and realize 
the loss will mean no bonus for the year. But using the bank’s funds to double 
up (or more) on the risk creates a tiny chance it would come right. She could 
14Bankers’ pay could be seen as a form of the collective action or public choice problem. 
For further discussion of this long-established field, see Mancur Olson, The Logic of  
Collective Action: Public Goods and the Theory of Groups (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University 
Press, 1965).

transparency, supervisors expressed a preference that banks have a public stock listing.

move from no bonus to a good bonus. From the trader’s or senior execu-
tive’s perspective, when his profit and loss or stock options are under water, 
there is a 100% likelihood of no bonus if he were to close down his losing 
trades, or a small probability of a bonus if he takes on more risk. The latter 
is always better for the trader or stock option holding manager. The regula-
tor or shareholder, concerned with the bank’s sustainability, would naturally 
take the opposite view prefering that the trader or executive cut their losses 
rather than doubling down on a failing bet. 
The asymmetry of the payout for the trader or executive who is under water 
mid-year, incentivizes him to gamble for redemption using the bank’s solvency 
as the betting stake.16 That sounds colorful but it is sadly real enough. In each 
of the biggest, single trading losses, previously successful traders17 used futures 
or derivative markets, (since the up-front cash for a trade is initially low), to 
trade their way out of trading losses by establishing increasingly larger posi-
tions.18 This was the narrative behind J. P. Morgan’s $6 billion loss in 2012 
from Bruno Iksil’s credit derivative trades; UBS’s $2.3 billion loss in 2011 from 
Kweku Adoboli’s derivative trades; Société Générale’s $6.8 billion loss in 2008 
from Jerome Kerviel’s $60 billion bets on stock futures; Daiwa’s $1.1 billon 
1995 loss from Toshihide Iguchi’s bond trades; and Baring’s $1.2 billion 1992 
losses from Nick Lesson’s stock futures trades. 
The replacement of “gentlemanly capitalism” with “shareholder capitalism” 
did not create a better alignment of the interests of bank shareholders and 
managers. Instead, it allowed bankers to pocket astronomical gains in the 
good times and required shareholders and taxpayers to shoulder the losses 
when things went sour.19 Systemic fragility was not the result of bad luck. 
It was the inevitable consequence of how wealth was transferred through 
bankers’ bonuses.20 No wonder then that, however distasteful in general, and 
­challenging in particular, there is a strong desire to tackle bankers’ pay. 
16A few days before his trading loss of $2 billon was revealed in September 2011, UBS’s 
derivative trader Kweku Adoboli reportedly wrote on his Facebook page that he “needed 
a miracle.”
17Bruno Iksil (aka “the London Whale”), Kweku Adoboli, Toshihide Iguchi, and Yasuo 
Hamanaka (Mr. Copper) were legendary traders of high repute prior to their last trades. 
Their reputation probably reduced scrutiny of their activities, prolonging the losses. In the 
case of Mr. Hamanaka and Mr. Iguchi their activities took place over several years.
18The same asymmetries have driven large trading losses at hedge funds, including the $6.6 
billion 2006 loss run up by Brian Hunter, an energy trader at the hedge fund Amaranth.

20Raghuram G. Rajan makes a different argument but one with some resonance to this—
concerning how income inequality and inadequate safety nets in the United States were 
politically, but not economically, sustainable by giving easy credit to the poor. See Raghuram 
G. Rajan, Fault Lines (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2011).

Current Proposals and Their Challenges
Long before the GFC, regulators were conscious that financial misconduct 
could be systematically incentivized and sought to restrict this possibility. 
Crucial to consumer protection is the elimination of conflicts of interest 
where bankers are incentivized through commissions or fees to push clients 
in a direction that is not necessarily in their best interest. This is discussed 
in greater detail in chapter 7 but briefly recall that conflicts of interest were 
first required to be disclosed, then potential conflicts had to be disclosed and 
increasingly potential conflicts, like some referral arrangements, are simply 
being barred.
The GFC turned regulators’ attention to executive pay. It is now common 
practice in the United States, Europe and elsewhere that financial firms above 
a certain size must disclose compensation arrangements to regulators. They 
are also prohibited from arrangements that encourage unnecessary or exces-
sive risk taking. I explained in chapters 4 that regulations like these are bound 
to fail because at the core of the issue is bankers doing things most think are 
safe, which turn out to be risky. It is usually not about bankers doing things 
that they and regulators knew all along were risky.
Regulators appreciate that defining what is unnecessary and excessive is open 
to vast interpretation. Consequently, some regulators have sought to go fur-
ther than this general nostrum. The EU has agreed a bonus cap that restricts 
banker bonuses to 100 percent of salaries or 200 percent with shareholder 
approval. The cap is effective from 2016. It will apply to material risk traders 
(MRTs) whose total remuneration exceeds €500,000. Up to 25 percent of the 
bonus pay will receive a discounted valuation for the purposes of calculating 
the cap if delivered over a long period and can be clawed back. There is no 
limit on salaries. The cap is on the proportion of remuneration, not the level, 
that can be paid in bonus—though it is likely to lower total compensation as 
well as change its composition.
The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the UK bank regulator, has pub-
licly objected to the cap adding to the already fraught relationship between 
the EU and the UK. It is not that the PRA’s preferred route is laissez-faire. 
It advocates a long-term, bonus clawback provision. Banks would be able to 
determine staff bonus levels and proportions but guarantee that bonuses are 
returnable up to 7 years post-award if activities the employee was involved 
in goes bad. Bonus clawbacks are fashionable in London and New York and 
supported by both bankers and regulators. They seem a clever compromise 
between a cap and doing nothing. However, they will not work in practice.

Suppose a bank sells default insurance on the US auto company, GM, to a 
shareholder of the company. Much of banking business is similar to selling 
credit insurance. In the case of the instrument the banker sold, the bank 
receives a regular premium for five years but has to make a large payout to 
the shareholder if GM goes bust within those five years. Suppose the banker 
moves elsewhere within the same bank after year two. The traders left manag-
ing the position for the bank could decide whether or not to hedge the rising 
probability of a default as a result of the failure in year three of the company’s 
new model, and then a default occurs in year four. Who should be penalized 
for the default? Should the original banker’s bonus be docked? How should 
blame be aportioned? It could be placed at the feet of the banker, the traders 
managing the position, or their managers. And what happens if the original 
banker is now working elsewhere?
The further the distance from a transaction, the less its subsequent failure is 
attributable to those involved in the original transaction. It relates more to 
how exposures were subsequently managed and changing circumstances. In 
many cases we would be making bankers take on liabilities which they cannot 
control. It is striking that loan failures are like London buses: either they don’t 
come at all or arrive in bunches. This reminds us that the timing of loan fail-
ures is related to the macrofinancial climate, in turn determined by collective 
lending and borrowing behavior and largely uncontrollable by the individual 
banker.
Today, bankers seldom stay in one institution beyond a few years. It is custom-
ary for the bank doing the poaching to swap the employee’s long-term stock 
in the existing bank for long-term stock in the new bank. Consequently, the 
granting of long-term stock does not create an incentive for bankers to be 
worried about the long-term impact of their activities in one place. I once had 
a deferred bonus that replaced the deferred bonus of a previous employer 
that in turn was replacing the one before that. Long-term clawbacks do not  
connect an individual’s pay with individual responsibility. Assessing the banker’s  
role and appropriate level of clawback is fraught with challenges of measure-
ment, legality, equity, and morality.21 Bankers’ relative enthusiasm for bonus 
clawbacks over caps might just reflect their understanding of this reality.
21In my experience individual bonuses will also be driven by current inter and intra-
departmental rivalries that will not withstand external scrutiny if a clawback is later tested 
in the courts.

161
Psychology of Incentives
The crucial problem with the bonus clawback approach, however, is simply this: 
it is based on an outdated and flawed view of how behavior is incentivized.22 
Noneconomists like to criticize the economics profession for making unreal 
assumptions about human behavior. In reality economics has long embraced 
the complexity of human decision making. Many experts in this field have won 
the profession’s highest honors. Daniel McFadden won the 2000 Nobel Prize 
in Economic Sciences for his work analyzing the choices we make in areas 
such as personal health. Daniel Kahneman, the psychologist known for his 
work on decision making and judgment, won the Nobel along with economist 
Vernon Smith in 2002. Economist Robert Shiller shared the 2013 prize for his 
contribution to “irrational” behavior in asset markets. Jean Tirole, known for 
his work on commercial games regulated companies play, won the prestigious 
prize in 2014. Economists in other fields have grounds for feeling left out. Yet 
it appears that the pay-consulting firms, bank managers and regulators have 
failed to keep current with the research.
Psychologists Frederick Herzberg and Abraham Maslow in the 1950s demon-
strated that the two principal motivational ideas behind the bonus but claw-
back approach do not work.23 Their research found that where individuals are 
being motivated by the size of a cash payout, they demand more and more 
in order to do less and less. Work is redirected to focus on what specifically 
gains financial compensation, letting other aspects of work fall by the way-
side. Jealousy and resentment of others who are receiving more becomes rife. 
Revenge by stealing from the organization or fiddling the books often follows. 
Where individuals have their wages docked for some failure, this leads to the 
demotivated employees investing huge efforts to avoid being caught or devel-
oping complex schemes to disguise their failures.24 It is odd that despite the 
very behaviors the researchers predicted in 1950 being commonplace in the 
financial sector today, the sector persists with the approach. Astronomical pay 
has produced astronomical risks rather than astronomical results with mas-
sive subterfuge to hide the fact. It would be even more curious if regulators 
connived in the continuation of this practice.
22The ideas in this section follow from Rajendra Persaud, “How Rewards Really Reduce 
Motivation,” in The Motivated Mind: How to Get What You Want from Life (London: Bantam 
Books, 2005).
23See Frederick Herzberg, Bernard Mausner, and Barbara B. Snyderman, The Motivation to 
Work, second edition (New York: John Wiley, 1959) and Abraham Maslow, “A Theory of 
Human Motivation,” Psychology Review, 50, (4) pp. 370–396, 1943.

Conclusion
Empirical research on motivation suggests that people are most motivated to 
do a good job by a sense of achievement, recognition, a sense of responsibility, 
career advancement, personal growth, enjoyment of their job and a sense of 
being paid fairly. Financial firms would get more out of their employees and 
regulators would get a safer financial system if firms were to provide opportu-
nities for employees to show responsibility and then have this rewarded with 
public promotions, bigger salaries and greater responsibility.
The financial sector is the only place I am familiar with where every employee 
has a well-developed dream of departing quickly. A culture of “get rich quick” 
is risky for the employee, the bank, the wider economy, the financial system 
and the society. If a smaller proportion of compensation were paid in dis-
cretionary bonuses, it would tilt banks and employees away from searching 
for life-changing gambles. They would move toward building long-term cus-
tomer franchises, taking more responsibility and less risk and investing more 
in preserving reputation. I am surprised at this conclusion, but my personal 
experience of both setting and receiving bonuses resonates deeply with the 
established research on individual motivation.
Both experience and research have convinced me that from a macro and 
microprudential perspective, a bonus cap is a solid policy and an important 
idea. Unlimited bonuses, even with the theoretical potential to claw back, has 
proven to be a dangerous one.

thousands had experienced great distress, lost homes, jobs, and pensions.2 
Although banks were fined an unprecedented $100 billion in the five years  
postcrisis, these punitive fines still left many victims and observers of the crisis  
dissatisfied. This discontent was exacerbated by the added insult that share-
holders paid these fines rather the individual bankers. Moreover, a handful of 
the heavily fined banks, such as the Royal Bank of Scotland in the UK, were 
government owned at the time so ultimately the taxpayer paid the tab for 
the misdeeds of the loathed bankers. Hatred and anger towards bankers was 
immense—overflowing into the Occupy movement in New York, London and 
beyond.
If bankers had tried to temper this anger with a show of remorse and suit-
able apologies, things might have been different. Instead, Bob Diamond, then 
CEO of Barclays, briskly pronounced that “there was a period of remorse and 
apology for banks and I think that period needs to be over.”3 Diamond’s call 
for a halt to any contrition was somewhat premature, coming in 2011 just 
prior to the unveiling of apparent rigging of interest-rate and foreign-exchange 
markets. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs’ CEO, actually thought the period 
of penitence had ended much earlier when he joked in November 2009 that 
he was merely doing “god’s work.”4 Inflamatory statements like this make the 
idea of court martialing bankers highly attractive. Sadly, doing so is unlikely to 
save us from future financial crashes. Arguably, increasing the scope of financial 
offences punishable by jail terms potentially makes it easier for bankers to get 
away scot-free.5 Furthermore, greater criminal responsibility for aspects of 
the bad behavior during the boom and subsequent crash is unlikely to impact 
the probability of future crises. That does not mean, however, that we should 
tamper with exisiting criminal offences such as insider trading, market manipu-
lation and money laundering. The aim of this chapter is to explore the option 
of greater use of criminal law. My unpopular conclusion is that we should 
2The magnitudes are large, though it is not straightforward to try and precisely quantify 
these effects. Most studies show a large range of impacts across countries depending on 
their policy responses, fiscal space, existing social safety nets, and the degree to which 
citizens had resources to fall back on. The ILO estimates that unemployment increased by 
34 million between 2007 and 2010 (ILO Global Employment Trends, 2012). The World 
Bank estimated a greater-than-100-million person increase in the working poor in 2011 as 
full time jobs shifted to part time or less pay (World Bank Development Indicators, World 
Bank). Researchers found a 5000-person rise in suicide in Europe as a result of the crisis,

not expand the scope of existing legal remedies but rather we should pur-
sue these remedies with greater alacrity and resources and reinvent financial 
regulation in the way described in Chapters 5 and 6.
I argued in Chapter 4 that the period immediately after any major financial cri-
sis is ripe for root and branch financial reform. Cries of “This time is different” 
heard during the boom are always replaced with shouts of “Never again” as 
the bust unfolds. I noted that crises are often the handmaiden of fundamental 
financial reform. Many useful reforms have followed crises, such as the require-
ment that the audited accounts of banks should be published. Crises also pro-
duced deposit insurance, the US Federal Reserve and a raft of other central 
banks, the Glass-Steagall Act, and the Basel Committee of Bank Supervisors.6
I have also suggested in earlier chapters that there is a policy dynamic at 
work in this specific postcrisis period. While the moment for proper reforms 
emerges in the wake of a crisis, if it is not grasped, it soon disappears and poor 
reforms surge in. Bank regulators, caught up in controlling the raging fires of a 
financial crash, often see the point of origin and rush to suggest remedies. The 
Basel Committee of Bank Supervisors actually delivered a blueprint for mean-
ingful reform (Basel III) as early as April 2009—a mere seven months after 
the Lehman Brothers’ demise. Yet, over time, as taxpayers’ money is used to 
bail out wealthy, undertaxed bankers and the ensuing government deficits led 
to scrapping investment in society’s less fortunate, moral indignation morphs 
into anger. This justifiable anger shifts the focus from appropriate reforms to 
salacious details of individual villainy. Inevitably, the initial consensus among 
regulators of what went wrong and how it should be fixed is lost.
It is then the turn of politicians to bombard us with their favorite explanation: 
the “bad apple” doctrine of financial crises which we introduced in Chapter 3.  
This doctrine states that bad people doing bad things cause crises and 
they often do so out of bad, (invariably) foreign jurisdictions. This kind of 
Manichaeistic struggle between good and evil men makes an excellent story.7 
It is a convenient creed that absolves those in positions of authority from 
the responsibility of having been poor overseers. All they need to do is vehe-
mently lash out and squash those identified as bad apples. Both the political 
Left and the political Right have queued up to express their rage at the bank-
ers in the eye of the storm. Even other, untarred bankers have joined the bay-
ing mob as a means of declaring their own innocence.
6I provide greater detail of these developments in Chapter 4.
7“Hollywood . . . has always been inclined to this kind of story with heroes and villains and 
the nefarious banker makes for a pretty perfect villain. Michael Douglas’s iconic portrayal 
of Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone’s Wall Street set the mold for this character, and a 
batch of post-financial crisis films have followed suit: from narratives like Wall Street 2 
and Company Men, to documentaries like Inside Job and Capitalism: A Love Story.” Daniel

No wonder then, that many turn to using criminal law, and locking up the 
bankers seemingly responsible for the crisis and all its misery. The idea of 
using criminal law against bankers is today most advanced in the UK. To 
illustrate the major issues at work I shall focus in the following section on 
the development of UK law with regards to the wrong doing of bankers. In 
2010, the UK established the Independent Commission on Banking and, partly 
in response, in 2012, the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards 
(PCBS). The PCSB’s report, entitled Changing Banks for Good, sought to rectify 
what it deemed “profound lapses of banking standards.” It repeatedly criti-
cized the lack of attribution of individual guilt in the banking crisis and deter-
mined that it was time to “make individual responsibility in banking a reality.” 
The PCBS stated that there was a “strong case in principle for a new criminal 
offence of reckless misconduct in the management of a bank.” This would pro-
vide regulators with another weapon when dealing with egregious situations, 
such as “where a bank failed with substantial costs to the taxpayer, lasting 
consequences for the financial system, or serious harm to customers.” While 
this reflects a general trend in regulation around the world, it is noteworthy 
that more litigious societies, such as the United States, have not followed the 
example of creating such an offence.
The UK’s tough stance is now embodied in the Financial Services (Banking 
Reform) Act 2013. Section 36 makes the reckless management of a bank a 
criminal “offence relating to a decision causing a financial institution to fail.” 
It carries a maximum seven-years imprisonment sentence and/or fines of an 
unlimited amount. This is in line with other criminal offences within the con-
text of financial services and a significant increase in the scope and symbolism 
of how banks are to be regulated. To be convicted of reckless management 
the act requires that a senior manager had been aware of a risk that imple-
menting a decision8 would have caused the failure of the bank and that the 
manager’s conduct fell far below the reasonable standard to be expected 
of someone in that position. The UK’s financial-services regulator defines a 
senior manager for this purpose as both executive and non-executive board 
members. The provision seeks to emcompass anyone who is de facto running 
a bank. In October 2014, when two HSBC directors resigned in protest at the 
new rules, Andrew Tyrie MP, Chair of Treasury Committee, responded that 
the “crisis showed that there must be much greater individual responsibility in 
banking. A buck that does not stop with an individual often stops nowhere.”9
8“Decision” has been broadly defined to include a failure to prevent a decision.

over New Conduct Rules,” Financial Times, October 7, 2014.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
167
Order 2014 of the UK Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 2013 
(Commencement No. 5) was issued on July 9, 2014. It enables the Prudential 
Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority (which can both 
institute proceedings) to begin consulting on this new criminal offence—a 
process unfinished at the time of writing. However, it is reasonable to expect 
that the offence will come into force soon.
This new criminal offence is well intentioned. It rightly seeks to reduce the 
asymmetry between privatized gains and socialized losses. But it will not 
protect society from financial crises and could actually create perversions 
of natural justice. It exposes senior individuals to greater risk of prosecution 
by the regulators. Exactly who is deemed a “senior person” in the eyes of 
the Financial Conduct Authority is ambiguous. Does it broadly cover anyone 
managing aspects of the bank’s business that carry the risk of serious conse-
quences? Is it more circumscribed to a range of management functions? The 
Prudential Regulation Authority has suggested a narrower scope that extends 
only to people whose roles directly affect the firm’s safety and soundness. 
Whichever it is, the burden of proof is now squarely on the senior manager’s 
shoulders. He must show that he was not at fault for a failure within his sphere 
of influence. The manager must have taken reasonable steps to avoid con-
travention of the law occurring or continuing to occur. These steps include 
adequate and appropriate systems, controls, reporting lines and information 
management.
Any investigation to uncover a potential offence is likely to require a high level 
of access to corporate records and the institution itself. It will be inevitably 
complex and difficult to separate the merely suspicious behavior from behav-
ior intent on engaging in a criminal activity. And how does the investigation 
dissect what are usually collaborative decision-making processes to single out 
the individuals liable for having caused a bank’s failure? The only certainty is 
that this regime will promote incoherency in the management of firms that 
are already dangerously incoherent. Senior management will now have,
• 
less authority over decisions, by giving greater autonomy 
to risk managers and compliance officers, and
• 
less certain compensation, but
• 
will carry more open-ended liability for the outcome of 
collective failures.
In most walks of life, more responsibility coupled with less authority does not 
work.
However, beyond all these shortcomings, my fundamental objection remains 
with the idea that financial crises are caused by bad individuals. To believe  
so condemns us to repeat boom and bust cycles. Individual failures may be 
caused by individual actions but the authorities are already well equipped 

Chapter 11 | Why Locking Them Up Will Not Work

to deal with the financial and potentially criminal aspects of individual  
bank failures. Jail time for offences such as individual fraud and insider dealing  
is de rigour. Ivan Boesky and his colleague Mike Milken were both jailed for 
defrauding junk bond investors in the 1980s. Nick Leeson served four years 
of his sentence for fraudulent reporting of trading losses that grew so huge 
that they brought down the 233-year-old Barings Bank in 1995. “Bernie” 
Ebbers was jailed for 25 years in the United States for his part as CEO of 
WorldCom in a fraud and conspiracy related to false financial reporting. It 
resulted in a $100 billion loss to investors as his telecom empire disappeared 
down the dot-com debacle. Around the same time, John Rigas, founder of 
Adelphia Communications, was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for a 
fraud that led to the collapse of the firm he led. A year later, Enron Corp Chief 
Executive Jeffrey Skilling was jailed for 24 years—subsequently reduced to  
14 years for cooperation—for his role in the collapse of Enron, an energy-trading  
behemoth. Enron’s Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, received a six-year 
prison sentence and Chairman and former CEO, Kenneth Lay, was facing a 
20-year sentence before he died of a heart attack.
Prior to the GFC, a case could be made that while jail time for white-collar 
crime was not unusual, not many bankers were residing at Her Majesty’s plea-
sure in the UK, languishing in US federal prisons, or elsewhere. The cases 
above represent a handful of individuals over a few decades. But postcrisis this 
changed—starting with the “Bernie” Madoff affair. Mr. Madoff was convicted 
of fraud and sentenced to 150 years in June 2009 for perfecting the Ponzi 
scheme.10 The investigation into Mr. Madoff’s dealings led to greater scrutiny 
of other seemingly infallible investors. In March 2012, Allen Stanford, operat-
ing out of Florida and Antigua, was convicted for frauds that US prosecutors 
said amounted to a massive Ponzi scheme deserving of the 110-year prison 
sentence he received. Let me jog your memory with just a few other cases. 
In October 2010, Jerome Kerviel, trying to prove he was a worthy trader, 
ended up being jailed in France for 5 years. He had created fraudulent docu-
ments, used forged documents, and made attacks on an automated trading 
system while attempting to hide a $6.7 billion loss. Raj Rajaratnam, CEO of the 
US-based Galleon Group of hedge funds, was jailed for 11 years in October 
10The phrase “Ponzi scheme” is bandied around a little too liberally. A Ponzi scheme is a 
fraudulent investment operation where the operator pays returns to existing investors 
from the new capital being paid in by new investors, rather than from profits earned from 
real investments. It is named after Charles Ponzi, an Italian-born schemer who lived for 
some time in Boston, where he conducted his last scheme in 1920. It centered initially 
around the appearance of an international arbitrage related to postal-reply coupons but 
was really paying existing investors, including Ponzi, hearty returns with the capital of new 
investors. For an excellent modern-day study, see Ana Carajal, Hunter Monroe, Catherine 
Patillo and Brian Wynter, “Ponzi Schemes in the Caribbean” (IMF Working Paper 09/95, 
April 2009).

2011 for insider trading. Garth Peterson, a former Morgan Stanley real estate 
banker in Shanghai, was sentenced to nine months in prison for bribing a 
Chinese government official. In the UK, Thomas Ammann, an FSA “approved 
person,” got 2 years inside for insider dealing in December 2012. Rajat Gupta, 
a Goldman Sachs non-executive director, began a two-year prison term in the 
United States for insider trading, conspiracy, and securities fraud on June 17, 
2014. These are simply a few of the more high-profile cases. The caricature of 
all financial market participants as bandits getting bailed out, and getting away 
with illegal activity makes for good movies, but is inaccurate, never mind the 
enormous losses experienced by bank shareholders.
Let us be clear. Market manipulation is and has been a criminal offence. The 
scandals surrounding the alleged rigging of the LIBOR reference interest rate 
and foreign exchange markets that have resulted in large fines could lead to a 
further round of convictions and imprisonment.11 We need more resources 
allocated to those who police and enforce the existing laws. Many argue that 
this is not enough. They want society to send a stronger message. Nothing 
less than a widening of the scope of the criminal law in the way the UK is 
proceeding, to include the wrongdoing at the heart of the financial crisis, will 
surfice. However I think they will be disappointed because the actual quantity 
of convictions is unlikely to rise under the new criminal regime that has been 
introduced. The high threshold of certainty that must be met to secure a 
criminal conviction is particularly difficult to achieve in a financial crash. It is a 
major undertaking to prove that a single senior person’s conduct fell far below 
the expected standard at a time when competing factors may be contributing 
to the demise of a bank.
Sadly, even if all those who would be convicted after a financial crisis were 
somehow removed before hand, the crisis would still arrive. I know it is 
vexing to the public that something so bad that hurts so many people and 
causes so much damage could happen without some illegality. But crashes 
do not originate from accumulated, random acts of malfeasance. Busts gen-
erally follow booms. The longer and wider the boom, the deeper and more  
all-­encompassing the crash. Long, widespread booms do not happen because a 
few people do things they know are risky. It happens because hordes of people 
do things they believe are safe—so safe that it justifies them taking on even 
more extensive risks. They are reinforced in their thinking that what they are 
11In addition to fines amounting to £2 billion levied on five banks in November 2014 for 
allegedly rigging the foreign exchange market, the UK Serious Fraud Office launched a 
criminal investigation. It alleged that groups of traders across the major foreign exchange 
trading banks, calling themselves “the A-Team,” “the Three Musketeers,” and “the Players,” 
colluded online by sharing sensitive information to make millions for their banks and bag 
enormous bonuses for themselves. Anyone found guilty of manipulating the market faces a 
possible seven-year jail sentence and banks could additionally face prosecution.

doing is safe by the dominant philosophy of the day as proclaimed by news-
papers, academic research, and even regulatory bodies. The reader may recall 
our earlier allegation that some of the most sanctimonious people today are 
often those who presided over the publication of reviews, reports and stud-
ies boasting that this time was different. Financial innovation was supposed to 
keep us safe as houses.
There are plenty victims of financial crises who have suffered real losses, but 
there are also a large number of people who collectively share the responsibil-
ity for these losses. It is not that no one is to blame for a systemic crisis, but 
that almost everyone is guilty. Where does one draw the line? Should all those 
who benefitted from the boom owe restitution to all who suffered in the 
inevitable crash? Then this is not just about bankers. There are just as many 
people who took advantage of the massive expansion of cheap credit and 
affordable housing, patted themselves on the back for allowing it to happen, 
or enjoyed ballooning asset prices and pumped-up pension plans as there are 
those suffering from the aftermath of the crisis today. Adding further criminal 
law to this mess will not get us the desired accountability. To ascertain who 
deserves the most blame and were criminally reckless will be a hugely com-
plex task fraught with likely mistakes and potential miscarriages of justice. The 
grim reality is that we must place our greatest hope of moderating the behav-
ior that lies behind financial crashes in the reinvention of financial regulation.
While the outrage that underlies the passing of the UK Financial Services 
(Banking Reform) Act is understandable, it is difficult to compare the finan-
cial failure of an institution to other types of criminal behavior. In a murder 
trial, for example, the jury has a relatively clear idea of the required elements 
that must be proved in order to secure a conviction. Defining “recklessness 
endangerment” in banking, on the other hand, is far less obvious. It is likely 
to hinge on a subjective assessment of whether the senior person was aware 
(or should have been aware) that the risk existed or could exist, and, if in the 
circumstances known to her, it was unreasonable for her to have taken that 
risk. Many investors lose money without the help of illegal behavior by others. 
It is part of the normal course of outcomes in investment. Juries will have to 
differentiate between a normal loss making investment decision and a reckless 
one—in an uncertain commercial environment where all investment decisions 
involve complicated risks.
The minute you start wondering whether a “reasonable” person would con-
sider a decision reckless or not, you are more appropriately in the realm of 
civil law. Furthermore, there is the dimension of time to consider. Murder 
today or yesterday requires the same coming together of an act and an intent 
to commit that act. This is one of the reasons why there is generally no stat-
ute of limitations to bringing a prosecution for murder. But decisions that may 
be characterized as reckless banking with the benefit of hindsight may have 
appeared reasonable at that time to a reasonable person. The question then 

Reinventing Financial Regulation
171
becomes in whose shoes do we stand when assessing the risk. Is it at the time 
the decision was taken or at the time the jury is presiding? And what happens 
to those who made reckless investment decisions but were simply lucky or 
for whom no losses materialized? There is a distinct danger that we will end 
up criminalizing unlucky investment decisions rather than rooting out those 
that stem from criminally reckless management.
In Chapter 4 we suggested that when the UK Parliamentary Commission  
was considering the introduction of the new criminal offence of reckless 
management of a bank, foremost in their minds was the case of hero-turned-
bogeyman Mr. Fred Goodwin. Formerly known as Sir Fred Goodwin, he was 
the CEO who led the meteoric expansion resulting in the spectacular bust 
of the British bank RBS, receiving handsome personal rewards along the way. 
Mr. Goodwin backed huge leveraged buyouts and audacious takeovers. At 
one point, RBS was the world’s largest bank by assets ($3 trillion), employ-
ing some 200,000 people. He was the architect of the takeover of National 
Westminster Bank when by assets it was three times the size of RBS. He com-
pleted the expensive takeover of US-based Charter One Financial, and, even 
as the financial system was crumbling and Barclays had aborted its own efforts 
to do so, he made the fatal takeover attempt of ABN Amro. Overzealous 
expansion contributed to the timing and magnitude of a failure so enormous 
it necessitated massive public action. Put in these terms, the trajectory of Fred 
Goodwin looks and smells like reckless misconduct.12
Yet, for the better part of a decade, this was not obviously the case to the 
supervisors of RBS. In general, supervisors favored bigger banks, as they were 
considered safer. They had more capital and benefitted from economies of 
scale. During Fred Goodwin’s reign as CEO from 2001 to 2007, the cost-to-
income ratio at RBS improved markedly and profits, capital, and assets grew 
strongly. At the time, regulators oddly thought their job included making sure 
the banks were doing well, and RBS seemed to be doing so well that even 
though it had become the largest bank, they did not feel it warranted heavy 
scrutiny.13 The bond markets were unperturbed. Equity markets rewarded 
him with higher share prices. And in wasn’t only fevered markets that blessed 
his deeds. In 2004, Mr. Goodwin was knighted for services to the banking 
industry.14 Even in October 2008 after presiding over the largest loss in UK 
corporate history, the Daily Telegraph was still able to conclude, without a hint 
of irony, that Sir Fred’s “grasp of finance is in the Alpha class.”
12Those looking for an entertaining if highly charged telling of this Greek tragedy should 
read Ian Fraser, Shredded: Inside RBS, the Bank That Broke Britain (New York: Birlinn, 2014).
13At the height of RBS’s takeover of ABN Amro in August 2007, RBS, one of the world’s 
largest banks by assets, had six supervisors. Today, the much smaller, partly government-
owned institution has 23 supervisors.
14Perhaps this contributed to his worsening relationship with supervisors that occurred 
from around this time.

Chapter 11 | Why Locking Them Up Will Not Work
172
In Chapter 3 we observed that the tragicomedy of financial crashes is that 
today’s criminals were yesterday’s heroes. What appears in the hangover 
of the morning after to have been a reckless party seemed innovative and 
downright clever the night before. In the fatal words of Chuck Prince, for-
mer CEO of Citibank, “As long as the music is still playing you have to get 
up and dance.”15 My point here is that criminal convictions will be impossible 
unless the legal standards used to convict in the bust are completely different 
from those applied during the boom when the mistakes were being made. Yet 
where a person’s liberty is at stake, we must demand greater legal objectivity 
and certainty—even for bad guys, because it protects the innocent.
Bankers were allowed to place asymmetric bets in which they pocketed the 
gains while passing losses on to the taxpayers. The full range of fiscal and 
regulatory measures, coupled with civil remedies, must be used to alter these 
incentives. But as long as strong incentives to unsustainable behavior exist, 
locking up individual bandits is not going to save us from financial crashes. 
Continuing to believe otherwise will lead to dangerous complacency and the 
repitition of a costly cycle.
Financial crashes are the madness of crowds. We are not going to minimize 
the heavy financial, economic and social cost of crises if we do not deal with 
the collective delusions that underpin the booms. In Chapters 5 and 6 I sug-
gest ways of doing this, including automatically ratcheting up higher capital 
adequacy requirements as lending growth rises. But there is currently an 
unhealthy overreliance on capital adequacy which is hard to measure. We 
must not forget that the failed banks appeared well capitalized just a year 
before their collapse. It is imperative that we refocus bank safety away from 
malleable measurements and accounting. Whoever the individual bankers are, 
they will always and forever underestimate risks in the boom and overesti-
mate them in the bust. Future rules must be geared toward minimizing the 
structural mismatch between risk taking and risk capacity—and must do so 
across the financial sector rather than just across banks.16
What more can be done to chasten the reckless behavior of bankers? Gary 
Becker won the 1992 Nobel Prize in Economics for his work in applying eco-
nomics to a broad set of human behaviors.17 Becker showed that the incidence 
of wrong doing is less about the morality of individuals than we would like 
to think. The best predictor of “criminal” behavior (or, in our case, behavior 
15According to Prince, “When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be 
complicated. But as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still 
dancing.” Prince in an interview with the Financial Times in Japan, July 9, 2007.
16This is the main message of Chapters 5 and 6.

Chicago Press, 1978).

we don’t like and has adverse consequences) is whether it has a high return, 
which can be obtained with low risk.The objective of regulatory policy then is 
to lower the return and raise the risk of this behavior. The threat of jail would 
effectively raise the risk, but given the added threshold of certainty required, 
guilty verdicts will be few, potentially even less than under civil law.
One way of using law to raise the risk of bad behaviour that deserves closer 
scrutiny is directors’ liability insurance. Today this is paid by companies and 
so is not a check on directors. Banks should not be able to pay this insurance 
directly. Instead, directors should be made individually responsible for hav-
ing this insurance. Average directors pay would rise to compensate for this, 
but directors would face higher insurance premiums the more directorships 
they held and the more they proved a poor insurance risk. This could poten-
tially drive out bad directors and pull in better ones. The pool of directors 
is too shallow to begin with. Banning directors from working in finance for a 
long period if they were directors of a bank that had been bailed out by the 
taxpayer may also disincentivize reckless behavior. Implementation of these 
ideas would be tricky. How do we deal with a director who leaves just before 
a bailout? Furthermore, we need directors to stay on to help manage the 
restructuring that happens postcrisis. Sometimes they are the only ones who 
know “where the bodies were buried.”
We also need to pay attention to the return part of Gary Becker’s equation. 
Capping bonuses and taxing the churning of markets, as I discussed in Chapter 10  
and 12 respectively, would disincentivize the chasing of short-term returns 
that often contribute to bubbles and crashes.
Conclusion
We currently have a criminal law regime for financial misconduct, covering the 
manipulation of markets, fraud, insider trading, as well as laundering criminal 
money, or money destined for criminal or terrorist activity. There is modest 
scope to extend this to other areas where the crime and perpetrators are 
narrowly focused, easy to identify and not reliant on our future judgment of 
what was reasonable at the time. But the reach of criminal law cannot easily 
cover the kind of behavior that leads to the boom that leads to the crash. I 
argue in Chapter 3 that it is not a few knaves who bring down the system, but 
the crowd of greedy fools. Indeed, financial booms make fools of most of us. 
Thinking it is all about locking up the knaves may bring about personal satisfac-
tion, but it will not save the financial system. Our best defense against behavior 
that is collectively unsustainable is to disincentivize it. But we also need to be 
careful that by doing so, we do not merely shift that behavior to where it is 
unseen. We need to go further and bring all financial behavior into a regime 
that incentivizes sustainable behavior. That is at the heart of the reinvention of 
financial regulation that we proposed in Chapters 5 and 6.

Financial 
Transaction 
Taxes 
No subject is more certain to raise the hackles of traders in financial institutions 
than a financial transaction tax, however small. Measured for unleashing a torrent 
of abuse, it even edges out, in the City of London, the question of continuing to be 
part of the European Union. The traditional banker’s response, something I initially 
bought into, is to adopt a rather superior air that suggests that the protagonists 
do not understand the realities of finance. We would, in patronizing tones, remark 
that it would be a wonderful tax if only it were feasible. But lamentably, finance is 
now conducted in cyberspace, and cannot be tracked down and taxed.
My views changed when I became a bank director, jointly liable for the bank’s com-
pliance with anti-money laundering and counterterrorism financing rules. I quickly 
realized that banks are expected to know where the funds behind every transac-
tion come from and go to. They can and must track all their transactions. Failure to 
comply leaves banks and their directors vulnerable to substantial fines. Between 
2007 and 2014, cumulative fines and legal settlements on banks for contraven-
tion of rules on controls were in excess of $300 billion.1 I began listening more 
discerningly to the arguments my banker colleagues were using against financial 
transaction taxes and found them both factually incorrect and disingenuous.

C H A P T E R 
1I am including in this total the fines on J. P. Morgan for “egregious breakdowns in controls 
and governance” relating to its London whale-trading debacle in 2012 as well as fines on 
BNP Paribas, HSBC, UBS, Credit Suisse, and ABN Amro for sanctions and breaches of 
money laundering as well as aiding tax fraud.

Chapter 12 | Financial Transaction Taxes 
176
The Cassandras tell us that even a small tax, say 0.1 percent of the value of 
the purchase of a financial security as proposed by the European Commission, 
would usher in a nuclear winter for financial markets. It seems odd that the 
value added of our financial centers—and their highly paid bankers—is called 
into question and billions of dollars of business would drain away were we to 
impose the tiniest of transaction taxes. Is all the cleverness, superior exper-
tise and connectivity worth less than ten basis points? If financial services are 
supposedly as internationally substitutable as the decision of whether to pull 
into this gas station or one across the street, why are the bankers not also on 
minimum wage?
It is worth remembering that the economic and market impact of a transaction 
tax would be no greater than any other transaction cost. Consumers of finance 
already absorb costs that in total exceed the proposed transaction taxes and 
there is little industry disaffectation. These costs include broker commissions; 
trading spreads; the price impact of trading, clearing, settlement, and exchange 
fees; transaction-related research; risk management costs; and other trade 
administration costs. Traders and fund managers may make these “transac-
tion” costs opaque so they are more easily passed on to consumers either 
directly or indirectly through lower returns.2 In the United States, home to a 
competitive investment industry, transaction costs were estimated to range 
from 1.15 percent to 1.44 percent of assets under management per annum 
between 1995 and 2006.3 If a 0.1 percent turnover tax will cause tumbleweeds 
to roll across a deserted Wall Street or City of London, then we should be 
on high alert about the effect of these existing charges. Total transaction costs 
are annually equivalent to more than ten times the incidence of the proposed 
European Union Financial Transaction Tax and sometimes more.4
2Hidden costs are estimated to be in the region of 50–60 basis points. See David Blake, 
“On the Disclosure of the Costs of Investment Management,” (Discussion Paper PI-1407, 
London: Pensions Institute, Cass Business School, 2014), www.pensions-institute.org/
workingpapers/wp1407.pdf.
3In a study of approximately eighteen hundred US equity mutual funds from 1995 to 2006, 
aggregate trading costs were found to be 1.44 percent of assets under management, 
with hidden costs being around 0.55 percent. See Roger Edelen, Richard Evans, and 
Gregory Kadlec, “Shedding Light on ‘Invisible’ Costs: Trading Costs and Mutual Fund 
Performance,” Financial Analysts Journal 69 (2013), pp. 33–44. Similar results can be found 
in John C. Bogle, “The Arithmetic of ‘All-In’ Investment Expenses,” Financial Analysts 
Journal 70 (February 2014).
4The average pension fund turns over its portfolio once every three years, so a 0.1 percent 
turnover tax on the purchase of a security would be equivalent to a 0.033 percent per 
annum charge—one-twentieth of current annualized marginal costs.

Recent financial crises, and a career in the most liquid financial markets, has 
taught me that while low transaction costs are generally good, zero costs 
may ironically be bad. Systemic dangers lurk where there is no hindrance to 
activities that, through rapid velocity, give the impression of great citadels of 
value. When, for example, transaction costs are low, banks are incentivized to 
engage in a large amount of offsetting transactions. They earn commissions on 
the gross but are only exposed to the net. In quiet times, it is the net that is 
vital. However, in a crisis where everyone exits simultaneously and fear rages, 
many counterparties appear to be bust it is the gross exposures that will 
overwhelm the system. In earlier chapters, I discussed the Lehman Brothers 
default. At the time of its bankruptcy, when markets were in turmoil and 
credit counterparty risk5 was high, Lehman seemed to be facing a $400 billion 
loss on its gross credit derivative exposures. This itself generated new fears 
throughout the industry. Once governments had stepped in to underwrite the 
financial sector, and counterparty credit risk had abated, many of the contracts 
netted out. The eventual credit loss could end up being less than $6 billion.
Interest in new financial taxes has recently been revived in a number of  
different places for different reasons. In Europe, after the GFC turned private 
loss into public debt, campaigners are keen on the revenue-raising potential of 
transaction taxes, one-off bonus taxes, and mandatory self-insurance funds. In 
the EU, eleven member states have agreed to enhanced cooperation in placing 
a 0.1 percent tax on share transactions and a 0.01 percent tax on derivative 
transactions. They hope to collect up to $25 billion per annum.
In the United States, Michael Lewis’s Flash Boys, a tale of the abuse of ordinary 
investors by their high-frequency cousins, has garnered interest in the con-
sumer protection potential of charges or taxes on the churning of portfolios. 
Countries such as China, India, and Brazil have experimented with financial 
transaction taxes or other short-term capital inflow taxes. They view these 
measures as a way of calming overheated financial markets. When markets 
have been calmed, they have lowered the tax.
In their zeal to oppose these new proposals traders have suggested com-
plicated off-balance-sheet transactions that might evade the tax. This reveals 
both their cleverness and their complete disregard for their status as licensed, 
regulated entities. Supervisors require capital to be set aside for activities 
that create risks. Given the size of fines, bank shareholders should be deeply 
concerned when bankers show this lapse in recognition of their regulatory 
obligations. However, little is gained by debating the virtues of a policy that 
5To understand credit counterparty risk, consider that you took out insurance against the 
default of a supplier. The market risk in this contract is the risk of the supplier defaulting. 
The credit counterparty risk is the risk that, given a default, the insurance company that 
promised to pay in the event of a default, has gone bust, perhaps because it had insured 
too many against the same risk.

cannot be implemented. We begin by looking at the broad feasibility of finan-
cial transaction taxes in a world of unwilling participants. Having considered 
what is possible, we turn to issues of liquidity and stability. Risk-sensitive capi-
tal adequacy requirements, mandatory reserve, and insurance requirements 
have a similar economic impact to a tax and we have already covered these 
mechanisms in previous chapters. We use a similar analytical framework to 
consider the systemic implications of financial transaction taxes. My conclu-
sion on the desirability of financial transaction taxes is contrary to the current 
opinion among financial market participants and regulators. But it is simple 
and based on our previous analysis of systemic liquidity. Because some of the 
ideas I raise tend to be dismissed out of hand with false specificity, we look 
at the practical challenges of using fiscal instruments to regulate finance at a 
greater level of detail than we have devoted to other instruments.
The Feasibility of Financial Transaction Taxes
We can clearly see the persuasive power of repetition in the case of financial 
transaction taxes. The trading industry’s stock response is that unless transac-
tion taxes have both global coverage and enforcement they will be sidestepped. 
The industry repeats this maxim ad nauseam until it becomes the first thing 
non-experts spout. Given the obvious difficulty of getting over two hundred 
countries and territories to agree on anything, most also assume that financial 
transaction taxes must be the preserve of abstract theory. Yet national stamp 
duties on legal transactions are the most ancient, least avoided and toughest of 
all taxes to evade. There is no other major tax with a higher compliance rate by 
non-residents. In Europe, stamp duties stretch back at least to the middle of the 
sixth century.6 In the UK, following an earlier Dutch example, stamp duties were 
first established on June 28, 1694, to help finance the war against France. Almost 
three hundred years on, the UK’s 1986 Finance Act, among other things, lowered 
the rate of the stamp duty on share transactions to 0.5 percent and extended 
it to paperless transactions.7 The act also introduced a penalty rate of 1.5 per-
cent for deposits into depository-receipt, clearance, or nominee accounts, as 
these schemes could lead to tax avoidance—an approach we return to later. 
This most ancient of taxes has not stopped the UK from being the home of the 
fourth-largest stock exchange by market capitalization—worth $3.4 trillion in 
2013. The London Stock Exchange is one of the oldest8 and most international 
with a listing of three thousand companies from seventy different countries.
6The existence of a form of stamp duty in Europe can be traced back to Roman times, 
when Emperor Justinian decreed that there must be certain inscriptions on legal forms in 
order for them to be enforceable.
7In reference to these transactions, it is called the stamp duty reserve tax.
8In England, stock exchange activities began in the coffeehouses in the City of London, 
like Jonathan’s in the 17th century and later Garraway’s. Long before the white socks and 
red braces, the coffeehouses had been banned from trading in the Royal Exchange for 
excessively raucous behavior. The London Stock Exchange was formally established in 1801.

The UK’s opposition to the European Commission’s proposal for a financial 
transaction tax has been blunted by the UK’s own experience—as having 
one of the oldest and most successful examples of a financial transaction tax. 
In order to sharpen its opposition to the EU proposal, and despite a large 
budget deficit, the UK’s Conservative-led coalition government tried to show 
its dislike of the tax by granting additional exemptions to the UK stamp tax 
for share transactions.9 Prior to that, the tax collected was over €6 billion  
(or $8 billion) per annum, or approximately 0.8 percent of all UK tax revenues 
or 9.9% of UK Corporation Tax receipts.10 
Financial transaction taxes are often seen as ensuring that the financial indus-
try—where value-added taxes (VAT) are not imposed11—makes a more 
equitable contribution to public finance.12 More than 30 countries already 
collect approximately $38 billion per year through stamp duties on financial 
transactions.13 Other types of financial transaction taxes yield further revenue. 
Interestingly, many in the United States who passionately rail against the fea-
sibility of financial transaction taxes are unaware that since its formation in 
1934, the US SEC has been financed by a small financial transaction tax. The 
so-called Section 31 fee is paid by all the national securities exchanges based 
on the volume of securities sold on their markets. Over the decades, the fees 
have been raised and trimmed without warranting a murmur. The fee cur-
rently amounts to $18.40 per million dollars.
Stamp taxes on share and nonbearer bond transactions are near impossi-
ble to avoid because the legal title of these securities has to be registered. 
Transfer of title is not legally binding unless the certificate (electronic or oth-
erwise) has been stamped indicating that taxes have been paid. Relocating to 
a non-tax jurisdiction does not avoid the tax if you want to have legal owner-
ship of a share registered in a tax jurisdiction. It is estimated that more than 
50 percent of those people who pay the UK tax on share transactions are  
9The UK government announced that it would abolish the stamp duty and stamp duty 
reserve tax on transfers of interest in exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, and on transactions 
in securities admitted to trading on a recognized growth market (like the AIM, or alternative 
investment market) provided the market is not also listed on a recognized stock exchange.

11The banking industry argued that it would be hard to assess. No doubt it also said to 
governments, as it often does, that it is customers, as in voters, who will pay.

taxes. Brazil raises $15 billion each year from different types of financial transaction taxes, 
the UK $6 billion, and Taiwan $3–4 billion alone.

non-UK residents, the highest proportion of any major UK tax.14 The UK 
collects the tax mainly through CREST—the paperless electronic-settle-
ment and share-registration system administered by Euroclear in Brussels. As 
of 2014, Belgium did not itself have a financial transaction tax so this tax is 
being collected in a non-tax jurisdiction.15
There are different ways in which a financial transaction tax liability can arise. 
The stamp duty reflects the “issuance principle” where the tax arises not as a 
result of where the share is traded or the purchaser resident. Rather the key 
is where the security is issued or deemed to have been issued. A non-resident 
who chooses not to pay the tax can do so, but they will lack legal ownership 
of the share they have paid good money to purchase. The company issuing the 
share could move its residency. But many other salient factors drive the resi-
dency of a company including corporation taxes, the legal environment and 
commercial advantage. Saving a tax that investors in the secondary market for 
shares pay and which is a tiny fraction of their total transaction costs is not on 
par with these other factors. It is one of the reasons why, despite the tax being 
around since 1694 in the UK, giving ample time for lever financiers to inno-
vate ways around it, it still raises a large chunk of total corporation taxes. The 
feasibility of levying and collecting financial transaction taxes is not in doubt.
Transaction Taxes, Financial Stability and 
Economic Growth
I argued earlier that financial crashes invariably follow financial booms.16 The 
bigger the boom, the deeper will be the crash. One of the big issues in crisis 
prevention is therefore limiting the size of booms. In a seminal paper, DeLong 
and colleagues17 show that asset market booms can become large and self-
sustaining if there is a preponderance of “noise traders” in the market. They 
suggest that we have essentially two kinds of traders. The first are the so-
called fundamental traders, pursuing value and who tend to be sellers during 
booms when financial prices rise above historical metrics of value. In crashes

they become buyers. Finding value is a long-term goal and can lead to short-
term losses. They resemble investors managing a long-term pension fund, life 
insurer or sovereign wealth fund. 
Not all investors can cope with short-term losses. In a world of uncertainty 
concerning where long-term value lies, capital constraints and risk limits,  
clients have become increasingly risk averse when markets are going against 
them. Consequently, there is second type of trader, who DeLong et al call 
noise traders. Noise traders focus on momentum strategies, buying when 
markets have risen in the past and selling when they have fallen. Many hedge 
funds and High Frequency Traders resemble noise traders. Rather than stub-
bornly selling into a boom, they will buy from the fundamental sellers and gain 
short-term profit if prices continue to rise. Once prices are rising and noise 
traders are profiting, more noise traders will enter the market to buy. As 
prices rise above their fundamental value, the more fundamental traders will 
sell to noise traders and exit. This creates a self-feeding bubble, pulling mar-
kets further away from their long-term value. This process has a natural limit, 
as there comes a point when there are no more fundamental traders left to 
sell to the trend followers. DeLong’s work as well as subsequent experimental 
and empirical studies, reveal a threshold above which the bubble collapses 
upon itself. 
The presence of a significant number of momentum-driven, short-term noise 
traders makes a market susceptible to bubbles. Bubbles lead to crashes so 
the more noise traders there are, the greater the systemic risk. Small transac-
tion costs create a return hurdle for short-term traders—one that is far less 
relevant to long-term traders. Consider the following simple example using a 
0.1% tax on security purchase and sale. The long run, average, annual return 
to equities is approximately 7.5 percent per annum.18 A long-term investor 
turning over his portfolio once every three years—the average of most pen-
sion funds—can expect a return of about 22.5 percent over these three years 
(approximately 7.5 percent x 3) His effective annual tax rate would be less 
than 1 percent of his return (0.1 percent x 2 ÷ 22.5 percent). To be clear, this 
is 1.0 percent, not percentage points, meaning that he is left with 99 percent of 
the return. A short-term momentum trader, turning over his investment port-
folio weekly, can expect to generate an average return of 0.14 percent over 
seven days (7.5 percent ÷ 52). He would pay more than that in a 0.1 percent 
transaction tax levied on both sides of the trade. His effective taxation for a 
week is over 100 percent and so he would not trade. The incidence of the 
transaction tax rises as trading behavior shifts from long term to short term. 
That is the intention.

Given the link between the number of noise traders and systemic risks, this 
is a classic Pigouvian tax—a tax applied to an activity that is generating nega-
tive externalities (costs for others). Realistically we cannot always calculate 
negative externalities precisely so governments try to at least make Pigouvian 
taxes proportional to the amount of the activity they are trying to offset.19 
The more pollution a company produces the more taxes it can expect to pay. 
Why is a Pigouvian tax needed in financial transactions? Assume a broker with 
two customers. One customer, more akin to a fundamental trader, turns over 
her entire portfolio (a pension fund or life insurance institution) once every 
three years while the other, similar to a noise trader, turns over his portfo-
lio perhaps more than 52 times annually. Which of the customers generates 
more commissions, more market information, and greater financial flows for 
the broker? Often modestly sized hedge funds of a couple billion dollars gen-
erate more profit for banks, brokers and exchanges than the mammoth pen-
sion fund with hundreds of billions of dollars under management. US stock 
exchanges report that high-frequency traders accounted for approximately 
50 percent of US equity trading volume—a number that in times of stress, as 
in 2009, rises to between 60 and 73 percent.20 It is little wonder that, as dis-
cussed in earlier chapters, it has been alleged that banks were allowing their 
high-frequency trading clients to take advantage of their institutional clients in 
dark pools of liquidity. This is exactly why we need a Pigouvian tax. Untaxed, 
the natural order is for the system to favor high-frequency trading over low-
frequency trading with potentially serious systemic risks. Predictably, however, 
banks are vehemently opposed to financial transaction taxes believing it will 
probably kill off an important income stream.
In other areas of economic life, taxes based on the value of an activity are 
considered more efficient than taxes based on volumes and transactions. The 
IMF, among others, has proposed taxes on bank balance sheets to disincentiv-
ize banks growing into a systemically important institution, or taxes based on 
the amount of lending activity.21 However, given the inducements for traders 
to be involved in churning of their clients’ portfolios coupled with the role of 
short-term, “noise”, trading in asset market bubbles, it is hard to find a more 
direct measure to deal with this key source of financial instability. 
19Arthur Cecil Pigou was a 19th-century Cambridge economist who made substantial 
contributions to the discussion of the divergences between the socially optimal outcome 
and the one left purely to market forces—negative externalities. See A. C. Pigou,

Transaction Taxes and Financial Liquidity 
In response to arguments that a financial transaction tax will strengthen finan-
cial resilience, bankers have responded with research purporting to show that 
high-frequency trading improves liquidity. It must, the argument goes, there-
fore reduce volatility and, by extension, financial transaction taxes will cause 
liquidity to fall and volatility to rise. This reflects unfamiliarity with what liquidity 
actually is. Indeed, many of the young econometricians doing these exercises 
have had limited experience of markets and crisis.
While high turnover is a common symptom of liquidity, financial market liquidity 
is actually about diversity.22 A market with only two participants would be highly 
liquid if whenever one wants to buy, the other wants to sell. A market with a thou-
sand participants who each use the same model to value assets and have the same 
trading strategies, so that when one wants to buy so do the other 999, would be 
highly illiquid. During trendless times, high-frequency traders tend to adopt con-
trarian strategies. They buy when the market is moving down and sell when the 
market is moving up. At these times, when data is plentiful and the econometri-
cians run their tests, high-frequency trading adds to liquidity. But they are adding 
to liquidity when it is already in abundance. When volatility is low, turnover is high, 
and therefore bid-ask spreads (the difference between the buy and sell levels of 
traders) are also depressed. In times of crisis or sharp market moves, the short-
term trading models become momentum driven and high-frequency traders try 
to run ahead of the trend.23 They are draining liquidity and doing so when the 
system needs it most. A graphic illustration was the “Flash Crash” on May 6, 2010. 
A significant amount of cross-sectional24 evidence of high-frequency traders 
and their program and algorithmic cousins trying to run ahead of sell orders 
exists. However, the time-series data has breaks in it where data is simply 
unavailable. The econometricians don’t run their models over these time peri-
ods because at these points time-series data is sparse and unreliable.25 Traders 
post wide bid-ask spreads to turn away customers and volatility is high. But 
we know that unless high-frequency traders deliberately act as contrarians in 
these events and have the capital to carry large losses, they cannot be adding 
to liquidity. We can safely conclude that high-frequency trading adds to liquid-
ity when it is already plentiful and takes it away when it is most needed. 
22See Avinash Persaud, Liquidity Black Holes (Discussion Paper 2002/31, Helinski, Finland: 
UNU/WIDER, 2002).
23This piece of reality is not part of the model in DeLong et al’s paper. However, their results 
would not change if the model was augmented with the simple idea that noise traders don’t have 
one strategy but learn quickly. They adopt contrarian strategies when market are directionless 
and momentum strategies when they exhibit strong movements in one direction or the other.

25This reminds me of the economist joke where one night a man comes across an economist 
looking for his lost wallet under a streetlight and offers to help. After some time looking, 
the man asks the economist if he is sure he dropped it there and the economist says, “No, 
I didn’t drop it here but this is where the light is.”

Chapter 12 | Financial Transaction Taxes

Another disingenuous argument that banks and traders use against financial 
transaction taxes involves computing the economic cost of increasing transac-
tion costs and lost business they might experience. Implicit in their calculation 
is that transaction costs that go to the private sector generates GDP and 
transaction costs that go to the state falls into a botomless pit. The European 
Commission originally estimated that their proposed 0.1 percent financial 
transaction tax will lower GDP by approximately 0.2 percent.26 All taxes 
lower GDP if you fail to take into account either the reduction of negative 
social externalities or that the cash is used in some way to lower corpora-
tion taxes, labor taxes, reduce debt or any other activity that actually boosts 
GDP. In any event, the figure is likely to be an overestimation. The economic 
forecasting model used by the European Commission also assumed that the 
cost of capital rises by the same amount for everyone in the economy. This 
assumes away that only 15% of investment is financed by the issuance of equity 
and debt securities27 and the difference in the incidence of the tax caused by 
different holding periods. A transaction tax will raise the cost of capital for 
long-term investors by far less than for short-term traders.
Even if we ignore these issues, once we reflect on the economic costs of 
financial crisis, transaction taxes only have to contribute a tiny reduction in 
the risk of asset market bubbles in order to have a net positive effect. Reinhart 
and Rogoff estimate that, from peak to trough, the average fall in per capita 
GDP resulting from major financial crises is 9 percent.28 The UK’s Institute of 
Fiscal Studies suggest that, based on its comparison between the real median 
household income in 2009–10 and that of 2012–3, the impact of the GFC was 
a 7.4 percent decline in real incomes. European countries like Greece, directly 
hit by the sovereign debt crisis, experienced a greater decline in GDP and 
incomes. During the Asian Financial Crisis, initial GDP losses were also far 
larger, at around 20 percent. Consequently, even assuming revenues are buried 
in a hole in the ground, the tax only has to limit noise trading to the extent 
that it creates a 2 percent reduction in the probability, or size of, a major  
bubble and bust that occurs once every seven years or so. Estimating the 
26Based on the most recent data from the European Commission as well as the Bank for 
International Settlements, the sources of financing companies are assumed to be: primary 
equity issuance (10 percent), retained earnings (55 percent) and debt (35 percent). Among 
the total debt of nonfinancial corporations, the share of debt securities could be estimated 
at about 15 percent (or about 5 percent of total financing). This mitigating factor is now 
incorporated into the second version of the model (see Julia Lendvai, Rafal Raciborskiz and 
Lucas Vogel, Securities Transaction Taxes: Macroeconomic Implications in a General Equilibrium 
Model, Economic and Financial Affairs, Economic Papers 450, EU Commission, March 2012, 
Brussels), which has brought down the estimated growth effects of FTT to –0.2 percent 
of GDP.

costs, causes and probability of crisis is fraught with difficulty. Yet the tiny 
impact on the probability of crisis required to produce a meaningful difference 
to GDP, the small estimated costs involved, and the ability to reverse course if 
necessary, means that it is worth trying. 
Avoiding Financial Transaction Taxes 
The traders’ argument against transaction taxes has a curiously religious slant. 
They present these taxes as uniquely evil even though the issues of imple-
mentation, avoidance, and evasion are common to many taxes and charges. 
Consequently, there are some general observations to make when consider-
ing the argument that the tax will simply be avoided. Inherent in all taxes is the 
incentive and potential for avoidance and evasion, occurring proportionally 
to the size of the tax. Therefore, as with all taxes, it is important to set the 
right tax rate. Bear in mind too that modest cost variations caused by dif-
ferent taxes or other costs are sustainable. Within the OECD, for example, 
corporate income and profits taxes range from in Denmark’s 60.9 percent 
to the Slovak Republic’s 17.9 percent. The magnitude of this divergence has 
been fairly constant over a period where Denmark enjoyed one of the highest 
levels of GDP per capita in the world, and, incidentally, measures of happi-
ness. Fear over the relocation of trading as a result of a small transaction tax 
is overstated. Despite the UK having a financial transaction tax while several 
stock markets do not, the London Stock Exchange has emerged as one of 
the largest, most liquid stock markets in the world. Low-tax Switzerland has 
a financial transaction tax. A financial transaction tax has long coexisted with 
a vibrant and rapidly growing stock market in places like Hong Kong, India, 
Taiwan, and South Africa. Three-quarters of the members of both the G-8 
leading industrialized economies and the G-20 grouping of the largest econo-
mies in the world levy some form of financial transaction tax.
To require transaction taxes to be 100 percent avoidance proof is to set a 
bar not required for any other tax. The reality is that stamp taxes have much 
higher rates of collection and lower collection costs than almost all other 
taxes. Ordinary shares and nonbearer bonds have centralized registries of 
ownership, which are usually located where the issuer is headquartered or  
the shares listed.29 You will recall that in stamp duty jurisdictions, unless the 
share certificate (these days an electronic document) has been stamped to 
prove that all taxes have been paid, the transfer of title is not legally enforce-
able. This process guarantees that stamp duties on financial transactions are 
some of the least avoided taxes—with nonresidents taxpayers lining up to pay 
rather than risk not having legal title to a share they purchased. 
29Moving corporate headquarters is a major deal and when this is done merely for tax 
purposes, such as in the case of mergers motivated by tax inversions, the tax authorities can 
sometimes neutralize the tax effect of the inversion, as was the case with US-headquartered 
AbbVie’s 2014 proposed $54 billon takeover of rival drug maker Shire.

Chapter 12 | Financial Transaction Taxes 
186
Derivatives
Not all securities have centralized registries where shares are listed. Anyone 
can write a contract where value is derived from the price of anything else, 
including a share or bond, without ever having title to that share or bond. 
We can make an agreement that if the price of BP shares rise above £5.5030 
before June 2020,31 I will pay you £1,000.32 In return for this contingent liability, 
you agree to pay me a consideration, determined by our assessment of the 
likelihood of the payout, of maybe £250.33 Simple options like these, known 
colloquially as “vanilla” options, are essentially insurance contracts where one 
party is insuring against a financial event taking place and paying a premium 
for that insurance while the counterparty is underwriting the insurance and 
receiving a premium.34 The person with the contingent liability is the insurer, 
otherwise known as the writer or seller of the option, and the person paying 
the insurer the premium is the insurance holder or option buyer.35
An importer of Venezuelan oil, for example, on reading the international finan-
cial press, may become anxious that the Venezuelan oil company PDVSA is in 
financial difficulty and will renege on its commitment to supply it with oil. If 
this happened the importer would in turn find it impossible to fulfill supply 
contracts to his customers, leading to penalties amounting to, say, $1 million. 
An advisable course of action would be for the importer to buy a credit 
default swap issued by an investment bank that would pay it $1 million if 
PDVSA declared a default. Residency in Venezuela is not a requirement for 
issuing or buying this insurance. Indeed, derivative contracts can be written 
on any verifiable event, taking place anywhere, and can be issued by anyone 
competent and sold anywhere. The issuance principle of taxing transactions 
cannot capture a tax on such derivative transactions.
30This is known as the strike price of the option.
31This is known as the option expiry date.
32This is the notional value of this option.
33This is the option premium.
34In Chapter 7, we noted that the connection between insurance and derivatives was 
not lost on the insurance firm AIG, especially where the capital requirements on the net 
insurance exposures of highly rated packages of credit insurance were lower than the 
capital requirements a bank would have needed for loans to those same credits. This 
provided an arbitrage opportunity across banking and insurance lines. AIG bulked up on 
both writing and buying insurance on highly rated packages of credit risks. This strategy 
exploded when the financial crisis hit, at which point AIG’s insured events coincided with 
the collapse of the credit quality of those who sold the offsetting insurance contracts. The 
corporation’s exposure moved from a tiny net position to the larger gross position.
35Complex options are nothing more than the layering of a series of vanilla options. For 
instance, I may pay you if the price of BP shares rises above £5.50 as before, but now we might 
add an overlapping option where you will have to pay me the same amount if the price rises 
above £6.00, so that my exposure only lies between £5.50 and £6.00. Known as a collar, buyers 
of these options tend to be those with a view that prices will move within a small range and 
are really placing more of a bet on volatility being low than on a specific price being reached.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
187
Opponents of a financial transaction tax jump up and down with glee at this 
point. Before we assess how to address this loophole, it is worth asking why, 
after three centuries of financial innovation in the UK and elsewhere, all trans-
actions subject to a tax on a title transfer have not shifted to the derivatives 
market. There are two main reasons why the failure to place taxes on deriva-
tives has not, and never will be, fatal to transaction taxes. First, the stock mar-
ket is the market for corporate control. Large institutional investors, investor 
activists, socially responsible investors, and corporate raiders—who together 
account for more than two-thirds of all investors in equities by assets—own 
shares so that they can influence corporate decisions. Unless they have good 
title to the shares, they cannot attend the annual general meeting, demand 
board membership, exercise corporate social responsibility, earn dividends, 
benefit from a scrip or bonus issue,36 or protect against dilution of interest 
in a rights issue.37 Given the range of corporate actions that are possible, 
such as rights issues, mergers, spin-offs, and acquisitions, owning good title to 
shares provides essential investor protection of both interests and returns. 
The majority of shareholders need to own their shares rather than only ben-
efiting from short-term price movements.
The other key reason why the failure to tax derivatives is not a fatal blow to 
a financial transaction tax is that derivative contracts mainly give the right or 
obligation to purchase/sell shares at some future date. Unless on expiry the 
derivative contract becomes worthless, one party will purchase or sell the 
shares on which the derivative contract was written. Even when a derivative 
is settled with a cash payment, current market practice will hedge shifts in 
this potential cash payment or receipt through transactions in the stock mar-
ket. It is the most efficient hedge of the potential exposure. If the likelihood 
increases that a holder of a derivative will have to buy a share at a higher 
future price and deliver it at a fixed lower price (having sold a call option), she 
will hedge that potential loss by buying some shares today. Holding derivative 
contracts often spurs one, sometimes multiple, transactions in the underlying 
cash market. A tax on transactions in the underlying market will reduce the 
frequency of these hedging derivative transactions in that market but hedging 
will still take place, as the potential costs of not doing so will more than offset 
the benefit of saving a little tax. In the case of the proposed European Union 
financial transaction tax this saving is just 0.01 percent tax on the notional 
value of a derivative or 0.1 percent of its economic value.
36A scrip or bonus issue is one where a company’s cash reserves or part are converted 
into shares and distributed proportionally to existing shareholders.
37A rights issue is one where a company issues new shares and gives existing shareholders 
a first right of refusal in taking up those shares, and therefore does not suffer a dilution in 
the proportion of the outstanding shares that they own.

While it may be unnecessary, there is scope to tax derivative transactions, but 
not through the issuance principle. The issuance principle is not the only or 
even the main principle of taxation used in finance. The current international 
practice is to levy income and capital gains taxes on the proceeds from shares 
held by residents. The incidence of this tax falls on residents whether the shares 
are registered locally or overseas, purchased using a local or overseas broker, or 
held by a local or overseas custodian. Tax residency rather than issuance is key. 
A financial transaction tax based on both the issuance and residency principles, 
as proposed by the European Commission38 and introduced by the French and 
Italian authorities in 2012 and 2013, respectively, will capture residents’ transac-
tions in derivative or collective instruments including those that are “off market.”
Where the tax is due, but the trade has taken place in a foreign jurisdiction 
that does not levy a tax of its own and so is not automatically deducted by the 
clearing agent, residents would be liable for reporting the transaction and pay-
ing the tax. This can be done through annual tax returns as is currently done 
for the assessment of capital gains tax39 or more frequently if the jurisdiction 
desires. In the UK, for example, if the relevant agent has not automatically 
deducted the tax at the point of clearing or settlement, residents must, within 
one month, report transactions and are subject to interest and penalties for 
any delay. Other countries could easily adopt this practice.
Given that transactions are not legally enforceable in tax jurisdiction coun-
tries if the tax is outstanding, clearing and settlement houses would be incen-
tivized for the sake of legal certainty to collect relevant transaction taxes at 
the point of clearing. Requirements introduced after the GFC that required 
all vanilla derivatives to be centrally cleared would make this the most likely 
route for collection—even under the residency principle. We discuss central 
clearing in greater detail later. However, assuming that clearinghouses40 always 
act in their best self-interest, they are likely to collect the tax without any 
38See the European Commission, “Taxation of the Financial Sector: The Proposal 
of 14 February 2013,” European Commission, last updated April 14, 2014,

sector/index_en.htm#prop.
39Note that in the assessment of capital gains tax on shares, in those jurisdictions that have 
capital gains taxes, information is required and already routinely disclosed on purchase and 
sale prices and times.
40Clearing describes the activities that take place between the time a trade is agreed upon 
and the time when all the relevant payments are completed. Where millions of trades 
are agreed on daily, prices move around substantially through a day, and, as it takes 24–48 
hours to settle trades, there is a potential for many a trade to slip twixt the cup and the 
lip. During clearing, one of the parties may go bust, leaving the other without the security 
it has paid for, or, having transferred the security, without the cash that is owed. Given 
that a small number of financial institutions are party to the majority of trades, it is safer 
and cheaper to have a centralized place—the central clearinghouse—where exposures 
between approved counterparties may be netted out so there only needs to be collateral 
and cash to cover the small net exposures and not the large gross exposures.

regulatory encouragement—as they have done with the UK stamp duty. The 
trading industry argues that this would incentivize traders to evade central 
clearing and undermine financial stability. This is an oddly desperate argument, 
evocative of an age when the industry routinely threatened bad behavior in 
order to get its way. The tax would be due irrespective of whether the instru-
ment is cleared or not. The capital charge and management risks of uncleared 
instruments would anyway make such evasion both pointless and expensive.
The New International Tax Environment 
Up until 2008, the opportunities for avoiding or evading transaction taxes 
levied on the residency principle were far greater than those levied on the 
issuance principle. Tax residents in one country could set up a shell company 
in another that did not levy a tax and did not have a legal or enforced require-
ment to disclose the residency of beneficial owners. They could then purchase 
derivatives on shares registered in a financial transaction tax jurisdiction with-
out paying the tax. Although it was not a major cause of the crisis, regulators 
trying to manage bank failures during the GFC often found themselves caught 
in a morass of legal entities established largely for the purpose, and I am being 
kind, of tax minimization. In the Lehman bankruptcy, administrators had to 
grapple with about three thousand different subsidiaries. It is foreseeable that 
those familiar with this mode of operation believe that a transaction tax based 
on the residency principle would simply push derivatives trading elsewhere. 
The trading industry has made several governments worried about this pros-
pect. But times have changed.
Finance used to be presented as something ethereal—materializing momen-
tarily before disappearing again and impossible to pin down, report, and tax. 
Whether that was ever true, events over the past 15 years have changed that 
perception. The 9/11 tragedy spawned new, tough anti-money laundering and 
antiterrorist financing measures and rules. Then came the GFC, which reinvig-
orated the role of the tax, licensing, and regulatory authorities. There will be 
much skepticism on the efficacy of international tax assistance, especially after 
what took place before the financial crisis and what has since been revealed 
about the absurdly low taxes paid by major nonfinancial corporations such as 
Apple, Amazon, Google, and Starbucks. These corporations utilized several 
schemes to avoid corporate tax, including tax inversion-driven mergers, base 
erosion, profit shifting, the “Dutch sandwich” and the “double Irish”41 schemes.
41The “double Irish” scheme is a tax minimization strategy that appears to rely on the 
fact that Ireland does not levy significant taxes on income booked in subsidiaries of Irish 
companies that are outside of Ireland.

Chapter 12 | Financial Transaction Taxes

However, several recent developments collectively suggest that in the future 
we can rely far more on the residency principle for the taxation of financial 
activity in general, and derivative instruments specifically, in a way we could 
not prior to 2008. One of the most important occurrences must be the new 
anti-money laundering regime sponsored by the 36-member Financial Action 
Task Force and its eight associate regional task forces. A measure of the effects 
of this new regime is found in the fieldwork of Michael Findley and colleagues, 
who have looked at the ease with which shell companies can be set up across 
the world.42 This work, initially done in 2010 and updated in 2012, shows 
that in many of the international financial centers of small states, where it is 
often thought that compliance is problematic, it is no longer possible to estab-
lish shell companies. This is true for the island of Jersey, the Cayman Islands, 
the British Virgin Islands, Monaco, Gibraltar, Luxembourg, the United Arab 
Emirates, the Seychelles, Bahamas, the Isle of Man, Barbados, and Bermuda. 
These jurisdictions no longer find bearer bonds admissible as vehicles for 
corporate ownership or for any financial purpose such as collateral for loans.
Ironically, the worst performers in this field experiment were actually the 
major jurisdictions that were the most vocal about the role of small states in 
international tax evasion—the United States, the UK, Canada, and Australia. 
There is further work to be done on eliminating shell companies, but Findlay 
and colleagues suggest that much has already changed in the outposts of inter-
national finance. What needs focus is at home, in countries that delight in 
publicly berating foreign companies and small jurisdictions, and falsely boast 
that they are leading the fight against international tax avoidance. This should 
not be difficult to correct but these issues are more political than most real-
ize and relate to a point we introduced in Chapters 3 and 5 on the desire 
of regulators in big financial centers to promote their particular centers and 
national firms.
The failure of several larger economies to “walk the talk” on eliminating shell 
companies makes important the G-20’s call at its April 2009 London Summit 
to amend and extend the OECD Convention on Multilateral Assistance in 
Tax Matters. In 2010, the convention was significantly amended to provide for 
all possible forms of administrative cooperation between states in the assess-
ment and collection of taxes, including automatic exchanges of information 
and the recovery of foreign tax claims. To date, 70 countries have signed the 
convention, including all major financial centers.43

In March 2010, another major event occurred with the passing of the Foreign 
Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) in the US Congress, which requires 
US citizens, including those living outside the United States, to report their 
financial accounts held outside US jurisdiction. FATCA also requires foreign 
financial institutions, under threat of severe sanctions for noncompliance, to 
report to the IRS.44 There does not seem to be an American translation for 
“extraterritorial.” Thirty countries, including all European and G-7 countries, 
have already established local rules mandating their local institutions to com-
ply with FATCA. The reason this is especially significant is that based on the 
United States establishing this principle and model, and getting it expensively 
complied with abroad, the UK and the EU have openly discussed replicating 
it, using the growing network of compliance agreements. A European FATCA 
is probably on its way. The European Commission is waiting for details of 
the automatic tax-information-exchange model that is part of the OECD 
Multilateral Convention.45 If that is unsatisfactory, it might consider extending 
the administrative cooperation directive to cover all tax administration. The 
repercussions of FATCA and some of the European initiatives must not be 
underestimated. Had they been in place in 1963, the London Eurobond mar-
ket would not have developed.
The GFC has pushed us to a point where the reporting of exposures of 
licensed financial institutions’, on and off balance sheet, is mandatory, and as 
mentioned earlier, central clearing and settlement is required of the most heav-
ily traded financial products.46 The measures that have created this situation 
include, most importantly, the European Parliament and Council’s Regulation 
on OTC) Derivatives, Central Counterparties, and Trade Repositories

46The purpose of this requirement is to limit the systemic risk caused by the failure of a 
single counterparty. During good times, the counterparty may appear to present a small 
risk, but this may be because it is engaged in a large number of back-to-back transactions. 
If the counterparty fails and all of these underlying transactions fail, the system could fail. 
However, if there is an agreement through a clearinghouse on how this will be managed in 
the event of failure and how back-to-back contracts that net out will be handled and the 
net risk insured against, the risk of systemic failure could be avoided. The confidence this 
brings will spur activity.

(EMIR).47 It is estimated that by 2015 the notional value of over-the-counter 
(OTC) derivatives that are centrally cleared will be in excess of $470 trillion.48 
Institutions failing to comply will suffer severe penalties and will be eliminated 
from crucial access to funding, payment systems, and licensed activities. To be 
non-compliant would amount to a financial death penalty.
Related to such measures is a newfound aggression by regulatory authori-
ties in fining institutions and pursuing those they suspect of criminal actions. 
Credit Suisse was caught in this net and in 2014 agreed to pay a $2.6 billion 
fine and plead guilty to helping US citizens evade taxes due based on the 
residency principle. That guilty plea could escalate the eventual total cost to 
Credit Suisse. A number of its counterparties are forbidden by their internal 
rules to work with convicted felons. The United States also fined BNP Paribas 
more than $10 billon and barred it from dollar-clearing facilities for a period in 
order to settle allegations that it violated trade sanctions by disguising trans-
actions with Iran, Sudan, and Cuba. On the announcement of the fine, a further  
$10 billion was wiped off the share value of BNP through fear of the impact 
the temporary removal of dollar clearing would have on its business. HSBC 
was earlier fined $1.9 billion for routinely handling money transfers from 
countries under sanctions and from Mexican drug traffickers.
This new regime of increased reporting and closer supervision has bit hard, 
and several institutions have vacated whole sectors where they are unsure of 
compliance. Concerns have been voiced that these enforcement measures are 
being used politically and thus inefficiently. A level playing field does not exist. 
Large countries make the rules, which they do not apply to themselves, but are 
not shy to apply to countries or companies that cannot object or retaliate.49 
What is clear, however, is that there are mechanisms in place to make financial 
taxes based on residency and issuance work, if policy makers are prepared to 
use them.
47The European Parliament and Council issued this regulation on July 4, 2012, and it 
entered into force on August 16, 2012. The implementing standards were published in 
the Official Journal of December 21, 2012. The main obligations of EMIR are the central 
clearing for certain (vanilla) classes of OTC derivatives; the application of risk mitigation 
techniques for non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives; the reporting of all transactions 
to trade repositories; the application of organizational conduct of business; prudential 
requirements for central clearinghouses; and the application of requirements for trade 
repositories, including the duty to make certain data available to the public and relevant 
authorities.

The trading industry’s opposition to a tax that they say will not work is 
immense. The strategy they employ is similar to the tobacco industry in the 
1970s, namely, obfuscation of the issues, ridicule of its proponents and rep-
etition of falsehoods to such an extent that listeners feel they must be right. 
Although we have already set out the case for financial transaction taxes, we 
now turn to assess some of common arguments used against these taxes. 
Following that we will look at the issue of tax rates and instruments and then 
conclude.
Lessons from the 1984 Swedish Tax
The requirement to disclose the beneficial owner of a company was not in 
place in 1984 when Sweden initiated a 0.5 percent financial transaction tax, 
raised to 1.0 percent in 1986. It was levied entirely on the residency principle 
and collected by local brokers. Swedes wanting to evade it established non-
resident accounts in London and traded in Swedish stocks from there. Tax 
revenues were lower than expected as a result. Had the tax also included the 
issuance principle rather than relying solely on the residency principle, the 
result would have been different. It would have ensured that all purchasers of 
Swedish shares, regardless of location, would have to pay the tax to secure 
legal title to the shares. 
This poorly designed tax also suffered from being introduced in an age when 
residents could evade taxes by going offshore and establishing nonresident 
entities with the active encouragement of their brokers, bankers, and some-
times the foreign jurisdiction itself. London’s current position as one of the 
world’s largest offshore financial centers started with turning a blind eye 
to the tax status of its foreign clients and the creation of an offshore bond 
market.50 It has continued with favorable tax treatment of income and capi-
tal gains for those in the hedge-fund and private-equity sectors. Today the 
Swedish tax could not be so easily evaded. The Swedish beneficial ownership 
of the London entities would have to be declared in order for the entities to 
be established. Without declaring their beneficial ownership, Swedes cannot 
open a bank account from which to trade or have an account with a counter-
party licensed to broker Swedish shares in London or Stockholm. Once the 
beneficial owners are established, with an automatic exchange of tax informa-
tion, a tax demand would follow with penalties for late payment. Failure to 
comply with either the Swedish or British tax authorities would leave the

directors of the corporate service companies, banks, or brokers open upon 
conviction to five years imprisonment, fines in excess of $500,000, or both. 
The times they are a-changin.51 
No tax is watertight. Estimates suggest that between 20 and 30 percent of 
income tax is either evaded or avoided. But this loss has not lead to an out-
cry that income tax should be scrapped. The standard of compliance being 
required of financial taxes is excessive. Tax authorities exist to make tax eva-
sion, money laundering, the financing of terrorism, corruption of public officials 
or any other illegal activity a high-risk, low-return game so that illegal conduct 
is kept to a minimum. The impact on banking practice of recent develop-
ments is clear, with banks weighing up the new balance of risks very differently 
from how they did in the 1980s when Sweden imposed its tax. Recently, for 
instance, citing the new legal environment and heavy financial sanctions for 
inadvertently assisting any illegal activity, J. P. Morgan’s board decided to with-
draw banking services to any (non-American) on a list of politically exposed 
persons. RBC has joined in stating that the cost of anti-money laundering pro-
cesses and sanction for breach of those processes was a factor in deciding to 
withdraw its wealth management business from certain jurisdictions.52
A strong disincentive for tax evasion and avoidance is to make all untaxed, tax-
able instruments null and void—even where this is limited to financial transac-
tion tax jurisdictions. While a derivative transaction could initially take place 
between non-residents of a tax jurisdiction, a significant part of the value 
of an instrument, far in excess of the value of a 0.1 percent tax, is its wide 
marketability and transferability. An untaxed instrument that cannot be trans-
ferred or marketed to a resident in a financial transaction tax jurisdiction has 
a severely reduced value to the point where it would be better to pay the tax. 
This is especially so if the instrument is based on a security issued in the tax 
jurisdiction where its natural buyers would reside.
Moreover, financial trades including derivative contracts are essentially zero-
sum games. If I win it is because you lose. The potential winner has a strong 
incentive to verify that the loser cannot cancel their loss (and the winner’s 
gain) by moving their tax residency, or the tax residency of the beneficial owner, 
to a financial transaction tax jurisdiction and letting the instrument become 
null and void. At the start of life for a derivative contract, each side thinks it 
will win. Both parties are therefore incentivized to pay the tax upfront—a tax 
significantly lower than the profits each hopes to make. It is possible that even 
residents outside of financial transaction tax jurisdictions who are trading 
instruments related to, but not issued in, a tax jurisdiction, would want to vol-
untarily pay the tax. It is a simple and inexpensive insurance against the risk of

the contract becoming null and void in the future. One party to the contract 
should be able to ensure that the instrument never becomes null and void, 
whatever the other parties do, by paying all taxes due. 
The trading industry will strenuously object to the potential legal uncertainty 
of a null-and-void rule. Yet, in this instance, uncertainty for untaxed instru-
ments is precisely the incentive we need to secure compliance. We can also 
address this issue less combatively by encouraging the development of a stan-
dardized amendment to the documentation of these contracts (ISDA/FIA53) 
that provides for the automatic payment of the tax if one or both parties is 
a resident, or the beneficial owner is a resident, of a financial transaction tax 
jurisdiction. Amendments to ISDA contracts have already been introduced to 
deal with exceptional matters, such as bond instruments with collective action 
clauses or for those following Sharia law.54
Relocation of Business 
Financial sector lobbyists routinely threaten that banks will aggressively relo-
cate if national governments impose significant taxes on their activities or 
employees. In 2008, Terry Smith, head of Tullet Prebon, grandly stated he 
would allow any of the company’s 950 London-based staff to move overseas 
before the UK’s 50p top tax rate came into force. The Guardian reported on 
April 14, 2010, that so far “none . . . have taken him up on the offer.” Relocation 
is much harder than the financial sector suggests.
The residency incidence of a financial transaction tax is determined not by 
where the trade takes place but by the “tax residence of the financial institution 
or trader.” Residents, or owners of instruments issued in a tax jurisdiction, are 
being taxed, not the trading venues. With regard to the European Union finan-
cial transaction tax, the Commission states that a financial transaction would be 
taxed where an EU resident is involved—even if the transaction is carried out 
outside the EU.55 In the past, some financial institutions would try to confuse the 
identity of the trading entity through devices like shell companies. However, as 
already discussed, in today’s world where there is comprehensive reporting, 
disclosure of beneficial ownership and, with over 70 countries have signed up  
to cooperate on tax matters, this is becoming increasingly difficult, costly, 
and risky.
53See ISDA, www2.isda.org/.
54As we go to press, an even-more-ambitious ISDA clause is being discussed. Under 
pressure from the Financial Stability Board, the ISDA is considering including automatic 
standby clauses in derivative contracts when a bank is in trouble to stop a self-feeding 
panic about counterparty risk. Where there is a will, there is a way.
55See European Commission, “Common Rules for a Financial Transaction Tax—Frequently 
Asked Questions,” last modified September 28, 2011, http://europa.eu/rapid/
press-release_MEMO-11-640_en.htm.

Chapter 12 | Financial Transaction Taxes

Bankers have been making new threats. The claim is that they will move their 
derivative trading operations from those European countries that are con-
sidering a financial transaction tax to London subsidiaries where there is no 
transaction tax. On scrutiny, the impracticality of such a move makes it less 
menacing. If the trade is being conducted on behalf of a resident of a tax juris-
diction, then the tax would still be payable according to the residence prin-
ciple just described. And where banks are transacting on their own account, 
they are required to put aside capital that absorbs losses and protects against 
the riskiness of their exposures. Pre-GFC, this capital could be easily shifted 
between locations and therefore trades could be distributed across jurisdic-
tions to minimize tax. Following Lehman’s collapse, capital is now ring-fenced 
within countries making this practice more costly. Increased capital adequacy 
and margin requirements on derivative transactions established for tax avoid-
ance would offset the saving of a 0.01 percent tax on the face value of deriva-
tives or a 0.1 percent on its economic value.
A Tax on Consumers?
Commentators argue that ultimately it is the customers who pay this tax. 
This is the case in a highly competitive market where firms are on the edge of 
breaking even. No one can characterize the banking industry in these terms. 
Leaving aside the periods of banking crashes, its returns to capital and labor 
are superior to other industries, so it is possible that part of this tax will be 
financed through lower profits. The top thousand banks in the world reported 
collective profits of £540 billion in 2008 before collapsing in 2009 and then 
rebounding to £267 billion. To preserve market share, banks may well decide 
to swallow a proportion of a tax that represents, in a good year, less than  
10 percent of profits. 
But what about the portion paid by consumers? Crucially, not all consumers 
of financial products will pay equally. The financial transaction tax is an indirect 
tax on companies and a direct tax on investors churning56 portfolios. In the 
UK and elsewhere, the first issuance of a company’s shares is exempt from the 
tax. The amount of the tax paid by investors relates to the degree to which 
they churn, or turn over, their investments in the secondary markets. A pen-
sion fund that buys a stock and holds it for three years will have an annual 
average tax rate of 0.06 percent of assets under management (0.1 percent 
x 2 for purchase and sale ÷ 3 years). This is a tiny fraction of other annual 
56Churning is the frequent turning over of an investment portfolio and, as is often associated 
with tax avoidance, the speculation on short-term events, awarding trading commissions 
and more. The average pension fund completely turns over its portfolio once every two 
years. Some high-frequency traders turn over their portfolios many times a week or even 
within a day.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
197
transactions costs that equity mutual funds report are in excess of 1.0 percent 
per year.57 A hedge fund that turns over its entire portfolio once every three 
months would have an average annual rate of 0.8 per cent or 12 times more. 
Given that regulatory agencies generally only allow hedge funds to market to 
high-net-worth individuals, this tax will be progressive with hedge fund profits 
tapped far more than future pensions. 
Tax Rates 
As with any tax, the rate and taxable base are vexed questions. The incen-
tive to avoid or evade a tax is proportional to its size. Pitch a tax too high 
and it could be at a point of diminishing returns. The key test of propor-
tionality to prevent tax avoidance is to consider the tax in relation to all 
other transaction costs. Total transaction costs include considerably more 
than the simple bid-ask spreads that the industry is fond of focusing on to the 
exclusion of other transaction costs. “Revealed preference” suggests that the  
0.5 percent tax rate in the UK and the concentration of rates in other coun-
tries around 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent have not been a material impediment 
to the growth of major stock exchanges or economies. The rate of 0.1 per-
cent for cash transactions or the economic value of derivative transactions in 
the proposed European Union financial transaction tax or the proposed 0.03 
percent rate in the US58 are likely to be well below the rate of diminishing 
returns and a good place to start.
The challenge is how to set tax rates on derivatives. All derivatives have a 
premium, which is the cash consideration paid for the contract. However, by 
overlaying different options, it is possible to have a derivative with a potentially 
large payout but no upfront premium. Corporate treasurers are easily seduced 
by these low-premium or even “zero-cost” options. But, as we have discussed 
in previous chapters free lunches are rare and reducing the premium is often 
only achieved by increasing the likelihood of an expensive payout.
There are several techniques we can use to determine the right tax rate 
for derivatives. The tax can be levied on the fixed or maximum size of the 
potential payout—the notional value of the option. This has the merit of being 
simple and transparent making it the preferred approach of the European 
Commission. In order to minimise the distortionary impact of any tax, it is 
57See Roger Edelen, Richard Evans, and Gregory Kadlec, “Shedding Light on ‘Invisible’ 
Costs: Trading Costs and Mutual Fund Performance,” Financial Analysts Journal 69 (2013), 
pp. 33–44 and John C. Bogle, “The Arithmetic of ‘All-In’ Investment Expenses,” Financial 
Analysts Journal 70 (February 2014).

best to make it proportional to the economic value of the activity. Yet the 
economic value of an option relates to the likelihood of it being “struck” as 
well as its value if struck. Consider two financial options—one that pays out 
$100 million if there is a tsunami tomorrow and the other paying $100 million 
if a tsunami hits at any time over the next ten years. Both will have the same 
notional value of “$100 million” but their economic value will vary. Since the 
second option is more likely to be struck, it is more valuable and should incur 
a higher tax take than the former. To do otherwise would put low probabil-
ity options at a disadvantage. Yet, low probability catastrophe insurance, for 
example, is socially useful. The potential payout is large but the probability of 
any payout is small. Consequently, the tax may be better set as a levy on both 
the premium paid and the end cash settlement as suggested in US proposals. 
A further advantage is that it can then be levied at the same rate as for all 
other securities—0.1 percent of the premium and 0.1 percent of the payout. 
Inconsistency of tax rates is a common enemy of compliance. It is also easier 
to achieve tax compliance when taxes are being paid out of an existing cash 
flow as opposed to future revenue.
Revealed preference presents a respectable alternative route. Aligning the 
notional values of derivatives to economic value of derivatives has previously 
been addressed by clearinghouses that clear derivative contracts and need to 
find a way of charging for doing so. Relative to the push back from the industry 
over the financial transaction tax, there has been little resistance to the call for 
mandatory clearing and the imposition of clearinghouse fees. It is estimated 
that given these new requirements, clearinghouse revenues from fees charged 
on clearing OTC derivatives) will rise above $10 billion.59 Since the economic 
and market impact of every euro of a clearing house fee on a derivative must 
be the same as the impact of every euro of a transaction tax, the current level 
of clearinghouse fees appear well below the level of diminishing returns for a 
tax rate on derivative contracts. At a minimum, the authorities could start by 
charging a transaction tax at the same rate as clearinghouse fees.
Today clearinghouse fees average at around 0.002 percent of the notional 
amount of all cleared derivatives, or 0.05 percent of the gross market value.60 
These fees vary by product to reflect the different economic value of each 
instrument and the risks attached to clearing them. For instance, the fee rises 
if a product is an over-the-counter option versus a listed derivative; is bespoke 
or vanilla; is complex; has low trading volumes; or is settled by physical deliv-
ery rather than cash. These are useful factors to consider and helpful to the

wider project of financial stability if the tax creates an added incentive for sim-
pler products that pose less systemic risk. While including these factors may 
seem to be adding unnecessary complexity, under the European Parliament 
and Council’s Regulation on OTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties, and 
Trade Repositories (EMIR), all clearinghouses must publicly disclose the prices 
and fees associated with clearing services. It would be quite manageable and 
transparent as well as helpful to systemic risk management to simply link the 
starting tax rates to the current menu of clearinghouse fees. They can be 
reviewed periodically to ascertain their impact and reflect how clearinghouse 
fees have themselves changed over the period.
Coverage
The European Commission proposes to exempt government bonds from the 
standard 0.1 percent tax on cash transactions. The economic argument for 
this exemption is unclear. Private borrowers will view this as distorting the 
playing field in favor of government borrowers. If corporate bonds are to 
be taxed, then surely government bonds should be as well. But governments 
all over the world want to make their funding instruments more attractive 
than others so this may be a step that comes later. Beforehand policy makers 
should consider extending the tax to all credit derivatives—whether derived 
from corporate bonds or tax-exempt government bonds. The unhindered 
churning of credit derivative paper and the explosion of gross credit expo-
sures were sources of systemic risk in the last financial crisis and an avenue for 
the muddying of the true picture of government debt that caused difficulties 
for some sovereigns later. 
American depository receipts (ADRs), global depository receipts (GDRs), and 
nominee accounts are an avenue for nonresidents to avoid paying the financial 
transaction tax on shares originally issued in a financial transaction tax juris-
diction. Like a nominee account, in the case of an ADR, a tranche of shares 
of a French company, for example, is put into a depositary bank in the United 
States. ADRs are then issued by the depository bank against the shares they 
hold, and the ADRs are listed on, perhaps, the New York Stock Exchange in 
US dollars. The same arrangement in the UK is referred to as GDRs. A French 
resident cannot avoid paying a French transaction tax by buying the ADR of 
a French company listed in New York, because they are liable for tax on any 
instrument they trade irrespective of venue or instrument by virtue of their 
French residence and would have to declare the transaction and pay the tax 
in their annual tax return. However, Americans trading the French share using 
the New York listing of ADRs would avoid a tax they would otherwise have 
paid if they purchased elsewhere by virtue of the share being issued in France.

Chapter 12 | Financial Transaction Taxes

There are a couple ways to limit this. Shares in depositary banks held for the 
purpose of backing ADRs, GDRs,  or any nominee account programs, could 
face a higher tax rate when they enter into the program and this would be 
observable at the share registry. This is the case with the UK stamp duty. 
Alternatively, legal title to the shares held in the ADR program could be sub-
ject to an annual fee based on the frequency of turnover. This essentially 
causes the bank managing the ADR program to pass on the transaction tax.  
Conclusion 
Contrary to the banking lobby opposition, small financial transaction taxes 
are feasible and desirable. At least 30 countries already collect approximately 
$38 billion in taxes through stamp duties on share transactions that are in the 
range of 0.25–0.50 percent of the value of a transaction. New rules on report-
ing, anti-money laundering, disclosure of beneficial owners, and automatic tax 
information exchanges, make extending these stamp duties to derivative and 
other instruments easier to implement and harder to avoid.
Without intervention, the financial system disproportionately favors short-
term trading. Short-term trading adds to liquidity when financial markets do 
not need it and takes liquidity away when financial markets are in most need. 
There is a trade-off. In the past, too much emphasis has been placed on liquid-
ity in the good times at the expense of liquidity during periods of stress. 
Financial systems with a preponderance of short-term trading are more prone 
to economically and socially expensive boom-bust cycles. Financial transaction 
taxes are Pigouvian taxes that serve to limit these negative externalities and 
do so in proportion to the size of the externality, with long-term investors 
paying the least and high-frequency traders paying the most.
Financial transaction taxes also raise revenues. These revenues may not be 
as large as some hope but they are large enough to be significant to national 
budgets. The proportion of taxes raised from the financial sector currently 
appears disproportionately low given the sector’s exemption from value 
added taxes and the degree of state underwriting of the sector. In the US, a 
small transaction tax is already levied that pays for the cost of the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. In Europe, the proposed bail out funds as well as 
other public initiatives could be financed by revenues from the transaction tax, 
doubling up on its contribution to financial resilience. Resilient markets also 
attract more sustainable levels of investment.

The Shape 
of Financial 
Regulation
Its Institutions and Their Organization
In almost every country where the last financial crisis cut deep, there has 
been a major reorganization of the institutions of regulation. Perhaps the most 
dramatic changes so far have occurred in the UK. The UK’s unitary, separate 
Financial Services Authority (FSA), created as recently as 2001, was abolished 
in 2013. It was replaced with a new regulatory structure consisting of the 
Financial Policy Committee and the Prudential Regulation Authority at the 
Bank of England as well as a separate agency, the Financial Conduct Authority. 
Similarly dramatic changes are envisaged in the US, though the new arrange-
ment is still evolving. In Europe, as I write, significant changes are being envis-
aged for a new European Banking Union.
My instinct is that these reorganizations are akin to rearranging the deck 
chairs on the Titanic. None of the varied institutional arrangements at the 
time fared well against the iceberg of a massive boom-bust cycle. Moreover, 
the most elegant structures can obscure the primary objectives at the level of 
the financial system as a whole—one of the central themes of this book. It is 
understandable that in the depth of a financial crisis, with the public braying for 
13

Chapter 13 | The Shape of Financial Regulation

blood, issues become personified. Politicians are attracted to, and distracted  
by, the “who” questions of regulation—often at the expense of  “what” is being 
regulated and “how” it is being done.1
While it is possible to discern clear successes and failures of financial regulation  
by country, they do not neatly divide by institutional organization. By virtue 
of escaping the worst outcomes of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), the 
Canadian structure of a single regulator has been much lauded. In its case, the 
Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, or OFSI, is separate from 
the country’s central bank, the Bank of Canada. For some, it has become the 
model of choice. Yet it is strikingly similar to the previous UK design that had 
been a spectacular failure. While no institutional structure existing at the time 
in crisis countries fared well, there are failings that are clearly rooted in insti-
tutional construction and it is possible to conceive of better arrangements. 
This is particularly important for emerging economies that have out-grown 
their existing institutional order and are looking for guidance from the expe-
rience abroad. At a minimum, given the amount of time, debate, and energy 
spent on getting the shape of financial regulation right, it is important to have 
a view on this popular topic.2
It is in the spirit of this book that we take a blank piece of paper and ask, if 
starting again, how we would design a system that addresses the problems 
that need to be solved without creating many new problems. Current regula-
tion often seems alien to such an approach because it has evolved over a long 
stretch of time and has been molded by crises and the politics surrounding 
them. There has been little time for policy makers to dwell on what should 
be. Historical precedent cannot be easily dismissed either. Ordinary citizens 
buying stocks in private companies—some of the most volatile and uncertain 
of financial instruments—in a direct and unhindered manner runs counter to 
the spirit of much modern financial regulation. Indeed, the regulatory capital 
adequacy requirement of banking, insurance and pension fund institutions that 
hold equity assets is so substantial3 that they are being pushed out of the asset 
class that ordinary investors can freely buy and hold. But it would be unpopu-
lar, to put it mildly, if regulators retreated from this centuries-long practice and 
stopped retail investors from buying stocks so freely.
1The reader will recall my exposition in Chapters 3 and 4 of the “Bad apple theory of 
financial crashes” that is attractive to those in power at the time of a crisis.
2The world over, issues of institutional structure are always interesting at a human level, as 
they are about jobs and power.
3We discuss this in detail in Chapter 6.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
203
There are four important “who” and “where” questions to be addressed in 
this chapter. The initial issue is the vexed question of whether to have a single 
regulator or different regulators for distinct activities. Regulatory institutions 
have historically been split between bank and nonbank regulators. Securities 
regulation and insurance supervision, for instance, have often been separated 
from banking supervision, which is usually within the domain of the central 
bank.4 This is most stark in the United States, where there are a few federal reg-
ulators of banking activity— principally the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller 
of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Insurance 
companies by contrast are regulated separately in each and every one of the 
50 states, the District of Columbia, and the five US territories that they oper-
ate in.5 Foreign insurance companies complain that the US regulatory struc-
ture is a barrier to competition from international insurance companies. Some 
would argue that is its raison d’être. Structure is as political as everything else 
regarding regulation.
The next and related question concerns where the perimeter of regulation 
lies: which companies are regulated, which are excluded, and why the lines 
are demarcated as they are. A subsequent issue that follows from this is what 
should be done about so-called shadow banks. These are institutions that are 
not traditional deposit takers nor regulated as banks but appear to be carrying 
out savings and investment activities that are strikingly similar to those done in 
banking. Money market funds are an example of such activities, but the perimeter 
of shadow banks is itself blurry.6 A further issue is how to position the rela-
tionship among the financial regulator, the central bank, and the Treasury or 
Ministry of Finance. Some financial regulators sit on their own. Other times 
they operate within central banks, and at times within Ministries of Finance. 
Often they appear to act as if they sit in each of these places simultaneously, 
or in none of them.7 I believe the “whom” and “where” questions previously 
outlined follow naturally from gaining clarity on “what” financial regulation is 
trying to achieve, and I shall briefly address this question in the next section 
to set our bearings straight.
4This is often the case but not always. In the case of Trinidad & Tobago, for instance, and 
a number of other emerging economies, the central bank is responsible for insurance as 
well as bank regulation.
5States’ rights have a strong historical and emotional resonance in the United States. In 
1945, the US Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which reserved for the states 
the power to regulate and tax the business of insurance.
6In the United States, there is a live debate as to whether large asset-management 
companies are shadow banks and should be required to have bank-like levels of capital.
7I suspect that the regulator that is perceived as treading on the edge of everyone else’s 
turf is doing a more diligent, if less popular job than the one that is seen to be entirely 
self-contained.

Chapter 13 | The Shape of Financial Regulation
204
What Are the Institutions of Regulation Trying 
to Achieve?
In Chapter 2, I argued that there are two primary objectives of financial regu-
lation, namely consumer protection and reduction of systemic risk. Other 
objectives of financial regulation, such as maintaining market integrity, market 
confidence, appropriate incentives, or levels of transparency, can be placed 
under the umbrella of these two primary tasks. The main objectives are 
related but also separate, and the approaches required to achieve them are 
quite different. In broad terms, consumer protection is a bottom-up exercise, 
focused on protecting individuals. Its instruments are primarily a set of rules, 
rights, and guidelines, often resolving conflicts of interest and surrounding 
disclosures, as well as managing the reasonable expectations of retail buyers 
of financial products. It is an area rich with rights and wrongs backed by prec-
edents and laws.
A classic example of consumers needing greater protection was the UK pen-
sion mis-selling scandal in the 1980s. Margaret Thatcher’s tax-cutting admin-
istration made the decision to shift a greater amount of pension provision to 
the private sector. This was incentivized by a rebate of national insurance con-
tributions to those purchasing private pensions and by ample private incen-
tives to the sellers. In the later scandal it was alleged that almost a quarter 
of the two million people who bought personal pensions (no doubt driven 
by commission-driven salespeople) left perfectly adequate pension schemes 
provided by their jobs. Of these buyers, some 90 percent were most likely 
unaware of the high but opaque costs of transferring out of their occupational 
scheme and that they would be, bizzarely, forfeiting their employer’s contribu-
tion to their fund.
Following this sandal and similar ones elsewhere, consumers that were 
affected received compensation, the firms involved were penalized and dis-
closure requirements expanded. Limits on fees and costs were also imposed 
and rules regarding how sellers are remunerated were tightened.8 Despite the 
huge number of consumers  from the scandal in the UK, and the loss of public 
trust in financial intermediaries, there was no discernible systemic risk to the 
financial system, no stress on the payments system, and no run on financial 
institutions.9
8This discussion of the pension mis-selling scandal leans heavily on Chapter 4 in my earlier 
book with John Plender, All You Need to Know About Ethics and Finance: Finding a Moral Compass 
in Business Today (Avinash Persaud and John Plender, London: Longtail, 2007, pp. 54–55).
9A modest case could be made that the loss of trust in financial intermediaries reinforced 
the popular wisdom in the UK that the best investment is real estate. It can be carried 
out with tax incentives and leverage and without the management of intermediaries. 
This persuasion may have played a role in propelling the 1988–89 housing boom and 
subsequent bust. History would suggest, however, that no special accelerants are needed 
to fuel regular boom and busts in London’s property markets.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
205
Reducing systemic risk is a different exercise requiring a top-down approach 
focused on reducing concentrations of activity and connectivity. It is done 
through a series of incentives, often surrounding the amount of capital to be 
put aside for a certain activity. In Chapter 5 we discussed a typical macro-
prudential policy of raising the regulatory capital adequacy requirements for 
bank lending in a boom. These increased requirements can be on every loan 
or only those in the sector experiencing the boom. Another macroprudential 
policy is to lower the maximum loan-to-value ratios that banks can lend on a 
property without having to set aside greater capital. The issues addressed by 
a systemic regulator are macroeconomic or macrofinancial by nature and are 
shrouded in doubts and uncertainties. The tools are not rules of what is and 
isn’t permissible. Rather they are a set of incentives and disincentives that seek 
to tilt behavior. Riskier assets or times are addressed by higher capital charges 
that reduce the profitability of lending. Bans would be rare.
Incidentally, the exercise of setting macroprudential rules will have the effect 
of sometimes restricting access to finance, which is one of the reasons why, 
prior to a financial crisis, macroprudential tools were sorely unpopular. It may 
seem odd to us today but one reason why the authorities were slow to clamp 
down on the American boom in subprime lending was that back then it was 
seen partly as a way in which the previously unbanked were being banked. It 
was a measure of the success of capitalism in providing an opportunity for 
all.10 Who were regulators to stop that democratization of capital? This is an 
important riposte to those who believe, a little self-righteously, that financial 
crises are caused by the criminal few and by locking them up all our ills will be 
cured. There is no denying that there are people who did wrong and that the 
law should ensure that they are never allowed to do so again (see Chapter 
11). However, it is worth reiterating the message of Chapter 3 that the booms 
that beget the busts are able to persist and swell because of the complicity of 
the many rather than the wrongdoing of a few.
In addition to posing a potential conflict, the skill sets and institutional and 
professional cultures needed are not the same for both of the primary objec-
tives of regulators. What is required to enforce the legal protection of con-
sumers, on the one hand, and to develop or adjust incentives that reduce the 
buildup of excessive concentrations and connections, on the other, is quite 
10In Fault Lines:  How Hidden Fractures Still Threaten the World Economy (Princeton, NJ: Princeton 
University Press, 2010), Raghuram Rajan makes the point that the political bargain reached 
in the United States, where wide access to finance was a substitute to progressive taxation 
and a stronger social safety net, was one of the causes of the subprime crisis.

Chapter 13 | The Shape of Financial Regulation
206
different. Although we are talking about issues of  “professional culture”—that 
is, approaches and conventions rather than national culture and tastes—it still 
falls within the ambit of culture, which is something many economists would 
prefer to ignore.11
A critical contribution to the failure of the UK’s old regime of putting con-
sumer and systemic protection together was cultural. Bogged down by a wide 
mandate, the FSA became overly focused on enforcing legal minimums and 
this became the dominant professional culture. Insufficient attention was given 
to the culturally different task of trying to analyze where financial risks were 
being concentrated, transferred, or warehoused.12
Consequently, I believe it is judicious to have the two separate objectives of 
financial regulation addressed by two separate expert agencies. Each agency 
would have a clear mandate, effective powers, and useful instruments. There 
should also be provision for the agencies to reach agreement and compromise 
in those areas where there is a conflict concerning the effects of their instru-
ments. We will return to this later.
Unitary or Separate-Sector Regulators?
The history of regulation over the centuries started with self-regulation by 
practitioners at specialist companies.13 Diversity of form and organization 
across different specialties of finance, like banking, insurance, and asset man-
agement, was therefore a defining feature of the boundaries of financial firms 
and their supervision. When these firms failed to protect both consumers 
and the financial system, many existing self-regulatory agencies evolved into 
statutory regulatory bodies partially government run, and then solely govern-
ment run, always maintaining their preestablished specialties. Bank regulators 
were separate from insurance regulators, which were separate from securities 
regulators. If we had a clean slate and could start over, this is not where we 
would begin for at least three reasons.
11There exists a deep and old literature on the role of professional conventions and culture 
in economics, but it is a minority sport that today is mainly and most enthusiastically 
enjoyed in Paris. For further insights, see: (1) Olivier Favereau and Emmanuel Lazega, 
eds., Conventions and Structures in Economic Organization: Markets, Networks and Hierarchies 
(Cheltenham, UK: Edward Elgar, 2002); and (2) J. C. Sharman and David Marsh, “Policy 
Diffusion and Policy Transfer,” Policy Studies 30 ( June 2009), pp. 269–89.

University Press, 2009).

Reinventing Financial Regulation
207
In the modern age, the structure outlined invites institutions to cross the 
regulatory divide in search of an arbitrage. This behavior is commonly illus-
trated by analyzing the actions of AIG, a large general insurance company. 
AIG’s Financial Products Division originated credit default instruments. While 
this was effectively the same as selling insurance, because AIG appeared to 
the insurance regulator to be doing investment, in the form of trading mar-
ketable and highly rated securities, it was able to hold less reserves than if 
it had underwritten the same insurance in its insurance division, or if it had 
been a bank making the loans underlying these derivative instruments. When 
defaults arose, the losses in the Financial Products Division pulled down the 
entire company. Because these instruments underpinned several transactions 
across the industry, the possibility of a systemic collapse was raised were the 
company not “bailed out” by the Federal Reserve. AIG was duly offered a 
secured credit facility of $85 billion—the largest bailout of a private company 
in American history.
In similar vein to concerns about regulatory arbitrage, in terms of consumer 
protection it makes sense that this protection is consistent and even-handed 
across all financial products. Often banking products have insurance features, 
and insurance products exhibit investment features.14 If financial protection 
is inconsistent across financial products, because of enforcement by separate 
consumer-protection agencies for every part of the finance industry, an identi-
cal financial activity may be underprotected when sold by one institution but 
not another. It would be impractical, of course, to put consumer protection 
across all financial sectors under one roof if the underlying protection issue is 
different for different financial products, but essentially it is the same.
At a minimum, we must ensure that those unfamiliar with finance are given 
sufficient information to make the decisions that are in their best interests. It 
would be lamentable to have a situation where inadequate disclosures, infor-
mation, explanation, or lack of reasonable understanding causes the average 
person to misinterpret a decision as in their best interests when the benefit 
really accrues to a commission-earning agent or distributor.
It is important to note that regulatory arbitrage is often driven by differ-
ential tax treatment. For tax purposes banking and insurance products are 
treated differently creating an incentive for the insurance industry to produce 
insurance products that are primarily savings products that carry a lighter tax 
14In part to avail themselves of the advantageous tax treatment of insurance policies 
versus traditional savings products, a number of insurance products have a “with profits” 
or investment component. This requires that they periodically share investment returns 
with customers who pay a greater premium than they might do if the product was solely 
insurance.

Chapter 13 | The Shape of Financial Regulation
208
burden since they are dressed up as insurance products. A single consumer 
protection agency may be better able to look through differential tax treat-
ment to assess the underlying consumer protection issues than different con-
sumer protection regulators in each sector.
In the wreckage postcrisis, losers always complain that they could not have 
known better. The old adage of “caveat emptor” or “buyer beware” looks 
woefully inadequate. This invariably pushes regulators to go one step further 
to protect consumers and impose a duty of care on distributors of finan-
cial products. Such a duty of care ensures that consumers do not purchase 
instruments inappropriate to their needs and that they have a reasonable 
understanding of the risks involved. I argued in Chapter 7 that the way con-
sumers’ needs are assessed and the notion of asking them to identify their 
risk appetite does not provide them with adequate protection. A better idea, 
discussed in Chapter 7, is to require the seller of a financial product to assess 
the risk capacity of the purchaser. I merely want to reiterate here that it is 
both practical and desirable to have a single agency to ensure that the com-
mon underlying concerns of consumer protection are consistent and even 
across all financial products.
As discussed in both Chapters 2 and 7, protecting consumers of financial 
products is a specialized activity. Unlike buying a shirt, consumers tend to 
purchase only a few financial products in a lifetime, such as a mortgage, pen-
sion, life insurance, and a car loan. These decisions are potentially life chang-
ing if they go bad. Often they only go sour long after the seller has moved 
on and going bad has as much to do with the circumstances of the buyer as 
with the product. Given all of these reasons, I believe there should be a single 
consumer protection agency separate from the systemic regulator. It could be 
either a stand-alone body or a specialized department within a wider body 
concerned with consumer protection issues in general.
Should There Be One Systemic Regulator?
The systemic risk regulator should be a single regulator acting across the 
entire financial sector rather than being limited to certain types of banking 
risks or having responsibilities divided among bank, insurance or other regu-
lators. I argued in Chapter 5 that the management of systemic risk in part 
requires incentivizing risks to flow to the place with the greatest capacity for 
holding such risks. That might, for instance, require incentivising liquidity risks 
to flow from banks with short-term deposits and therefore limited capacity 
for liquidity risk, to life insurers and pension funds, with multi-year liabilities 

Reinventing Financial Regulation
209
and therefore a greater capacity to hold liquidity risks. The credit risks from 
these institutions could flow to banks that, by virtue of originating a wide 
amount of credit risks, can better diversify this risk.
Ensuring risk transfers that create systemic resilience rather than systemic 
fragility is nearly impossible for regulators sitting in industry silos, each with 
their own particular regulations, divergent risk definitions, and varying objec-
tives. Of course, as the last crisis demonstrated, a single regulator, entrusted 
with guardianship over the whole financial system, can also fail. The system 
cannot be herded in the right direction if the destination is unknown. A single 
regulator operated in the UK but lacked a framework of where risks should 
be. Risk transfers were allowed to travel in a perverse direction with illiquid 
banks storing up illiquid risks and shedding credit risks to insurers who were 
insufficiently capitalized (or diversified) to take on those risks.
It is disturbing that post-GFC, governments have shown a tendency to 
address systemic risk issues by appointing the good and politically connected 
to “systemic risk committees.” Such committees are then asked to assess 
systemic risks and employ macroprudential tools based on their assessment. 
Throughout this book we have noted that financial crises and systemic risks 
arise as a result of the financial system doubling up on those activities per-
ceived to be low risk and not those perceived to be highly risky. There is always 
a convincing story about why this time is different. Narratives abound about 
why, for instance, financial innovation has allowed risks to be better spread 
out than before. Other stories might argue why house prices in London, Sao 
Paulo, or Mumbai must always rise because supply is constrained by planners 
and demand emanates from an ever-increasing global elite.
Most people—including almost all those appointed to these committees—
were caught up in these widespread views.15 Committees of the great and 
good cannot easily act as guardian angels against financial crises. This is an 
area where we need less discretion than previously exercised and a stricter 
adherence to a rule-based approach. Systemic risk regulators must specifically 
consider placing a drag on above-average growth in the quantity or concen-
tration of risks that could be accumulated. They must also identify in whose 
hands risks are being held and assess the extent to which adequate incentives 
exist for a systemically resilient risk transfer across sectors. All this is vital 
for the creation of a financial system resilient against financial institutions that 
underestimate risks.
15This is to be expected. Those likely to spot that the cozy consensus is wrong may be 
viewed as too independently minded for collective decision making. Perhaps the majority 
who got it wrong do not wish to be regularly reminded of their miscalculation by the sight 
of those who did not. They might believe their job impossible if they must constantly defer 
to colleagues who got it right in the past for a variety of reasons, including sheer good luck.

Chapter 13 | The Shape of Financial Regulation
210
In Chapters 5 and 6 the approach discussed gave a single regulator the power 
to require all financial firms across every industry sector to set aside capital 
whenever a mismatch arose between the quantity of a certain risk and a firm’s 
capacity for holding that risk. The risk could be liquidity, credit, or market 
based. The capacity for holding risk could be by virtue of its funding or liabili-
ties. A bank could reduce its capital requirement and boost its profitability by, 
for instance, selling liquidity risks to pension funds and life insurers and buying 
credit risk from them. This would only happen smoothly if insurers and pen-
sions funds faced the same incentives managed by a single agency.
A systemic risk regulator could exist as a stand-alone agency or attached to 
the central bank. The argument for attaching it to the central bank is persua-
sive. The central bank is the main purveyor of liquidity in times of stress and 
will be at the forefront of any crisis response. In an unfurling crisis, time is of 
the essence. Precious time could be lost trying to get the central bank to act if 
it had not been, from the onset, intimately involved in both the regulation and 
monitoring of the failing institution from a systemic perspective.
In pursuing its other objective of setting monetary policy, the central bank 
will constantly make assessments and observations, and gain insights on the 
macroeconomy and availability of finance. This data is highly relevant to mac-
rofinancial risk assessment. Occasionally there will be conflicts as well as com-
plementarities between monetary policy and the management of systemic 
risks. Systemic risks frequently build up in times of easy monetary policy and 
then erupt in times of tighter monetary policy. A single entity able to wield 
two policy levers—interest rate policy and macroprudential tools—is better 
placed to strike this complex balance between the needs of the macroecon-
omy and those of the financial system. At a minimum, it will not act coun-
terproductively because of miscommunication between two different sets of 
policy makers or a conflicting interpretation of the issues at hand.
A single systemic regulator managing institutions on the basis of their risk 
capacity—regardless of what they are called or what sector they claim to exist 
within—will capture the activities of shadow banks. When an institution is bor-
rowing from short-term money market funds to invest in long-term loans that 
are unlikely to be liquid in times of stress. The regulator could demand diversifi-
cation and capital to hedge this risk. However, the real challenge of considering 
how to regulate shadow banks is that while many appear to be doing banking, 
they are doing so with equity and not with retail cash deposits. This is sys-
temically far safer than banking. It is banking with no leverage. The regulatory 
question is whether their clients understand that their investments are equity, 
and not a cash deposit, and that they can lose everything. Arguably, as long as 
they are not using leverage from the banking system, the concern that shadow 
banks are a systemic danger is overstated. Where they are using leverage from 
the banking system, this can be regulated from the side of the banks doing the 
lending. Perhaps the real issue of shadow banks has been misdiagnosed as a 
systemic risk problem when it is really a consumer protection issue.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
211
When analyzing shadow banks and other “fringe” financial firms, a crucial chal-
lenge is deciding where the regulation boundary begins. Is it a regulated activ-
ity if you agree to lend your cousin $5,000 and ask him to repay it when he 
can? Surely not. But what if you have 50 cousins and decide to do the same for 
all of them? Several countries set 50 clients as a cutoff point above which an 
institution or activity must be regulated. Too low a number and regulators will 
be swamped with work of little impact while simultaneously making it tough 
to focus on activities that do impact the wider economy. Too high a number 
places consumers at risk. Fifty has been accepted as a reasonable cutoff point. 
Unfortunately, there is no scientific way of determining the correct number of 
clients or what the monetary threshold should be. It differs among countries 
depending on their level of financial development. The cutoff level used by a 
consumer protection agency should be far lower than that used by a systemic 
regulator given that the former is concerned with individual wrongs and the 
latter with systemic imbalance.
Finance consumers below the regulation cutoff are best protected through 
public education and advertising. Great faith is placed on “financial education”. 
However, I do not believe it offers much hope of success. In a world where 
highly paid, well educated, and accredited professional asset managers claimed 
not to understand the credit instruments they bought ahead of the last crash, 
what chance is there to teach ordinary folk how to better protect themselves? 
The only optimism arises from the anecdotal observation that ordinary people 
seem to have more commonsense than many professional asset managers.
Three Separate Pillars: Consumer Protection, 
Systemic Risk, and Financial Crime
Commentators often glibly complain that financial regulation prior to the GFC 
had been reduced to a box-ticking exercise. This is true, especially in the UK 
where some of the biggest mistakes were made. If we want that to change we 
need to ask why it developed in this way. During his chairmanship of the UK’s 
FSA, Sir Howard Davis successfully instituted substantial pay increases for 
supervisors. These were not, then, poorly paid supervisors left unrewarded or 
demotivated. Regulators and supervisors are also highly conscientious, intel-
ligent individuals who would not actively chose a box ticking exercise. I believe 
a key cause of regulation becoming a box-ticking exercise has been the prolif-
eration of the different types of risks that regulators are expected to manage. 
This includes the hugely expanded remit of anti–money laundering (AML) and 
anti–financing of terrorist activities (AFT). These activities require pervasive 
regulation rather than surgical strikes. Every single transaction in the banking 
system is potentially a suspect one.

Chapter 13 | The Shape of Financial Regulation
212
The pervasive regulation required of that AML and AFT activities lends itself 
to comprehensive processes that filter everything so as to seize that one-in-a-
thousand suspect transaction. Do you know your client? Is she the underlying 
client? Do you know the source of funds? Do you know the purpose of the 
transaction? Do you know whom the funds are going to? Is this transaction 
part of a series of transactions? Is there anything suspicious about this trans-
action? Regulating the financial aspect of criminal behavior is a fundamentally 
different process from regulating systemic risk or even ensuring consumer 
protection.16 Systemic risk supervision is about judging the balance of prob-
abilities and consciously weighing up which risks could be taken without much 
consequence and which cannot. Being good at AML or consumer protection 
has no bearing on functioning as an excellent systemic regulator. Moreover, 
once you have engaged the pervasive approach of AML, it dominates every-
thing, making it hard to stand back and observe the bigger picture.
Consequently, there should be a separate agency in charge of financial crime 
that is supported by reporting requirements and information sharing among 
regulators. The consumer protection and systemic risk institutions would then 
be left to pursue their respective tasks in a more focused and precise manner.
Conclusion
Institutional failure is often part of a crisis, and correcting the repetition of 
institutional mistakes may be the easiest part of crisis management. The evi-
dence suggests that it is not helpful to have consumer protection, financial 
crime, and systemic risk managed in a bundle together. They are different 
activities with specific needs and professional cultures. Putting the lawyers in 
charge of systemic risk or leaving the economists responsible for consumer 
protection seems a guarantee of chaos. Finance has been criticized for being 
insufficiently regulated in the past. A more accurate characterization is that 
financial regulation has been ineffective, poor and with a blurred focus on 
objectives. Part of the blame lies with the regulators trying to do too much.
16Perhaps more accurately, the ways AML and AFT regulation are currently carried out 
are different from looking for financial-system fragilities. The former is heavily focused on 
processes and right or wrong activities rather than a judgement of the balance of risks 
and probabilities. That said, it is not inevitable that AML and AFT regulation become 
overly process oriented. It may reflect politics more than technical factors. Process is also 
more open to manipulation by the most powerful. See further J. C. Sharman, “International 
Hierarchy and Contemporary Imperial Governance:  A Tale of Three Kingdoms,” European 
Journal of International Relations 19 ( June 2013), pp. 189–207.

Reinventing Financial Regulation

Regulating systemic risk or consumer protection by having single regulators 
across financial sectors rather than a separate regulator for each of banking, 
securities dealers, insurance firms or others would also be better than cur-
rent arrangements. Not only is arbitrage reduced, especially regarding levels of 
consumer protection, but risk transfers across sectors that support systemic 
resilience are better monitored and incentivized.
My proposal envisages three separate and distinct agencies—an agency for 
managing systemic risks, one for consumer protection, and another dealing 
with financial crime. Each would be responsible for their sphere of activity 
across the financial sector. They could be a stand-alone agencies, though I 
think attaching the systemic risk agency to the central bank is sensible. It may 
also be wise to connect the financial consumer protection agency to a body 
tasked with general consumer protection. The financial crime agency requires 
the support of other law enforcement agencies and as such should have the 
appropriate links. I recognize the importance of allowing discretion as to how 
each agency pursues its specific objective, but history suggests this should be 
constrained by focused, rule-based obligations.
Too much time, effort and money is wasted shuffling around the institutions 
of financial regulation. Few institutional structures have moderated boom-bust 
cycles in the past. But some institutional structures and cultures seem to have 
exacerbated the challenges. We should not expect to find a single institutional 
solution to financial regulation, but we should strive to avoid the worst fea-
tures of previous institutional arrangements.

The Locus of 
International 
Financial 
Regulation
Local or Global?
In November 2008, China, India, and Brazil moved from waiting in the corridor 
outside as world powers met to being invited inside.1 This broadening legiti-
macy of the world’s steering committee, from the G-7 to the G-20, is right 
and to be commended. It is not without difficulty. The shift in influence is to 
a group of countries that share little other than economic power. They have 
diverse experiences, challenges, cultural perspectives and starting points. This 
is particularly apparent in the field of financial regulation. Reflecting this, the 
developments in financial regulation across these countries since the Global

1The ideas behind this chapter were developed through conversations with Andrew Baker, 
Mark Blyth, John Eatwell, Louis Pauly, Charles Goodhart, Eric Helleiner, Len Seabrooke, 
Andrew Schrumm and Paola Subacchi. I first presented these ideas in my article, “The 
Locus of Financial Regulation: Home vs. Host,” International Affairs 86, no. 3 (May 2010),  
pp. 637–46.

Chapter 14 | The Locus of International Financial Regulation

Financial Crisis (GFC)—despite the triumphalist language of global regula-
tion—is increasingly local. The prospect of the new global being quite local 
has dismayed “internationalists.” It need not. This chapter challenges the tra-
ditional dichotomy of more global vs. more local. It argues that financial inter-
nationalism—greater cooperation by nations for the benefit of all—is better 
served by institutions that help to integrate diverse systems than by those 
that try to enforce the one-size-fits-all approach to countries as different as 
Austria and Zambia.
Champions of global regulation often portray the banks, or at least think of 
them, as being opposed to it. However, the big global banks were the ones to 
persuade regulators of the benefits of global rules. They argued that global 
rules, to be applied by a single home-country regulator across banks’ inter-
national operations, were necessary for a level playing field. They knew that 
the benefits of global regulation would largely accrue to them as opposed to 
smaller national banks. They could better afford expensive regulatory require-
ments and were able meet them by passing a proportionally small amount of 
capital between branches and subsidiaries in different countries. One of the 
downsides of this is that big banks then proved to be an avenue for world-
wide contagion during the crash. Local regulation may be a safer way to regu-
late a system of connected, national financial systems for a host of reasons 
we shall shortly discuss. That said it is likely that a shift back to “host” from 
“home” country regulation will also act as a drag on international capital 
flows.2 Economists consider that a bad thing, but it may be less bad than more 
frequent international financial crises.
National regulation by the host country, as opposed to global regulation by 
home country regulators, does not preclude a role for international institu-
tions such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB). Rather, it suggests a more 
nuanced role. It potentially encompasses the policing of international market 
infrastructure, financial protectionism, information free-flow between regula-
tors, the convergence of regulatory principles and a consolidation of regula-
tory instruments. Experience has taught me that an informed and collegiate 
process of integrating different financial systems will produce a more resilient 
system than one that tries to enforce a single rule book across inherently dis-
similar countries.
2The “home country regulator” is the term used to describe the regulator in the country 
in which the bank is headquartered. Home country regulation would see this regulator, 
supervising a banks’ global operations in accordance with a global rule book. The “host 
country regulator” is the term used to describe the regulator in the country in which the 
bank is operating. A bank operating in seven different countries will have seven different 
host country regulators. Each may have a different approach to regulation and requirement 
for parental support of its foreign subsidiaries.

From G-7 to G-20 and the FSB
New global-governance arrangements were forged in the white heat of the 
GFC. Following the G-20 leaders’ conference in November 2008 and April 
2009 and the creation of its mirror image in regulation, the FSB, the locus of 
international economic governance, appeared to have slipped naturally from 
G-7 to G-20.3 A narrow assessment of the origins and displacement of the 
crisis would not automatically have suggested such a development. The brunt 
of the financial part of the financial crisis was confined to the United States 
and Europe, that is, the core of G-7 rather than the expanded G-20. India and 
China felt the after-shock of the GFC, but their banking systems were largely 
untouched and their economies quick to recover. Meanwhile the G-7 recover-
ies failed to respond to massive fiscal injections until three or four years later.
The conspiracy yarn holds that the crisis was too big for the “old” powers 
to afford. They needed the “new” powers to “bail” them out either through 
imports or financing. Buying that bailout by distributing seats at the summit 
of global powers was the solution and locking America’s creditors into it’s 
recovery plan made a less painful recovery possible for America.4 This is in 
contrast to the “cock-up” theory that suggests President Bush was unaware 
that the G-20 was a group of central bank and finance officials when he asked 
G-20 political leaders to meet him in Washington in November 2008.5 Human 
evolution was driven by random mutations so maybe in the evolution of inter-
national governance we can accommodate an element of arbitrariness.
3Arguably, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) had a stronger line of ancestry than the G20. 
Its forerunner, the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), established in 1999 in the aftermath of 
the 1997-1998 Asian Financial Crisis, was made up of finance ministries, central bankers 
and international financial bodies. The FSF, though tasked with monitoring the international 
financial system, was focused on the spread of codes and standards and acted as a forum 
for disseminating information on developments in international financial flows. The Basle 
Committee remained the preserve of financial regulation. However, around the same time 
as the creation of the FSF, the Basle Committee membership had widened beyond the 
original G10 industrial country central banks to include the larger emerging markets. 
At a meeting of the FSF in Rome on March 28-29, 2008, in preparation for the April 
12, G7 meeting, the FSF proposed a number of ideas to strengthen surveillance of the 
international financial system that paved its evolution into the FSB.
4An agreement to redistribute voting shares was agreed, but never passed by the US 
Congress, contributing perhaps to the recent proliferation of international economic 
institutions led by China (e.g. the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, AIIB) 
or narrow groups of emerging market countries (e.g. the New Development Bank, NDB).
5The first G-20 meeting took place in Washington, DC, on November 14–15, 2008. The 
second meeting took place on April 2, 2009, in London. In 2009 and 2010, the countries 
met twice a year, and subsequently once a year. The current schedule is for annual meetings 
every November.

Although many iissues emerged from the tangled web of the GFC that 
demanded an international response, the geography of these issues did not 
coincide with the G-20 countries.6 The logic of the G-20 requires a perspec-
tive beyond the financial crisis. There was the earlier food crisis, the energy 
crises, and the specter of substantial global imbalances between the United 
States and commodity producers and manufacturers such as Germany, China, 
Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil. Of this group of countries with the surpluses 
that could ease the adjustment, only Germany was a member of the G-7. Its 
surpluses were mainly within the EU and were (wrongly) considered to be 
lacking in wider significance.7
Whatever the actual reasoning, G-20 leaders met in November 2008. They 
signed up to common commitments and communiqués and repeated the 
refrain that global problems necessitated global responses. Later they estab-
lished the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to oversee new global rules on finan-
cial regulation.8 Unquestionably the numbers and words of global governance 
have been transformed. But is this a change of substance and for the better? 
Is financial regulation under the 60-member FSB going to be markedly differ-
ent than the more exclusive Basel Committee of the 1990s? Regulators from 
the bigger emerging-market economies already had greater influence at the 
expanded Basel Committee prior to the FSB’s establishment. The real changes 
afoot in global organization of regulation need to be ascertained and assessed 
to determine if they will lead to better or worse outcomes.
Stretching the span of global governance from its north westerly corner is 
every internationalist’s dream but in financial regulation the process has quickly 
hit an unexpected hurdle. G-7 was narrowly homogenous; G-20 is wildly het-
erogeneous. Global leaders now cover a more diverse group of countries, 
economies, financial systems and cultures with broader perspectives. The 
instinct of G-7 leaders was that a single regulatory prayer book is possible. 
What was right for them was right for everyone. G-20 leaders such as India, 
Brazil, and Russia do not share this uniformity. Agreeing a common approach to 
regulation, much less a common set of rules will be challenging—especially given 
the politicization of national and international financial regulation.

Folly, (New Jersey, USA: Princeton University Press, 2011).
7The euro zone credit crisis of 2010–11 had as one of its root causes large current account 
imbalances within the Euro zone between Germany, the main surplus country, and major 
deficit countries including Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain and Ireland.
8At the April 2009 meeting, issues other than global issues were assigned to different 
institutions. Tax transparency was sent to the OECD and the multilateral development 
banks were entrusted to support a “green” recovery.

Moreover, national electorates are less willing to accept a process determined 
beyond their borders. On any given day, a finance minister at an international 
forum is likely to preach that finance is a global industry in need of global regu-
lation. Back home the local press will hear the same minister militate against 
any foreign entity muscling in on the regulation of their banks. For most G-20 
leaders, the new global approach they queued up to sign was not about being 
one of twenty voices developing a single set of rules. The unspoken, under-
lying hope was for global recognition and acceptance of their own sensible, 
domestic regulation. The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 
Act (Dodd-Frank) of 2010, the UK Financial Services (Banking Reform) Act 
2013 or the provisions on banker’s pay in the 2014 Fourth European Capital 
Requirements Directive9 make no concession to the needs of India, Brazil, and 
Russia. To even suggest that the pilots of these initiatives ought to take these 
expanded viewpoints into consideration would raise eyebrows and prompt 
smirks. Across a wide set of issues such as financial regulation, bankers’ pay, 
bank taxes and competition policy, national regulators are taking different 
paths from their international colleagues. These differences, while appearing 
subtle and nuanced are often quite fundamental.
Different Perspectives
In the United States, faith in the goodness and wisdom of free markets remains 
powerful. The prevailing view among policy makers and academics is that the 
real problem was institutional. Banks had become too big to fail. Had they 
been smaller, failure would not have necessitated huge taxpayer bailouts. In 
the words of the mid-Atlantic Governor of the Bank of England, Professor 
Mervyn King, if  “a bank is too big to fail, it is too big.10” Too big to fail, or TBTF 
as it has become known in the United States, is at the core of Dodd-Frank 
and other post-crisis US policy initiatives. The thinking is that banks grew 
too big because they were able to convince regulators that big is beauti-
ful.11 In response, the recent focus of bipartisan regulatory initiatives from the 
US Congress has been to curb the size of financial institutions, curtail their 
activities, and improve winding-up rules.12 Large banks (and insurance com-
panies)—the so-called 30-odd Globally Systemically Important Institutions

percent of a banker’s annual salary or 200 percent with shareholder approval.

saying this.

(G-SIFIs)—face additional capital-adequacy requirements in the order of an 
extra 2 percent of risk-weighted assets. The oft-mentioned “Volcker rule,” 
named after the report chaired by former Chairman of the Federal Reserve 
Paul Volcker,13 is a much distilled, modern, version of the Glass-Steagall Act 
that tries to re-assign riskier trading activities away from deposit and loan-
issuance institutions.14 In Chapter 9 we discussed other proposals to ban 
derivative instruments not traded on exchanges or not centrally cleared or 
settled. In a pro-market vein, US policy makers want to be make market 
institutions more robust. They have not come to bury the previous system, 
with its emphasis on the judgment of markets, but rather to save it.
Ironically, as a ratio of bank assets to home-country tax revenues, the truly 
big banks are in Europe, not the United States. The assets of Bank of America, 
the largest US bank, represent 50 percent of national tax revenues. The assets 
of UBS or Fortis are many times home-country tax revenues. The assets of 
Barclays, not even the UK’s largest bank, are well over 200 percent of UK tax 
revenues. In Europe, the belief in market solutions, always a tad fragile, has 
been dealt a body blow. The prevailing view is that there should be tighter, 
more centralized rule-based regulation and a focus on correcting market fail-
ures with its tendency to boom and bust.15
The notion of countercyclical capital charges has its greatest proponents in 
Europe’s universities and Finance Ministries. Ironically they most often cite a 
long serving, US Fed Chairman from another era, William Martin, who said 
that the central banker’s job was to take “away the punch bowl when the party 
is getting good.”16 At the heart of the notion of countercyclical capital charges 
is that crashes happen because the markets have got it wrong.17 Similarly, 
Europe is concerned about banning market speculation regarding economi-

cally sensitive products such as commodities and banning the short selling of 
bank stocks and government bonds. The European approach at its most gentle 
is to reform the market and at its most brutal is to switch off the market in 
certain areas. It is no surprise that this perspective has given birth to pressure 
for an EU-wide financial transactions tax18—a proposal we discuss in Chapter 
12 and of which boom-era American regulators would have dismissed as self-
evidently wrong.
Asia is a more diverse region. If there is a prevailing postcrisis conscensus, 
it is that too much tinkering with existing regulation would be a mistake. 
Many jurisdictions had only recently introduced Basel II before the GFC. 
Consequently, this region lays blame for the crisis squarely with lax US and 
European supervision and less with faulty regulation.
It would be erroneous to suggest that these fundamentally different regional 
perspectives do not also have some important points of convergence.19 There 
is widespread agreement among the world’s regulators that leverage, the ratio 
of a bank’s loans to its own capital, was too high. Remember that one of the 
few banking regimes not to collapse was the Canadian system where a lever-
age ratio was comprehensively applied. A cap in the leverage ratio of assets to 
capital of between 20 and 30 times now enjoys global consensus. Initiatives to 
strengthen market plumbing such as centralized clearing and settlement also 
have cross-regional support.20
But divergences persist. Given the size of its banks, Europe will remain reluc-
tant to take on the US emphasis on too big to fail. America will resist adop-
tion of countercyclical capital charges, as this would be a case of regulators 
second-guessing the market. The “Asians” will, for their part, be resistant to 
changes to Basel II after the painstaking process of adopting the previous rules.

Chapter 14 | The Locus of International Financial Regulation
222
A New Internationalism
Many of these regional differences occur behind the scenes in the arcane world 
of technical advisors and regulators. Some differences have also surfaced in 
the politically charged area of bankers’ pay and competition policy. Despite a 
stronger convergence of belief, principle, and intention than exists elsewhere, 
US, British, and continental European politicians still decided to go their own 
way in creating limits to bankers’ pay and bonuses.21 Pay and competition may 
seem to be marginal issues compared to the importance attached by some 
to an international agreement on minimum capital adequacy. Yet as we argue 
in Chapters 9 and 11, these micro incentives are critical influences on macro 
behavior.  All of this is indicative of an increasingly national approach to regula-
tion. The surface veneer is of global agreement and action but beneath there 
is a palpable shift toward more nationally derived decisions. This is reflected 
in the important debate over whether the lead regulator of an international 
bank should be its “home” or “host” country regulator in each jurisdiction.
In the pre-crisis years, the locus of regulation had shifted to the home-country 
regulator following global rules. More national decision-making would arrest 
this ten-year trend and herald a return to the host-country regulator being in 
the driving seat and following national rules. This scenario causes “internation-
alists” dismay. However, it is time we see this issue through prisms other than 
traditional ones of level playing fields, banks arbitraging local regulators or a 
race to the bottom in standards. In the sections that follow, we also look at 
the role of regulatory capture in the prominence of home-country regulation. 
It is my contention that a better goal of internationalism would be to foster 
institutions that help with the integration of diversity rather than impose an 
inappropriate one-size-fits-all solution.
Home vs. Host: Why Home?
When the concept of home-country regulation is raised, the usual initial 
response from both bankers and regulators is along the lines that banking is 
global, so banking regulation must be global. But this is poetry not prose. Many 
industries with systemically important supply chains like food, copper and oil 
are global but they are not globally regulated.
When the mantra of global banking needs global regulation is unpacked, one 
of the arguments employed is that the alternative would be a backward step, 
one that forced banks to “subsidiarize”, that is, to set up separately in each 
country with separate capital and assets. This we are told would reduce capital  
flows. Capital-short countries will starve and capital-rich ones will overheat. 
21See Chapter 10.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
223
Investment will be constrained by national savings. It is also suggested, in 
modest contradiction to the viewpoint above, that it will lead to regulatory 
arbitrage. Capital would begin flowing to those jurisdictions with permissive 
regulations and away from those with tighter rules. Some fear the national 
route will “Balkanize” banking supervision with no one assessing the overall 
risk of a bank. Further, host-country regulations are often perceived as excus-
ing financial protectionism. Countries clinging to host-country regulation such 
as China, India and Russia tend to have limited local penetration by interna-
tional banks. Some have even whispered that it is in everyone’s interest to 
have J. P. Morgan’s activities in a small, developing country regulated by sophis-
ticated and knowing (sic) New York regulators rather than where regulatory 
capacity is more limited.
The Experience of Home-Country Regulation
There are several examples where the local banking system is dominated by 
international banks whose behavior is primarily regulated by the headquarters 
country rather than the host. Baltic and Eastern European banking is largely 
regulated by foreign regulators in Sweden, Austria and Switzerland. Australian 
regulators are the lead regulator for institutions dominating New Zealand’s 
banking system as well as that of some Pacific Island states. Canadian regula-
tors play a similar role for banks that dominate the sector in parts of the 
Caribbean.
At first glance, the arguments in favor of home over host-country regula-
tion are persuasive. They certainly succeeded in persuading regulators prior 
to the GFC. Back then countries like India were considered outdated out-
liers for their resistance to home-country regulation. However, the recent 
crisis shed a new light on the workings of home-country regulation. Having 
a common minimum capital-adequacy requirement across countries at dif-
ferent stages of the boom or bust cycle creates perverse pressure on capital 
flows. In boom countries, capital-adequacy levels are low relative to the appar-
ent profit opportunities. Increasing lending appears more profitable when it 
should appear more risky. For countries in recession, a common international 
capital-adequacy requirement makes lending unprofitable relative to other 
countries. There is less lending even though it is likely to be safer in the long 
run because valuations of bank collateral are depressed or undervalued. Most 
lending mistakes are made in the boom. Single and fixed capital-adequacy 
requirements are procyclical.22

Who is best placed to recognize and respond when excessive lending is chas-
ing a boom—home or host country regulators? I would argue it is the host 
country regulator. Assume Swiss banks are financing a property bubble in 
Hungary. Is it better for the Swiss or the Hungarian regulator to ascertain 
what the right amount of aggregate lending should be in Hungary? Bear in 
mind that the size of lending to Hungary by our archetypical Swiss bank may 
be important to Hungary but less so for the Swiss bank.
Different regulations across countries or regions could create the conditions 
for regulatory arbitrage but this is not really a home-host issue. It is actually 
about de facto control and enforcement. If all lending and borrowing activ-
ity within the country is done by nationally regulated entities, then exces-
sive lending or borrowing will be controlled by the local regulator, It does 
not matter if this is driven by regulatory arbitrage, profit, or opportunities. 
Could regulators really stop cross-border lending and borrowing? Bankers 
and home-country regulators portray an image that finance is immune from 
the laws of gravity and all else and cite the GFC as evidence. In reality much 
of the problem with bank behaviour prior to the GFC was that regulations 
were followed to the letter rather than the spirit of the law. We know today 
that local legislation can be potent. For example, US regulators have been 
able to impose heavy fines on international banks headquartered outside the 
US borders when they tried to circumvent US sanctions using branches in 
non-US jurisdictions.23 However, if any activities took place outside nation-
ally regulated entities, contracts could be made unenforceable. In our ear-
lier example, however potentially lucrative, no Swiss lender would assist a 
Hungarian borrower if the borrower could set aside her obligations at will 
through Hungarian courts.
One of the unintended consequences of home-country regulation is what 
might be termed “regulatory arbitrage” by regulators. When Lehman Brothers 
was on the verge of going bust, the US-based investment bank, watched over 
by its home-country regulator, pulled its capital back home. This left its foreign 
branches and subsidiaries considerably short of capital. Host regulators in the 
UK responded with calls for the national ring-fencing of capital and assets. 
There are mechanisms to achieve this, including international bank branches 
becoming nationally regulated subsidiaries. Regulatory approved “living wills” 
can also be imposed which dictate what happens to capital in the case of a 
terminally ill institution.24
23In 2014, US regulators forced France’s largest bank to fire 13 employees and pay a fine of 
$9 billion for allegedly violating US sanctions against Sudan, Iran and Cuba, using a complex 
international network of payments. In 2012, UK-based HSBC and Standard Chartered 
banks were fined $1.9 billion and $674 million, respectively, for hiding transactions with 
countries the US has sanctions against.

Far from being concerned about foreign overreach undermining a home bank, 
it appears that national regulators acted as global champions for the institu-
tions in their jurisdictions as a whole. Iceland is frequently cited in this regard 
and with good reason. But the most enthusiastic champion must be the UK. 
UK regulators practiced “light touch” application of global rules and shouted 
it from the rooftops hoping to attract more overseas business. London’s role 
as one of the world’s preeminent financial centers owes much to its ability to 
lure businesses away from other centers with the prospect of lighter regula-
tion or taxation and often both. Examples include the migration from New 
York to London of international bond trading in the 1970s and hedge funds 
in the 1990s.
When the GFC erupted, many commentators concluded that international 
finance was “unfettered.” While significant gaps existed, the paradox is that 
finance was heavily regulated and a significant experiment in global regula-
tion. It was not the quantity of regulation that was lacking but its nature and 
organization. Home-country organization failed. The return to greater host-
country regulation is the lesson of the GFC for while “banks may be global in 
life[,] they are national in death.”25 The bailouts have cost taxpayers billions 
nationally and trillions globally. Perhaps an even-bigger cost is that domestic 
policy, social agendas and welfare narratives have been completely derailed. 
Public deficits have risen to unprecedented levels and public debt levels have 
doubled. Given they bear the cost, national taxpayers do not want regulation 
in foreign hands. As long as the bailouts are national, they will insist regulation 
is similarly national.
Regulatory Capture
Given the logic of host-country regulation the question is why did regulators 
move to home-country regulation. The benefits to big banks are clear. Setting 
up local subsidiaries with locally ring-fenced capital and assets is consider-
ably more expensive and inefficient than having a single regulator with single 
reporting, accounting and capital adequacy rules. The single regulator would 
be able to move capital around the branches to wherever it is most needed. 
Large international banks campaigned for home-country regulation and, within 
the context of liberalization and globalization, were able to persuade Basel 
25Mervyn King reportedly made this comment in 2008 after the collapse of Iceland’s 
Lansbanki in October 2008.

regulators of its merits.26 It was those same countries utilizing home-country 
regulation that were largely responsible for the spread of trouble during the 
early phase of the GFC. India, Brazil, Russia, and other emerging markets, with 
their largely host-country regulation, continuously criticized, and viewed as 
backward, were largely untouched by the first waves of financial contagion.
It might seem logical that host-country regulation, with different capital-ade-
quacy regimes and ring-fenced capital, would lead to a sharp curtailment of 
global capital flows. The height of globalization and global capital flows coin-
cided with the lowering of regulatory borders and the aspiration of level play-
ing fields. It would be natural to assume that cross-border capital flows would 
decline in response to a rise in these regulatory boundaries. However, one 
of the essential problems in international finance is that international capital 
flows only seem to come in two speeds: too fast or too slow. Neither is good. 
Host-country regulation may conceivably lead to more moderate and sustain-
able flows.
Additionally, the Chinese and Indian “economic growth model,” appears to 
be a successful one for economic growth.27 Their trade barriers have fallen 
more rapidly than capital barriers, and their capital flows are not primarily 
international banking flows, but FDI or private equity. Economists are far less 
certain of the benefits of the free movement of capital than they are of the 
free movement of goods and services.28 
This may be a big country narrative. A drying up of international liquidity 
will present significant challenges for smaller countries less able to rely on 
local savings. Smaller countries could well make different choices than India, 
China or other large states. They may want more rapid convergence of their 
regulatory regime with others to promote greater bilateral capital and bank-
ing flows. Hong Kong has benefitted from being a financial satellite orbiting 
China. Mauritius plays a similar role for India and Singapore acts as a financial 
satellite of both giants. Luxembourg is Europe’s financial satelite. Small, open 
economies will make different choices on exchange rate and trade regimes 
from large economies. It would not be surprising if they also make different 
choices regarding capital regimes.
26Before the GFC, regulators were dismissive of concerns over regulatory capture. I 
recall more than a few of them responding in the strongest terms against an “op-ed” 
I had written for the Financial Times in October 2002 arguing that Basel II was difficult 
to comprehend without considering regulatory capture by large banks. See “Banks Put 
Themselves at Risk in Basel,” October 17, 2002, Financial Times, reprinted at the end 
of this book. For further analysis of regulatory capture, see Andrew Baker, “Restraining 
Regulatory Capture? Anglo-America, Crisis Politics and Trajectories of Change in Global 
Financial Governance,” International Affairs 86, no. 3 (May 2010), 647–63.

The New Internationalism and the FSB
Adopting host-country regulation does not signify an end to global coopera-
tion and coordination. Varying levels of intensity of global coordination are 
possible across diverse areas. The FSB can play a number of critical roles, 
many of which are easier than the task the original Basel Committee of bank 
supervisors and regulators set themselves. What follows are four such roles 
of increasing intensity.29
	1.	 Facilitating the free flow of information to support the national 
monitoring of internationally systemic developments and 
assisting regulators everywhere to observe dangerous inter-
national trends between seemingly innocuous national activi-
ties. In this regard, the FSB would be acting more like a 
broader International Organization of Security Regulators 
(IOSCO), than the Basel Committee of Bank Supervisors.
	2.	 Policing financial protectionism through peer review. The FSB, 
with its broader legitimacy, could facilitate peer review 
of host-country regulation to ensure that national regu-
lation does not discriminate against financial institutions 
based on national origin as opposed to activity. This func-
tion could be a specialised version of the work of the 
WTO. Macroprudential rules could be used to limit sys-
temically dangerous lending as opposed to discriminatory 
capital controls. 
	3.	 Regulating the infrastructure of markets whose reach goes 
beyond national boundaries, such as those in commodity, for-
eign exchange and derivatives. The London Metal Exchange 
(LME) and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) are exam-
ples of markets regulated domestically but are global in 
scale. Wherever domestic consumer protection or local 
systemic risk is not the major concern, it is sensible that 
domestic regulators yield the regulation (and regulatory 
costs) of these markets to the FSB. This could include the 
regulation of global benchmarks like LIBOR, credit ratings 
and other non-bank institutions critical to the functioning 
of global markets such as centralized clearing and settle-
ment houses. Because these institutions can be located 
29For a more in-depth study of alternative roles, see Eric Helleiner, “What Role for the 
New Kid in Town? The Financial Stability Board and International Standards,” (draft 
memo prepared for the workshop New Foundations for Global Governance, Princeton 
University, January 8–9, 2010).

Chapter 14 | The Locus of International Financial Regulation
228
anywhere physically there is a temptation to locate them 
where regulation is lightest.30 Even when this is not the 
case, having global markets regulated locally creates a 
social externality, as local regulators are incentivized to 
underinvest in global stability if that investment is being 
made in national “tax dollars.”
	4.	 Promoting a convergence of principles and a consolidation of 
instruments that are controlled locally while fostering a trans-
parency and predictability in regulation that supports greater 
cross-border activity, entry and market competition. The risk 
of a return to host-country regulation is that regulation 
becomes a closed jungle of obtuse, local regulations where 
visibility is low and passage tough. In such an environment, 
international competition would be crimped and com-
parisons difficult. It need not be so. At one extreme, host-
country regulation could simply mean the adoption of a 
single set of rules with a common definition and national 
discretion on the value of key parameters. For example, 
countries could agree on what counts as capital but dif-
ferent countries might apply different, time-varying, levels 
of minimum capital requirements. They may also apply 
different data standards where it makes sense to do so. 
(Under Basel II, one of the data standards is seven years 
minimum of data on defaults. However, this data is both 
problematic to access and far less relevant in an emerging 
economy growing at 5–10 percent per year. There could 
be an agreement on how defaults are defined but differ-
ences on how far back the data must be in each country 
to be equally relevant.)
While these four functions for the FSB are significant, they preclude the kind 
of level playing field that international banks want.31 It is arguable that a version 
of host-country regulation with a common definition of a capital requirement, 
with countries pursuing different limits, is compatible with global regulation 
and common rulebooks. However, host-country regulators must feel suffi-
ciently empowered and responsible to exercise greater discretion than they 
do today. There is a strong tendency to converge to a single international 
norm or minimum. The cry of level playing fields tends to give these norms a 
life force of their own. Take for example, the 60 percent public-debt-to-GDP 
norm which is a rule lacking any real scientific basis. The norm is actually 
wholly inappropriate for many countries or times.

Europe as a Special Case
Within the European Union taxation is still largely a domestic power. At the 
same time, European politicians want to create a single financial space with a 
single regulator.32
The prospective European banking union is designed to reduce the likelihood 
of member states going bust from bailing out their financial systems.33 It does 
this by spreading the cost of a national bailout across all members of the 
union. This in turn demands that a common resolution authority and common 
funds be essential pillars of the banking union. The quid pro quo of sharing the 
banking crisis costs is greater centralization and standardization of banking 
regulation. Enter the European Central Bank, the single supervisor as per the 
home country model we previously discussed. My fear is that a single super-
visor, just as with home country regulators, will make it harder to quell the 
national credit booms that lead to banks going bust in the first place. Bigger 
booms with attendant bigger crashes, however evenly costs are shared, are a 
more existential threat to the euro area than the odd sovereign default.
Having the strongest finances in the euro area after the GFC, Germany has 
been, and is expected to continue being, the chief paymaster of the euro area’s 
new stabilization structures. For this we should all be grateful. Having paid the 
piper, Germany will call the tune. Today, Europe’s evolving regulatory struc-
tures reflect German views. Yet Germany’s perspective on the GFC is quite 
different from those who suffered the boom and bust. Germans believe they 
have prospered because they followed the rules while others did not—a view 
that conforms to their self-image.
My observations advising and speaking at gatherings of European and interna-
tional regulators make me conclude that the operational emphasis of the sin-
gle supervisor will be on strict enforcement of uniform rules across the euro 
zone. This is exactly how home-country regulators of international banks have 
worked. The new EU supervisor is likely to be charged with leveling out any 
unevenness to ensure that the banks it supervises are safe. This will make 
macroprudential regulation harder. National regulators, pressing for easier 
capital-adequacy rules for lending within their jurisdictions, would be viewed 
suspiciously. Are they trying to undermine the banking union by giving local 
banks an unfair advantage? And if national regulators seek to tighten lending 
criteria by, for example, implementing lower loan-to-value ratios to booming 
sectors, the affected sectors would complain. A sympathetic lone supervisor

Difference,” a guest article I wrote for the Economist, published on January 26, 2013.

European Commission, 2009).

Chapter 14 | The Locus of International Financial Regulation

might agree that this diversity was fragmenting the single market. The super-
visor and the banks would be united in the mantra of a single lending space 
underpinning the single currency area.
The underlying premise of this setup is wrong. Yes, rule breakers should be 
brought to book. It is also true that there were some spectacular supervisory 
failures in the boom-bust European countries. The list includes supervision of 
the UK’s Royal Bank of Scotland, Ireland’s Anglo Irish Bank, Belgium’s Fortis, 
and Spain’s Cajas. Even German supervisors were not blameless regarding the 
Düsseldorf-based IKB, an early victim of the crisis. More importantly, even if 
bank supervision had been uniform across the euro zone, the lending booms 
in Ireland, Spain and Belgium would still have taken place and the busts would 
still have followed. It might even have been worse.
Between 1997 and 2006, Irish house prices rose by 247 percent, while Spain 
and Belgium experienced house-price inflation of 173 percent and 96 percent 
respectively. Once the expectation had taken hold that property prices in 
these countries would rise by at least 10 percent every year, bank lending 
to the Spanish, Irish, and Belgian housing markets appeared to be a low-risk 
venture. Modest economic growth in Germany, France, and Italy kept euro 
zone inflation low and interest rates at 3 percent or less. This, added kindling 
to the lending fire. A euro zone banking union adhering to common lend-
ing rules would still have incentivized bank lending to flow to these markets 
because rising property values justified the increased borrowing. Remember 
that prior to the crash, banks in Spain, Ireland, Britain, and America appeared 
well capitalized based on boom-time asset valuations rather than off-balance-
sheet shenanigans.
The solution would have been for the authorities, observing their financial 
systems in this self-feeding credit frenzy, to impose tighter lending criteria on 
a country-by-country basis. Supervisors could have required banks set aside 
additional capital against their lending, specifically in the housing or construc-
tion sectors. Lending contracts that did not comply with these rules could 
have been made locally unenforceable. Of course, national supervisors failed 
in this task before. (Some tried during the GFC, notably the Bank of Spain.) 
Equipped with clearer mandates, greater independence, and a hell of a history 
to avoid repeating, they may do better in the future.
A single euro zone supervisor’s perspective on safety would be mono-dimen-
sional. Boom-bust cycles are more of a national than a euro-wide phenom-
enon because of greater national interconnectivity with housing markets, 
investment, consumption, employment and lending. What seems safe from 
the perspective of a bank operating across Europe might look dangerous 
through the lens of a national economy. Recall the example of mortgage lend-
ing denominated in Swiss francs by Swiss and Austrian banks in Hungary. This 
would be obviously dangerous for Hungary but was not considered danger-
ous for either Swiss or Austrian banks.

There Can Be Unity in Diversity 
Whenever Europe stumbles, a stark choice materializes crying out for either 
“More Europe” or “Abandon Europe.” The shortcomings of the single cur-
rency are seen as proof that it must be augmented by a single everything. Yet, 
in this case, the opposite actually makes better sense. In spite of the benefits a 
single interest rate brings, an acknowledged cost is the issue of managing dif-
fering credit conditions in member states. Differentiated regulatory policy—
tightening rules in booming regions and loosening them in others—addresses 
this failing and buttresses the single currency. A common regulatory policy, 
alongside a common interest rate, risks amplifying booms and busts which will 
ultimately undermine the single currency. Circumstances sometimes neces-
sitate saving Europe from the Europhiles.
Germany’s recent economic success has less to do with superior bank super-
vision and everything to do with selling superior engineering eastward and 
southward. What came back in the opposite direction was borrowing to help 
finance importation of these goods. It is a pity that the borrowing was not 
accompanied by any philosophy. In Eastern philosophy, systems such as nature 
or the human body are supposedly made stronger by dualities. Forces that 
appear in opposition are often actually complementary. Similarly, the resilience 
of the financial system also requires some diversity. European unity cannot 
be achieved by assuming away differences but by recognizing them. When it 
comes to regulating credit across Europe, we need high regulatory standards 
and sensitivity to different financial conditions rather than an insensitive appli-
cation of uniform lending rules.
Conclusion 
Broadening global governance to include the largest economies in the G-20 
has deepened the democratic legitimacy of the Gs. However, it has also cre-
ated a shift away from a group of countries with common experiences and 
problems toward a group with wildly disparate experiences, challenges, and 
starting points. In these muddied waters, the Gs previous course of adhering 
to globally agreed rules of single “home-country” regulators has run aground. 
Despite the global language of regulation, action is increasingly local. Dismayed 
internationalists had hoped the crisis would to lead to a strong set of com-
prehensive rules applied and enforced globally. They already view the GFC as 
a “missed opportunity.”

Chapter 14 | The Locus of International Financial Regulation
232
But the old dichotomy between global and local may be outmoded. Is “interna-
tionalism” about a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation, or is it about how 
we integrate diverse systems? Host-country regulation may prove safer as it 
allows greater responsiveness to national economic conditions and cycles.34 
It will also prove politically palatable when local taxpayers are called upon to 
finance a bailout.
Host-country regulation can include an important, if more subtle role for 
international regulatory institutions. Parts of the financial infrastructure, such 
as exchanges, central clearing and settlement institutions, are global not local. 
The FSB could play a key new role of global police for such truly interna-
tional markets. Host-country regulation is vulnerable to local institutions hid-
ing behind obtuse local regulations to avoid foreign competition. The FSB 
could facilitate and discuss peer review of member states local rules to reduce 
protectionism. Converging regulatory principles and consolidating regulatory 
instruments would increase the competitiveness of local markets and lower 
barriers to entry. At the extreme, countries could express their differences 
simply through different capital-adequacy requirements rather than using a 
complicated set of different regulatory instruments. The FSB should also be 
the central information node for financial sector developments both nation-
ally and internationally. Information sharing may not seem tremendously glam-
orous but the most frequently cited defense of regulators and bankers in 
every crisis to date has been a lack of knowledge. They all claim that they did 
not know what was going on. Better information and analysis will not stop 
financial crises but it will better arm those trying to do so.
The benefits of greater liberalization of capital flows were best extolled by 
the international banks who benefitted from the notion of a level playing field 
for themselves. It allowed them to hold small amounts of capital that they 
moved to whichever markets were most profitable. A shift back to host-
country regulation may prove a drag on international capital flows. The eco-
nomic repercussions of this have to be examined soberly, set alongside the 
consequences of highly contagious financial crashes and the relative safety of 
host-country regimes in the past. My instinct is that we are more certain—
rightly or wrongly—of the long-term economic benefits of openness in the 
trading of goods and services. The benefits of openness in financial markets 
are conditional, complex, and in places suspect and should therefore not be 
the altar upon which we sacrifice host country regulation of finance.

Financial System (New York: United Nations, March 2009).

An informed and collegiate process of integrating different financial systems 
will create a more resilient system than one made up of single rules being 
applied across many countries. In finance, systemic resilience requires a foun-
dation of heterogeneity.35 We have already discussed the systemic dangers of 
homogeneity in previous chapters.36 An international heterogeneity of finan-
cial systems will generate opportunities for capital flows and a richer set of 
examples and experiences to inform policy makers around the world. The 
new international order may be more local than many had hoped for. All 
things considered, that might make it better.

In the international financial arena, G-7 policy makers chant three things: 
more market-sensitive risk management, stronger prudential standards, and 
improved transparency.1 The message is that we do not need a new world 
order but that we can improve the workings of the existing one. While many 
believe this is an inadequate response to the financial crises of the last two 
decades, few argue against risk management, prudence, and transparency. 
Perhaps we should, especially with regards to market-sensitive risk manage-
ment and transparency. The underlying idea behind this holy trinity is that it 
better equips markets to reward good behaviour and penalise that which is

bad, across governments and market players. However, while the market is 
discerning in the long run, there is now compelling evidence that in the short 
run, market participants find it hard to distinguish between the good and the 
unsustainable; they herd; and contagion is common.
Critically, in a herding environment, tighter market-sensitive risk management 
systems and more transparency actually makes markets less stable and more 
prone to crisis. This perverse response may help to explain the growing insta-
bility of the financial system. Over the past ten years, the system has been in 
crisis in almost four. In response, the emphasis on market-sensitive risk man-
agement practices and transparency must be tempered, rather than extended 
vis-à-vis credit-ratings agencies and the risk management of investors. The 
incentives of regulators should be realigned to include the impact of herding 
behaviour on foreign markets as well as local institutions. Financial market 
institutions should be encouraged to set aside collateral for systemic risk 
or to buy liquidity options from central banks during good times. Countries 
should facilitate the inflow of capital from investors who herd least or leave 
slowly: foreign direct investors, equity portfolio investors, and, surprisingly, 
hedge funds.
A Cyclical Debate
The subject of debate in the reform of the international financial system fol-
lows a cycle. In the middle of each crisis—and there have been at least six 
since the debt crisis which started in Mexico in 1982—there are deafening 
demands for the whole-scale reform of the entire international financial sys-
tem. A few months on from the end of each crisis, those demands fade. There 
were clear-and-present parallels between calls made in previous crises and 
those made in the thick of the last crisis for the IMF to become a lender of 
last resort, injecting substantial liquidity in times of crisis, and for hedge funds 
to be regulated. Every crisis inspires plans for a new financial architecture, and 
as the crisis ends, most of these plans are tidied away.

Underlying this cycle of debate is that while the demand to make systemic 
changes is naturally strong in the middle of a crisis, the consensus on what is 
wrong and what to do is generally weak. Moreover, while recent crises have 
appeared sharper and more global than before, they have been shorter lived. 
Before a consensus on what to do to avoid crises can grow, they are over, and 
countries previously in crisis begin to enjoy economic rebound and the return 
of international capital flows. This was not the case during the Latin American 
Debt Crisis of the mid-1980s or after the EMS crisis in 1992–93, when eco-
nomic recovery was held back by a cheap dollar and European governments 
exerting fiscal restraint. But it was the case in the last two crises in Mexico 
and Asia (see Chart 1). We also live in an age where ambitions are limited. We 
no longer walk on the moon. In this environment, the view that often gains 
ground a few months after the crisis is that there are risks to meddling with 
a financial system that works most of the time and there are things that can 
be safely done to improve the workings of the market the rest of the time.
Chart 1. The rapid rebound in Asian GDP (Source: State Street Bank)
The proposals that emerge postcrisis, therefore, tend to focus on making it 
easier for the market to reward good behaviour and penalise that which is 
bad. The emphasis is not on changing the rules of the game but on strengthen-
ing the players; by putting in place stronger risk management, more prudential 
standards, and improved transparency. One of the key responses of the Interim 
Committee of the IMF to the latest crisis and the desire to avoid a next one 
was the adoption on 26 September 1999 of the new Code of Good Practices on 
Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies. Incidentally, these measures are 
all relatively inexpensive to implement. There is declining political support for 
large packages of taxpayers’ money to bail out foreign countries in trouble.

How More Market-Sensitive Risk Management  
Can Create Risk
While many believe that market-sensitive risk management, prudential stan-
dards, and transparency are probably not enough to avoid future crises, they 
believe these measures will probably help to provide the right discipline for 
governments and can surely do no harm. These measures are likely to be a 
positive force in the long run when markets are better at discerning between 
the good and bad. But in the short run, there is growing evidence that market 
participants find it hard to discern between the good and the unsustainable, 
as they often herd and contagion from one crisis to another is common. The 
problem is that in a world of “herding,” tighter market-sensitive risk manage-
ment regulations and improved transparency can, perversely, turn events from 
bad to worse, creating volatility, reducing diversification, and triggering conta-
gion. How can this happen?
Let us explore the interaction between herding, market-sensitive risk man-
agement, and transparency in bank lending. It is important to note that bank 
lending remains a powerful feature of modern-day crises. For example, the 
five Asian crisis countries—Thailand, Malaysia, South Korea, Indonesia, and the 
Philippines—received US$47.8 billion in foreign bank loans in 1996. In 1997, 
banks withdrew US$29.9 billion—a net turnaround of almost US$80 billion 
in one year. By contrast, equity portfolio flows remained positive throughout 
1997 (See State Street Bank and FDO Partners, “Portfolio Flow Indicator—
Technical Document,” 1999.)
The growing fashion in risk management, supported by the Basel Committee 
on Banking Supervision, is a move away from discretionary judgements about 
risk to more quantitative and market-sensitive approaches (for an early refer-
ence, see the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, Supervisory Treatment 
of Market Risks, Basel: Bank for International Settlements, 1993). This is well 
illustrated by how banks now tend to manage market risks by setting a limit 
on DEAR—daily earnings at risk. DEAR answers the question: How much 
can I lose with, say, a 1 percent probability over the next day? It is calculated 
by taking the bank’s portfolio of positions and estimating the future distri-
bution of daily returns based on past measures of market correlation and 
volatility. Both rising volatility and rising correlation will increase the potential 
loss of the portfolio, increasing DEAR. Falling volatility and correlation will do 
the opposite. Banks set a DEAR limit: the maximum dollar amount they are 
prepared to risk losing with a 1 percent probability. When DEAR exceeds 
the limit, the bank reduces exposure, often by switching into less volatile 
and less correlated assets such as US dollar cash. (See J.P.Morgan/Reuters, 
RiskMetrics—Technical Document, New York, 1996.)

By “herding behaviour,” I mean that banks or investors like to buy what oth-
ers are buying, sell what others are selling, and own what others own. There 
are three main explanations for why bankers and investors herd. First, in a 
world of uncertainty, the best way of exploiting the information of others is 
by copying what they are doing. Second, bankers and investors are often mea-
sured and rewarded by relative performance so it literally does not pay a risk-
averse player to stray too far from the pack. Third, investors and bankers are 
more likely to be sacked for being wrong and alone than being wrong and in 
company. (For further explanations of herding, see Robert J. Shiller, “Investor 
Behaviour in the October 1987 Stock Market Crash: Survey Evidence,” 
NBER Working Paper 2446, Cambridge, MA: National Bureau of Economic  
Research, 1990.)
Figure A-1.  Representation of VAR: histogram of portfolio values
Imagine that, over time, a herd of banks have acquired stocks in two risky 
assets that have few fundamental connections—say, Korean-property and 
UK-technology stocks. Imagine, too, that some bad news causes volatility in 
UK-technology stocks and the banks most heavily invested there find that their 
DEAR limits are hit. As these banks try to and reduce their DEAR by selling 
the same stocks (Korean property and UK technology) at the very same time, 
there are dramatic declines in prices and rises in volatility in both markets 
and in the correlation between Korean and UK markets. Rising ­volatility and 

Appendix A | Sending the Herd Off the Cliff Edge 
240
correlation triggers the DEAR limits of banks less heavily invested in these 
markets but invested in other markets. As they join the selling milieu, there is 
a rise in volatility, correlation, and contagion.
The key to this environment is that market participants behave strategically in 
relation to one another, but DEAR measures risk “statically”—without strate-
gic considerations. Previous volatility and correlations were measured over a 
period of time when the herd gradually built up and are therefore almost cer-
tain to underestimate the impact on prices, volatility, and correlations when 
many investors sell the same asset at the same time. This strategic behaviour 
can be modeled more formally using game theory. (Some attempts to do so 
can be found in Stephen Morris and Hyun Song Shin, “Risk Management with 
Interdependent Choice,” Oxford Review of Economic Policy 15, no. 3, Autumn 
1999, pp. 52–62.)

Stress Testing
It has been suggested that this contagion could be avoided by stress test-
ing—testing how a portfolio of positions perform under made-up scenarios. 
In practice it does not do so for two reasons. First, the most popular stress 
test is to see what would happen to a portfolio of positions if a past crisis was 
repeated. But this is not very meaningful. As we have observed, the spread 
and focus of crises relate to where positions are, and unless positions are 
identical—which is unlikely given the memory of the past crisis—the next 
crisis will be different from the past one. The best stress test is to assume 
that everybody has the same positions as you do and that you cannot get out 
of any of them without large losses. This test is seldom attempted. It is hard 
to estimate the spread and depth of positions or the impact on liquidity and 
hence potential losses. In this age of quant, risk managers mistakenly prefer to 
worry about quantifiable risks over unquantifiable ones. Even if the risks could 
be estimated, banks would treat the result with suspicion. It would be like tell-
ing a lending institution that when assessing risk, it should assume none of the 
loans are repaid and that the historical volatilities and correlation suggest it is 
a far-fetched scenario, though it is exactly the scenario that long-term capital, 
the failed hedge fund, and others found themselves in during September and 
October of 1998.
Several financial institutions suffered serious losses in 1998, but few of these 
losses were life threatening. An additional critical point is that even if stress 
testing worked to save banks from trouble, it may not be able to save a coun-
try. One of the interesting aspects of the Asian crisis was that while short-
term external debt exposures for Asian countries were large enough to 
“bring down” countries under the dynamic of herding we have looked at, the 
exposures were not big enough to bring down foreign banks. One of the key 
challenges is to realign the incentives of regulators to worry about the con-
centration of exposures in foreign countries as well as in local banks.
Let us add another dimension to our nightmare scenario. Further assume that 
a country has recently signed up to the Special Data Dissemination Standard 
(SDDS)—one of the lasting responses of the 1995 Tequila Crisis—and the 
1999 Code of Good Practice and as a result has started publishing its foreign 
exchange reserves daily. In this case, bankers and investors with more modest 
exposures would observe that as risks grow—with prices falling and volatility 
rising—other bankers and investors leave the country rapidly. In this height-
ened environment, they will view the country’s loss of reserves as doubly 
increasing the risk that they will be left wrong and alone. This will trigger a 
further rush for the exit.
The reason why this is a major challenge to the current regulatory framework 
is that herding is frequent and that even short-lived financial crises have real 
economic impact. While herding behaviour is hard to prove directly given the 

Appendix A | Sending the Herd Off the Cliff Edge 
242
paucity of reliable data on the positions of financial institutions, there is a now 
a growing body of evidence that markets behave as if market participants herd.
In the foreign-exchange markets, for example, if we define a crash as a 10 
percent fall in the real exchange rate over three months, there have been 78 
crashes across 72 countries since the European monetary system (EMS) cri-
sis began in September 1992. These are not distributed evenly over time or 
distributed with deteriorating fundamentals, but they cluster. Contagion is rife, 
with 70 percent of crashes occurring in just three years. This contagion does 
not move predictably along the lines of trade but along the lines of shared 
investors. The stepping stones of the most recent crisis, for example, were 
from Thailand and Indonesia, to Korea, on to Russia, and then on to Brazil. 
These countries share very little trade in common. Furthermore, crashes are 
invariably preceded by booms as the herd moves into place. Chart 2 shows 
bars indicating the number of foreign-exchange crashes per year across 72 
countries and a line indicating the annual cross-border portfolio flows into 
emerging markets. Note how investors rushed into emerging markets in 1995 
and 1996, prior to the crashes in 1997 and 1998.
Chart 2. “Crashes” and “booms” in the foreign exchange market (Source: State Street Bank)
Further evidence of herding and the problems of a static value-at-risk analysis 
can be found by looking at the distribution of daily market returns. In Chart 3, 
we imagine we are a risk manager in January 1997 looking at the distribution 
of daily returns of a portfolio of OECD currencies versus the dollar over the 
previous five years. The distribution is well behaved and fairly symmetrical—
though not around zero. According to this actual distribution, the manager 
would expect a more-than-1 percent daily decline in this portfolio’s value 
around 5 percent of the time. Three years later and if she survived, she would

currencies, 1992–96
have found that her portfolio fell by more than 1 percent in a day more than 
10 percent of the time and the distribution of returns looked very different 
(Chart 4). (It can be shown that the difference between these two distribu-
tions follows a beta distribution consistent with herding behaviour.)

currencies, 1997–99

Appendix A | Sending the Herd Off the Cliff Edge 
244
The predominance of herding behaviour and its lethal combination with the 
practice of DEAR limits may explain why the 1990s have been such a decade 
of financial dislocation; the financial system has been in crisis for 40 out of 
the 120 months, or 33 percent of the time. This instability has real economic 
impact. Although international portfolio flows have recovered from the dips in 
1998, they remain highly concentrated in just four markets: Hong Kong, Korea, 
Singapore, and Taiwan—hardly the most capital-needy countries either given 
their high domestic savings and big current account surpluses. Many other 
markets have found it hard to raise foreign capital.
These financial crises also have a direct impact on GDP. For example, while 
there has been a strong rebound in GDP in 1999 in Asia, in general and in 
South Korea, in particular, the rebound has not offset the loss of GDP during 
the crisis period. One way of estimating the lost GDP of the Asian crisis is 
to estimate where GDP would be today if Asian economies had continued 
the more modest but sustainable growth rates experienced in the five years 
before their current account deficits began to widen in 1993–94. Were it not 
for the crisis and its preceding boom, GDP would be an aggregate of $130 bil-
lion higher in South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Another measure 
of this lasting impact is the elevation of poverty levels in Asia today [in 2000] 
compared with 1997.
The paradox is that if one or two banks followed a DEAR limit and others 
did not, those banks would have an effective risk management system that at 
the margin would support the financial system. But if every bank were to fol-
low the same approach, given that these banks follow one another into and 
out of markets, the DEAR limit would contribute to systemic risk. It is ironic, 
therefore, that the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is supporting the 
rapid adoption of these systems across all banks and encouraging investors 
to follow suit (for an early reference, see Bank for International Settlements, 
“An Internal Model-Based Approach to Market Risk Capital Requirements,” 
Basel: BIS, 1995). There is a further paradox with transparency: The more 
herding investors and banks know about what each other is up to, the more 
unstable markets may become. In the long run, transparency and DEAR limits 
are a good development, but they are harmful in the short run in the context 
of herding behaviour.
What Should Policy Makers and Regulators Do?
Herding presents a classic example of the need for intervention. The indi-
vidual incentives of herding investors create systemic risks. Moreover, if regu-
lators were so coordinated that they behaved like one global regulator, they 
would be best placed to make an intervention. Through the privileged forma-
tion they have as a regulator of individual bank balance sheets, they know 

Reinventing Financial Regulation
245
when banks are herding. This requires a different focus. Today regulators are 
warned by other regulators when banks in their jurisdiction have exposures 
that threaten themselves, not whether banks around the world have expo-
sures which together threaten a foreign market and could become contagious.
However, if this information were made public, in the context of herding 
investors, random shocks could quickly evolve into financial crises. But how 
should regulators respond if they notice herding in a particular market? They 
should require the bank to put aside an extra amount of capital for “strate-
gic risk” without specifying which markets carry that risk. Applying tighter 
risk management requirements for those specific markets in which the herd 
has appeared will only make the stampede more vicious when negative news 
strikes. Collateral requirements are like a tax on banks and are very unpopu-
lar. However, banks could be given the choice of either putting up strategic 
collateral from time to time or buying liquidity options from the central bank 
during good times.
Whether these solutions would work or not, the whole concept of market-
sensitive risk management practices needs to be seriously reconsidered in the 
context of herding, and the authorities should rethink their extension to the 
use of credit-rating agencies and the risk management of long-term investors.
It is arguable that regulators have actually promoted herding through risk 
management systems. They may also have done so in their zeal for disclosure 
of bank positions and central bank reserves. Indeed, there is a role for one 
unregulated investor who is encouraged to buy near the bottom of markets 
through the absence of risk, capital disclosure, and credit concerns. Such inves-
tors would make the system safer but would be high risk and so should be 
restricted to those who can afford to lose. If this investor had to be invented, 
she would look something like a hedge fund. Interestingly, as the big-betting 
hedge funds have been undermined by the disclosure and credit policies of 
banks, market liquidity has fallen and volatility has risen. Just as the big macro-
hedge funds fade away, we may find that they supported the market as much 
as they exploited it.
Those of you unable to stomach regulators promoting hedge funds will be 
relieved to note that there are other kinds of flows that do not herd so much 
foreign direct investment, for example. Further, during the Mexican and Asian 
crises, equity portfolio flows also revealed less herding than bond flows. It 
would appear that bond investors are keen to get out before they are held in 
by a debt moratorium or orderly workout. This raises some interesting ques-
tions for those trying to build burden sharing and orderly workout provisions 
into bond constitutions.

Appendix A | Sending the Herd Off the Cliff Edge 
246
Transparency in data and governance is clearly a good thing in the long run 
and promotes the right behaviour of governments. Governments should be 
encouraged to disclose more information every month and quarter, but not 
on a daily basis. In an environment of herding investors, there is not a good 
case for insisting that countries release central-bank reserve data with such 
high frequency. It is telling that during the EMS crisis, many of the developed 
countries that have just adopted the Code of Good Practice on Transparency 
found it helpful to delay the monthly publication of their official reserves or 
to camouflage the information for several months. Small, vulnerable emerging 
markets will find it even more helpful not to publish their reserves every day 
or every week and should not be forced to do so.

Banks Put 
Themselves at 
Risk at Basel
The biggest problem for regulators is “capture”—a situation that happens 
when their activities are influenced excessively by those they are supposed 
to be regulating. In the case of banks, you can imagine how this happens.1 A 
bright, young regulator receives a call from a vice chairman of the bank he 
would quite like to work for later. The vice chairman explains that there are 
some complex issues at stake and to help clarify them he has asked an emi-
nent economist to write a report explaining why a regulatory proposal is eco-
nomically inefficient. The vice chairman adds that if the offending regulation is 
enacted, the bank will have to move its profitable operations to the British 
Virgin Islands, with the loss of hundreds of local jobs.
This is a crude caricature. The capture is always gentlemanly, sophisticated, and 
subtle. One way to prevent it would be to make it less appealing for bankers 
to employ regulators by imposing a long period of “quarantine” before a for-
mer regulator can join a bank. But there is still the issue of pay. The pay differ-
ential between the regulator and the regulated is one of the causes of capture.

I propose an instant and cost-free solution. Before a bank supervisor consid-
ers any regulation, he should ask what it would look like if he were captured, 
against the public good, by the largest banks. He should then circulate the 
“captured version” to as many people as possible. Knowing your adversary is 
one thing, but knowing his agenda is better still.
What would Basle II look like if the committee had been captured by the large 
banks? First, the regulation would be very complex. Complexity is the avenue 
of capture. The simpler things are, the more you can see what is going on.  
A five hundred-page rule book, for example, is an intimidating barrier to entry 
for nonbankers. Complexity also makes regulation less easy to enforce.
Second, we would expect the regulation to focus more on internal processes 
and less on outcomes. Big banks can more easily carry the cost of sophisti-
cated internal risk assessment than banks that are small, new, or operating in 
developing countries.
This is exactly what Basle II looks like. There is complexity where there 
should be simplicity. There is also a lower capital requirement (a subsidy) for 
those with sophisticated internal risk assessments, without much attention 
to whether these assessments work. Internal processes on their own do not 
keep banks away from bad lending. Indeed, if financial institutions use similar 
internal processes, it can lead to financial instability.
Today’s sophisticated internal risk assessments work via daily, price-sensitive 
risk limits. They require a bank to reduce exposure to risk when the probabil-
ity of losses increases as a result of falling or more volatile asset prices. When 
a handful of banks use these systems, everyone may be better off. But if every 
bank uses them, and they have similar positions, when falling prices cause one 
bank to hit its risk limit, other banks hit theirs, too. As many banks try to 
sell the same asset at the same time, prices plummet and volatility increases, 
­causing more banks to hit their risk limits.
As long as market participants herd, which they have been doing for as long as 
markets have existed, the spread of sophisticated risk systems based on the 
daily evolution of market prices will spread instability, not quell it.
Price-sensitive risk limits also add to herding. Financial crashes occur shortly 
after the point of greatest optimism, when prices are high and risks appear 
low. This is one of the reasons why the large banks, with their sophisticated 
internal risk systems, have been caught up in every market cycle. They lost 
considerable amounts during the dot-com bubble and on companies with 
crooked accounting. They may be about to do so again on their syndication of 
collaterised debt obligations—the next bubble to burst.

Reinventing Financial Regulation
249
As their price-sensitive risk limits have forced them to offload these bad 
investments at the same time, their actions have triggered cascading declines 
in equity prices, undermining their own positions and those of pension funds 
and insurance companies.
None of the big banks has failed—yet. But we do not know what would have 
happened if the implicit government guarantee had not been there. Even with 
that guarantee, the markets are uneasy about banks. Their bonds have been 
downgraded and their bondholders have suffered capital losses. It is odd that 
the proposed response is to reduce the regulatory capital required of these 
systemically important banks.
Basle II will amplify the credit cycle and add to instability—a particular hard-
ship for small companies and developing economies. Financial crashes occur 
because of a collective abandonment of common sense by the market. The 
history of finance, from the tulip mania of 1637 to the dot-com bubble, is full 
of such lapses. Only a captured regulator could conclude that an industry of 
such systemic importance, so prone to mutual self-delusion, is ready for more 
self-regulation.

About the Author
Avinash D. Persaud’s career spans finance, 
academia, and public policy. He is currently 
nonresident Senior Fellow at the Peterson 
Institute 
for 
International 
Economics 
in 
Washington, DC; Chairman of Intelligence 
Capital, a London-based financial consultancy; 
and Nonexecutive Chairman of Elara Capital, 
an emerging market investment firm based 
in Mumbai. He is also Emeritus Professor at 
Gresham College in London and Visiting Fellow 
at the Centre for Financial Analysis & Policy at 
the Cambridge Judge Business School.
Previously, he served as Managing Director 
at State Street Corporation, Global Head of 
Currency and Commodity Research at JPMorgan, Director of Fixed Income 
Research at UBS, Chairman of the Warwick Commission on Financial 
Reform, Chairman of the Regulatory Subcommittee of the UN High-Level 
Task Force on Financial Reform, Cochair of the OECD Emerging Markets 
Network, Member of the UK Government’s Audit and Risk Committee, 
Member of the Intergovernmental Task Force on Financial Taxes, Member of 
the Pew Task Force to the US Senate Banking Committee, 2010 President of 
the British Association for the Advancement of Science (Section F), Trustee 
of the Royal Economics Society, and Governor to the London School of 
Economics. In addition, he was Visiting Scholar at both the IMF and ECB and 
was a founding director of the over-100,000-strong Global Association of 
Risk Professionals. In 2000, he won the Jacques de Larosière Prize in Global 
Finance at the Institute of International Finance in Washington, DC, and was 
ranked as one of the top public intellectuals in the world on the financial 
crisis by an expert panel for Prospect Magazine. His analytical innovations, 
including the EMU Calculator, Risk Appetite Index and Event Risk Indicator, 
and ideas such as liquidity black holes theory and the Persaud Paradox of risk 
and safety led him to be one of the top analysts in global investor surveys for 
over a decade.

Acknowledgments
The ideas in this book reflect observations I have made from working in 
finance since 1988 and what I have learned from many teachers. The City 
of London is not known for the quality of its business managers, but I was 
lucky early on to have had wise managers who supported my curiosity—in 
particular, Chris Anthony,  Thorkild Juncker, Stephen Lewis, Jan Loeys, Malcolm 
Roberts and Stan Shelton. 
My ideas would not have developed backbone without the encouragement 
of a handful of academics. I benefitted from the teaching, collaboration, and 
friendship of John Eatwell, Charles Goodhart, Stephany Griffith-Jones, Richard 
Portes, Hyun Song Shin, John Williamson, and Charles Wyplosz. The reality, if 
not the study, of finance depends on human behavior and I have learned a lot 
of psychology from discussions with my brother, the consultant psychiatrist 
Dr. Rajendra Persaud—though as a result of these discussions he is now a far-
better economist than I am a psychologist. 
Although I have often been motivated by what I thought was wrong with 
financial policy, a number of policy makers have listened and encouraged me to 
go further—especially Charlie Bean, Mark Carney, Winston Dookeran, Mario 
Draghi, Tim Geithner, Aerdt Houben, Jean-Pierre Landau, Francesco Papadia, 
Dr. Y.V. Reddy, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Andrew Sheng, Adair Turner, Philip 
Turner, Marion Williams, DeLisle Worrell, and Brian Wynter. 
Many people have ideas swirling around in their head with few opportunities 
to reflect on them and give them structure. I was given that opportunity by 
being appointed a visiting scholar at the IMF, then Mercer Memorial Chair 
in Commerce at Gresham College, and later chair or member of a number 
of policy commissions and committees. There are many people who were 
involved in my appointments, and, once appointed, in helping me make the most 
of my term. In addition to those already mentioned, I am grateful to Barbara 
Anderson, Mark Blythe, Anna Gelpern, Saul Estrin, Eric Helleiner, Richard 
Higgott, Manmohan Singh Kumar, Marco Lagana, Jose-Antonio Ocampo, Ila 
Patnaik, Len Seabroke, and Joe Stiglitz. 
Many others helped in the early development of the ideas in this book, 
including Nick Barr, Claudio Borio, John Nugée, Andrew Palmer, Martin Wolf, 
and Pam Woodall. My ideas would have been left in my head or incoherently 
spread across a number of articles were it not for Ajay Shah. He listened to 
the ideas, robustly debated them, and repeatedly told me to write a book. 

Acknowledgments 
xii
When I showed reluctance, he wrote up a publisher’s outline of the book I 
would write—as opposed to the one he would write—and sent it to me. Who 
does that? 
Every Sunday growing up, my father, Professor the Honorable Bishnodat 
Persaud, would give me a random subject to think about that he retrieved 
from his worn, red notebook and ask me to come back in an hour and tell 
him about it. It made me unafraid to think, a priceless gift, reflected I hope in 
this book. My mother, the novelist Dr. Lakshmi Persaud, taught me many things 
including a love of trying to explain difficult ideas through good writing and 
speaking. I owe everything to both of them. 
Authors often say that their book would not be the same were it not for 
someone and that someone is my wife and collaborator in everything. If ever 
my writing appears lucid, this is because Ingrid Persaud, novelist, artist, and 
former legal academic, took apart the original tortured sentence and made it 
more decisive. She now has an even-clearer understanding of the topic than 
I do. My editors at Springer, Susan McDermott, Rita Fernando, Jana Weinstein, 
and earlier Jeff Olson, showed patience, assistance and forgiveness above the 
call of duty. Despite eveyone’s best efforts, the remaining errors are mine.
